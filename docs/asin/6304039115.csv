397132,A1W7JW829H45AE,6304039115,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[9, 10]","I've had a DVD copy of ""Pharaoh's Army"" in my home collection for several years, and have watched it at least a half-dozen times, each time thoroughly enjoying this little-known, Indie film that escaped my attention when it was first released in 1995. First-time writer/director Robbie Benson deserves a lot of credit for this beautifully crafted, realistic, and subtly moving film about a slice of just a few days in 1862 during the Civil War, and a small group of foraging Union soldiers, whose lives briefly and tragically intersect with a woman and her 11 year old son on their back-woods Kentucky farm. Reportedly based on a true story, this short 90 minute film captures more of the tensions that were behind the American Civil War than scores of other big-battle epics about that singular American conflict. Those looking for massive battle scenes and sweeping panoramas of smoky battlefields should look elsewhere- but if you are a contemplative sort who appreciates fine acting, beautifully framed cinematography scenes, and a subtle and moving musical score, this film will suck you in like few others. Without anything more than several carefully spaced bits of dialogue between the few principal actors, this film speaks volumes for the North-South tensions that resulted in the Civil War, and the enduring impact that conflict has had on the USA to this day.Sarah Anders (Patricia Clarkson) and her 11 year old son (Will Lucas) are trying to survive on their small Kentucky farm during 1862- her husband off fighting for the South, and their means of existence critically dependent on a few chickens, a cow, and tilling their land for crops to eat. Enter Captain Abston (Chris Cooper) and his small band of 4 Union soldiers, sent to forage food and supplies for the larger Union army campaigning in the area. Needless to say, what they want is what Sarah and her boy need to survive. After one of the Union soldiers is accidentally injured by falling on a pitchfork in her barn, the small squad is forced to stay for several days to allow the soldier to recover from his wound. The 4 supporting actors filling the roles of the Union soldiers (Chicago, Rodie, Newt and Neely) are excellent in their small roles- the sparse dialogue perfectly fits the times, and also speaks volumes about the reasons why ordinary farmers, butchers, and ordinary folks took up arms against each other. The two leads (Cooper and Clarkson) provide a wonderfully understated interaction of North vs: South, a human microcosm of the vast war. Kris Kristofferson has a brief but powerful presence as the local Southern preacher, with a black slave Israel (Mac Miles) who eventually initiates the inevitable violence that shatters the building tensions on the farm. No spoilers here, but the climax of this movie left me very moved, and stuck with me for a long time. The narrator's voice (that of the young boy, spoken in retrospect many years later) is also intersperced perfectly throughout the movie, and compliments the story very well.The soundtrack is also very understated and subtle, and fits the time and the story in a beautiful way.Cinematography is A+: the clothes and uniforms are very accurately detailed, and all the actors look their part. And for once, a period movie that also avoids modern slang language, and has the actors use dialogue that would be appropriate for 1862.I give this movie 5 stars without reservation, but only for the viewer interested in a more contemplative take on what the Civil War was all about. I liken it in many ways to ""Ride With The Devil"", though the latter also clearly is more of an action film.Civil War buffs will certainly appreciate all the subtle nuances of this film, but it's worth viewing even if you aren't of that ilk.I just wish it had been a little longer.

397133,A27T7FAONDX6VI,6304039115,"Chris ""Chris906""","[3, 4]","This is a very interesting movie. When I first received the DVD several years ago I did not know what the make of the film before watching it. I am a Civil War buff but usually prefer epic films like, 'Gettysburg', 'Glory', and 'Andersonville'. I watched the film the first time and was very impressed by it and I continue to be more impressed. It is a little film but it has a lot of heart and contains excellent acting. 'Pharaoh's Army' just feels authentic. It really brings the aspect of the Civil War that it chooses to depict to life.I really enjoyed the acting by Patricia Clarkson and Chris Cooper. They both feel very authentic. There is much good, understated acting by them. The rural farm life is brought back to life as is the fear of your supplies being plundered by an invading army. I think the film excels in this aspect as the acting done by the actors playing Cooper's soldiers and Clarkson's son is first rate. It really brings home that this was a very strange war of American vs American and that the average person on each side seemed to care less about 'The Cause'. Also, I found the character played by Kris Kristofferson to be interesting and very hard to figure out. The hatred of both sides of the war in Kentucky is brought out in a believable fashion.I really recommend this film as a slice of American history as I think it really is a little treasure.A+",5,"Moving, modest little film on a slice of the American Civil War",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1385,"['very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'When', 'first', 'received', 'DVD', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'am', 'Civil', 'War', 'buff', 'usually', 'prefer', 'epic', 'films', ""'Gettysburg"", ""'Glory"", ""'Andersonville"", 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'continue', 'be', 'more', 'impressed', 'little', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Army', 'just', 'feels', 'authentic', 'really', 'aspect', 'Civil', 'War', 'depict', 'life.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'feel', 'very', 'authentic', 'much', 'good', 'understated', 'acting', 'rural', 'farm', 'life', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'fear', 'supplies', 'being', 'plundered', 'invading', 'army', 'think', 'film', 'excels', 'aspect', 'acting', 'done', 'actors', 'playing', 'Cooper', 'soldiers', 'Clarkson', 'son', 'first', 'rate', 'really', 'home', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'war', 'American', 'vs', 'American', 'average', 'person', 'side', 'seemed', 'care', 'less', ""'The"", 'Cause', 'Also', 'found', 'character', 'played', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'be', 'interesting', 'very', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'hatred', 'sides', 'war', 'Kentucky', 'brought', 'out', 'believable', 'fashion.I', 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'slice', 'American', 'history', 'think', 'really', 'little', 'treasure.A+']",Pharaoh's Army VHS

397135,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,6304039115,Daniel Hurley,"[10, 12]","A small but very personal Civil War movie with a realistic portrayal of a mother and young son who return to their modest home in a holler located somewhere next to the Cumberland Gap. After facing the brutality of unionists in her county, mother and son hope to stay put on their modest farm stuck tightly between mountains and creek. A foraging party made up of 5 union soldiers from the gap arrive and the mother attempts to hide her livestock and food. The captain, played by Chris Cooper, while regretting his duty to take foodstuffs, is taken back by the farm, reminding him of his place and family back home. Due to an unfortunate accident to one of his men, the small platoon overstays it's welcome. The film captures the loneliness of the spirit in time of war as the mother does not know if her husband is alive or dead, nor does the captain know when he will return north to his farm. The innocence of the soldiers is captured very well as some are recent immigrants struggling to do their duty while it is apparent that most are of them are not professional soldiers, still raw recruits. The mother, played by Patricia Clarkson, guards the burial site of her daughter passionately and for a moment the captain and the mother find an almost spiriturtal bond,  both having lost something important in their life. Everything looks to be vintage 1864, the uniforms and materials all look like they are appropriate for the period. Reality steps in place as time for the soldiers seems to have a sense of foreboding. Worried about being captured by partisan rangers, they suddenly become the hunted in this shattering of a seemingly truce between the two parties. As violence enters the scene both parties revert to their respective sides of anger and frustration. The movie is very realistic with a tragic ending that could be more severe if not for the last minute use of rational thought. Kristofferson has a modest but convincing role as a revenge minded southern preacher. The scenery and materials are so rustically real, you have the impression that the farm's flatland is squeezed tightly by a mountain range in Kentucky or somewhere in Appalachia. The acting is excellent and the story thoughtful, capturing the lonesome feelings of those left far behind the lines with limited support.",5,Stark Look at War's Effect on Civilians and Those that left to Fight,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2301,"['small', 'very', 'personal', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'return', 'modest', 'home', 'holler', 'located', 'somewhere', 'next', 'Cumberland', 'Gap', 'facing', 'brutality', 'unionists', 'county', 'mother', 'son', 'hope', 'stay', 'put', 'modest', 'farm', 'stuck', 'tightly', 'mountains', 'creek', 'foraging', 'party', 'made', '5', 'union', 'soldiers', 'gap', 'arrive', 'mother', 'attempts', 'hide', 'livestock', 'food', 'captain', 'played', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'regretting', 'duty', 'take', 'foodstuffs', 'taken', 'back', 'farm', 'reminding', 'place', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'Due', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'one', 'men', 'small', 'platoon', 'welcome', 'film', 'loneliness', 'spirit', 'time', 'war', 'mother', 'not', 'know', 'husband', 'alive', 'dead', 'captain', 'know', 'when', 'will', 'return', 'north', 'farm', 'innocence', 'soldiers', 'captured', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'recent', 'immigrants', 'struggling', 'do', 'duty', 'apparent', 'most', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'still', 'raw', 'recruits', 'mother', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'burial', 'site', 'daughter', 'passionately', 'moment', 'captain', 'mother', 'find', 'almost', 'spiriturtal', 'bond', 'having', 'lost', 'something', 'important', 'life', 'Everything', 'be', 'vintage', '1864', 'uniforms', 'materials', 'look', 'are', 'appropriate', 'period', 'Reality', 'steps', 'place', 'time', 'soldiers', 'have', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'Worried', 'being', 'captured', 'partisan', 'rangers', 'suddenly', 'become', 'hunted', 'shattering', 'seemingly', 'truce', 'two', 'parties', 'violence', 'scene', 'parties', 'revert', 'respective', 'sides', 'anger', 'frustration', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'tragic', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'severe', 'not', 'last', 'minute', 'use', 'rational', 'thought', 'Kristofferson', 'modest', 'convincing', 'role', 'revenge', 'minded', 'southern', 'preacher', 'scenery', 'materials', 'are', 'so', 'rustically', 'real', 'have', 'impression', 'farm', 'flatland', 'squeezed', 'tightly', 'mountain', 'range', 'Kentucky', 'somewhere', 'Appalachia', 'acting', 'excellent', 'story', 'thoughtful', 'capturing', 'lonesome', 'feelings', 'left', 'far', 'lines', 'limited', 'support']",Pharaoh's Army VHS

For example, in one &#34;action&#34; scene, the Yankees hear gunshots far off, go to investigate, find a smouldering burned-out farm cabin, with no one around the place.  Any bodies they found had been tossed down a nearby well, with the camera focusing only upon their horrified facial expressions.

Mmm, I think not, especially when considering such as GLORY, GONE WITH THE WIND, COLD MOUNTAIN, and GETTYSBURG (despite the silly false beards).Patricia Clarkson is Sarah Anders, a Confederate sympathizer living in 1862 on an isolated hardscrabble farm on Meshack's Creek, Kentucky with her young son (Will Lucas). Sarah's husband is off fighting with the Rebs. Moreover, Sarah recently buried her daughter, only to have the body dug-up and flung aside by Northern sympathizers within hours of the internment. So, Anders has no love for Unionists, and hardly welcomes a 5-man Union Army foraging party led by Captain John Abston (Chris Cooper), which appears one day at her homestead to steal the chickens, bacon, and a cow to feed their comrades back in camp. Unfortunately, the soldiers' departure is delayed when one of Abston's men, Newt (Huckleberry Fox), tumbles off a rickety ladder and impales himself on a pitchfork, necessitating that he be placed in Sarah's own bed to be medically tended. Anders can only grit her teeth and wait.PHARAOH'S ARMY is ostensibly based on a true recollection told to folklorist Harry Caudill in 1941 by an aged Kentucky mountaineer, presumably the Anders boy in the twilight of his life. While Clarkson and Cooper do an unimpeachable job portraying two characters striving to remain decent and civil in the most trying of circumstances, the original mountaineer's story is apparently so unembellished that the viewer might wish that the film's scriptwriters had lost their heads for a brief moment and taken some dramatic license. Abston recently lost his wife, and left a young son back on his own farm - one much like Sarah's. So, his resultant attraction to Anders is understandable. At one point, the two appear to be making a human connection that transcends the bitterness of the war, but Sarah's intransigent hatred of Unionists prevails, especially after one of the captain's men misbehaves. The film sputters to an understandable, yet perhaps unremarkable, finish.The DVD's jacket implies that Kris Kristofferson, as a forbidding, Yankee-hating preacher, plays a major role. Yet, he appears only briefly thrice, and the film's editors might just as well have left him on the cutting room floor for all the impact he had on the plot, which would have been leaner and better had it just concentrated and enlarged on the Abston-Anders relationship.PHARAOH'S ARMY isn't a bad movie, only unremarkable as an entertainment vehicle.

397144,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304039115,Lawyeraau,"[12, 13]","Kudos to director Robby Henson for a superlative directorial debut, as well as for his well written screenplay, which is based upon a true story. This is a film in the best indie tradition. It is an absolute gem. Taut and spare, it does more with less. Coupled with the excellent direction and screenplay are award calibre performances by Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson, as well as by the entire supporting cast.The story takes place during the Civil War in 1862 in the state of Kentucky, which was a state uneasily divided in its loyalties, with some of its citizens favoring the Union and others favoring the Confederacy. The story revolves around the personal dynamics between a Union Captain, played with great sensitivity by Chris Cooper, and a woman, played with restrained bitterness by Patricia Clarkson, whose husband is fighting with the Confederacy.Captain Abston and four of his men chance upon the home of Sarah Anders, while they are foraging for provisions in Kentucky. They descend upon her and her eleven year old son like locusts, plundering what little she has. Yet, thanks to the Captain, they show restraint. The Captain, a widower with a young son back home in Ohio, is drawn to this spare, bitter woman. When one of his men injures himself while on her property, requiring a period of convalescence before he can be moved, the Captain and Sarah begin a slow dance of unspoken courtship. The viewer sees Sarah awaken to the captain's interest in her by her choice of dress, by her glance in a looking glass. It is beautifully played out in the most subtle of ways, but is simply not to be, as their ideological differences put them squarely in opposing camps.The subtlety and nuances in this film are finely drawn. It attempts to show the impact of war on people in a most personal way. The tension of war is always there beneath the surface, ready to bubble over, as conflict struggles with humanity. The ordinary tasks of one's daily life become almost poignant under the circumstances. Yet, it is always a question as to whether conflict will triumph over humanity. This film illustrates some of these issues in a very meaningful way. It is a small gem of a film that deals with some very big issues in a way that almost breaks one's heart.

Instead of selling out for cliches and big stars, it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast, the strength of a well written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this film, try to see the brilliant indie Civil War film &quot;Wicked Spring&quot; as well).&quot;Pharaoh&quot; simply tells the true story of a small expedition/forage team of Union men who ride into a Confederate farm to take provisions, but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men. Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history. Superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional, but often doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, more along the lines of hearing a story.The film boasts an incredible performance from Chris Cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role. He transforms, but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to. Patricia Clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and where she's the more severe of the characters, is still as easy to identify with. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well.The art design and the set are wonderful, and personally I love the cinematography. It all has the feel of a Civil War period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metalic tint, but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. Everything looks like it belongs where it is, it feels period, something I find rare in American period films. The actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes.Above all, this film is very personal. I think that as an indie it can afford it. The film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation, as bad as it is. It doesn't fail in getting it's point across, and it gets it's point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days. It's brave. It relies on it's characters, a fantastic script, human emotion, and in the cold hard fact that the Civil War wasn't all CGI, big stars, and hoop skirts.",5,"Gritty, Raw and Beautiful film about the Civil War",1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,2872,"['quot', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'quot', 'defies', 'formula', 'Instead', 'selling', 'out', 'cliches', 'big', 'stars', 'completely', 'excellent', 'acting', 'strong', 'cast', 'strength', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'fascinating', 'bitter', 'story', 'result', 'raw', 'realistic', 'film', 'fast', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'current', 'One', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Civil', 'War', 'think', 'can', 'owe', 'pleasure', 'being', 'independent', 'film', 'like', 'film', 'try', 'see', 'brilliant', 'indie', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'quot', 'Wicked', 'Spring', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Pharaoh', 'quot', 'simply', 'true', 'story', 'small', 'expedition/forage', 'team', 'Union', 'men', 'who', 'ride', 'Confederate', 'farm', 'take', 'provisions', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'there', 'accident', 'one', 'men', 'Tensions', 'broil', 'relationships', 'are', 'made', 'broken', 'Nothing', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'write', 'movie', 'mind', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'quality', 'film', 'telling', 'history', 'Superb', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'exposition', 'move', 'film', 'highly', 'professional', 'often', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'lines', 'hearing', 'story.The', 'film', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'amazing', 'versatility', 'exploration', 'role', 'always', 'height', 'believability', 'easy', 'emotionally', 'relate', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'equally', 'stellar', 'realistic', 'role', 'many', 'actresses', 'would', 'crumble', 'shares', 'interesting', 'chemistry', 'Cooper', 'character', 'where', 'more', 'severe', 'characters', 'still', 'easy', 'identify', 'rest', 'cast', 'quite', 'capable', 'fill', 'roles', 'well.The', 'art', 'design', 'set', 'are', 'wonderful', 'personally', 'love', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'Civil', 'War', 'period', 'photograph', 'camera', 'presenting', 'strong', 'contrasting', 'colors', 'shadows', 'tin-like', 'metalic', 'tint', 'always', 'keeping', 'naturalistic', 'look', 'rustic', 'setting', 'seem', 'have', 'used', 'natural', 'lighting', 'used', 'works', 'beautifully', 'Everything', 'where', 'period', 'something', 'find', 'rare', 'American', 'period', 'films', 'actors', 'act', '19th', 'century', 'not', '20th', 'century', 'people', 'old', 'clothes.Above', 'film', 'very', 'personal', 'think', 'indie', 'can', 'afford', 'film', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'outstanding', 'script', 'effortlessly', 'relationships', 'personalities', 'characters', 'grow', 'situation', 'as', 'bad', ""n't"", 'fail', 'getting', 'point', 'across', 'point', 'usual', 'overused', 'techniques', 'are', 'used', 'war', 'films', 'days', 'brave', 'characters', 'fantastic', 'script', 'human', 'emotion', 'cold', 'hard', 'fact', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', ""n't"", 'CGI', 'big', 'stars', 'hoop', 'skirts']",Pharaoh's Army VHS

397149,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,6304039115,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[7, 8]","A terrific film about division and hatred.  I agree with a previous reviewer that this absolutely superior film defies comparison.  Nevertheless, the film is somewhat reminiscent of the excellent 'Ride with the Devil', a film about Confederate irregulars in Missouri, and even resembles, in some ways, 'The Last Valley,' with Omar Sharif and Michael Caine.  'The Last Valley' isn't about 'our' Civil war but about the even more devastating 30 years war in Germany.  Mercenaries have discovered a hidden valley in Germany that hasn't been totally 'eaten out' and devastated by war.  The mercenaries, led by Michal Caine as 'The Captain' will correct that quickly.  The local Burgomeister [Omar Shariff] convinces them that their best tactic is to overwinter there taking only what they require.  They do, putting them in prolonged contact with an unhappy civilian population.In its own way, 'Pharaoh's Army' is an even better film.  Essentially decent men are ordered to do totally indecent things [""I Vas just taking orders""].  Union foragers in the Cumberland region of Kentucky raid Southern sympathizing farms taking everything that their hungry army requires.  Mostly what they want is food.  People...mostly women and children...who are already undergoing deep privation, have Yankee soldiers show up to steal everything that they can...hams, chickens, cattle, hogs, even horses.  Who knows how many of these poor people simply starved to death never making it to the rolls of 'honored dead' during the War?This is the context of the film.  A young Union forager, while looking for hidden food, falls from a hayloft and is impaled on a farm implement [great material for a modern-day lawsuit, if you think about it].  His four companions, including 'The Captain' are obliged to stay until the soldier dies or recovers enough to be moved.  Therefore the Yankees are obliged to live beside the woman and teenage boy that they have robbed.'The Captain' is a decent sort and really has no business in a looting/man-killing war.  He says he impetuously volunteered for Union service when his preacher exposed the scarred back of a runaway slave.  On the other hand, he is at heart a farmer and no airyfairy idealist.  He has a small farm, similar to the one he is looting, just over the Ohio River in Southern Ohio.  He soon finds himself plowing a field so that the family will have corn during the Summer.  You get the impression that the Captain would rather stay [his wife died two years previously] rather than continuing to 'Save the Union.'  It isn't to be and the story devolves into bloodshed and hatred.One of the best things about the film is that it deeply explores the underlying issues of Civil War.  There is a young Union soldier, recently from Germany.  ""Why did you join?"" he is asked.  ""Because I was tired of making sausage.""  His motives go no deeper than that but, unlike many others he has thought about it.  "" There's not one Union soldier who would give up his precious life to free a bunch of...blacks,"" he says.  Here is the truth.  Anti-slavery/pro-slavery rhetoric was for the elites--those who didn't have to fight and die.  The soldiers, north and south, were fighting for Union/Secession, because they were drafted or because they couldn't stand the moral pressure at home. ""A rich man's War; A poor man's fight"", was the bitter cry.Watch the movie, you'll be glad you did.  It may be especially pertinent at this particular time when again the whiff of disunion is in the air.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--abouth the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,Why haven't I heard about this movie until now?,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,3617,"['terrific', 'film', 'division', 'hatred', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'absolutely', 'superior', 'film', 'defies', 'comparison', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'excellent', ""'Ride"", 'Devil', 'film', 'Confederate', 'irregulars', 'Missouri', 'even', 'resembles', 'ways', 'Last', 'Valley', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Last', 'Valley', ""n't"", 'about', ""'our"", 'Civil', 'war', 'even', 'more', 'devastating', '30', 'years', 'war', 'Germany', 'Mercenaries', 'have', 'discovered', 'hidden', 'valley', 'Germany', ""n't"", 'been', 'totally', ""'eaten"", 'out', 'devastated', 'war', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Michal', 'Caine', ""'The"", 'Captain', 'will', 'correct', 'quickly', 'local', 'Burgomeister', '[', 'Omar', 'Shariff', ']', 'best', 'tactic', 'overwinter', 'there', 'taking', 'only', 'what', 'require', 'do', 'putting', 'prolonged', 'contact', 'unhappy', 'civilian', 'population.In', 'own', 'way', 'Army', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'Essentially', 'decent', 'men', 'are', 'ordered', 'do', 'totally', 'indecent', 'things', '[', 'Vas', 'just', 'taking', 'orders', ']', 'Union', 'foragers', 'Cumberland', 'region', 'Kentucky', 'raid', 'Southern', 'sympathizing', 'farms', 'taking', 'everything', 'hungry', 'army', 'Mostly', 'what', 'want', 'food', 'People', 'mostly', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'undergoing', 'deep', 'privation', 'have', 'Yankee', 'soldiers', 'show', 'up', 'steal', 'everything', 'can', 'hams', 'chickens', 'cattle', 'hogs', 'even', 'horses', 'Who', 'how', 'many', 'poor', 'people', 'simply', 'starved', 'death', 'never', 'making', 'rolls', ""'honored"", 'dead', 'War', 'context', 'film', 'young', 'Union', 'forager', 'looking', 'hidden', 'food', 'hayloft', 'impaled', 'farm', 'implement', '[', 'great', 'material', 'modern-day', 'lawsuit', 'think', ']', 'four', 'companions', 'including', ""'The"", 'Captain', 'are', 'obliged', 'stay', 'soldier', 'recovers', 'enough', 'be', 'moved', 'Yankees', 'are', 'obliged', 'live', 'woman', 'teenage', 'boy', 'have', 'robbed', 'Captain', 'decent', 'sort', 'really', 'business', 'looting/man-killing', 'war', 'impetuously', 'volunteered', 'Union', 'service', 'when', 'preacher', 'exposed', 'scarred', 'back', 'runaway', 'slave', 'other', 'hand', 'heart', 'farmer', 'airyfairy', 'idealist', 'small', 'farm', 'similar', 'one', 'looting', 'just', 'Ohio', 'River', 'Southern', 'Ohio', 'soon', 'plowing', 'field', 'so', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'corn', 'Summer', 'get', 'impression', 'Captain', 'would', 'rather', 'stay', 'wife', 'died', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'rather', 'continuing', ""'Save"", 'Union', ""n't"", 'be', 'story', 'bloodshed', 'hatred.One', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'underlying', 'issues', 'Civil', 'War', 'young', 'Union', 'soldier', 'recently', 'Germany', 'Why', 'did', 'join', 'asked', 'was', 'tired', 'making', 'sausage', 'motives', 'go', 'deeper', 'many', 'others', 'thought', 'it.', 'not', 'one', 'Union', 'soldier', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'precious', 'life', 'free', 'bunch', 'blacks', 'Here', 'truth', 'Anti-slavery/pro-slavery', 'rhetoric', 'was', 'elites', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fight', 'die', 'soldiers', 'north', 'south', 'were', 'fighting', 'Union/Secession', 'were', 'drafted', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'moral', 'pressure', 'home', 'rich', 'man', 'War', 'A', 'poor', 'man', 'fight', 'was', 'bitter', 'cry.Watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'may', 'be', 'especially', 'pertinent', 'particular', 'time', 'when', 'again', 'whiff', 'disunion', 'air.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Rack', ""'Hummingbird"", 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",Pharaoh's Army VHS
397150,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,6304039115,Theo Logos,"[41, 45]","The Civil War is the most ironically named of wars, for there was no civility to it. It was a ghastly, vicious, blood feud between countrymen and neighbors where decency was among the first casualties of war. That fact has often been lost in big sweeping dramas about the Civil War where we can focus on the grandeur of great armies in motion and the big concepts of honor and cause. Director Robby Henson forces our attention back to the ugly truth of the war by focusing on a much smaller story. No great armies clash in `Pharaoh's Army'. Instead, we see only a tiny rural community in the bitterly divided boarder state of Kentucky, where neighbors rein terror on each other according to their allegiances, and where a small group of Yankee soldiers comes foraging; stealing chickens instead of fighting Rebels.The film opens with the funeral of a little girl, who is later that night exhumed and hurled without ceremony out of the cemetery; Union neighbors would not have the body of a Secesh's child resting with their kin. A later scene shows an old farmer and his wife who were murdered and thrown into their well as their house burns for the simple reason that they sent two sons to fight for the Union. Into this bitter savagery rides a small band of Yankee soldiers foraging food from Rebel's farms. They have not yet been in battle, and are more than a little chagrined to be stealing chickens rather than fighting Rebs. An accident to one forces them to hold up at the farm of Sarah Anders (Patricia Clarkson) a Rebel's wife who burns with a barely contained righteous rage against all Yankees, yet has no choice but to submit to their demands to protect herself and her boy. The Yankee captain (Chris Cooper) has not yet learned to hate from the war, and struggles to show as much kindness and decency as he can to these folk he is robbing of their substance. The heart of the film is the tense relationship that develops between the Yankee Captain and Mrs. Anders as they discover occasional moments of shared humanity, but are left starring at each other over the impassable, blood filled gulf of the war, and discover that in war, hate trumps kindness, and there is no decency.Patricia Clarkson absolutely shines in her role as Sarah Anders. With a mere glance she is able to show the strength, pride, hate, longing, despair and fortitude that holds the fierce Mrs. Anders together. Chris Cooper matches her with his own brilliant and subtle portrayal of Captain Abston, tormented by his own gentleness as he struggles to be a soldier. Kris Kristofferson's cameo as the Preacher provides more ambiance than acting, but is still a nice touch. Shot on location in the hills of Kentucky, the film is as beautiful as its story is tragic.Robby Henson succeeded admirably with `Pharaoh's Army' in showing  the human cost of the Civil War; not just in lives lost and blood shed,  but in the living's loss of their humanity. This film is a tragic masterpiece, and you should not miss it.Theo Logos",5,"""I don't guess the Civil War was about bein' decent.""",1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,3005,"['Civil', 'War', 'most', 'ironically', 'named', 'wars', 'was', 'civility', 'was', 'ghastly', 'vicious', 'blood', 'feud', 'countrymen', 'neighbors', 'where', 'decency', 'was', 'first', 'casualties', 'war', 'fact', 'often', 'been', 'lost', 'big', 'sweeping', 'dramas', 'Civil', 'War', 'where', 'can', 'focus', 'grandeur', 'great', 'armies', 'motion', 'big', 'concepts', 'honor', 'cause', 'Director', 'Robby', 'Henson', 'attention', 'back', 'ugly', 'truth', 'war', 'focusing', 'much', 'smaller', 'story', 'great', 'armies', 'clash', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'Instead', 'see', 'only', 'tiny', 'rural', 'community', 'bitterly', 'divided', 'boarder', 'state', 'Kentucky', 'where', 'neighbors', 'rein', 'terror', 'other', 'according', 'allegiances', 'where', 'small', 'group', 'Yankee', 'soldiers', 'foraging', 'stealing', 'chickens', 'instead', 'fighting', 'Rebels.The', 'film', 'funeral', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'later', 'night', 'exhumed', 'hurled', 'ceremony', 'cemetery', 'Union', 'neighbors', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'body', 'Secesh', 'child', 'resting', 'kin', 'later', 'scene', 'old', 'farmer', 'wife', 'who', 'were', 'murdered', 'thrown', 'well', 'house', 'burns', 'simple', 'reason', 'sent', 'two', 'sons', 'fight', 'Union', 'Into', 'bitter', 'savagery', 'small', 'band', 'Yankee', 'soldiers', 'foraging', 'food', 'Rebel', 'farms', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'battle', 'are', 'more', 'little', 'chagrined', 'be', 'stealing', 'chickens', 'rather', 'fighting', 'Rebs', 'accident', 'one', 'forces', 'hold', 'up', 'farm', 'Sarah', 'Anders', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Rebel', 'wife', 'who', 'barely', 'contained', 'righteous', 'rage', 'Yankees', 'yet', 'choice', 'submit', 'demands', 'protect', 'boy', 'Yankee', 'captain', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'not', 'yet', 'learned', 'hate', 'war', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'kindness', 'decency', 'can', 'folk', 'robbing', 'substance', 'heart', 'film', 'tense', 'relationship', 'Yankee', 'Captain', 'Mrs.', 'Anders', 'discover', 'occasional', 'moments', 'shared', 'humanity', 'are', 'left', 'starring', 'other', 'impassable', 'blood', 'filled', 'gulf', 'war', 'discover', 'war', 'hate', 'trumps', 'kindness', 'decency.Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Anders', 'mere', 'glance', 'able', 'show', 'strength', 'pride', 'hate', 'longing', 'despair', 'fortitude', 'fierce', 'Mrs.', 'Anders', 'together', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'own', 'brilliant', 'subtle', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'Abston', 'tormented', 'own', 'gentleness', 'be', 'soldier', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'cameo', 'Preacher', 'more', 'ambiance', 'acting', 'still', 'nice', 'touch', 'Shot', 'location', 'hills', 'Kentucky', 'film', 'as', 'beautiful', 'story', 'tragic.Robby', 'Henson', 'succeeded', 'admirably', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'showing', 'human', 'cost', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'just', 'lives', 'lost', 'blood', 'shed', 'living', 'loss', 'humanity', 'film', 'tragic', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'it.Theo', 'Logos']",Pharaoh's Army VHS
397151,A3373I4II32NA1,6304039115,Tyler,"[5, 5]","This movie takes place deep in the hills of 1862 Kentucky somewhere near the Cumberland Gap. While her husband is off fighting in the Confederate Army, a farm woman and her 11-year old boy face bitterness when their Yankee neighbors down the way uncover the grave of the woman's daughter which they had to bury of recently. Shortly after relocating the grave to their own land, a foraging detail of 5 Union soldiers led by a Yankee captain played by Chris Cooper, come across their farm for supplies from the farms of enemy contraband. They're just about on their way when one of the Yankees hurts himself by falling on something sharp in the barn.One of the reviews says that while the soldier is too hurt to be moved and has to recover, the Yankee officer and the farm woman kind of have a ""courtship"" going on. I just finished the movie 5 minutes ago and would have to disagree with that, seeing as the scenes are still fresh in my mind. It seems more like what the woman and the officer share is sort of an uneasy truce between each other. The captain is there because his orders are to send any found supplies down to the waiting hungry Yankee troops over in the Cumberland Gap, and the woman knows that his men have been trying to rob them blind, despite her best efforts to hide her food supplies however she can. So when the captain feels like he can offer the boy some tips on how to plant a corn crop, seeing as he has a farm of his own, the woman even suggests the idea of if he can really make them feel better after trying to rob them by making everything okay. He comforts her when she's at the grave of her daughter, but that is all I've seen of their ""courtship.""The uneasy truce falls apart when the family dog takes a bit of the food that the Yankees have stolen and are cooking over a fire. One of the soldiers is pissed about that and makes a move to harm the dog. When the woman protests this, he tells her to ""Go to hell."" She throws a bucket at his back in retaliation and he tries to assault her, but the captain intervenes, just to have the soldier say sarcastically to him, ""I hope you get a piece."" That leads to another struggle and instead of looking grateful, the woman exclaims that she hopes they all kill each other.The Yankee detail just about loses half of their men in the whole thing. One of the soldiers attempts to desert, despite the captain's threats to kill him if he does so. The soldier is killed, but I don't know if the captain pulled the trigger on him or if it came from the lone sniper hiding in the hills which pins down the entire detail for about 20 minutes or so. Once Chris Cooper tracks down the man and kills him, everyone is surprised to see that the sniper was really a Negro, who belonged to a preacher in that community.The other man that dies is the wounded man. As the Yankee detail finally leaves, they depart with the family mule and even the bed with the wounded man on it. The boy goes after them in pursuit among the hills and the trees with a loaded pistol and kills the wounded Yankee up close, then while the rest of the detail is in complete confusion, he escapes into the hills and back to the farm. The captain goes back to the farm with the dead body and the mule, and even in his anguish, he can't bring himself to kill the woman and the boy, so he fires two shots in the air and leaves, hoping the dead man will at least get a Christian burial.The best the Yankee soldier can get as a burial is being nudged into a small opening of a crevice left by some tree that partially toppled over. This movie happens to be a true story, as it says in the end that about 60 years later, the narrator of the movie went back to that same knothole where the Yankee was taken to. They may have survived the war, but the father in the Confederate Army certainly doesn't, meeting the same fate as the other 620,000 Americans in that war did.If you're looking for a movie where there's plenty of battle-action, this certainly isn't the flick for you. But if you want a Civil War movie that describes daily life on the home front, especially on those who owned farms that had to deal with Yankee foraging raiders, this movie is an A-plus.

397154,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6304039115,Wuchak,"[5, 9]","Let's face it, there aren't that many great Civil War films out there. ""Glory,"" ""The Horse Soldiers"" and ""Ride With the Devil"" are the only ones I recall off hand; ""The Blue and the Gray"" and ""Cold Mountain"" also have numerous good points. ""Gettysburg,"" on the other hand, is a bloated, melodramatic, artificial bore (made exclusively for Civil War buffs, whatever that is); I've never seen its prequel.The peculiarly-titled ""Pharaoh's Army"" is a 1995 indie film about a real-life incident that took place in Kentucky during the Civil War. Because Kentucky was a border state the allegiances of its people were split between North & South. I'm sure it was hard to be neutral.THE PLOT: A Union captain (Chris Cooper) and four soldiers invade a young widow's farm in the Kentucky wilderness (the widow is played by Patricia Clarkson); since her husband fought and died for the Confederacy they supposedly have the right to her livestock, even though she argues that she and her boy will likely starve come winter. One of the soldiers is accidently wounded and they are forced to stay for a few days. The captain attempts to be a gentleman and even helps out on the small farm, but he fails to win any kind of favor with the widow, who rightly views them as nothing more than invading enemies. Events turn deadly and the captain, even though a good-hearted gentleman, is forced into an intense position.Although the story is based on real events and takes place during the Civil War, this is not an epic war film with big battle scenes, strategizing generals, etc. The entire film takes place in and around the widow's small farm and focuses soley on the events that take place there. This limited scope may turn some viewers off.Even though this is a small indie film, the score, cast, acting and writing are all top notch. The story is fairly slow-paced and there are no cataclysmic events to arouse those with ADD. The first time I saw it, I thought it was good, but not great. I viewed it again about a year later (earlier this summer) and liked it even more. Lately images of this picture have popped into my mind and something occurred to me: The way the film plays out and is presented to the viewer is REAL LIFE. What I mean is that it's almost as if someone went back in time and actually filmed the actual events. This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I tire of all the silly hollywoodisms common in modern American cinema -- supposedly humorous one-liners, unrealistic action scenes, excessive explosions, melodrama, unconvincing dialogue, etc.The ending is powerful as the captain, a good man, is thrust into a position of cold-blooded murder in the name of war. It's intense, and so REAL. The insanity of war can easily turn the best of us into heartless killers.The cover of the DVD prominently features Kris Kristofferson, but his role as a pro-South Kentucky preacher is relatively minor.FYI: ""Pharaoh's Army"" was acually filmed in Kentucky, no doubt near where the real events took place.BOTTOM LINE: This is a small film about a minor peripheral incident during the Civil War. It's not a big league Hollywood picture with the corresponding melodramtic, pretentiousness like, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (although that film has some undeniable positive qualities, like the D-Day invasion, there are way too many forced, artificial moments and dialogue -- remember the moronic dog tag scene?). ""Pharaoh's Army"" is generally a quiet film and likely won't blow you away or anything. What it has in its favor, however, is unpretentious REALISM. It's refreshing; and it will stay with you.",5,REAL LIFE Cinema,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,3605,"['Let', 'face', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'great', 'Civil', 'War', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'Glory', 'Horse', 'Soldiers', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'recall', 'hand', 'Blue', 'Gray', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'also', 'have', 'numerous', 'good', 'points', 'Gettysburg', 'other', 'hand', 'bloated', 'melodramatic', 'artificial', 'bore', 'made', 'exclusively', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'whatever', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'prequel.The', 'peculiarly-titled', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', '1995', 'indie', 'film', 'real-life', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'Kentucky', 'Civil', 'War', 'Kentucky', 'was', 'border', 'state', 'allegiances', 'people', 'were', 'split', 'North', 'South', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'hard', 'be', 'neutral.THE', 'PLOT', 'Union', 'captain', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'four', 'soldiers', 'invade', 'young', 'widow', 'farm', 'Kentucky', 'wilderness', 'widow', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'husband', 'fought', 'died', 'Confederacy', 'supposedly', 'have', 'right', 'livestock', 'even', 'boy', 'will', 'likely', 'starve', 'come', 'winter', 'One', 'soldiers', 'accidently', 'wounded', 'are', 'forced', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'captain', 'attempts', 'be', 'gentleman', 'even', 'out', 'small', 'farm', 'win', 'kind', 'favor', 'widow', 'who', 'rightly', 'nothing', 'more', 'invading', 'enemies', 'Events', 'turn', 'deadly', 'captain', 'even', 'good-hearted', 'gentleman', 'forced', 'intense', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'place', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'epic', 'war', 'film', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'strategizing', 'generals', 'etc', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'widow', 'small', 'farm', 'soley', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'there', 'limited', 'scope', 'may', 'turn', 'viewers', 'off.Even', 'small', 'indie', 'film', 'score', 'cast', 'acting', 'writing', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'fairly', 'slow-paced', 'are', 'cataclysmic', 'events', 'arouse', 'ADD', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'viewed', 'again', 'year', 'later', 'earlier', 'summer', 'liked', 'even', 'more', 'Lately', 'picture', 'have', 'popped', 'mind', 'something', 'occurred', 'way', 'film', 'out', 'presented', 'viewer', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'What', 'mean', 'almost', 'someone', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'actually', 'filmed', 'actual', 'events', 'good', 'thing', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'tire', 'silly', 'hollywoodisms', 'common', 'modern', 'American', 'cinema', 'supposedly', 'humorous', 'one-liners', 'unrealistic', 'action', 'scenes', 'excessive', 'explosions', 'melodrama', 'unconvincing', 'dialogue', 'etc.The', 'ending', 'powerful', 'captain', 'good', 'man', 'thrust', 'position', 'cold-blooded', 'murder', 'name', 'war', 'intense', 'so', 'REAL', 'insanity', 'war', 'can', 'easily', 'turn', 'best', 'heartless', 'killers.The', 'cover', 'DVD', 'prominently', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'role', 'pro-South', 'Kentucky', 'preacher', 'relatively', 'minor.FYI', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'was', 'acually', 'filmed', 'Kentucky', 'doubt', 'where', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'place.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'small', 'film', 'minor', 'peripheral', 'incident', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'big', 'league', 'Hollywood', 'picture', 'corresponding', 'melodramtic', 'pretentiousness', 'say', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'film', 'undeniable', 'positive', 'qualities', 'D-Day', 'invasion', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'forced', 'artificial', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'remember', 'moronic', 'dog', 'tag', 'scene', 'Pharaoh', 'Army', 'generally', 'quiet', 'film', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'anything', 'What', 'favor', 'however', 'unpretentious', 'REALISM', 'refreshing', 'will', 'stay']",Pharaoh's Army VHS
