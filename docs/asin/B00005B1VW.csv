579600,A15C7PFILHQNNO,B00005B1VW,D. Breakey,"[5, 5]","First of all, the editorial review apparently doesn't understand that Japanese animation does not share the American animation obsession with neat, clean endings with everything tied up nicely. It would be more appropriate to compare this to live-action material intended for the same age range, where neat endings are not quite so common. This is not Saturday-morning animation, no matter what FOX thinks; it is a satisfyingly complex plot intended for an older audience, although there is little here I would object to letting a younger child watch. Incidentally, the FOX version of this masterpiece is badly hacked up; I watched the first two episodes of it and flatly refused to watch more (I had already watched the entire series in subtitled format). Very disappointing, as that was an ideal opportunity to introduce this to a wider audience.That said, the ending of this series came as a bit of a surprise. While I still enjoyed it, and consider it an excellent wrap-up to an excellent series, I felt it was a little disjointed--a different style from the rest of the series. Like other reviewers, I feel that the series could easily have been extended by several more episodes, or even an entire season--so much was left uncovered. On top of that, it can also be said that most of the characters were so well developed that it was almost painful to have to watch the closing, knowing that there wasn't more; this is one of those stories that will never end--Escaflowne was not a complete tale; it was merely a glimpse into a wider world, albeit a fascinating one.However, all good stories are like that, with the feeling that there is something more happening just out of sight. If it works for live-action, why not for animation?",4,The only (slight) disappointment in an excellent series,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,1738,"['First', 'all', 'editorial', 'review', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'not', 'share', 'American', 'animation', 'obsession', 'neat', 'clean', 'endings', 'everything', 'tied', 'up', 'nicely', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'compare', 'live-action', 'material', 'intended', 'same', 'age', 'range', 'where', 'neat', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'common', 'not', 'Saturday-morning', 'animation', 'matter', 'what', 'FOX', 'satisfyingly', 'complex', 'plot', 'intended', 'older', 'audience', 'little', 'here', 'would', 'object', 'letting', 'younger', 'child', 'watch', 'Incidentally', 'FOX', 'version', 'masterpiece', 'badly', 'hacked', 'up', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'flatly', 'refused', 'watch', 'more', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'subtitled', 'format', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'was', 'ideal', 'opportunity', 'introduce', 'wider', 'audience.That', 'said', 'ending', 'series', 'came', 'bit', 'surprise', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'consider', 'excellent', 'wrap-up', 'excellent', 'series', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'disjointed', 'different', 'style', 'rest', 'series', 'other', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'series', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'extended', 'several', 'more', 'episodes', 'even', 'entire', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'uncovered', 'top', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'have', 'watch', 'closing', 'knowing', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'one', 'stories', 'will', 'never', 'end', 'Escaflowne', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'tale', 'was', 'merely', 'glimpse', 'wider', 'world', 'fascinating', 'one.However', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'feeling', 'something', 'more', 'happening', 'just', 'sight', 'live-action', 'why', 'not', 'animation']",N/A

We were blown away by how utterly fantastic and engaging the original version was - so much so that we anxiously awaited each installment (couldn't afford to get them all at once).The animation and story of this series is easily the best I've ever seen -as engaging as the original Robotech and far surpassing it in intelligence and beauty.  The characters are likable, the music is stirring, and the story highly compelling -UNTIL-What the heck happened in this last disc? Its like another writer took over.  What was a wonderful story gets abruptly ended with some kitty girl pseudo incest/lesbianism (which was kind've a downer considering we were watching the show with our kid and there'd been nothing like this in the entire series up until this point), and a tacked on nonsensical psychobabble ending (think: Akira).We were VERY disappointed by the conclusion to this series, because the rest of it is HIGHLY recommended.

The plot line was very intriguing, though, they were a lot of questions that need to be answered. Hopefully the movie will cover most of the questions. The characters were incredible, centralizing around Van, Hitomi, and Allen. All were highly memorable and developed thoroughly throughout the series, especially Van and Hitomi. The idea of Isaac Newton being a bad guy is just magnificent, that at least gives the series 4 stars.The presentation was also good and the Escaflowne singing, chanting was kinda soothing. The visuals were not totally state-of-the-art, but were good and the fight scenes were smooth and quick. It was a colorful anime with some humor, some love, and some sadness.

It had pretty good animation(for 1996), a great story, memorable characters, plenty of action, and drama. I was totally engrossed until the last 5 episodes or so. Up until that point, the story had a very epic feeling going for it. As it reached the end, it seemed to lose it's fire. There was no epic final battle, no tear jerking farewell, or no heartwarming reuniting of lost lovers. It just kind of ended.

579608,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00005B1VW,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[5, 5]","These are the last stanzas in what is one of the monuments of Japanese anime, a rich fantasy story as memorable as any other notable series.  Hitomi, after fleeing Gaea back to earth finds that her experiences have left her with many unresolved feelings.  When Van flies Escaflowne across the gap between the worlds to retrieve her she joins him, even though it is to return to the middle of an horrific war.  Hitomi realizes that she can run no longer - that if Gaea is to heal, she must do her part.By this DVD it is clear to the viewer that fate, and its changing, is the underlying theme of this series.  Isaac Newton attempts to manipulate it so that the Zaibach Empire will rule the world, nearly repeating the mistake of the Atlantean forebearers of the Gaeans.  Tarot cards reveal futures that seem inevitable.  And the intertwining of the characters defies the rules of coincidence.Into this apparent march to cataclysmic disaster and tragedy enters Hitomi, the most atypical of anime heroines.  Thin and athletic rather than lush, cute rather than pretty, it is her inner nature rather than any physical ability that gives her the power to challenge the inevitable.  Hitomi's special skill is the power to believe.  And in doing so, she reveals that fate is far from ineluctable, that simply humans can change outcomes with their minds and hearts.Hitomi's confusion about her feelings towards Van and Alan Schezar, her hatred of the continuous stream of violence that mars life on Gaea, and the struggle she has to accept what she can do make her a warm and accessible character to the viewer.  This is true of all the protagonists of Escaflowne, making what would otherwise be a pompous fantasy concoction into a compelling, life affirming drama.As endings go, this one starts a bit too slowly and ends too soon.  I would have liked to see a stronger focus on the dynamics between Hitomi and Van as they realize their love for each other and must confront the roadblocks in their way.  There is room for an entire additional episode, although the movie version of Escaflowne fills in much of this touching connection between two people separated by worlds.  Even so, this is a fitting end to what has been a delightful series - one which I will always recommend without question.",5,Be Careful What You Wish For&#65533;,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,2290,"['are', 'last', 'stanzas', 'what', 'one', 'monuments', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'rich', 'fantasy', 'story', 'as', 'memorable', 'other', 'notable', 'series', 'Hitomi', 'fleeing', 'Gaea', 'back', 'earth', 'finds', 'experiences', 'have', 'left', 'many', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'When', 'Van', 'Escaflowne', 'gap', 'worlds', 'retrieve', 'even', 'return', 'middle', 'horrific', 'war', 'Hitomi', 'can', 'run', 'no', 'longer', 'Gaea', 'heal', 'must', 'do', 'part.By', 'DVD', 'clear', 'viewer', 'fate', 'changing', 'underlying', 'theme', 'series', 'Isaac', 'Newton', 'manipulate', 'so', 'Zaibach', 'Empire', 'will', 'rule', 'world', 'nearly', 'repeating', 'mistake', 'Atlantean', 'forebearers', 'Gaeans', 'Tarot', 'cards', 'reveal', 'futures', 'seem', 'inevitable', 'intertwining', 'characters', 'rules', 'coincidence.Into', 'apparent', 'march', 'cataclysmic', 'disaster', 'tragedy', 'enters', 'Hitomi', 'most', 'atypical', 'anime', 'heroines', 'Thin', 'athletic', 'rather', 'lush', 'cute', 'rather', 'pretty', 'inner', 'nature', 'rather', 'physical', 'ability', 'power', 'challenge', 'inevitable', 'Hitomi', 'special', 'skill', 'power', 'believe', 'doing', 'so', 'fate', 'far', 'ineluctable', 'simply', 'humans', 'can', 'change', 'outcomes', 'minds', 'hearts.Hitomi', 'confusion', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Van', 'Alan', 'Schezar', 'hatred', 'continuous', 'stream', 'violence', 'life', 'Gaea', 'struggle', 'accept', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'warm', 'accessible', 'character', 'viewer', 'true', 'protagonists', 'Escaflowne', 'making', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'pompous', 'fantasy', 'concoction', 'compelling', 'life', 'affirming', 'drama.As', 'endings', 'go', 'one', 'bit', 'too', 'slowly', 'too', 'soon', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'stronger', 'focus', 'dynamics', 'Hitomi', 'Van', 'realize', 'love', 'other', 'must', 'confront', 'roadblocks', 'way', 'room', 'entire', 'additional', 'episode', 'movie', 'version', 'Escaflowne', 'fills', 'much', 'touching', 'connection', 'two', 'people', 'separated', 'worlds', 'Even', 'so', 'fitting', 'end', 'what', 'been', 'delightful', 'series', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'recommend', 'question']",N/A
