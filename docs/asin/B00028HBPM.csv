At any rate, one is not sure if his piano is really singing, however unmuscial the original theme might have been. And that is inspite of the fact that he was obviously singing/humming when he plodded along just like what Glenn Gould was doing when playing Bach.Coming to Beethoven, Schnabel's touch is marvelous (and so his articulations-- but not his fluency). The tide may well have changed. Kempff said he didn't like and any percussive sound, but one wonders if he is fully immune of that. Gulda took things further. (According to Martha, that is part of the reason why some audience don't take too much delight on him: because of the sound he produced.) Nowadays, many pianists can't play any legato properly without relying on the pedal!!Having said that, from his playing one can tell Piotr's musical visions are so clear and his playing is sensitive enough and these alone make this DVD worthwhile.",3,A Worthwile DVD,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,1061,"['Quite', 'right', 'Piotr', 'tone', 'brittle', 'bright', 'strident', 'pains', 'were', 'taken', 're-tune', 'fix', 'gradations', 'eveness/uneven-ness', 'timbre', 'rate', 'one', 'not', 'sure', 'piano', 'really', 'singing', 'however', 'unmuscial', 'original', 'theme', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'inspite', 'fact', 'was', 'obviously', 'singing/humming', 'when', 'plodded', 'along', 'just', 'what', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'playing', 'Bach.Coming', 'Beethoven', 'Schnabel', 'touch', 'marvelous', 'so', 'articulations', 'not', 'fluency', 'tide', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'changed', 'Kempff', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'percussive', 'sound', 'one', 'wonders', 'fully', 'immune', 'Gulda', 'took', 'things', 'further', 'According', 'Martha', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'delight', 'sound', 'produced', 'Nowadays', 'many', 'pianists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'legato', 'properly', 'relying', 'pedal', 'Having', 'said', 'playing', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'Piotr', 'musical', 'visions', 'are', 'so', 'clear', 'playing', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'alone', 'make', 'DVD', 'worthwhile']",N/A
827261,ACYNN38Q2GEH6,B00028HBPM,Brent Peterson,"[0, 0]","Someone as talented as Piotr Anderszewski deserves better engineering on his DVD, and so do we, his customers.  First we have a menu system that takes us anywhere but where we want to go, namely the Diabelli Variations.  Secondly, the first time we see the menu, as well as each innumerable time we get bounced back to it--we get bombarded by the idiotic main theme of the Diabelli Variations, which you may agree does not lend itself to so many repeated hearings.Thirdly, Anderszewski gives extended commentary in English, and with all respect his English is not very good.  It's very hard to understand.  (Piano virtuosity and English skills do not necessarily go hand-in-hand.)  But who cares, that is not the problem.  The problem is, someone in the chain of command apparently decided it might hurt Anderszewski's feelings to have English subtitles displayed WHILE he is (supposedly) speaking English.  Therefore they provided subtitles in every language OTHER than English.  Why are we so fortunate?  I would like to hold up as an example the great Dutch conductor Ton Koopman.  He also chooses to speak English in his Bach Cantatas DVD (for what reason I do not know), and is almost completely unintelligible.  Thankfully, however, English subtitles are given for Koopman.  So what is the big deal?  Why not for this gentleman as well?  It is nothing against Anderszewski at all, quite the opposite--I DO want to hear his insights!Fourthly, when we finally decide to dispense with the menu, which is inevitable, and try to get to the Diabelli Variations using the good-old Fast Forward or Next-Next-Next method on the remote ... not even that method works satisfactorily.  We don't know exactly what stop they begin on, and in fact, they begin not with a scene of the artist sitting at the piano with his hands poised over the keyboard, but rather, with a view of the control room with an engineer tending knobs and dials.In short, there's so many problems getting the show on the road, it just kills the mood.  The user could simply give up in disgust--as I did on three different occasions.After so many attempts I did finally get the show going (the actual music, I mean).  And yes, it was OK.  I do not have any complaints about his playing.  It was brilliant in fact.  I might say the piano was too brassy in the midrange, but it's a Steinway so I can't say much about that, and anyway, I'm pretty sure it's the actual sound of the piano, not the sound engineer's fault.Alas, the DVD would get 5 stars if it were engineered decently.",1,Needs serious improvement in user-friendly design issues,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,2545,"['Someone', 'as', 'talented', 'Piotr', 'Anderszewski', 'better', 'engineering', 'DVD', 'so', 'do', 'customers', 'First', 'have', 'menu', 'system', 'anywhere', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'namely', 'Diabelli', 'Variations', 'Secondly', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'menu', 'as', 'well', 'innumerable', 'time', 'get', 'bounced', 'back', 'get', 'bombarded', 'idiotic', 'main', 'theme', 'Diabelli', 'Variations', 'may', 'agree', 'not', 'lend', 'so', 'many', 'repeated', 'hearings.Thirdly', 'Anderszewski', 'extended', 'commentary', 'English', 'respect', 'English', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'hard', 'understand', 'Piano', 'virtuosity', 'English', 'skills', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'who', 'not', 'problem', 'problem', 'someone', 'chain', 'command', 'apparently', 'decided', 'might', 'hurt', 'Anderszewski', 'feelings', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'displayed', 'supposedly', 'speaking', 'English', 'provided', 'subtitles', 'language', 'OTHER', 'English', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'fortunate', 'would', 'like', 'hold', 'up', 'example', 'great', 'Dutch', 'conductor', 'Ton', 'Koopman', 'also', 'speak', 'English', 'Bach', 'Cantatas', 'DVD', 'what', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'almost', 'completely', 'unintelligible', 'Thankfully', 'however', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'given', 'Koopman', 'So', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Why', 'not', 'gentleman', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'Anderszewski', 'opposite', 'DO', 'want', 'hear', 'insights', 'Fourthly', 'when', 'finally', 'decide', 'dispense', 'menu', 'inevitable', 'try', 'get', 'Diabelli', 'Variations', 'using', 'good-old', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'Next-Next-Next', 'method', 'remote', 'not', 'even', 'method', 'satisfactorily', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'stop', 'begin', 'fact', 'begin', 'not', 'scene', 'artist', 'sitting', 'piano', 'hands', 'poised', 'keyboard', 'rather', 'view', 'control', 'room', 'engineer', 'tending', 'knobs', 'dials.In', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'getting', 'show', 'road', 'just', 'mood', 'user', 'could', 'simply', 'give', 'up', 'disgust', 'did', 'three', 'different', 'occasions.After', 'so', 'many', 'attempts', 'did', 'finally', 'get', 'show', 'going', 'actual', 'music', 'mean', 'yes', 'was', 'OK', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'complaints', 'playing', 'was', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'might', 'say', 'piano', 'was', 'too', 'brassy', 'midrange', 'Steinway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'actual', 'sound', 'piano', 'not', 'sound', 'engineer', 'fault.Alas', 'DVD', 'would', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'engineered', 'decently']",N/A
827262,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B00028HBPM,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This issue comes with an interesting and relevant history which may help purchasers to decide if it is for them.In 1990 the young and unknown Anderszewski chose to play this work at the prestigious Leeds Piano competition. It was a most unusual choice as the work is seen as dangerously difficult to perform on both a technical and intellectual level. His performance was greatly admired and he was chosen to go through to the finals whereupon he withdrew. Subsequently several recording companies made the unusual step of approaching him to make a recording which he refused on the grounds that he was not ready. Young, unknown pianists do not usually behave like this. This recording was made for his CD issue 9 years later and was also recorded at the same time for DVD release as here.Anderszewski is clearly a man without compromise and that comes over strongly in this set of variations. They are characterised by scrupulous attention to detail, clarity of articulation and above all, high contrast. The theme and the first variation may seem immediately to be almost aggressive but conversely the following two variations are marked by sensitivity and gentleness. All is played with complete clarity and a strong rhythmical control. Thus the character of the performance is established from the start.Each variation is briefly labelled on screen with Beethoven's instructions as regards tempo and mood. These are followed precisely but also in such a way as to heighten contrast. So we get an extreme range from loud to soft, fast to slow, aggression to sensitivity and all with clarity of delivery and rhythm throughout.This is not easy listening but Beethoven was not writing salon music here. Responses are likely to be mixed and strongly held. It reminds me of his coupling of Beethoven's first piano concerto with some bagatelles where The Gramophone admired his bagatelles but found the concerto to be too aggressive for enjoyment. The BBC magazine took precisely the opposite line but for the same reasons - admiration for the concerto and dislike of the bagatelles.What is not in doubt is the quality of the recording with fine DTS sound and crisp imaging which gives good detail without being invasive. There is no attempt to disguise the studio setting of the recording but the variations follow seamlessly as in a real performance.The interesting extra bonus film is in the form of an interview with the pianist in which he gives his impassioned analysis of the work.In the end it will be a personal matter as to whether or not you will like these variations. You may either find them too aggressive or completely inspirational, hence the one missing star to allow for such variation.",4,"Outstanding for me, but this may be too forthright for some",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,2702,"['issue', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'history', 'may', 'help', 'purchasers', 'decide', 'them.In', '1990', 'young', 'unknown', 'Anderszewski', 'chose', 'play', 'work', 'prestigious', 'Leeds', 'Piano', 'competition', 'was', 'most', 'unusual', 'choice', 'work', 'seen', 'dangerously', 'difficult', 'perform', 'technical', 'intellectual', 'level', 'performance', 'was', 'greatly', 'admired', 'was', 'chosen', 'go', 'finals', 'withdrew', 'Subsequently', 'several', 'recording', 'companies', 'made', 'unusual', 'step', 'approaching', 'make', 'recording', 'refused', 'grounds', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'Young', 'unknown', 'pianists', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'behave', 'recording', 'was', 'made', 'CD', 'issue', '9', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'also', 'recorded', 'same', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'here.Anderszewski', 'clearly', 'man', 'compromise', 'over', 'strongly', 'set', 'variations', 'are', 'characterised', 'scrupulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'clarity', 'articulation', 'high', 'contrast', 'theme', 'first', 'variation', 'may', 'seem', 'immediately', 'be', 'almost', 'aggressive', 'conversely', 'following', 'two', 'variations', 'are', 'marked', 'sensitivity', 'gentleness', 'played', 'complete', 'clarity', 'strong', 'rhythmical', 'control', 'Thus', 'character', 'performance', 'established', 'start.Each', 'variation', 'briefly', 'labelled', 'screen', 'Beethoven', 'instructions', 'regards', 'tempo', 'mood', 'are', 'followed', 'precisely', 'also', 'such', 'way', 'heighten', 'contrast', 'get', 'extreme', 'range', 'loud', 'soft', 'fast', 'slow', 'aggression', 'sensitivity', 'clarity', 'delivery', 'rhythm', 'throughout.This', 'not', 'easy', 'listening', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'not', 'writing', 'salon', 'music', 'here', 'Responses', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'mixed', 'strongly', 'held', 'coupling', 'Beethoven', 'first', 'piano', 'concerto', 'bagatelles', 'where', 'Gramophone', 'admired', 'bagatelles', 'found', 'concerto', 'be', 'too', 'aggressive', 'enjoyment', 'BBC', 'magazine', 'took', 'precisely', 'opposite', 'line', 'same', 'reasons', 'admiration', 'concerto', 'dislike', 'bagatelles.What', 'not', 'doubt', 'quality', 'recording', 'fine', 'DTS', 'sound', 'crisp', 'imaging', 'good', 'detail', 'being', 'invasive', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'studio', 'setting', 'recording', 'variations', 'follow', 'seamlessly', 'real', 'performance.The', 'interesting', 'extra', 'bonus', 'film', 'form', 'interview', 'pianist', 'impassioned', 'analysis', 'work.In', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'personal', 'matter', 'not', 'will', 'like', 'variations', 'may', 'either', 'find', 'too', 'aggressive', 'completely', 'inspirational', 'hence', 'one', 'missing', 'star', 'allow', 'such', 'variation']",N/A

Martinez-Ybor ""Ignacio Martnez-Ybor""","[5, 5]","This is an extract of an email I sent a friend when this item was first issued on VHS:""Have you seen or listened the video of Piotr Andrezewski doing the Diabelli? It's quite good..... and the video (dir. by Bruno Monsaingeon and distributed by VAI) gives him the opportunity to introduce and illustrate the music before his uninterrupted, captivating performance of the piece. There is a very clever spot where, to suggest connections between the Diabelli and other late Beethoven, Piotr begins to play a contrapuntal passage from the Missa Solemnis on the piano ..... beautifully transcribed.... (I bet some more of it could be structured as a piano transcription, akin to Lizst's views on the symphonies..) Imperceptibly at first, the orchestra/chorus parts gradually come in on the appropriate piano lines, with the audio mix first emphasizing the piano and finally allowing the piano to be absorbed by the glorious, fully realized score ..... It's a gem...... and speaks volumes on the quality of this video.Andrezewski's introduction to the piece is intelligent, keen and accessible. He is most charming and articulate, whether in English or French, in and out of both, properly subtitled for English only speakers. The performance of the Diabelli is masterful....much thought and study have obviously gone into it, yet passion, poetry and wit are not compromised. The Diabelli is a difficult piece to put accross.

827264,A2HR0IL3TC4CKL,B00028HBPM,"scarecrow ""scarecrow""","[7, 9]","Seeing the performance of the Variations/Transformations here on Diabelli's quaint little naive tune that Beethoven turned,transformed,transmogrified into a great piece of art is an astonishment, greater astonishment still, well creating art is in the performance/interpretation of it.Prior to the uninterrupted performance Anderszewski speaks well of this work in truly basic commonplace ideas,but excitement is a pre-requisite on this ""voyage"" as he says, that it is a 'transformation', the subtitle of the music, ""these are not variations"" he says ""but transformations"".A word I liked that he used was ""tortured"", it shows a perverse side to the great Master Signifier, that darkness is there someplace, our job is to discover it, and Anderszewski I don't think does, he seems to float above the work, the playing doesn't seem to come from a deep place,perhaps modernity has done this to what is very old music, as Hegel said someplace, anything that cannot be understood today, ceases to exist, and we can never know what Beethoven thought,what's the context of the work, well that it speaks forever? even if we enter this ""phanthom"" world that music transports one across borders conceptual boundaries and time. Anderszewski certainly also makes this piece of art his own, he has a third person like presence in his playing,there doesn't seem to be a ""voice"" inside directing the proceeedings, and perhaps this is not always the best approach; like he is really not even there, there is less a dimension of conviction,and in Beethoven that is difficult to eradicate.For all Beethoven represented was conviction of purpose to art,to music to the ""IDEA"" working it through, the state of ""Becoming"" I think Anderszewski likes the more ""floating"" schwebend"", moments of this set, flying away. His tone is brittle,bright, strident and this at times could have been the piano timbre itself, where pains were takened to re-tune it and fix the gradations of eveness/uneven-ness in the timbre, ""like taming a beast"" said one technician. But there is a dimension of disquiet in the playing here, it is not the music, for I've heard Pollini,Rzewski,Brendel and Kempf play these ""transformations"".I think overall Anderszewski's playing lacks some part not all of the vision the piece is capable of suggesting, that's not his(Piotr's) fault, for such a large piece encompassing music, but something was lacking, obviously nothing technical,but imparting something ""else"" to the music not previously heard. When moments of power are required for example it seems to be only in the brightness of sound, not in gesture, for the gestures seem to be always the same.Then again balance is the magical key, for too much overbearing arrogant-ness doesn't work either.",4,like he is not there,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,2751,"['Seeing', 'performance', 'Variations/Transformations', 'here', 'Diabelli', 'quaint', 'little', 'naive', 'tune', 'Beethoven', 'turned', 'transformed', 'transmogrified', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'astonishment', 'greater', 'astonishment', 'still', 'well', 'creating', 'art', 'performance/interpretation', 'it.Prior', 'uninterrupted', 'performance', 'Anderszewski', 'well', 'work', 'truly', 'basic', 'commonplace', 'ideas', 'excitement', 'pre-requisite', 'voyage', ""'transformation"", 'subtitle', 'music', 'are', 'not', 'variations', 'transformations', '.A', 'word', 'liked', 'used', 'was', 'tortured', 'perverse', 'side', 'great', 'Master', 'Signifier', 'darkness', 'there', 'someplace', 'job', 'discover', 'Anderszewski', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'float', 'work', 'playing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'deep', 'place', 'perhaps', 'modernity', 'done', 'what', 'very', 'old', 'music', 'Hegel', 'said', 'someplace', 'anything', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'today', 'exist', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'Beethoven', 'thought', 'what', 'context', 'work', 'well', 'forever', 'even', 'enter', 'phanthom', 'world', 'music', 'one', 'across', 'borders', 'conceptual', 'boundaries', 'time', 'Anderszewski', 'certainly', 'also', 'piece', 'art', 'own', 'third', 'person', 'presence', 'playing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'voice', 'directing', 'proceeedings', 'perhaps', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'approach', 'really', 'not', 'even', 'there', 'less', 'dimension', 'conviction', 'Beethoven', 'difficult', 'eradicate.For', 'Beethoven', 'represented', 'was', 'conviction', 'purpose', 'art', 'music', 'IDEA', 'working', 'state', 'Becoming', 'think', 'Anderszewski', 'more', 'floating', 'schwebend', 'moments', 'set', 'flying', 'away', 'tone', 'brittle', 'bright', 'strident', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'piano', 'timbre', 'where', 'pains', 'were', 'takened', 're-tune', 'fix', 'gradations', 'eveness/uneven-ness', 'timbre', 'taming', 'beast', 'said', 'one', 'technician', 'dimension', 'disquiet', 'playing', 'here', 'not', 'music', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Pollini', 'Rzewski', 'Brendel', 'Kempf', 'play', 'transformations', '.I', 'think', 'overall', 'Anderszewski', 'playing', 'part', 'not', 'vision', 'piece', 'capable', 'suggesting', 'not', 'Piotr', 'fault', 'large', 'piece', 'encompassing', 'music', 'something', 'was', 'lacking', 'obviously', 'nothing', 'technical', 'imparting', 'something', 'else', 'music', 'not', 'previously', 'heard', 'When', 'moments', 'power', 'are', 'required', 'example', 'be', 'only', 'brightness', 'sound', 'not', 'gesture', 'gestures', 'seem', 'be', 'always', 'same.Then', 'again', 'balance', 'magical', 'key', 'too', 'much', 'overbearing', 'arrogant-ness', ""n't"", 'work', 'either']",N/A
