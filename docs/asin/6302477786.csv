He absolutely loved watching the bands of his youth and has watched them many times over (not to mention the delight in torturing his 15 year old daughter).  The audio's not bad, the filming is somewhat cut up....but it's better to see something of these past performers than nothing at all.  My husband is also 50 (I am 45) and we bought the set for ourselves too.

It is more of the same with the continuity of incredible performances. Of course, this one will have Elvis and The Beatles as usual. Probably the funniest are the impersonations. One amazing display of a feat is Gene Kelly's handle on Ed Sullivan. It has to be seen to believe.
