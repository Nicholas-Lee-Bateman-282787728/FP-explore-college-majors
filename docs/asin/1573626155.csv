190620,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,1573626155,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[15, 24]","I gave Part I of this miniseries two stars, and Part II isn't that much worse; maybe half as good. They had a great chance at the end of Part I which they didn't cash in on.  Joe Mantagna's daughter was all set up to  take over everything and become THE FIRST DONNA.  That's what I hoped would  happen in Part II.  No such luck.  The daughter becomes a  &quot;straight&quot; lawyer who learns to live with the idea that her  brother is an assassin.  It's her brother who becomes the &quot;last  don,&quot; but there's very little in the story to suggest why.  He's a  killer but not particularly ruthless.  He's a VERY slow thinker (or else an  actor who needs a lot of time to figure out how to move his facial  muscles).  I wondered about how they could feature Mantagna in Part II when  he was killed off in Part I.  This turned out to be, for me, the greatest  mystery in the miniseries! But they solved it in a humdrum manner--Mantagna  comes back in &quot;dream sequences&quot;!  Hot ziggedy, what a conception!  If you're looking to buy a DVD to watch this miniseries, here's a tip for  you.  Get the first one. It's about three times as long (running time) as  the second one. And since it's twice as good, you'll get your two-star's  money worth on THE LAST DON, PART I.  Of course, if after you see it you  disagree with everything I said about that movie in my review of it, then  go ahead and get PART II.  Now, isn't that an offer you can't refuse?",1,"The Last Don You'll Ever Need, Part II",964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,1461,"['gave', 'Part', 'miniseries', 'two', 'stars', 'Part', 'II', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'worse', 'maybe', 'half', 'good', 'had', 'great', 'chance', 'end', 'Part', 'did', ""n't"", 'cash', 'Joe', 'Mantagna', 'daughter', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'over', 'everything', 'become', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'DONNA', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'happen', 'Part', 'II', 'such', 'luck', 'daughter', 'quot', 'quot', 'lawyer', 'who', 'live', 'idea', 'brother', 'assassin', 'brother', 'who', 'quot', 'last', 'don', 'quot', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'suggest', 'why', 'killer', 'not', 'particularly', 'ruthless', 'VERY', 'slow', 'thinker', 'else', 'actor', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'move', 'facial', 'muscles', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'feature', 'Mantagna', 'Part', 'II', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'Part', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'greatest', 'mystery', 'miniseries', 'solved', 'humdrum', 'manner', 'Mantagna', 'back', 'quot', 'dream', 'sequences', 'quot', 'Hot', 'ziggedy', 'what', 'conception', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'here', 'tip', 'Get', 'first', 'one', 'three', 'times', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'second', 'one', 'twice', 'as', 'good', ""'ll"", 'get', 'two-star', 'money', 'worth', 'LAST', 'DON', 'PART', 'course', 'see', 'disagree', 'everything', 'said', 'movie', 'review', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'PART', 'II', 'Now', ""n't"", 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse']",N/A

Of course, he got dealt with in the end and got exactly what he deserved. Just terrible that they only found out at the end.

Although it wasn't quite the masterpiece that &quot;The Godfather&quot; was, I thought it was more true-to-life than the great classic.  &quot;The Last Don&quot; saga deals with the modern mafia, and the efforts of the head of the Clericuzio family to extricate his family from crime, and enter the legitimate world with his empire's wealth intact.Part 2 picks up exactly where Part 1 ends.  In my opinion Part 2 is quite watchable, and constitutes good entertainment.  It is not quite up to Part 1.  Certain segments of it seem over-acted and perhaps overly simplistic--it lacked the twists and surprises that made Part 1 such a delight.  Most of the time I felt that I knew exactly where Part 2 was taking us.Notwithstanding my criticisms, this is a very entertaining sequel.  Its portrayal of Hollywood is very funny, and there are certain components of the film that I frankly am surprised did not get someone sued.
