This is a different type of performance by Regina King whom plays a woman with no memory of an occurrence that slowly comes back.  This movie will teach and refresh the viewer that everyone and everything is not always what it seems to be.  I also like Jenna Van Oye shaking that big caboose. A different role for her that I saw on &#34;The Parkers&#34;.  I think Blair Underwood's acting could have been a bit better.

I am so sick of a good movie script being messed up by foul language, saying really nasty stuff out of their mouths.I wonder sometimes, where are these actors/ess parents. Even tho you are grown, you still have parents you have to answer to for the 'family image'. You can't go out and embarass the family with whatever you do in life.If this had been me and they gave me that script, I would have showed them how to compromise on the foul language, and make it much milder and better.  if not, I would not be able to do this movie because of my 'MORAL PRINCIPLES, AND MY FAMILY'S MORAL PRINCIPLES"".My Daddy always told us...'don't go out there and embarass me and this family' in whatever you do.  We all knew that, but we are from the south.  I find that people from the south had more moralistic principles to live by than people in the north or other parts of the country.Get mad if you want too, but I have run across much of this, and it has blown my mind.  In the south, parents don't care how old you are,50, 60, you are still their child, and they still have input into your life, if they see something you are doing is not good, or about to do.  They will also tell you, whatever you do in that movie, make sure that you don't embarrass us and yourself.I'm so glad I grew up like this, because it sure has played a big roll in my life, and I've seen it in some of the Black stars in movies, who talked about the same thing...my grandmother told me...my daddy said don't do this...my Mother told me not too do ....or she/they would be on the phone so fast raising hell with us.Thank God, some have kept their morals in tact. Many don't even know what morals, principles, or values are.

834918,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0002I84DU,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[59, 59]","Truth Be Told is probably the best movie you'll see from 2004. It has all the elements of a major suspense, action adventure that will leave you breathlessly waiting for the ending and once you get there...begging for more.Harris and Stratten ( Blair Underwood and Craig Sheffer ) are probably the two most crooked cops on the LAPD.  While planning to pick up their stash of mob money, they get a call about a massacre at the very bus station where they hid their loot. It looks like Stratten and Harris or done for if they don't find the money. Their fate lies in the hands of a beautiful young woman named Rayne, pronounced ' Rain ', played by the always fiesty and never disappointing Regina King.  Harris and Stratten cook up a plan to keep Rayne as close to them as possible while hiding her from whoever performed the bus stop masssacre. Stratten heads off with Rayne injured in the backseat of his car and from then on he slowly pumps her from any information she can share. She claims she doesn't remember a thing which angers Stratten but he must play her game in order to get what he needs. As the day goes on Stratten and Rayne form a bond that leads to love and romance.  By the time Stratten is head over heels in love with Rayne, Harris informs him of a major misconception about Rayne. Stratten is terribly disappointed and uses violence as a way to get back at her. Stratten's violence gets so out of hand he nearly rapes Rayne until she slowly forces him back into his senses and they realize they care deeply for each other. Stratten cares too much for Rayne to report his findings to Harris. He plans to run away with her, leaving Harris to handle the problems on his own. Meanwhile Harris is on a rampage to find the money and keep a major mob kingpin off his tail.Truth Be Told is a fast moving picture that snaps the mystery/suspense genre in half. I won't tell more because this film is full of so many surprises that if you spoil one you're bound to spoil the entire film.  Truth Be Told is probably the best film this year.  There aren't many that can take such an obvious storyline like stolen mob money and weave it into something Alfred Hitchcock would drool over.  The acting was superb.  Regina and Craig have amazing chemistry though Stratten's roughness (violence when he gets upset ) towards her at times may make their romance seem unreachable. Blair Underwood is amazing, reminding me of Denzel Washington's performance in Training Day. At times I couldn't help wondering if he was imitating Denzel but Underwood's acting can not be diminished. He's in a class of his own and proves with this feature film alone he belongs on the big screen. Supporting actress Monica Calhoun did well though her part could have been played by many more.If you want a great film that jerks your chain, this movie is for you.  If you're into strong sexuality ( without the sex ), dashing dialogue and a fast paced adventure, Truth Be Told will make all your dreams come true. Rarely does a film blow me away at all angles.  Truth Be Told out did itself entirely. You owe it to yourself to see it.",5,"Seduction, Mystery, Suspense, Action and Adventure in One!",1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,3113,"['Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', '2004', 'elements', 'major', 'suspense', 'action', 'adventure', 'will', 'leave', 'breathlessly', 'waiting', 'ending', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'begging', 'more.Harris', 'Stratten', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'crooked', 'cops', 'LAPD', 'planning', 'pick', 'up', 'stash', 'mob', 'money', 'get', 'call', 'massacre', 'very', 'bus', 'station', 'where', 'hid', 'loot', 'Stratten', 'Harris', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'money', 'fate', 'hands', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Rayne', 'pronounced', 'Rain', 'played', 'always', 'fiesty', 'never', 'disappointing', 'Regina', 'King', 'Harris', 'Stratten', 'cook', 'up', 'plan', 'keep', 'Rayne', 'close', 'possible', 'hiding', 'whoever', 'performed', 'bus', 'stop', 'masssacre', 'Stratten', 'Rayne', 'injured', 'backseat', 'car', 'then', 'slowly', 'information', 'can', 'share', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thing', 'angers', 'Stratten', 'must', 'play', 'game', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'day', 'Stratten', 'Rayne', 'form', 'bond', 'love', 'romance', 'time', 'Stratten', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'Rayne', 'Harris', 'major', 'misconception', 'Rayne', 'Stratten', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'violence', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'Stratten', 'violence', 'so', 'hand', 'nearly', 'Rayne', 'slowly', 'back', 'senses', 'realize', 'care', 'deeply', 'other', 'Stratten', 'too', 'much', 'Rayne', 'report', 'findings', 'Harris', 'run', 'away', 'leaving', 'Harris', 'handle', 'problems', 'own', 'Meanwhile', 'Harris', 'rampage', 'find', 'money', 'keep', 'major', 'mob', 'kingpin', 'off', 'tail.Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'fast', 'moving', 'picture', 'mystery/suspense', 'genre', 'half', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'film', 'full', 'so', 'many', 'surprises', 'spoil', 'one', ""'re"", 'bound', 'spoil', 'entire', 'film', 'Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'can', 'take', 'such', 'obvious', 'storyline', 'stolen', 'mob', 'money', 'weave', 'something', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'drool', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Regina', 'Craig', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'Stratten', 'roughness', 'violence', 'when', 'upset', 'times', 'may', 'make', 'romance', 'seem', 'unreachable', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'amazing', 'reminding', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'Training', 'Day', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'was', 'imitating', 'Denzel', 'Underwood', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'diminished', 'class', 'own', 'feature', 'film', 'alone', 'big', 'screen', 'Supporting', 'actress', 'Monica', 'Calhoun', 'did', 'well', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'many', 'more.If', 'want', 'great', 'film', 'chain', 'movie', ""'re"", 'strong', 'sexuality', 'sex', 'dashing', 'dialogue', 'fast', 'paced', 'adventure', 'Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'will', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'Rarely', 'film', 'away', 'angles', 'Truth', 'Be', 'Told', 'out', 'did', 'entirely', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see']",N/A
