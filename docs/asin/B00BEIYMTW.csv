I found some parts suggestive, for example.Now, that initial statement being made, I'll start my finish by saying I don't recommend it for adults, either.  Why?  Well, it's pretty childish.  ;-)  lol, no, seriously...  I found minimal growth in the characters, minimal challenge.  I appreciated the WWII reference, it was done with respect.  But Dusty seemed like the same fellow at the end that he was at the beginning.  I will add that I found it interesting to watch others change around him because of his good example.I bought this without watching it first, expecting it to be a lot more like Cars (either 1 or 2).  The same cute-ish concept of sentient machines was present, but at no point was I actually excited or drawn in to the story line.  It was sort of like opening a soda only to find that it's gone flat.For those of you who disagree with me, that's fine.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  For those of you who haven't seen it/are trying to decide whether or not to buy it, I've reviewed a few movies on Amazon.

As a matter of fact, I was bored to death....and totally amazed at how bad this movie was!Planes seems to parallel cars - yet is not nearly as cute, funny or memorable as Cars.  First of all... it's WAY TOO SERIOUS!!!  This movie is totally lacking any &#34;silly factor&#34;.  I know, I know...there's no Mater, of course.  But that's the problem.  This movie NEEDS a Mater!The character in Cars are literally oozing with personality...whereas in Planes, they're not.  They are just cookie-cutter clich&eacute;s of characters.  I never warmed up to any of them, since they were all totally forgettable.Plus....the plot?  This movie is just one big race...that's it!  That's it!  There's no warm and cozy Radiator Springs-like story to break up the tedious race sequences.Tedious.  That's the word I would apply to this movie.  What a terrible word!  I couldn't wait for the movie to end!  Now I have read that some toddlers and younger children enjoyed the movie, which I am very surprised to hear!  I would think they would have all been bored and fidgety - I know my daughter would have been at that age!  Although my daughter is a bit older, she still enjoys a good Disney movie.  However, after watching only a tiny slice of Planes, she lost interest and sought out the computer.I'm sorry.  I hate to give such a negative review, I really do.  However, these are my honest feelings.  The movie isn't funny, at all.  Okay, maybe you sort of chuckle a few times...but that's it!  As for the characters...I can't even remember any of them, and I just saw the movie last night!My advice?  Watch on Pay per View first to see if your kids are grabbed by this bland movie.

Exploit it by coming up with ways to expand on the concept to maximize the amount of money you can make from it. Disney took its &#34;Cars&#34; series into the sky with the Pixar-less &#34;Planes&#34; and instead of soaring high, the movie coasted along the lower atmosphere. With its release on Blu-ray and DVD, the film gets another chance to charm families in the comfort of their own homes.A crop-dusting plane named Rusty (Dane Cook) dreams of being a racer. There's only one problem with this: he's afraid of heights. A veteran fighter named Skipper takes Dusty under his wing and trains him to enter a prestigious race. Dusty's determination to participate in the event inspires his competitors to either love or hate him, leaving the outcome of the contest a mystery.&#34;Planes&#34; is presented in 1080p high-resolution at its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The picture is clean and the color palette makes each character and its surroundings pop out of the screen at you. Would we expect any less from the ever-resourceful Disney studios?The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound for &#34;Planes&#34; puts home viewers right in the middle of all the action. You'll be flying high on cloud nine as the sonic blasts of racing planes and the energetic soundtrack blend together to thrill the senses. Coupled with the exceptional animation, the stunning audio quality will complete a phenomenal family experience.The &#34;Planes&#34; Blu-ray comes with a few special features. It contains deleted scenes, one of which is a completed musical scene. There's also making-of and &#34;Meet the Racers&#34; featurettes. An educational featurette which counts down the top 10 real-life fliers rounds out the bonus material.Those expecting Pixar animation quality from &#34;Planes&#34; will no doubt be disappointed. It doesn't have the same essence and depth audiences have come to expect from the studio that brought us &#34;Cars,&#34; &#34;Toy Story,&#34; and &#34;The Incredibles.&#34; However, it will please the target demographic it was designed to. Parents might be disappointed in its presentation, but children won't notice the difference as they're captivated by the excitement on the screen.",4,"""Planes"" Takes ""Cars"" Franchise into the Sky on Blu-ray",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2355,"['34', 'Planes', '34', 'Takes', '34', 'Cars', '34', 'Franchise', 'Sky', 'Blu-rayIf', 'have', 'franchise', 'people', 'love', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'Exploit', 'coming', 'up', 'ways', 'expand', 'concept', 'maximize', 'amount', 'money', 'can', 'make', 'Disney', 'took', '34', 'Cars', '34', 'series', 'sky', 'Pixar-less', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'instead', 'soaring', 'high', 'movie', 'coasted', 'lower', 'atmosphere', 'release', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'film', 'chance', 'charm', 'families', 'comfort', 'own', 'homes.A', 'crop-dusting', 'plane', 'named', 'Rusty', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'dreams', 'being', 'racer', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'afraid', 'heights', 'veteran', 'fighter', 'named', 'Skipper', 'Dusty', 'wing', 'enter', 'prestigious', 'race', 'Dusty', 'determination', 'participate', 'event', 'competitors', 'love', 'hate', 'leaving', 'outcome', 'contest', 'mystery.', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'high-resolution', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'picture', 'clean', 'color', 'palette', 'character', 'surroundings', 'pop', 'screen', 'Would', 'expect', 'less', 'ever-resourceful', 'Disney', 'studios', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '7.1', 'sound', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'home', 'viewers', 'right', 'middle', 'action', ""'ll"", 'be', 'flying', 'high', 'cloud', 'nine', 'sonic', 'blasts', 'racing', 'planes', 'energetic', 'soundtrack', 'blend', 'together', 'thrill', 'senses', 'Coupled', 'exceptional', 'animation', 'stunning', 'audio', 'quality', 'will', 'complete', 'phenomenal', 'family', 'experience.The', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'Blu-ray', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'completed', 'musical', 'scene', 'also', 'making-of', '34', 'Meet', 'Racers', '34', 'featurettes', 'educational', 'featurette', 'down', 'top', '10', 'real-life', 'fliers', 'out', 'bonus', 'material.Those', 'expecting', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'quality', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'essence', 'depth', 'audiences', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'studio', 'brought', '34', 'Cars', '34', '34', 'Toy', 'Story', '34', '34', 'Incredibles.', '34', 'However', 'will', 'please', 'target', 'demographic', 'was', 'designed', 'Parents', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'presentation', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'difference', ""'re"", 'captivated', 'excitement', 'screen']",N/A

1630628,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYMTW,FNDNreview,"[20, 50]","Disney's production company, Pixar, has found a great deal of success with their popular Cars franchise, combining for more than $1 billion worldwide. It has featured the voices of some of Hollywood's finest and funniest, including Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and Michael Caine.  Following two successful animated features, Cars and Cars 2, the franchise has also spawned spin-off television programs, video games, and even theme park attractions.  Like most things associated with Disney, the merchandise possibilities are endless for animated features and with the addition of more vehicles - so is the direction of the franchise.  Now, the Cars franchise has expanded its potential by adding Planes - a Cars spin-off that focuses on animated planes as the main characters.Klay Hall (Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure) directs the Cars spin-off, Planes, starring the voice of Dane Cook as Dusty Crophopper, a crop dusting airplane that tries out for the Wings Across the World race.  In order to win the race, planes are required to be fast and agile - and able to work through an obstacle course at high speeds.  However, even though Dusty is fast, he's not fast enough and must enlist the help of a former war veteran, Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), to mentor and prepare him for the big race.  The voices of Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Roger Craig Smith, and Julia Louise-Dreyfus also star in supporting roles.The idea of animated cars only seemed logical, especially since bugs, toys, and anything else you can imagine is receiving the animation treatment.  With that rational, the next logical step was to expand the cars universe by adding planes to the mix.  And, after watching Planes, you'd assume future films will include trains, boats, or bikes.  Like I said, the future is endless.  But, before we get that far ahead, the focus is on Planes, which is essentially the same exact thing as the Cars films - only in plane form.  The Cars films are about racing, and Planes is about racing, too.  So, if you were to combine the elements of the first two Cars films and set it in the air, then that would make Planes a completely recycle story - which it is.Even from the debut of its first trailer, Planes looked like it had the potential to run out of gas even before it made its way off the runway.  Sure enough, Planes looks and smells like every generic animated film out there these days, incorporating the same old underdog elements and sideline cheerleaders.  On top of the constant clich&eacute;s is the fact that animation films focusing on the premise of racing are simply getting old.  Cars and its sequel focused on speed, not to mention Turbo - so it might be a stretch to imagine a Planes sequel focusing on a similar theme of the same generic story.  It's certainly time for them to think outside the box and come up with something a little more hip and entertaining.The supporting cast this time around includes forklifts and airplanes with different nationalities, meaning there are Spanish, British, and several other themed planes to round out the worldwide ethnicity race around the world.  Some of the familiar voices of this film include Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a French Canadian racing plane, Carlos Alazraqui as a lovesick Spanish plane (that is decked out like a Mexican wrestler), and Brad Garrett of Everybody Love Raymond fame as Dusty's main sidekick.  Sadly, none of these characters are remotely interesting, humorous, or worthy of living on in the folklore of animation fame.Overall, there aren't very many interesting things to say about this animated spin-off.  Planes simply doesn't make an effort to stand out against a crowed group of animated features, including Despicable Me 2 and Turbo - all of which are desperate to gain the attention of parents.  Dane Cook is certainly an interesting choice for a leading role, and actually excels in the position, but a weak supporting cast and a one-dimensional, predictable story will barely entertain the kids.  You'll be making a better choice if you just pop the Cars DVD in at home and wait for Planes to hit video.GRADE: D+FNDNreview.com",1,'Disney's Planes' never gets off the ground,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,4136,"['Disney', 'production', 'company', 'Pixar', 'found', 'great', 'deal', 'success', 'popular', 'Cars', 'franchise', 'combining', 'more', '1', 'billion', 'worldwide', 'featured', 'voices', 'Hollywood', 'finest', 'funniest', 'including', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Following', 'two', 'successful', 'animated', 'features', 'Cars', 'Cars', '2', 'franchise', 'also', 'spawned', 'spin-off', 'television', 'programs', 'video', 'games', 'even', 'theme', 'park', 'attractions', 'most', 'things', 'associated', 'Disney', 'merchandise', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'animated', 'features', 'addition', 'more', 'vehicles', 'so', 'direction', 'franchise', 'Now', 'Cars', 'franchise', 'expanded', 'potential', 'adding', 'Planes', 'Cars', 'spin-off', 'animated', 'planes', 'main', 'characters.Klay', 'Hall', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'Lost', 'Treasure', 'Cars', 'spin-off', 'Planes', 'starring', 'voice', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Dusty', 'Crophopper', 'crop', 'dusting', 'airplane', 'out', 'Wings', 'World', 'race', 'order', 'win', 'race', 'planes', 'are', 'required', 'be', 'fast', 'agile', 'able', 'work', 'obstacle', 'course', 'high', 'speeds', 'However', 'even', 'Dusty', 'fast', 'not', 'fast', 'enough', 'must', 'enlist', 'help', 'former', 'war', 'veteran', 'Skipper', 'Riley', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'mentor', 'prepare', 'big', 'race', 'voices', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Roger', 'Craig', 'Smith', 'Julia', 'Louise-Dreyfus', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'idea', 'animated', 'cars', 'only', 'seemed', 'logical', 'especially', 'bugs', 'toys', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'imagine', 'receiving', 'animation', 'treatment', 'rational', 'next', 'logical', 'step', 'was', 'expand', 'cars', 'universe', 'adding', 'planes', 'mix', 'watching', 'Planes', ""'d"", 'assume', 'future', 'films', 'will', 'include', 'trains', 'boats', 'bikes', 'said', 'future', 'endless', 'get', 'far', 'ahead', 'focus', 'Planes', 'essentially', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'Cars', 'films', 'only', 'plane', 'form', 'Cars', 'films', 'are', 'racing', 'Planes', 'racing', 'too', 'So', 'were', 'combine', 'elements', 'first', 'two', 'Cars', 'films', 'set', 'air', 'then', 'would', 'make', 'Planes', 'completely', 'recycle', 'story', 'is.Even', 'debut', 'first', 'trailer', 'Planes', 'looked', 'had', 'potential', 'run', 'out', 'gas', 'even', 'made', 'way', 'runway', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Planes', 'smells', 'generic', 'animated', 'film', 'there', 'days', 'incorporating', 'same', 'old', 'underdog', 'elements', 'sideline', 'cheerleaders', 'top', 'constant', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fact', 'animation', 'films', 'focusing', 'premise', 'racing', 'are', 'simply', 'getting', 'old', 'Cars', 'sequel', 'focused', 'speed', 'not', 'mention', 'Turbo', 'might', 'be', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'Planes', 'sequel', 'focusing', 'similar', 'theme', 'same', 'generic', 'story', 'certainly', 'time', 'think', 'box', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'hip', 'entertaining.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'time', 'around', 'forklifts', 'airplanes', 'different', 'nationalities', 'meaning', 'are', 'Spanish', 'British', 'several', 'other', 'themed', 'planes', 'round', 'out', 'worldwide', 'ethnicity', 'race', 'world', 'familiar', 'voices', 'film', 'include', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'French', 'Canadian', 'racing', 'plane', 'Carlos', 'Alazraqui', 'lovesick', 'Spanish', 'plane', 'decked', 'out', 'Mexican', 'wrestler', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Everybody', 'Love', 'Raymond', 'fame', 'Dusty', 'main', 'sidekick', 'Sadly', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'worthy', 'living', 'folklore', 'animation', 'fame.Overall', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'animated', 'spin-off', 'Planes', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'stand', 'out', 'crowed', 'group', 'animated', 'features', 'including', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'Turbo', 'are', 'desperate', 'gain', 'attention', 'parents', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'choice', 'leading', 'role', 'actually', 'excels', 'position', 'weak', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one-dimensional', 'predictable', 'story', 'will', 'barely', 'entertain', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'be', 'making', 'better', 'choice', 'just', 'pop', 'Cars', 'DVD', 'home', 'wait', 'Planes', 'hit', 'video.GRADE', 'D+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

Dusty Crophopper desires to be more than what his original purpose was.  He wishes to enter an around-the-world race that usually is reserved for planes that are built for racing.  When he manages to make the cut, he has to deal with the prejudices of being a &#34;farm boy.&#34;  Aside from the challenges he faces from the difficult race and his fear of heights (imagine a plane afraid of heights), he also has to put up with the dirty trickery from other racers who don't play fair.  However, he has old and new friends helping him out:  the grounded Skipper (a war hero who suffers post traumatic stress), Dusty's best friend Chug (forgetful and big-mouthed), the nerdy girl whose name I've forgotten but is just as endearing, and the Spanish plane whose name I've also forgotten.  The characters are memorable...the names aren't.In many ways, I like this story better than Cars.  It is more exciting and adventurous, since it shows the various obstacles Dusty has to face traveling around the world.  Dusty is a much more likable character than Lightening McQueen was.

We could only wish. Pixar produced films with superior technical qualities, but was best known for finely crafted stories that appealed to young and old alike. Planes displays great computer animation, but has a hit-and-miss story that appeals to children while leaving adults largely out of the fun.The story revolves around Dusty, a crop dusting plane who wants to be an air racer, and he gets his chance to compete in a round-the-world race against champions from many nations. This allows for not only slightly exotic character development, but for great displays of scenery as well. The settings are familiar from Cars, (a rural backwater community, inhabited by rubes and relics), as are the sidekicks (numerous small forklifts as workers, a not-so-bright truck as a friend, and an experienced old timer as a mentor). There is one sly reference to the tractor-tipping scene in Cars, as Dusty the crop duster is sightseeing in India. He comments on the many tractors wandering the landscape below, and his Indian companion says ""they are sacred in our country"".Although lacking the subtlety and storyline depth of Pixar's best, the three and four year-olds I watched this film with thought it was fascinating. It was colorful, fast moving, and flew literally around the world with plenty of moments of beauty and peril that kept the kids on the edge of their seats. So for the small ones in your life I rate this one four out of five.

I sat there watching it just waiting for it to &#34;take off&#34; (pun intended). It started out too slow and never really got that exciting.

I did enjoy 'Planes' at all. I mean, it's not even a Pixar film! It's a Disney film, but not from Disney Animations or Pixar, it's from Disneytoons! A studio that works for Disney and makes DIRECT TO DVD movies off of Disney's already existing products. And that's what they were doing with 'Planes' until a test screening impressed Disney enough to move it to the theater instead of direct to DVD. I can't see why it ever made it to the cinema. It's not worthy of being seen by theater patron's. To be honest I didn't much care for 'Cars' which this spin off is based on. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. However the film had enough charm and heart to redeem itself as still worthy to carry Pixar's name... 'Planes' has neither enough charm, heart, or anything actually. My review of 'Planes'.'Planes' tells the tale of Dusty Crophopper (originally voiced by Jon Cryer, but at the last minute was replaced by comedian Dane Cook) a crop-duster in the small town of Radiator Springs- no I mean another small town called Propwash Junction, a place that lays in the middle of nowhere. Dusty dreams of flying in races practicing every night, hoping that one day he'd be good enough to compete in the Wings Around the Globe Competition. This year he decides to try and qualify for the competition. Falling short of qualifying, after another racer is axed, Dusty is allowed to move up a position and qualifies for the Wings Competition. Dusty now must conquer his fear of heights, and fly, fly, fly with the help of a retired war veteran (Stacy Keach) and his friends.Yawn, yawn, yawn. Been there, seen that. This is your average kiddie fair. The script is dumbed down, predictable, and very unfunny. Not to mention the film is almost a complete replica of the far superior 'Cars', just switched around the main characters from cars to planes. About ten minutes into the film I knew everything that was going to happen. Nothing about the film surprises me, or delights me. The film can be seen as made for children, but I doubt even them will get much out of this. The jokes, are seen, you know they're there but they just aren't funny. The dialogue is somewhat laughable, and clich&eacute;.The animation is below-par. It's sad; it's rough and seems to have been done by a bunch of people straight out of college. I mean, when you compare the animation of 'Planes' to that of any other Pixar or Disney film, you can tell 'Planes' animation is by far worse. However, I must express my admiration for the flying sequences, that seem to be done with ease... well some of them anyways. Some of them just don't look good, while others do.Character wise, you don't relate to, or care for anybody. Our lead, Dusty Crophopper, is just so bland and uninspired, without any real motivation for anything. He's just unrelatable, and boring. The rest of the competitors are mostly stereotypes of different cultures. The only character you can even feel for is Skipper, but even his story is underwhelming.Voice cast wise, 'Cars' had the upper hand, but 'Planes' didn't do that bad itself. 'Dane Cook' is fine as Dusty, no matter how bad his dialogue is. 'Stacy Keach' basically mimic's 'Paul Newman's' voice as Doc from 'Cars'. The other competitor's vocals are good enough to portray the characters stereotypes in their respective cultures.All and All 'Planes' try's to soar but crashes. Its predictable, unfunny, and almost a replica of 'Cars'. Adults will hardly be able to manage sitting through it, and while small children will enjoy it, most anybody else may not. D 4/22/14'Planes' is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. It's appropriate for kids 5 and up. However I doubt anybody over 10 will be willing to watch this one.",2,Good for kids...

But Dusty's has some issues in regards to racing and so he turns to a seasoned naval aviator who helps Dusty qualify to take on the defending champ of the race circuit.Although kind of a rehash of the Cars story and similar in ways to the Turbo movie that was released this past year, Planes has its moments and although maybe not as fun for Adults is a great fun time for kids.  The plot is something we have seen before with Dusty as a typical fish out of water with big dreams whose fatal flaw is an inconvenient fear of extreme heights and the movie depicting the the ups and downs of Dusty as he has to deal with his devious foes, a girl plane he has a crush on, low fuel, bad weather and mechanical difficulties. And like Cars, he has a crew of sidekicks including slow-witted fuel truck Chug (Brad Garrett), no-nonsense mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), a Navy Corsair who flew in World War II.  Although some of the characters are a bit stereo-typical, there are some funny moments, especially with El Chupacabra's attempts to woo his French competitor.Even with this not being terribly original, youngsters especially under 10 or so will love this movie and find it entertaining and has a decent lesson for kids to learn as well.",3,Definately not cars but fun for kids,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,1366,"['Planes', 'movie', 'Dusty', 'who', 'plane', 'dreams', 'competing', 'high-flying', 'air', 'racer', 'Dusty', 'issues', 'regards', 'racing', 'so', 'seasoned', 'naval', 'aviator', 'who', 'Dusty', 'qualify', 'take', 'defending', 'champ', 'race', 'circuit.Although', 'kind', 'rehash', 'Cars', 'story', 'similar', 'ways', 'Turbo', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'past', 'year', 'Planes', 'moments', 'maybe', 'not', 'fun', 'Adults', 'great', 'fun', 'time', 'kids', 'plot', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'Dusty', 'typical', 'fish', 'water', 'big', 'dreams', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'inconvenient', 'fear', 'extreme', 'heights', 'movie', 'depicting', 'ups', 'downs', 'Dusty', 'deal', 'devious', 'foes', 'girl', 'plane', 'crush', 'low', 'fuel', 'bad', 'weather', 'mechanical', 'difficulties', 'Cars', 'crew', 'sidekicks', 'including', 'slow-witted', 'fuel', 'truck', 'Chug', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'no-nonsense', 'mechanic', 'Dottie', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Skipper', 'Riley', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Navy', 'Corsair', 'who', 'flew', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'stereo-typical', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'especially', 'El', 'Chupacabra', 'attempts', 'woo', 'French', 'competitor.Even', 'not', 'being', 'terribly', 'original', 'youngsters', 'especially', '10', 'so', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'find', 'entertaining', 'decent', 'lesson', 'kids', 'learn', 'as', 'well']",N/A

While the animation was beautiful as usual, the storyline and pacing of the film was terrible.

This is the first time that I couldn't finish a Pixar film and definitely the first time the kids decided that television wasn't worth watching (and they don't get to watch TV very often, so that's a big deal!).  The characters are forgettable and don't have any real defining or lovable qualities about them.  I really didn't care for the Dusty/Skipper dynamic either.  It really looked like Disney was trying to recapture a &#34;Lightning McQueen/Doc Hudson&#34; kind of companionship - something that just simply fell flat in Planes.  This was definitely one movie where it's better to buy the kids the toys first so they love their toys, then show them the movie...it's a hit or miss if the kids will like the film - mine certainly didn't.When it comes down to it, this was not the worse movie Disney has ever made, but it really isn't good.

It wasn't a movie about training to be good, it was a movie about giving your all. He didn't luck into fame like others in movies that meant to be &#34;inspirational&#34;, he fought for it.I did see the story-line with his trainer, a plan that only had one main flight. I didn't see him coming to the rescue in the fashion that he did. I give them snaps for surprising me on that.I wasn't a fan of how hard the male villain went to try and kill the main hero. In cars he only made one attempt and it wasn't huge. This evil plan was the definition of evil and sneaky, hands down.At the end, and this is the spoiler, I didn't like that he over came his fear of heights and that was his real reason for victory. He came so close to winning without overcoming that fear 100%, even with everything that he went through along the way. I felt like he either should have lost, but had a moral victory like in Cars 1, or that he should have won without having to fly high into the sky.

We brought our family gear (chairs, blankets, etc.) and had an amazing spot, loaded up the popcorn, soda, and other must have movie snacks, and waited for the movie to start. When it did, expectations were high, I was ready for fun, for laughter, and even some light hearted excitement. I did not get that feeling in the beginning or the end of the movie. In fact, I did not get to experience any of those feelings in the intensity I thought I would. I love the whole Disney universe today - Pixar makes such amazing movies that are truly moving and unforgettable. As many have probably mentioned in reviews for this movie, it felt a lot like a sloppy version on cars with wings. What I didn't like was that this was another underdog story, that has a cast of characters that was too similar to the Cars Movie. The big difference is that in Cars, Lightning McQueen was already at the top and needed to win the Big race to get his Piston Cup win and new sponsership, but had lessons to learn. In this story, the main plane, Dusty, is essentially running through the same story line in respects to having to win ""the big race"", and having an old geezer mentor (like Doc in the movie Cars) that had a bad experience with flying in the war that brought him into a life a solitude and sourness, blah, blah. It was just too typical and didn't have anything distinguishable that made this movie special. The characters are forgettable, the story is just ok, and the feeling I had when the movie was over was ""that was disappointing"". Every other pixar film I have seen (pretty much all of them), I have bought the movie as soon as it came out for sale on video. This movie, not too sure I will have this in the collection. I would rather take my chances on a rent to see if this movie grows on me after a 2nd viewing.

Even the musicals and the music `within' type films are usually charming, entertaining and often enduring in a way. ""Planes"" takes a more than slight turn in the opposite direction.The film took a long time to get the characters interesting enough for me to care about them. The story of the underdog and his triumph, not anything new, became extremely predictable in this film. It wasn't until about 's the way I felt slight emotion for the underdog and his friends and the real adventure began.Directed by Klay Hall (Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure) and written by Jeffrey M Howard (Tinkerbell, Pixie Hollow Games) from a story from the original genius that made Pixar famous, John Lasseter (Toy Story, Wall*E), ""PLANES opens in a nose dive of a really long drawn out exposition of the underdog Dusty Crophopper voiced by Dane Cook (Mr. Brokks, Dan In Real Life).Some of the talent includes, the mentor of the film is voiced by Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legacy) as Skipper. Brad Garrett (Everyone Loves Raymond, Finding Nemo) voices Chug, the longtime companion of Dusty. Teri Hatcher (Lois & Clark, Desperate Housewives) voices Dottie who eventually becomes the love interest in a very unusual twist. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (A Bug's Life, Seinfeld) plays Rochelle and actual female baddie - who turns her heart by the end.By the way, this is supposed to be an almost crossover world as seen in the Cars movies, but it doesn't have the charm and power of keeping you attention in the beginning. I will admit, the last 20 minutes was touch and heartwarming - but again, it took over an hour to get to that point. Kids were wrestles in the theatre and the adults were walking out - too bad too - the best things were at the end of the film.Young, young kids should love the color and landscapes, but unfortunately older kids and adult won't find anything interesting until the film is almost over. To me this is a DVD/Blu-Ray rental type of film. I can only think that Disney is not thoroughly reading the scripts these days, the quality of story and character is dropping.

1630735,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00BEIYMTW,"Mike London ""MAC""","[8, 14]","""Planes"" finds Disney, and John Lasster in particular, revisiting the world of ""Cars"".  Lassiter, one of the masterminds of Pixar, came up with the original concept of ""Cars"" as well as ""Cars 2"".  Essentially, all the cars are anthropomorphic and are characters in their own right.In terms of critical reception, the ""Cars"" franchise has been the most problematic of the Pixar IPs.  While both critics and audiences alike really enjoyed the original ""Cars"", that picture marked the first time that a Pixar picture garnered less than glowing reviews.  To know where I stand as a reviewer, personally ""Cars"" is one of my personal favorite Pixar films, even though I never really liked Nascar.""Cars 2"", meanwhile, has been the worst received Pixar flick yet.  Mixing international intrigue (essentially James Bond in a cartoon setting with a redneck tow truck called Mater being the central focus of that particular plotline) with the original racing of the first ""Cars"", most critics and audiences alike felt ""Cars 2"" simply fell flat.Then we come to ""Planes"", the worst movie yet set in the franchise.  Plagued by a dull, by-rote script, a very predictably storyline, and low quality control, ""Planes"" is a very low flying picture, to put it lightly.  To be fair, DisneyToons produced ""Planes"", which is Disney's direct to DVD division.  Only after seeing some completed sequences did Disney chose to do a theatrical release.  However, you can easily tell this is a direct to DVD film, with all the lower quality control that Direct to DVD implies.Watching the movie you simply feel that they piecemealed it from the first two pictures, with the best elements stripped away.  ""Planes"" marries the race drama of the first ""Cars"" with the international [mixture] adventure of the second ""Cars"" with characters who are little more than painted caricatures of screen-writing archetypes.First: the animation.  There are some great sequences (especially those involving the scenic sections of the movie, such as the Taj Mahal and the mountains).  The battle sequence where we learn more of Skipper's character is simply stunning, and on the same level as the Pixar movies.  There is a great uneveness though, where some of the sequences (especially those with lots of cars) are bland and almost appear as unfinished.You also feel you've already seen these characters before.  For those who found Mater intolerable, the racers from different countries are little more than stereotypical caricatures painted with very broad strokes of cultural insensitivity.  We have a lover-boy Mexican who also is a musican, an uptight British plane, an erotically charged (toned down for a kid movie, obviously) French Canadian who speaks the ""language of love"", and a cheating villian that never rises above mere thug.Without giving away spoilers, Dusty Crophopper (a crop dusting plane) dreams of being a low-flying racer, and wants to enter a competiton called ""Wings Across the World"".  He enters the qualifying rounds and does not make it, but later is admitted due to one of the qualifiers cheating. Having been trained by Chug (a fuel truck voiced by Brad Garret, AKA Robert Barone from ""Everybody Loves Raymon""), both Dusty and Chug list the at-first hesitant Skipper, a World War II plane who fought various battles with the famed , whose motto is truth first.  However, mysteriously Skipper does not fly himself and hasn't for years.Once Dusty gets in the race, the movie simply turns into different segments of the race (of which there are seven), with different plot points being checked off.  During the movie, he assists various other planes in the race, and is met also with betrayal.  Due to his assistance with the various other racers, at one point they return the favors, setting Dusty up for the climactic finale.  He learns the reason for Skipper's grounding, and battles for first place with Ripslinger, his main archnemesis in the picture.While ""Cars"" was a homage to Nascar, the racing was only a small element in that movie.  ""Cars"" largely tapped into (brilliantly, I might add) that Route 66 culture of the 1950s-1970s, before the Interstates came in and travellers lost a lot of the scenic majesty of traveling through the United States and exploring the country that can only be done off the Interstate.  While the racing drama tied into ""Cars"" excellently, you cared more about McQueen and what he learned in his stay in Radatior Springs, as well as all the characters he encounters.  You care more about the outcome of the race because the race wasn't the only driving focus.  Lightening McQueen was egotistical; the citizens of Radiator Springs helped Lightening not only become a better ""car"", but also to appreciate a slower life-style.  The movie is much more about McQueen's growing relationships and growth as a character than it ever was about the race.Unfortunately, this focus on character growth never seems to take flight in ""Planes"", unlike ""Cars"", which ultimately means the film simply denegrates into spectacle in the racing sequences, following shallow, predictable plotpoints that never really elevate the film into the upper echelon of quality animation, as is the wont of the best of the Pixar/Disney films.While ""Cars"" used the race as a back drop for deeper story telling, ""Planes"" simply becomes a retreat of all those underdog stories.  Due to the longer running time of ""Cars"", we get to know the characters more.  In ""Planes"", the characters never rise above either ethnic stereotypes or dull characters we've all seen in so many other movies.  Ultimately, you by the end of the film you will probably care more for Skipper than anyone else, but by then it's too most likely too late.  Even Dusty Crophopper changes very little (with one minor exception dealing with his ""low flying"" tendencies"".  Compare Dusty's story arc to McQueen's story arc and Dusty comes away looking much the worst for wear.  We've seen Dusty's story arc so often in so many other movies that he is simply not compelling, and there is so little character evolution within Dusty that the film just falls flat, especially when compared to McQueen.Ultimatley, ""Planes"" becomes little more than a further ploy for Disney to create merchandise using the ""Cars"" brand.  Its Direct to DVD origins are ""planely""evident for everyone above five year olds to see, and had it stayed direct to dvd this film would not nearly have been as offensive as it is to fans of Pixar and Disney.  Unlike the best of Pixar/Disney, which appeal to young and old alike, only the youngest will find this film truly enjoy.  The rest will find it dull, predictable, and simply far below the mark previously set by ""Cars"" and even ""Cars 2"".",2,"Dull, trite, very uneven animation sequences in terms of

1630746,A84FLVDK2R5JF,B00BEIYMTW,"Nathan M. Rose ""Movie Guy from FlickDirect""","[3, 5]","High above the world of Cars comes a low-altitude spin-off that never quite takes off. That's right, three aviation puns in one sentence. And if that has you rolling your eyes, brace yourself for director Klay Hall's Planes, a well-intentioned family-friendly racer sure to entertain younger kids, and just the kids. There's nothing particularly terrible about the film, and it's certainly not as bad as you've probably heard. Still, the animation lacks the fresh coat of paint typical of most theatrically released CG-animated spectacles, Jeffrey M. Howard's screenplay relies heavily on familiar clich&eacute; after familiar clich&eacute; and, sorry to say, the voice cast isn't all that special. Not so surprising considering the pseudo-sequel began its life as a DisneyToon Studios direct-to-video project and was only later promoted to feature film status at the last minute. And yet Planes remains a decidedly direct-to-video adventure, with Hall and company distilling elements of Cars and Cars 2 into a cute, harmless, ultimately unremarkable underdog story most parents have sat through a hundred times before.When a crop duster with big dreams named Dusty (Dane Cook) defies all odds and narrowly qualifies for the globe-spanning Wings Across the World race, he finds himself jetting from New York to Iceland, Germany, India, Nepal, Shanghai, Mexico and back across the United States. To win, he'll have to out-maneuver and outrace an array of international fliers, including mean-spirited reigning champ, Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith), and his toadies, Ned and Zed (Gabriel Iglesias); French-Canadian racer, Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); stuffy Brit, Bulldog (John Cleese); passionate Mexican Gee Bee, El Chupacabra (Carols Alazraqui); and Indian love interest Ishani (Priyanka Chopra). And it'll take everything Dusty's got, along with a little help from his friends: best friend Chug (Brad Garrett), mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher), reluctant mentor Skipper Riley (Stacey Keach), forklift Sparky (Danny Mann), Super Hornet duo Bravo and Echo (Top Gun alumni Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards), and others who rally behind the crop-dusting upstart.Despite Hall and Howard's best efforts -- and the two do make a concerted effort -- there's not a lot to Planes that isn't derived from the series' core films. From the quaint but sharply penned Cars comes the clash of vehicular cultures and destinies, the racing scene, a fish out of water adventure, a romantic subplot, a crusty old racing mentor haunted by his past, a cocky rival desperate to win at all costs (he's even green and black, just like ol' Chick Hicks), several sidekicks in the making, and, of course, a glimpse into the eerie but amusing world of sentient cars with no human masters. (Why is Dusty dusting crops exactly? Other than the fact that he's a crop duster?) From the maligned Cars 2 comes the international hotspots, a colorful cast of multinational racers (each one showcasing a bigger stereotype than the last), the thrills and chills of a worldwide race mixed with... you get the idea. Planes is at its finest when imagining how a society of planes would function in the larger Cars world, and when humanizing its aeros and autos. But sparks of imagination don't seem to come as freely or frequently as before, and Dustys rise to fame is far more derivative than it is original.Ironically, had Planes never dared to dream more than a direct-to-video dream, it would have been more successful. The film struggles to inflate itself to theatrical proportions, reaching for the stars and barely lifting off the ground. There are laughs to be had, an exciting but predictable race to follow, and enough lovable personalities -- yes, even Cook's Dusty -- to keep the movie in the air. It rarely soars, though, and even at its best, tends to skim the surface of its potential. Adults would do well to watch the disc's behind-the-scenes featurette, &#34;Klay's Flight Plan&#34;, and only then giving Planes a go. Realizing how much of the film a personal passion project was for Hall makes for a richer experience. The story still only skims the surface, but the heart it proudly wears on its wings suddenly begins to shine that much brighter. Kids, on the other hand, needn't invest any prep time. Planes will strike anyone under ten as a fun, wondrous race across the skies of one of their favorite animated universes; one with a few life lessons worth reinforcing. As family entertainment geared for the grade school set goes, it excels. As a Pixar spin-off, though, it lacks a certain level of magic, wit and refinement.Disney's Planes looks great on Blu-ray, with a pristine 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation. Colors are bright, vibrant and playful, and bathed in convincing light and shadow. Primaries are strong and black levels inky, with consistent contrast and unhindered clarity. Detail is quite striking, with crisp edges and exacting textures, and aliasing isn't a concern. Perhaps more thrilling is Planes' DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track, even if the film's original sound design isn't really all that engrossing. Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without anything in the way of muffled or buried lines. Voices tend to float in the mix, but no more so than in most animated films. LFE output, meanwhile, embraces every engine chug and roar, propeller drone, and dive-bomb attack, making the most of the adventure's every racing sequence.Planes would have been better off abandoning the racing scene of the first two Cars movies and focusing instead on something new to the series' universe. Private and commercial aviation, the Air Force, the daring rescue work glimpsed in the trailer for next year&#8217;s Planes: Fire & Rescue... just a few of the tantalizing possibilities that would have set Hall's spin-off free. Not that kids will care. Younger children will have a blast, if only because they won't notice just how much Planes begs, borrows and lifts from a hundred other underdog stories. Disney's Blu-ray release is more satisfying, fortunately, with an excellent video presentation and involving DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track. Its supplemental package is much too direct-to-video for a film that earned a theatrical release, but complaints end there. Bottom line? You could do a whole lot worse this holiday season. Planes is perfect for the kiddies, even if it will prove somewhat disappointing for parents.",3,Planes would have been better off abandoning the racing scene of the first two Cars movies and focusing

All you need to see is the logo to realize there isn't much to see that's new. A ridiculed dark horse makes his way to the big leagues, realizes he must change to continue the course, and with the help of his friends shows everyone who's the real winner. I'm beginning to wonder if a non-Pixar animated studio will be capable of releasing anything different for a few years (save for the HTTYD and CWACOM sequels).The similarities, or copies, of ideas in the Cars films were more annoying than engaging, because they didn't often develop past what Pixar did. There are only a few good reasons to see this film, and here is one: watch it to find and list all the references to concepts in Cars (such as a fuel aficionado).There is one concept that I enjoyed seeing developed, only because Cars 2 showed such a limited scope. This concept is travel, seeing the world, beautiful views and different cultures. Because the race is all around the world, you get to see many, many places, and the vehicles that live there. My absolute favorite was the German bar, so watch for it if you choose to view Planes.The dialogue was mostly geared towards children, with a few exceptions, and didn't have the dual charm (children and adults) that Pixar has mastered. Still, I laughed on occasion, and I've seen more embarrassing scripts.The animation was exactly what I expected. Slightly less precise than Cars 2, but only slightly. Where the movie excelled the most, in my opinion, was in the camera angles. They were an absolute treat throughout, despite it being an animated film. The 3D was good, but didn't have any scenes where it stood out.Here is one more good reason to see Planes: Dane Cook. Throughout the feature, his voice acting stood out as quite a talent to watch for in the future. As a side note, I didn't appreciate the John Ratzenberger cameo, as this wasn't a Pixar film, and he already has a character in the universe. Take it how you will.The only surprise that came to me was the ""ride into the sunset"" moment. I wasn't expecting a bold change, but it still happened. What came after the credits cleared it up, but didn't make me feel better. Planes: Fire and Rescue is a full-length sequel being planned with the same screenwriter. I'm more than a little disappointed they already approved it.In conclusion, this movie is great for kids, but adults can busy themselves counting the ""rip-offs"". See Planes for the beautiful camera angles, vehicular takes on cultures and landmarks, and Dane Cook, but expect little else to impress.",3,"Sadly, a Cars film composite, with a few redeeming points",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2613,"[""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'long', 'notice', 'Planes', 'watered-down', 'film', 'need', 'see', 'logo', 'realize', ""n't"", 'much', 'see', 'new', 'ridiculed', 'dark', 'horse', 'way', 'big', 'leagues', 'must', 'change', 'continue', 'course', 'help', 'friends', 'everyone', 'who', 'real', 'winner', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'wonder', 'non-Pixar', 'animated', 'studio', 'will', 'be', 'capable', 'releasing', 'anything', 'different', 'few', 'years', 'save', 'HTTYD', 'CWACOM', 'sequels', '.The', 'similarities', 'copies', 'ideas', 'Cars', 'films', 'were', 'more', 'annoying', 'engaging', 'did', ""n't"", 'often', 'develop', 'what', 'Pixar', 'did', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'good', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'here', 'one', 'watch', 'find', 'list', 'references', 'concepts', 'Cars', 'such', 'fuel', 'aficionado', 'one', 'concept', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'developed', 'only', 'Cars', '2', 'showed', 'limited', 'scope', 'concept', 'travel', 'seeing', 'world', 'beautiful', 'views', 'different', 'cultures', 'race', 'world', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'many', 'places', 'vehicles', 'live', 'there', 'My', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'was', 'German', 'bar', 'so', 'watch', 'choose', 'view', 'Planes.The', 'dialogue', 'was', 'mostly', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'few', 'exceptions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'dual', 'charm', 'children', 'adults', 'Pixar', 'mastered', 'Still', 'laughed', 'occasion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'embarrassing', 'scripts.The', 'animation', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'Slightly', 'less', 'precise', 'Cars', '2', 'only', 'slightly', 'Where', 'movie', 'excelled', 'most', 'opinion', 'was', 'camera', 'were', 'absolute', 'treat', 'being', 'animated', 'film', '3D', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'scenes', 'where', 'stood', 'out.Here', 'one', 'more', 'good', 'reason', 'see', 'Planes', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'feature', 'voice', 'acting', 'stood', 'out', 'quite', 'talent', 'watch', 'future', 'side', 'note', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'cameo', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pixar', 'film', 'already', 'character', 'universe', 'Take', 'how', 'will.The', 'only', 'surprise', 'came', 'was', 'ride', 'sunset', 'moment', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'bold', 'change', 'still', 'happened', 'What', 'came', 'credits', 'cleared', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'Planes', 'Fire', 'Rescue', 'full-length', 'sequel', 'being', 'planned', 'same', 'screenwriter', ""'m"", 'more', 'little', 'disappointed', 'already', 'approved', 'it.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'great', 'kids', 'adults', 'can', 'busy', 'counting', 'rip-offs', 'See', 'Planes', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'angles', 'vehicular', 'cultures', 'landmarks', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'expect', 'little', 'else', 'impress']",N/A

1630756,AHF97M45JFCB,B00BEIYMTW,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","In the event that you wonder how in the world the Pixar Cars franchise morphed into the Disney Planes universe (of which this film is the first of a proposed trilogy), let&#8217;s take a look at interesting road that led to the piece&#8217;s development.  After the merger of Disney and Pixar (a union affectionately termed Pixney); the lines between the two companies were forever blurred to the point where Pixar works (like Brave) bear the names of almost none of the individuals typically associated with Pixar while Disney pieces like the Tinker Bell films, Tangled, Frozen, and Planes boast Executive Production duties by none other than Pixar poster-boy John Lasseter.Planes actually takes the connection quite a bit further by crediting Lasseter as one of the writers, cameos John Ratzenberger (who appears in every one of Pixar&#8217;s productions) as Harland and follows Pixar&#8217;s impeccable attention to detail concerning such details as actual plane make/ model likeness, geography, historical accuracy and so on.  Yet the fact remains the film isn&#8217;t considered a Pixar production and in fact comes to us from the typically direct-to-dvd branch of the Diz known as DisneyToon Studios (who&#8217;s last theatrical release takes us back to 2005 in the form of  Pooh's Heffalump Movie).  Planes too was supposed to be a direct-to-dvd affair with a fairly modest budget of $50-mil but thanks to a theatrical release gap left between Monsters University and Frozen, Planes got the nod to debut on the big screen on  August 9, 2013.Confused? Don&#8217;t be- all of the behind-the-scenes antics in the world do not a good (or bad) movie make.  Fortunately Planes has the advantage of sitting atop a very long line of animated film experience.  While critics weren&#8217;t particularly enamored with the film, I can attest that it succeeds on a lot of levels where the much costlier ($200-mil) 2011 blockbuster Cars 2 fails.  But before we get to all of that, perhaps a brief summary is in order.Planes follows the exploits of crop duster Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) who holds down steady employment at a Midwest cornfield while practicing aerobatic maneuvers in his spare time and dreaming of the fame and excitement of air racing.Keeping his dreams forever out of reach, his boss, Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer) and his forklift mechanic friend, Dottie (Teri Hatcher) keep reminding Dusty that he was built for the very specific purpose of dusting crops.  However, his good hearted fuel truck friend, Chug (Brad Garrett); think a less redneck but equally innocent Mater, begins training him in private.  The night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive navy war plane named Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach) to teach him how to race.  What follows is a global race adventure rife with personified planes from several nations; some friendly others not so much.Coming in at a runtime of 92-minutes and wearing a PG rating, Planes works on the tried and true &#8220;underdog out of his league&#8221; formula and delivers some pretty genuine laughs along the way.  Sure it&#8217;s nothing we haven&#8217;t collectively seen before, but what Planes lacks in originality it makes up for with heart.  That and some really nice aerial scenes that (unlike say Cars 2&#8217;s action sequences), don&#8217;t take away from the subtle charm of the narrative in the process.If you really care about small details you may notice a whole plethora of little adult-enjoyable spices scattered about like Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as Naval fighter jets; essentially the Planes versions of their Top Gun characters complete with Iceman and Goose helmets to boot.In all Planes doesn&#8217;t succeed in spite of its simplicity and relatively modest budget but because of these things.  In an industry becoming ever more inflated in terms of budget and eye-candy, Planes is a refreshing romp in a franchise that seemed to have lost its way a bit in its first dedicated sequel.  Whether or not diving directly into a trilogy is a wise move is yet to be determined but considering the first Planes movie cost $50-mil to make and has already taken in $220-million, it&#8217;s a safe bet to say we&#8217;ll be visiting this anthropomorphic world of transportation for years to come.",4,Uncluttered Reminder of a Simpler Time in Animation,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,4296,"['event', 'wonder', 'how', 'world', 'Pixar', 'Cars', 'franchise', 'morphed', 'Disney', 'Planes', 'universe', 'film', 'first', 'proposed', 'trilogy', 'let', '8217', 's', 'take', 'look', 'interesting', 'road', 'led', 'piece', '8217', 'development', 'merger', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'union', 'affectionately', 'termed', 'Pixney', 'lines', 'two', 'companies', 'were', 'forever', 'blurred', 'point', 'where', 'Pixar', 'Brave', 'bear', 'names', 'almost', 'none', 'individuals', 'typically', 'associated', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'pieces', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'films', 'Tangled', 'Frozen', 'Planes', 'boast', 'Executive', 'Production', 'duties', 'none', 'other', 'Pixar', 'poster-boy', 'John', 'Lasseter.Planes', 'actually', 'connection', 'quite', 'bit', 'further', 'crediting', 'Lasseter', 'one', 'writers', 'cameos', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'who', 'one', 'Pixar', '8217', 's', 'productions', 'Harland', 'Pixar', '8217', 'impeccable', 'attention', 'detail', 'concerning', 'such', 'details', 'actual', 'plane', 'make/', 'model', 'likeness', 'geography', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'so', 'fact', 'film', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'considered', 'Pixar', 'production', 'fact', 'typically', 'direct-to-dvd', 'branch', 'Diz', 'known', 'DisneyToon', 'Studios', 'who', '8217', 's', 'last', 'theatrical', 'release', 'back', '2005', 'form', 'Pooh', 'Heffalump', 'Movie', 'Planes', 'too', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'direct-to-dvd', 'affair', 'fairly', 'modest', 'budget', '50-mil', 'thanks', 'theatrical', 'release', 'gap', 'left', 'Monsters', 'University', 'Frozen', 'Planes', 'got', 'nod', 'debut', 'big', 'screen', 'August', '9', '2013.Confused', 'Don', '8217', 'be-', 'behind-the-scenes', 'antics', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'bad', 'movie', 'make', 'Fortunately', 'Planes', 'advantage', 'sitting', 'very', 'long', 'line', 'animated', 'film', 'experience', 'critics', 'weren', '8217', 'particularly', 'enamored', 'film', 'can', 'attest', 'lot', 'levels', 'where', 'much', 'costlier', '200-mil', '2011', 'blockbuster', 'Cars', '2', 'fails', 'get', 'perhaps', 'brief', 'summary', 'order.Planes', 'exploits', 'crop', 'duster', 'Dusty', 'Crophopper', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'who', 'down', 'steady', 'employment', 'Midwest', 'cornfield', 'practicing', 'aerobatic', 'maneuvers', 'spare', 'time', 'dreaming', 'fame', 'excitement', 'air', 'racing.Keeping', 'dreams', 'forever', 'reach', 'boss', 'Leadbottom', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'forklift', 'mechanic', 'friend', 'Dottie', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'keep', 'reminding', 'Dusty', 'was', 'built', 'very', 'specific', 'purpose', 'dusting', 'crops', 'However', 'good', 'hearted', 'fuel', 'truck', 'friend', 'Chug', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'think', 'less', 'redneck', 'equally', 'innocent', 'Mater', 'training', 'private', 'night', 'qualifiers', 'Dusty', 'elderly', 'reclusive', 'navy', 'war', 'plane', 'named', 'Skipper', 'Riley', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'teach', 'how', 'race', 'What', 'global', 'race', 'adventure', 'rife', 'personified', 'planes', 'several', 'nations', 'friendly', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much.Coming', 'runtime', '92-minutes', 'wearing', 'PG', 'rating', 'Planes', 'tried', 'true', '8220', 'underdog', 'league', '8221', 'formula', 'delivers', 'pretty', 'genuine', 'way', 'Sure', '8217', 'nothing', 'haven', '8217', 'collectively', 'seen', 'what', 'Planes', 'originality', 'up', 'heart', 'really', 'nice', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'say', 'Cars', '2', '8217', 'action', 'sequences', 'don', '8217', 't', 'take', 'away', 'subtle', 'charm', 'narrative', 'process.If', 'really', 'care', 'small', 'details', 'may', 'notice', 'whole', 'plethora', 'little', 'adult-enjoyable', 'spices', 'scattered', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Naval', 'fighter', 'jets', 'essentially', 'Planes', 'versions', 'Top', 'Gun', 'characters', 'complete', 'Iceman', 'Goose', 'helmets', 'boot.In', 'Planes', 'doesn', '8217', 'succeed', 'spite', 'simplicity', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', 'things', 'industry', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'inflated', 'terms', 'budget', 'eye-candy', 'Planes', 'refreshing', 'romp', 'franchise', 'seemed', 'have', 'lost', 'way', 'bit', 'first', 'dedicated', 'sequel', 'not', 'diving', 'directly', 'trilogy', 'wise', 'move', 'yet', 'be', 'determined', 'considering', 'first', 'Planes', 'movie', 'cost', '50-mil', 'make', 'already', 'taken', '220-million', '8217', 's', 'safe', 'bet', 'say', '8217', 'be', 'visiting', 'anthropomorphic', 'world', 'transportation', 'years', 'come']",N/A

1630775,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00BEIYMTW,Ranny Levy,"[15, 23]","If you thought ""Cars"" was brilliant, then you'll be sure to love their latest animated adventure, ""Planes!""  It's an action-packed comedy featuring Dusty, a small plane with dreams of competing in an around-the-world race.  The only problem is that Dusty is a crop-duster who's afraid of heights!  As you can imagine, this makes it very difficult for Dusty to achieve his dreams.  But, with the help of his best friends and a trained navy fighter plane named Skipper, Dusty finds new hope and inspiration.  KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Molly J, thought that ""the visual effects in this film are spectacular"" and at times it feels as if you are flying right alongside Dusty. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Brianna Hope B says, ""It is a great film. It has hope, adventure and good humor."" Their full reviews follow.Reviewed by Brianna Hope B.This film is too cute, funny and has great animation.Dusty, (Dane Cook-Voice) is a basic crop-dusting plane with big dreams of competing in an aerial race. However he is afraid of heights, yes that's right, heights! In order for him to even get up the nerve to compete and pursue his dreams; he needs the help of his mentor, Skipper, (Stacy Keach-Voice) and his friends.""Planes"" has a good story line and I really like it. It has hope, adventure and good humor with comedians Brad Garrett (Chug-Voice), Sinbad (Roper-Voice) and many more. All the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters. Of course, the 3D animation is spectacular with great detail and lots of lively colors. My favorite scene is when Skipper starts training Dusty and Chug and Dottie (Terri Hatcher-Voice) are talking too loud for Dusty to concentrate. Skipper yells at them to be quiet and they straighten up immediately, but keep talking. This is really funny. My favorite character is Roper, because he says and does the funniest things. He always seems to be rambling about something and is funny.Writer, Jeffrey M. Howard, writes a comedic script that gives kids something to enjoy and feel good about. Another well known comedian voice cast who I enjoyed in this film is Cedric the Entertainer (Leadbottom-Voice).As Walt Disney once said, ""All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.""  I really like this and believe this message is demonstrated throughout the film.I recommend this film for ages 7 to 13. Kids who love Disney animation films will love this one as it is similar to other Disney films. It's also a great film for the family to see although older teens may not be too interested in it.I give ""Planes"" 4 out of 5 stars because I would like to see more originality and uniqueness, but overall it is a great film and I really enjoy watching it. I know you will too.Reviewed by Molly JWell folks, Disney's done it again! ""Planes"" is truly a heartfelt underdog story that tells the audience to believe in themselves.  There are always plenty of obstacles in life, but if you dig deep, you can find the courage to become whatever you dream of.  In Dusty's case, he dreams of becoming the fastest air racer in the world!  His closest friend is Dottie, a forklift and ace mechanic.  Although she tells Dusty that he isn't built to race and that chasing his dreams is downright dangerous, Dottie always has his back, no matter what he decides.  I love Dottie because she is such a loyal friend to Dusty.  She is strong, super smart and practical.  When anyone messes with her friend, she lets them have it!Skipper is also very protective of Dusty.  He was an ace flier in WWII and chooses to be alone and quiet until Dusty talks him into training him for the race.  He wants to train Dusty hard so that he races well and stays safe.  Skipper finds that he can learn a few things from Dusty, too.The visual effects in the film are spectacular and, being 3D, there are plenty of scenes where the audience feels as if they are flying along with Dusty!  The race takes us to amazing places like India, Europe and Mexico.  The music is great too, combining old favorites with lots of new songs.  Since the racers come from countries all over the world, the music is based on the background of the characters, which includes Italian, Mexican and British music, plus many more types.It's no surprise that the director of Planes, Klay Hall, is an airplane enthusiast.  He started drawing airplanes at an early age and his father and grandfather were both pilots.  The executive producer of ""Planes,"" John Lasseter, is a two-time Academy Award-winning director.  He directed huge hits like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2.""  The voice-over cast includes such big names as Dane Cook, Stacy Keach, Teri Hatcher, Sinbad, Val Kilmer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.My favorite scene in the film is when El Chupacabra (El Chu), the legendary Mexican racer, sings to a female racer, Rochelle.  El Chu is trying desperately to win her affection but, keeps failing in hilarious ways.I give ""Planes"" five out of five stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, although it's fun for whole families to watch together, like mine did!

1630779,A2GE1QIP9RJHZI,B00BEIYMTW,"R. Calderon ""The Duck Knight Rises""","[5, 11]","Touted as coming ""from above the world of Cars"", this DisneyToon Studios production looks to the sky in a bid to recapture the success of Pixar's 2006 blockbuster. Taking inspiration from the studio's least inventive and emotionally resonant film may not have been the best idea, because Planes feels like a tired and lazy retread of an already run-of-the-mill movie.Here the protagonist is Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook), a small crop-dusting aircraft whose fear of heights are at odds with his dreams of competing in the Wings Around the Globe rally. With support from mentor Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), forklift Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and glamorous Pan-Asian champion Ishani (Bollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra), he's able to enter the competition and, in the film's overriding message, prove that he's capable of achieving more than he was built for.This may not be a direct Pixar production, but its link to the studio and the apparent guiding hand of John Lasseter means you'd at least expect a certain level of quality. The movie was originally intended as a straight-to-video release, but has been retooled for a worldwide theatrical run. It shows.Planes is a dull concoction of derivative plot, unremarkable characters and slapdash 3D presentation. The film is clearly targeted at a very young audience who, like Cars fans, will want to buy up all the appropriate toys - is this really an excuse for such a lackluster and half-baked product?The gags fly pretty freely, although rarely do they hit the mark. It feels like an eternity before the first titters are raised thanks to a colorful serenade from Carlos Alazraqui's Spanish plane El Chupacabra and John Cleese's ""I don't cry, I'm British"" line. It may appeal to undemanding younger viewers, but there's little to keep the rest entertained save for a pseudo Top Gun reunion early on between Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards.Planes even struggles to deliver on decent spectacle - director Klay Hall swoops over the Taj Mahal and other global landmarks, yet the animated renderings are blocky, cheap-looking and would seem more at home on a Saturday morning cartoon (perhaps betraying its roots as a direct-to-disc quickie).Disney and Pixar are renowned for their trailblazing innovation, but everything about Planes smacks of safe, committee-driven film making with an eye on the bottom line. There are supposedly two sequel films in the works and you can only hope that both are significantly more ambitious than this.",3,'Cars' Spinoff Lacks Pixar Magic,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2479,"['Touted', 'coming', 'world', 'Cars', 'DisneyToon', 'Studios', 'production', 'sky', 'bid', 'recapture', 'success', 'Pixar', '2006', 'blockbuster', 'Taking', 'inspiration', 'studio', 'least', 'inventive', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'idea', 'Planes', 'feels', 'tired', 'lazy', 'retread', 'already', 'run-of-the-mill', 'protagonist', 'Dusty', 'voiced', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'small', 'crop-dusting', 'aircraft', 'fear', 'heights', 'are', 'odds', 'dreams', 'competing', 'Wings', 'Globe', 'rally', 'support', 'mentor', 'Skipper', 'Riley', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'forklift', 'Dottie', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'glamorous', 'Pan-Asian', 'champion', 'Ishani', 'Bollywood', 'superstar', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'able', 'enter', 'competition', 'film', 'overriding', 'message', 'prove', 'capable', 'achieving', 'more', 'was', 'built', 'for.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'direct', 'Pixar', 'production', 'link', 'studio', 'apparent', 'guiding', 'hand', 'John', 'Lasseter', ""'d"", 'least', 'expect', 'certain', 'level', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'straight-to-video', 'release', 'been', 'retooled', 'worldwide', 'theatrical', 'run', 'dull', 'concoction', 'derivative', 'plot', 'unremarkable', 'characters', '3D', 'presentation', 'film', 'clearly', 'targeted', 'very', 'young', 'audience', 'who', 'Cars', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'buy', 'up', 'appropriate', 'toys', 'really', 'excuse', 'lackluster', 'half-baked', 'product', 'gags', 'fly', 'pretty', 'freely', 'rarely', 'do', 'hit', 'mark', 'eternity', 'first', 'titters', 'are', 'raised', 'thanks', 'colorful', 'serenade', 'Carlos', 'Alazraqui', 'Spanish', 'plane', 'El', 'Chupacabra', 'John', 'Cleese', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', ""'m"", 'British', 'line', 'may', 'appeal', 'undemanding', 'younger', 'viewers', 'little', 'keep', 'rest', 'entertained', 'save', 'pseudo', 'Top', 'Gun', 'reunion', 'early', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Anthony', 'Edwards.Planes', 'even', 'deliver', 'decent', 'spectacle', 'director', 'Klay', 'Hall', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'other', 'global', 'landmarks', 'yet', 'animated', 'renderings', 'are', 'blocky', 'cheap-looking', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'home', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'perhaps', 'betraying', 'roots', 'direct-to-disc', 'quickie', '.Disney', 'Pixar', 'are', 'renowned', 'trailblazing', 'innovation', 'everything', 'Planes', 'smacks', 'safe', 'committee-driven', 'film', 'making', 'eye', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'supposedly', 'two', 'sequel', 'films', 'works', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'significantly', 'more', 'ambitious']",N/A

Zwick,"[0, 0]","An offshoot of the &#34;Cars&#34; franchise, &#34;Planes&#34; sets its classic be-all-you-can-be underdog story in the context of a lowly crop duster (Dane Cook) who dreams of one day competing against the big boys of the air (i.e., all those planes built for speed) in a race around the world. With the help of a fuel truck (Brad Garrett), two forklifts (Terri Hatcher and Danny Mann) and a retired navy bomber named Riley (Stacy Keach), who imparts his wisdom and pointers to the eager, fresh-faced lad, Dusty sets out to prove that he is every bit the flyer that those bigger, sleeker and more aerodynamically advanced airplanes are. Just one slight problem though: turns out little Dusty is deathly afraid of heights.With its roots planted firmly in the tradition of &#34;Around the World in 80 Days&#34; and &#34;The Great Race,&#34; &#34;Planes&#34; has grace and charm to spare, as Dusty swoops and soars through the heavens on his way to realizing his dreams. Along the way, he meets up with an international potpourri of fellow aircraft, including Bulldog (John Cleese ) from England, El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) from Mexico, Rochelle (Julia Louise-Dreyfuss) from Canada (the French part, of course) and Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) from India.And off we sail into the wild blue yonder, thanks to a witty script by Jeffrey M. Howard, clean direction by Klay Hall, and top-notch visuals that beautifully create a familiar-looking modern world that's totally devoid of people (even the Statue of Liberty is in the form of a patriotic forklift). All those elements combine to make this animated version of &#34;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&#34; (minus the men, of course) a delight to behold.In fact, &#34;Planes&#34; is what &#34;Cars&#34; logically should have been but wasn't, that is a freewheeling adventure built on movement and speed; instead, the original movie, for some reason, allowed itself to get mired in that dull small town for so long that it eventually stalled out. &#34;Planes,&#34; on the other hand, keeps the narrative in full-speed-ahead mode throughout - and that makes all the difference.",4,"Unlike ""Cars,"" ""Planes"" keeps moving",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2138,"['offshoot', '34', 'Cars', '34', 'franchise', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'classic', 'be-all-you-can-be', 'underdog', 'story', 'context', 'lowly', 'crop', 'duster', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'competing', 'big', 'boys', 'air', 'i.e.', 'planes', 'built', 'speed', 'race', 'world', 'help', 'fuel', 'truck', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'two', 'forklifts', 'Terri', 'Hatcher', 'Danny', 'Mann', 'retired', 'navy', 'bomber', 'named', 'Riley', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', 'wisdom', 'pointers', 'eager', 'fresh-faced', 'lad', 'Dusty', 'out', 'prove', 'bit', 'flyer', 'bigger', 'sleeker', 'more', 'aerodynamically', 'advanced', 'airplanes', 'are', 'Just', 'one', 'slight', 'problem', 'out', 'little', 'Dusty', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'heights.With', 'roots', 'planted', 'firmly', 'tradition', '34', 'World', '80', 'Days', '34', '34', 'Great', 'Race', '34', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'grace', 'charm', 'spare', 'Dusty', 'swoops', 'soars', 'heavens', 'way', 'realizing', 'dreams', 'way', 'up', 'international', 'potpourri', 'fellow', 'aircraft', 'including', 'Bulldog', 'John', 'Cleese', 'England', 'El', 'Chupacabra', 'Carlos', 'Alazraqui', 'Mexico', 'Rochelle', 'Julia', 'Louise-Dreyfuss', 'Canada', 'French', 'part', 'course', 'Ishani', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'India.And', 'sail', 'wild', 'blue', 'yonder', 'thanks', 'witty', 'script', 'Jeffrey', 'M.', 'Howard', 'clean', 'direction', 'Klay', 'Hall', 'top-notch', 'visuals', 'beautifully', 'create', 'familiar-looking', 'modern', 'world', 'totally', 'devoid', 'people', 'even', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'form', 'patriotic', 'forklift', 'elements', 'combine', 'make', 'animated', 'version', '34', 'Magnificent', 'Men', 'Their', 'Flying', 'Machines', '34', 'men', 'course', 'delight', 'behold.In', 'fact', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'what', '34', 'Cars', '34', 'logically', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', ""n't"", 'freewheeling', 'adventure', 'built', 'movement', 'speed', 'instead', 'original', 'movie', 'reason', 'allowed', 'get', 'mired', 'dull', 'small', 'town', 'so', 'long', 'eventually', 'stalled', 'out', '34', 'Planes', '34', 'other', 'hand', 'narrative', 'full-speed-ahead', 'mode', 'difference']",N/A

I had so-so likings for Disney's Planes.  I did not like how Dusty was too similar to the Owen Wilson voiced Lightning McQueen character and I did not like how Skipper was too similar to the Paul Newman voiced Doc Hudson character.Today my 12-year-old son watched Planes with his 9-year-old sister.  The enthusiasm barometer from my kids was way up, while watching Planes, compared to their first viewings of Cars and Cars 2.  I guess all those times I took my kids to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, cultivated their aviation enthusiasm and they were ripe for watching Disney's Planes, today.My son got teary-eyed when Skipper recounted his painful battle experience in War 2.  My son also got teary-eyed when the other racing planes started donating replacement parts to Dusty.Watching the movie with two kids that were loving it made me enjoy it more.  Then, the DVD's Special Features won my heart over with a section about the great vintage war birds, including the P-51D Mustang.So, today, I ordered Disney's Planes (Blu-ray/DVD, 2013, 2-Disc Set, Including Digital Copy).This film and special features cultivates my existing love for aviation.  I would have liked to seen more expensive high-powered actors doing the principal roles in this movie but I respect Disney/Pixar's choice to cut production costs since aviation movies don't do all that great at the box office.  Planes was not a block buster but, it did produce a respectable profit to cost ratio.  It's worth seeing for the first time.

I can't even get them to finish this movie.I love Disney and I love Pixar, but this movie was boring and it seemed like the animation team did great, but the story/acting sucked.  Dane Cook was a bad choice for the main character, Fluffy wasn't able to be as funny as he normally is since this was for kids, and the others were people I'd never heard of, nor did I like their voice acting. Teri Hatcher did a good job with what they gave her though.The writing got complicated; I sat there thinking, do they expect kids to understand this? Or do they think kids aren't listening to the words? At one point Teri's character makes an automotive (?) joke that even the other characters in the movie didn't get; there was alot of plane lingo as well as alot of science. Not much humor. I was bored and had to make myself finish it because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.I predicted the ending after the first few minutes; unlike other Pixar films (and even some Disney films), there was no major plot twist.

1630813,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00BEIYMTW,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","I walked into this movie knowing full well what I was getting into. A direct-to-video film promoted to the big screen that was produced by Disney (not Pixar) capitalizing on the success of Cars. While it is by far not a prefect film, or even a great film, it hits enough of the right marks to make it a worthwhile show to watch with my son. There may not be enough to keep all of the adults entertained, but it's a far cry from lots of the mindless kid's films that always pop up.The story is about a crop duster with aspirations to race in a highly coveted world marathon and with the help of an old veteran and his mechanic friend he gets his shot. Even though the writers of Planes were trying to not to remake Cars the similarities are there. The race theme in of itself is undeniably familiar. Then add to that the main villain being a competitor in the same race like in Cars and our hero getting advice from a plane many years his elder sounds a lot like the McQueen/Doc Hudson relationship. While these similarities are more just on the surface (and Cars really went beyond this theme for most of the film) they are indeed there.As I said before this movie was produced by Disney, and not Pixar. While Cars director John Lasseter is the executive producer that's about the only connection aside from the setting. This shows in the writing. While the movie has heart and the story moves at a decent pace the level of quality is indeed a few notches lower. For one the story pushes that tired old comedy relief character Disney can't help but put in all of their movies. While Cars had Mater that character actually contributed to the story and emotional payoff. In Planes their comic relief is in El Chupacabra. Although there are two scenes where this character lends something to the scenery, if you take him completely out of the film you would hardly miss a step. And worse of all he's not really funny. Actually the entire film isn't really all that funny. Don't expect a lot of chuckles.I feel that there is a lot more one and two dimensional characterizations on this film, and makes the world feel rather thin. A lot of the playful backdrops found in Cars are gone. The bad guys are just plain bad and there are some substandard caricatures being played as well. The animation is pretty good, but  not Pixar good. The planes and some backdrops seems to have more attention to detail, but then you will look at a forklift talking or some other animation and you can tell not a lot of effort was put into it. I get that this was supposed to be a straight to video affair, and in that arena I would be impressed. However you move it to the big screen then a company like Disney should know better and spend more time on it.So that was the bad stuff. What about the good? Like I said the story may be simple, but there is a decent amount of heart. Disney did have the good sense to tone down the cliches' that plague Disney animated films over the decades. While the movie is not funny it is fun. There is some real plot progression going on even if it's on a basic level. There are a lot of children's films that are just plain stupid. They are written stupidly with the expectation that the viewers are too young to understand (Disney is just a guilty of this as other productions). Planes  doesn't go down to that level. It gives the young audience the respect deserved and the older audience enough to pass it as ""not stupid"". I think the movie gets a hard time because it is performing under the shadow of Cars, which is a far superior production. Take that out of the equation and you will set your sights more realistic.So the movie is good enough. What about the disk? The Blu-Ray transfer is spot on and looks great. It's not a reference disc, but it is clear and crisp with some high definition eye candy to enjoy here and there. The surround audio doesn't completely envelop you, but you do enjoy a fair amount of atmospheric effects. The Blu-Ray movie looks and sounds fine, but the extras and special features make me feeling like I'm being short changed. Here are the features as they stand:Exclusive Musical Scene: Franz's Song - This is a deleted scene that has been fully produced. It's cute and short. A little Disney-ish so no loss it not being on the finished product.Klay's Flight Plan - This is the best feature by far. It is less a making of documentary and more like a personal commentary from the director on his love for airplanes and the appreciation he had for the content. There is a little bit of information on the making of the film, but it's mostly a love letter to the awesome machines.Deleted Scenes - Two in fact. One is only in story board mode and is part of Dusty's training. The other pre-visual animation at the Taj Mahal.Meet the Racers - Mini cartons of a few of the main plane characters. El Cu and Ripslinger's play like a commercial. Dusty's is like a Pixar short-short and Ishani is a music video styled short. There are very brief.Top 10 Fliers - A rather messy educational video listing 10 historic pilots. Can't really see any rhyme or reason to how they organize this list, but at least it tries to teach something.Info - This special features is simply the disclaimer notes about the commentaries (that don't exist) that you see before the film. Yes. This is listed as a special feature on the disk. Don't ask me why.I would have liked to have seen a real behind the scenes featurette with interviews with staff and shots of the voice actors in action, but that is not to be.Planes is not a bad film. It entertains the kids well enough while not insulting them, and there should be enough to at least keep most adults from falling asleep. All things considered it's better than expected. Maybe for most of you it may be best to wait and see if the price goes down. However if you have kids that saw it in the theaters and they enjoyed it there should be no reason not to let them enjoy it now.",4,It was better than expected.

It was made by DISNYTOON studios who make some of the computer animated tv shows on the DISNEY channel and Toon Disney. It was supposed to be a direct-to-video release but when DISNEY saw how good the scenes looked they decided they would give it a theatrical release. Even though it was not produced by PIXAR, John Lasseter who directed and produced a lot of the PIXAR films and works for the PIXAR company was executive producer for PLANES. I thought this movie was great. It had a great story line great animation and had great music scored by Mark Mancina. Plus the songs in the movie were great and fitting in the places they were played. Overall this was a great movie and in my opinion, it soared higher than any of the film critics remarks and was better than the credit they gave it. After all, I don't determine whether I like a movie based on critics' remarks anyway because I have loved many movies 100% that critics have said were nothing but crap!

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 3]","Before I begin my review I want to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together so it is important to do the following when using Amazon reviews of films: Take note as to whether the reviewer is reviewing the theater release (you can sort reviews by newest first) the DVD or the Bluray. That is always the best guide. With that said, here is my review of the BLURAY.PLANES is &#8211; for all intents and purposes &#8211; an aerial version of the two CARS films. In fact there is a preview of the Planes sequel (direct to DVD) on this set. PLANES was probably aimed at the Direct-to-DVD market originally but they added 3-D and were able to market it to those theaters as well.As to the  91-minute film itself, there are enough reviews here to guide you (as for me, it was basically the same old story about finding you future success). I&#8217;ll discuss the BD and bonuses.First the BD looks great! Wonderful images and sound.The bonuses include:A deleted song (with live introduction by the Director Klay Hall and one of the films producers.

Instead, I want to talk about how ANNOYING it is that the movie &#34;chirps&#34; every 10-15 min. or so.  My blu-ray player's firmware is up to date, so I know it's not that.  All other movies work fine, too, so I'm pretty sure it's just this movie.  Maybe I got a defective disc, I don't know, but as I watch the movie, there is an occasional, very loud, &#34;chirp&#34; (for lack of a better word).  I suspect this is some sort of copy protection scheme that my player doesn't like.  Don't even get me started on copy-protection rubbish--anyone who really wants to copy the disc is going to find a way to do it.  Period.  There is always a work-around.  The only way to foil a pirate is to make the disc have so many errors that the copy program gets confused and drops packets and stuff.  Great--now you've prevented the movie from being copied, but you have also made my legally purchased copy not play properly on my set.  Stupid Hollywood.  (Oh, yeah--I was trying to &#34;not get started&#34;...)Anyway, the movie itself is fine and I did get a digital copy, so I'll give it an extra star for that.
