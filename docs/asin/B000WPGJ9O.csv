The quality of the picture and sound though, is as if someone was watching it on TV and had a video recorder pointed at the TV.  Really crappy quality on the picture and sound.  Tennant was thrilling and chilling.  The storyline is great.  Reminds me of alot of those lifetime movies where a romance goes really wrong.Even for a made for TV movie (which this was) it's crap quality on the picture.  I was really disappointed.",3,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD.",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,464,"['like', 'movie', 'great', 'drama', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'someone', 'was', 'watching', 'TV', 'had', 'video', 'recorder', 'pointed', 'TV', 'Really', 'crappy', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'Tennant', 'was', 'thrilling', 'chilling', 'storyline', 'great', 'alot', 'lifetime', 'movies', 'where', 'romance', 'really', 'wrong.Even', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'crap', 'quality', 'picture', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed']",Secret Smile

Equal parts charming and deliciously evil, David pulls this role on like a custom fit suit and strides about with purpose and passion.  Plenty of lovely twists and turns to keep a person from getting too comfortable with the story.  Your unease builds to a real nail biter of a conclusion that moves you forward on the couch a bit.  I was this close to yelling at the screen,'get out of the house you silly girl!'...always a good sign in a movie!",5,No Secret Here,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,499,"['secret', 'here', 'David', 'Tennant', 'amazing', 'actor', 'Equal', 'parts', 'charming', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'David', 'role', 'custom', 'fit', 'suit', 'strides', 'purpose', 'passion', 'Plenty', 'lovely', 'twists', 'keep', 'person', 'getting', 'too', 'comfortable', 'story', 'unease', 'builds', 'real', 'nail', 'biter', 'conclusion', 'forward', 'couch', 'bit', 'was', 'close', 'yelling', 'screen', ""'get"", 'house', 'silly', 'girl', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'movie']",Secret Smile

In a departure from his usual roles, David plays a  sadistic stalker, who must have control over everything.  It's not so much what is done, but what is implied. Kate Ashfield is good but could have been better. Claire Goose is great.  This is a gripping tale of stalking, control, and revenge.

By the time part one was over (it's in two parts), I had to stop for the day.  I'll watch the second half when I've recovered a bit.  I've seen this before and I know what happens.

Tennant was coldly terrifying, and I'm such a wuss that I couldn't look my screensaver in the eye for the next few days. He was demonic and menacing--all smiles and empty eyes--which were brown, ""but there was nobody at home,"" only an in-dwelling spirit of total malice. I do agree with other commentators about the weakness of the plot--why would everybody in a tightly knit family suddenly lose their good judgment over a complete stranger who has moved into--literally and figuratively--their lives? It's a long slide into hell for the heroine and a real nail biter all the way. Scary, but as I viewed it, I also had the queer feeling I was submitting to a kind of emotional abuse which I'd willingly taken on by continuing to watch. Can't actually say I enjoyed the experience.",3,Horrors!,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,884,"['warning', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'ever', 'want', 'look', '10', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'Tennant', 'was', 'coldly', 'terrifying', ""'m"", 'such', 'wuss', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'screensaver', 'eye', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'was', 'demonic', 'menacing', 'smiles', 'empty', 'eyes', 'were', 'brown', 'was', 'nobody', 'home', 'only', 'in-dwelling', 'spirit', 'total', 'malice', 'do', 'agree', 'other', 'commentators', 'weakness', 'plot', 'why', 'would', 'everybody', 'tightly', 'knit', 'family', 'suddenly', 'lose', 'good', 'judgment', 'complete', 'stranger', 'who', 'moved', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'lives', 'long', 'slide', 'hell', 'heroine', 'real', 'nail', 'biter', 'way', 'Scary', 'viewed', 'also', 'had', 'queer', 'feeling', 'was', 'submitting', 'kind', 'emotional', 'abuse', ""'d"", 'willingly', 'taken', 'continuing', 'watch', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'experience']",Secret Smile

I've also enjoyed his work in Fright Night, Hamlet, Harry Potter, and his amazing performance as Casanova. But I was not ready for the shocking performance he gives here. He will blow you away and really truly make you hate him. You don't think Dr. Who when you see him. He's an utterly different person.But Kate Ashfield was equally wonderful. Amazing work from both of them. I will seek her work out in the future.It's a familiar story which we've seen before in lots of bad movies. The performances are what elevate this. I do want to complain about the presentation. I know its not a Blu-Ray, but the colors on this disc are faded and washed out. It looks like a very old TV show from 20 years ago whose prints haven't been taken care of. Also, the DVD menu is amateurish. So, I am subtracting a star for the presentation, but not the performance.",4,You're going to be surprised!,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,892,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'Who', ""'ve"", 'also', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Hamlet', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Casanova', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'shocking', 'performance', 'here', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'really', 'truly', 'make', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'when', 'see', 'utterly', 'different', 'person.But', 'Kate', 'Ashfield', 'was', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'Amazing', 'work', 'will', 'seek', 'work', 'out', 'future.It', 'familiar', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lots', 'bad', 'movies', 'performances', 'are', 'what', 'elevate', 'do', 'want', 'complain', 'presentation', 'know', 'not', 'Blu-Ray', 'colors', 'disc', 'are', 'faded', 'washed', 'out', 'very', 'old', 'TV', 'show', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'prints', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'Also', 'DVD', 'menu', 'amateurish', 'So', 'am', 'subtracting', 'star', 'presentation', 'not', 'performance']",Secret Smile

Started rather a bit slow but this Psychological thriller developed very excitingly as the time passes. Suspence prevaled as the minutes passed. I have not read the original novel by the now established Nicci French from which the script was adapted.I don't like to get inside the mind of this psychopath whose mysteries smile was full of venom, while showing innocence.  I recommend that it. It is more than worth having this DVD in your library.The quality of the transfer is very good as also the sound track.  It has a very exciting finale after all the jealousy, greed and revenge not to mention the innocent deaths.  Actors David Tennant (Casanova) and Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead) in my opinion were great.
