He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)While the book can drag and be a tad redundant; this film adaptation puts life into the story.

Contrary to popular opinion, the first film version with Spencer Tracy isn't that hot, and has a gassy ponderousness and air of fakery about it.  Anthony Quinn is more freshly true and this little film also has great close up marlin footage as a compensation.  Overall it is not only more authentic, both as to the fish and as to the Cuban setting, but also lighter and brighter.  Frankly Quinn beats Tracy by a country mile; he isn't some white liberal worrying about portraying a Cubano with dignity, and gives you a well-rounded performance which admits the character's faults and a certain tendancy to be out of his head.  That makes his quest believable and not simply fantastic.  Hemingway did actually pick this story up out of real life, but any writer knows that such fact is harder to handle than fiction.Alas, the film has a few other faults such as poor (old TV) film quality, plus a distracting subplot with a Hemingwayesque writer figure.  Yeah, the shot of the old man superimposed with the marlin is funny, but at least has the excuse of being near impossible to avoid.  There is no excuse for turning a full moon at sea into a giant searchlight worthy of a prison camp.  And then they avoid a great highlight of the book--the night scenes with the sharks!The subplot is the main problem though.  It doesn't finally kill the story, but anyone who has read the novella knows how taut and carefully paced it is between the fisherman's day and night battles, first with the marlin and then with the sharks that devour it.  Cutting from that to Mr. Writer and his shallow marital issues is at best minimally interesting the first couple times (mainly because the duo is cast well, and nicely decked out in period costume) but eventually trite.  Its a pity because this film, however low budget, had so much going for it, yet its makers strangely didn't trust Hemingway's story enough.  And this subplot, students should know, doesn't track Hemingway biography either, nor any of his wives -- the well dressed ditz that is the unnamed writer's wife actually resembles Hemingway's Key West (not Cuba) mistress Jane Mason, who he never paired up with in literary excursions.  Nor does it track the Roger/Audrey subplot of Islands in the Stream (the egg out of which Old Man was hatched).  Its just too bad to have earnest people who look so good but are such bad news, crowding out a delicate story.Overall, however, the effort is saved by Quinn's good sense and an excellent supporting Cuban crew, rounding out the village and the old man's family -- only slight liberties on the novella.  Quinn's shrewdness and the director's  option toward lightness keep the main plot from veering into this novella's very own shark infested waters--the danger of sentimentality at one end, and too heavy metaphor at the other.  Quinn's handling of the old man's monologues and dialogues keeps the project with at least one foot firmly set in the realm of realism.  And he wonderfully looks the part too, in every frame in which he appears.",4,Elusive Prey,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,3172,"['Hemingway', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'story', 'old', 'luck', 'Cuban', 'fisherman', 'encounter', 'marlin', 'elusive', 'prey', 'cinema', 'Contrary', 'popular', 'opinion', 'first', 'film', 'version', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', ""n't"", 'hot', 'gassy', 'ponderousness', 'air', 'fakery', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'more', 'freshly', 'true', 'little', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'close', 'marlin', 'footage', 'compensation', 'Overall', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'authentic', 'fish', 'Cuban', 'setting', 'also', 'lighter', 'brighter', 'Frankly', 'Quinn', 'beats', 'Tracy', 'country', 'mile', ""n't"", 'white', 'liberal', 'worrying', 'portraying', 'Cubano', 'dignity', 'well-rounded', 'performance', 'character', 'faults', 'certain', 'tendancy', 'be', 'head', 'quest', 'believable', 'not', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'Hemingway', 'did', 'actually', 'pick', 'story', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'writer', 'such', 'fact', 'harder', 'handle', 'fiction.Alas', 'film', 'few', 'other', 'faults', 'such', 'poor', 'old', 'TV', 'film', 'quality', 'distracting', 'subplot', 'Hemingwayesque', 'writer', 'figure', 'Yeah', 'shot', 'old', 'man', 'superimposed', 'marlin', 'funny', 'least', 'excuse', 'being', 'near', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'excuse', 'turning', 'full', 'moon', 'sea', 'giant', 'searchlight', 'worthy', 'prison', 'camp', 'then', 'avoid', 'great', 'highlight', 'book', 'night', 'scenes', 'sharks', 'subplot', 'main', 'problem', ""n't"", 'finally', 'kill', 'story', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'novella', 'how', 'taut', 'carefully', 'paced', 'fisherman', 'day', 'night', 'battles', 'first', 'marlin', 'then', 'sharks', 'devour', 'Cutting', 'Mr', 'Writer', 'shallow', 'marital', 'issues', 'best', 'minimally', 'interesting', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'mainly', 'duo', 'cast', 'well', 'nicely', 'decked', 'out', 'period', 'costume', 'eventually', 'trite', 'pity', 'film', 'however', 'low', 'budget', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'makers', 'strangely', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Hemingway', 'story', 'enough', 'subplot', 'students', 'should', 'know', ""n't"", 'track', 'Hemingway', 'biography', 'either', 'wives', 'well', 'dressed', 'ditz', 'unnamed', 'writer', 'wife', 'actually', 'Hemingway', 'Key', 'West', 'not', 'Cuba', 'mistress', 'Jane', 'Mason', 'who', 'never', 'paired', 'up', 'literary', 'excursions', 'track', 'Roger/Audrey', 'subplot', 'Islands', 'Stream', 'egg', 'Old', 'Man', 'was', 'hatched', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'have', 'earnest', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'are', 'such', 'bad', 'news', 'crowding', 'out', 'delicate', 'story.Overall', 'however', 'effort', 'saved', 'Quinn', 'good', 'sense', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'Cuban', 'crew', 'rounding', 'out', 'village', 'old', 'man', 'family', 'only', 'slight', 'liberties', 'novella', 'Quinn', 'shrewdness', 'director', 'option', 'lightness', 'keep', 'main', 'plot', 'veering', 'novella', 'very', 'own', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'danger', 'sentimentality', 'one', 'end', 'too', 'heavy', 'metaphor', 'other', 'Quinn', 'handling', 'old', 'man', 'monologues', 'dialogues', 'keeps', 'project', 'least', 'one', 'foot', 'firmly', 'set', 'realm', 'realism', 'wonderfully', 'part', 'too', 'frame']",N/A

907140,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B0009K7RM0,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","Not much actually happens in this movie: an old man Santiago (Anthony Quinn) has not caught a fish in over eighty trips, goes out for one last trip and catches a huge fish.  By doing so, he discovers, perhaps for the first time, the insignificance of human beings in the overall scheme of things.  It is a testament to Anthony Quinn's performance in the central role that our interest is sustained; his range of facial expressions is positively wondrous, especially when alone on the boat with no one but himself to talk to.  Director Jud Taylor also works hard to develop the spring-and-autumn relationship between Santiago and the boy Anderez (Paul Calderon), which prompts the old man to consider his own behavior as an old men when he believed that he was virtually impregnable.  The story has a Hemingwayesque figure in the form of Tom Pruitt (Gary Cole), a writer who cannot leave Santiago's small community until he has discovered for himself just what motivates the old man.  This role is a little superfluous, but at least shows why the author himself was interested in such an apparently insignificant story.",4,Perfectly Serviceable Version of the Hemingway Classic,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1118,"['Not', 'much', 'actually', 'movie', 'old', 'man', 'Santiago', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'not', 'caught', 'fish', 'eighty', 'trips', 'out', 'one', 'last', 'trip', 'huge', 'fish', 'doing', 'so', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'insignificance', 'human', 'beings', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things', 'testament', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'performance', 'central', 'role', 'interest', 'sustained', 'range', 'facial', 'expressions', 'positively', 'wondrous', 'especially', 'when', 'alone', 'boat', 'one', 'talk', 'Director', 'Jud', 'Taylor', 'also', 'hard', 'develop', 'spring-and-autumn', 'relationship', 'Santiago', 'boy', 'Anderez', 'Paul', 'Calderon', 'old', 'man', 'consider', 'own', 'behavior', 'old', 'men', 'when', 'believed', 'was', 'virtually', 'impregnable', 'story', 'Hemingwayesque', 'figure', 'form', 'Tom', 'Pruitt', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'Santiago', 'small', 'community', 'discovered', 'just', 'what', 'old', 'man', 'role', 'little', 'superfluous', 'least', 'shows', 'why', 'author', 'was', 'interested', 'such', 'apparently', 'insignificant', 'story']",N/A

Hemingway's ""Old Man"" isn't exactly full of action, but kids liked reading the novella mainly because they identified with Santiago's ruminations about life and not being defeated by it.  This facet of the story is wonderfully presented by Anthony Quinn in a masterful performance as Santiago.A nice touch to the story (and one that was lost on most of my students) was including Hemingway as a character in the movie: an unnamed newspaper writer on vacation with his wife and who wants to tell the story of Santiago's struggle.  Also some of the effects seem dated (The marlin leaping up in the air looked like it was projected behind Anthony Quinn), and some students laughed at the production values of this 15 year old movie.That said, most students actually enjoyed seeing the movie, and I think it was presented well and well acted.
