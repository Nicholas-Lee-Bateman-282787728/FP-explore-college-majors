1055085,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000NA21RM,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","DORM is a spine-tingling character-driven drama that serves as Thailand's answer to WHISPERING CORRIDORS or THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE. It follows a 7th grade boy who is admitted into a boarding school by his parents, where he receives a less than amiable welcome by the other students and teachers. After befriending another lonely boy, he soon comes to find out that his new friend is actually the ghost of a young boy that had drowned years earlier. With no gore and few shocks, DORM spends most of its time developing a true suspense through the children's chilling ghost stories and the subtle techniques used to imply the presence of the entities haunting the school's empty hallways. The cast is filled with many talented young actors, but it is Chalee Trairat's incredible performance as the misfit Chatree that immediately draws the audience into his loneliness and anger, showing an honest character progression on-screen as he learns selflessness and regard for others. Songyos Sugmakanan delivers a strong coming of age story that is both sad at times and heart-warming at others. Along with the help of cinematographer Niramon Ross (SHUTTER), Sugmakanan has created a beautiful and elegantly-shot film, using a cool color palette of sickly greens to strengthen the eerie and unsettling mood. Though comparisons to THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE are inevitable, DORM tells its own unique story to become one of the best ghost tales Thailand has to offer.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Dorm,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1481,"['DORM', 'spine-tingling', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'Thailand', 'answer', 'WHISPERING', 'CORRIDORS', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'BACKBONE', '7th', 'grade', 'boy', 'who', 'admitted', 'boarding', 'school', 'parents', 'where', 'less', 'amiable', 'welcome', 'other', 'students', 'teachers', 'befriending', 'lonely', 'boy', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'friend', 'actually', 'ghost', 'young', 'boy', 'had', 'drowned', 'years', 'earlier', 'gore', 'few', 'shocks', 'DORM', 'most', 'time', 'developing', 'true', 'suspense', 'children', 'chilling', 'ghost', 'stories', 'subtle', 'techniques', 'used', 'imply', 'presence', 'entities', 'haunting', 'school', 'empty', 'hallways', 'cast', 'filled', 'many', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'Chalee', 'Trairat', 'incredible', 'performance', 'misfit', 'Chatree', 'immediately', 'audience', 'loneliness', 'anger', 'showing', 'honest', 'character', 'progression', 'on-screen', 'selflessness', 'regard', 'others', 'Songyos', 'Sugmakanan', 'strong', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'sad', 'times', 'heart-warming', 'others', 'help', 'cinematographer', 'Niramon', 'Ross', 'SHUTTER', 'Sugmakanan', 'created', 'beautiful', 'elegantly-shot', 'film', 'using', 'cool', 'color', 'palette', 'sickly', 'greens', 'strengthen', 'eerie', 'unsettling', 'mood', 'comparisons', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'BACKBONE', 'are', 'inevitable', 'DORM', 'own', 'unique', 'story', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'ghost', 'tales', 'Thailand', 'offer.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1055088,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000NA21RM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Imagine, if you will, a ghost story with great depth and emotion.  Obviously, we're talking about Asian horror, and no country is churning out more impressive horror films than Thailand.  Of course, ghosts and spirits are an accepted and important part of Thai culture, and that has to play a part in the making of a film such as Dek Hor (Dorm).  If you're looking for things that go Boo or long-haired girls crawling out of television sets, you'll find nothing of the sort here.  What you will find, instead, is a ghost story that mines the depths of human drama and touches your heart rather than tingles your spine.This story centers around a young lad named Chatree (Charlie Trairat) who gets shipped off to boarding school in the middle of his seventh grade year of school.  His father says the local schools are not good enough and he wants his son to attend a school with a good academic reputation, but we come to find out that there may be other factors involved in the decision.  In any event, Chatree is most unhappy to leave his family and friends and to trade his bedroom for one cot among at least a hundred more inside a large communal dormitory.  His new classmates don't make life any easier, teasing the new boy and filling his head with a bunch of ghost stories.  A young pregnant woman supposedly committed suicide there (and, as one of the boys points out, pregnant ghosts are the worst kind of spirits), the ghost of a former teacher supposedly haunts the dormitory, and there's the story of a kid who drowned in the old swimming pool.  Then there's the rather cold overseer of the dormitory, Ms. Pranee (Chintara Sukapatana), who spends a lot of time crying while playing a certain song and staring at the contents of one of her desk drawers.  In this radically new environment, Chatree feels abandoned and alone, and he refuses to take any of his father's phone calls.Fortunately for Chatree, one boy does befriend him and shows him the ropes - but Vichien (Sirachuch Chienthaworn) is not like the other kids at all.  The heart of this story becomes the friendship that develops between these two boys and the transition of Chatree from a normal, self-centered boy to a young man willing to place a friend's well-being before his own - and able to adapt to change and forgive the sins of others.  That's really all I can say without giving away too much of the story.The cinematography of this film is just fantastic, the script is exceedingly well-written, and the music score really complements the story as it develops - but it's the acting of the boys, especially Trairat and Chienthaworn, that impressed me the most.  Lay aside your expectations of chills and thrills and prepare to be won over completely by this touching, multi-layered, exceedingly human ""ghost story.""",5,A magnificent Thai ghost story,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2800,"['Imagine', 'will', 'ghost', 'story', 'great', 'depth', 'emotion', 'Obviously', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Asian', 'horror', 'country', 'churning', 'out', 'more', 'impressive', 'horror', 'films', 'Thailand', 'course', 'ghosts', 'spirits', 'are', 'accepted', 'important', 'part', 'Thai', 'culture', 'play', 'part', 'making', 'film', 'such', 'Dek', 'Hor', 'Dorm', ""'re"", 'looking', 'things', 'go', 'Boo', 'long-haired', 'girls', 'crawling', 'television', 'sets', ""'ll"", 'find', 'nothing', 'sort', 'here', 'What', 'will', 'find', 'instead', 'ghost', 'story', 'depths', 'human', 'drama', 'touches', 'heart', 'rather', 'tingles', 'spine.This', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'lad', 'named', 'Chatree', 'Charlie', 'Trairat', 'who', 'shipped', 'boarding', 'school', 'middle', 'seventh', 'grade', 'year', 'school', 'father', 'local', 'schools', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'son', 'attend', 'school', 'good', 'academic', 'reputation', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'factors', 'involved', 'decision', 'event', 'Chatree', 'most', 'unhappy', 'leave', 'family', 'friends', 'trade', 'bedroom', 'one', 'cot', 'least', 'hundred', 'more', 'large', 'communal', 'dormitory', 'new', 'classmates', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'life', 'easier', 'teasing', 'new', 'boy', 'filling', 'head', 'bunch', 'ghost', 'stories', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'supposedly', 'committed', 'suicide', 'there', 'one', 'boys', 'points', 'out', 'pregnant', 'ghosts', 'are', 'worst', 'kind', 'spirits', 'ghost', 'former', 'teacher', 'supposedly', 'dormitory', 'story', 'kid', 'who', 'drowned', 'old', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Then', 'rather', 'cold', 'overseer', 'dormitory', 'Ms.', 'Pranee', 'Chintara', 'Sukapatana', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'crying', 'playing', 'certain', 'song', 'staring', 'contents', 'one', 'desk', 'drawers', 'radically', 'new', 'environment', 'Chatree', 'feels', 'abandoned', 'alone', 'take', 'father', 'phone', 'calls.Fortunately', 'Chatree', 'one', 'boy', 'befriend', 'ropes', 'Vichien', 'Sirachuch', 'Chienthaworn', 'not', 'other', 'kids', 'heart', 'story', 'friendship', 'two', 'boys', 'transition', 'Chatree', 'normal', 'self-centered', 'boy', 'young', 'man', 'willing', 'place', 'friend', 'well-being', 'own', 'able', 'adapt', 'change', 'forgive', 'sins', 'others', 'really', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'just', 'fantastic', 'script', 'exceedingly', 'well-written', 'music', 'score', 'really', 'story', 'acting', 'boys', 'especially', 'Trairat', 'Chienthaworn', 'impressed', 'most', 'Lay', 'aside', 'expectations', 'chills', 'thrills', 'prepare', 'be', 'won', 'completely', 'touching', 'multi-layered', 'exceedingly', 'human', 'ghost', 'story']",N/A

1055090,A34O1FHEAN9DN6,B000NA21RM,E. Beckstrom,"[0, 0]","A very good ghost story, but Dorm is not simply a horror movie, and viewers looking for top flight scares may be disappointed. Dorm has its share of creepy moments, but at its heart it is a coming of age story with an emphasis on character development and theme - an uplifting story about friendship, loyalty, forgiveness, and taking responsibility to help others. In that sense, and to some extent in its setting, it reminded me of Guillermo del Toro's Devil's Backbone; though the latter has more moments of sheer horror. You can guess that a film so focused on these specific themes could get preachy or maudlin, but Dorm never does.My one complaint is the inclusion of one oddball sequence in the middle when the kids at the boarding school are watching a horror-comedy movie. The scene does serve a purpose in terms of character development, but goes on too long, breaking the momentum of the movie. That's a relatively small complaint, though, compared to how good the movie is as a whole. And, while I'm always leery of horror movies which incorporate broad humor, Dorm manages its humor very effectively for the most part, strategically employing those moments to support character development.No spoilers here, but let me add that the ending, and the way in which loose plot and character points are resolved, is extremely well-done; which is the result of what is, for the most part, an excellent script.",4,A very good ghost story - but not simply a horror movie.,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1414,"['very', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'Dorm', 'not', 'simply', 'horror', 'movie', 'viewers', 'looking', 'top', 'flight', 'scares', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Dorm', 'share', 'creepy', 'moments', 'heart', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'theme', 'uplifting', 'story', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'forgiveness', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'help', 'others', 'sense', 'extent', 'setting', 'reminded', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'Devil', 'Backbone', 'latter', 'more', 'moments', 'sheer', 'horror', 'can', 'guess', 'film', 'so', 'focused', 'specific', 'themes', 'could', 'get', 'preachy', 'maudlin', 'Dorm', 'never', 'does.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'inclusion', 'one', 'oddball', 'sequence', 'middle', 'when', 'kids', 'boarding', 'school', 'are', 'watching', 'horror-comedy', 'movie', 'scene', 'serve', 'purpose', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'too', 'long', 'breaking', 'momentum', 'movie', 'relatively', 'small', 'complaint', 'though', 'compared', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'whole', ""'m"", 'always', 'leery', 'horror', 'movies', 'incorporate', 'broad', 'humor', 'Dorm', 'humor', 'very', 'effectively', 'most', 'part', 'strategically', 'employing', 'moments', 'support', 'character', 'development.No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'let', 'add', 'ending', 'way', 'loose', 'plot', 'character', 'points', 'are', 'resolved', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'result', 'what', 'most', 'part', 'excellent', 'script']",N/A
1055091,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000NA21RM,Ernest Jagger,"[18, 18]","A couple of months back, I was purchasing the latest CRITERION release of the great film ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" by Japanese director Mizoguchi, when I stumbled across two DVDs that looked interesting. One was the Thai film DORM, and the other one was the Japanese film SILK. My VHS copy of ""Sansho the Bailiff"" was on its last legs, and in my excitement at purchasing this wonderful classic I decided to pick up these two horror films. I was not disappointed. Yes, there are similarities [strong ones at that] to Guillermo del Toro's great film ""The Devil's Backbone"" [which I own].However, that is not to say that DORM is not a good film. Moreover, many horror flicks borrow from each other, and for me the film DORM succeeded in being a good film. However, I recommend that you rent the film first to see if this is a film you will like. I happened to like the film, as I found it highly enjoyable; however, horror is one of those genre's where some will like the film, while others will not. I am of the former group.The film is set in Thailand, and as I do not wish to give out too many spoilers of this film, I will write that the films narrative centers around a young boy named Ton Chatree (Chalee Trairat) whose father has sent him to a boarding school. It is here that Ton finds himself in a lonely state. The films narrative moves along in a coherent manner in which Ton finds a friend. But this is not a typical friend that Ton meets, and as such the film veers into a supernatural drama where friendship is the catalyst for these two young boys.But all is not what it seems in this film. I do not wish to spoil the film for you. However, what makes this film different from many other horror films is the way the director and screenwriters are able to employ a dramatic formula to the story that works. Is this a great film? I would not go that far. However, it is not a bad film either, and I found that as I was viewing the film, I realized that it was not so much of a horror film, but rather a sad drama. I would recommend this film to viewers. It's refreshing to see a ghost story where the ghost is not evil, and one can actually sympathize with the ghost. Rent it first. As for me, I'm glad that I purchased the film, and it is a welcome addition to my Asian film library.

It does have a supernatural element to it, but to market it as just another Asian horror movie over here was a stupid, stupid move; the horror fans didn't really know what to make of it (most of them, anyway), and the people who would have really enjoyed it stayed away because they thought it was yet another Ring clone. I'm telling you all this, of course, because Dorm, a Thai film released in 2006, has recently suffered the same fate in its American marketing campaign. Yes, there is a ghost in this movie. That doesn't make it a horror film any more than the ghost in, well, Ghost makes that a horror film. (Well, it is a horror, but that has far more to do with Patrick Swayze's lack of acting skills and its horrifying soundtrack. But that's another review entirely.) Dorm is, instead, a not-quite-sweet coming-of-age story with a subtle, witty script, fine characters, and a good, solid emotional punch.Plot: Ton (The Kingmaker's Charlie Trairat) is sent off to boarding school thanks to problems he's having at home. He doesn't really fit in much once he gets there, but he falls in with a group of odd, outcast malcontents. Their leader (uncredited on IMDB, and the film itself didn't subtitle many of the credits) tells Ton the story of Vichien (Sirachuch Chienthaworn in his screen debut), the kid who last had Ton's bed, and his somewhat mysterious demise. Soon after, Vichien appears to Ton, helping him out against school bullies and the like, and eventually becoming his friend. While there is a mystery subplot (Ton tries to find out how Vichien truly died, for Vichien refuses to speak of it), that's a minor consideration; this is a story about high school friendship.Comparisons to The Devil's Backbone were inevitable, I guess, especially since a pool features prominently in the movie. While the two movies share certain thematic elements, they are entirely different. (The Devil's Backbone really is a horror film on occasion, where this never crosses over the ""drama"" line.) There's nothing in here your kids wouldn't be able to handle, and in fact I've read a few reviews that specifically talk about how much their kids like this movie. It's solid from beginning to end, the acting is fine, the direction is up to the material (Sugmakanan was later tabbed to direct the second installment of the 4bia series of anthology films, wildly popular in southeast Asia, and justifiably so). Well worth your time.

1055103,A3PZ0H4BMZOFRT,B000NA21RM,ShowBizBuff,"[3, 3]","Wow, is the marketing and even cover art for the DVD of this film misleading. I first spotted the film on Netflix, and by the photo and description shown expected this Thai film to be a creepy little ghost story on the scale of something like Ringu, Ju-on: The Grudge - or maybe even a Thai counterpart like Shutter.When in reality, Dek hor - or Dorm - is so much more, and actually gets cheated by its own marketing ... which doesn't speak for the sensitive, tender, and emotionally involving ghost story the film truly is. Oh sure, there are a few chills and even semi-eerie moments in Dorm - but that's not what you'll leave this film remembering. What you will remember are the characters, the story, and the heartbeat this terrific ghost story has at its core ... as seen mostly through the eyes of lead actor Charlie Trairat - a child actor whose talent bears more emotional clout than most actors three times his age.Trairat plays Ton Chatree, a twelve-year-old boy on semester break from his school, when he learns that his father has decided to send him to a different school - a private school - as soon as the current term reconvenes. Unable to even finish the rest of the school year with his friends, Chatree -used to doing what he wants, when he wants - at first finds the rules and constraints of his new, all-boy school very hard to bear ... in particular the chilly, always-frowning and oddly sad headmistress, Ms. Pranee (Chintara Sukapatana). Chatree eats with all the other boys, sleeps in the crowded dorm room on a cot with all the other boys, bathes in a sort of community bathhouse-style ""shower"" with all the other boys - suddenly his world is on a schedule, with time constraints and all sorts of rules, and Chatree is one unhappy kid ...... Even before the teasing and name-calling begins, as Chatree is one night treated to series of ghost stories by a small group of boys in the school who all hang out together; stories about a student who drowned in the old pool, one of the cook's daughters who hanged herself when she became pregnant, a ghost that haunts the boys' bathroom at night and makes the dogs all howl in unison, etc. - stories that leave Chatree so afraid to leave his cot at night, he ends up wetting the bed ... making him that much more a target for the other kids.Then, suddenly, Chatree finds a friend in a funny, kindhearted kid name Vichien (Sirachuch Chienthaworn) - a friend who seems genuinely interested in Chatree's life and world, and in turn shows Chatree not only around the school, but also teaches him how to find/steal geese eggs, or even where to go outside the school's rather stringent boundaries. It's only at the outdoor screening of an old, so-hokey-it's-funny Thai horror film for the boys, on school grounds, that Chatree learns that not everything is always what it seems - and comes to learn, in the end, just how strong the bonds of friendship can be.To say anything more would be to give away too, too much of the plot of the film - or the several surprises tied into the storylines, which are all revealed by ""the end"". And maybe that's the key word here - ""storylines"" - because this film weaves genuine plot and story and character to make it so much more than just a ghost story. Charlie Trairat is nothing short of brilliant as Chatree, especially for such a young actor, and though the film rests almost entirely on his small shoulders, Trairat proves more than ready to bear the weight of Chatree's growth into his first steps into adulthood by the film's end. Sirachuch Chienthaworn is equally moving as Vichien, perfectly complimenting Chatree; indeed, the bond of genuine friendship that grows between these two students never seems fake or forced. Dorm is not a scary movie; it may make you jump in a couple of spots, but there are no long-haired ghosts ratcheting down stairwells like crabs, or little girls thrown into wells to drown.No, Dorm just happens to be a tale of friendship, love, and the sacrifices you make for both ... that also happens to be a very moving ghost story that left tears in my eyes by ""the end"". I admit to never having seen The Devil's Backbone, to which this film is constantly compared to for its basic storyline - but am glad I haven't, because in the end Dorm stands alone for its moodiness and story and ultimate message. And for Charlie Trairat, one of the best young actors I've ever seen. Early on in the film, as he eats his dinner with the camera up close on his face, a lone tear trickles down Trairat's cheek that he brusquely wipes away with his arm - and in that one scene alone, with no dialogue, Trairat will endear Chatree and his and Vichien's story to your heart forever.

1055106,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000NA21RM,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[11, 12]","Dorm is from the producers of the Thai Horror hit ""SHUTTER"". Some people say that ""DORM"" has a lot of similarities of Guillermo Del Toro's Spanish horror cult hit ""The Devil's Backbone"" which makes it a rip-off while some say this film was meant as a tribute film to the mentioned original by Del Toro, other articles say that Dorm is based on the producers' experiences as a child. Who's to say what is true and what is a publicity stunt? Whatever the motivation for all the discussions, Dorm did get people in Asia talking, so much that the film won numerous awards in Thailand. I've seen a lot of Asian horror films. One formula kind of lost its effect is the ""Vengeful Longed haired ghost"", I'm happy to say that Dorm doesn't have one such supernatural entity.The movie starts when Ton Chatree gets transferred to an all boys school by his father so that Ton can concentrate more on his studies, away form watching too much TV and such. Ton believes his father has hidden motives, so he starts holding a grudge towards him. Being the new kid in school, Ton became the recipient of practical jokes and told made up ghost stories regarding the dormitory for boys. The boy becomes very unhappy until he befriends another kid, this newfound companion harbors a dark secret, one that Ton Chatree becomes determined to help his good friend.Being asian myself, I can relate to the events in Ton's life. Even some of the urban legends involving spirits are things that I've heard about as a kid. Unlike other Asian horror flicks, there is no ""vengeful spirit"", no blood and gore, and in this film no one dies because of spirit's wrong doing. Dorm is more about friendship and caring about others to the point of risking oneself. Upon watching this film, instead of being scared(which is why most people watch horror films) you can't help but be a bit moved by the story.Now, the film is not perfect, it takes the formulas of other supernatural horror hits like ""The Sixth Sense"", and the aforementioned ""The Devil's Backbone"".PICTURE: Anamorphic WIDESCREEN 1.78. Nothing spectacular with Tartan's transfer, the image was a bit on the softer side, lacking in contrast and sharpness. The colors were dull, but the transfer was very clean.AUDIO/Subtitles: 5.1 Dolby Digital/5.1 DTS in Thai Langauge. Subtitles are in 2 languages. The English subs were well translated and timing was good.EXTRAS: Deleted scenes, making of featurette/commentary, Trailers, Character bios, SFX ""below the pool"" docos.In Closing:DORM may not be a perfect film because of its controversy with the similarities to Del Toro's horror hit, but it is indeed watchable and quite frankly, better than the other garbage out there.
