1199191,A32VWXHV4FCKUL,B001H5X6OE,Old Softy,"[8, 9]","This story has some of the same flavor as ""A Grandpa for Christmas.""Tom Bosley is his usual wonderfully warm and wise self as he relates to his spunky and spicy granddaughter, played by Jordy Benattar. Actually, he is raising her in the emotional and often physical absence of the girl's father, who buries himself in his work to avoid dealing with his heartbreak over losing his wife.I don't want to give away any more details and spoil the movie for those who may want to buy it, but this movie is truly heartwarming and a real tear-jerker. It is well worth your money.

I must say that the little girl didn't appeal to me very much, but it wasn't her acting, it was the character in and of itself. Regardless of why she was that way in the film, I have trouble accepting a know-it-all child, and that made it all the more difficult to feel very much emotion for her ordeal. At any rate, Tom Bosley is the star of this film, rightly so, and it's a good watch on a nice Sunday afternoon.",5,Outstanding,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,450,"['warm', 'wonderful', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'little', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'very', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'character', 'Regardless', 'why', 'was', 'way', 'film', 'have', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'know-it-all', 'child', 'made', 'more', 'difficult', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'emotion', 'ordeal', 'rate', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'star', 'film', 'rightly', 'so', 'good', 'watch', 'nice', 'Sunday', 'afternoon']",Charlie and Me
