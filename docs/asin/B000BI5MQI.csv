942540,A2N84VEBTQFDSU,B000BI5MQI,"C.J. Roger ""C.J. Roger""","[2, 2]","Once you watch these, you will be hooked. Whether it's to bash it, laugh along with it or at it, or to even..*gasp* love it, it really has something for everyone.R. Kelly has brilliantly come up with a story that is just so non-sensical and ridiculous that you can't help but to be caught up in it. What starts as a simple one night cheating session turns into one of the most complicated and twisted stories ever. It seems that the main character played by R. Kelly isn't the only one sleeping around. As each song comes to a close we find out there is yet another twist to look forward to in the next chapter of the song. And more and more people get involved into the never ending tale.I'll admit it, flat out. I'm not a fan of R&B; music or R. Kelly. But something drew me to this ""urban opera"" as Kelly proudly calls this that now makes me a fan of R. Kelly. This is something that I think someone from any background or origin can get into. It is almost like watching the WWE or a soap opera in the morning just with a musical theme to it. And the music is actually fun. While the song comes off more like speaking to a tune with a rhyme to it, it has a great beat and sound to it that keeps everything flowing well together in each chapter. And you can't take it seriously. Of course the events that go on in each chapter are silly and far fetched. He touches on a little bit of everything. Cheating, gay couples, dwarfs, convicts, nosey neighbors, his great impression of a white southern house wife and even the crooked cop shows up. You name it and it shows up in these videos. There are some part that are laugh out loud funny while other parts that just make you wonder where he came up with some of this as it is so forced and strange to suddenly be showing up. But they don't try to be a serious take on urban life, it is more of a mocumentary of just weird occurances. Anyone taking this too seriously shouldn't be watching this as that is not at all what this is trying to portray. If anything it seems like its just having fun through music and corny situations and it's a very unique and fun experience for the most part.If it weren't for the silliness and just drawn out situations that this gets into as we get deeper into the story this would easily be a five star recomendation. But that's not to say that this is not worth checking out and owning. I think anyone who likes some good music, some fun situations and something you will definitely watch more then once, you can't go wrong here. There is a reason why this has been spoofed and referenced in so many places. Its just that original and fresh and unique an idea that R. Kelly came up with here, that it is hard not to get addicted to these videos and the music as well. I won't say this deserves an award or anything for great music and acting but I will say I was very pleasently surprised when I saw it for myself. R. Kelly in his own way has come up with something here and I say don't judge it till you see it. Whether you cringe, laugh or get into the music, you will find something to enjoy with his Urban Opera.

Lucky for me I have people who tell me when I need to scale back or have veered in the wrong direction.  ""Trapped In The Closet"" started off as a radio saga that had the nation glued to the radio for the first time in decades waiting for the next chapter to be released.  R. Kelly decided not to end the saga at Chapter 5 (the first 5 chapters are on his album ""TP3 re-loaded."").  The DVD includes all of the chapters up to 12.  Twelve doesn't end the saga either, it ends on a cliffhanger.  The story got old or rushed.  Perhaps Kellz got writers block.  Perhaps it was the pressure to follow the success of the first five chapters.  Somewhere around chapter 7 the story gets straight silly.  In later chapters Kellz introduces a white woman with a southern accent (which he butchers himself), and a midget.  Sylvester escapes the drama only to return to the drama by choice.  It's mad silly but you will want to watch it to the end.It would have been nice if someone would have told Kellz to stick with the drama of the situation verses turning a decent piece into a slapstick vignette filled with overacting and ""who cut the cheese"" type of comments when one character claims to have let one loose in his pants.Anyway, the DVD includes the first 12 chapters, R. Kelly's commentary and a few other things.

Trapped in the Closet is downright terrible.  The plot holes are gaping.  Small children could fall into the plot holes, so watch out.  He also makes it seem that any married couple or serious relationship will end with infidelity and cheating of some kind, a sad comment from R. Kelly.  His characters are cartoonish, especially Brigette the white trash wife and Big Man the midget, and it seems that no one is happy.  However, this movie is worth a viewing.Why?  Because it's so bad it has to be watched.  This will go down in college dorms as the movie everyone has seen because it's just that terrible.  The best part, though, is the director's commentary.  As if R. Kelly hasn't made this movie rediculous enough, the director's commentary is him watching the movie with us and explaining the plot to us as though we were not watching it and we had never seen it before.  Below are just some of the gems R. Kelly comes up with during the commentary, all of which help us to further understand this movie:""How many people come home from prison and -- my goodness!-- get shot?""""That's the cliffhanger, the fact that it wasn't a cliffhanger.""""James loves pears and honey.""""For a slice to be missing makes you wonder because she's allergic to cherries.  It's a cliff hanger!""""Big man has a lot of cliff hangers going on with his character.""""It's a global closet thing.""""It's almost like the Ghost of Christmas here.""Yep, R.
