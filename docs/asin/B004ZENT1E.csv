1434599,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B004ZENT1E,A. Gammill,"[2, 2]","While classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny to Garfield the cat are busy getting (largely unwelcome) 21st century makeovers, it's comforting to see MGM allowing Tom & Jerry to pretty much remain themselves in a series of direct-to-videos features.  Even as the stories are getting more ambitious (such as in the duo's previous releaseTom & Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes [Blu-ray]), the beloved cat-and-mouse team has remained mostly unchanged.So here we find them inserted into one of the most-loved stories of all time.  For longtime fans like myself, the very title alone brings shivers of anticipation.  Tom and Jerry combined with the Wizard of Oz?  How can you go wrong?  And as others have pointed out, this is isn't simply the L. Frank Baum ""Oz"" story, it's the defintive MGM film version that is being utilized.Right there at the Gale farm among Dorothy, Toto and those hired hands, we find Tom and Jerry.  And they're not just tagging along; Auntie Em tells the pair to be sure and ""look out for Dorothy"" right before the tornado strikes.  From there, the story unfolds almost exactly as it does in the film version.  This is both a great asset AND a bit of a liability, however.  The only real problem I have with this otherwise entertaining and very well-animated film is that things happen a bit too fast.  It's as if the writers are saying ""OK, we all know what happens in Munchkinland, so we can just skip over that.""  And Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road is also very abbreviated; indeed, the cat and mouse (who've picked up a Munchkin mouse, the only other real deficit here) arrive too late to see Dorothy meeting the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion.The voicework and animation are all top-notch, especially for a made-for-video feature.  And if you overlook the stuff I mentioned above, you'll likely to have a good time.  Like all the previous Tom & Jerry features, it's perfectly safe for kids.  There's even some kid-friendly activities in the bonus materials.  Oh, and be sure to watch the film with the sepia-toned opening scenes (listed here, oddly, as a bonus feature) to get the real classic Wizard of Oz effect.Recommended for fans of T & J and The Wizard of Oz.",4,"Very entertaining, but should have been longer",1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2198,"['classic', 'cartoons', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Garfield', 'cat', 'are', 'busy', 'getting', 'largely', 'unwelcome', '21st', 'century', 'makeovers', 'comforting', 'see', 'MGM', 'allowing', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'pretty', 'much', 'remain', 'series', 'direct-to-videos', 'features', 'Even', 'stories', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'ambitious', 'such', 'duo', 'previous', 'releaseTom', 'Jerry', 'Meet', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'beloved', 'cat-and-mouse', 'team', 'remained', 'mostly', 'unchanged.So', 'here', 'find', 'inserted', 'one', 'most-loved', 'stories', 'time', 'longtime', 'fans', 'very', 'title', 'alone', 'shivers', 'anticipation', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'combined', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', ""n't"", 'simply', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'Oz', 'story', 'defintive', 'MGM', 'film', 'version', 'being', 'utilized.Right', 'there', 'Gale', 'farm', 'Dorothy', 'Toto', 'hired', 'hands', 'find', 'Tom', 'Jerry', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'tagging', 'along', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'pair', 'be', 'sure', 'look', 'out', 'Dorothy', 'right', 'tornado', 'strikes', 'there', 'story', 'almost', 'exactly', 'film', 'version', 'great', 'asset', 'bit', 'liability', 'however', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'have', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'very', 'well-animated', 'film', 'things', 'happen', 'bit', 'too', 'fast', 'writers', 'are', 'saying', 'OK', 'know', 'what', 'Munchkinland', 'can', 'just', 'skip', 'over', 'Dorothy', 'journey', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road', 'also', 'very', 'abbreviated', 'indeed', 'cat', 'mouse', 'who', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'up', 'Munchkin', 'mouse', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'deficit', 'here', 'arrive', 'too', 'late', 'see', 'Dorothy', 'meeting', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Cowardly', 'Lion.The', 'voicework', 'animation', 'are', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'made-for-video', 'feature', 'overlook', 'stuff', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'previous', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'perfectly', 'safe', 'kids', 'even', 'kid-friendly', 'activities', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Oh', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'film', 'sepia-toned', 'opening', 'scenes', 'listed', 'here', 'oddly', 'bonus', 'feature', 'get', 'real', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'effect.Recommended', 'fans', 'T', 'J', 'Wizard', 'Oz']",Tom and Jerry & The Wizard of Oz

1434607,A26O0T192IBKY1,B004ZENT1E,J. Alford,"[3, 4]","Two of MGM's most enduring properties have been the Tom And Jerry cartoons, and the 1939 movie of The Wizard Of Oz. So it was possibly only a matter of time when it was decided to merge both of them in one production. Tom And Jerry And The Wizard Of Oz is a new title from Warner Home Video in their ongoing series of Tom And Jerry animated flicks that takes a cue from Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead where this story takes place in the context of the original movie story, but Tom and Jerry could've been seen as secondary characters who get taken along for the ride along, with a few of the other regular Tom And Jerry characters making cameos.In this storyline Tom and Jerry are workers on the Gale farm(but not farm animals!), and promise Aunt Em to stop fighting to watch after Dorothy(apparently Toto isn't smart enough to do that!). But then, the twister carries them along with Dorothy and Toto to Oz, where Tom And Jerry are informed by a Munchkin mouse named Tuffy about Dorothy's arrival. The three of them head down the Yellow Brick Road, and get into a situation at a bridge similar to the Kalidah scene from the book. After getting hassled by some crows come, they across the Wicked Witch of the West(convincingly voiced Laraine Newman), who gets her wand broken for her troubles. After getting reunited with Dorothy and her three new friends, they go to the Emerald City. They get into the usual schpeel of touring the city while meeting the Wizard, and revieve their marching orders to go get the Witch's broom. Dorothy gets captured by the flying monkeys, so Tom and Jerry disguise themselves as Winkie guards to sneak in the Witch's castle. They discover Droopy working there as an instructor, and get chased all over the place only to find him wherever they hide at, but eventually find out the Witch's weakness to water. Tom, Jerry, and Tuffy then go through an exuberantly long routine to get a bucket of water, and then finally splash it on the Witch. They then return to the E.C. to reveal that the Wizard's a fake. He agrees to take Dorothy back home by balloon, although she misses her flight. Glinda shows up to give the deus ex machina of getting everyone back to Kansas.I have to admit I did like this to an extent. They managed to make it a good balance between one of the numerous Tom And Jerry made-for-video animated movies and the original Wizard Of Oz. The film also gives the Oz regulars a good look, although I thought Dorothy might've looked a little too much like a Disney princess. It was directed by Spike Bradt who has done other Tom And Jerry features as well as some of the current Looney Tunes shows, and his appreciation for classic 50s-60s cartoons shows in this production. It's a good watch at least for a rental or whenever its on TV for regular Oz fans, although most modern day youngins might not totally appreciate it.",3,MGM icons unite!,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2877,"['Two', 'MGM', 'most', 'enduring', 'properties', 'have', 'been', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoons', '1939', 'movie', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'possibly', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'decided', 'merge', 'one', 'production', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'new', 'title', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'ongoing', 'series', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'animated', 'flicks', 'cue', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'Are', 'Dead', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'context', 'original', 'movie', 'story', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seen', 'secondary', 'characters', 'who', 'get', 'taken', 'along', 'ride', 'few', 'other', 'regular', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'characters', 'making', 'cameos.In', 'storyline', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'are', 'workers', 'Gale', 'farm', 'not', 'farm', 'animals', 'promise', 'Aunt', 'Em', 'stop', 'fighting', 'watch', 'Dorothy', 'apparently', 'Toto', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'do', 'then', 'twister', 'along', 'Dorothy', 'Toto', 'Oz', 'where', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'are', 'informed', 'Munchkin', 'mouse', 'named', 'Tuffy', 'Dorothy', 'arrival', 'three', 'head', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'get', 'situation', 'bridge', 'similar', 'Kalidah', 'scene', 'book', 'getting', 'hassled', 'crows', 'come', 'across', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'convincingly', 'voiced', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'who', 'wand', 'broken', 'troubles', 'getting', 'reunited', 'Dorothy', 'three', 'new', 'friends', 'go', 'Emerald', 'City', 'get', 'usual', 'schpeel', 'touring', 'city', 'meeting', 'Wizard', 'revieve', 'marching', 'orders', 'go', 'get', 'Witch', 'broom', 'Dorothy', 'captured', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'so', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'disguise', 'Winkie', 'guards', 'sneak', 'Witch', 'castle', 'discover', 'Droopy', 'working', 'there', 'instructor', 'get', 'chased', 'place', 'only', 'find', 'wherever', 'hide', 'eventually', 'find', 'out', 'Witch', 'weakness', 'water', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Tuffy', 'then', 'go', 'exuberantly', 'long', 'routine', 'get', 'bucket', 'water', 'then', 'finally', 'splash', 'Witch', 'then', 'return', 'E.C', 'reveal', 'Wizard', 'fake', 'take', 'Dorothy', 'back', 'home', 'balloon', 'flight', 'Glinda', 'up', 'give', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'getting', 'everyone', 'back', 'Kansas.I', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'like', 'extent', 'managed', 'make', 'good', 'balance', 'one', 'numerous', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'made-for-video', 'animated', 'movies', 'original', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'film', 'also', 'Oz', 'good', 'look', 'thought', 'Dorothy', 'might', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Disney', 'princess', 'was', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Bradt', 'who', 'done', 'other', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'current', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'shows', 'appreciation', 'classic', '50s-60s', 'cartoons', 'production', 'good', 'watch', 'least', 'rental', 'whenever', 'TV', 'regular', 'Oz', 'fans', 'most', 'modern', 'day', 'youngins', 'might', 'not', 'totally', 'appreciate']",Tom and Jerry & The Wizard of Oz

1434609,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004ZENT1E,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[2, 3]","""Cartoon Network"" has been playing this unlikely crossover movie for some time now.  Being a ""Tom and Jerry"" and, of course, ""Wizard of Oz"" movie fan, I plopped myself into my easy chair and watched ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" (hereafter T&J;&WOOZ;) one day, curious to see if it would work.  To my delightful surprise, it does, and should satisfy both ""Tom and Jerry"" and ""Wizard of Oz (1939)"" fans.The cartoon is essentially a nearly shot-for-shot duplication of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (including the ""Over the Rainbow"" singing sequence), with Tom and Jerry accidentally tagging along for the ride.  The only scenes missing are Dorothy's first encounters with the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion, plus a few minor others, which was prudent because otherwise it would have inhibited T&J;&WOOZ;'s manic pace.  In this feature, the cat and mouse are mostly allies, trying to help Dorothy get back home to Kansas.  However, every so often, they hilariously get their licks in against each other.  Other ""Tom and Jerry universe"" characters appear, such as Tuffy the Munchkin Mouse, who wants the Wizard to make him taller (SPOILER: The Wizard gives him stilts), Droopy the phlegmatic head of the witch's guard, and Spike the Irish bulldog as a hapless guard trainee who always manages to hit Droopy with his pikestaff.I think both children and adults will enjoy this lightning-paced and even harrowingly suspenseful movie, especially the climactic scene as Tom, Jerry, and Tuffy attempt to get a bucket of water to Dorothy to take care of the Wicked Witch of the West, including lassoing a little storm cloud. It has vintage Tom and Jerry cartoon violence (including lightning jolts) but nothing too upsetting except for really sensitive children.  But somehow TJ&WOOZ; preserves and respects ""Wizard""'s classic stature with fluid, vibrant colors and movement, and even enhances it with the cat and mouse's presence.  The duo are not a sideshow; they truly are integral to ""Wizard""'s plot.  It's kinda like an animated ""Wizard of Oz: The Lost Scenes"".So please relax, ""Wizard of Oz"" movie purists.

1434611,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B004ZENT1E,Monty Moonlight,"[11, 11]","In their newest direct-to-video movie, the classic cat and mouse cartoon team of Tom and Jerry are inserted not merely into the beloved L. Frank Baum story of ""The Wizard of Oz"", but the full-on MGM feature film version, complete with the styles and songs seen in the original film, though completely redone here in traditionally animated format. As Dorothy ends up in the magical land of Oz and on her quest to see the wizard and return home to a farm in Kansas, Tom and Jerry try their best to catch up with her (which they quickly do) and get home too, having made a promise to Auntie Em that they would look after Dorothy and Toto. But, the Wicked Witch of the West is hot on their trails and wants revenge on Tom and Jerry as much as on Dorothy and Toto themselves!WB's original movie, ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" has been high on my wish list ever since I first saw the cover art here on Amazon. As a huge fan of both animation and the original MGM Oz film, I've been patiently but eagerly waiting for it to come out, and now I finally have it in my hands on Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo, and I'm so glad! Is it a perfect production? No, a direct-to-video budget probably would never allow for that, but it's very good in a lot of ways. One of the best things about it is, for certain, the art and animation. The film does a great job replicating the visuals of the classic MGM movie here in cartoon format. It's really neat to see. The animation is just as direct-to-video animation should be. It's not quite theatrical quality, but it's close. I haven't seen any of the other Tom and Jerry direct to video movies yet, so I can't really compare them, aside from the Nutcracker one they did. I would put this on par with that one, though it's been a while since I've seen it. I think the earlier ones might not be as good. Like the Tom and Jerry Nutcracker program, this one has a touch of that Spumco look, but only in the best ways, like how they draw gorgeous girls. Dorothy is an absolute goddess here, which was a big deal for me since Dorothy from the original film was my first crush ever, and one of the best things about animation is the potential to bring drop-dead gorgeous, absolutely perfect female characters to life. They did a fantastic job here, and the women of the Emerald City are jaw-dropping as well, if too briefly seen (you can probably guess where this is; the bit when they are sprucing up the gang before going to see the wizard).There are basically two sides to this story. You are getting an animated version of the classic MGM Oz film, and you're getting a Tom and Jerry adventure (one that is far better and truer to the characters than ""Tom and Jerry the Movie"", but then maybe all these direct-to-video features fit that bill). With that in mind, sometimes you feel you are watching something in the vein of ""Lion King 1"", and sometimes you feel like you're watching an Animaniacs parody. In truth, this film probably SHOULD be more like the latter in terms of the writing. That is where it lets you down a bit. Maybe it was a budget issue that sometimes things seem a bit rushed story/humor wise, but I do feel that some more playful humor should have been worked into the many scenes that are taken directly from the movie. Much of it is nearly word for word, while a bit more spoofing might have worked better to keep the Tom and Jerry story and the original film's story feeling like they were ONE story. There is some of this, thankfully, especially in scenes with the villains, and it's enough, but more would have been better, I think. I also can't help but feel that maybe they should have used a Garland recording for the performance of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", because how can you really replace her for that? But I guess that is being a bit nit-picky. Over all, this is an excellent direct-to-video film, and I just wish it was longer. It clocks in at just under an hour (59 minutes, according to the cover), and that's a bit short for a 20 dollar flick. Plus, a lot of scenes that weren't shown (from the original Oz film) were very missed. We don't even see Dorothy meeting any of her Oz friends. The group is assembled by the time Tom and Jerry catch up to them. It might have been better to lengthen the film by just keeping Tom and Jerry at Dorothy and Toto's side from the beginning instead of having to catch up with them late after the tornado, but actually, I think the scene that, for some reason, I missed the most here was the one at the beginning in Professor Marvel's Wagon. It just seemed like it was supposed to be there. Oh well. Aside from the shortness and times when I felt the writing could have been more clever, I was very pleased with a lot of the humor that WAS included and that felt very true to the classic MGM cartoon spirit, like the bit where Tom meet's Tuffy and gets hit with the frying pan, and when he and Jerry encounter Droopy and do one of Droopy's best routines with an Oz flare. No, this film isn't perfect, but it's still a big win that was well worth waiting for, and as others have said, it's worth owning for the visuals alone! The voice cast, though not the best sound-alikes I've heard, were also great (okay, Tuffy's a little annoying though; I prefer the sweet, French-accented Tuffy), and thank you so much for keeping Tom and Jerry silent, as they should be for the most part!As for the Blu-Ray itself, it's a little disappointing that there are only 2 bonus features, and one is actually not a bonus feature but an alternate version of the film. I'm so glad that alternate version was included though. It SHOULD be the primary version of the film, because it is the way you SHOULD watch ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"". It's a version of the film with the beginning and ending in sepia tones, as in the original MGM feature. It IS cool to have the full color version as well, but THAT is the version that should be in the special features section. As for the other bonus, it's a little science lesson of 3 activities that are Oz related. Making your own tornado in a bottle, making a rainbow, and how a hot air balloon works (which could have been demonstrated better, I think), they're cute and probably fun for kids, but where are the classic MGM shorts as bonus features? That's what you SHOULD have here, or a little making-of documentary.All in all, ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"" is a great little movie, though it may seem a bit pricey for being just about an hour and so light on bonus features. Still, if that is how they keep things at this quality, I'll pay it. Some of the writing could have been snappier, but it was still great and worth the purchase, especially if you're a fan of Oz and/or Tom and Jerry! Now, if they would just release that Saturday morning animated series that was based on the MGM Oz film. I think it was on in the early 90's, but not certain about that.",5,Tom and Jerry go Over the Rainbow!,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,6918,"['newest', 'direct-to-video', 'movie', 'classic', 'cat',

1434614,ASMXWECF2HR6H,B004ZENT1E,"R. Gorey ""Behemoth""","[3, 4]","Caught this the other night on Pay Per View, and didn't quite know what to think. Some incredibly faithful artwork and direction uncannily re-creates the feeling and look of the 1939 film, (though sadly the first ten minutes are not sepia toned: an odd misstep). Animation is wonderful, and very much echoes the late forties and early fifties MGM ""T&J"" shorts. Droopy, Spike, Red, and others appear, but somehow this new ""Tom and Jerry"" effort doesn't ring the same bells as their previous ""Sherlock Holmes"" outing, possibly because the Judy Garland film is so sacred to so many people. Many fans may resent the new recording and performance of ""Over the Rainbow"".To devotees of Judy's iconic version, this new iteration may feel like an insult, though it's well done. I'm guessing this scene is the thing most will be curious to see. Settings, credits, backgrounds, and music (lifted from the original ""Oz"") ape that film in some remarkable ways. Larraine Newman does a fine job as the voice of the Wicked Witch...but Tom and Jerry feel intrusive here, and their slapstick, welcome in the Sherlock Holmes film, doesn't quite come off. For completists, well...you'd have to own this, and the art is really sharp. Animation fans will respond to the carefully intricate character work. But  this had the feeling of shrewd marketing, despite polished and handsome production values. Why ""Tom and Jerry"" and ""Oz""? Both are MGM properties, so the leap isn't really as vast as some may think. Now they should do ""Tom and Jerry meet Carrie"" (since MGM owns that film now, too). We're waiting...
