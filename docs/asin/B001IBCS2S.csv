People who view the Bible as being the Word of God may be offended by portions of it, but those of a more inquisitive mind are likely to be intrigued. I was particularly impressed by the Israeli archaeologists, a most intelligent and inquisitive group (I am not Jewish) and found the ultimate (tentative) conclusion about the source of the Jews compelling.

This program, unlike most of them, does not start out with a pre-conceived position and try to prove it. The producers simply look at the evidence found by the archeologists and let them present the conclusions drawn from what they find. It is fortunate for them, and us, that the ancient Egyptians wrote their history in stone.",5,Only from Nova,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,435,"['have', 'watched', 'many', 'hours', 'programing', 'exploring', 'history', 'land', 'peoples', 'middle', 'east', 'program', 'most', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'pre-conceived', 'position', 'try', 'prove', 'producers', 'simply', 'look', 'evidence', 'found', 'archeologists', 'let', 'present', 'conclusions', 'drawn', 'what', 'find', 'fortunate', 'ancient', 'Egyptians', 'wrote', 'history', 'stone']",N/A

Neither an attempt to prove nor disprove the holy scriptures, it aims rather to triangulate by searching the historical and archeological record for independent evidence that could verify the most famous episodes of the Old Testament. Perhaps most illuminating is the theory of the real story behind the Exodus (and especially intriguing for fans like myself of Cecil B. DeMille's epic 1956 version of ""The Ten Commandments""). In short, highly recommended for believers and nonbelievers alike.",5,Between Hollywood and Sunday School,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,574,"['Somewhere', 'Hollywood', 'Sunday', 'school', 'Bible', 'Buried', 'Secrets', 'attempt', 'prove', 'disprove', 'holy', 'rather', 'triangulate', 'searching', 'historical', 'archeological', 'record', 'independent', 'evidence', 'could', 'verify', 'most', 'famous', 'episodes', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'illuminating', 'theory', 'real', 'story', 'Exodus', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'fans', 'myself', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'epic', '1956', 'version', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'short', 'highly', 'recommended', 'believers', 'nonbelievers', 'alike']",N/A

This documentary actually states that some of the Bible stories are probably myths. They try to back up this statement by saying there is no archeological evidence to support most of these stories. I would say that is a pretty strong statement to try and disprove the Bible. They use the lack of evidence for the Exodus as an example, but this is so far from the truth. Especially since there is strong archeological evidence to support the Exodus. If you want to check out any of those videos, search for these two films.1) The Exodus Revealed2) The Search for the Real Mount Sinai",1,Very Misleading...,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,682,"['One', 'reviews', 'PBS', 'good', 'job', 'staying', 'down', 'middle', 'would', 'disagree', 'documentary', 'actually', 'Bible', 'stories', 'are', 'probably', 'myths', 'try', 'back', 'up', 'statement', 'saying', 'archeological', 'evidence', 'support', 'most', 'stories', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'strong', 'statement', 'try', 'disprove', 'Bible', 'use', 'lack', 'evidence', 'Exodus', 'example', 'so', 'far', 'truth', 'Especially', 'strong', 'archeological', 'evidence', 'support', 'Exodus', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'videos', 'search', 'two', 'films.1', 'Exodus', 'Revealed2', 'Search', 'Real', 'Mount', 'Sinai']",N/A

Ko ""Walter Ko""","[2, 4]","The Nova PBS 2-hour documentary is a comprehensive, educational and archeological guide to how, when and where the Hebrew Bible was composed.  It is interesting to know more about the ""good book"" and history.  Is it God's will or man's will?  The faith of Abraham created Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Holy Land and the love your neighbors as yourself tradition does not have peace.  However, a group of Jews came to Kaifeng, China and settled peacefully without being persecuted.  They willingly joined the Chinese family with the family name changed to Chinese, with inter-racial marriage.The Bible had been the beacon of western tradition.
