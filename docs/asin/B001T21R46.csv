The plot sounded OK, but what really piqued my interest was the cast in The Great Bank Robbery, one of two films on the disk: Zero Mostel,Sam Jaffe, Akim Tamiroff, Kim Novak, Claude Akins,Larry Storch, Bob Steele and a host of other seasoned veteran actors. It was extremely funny and very campy(reminds me of The Gambler Returns and TGR:Luck Of The Draw with Kenny Rogers); Granted, this was not the Zero Mostel version of The Producers, but I had a hard time not laughing at almost every scene. As for the disk and packaging: The packaging was fine and disk quality was excellent: Crisp video,good color and clear audio. The ""b"" class visuals were the artwork/presentation of the opening and closing credits;  The Rembrandt effect was captured in the bank mural used in the film (you have to see the film to know what I'm referring to). I still have to watch the second film on the disk.

1235446,A142UV53K381N9,B001T21R46,David H. Birley,"[1, 1]","These movies are not meant to be great cinematographic art. They vary from mildly amusing to wildly amusing. The Great Bank Hoax involves a simple plot to steal money form a bank by the ruse of some tricky book-keeping, some romancing of the mamager's comely daughter. However the higher up officers decide that this is their chance to make the big score and steal some real money. Light and frothy, but harmlessly entertaining. The Great Bank Robbery is a much wilder and way over the top piece of work starring Zero Mostel and a cast of other Hollywood comic stalwarts. It is meant to be a spoof of the Western bank robbery gendre, and manages to keep you laughing all the way through. Larry Storch is out to plese his poppa by raiding the bank while Zero and his team are creating an illusion including a Lady Godiva ride by Kim Novak (kept G rated by aproppriate distribution of a magnificent wig). Zero Mostel as a faux preacher is at the top of his game here.The four stars here are a distribution of three for ""Hoax"" and five for ""Robbery"".

1235448,AU10YGO10MUCA,B001T21R46,Gary Lee,"[0, 0]","THE GREAT BANK ROBBERY is a Hollywood product of its times, a Warner Brothers offering of the late 60's,  It has that same look and feel as THE GREAT RACE, made at Warners four years earlier.  It wouldn't surprise me if even some of the props from that earlier film found their way into this much smaller scale production.The script has a tantalizing premise:  unbeknowst to each other, three different gangs of bandits simultaneously converge on a small town bank that specializes in holding stolen gold.  The banker, who poses as a pillar of the town while hoarding the stolen booty, prides himself on the bank's impregnability.  But the psycho train robber who deposits said gold trusts nobody.  William Peter Blatty (who wrote THE EXORCIST) penned this script, but he and the director can't quite deliver the heights of hilarity the story promises as these parties all converge on the small town of Friendly.But the script hardly matters.  The performances carry the film.  The great cast is over the top throughout as they steal scenes from one another.  Hard to say who comes off the craziest.  Zero Mostel as the ringleader of the gang posing as missionaries, and Larry Storch as the bumbling idiot son of the leader of the Mexican banditos are, as always, way over the limit as performers.  Their histrionics are no surprise.  Grady Sutton is his usual befuddled self as the preacher who gets run out of town.  Elisha Cook, Jr. is, as always, a bundle of neuroses as the psycho robber's side kick.  The real delight comes from watching Claude Akins come unhinged as the trigger happy robber with a streak of self-examination (&#34;Why do I kill everyone I love?&#34; he asks himself), Ruth Warrick as a schoolmarmish town matron who unravels as she falls head over heels for Mostel, and Mako as the exasperated philosophy-spouting head of the Chinese gang.Some of the best laughs come from Clint Walker's deft performance as the baffled, not-to-be trifled with deputy who's out to--well, who knows? since he gets waylaid by a truly loony Kim Novak at her seductive best.  Novak shows plenty of skin, especially in her Lady Godiva ride on a white horse through town (she says she wore a body stocking).  Even though she had turned her back on stardom three years earlier after complaining that she was viewed as nothing but a sexpot in her Hollywood heyday, she's not afraid to flaunt it, and at 36 she looks sensational.Probably top honors for scenery chewing go to Akim Tamiroff as the long-suffering head of the Mexican raiders.  But it's Walker I'll remember best from this film.  He proves himself far more than a slab of beefcake (though he shows some skin here, too, in the picnic scene with Novak).  Yes, there are a lot of ethnic stereotypes in the film (at least no Hollywood Indians get in the act, Marlon Brando can relax), and the Vietnam War was heating up, but if you take this bit of escapism as a lively romp in ensemble acting by some of Hollywood's best (Warrick was in CITIZEN KANE, after all, Cook in THE MALTESE FALCON, Tamiroff in TOUCH OF EVIL, Sam Jaffe in BEN-HUR.  And Novak, of course, in VERTIGO) it's an amusing hour and a half watching these movie heavyweights take time off from Great Cinema to have fun in front of the camera being nutty with help from some of the leading lights of TV (Walker) and Broadway (Mostel).",3,Hollywood Greats Go Over the Top,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,3357,"['GREAT', 'BANK', 'ROBBERY', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'times', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'offering', 'late', '60', 'same', 'look', 'feel', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RACE', 'made', 'Warners', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'even', 'props', 'earlier', 'film', 'found', 'way', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'production.The', 'script', 'tantalizing', 'premise', 'unbeknowst', 'other', 'three', 'different', 'gangs', 'bandits', 'simultaneously', 'converge', 'small', 'town', 'bank', 'holding', 'stolen', 'gold', 'banker', 'who', 'pillar', 'town', 'hoarding', 'stolen', 'booty', 'bank', 'impregnability', 'psycho', 'train', 'robber', 'who', 'said', 'gold', 'trusts', 'nobody', 'William', 'Peter', 'Blatty', 'who', 'wrote', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'penned', 'script', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'heights', 'hilarity', 'story', 'parties', 'converge', 'small', 'town', 'Friendly.But', 'script', 'hardly', 'matters', 'performances', 'carry', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'top', 'steal', 'scenes', 'one', 'Hard', 'say', 'who', 'craziest', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'ringleader', 'gang', 'posing', 'missionaries', 'Larry', 'Storch', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'son', 'leader', 'Mexican', 'banditos', 'are', 'always', 'way', 'limit', 'performers', 'histrionics', 'are', 'surprise', 'Grady', 'Sutton', 'usual', 'befuddled', 'preacher', 'who', 'run', 'town', 'Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr.', 'always', 'bundle', 'neuroses', 'psycho', 'robber', 'side', 'kick', 'real', 'delight', 'watching', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'come', 'unhinged', 'trigger', 'happy', 'robber', 'streak', 'self-examination', '34', 'Why', 'do', 'kill', 'everyone', 'love', '34', 'Ruth', 'Warrick', 'schoolmarmish', 'town', 'matron', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'Mostel', 'Mako', 'exasperated', 'philosophy-spouting', 'head', 'Chinese', 'gang.Some', 'best', 'laughs', 'come', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'deft', 'performance', 'baffled', 'not-to-be', 'trifled', 'deputy', 'who', 'out', 'well', 'who', 'waylaid', 'truly', 'loony', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'seductive', 'best', 'Novak', 'plenty', 'skin', 'especially', 'Lady', 'Godiva', 'ride', 'white', 'horse', 'town', 'wore', 'body', 'stocking', 'Even', 'had', 'turned', 'back', 'stardom', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'complaining', 'was', 'viewed', 'nothing', 'sexpot', 'Hollywood', 'heyday', 'not', 'afraid', 'flaunt', '36', 'sensational.Probably', 'top', 'honors', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'go', 'Akim', 'Tamiroff', 'long-suffering', 'head', 'Mexican', 'raiders', 'Walker', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'best', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'slab', 'beefcake', 'skin', 'here', 'too', 'picnic', 'scene', 'Novak', 'Yes', 'are', 'lot', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'film', 'least', 'Hollywood', 'Indians', 'get', 'act', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'can', 'relax', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'heating', 'up', 'take', 'bit', 'escapism', 'lively', 'romp', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'Warrick', 'was', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'Cook', 'THE', 'MALTESE', 'FALCON', 'Tamiroff', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'EVIL', 'Sam', 'Jaffe', 'BEN-HUR', 'Novak', 'course', 'VERTIGO', 'amusing', 'hour', 'half', 'watching', 'movie', 'heavyweights', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'Great', 'Cinema', 'have', 'fun', 'front', 'camera', 'being', 'nutty', 'help', 'leading', 'lights', 'TV', 'Walker', 'Broadway', 'Mostel']",Bank Robbery Collection: (The Great Bank Hoax / The Great Bank Robbery)

1235450,ANW7ZQSOJQ2A7,B001T21R46,"Richard Muller ""old school audiologist""","[11, 11]","There are a few films out there that not many people have seen... or, at least, haven't seen for ages due to their only recent availability on DVD.  Both titles on this dual movie disc -- ""Bank Robbery Collection"" -- are in that category.""The Great Bank Hoax"" is one of the kinder, gentler stories of theft -- and certainly one which an earlier generation will appreciate for the wonderful performances of screen icons such as Burgess Meredith, Richard Baseheart, Ned Beatty, Michael Murphy, Paul Sand and... Arthur Godfrey?  Seems an error in bookkeeping was the design of an ambitious clerk, though that is not known at the time.  Adjustments have to be made to cover the shortfall, and that takes care of the plot.  And what a cover-up it is!  Simply put, you'll love the adventures of these kindly crooks as they scurry to ""fix things"".An old favorite of mine is ""The Great Bank Robbery""; with the unforgettable Zero Mostel as a less than angelic preacher, leading his flock of crooks to the impregnable bank at 'Friendly' -- the bank of the west's ner-do-well's!  Clint Walker is the undercover lawman set to unlock the secrets of the bank, posing as a laundryman, who, by the way, falls for the preacher's stunning 'mistress', played by a vivacious Kim Novak (""I weigh 120 pounds...""  ""..one-hundred twenty-five!"").  Meanwhile the notorious band of banditos (led by Akim Tamiroff and Larry Storch ""Listen to Papa!!"") tries again and again to do things the hard way.  However, it is the escape that ties the whole plot together -- with a balloon chase Captained by the Great Gregory (""Why do they call you 'Great""?"").  Oh yes; there's music as well: Academy Nominated song ""Rainbow Riders"", sung by Zero and flock.Both films look great on the latest 16 X 9 aspect ratio screens and show good color after all these years, along with good sound.  ""Hoax"" was done in 1978 and ""Robbery"" was circa 1969 -- but renewed copyright by the studio has kept the technical criteria up to date.
