Starring the well-known faces of Joseph Gordon Levitt, Natalie Portman, and Rainn Wilson, I think most indie-film viewers will immediately feel at home.  While being a criminal and a bit of a social deviant, the character of Hesher probably fulfills many of my boyhood dreams of an alternative hero.  I think the little boy inside of me wishes he could one day be Hesher, but I'm pretty sure that'll never happen.  On top of all the Metallica, reckless driving, picking on a little kid, and squatting in a stranger's home - Hesher does one amazing thing.  He forces, and at the same time helps, a family to deal with the loss of a loved one.It's a great film.  I can't recommend it enough.

1447633,A1WIZDOPCT0CX9,B0058ZPMYG,Austin,"[1, 2]","Whoa.Just saw Hesher... Below is my spoiler-free review.Hesher is not a movie I will ever forget... With so many cliched films vomited through my brain, I can guess most of the outcomes of scenes and rarely get surprised anymore. The first time a movie or shot does something different it's surprising to you like the first time you saw the shot of the passenger looking directly at you as a incoming car slams into us! However the second time is not so surprising because you think, `Oh yeah, saw that same shot on Lost.' Years later, the shot doesn't even faze me or spark an adrenaline jolt anywhere near the first time.What the hell does that have to do with Hesher?More than I could have hoped for... It has been years since I've been so surprised by a film. (he last film that surprised me on this scale was The Dark Knight. Actually there's one other film that falls into this category and that's Trollhunter.Shut up and tell me what kind of surprises.Gnarly stuff happen. Stuff I've never seen on screen.Good or bad?Both. This film has brutal parts man. But it also has some of the most hilarious/dramatic moments that had me laughing or gripping the sofa on how uncomfortable or heartbreaking some scenes were. It's not a film that will have you feeling goody all through, it likes to rope the viewer around on the emotional landscapes of the human condition, from loss, sorrow, heartbreak, love, betrayal, friendship, forgiveness, dependence, and anarchy.Anarchy?Lots of it. Stuff I've never thought of before. Hardcore fights. Kids too.Cut to the chase. Is it good?The one thing that really pains me about this film is that it could have been one of the greatest films ever.What? So it's just okay?No! It gets 88/100 on my scale. Very few films get past 80 and even less to 88... what I'm meant is that if they took another stab at editing it they could have made it shorter at some parts and maybe longer at other places because the pacing is difficult to swallow at places.Editing is an artform that has the curse of never reaching perfection, only deadlines. Every single film out there can be better with more editing. I know that's a conversational statement but I have not met one seasoned editor who didn't agree.In conclusion, Hesher is a uncomfortable film. It is also an amazing film but it undeniably feels like an acquired taste. What I mean is that it's definitely not for everyone.

1447634,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0058ZPMYG,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Hesher is probably a thousand times better than I went in expecting.  Not that I expected a terrible film by any means especially after reading an enticing description, but I never would have guessed the quality of the storytelling is *this* extremely high.It's basically about a little boy who gets into trouble by picking fights with older kids and bullies, and in one instance, throws a rock through the window of a young long-haired, lazy, disrespectful heavy metal-loving lowlife that the kid had no right messing with (and who soon becomes the lead character in the movie named Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  As soon as he throws the rock, the man comes out of the house and yanks the kid back inside.  Then the cops arrive so the guy terroizes and surprises the kid by throwing a grenade through the broken window at the cop!  Joseph's character apparently has no concern for the after effects of his actions and throughout the movie manages to escape every tricky and potentially risky stunt he pulls.There's SO many things that occur throughout this movie that just screams interesting, exciting and enticing around every single corner that it'd be unfair to list them all and therefore spoil the film, so let's just say Joseph's character invites himself into the home of the boy one day, lives there, does whatever he wants, and the father and grandmother of the little boy just assume the man is a friend of their son/grandson, lol.  It's really bizarre and yet, ultimately fascinating.  From here, well, the little boy has TWO problems now.  The bully at school who's waiting for the perfect chance to tear the kid apart for writing offensive remarks on his car, and dealing with the long-haired man that suddenly decides to make himself at home and picks on the boy himself.  Poor kid!There wasn't a single second that I turned away in boredom while watching Hesher.  Constant storyline unpredictability and creativity occurred the entire time and that's a rare accomplishment in todays world.  There's also the segment with the cashier lady at the downtown grocery store played by Natalie Portman that the little boy has a crush on, so certain scenes develop between the two of them.  Not necessarily relationship-type segments that you're probably thinking, but more like, well, adventures.  Little awkward adventures around town, shall we say!Some may argue there's not really a point to all these crazy and adventurous events that take place between the little boy, the Joseph's character, the school bully (who also works at the car shop and finds himself involved with the little boy there as well), Natalie Portman's character, the boys father and the boys grandmother.  But I have to disagree, thanks to the ending.  There most certainly is a point, though perhaps not the one you're leaning towards.  A point that comes out of left field.Still, a satisfying conclusion to a very different type of drama story with light touches of comedy, though you probably have to be someone who's not concerned for constant swearing and lots of direct sexual-related talk (even though there's no actual nudity present anywhere).  It's true the language is somewhat offensive in a few segments (especially the one involving Natalie and Joseph's character sitting in a car and talking about sex in a really graphic way before Natalie even introduces herself- Joseph comes across as totally disrespectful the way he talks to the girl in such a tasteless way) but other than that, I'm happy with the film overall.

1447641,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0058ZPMYG,DanD,"[10, 14]","HESHER tells a tale that we've seen before: outcast boy (Devin Brochu) copes with a pill-popping father (Rainn Wilson) and a well-meaning but misunderstood grandmother (Piper Laurie).  He gets picked on by a bully, meets a beautiful outcast girl (Natalie Portman), and befriends a nihilistic loner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  Heartwarming chaos ensues.It took three people to write HESHER, which is a little disturbing, considering the film doesn't have much original to offer.  It's nice to see a film revolving around such a violent character, but the violence is grossly understated and rarely prominent (except for Gordon-Levitt's riveting first scene).  Hesher's potential violence pretty much remains potential, and the inevitable heartwarming end (yes, you knew it was coming, you know it from the second or third scene) undermines any promise the film truly had.Then why three stars?  Because of the performances.  Gordon-Levitt is reliable as always; in his best scenes, he sinks his teeth into Hesher and lets 'er rip.  Brochu does the brooding child thing well, with a delightful hint of menace and vulnerability thrown in for good measure.  Wilson is superb as the father, and Portmant is a little too sexy for her role (we're supposed to believe no one cares about a girl who looks like that?  Really?) but, as always, she makes the best of what she's given.  More kudos go to the always-great Piper Laurie, and John Carroll Lynch (grossly under-used, as always).Ultimately, HESHER is a bit of a let-down.  It doesn't know what it wants to be: bada** flick about conflicted relationships and coping with loss, or feel-good drama with a little dirt rubbed in.  Ultimately, the dirt doesn't break the surface, and HESHER remains little more than a promise unfulfilled.  But see it for the performances, especially the scene between Laurie and Gordon-Levitt--two of the best actors of their respective generations, sharing an intimate moment and playing their talents off one another.

1447647,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0058ZPMYG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 12]","HESHER (2011, 105 minutes) must be one of the most confusing, angering, revolting films I have ever suffered. While it had moments ... I say MERE MOMENTS ... of comic brilliance, it doesn't quite explain what this was supposed to mean. Hence a one-star review because it is mostly an angry, violent and rather disgusting film. It could have been so much more.The title character (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seems to have no actual name aside from Hesher, comes from nowhere and must be one of the most awful characters I have ever seen onscreen or in real life. A violent, angry, destructive hippy, Hesher intrudes on the life of young TJ (a fantastically talented Devin Brochu) who is suffering deeply from the death of his mother.TJ's father Paul (an unusual dramatic turn by Rainn Wilson) is too crippled by depression to do much of anything - thus begins the 'anarchic fun' when Hesher suddenly moves into their garage. While this is mostly Joseph Gordon-Levitt being disgusting and occasionally profound, there are sparkling moments offered by the promising young Devin Brochu.The trouble is, this film goes absolutely nowhere very slowly. Cheap emotional shots meant to semi-cripple the audience give way to some of the most foul language I have heard in my life. It reminded me of some people I used to know and hate back in the day. Even worse, it led nowhere, carried no message, put an innocent (Brochu) in an indecent light, and seemed designed only to offend again and again.The real tragedy here is the emotional manipulation of the audience was either the result of a director on acid (see, this is what LSD does to you, it does NOT make you brilliant or creative, just psychotic) or it's the typical work from the most horribly jaded, stupid production team in history.Perhaps I missed a point in all this nastiness of a film.

The actor playing the father (Rainn Wilson), he's in lots of movies and I think he usually plays in comedies. Hesher is not a comedy but it did make me laugh, a lot.There are several converging story lines in this film.The grandmother who funds everything and silently keeps the family together is dealing silently with end of life issues.The father and son are dealing with the recent death of the wife/mother but really don't explain what happened.The son is being beat up in school by various bullies and bad situations.On his way to school the son encounters a skinny, pale, long haired, dope smoking, tattoo'd homeless guy (Hesher) after he wrecks his bike (again) in a residential construction site.The homeless guy ends up following the boy and pushes his way into their home to do his laundry then wont leave. Hesher hits it off with the grandmother probably because she's lonely and just wants someone to talk to and seemed un-moved by his often shirtless, bizzare, with long haired appearance.The boy seems obsessed with buying their wrecked family car but never explains why. The father is jobless and spends most of the day on the sofa sleeping. Hesher follows the boy around observing him in a series of bad situations. The boy (TJ) yells at Hesher for not helping him, ordering him to stay away again and again, which of course never works.The boy develops a crush on an older grocery store clerk, which Hesher also ruins.And not to spoil the movie, but the story lines all come together in the end as everyone's lives are improved by Hesher's absurd ways.

1447653,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0058ZPMYG,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","An excellent boy film, film about a boy at the sorrow and sad age of twelve or something, when the boy is confronted with real life, that is to say mourning and a boy that age does not know how to deal with mourning. Death maybe, but mourning no. Death is simple. It comes and it is finished. You stay behind and the real thing is starting: mourning.Imagine an accident and you lose a parent and the car. You can mourn the parent or you can just accept the death of that parent and mourn the car. Mourning is a form of love that attaches you to an object or a person that no longer lives or exists. So mourning for a child of twelve is dramatic because he does not see beyond the present and because mourning is for him eternal.He can get attached to a stranger who is going to create havoc around him, that's Hesher, or to a nice young woman who is going to become the substitute of the dead mother, and all the time he is going to be attached to the car in which the mother died, him in the back and his father at the wheel. He does not know what he is doing of course, but he has become a fetishist of the car. And that is sad.And one day another dramatic event will happen and that will bring the crazy friend around and that will bring the world upside down and that will bring the world back onto its feet because it was standing its feet in the air before. And mourning will be finished and closure will be reached and life can start existing again, but unluckily the friend who created that havoc will have disappeared though he will present you with the cadaver of the car on your doorstep.And you can keep that cadaver for ever and ever in your front garden or your back yard, next to your swimming pool if you have one or behind your cherry tree if there is one in your back garden.That's why this film is interesting because it tells you how a boy of 12 years of age or so will find closure for the dramatic event that has sent his mind right upside down under his knees and next to his soles. There is a tremendous empathy in the anger it expresses, I don't mean tell, just your empathy of anger you get out of the story, if you have ever experienced such a loss at such an early age. If you haven't you will never ever be able to really get any event to closure because it will always be foreclosed before it happens, since foreclosure is always before the term of some said period of time.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,The main character does not carry the title: it is DJ,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,2425,"['excellent', 'boy', 'film', 'film', 'boy', 'sorrow', 'sad', 'age', 'twelve', 'something', 'when', 'boy', 'confronted', 'real', 'life', 'say', 'mourning', 'boy', 'age', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'mourning', 'Death', 'maybe', 'mourning', 'Death', 'simple', 'finished', 'stay', 'real', 'thing', 'starting', 'mourning.Imagine', 'accident', 'lose', 'parent', 'car', 'can', 'mourn', 'parent', 'can', 'just', 'accept', 'death', 'parent', 'mourn', 'car', 'Mourning', 'form', 'love', 'object', 'person', 'longer', 'exists', 'So', 'mourning', 'child', 'twelve', 'dramatic', 'not', 'see', 'present', 'mourning', 'eternal.He', 'can', 'get', 'attached', 'stranger', 'who', 'going', 'create', 'havoc', 'Hesher', 'nice', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'going', 'become', 'substitute', 'dead', 'mother', 'time', 'going', 'be', 'attached', 'car', 'mother', 'died', 'back', 'father', 'wheel', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'course', 'become', 'fetishist', 'car', 'sad.And', 'one', 'day', 'dramatic', 'event', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'bring', 'crazy', 'friend', 'around', 'will', 'bring', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'will', 'bring', 'world', 'back', 'feet', 'was', 'standing', 'feet', 'air', 'mourning', 'will', 'be', 'finished', 'closure', 'will', 'be', 'reached', 'life', 'can', 'start', 'existing', 'again', 'unluckily', 'friend', 'who', 'created', 'havoc', 'will', 'have', 'disappeared', 'will', 'present', 'cadaver', 'car', 'doorstep.And', 'can', 'keep', 'cadaver', 'ever', 'ever', 'front', 'garden', 'back', 'yard', 'next', 'swimming', 'pool', 'have', 'one', 'behind', 'cherry', 'tree', 'one', 'back', 'garden.That', 'why', 'film', 'interesting', 'how', 'boy', '12', 'years', 'age', 'so', 'will', 'find', 'closure', 'dramatic', 'event', 'sent', 'mind', 'right', 'down', 'knees', 'next', 'soles', 'tremendous', 'empathy', 'anger', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'tell', 'just', 'empathy', 'anger', 'get', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'loss', 'early', 'age', 'have', ""n't"", 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'get', 'event', 'closure', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'foreclosed', 'foreclosure', 'always', 'term', 'said', 'period', 'time.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

This instant cult classic stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Hesher, who moves in on the Forneys after 13-year-old T.J. (Devin Brochu) inadvertently gets him chased out of the abandoned building he inhabits. Hesher makes an ally of Grandma (Piper Laurie) and becomes the influential male figure in the home by default. He is a rebuke and a disgrace to father Paul (Rainn Wilson), whose life has collapsed after the recent death of his wife. T.J. slowly gravitates towards Hesher though aghast by his lawlessness, which includes assault and battery, vandalism and break-ins, not to mention constant foul language and total disregard for social convention. The conflict develops as T.J. comes across Hesher having sex with his heartthrob, an older girl (Natalie Portman) working at a local supermarket. T.J. and Paul combine to run Hesher off, but his influence on their lives helps them overcome their grief over T.J.'s Mom's death as well as the sudden loss of Grandma. Hesher reappears at Grandma's funeral, and they realize an epiphany in his celebration of life and his ability to adapt and overcome by having no concern whatsoever for the things he cannot change.This may come across to many audiences as a ""Raging Bull"" type flick, an unpalatable, unblinking look at a social neanderthal. For those fascinated by teenage angst as well as those in search of Sundance-type flicks exploring the meaning of life in the dark closets of our lives, Hesher is well worth a buy.",5,I Wanna Be ANARCHY!,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,1580,"['Spencer', 'Susser', 'paean', 'Punk', 'Revolution', '70', 'works', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'instant', 'cult', 'classic', 'stars', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Hesher', 'who', 'Forneys', '13-year-old', 'T.J.', 'Devin', 'Brochu', 'inadvertently', 'chased', 'abandoned', 'building', 'Hesher', 'ally', 'Grandma', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'influential', 'male', 'figure', 'home', 'default', 'rebuke', 'disgrace', 'father', 'Paul', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'life', 'collapsed', 'recent', 'death', 'wife', 'T.J.', 'slowly', 'towards', 'Hesher', 'aghast', 'lawlessness', 'assault', 'battery', 'vandalism', 'break-ins', 'not', 'mention', 'constant', 'foul', 'language', 'total', 'disregard', 'social', 'convention', 'conflict', 'T.J.', 'Hesher', 'having', 'sex', 'heartthrob', 'older', 'girl', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'working', 'local', 'supermarket', 'T.J.', 'Paul', 'combine', 'run', 'Hesher', 'influence', 'lives', 'overcome', 'grief', 'T.J.', 'Mom', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'sudden', 'loss', 'Grandma', 'Hesher', 'Grandma', 'funeral', 'realize', 'epiphany', 'celebration', 'life', 'ability', 'adapt', 'overcome', 'having', 'concern', 'whatsoever', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'change.This', 'may', 'come', 'many', 'audiences', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'type', 'flick', 'unpalatable', 'unblinking', 'look', 'social', 'neanderthal', 'fascinated', 'teenage', 'angst', 'as', 'well', 'search', 'Sundance-type', 'flicks', 'exploring', 'meaning', 'life', 'dark', 'closets', 'lives', 'Hesher', 'well', 'buy']",N/A
1447659,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0058ZPMYG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[45, 49]","Take a linear narrative, throw in a dash of chaos, and you end up with Hesher, a film that debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010 but didn't see an official theatrical release until 2011. Playing with the person-helps-grieving-family storyline we've seen countless times, this is one of those indie dramas that assembles a cast of well-known actors and allows them to branch out from what's expected of them. The story, whether good or bad, functions as an opportunity for actors to play against type in a way that a typical mainstream movie wouldn't allow. Hardly a surprise, Hesher opened to mixed reviews with the majority of praise going to the actors and the majority of complaints going to the script and film itself. Well, with performances of this caliber and a story that is stronger than it has been given credit for; this film is actually quite successful.T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father Paul (Rainn Wilson) have recently suffered a traumatic loss that leaves them living with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and retreating into depression. T.J., who has found himself frequently tormented at school, becomes reclusive from those around him, while Paul wanders around the house in a prescription drug-induced daze. One day, T.J. stumbles upon Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose name and presence seem to be accompanied by the music of Metallica. In a classic example of deus ex machina, Hesher appears out of nowhere, with no back-story, and no reason to be in the film. He looks like a Grunge-era reject, drives a beat-up old van, has an upraised middle finger tattooed on his back, and seems to embrace chaos. He's also indifferent to societal rules; willfully disrespectful, vulgar, and violent. Despite T.J.'s protests, he moves into T.J.'s house and no one seems to care. During this time, T.J. meets Nicole (Natalie Portman), a young woman who captures his attention but turns her own attention to Hesher.There are some inconsistencies in the script, particularly in regards to the title character. There is no logical reason for him to be in this film and his entire existence is disconnected from everything around him. The writers struggle to stay true to this strange character as he seems abnormally out-of-this-world one moment and like a human being with feelings and a conscience the next. It's a predictable move for this film to shape him from an ominous, violent thug into a caring, gentle soul; but luckily Gordon-Levitt is a gifted enough actor to make this transformation believable. Levitt crossed the threshold from child actor to real actor long ago, so there's no need to provide further proof about his acting ability. Regardless, Hesher is a great character role despite the inability of the film to define just who/what the character is. Once Levitt appears in character, it's impossible to take your eyes off him and who else but Levitt could make Hesher's speech at the end reach such a level of comic poignancy? Aside from Hesher, who is only truly developed from the performance rather than the script, the characters here are very well-developed and are brought to life marvelously.This is the second time this year that Wilson has branched out from his Office character to prove what a gifted actor he is. There's very little humor in his character, giving Wilson the chance to stretch his acting muscles and bring Paul through a seamlessly convincing character arc. Brochu is a gifted young talent who brings some real, convincing emotional depth to the character of T.J. and Laurie, as the grandmother, is a lovely addition to the cast.Hesher is an unapologetically weird little film that is destined to be misunderstood by most audiences. This little oddity of an indie drama is dark and violent, but ultimately sweet and hopeful and even funny at times.  By the time Hesher reaches the end of his character arc, it's all a bit contrived, but, call me crazy, I was quite fond of it. It plays with a traditional formula, isn't afraid to take chances, and boasts some very memorable performances. It's no masterpiece, but it's an enticing, satisfying film that kept me glued to the screen for its entire running time.GRADE: A-",5,"An Enticing Little Oddity - Inconsistent, But Satisfying",1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,4185,"['Take', 'linear', 'narrative', 'throw', 'dash', 'chaos', 'end', 'up', 'Hesher', 'film', 'debuted', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', '2010', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'official', 'theatrical', 'release', '2011', 'Playing', 'person-helps-grieving-family', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'one', 'indie', 'dramas', 'cast', 'well-known', 'actors', 'branch', 'out', 'what', 'expected', 'story', 'good', 'bad', 'functions', 'opportunity', 'actors', 'play', 'type', 'way', 'typical', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Hardly', 'surprise', 'Hesher', 'opened', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'majority', 'praise', 'going', 'actors', 'majority', 'complaints', 'going', 'script', 'film', 'Well', 'performances', 'caliber', 'story', 'stronger', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'successful.T.J', 'Devin', 'Brochu', 'father', 'Paul', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'have', 'recently', 'suffered', 'traumatic', 'loss', 'living', 'T.J.', 'grandmother', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'retreating', 'depression', 'T.J.', 'who', 'found', 'frequently', 'tormented', 'school', 'becomes', 'reclusive', 'Paul', 'wanders', 'house', 'prescription', 'drug-induced', 'daze', 'One', 'day', 'T.J.', 'Hesher', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'name', 'presence', 'seem', 'be', 'accompanied', 'music', 'Metallica', 'classic', 'example', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'Hesher', 'nowhere', 'back-story', 'reason', 'be', 'film', 'Grunge-era', 'reject', 'beat-up', 'old', 'van', 'upraised', 'middle', 'finger', 'tattooed', 'back', 'embrace', 'chaos', 'also', 'indifferent', 'societal', 'rules', 'willfully', 'disrespectful', 'vulgar', 'violent', 'T.J.', 'protests', 'T.J.', 'house', 'one', 'care', 'time', 'T.J.', 'Nicole', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'attention', 'own', 'attention', 'Hesher.There', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'script', 'particularly', 'regards', 'title', 'character', 'logical', 'reason', 'be', 'film', 'entire', 'existence', 'disconnected', 'everything', 'writers', 'struggle', 'stay', 'true', 'strange', 'character', 'abnormally', 'out-of-this-world', 'one', 'moment', 'human', 'being', 'feelings', 'conscience', 'next', 'predictable', 'move', 'film', 'shape', 'ominous', 'violent', 'thug', 'caring', 'gentle', 'soul', 'luckily', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'gifted', 'enough', 'actor', 'make', 'transformation', 'believable', 'Levitt', 'crossed', 'threshold', 'child', 'actor', 'real', 'actor', 'long', 'ago', 'need', 'provide', 'further', 'proof', 'acting', 'ability', 'Regardless', 'Hesher', 'great', 'character', 'role', 'inability', 'film', 'define', 'just', 'who/what', 'character', 'Once', 'Levitt', 'character', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'who', 'else', 'Levitt', 'could', 'make', 'Hesher', 'speech', 'end', 'reach', 'level', 'comic', 'poignancy', 'Aside', 'Hesher', 'who', 'only', 'truly', 'developed', 'performance', 'rather', 'script', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'well-developed', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'marvelously.This', 'second', 'time', 'year', 'Wilson', 'branched', 'out', 'Office', 'character', 'prove', 'what', 'gifted', 'actor', 'very', 'little', 'humor', 'character', 'giving', 'Wilson', 'chance', 'stretch', 'acting', 'muscles', 'bring', 'Paul', 'seamlessly', 'convincing', 'character', 'arc', 'Brochu', 'gifted', 'young', 'talent', 'who', 'real', 'convincing', 'emotional', 'depth', 'character', 'T.J.', 'Laurie', 'grandmother', 'lovely', 'addition', 'cast.Hesher', 'unapologetically', 'weird', 'little', 'film', 'destined', 'be', 'misunderstood', 'most', 'audiences', 'little', 'oddity', 'indie', 'drama', 'dark', 'violent', 'ultimately', 'sweet', 'hopeful', 'even', 'funny', 'times', 'time', 'Hesher', 'end', 'character', 'arc', 'bit', 'contrived', 'call', 'crazy', 'was', 'quite', 'fond', 'traditional', 'formula', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'chances', 'very', 'memorable', 'performances', 'masterpiece', 'enticing', 'satisfying', 'film', 'kept', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'running', 'time.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
1447660,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0058ZPMYG,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Choosing a single adjective to describe Hesher would be impossible due to its complete off-the-wall, and utterly unpredictable, story. A film like this one prides itself in being weird, quirky, and insane, and this confidence shows for the entire hour and 40 minutes. However, confidence can&#8217;t mask an incomplete story and some bland performances, and these are exactly the areas in which Hesher stumbles. With some odd casting choices and a weird final arc, Hesher never really connects the way that it&#8217;s supposed to, but it still manages to be enjoyable despite its obvious flaws.The story follows a young boy, T.J. (Devin Brochu), and his father, Paul (Rainn Wilson). After a car crash leads to the death of T.J.&#8217;s mother, both individuals become depressed as they try to cope with the sudden loss. It doesn&#8217;t take long before T.J. meets the mysterious Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and pretty soon he takes up residence at T.J.&#8217;s home. Completely apathetic to the fact he wasn&#8217;t invited, Hesher continues living with the family as they deal with the grieving process. Chaos and mayhem quickly ensue, and the family learns that even someone as strange as Hesher can offer some guidance when the time calls for it.At first, this narrative seems to be enough to stand on its own, but the writers apparently felt otherwise. In addition to the main story arc, there are arguably two others: the story of Hesher himself, and that of the young grocery story clerk, Nicole (Natalie Portamn). The former would have been intriguing, and even welcome, when paired with T.J. and Paul&#8217;s story. Unfortunately, that isn&#8217;t what the audience was given. In fact, Hesher&#8217;s character never gets explained at all. The viewer never really learns who he is, where he came from, or why he lives life the way he does. He just exists in this world, and we&#8217;re forced to accept this as adequate information.So, instead of delving into the mystery that is the title character, Hesher decides to add a fourth party in the form of Nicole. This young woman, who&#8217;s age was never specified, is undoubtedly having a hard time in life. She only works 16 hours a week; she is unable to pay her bills, and her life doesn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere. A generic character who can easily be found in most dramas, but she isn&#8217;t terrible. My issue, though, is how insignificant and out-of-place she feels in this world. Beyond being the crush of young T.J., Nicole&#8217;s purpose in the story is hazy, to say the least. There are no words of wisdom and, like Hesher, she&#8217;s just kind of there.Taking that into consideration, the main story arc is enough to keep things interesting. Everyone handles death differently, and Hesher sympathetically demonstrates the worst symptom: depression. Paul lays on the couch and sleeps all day, and T.J. becomes obsessed with the car his mother died in, which is sitting in the junkyard. The message, if there is one, would definitely be learning to let go. As difficult as it may seem at first, death is a part of life, and allowing yourself to slip into nothingness isn&#8217;t the proper way to handle your problems.The real driving force in this movie, however, is Hesher himself. His dark, mysterious nature makes him instantly attractive, and as a viewer it becomes difficult to take your eyes off him whenever he&#8217;s on screen. He&#8217;s foul-mouthed, short-tempered, and incomprehensible, but this only adds to his charm. Furthermore, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a total knockout, and I was amazed at how well he got into character. There were multiple instances during the film where I had to remind myself that I was watching JGL and not some other, unknown actor. He was convincing, confident, and a blast to watch.Unfortunately, the only other standout, in my opinion, was Rainn Wilson, but he was never given an extreme amount of dialogue. Most of his performance came from his passiveness towards life, and I think he did a great job portraying the overwhelming depression that consumes most after death. Brochu, on the other hand, was inconsistent, at best. There were a handful of moments where he truly impressed me, but a majority of the time I found his performance to be embarrassingly flat. Portman wasn&#8217;t anything to write home about, either. In addition to having an out-of-place character, her performance felt uninspired, and she always seemed confused as to why she was even there.Overall Score: 6.9/10 - Insanely unpredictable, and a little difficult to digest, Hesher's comedic take on death and sorrow manages to be both entertaining and incredibly ridiculous. Unfortunately, the writers ignored the prospect of explaining Hesher's character, and opted to include Nicole instead. With an inconsistent story and some bland performances, Hesher never manages to live up to its potential, but it is fun in its own, unique way. It&#8217;s at least worth the rental if it piqued your interest.",3,"6.9/10 - Odd and flawed, but still enjoyable",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,5057,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed',

Tasker,"[7, 9]","Hesher, like its titular character, is a bombastic, pitch-black, nihilistic and more or less repugnant film...that is not to say that it is not sometimes quite enjoyable. It is very well shot but not flashy and Levitt, as always, is reliable. Rainn Wilson stretches his acting muscles slightly, donning a grizzly beard, some lethargic sweats, and making us forget all about the kooky flair of 'Dwight.' Natalie Portman is fine in a role that could have largely been played by anyone, save a scene near the end when she brings a little more personality to her character symbolically. The real star of the film however is young TJ (Devin Brochu), who is equally agitated and enamored by Hesher, a force of black-metal nature who infiltrates his life with manic jams, bi-polar explosions and enough profanity to make John Waters wince.This film is tenaciously vulgar, Hesher streaming vile language to a desensitizing degree. He even ends once exchange by saying. ""One more thing--"" before letting loose a giant fart. Shakespeare, this is not. However, there are several moments of rare and affecting poignancy sprinkled throughout scenes of selfish, useless destruction. The burnt/smashed cars, intimidation, etc etc are all anchored by young Brochu's mourning for his dead mother. Scenes involving the mother's car ring true and are welcome respites from Hesher's non-stop barrage of, well...Hesher. Without these sequences--particularly one late in the film where we see more of the family's relationship as it existed before the loss-- Hesher would be incredibly depressing.In fact, it is still fairly depressing.Hesher seemingly does his personal best to ensure this.He is a cipher, a darkness, a lack of humanity.For much of his screen time, he leers, smokes, grunts, moves with a rank primal energy.We can't tell if he is an anti-hero or not...usually he is just reckless, depraved, and watchable. His metaphoric soliloquies (particularly the epically humorous and gross and tragic one at the funeral) are worth the price of admission alone.It is a departure for Levitt, that is for sure, playing a character more akin to the haunted prostitute he played in Mysterious Skin than any films he has done lately. His character is a bruiser, a fairly unlikable wretch. And yet he gets the girl, he befriends the grandma, he rescues the kid...when he feels like it. The film which has trouble containing him is an unapologetic, drab, oft-intense and malicious picture. It is full of scratches, scars, and occasional shreds of understanding. There is an unrestrained power here, if you can handle the darkness, the brooding, the concussive expletive-heavy dialogue.",3,"A snarling, broken little character study",1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,2662,"['Hesher', 'titular', 'character', 'bombastic', 'pitch-black', 'nihilistic', 'more', 'less', 'repugnant', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'not', 'flashy', 'Levitt', 'always', 'reliable', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'acting', 'muscles', 'slightly', 'donning', 'grizzly', 'beard', 'lethargic', 'sweats', 'making', 'forget', 'kooky', 'flair', ""'Dwight"", 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'fine', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'largely', 'been', 'played', 'anyone', 'save', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'little', 'more', 'personality', 'character', 'symbolically', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'however', 'young', 'TJ', 'Devin', 'Brochu', 'who', 'equally', 'agitated', 'enamored', 'Hesher', 'force', 'black-metal', 'nature', 'who', 'life', 'manic', 'jams', 'bi-polar', 'explosions', 'enough', 'profanity', 'make', 'John', 'Waters', 'film', 'tenaciously', 'vulgar', 'Hesher', 'streaming', 'vile', 'language', 'desensitizing', 'degree', 'even', 'once', 'exchange', 'saying', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'letting', 'loose', 'giant', 'fart', 'Shakespeare', 'not', 'However', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'rare', 'affecting', 'poignancy', 'sprinkled', 'scenes', 'selfish', 'useless', 'destruction', 'burnt/smashed', 'cars', 'intimidation', 'etc', 'etc', 'are', 'anchored', 'young', 'Brochu', 'mourning', 'dead', 'mother', 'Scenes', 'involving', 'mother', 'car', 'ring', 'true', 'are', 'welcome', 'respites', 'Hesher', 'non-stop', 'barrage', 'well', 'Hesher', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'one', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'more', 'family', 'relationship', 'existed', 'loss', 'Hesher', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'depressing.In', 'fact', 'still', 'fairly', 'depressing.Hesher', 'seemingly', 'personal', 'best', 'ensure', 'this.He', 'cipher', 'darkness', 'lack', 'humanity.For', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'smokes', 'grunts', 'moves', 'rank', 'primal', 'energy.We', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anti-hero', 'not', 'usually', 'just', 'reckless', 'depraved', 'watchable', 'metaphoric', 'soliloquies', 'particularly', 'epically', 'humorous', 'gross', 'tragic', 'one', 'funeral', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone.It', 'departure', 'Levitt', 'sure', 'playing', 'character', 'more', 'akin', 'haunted', 'prostitute', 'played', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'films', 'done', 'lately', 'character', 'bruiser', 'fairly', 'unlikable', 'wretch', 'yet', 'girl', 'grandma', 'kid', 'when', 'film', 'trouble', 'containing', 'unapologetic', 'drab', 'oft-intense', 'malicious', 'picture', 'full', 'scratches', 'scars', 'occasional', 'shreds', 'understanding', 'unrestrained', 'power', 'here', 'can', 'handle', 'darkness', 'brooding', 'concussive', 'expletive-heavy', 'dialogue']",N/A

1447667,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0058ZPMYG,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","Young T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father, Paul (Rainn Wilson), are still reeling from a family tragedy that has left them both depressed and isolated. They live with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and barely communicate with anyone in the darkened and dismal home. By chance, T.J. crosses paths with Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a homeless metalhead who ends up forcing his way into their lives. This movie is about how Hesher's violent, foul-mouthed, seemingly nihilistic influence creates both chaos and peace among the members of this fractured and failing family.As I watched the film, I hoped and prayed that it would not follow the same path as every other Eccentric Outsider Helps Struggling Group Find Peace And Unity movie that has ever existed fromHarry and the HendersonstoCaptain RontoMary Poppins... sorry, I'm sure there are more examples, but those are the first three that came to mind. My examples are comedies, and HESHER certainly pretends (in parts) to be a comedy, but this is, in fact, a very dark film, and even the faux-happy ending that is tacked on does little to lighten the grimness that both the script and Hesher seem compelled to force onto the characters.Unfortunately, although Hesher isn't as cheesy of a guiding/unifying force as a drunken captain or lost Sasquatch or prim-n-proper magical maid, the script fails to put him in a position that is very unique to stories of this ilk. He even has a big speech at the end where The Moral is dutifully imparted (albeit in an amusingly crass and chaotic way) to the family who finally Learns Their Lesson. Hesher's influence is many times baffling and arbitrary, which lead me to believe that this odd little film was going to trod a different path, but in the end, first time writer/director Spenser Susser just couldn't go beyond the basic moral framework that you always find in these films.In spite of the aggressively dismal script and fairly standard emotional arc, the movie's performances are absolutely seamless. Wilson, Levitt, Laurie, and Portman do incredible work as their characters. They take the mess of the script and find true and meaningful pathos in it. Major props especially go to Brochu, who does a stellar job as the lead character, evincing the kind of depth of emotion you rarely find in child stars these days. Although the story is alienating and depressing and ultimately nothing all that new, there is richness to be found simply in watching these excellent actors inhabit their world, no matter how mundane or glum it may be.",3,"Amazing Performances Rise Above A Grim, Formulaic Story",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,2541,"['Young', 'T.J.', 'Devin', 'Brochu', 'father', 'Paul', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'are', 'still', 'reeling', 'family', 'tragedy', 'left', 'depressed', 'isolated', 'live', 'T.J.', 'grandmother', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'barely', 'communicate', 'anyone', 'darkened', 'dismal', 'home', 'chance', 'T.J.', 'paths', 'Hesher', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'homeless', 'metalhead', 'who', 'up', 'forcing', 'way', 'lives', 'movie', 'how', 'Hesher', 'violent', 'foul-mouthed', 'seemingly', 'nihilistic', 'influence', 'chaos', 'peace', 'members', 'fractured', 'failing', 'family.As', 'watched', 'film', 'hoped', 'prayed', 'would', 'not', 'follow', 'same', 'path', 'other', 'Eccentric', 'Outsider', 'Helps', 'Struggling', 'Group', 'Find', 'Peace', 'Unity', 'movie', 'ever', 'existed', 'fromHarry', 'HendersonstoCaptain', 'RontoMary', 'Poppins', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'more', 'examples', 'are', 'first', 'three', 'came', 'mind', 'examples', 'are', 'comedies', 'HESHER', 'certainly', 'parts', 'be', 'comedy', 'fact', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'even', 'faux-happy', 'ending', 'tacked', 'little', 'lighten', 'grimness', 'script', 'Hesher', 'seem', 'compelled', 'force', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'Hesher', ""n't"", 'cheesy', 'guiding/unifying', 'force', 'drunken', 'captain', 'lost', 'Sasquatch', 'prim-n-proper', 'magical', 'maid', 'script', 'put', 'position', 'very', 'unique', 'stories', 'ilk', 'even', 'big', 'speech', 'end', 'where', 'Moral', 'dutifully', 'imparted', 'amusingly', 'crass', 'chaotic', 'way', 'family', 'who', 'finally', 'Learns', 'Their', 'Lesson', 'Hesher', 'influence', 'many', 'times', 'baffling', 'arbitrary', 'lead', 'believe', 'odd', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'trod', 'different', 'path', 'end', 'first', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Spenser', 'Susser', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'basic', 'moral', 'framework', 'always', 'find', 'films.In', 'spite', 'aggressively', 'dismal', 'script', 'fairly', 'standard', 'emotional', 'arc', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'seamless', 'Wilson', 'Levitt', 'Laurie', 'Portman', 'do', 'incredible', 'work', 'characters', 'take', 'mess', 'script', 'find', 'true', 'meaningful', 'pathos', 'Major', 'props', 'especially', 'go', 'Brochu', 'who', 'stellar', 'job', 'lead', 'character', 'evincing', 'kind', 'depth', 'emotion', 'rarely', 'find', 'child', 'stars', 'days', 'story', 'alienating', 'depressing', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'new', 'richness', 'be', 'found', 'simply', 'watching', 'excellent', 'actors', 'inhabit', 'world', 'matter', 'how', 'mundane', 'glum', 'may', 'be']",N/A

1447669,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0058ZPMYG,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Whenever I hear about a group of critics giving high praise to a movie I immediately am fearful that the movie will be terrible. Most critics tend to look at the ""artistic"" merit of a film and toss out the entire idea that it should be entertaining. Some go so far as to feel that if a movie entertains it has failed in its mission to articulate some big idea. These same critics fail to realize that most people plopping down anywhere from $5 to $10 to see a movie or even $1 to rent it want something for their money and most want to be entertained. So it was I was concerned when I read high praise for the movie HESHER. Still, I wanted to see it for myself.I'll start by saying there were things I liked about HESHER and there were things I hated about it. Did it entertain? In some ways, yes but for the most part it just seemed determined to either offend or show those who would be offended just how uncool they really are. Call me square I guess.Devin Brochu stars as young T.J., a boy dealing with the loss of his mother. We don't discover this for sure until later in the film but in having him race his bike chasing a crashed car being towed away you kind of figure it out early on. T.J. isn't the only one having trouble dealing with the loss. His father Paul (Rainn Wilson) tends to sit around the house, deep into anti-depressants and doing very little. Only T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) seems to have any life left in her and she's much older than she acts.T.J. seems to find himself in trouble most of the time, especially at school. It's there he runs afoul of the school bully, a youngster who works at the junkyard where T.J.'s crashed family car was taken. Avoiding this bully, T.J. ends up at a housing project and in an act of anger tosses a rock through a window of a house being built. Before he can toss another, out walks a straggly looking vagrant who we learn later is named Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  When security shows, Hesher tosses a grenade their way after informing T.J. that T.J. screwed him over.Later T.J. sees the same black van Hesher was driving following him, eventually stopping in front of his house. Turning from the window, T.J. finds Hesher in his living room, apparently squatting there now since his last ""home"" was taken away. The oddest thing is that no one seems to tell Hesher he has to leave except T.J. who is threatened.Life goes on this way with Hesher witness to all sorts of violent acts against T.J. He never steps in as they occur, but he does later doing things like setting the school bully's car on fire. It's Hesher's way of forcing T.J. to stand up for himself but at the same time shows nothing less than total anarchy. But that's Hesher's character, one who lives for the moment and for the most part thinks only of himself. But not always.T.J. eventually befriends a young woman named Nicole (Natalie Portman) who works as a clerk at the local grocery store. For some reason he connects with her, using her as a substitute for his deceased mother. Their friendship grows but seems just as odd as his strange friendship with Hesher. A later betrayal in T.J.'s eyes leads the two to part ways with the hope of it ending better before the final reel.The movie crawls along at a steady yet slow seeming pace with little to find attractive in it. Everything has a murky brown, cluttered feel to it. And while you feel an amount of sympathy for the lead characters, you eventually just want to yell get on with it. Hesher, the anti-hero we should be thrilled to root for just seems like a malcontent who helps people only when it benefits himself.I read someone say that this felt like an update of SHANE. I disagree. In that film we had a lawbreaker who lived with his gun that came along and helped a family find themselves. In this one we have a lawbreaker more inclined to fit the Jack Palance character in SHANE, the evil gunslinger who lived only for himself.There is one thing to like in this film and that's the acting. Brochu turns in a fine performance for a young actor, but it would have been nice to see him do more than scream. They even reference that in the gag reel included in the special section. I think Rainn Wilson is a terrific actor, but he's wasted here doing little more than look pained and depressed from start to finish. Levitt is the one to watch here. Remembering him when he was a child star and seeing him develop into an actor worth watching is remarkable.So if the acting was the best thing what was the worst? The script. To me it's becoming clich&eacute; to portray the world as one big cesspool, an ugly place where nothing but ugly things happen. The script also uses what I consider to be the laziest thing possible, using vulgar language for shock value. To hear Hesher talk to T.J. about using various appendages and inserting them into various orifices isn't funny, amusing or helps develop the character though I'm sure many will think it does. To me it just gets in the way of the story and when used as often as it is here it distracts rather than helps. I've been known to toss out an expletive a time or two, but here it wasn't needed.The other bad item is Natalie Portman being completely wasted here. Her part seems like more of a cameo than an honest role. One scene becomes crucial to the development of T.J.'s life, but other than that her part could have been phoned in.So on the whole while I enjoyed the performances of some of the cast, I felt that this movie lacked in far too many areas. The rebel without a clue idea has been done better and has been overused. The ideas of what makes a character the cool one here has nothing to do with values and everything to do with self satisfaction. And in the end this film commits the worst mistake of not being entertaining.",2,TOUGH LOVE?,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,5800,"['Whenever', 'hear', 'group', 'critics', 'giving', 'high', 'praise',

Unfortunately this film not only fails to entertain, but fails the smell test of reality.  Since this isn't an action movie or a sci-fi movie or a comic book movie, it would seem that the events might in fact have some likelihood of really happening.  Here we get a long haired tatted up young man named Hesher (Gordon-Levitt) who walks into the home of a depressed widower (Wilson), his 12 year old son (Devin Brochu) and his mother (Laurie) and takes over.  The first time I see this guy, I'm calling 911 but this family lets him move in.The film centers on the accidental death of the wife/mother who was killed a couple months earlier in a car accident.  TJ (Brochu) wants the car back after it was sold for junk, but must deal with the salvage operator's teen-age son who is the school bully.  In several scenes Hesher could prevent TJ's thumpings but doesn't.  You just know, he's trying to toughen up the kid by allowing him to be force fed urinal cake.  Or maybe turn him in to a psychotic serial killer.  Who knows.  Natalie Portman plays a part time grocery cashier who has trouble making ends meet but helps TJ avoid another thumping in the parking lot.  TJ has a crush on her so when she meets Hesher who is more age-appropriate you know what happens.Portman's just along for the ride, looking to get another notch on her gun named ""indi"".  Hesher's not some misunderstood homeless man looking to do the right thing.

In ""Hesher"", directed by Spencer Susser, this quote resonated with me.  It was not until I heard that line that I fully understood what this movie was about.  ""Hesher"" is a great film.  One with a lot of heart and some brilliant writing.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the outrageous Hesher perfectly and is by far (aside from ""Mysterious Skin"") his best work to date.""Hesher"" plays out like a weird dream.  T.J., impressively played by Devin Brochu, is a young boy struggling with the loss of his mother.  He lives with his father Paul and his grandmother.  Paul, played by Rain Wilson, has fallen into a deep depression letting go all of his responsibility to his son and his own mother.  It's a very tragic situation they are in.  In a fit of rage T.J. vandalizes what he thinks is an unoccupied building and as a result is confronted by Hesher, terrifying T.J. in the process.  Hesher decides to follow T.J. to his home and lets himself in.  T.J. can't do anything about this random person entering the house, doing laundry and generally just making himself at home for fear that Hesher will harm his family.  What follows is a plethora of black comedy and heartfelt change within both Hesher and this distraught family.At it's heart, ""Hesher"" is a film about not being able to see the things that are right in front of us until an outsider smacks us in the face with reality.  This isn't apparent in the beginning of the film, but as Hesher gets to know the family and the situation they are in he goes from ""house squatting"" to being part of the family.  In doing so the family is able to climb out of the rut they are in and fill the void left by the passing of the mother with the idea that life goes on.  The film takes a lot of time to get to this realization, but the time spent getting there is great fun to watch.Joseph Gordon-Levitt impresses me more every time I see him.  His portrayal of the careless, fowl mouthed, violent, heavy metal loving outsider that we have all known at some point in our lives is spot on.  Levitt seemed to really engulf himself into this role, almost to the point where he wasn't acting and just being himself.  Rain Wilson also impressed me.  His feature films have generally been him re-hashing his role from ""The Office"" in various outrageous situations.  This time he was genuine and proved to this reviewer that his range goes beyond the weird goofball we are used to seeing.  Natalie Portman plays the small role of T.J.'s older love interest.  She was good, but her role seemed more like filler than anything else.  There is nothing wrong with that, her character just wasn't an important role to the story it seemed.One of the best aspects of this film was the relationship between Hesher and the grandmother, Madeleine, played by Piper Laurie.  Hesher sees how Madeleine is just wandering aimlessly while Paul and T.J. deal with their problems completely ignoring her needs.  Hesher, I think finds something that reminds him of his own mother in Madeleine and shares some sweet moments with her.  Fortunately for Hesher, the grandmother's age has left her with the ability to completely ignore the fact that Hesher is just a stranger intruding into their lives and ends up treating him like one of her own.  This, I think is the turning point for Hesher and we see the change within him.This film goes much deeper than what is on the surface.  Director and writer Spencer Susser did an amazing job with keeping the underlying meanings hidden until the right time for them to come to fruition.  Not once was I bored with what was going on and I couldn't wait to see what the next scene had to offer.  With this being Susser's first feature film, I am excited to see what he has next in the pipeline.  Make no mistake, there is some vial language in this film so it's not for those that will not be able to get past the offensiveness of it all.  But as I said, underneath the chain-smoking jerk that is Hesher you will find a kind soul that needed the Forney family just as much as they needed him.",5,An excellent film with a lot of heart,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,4243,"['Life', 'walking', 'rain', 'can', 'hide', 'take', 'cover', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'wet', 'Rarely', 'film', 'do', 'find', 'quote', 'perfectly', 'lessons', 'trying', 'portray', 'Hesher', 'directed', 'Spencer', 'Susser', 'quote', 'resonated', 'was', 'not', 'heard', 'line', 'fully', 'understood', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'Hesher', 'great', 'film', 'One', 'lot', 'heart', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'outrageous', 'Hesher', 'perfectly', 'far', 'aside', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'Hesher', 'out', 'weird', 'dream', 'T.J.', 'impressively', 'played', 'Devin', 'Brochu', 'young', 'boy', 'struggling', 'loss', 'mother', 'father', 'Paul', 'grandmother', 'Paul', 'played', 'Rain', 'Wilson', 'fallen', 'deep', 'depression', 'letting', 'go', 'responsibility', 'son', 'own', 'mother', 'very', 'tragic', 'situation', 'are', 'fit', 'rage', 'T.J.', 'what', 'unoccupied', 'building', 'result', 'confronted', 'Hesher', 'terrifying', 'T.J.', 'process', 'Hesher', 'follow', 'T.J.', 'home', 'T.J.', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'random', 'person', 'entering', 'house', 'doing', 'laundry', 'generally', 'just', 'making', 'home', 'fear', 'Hesher', 'will', 'harm', 'family', 'What', 'plethora', 'black', 'comedy', 'heartfelt', 'change', 'Hesher', 'distraught', 'heart', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'right', 'front', 'outsider', 'smacks', 'face', 'reality', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'beginning', 'film', 'Hesher', 'know', 'family', 'situation', 'are', 'house', 'squatting', 'being', 'part', 'family', 'doing', 'so', 'family', 'able', 'climb', 'rut', 'are', 'fill', 'void', 'left', 'passing', 'mother', 'idea', 'life', 'film', 'lot', 'time', 'get', 'realization', 'time', 'spent', 'getting', 'great', 'fun', 'watch.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'impresses', 'more', 'time', 'see', 'portrayal', 'careless', 'fowl', 'mouthed', 'violent', 'heavy', 'metal', 'loving', 'outsider', 'have', 'known', 'point', 'lives', 'spot', 'Levitt', 'seemed', 'really', 'engulf', 'role', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'just', 'being', 'Rain', 'Wilson', 'also', 'impressed', 'feature', 'films', 'have', 'generally', 'been', 're-hashing', 'role', 'Office', 'various', 'outrageous', 'situations', 'time', 'was', 'genuine', 'proved', 'reviewer', 'range', 'weird', 'goofball', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'small', 'role', 'T.J.', 'older', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'good', 'role', 'seemed', 'more', 'filler', 'anything', 'else', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'character', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'role', 'story', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'relationship', 'Hesher', 'grandmother', 'Madeleine', 'played', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Hesher', 'how', 'Madeleine', 'just', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'Paul', 'T.J.', 'deal', 'problems', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'needs', 'Hesher', 'think', 'finds', 'something', 'own', 'mother', 'Madeleine', 'shares', 'sweet', 'moments', 'Fortunately', 'Hesher', 'grandmother', 'age', 'left', 'ability', 'completely', 'ignore', 'fact', 'Hesher', 'just', 'stranger', 'intruding', 'lives', 'up', 'treating', 'one', 'own', 'think', 'turning', 'point', 'Hesher', 'see', 'change', 'him.This', 'film', 'much', 'deeper', 'what', 'surface', 'Director', 'writer', 'Spencer', 'Susser', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'keeping', 'underlying', 'meanings', 'hidden', 'right', 'time', 'come', 'fruition', 'Not', 'once', 'was', 'bored', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'scene', 'had', 'offer', 'being', 'Susser', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'pipeline', 'Make', 'mistake', 'vial', 'language', 'film', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'offensiveness', 'said', 'chain-smoking', 'jerk', 'Hesher', 'will', 'find', 'kind', 'soul', 'needed', 'Forney', 'family', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'needed']",N/A

1447686,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B0058ZPMYG,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","Hesher is a dark comedy/drama film co-written and directed by Spencer Susser and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the titular character and Devin Brochu as TJ and Rainn Wilson as his father Paul. I'll admit I neither hated nor loved this film, but I definitely leaned more towards hated it. It felt so dark and disturbing at times, especially towards the end when TJ starts to lose it, that it took away from alot of the darkly funny humor of the first half of the film. I felt I would have liked Hesher more if it had been a straight black comedy, rather than a comedy/drama as it turned out to be. All of the right ingredients were there, vulgar nihilistic loner Hesher forcing his way into the lives of a depressed father and his grieving bullied son. However, instead of sticking to the comedy that kept this film from being too dark and depressing, it abandoned that formula towards the middle and degraded itself into rather bleak drama, and the attempts at humor toward the end felt pathetic, lazy, and unfunny. I'll admit there was a somewhat touching moment towards the end involving a coffin, but truth be told, despite being funny and entertaining (atleast in the beginning) this film felt almost pointless. What was the point of the Hesher character, was he there to improve the lives of TJ's family or destroy what little happiness there was left. Based on the way the film progressed it would seem as if he improved their lives, but there doesn't seem to be any particular reason why things got better all of sudden, especially in the last few scenes. Yes, this film has a somewhat happy ending, which again kept this film from a lower rating, but it could have been alot better. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Natalie Portman's character, and if this film was a straight comedy, it would actually be her character that would bring the quality of the film from a 4 star rating to a 5 star.

TJ is a bad luck kid who is not only depressed, but bullied. Hesher, an anarchist, bullies his way into TJ's life and shows up at improbable times, almost as an imaginary alter ego. The writer attempts to shock the audience with the audacity of Hesher's acts as well as his crudeness, which I thought didn't work as well...especially the idiotic scene where he is talking about granny rapers, or his ""perverted metaphor."" The inability of the author to create audacity without constant crudeness shows a weakness.The actors did an excellent job. There were many scenes you sit and ask yourself, in a good way, ""What just happened here?"" Or ""What the heck is he doing now?"" Life as usual falls to its least common denominator as the grief stricken family starts to imitate the anarchist ways, which seem to lack consequences in this film. Parts of the film were excellently done, while other scenes were weak. I suppose the ending of the film was supposed to make us feel good about the whole thing, but it doesn't compensate enough. Personally I think that if they toned down the crudeness of Hesher and put in Zack Garifalakis in that role the movie could have been a box office smash.Normally I love these indie style quirky comedies, perhaps I have seen too many of them to enjoy this one to its fullest.

It is about a young boy T.J. (Devin Brochu), who has lost his mother in a fatal car crash His father Paul (Rain Wilson of `Super' fame) is wallowing in prescription drug dependency as a way to by pass the grief. They are living with his Grandma and life is slowly unravelling.After T.J. smashes a window of a house where Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is crashing, their paths become entwined. Hesher follows him in the best stalker style and decides he will just move in. The first thing he does is strip off and do his laundry followed by making an illegal cable hook up so they can get more TV channels - especially of the more adult variety.T.J. is dealing with ghosts and bullies in equal measure and that leads to a chance meeting with supermarket cashier Nicole (Natalie Portman). T.J. bonds with her but Hesher is never too far away. He has an unhealthy like for profanity, porn, Metallica and arson; an ideal house guest you might say. Therfore not the sort of friend a young boy should really be associated with. What happens though is that the more mayhem he creates the more he breaks the catharsis of grief that is holding every body back.This film does not stick to any convention, it is totally unpredictable and that is the essence of Hesher himself. There are no real pretty actors everything is seemingly low rent but with real people and it is so refreshing for that. Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to take on challenging roles and make interesting and well crafted cinema and is one of those actors who can be relied upon to make viewing, anything he is in, worthwhile. That said every single performance is to the high end of excellent especially Devin Brochu as T.J.Directed and co - written by Spencer Susser in his debut for a major picture, who has struck cinematic gold for this off the wall, funny, rude, moving and brilliant film.
