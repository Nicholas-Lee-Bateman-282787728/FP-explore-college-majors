But it's not all bad.First the bad: Heston is too old, Richard Johnson (as Watson) is too old, Susannah Harker is too young and cannot act, the romance between 64-yr old Johnson and 26-yr old Harker seems more like pedophilia, and the script is a pastiche of catchphrases from the books.But there's good news here too. Heston actually does a credible job of it (and I feel I'm pretty picky), Susannah has a good scene at the end, and the plot has a a couple of fresh twists that liven things up a bit. In fact, the final climactic scene *almost* makes some of the previous nonsense fit together.So give it a try.

It was a pleasure to see the late Charlton Heston portray Holmes if only to help out his son who was responsible for the film. Given the variety of other Holmes portrayals we have seen in the 20+ years since this movie was made, Heston no longer seems out of place. He is, in fact, a rather comfortable Holmes though it was not in his style to be as eccentric as the character we had come to expect at the time of his creation.I differ from some in having liked the performance of Watson. He was not the befuddled character Nigel Bruce was forced to play, although not as true a companion as the lamented series on BBC which was terminated by the death of Holmes (Jeremy Brett).Irene was, of course,  a borrowing from Irene Adler, the only woman Holmes ever loved. In this case, it is Watson who is attracted. Have still never heard of the actress playing the strong female role of Irene, Susannah Harker. However, she appears, in middle age (48), to be still active but not in ways which would put her in the American spotlight.Edward Fox, always a pleasure to watch, was undoubtedly told to lay the British Gentleman character on with a trowel; he does so with great gusto to the gratification of at least this fan of his.All in all, quite a watchable Holmes outing which most fans should enjoy (as should the general viewer not addicted to the killing a minute action-thriller). Even though Holmes lacks the intensely idiosyncratic character of the key modern players of the part, it is still well done by one of our better actors.",4,"Not First Class Holmes, But Enjoyable",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,1578,"['can', 'only', 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'written', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'late', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'portray', 'Holmes', 'only', 'help', 'out', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'film', 'Given', 'variety', 'other', 'Holmes', 'portrayals', 'have', 'seen', '20+', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Heston', 'no', 'longer', 'place', 'fact', 'rather', 'comfortable', 'Holmes', 'was', 'not', 'style', 'be', 'as', 'eccentric', 'character', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'time', 'creation.I', 'differ', 'having', 'liked', 'performance', 'Watson', 'was', 'not', 'befuddled', 'character', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'was', 'forced', 'play', 'not', 'true', 'companion', 'lamented', 'series', 'BBC', 'was', 'terminated', 'death', 'Holmes', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', '.Irene', 'was', 'course', 'borrowing', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'only', 'woman', 'Holmes', 'ever', 'loved', 'case', 'Watson', 'who', 'attracted', 'Have', 'still', 'never', 'heard', 'actress', 'playing', 'strong', 'female', 'role', 'Irene', 'Susannah', 'Harker', 'However', 'middle', 'age', '48', 'be', 'still', 'active', 'not', 'ways', 'would', 'put', 'American', 'spotlight.Edward', 'Fox', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'told', 'lay', 'British', 'Gentleman', 'character', 'trowel', 'so', 'great', 'gusto', 'gratification', 'least', 'fan', 'his.All', 'quite', 'watchable', 'Holmes', 'outing', 'most', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'should', 'general', 'viewer', 'not', 'addicted', 'killing', 'minute', 'action-thriller', 'Even', 'Holmes', 'intensely', 'idiosyncratic', 'character', 'key', 'modern', 'players', 'part', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'better', 'actors']",N/A

305904,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,630228757X,Gary P. Cohen,"[24, 26]","Being a Sherlock Holmes fan, I saw ""The Crucifer of Blood"" when it opened on Broadway during the 1980s.  I remember thinking that it was enjoyable although nothing great.  I later read that Charlton Heston was starring in the play in Los Angeles and thought how much I would have liked to see him play Holmes.  Well I got my chance when this made-for-tv version was produced for TNT.  This film was produced, written and directed by Heston's son Fraser.  I remember thinking it was okay when I originally saw it on tv and my opinion hasn't changed after seeing it on dvd last night.The plot is basically a rerun of Conan Doyle's ""The Sign of the Four.""  Even though it was filmed in London and has some decent sets and large amounts of fog rolled in, this is obviously not a big budget production.  Heston is basically miscast as Holmes.  However he was such a fine actor and a great American that I really didn't mind.  Richard Johnson is terrible as Watson, back to portraying the good doctor as a pathetic buffoon, falling madly in love with and making goo-goo eyes at a young woman half his age, after knowing her for about an hour.  (It was so wonderful not to see Watson portrayed as a fool in the Grenada Sherlock Holmes films with Jeremy Brett, the greatest Sherlock Holmes ever.)  The actor who portrays Inspector Lestrade portrays him as a low-grade moron.  (Holmes even refers to him as ""comic relief."")Edward Fox and John Fraser overact outrageously as the two main victims of the curse.  The one true bright spot is an actress named Susannah Harker as the femme-fatale of the plot (and Watson's budding love interest.)  She is very good (and looks quite fetching at the conclusion.)  I'm not sure if I have seen her in anything other than this.As stated, this is a fairly enjoyable way to spend an hour and forty minutes, nothing more and nothing less.  And while Heston was probably the most miscast Sherlock Holmes since Roger Moore in ""Sherlock Holmes in New York,"" it still was a pleasure to see this great actor again.

305910,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,630228757X,jude pepper,"[1, 2]","Sherlock Holmes is such a fertile, magical character and/or concept that it takes quite a bit to present him in such a way as to fail to entertain. i can be done - take the Hallmark Channel's series of spiritless exploits starring Matt Frewer, or Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's execrable attempt to make a comedy out of The Hound Of The Baskervilles - but it takes some doing. the magic of Sherlock Holmes is so potent that it can collaborate with such downright blasphemous notions as his cocaine addiction threatening to get the better of him (The Seven-Per-Cent Solution) and turning him into an imbecile who lucks out in life (Without A Clue). smashing to ribbons what the most prudish puriest would call the most important rule (leave him in his Victorian England setting), hasn't stopped SHERLOCK, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, from being the single ass-kickin'est new tv series of the last couple of years.in many ways THE CRUCIFER OF BLOOD could've been a disaster. it still doesn't quite hit the jackpot, but it's pretty damn good considering how much it had working against it.my most glaring problems with it deal with the question of what could've been. i don't, for instance, quite get the point of the story. basically, it's a darker rewrite of The Sign Of Four, placing a greater emphasis on a ""curse of the Agra treasure"" proposed in passing at the end of the novel. as it happens, Sign is my favorite of Conan Doyle's four novels about Sherlock, and my second favorite story of all after ""The Final Problem""/""The Empty House."" so i can never watch this movie without wondering why they didn't do Sign outright rather than turning it on it's head the way they did.there's another missed opportunity which doesn't quite ruin it for me but still always manages to come back to me. i've heard that when the play was presented on the West End, Charlton Heston was Sherlock, and Watson was played by...Jeremy Brett. someone's already saying it would've be an anticlimax, that since Jeremy Brett was built to play Sherlock, it would've been not unlike, say, Abbott as the innocent ""mark"" and Costello as the duplicitous would-be conartist. they're probably right, but still, i can't help being curious.no offense to Richard Johnson, who plays as competently admirable a Watson as the pot-luck circumstances would ever of offered. the major weakness in his performance, the utterly ludicrous attempted love-story with Sherlock's latest client, is not Johnson's fault, but the script's. he may not be able to do much to sidestep said landmine, but he does maintain his dignity in the process.the standout in the cast for me is Clive Wood as Jonathan Small. he plays the scruffy, rough-around-the-edges ""pirate"" character for everything he's worth, and often steals the show in much the same way he had a film earlier with the character of Captain Smollett. (did i mention that this is TNT, Charlton Heston, and son/writer-director Frasier Heston's follow-up to their triumphant presentation of Treasure Island?)not unlike Dr. Watson, Inspector Lestrade originated as a bit savvier than often depicted. he always had his buffoon tendencies, but he was never quite as completely hopeless as, say, Dennis Hoey (from the Basil Rathbone movies) portayed him. here that misinterpretation is played up to 11 by Simon Callow, complete with obnoxious laugh. there's room for debate on this issue, since it's not quite the heresy it was to dumb down Watson. but Callow is as amusing in the part as anyone could be.i'll have to address it eventually, how good a Sherlock, really, is Charlton Heston? he's inevitably no Basil Rathbone/Jeremy Brett/Benedict Cumberbatch, but he manages to make the part work for the most part. his major weakness is circumstance. when Richard Donner was casting Superman he insisted on an unknown for the role. he argued that Superman was himself as much of a star and/or legend as anyone in Hollywood, so it could create a confusion in the audience's minds. he didn't want them going ""hey, it's Robert Redford"" when they should've been going ""hey, it's Superman."" CRUCIFER may offer the single best example of the effect Donner was trying to avoid. because Heston is such a legend as an actor in general, his more than any other portrayal feels like an actor playing Sherlock Holmes. even so, he manages to convey what an actor in this part is required to convey. he comprehends the rules for playing this character, so it's not like Sherlock suddenly lobbies for the National Rifle Association or anything.for all that, it's not a bad little film. it's richly atmospheric and the story is enticing (if less magical than it was in it's original condition as The Sign Of Four). it's just that it's not really trying to replicate Doyle's formula - even the title sounds more like a slasher film than a mystery - so it's was bound to feel a little off.my affection and enthusiasm for Sherlock Holmes is such that i can find something to enjoy in just about any version. as i mentioned in another review, i even enjoyed Sherlock Holmes & The Deadly Necklace. (even it's star, Christopher Lee, isn't exactly singing it's praises.) alas, CRUCIFER does indeed come closer to that level than that of, say, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution or Murder By Decree. to say nothing of falling similarly short of it's creators' aforementioned production of Treasure Island. but hey, even Doyle's own quality of product fluctated. you can enjoy reading, say, ""A Case Of Identity"" even when you know that ""The Bruce-Partington Plans"" it ain't.and that's all you Sherlockians need to get straight in your heads to be able to enjoy this movie.",4,The Game Is

I've read all of the books by the age of 10 and have continued my research into the Victorian Era.  I even have a friend who has a Masters in English with her thesis on Sherlock Holmes.All of that being said, this movie, while covering ""the essentials"" of a Sherlock Holmes story, misses out on catching several key elements: suspense, pace of the story (this was less of a mystery and more of a continuing jumping of sequence to sequence), the ""aura of mystery"", the element of surprise.  Not much of the ""outside world"" was covered: 1 train shot, an estate manor in north of London, an opium den and a foggy Thames River.  Of all the scenes, the opium den and Dr. Watson wandering through Limehouse was the best part.The ""catch"" of getting scared or trying to figure out the mystery was lacking IMHO.  I got the feeling that the actors were paid to say their lines and that was it.  Believe it or not, the most acting came from the bumbling Scotland Yard detective.  All other acting was mediocre.Witnessing the small Indian assassin in the beginning and having the actors voice all the ""secrets"" during the follow ups of Sherlock Holmes showing up all but revealed what was going on.  This destroys any ""mystery"" of the curse- it's obviously about 3 men and greed/revenge.During the movie, near the end, Sherlock Homes returns home and acts normal.  This is wrong since many of his letters and correspondences have been scattered on the floor and a letter opener is missing.  He goes about putting everything in place but then leaves to ""fetch"" the police when the police were with him in the first place.  Sherlock Holmes would have noticed the haphazard condition of his residence immediately and busted the ""main criminal"" right then and there but the movie opted to deal with dragging the story out with a deus-ex-machina arrival of Sherlock Holmes in the end to save the day.  Obviously, I hate cliche'd, deus-ex-machina endings.Sorry, I love Sherlock Holmes and all associated workings of him (movies, books) but if I was allowed to rate this movie, it would be a 2.5.  I rated it at a 3 because it's not above the rating of 2 stars but doesn't quite make it to 3.",3,This is 2.5 stars at best,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,2264,"['First', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'MOST', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'age', '10', 'have', 'continued', 'research', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'even', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'Masters', 'English', 'thesis', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes.All', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'covering', 'essentials', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'story', 'out', 'catching', 'several', 'key', 'elements', 'suspense', 'pace', 'story', 'was', 'less', 'mystery', 'more', 'continuing', 'jumping', 'sequence', 'sequence', 'aura', 'mystery', 'element', 'surprise', 'Not', 'much', 'outside', 'world', 'was', 'covered', '1', 'train', 'shot', 'estate', 'manor', 'north', 'London', 'opium', 'den', 'foggy', 'Thames', 'River', 'scenes', 'opium', 'den', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'wandering', 'Limehouse', 'was', 'best', 'part.The', 'catch', 'getting', 'scared', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'was', 'lacking', 'IMHO', 'got', 'feeling', 'actors', 'were', 'paid', 'say', 'lines', 'was', 'Believe', 'not', 'most', 'acting', 'came', 'bumbling', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'detective', 'other', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre.Witnessing', 'small', 'Indian', 'assassin', 'beginning', 'having', 'actors', 'voice', 'secrets', 'follow', 'ups', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'showing', 'up', 'revealed', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'mystery', 'curse-', 'obviously', '3', 'men', 'greed/revenge.During', 'movie', 'end', 'Sherlock', 'Homes', 'home', 'normal', 'wrong', 'many', 'letters', 'correspondences', 'have', 'been', 'scattered', 'floor', 'letter', 'opener', 'missing', 'putting', 'everything', 'place', 'then', 'fetch', 'police', 'when', 'police', 'were', 'first', 'place', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'haphazard', 'condition', 'residence', 'immediately', 'busted', 'main', 'criminal', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'movie', 'opted', 'deal', 'dragging', 'story', 'out', 'deus-ex-machina', 'arrival', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'end', 'save', 'day', 'Obviously', 'hate', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'deus-ex-machina', 'endings.Sorry', 'love', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'associated', 'workings', 'movies', 'books', 'was', 'allowed', 'rate', 'movie', 'would', 'be', '2.5', 'rated', '3', 'not', 'rating', '2', 'stars', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', '3']",N/A

The film opens in Agra, India during the middle of a revolutionary uprising with British officers conspiring to steal the Maharajah's treasure (one million in jewels). Through deceit, chicanery, and murder the treasure ends up in the hands of Edward Fox and two cohorts who then disappear.30 years later, Holmes (Heston) is solicited by a young woman to search for her father, who has received an important parcel in the mail with blood, a cross, and three sets of thumb prints (part of the sacred blood oath taken by the men in India), to find out the meaning of the parcel.Despite the total absence of any British accent by (the late) Charlton Heston - still, his stately and regal presence on the screen gave this viewer an evening of  enjoyable entertainment. Sherlock purists may find the script weak, but the good acting and atmosphere made it worthwhile. Edward Fox and John Castle are good as the British adversarial characters.I purchased the DVD and received the instant video as a free rental.

Unfortunately, Sherlock Holmes was simply not the right role for an aging Charlton Heston. (Though if you think he couldn't pull off Long John Silver, you would be wrong.) Here, he's simply too ponderous, too American and too lacking in Holmes' mercurial temperament. It might possibly have worked if he'd played Holmes in retirement, but this is set in the heyday of Holmes' career. Nor does Heston's portrayal mesh with the flagrant melodrama of much of the story, though Richard Johnson does a solid Watson and there is support from a good to excellent team of classically trained actors. At the excellent end, I'd put Clive Wood as Jonathan Small (at least in the prologue, as later he is so covered in grotesque make-up and his voice so distorted as to be unrecognizable).  The prologue, set during the Indian mutiny and also featuring John Castle and Edward Fox as the most obnoxious of British officers, is worth a repeat viewing for Wood's nuanced portrayal of a sturdy private who tries to do his duty and is keen on protecting his men (despised natives though they may be) but is caught up in the spiral of death and greed.
