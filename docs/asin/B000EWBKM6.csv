979474,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EWBKM6,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","Like most people I know, I think NBC's ""Will & Grace"" peaked approximately between seasons two and four and has since settled into a predictable rhythm of amusement and frustration compounded by an overuse of guest stars trying to upend their images. However, what remains consistent over the eight seasons is the crack timing of the four principals - Eric McCormack and Debra Messing in the title roles (even as their characters became more neurotically tiresome) and more brilliantly, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally as Jack and Karen, as perfect a match of second bananas as Ted Baxter and Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"".While quickly releasing a DVD of a long-running series finale is becoming standard marketing practice by the networks, it actually seems a shame that a bit more thought was not given to this package even with its bargain price. The final 45-minute episode, of course, is here but not the totality of the full-hour retrospective that preceded it on its May 18 airing, ""Say Goodnight, Gracie"". Instead, there are two featurettes. The first is ""The Final Bow"", which contains backstage footage during the filming of the last episode (versus similar footage taken of the penultimate episode for the retrospective). The second is ""The Last Words"", which extends on the interview portions with the individual cast members shown during the retrospective. Both are serviceable extras but hardly as insightful as one would have hoped given the endurance of the series (for instance, the critical role of fortuitous scheduling as one would think some credit should be given to ""Friends"" as a lead-in on so-called ""Must-See Thursdays""). The most glaring omission, however, is the original pilot episode since there are several direct references to it in the finale, a point lost on anyone who does not remember it.One irrefutable point about the final episode is that the script by series creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, while not even close to the series' best, is completely in sync with the excessive, flamboyant spirit of the show itself. It was obviously not going to be enough to have the four characters play out their goodbyes in real-time. Instead, we get a dream sequence of the four characters sixteen years later; a flash-forward two years later showing Will and Grace reconciling over her perceived betrayal in rejecting Will as her baby's ""father""; and most ludicrously, a fateful meeting eighteen years after that when their respective children end up living in the same college dormitory. I actually think the escalating contrivances are what make this a classic sitcom. It doesn't have to make sense as long as fans are in thrall over how the characters' lives evolve. Detractors certainly have reason to raise their eyebrows, but there are certain pleasures to be experienced, for instance, Jack and Karen's sweetly performed duet of ""Unforgettable"" emboldened by Mullally's supple singing voice and the silly opening dream sequence. I have to admit it would have been a nice tweak had the offspring of Will & Grace been of the same sex and that they marry without incident. To me, that would have summed up one of the underlying messages of this groundbreaking series.",3,Rush Job on DVD Package for Over-the-Top Finale Still Seems Fitting for an Enduring Sitcom,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,3216,"['most', 'people', 'know', 'think', 'NBC', 'Will', 'Grace', 'peaked', 'approximately', 'seasons', 'two', 'four', 'settled', 'predictable', 'rhythm', 'amusement', 'frustration', 'compounded', 'overuse', 'guest', 'stars', 'trying', 'upend', 'images', 'However', 'what', 'consistent', 'eight', 'seasons', 'crack', 'timing', 'four', 'principals', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'title', 'roles', 'even', 'characters', 'became', 'more', 'neurotically', 'tiresome', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'perfect', 'match', 'second', 'bananas', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', '.While', 'quickly', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'long-running', 'series', 'finale', 'becoming', 'standard', 'marketing', 'practice', 'networks', 'actually', 'shame', 'bit', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'package', 'even', 'bargain', 'price', 'final', '45-minute', 'episode', 'course', 'here', 'not', 'totality', 'full-hour', 'retrospective', 'preceded', 'May', '18', 'airing', 'Say', 'Goodnight', 'Gracie', 'Instead', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'first', 'Final', 'Bow', 'backstage', 'footage', 'filming', 'last', 'episode', 'similar', 'footage', 'taken', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'retrospective', 'second', 'Last', 'Words', 'interview', 'portions', 'individual', 'cast', 'members', 'shown', 'retrospective', 'are', 'serviceable', 'extras', 'hardly', 'as', 'insightful', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'given', 'endurance', 'series', 'instance', 'critical', 'role', 'fortuitous', 'scheduling', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Friends', 'lead-in', 'so-called', 'Must-See', 'Thursdays', 'most', 'glaring', 'omission', 'however', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'are', 'several', 'direct', 'references', 'finale', 'point', 'lost', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'remember', 'it.One', 'irrefutable', 'point', 'final', 'episode', 'script', 'series', 'creators', 'David', 'Kohan', 'Max', 'Mutchnick', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'series', 'best', 'completely', 'sync', 'excessive', 'flamboyant', 'spirit', 'show', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'enough', 'have', 'four', 'characters', 'play', 'out', 'goodbyes', 'real-time', 'Instead', 'get', 'dream', 'sequence', 'four', 'characters', 'sixteen', 'years', 'later', 'flash-forward', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'showing', 'Will', 'Grace', 'reconciling', 'perceived', 'betrayal', 'rejecting', 'Will', 'baby', 'father', 'most', 'ludicrously', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'eighteen', 'years', 'when', 'respective', 'children', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'same', 'college', 'dormitory', 'actually', 'think', 'escalating', 'contrivances', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'classic', 'sitcom', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'sense', 'as', 'long', 'fans', 'are', 'thrall', 'how', 'characters', 'lives', 'evolve', 'Detractors', 'certainly', 'have', 'reason', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'certain', 'pleasures', 'be', 'experienced', 'instance', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'sweetly', 'performed', 'duet', 'Unforgettable', 'emboldened', 'Mullally', 'supple', 'singing', 'voice', 'silly', 'opening', 'dream', 'sequence', 'have', 'admit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'tweak', 'had', 'offspring', 'Will', 'Grace', 'been', 'same', 'sex', 'marry', 'incident', 'would', 'have', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'underlying', 'messages', 'groundbreaking', 'series']",N/A
979475,AVQJD41PLPOOQ,B000EWBKM6,Eric F.,"[1, 12]","When I met my wife in 1998, I'd pretty much stopped watching TV due to a lack of ANYTHING I would devote my time to.  She turned me on to WILL & GRACE and I was immediately hooked on it's wacky dialogue and humor.  The classic episode of the leaking push-up bra remains one of the all-time great homages to I LOVE LUCY I've ever seen.Like FRIENDS, though, the last few seasons relied more on guest star appearances as the overall writing became stale, uneven and unoriginalLast night on NBC, it came to an end.  The series finale focussed on the probable outcome of Will and Grace's friendship through the years as they each pursued seperate lives with their significant others and their own children.  Their stories were touching and bittersweet, especially the sequence when their children meet in college and end up marrying each other.Unfortunately, the episode as a whole was ruined by the one element that used to play a big part in the show's comedy; namely Jack and Karen.  The comedy that was written for their characters was not only stupid, but unnecessary to the bittersweet (there's that word again) point the episode was trying to make.I mean, come on!  Karen hooking up with motorcycle-dyke Rosario?  Beverly Leslie getting caught and killed in a gust of wind off the balcony?  Is that really how the finale wanted to be remembered?  I personally would have kept Jack and Karen off the episode until their ""Unforgettable"" duet together.Well, it's over now; and I no longer have any reason what-so-ever to watch any broadcast television, because frankly, it's ALL garbage!

979481,ABDAHMRYSMMIV,B000EWBKM6,"John Ellis ""jonthes""","[2, 6]","""Will and Grace"" was stylish, moderately daring for network television with very talented performers and guests. The finale was too much poised on a fence, not dramatic enough to be really moving but not funny either. For all the gay humor, only two of the characters were gay out of the entire extended family. One of them was nearly a closet case and still too inhibited to put his arm around his life partner at the end; the other ended up living with his drug abusing female friend, who oddly never aged in spite of alcoholism and worse, a strange message. Like ""Seinfeld"" all the characters were selfish to the point of being obnoxious, particularly Grace, but on ""Seinfeld"" there was some self-knowledge about that, in fact that was the subject of the finale. For this reason I don't think it will age well. Moments like Minnie Driver dropping the booty she'd stored in various orafices and Debbie Reynolds getting her stole caught in the door will hold up, but the slick and tame way much of the comic drama was handled won't, in fact hasn't already. The cast is very talented and I hope most of them end up on stage in musicals, but I suspect their television careers will never shed these characters' shadows. The next gay network comedy will owe a lot to ""Will and Grace"", but here's hoping it's about two men in love instead of a man who'd rather be married to his high school girl friend if she only were properly endowed.

979485,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000EWBKM6,Melissa Niksic,"[19, 28]","I was not a consistent ""Will & Grace"" viewer over the years, although I did tune in occasionally. I thought the premise of the show was great when it first came out, but Debra Messing and Sean Hayes both kind of annoyed me. Of course, all four of the main characters on the show are supposed to be annoying in their own right, and Grace and Jack eventually grew on me after a while. I think the show was at its peak during the third, fourth, and fifth seasons, which is when I watched it the most. Then the character of Will started getting on my nerves around season six and I think the show began to lose some of its momentum, so I watched it much less regularly. I did tune in for the series finale, though, and overall I thought it was pretty good. (Warning: don't keep reading if you want to avoid spoilers!)Will and Grace both had a lot of romantic ups and downs over the years. Leo and Vince were my favorite love interests for them, so I was very happy that those two couples ended up together. However, it kind of sucked that Will and Grace drifted apart for so long. I was hoping that they'd reconcile after their two-year fight and then live happily ever after, but it didn't quite work out that way. Even though Will and Grace did make amends, their lives and families took them in two different directions and they didn't see each other at all for the next 16 years. When Will's son and Grace's daughter bumped into each other at college, they didn't even know each other! I thought that was kind of depressing. Still, it was kind of cool that Will and Grace ended up living vicariously through their children as Ben and Lila basically relived the way their parents met. Like Will and Grace, Ben and Lila hit it off instantly. They ended up getting married, and in that way, Will and Grace were eventually bonded by marriage, which was pretty cool.It was nice to see Karen and Jack living together after so many years. The duet that they sang was actually quite touching...they're both very talented vocalists. (I also love that Karen didn't age at all! Megan Mullally was always my favorite part of the show. Karen Walker rocks.) The quick appearance by Kevin Bacon was a nice touch, especially since one of the best things about ""Will & Grace"" is that it featured so many fantastic guest stars over the years. (I wish the writers could have figured out a way to bring back Michael Douglas for the finale...the episode with him is one of my favorite ""Will & Grace"" shows ever!) I also liked the final scene that showed the gang doing shots in the bar, just like old times.One random thing that bugged me...did anyone notice that Lila's hair was almost black when she was shown as a two-year-old, but then it magically turned the same shade of red as her mother's by the time she headed off to college? Similarly, Ben looked like an African American child as a two-year-old, but he was the splitting image of Eric McCormack when he was 18 years old. What was up with that?! Is there that much of a child's actor shortage in Hollywood? I doubt it.Again, I think it kind of sucked that Will and Grace spent almost 20 years apart, but maybe the point of that was to illustrate that the bond between them was so strong that they never would have been able to go off on their own and form lasting relationships with other people if they'd remained as close as they always had been. Regardless, Will and Grace ended up together at the end, and that's all that really matters. I don't think the series finale of ""Will & Grace"" will go down as being one of the best finales in television sitcom history, but it certainly wasn't the worst, either.

Yikes!)",3,"""Say goodnight, Gracie.""",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3700,"['was', 'not', 'consistent', 'Will', 'Grace', 'viewer', 'years', 'did', 'tune', 'occasionally', 'thought', 'premise', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'course', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'annoying', 'own', 'right', 'Grace', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'grew', 'while', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'peak', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'when', 'watched', 'most', 'Then', 'character', 'Will', 'started', 'getting', 'nerves', 'season', 'six', 'think', 'show', 'began', 'lose', 'momentum', 'watched', 'much', 'less', 'regularly', 'did', 'tune', 'series', 'finale', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Warning', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'reading', 'want', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'Will', 'Grace', 'had', 'lot', 'romantic', 'ups', 'downs', 'years', 'Leo', 'Vince', 'were', 'favorite', 'love', 'interests', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'two', 'couples', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'However', 'kind', 'sucked', 'Will', 'Grace', 'drifted', 'apart', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'reconcile', 'two-year', 'fight', 'then', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'Even', 'Will', 'Grace', 'did', 'make', 'amends', 'lives', 'families', 'took', 'two', 'different', 'directions', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'next', '16', 'years', 'When', 'Will', 'son', 'Grace', 'daughter', 'bumped', 'other', 'college', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'other', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'depressing', 'Still', 'was', 'kind', 'cool', 'Will', 'Grace', 'ended', 'up', 'living', 'vicariously', 'children', 'Ben', 'Lila', 'basically', 'relived', 'way', 'parents', 'met', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Ben', 'Lila', 'hit', 'off', 'instantly', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'way', 'Will', 'Grace', 'were', 'eventually', 'bonded', 'marriage', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Karen', 'Jack', 'living', 'together', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'duet', 'sang', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'touching', ""'re"", 'very', 'talented', 'vocalists', 'also', 'love', 'Karen', 'did', ""n't"", 'age', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'part', 'show', 'Karen', 'Walker', 'rocks', 'quick', 'appearance', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'especially', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'Will', 'Grace', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'fantastic', 'guest', 'stars', 'years', 'wish', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'bring', 'back', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'finale', 'episode', 'one', 'favorite', 'Will', 'Grace', 'ever', 'also', 'liked', 'final', 'scene', 'showed', 'gang', 'doing', 'shots', 'bar', 'just', 'old', 'times.One', 'random', 'thing', 'bugged', 'did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'Lila', 'hair', 'was', 'almost', 'black', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'two-year-old', 'then', 'magically', 'turned', 'same', 'shade', 'red', 'mother', 'time', 'headed', 'off', 'college', 'Similarly', 'Ben', 'looked', 'African', 'American', 'child', 'two-year-old', 'was', 'splitting', 'image', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'when', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'there', 'that', 'much', 'child', 'actor', 'shortage', 'Hollywood', 'doubt', 'it.Again', 'think', 'kind', 'sucked', 'Will', 'Grace', 'spent', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'apart', 'maybe', 'point', 'was', 'illustrate', 'bond', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'form', 'lasting', 'relationships', 'other', 'people', ""'d"", 'remained', 'as', 'close', 'always', 'had', 'been', 'Regardless', 'Will', 'Grace', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'end', 'really', 'matters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'finale', 'Will', 'Grace', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'finales', 'television', 'sitcom', 'history', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'Remember', 'how', 'butchered', 'Seinfeld']",N/A
979486,A35FEM4C0LQTPN,B000EWBKM6,Mike Leone,"[71, 78]","I very much enjoyed the Will & Grace finale last night.  The only quibble I had was that I thought the final scene with Rosario was a little mean-spirited, if in keeping with her and Karen's generally adversarial relationship.  That's about it as far as negatives for me.  (I was also hoping we'd finally get more of a glimpse of Stan than his feet, but maybe in the reunion show...)I liked the scene with the guy in the body cast, who ""came out"" with the same revelation as we've seen happen with other characters in the show.  In that sense, he reminded me of the guy who was sitting next to Will that time that he and Leo went to a sports event.  And there have been others like those two as well.I was okay with the story taking those several big jumps into the future.  It sort of reminded me of all those films that end with text on the screen describing what eventually happened to each character.  American Graffiti is the one that comes to mind, although I've seen that same technique in numerous other films.  It was very satisfying to see some of those events portrayed on the screen rather than just to read about them.I didn't have a big problem with Will & Grace losing touch with each other for those many years.  Believing that could happen to two such good friends did require some sort of suspension of disbelief.  And, then again, that kind of thing does happen in real life, and their long separation from each other also served to set up the situation with their becoming reunited under the unusual circumstances that they did, as well as their becoming relatives (and I thought the two actors who portrayed their college-age children were absolutely perfect, by the way).  And on the plus side, it was nice to see that Will and Grace were able to find truly fulfilling relationships (with Vince and Leo respectively), something which no doubt contributed to their losing touch with each other.Still, the highlight of the program was the final three scenes, all of which brought us full circle from the first episode.  I couldn't watch any of them dry-eyed.First there was the beautiful Karen-Jack scene with their singing of ""Unforgettable,"" which has already been commented on several times here, and which ended with the two of them repeating a gesture that was part of their first scene together.Then there was the wonderful Grace-Will telephone scene that mirrored the very first scene of the series.  They were both watching the same television program they had been watching 20 years ago (talk about suspension of disbelief!), and some of the dialogue was identical, as well as a reference to one particular actor from that program.The final scene took place in the same setting as the final scene of the first program, with Will choosing it as the place for the four of them to meet as he recalled what happened when they were there the last time.  His reference to the other characters who were in the original scene brought to mind all the wonderful guests, both one-time and recurring, who have been a part of the program since its beginning.  And then the last program ended with a kiss between the two title characters, just as the first program did.The four leads appeared on the Today show the morning of the final program.  When Katie Couric (one of the many guests on Will & Grace over the years) asked them if they were satisfied with the final episode, Eric McCormack said that it was ambitious and went far beyond the endings of most sitcoms.  I found the ending completely satisfying, and just a reminder of how much I'm going to miss this modern-day version of Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel.
