1334347,A3LUUF8CAWLPHX,B0039WGU82,"Amazon Customer ""bluejaye""","[11, 12]","When a fairy tale resonates enough to be told and retold over several centuries, as many of Charles Perrault's folktale adaptations have, one must presume them to hold a certain quality that transcends the typical story. Bluebeard, for instance, being so dark and laced with such innate fears, would perhaps qualify for a modern spin. Times indeed have changed somewhat since Perrault first set word to page, and though Bluebeard has been adapted many times since, there's always room for a new version, that's part of the beauty of a folk tale isn't it? That spin that's added over time?Director Catherine Briellat's version achieves only in flattening out the depth in the tale, of leaching the fear from the characters, and washing over the cinematic pallet with cheap Hal loween style costumes and reused sets. Yes, yes, I see that perhaps the `staged' quality of the Bluebeard story within a story (two little girls are actually reading the book in the 50s) may imply that it is `constructed' within the mind - a fiction. And yes, I get that the cheap costumes may serve metaphorically to emphasis that riches are only on the surface, and that this `rags' to `riches' tale is a trap. And finally, yes, I see that perhaps the reusing of the sets may imply that the lead - Bluebeard's young wife - really doesn't get anywhere, her journey is stagnated. Alas, the potential for metaphor is bursting from this over-ripe fruit in place of flavor and emotion.The two tales, that of Bluebeard in its Renaissance Fair setting, and the sisters reading the story in their treasure trove attic, are oddly disconnected. While the four young girls are charming enough to carry a well directed film, here they seem to just be doing there own thing, just with memorized lines. Only the long still shots work in this film. So much so that as images in a story book, a selection of well staged shots might serve Briellat better. When run together as a film, it's a mess.With all the negativity aside, I've seen worse films. I do think this film has a few things going for it, though perhaps not intentionally so. I was deeply engaged as I watched, trying to piece together something that ultimately was not there, but anytime a film engages you, it stands to some degree above others that do not. Perhaps others may find more here than I, but I can't recommend.",2,Some kinda blue,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2349,"['When', 'fairy', 'tale', 'enough', 'be', 'told', 'retold', 'several', 'centuries', 'many', 'Charles', 'Perrault', 'folktale', 'adaptations', 'have', 'one', 'must', 'presume', 'hold', 'certain', 'quality', 'typical', 'story', 'Bluebeard', 'instance', 'being', 'so', 'dark', 'laced', 'such', 'innate', 'fears', 'would', 'perhaps', 'qualify', 'modern', 'spin', 'Times', 'indeed', 'have', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'Perrault', 'first', 'set', 'word', 'page', 'Bluebeard', 'been', 'adapted', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'room', 'new', 'version', 'part', 'beauty', 'folk', 'tale', ""n't"", 'spin', 'added', 'time', 'Director', 'Catherine', 'Briellat', 'version', 'only', 'flattening', 'out', 'depth', 'tale', 'leaching', 'fear', 'characters', 'washing', 'cinematic', 'pallet', 'cheap', 'Hal', 'loween', 'style', 'costumes', 'reused', 'sets', 'Yes', 'yes', 'see', 'perhaps', 'staged', 'quality', 'Bluebeard', 'story', 'story', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'actually', 'reading', 'book', '50s', 'may', 'imply', 'constructed', 'mind', 'fiction', 'yes', 'get', 'cheap', 'costumes', 'may', 'serve', 'metaphorically', 'emphasis', 'riches', 'are', 'only', 'surface', 'rags', 'riches', 'tale', 'trap', 'finally', 'yes', 'see', 'perhaps', 'reusing', 'sets', 'may', 'imply', 'lead', 'Bluebeard', 'young', 'wife', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'journey', 'stagnated', 'Alas', 'potential', 'metaphor', 'bursting', 'over-ripe', 'fruit', 'place', 'flavor', 'emotion.The', 'two', 'tales', 'Bluebeard', 'Renaissance', 'Fair', 'setting', 'sisters', 'reading', 'story', 'treasure', 'attic', 'are', 'oddly', 'disconnected', 'four', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'charming', 'enough', 'carry', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'here', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'doing', 'there', 'own', 'thing', 'just', 'memorized', 'lines', 'Only', 'long', 'still', 'shots', 'work', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'so', 'images', 'story', 'book', 'selection', 'well', 'staged', 'shots', 'might', 'serve', 'Briellat', 'better', 'When', 'run', 'together', 'film', 'mess.With', 'negativity', 'aside', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'films', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'though', 'perhaps', 'not', 'intentionally', 'so', 'was', 'deeply', 'engaged', 'watched', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'something', 'ultimately', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'anytime', 'film', 'degree', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'Perhaps', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Bluebeard

I saw nothing hillarious or edgy about this really dull film that could easily have been made a short, rather than a feature.It's two stories in one. On one hand are two young sisters, one reading to the other the 'horror' story of Bluebeard. The other story is that tale acted out.Two other sisters are kicked out of a convent-school because their father has died. Impoverished one marries Bluebeard the local lord who has a reputation of killing all his wives a year after the marriage.Of course one would marry him! That's one of the dumb story elements. The other is that Bluebeard leaves his young bride, gives her keys to all the rooms in the castle, including one room he forbids her to go into.She goes in, and there's the bodies of his previous wives. He returns and has to kill her. And here's the next dumb plot - it's very wordy French film at its worse as she accepts that she'll die, but asks for time to prepare - really to go to the tower and just happens to be able to signal passers-by.

I know many, many people who revere her films as masterpieces of transgressive cinema; I know an equal number, give or take a few, who find them loathsome, exploitative crap masquerading as art cinema. I can see both sides of the argument, but I have yet to be able to figure out which side of it I'm on. There just isn't anything about Breillat's work that excites me one way or the other; I seem to have this same problem with Gaspar Noe. While Bluebeard&#8212;of the Breillat works I have seen to date, by far the most accessible to a general audience&#8212;did not break through that barrier, it's come the closest.If you know your fairy tales, you know the story here. Unspeakably wealthy chap Bluebeard (22 Bullets' Dominique Thomas) goes looking for a wife and stumbles upon beautiful, innocent Marie-Catherine (Goodbye First Love's Lola Cr&eacute;ton). The two have a whirlwind romance, get married, and then Bluebeard has to go away on business. He gives Marie-Catherine the run of the castle, with one exception&#8212;there's one door she can't open. But, of course, he gives her the key anyway. (Chastity belt analogy, anyone?) Will she be able to resist temptation to look behind that door and see what secrets Bluebeard has hidden away?Breillat, of course, gives us more than that. Bluebeard and Marie-Catherine do not live in a vacuum; while Marie-Catherine's fortunes have risen mightily in the world, she makes the effort to keep ties to her family, especially her sister (Monsieur Batgnole's Daphn&eacute; Baiwir), and Breillat sets a framing device in place regarding a pair of contemporary sisters (Marilou Lopes-Benites in her first screen role and Lady Blood's Lola Giovannetti), one of whom is reading the story to the other. Which sounds like a horrid piece of artifice, and if you've seen more than one Breillat film you know that's a possibility&#8212;but it works here better than it does in something like Fat Girl. (I want to compare it, oddly, to Svankmajer, but I didn't make enough notes to draw that comparison convincingly, so I'll just leave that out there.)Never encountered Breillat before? Encountered her and were unimpressed? Give Barbe Bleue a try; it may just change your mind. *** ",4,Behind the Black Door.,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2338,"['Barbe', 'Bleue', 'Bluebeard', 'Catherine', 'Breillat', '2009', 'have', 'odd', 'relationship', 'works', 'Catherine', 'Breillat', 'know', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'revere', 'films', 'masterpieces', 'transgressive', 'cinema', 'know', 'equal', 'number', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'who', 'find', 'loathsome', 'exploitative', 'crap', 'masquerading', 'art', 'cinema', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'argument', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'side', ""'m"", 'just', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Breillat', 'work', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'Gaspar', 'Noe', 'Bluebeard', '8212', 'Breillat', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'far', 'most', 'accessible', 'general', 'audience', '8212', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'barrier', 'come', 'closest.If', 'know', 'fairy', 'tales', 'know', 'story', 'here', 'Unspeakably', 'wealthy', 'chap', 'Bluebeard', '22', 'Bullets', 'Dominique', 'Thomas', 'looking', 'wife', 'stumbles', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'Marie-Catherine', 'Goodbye', 'First', 'Love', 'Lola', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'ton', 'two', 'have', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'Bluebeard', 'go', 'away', 'business', 'Marie-Catherine', 'run', 'castle', 'one', 'exception', '8212', 'one', 'door', 'ca', ""n't"", 'open', 'course', 'key', 'anyway', 'Chastity', 'belt', 'analogy', 'anyone', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'temptation', 'look', 'door', 'see', 'what', 'Bluebeard', 'hidden', 'away', 'Breillat', 'course', 'more', 'Bluebeard', 'Marie-Catherine', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'vacuum', 'Marie-Catherine', 'fortunes', 'have', 'risen', 'mightily', 'world', 'effort', 'keep', 'ties', 'family', 'especially', 'sister', 'Monsieur', 'Batgnole', 'Daphn', 'eacute', 'Baiwir', 'Breillat', 'framing', 'device', 'place', 'regarding', 'pair', 'contemporary', 'sisters', 'Marilou', 'Lopes-Benites', 'first', 'screen', 'role', 'Lady', 'Blood', 'Lola', 'Giovannetti', 'one', 'whom', 'reading', 'story', 'other', 'Which', 'horrid', 'piece', 'artifice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'one', 'Breillat', 'film', 'know', 'possibility', '8212', 'here', 'better', 'something', 'Fat', 'Girl', 'want', 'compare', 'oddly', 'Svankmajer', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'notes', 'draw', 'comparison', 'convincingly', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'there', 'Never', 'encountered', 'Breillat', 'Encountered', 'were', 'unimpressed', 'Give', 'Barbe', 'Bleue', 'try', 'may', 'just', 'change', 'mind', '***']",Bluebeard

For example,  possessing a high self-confidence, having self-control (i.e., power), and being focused (i.e., consistently being in The Now) are far more important than being naturally handsome.Bluebeard is self-conscience about his unattractive looks - especially his blue beard; therefore, after Marie-Catherine's father dies and leaves her with no dowry, Bluebeard invites Marie, her sister and a bevy of other poor maidens to the castle, because he is &#34;generous&#34; and is willing to help one of them escape poverty through marriage without the need of a dowry.Despite their wide age-gap, Bluebeard's blue beard, and his low self-esteem, Marie is extremely eager to marry Blue Beard.

1334354,A3AAMRYV2RLUIV,B0039WGU82,William Shriver,"[16, 18]","Catherine Breillat often confounds me in her work, but BLUEBEARD is relatively straightforward, and I felt I was tracking the whole way. It should be said that there are two parallel stories, one set in the 15th century, and the other set in the 1950's. I suppose there could be some controversy over which story is supposed to reflect on the other, or whether we really have to choose at all. Suffice it to say, the two stories alternate, somewhat like the present and past segments in Godard's WEEKEND or Bunuel's MILKY WAY. BLUEBEARD clearly resembles those films in it's complete disregard of verisimilitude. What interests Breillat is not realism, but iconography. It simply doesn't matter that the wardrobe appears as if it was rented from the corner costume shop.The Bluebeard story is framed by two sisters who are reading the story in the 1950's. The younger of the two, ""Catherine,"" has surpassed her older sister emotionally and academically and enjoys scaring her with her bloody descriptions of the Bluebeard story. It is a dynamic of sibling rivalry whose ending is at least as dire as that of ""Bluebeard"" itself.The 15th century story concerns two other sisters who are (hilariously, to my taste) ejected from parochial school when their father dies. Now impoverished, the younger sister, Marie-Catherine, agrees to marry Bluebeard to save her family's fortunes. This portion of the film has more of the old familiar reversals of sexual dynamics that we have come to love and loathe in Breillat's work.As a whole, the movie has many very funny moments. If you only know Breillat from the likes of FAT GIRL or BRIEF CROSSING, I promise you will be surprised and delighted. Nothing against those films. FAT GIRL made me revere Breillat, and BRIEF CROSSING so infuriated me, I have no choice but to regard it as a total success.Still, among the ten Breillat films seen stateside since 1988, this is easily the most pleasant and approachable, without abandoning the themes the director has been working at so consistently.

1334355,A1HD6I8YQPCJA7,B0039WGU82,ZuluQueen,"[6, 7]","Catherine Breillat's ""Bluebeard"" is elegant, but slow and sleek. The movie is 78 minutes long, and the conflict takes a long time to show up. The beginning of the film, while an important part to any story, drags its feet and numbs the audience. Viewers might have a hard time enjoying this otherwise decent film because it takes a while to get started.There are two stories--one of two little girls who read ""Bluebeard"" in an attic, and one of two young women who experience it. Both pairs are sisters.Marilou Lopes-Benites plays the funny and engaging little girl who reads to her squeamish older sister. Their scenes occasionally interrupt the main story. What is storytelling in the attic becomes narration in Bluebeard's world. Lola Cr&eacute;ton plays the precocious young woman who eventually marries Bluebeard, an aristocrat who is rumored to have killed all his previous wives.These two actresses, along with Bluebeard himself (Dominique Thomas) are the ones to watch. Their actions actually contribute to the story. The other two sisters do nothing but oppose and hinder their siblings.But time goes by very slowly in Bluebeard's world. There are a lot of uneventful scenes. Sometimes the characters are simply feasting, which adds to the dark sensuality of the film, but does nothing for the story itself.""Bluebeard"" is also sleek because it isn't weighed down by a lot of extraneous plotlines. Once Bluebeard gets married again, the film focuses on the married couple and how they interact. Nor is the screen cluttered; every mise en sc&egrave;ne is very minimalist.Bluebeard's environment is also nice to look at. The food looks appetizing, and the eaters seem to enjoy themselves. There are also statues, jewels, and rich dresses.It's a wonder Brellait managed to make the film as long as she did; fairy tales usually don't take that long to tell. But she excels at two things: painting a visually exquisite picture of a simple story, and making it dark and scary enough that adults will want to watch it without their kids.Bluebeard is a very suspicious person, and the nonchalant way he talks with his newest bride might put audiences on high alert, which can be both thrilling and nerve-wracking.But the director dedicates the majority of the film to the first half of the plot, rather than the second.
