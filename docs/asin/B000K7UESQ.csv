The animation is good, and the designs are beautiful.  While I definitely prefer subtitles, the dub wasn't bad at all.  Despite her lackluster performance as Nyu/Lucy of Elfen Lied, Kira Vincent-Davis does a great job with Elulu.  I'm looking forward to seeing more of this as it comes out.A note on the rating: While it seems like a good show, Utawarerumono fails to impress like some other anime.  Only time will tell if Uta' turns out to be as good as its start.",4,Unexpected Find,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,628,"['was', 'able', 'catch', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'first', 'second', 'episode', 'Utawarerumono', 'what', 'mouthful', 'Demand', 'other', 'day', 'was', 'nothing', 'pleased', 'animation', 'good', 'designs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'subtitles', 'dub', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'Nyu/Lucy', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'Kira', 'Vincent-Davis', 'great', 'job', 'Elulu', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'out.A', 'note', 'rating', 'good', 'show', 'Utawarerumono', 'impress', 'other', 'anime', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'Uta', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'start']","Utawarerumono, Volume 1: Mask of a Stranger"

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","A mysterious man, a village and the war that cometh.This is the story of ""UTAWARERUMONO"", a 26-episode anime TV series which aired in Japan in 2006 and is based on a PC and PlayStation 2 video game from Aqua PLUS and LEAF.The story revolves around a man who wears a mask.Found wounded and left for dead in the forest, an apprentice healer named Elulu brings the man to her village and helps nurse back to health.The man has no recollection of his past and is not sure why he wears a mask but he does have images of destruction that comes and passes into his memory.At first glance, I actually thought this series would be something along the lines of a ""SLAYERS"" wannabe series.  I was definitely wrong with that assumption.As much as the series has its times of humor, the storyline is very well-written, smart, violent and at times serious.In a way, you can say that it reminds me of the time I watched the popular series ""Record of Lodoss War"" for the first time.The first episode introduces us to the man with the masked who will later be named Hakuoro.  Also, apprentice healer Elulu and her little sister Aruru and their grandmother.You learn about the village and their fears of the forest god who wreaks vengeance against the villagers until one night the god or beast attacks the village.Episode 2 features the village contemplating what they can do to appease the god or to destroy it.Episode 3 introduces us to a careless fighter from another village named Oboro and his sick sister Yuzuha and what he will do to save his sister.Episode 4 deals with the repercussions of Oboro's actions, a major character death and the beginning of the war that the villagers will have to face against the oppressive government and its selfish and maniacal king who wants the villagers destroyed and massacred.  And the villagers look towards Hakuoro to lead them.The series is definitely action-packed and definitely intriguing.  It has an Akira Kurosawa ""Seven Samurai"" type feel that you root for Hakuoro and the villagers and hope they are able to stand up against the evil government and its soldiers.The DVD features the first four episodes.  The animation is very well done and both Japanese and English dubbed voice acting are very well done.DVD extras include an omake theater, extended episode reviews, character art gallery, glossary of terms and a booklet featuring an interview with the screenwriter and voice actors for Oboro and Yuzuha.""UTAWARERUMONO"" is riveting, must-see series which each episode ending with somewhat of a cliffhanger that you want more.Not only is it a series about friendship and caring but it's also a series about the price of war and how people are brought together through unfortunate circumstances.This series is highly, highly recommended.",5,A riviting must-see anime series!,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2777,"['mysterious', 'man', 'village', 'war', 'cometh.This', 'story', 'UTAWARERUMONO', '26-episode', 'anime', 'TV', 'series', 'aired', 'Japan', '2006', 'based', 'PC', 'PlayStation', '2', 'video', 'game', 'Aqua', 'PLUS', 'LEAF.The', 'story', 'around', 'man', 'who', 'mask.Found', 'wounded', 'left', 'dead', 'forest', 'apprentice', 'healer', 'named', 'Elulu', 'man', 'village', 'nurse', 'back', 'health.The', 'man', 'recollection', 'past', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'mask', 'have', 'images', 'destruction', 'memory.At', 'first', 'glance', 'actually', 'thought', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'lines', 'SLAYERS', 'wannabe', 'series', 'was', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'assumption.As', 'much', 'series', 'times', 'humor', 'storyline', 'very', 'well-written', 'smart', 'violent', 'times', 'serious.In', 'way', 'can', 'say', 'time', 'watched', 'popular', 'series', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'first', 'time.The', 'first', 'episode', 'introduces', 'man', 'masked', 'who', 'will', 'later', 'be', 'named', 'Hakuoro', 'Also', 'apprentice', 'healer', 'Elulu', 'little', 'sister', 'Aruru', 'grandmother.You', 'learn', 'village', 'fears', 'forest', 'god', 'who', 'vengeance', 'villagers', 'one', 'night', 'god', 'beast', 'attacks', 'village.Episode', '2', 'village', 'contemplating', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'appease', 'god', 'destroy', 'it.Episode', '3', 'introduces', 'careless', 'fighter', 'village', 'named', 'Oboro', 'sick', 'sister', 'Yuzuha', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'save', 'sister.Episode', '4', 'deals', 'repercussions', 'Oboro', 'actions', 'major', 'character', 'death', 'beginning', 'war', 'villagers', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'oppressive', 'government', 'selfish', 'maniacal', 'king', 'who', 'villagers', 'destroyed', 'massacred', 'villagers', 'look', 'towards', 'Hakuoro', 'lead', 'them.The', 'series', 'definitely', 'action-packed', 'definitely', 'intriguing', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'type', 'feel', 'root', 'Hakuoro', 'villagers', 'hope', 'are', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'evil', 'government', 'soldiers.The', 'DVD', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Japanese', 'English', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'acting', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'omake', 'theater', 'extended', 'episode', 'reviews', 'character', 'art', 'gallery', 'glossary', 'terms', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'interview', 'screenwriter', 'voice', 'actors', 'Oboro', 'Yuzuha', 'UTAWARERUMONO', 'riveting', 'must-see', 'series', 'episode', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'cliffhanger', 'want', 'more.Not', 'only', 'series', 'friendship', 'caring', 'also', 'series', 'price', 'war', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances.This', 'series', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommended']","Utawarerumono, Volume 1: Mask of a Stranger"

Along with her Grandmother and little sister, Eruru nurses him back to health.He  When he awakens, he has no memory. He is, however, well educated in many ways. He decides to stay with the villagers and help them in their tough time. An oppressive emperor rules over the land and brings hardship to his people. In a sad twist of fate, Eruru's Grandmother is killed. The villagers rally behind the masked man, now know as Hakuoro, and begin to launch a rebellion against the emperor. As their success grows, more villagers fight with Hakuoro and the others. The action and drama are fantastic.So far this series is very impressive. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and story are all top notch. There are lots of awesome characters, and plot twits. This anime falls under the fantasy genre. The people have animal ears and tails, there are also mythical creatures and spirits. I am always a little reluctant to watch a series with a masked hero for some reason. I guess that sort of thing is just played out. Even so, this anime exceeds my expectations. I hope that it continues to impress me.

First couple episodes are slow to build a connection to the earthy villager, but the action comes quick and darker themes are explored not long after.This series was adapted from a hentai action game, but like Fate/Stay Night, does not contain sexual scenes.  Only the plot and subtle references remain. Eruruu's (or Eluluu as credited for the dub) reaction to having her tail touched, remains for instance, but the androgenous twin archers are portrayed as feminine.I have not heard the Dub yet so can give no opinion on the quality, but good VAs have been cast by ADV, including Kira Vincent-Daivs, Greg Ayres, and Monica Rial.",5,The One Being Sung,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,701,"['Utawarerumono', 'beautiful', 'series', 'accessable', 'fans', 'many', 'genres', 'First', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'slow', 'build', 'connection', 'earthy', 'villager', 'action', 'quick', 'darker', 'themes', 'are', 'explored', 'not', 'long', 'after.This', 'series', 'was', 'adapted', 'hentai', 'action', 'game', 'Fate/Stay', 'Night', 'not', 'contain', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'Only', 'plot', 'subtle', 'references', 'remain', 'Eruruu', 'Eluluu', 'credited', 'dub', 'reaction', 'having', 'tail', 'touched', 'instance', 'androgenous', 'twin', 'archers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'feminine.I', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'Dub', 'yet', 'so', 'can', 'give', 'opinion', 'quality', 'good', 'VAs', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'ADV', 'including', 'Kira', 'Vincent-Daivs', 'Greg', 'Ayres', 'Monica', 'Rial']","Utawarerumono, Volume 1: Mask of a Stranger"
1031513,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000K7UESQ,Sesho,"[0, 11]","When a masked man is found left for dead in the forest, a dog/goat eared girl named Eluluu, the granddaughter of the village chief, takes it upon herself to heal him back to health. The man does not know who he is, how he came to be in the woods, or the reason why he is wearing a mask which he cannot remove. The only memory he has is of the sharp jaws of a roaring monster which comes to him in his nightmares. The village that Elullu lives in isn't exactly going through peaceful times. In addition to an exploitive feudal lord that exacts tribute from them, the local god, Mutikapa, a huge white and black striped tiger, is pissed about one of its shrines being destroyed and is exacting revenge upon the local populace. With the arrival of the masked stranger, who seems to know his way around a battlefield, the villagers gain some confidence that might be able to fight against not only their lord, but their god as well!Utawarerumono is derivative of many Japanese films as well as American Westerns in which a lone stranger appears in a repressed village or town, only to train the grovelers into a deadly fighting force. But the film that this first volume reminded me the most of was the 1995 Mel Gibson vehicle Braveheart. As in that movie, Hakuoro forces the villagers to make a choice through one deadly action on his part, thereby changing all of their destinies. While some aspects of this show are commendable such as the theme of people revolting against tyranny, these deeper strokes are pretty much drowned out by the cheap parlor tricks of animal ears, bishonen pretty boys, and too cute females. The whole dog ear gimmick just became troublesome and dumb to me after a while. I can handle only one cat girl per series, so having a whole population of animal eared people was a just a bit of an overdose. There isn't really an explanation yet as to why some have the ears while others seem to be fully human. The animation seems a bit blocky and unfinished with too much linework that didn't have to time to be properly shaded. Oh, lest I forget, everybody stand up for the stereotypical sickly little sister who doesn't have too much longer to live and that never opens her eyes. She just constantly coos and coughs in an effort to make the audience feel sorry for her. Volume 1 had no sense of flow, zipping from one scene to the next, sometimes covering weeks or months with no acknowledgement of its truncated timeline. All in all, a thoroughly subpar series so far.",2,TAKE OFF YOUR MASK DUDE,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2491,"['When', 'masked', 'man', 'found', 'left', 'dead', 'forest', 'dog/goat', 'eared', 'girl', 'named', 'Eluluu', 'granddaughter', 'village', 'chief', 'heal', 'back', 'health', 'man', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'woods', 'reason', 'why', 'wearing', 'mask', 'can', 'not', 'remove', 'only', 'memory', 'sharp', 'jaws', 'roaring', 'monster', 'nightmares', 'village', 'Elullu', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'going', 'peaceful', 'times', 'addition', 'exploitive', 'feudal', 'lord', 'tribute', 'local', 'god', 'Mutikapa', 'huge', 'white', 'black', 'striped', 'tiger', 'pissed', 'one', 'shrines', 'being', 'destroyed', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'local', 'populace', 'arrival', 'masked', 'stranger', 'who', 'know', 'way', 'battlefield', 'villagers', 'gain', 'confidence', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'fight', 'not', 'only', 'lord', 'god', 'well', 'Utawarerumono', 'derivative', 'many', 'Japanese', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'Westerns', 'lone', 'stranger', 'repressed', 'village', 'town', 'only', 'train', 'grovelers', 'deadly', 'fighting', 'force', 'film', 'first', 'volume', 'reminded', 'most', 'was', '1995', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'vehicle', 'Braveheart', 'movie', 'Hakuoro', 'villagers', 'make', 'choice', 'one', 'deadly', 'action', 'part', 'thereby', 'changing', 'destinies', 'aspects', 'show', 'are', 'commendable', 'such', 'theme', 'people', 'revolting', 'tyranny', 'deeper', 'strokes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'drowned', 'out', 'cheap', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'animal', 'ears', 'bishonen', 'pretty', 'too', 'cute', 'females', 'whole', 'dog', 'ear', 'gimmick', 'just', 'became', 'troublesome', 'dumb', 'while', 'can', 'handle', 'only', 'one', 'cat', 'girl', 'series', 'having', 'whole', 'population', 'animal', 'eared', 'people', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'overdose', ""n't"", 'really', 'explanation', 'yet', 'why', 'have', 'ears', 'others', 'seem', 'be', 'fully', 'human', 'animation', 'bit', 'blocky', 'unfinished', 'too', 'much', 'linework', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'be', 'properly', 'shaded', 'Oh', 'lest', 'forget', 'everybody', 'stand', 'up', 'stereotypical', 'sickly', 'little', 'sister', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'longer', 'live', 'never', 'eyes', 'just', 'constantly', 'coos', 'coughs', 'effort', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Volume', '1', 'had', 'sense', 'flow', 'zipping', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'sometimes', 'covering', 'weeks', 'months', 'acknowledgement', 'truncated', 'timeline', 'thoroughly', 'subpar', 'series', 'so', 'far']","Utawarerumono, Volume 1: Mask of a Stranger"
