The Sesame Street gang show up, and it turns out there is a Fraggle hole in the house to allow the Fraggles to join the fun in the overcrowded farm house.  There are many classic moments in the video, from the meeting of Animal and Cookie Monster to Bert and Ernie making alphabet small talk with Doc, a rocking ""Jingle Bell Rock"" by the Electric Mayhem, and a tear jerking moment with the Swedish Chef who decides to make a vegetarian dinner (after a duet of sorts with Big Bird).  As has been pointed out in other reviews, there were some edits due to licensing problems that have purists hopping mad.

Some of the best scenes and songs are edited out.  For those who have seen the unedited version as it was broadcast on television, you probably won't like this.  If you haven't seen the edited version, you may like this.  However, there are scenes that may have you thinking - ""What happened?"" ""That was short.""  ""Did they cut something out?""I sent an e-mail to Jim Henson productions.  The official explanation has to do with licensing and copyright issues on the songs that were edited out.  For example, Henson was cleared to use the Muppet Babies singing 'Santa Claus is coming to Town' on television.  However, they were not licensed to release it on DVD / VHS.Here is the more frustrating point.  Many movies have had similar issues.  Weird Science, Heavy Metal, etc. were all held up being released on video because of songs, licenses, artist royalties, etc.  However, all of them were eventually worked out and released.  I think that Henson productions could do something similar.  One can always hope.Added: December 18, 2006 Here's what Henson Productions had to say about the edited versionsThanks for your email regarding A Muppet Christmas Carol & Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas. It is true that the video releases of of these productions are shorter than the broadcast specials.  The original agreement that was made for the music was for the original TV broadcasts only. Subsequently, when we tried to arrange for the home video we were not allowed to release it unless certain sections were removed. This situation, which currently remains unchanged, is regrettable both to us and to our many friends who have been disappointed with their purchases. FYI, The Walt Disney Company acquired The Muppets and the Muppet properties from The Jim Henson Company some time ago. Since this is now a Disney property perhaps you might write to them with your complaint perhaps they can rectify the situation since we no longer can.The Walt Disney Company500 S.

A Muppet Family Christmas is something I watch every December.  It's funny, sweet, and so entertaining.  But, unfortunetly, the version on this DVD is not the version I just praised.  There are massive edits that are very noticable to viewers who have watched it since it first aired on TV and may leave first time viewers confused.  Fozzie's duet with the Snowman is cut out, the Muppet Babies home video is cut out (leaving Doc with a very strange line that doesn't make sense) and in my opinion the best part, where Miss Piggy enters, sings her song and slips on the Icy Patch, is edited out.  The best Icy patch gag and it's left out of the DVD/VHS.I am not going to buy this DVD.  Fortunately, my VHS tape still works well enough to watch it (yes with the OshGosh commercials and Double Mint Gum ones, too!).

Fortunately, that togetherness remains intact. Unfortunately, about ten minutes worth of footage has been edited out and therefore makes this DVD inferior and uncomplete.Besides the Muppet family all getting together, I fondly remember a comedy act Fozzy practices with a snowman and about a minute's worth of a Muppet Baby family video. Both of these have been edited out of this DVD. Also missing is a scene when Miss Piggy slips on some ice.Nevertheless, the film is still enjoyable to watch. After all it is the Muppets and even when they are cheated from their just screen time, they make 40 minutes worth of viewing much more enjoyable than most of what can be found on television today.I would give this DVD 5 stars, but because of the missing scenes, it's only getting 3.",3,Destroying a Classic.,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,1072,"['remember', 'watching', 'special', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'back', '1987', 'What', 'remember', 'most', 'was', 'brought', 'together', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Muppets', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'Kermit', 'Company', 'there', 'whole', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'gang', 'Fraggles', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'Fortunately', 'togetherness', 'intact', 'Unfortunately', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'footage', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'therefore', 'DVD', 'inferior', 'Muppet', 'family', 'all', 'getting', 'together', 'fondly', 'remember', 'comedy', 'act', 'Fozzy', 'practices', 'snowman', 'minute', 'worth', 'Muppet', 'Baby', 'family', 'video', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'DVD', 'Also', 'missing', 'scene', 'when', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'ice.Nevertheless', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Muppets', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'cheated', 'just', 'screen', 'time', 'make', '40', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'television', 'today.I', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'missing', 'scenes', 'only', 'getting', '3']",A Muppet Family Christmas VHS

The DVD apparently (besides being 200 bucks!) is also edited! What in the sweet baby Jesus is that about?I know this is a rarity, I just don't know why. Having had this video since I was a lad, and keeping it to bust out every Christmas, has earned me a lot of fans in the little tikes circuit. Every kid ever has really loved this one!  The one hour(ish) special is hillarious, and features not only the Muppets, but also the entire cast of Sesame Street, and Fraggle Rock (if you weren't a kid in the eighties, you may not know those guys, but they are there!) Antics are served up all around. Like when the swedish chef tries to cook big bird for dinner, after the turkey gives him the slip and starts hitting on Gonzos girlfriend Carmella.There is a scene where Kermit and his nephew attempt to sing a touching, heart warming rendition of Jingle Bells, but (always to my delight as a kid) get cut off by The Electric Mayhem who crank up the volume for a wild version of jingle Bell Rock.Anyway, too bad this thing is virtually unaquirable (seriously, I think you could find the video somewhere... try the used section at Blockbuster!) The DVD deletes some key scenes... like the snowman (""let me in! It's FREEZING out there!"") or the continuosly running icy patch gag. (???) they're in the video, not the DVD. And I can't imagine who would spend such an outlandish amount of money on a one hour DVD... I wouldn't do it, and I'm pretty crazy.FIVE STAR SPECIAL but the DVD is a loss.
