1004285,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000GH3PNG,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[2, 2]","This is a delightful series.  I had read many of the Macbeth books by M. C. Beaton some time ago, but I don't recall enjoying them nearly as much as I do the TV series.  Although the TV series shares some of the Macbeth self-immolation characteristic of the books, over all it seems to find some underlying goofiness, joy, and growth in the lives of its characters. Like Midsomer Murders,Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection, which shares some of this boisterous background to murder, it entangles the viewer before they realize what they've gotten themselves into.  More than anything, I enjoy the stick-togetherness of the village people, and the almost magic combination of their silly insanity with stark tragedy is almost Shakespearean.  In the midst of tragedy appears a bit of comedy, and occasionally even a fool can be wiser than the wisest.  It's like a roller coaster with emotions up and down and all around in the small space of one two hour episode, and in the end the viewer comes out feeling somehow revitalized.For those who've seen Series One, Series Two is a welcome return to a familiar venue.  As in good soap operas, the series characters have caught us up in the ongoing events of their lives, and we almost feel like they're personal friends.  This collection develops them all still further, while losing one who was close to us. My favorite of this series is No Man Is an Island, since it reveals that self revelation can be painful but that life goes on; and it does so because of others in our lives.  It also involves us in an almost Keystone Cops slapstick as the entire village becomes involved in an effort to keep Macbeth from being promoted and his temporary replacement from becoming permanent.

They have clever plots, interesting characters, stunning locations, and plenty of humorous touches.

Almost nothing is left of the books at all.  If you enjoy programmes like 'Ballykissangel' and 'Monarch of the Glen' you will probably like this.

1004294,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000GH3PNG,Stephanie De Pue,"[44, 47]","""Hamish MacBeth,"" a British Broadcasting television series based on characters created by the Scottish woman author M.C. Beaton, and set in Scotland, had its American tv premier in 1999.  It's set in a small village, Lochdubh, in the Scottish highlands, big sky country of mountain and loch, populated by eccentric, country-music loving characters, men who drink hearty, wear kilts-- surprisingly often, considering the climate, and gorgeous hand-knit sweaters.  It's nominally a mystery series, though some of the mysteries are mild, indeed, and it's just full of surprises.  You'd have to call it a village cosy mystery, I think, not the slightest tartan noir flavor to this one: minimal blood and violence, although lots of welcome slightly bent humor.Biggest surprise to me, the starring actor, Robert Carlyle, raised in Maryhill, Glasgow, Scotland, rather a young man when this series was made; his trademark intensity greatly subdued.  He plays the title character, Hamish MacBeth, the local law, who finds himself bending the law as often as he enforces it.  It's not a town to run by the book.  Carlyle, who first caught the wider public's eye as ""Gaz"" inThe Full Monty; generally plays things deadpan in ""Hamish Macbeth"", leaving the breathtaking scenery unchewed: he's ably supported by an excellent cast, a cute Westie terrier, and the flavorful great outdoors.Plots vary from the complex to the simple, and are frequently shot through with that sly subversive Scottish humor: they also occasionally feature the supernatural. One episode is about an older woman, walking on the beach by the loch, who accidentally steps on a live World War II land mine, and cannot step off it until it's disarmed.  MacBeth, who's come down to the loch to drown himself, must instead rescue her.Several episodes in this series are credited to Danny Boyle, who has gone on to greater things on the bigger screen.  One, in particular, deals with the (fictional) rough Scottish equivalent of the Irish Blarney Stone, supposedly used for centuries in the coronations of Scottish kings.  It's been taken some centuries ago by the English, and is currently on display in Westminster Abbey, London.  A number of the local lads, wearing their kilts, of course, so they'll blend right in, liberate it from London and hide it by a local waterfall.  Pleasurable chaos ensues. Chief among the pleasures of this episode is the supposed long-lost brother of one of the more important supporting cast characters.  This long-lost brother has had the most remarkable  bad luck in his attempts to live a life of crime, and has lived most of his adult life in jail: most recently an Argentinian one, a life not likely to be pleasurable to a Scot.  He has also had remarkably bad luck in regard to accidents and injuries, and is as close as he can come to a bionic man without entering the realm of science fiction.  Yet he steadfastly, furiously, refuses to admit he's had bad luck.  So his nonexistent bad luck finally, in this particular episode, bites not only him, but also his brother, Mac Beth's right-hand man.Now I love mysteries, generally the bloodier the better.  But the Scottish, positively non-twee charm of the Hamish Mac Beth series wins me over. So try it, you might like it.",4,"Try It, You Might Like It",1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,3267,"['Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'characters', 'created', 'Scottish', 'woman', 'author', 'M.C', 'Beaton', 'set', 'Scotland', 'had', 'American', 'tv', 'premier', '1999', 'set', 'small', 'village', 'Lochdubh', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'big', 'sky', 'country', 'mountain', 'loch', 'populated', 'eccentric', 'country-music', 'loving', 'characters', 'men', 'who', 'drink', 'hearty', 'wear', 'kilts', 'surprisingly', 'often', 'considering', 'climate', 'gorgeous', 'hand-knit', 'sweaters', 'nominally', 'mystery', 'series', 'mysteries', 'are', 'mild', 'indeed', 'just', 'full', 'surprises', ""'d"", 'have', 'call', 'village', 'cosy', 'mystery', 'think', 'not', 'slightest', 'tartan', 'noir', 'flavor', 'one', 'minimal', 'blood', 'violence', 'lots', 'welcome', 'slightly', 'bent', 'humor.Biggest', 'surprise', 'starring', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'raised', 'Maryhill', 'Glasgow', 'Scotland', 'rather', 'young', 'man', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'trademark', 'intensity', 'greatly', 'subdued', 'title', 'character', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'local', 'law', 'who', 'bending', 'law', 'as', 'often', 'not', 'town', 'run', 'book', 'Carlyle', 'who', 'first', 'caught', 'wider', 'public', 'eye', 'Gaz', 'inThe', 'Full', 'Monty', 'generally', 'things', 'deadpan', 'Hamish', 'Macbeth', 'leaving', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'unchewed', 'ably', 'supported', 'excellent', 'cast', 'cute', 'Westie', 'terrier', 'flavorful', 'great', 'outdoors.Plots', 'vary', 'complex', 'simple', 'are', 'frequently', 'shot', 'sly', 'subversive', 'Scottish', 'humor', 'also', 'occasionally', 'feature', 'supernatural', 'One', 'episode', 'older', 'woman', 'walking', 'beach', 'loch', 'who', 'accidentally', 'steps', 'live', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'land', 'mine', 'can', 'not', 'step', 'disarmed', 'MacBeth', 'who', 'come', 'down', 'loch', 'drown', 'must', 'instead', 'rescue', 'her.Several', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'credited', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'who', 'gone', 'greater', 'things', 'bigger', 'screen', 'One', 'particular', 'deals', 'fictional', 'Scottish', 'equivalent', 'Irish', 'Blarney', 'Stone', 'supposedly', 'used', 'centuries', 'coronations', 'Scottish', 'kings', 'been', 'taken', 'centuries', 'ago', 'English', 'currently', 'display', 'Westminster', 'Abbey', 'London', 'number', 'local', 'lads', 'wearing', 'kilts', 'course', ""'ll"", 'blend', 'right', 'liberate', 'London', 'hide', 'local', 'waterfall', 'Pleasurable', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Chief', 'pleasures', 'episode', 'supposed', 'long-lost', 'brother', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'long-lost', 'brother', 'had', 'most', 'remarkable', 'bad', 'luck', 'attempts', 'live', 'life', 'crime', 'lived', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'jail', 'most', 'recently', 'Argentinian', 'one', 'life', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'pleasurable', 'Scot', 'also', 'had', 'remarkably', 'bad', 'luck', 'regard', 'accidents', 'injuries', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'come', 'bionic', 'man', 'entering', 'realm', 'science', 'fiction', 'steadfastly', 'furiously', 'admit', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'nonexistent', 'bad', 'luck', 'finally', 'particular', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'brother', 'Mac', 'Beth', 'right-hand', 'man.Now', 'love', 'mysteries', 'generally', 'bloodier', 'better', 'Scottish', 'positively', 'non-twee', 'charm', 'Hamish', 'Mac', 'Beth', 'series', 'So', 'try', 'might', 'like']",Hamish Macbeth - Series Two
