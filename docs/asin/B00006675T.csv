Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[5, 15]","Incredibly bad. 90% of the (very brief) animal scenes weren't even filmed on the same film stock as the rest of the movie! Every time they cut to an animal, suddenly the picture gets all grainy. Can you say, ""Stock Footage""? After seeing this turkey you will.Absolutely typical Disney gotta-have-a-villain story, only watered down beyond belief. This thing doesn't play like a made-for-Disney-Channel quickie, it plays like a BAD made-for-Disney-Channel quickie. If you love your children, don't buy this thing.If you want to see how the same basic story can be done better without the need for a Disney villian, have a look at the movie ""Duma"".

The scenery of Africa is nice to look at but let me tell you, the acting is absolutely horrible!!!  That is not to be mean, it truly is bad.  I found myself thinking many times that the movie had to get better as it went along, but not to be.  The bad acting got in the way of the story to the point that it was comical.
