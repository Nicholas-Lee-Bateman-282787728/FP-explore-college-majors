Granted, Return of The Boogeyman isn't even worth the bother, so that side of the disc wouldn't matter much anyway, but still.The original, The Boogeyman was fairly good with apt performances by Suzanna Love & brother Nicholas. I give one star for the crappy double-sided dvd & four for the movie itself. I also wish they had used the original cover/poster art, but this is SONY. They don't seem to care much about quality & originality. They obviously like pinching pennies by putting two movies on a singular DVD.

Visually this print is very good, and the movie starts promisingly with a plot concerning bondage and murder. Well photographed scenes which made me think I was getting something like Nightmare In A Damaged Brain. But I was to be disappointed. After the girl with nightmares visits the house where she witnessed a murder years before, the story veers into the supernatural with lengthy scenes about haunted mirrors. It is up to the viewer to decide whether the supernatural angle works or not, and if the answer is affirmative they may like this film, but as I have said I was disappointed.

918763,AQ01Q3070LT29,B000A1OG1I,James McDonald,"[0, 2]","This is the very first and original film of THE BOOGEYMAN (1980).You may have heard of the ""Boogeyman"" in the John Carpenter film, HALLOWEEN (1978).A young boy, Willie (Jay Wright) and a young girl, Lacey (Natasha Schiano) have been caught watching through the outside window while their mother (Gillian Gordon) entertains a man (Howard Grant). She was taking her pantyhose off and putting them on the man.  When the kids were caught,they are ordered to bed where the man proceeds to tie up Willie and gag him.  Lacey was able to get a knife from the kitchen and untie the ropes from Willie.  When Willie took the knife, he goes into his mother's bedroom and kills the man.20 years later, Willie (Nicolas Love) and Lacey (Suzanna Love) go to church and they live with Uncle Ernest (Bill Rayburn) and Aunt  Helen (Felicite Morgan).  The memories of that horrible murder still haunt both of them.  However, it is Willie who stays quiet and is still fascinated by knives.When Lacie has a nightmare about her own brother killing her, Lacie's husband, Jake (Ron James)thinks it is a good idea to re-visit the old house where the murder accured.  Once there, she looks into a mirror and finds out about the spirit of the dead man, the Boogeyman, is still around.This is about as low-budget as a small film can get and I thought BEWARE THE BLOB (aka SON OFTHE BLOB (1972)) was bad.Nicolas Love and Suzanna Love are really brother and sister.  Miss Love also has writing credit for the story.John Carradine has a role.Followed by the sequels and remakes:Stephen King's The Boogeyman (1982)Boogeyman II (1983)Return of the Boogeyman (1994-direct to video)_________________________________Boogeyman (2005)Boogeyman 2 (2007-direct to video)Boogeyman 3 (2009-direct to video, January 20, 2009)",1,The mirror crack'd.,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1781,"['very', 'first', 'original', 'film', 'THE', 'BOOGEYMAN', '1980', '.You', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'Boogeyman', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'HALLOWEEN', '1978', '.A', 'young', 'boy', 'Willie', 'Jay', 'Wright', 'young', 'girl', 'Lacey', 'Natasha', 'Schiano', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'watching', 'outside', 'window', 'mother', 'Gillian', 'Gordon', 'man', 'Howard', 'Grant', 'was', 'taking', 'pantyhose', 'putting', 'man', 'When', 'kids', 'were', 'caught', 'are', 'ordered', 'bed', 'where', 'man', 'tie', 'up', 'Willie', 'gag', 'Lacey', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'knife', 'kitchen', 'untie', 'ropes', 'Willie', 'When', 'Willie', 'took', 'knife', 'mother', 'bedroom', 'man.20', 'years', 'later', 'Willie', 'Nicolas', 'Love', 'Lacey', 'Suzanna', 'Love', 'go', 'church', 'live', 'Uncle', 'Ernest', 'Bill', 'Rayburn', 'Aunt', 'Helen', 'Felicite', 'Morgan', 'memories', 'horrible', 'murder', 'still', 'haunt', 'However', 'Willie', 'who', 'quiet', 'still', 'fascinated', 'knives.When', 'Lacie', 'nightmare', 'own', 'brother', 'killing', 'Lacie', 'husband', 'Jake', 'Ron', 'James', 'good', 'idea', 're-visit', 'old', 'house', 'where', 'murder', 'accured', 'Once', 'there', 'mirror', 'out', 'spirit', 'dead', 'man', 'Boogeyman', 'still', 'around.This', 'as', 'low-budget', 'small', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'thought', 'BEWARE', 'THE', 'BLOB', 'aka', 'SON', 'OFTHE', 'BLOB', '1972', 'was', 'bad.Nicolas', 'Love', 'Suzanna', 'Love', 'are', 'really', 'brother', 'sister', 'Miss', 'Love', 'also', 'writing', 'credit', 'story.John', 'Carradine', 'role.Followed', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Boogeyman', '1982', 'Boogeyman', 'II', '1983', 'Return', 'Boogeyman', '1994-direct', 'video', '_________________________________Boogeyman', '2005', 'Boogeyman', '2', '2007-direct', 'video', 'Boogeyman', '3', '2009-direct', 'video', 'January', '20', '2009']",N/A

Watch it if you must, especially if you did see part 2, but you will not like it. Part 2 was just ok at best because of too much flashbacks from the original, but I still really enjoyed the creative kills and the movie after once it got moving. I did have the original VHS of part 2 and I dubbed it to a DVD+RW disc, so it works for me.

918769,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000A1OG1I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Boogeyman (Ulli Lommel, 1980)Ulli Lommel may have been a disciple of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's, but his directorial efforts (save a few at the outset of his career, arguably) have never come close to the brilliance of Fassbinder's best work. While Lommel did attempt for a few years to make Fassbinder-style films, he was always drawn to the world of exploitation (consider Tenderness of the Wolves, his third film, based on the same case as was Lang's immortal M; there's a compare-and-contrast for you), and starting with The Boogeyman, he allowed his baser impulses free rein. If he had done so in any sort of original way, this might have been the cult hit it threatened to become back when it was released.Lacey (Lommel's wife Suzanna Love) and Willy (Love's real-life brother Nicholas), as children, had the mother of all traumatic experiences. One of their mother's string of boyfriends was an abusive psychopath who liked to tie Willy to the bed to keep him out of the way, beating him once in a while for good measure. One night, Lacey cut his ropes, and Willy grabbed the knife from her, stormed their mother's bedroom, and stabbed the boyfriend dozens of times, killing him. Fast-forward twenty years, and Lacey, now married and living on her aunt and uncle's farm with her brother (who hasn't spoken since the incident), gets a letter from her mother, now retired and living in Georgia, asking to see the two of them again before she dies. That night, Lacey has a horrible nightmare that the boyfriend has come back to kill her. On the advice of a psychologist (John Carradine), husband Jake (standup comedian Ron James in his first film role) takes Lacey back to the childhood house to try and expel the demons. (Mom, by the way, never surfaces again.) In her mother's old bedroom, Lacey finds a mirror that was there back in the day, and she sees the boyfriend's reflection in it. Terrified, she shatters the mirror, releasing his restless spirit to spread death and destruction wherever shards of the mirror happen to be.It's an interesting concept, and done right, it could have been a fine flick. It is in no way done right, being satisfied with being a silly slasher flick that gives new meaning to the term ""derivative""; you'll recognize a lot of this from previous films, many of which were hot off the presses at the time. (While Lommel's obvious antecedent for this film was Halloween, pretty much every slasher film made during the seventies gets at least a quick nod, from Black Christmas to Friday the 13th.) Even the music is ripped straight out of John Carpenter. Lommel is not nearly talented enough a director to turn melange into homage, and even were he so, I don't think that was his intention at all; this has the feel of a movie put together for the sole purpose of making a quick buck. And it probably did, but of the films from the golden age of slashers I've been rewatching these last few years, I can't remember one that's aged quite as badly as this. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor--ignore its existence and go rent Tenderness of the Wolves again instead. *",1,The beginning of Lommel's descent into low-budget exploitation horror.,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,3116,"['Boogeyman', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', '1980', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'disciple', 'Rainer', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'save', 'few', 'outset', 'career', 'arguably', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'brilliance', 'Fassbinder', 'best', 'work', 'Lommel', 'did', 'attempt', 'few', 'years', 'make', 'Fassbinder-style', 'films', 'was', 'always', 'drawn', 'world', 'exploitation', 'consider', 'Tenderness', 'Wolves', 'third', 'film', 'based', 'same', 'case', 'was', 'Lang', 'immortal', 'M', 'compare-and-contrast', 'starting', 'Boogeyman', 'allowed', 'baser', 'impulses', 'free', 'rein', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'sort', 'original', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cult', 'hit', 'threatened', 'become', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released.Lacey', 'Lommel', 'wife', 'Suzanna', 'Love', 'Willy', 'Love', 'real-life', 'brother', 'Nicholas', 'children', 'had', 'mother', 'traumatic', 'experiences', 'One', 'mother', 'string', 'boyfriends', 'was', 'abusive', 'psychopath', 'who', 'liked', 'tie', 'Willy', 'bed', 'keep', 'way', 'beating', 'once', 'while', 'good', 'measure', 'One', 'night', 'Lacey', 'cut', 'ropes', 'Willy', 'grabbed', 'knife', 'stormed', 'mother', 'bedroom', 'stabbed', 'boyfriend', 'dozens', 'times', 'killing', 'Fast-forward', 'twenty', 'years', 'Lacey', 'now', 'married', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'farm', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'incident', 'letter', 'mother', 'now', 'retired', 'living', 'Georgia', 'asking', 'see', 'two', 'again', 'night', 'Lacey', 'horrible', 'nightmare', 'boyfriend', 'come', 'back', 'kill', 'advice', 'psychologist', 'John', 'Carradine', 'husband', 'Jake', 'standup', 'comedian', 'Ron', 'James', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Lacey', 'back', 'childhood', 'house', 'try', 'expel', 'demons', 'Mom', 'way', 'never', 'again', 'mother', 'old', 'bedroom', 'Lacey', 'mirror', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'boyfriend', 'reflection', 'Terrified', 'mirror', 'releasing', 'restless', 'spirit', 'spread', 'death', 'destruction', 'wherever', 'shards', 'mirror', 'happen', 'be.It', 'interesting', 'concept', 'done', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'flick', 'way', 'done', 'right', 'being', 'satisfied', 'being', 'silly', 'slasher', 'flick', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'derivative', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'lot', 'previous', 'films', 'many', 'were', 'hot', 'presses', 'time', 'Lommel', 'obvious', 'antecedent', 'film', 'was', 'Halloween', 'pretty', 'much', 'slasher', 'film', 'made', 'seventies', 'least', 'quick', 'nod', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Friday', '13th', 'Even', 'music', 'ripped', 'straight', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Lommel', 'not', 'nearly', 'talented', 'director', 'turn', 'melange', 'homage', 'even', 'were', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intention', 'feel', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'sole', 'purpose', 'making', 'quick', 'buck', 'probably', 'did', 'films', 'golden', 'age', 'slashers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rewatching', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'aged', 'quite', 'as', 'badly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'favor', 'ignore', 'existence', 'go', 'rent', 'Tenderness', 'Wolves', 'again', 'instead', '*']",N/A
