7322,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,0767803337,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","It's clear that this film is a departure from so many foreign film with children.  The film draws on the innocence of Ludovic, a  7-year old boy, living in France, who believes he was meant to be a girl.  After confusion whether he is a boy or a girl, he learns that girls have XX chromosome;  he fantasizes that God made a mistake sending chromosomes into the chimney at his birth.  He believes one X chromosome landed into the trash.Ludovic thinks nothing of correcting the problem, not knowing what life holds for those family members affected by transgenderism.  He doesn't hide his feelings for another young boy, his friend Jerome.  It is Ludovic's family, and family's colleagues who are very uncomfortable with the problem when it becomes more serious enhanced by tension, fear, blame and guilt.This is director Alain Berliner' debut film, and he touches the subject carefully, not to confuse homosexuality with transgenderism.  Ludovic clearly believes he was meant to be a girl and doesn't confuse that with anything else; he is simply a child believing there is a mistake and he will have it corrected.  Meanwhile, he escapes into the fantasy world of feminism and pink.  The film, considered  a comedy, doesn't quite live up to the comedic thread.  It is tender, poignant, and sad.  The child played by Georges DeFresne  is said to have been an eleven year old playing a seven year old;  he performs remarkably as his expressive eyes reveal innocence, confusion, happiness and sadness.The 1997 film received the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.  There is nothing here that would be offensive to young children.  It is something for all.  ....Rizzo",5,A tender and innocent story on transgender in youth.,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",2008,1662,"['clear', 'film', 'departure', 'so', 'many', 'foreign', 'film', 'children', 'film', 'draws', 'innocence', 'Ludovic', '7-year', 'old', 'boy', 'living', 'France', 'who', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'girl', 'confusion', 'boy', 'girl', 'girls', 'have', 'XX', 'chromosome', 'God', 'made', 'mistake', 'sending', 'chromosomes', 'chimney', 'birth', 'one', 'X', 'chromosome', 'landed', 'trash.Ludovic', 'nothing', 'correcting', 'problem', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'life', 'family', 'members', 'affected', 'transgenderism', ""n't"", 'hide', 'feelings', 'young', 'boy', 'friend', 'Jerome', 'Ludovic', 'family', 'family', 'colleagues', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'problem', 'when', 'more', 'serious', 'enhanced', 'tension', 'fear', 'blame', 'guilt.This', 'director', 'Alain', 'Berliner', 'debut', 'film', 'subject', 'carefully', 'not', 'confuse', 'homosexuality', 'transgenderism', 'Ludovic', 'clearly', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'girl', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'anything', 'else', 'simply', 'child', 'believing', 'mistake', 'will', 'have', 'corrected', 'Meanwhile', 'fantasy', 'world', 'feminism', 'pink', 'film', 'considered', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'comedic', 'thread', 'tender', 'poignant', 'sad', 'child', 'played', 'Georges', 'DeFresne', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'playing', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'remarkably', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'innocence', 'confusion', 'happiness', 'sadness.The', '1997', 'film', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'nothing', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'young', 'children', 'something', '.Rizzo']",N/A

7325,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,0767803337,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 3]","""Ma vie en rose"" is a colorful, emotionally powerful film about a little boy named Ludovic who thinks he's a girl. Ludovic's favorite show is about Pam (a Gallic Barbie equivalent). She lives in a world of pinkness&he; longs to join her. Ludovic's femininity-and his desire to be a girl-has devastating consequences for his family. At first, his mother tries to sympathize, but in the end she blames the family crises on him. His father remains withdrawn. For some, the ""dominant mother/weak father"" is proof that Ludovic is doomed to homosexuality,or at least it's his parents' fault (more specifically,his mother's) The family crises come to a head when Ludovic has a pretend wedding to a neighbor boy,Ben. The parents have a difficult time explaining to Ludovic why he can't marry a boy,since he considers himself a girl.Ludovic's dreamworld is luminous, filled with pink,a joyous,colorful contrast to his dreary suburban home. In the end,he finds a friend in a very butch girl who looks like a boy. There is hope at the end.""Ma vie en rose"" addresses the ""gender identity therapy"" some children get if they're deemed too masculine (if a girl) or too feminine (if a boy). Some like Dr. Joseph Nicolosi have suggested that if fathers hug their sons a lot,their sons won't grow up seeking the amorous embraces of other men. When a mother worried that her son liked feminine things&cross-dressing;,even Dr. Phil was thrown for a loop. He suggested alternating specifically masculine&feminine; toys,and therapy if it didn't work. Dr. Phil is hardly a spokesman for Exodus International or PFOX (Parents&Families; of Ex-Gays),but he was still baffled.""Ma vie en rose"" leaves the question-is Ludovic gay or transgender?

7328,A231ZCJGWZA38A,0767803337,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[91, 91]","More than a bold statement about how people generally treat those who are  different, this film is primarily a wonderfully sweet story.  This film  works so well because of its many levels: Ludovic's charm and the daydreams  he uses to escape (you can't help but love him and feel for him), his  parents' concern and anger (sometimes irrational but often justified), and  the neighborhood's consternation at what appears to be something completely  out of whack with their suburban &quot;normalcy&quot; and blandness.  The  interesting part of this film was that, despite the general belief that  children can often be most cruel to each other, it was the adults who  misbehaved and caused all the problems.  Definitely a first-rate story with  a great blend of comedy, drama, and tears.As far as the technical  aspects of the movie are concerned, they're also first-rate.  The  widescreen format is exactly what this movie needs (I simply couldn't  imagine it in fullscreen format).  The colors are bold and bright, and the  sound is well-balanced.  The subtitles are available in English (with some  incomplete translation at times, and a few unnecessary vulgarities), French  (with a word-for-word translation), and Spanish.Like others here, I  cannot comprehend the &quot;R&quot; rating.  There's no sex and there's no  violence.  I've seen &quot;G&quot;-rated Disney movies with more  questionable material than this!  The f-word is present, but only because  of the translators' choice of syntax: it wasn't necessary and certainly  wasn't in the French script.  In fact, with a proper translation, this  movie could have been released with a &quot;PG&quot; rating.  As such, I  personally believe this movie should be seen by high school students as  part of a curriculum on tolerance.  Heck, the English subtitles even use  the word &quot;bent&quot; instead of the more common slang word for  homosexual...so if they could be polite with that word, they certainly  didn't need to use the other vulgarities.  (For those who don't speak  French, here's a clarification about a certain aspect of the dialog which,  admittedly, is difficult to translate.  The French word &quot;tapette&quot;  has two meanings: it's a slang word meaning homosexual, and it also means  fly-swatter.  What meaning it takes is obviously dependent on the overall  context of the conversation.  I hope this clarifies the scene in which  Ludo's dad takes out the fly-swatter to explain what &quot;bent&quot;  means).On a final note, there IS an available soundtrack to his film.  You can get it on Amazon's French site at www.amazon.fr for around twenty  dollars --at the time of this writing, anyway.  Even if you don't know  French, the site is set up exactly like the American website, so it's easy  to navigate (and the icons are the same...a shopping cart in France looks  like a shopping cart in America).",5,NOTHING WORTHY OF AN &quot;R&quot; HERE...THE RATING BOARD'S NUTS!,968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,2891,"['More', 'bold', 'statement', 'how', 'people', 'generally', 'treat', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'film', 'primarily', 'wonderfully', 'sweet', 'story', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'many', 'levels', 'Ludovic', 'charm', 'daydreams', 'escape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'feel', 'parents', 'concern', 'anger', 'sometimes', 'irrational', 'often', 'justified', 'neighborhood', 'consternation', 'what', 'be', 'something', 'completely', 'whack', 'suburban', 'quot', 'quot', 'blandness', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'general', 'belief', 'children', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'most', 'cruel', 'other', 'was', 'adults', 'who', 'misbehaved', 'caused', 'problems', 'Definitely', 'first-rate', 'story', 'great', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'tears.As', 'far', 'technical', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'concerned', ""'re"", 'also', 'first-rate', 'widescreen', 'format', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'colors', 'are', 'bold', 'bright', 'sound', 'well-balanced', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'incomplete', 'translation', 'times', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'vulgarities', 'French', 'word-for-word', 'translation', 'Spanish.Like', 'others', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'sex', 'violence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'G', 'quot', '-rated', 'Disney', 'movies', 'more', 'questionable', 'material', 'f-word', 'present', 'only', 'translators', 'choice', 'syntax', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'French', 'script', 'fact', 'proper', 'translation', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'quot', 'PG', 'quot', 'rating', 'such', 'personally', 'believe', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'part', 'curriculum', 'tolerance', 'Heck', 'English', 'subtitles', 'even', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'bent', 'quot', 'instead', 'more', 'common', 'slang', 'word', 'homosexual', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'polite', 'word', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'use', 'other', 'vulgarities', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'French', 'here', 'clarification', 'certain', 'aspect', 'dialog', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'translate', 'French', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'two', 'meanings', 'slang', 'word', 'meaning', 'homosexual', 'also', 'fly-swatter', 'What', 'meaning', 'obviously', 'dependent', 'overall', 'context', 'conversation', 'hope', 'scene', 'Ludo', 'dad', 'out', 'fly-swatter', 'explain', 'what', 'quot', 'bent', 'quot', 'final', 'note', 'available', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'Amazon', 'French', 'site', 'www.amazon.fr', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'time', 'writing', 'anyway', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'French', 'site', 'set', 'up', 'exactly', 'American', 'website', 'easy', 'navigate', 'icons', 'are', 'same', 'shopping', 'cart', 'France', 'shopping', 'cart', 'America']",N/A

Would a  movie about a girl who wants to be a boy (a tomboy, in other words) get a  similar R rating? I don't think so.The story follows Ludovic, who seems  to be the only person who's sure of who he is in the conformist French  suburb where his family resides. Ludo takes heat from his family, his  schoolmates, and from the neighborhood as they wrestle with is eccentric  lifestyle. The discomfort others feel around Ludo is more revealing of  their hang-ups than his, and the viewer gets the feeling that the  psychological &quot;treatment&quot; for Ludo is doing him more harm than  good. The movie is beautifully shot and arranged, with vivid dream  sequences and intriguing costuming and set design.The only weak points  of it are the abrupt personality shift of the mother about midway through  the movie, which is jarring and not consistent with her character as  previously established. Also, the father does a turnaround himself a little  later, and we're led to believe that unemployment is an ultimately  emasculating feminizing force on men, as this is what spearheads the  father's change of attitude. The ending is not as strong as it could have  been -- it left me wondering what would happen to Ludo as he grows  up.All in all, it's a great, enjoyable movie, one that, despite the  &quot;R&quot; rating, the whole family could enjoy, provided the parents  aren't too hung up about gender-identification for their kids.

He rebels against all the attempts to make him stop acting out his fantasies and wearing what he feels is proper and comfortable attire for him which make his neighbors and acquaintances perceive him as sick ,disturbed and in need of help when in reality they are the ones that need the help so they can stop being judgmental and ignorant.While the other people around Ludovic are like circles and can roll freely he is a square that does not roll smoothly and will endure all the bumps and have a rocky ride ahead of him due to the fact he is shaped differently.This movie is a must for anyone who might think their child is exhibiting signs of transgenderism during their early years and for people who cant think out of the box so they can put themselves in Ludovic's tiny yet heavy shoes or for anyone who wants to see a beautiful story.",5,A Cinematic Triumph,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1630,"['Ma', 'Vie', 'En', 'Rose', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Ludovic', 'who', 'desperately', 'be', 'girl.While', 'most', 'boys', 'age', 'want', 'be', 'cowboys', 'Soldiers', 'Ludovic', 'dreams', 'living', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'dolls', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'princess', 'not', 'free', 'do', 'things', 'feel', 'natural', 'do', 'Things', 'other', 'people', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'socially', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'name', 'Pam', 'who', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'journeys', 'far', 'away', 'reality', 'confused', 'troubled', 'life.It', 'heart', 'breaking', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'ostracize', 'condemn', 'things', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand.In', 'Ludovic', 's', 'heart', 'girl', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'ridicule', 'torment', 'cant', 'see', 'must', 'think', 'attempts', 'make', 'stop', 'acting', 'fantasies', 'wearing', 'what', 'proper', 'comfortable', 'attire', 'make', 'neighbors', 'acquaintances', 'perceive', 'sick', 'disturbed', 'need', 'help', 'when', 'reality', 'are', 'ones', 'need', 'help', 'can', 'stop', 'being', 'judgmental', 'ignorant.While', 'other', 'people', 'Ludovic', 'are', 'circles', 'can', 'roll', 'freely', 'square', 'not', 'roll', 'smoothly', 'will', 'endure', 'bumps', 'have', 'rocky', 'ride', 'ahead', 'due', 'fact', 'shaped', 'differently.This', 'movie', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'think', 'child', 'exhibiting', 'signs', 'transgenderism', 'early', 'years', 'people', 'who', 'cant', 'think', 'box', 'can', 'put', 'Ludovic', 'tiny', 'yet', 'heavy', 'shoes', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'beautiful', 'story']",N/A
7331,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0767803337,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[37, 37]","The most obvious way to read MA VIE EN ROSE is as the tale of difficulties faces by a very young boy who is very likely transgendered--but given the multilayered nature of the film this is actually a rather narrow point of view.  It would be more accurate to describe the film as a rather sly assault on a cookie-cutter society that reacts with a herd mentality toward anything in the least unusual.  And Ludovic Fabre is a most unusual child: barely into school, he has become convinced that he is really a girl, and in his childhood innocence he sees absolutely nothing socially amiss with the idea.The film begins with a party at which neighbors gather to welcome the newly arrived Fabre family--only to be, along with the family, extremely disconcerted when Ludovic makes an entrance in meticulously applied make-up and a pink dress.  His family passes the incident off as a joke, but Ludovic proves remarkably single-minded, and when he draws a neighborhood child into his fantasies he also incurs neighborhood hysteria.  The result is at once comic and unpleasantly vicious as his classmates, his neighbors, and eventually his family gradually turn upon him.Although there are one or two problems with character development in the script, the cast--particularly Georges du Fresne as Ludovic and Helene Vincent as free-spirit grandmother Elizabeth--is superlative, and director Alain Berliner balances the serio-comic story with a very light touch.  Viewers will laugh a little, cry a little, and ultimately come away from the film feeling an uncertain hope.  The fact that this film is rated &quot;R&quot; is merely so much more evidence of the power of the herd to dictate standards of normalicy--one or two profanities aside, there is absolutely nothing in the film to offend any intelligent viewer, and the film will hold a special appeal for older children who have been targeted as in any way different by their peers... and for the many adults who remember what it was like to be a victim of a society that prizes conformity over imagination, creativity, honesty, integrity, and self-awareness.

7332,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0767803337,Gregor von Kallahann,"[7, 7]","The previous reviewer noted that this movie is not the out and out comedy or tragedy that it might have been in the hands on an American filmmaker.  I would concur with that, with a bit of a caveat.  The HBO short &quot;Trevor&quot; about a gay (admittedly not &quot;transgendered&quot;) teen coming to terms with his identity achieved a similar tone.  Still the point that this film has a lightness of tone uncharacteristic of American commercial film is certainly well taken.One difference in the European perspective is that it is less tainted with Puritanism.  True, young Ludovic's friend (and object of affection) is discouraged from playing with him because he'll go to hell.  From what we know of the friend's parents, however, this has less to do with their actual beliefs than with their overall discomfort and alarm and the perceived need to come up with some reason--any reason--to keep him from playing with Ludo.If you simply enumerate some of the crises that Ludo and his family undergo, it would indeed seem like heavy dramatic fare. The parents' difficulty in dealing with the situation (and the fact that they seem to alternate in being supportive and loving)is at times painful to watch. Hate grafitti is sprayed on their garage door, and Dad ultimately loses his job.  There is even an apparent suicide attempt (although it seems unlikely that seven year old Ludo truly understands death) that provides the film's most disturbing scene.  Still the film is more heart-tugging than heart-rending.Some reviewers suggest Ludovic's total innocence and loving nature probably provide the leavening touch.  I suspect that's a good part of it.  There is something indominatable in his spirit that keeps the film from shifting to melodrama.  And of course the many fantasy sequences with the fictional TV character &quot;Pam&quot; contribute to the film's playful tone.  It's a sweet movie.

7334,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,0767803337,kaduzy,"[2, 2]","This is a really amazing film about a seven-year-old boy named Ludovic (Georges Du Fresne) living in France who is convinced that he is supposed to be a girl.  He keeps telling his family that he will turn into a girl soon, and then he'll be able to marry the boy next door.  He also keeps dressing up in girl's clothing and showing up in this attire at neighborhood functions.His family is at first amused but their reactions quickly change as they realize that Ludo is very, very serious about this.  Their situation is complicated by the fact that the family has just moved into a new suburban neighborhood where they just happen to live down the street from the father's new boss (who got the house for them).  And ""the boy next door"" is the boss' son.  One by one, the family members (except for Ludo's young-at-heart grandmother) turn against him, and the family dynamic begins to fray at the edges.  Last to capitulate is Ludo's mother Hanna (Mich&egrave;le Laroque in a FANTASTIC performance), who tries her best to keep loving Ludo throughout the ordeals he creates for them all simply by wanting to be who he thinks he is supposed to be.The movie is very thought-provoking and it has an ethereal quality to it created in part by the lush colors (lots of bright shades of pink and green are found throughout) and the frequent forays into Ludo's fertile imagination.  His inspiration comes from his Pam and Ben dolls (French version of Barbie & Ken, though I'm not sure whether they are real French toys or were just made up for the movie.) and he often pretends to be visiting Pam in her dream-like TV world, because that's the only place he feels 100% safe and accepted.Overall this movie is well worth watching.  It will definitely produce some moments of discomfort now and then because of its frankness and because Ludo's timing is so bad at times.  The writing and acting don't shy away from portraying the struggle his family has to undergo in order to accept him.  They never stop loving him -- it's just a question of acceptance.  The film plays likeEdward Scissorhands (Widescreen Anniversary Edition)meetsHedwig and the Angry Inch (New Line Platinum Series)(minus the songs) and it deals in an honest and often bracing way with the social stigma attached to gender identity.  The DVD transfer is lush and spectacular, and makes this film an excellent buy in spite of the dearth of extras.Oh and one note to keep in mind before you watch this: The subtitles have been cleaned up for some reason.

I kept wishing he'd just drift off into that world more often! Those are some lovely montages.My only issue was with the neighbors. I just don't buy that not one family on the street or in the school would stick up for this kid and his parents. Not one? No way. I get that this is part of the drama, but the rest of the film tries so hard to be honest that this felt a little contrived. The French are much more tolerant and aware of male-female gender issues, and gayness in general, for there to be zero support for this family on that street, no matter how bourgeois. La Cage Aux Folles and the many other pro-TG works to come out of France show that it's one of the more intelligent and aware countries on this planet (sorry all you France haters; believe what you see in the country first-hand, not what you read in our very biased media).I think that tolerance comes partly from artists sharing their inclusive visions by making movies like this, and I get that it's a fairy tale designed to teach. Still, I would have liked to see a little love for these folks from a neighbor or two, as would happen in real life. But then again this is a fantasy film, and a very fine one at that, so maybe I'm way off with that one niggle.I'm curious: to parents out there---would you want to watch this with your seven year-old boy? I think that's what the R rating was designed to avoid, though I think this is a PG-13. Check out the fine movie about the MPAA, This Film Is Not Yet Rated, and see what kind of uptight bozos run that world.

We see Ludovic, an amazingly beautiful little boy who loves the cartoon character, Pam, apparantly a French version of Barbie.  She is gorgeous, has long white-blond hair and sprinkles fairy dust to manifest the man of her dreams, whom she marries.Ludo, somehow identifies with this dazzling character and starts dressing up as a girl, with makeup and jewelry and talks of marrying his little schoolboy friend.  The parents who are middle class, apparently ""normal""  people, who have just moved into a picture perfect (for them) suburban neighborhood, and who just want a happy life, are at their wits' ends with how to deal with Ludo.The mother has a mother, an aging wannabe hippie type who encourages Ludo in his escape into his fantasy world.  Her personal fantasy is to remain forever young, slim and rich.The story is delicately told, with perfect acting.  The director is careful not to ascribe too much blame to anyone, I felt.  We can see and empathize with the reactions of everyone.  The parents and the granny sincerely try to help the child, each in his own way, even while their lives are uprooted by the situation.As viewers, we are drawn into the drama by the sensitive script and excellent acting, especially that of the captivating child.  We want everything to turn out well for him.  The ending suggests that perhaps there is some kind of resolution, but I didn't find it very convincing, (hence the lack of more stars).

(If I wanted to read, after all, I would have bought a book). But ""Ma Vie En Rose"" was the rare exception.One is first struck by how different it is from films with a similar theme (such as ""Priscilla"" and ""To Wong Foo...."")The aforementioned films portray transsexuals and transvestites as occupying the fringe of society, and the lunatic fringe at that. Ludo is a sweet, carefree, innocent child whose conviction that he is a girl is every bit as innocent. Ludo could be your neighbor's child--or yours.Paradoxically, the film shows how far we've come (can you imagine a film like this being made ten years earlier?) and how far we have yet to go. Ludo gets the expected hassling from schoolmates, but their reaction is nothing compared to that of the adults in the neighborhood--a clear indication of where the children get their prejudices in the first place. One gets the impression Ludo's parents (the mother, anyway--the father seems too weak and ineffectual to have an opinion) really want his happiness and will accept him whatever he turns out to be--whether gay or transsexual. When the mother, her patience exhausted, finally cuts Ludo's long hair, it is done not out of contempt for Ludo but the weariness that the furor around him has caused.The film's highlights have to be the extended fantasy sequences taking place in Ludo's mind, a world of Barbie-like dolls, in a cosmos where X chromosomes tossed by a careless Creator end up in the trash. It does tend to fall back on stereotypes (the strong mother/weak father myth) but is a greater plea for understanding than a hundred books on the subject.",5,The only film I know of not to show TG people as freaks,989107200,"05 6, 2001",2001,1755,"['give', 'idea', 'what', 'effect', 'film', 'had', 'was', 'willing', 'break', 'long-standing', 'rule', 'never', 'sitting', 'subtitled', 'film', 'wanted', 'read', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'book', 'Ma', 'Vie', 'En', 'Rose', 'was', 'rare', 'exception.One', 'first', 'struck', 'how', 'different', 'films', 'similar', 'theme', 'such', 'Priscilla', 'Wong', 'Foo', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'portray', 'transsexuals', 'transvestites', 'occupying', 'fringe', 'society', 'lunatic', 'fringe', 'Ludo', 'sweet', 'carefree', 'innocent', 'child', 'conviction', 'girl', 'bit', 'innocent', 'Ludo', 'could', 'be', 'neighbor', 'child', 'yours.Paradoxically', 'film', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'can', 'imagine', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'yet', 'go', 'Ludo', 'expected', 'hassling', 'schoolmates', 'reaction', 'nothing', 'compared', 'adults', 'neighborhood', 'clear', 'indication', 'where', 'children', 'get', 'prejudices', 'first', 'place', 'One', 'impression', 'Ludo', 'parents', 'mother', 'anyway', 'father', 'too', 'weak', 'ineffectual', 'have', 'opinion', 'really', 'want', 'happiness', 'will', 'accept', 'out', 'be', 'gay', 'transsexual', 'When', 'mother', 'patience', 'exhausted', 'finally', 'Ludo', 'long', 'hair', 'done', 'not', 'contempt', 'Ludo', 'weariness', 'furor', 'caused.The', 'film', 'highlights', 'have', 'be', 'extended', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'taking', 'place', 'Ludo', 'mind', 'world', 'Barbie-like', 'dolls', 'cosmos', 'where', 'X', 'chromosomes', 'tossed', 'careless', 'Creator', 'end', 'up', 'trash', 'tend', 'fall', 'back', 'stereotypes', 'strong', 'mother/weak', 'father', 'myth', 'greater', 'plea', 'understanding', 'hundred', 'books', 'subject']",N/A
