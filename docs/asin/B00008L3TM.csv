744516,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,B00008L3TM,anna-joelle,"[31, 34]","I have watched literally hundreds of period dramas over the years and own many on VHS and DVD. Believe me when I write that ""Feast of July"" ranks as one of the best and should be owned on DVD. This movie has it all - absolutely BRILLIANT acting, beautiful cinematography and a storyline that is at once heartbreaking, romantic and dramatic. I could not tear my eyes away from the screen and I am sure I must have unconsciously held my breath for long seconds during the many poignant and suspenseful scenes.Set in late Victorian England, the story is about a young, penniless girl named Bella Ford (beautifully played by Embeth Davidtz) who arrives at the small industrial town of A- to look for her lover, Arch Wilson (Greg Wise) who has seduced her and left her destitute. She is found wandering in the night by a rural farmer, Mr Wainwright who takes pity on her and brings her home to stay with his family. She recovers her health and gradually adjusts to life with the Wainwrights. But she did not count on the 3 sons of the family (Jedd, Con and Matty) falling in love with her. Jedd (James Purefoy) is a soldier, smooth-tongued and quite the ladies man. Con (Ben Chaplin) is quiet, strong-willed and a loner. The youngest, Matty (Kenneth Anderson) is an industrious man who makes beautiful leather shoes. The matriach of the family (played by Gemma Jones) only very reluctantly accepts Bella into her family because she foresees that Bella can cause trouble among her 3 sons. Each son has his own way of courting Bella and only one will eventually win her heart. And just when the future appears to look rosy for Bella, she crosses path with her past lover, Arch Wilson (a most despicable scoundrel), resulting in violence and tragedy for all concerned.I cannot remember the last time I cried so much at a movie. It is not just the eventual tragic scene. The romantic scenes (guess which son?) are wonderful and so full of beauty and passion that I felt so happy, I cried! Tears sprang to my eyes during the marriage proposal scene - in that suspenseful moment when I thought Bella might just say ""no"" and cause a major heartbreak, I must have stopped breathing! After an incredibly long silence, when Bella finally speaks, my tears just flowed from sheer happiness and relief.I was sorry the movie did not end happily but I knew the ending will be tragic so I was 'prepared'. Though sad, I felt that the ending was appropriate as it reminds me of the saying that ""It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."" And Bella has loved and been truly loved in return.This movie was made in 1996 and executive-produced by the incomparable Merchant-Ivory team. I feel that Embeth Davidtz deserves an Oscar nomination for her flawless, heartbreaking performance here. She is so beautiful and talented, but yet is so under-rated. And I must gush about Ben Chaplin who is absolutely brilliant in this film (and really good-looking too!). You can tell both actors have put their whole heart and soul into playing their characters.This movie affected me deeply and I had to write this review in the hope of getting some of the ""emotions"" out of my system. But I will never forget this wonderful film and the beautiful performances. The DVD does not have any special features but it has subtitles for those who require it. The picture and sound qualities are excellent. This sumptuous film is a must-watch and I highly recommend it!",5,One of the Best Period Dramas Ever Filmed!,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,3450,"['have', 'watched', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'period', 'dramas', 'years', 'own', 'many', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'Believe', 'when', 'write', 'Feast', 'July', 'one', 'best', 'should', 'be', 'owned', 'DVD', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'BRILLIANT', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'storyline', 'once', 'heartbreaking', 'romantic', 'dramatic', 'could', 'not', 'tear', 'eyes', 'away', 'screen', 'am', 'sure', 'must', 'have', 'unconsciously', 'held', 'breath', 'long', 'seconds', 'many', 'poignant', 'suspenseful', 'scenes.Set', 'late', 'Victorian', 'England', 'story', 'young', 'penniless', 'girl', 'named', 'Bella', 'Ford', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'who', 'small', 'industrial', 'town', 'A-', 'look', 'lover', 'Arch', 'Wilson', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'who', 'seduced', 'left', 'destitute', 'found', 'wandering', 'night', 'rural', 'farmer', 'Mr', 'Wainwright', 'who', 'pity', 'home', 'stay', 'family', 'health', 'gradually', 'adjusts', 'life', 'Wainwrights', 'did', 'not', 'count', '3', 'sons', 'family', 'Jedd', 'Con', 'Matty', 'falling', 'love', 'Jedd', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'soldier', 'smooth-tongued', 'ladies', 'man', 'Con', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'quiet', 'strong-willed', 'loner', 'youngest', 'Matty', 'Kenneth', 'Anderson', 'industrious', 'man', 'who', 'beautiful', 'leather', 'shoes', 'matriach', 'family', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'only', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'Bella', 'family', 'Bella', 'can', 'cause', 'trouble', '3', 'sons', 'son', 'own', 'way', 'courting', 'Bella', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'eventually', 'win', 'heart', 'just', 'when', 'future', 'look', 'rosy', 'Bella', 'path', 'past', 'lover', 'Arch', 'Wilson', 'most', 'despicable', 'scoundrel', 'resulting', 'violence', 'tragedy', 'concerned.I', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'cried', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'eventual', 'tragic', 'scene', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'guess', 'son', 'are', 'wonderful', 'so', 'full', 'beauty', 'passion', 'felt', 'so', 'happy', 'cried', 'Tears', 'sprang', 'eyes', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'scene', 'suspenseful', 'moment', 'when', 'thought', 'Bella', 'might', 'just', 'say', 'cause', 'major', 'heartbreak', 'must', 'have', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'incredibly', 'long', 'silence', 'when', 'Bella', 'finally', 'tears', 'just', 'flowed', 'sheer', 'happiness', 'relief.I', 'was', 'sorry', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'happily', 'knew', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'tragic', 'was', ""'prepared"", 'sad', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'appropriate', 'saying', 'better', 'have', 'loved', 'lost', 'never', 'have', 'loved', 'Bella', 'loved', 'been', 'truly', 'loved', 'return.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1996', 'executive-produced', 'incomparable', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'team', 'feel', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'flawless', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'here', 'so', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'yet', 'so', 'under-rated', 'must', 'gush', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'who', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'film', 'really', 'good-looking', 'too', 'can', 'tell', 'actors', 'have', 'put', 'whole', 'heart', 'soul', 'playing', 'characters.This', 'movie', 'affected', 'deeply', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'hope', 'getting', 'emotions', 'system', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'wonderful', 'film', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'who', 'require', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'are', 'excellent', 'sumptuous', 'film', 'must-watch', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It spent about a week in the theaters and few have heard of it, but it is as good as Room with a View or Howard's End.  Darker but deeper than both.  Not as popular perhaps because the ending is tragic, but the story and acting are top-notch. Embeth Davitz is fabulous (and fabulous to look at).  I will never understand why these wonderful period actresses come and go with barely a whisper, while sub-mediocre actresses like Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts prosper.

It is a world of pastoral beauty, which can erupt into tragic violence without warning. The plot concerns the effect of a young woman recovering from a miscarriage while searching for the lover who abandoned her on the three sons of a family who take her in and nurse her back to health. Rivalries between the sons are complicated when the lover reenters the picture, and violence ensues. Imagine Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" transported to rural England.

The realism is good. The acting is good. The story is believable. The scenery and settings definitely set the right tone, but it's kind of slow. It's definitely depressing. It's not the type of story I'd normally associate with romance. It's more of a tragedy. I don't need a happy ending, but I guess I never got too invested in any of the characters to care too much what happened. There are some fine moments in acting though- especially with Gemma Jones. I LOVE James Purefoy. He didn't look anything like he has in any other piece, so that was refreshing as well.
