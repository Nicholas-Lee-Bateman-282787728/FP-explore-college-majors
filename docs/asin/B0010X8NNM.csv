E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Well this movie was no classic by any means, but watching a movie that was designed for the Lifetime Movie Network was a fairly nice way to pass the time last night.First of all, yes, like many people, I wanted to watch this movie because the all mighty Morgan Freeman plays in it.  The guy can simply turn something bad into something good JUST by his presence alone, and honestly, the 3 stars I'm giving this movie are mainly because of Morgan Freeman.It's about two separate couples that go through relationship troubles, and Morgan always happens to be there to offer advice when needed.  I had no problem with this.  What WAS a big problem was the poor acting from all the other characters, especially the drunk father who wasn't believable in any way shape or form when he turned obnoxious and supposedly threatening to his sons girlfriend.  Ha!I also didn't like the guy who found out his wife liked other women, and his quest to find another girlfriend resulted in even more poor acting, and his character was someone you just didn't want to feel sorry for because of the way he handled himself- he felt like a clueless idiot.Another problem was the very very poor ending.  Not only did the movie end quite suddenly and unexpectedly, but there was hardly anything interesting about the way the story was summed up.  VERY disappointing.Despite that, I liked the story, and if you take out all the graphic nude scenes that shockingly dominate much of the film, it's not that bad of a movie.

1127797,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0010X8NNM,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[17, 26]","I enjoyed Robert Benton's generational romance, ""Feast of Love"", but I couldn't help wondering, while watching it, on what planet this story takes place...every woman who appears is gorgeous, and ready to hop into bed, houses to buy are affordable, even for kids (and very easy to find), college professors earn enough to take sabbaticals that never end, and can sit in coffee shops forever...and, with the exception of a nearly caricatured abusive father (Fred Ward, in a thankless role), everybody is just so darn nice that the bad things that happen always leads to something wonderful. In the postcard-perfect Portland of the story, addiction only happens off-camera, lesbian women seducing wives away from husbands are okay, affairs with married men are acceptable, making a home-made pornographic film isn't any big deal, even self-mutilation is a potential way to make a love connection! Benton makes this all work, but I WAS scratching my head...While Greg Kinnear's coffee shop owner is so bland and out-of-touch that it was hard to warm up to him (his big comic scene, bribing his nephew to get a dog back that he no longer needed, and the boy had bonded with, seemed not only unfunny, but out-of-character), Morgan Freeman is rock-solid as a professor dealing with the loss of a son by passively observing the lives around him. He is complimented by Jane Alexander's wise portrayal of his wife, and their scenes together are the most richly dramatic of the film.The best roles of the film are the women's; Alexa Davalos, as a free spirit who bonds with a doomed ex-addict (Toby Hemingway), overcomes the ""so beautiful that she can't be real"" initial reaction to her, to become the 'heart' of the story, demonstrating a courage and depth that is refreshing to see in a young actress. Equally impressive is Radha Mitchell, as a Realtor who marries Kinnear just to snub her married boyfriend (Billy Burke). In a role that included dramatic confrontations while nude, she never seemed artificial, and offered a remarkable depth to what could have been a cold-hearted portrayal.Both Davalos and Mitchell have several nude scenes, so if you have young children, you may want to wait on airing this until they are in bed.As I said, ""Feast of Love"" is enjoyable, if not really believable...I think it works best as a great 'date' movie, to snuggle up to, with someone you love!",3,"Slick, Superficial, But a Great Cast!",1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2380,"['enjoyed', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'generational', 'romance', 'Feast', 'Love', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'watching', 'what', 'planet', 'story', 'place', 'woman', 'who', 'gorgeous', 'ready', 'hop', 'bed', 'houses', 'buy', 'are', 'affordable', 'even', 'kids', 'very', 'easy', 'find', 'college', 'professors', 'earn', 'enough', 'take', 'sabbaticals', 'never', 'end', 'can', 'sit', 'coffee', 'shops', 'forever', 'exception', 'nearly', 'caricatured', 'abusive', 'father', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'thankless', 'role', 'everybody', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'nice', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'always', 'something', 'wonderful', 'postcard-perfect', 'Portland', 'story', 'addiction', 'only', 'off-camera', 'lesbian', 'women', 'seducing', 'wives', 'away', 'husbands', 'are', 'okay', 'affairs', 'married', 'men', 'are', 'acceptable', 'making', 'home-made', 'pornographic', 'film', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'even', 'self-mutilation', 'potential', 'way', 'make', 'love', 'connection', 'Benton', 'work', 'WAS', 'scratching', 'head', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'coffee', 'shop', 'owner', 'so', 'bland', 'out-of-touch', 'was', 'hard', 'warm', 'up', 'big', 'comic', 'scene', 'bribing', 'nephew', 'get', 'dog', 'back', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'boy', 'had', 'bonded', 'seemed', 'not', 'only', 'unfunny', 'out-of-character', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'rock-solid', 'professor', 'dealing', 'loss', 'son', 'passively', 'observing', 'lives', 'complimented', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'wise', 'portrayal', 'wife', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'most', 'richly', 'dramatic', 'film.The', 'best', 'roles', 'film', 'are', 'women', 'Alexa', 'Davalos', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'bonds', 'doomed', 'ex-addict', 'Toby', 'Hemingway', 'so', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'real', 'initial', 'reaction', 'become', ""'heart"", 'story', 'demonstrating', 'courage', 'depth', 'refreshing', 'see', 'young', 'actress', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Realtor', 'who', 'Kinnear', 'just', 'snub', 'married', 'boyfriend', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'role', 'included', 'dramatic', 'confrontations', 'nude', 'never', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'offered', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cold-hearted', 'portrayal.Both', 'Davalos', 'Mitchell', 'have', 'several', 'nude', 'scenes', 'so', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'airing', 'are', 'bed.As', 'said', 'Feast', 'Love', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'think', 'best', 'great', ""'date"", 'movie', 'snuggle', 'up', 'someone', 'love']",N/A

1127802,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B0010X8NNM,Daddy,"[1, 1]","This is a wonderful movie. The premise is simple; intertwining stories about love... mostly seen through the eyes of a college professor, Harry Stevenson (played very smoothly by Morgan Freeman) who is a friend of Bradley Smith (played charmingly by Greg Kinnear) who owns a coffee shop (like a Starbucks).  In segue scenes, it is Harry who narrates the story and tells his wife, Esther (played well by the lovely Jane Alexander - who unfortunately has only brief screen time) the things he sees in his friends - who's falling in love with whom, etc.  Bradley is married to Kathryn (Selma Blair) who seems aloof to her husband's devoted affection. And Bradley, who has a kind soft heart but a weak perception, is clueless to his wife's distance, even when she is blatantly seduced by a woman sitting with them at their booth in a bar... it is after a ball game, and the woman, Jenny (Stana Katic), who has been eyeing and flirting with Kathryn during the game, joins Bradley and Kathryn at their table, and proceeds to vehemently seduce Kathryn... even while Bradley is snuggling her close and talking to Harry (who is also sitting with them).  This seems to say more about the infidelity of these two women, rather than about their romance.  In any case, their stories go on... Bradley eventually opens his eyes and moves on to find romance with another woman.  But, again, he is clueless... the other woman is also involved with another man.  But, the movie is not centered around Bradley... there are other love stories going on.  Aside from the lesbian tryst between Kathryn and Jenny, there is also Oscar (Toby Hemingway), a young man who works at the coffee shop. He is immediately smitten with Chloe (Alexa Davalos), a young woman who applies for a job at the coffee shop.  Oscar is a recovering drug addict with a weak heart (literally - it is the cause of his eventual death).  Oscar and Chloe have a whirlwind love affair, despite interventions by Oscar's father (Fred Ward), a complete a**hole who is drunk most of the time and mean all of the time.  And let's not forget the ongoing love story of Harry and his wife Esther; though only shown in segue bits, their love story is the most endearing.  The whole of the movie is charming.  With the exception of the sadness of Oscar dying and the madness of his father being such an a**hole, the story (or rather, stories) are tranquil and sublimely fun to watch.  Freeman is, as always, superb in his part. Kinnear is, as always, charming and loveable.

It is like an overview of ""everyday lives"" of people within the circle.Kinnear's character is a poster boy for the mantra that nice guys finish last.  His persona's luck with women is almost as bad as mine.  He's a great person who always means well, but his downfall is that he's also incredibly naive.  He is intelligent, but he is prone to either over-interpreting minor events or being oblivious to major events which transpire in his life.  Freeman's character is a sort of mentor for him, but at times he appears to be a lost soul.There are some profound philosophical themes in the film which are downright Schopenhauresque.  In addition, there is also an allusion (deliberate or not) to a scene from Jean Paul Satre in which a character puts a nail through his hand just so he can feel something, or to see if he can feel @ all.Many viewers are likely to contend that the film is filled with gratuitous nudity.  I would disagree.  While I've never been opposed to nudity in films (and never will be!), there are some movies I've seen where the nudity was contrived.  Not so in this film.Rather, to me, the nude scenes are realistic.  Alexa Davalos and Radha Mitchell are very beautiful, to be sure, but they surely weren't cast for this film as eye-candy. [Mitchell reminds me a lot of Denise Crosby, BTW]  The scenes in which they strip down do(!) flow with the trajectory of the story.  In my mind, this movie is, quite simply, brutally honest.  Yes, it IS possible for 2 people to get caught in compromising positions.  Yes, it is also possible for 2 people to get into a big argument after making love.  In such a circumstance, it would be contrived for the couple to put their clothes on so they could continue arguing.  It's just like in so many flicks I've seen where two people make love & in the next scene it shows them still in bed, but miraculously w/their underwear on.  Everyone knows such scenes are nonsense.  This movie, for one, doesn't pander to such unrealistic scenes.I would invite the people who gave this 3 stars or less to give it another view. I truly believe that this is one movie where there is more than meets the eyes.  It is about love, to be sure, but it goes beyond Romantic love to also include the love involved with parenting issues as well.  The characters are complex and, with the exception of one lone character, they can't be placed into categories of ""good"" and ""evil.""  The film also accurately details how a couple that has broken up can(!) in fact remain friends - provided that the conditions are just right.  Normally, Radha Mitchell's character would be your typical femme fatale, but this DVD gets beyond that typical pigeonhole.I realize I've mumbled quite a lot, but this is a very difficult film to critique.  Not because it's bad, but because there are so many different angles to it.  I do believe that anyone looking for an honest, sincere account of love & relationships will be stirred by the present film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I will run add this one to my all-time-favorites Amazon list.",5,Come all to the feast!,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,3730,"['short', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'well', 'done', 'terrific', 'cast', 'movie', 'w/Morgan', 'Freeman', 'automatically', 'rating', 'boosted', 'star', 'so', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'stare', 'camera', '5', 'minutes', 'say', '5', 'word', 'sentence', ""'ll"", 'swear', 'was', 'most', 'profound', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'life.The', 'film', 'social', 'circle', 'very', 'diverse', 'people', 'One', 'college', 'professor', 'sabbatical', 'Freeman', 'one', 'cafe', 'owner', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'employees', 'cafe', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'Alexa', 'Davalos', 'plot', 'not', 'focused', 'good', 'thing', 'overview', 'everyday', 'people', 'circle.Kinnear', 'character', 'poster', 'boy', 'mantra', 'nice', 'guys', 'finish', 'last', 'persona', 'luck', 'women', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'mine', 'great', 'person', 'who', 'always', 'well', 'downfall', 'also', 'incredibly', 'naive', 'intelligent', 'prone', 'over-interpreting', 'minor', 'events', 'being', 'oblivious', 'major', 'events', 'transpire', 'life', 'Freeman', 'character', 'sort', 'mentor', 'times', 'be', 'lost', 'soul.There', 'are', 'profound', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'downright', 'Schopenhauresque', 'addition', 'also', 'allusion', 'deliberate', 'not', 'scene', 'Jean', 'Paul', 'Satre', 'character', 'nail', 'hand', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'something', 'see', 'can', 'feel', '@', 'all.Many', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'contend', 'film', 'filled', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'would', 'disagree', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'opposed', 'nudity', 'films', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'are', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'nudity', 'was', 'contrived', 'Not', 'so', 'film.Rather', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'Alexa', 'Davalos', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'very', 'beautiful', 'be', 'sure', 'surely', 'were', ""n't"", 'cast', 'film', 'eye-candy', '[', 'Mitchell', 'lot', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'BTW', 'scenes', 'strip', 'down', 'do', 'flow', 'trajectory', 'story', 'mind', 'movie', 'quite', 'simply', 'brutally', 'honest', 'Yes', 'possible', '2', 'people', 'get', 'caught', 'compromising', 'positions', 'Yes', 'also', 'possible', '2', 'people', 'get', 'big', 'argument', 'making', 'love', 'such', 'circumstance', 'would', 'be', 'contrived', 'couple', 'put', 'clothes', 'could', 'continue', 'arguing', 'just', 'like', 'so', 'many', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'make', 'love', 'next', 'scene', 'still', 'bed', 'miraculously', 'w/their', 'underwear', 'Everyone', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'nonsense', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'pander', 'such', 'unrealistic', 'scenes.I', 'would', 'invite', 'people', 'who', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'less', 'give', 'view', 'truly', 'believe', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'more', 'eyes', 'love', 'be', 'sure', 'Romantic', 'love', 'also', 'include', 'love', 'involved', 'parenting', 'issues', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'exception', 'one', 'lone', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'placed', 'categories', 'good', 'evil', 'film', 'also', 'accurately', 'details', 'how', 'couple', 'broken', 'up', 'can', 'fact', 'remain', 'friends', 'provided', 'conditions', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'Normally', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'femme', 'fatale', 'DVD', 'typical', 'pigeonhole.I', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'mumbled', 'quite', 'lot', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'critique', 'Not', 'bad', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'do', 'believe', 'anyone', 'looking', 'honest', 'sincere', 'account', 'love', 'relationships', 'will', 'be', 'stirred', 'present', 'film', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'excuse', 'will', 'run', 'add', 'one', 'all-time-favorites', 'Amazon', 'list']",N/A

It makes the ""Twilight"" movies seem like frickin' Ingmar Bergman!Perhaps the novel this film is based upon is a whole different story, that wouldn't surprise me.  Or maybe not.  I can't imagine the director and producers changing it THAT much from the book.  Or did they really turn a silk purse into a sow's ear?  Wait, upon checking imdb.com I see that the original novelist co-wrote the screenplay.  OK, that means I can safely scratch his book off my list.I can't remember the last time I saw a film with such outrageously improbable characters and plotlines imaginable.  I understand that ""suspension of disbelief"" is a given in any work of fiction whether it be a film or a novel, but this is WAY beyond that.  And not in any deliberately absurdist or existentialist style, but in an apparently intentionally SERIOUS kind of way.  Cringe, cringe, cringe...I could not stop cringing throughout, whenever I wasn't chortling or howling or groaning in agony: from one unbelievably corny, cloying moment to the next.

1127811,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0010X8NNM,Grady Harp,"[48, 52]","It is always puzzling when films of the caliber of FEAST OF LOVE are short-lived in the theaters, usually scantily attended in the shadows of the big, mean, noisy blockbusters. And when film buffs begin to believe that the meaningful movies only come from foreign sources, out pops the DVD release of a jewel like this film, a story so well written (Allison Burnett), directed (Robert Benton), and acted by a gifted cast to show under scrutiny that it is the equal of the best of the 'sensitive films'.Based on a novel by Charles Baxter (and adapted by Allison Burnett, another extraordinary writer of his own novels CHRISTOPHER: A TALE OF SEDUCTION and THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL), the story takes place in Portland, Oregon and examines the lives and love stories of myriad characters, each of whom is connected in some way to the father confessor of the town, one elderly professor Harry Stevenson (Morgan Freeman) who not only narrates the threads of the people's lives that round out this film, but also plays a significant role as a father of an only son who died in the recent past from a heroin overdose, a man bruised and experienced in the vagaries of life, supported by his wife Esther (Jane Alexander), both of whom cope with their loss by extending their love to young people.Bradley Thomas (Greg Kinnear) is an artist and an optimist who own Jitters, a coffee shop, and is married to Kathryn (Selma Blair) who loves sports...and leaves him for a woman who awakens her lesbian longings. A young recovering drug abuser Oscar (Toby Hemingway) works in Bradley's shop and in a magic moment falls in love with a sensitive free spirit named Chloe (Alexa Davalos) and is hired by Bradley on a whim. Bradley doesn't understand the complications of love: he is an optimistic romantic, but with an indomitable spirit that allows him to progress through marriages like a hero! Searching for a place to live after his marriage fails, he meets real estate agent Diana (Rhadha Mitchell) who despite the fact that she is having an extended love affair with married David (Billy Burke), a relationship consisting solely of 'nooners' with wine and sex, sees the rare vulnerable goodness in Bradley and once again Bradley is in love, headed toward marriage. Meanwhile Oscar and Chloe share dreams for a perfect future despite a problem with Oscar's alcoholic abusive father Bat (Fred Ward) and some ominous warnings from palmist/card reader (Margo Martindale). At the heart of each of these affairs of the heart is the supportive Professor Harry, a wise man who observes reality and yet retains the courage to offer advice and love to all of the characters. In a short time Bradley's marriage to Diana fails as Diana returns to the now available David, and in a moment of angst Bradley wounds himself, is taken to a Dr. Vikashi (Erika Marozs&aacute;n) for treatment and ends up falling in love yet again - and this time the feeling is wholly mutual. And just when the playing field of love seems even, a major tragedy occurs which bonds all of the players surrounding the wise Harry and Esther and the resolution of all of the aspects of the feast of love come round.What makes this film so very successful is the gentle manner in which it is written and directed and acted. There is not a weak element here in this survey of the power and force of love. Some may find the generous scenes of lovemaking a problem, but these scenes are in integral part of the story and never border on the superfluous or gratuitous level. The cast is excellent: the pleasure of seeing actors of this wide age range work together in such a fine ensemble manner is doubtless due in large part to not only the individual actors of quality but also to the director. This is a beautiful film, happy and sad, tender and enriching, and hopefully will be seen by a large audience now that it is available on DVD. Highly recommended.

1127829,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0010X8NNM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 12]","Once again Morgan Freeman plays the wise, old sage in the cast. At this point, he has played a similar variation of this role so many times I think he should get a patent. Anytime someone wants this type of character in their film, they should only get Freeman to play the role, or pay him a royalty.That said, Professor Stevenson, the narrator and guide through ""Feast of Love"", Robert Benton's (""Nobody's Fool"") newest film is an interesting character. His narration while helpful is also problematic, serving to draw us out of the film and remind us of how episodic the story is, constantly reminding us of the book the film is based on.Stevenson seems to have a lot of time on his hands and roams the Portland, Oregon neighborhood where he and his wife (Jane Alexander) live. He spends time at the local coffee shop, Jitters, owned by Bradley (Greg Kinnear) and staffed by Oscar (Toby Hemmingway). Stevenson watches as Bradley and Oscar fall in love, break-up and then fall in love again. As their circle of people grows, Stevenson becomes a member of this larger group. He returns home each day to relate the day's events to his wife. Stevenson is on a leave from the local university and seems determined to delay his return, as he deals with the grief of his adult son's death.I wouldn't mind Stevenson's wise words and his sage advice nearly as much if he only discussed these moments with people. When Freeman starts to narrate the character's thoughts and feelings, he becomes too obtrusive into our interaction with the film. Also, these moments of narration are used to try to hide the episodic nature of the story. As soon as he relates an event in Bradley's live, we see an event in Oscar's life, and back and forth.Freeman is, as always, good. It's just too bad his performance is so familiar.Bradley, played by Greg Kinnear, is a bit too clueless to be likable. Initially, our interest is held as Stevenson wisely observes his relationship with his wife, Kathryn (Selma Blair). Just finished with a softball game, the Professor joins the younger couple at a local bar where Kathryn talks with Jenny (Stanza Katic), one of the players from the other female team. They form a friendship and Jenny recognizes Kathryn is interested in becoming more than just friends. Bradley is so clueless; he doesn't realize there is a problem until Kathryn is walking out of their house. Of course, Stevenson knows right away and tells his wife about what Bradley will soon discover.Bradley decides to move, for a change of pace. His realtor, Diana (Radha Mitchell) shows him a house right next to Stevenson and he decides to take it. He also falls in love with Diana, who is a bit hurt her boyfriend, David (Billy Burke) won't leave his wife, relegating their relationship to torrid meetings in hotel rooms during lunch.Oscar (Toby Hemingway), a young, blond, spiky haired guy with tattoos, seems to really enjoy his job at Jitters. One day, Chloe (Alexa Davalos) walks in looking for a job. He immediately agrees they need the help and Bradley gets the hint. Soon, Oscar and Chloe are in love and their story is, by far, the most romantic. But it also has a few plot contrivances more suited to an afternoon soap opera.It seems odd to me that Stevenson and his wife, Esther (Alexander) don't interact with the other characters in the film more frequently, making them seem a bit disconnected, further reinforcing the strange feel of the narration. About halfway through, Esther and the Professor have wine with Bradley and Diana and start to participate with the others, making the film seem a little more real.Benton is a very good director and he achieves a lot of visual moments that really speak volumes about the relationship between these characters. When Esther walks into her husband's home office, she notices he is working on his computer. ""This is a welcome sight,"" she says. She soon learns he is writing a letter to the dean of his school extending his leave indefinitely. This is upsetting to her, but rather than start screaming, she pauses a moment and leaves the office, slamming the door. Stevenson pauses, without looking at the door. This is a telling moment, accurately reflecting the depth and length of their relationship.Stevenson and Esther do a lot of observing when they are with the younger couples. Over their wine, the younger couple says things causing the older couple to pause. Later, they discuss the events amongst themselves. If they did this once or twice, it would be amusing and even interesting, but because it happens often, it seems as though this couple are supposed to be our guide into the lives of these characters. That's fine, too. But because they sit and watch so much, it makes them passive observers. Since we are sitting and watching a film, we are already a passive observer. What makes a film great is when you feel you are part of the story, the action, and the character's lives.Fred Ward plays Bat, Oscar's abusive father. He only has a couple of scenes and in each he is drunk and over the top, so he fits the bill. But because he has no development, his character seems odd and since he really has no overall place in the story, his appearances only briefly make Oscar apprehensive. He really adds nothing to the story.These complaints aside, the story about Oscar and Chloe really saves the film. From the moments Oscar spots Chloe, you can see the hunger in his eyes. As their relationship progresses, you believe they have each found their soul mate and are deeply in love. We learn things about their past and watch some of the decisions they make and this helps to make them more real. It doesn't hurt that Toby Hemingway and Alexa Davalos are both very good looking and create a lot of onscreen chemistry.""Feast of Love"" is clearly designed as a portrait of three different generations in love, and it works to a certain degree. But the strange choice of narrative device does nothing but serve to take us out of the film, make us a passive observer, and consistently remind us of the book the film was adapted from. Rather then embracing the characters and their lives, it seems as though the filmmakers want to keep us at arm's length from them.",3,"""Feast"" Needs Some More Courses",1198195200,"12 21,

1127831,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0010X8NNM,Traveler,"[2, 3]","I really liked ""Feast of Love.""  I liked that it was for adults (finally!) in its sexual depictions.  I liked that its heart is optimistic despite the sadness it sometimes portrays.  And I liked the actors, among other things.What bothers me about ""Feast"" is that it could have gone to a higher level.  There are multiple moments when it's just sticky sweet or just dumbed down.In on scene, for example, ""Oscar"" releases a bunch of balloons and tells ""Chloe"" that they represent them. It's just awkward.  In multiple scenes Morgan Freeman's character, ""Harry,"" refers to infatuations at first site as being love - this coming from a character who's been married for decades and should know better.  Attractions at first sight do exist, but elevating them to such purity is for a teeny bopper movie, not one for adults and real world romance. Harry also refers to these encounters as if he's all knowing and as if people are this paper thin obvious when they find someone attractive.  At one point at the beginning Harry talks about love being a creation of the Greek gods.  Because Harry seemed to have extrasensory perception when it came to knowing when people were attracted to each other I was beginning to wonder if ""Feast"" was going to have elements of magical realism.  It doesn't and that's fine - but it just shows how the director just went too far in making things B&W; obvious.Robert Benton, the director, won an Oscar for ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" a serious adult film.  While I dislike that movie, I wished he applied a bit of the maturity of that film here.  ""Feast"" could have been almost literary in quality if it hadn't stooped to these silly depictions.The only movie that comes to mind that's similar is ""Love Actually,"" another movie that people either hate or love.  If you don't particularly like blunt sexuality in your movies then you'll want to avoid.  If you accept the sex as just being normal and you like movies about adult relationships then give ""Feast of Love"" a try.  I recommend it - but I am annoyed that the director squandered the opportunity to make something even more powerful and meaningful.",4,Great idea marred by moments of excess. 3 1/2 stars,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,2128,"['really', 'liked', 'Feast', 'Love', 'liked', 'was', 'adults', 'finally', 'sexual', 'depictions', 'liked', 'heart', 'optimistic', 'sadness', 'portrays', 'liked', 'actors', 'other', 'bothers', 'Feast', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'higher', 'level', 'are', 'multiple', 'moments', 'when', 'just', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'just', 'dumbed', 'down.In', 'scene', 'example', 'Oscar', 'bunch', 'balloons', 'Chloe', 'represent', 'just', 'awkward', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Harry', 'refers', 'infatuations', 'first', 'site', 'being', 'love', 'coming', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'decades', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Attractions', 'first', 'sight', 'do', 'exist', 'elevating', 'such', 'purity', 'teeny', 'bopper', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'adults', 'real', 'world', 'romance', 'Harry', 'also', 'encounters', 'knowing', 'people', 'are', 'paper', 'obvious', 'when', 'find', 'someone', 'attractive', 'one', 'point', 'beginning', 'Harry', 'love', 'being', 'creation', 'Greek', 'gods', 'Harry', 'seemed', 'have', 'extrasensory', 'perception', 'when', 'came', 'knowing', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'attracted', 'other', 'was', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'Feast', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'elements', 'magical', 'realism', ""n't"", 'fine', 'just', 'how', 'director', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'making', 'things', 'B', 'W', 'obvious.Robert', 'Benton', 'director', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'serious', 'adult', 'film', 'dislike', 'movie', 'wished', 'applied', 'bit', 'maturity', 'film', 'here', 'Feast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'literary', 'quality', 'had', ""n't"", 'stooped', 'silly', 'only', 'movie', 'mind', 'similar', 'Love', 'Actually', 'movie', 'people', 'hate', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'blunt', 'sexuality', 'movies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'avoid', 'accept', 'sex', 'just', 'being', 'normal', 'movies', 'adult', 'relationships', 'then', 'give', 'Feast', 'Love', 'try', 'recommend', 'am', 'annoyed', 'director', 'squandered', 'opportunity', 'make', 'something', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'meaningful']",N/A
