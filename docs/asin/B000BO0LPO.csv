946476,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000BO0LPO,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[29, 31]","Based on Jeanette Oke's ""Love Comes Softly"" series, which has sold over 30 million copies, ""Love's Long Journey"" is the 3rd installment, and is a charming period piece about Missie and Willie LaHaye, going west to start a ranch, build a home, and have a family of their own. This is mellow filmmaking, with a peaceful ambiance, and an occasional dramatic sequence. A Christian theme flows through the plot line, and the film makes excellent family viewing. Those who are used to ""blow 'em up"" fare will find the film slow, others will find it refreshing.Missy is a gentle woman, and also a natural tomboy, who knows how to shoot a lot better than she can make an edible biscuit, but she learns how to cook from an older cowhand (Frank McRae, endearing as Cookie), and her toughness comes in handy when dealing with some unsavory characters.Directed by Michael Landon Jr., who also had a hand in the script, the cast is wonderful, with Erin Cottrell as Missy, and Logan Bartholomew as Willie, with John Savage as leader of a trio of bad guys, and Graham Phillips delightful as the young boy Jeff. Irene Bedard is exceptionally beautiful as the LaHaye's Native American neighbor, Miriam. Shot on location in some scenic locations like Big Sky Ranch in Ventura County, California, the cinematography by Brian Shanley is lovely, with endless panoramas and a feeling of how life was in a past era.""Love's Long Jouney"" is an above average television production, and I'm looking forward to the next film in the series, ""Love's Abiding Joy,"" which is presently in post-production. As Missy quotes from Ecclesiastes in the film, ""For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven,"" and the saga of this family is heartwarming as well as fine entertainment.",5,"""For Everything There is a Season""",1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,1772,"['Based', 'Jeanette', 'Oke', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'series', 'sold', '30', 'million', 'copies', 'Love', 'Long', 'Journey', '3rd', 'installment', 'charming', 'period', 'piece', 'Missie', 'Willie', 'LaHaye', 'going', 'west', 'start', 'ranch', 'build', 'home', 'have', 'family', 'own', 'mellow', 'filmmaking', 'peaceful', 'ambiance', 'occasional', 'dramatic', 'sequence', 'Christian', 'theme', 'plot', 'line', 'film', 'excellent', 'family', 'viewing', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'blow', 'up', 'fare', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'slow', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'refreshing.Missy', 'gentle', 'woman', 'also', 'natural', 'tomboy', 'who', 'how', 'shoot', 'lot', 'better', 'can', 'make', 'edible', 'biscuit', 'how', 'cook', 'older', 'cowhand', 'Frank', 'McRae', 'endearing', 'Cookie', 'toughness', 'handy', 'when', 'dealing', 'unsavory', 'characters.Directed', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'hand', 'script', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Erin', 'Cottrell', 'Missy', 'Logan', 'Bartholomew', 'Willie', 'John', 'Savage', 'leader', 'trio', 'bad', 'guys', 'Graham', 'Phillips', 'delightful', 'young', 'boy', 'Jeff', 'Irene', 'Bedard', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'LaHaye', 'Native', 'American', 'neighbor', 'Miriam', 'Shot', 'location', 'scenic', 'locations', 'Big', 'Sky', 'Ranch', 'Ventura', 'County', 'California', 'cinematography', 'Brian', 'Shanley', 'lovely', 'endless', 'panoramas', 'feeling', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'past', 'era', 'Love', 'Long', 'Jouney', 'above', 'average', 'television', 'production', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'film', 'series', 'Love', 'Abiding', 'Joy', 'presently', 'post-production', 'Missy', 'Ecclesiastes', 'film', 'everything', 'season', 'time', 'matter', 'heaven', 'saga', 'family', 'heartwarming', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'entertainment']",Love's Long Journey

946505,A3TSJ9KDY18X1L,B000BO0LPO,Kimberly,"[99, 102]","Out of the three Love Comes Softly movies made, this one is my most favorite. Very touching, but most inaccurate from the original book by Jannette Oke. Neitherless I enjoyed it!After 2 years of marriage, Missie and Willie have arrived at the land where they are to establish a home/ranch. While Willie goes off to find some ranchhands, Missie befriends her Native American neighbor Miriam who is a blessing from God b/c Missie is pregnant and w/out a doctor around. The story also focuses upon these 3 mysterious men who seem to be gangsters. Later on they discover that there is money hidden somehwere on Misse and Willie's ranch. They hold everyone hostage while searching out for the money. How will Missie and Willie handle this? Well just watch it and you'll find out!If you have read the book there are TONS of differences. The first half of the book focuses upon their journey on the trail while in the movie they have arrived at their destination within the first 10 minutes. Missie gave birth in a little city Willie left her at in the book and she names the baby Nathan not Matthew like she did in the movie. And Miriram does not exist in the book. The little boy who they adopted, and the 3 gangsters were not present in the book either I believe. To me they made most of the movie's plot up, while keeping some elements from the book--God's faithfulness, love, and I love the last line from the movie Missie says--""To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.""All in all I reccommend the movie to fans of the Little House on the Praire series and the Love Comes Softly book series by the amazing Janette Oke. Go read the book if you never had...it is truly beautiful. Love's Abiding Joy, the 4th book in the series is in the works right now of being produced into a movie.

It was about a newlywed couple, and Missie feeling like her encounter with a Native American is from God. The part near then end had me about to bawl, for a young man confesses his sins before God, but something sad happens right after he confesses. But his confession, and how the people this man has hurt make known he is receiving forgiveness is so very touching. This movie takes place in 1878 to 1879.

(I loved the first two as well, ""Love Comes Softly"" and ""Love's Enduring Promise"")  Based on a novel by best-selling Christian fiction write Janette Oke, ""Love's Long Journey,"" is a heart-warming continuation of the story of Missie & William LaHaye (newly married).  This movie is based on the third book in the series.  There is a switch of the actress playing Missie (January Jones is noticeably absent), but newcomer-to-the-series Erin Cottrell does a fine job as Missie (she had me convinced by the end that she WAS Missie); this movie is also not quite accurate to the book, but is so well-told overall, that it stands quite well on its own as a film & continuation of the series.Missie & Willie LaHaye, newly married, encounter quite a few adventures, both on their journey West & in settling their new homestead!  From Indians (Native Americans) to rustlers & outlaws, they must perservere to establish their new ranch & keep it running.  And to add to the drama, Missie becomes pregnant and is miles from the closest doctor: will this brave couple be able to overcome the obstacles in their way?!?For those of you worried about content, this is a clean film! There is no language that I can recall; there is some tense situations with Indians & again with some outlaws, but overall it is very family-friendly, and content is not going to be an issue.This is a wonderful, family-friendly story that promotes good values of love, honor, courage, faith, forgiveness, and much more!

946512,AU1E6KDG1FMG6,B000BO0LPO,Rebekah A. Lane,"[1, 1]","The opening scene in this movie is of a young couple splitting ways with their wagon train and heading off to find the land they will be homesteading. From their calm self assurance, you'd almost think they were on a Sunday drive, but the peaceful atmosphere is broken when the wife, Missy, who is suffering from morning sickness, jumps off the wagon and loses her lunch in the bushes. The first conversation between the couple is stilted, almost as if they had met each other yesterday and weren't sure how to act. But it gets alot better as it goes along, revealing a beautiful interpersonel relationship between two Christian young people beginning a new life in the west together. The dissapiontment was that it could have been ANY couple. There wasn't a whole lot Missy an Willie about their relationship. In Love's Enduring Promise, Willie was blunt and mischivious, as well as sensetive and warm-hearted, while Missy was something of an idealist. January Jones portrayed her as a woman of intense emotion, but reserved and poised, with deep convictions, warm, but not a Teddy Bear, independant and opinionated, and, perhaps most of all, with a gentle dignity. The Missy in Love's Long Journey is a very sweet lady, but not the Missy Davis from Love Comes Softly, and Love's Enduring Promise. She is a cuddly, mellow, tenderhearted benefactress, on the lookout for someone with troubles, and easy to please. Missy Davis always was a hard worker, but now that she's preagnant and in the west, her industrious side is not brought out. After she cuts down the tall grass in her front yard, all she is shown doing is galloping (yes, preagnant!) over to her Indian friend's house to teach the children there how to read, driving into town, writing letters to her parents back home, making conversation with the ranch hands, or serving rock hard biscuits when she has company. Sounds like a modern woman thrown back in time. Throughout the movie, bad guys pop up on the sideline, and when a tipsy ranch hand inadvertantly tells them about Willie's money, trouble starts for the Lehaye family. When tragedy strikes, Missy must summon all her courage to save the day. At the close of the movie is a touching scene of Willie meeting his new son, who Missie names Matthew, after his long lost brother.
