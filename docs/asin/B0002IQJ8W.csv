835849,A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,B0002IQJ8W,,"[0, 0]","For all of you thirty-somethings out there who grew up on John Hughes' pitch-perfect illustrations of teen angst, ""Mean Girls"" will serve as a welcome breath of fresh air to all those leaden, overwrought, ridiculous versions of what it means to be a teenager showing on the WB. There has been a small number of films in recent years (""Clueless"" and ""Saved!"" come immediately to mind), that are nicely filling in the gap left when Hughes' brat packers became too old to be playing high schoolers (though actually they were too old to be playing high schoolers even back then). ""Mean Girls"" makes great points but veers away from ever taking itself too seriously. It treats teenagers and their problems with enough gravity to make us care but isn't afraid to make fun of them a little bit too...And come on, when we look back on our teenage years, don't we have to admit that what we thought were problems then were actually pretty lame?Lindsay Lohan has the makings of a big star if she handles her career carefully. She's adorable, with a natural screen presence that overpowers whoever she's on screen with. I'm looking forward to seeing what she does with herself in the next few years.See ""Mean Girls.""

835850,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B0002IQJ8W,,"[0, 0]","Just seeing the previews of this movie, I kinda shrugged it off as a typical crappy teen movie that's been released over recent years. The comments I've heard were mostly the same: ""It was a funny movie."" Hmm... okay, so it's funny. Sadly I would have to wait until its video release.The movie seemed quite popular. And it seemed to make Lindsay Lohan more popular than ever. So it came time for me to finally watch it and judge for myself. To my surprise, the movie was quite funny. No... make that: freaking hilarious. Never before had I laughed out loud so hard. It's been a very long time since a movie has done that to me. It's not the gross-out or sexual humor that seems to plague recent teen comedies (or just regular comedies in general). Well... there's still some sexual humor, but even that made me laugh harder.""The Plastics"" rule the school, and Lindsay's character, Cady, finds a hard time fitting in with not just high school, but public schooling. Cady grew up in Africa and was home-schooled, so the culture she grew up with doesn't apply so much with a normal high school. She's more of a foreigner here. Eventually she finds a small group of friends, but only later on does she get caught up in the wrong group. Enter the ""Plastics."" She was good friends with them... until one of them hurt Cady... y'know, emotionally. Then the name-calling, rumor-spreading ensues, and other mischevious sinister acts occur.The screenplay is written by SNL member Tina Fey (who plays Cady's math teacher here). Although extremely funny, the movie contains the same ""kiss-and-make-up"" formula that's seen in just about every other teen movie. But the humor nonetheless is enough to keep you laughing.The movie made Lindsay Lohan one of the biggest celebrities around, but I get the feeling that Lindsay's personality changed because of this movie. What happened to the tomboy-ish, ""punky"" chick we all saw in ""Freaky Friday"" and before? Like how Cady changed in this movie, Lindsay herself seemed to have changed... oh well, ""Mean Girls"" is an entertaining movie.",4,Hmm... funny flick,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2067,"['Just', 'seeing', 'previews', 'movie', 'kinda', 'shrugged', 'off', 'typical', 'crappy', 'teen', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'recent', 'years', 'comments', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'were', 'mostly', 'same', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'Hmm', 'okay', 'funny', 'Sadly', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'video', 'release.The', 'movie', 'seemed', 'quite', 'popular', 'seemed', 'make', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'more', 'popular', 'ever', 'came', 'time', 'finally', 'watch', 'judge', 'surprise', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'make', 'freaking', 'hilarious', 'Never', 'had', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'so', 'hard', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'done', 'not', 'gross-out', 'sexual', 'humor', 'plague', 'recent', 'teen', 'comedies', 'just', 'regular', 'comedies', 'general', 'Well', 'still', 'sexual', 'humor', 'even', 'made', 'laugh', 'harder', 'Plastics', 'rule', 'school', 'Lindsay', 'character', 'Cady', 'hard', 'time', 'fitting', 'not', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'public', 'schooling', 'Cady', 'grew', 'up', 'Africa', 'was', 'home-schooled', 'culture', 'grew', 'up', ""n't"", 'apply', 'so', 'much', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'more', 'foreigner', 'here', 'Eventually', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'only', 'later', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'wrong', 'group', 'Enter', 'Plastics', 'was', 'good', 'friends', 'one', 'hurt', 'Cady', ""y'know"", 'emotionally', 'Then', 'name-calling', 'rumor-spreading', 'ensues', 'other', 'mischevious', 'sinister', 'occur.The', 'screenplay', 'written', 'SNL', 'member', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'who', 'Cady', 'math', 'teacher', 'here', 'extremely', 'funny', 'movie', 'same', 'kiss-and-make-up', 'formula', 'seen', 'just', 'other', 'teen', 'movie', 'humor', 'nonetheless', 'enough', 'keep', 'laughing.The', 'movie', 'made', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'one', 'biggest', 'celebrities', 'get', 'feeling', 'Lindsay', 'personality', 'changed', 'movie', 'What', 'happened', 'tomboy-ish', 'punky', 'chick', 'saw', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'how', 'Cady', 'changed', 'movie', 'Lindsay', 'seemed', 'have', 'changed', 'oh', 'well', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

A friend suggested we rent this movie, and I must say I enjoyed it so much I went out and bought a copy. All credit must surely go to Saturday Night Live alum Tina Fey. Her script is just incredibly funny. One of the best teen movies I have ever seen. It ranks with Sixteen Candles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless, all classics of the genre. Without rambling on about the plot particulars, this film basically portrays an outsider's entry into the ""inside"" clique of a particularly nasty and bitchy group of popular girls. Lohan herself has impecable comic timing, the direction is spot on, and the ending is quite  touching and  even though it almost falls into cliche ( the outsider learning that the ""inside"" isn't what it seems to be) it works rather well.

835855,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002IQJ8W,,"[0, 0]","Teen queen Lindsey Lohan and Saturday Night Live head writer Tina Fey manage to pull off what few have done before - make a teen chick flick that is funny and watchable for all ages and both sexes.  The danger signs were all there: a cast filled with SNL regulars (and produced by Lorne Michaels), a rookie screenwriter adapting a non-traditional book (""Queen Bees and Wannabees,"" a parental guide of all things), and territory eerily similar to ""Clueless"" and ""Heathers.""  It could have been a thoughtless, cliche-ridden retread through Grade 11 social cliques.  Instead, it's a funny, insightful, and even occasionally thought-provoking film, ranking just below Heathers for films of this type.Cady (Lohan) is the new girl in school.  Not only that, she was previously home-schooled by her parents who were research scientists in Africa.  From that loving, sheltered life she is thrown into a large, wealthy suburban school and has to find her way.  She is first befriended by the artsy, thoughtful social outsiders, two of whom have a grudge against the alpha-female in the school.  Because Cady looks like ... well, Lindsey Lohan .... she is good looking enough to infiltrate and disrupt the cool kids clique (called ""the Plastics"" by the artsies in reference to their Barbie-doll dos and clothes).  As Cady spends more and more time with the Plastics, however, she becomes co-opted into their world and becomes one of them - dumb but fashionable.As satire, the movie works to this point.  Unfortunately, it never quite goes all the way.  The artsy group is really no better than the Plastics in terms of their scheming and rancor to those outside their social group.  Tina Fey reveals her natural bias (someone as smart and creative as she would have to have belonged to such a group in high school) and instead of everyone getting their comeuppance, only the cool kids (from various cliques) do.  Since most of us watching the movie will not have been Plastics in school, we don't mind too much, but it's a shame because the movie could easily have been elevated to the level of great instead of simply being good.In every way other than social satire, though, the film IS great.  The performances by the SNL cast members are surprisingly low-key so as not to overshadow the teenagers.  The Plastics are humanised just enough by their portrayers that we feel for them even as we enjoy their downfalls.  Even the rest of the students are recognisable types.  If they are exaggerated for the purpose of the comedy, they are not so exaggerated that the film descends into farce, as too many films of this type do.  Finally, the central role in a film like this is essential - Cady is onscreen for something like 95% of the running time - and Lohan has the presence and sincerity to pull off the part believably.The DVD edition has about what you'd expect for a film of this kind - a commentary, deleted scenes, some blooper outtakes, a featurette about the source material, etc.  It's a nice little set of extras to go with a good movie.",4,"Heathers crossed with Clueless, and funnier than both",1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,3040,"['Teen', 'queen', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'head', 'writer', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'few', 'have', 'done', 'make', 'teen', 'chick', 'flick', 'funny', 'watchable', 'ages', 'sexes', 'danger', 'signs', 'were', 'cast', 'filled', 'SNL', 'regulars', 'produced', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'rookie', 'screenwriter', 'adapting', 'non-traditional', 'book', 'Queen', 'Bees', 'Wannabees', 'parental', 'guide', 'things', 'territory', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Clueless', 'Heathers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thoughtless', 'cliche-ridden', 'retread', 'Grade', '11', 'social', 'cliques', 'Instead', 'funny', 'insightful', 'even', 'occasionally', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'ranking', 'just', 'Heathers', 'films', 'type.Cady', 'Lohan', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'previously', 'home-schooled', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'research', 'scientists', 'Africa', 'loving', 'sheltered', 'life', 'thrown', 'large', 'wealthy', 'suburban', 'school', 'find', 'way', 'first', 'befriended', 'artsy', 'thoughtful', 'social', 'outsiders', 'two', 'whom', 'have', 'grudge', 'alpha-female', 'school', 'Cady', 'looks', 'well', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'good', 'looking', 'enough', 'infiltrate', 'disrupt', 'cool', 'kids', 'clique', 'called', 'Plastics', 'artsies', 'reference', 'Barbie-doll', 'dos', 'clothes', 'Cady', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'Plastics', 'however', 'co-opted', 'world', 'one', 'dumb', 'fashionable.As', 'satire', 'movie', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'quite', 'way', 'artsy', 'group', 'really', 'better', 'Plastics', 'terms', 'scheming', 'rancor', 'social', 'group', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'natural', 'bias', 'someone', 'smart', 'creative', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'belonged', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'instead', 'everyone', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'only', 'cool', 'kids', 'various', 'cliques', 'do', 'most', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Plastics', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'shame', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'elevated', 'level', 'great', 'instead', 'simply', 'being', 'good.In', 'way', 'other', 'social', 'satire', 'though', 'film', 'IS', 'great', 'performances', 'SNL', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'low-key', 'so', 'not', 'overshadow', 'teenagers', 'Plastics', 'are', 'humanised', 'just', 'enough', 'portrayers', 'feel', 'even', 'enjoy', 'downfalls', 'Even', 'rest', 'students', 'are', 'recognisable', 'types', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'purpose', 'comedy', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'film', 'farce', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'type', 'do', 'Finally', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'essential', 'Cady', 'onscreen', 'something', '95', '%', 'running', 'time', 'Lohan', 'presence', 'sincerity', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'believably.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'about', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'film', 'kind', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'outtakes', 'featurette', 'source', 'material', 'etc', 'nice', 'little', 'set', 'extras', 'go', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
835856,A228JH8V9Y700G,B0002IQJ8W,,"[0, 0]","There have always been Mean Girls wherever we go, but in high school is when they seem to cruelest and most vicious because adolescence is quite a horror story to begin with.  Here we see what happens when absolute power corrupts and power corrupts absolutely.Cady (in Lindsay Lohan's breakout role) has come to a public high school in Illinois after having spent her whole life in Africa being home schooled with traveling professors.  This is an adjustment to say the least.  She befriends some art freaks at first, and they introduce her from afar to the Mean Girls - three girls who wear pink every Wednesday and seem to have a control.  Known as The Plastics.  Cady all of a sudden gains their attraction and friendship, then her art freak friends want to conspire to take down their leader, Regina George.  However, as Cady is accepted by The Plastics she assimilates to their behaviors and drifts further from the original plan.  Her punk rock friends are disenchanted, Regina flexes her powers of manipulation to make her know that she is still in comand, and then it all falls down.Perhaps the greatest moment of this movie was the scene where Regina discovers Cady's deceit and pulls the ultimate stunt: copying pages in their Burn Book, distributing them throughout the hallways, allowing all the girls to pick them up, and the whole place explodes in violence.  That's what it's really all about, the sense of power and control.  If people were/are bigger than this, they would've walked away and not allowed it to destroy them.  Cady became the Queen Bee for a moment, then she realized that she abused her power just as much as Regina did.  We outgrow these things, but not completely, which is why there are still Mean GIrls around us today.  Lessons learned?

835857,AVCRD98TH48RN,B0002IQJ8W,,"[0, 0]","This film reminded me of the classic 80s Cult film ""Heathers"" with all the references to cliques and the rules governing them but without the dark comedy and a smaller amount of biting satire.  The lead character is a young, beautiful girl who was ""home schooled"" until she was fifteen years old; she was raised in Africa, far away from all the insanity of public school life.  Then she is thrust into teenage society.  This is another fish-out-of-water story but it is far more interesting in that the young lady begins to take on the characteristics of the group in which she is apart of.  The transformation from pretty, smart, polite, and charming to becoming one of ""The Plastics"" is both humorous and socially astute.  There are cliche's in this story that inhabit every teen flick, such as the gorgeous guy that all the girls lose their collective minds over.  However, there are enough fresh moments and/or fresh perspectives on old topics that make the film run smoothly.  The satire that is present is more in line with making fun of pop culture.  When the most popular girl in school has her clothes vandalized she simply shrugs and wears them anyway, thus ushering in a new fashion trend that all the wannabes try to emulate.  There is a lot of that type of cerebral pop-culture bashing that I thoroughly enjoyed.  There are also many enlightening moments about why girls behave the way they do.  Granted, these situations are overblown for entertainment purposes, but the end result is intelligent nonetheless.  The entire cast shows up for this film with each actor leaning on the other and feeding off one another for the sake of sustaining a more beleivable equillibrium of character.  In other words, each character is represented appropriately but never to the point of overbearing the storyline.  Lead actress Lindsay Lohan proves here that she can carry a movie with more subtelty than I would have initially envisioned.  Before seeing this film I thought she was just another teen actress with gorgeous...eyes.

The film completely grabbed me from beginning to end with its satirical look at the drama that occur in high school.First off, incredible praise goes out to Tina Fey (of SNL) for adapting and presenting a compeltely humorous screenplay. Performance wise, Lindsay Lohan is pitch perfect in the role of Cady, going from an outsider to a ""plastic"" flawlessly. This has to be one of her best performances so far. Worth noting is the supporting role of Rachel McAdams who is a force to be reconed with when on screen; as she steals every scene and makes it her own. Very good actress.The thing that makes Mean Girls so good is that even though the comedy is very satirical it still holds true to the stereotypes of high school life. In the cafeteria scene where the camera flies by the different social tables (the nerds, the art freaks etc) it's incedible how that was portrayed because even today, it still occurs. The movie also touched upon family life and how children can drift away from their parents as they enter high school. Obviously, these situations have been dealt with in previous high school teen flicks, but I have got to say that it was wonderfully presented in this film.So in the end, who knew that this movie was going to be a success?

Behind the outrageous situations and improbable moments there lurks an element of truth, as anyone who recalls the mean streets of middle and high school social life will agree. That is, unless she was a member of one of the envied and elite cliques of supercool kids, known in this film as The Plastics. These snooty Barbie-doll lookalikes rule the high school roost until the arrival of the formerly home-schooled Cady (played by the seemingly ubiquitous Lindsay Lohan). Shocked at the power wielded by the three Plastics girls, Cady befriends a couple of creative but ""un-cool"" students and together they plot the downfall of the trendy triumvirate. The idea is to have Cady infiltrate the group, which she does, only to be drawn in to the allure of popularity, hot clothes, and attention from the ""cool"" boys. Formerly a math wiz and all-around A student, Cady deliberately fudges her math tests so that the cute guy in her class won't think she's a brainy nerd; she trades in her own style of dress (think Land's End, Gap, and L.L. Bean) for overpriced micro-minis and skintight tops (think Juicy Couture). In other words, she begins to dress, talk, and think like The Plastics, even turning against her original pals. Fortunately for all, everything comes right in the end. The Plastics meet their comeuppance (and even reform), and Cady--after some moments of self-discovery and humiliation--reverts to her true self AND remains popular. Of course that's way too simple for real life, but this is The Movies after all. ""Mean Girls"" is a good movie for teenagers to watch, although members of the cool cliques--alas--will probably not recognize themselves. There's also nice acting by a talented young cast.

Produced by Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, and written and starring several SNL alumni, it had a stigma of stupidity. Yet the reviews said it was smart, funny, and well-done.The reviews were right. For the most part, this is an intelligent movie. The premise is that a home-schooled girl fresh off the plane with her African-studying professor parents would finds the rituals of high school alien. Every so often she sees that world in light of her African knowledge. Graft on the typical story of revenge against the Heathers-like girls who run the schoool, the Plastics, and you've got something that is a fresh enough variant on cliques in school that it's interesting.Surprisingly for an SNL-related script (thankfully, however, not a direct inspiration from any SNL skit, though), the writer, Tina Fey, keeps most of the elements from going over-the-top (maybe it was because her script was based on a book?). If anything, I was surprised that the movie didn't use the kids-as-animals comparisons more, but more might have been strained in this case, and it was probably the right move to be restrained. There's also a wonderful bit with a school bus that gets played on early and then returns for the climax that seems in the end to have been a surprise until you realize they clued you in about it in the first minutes. All of the characters, while based on stereotypes, come across as more real than one usually gets in these teen movies; even the mean girls of the title are understandable.The most annoying thing in the movie was fellow-SNL alumnus Amy Poehler as the alpha-mean girl's very liberal-minded mother. In a couple of gags that the Farrelly brothers would have been proud of, she lowers the entire tone of the movie. Luckily, her part is minimal. (The other SNL cast member, Tim Meadows, however, does a great turn as the school principal.)I'd rank this one with other teen high school flicks such as Fast Times at Ridgmont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and Heathers.

I went to an all boys Catholic school where disputes weren't settled through rumor or innuendo but dealt with the old fashioned way, after school manno-a-manno by the railroad tracks.  Scripter Tina Fey makes many cogent observations about the cruel nature of high school one-upmanship.  My theory is that Fey is trying to paralell the pimple-faced backstabbing with what later morphs into adult office politics.  In my office disputes aren't settled in the cubicles but through bathroom gossip allowed to ferment into character assassination.  Why I don't give ""Mean Girls"" the full five-star treatment is my trouble with Lindsay Lohan's character.  Appealing as Lohan is here it was hard for me to believe that her home-schooled Cady could that easily transform into a duplicitous Plastic Girl.  Rachel McAdams, however, is a real revelation here as the nasty Regina.  In a performance of great tact and understatement (for a Queen Bee role) McAdams manages to engender a modicum of sympathy for the devil.

Admittedly, like any other red-blooded American twenty-something male bought this movie because of one reason. Okay - two reasons, and they both have to do with Lindsay Lohan. I honestly thought that this was going to be one of the most ridiculously stupid high school clich&egrave; movies I'd ever seen. The movie was far from that, and so much more.Written by Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live fame, the movie is loosely based off of a book called Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. The book is about how there is always a leader and followers, and how the followers would rather be followers, because even if the leader is evil, being a follower of the mean leader is better than not being a follower at all. I haven't actually read the book though, so this is just a rough idea of what it is about from reading about it on Amazon.com.There are initially three ""mean girls,"" Regina the Queen Bee, and Gretchen & Karen, her followers. They are known as the plastics. Cady, played by Lindsay Lohan befriends two outcasts who hold a grudge with Regina because of something that happened when they were in middle school. Regina, seeing the possible competition with Cady follows the old moniker of ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"" and decides to invite her into the Plastics. Throughout the movie, grudges are made, boyfriends are lost, typical high school parties occur (though I'd never been to one of these when I was in high school), friends are lost, grudges are overcome, and a lesson is learned using a recurring joke with a school bus.Despite actually purchasing this movie simply because Lindsay Lohan was in it, I found it to be a truly enjoyable experience. In the end, of the mean girls, I actually thought Amanda Seyfried, who plays Karen - the clinically stupid one, was actually the most attractive person in the movie.

835887,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0002IQJ8W,,"[1, 3]","A film by Mark S WatersBeing a teenaged movie starring Lindsay Lohan, ""Mean Girls"" was going to be a moderately successful movie no matter how funny or well made the movie actually was.  It was aimed at a target demographic of teenaged girls (and perhaps teenage males who just want to look at Lindsay Lohan) and this demographic was going to see this movie.  As I am not part of the target demographic and do not understand the whole Lindsay Lohan phenomenon, ""Mean Girls"" was something that initially held no interest to me.  That was, until, I found out that the screenplay was written by Tina Fey.  Fey is the best thing about Saturday Night Live (she is one of the head writers as well as co-host of ""Weekend Update"") and her writing hopefully would raise ""Mean Girls"" above being just another not very good teen movie.  Mostly, it did.Cady (Lindsay Lohan) was home schooled for her entire life up until this, her junior year of high school.  To make her even more of a potential outcast she has been living in Africa because her parents were researchers there.  When she arrives she immediately befriends social misfits Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and her very gay friend Damian (Daniel Franzese).  Janis and Damian show Cady the ropes and explain the school's social structure to her.  Janis points out the various groups and how the cafeteria seating arrangements are organized.  There are the math geeks, the stoners, the hot asian girls, other groups, and The Plastics.  The Plastics rule the school.  The Plastics are the glamorous social elites who by their actions decide what and who is cool.  The leader of the Plastics and the Queen Bee of the school is Regina (Rachel McAdams).  Regina, along with the other Plastics Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried) also befriend Cady.  They see Cady as something of an exotic and probably enjoy her ignorance as much as anything else and they see that Cady has not yet become a part of any other group.  But Janis and Damian have another plan, that Cady infiltrate the Plastics and report back all the gossip on them so the gossip and information can be used against the Plastics.  When Regina steals away the guy that Cady is interested in (who was Regina's ex anyway), Cady decides to get even.One of the best things about ""Mean Girls"" is the comparison it makes between high school and the animal kingdom.  The comparison is apt because it reflects Cady's perspective coming from being home schooled in Africa.  Fights and slights and intimidation take on a more animalistic aura, which is made obvious through Cady's daydream imaginations of what is going on underneath the surface of a given situation.  Tina Fey's writing has the viciously sarcastic bite that we also see on Weekend Update (some lines and jokes feel like they have been lifted directly from SNL), but she has also done an excellent job in taking a non-fiction book about girls in high school (""Queen Bees and Wannabees"") and turn it into a fairly intelligent, funny, entertaining movie.  Fey is also one of the movie's highlights as math teacher Ms Norbury.""Mean Girls"" does lose focus, however, and is maybe only have of a really good movie.  The other half is simply any other teenaged high school movie.  It is far superior to ""She's All That"" but does fall short of being as viciously interesting as something like ""Heathers"".  The trap that it falls into is that instead of being clever and unique the entire way through the movie, ""Mean Girls"" becomes the same petty high school revenge movie (though with the Fey twist).

SNL alumni Tina Fey provides a sharp, witty script that made critics and audiences alike roar with laughter.  Teen superstar Lindsay Lohan is fantastic and further proves to us that her delightful performance in ""Freaky Friday"" was no accident.The cast is great and the humor is abundant, but I really felt that the script was way too standard for such an intriguing premise and lacking in all-out satire.  In addition, a lot of the humor was definitely aimed towards the pre-teen crowd and was way too silly for a film that heavily depended on satire.  I mean come on, how many farts and gay jokes must we endure?  This low-brow humor really surprised me, coming from Tina Fey and all.  I felt that it really lowered the overall effect of the film.  It's definitely not a good idea to combine satire and slapstick humor; a film is either one or the other, not both.  And what was with the ridiculously corny ending where everyone makes nice and are happy?All in all, ""Mean Girls"" is an enjoyable 90-minute flick.

While it desplicts some of the realisms of teen girls struggling to fit into a clique, it includes numerous unforgettable humorous scenes.  Tina Fey, star of ""Saturday Night Live"", extends her comedy talents by adapting this screenplay from the novel ""Queen Bees And Wannabes"".  This proved highly difficult considering the novel is more informative rather than humorous or teen-directed.  It follows a girl, Cady, who was always home schooled until now.  After her move from Africa, she starts high school.  Immediately, she learns the true teen school issues.  The variety of character personalities give this film a unique twist that always becomes more interesting scene after scene.  Though some of the acting is occasionally flawed, namely by those who play The Plastics, they give these characters great viewing pleasure.  All offer their own unique twist to the film, especially Lohan and Fey.  ""Mean Girls"" is a highly entertaining film for all ages to enjoy.

When I heard she'd written and appeared in a film, I thought about other SNL people who've failed. Well, Tina is on target. She not only hits all the elements of good narrative (discovery, conflict, redemption, resolution), but carries it to a special place which I admire. This is NOT another dumb teen movie. Ms. Fey's in-your-face subtlety is masterfully created, and there's a team of great young actors to pull this off~~largely due to understated direction by Mark Waters, who has a profound respect for the script. Teen attitudes are as similar today as they were when I was in high school back in the 60's.

835893,AJJBIXVL2U8FP,B0002IQJ8W,,"[2, 5]","I received this movie as a gift, and it is one of those gifts that keep giving. I saw this twice in theaters, and thought it was decent, but I really loved it after watching it and it's features at home.If you haven't heard, it's a story about highschool. Yawn, right? Yet, it's a wittier version of the hell we remember. It's the story of Cady Herron (Lohan), who just moved from Africa where her parents had set up their lifes research as zoologists and homeschooled Cady. Her first day of school, and she's being thrown into Highschool. After facing the Savanna and wild animals, she is about to face some of the best and worst; in her math class she meets some of the best. A large guy who's 'almost too gay to function' and his best friend Janice, a rumored lesbian and loner\artsy kid. They hit it off, and tell her where to go and who to avoid. But there is one group espically to avoid: The Plastics. Gretchen Weiners-the gossip (Lacy Chabert), Karen Smith-the dumb one (Amanda Seyford), and Regina George-the meanest (Rachel McAdams). But when Janice and Damien come up with a way for Cady to infiltrate The Plastics after they hit it off.This story may seem pretty plain, and everyone claims it's 'innovative' (shigeru miyamoto?) or the best highschool satire. Well, if the only thing to compare it to is 'Not Another Teen Movie'... It's leaps and bounds ahead. It is smart AND funny, a pleasant surprise coming from SNL writers and producers (anymore, SNL is ridiculous... especially Fallon). And that's the other thing that people keep bringing up, and it's really true: Writer and star Tina Fey is amazing and the only funny thing on SNL, adding the perfect mix of real school experiences and basing the script off the non-fiction book 'Queen Bees and Wannabes' which is in its own right amazing. But it's not just the physical comedy and sight gags (the boob cutouts are hilarious!) it's the subtle dialouge. I can't stress how well written her script is. The only problem lies in the characters. Lohan's character follows her real life transformation from childhood actor and model to skanked out teen queen. The Plastics are good, but Chabert and Seyford are kind of cliche (dumb one, rich one) but their performances make up for it. McAdams doesn't have to act, all girls know what how to be a bitch. But Daniel Franzese (Damian) and Lizzy Caplan (Janis Ian) are where the movie really shine, as do all the background characters. No main character has as many funny lines as Amy Poehler, who plays the rich mom of Regina, making them margaritas and getting breast implants. So, if you can look at some two dimensional characters as satiracal, your good to go.The special are nice for a teeny bopper comedy. We get a commentary between Director Mark Waters and Writer Tina Fey, with a few quips by Producer Lorne Michaels, where they talk about writing, high school, tech and the actors versus their characters. An above average commentary, I suggest it to anyone new to the dvd format (hermits and the elderly are likely the only ones) or someone who skips the features and leaves them for dead. Next, are deleted scenes, most cut because the gag didn't test well or time, most would have worked but Fey and Waters tell us why they ended up on the cutting room floor. Bloopers are on here, mostly funny flubbed lines and trips. Some featurettes round out the disc, starting with one called 'Only the Strong Survive', a making of type. Next, one called 'The Politics of Girl World', this one focuses on the message of the film and the influence from the book. Finally 'Plastic Fashion', which is about exactly that, the wardrobe of the movie.Despite Lindsay Lohan, who hasn't made a great movie since 'Parent Trap', everyone else shines, and Fey's script cuts to the center of what highschool was all about. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer, and popularity won't matter any more.A great movie that tween girls might need to see, and teen girls may want to.

The `teen comedy' genre of late has been full of misfires - a plethora of movies so blatantly commercial and so lacking in originality!

Like those minor classics, it is laugh out loud funny and on target. It spares none of it characters, yet allows them the right to be human - everyone explores and everyone makes mistakes. As in the best of satires, even the meanest of characters has his or her redeeming qualities.Lindsey Lohman plays Cady who, having been home schooled by her anthropologist parents in Africa, finds herself suddenly a junior in a public high school outside Chicago. Totally lacking in American high school knowledge, she doesn't know which `clique' she should join. [One senses she would prefer to join none.] Enticed by a group of outsiders, she takes on a group called ""The Plastics"", so-called because these girls bear a striking resemblance to Barbie dolls. As she infiltrates the group, though, she becomes more and more like them.Ms. Lohman is an actress to watch. There is a blend of Audrey Hepburn and Julia Roberts to her.

835896,AADJXNY9HSKJF,B0002IQJ8W,Aaron,"[1, 1]","To me, ""Mean Girls"" harkened back to the John Hughes teen flicks of the mid-80's. It's funny, has great characters, and is slightly crude, but not offensively so. It's crude but done with a touch of innosence. Teen flicks of the last several years have just been crude and offensive without that innocent quality which is why they have stunk.The story is about a home schooled girl named Cady who returns from Africa and starts going to public school. She is instantly swept into a very real world of cliques and is somehow swept up into the world of a group of prep-ish girls nicknamed ""the plastics."" Yeah, it may sound satupid, but it's really not. All the girls are great in their roles (and Rachel McAdams is HOT....but i digress....) Lyndsay Lohan also is spectacular and continues her winning streak. Although I didn't care for ""Confessions of A Teenage Drama Queen"", she makes up for that disaster with this movie. The movie can be viewed somewhat as mean-spirited in places....but isn't that what high school is all about? Unforunately so which is what makes the movie somewhat believable.""Mean Girls"" gets my vote as second best movie of the year *""Dawn of the Dead"" was my favorite""* and the second most amusing film of the year *first was without a doubt""White Chicks.""

835904,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0002IQJ8W,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","What I love so much about `Mean Girls' is that it stays hip and young yet is mature enough to reach further than the teen audience it was aiming at.  The performances are surprisingly top notch, and the script is so tight that it's almost a wonder to me it didn't receive at least a screenplay nomination.  It seriously is that good.  The plot is different while still juggling the same popular girl/unpopular girl mentality of many high school movies.  What makes `Mean Girls' so amazingly wonderful is the stellar chemistry between teen queens Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams (although McAdams is in her thirties).  They are so in tune with their characters and even more so with each other that they feed off one another brilliantly and capture the pure essence of the script.Lohan plays Cady (pronounced Katy), a young home schooled girl who's spent most of her life in Africa and is now thrown into the very foreign world of high school.  She's the immediate outcast due to her social retardation, but she's quickly swept up by fellow social outcasts Janis and Damian.  Cady also catches the eye of Regina, queen of the school and leader of The Plastics, teen royalty as their so affectionately coined (emote sarcasm).  Janis and Damian devise a plan to infiltrate The Plastics layers using Cady as a pawn, getting her to become one of them in order to expose them for the evil they truly are.The entire cast is truly up to the challenge, not just scene stealers Lohan and McAdams.  Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese are hilarious as Janis and Damian while Tina Fey is affective as Cady's teacher Ms. Norbury.  To me though, one of the best supporting characters is Gretchen Wieners, played by Lacey Chabert.  She has some of the best one-liners in the film and Lacey works wonders with creating a likable air-head with layers unlike the average stereotypical dumb girl.  Tim Meadows works as well as he can with his character but he's not given much to work with so he comes off a little forced at times as if he's trying to make a big statement knowing he won't have many opportunities and it doesn't quite work as well as he'd like it to.  Amy Poehler on the other hand uses her few minutes to work her comedic brilliance and makes a lasting impression.The story unfolds effortlessly, taking us from Cady's first encounter with The Plastics to her eventual acceptance to her betrayal and to her redemption with such grace and elegance that the viewer is never left confused or put off.  Another nod to the script is the fact that it makes narration tolerable.  Some movies can pull it off but as a whole the idea of narration can get irritable and unnecessary.  Here though some of the best lines in the film are just the words running through Cady's head and Lohan's voice over is natural and entertaining.  One of the greatest teen comedies since `Clueless' and in my humble opinion it's even better than it's classic predecessor, `Mean Girls' is a triumph and a film that launched the careers of two of our most bankable teen leading ladies!",5,They may be mean but this teen comedy is a very nice surprise...,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,3052,"['What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'hip', 'young', 'yet', 'mature', 'enough', 'reach', 'further', 'teen', 'audience', 'was', 'aiming', 'performances', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'top', 'notch', 'script', 'so', 'tight', 'almost', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'least', 'screenplay', 'nomination', 'seriously', 'good', 'plot', 'different', 'still', 'juggling', 'same', 'popular', 'girl/unpopular', 'girl', 'mentality', 'many', 'high', 'school', 'movies', 'What', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'so', 'amazingly', 'wonderful', 'stellar', 'chemistry', 'teen', 'queens', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'McAdams', 'thirties', 'are', 'so', 'tune', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'feed', 'off', 'one', 'brilliantly', 'capture', 'pure', 'essence', 'script.Lohan', 'Cady', 'pronounced', 'Katy', 'young', 'home', 'schooled', 'girl', 'who', ""'s"", 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'Africa', 'now', 'thrown', 'very', 'foreign', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'immediate', 'outcast', 'due', 'social', 'retardation', 'quickly', 'swept', 'up', 'fellow', 'social', 'outcasts', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'Cady', 'also', 'eye', 'Regina', 'queen', 'school', 'leader', 'Plastics', 'teen', 'royalty', 'affectionately', 'coined', 'emote', 'sarcasm', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'devise', 'plan', 'infiltrate', 'Plastics', 'layers', 'using', 'Cady', 'pawn', 'getting', 'become', 'one', 'order', 'expose', 'evil', 'truly', 'are.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'truly', 'up', 'challenge', 'not', 'just', 'scene', 'stealers', 'Lohan', 'McAdams', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'affective', 'Cady', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Norbury', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'played', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'best', 'one-liners', 'film', 'Lacey', 'wonders', 'creating', 'likable', 'air-head', 'layers', 'average', 'stereotypical', 'dumb', 'girl', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'character', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'so', 'off', 'little', 'forced', 'times', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'statement', 'knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'opportunities', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'like', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'other', 'hand', 'few', 'minutes', 'work', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'lasting', 'impression.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'effortlessly', 'taking', 'Cady', 'first', 'encounter', 'Plastics', 'eventual', 'acceptance', 'betrayal', 'redemption', 'such', 'grace', 'elegance', 'viewer', 'never', 'left', 'confused', 'put', 'off', 'nod', 'script', 'fact', 'narration', 'tolerable', 'movies', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'whole', 'idea', 'narration', 'can', 'get', 'irritable', 'unnecessary', 'Here', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'words', 'running', 'Cady', 'head', 'Lohan', 'voice', 'natural', 'entertaining', 'One', 'greatest', 'teen', 'comedies', 'Clueless', 'humble', 'opinion', 'even', 'better', 'classic', 'predecessor', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'triumph', 'film', 'launched', 'careers', 'two', 'most', 'bankable', 'teen', 'leading', 'ladies']",N/A
835905,A11LBR6P1FIZEE,B0002IQJ8W,"Andrew Kulick ""bibi""","[2, 2]","First of all I would like to start off with this is a great and true movie. It highlights all the typical things that happen in high school and puts it in a comical way for all to enjoy. The story is about a girl from Africa who has never been to a public school before and has to go dramatic social changes to live with high school life. I cannot name any teen film that has ever put high school life in more of a better view, this is probably because it is based on a book ""Queen Bees & Wannabees"". The truth is this is how high school life is like. I can relate to this film out of everyone because I too went through the same thing. I had never been to a public school before, only private, and I two years before freshman year in a private school in France. My freshman year entering a private school was definetly a shock, just like the main character Cady played by Linsday Lohan goes through. The first day of school I did not know what to do, I would sit at tables and people would say ""someones sitting there"" which is what happens to Cady in the film. This is what High School life is like. I also spent my first day of school eating my lunch in the bathroom like she also does in the film. But enough about me and more about the story. The film basically uses every highschool group you can think about ""asian nerds, cool asians, art freaks, burnouts, sexually active bandgeeks, jocks..."" and alot more groups that are in high schools now. What I liked most about this film is that it definetly gives the perfect view on high school life and tells you what to do in times. The movie is predictable but it is very funny and I bought it on DVD and watch it all the time. The movie might seem like a typical teen movie but if you are or were not a popular kid in high school you will definetly see this movie has a bigger meaning to it.

Her parents (Ana Gasteyer and Neil Flynn) have raised her in Africa, where she can enjoy herself without the pressure of being a high school teenager in Suburban America. However, her world comes to a crashing halt when she learns she has to go to school in America now that her parents' studies are finished. Her firstd day at California naturally doesn't go very well. However, on her second day, she meets Janis Ian (Lizzie Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese). They befriend Cady and guide her the school's convoluted society. They also tell her the legend of the Plastics, aka the most popular and most hated girls in the whole school. Janis has a grudge toward the group's leader, Regina George (Rachel McAdams, so Janis has Cady infiltrate the Plastics by pretending to be one of them and reporting all their embarassing secrets to Janis and Damien. At first, the plan works like a charm: the Plastics accept Cady in their clique not knowing of the real plan, as they sabotage Regina's weight loss plan and her relationship with Aaron Samuels (forget who plays him). But slowly but surely, Cady gets deeper into the Plastics, so deep that she stops acting and becomes, subconsciously betraying her friends. The film culminates in a frenzy of catfighting and backstabbing that is at times that is a little cloying at times but overall is brilliant. And the ending perfectly wraps things up.Unlike most teen films these days, it's the writing and the acting that keeps this film afloat. Lohan is dazzling as Cady, portraying her as a shy yet outgoing girl still learning the ropes of high school. Rachel McAdams plays Regina with a twisted sincerity yet still retains the cruel edge her character posseses. The supporting cast is equally strong. I'm not a big Tina Fey fan, but even I think she did a great job as Ms. Norbury, the teacher who helps Cady get through high school. Fey also did a brilliant job writing the script, and I wish she could use this brilliance down at ""Saturday Night Live"", where she's headwriter (the show isn't doing well now). Tim Meadows, albeit in a small part, does a great job as the principal. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried are perfect as Regina's fellow plastics Gretchen and Karen. And Amy Poehler is hysterical as Regina's mom.Overall, this is a classic teen comedy.

835911,A1T84UA62FPGTW,B0002IQJ8W,Ashley Judd,"[31, 33]","Here's a fun comedy that manages right much hilarity. Is it meant to be funny in all the ways that it is? I wouldn't be knowing about that. Before going to see it I had been led to expect a more deeply serious movie about its title subject. What I got was enjoyable but not on such a serious level. The premise is that Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, comes home to the States for the first time at age sixteen because her zoologist parents have had their internship for study in Africa discontinued. She''ll be braving real school for the first time as a high school junior, since her parents home-schooled her whe they all lived in Africa. As most people (I would hope most anyhow) know, Africa is a large continent, the second largest in the world. But the movie gives little clue as to what part or parts of Africa it was where Cady and her mom and dad formerly lived. In one flashback where Cady remembers her ""first crush"" in Africa, the scenery looks most reminiscent of the steppes or savannahs of east Africa. But the view is brief and not highly panoramic, so forming any firm conclusions about its location would be unwarranted. Anyhow, in her first day in real school Cady soon has an encounter with what would seem to be a prime example of the movie's title characters. Cady asks for directions from a girl whose only response is a gleefully sarcastic ""Speak to me again and I'll kick your [word that can in other contexts mean donkey]!"". Whew, seems like the movie's drama is beginning to unfold! But surprisingly, that extremely bad-mannered brat turns out to have only a bit part in the movie. We don't end up seeing her get the attitude adjustment that she so needs. As for the first student Cady meets who is friendly to her, well that may be our first clue that the movie is actually a spoof rather than a serious drama. If you have a keen ear and recognize the song ""At Seventeen"" by Janis Ian, you'll hear it once or twice among the movie's background music. Of course, background music in movies is a routine thing. But the outlandish twist here is that the movie would have us believe that Janis Ian is actually a student at the school at the time. But wait a minute. ""At Seventeen"" was a hit that came out in 1975. So isn't Janis Ian getting up toward 40 or 50 years old these days? Surely she couldn't have attended high school in an age when students have cell phones. And students have cell phones in this movie. But ""Janis Ian"" (he-he) turns out to be the first student to significantly befriend Cady. Janis Ian would have to be too old to play herself in high school today. So they got someone named Lizzy Caplan to play her. I'd never heard of Lizzy Caplan before. But if this movie is any sign of her talents, I hope to see more of her. She transforms the presence of Janis Ian in high school in 2004 from a plain absurdy to a riotously funny happening. This movie's version of Janis Ian is a semi-candidate for being one of the title mean girls, for certainly she contributes to some of the mischief that happens. And at one point she will accuse Cady of having become a ""mean girl"". In her speech to Cady so alleging, she will say ""At least me and Regina George admit that we're mean, but you try to hide it."" Oh yes, did I mention Regina George? She's the first CLEAR candidate to emerge, among main characters, as one of the film's title characters. She's played by Rachel McAdams. Even though I've known of no one else pointing out the anacronism of placing Janis Ian in high school in this movie, I've seen several complaints on the web that Rachel McAdams is 28 years old and therefore allegedly too old to play a high school student. But I can't manage to see that as a problem. For Rachel plays her role commandingly and looks the part. Whether the latter effect is achieved by make-up, oil of olay, a fountain of youth, or whatever, she gets the job done. Yep, Regina will be captivating as the school's queen of mean. Well, I won't give away any more of the plot. But one more thing to be said is that this movie's implied images of Africa are painted in very broad strokes that are at best generic and at worst tending to be stereotypical. It is one thing to put caricatures into the mouth of arch-villain Regina. She once tells Cady, ""People say you're a home-schooled jungle freak who's a less hot version of me."" Jungle is part of an overused caricature of Africa. While there is jungle in Africa's equatorial regions, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people that percentage-wise, equatorial Africa has considerable less jungle than a lot of other equatorial land areas, such as those in South America, southeast Asia, and the East Indies. While Regina's invoking of a jungle stereotype fits in with her unheroic character, surprisingly, Cady also reflects this caricature sometimes. A recurrent theme is how Cady, in occasional dreamy sequences, analogizes high school students' behavior to that of the wildlife she knew in Africa. Then as the movie's climax kicks into gear, Cady comments on the way students are behaving at the time, saying ""It was full-tilt jungle madness"". It seems particularly ironic in light that one flashback to Africa that Cady has, making it look like she lived somewhere more like the less moist areas of east Africa. Of course, Cady's family might have travelled around through different parts of Africa in the course of her parents' studies and her growing up. So she could have some real impressions of jungle. But that would hardly make the ""full-tilt jungle madness"" comment becoming to the movie's heroine. Perhaps we're meant to take it all on the same level as Janis Ian as a high school junior in 2004. All in all, I recommend MEAN GIRLS for its comedy. Even if it doesn't have you rolling in the ailes with laughter, it should satisfyingly deliver as a quirky comic ditty.",4,"Generally zany comedy, with some flaws",1095724800,"09 21,

True, this movie has teens and teen problems, but it's so much more sharp and witty than any other teen movie I've ever seen. It surprised the heck out of me-- and made me an even bigger fan of the script writer Tina Fey, who also writes for SNL.Mean Girls stars Lindsay Lohen as Cady (pronounced Katie), a girl who has been homeschooled her entire life by her  zoologist parents in Africa. She's a confident girl, not too nervous about her first day in a ""real"" school, manages to make a couple friends, but soon gets sucked into the mean spirited world of ""The Plastics""-- three mean-spirited girls who seem nice on the outside but do lots of backstabbing to everyone around them and even the people they deem their friends. Cady then meets Aaron, a cute jock who also happens to be the ex-boyfried of The Plastics Queen Bee, Regina. And so the backstabbing ensues-- which is devilishly fun.Lohan is a delight on screen and Rachel McAdams (the Queen Bee) is so convincing as a Plastic it's not even funny-- she even looks plastic!

It has such a clever and sharp sense of humor. It was written by and contains actors from Saturday Night Live. That may account for some of the chemestry and spark that you see on screen. And it's so very funny. It has a steady laugh ratio and if you get one joke, you'll get them all. Of course, that means that not everyone will ""get"" all the jokes. They're very subtle and sharp.The characters are wonderfully real and deeply identifiable. This is actually a movie that you can, and should, watch with your kids that are going into high school. It has a lot to do with social classes, adolecent issues and good old fashioned peer pressure.I'm not going to give away any of the plot elements but it's a very creative story about how kids relate to each other.

However, Cady soon befriends Janis (Caplan) and Damian (Franzese), two 'art geeks' who are completely different from each other.

Blah blah blah, chaos ensues.While Lohan isn't that great of an actor, the rest of the cast is so spot on throughout the entire film that you barely even notice. The funniest person, in my opinion, is Lizzy Caplan, the halfway gothic arty geek. Every scene she's in you can block out everyone else because there's no doubt that she'll steal it. Sure, the basic plot is a bit used but what shines is the writing. These people have believable backgrounds and feel like real people.Girls and guys alike, if you're looking for a great comedy, don't look this over. Sure it may be classified as a chick flick but who cares, it's funny through the entire film and that's all that matters.

Right up there with Clueless, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, and American Pie, Mean Girls has some of the most hilarious comic scenes of the decade. Written by Saturday Night Live mainstay Tina Fey (who also stars as a teacher in the film), Mean Girls is supposed to chronicle some of the author's personal experiences in the social world of academics. Irrespective of its similarities to real life, Mean Girls is a light-hearted comedy with likeable characters, and it's just plain funny...Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron, a previously home-schooled, sixteen year old daughter of two world-traveling anthropologists. When her parents decide to settle down, Cady attends public school for the first time in her life. While there, she befriends social outcasts Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese) who tell her all about the inner-workings of their high school. Cady learns about The Plastics, a group of three girls who compose the social elites of the school. The previous beneficiary of Plastics leader Regina's wrath, Janis longs for the day when she can exact revenge on her former best friend from eighth grade.When The Plastics - Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) - take a liking to Cady and give her an exclusive invitation to eat lunch with them, Janis sees her opportunity for revenge. She concocts a plan to send Cady into the world of The Plastics as an ""undercover agent,"" and together, Cady, Janis, and Damian work to dig up dirt on the girls. However, the line between pretend and reality starts to blur for Cady, souring her relationship with Janis. And Cady's affection for Regina's former boyfriend Aaron (Jonathan Bennett) threatens to create a permanent chasm between the two girls... Throw in a showdown between two groups of math-letes, and you've got yourself quite a movie!As the lead character, Cady, Lindsay Lohan portrays a very likeable person, an intelligent, sweet girl who experiences her first foray into the world of public school. The audience's ability to identify with and like Cady makes it easier to enjoy a film where she alienates two groups of high school clicks and virtually everyone else around her. Meanwhile, Rachel McAdams (rising Hollywood star and lead from The Notebook) is brilliant in her performance as the socially aggressive, backstabbing Regina George.Mean Girls is a classic Darwinian high school comedy, similar to the hit TV show Freaks And Geeks, except with a little less edge. If you enjoyed the high school comedy films of the 1980's, like Can't Buy Me Love, then you'll thoroughly enjoy Mean Girls. With a well-written screenplay and supporting appearances by Saturday Night Live regulars Tina Fey and Tim Meadows, Mean Girls is a hilarious comedy and a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",4,Right up there with Clueless and The New Guy...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2946,"['One', 'funniest', 'films', '2004', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'best', 'high', 'school', 'comedies', 'time', 'Right', 'there', 'Clueless', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'American', 'Pie', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'most', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'scenes', 'decade', 'Written', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'mainstay', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'who', 'also', 'teacher', 'film', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'supposed', 'chronicle', 'author', 'personal', 'experiences', 'social', 'world', 'academics', 'Irrespective', 'similarities', 'real', 'life', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'likeable', 'characters', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Cady', 'Heron', 'previously', 'home-schooled', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'two', 'world-traveling', 'anthropologists', 'When', 'parents', 'decide', 'settle', 'down', 'Cady', 'public', 'school', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'there', 'social', 'outcasts', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Damian', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'who', 'tell', 'inner-workings', 'high', 'school', 'Cady', 'Plastics', 'group', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'compose', 'social', 'elites', 'school', 'previous', 'beneficiary', 'Plastics', 'leader', 'Regina', 'wrath', 'Janis', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'exact', 'revenge', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'eighth', 'grade.When', 'Plastics', 'Regina', 'George', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'Karen', 'Smith', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'take', 'liking', 'Cady', 'give', 'exclusive', 'invitation', 'eat', 'lunch', 'Janis', 'opportunity', 'revenge', 'plan', 'send', 'Cady', 'world', 'Plastics', 'undercover', 'agent', 'together', 'Cady', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'work', 'dig', 'up', 'dirt', 'girls', 'However', 'line', 'pretend', 'reality', 'starts', 'blur', 'Cady', 'souring', 'relationship', 'Janis', 'Cady', 'affection', 'Regina', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Aaron', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'create', 'permanent', 'chasm', 'two', 'girls', 'Throw', 'showdown', 'two', 'groups', 'math-letes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quite', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', 'Cady', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'very', 'likeable', 'person', 'intelligent', 'sweet', 'girl', 'who', 'first', 'foray', 'world', 'public', 'school', 'audience', 'ability', 'identify', 'Cady', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'groups', 'high', 'school', 'clicks', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'Meanwhile', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'rising', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'lead', 'Notebook', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'socially', 'aggressive', 'backstabbing', 'Regina', 'George.Mean', 'Girls', 'classic', 'Darwinian', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'little', 'less', 'edge', 'enjoyed', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'films', '1980', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'then', ""'ll"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'supporting', 'appearances', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A
835932,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0002IQJ8W,Busy Body,"[1, 1]","I don't go to the cinemas often, basically because I don't watch a lot of movies. However, something inspired me to see ""Mean Girls"" last year and I came away in awe of it. It was one of the funniest movies I think I've ever seen, which surprised me a bit because American humour doesn't really do much for me (being British). Come on, let's be honest, which gay guy wouldn't love this movie? It's incredibly bitchy and very sharp and witty. I adored it and could relate a lot to the way in which my school ran a few years ago. The script isn't too heavy and the entire movie clocks in at just an hour and a half so it doesn't drag for hours.Lindsay Lohan stars as Cady Heron, a 16 year old girl who has spent her entire life living in the African bush country with her zoologist parents. They move back to America and Cady has to adapt to public schooling after being privately tutored. She becomes friends with the funky Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and the 'almost too gay to function' Damian (Daniel Franzese). They are the coolest people Cady will ever meet, according to Janis herself, and the two show her around the school and fill her in on the different cultures of this cut-throat society, such as Asian Nerds, Cool Asians, Girls Who Eat Their Feelings, Burn-outs and many more! And then, there's the most savage of the bunch, The Plastics.The Plastics are the school's most fashionable and popular clique, made up of an evil trio. Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) is mean and Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) is meaner. They are two of the most self-obsessed, fake girls you will ever come across. They bow down before Evil, which takes its true form in that of Regina George (Rachel McAdams). She is the Queen Bee of the group, and asserts her power over everyone. After a chance encounter with The Plastics in the dinner hall, Cady is convinced by Janis to hang out with them and then gossip about all the sad, pathetic things they say. She reluctantly agrees, but when she unexpectedly falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) and Regina finds out, Cady finds herself at the hands of Regina's evil scheme to take her down and out, and to ruin her social future. Along with Janis and Damian, Cady also seeks to ruin Regina through a series of obstacles which Janis devises. To succeed in this, Cady has to pretend to still like Regina, and give her foot cream instead of face cream, cut holes in her sports vest, make her eat protein bars so that she gains weight instead of losing weight, and many more other nasty things. Things come to a head when Cady throws a party for a small circle of friends but doesn't invite Regina. Regina finds out and frames Cady, Karen and Gretchen for the Burn Book, a big book that Regina started filled with nasty rumours and evil lies about virtually every person in the school.The cast for this movie is amazing. The Plastics are a physically ideal, very attractive group of girls with Lindsay Lohan being the loveable addition. Jonathan Bennett is perfect as Aaron, and quite possibly the sexiest man alive. Sometimes I think I only bought this DVD so I could watch it over and over again because of him! His hair does indeed look sexy pushed back! Of course we cannot forget to mention Saturday Night Live's incredible Tina Fey who stars as Ms. Norbury. The woman also wrote the script for this film, so her talents extend far beyond just acting. Broke from a painful divorce, Ms Norbury portrays that middle-aged woman discontent with her life and trying to get by because she's a Pusher. Amy Poehler also stars as Regina's mother, who is a great comedic addition to the movie, trying to turn back life's clock and maintain cool and hip with today's crowd. Ana Gasteyer and Neil Flynn also star as Cady's parents but don't get much screen time. The extras in this film are also very important as they flesh out the school society and what it's like to be in Cady's situation.All in all, I think this is a movie that will stay with a lot of people for a very long time. I've watched it about five times since I bought it on DVD in a sale a few weeks back, and I'm still not bored of it. The humour is very fresh and will appeal to all age groups. This movie was a huge Box Office hit around the world, so is destined to become a classic in the teen movie genre. In ten years time, this film will be remembered for a lot of things, and who knows, it may just have inspire some girls to stop being mean in high school.",5,Destined To Be A Teen Movie Classic,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,4486,"['do', ""n't"", 'go', 'cinemas', 'often', 'basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'However', 'something', 'inspired', 'see', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'last', 'year', 'came', 'away', 'awe', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'surprised', 'bit', 'American', 'humour', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'being', 'British', 'Come', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'guy', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'bitchy', 'very', 'sharp', 'witty', 'adored', 'could', 'relate', 'lot', 'way', 'school', 'ran', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'script', ""n't"", 'too', 'heavy', 'entire', 'movie', 'clocks', 'just', 'hour', 'half', ""n't"", 'drag', 'hours.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Cady', 'Heron', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'living', 'African', 'bush', 'country', 'zoologist', 'parents', 'move', 'back', 'America', 'Cady', 'adapt', 'public', 'schooling', 'being', 'privately', 'tutored', 'friends', 'funky', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', ""'almost"", 'too', 'function', 'Damian', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'are', 'coolest', 'people', 'Cady', 'will', 'ever', 'meet', 'according', 'Janis', 'two', 'show', 'school', 'fill', 'different', 'cultures', 'cut-throat', 'society', 'such', 'Asian', 'Nerds', 'Cool', 'Asians', 'Girls', 'Who', 'Eat', 'Their', 'Feelings', 'Burn-outs', 'many', 'more', 'then', 'most', 'savage', 'bunch', 'Plastics.The', 'Plastics', 'are', 'school', 'most', 'fashionable', 'popular', 'clique', 'made', 'evil', 'trio', 'Karen', 'Smith', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'mean', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'meaner', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'self-obsessed', 'fake', 'girls', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'bow', 'down', 'before', 'Evil', 'true', 'form', 'Regina', 'George', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'group', 'power', 'everyone', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Plastics', 'dinner', 'hall', 'Cady', 'convinced', 'Janis', 'hang', 'out', 'then', 'gossip', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'things', 'say', 'reluctantly', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'Regina', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Aaron', 'Samuels', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'Regina', 'out', 'Cady', 'hands', 'Regina', 'evil', 'scheme', 'take', 'down', 'ruin', 'social', 'future', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'Cady', 'also', 'ruin', 'Regina', 'series', 'obstacles', 'Janis', 'succeed', 'Cady', 'pretend', 'still', 'Regina', 'give', 'foot', 'cream', 'instead', 'face', 'cream', 'cut', 'holes', 'sports', 'vest', 'make', 'eat', 'protein', 'bars', 'gains', 'weight', 'instead', 'losing', 'weight', 'many', 'more', 'other', 'nasty', 'things', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Cady', 'party', 'small', 'circle', 'friends', ""n't"", 'invite', 'Regina', 'Regina', 'out', 'frames', 'Cady', 'Karen', 'Gretchen', 'Burn', 'Book', 'big', 'book', 'Regina', 'started', 'filled', 'nasty', 'rumours', 'evil', 'lies', 'virtually', 'person', 'school.The', 'cast', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Plastics', 'are', 'physically', 'ideal', 'very', 'attractive', 'group', 'girls', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'being', 'loveable', 'addition', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'perfect', 'Aaron', 'quite', 'possibly', 'sexiest', 'man', 'alive', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'only', 'bought', 'DVD', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'hair', 'indeed', 'look', 'sexy', 'pushed', 'back', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'incredible', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'who', 'Ms.', 'Norbury', 'woman', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'film', 'talents', 'extend', 'far', 'just', 'acting', 'Broke', 'painful', 'divorce', 'Ms', 'Norbury', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'discontent', 'life', 'trying', 'get', 'Pusher', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'also', 'Regina', 'mother', 'who', 'great', 'comedic', 'addition', 'movie', 'trying', 'turn', 'back', 'life', 'clock', 'maintain', 'cool', 'hip', 'today', 'crowd', 'Ana', 'Gasteyer', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'also', 'star', 'Cady', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'extras', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'flesh', 'out', 'school', 'society', 'what', 'be', 'Cady', 'situation.All', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'lot', 'people', 'very', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'five', 'times', 'bought', 'DVD', 'sale', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'bored', 'humour', 'very', 'fresh', 'will', 'appeal', 'age', 'groups', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'Box', 'Office', 'hit', 'world', 'so', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'teen', 'movie', 'genre', 'ten', 'years', 'time', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'lot', 'things', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'inspire', 'girls', 'stop', 'being', 'mean', 'high', 'school']",N/A
835933,A2CB04XVWYDW7Q,B0002IQJ8W,Caitlin,"[4, 4]","I usually don't watch these kinds of movies at all, but knowing that Tina Fey wrote it, after reading several articles, I decided to watch the thing.  And surprise, it is hilarious, it is relevant, and I did end up buying the DVD.I'm not going to rehash the entire story after so many other people's reviews went over it, but I will discuss a few particular points.This movie has a slightly cutting edge to it that I wouldn't expect, given the genre, but many of the jokes do have that extra something to them beyond the usual ""haha omigod what a slut"" type thing.  I don't even know if last statement is understandable to anyone but myself, but I'm trying here.The cast is great.  I l-o-v-e LOVE Amy Poehler as the mom trying to hang on to her youth by vicariously living through her daughter and her friends.  For me, she provided some of the biggest laughs of the movie.  Tim Meadows, Tina Fey, etc., are also great in their various ways.And now I would like to disagree with at least one of the reviewers I have seen here.  The first time I saw this movie, I thought the ending was incredibly cheesy and trite in its search for moralization.  However, after watching it again, I decided that it was a really great message that needed to be said.  I know that it is incredibly relevent, having lived through ""girl warfare"" myself, and from what I have observed, nothing seems to be changing on that front these days.  So while the film itself isn't going to change anything, it has a good point--that things shouldn't be that way.  It's only when people really grow up, as the characters do, that they become a little more ""human"" again.So, if you like the ideas this movie puts forth, and like smarter-than-average humor, I really think you should check this out.",5,"Great cast, great message.",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,1767,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kinds', 'movies', 'knowing', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'wrote', 'reading', 'several', 'articles', 'decided', 'watch', 'thing', 'surprise', 'hilarious', 'relevant', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'DVD.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rehash', 'entire', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'went', 'will', 'discuss', 'few', 'particular', 'points.This', 'movie', 'slightly', 'cutting', 'edge', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'given', 'genre', 'many', 'jokes', 'do', 'have', 'extra', 'something', 'usual', 'haha', 'what', 'slut', 'type', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'last', 'statement', 'understandable', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'trying', 'here.The', 'cast', 'great', 'l-o-v-e', 'LOVE', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'mom', 'trying', 'hang', 'youth', 'vicariously', 'living', 'daughter', 'friends', 'provided', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'etc.', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'various', 'ways.And', 'now', 'would', 'like', 'disagree', 'least', 'one', 'reviewers', 'have', 'seen', 'here', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'trite', 'search', 'moralization', 'However', 'watching', 'again', 'decided', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'message', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'know', 'incredibly', 'relevent', 'having', 'lived', 'girl', 'warfare', 'what', 'have', 'observed', 'nothing', 'be', 'changing', 'front', 'days', 'So', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'anything', 'good', 'point', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'way', 'only', 'when', 'people', 'really', 'grow', 'up', 'characters', 'do', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'human', 'again.So', 'like', 'ideas', 'movie', 'forth', 'smarter-than-average', 'humor', 'really', 'think', 'should', 'check', 'out']",N/A

835937,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0002IQJ8W,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","This movie is based upon the book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence"" by Rosalind Wiseman, in spite of it being a non-fiction parental self-help manual with no narrative to speak of.Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) has been raised in Africa and home-schooled by her parents. She is ill prepared to adapt to the harsh environment of a Midwestern High School, but on her first day she hooks up with the school misfits, Janis Ian, a Goth, and Damian, who is 'too gay to function.' They explain the hierarchy of cafeteria cliques, and map out where each group sits:Janis: [reading list the major cliques in high school] You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, J.V. jocks, Asian nerds, Cool Asians, Varsity jocks Unfriendly black hotties, Girls who eat their feelings, Girls who don't eat anything, Desperate wannabes, Burnouts, Sexually active band geeks,[a picture of herself and Damian come on screen]Janis: the greatest people you will ever meet, and the worst. Beware of plastics.----------------------------------------Here is where the 'Queen Bees and Wannabes' come into the picture. Regina George (Rachel McAdams) is the most popular girl in school. Her name, 'Regina,' means Queen in Latin. She is also the biggest byotch you'd ever want to meet. Damien and Janice warn Cady about the dangers of the toxic Plastics:Janis: That one there, that's Karen Smith. She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet. Damien sat next to her in English last year.Damian: She asked me how to spell orange.[Cady snickers]Janis: That little one, that's Gretchen Wieners.Damian: She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudels.Janis: Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business, she knows everything about everyone.Damian: That's why her hair is so big, it's full of secrets.Janis: And evil takes a human form in Regina George. Don't be fooled because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing **** faced **-bag, but in reality, she's so much more than that.Damian: She's the queen bee - the star, those other two are just her little workers.----------------------------------------Janis has her own reasons to despise Regina, for she harbors a grudge whose source will be revealed in the fullness of time. As for Damian, this is all he can say:Damian: She's fabulous, but she's evil.----------------------------------------Taken by her fetching good looks, The Plastics decide to invite Cady to join their exalted company.----------------------------------------Regina: Why don't I know you?Cady: I'm new. I just moved here from Africa.Regina: What?Cady: I used to be home-schooled.Regina: Wait... what?Cady: My mom taught me at home...Regina: No, I know what home-school is, I'm not retarded! So you've actually never been to a real school before? Shut up! Shut up!Cady: I didn't say anything.----------------------------------------She is asked back for lunch on the morrow, and told to wear pink, because it is Wednesday. They all wear pink on Wednesday. After hearing about this unexpected turn of events, Cady and the refugees from the Island of Misfit Toys conspire to infiltrate The Plastics, and destroy them from within.But being a Plastic goes to Cady's head. It is not such a bad feeling to belong to the most exclusive clique in school. Soon she succumbs to the Plastic life style, a life of fabulous fashion, and rapier sharp wit. For dumb blondes, they can come up with quite the withering comment when called upon. Gretchen, on the other hand, is not so successful when she tries to coin her own catchphrase:Gretchen: That is so fetch!Regina: Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!----------------------------------------Poor little Gretchen keeps trying to stretch fetch into the lexicon:[repeated line]Gretchen: That was so fetch!----------------------------------------Though fetch might not ever happen, Mean Girls did happen, for Rachel McAdams, Lindsay Lohan, and for Tina Fey, who not only wrote the thing, but also acts in it as well, as a semi hip teacher with a dry ironic sense of humor. She has peppered the cast with quite the collection of SNL Alumni, such as Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Anna Gasteyer. She currently also stars in and writes for the TV sit com 30 Rock, where in quite a stretch she plays the head writer for a comedy show. Her boss is played by Alec Baldwin, and perhaps that is why Rachel McAdams was told to base her character, Regina George, on Alec's character in Glengarry Glen Ross. I can see it, Rachel, though it was dialed back a notch or two. Great acting all 'round, 'specially from Lohan and McAdams--a clash of the titans. The writing is superb. Even though it is just a High School drama, it is chock full of clever lines and put downs. It functions like a well-oiled comedy machine, with all the cylinders clicking. Tina Fey, with her thick rimmed glasses, reminds me of some teachers of my own that I used to fantasize about in class. Combine that crush on teacher appeal with the fact that she is also smart, funny, and can write, and you'll see why High School was never this good. Mean Girls transcends the genre of low High School comedy and aspires to be something more. Tina Fey has learned her lessons well, conducting comedy experiments for years in the SNL crucible, and she has crafted quite a comedy.----------------------------------------Janis: Why didn't they just keep home schooling you?Cady: They wanted me to get socialized.Damian: Oh, you'll get socialized all right, a little slice like you.Cady: What are you talking about?Janis: You're a regulation hottie.Cady: What?Damian: Own it.----------------------------------------I confess that part of the attraction is checking out Lindsay Lohan because she is such a notorious party girl. Of all her gal pals that ply that circuit, she strikes me as being one of the most talented. It would be a shame to squander all of that talent, and toss it aside for the momentary flashes of hedonistic pleasure afforded in your Hollywood clubs. I really hope that she can sort out her personal life because if she does she has a stellar career in front of her.There are quite a few good tunes in this High School drama. A few that I recognized were the following:""Milkshake""by Chad Hugo & Pharrell WilliamsPerformed by KelisA good excuse to show off dance moves. A completely moronic number, and yet it grabs you and won't let go. Everybody, dance the Macarena!""Rip Her to Shreds""by Deborah Harry & Chris SteinPerformed by BoomkatPerfect anthem for The Plastics when they are at their cattiest. ""Saucer of milk for Table Two!"" You recognize the song, but instead of Deborah Harry and Blondie, it is performed by Boomkat. Later, the Blondie theme is continued, this time with the original artist, not a cover:""One Way or Another""by Deborah Harry & Nigel HarrisonPerformed by BlondieThis is a song done oh-so well by diva Christina Aguillara. She has quite a set of pipes, and this would be a very difficult song to sing. It was written by Linda Perry, who used to sing for 4 Non-Blondes before producing and writing songs for such luminaries as Pink and Miss Christina A.""Beautiful""by Linda PerryPerformed by Daniel FranzeseWho is Daniel Franzese? He is the actor playing Damian. Though he sings well at the Talent Show, he is pelted with debris by a most unappreciative audience. Also casting pearls before swine is math enthusiast and rapper, Kevin Gnapoor.""The Mathlete Rap""Lyric by Tina FeyMusic by Gabriel ReneProduced by Gabriel RenePerformed by Rajiv SurendraHis performance is cut short by a member of the faculty once it becomes obvious that if his rap was released, it would require a parental warning sticker for explicit lyrics [thanks Tipper].Next up is Cady and the plastics lip synching to ""Jingle Bell Rock."" Though they perform the same song every year, they always win. Perhaps it is the short red skirts and synchronized dance moves that so mesmerize the crowd. The skirts for the Christmas talent show are made of plastic; the costume designer says they were made of that fabric to ""represent the Plastics"".""Jingle Bell Rock""by Joseph Beal (as Joe Beal) & James Boothe (as Jim Boothe)Performed by Gina Rene, Gabriel Rene, Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams,Lacey Chabert & Amanda Seyfried""At Seventeen""Written & Performed by Janis IanCourtesy of Columbia RecordsBy Arrangement with Sony Music Licensing and Courtesy of Rude Girl RecordsThe character of Janis Ian kind of threw me for a loop, because I wondered why they used the name of a singer that most of the target audience would never have heard of. Tina Fey, the SNL scribe who penned the script, might have been making some kind of reference to her since Janis Ian was the first musical guest to appear on Saturday Night Live way back in 1975. Janice sang her hit that addressed racial issues with regards to dating, and was kind of shocking for that time, even though the girl in the song decides that dating outside her race was not worth the hassle. Even that was too much for the general public in that bygone era. The song ""At Seventeen"" is heard during the course of the film.""Dancing with Myself""by Billy Idol & Tony JamesPerformed by The DonnasThis song sounded great, and I wondered who did it. Come to find out, it was the all female rock group The Donnas. It is an old Billy Idol song that he sang with his group Generation X. Great cover by The Donnas. I have read about The Donnas for quite some time, but never was curious enough to listen. Hearing this, I think I will check them out.There is a lot of other good music in the hip hop vein, but I will leave it to Generation Y and Z to sort that out.MEAN GIRLS IS BASED ON THE BOOK:Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescenceby Rosalind Wiseman (Paperback - Mar 4, 2003)LINDSAY LOHANGeorgia Rule (Full Screen Edition)(2007) ....

The story ripped from headlines is hilarious and wonderfully put together by SNL's Tina Fey.  Lindsay Lohan plays Cady, a 16-year-old who up until now has been homeschooled in Africa with her parents.  She must now be socialized for the first time.  She imediatly meets two school outcasts who warn her of the Plastics, teen school royalty, and once the Plastics, headed by Regina George (Rachel McAdams in yet another slam dunk performance), take a liking to Cady, Cady and her friends decide to get all the gossip they can on the Plastics, and Regina in particular, and destroy their reps with the school.  What they never banked on was Cady becoming a Plastic herself.  The movie is histerical, mostly because it's so true and shows what teenage girls can really be like.  It's funny to be able to watch the film and then look at my wife and say, ""I've heard you say that about so-and-so"" and then she laughs and says ""yeah, but you agreed""...watch this movie, it's not just teen fluff, it's actually really funny and has heart.

Maybe these movies are alright.So I rented ""Mean Girls"" not expecting too much - just a chick flick with a stupid plot. Boy, was I wrong!The film could have been bad. Worse than bad - it could have been awful. But it wasn't. It turned the other way, entering the dark world of the Plastics.Tina Fey shows an excellent grip over satire and comedy in not only her performance, but also her screenplay. I also felt it smart to utilize the talents of other SNL mates, Tim Meadows and the glorious Amy Poehler, who all seem to have excellent chemistry and add so much comedic parts to the film.Fey portrays high school life in a vicious, yet addicting, satire of the teenage years. There are parts to the film that I think everyone is able to relate to, whether you're at the butt of the joke, or you're the one divvying them out. Either way, you can't help but laugh, or say, ""That's so fetch!""And like I said, a film like this is fragile territory (especially after Lohan's poor film choices lately...), but I feel that all of the actors pulled it off so well.If you're looking for a light, hilarious satire, look no further than ""Mean Girls,"" and see what everyone's talking about...",5,I actually caved in...,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,1334,"['adamant', 'boycott', 'everyone', 'everything', 'teeny-bopper', 'aka', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'decided', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'prejudiced', 'Maybe', 'movies', 'are', 'alright.So', 'rented', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'not', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'chick', 'flick', 'stupid', 'plot', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'Worse', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'awful', 'was', ""n't"", 'turned', 'other', 'way', 'entering', 'dark', 'world', 'Plastics.Tina', 'Fey', 'excellent', 'grip', 'satire', 'comedy', 'not', 'only', 'performance', 'also', 'screenplay', 'also', 'felt', 'utilize', 'talents', 'other', 'SNL', 'mates', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'glorious', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'comedic', 'parts', 'film.Fey', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'vicious', 'yet', 'addicting', 'satire', 'teenage', 'years', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'think', 'everyone', 'able', 'relate', ""'re"", 'butt', 'joke', ""'re"", 'one', 'divvying', 'out', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'say', 'so', 'fetch', 'said', 'film', 'fragile', 'territory', 'especially', 'Lohan', 'poor', 'film', 'choices', 'lately', 'feel', 'actors', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'look', 'further', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'talking']",N/A

835948,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0002IQJ8W,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","""MEAN GIRLS"" is a 2004 film that help launch the careers of Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert but also a film that showcased the brilliance and humor of a screenplay by Tina Fey.  The film was an ultimate success debuting at #1 in the box office and having grossed over $129 million worldwide, making it into the top 25 highest grossing films of 2004.Directed by Mark Waters (""Head Over Heels"", ""Freaky Friday"", ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"") and produced by Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, the film is based on the non-fiction book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" by Rosalind Wiseman, a book with a message about high school cliques and what teenage girls have to face in this modern age but to have solutions and not re-enforcing stereotypes of what may considered to be as cool and not cool.VIDEO & AUDIO:""MEAN GIRLS"" gets its High Definition 1080p treatment with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1.  This is probably the best this film is ever going to look as it looks very colorful and vibrant.  Overall, the picture quality is quite solid.  Lohan's red hair, Chabert's tan and overall everything is just colorful and Costume Designer Mary Jane Fort did a great job in selecting clothing that would pop.  Overall, a very good transfer.As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is primarily a dialogue and music-based film, so audio is quite clear and music is quite punchy and vibrant.  ""MEAN GIRLS"" is not exactly a film to expect full on surround sound but overall, the audio is very good and clear but one thing I've noticed from the Blu-ray and the original DVD version is how alive the music comes through on High Definition.  All in all, for teen drama film, audio is benefited from its High Definition presentation.  Audio is also presented in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.Subtitles include English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features included on the ""MEAN GIRLS"" Blu-ray disc are:* Commentary: Commentary by director Mark Waters, Screenplay Writer & Actress Tina Fey and Producer Lorne Michaels - This is actually a very fun commentary as Waters and Fey have fun discussing certain areas of the film.  Lorne Michaels tends to be quiet for the most part but Waters asks Fey how she came up with several of the ideas and overall, both have fun exchanges and interesting tidbits especially when it comes to bringing starts from ""Saturday Night Live"" to the film.* Only the Strong Survive - (24:50) A featurette with interviews with the cast, Director Mark Waters and Screenwriter Tina Fey.  Overall, the main featurette with each talent talking about their characters and working with each other.* The Politics of Girl World - (10:30) An interview with Rosalind Wiseman, the author of ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" which the film is based on.  Rosalind explains about how and whys he wrote the book and how it became a film and what scenes she enjoyed from the film.* Plastic Fashion - (10:25) An important part of the film is its fashion and this featurette is an interview with Costume Designer Mary Jane Fort as she talks about swatches, designs and what she wanted to accomplish for each main character in their wardrobe.  Also, includes video test footage with the talent sporting the various wardrobe.* Word Vomit - (5:42) This segment is the gag reel featuring the main talent flubbing their lines or just having fun and having pranks on the set.* So Fetch - (7:01) Deleted Scenes with Commentary by Director Mark Waters and Screenplay Writer Tina Fey* Additional Scenes: 1) Damiam Rigs Table - deleted* Additional Scenes: 2) 112, Excellent! - deleted* Additional Scenes: 3) Mom's Underwear - deleted* Additional Scenes: 4) Shoe Shopping - extended* Additional Scenes: 5) Tonight I'll Like It - deleted* Additional Scenes: 6) Eaten by Cannibals - alternate* Additional Scenes: 7) Regina In Bed - deleted* Additional Scenes: 8) Norbury's Car Explodes - extended* Additional Scenes: 9) Cady and Regina in the Bathroom - deleted* Interstitials - (1:37) Commercials featuring Cady and also the Plastics showing off their way of living.* Frenemies* New Girl* PSA* Theatrical Trailer HD - The High Definition trailer of the film (2:33)Overall, the special features were entertaining but there is really nothing new added from the original DVD version.  Also, only the theatrical trailer gets upgraded to High Definition and everything else is standard definition (480p).JUDGMENT CALL:""MEAN GIRLS"" is the ultimate girl power movie.  The film elevated many of the stars of the film to a higher level and also a film that showcased Tina Fey's screenwriting ability which was known in ""Saturday Night Live"" but definitely a pre-cursor to bigger things for her ala ""30 Rock"".The film has a very ""Heathers"" type of vibe (coincidentally, ""Heathers"" was directed by Director Mark Waters brother Daniel) and Tina Fey's screenplay takes Rosalind Wiseman's original book but giving it humor but also in the end an important message.At the time of the release of the film, having appearances by some of the ""Saturday Night Live"" stars was cool but there was also an American interest in Lindsay Lohan who was at the time, becoming America's darling teen actress especially after the success of the film ""Freaky Friday"".  Also, for fans of the 90's television series ""Party of Five"" and watching Lacey Chabert as a child actress, ""MEAN GIRLS"" was the first film to see her now all grown up and looking fabulous.The performances were well done.  Rachel McAdams as Regina ""the Queen Bee"" was well-done and snobby while Amanda Seyfried definitely played the stereotypical dumb blonde but in this film, her character is actually quite dimwitted.  But nevertheless, ""MEAN GIRLS"" definitely propelled these two actresses for more future roles.But what made this film work was it's good balance of humor but mostly the message.  Why do the teenage girls segregate themselves to certain groups, why do the popular girls do popular things when some can actually achieve more.  Just pretty much putting the typical high school things on the table, exposing the life of teenage girls and having people learn from it and identifying what is cool and what's not cool.For parents wondering why the PG-13 rating, its mainly  because of the language and underage high school teenage partying and teens making out.  So, suffice to say, depending on that type of material will determine if you want your teens (or children) to watch it.It has been announced that ""MEAN GIRLS 2' is now currently being planned and one can hope that the level of humor and fun will crossover to the sequel.  But for this first film, the film deals with constant backstabbing and manipulation but really showing how things can easily get out of hand.Overall, ""MEAN GIRLS"" is an enjoyable teen comedy that looks and sounds great on Blu-ray!  Fans of the film will not be disappointed.",4,"Blu-ray: Better picture and audio quality but extras remain the same.

835949,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0002IQJ8W,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","This is partially a rip off of Heathers (1989) in that there are three mean girls (""The Plastics""--in Heathers they were all named ""Heather"") who control the high school social scene until along comes a new girl who changes the dynamics. In Heathers, a kind of darker comedy with some uneasy belly laughs, Winona Ryder is the new girl. Here we have perky Lindsay Lohan starring as Cady Heron, a previously home-schooled girl whose parents decide she might need some socializing American-style before embarking on college. Lohan is wholesome and cute, and does a fine job of getting us to identify with her character.Rachel McAdams (ten years older than 17-year-old Lohan, by the way) plays Regina George, the leader of the plastic pack. She is voluptuous, spoiled, vain, and as mean behind her smile as a junkyard dog. She gives perhaps the best performance. The other two girls are Lacy Chabert as Gretchen Wieners and Amanda Seyfried as Karen Smith, who tends to play dumb. Lizzy Caplan is noticeable as the goth girl who, along with her sidekick Damien played by Daniel Franzese, attempt to thwart the power of the plastics.  The teen heartthrob is Jonathan Bennett playing Aaron Samuels.The screenplay is by comedy writer Tina Fey who also plays teacher Ms. Norbury. She adapted the script from the nonfiction book, Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence by Rosalind Wiseman. What I think happened (since the book was hardly needed as a starting point for Fey) is that the producers credited Wiseman with some inspiration to detract from the fact that the premise and some of the treatment are taken directly from Heathers. Oh, well, in Hollywood whatever works once will surely return in some kind of sequel or remake or as cinematic plagiarism--if such a thing exists.Note well the PG-13 rating here. The ""f"" word is phased out and replaced with some clever euphemisms (and that is good since the ""f"" word really needs a long Hollywood rest) and (I understand) some of the raunchier jokes were cut.This may be a little too simplistic for some high school students and a bit too familiar for experienced movie goers, but a good fit for a thirtysomething mother to watch with her teenaged daughter and share some laughs since the social dynamics haven't changed much over the years.",4,Familiar but with some good laughs,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2365,"['partially', 'rip', 'Heathers', '1989', 'are', 'three', 'mean', 'girls', 'Plastics', 'Heathers', 'were', 'named', 'Heather', 'who', 'control', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'scene', 'new', 'girl', 'who', 'dynamics', 'Heathers', 'kind', 'darker', 'comedy', 'uneasy', 'belly', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'new', 'girl', 'Here', 'have', 'perky', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'starring', 'Cady', 'Heron', 'previously', 'home-schooled', 'girl', 'parents', 'decide', 'might', 'need', 'socializing', 'American-style', 'embarking', 'college', 'Lohan', 'wholesome', 'cute', 'fine', 'job', 'getting', 'identify', 'character.Rachel', 'McAdams', 'ten', 'years', 'older', '17-year-old', 'Lohan', 'way', 'Regina', 'George', 'leader', 'plastic', 'pack', 'voluptuous', 'spoiled', 'vain', 'mean', 'smile', 'junkyard', 'dog', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'other', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'Lacy', 'Chabert', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Karen', 'Smith', 'who', 'play', 'dumb', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'noticeable', 'goth', 'girl', 'who', 'sidekick', 'Damien', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'power', 'plastics', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'playing', 'Aaron', 'Samuels.The', 'screenplay', 'comedy', 'writer', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'who', 'also', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Norbury', 'adapted', 'script', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'Queen', 'Bees', 'Wannabes', 'Helping', 'Daughter', 'Survive', 'Cliques', 'Gossip', 'Boyfriends', 'Other', 'Realities', 'Adolescence', 'Rosalind', 'Wiseman', 'What', 'think', 'happened', 'book', 'was', 'hardly', 'needed', 'starting', 'point', 'Fey', 'producers', 'credited', 'Wiseman', 'inspiration', 'detract', 'fact', 'premise', 'treatment', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'Heathers', 'Oh', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'once', 'will', 'surely', 'return', 'kind', 'sequel', 'remake', 'cinematic', 'plagiarism', 'thing', 'exists.Note', 'well', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'here', 'f', 'word', 'phased', 'out', 'replaced', 'clever', 'euphemisms', 'good', 'f', 'word', 'really', 'long', 'Hollywood', 'rest', 'understand', 'raunchier', 'jokes', 'were', 'cut.This', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'simplistic', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'bit', 'too', 'familiar', 'experienced', 'movie', 'goers', 'good', 'fit', 'thirtysomething', 'mother', 'watch', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'share', 'laughs', 'social', 'dynamics', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'years']",N/A

Regina is prissy, snobbish, arrogant, manipulative and narcissistic.  Regina is actually a very atypical character for McAdams, but she pulls it off nicely.  There's a reason she is one of my favorite actresses!Long before her wonderful caricatures of goofballs like Sarah Palin, Tina Fey was already demonstrating her comic genius in projects such as this & SNL.  She is both beautiful & funny without trying hard to be either.  In addition to acting in the film, she also wrote it as well.After watching the DVD, I found myself saddened by all of the recent legal & personal turmoil that LiLo has found herself in.  Granted, she must ultimately take responsibility for her own actions, but her attention mongering parents & the people who continually give her bad advice are not exactly an asset.The thing is, Lindsay has (had?) a natural on-screen charm that is impossible to miss.  Whether she will ever truly make the transition from child star to grown-up star (adult film star brings to mind porn, so I'm hesitant to use that phrase) remains to be seen.  In either case, however, she actually is a talented thespian.If you're longing for a nostalgic look back at all of the superficial cliques of girls in HS, then look no further than this movie.  It encapsulates all of the phony silliness of ""plastic"" girls in every HS.

Luckily, I decided to go with what I did remember and I bought this movie.  It's so funny!  And so typical, actually.  Tina Fey did an excellent job writing this movie.  There were parts of this movie that were so familiar, as I had once apparently been a ""Mean Girl"" when I was in high school.  The cafeteria scene where ""The Plastics"" went over their rules for sitting at that lunch table with Cady had to have seemed a little far fetched to some.  But I will say that I had a similar conversation with a new girl who was thinking of sitting at our lunch table in high school.  It wasn't exact, and it wasn't quite as crazy (would it have been as funny if it hadn't been?) but it was mean and having since matured, I actually feel badly about it to this day!  Being a Mean Girl then has made me a much nicer girl now and I recommend this movie to any teenage or middle-aged girl.  There's something to be learned here whether or not you were, or are currently, a Mean Girl.While I have to say my favorite scenes involve Karen, the ""dumb"" member of the Plastics, the whole movie is great and all in all, if you're not overly serious/uptight, you should find this to be entertaining.

When I did eventually see this movie, however, I laughed myself silly. I was so surprised. I suppose that it just goes to show you don't just a book(or movie in this case) by it's cover(or it's trailer!). I had taken it for nothing more than a silly, worthless teen movie.Oh my, was I wrong.Little did I know that this movie was written by the hilarious Tina Fey(who stars alongside Ms. Lohan), and has a great script. There are some hysterical jokes, one-liners and gags in this movie. It also stars a few of your current and former Saturday Night Live favorites such as Amy Poehler, Tim Meadows, and Ana Gasteyer.Without these actors and their expertise in comedic acting, as well as Tina's hysterical script, this movie would have never made it.The comedy is silly, but for the most part is smart and well thought-out. It is over the top at times, but neverthless hilarious.It follows Cady Heron(Lohan), who is a new student a school with a serious clique problem. Cady has no idea about any of this seeing as how she's lived most of her life in Africa away from the hustle and bustle of your typical upper middle-class American high school. Then of course, it's all about her experience with ""The Plastics,"" the most popular and meanest girls in the school(played by Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried).As I said before, the acting is what makes it. Amy Poehler is HYSTERICAL as Regina George's mother, and Tim Meadows is equally as funny as the principal of the school. Lacey Chabert really surprised me, as she too was hilarious as Plastic Gretchen Weiners, and I remember Lacey from the sappy Party of Five back in the 90's. Everyone plays their parts well and all of the actors do such great work with their respective characters.All in all, two thumbs up.

From Buffy to Veronica Mars to Freaks and Geeks to Mean Girls - the pain and the humiliation is all there to relive, less painfully and more comically this time around.Tina Fey's script does cover the basics of the information found in Rosalind Wiseman's Queen Bees and Wannabees, though it doesn't really  explain how these personalities emerge.  And, of course this is a story, instead of nonfiction, so it has have a beginning and an end and a resolution, which most of these situations frankly do not, unless that resolution is therapy years down the road.Still, it's very enjoyable to watch Cady (Lohan) go from being a nice girl with a generous heart to a social piranha within a very short time after her submersion into a contemporary high school situation.  And Rachel McAdams as Regina George (""Queen"" George) is a good foil and totally believable as the Queen Bee.  It's hard to believe this is the same actress who starred in Red Eye.

You'd probably raise an eyebrow and wonder where the similarity lies but then Mean Girls truly deserve all the attention one can extend towards it. Let me start again.I am a 21 year old male and I'm sorry if I'm not pretentious enough to dislike this film and ignore it because it is a chick's flick. I think there's more reason for a guy to watch this film than one. One,Lohan is hot. I couldnt stop my eyes from totally examining her in every scene of the film.There are some really funny things  you will defintiely get a hint on. It does let me in how some girls think. It reminds me of my high school life and all those things that I took so seriously. Those artificial bubble filled days seem so criminally fake and unimportant now.Lindsay Lohan plays the life of a sixteen year old girl who's just got back from Africa. She is a little overprotected since she's never been thru any schooling whatsoever. What is comical about the film is how very smoothly the various characters are run through with. There is not one character in the film that was left out or unexplained. Lohan decides to be with the cool mean girls of the school. In her attempt to get to this stage,she runs into many troubles of her own and somehow manages to become famous soon. Kill me for making it sound half interesting but it really is not the kind of movie one would write a review about. So I'll just tell you about it. I laughed out 8 times in this film.I must add that the role of Regina George played by Rachel McAdams was the major reason for me liking this film. Rachel M. is devastatingly good in the film. She played her role only better than what Lohan did. Believe me, both the girls managed to totally convince me they were the characters.There's one scene in the film where Regina screams after finding out she has been having fat containing chocolates. It is by far the funniest scene in ""mean girls"" I will always recall this scene for this film.I will watch the film in a few months from now. I didnt pause the film for one second and watched it in one go. The DVD quality is superb but then that's what we expect from most or all films in 2004.

But what I found so interesting was the closeness in topic between the two movies. It made me ponder why Mean Girls succeeded while Confessions failed.First, Mean Girls has a funny, smart, crisp script due to Tina Fey. I don't watch Saturday Night Live, so I don't know how funny she is, but she sure wrote a gem here.Second, Lohan has a worthy adversary in Rachel McAdams (Regina). McAdams is a genuinely good actress as opposed to the broad in Confessions whose name I don't know and don't really care to know. By Rachel McAdams' roles in Red Eye, The Notebook, Wedding Crashers, and the Family Stone, she is certainly an actress to be on the watch for. I predict she will win an Oscar eventually.Third, Lohan doesn't have to carry the movie on her own. She has legitimate talent around her. I am not expert enough to truly gauge Lohan's talent; therefore I don't know if she would have the acting chops to be a profound leading actress or if she will forever live in mediocre teenage/romantic comedy hell.Anyway, the girl who plays Janis Ian and the guy who plays Damian are great as supporting cast to Lindsay.Mean Girls isn't some dumb movie that aspires to mediocrity just because it's catered to teenagers. It's smart.P.S. The guy who plays Kevin Gnapoor is hilarious!

""And that,"" Cady says as the narrator of the story, ""is how Regina died. Just kidding!""This is a defining moment in the movie. Not just in the plot line but in the biting satire of Tina Fey, who is by far the true star of this movie. The acting was superb, featuring three Saturday Night Live alumni. But what's even better than the acting is the script. ""It's like I have ESPN or something,"" one of the plastics tells Cady, ""it's like my breasts can tell when it's going to rain. Well at least they can kind of tell when it's raining.""The story is about a 16 year old girl named Cady who was homeschooled in Africa and she comes to this big high school and doesn't fit in at all. She soon find friends in two of the outcasts at school, but also finds out that she's accepted by the school's most exclusive clique, the Plastics. Well, one of Cady's friends tells her that she needs to go under cover to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them.Unwillingly she takes the challenge and goes into their world. She does everything with them, even finds out about a secret Burn Book that lists bad things, true and false about everyone in the school. Unfortunately, she gets in too deep with the Plastics, and launches her own offensive on the Plastics head girl Regina. She soon becomes the leader of the Plastics, but eventually Regina learns the truth about why Cady joined the Plastics in the first place.For her counter-offensive Regina takes the burn book to the principle of the school and spreads copies of it's contents all over the school causing a massive riot.A lot of things happn in between which are absolutely hilarious. I think anyone who likes funny movies should definitely check this one out, and this will easily set up Tina Fey as a Hollywood writer. Also be sure to keep an eye on Lindsey Lohan I have a feeling we'll be seeing her around for a while now.Oh yeah, by the way the girl with ESPN that I mentioned earlier went on to be a weather reporter. We see her in the down pouring rain doing a weather report.

The movie shows in a very believable way how a girl ""unspoiled"" by years of homeschooling in Africa, gets sucked into the world of fashion, fakery and high school popularity politics.The ""outsiders"" who first befriend her aren't the heros like you might expect, they too are flawed ""real"" people.  This would be a terrific movie to watch with your teens and/or tweens, especially girls, and discuss things like cliques, real friendship and more.The popular girl's mother is a ""best friend"" ""cool mom"", and her lack of discipline has created a familiar monster.  The popular girl's first side kick is a complex mix of over-confident and insecure, needing to have someone to follow, even if that someone makes her miserable.I highly recommend this movie both for fun and for starting discussions.

She's lived most of her life in Africa, being home-schooled by her scientist parents. She's seen nature at its worst, but nothing could prepare her for the world of cliques. She stumbles wide-eyed through her first day until she is befriended by two outsiders, a Goth chick named Janis and a gay boy named Damian. They warn her against the evils of the Plastics, the group of pretty but vicious popular girls.However, Cady's good looks quickly attract the attention of the Plastics and they decide to include her in their group. Cady is uncertain that she wants to be a part of their inner circle, but Janis convinces her that they can destroy them from the inside if Cady infiltrates their world.But as we all know, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and soon Cady finds herself no longer pretending--she is becoming one of the Plastics. She doesn't want to give up her newfound popularity and power, but can she keep it without hurting everyone she cares about?I had heard great things about this movie, but not being the biggest Lindsay Lohan fan, I went into it with low expectations--and found myself blown away. This is not just another teen movie. The script, written by Tina Fey and inspired by the book Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence (that's some title!) by Rosalind Wiseman, is surprisingly sharp and witty. Or maybe not so surprising when you remember that Tina Fey is Saturday Night Live's first female head writer ever. Nothing about this movie is dumbed-down and for a movie set in high-school, there are shockingly few caricatures. Most of the main characters are realistic and well-rounded. We've all known people exactly like those we see on screen. Lindsay Lohan plays her part convincingly, and Tina Fey shines as her math teacher. Various other SNL performers appear in the movie, the best being Tim Meadows as the school principal. Of the kids, Lacey Chabert (the voice of Meg on Family Guy) is amazing. She plays Gretchen Weiners, one of the Plastics, perfectly and with incredible depth.The sole gay character, Damian, played wonderfully by Daniel Franzese, was especially refreshing since he was so completely realistic. He embodied gay characteristics without becoming a stereotype, and delivered some of the movie's best zingers effortlessly while doing it. The scene at the school talent show where he sings Christina's ""Beautiful"" is, well, beautiful.My only complaint is that the ending is a little too neat and tidy, but it does leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.

With all the teen angst and humor in this movie, it was like a blast from the past. Kady Harrington (that's pronounced like Katy, NOT Caddy!) is a sweet teen who's been homeschooled her whole life in Africa, until her zoologist parents are moved to the US and naive Kady is shoved into the cruel society of highschool. She's disillusioned pretty fast, as a complete stranger deliberately bumps into her, a girl threatens to kick her butt, and teachers yell at her for seemingly harmless things all in her first day. Pretty soon, though, things look up when she's befriended by the punkish Janis and the very gay Damian, two hilarious companions who attempt to teach her about the dangers and benefits of highschool life. One of the biggest dangers, they warn her, lies in the fashionable clique of the Plastics, a group of popular but nasty girls led by socialite Regina George. When Regina's queenly eye falls on Kady and she invites her to join their group, Kady agrees after Janis encourages her to act as spy and  begins to guiltily enjoy the attention it wins her. Things take a drastic turn, however, when Kady innocently falls for Erin, Regina's ex-boyfriend. When Regina finds out about the attraction, she takes Erin back (after promising to set him up with Kady), and Kady and her true friends decide to dethrone the Queen Bee once and for all. What ensues is a hilarious underhanded girl-war which kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Rarely have I seen teenage plights portrayed in such a refreshingly accurate way; it brought back fond and bittersweet memories of my own teenhood.

Perhaps it just didn't live up to the hype that surrounded it for me, but there is something missing here.Perhaps it is the fact that the ending is just completely unbelieveable.  I won't ruin it for anyone, but let's just say that the happy ending is impossible.  I don't see a compromise like that ever happening anywhere.  The girls are pegged pretty good throughout the movie, but, in the end, they become too unbelievable.Oh, and for those folks who try to couple this flick with movies like ""Heathers,"" what movie were you watching?  ""Heathers"" is funny in a dark, cruel way.  The entire film is dark and mean.  ""Mean Girls"" is not even in the same ballpark as ""Heathers.""I did enjoy the idea of having the students act like beasts in the jungle, but that concept tires after awhile in this flick. What bothered me the most was the excess of SNL castmembers in this movie.  For one thing, SNL ain't what it used to be.  The show's cast has a reputation for sticking each other in their films.  That's not a bad thing, but when you aren't that funny in the first place, maybe you need to back off of the film career.  I'll agree that Tina Fey is a smart and funny writer, but she might want to stick with the ""Weekend News"" on SNL a little bit longer before trying to write another screenplay.  Tim Meadows does a pretty good job as the principal, and I'll agree with another reviewer that Ana Gasteyer is wasted in this flick.  She deserved a better role.Lindsay Lohan and Lacie Chabert do a good job in this film.  They were the best characters out of the lot.  I honestly think that Chabert has a better chance than any of the other young stars to make an impact in the future.  She doesn't seem to be relying on her looks or the paparazzi to make her a star.Recommended to those who like light teeny-boppers comedies.

All four of these films offer a darkly satirical perspective of high school and popularity, but, while Heathers and Election follow things through to the bitter end, Mean Girls, like Jawbreaker, loses its comic momentum before the closing credits roll. In this case, the ending is more sappy than happy and gives us the sense that the screenplay betrays its origins in order to avoid an unsettling denouement. As a result, Mean Girls works for its first three-quarters, then implodes as it approaches the finish line.I would have liked Mean Girls more if it had followed the Heathers/Election mold and not gone into compromise mode during the final fifteen minutes. Somewhere in the closing half-hour, Mean Girls gives up on being a comedy and decides to morph into a traditional teen movie, complete with a moral about the value of true friendship and the need to be oneself.

The nonstop jokes are hilariously rewarding as they exaggerate adolescent vanity and satirize political correctness issues like race, class, and homosexuality. Here, the Plastics are the most popular girls in school. They wrote the rule book on Girl World, like always wearing pink on Tuesdays. And they're mean. So when pretty new girl Cady (Lindsay Lohan) arrives in school, the first thing they do is make fun of her. Then they try to win her over. Cady is torn between social cliques. She befriends the punky rebels Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese). But the guy Cady wants to date is friends with the Plastics--Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and Karen (Amanda Seyfriend)--so she has to be resourceful. Problem is, the two groups hate each other. Just trying to fit in, Cady jumps through hoops for the Plastics and becomes a mean girl in the process. Though her transformation is radical, when the final act of meanness is done, she learns a few valuable lessons.SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE writer Tina Fey contributes the script and also stars as a teacher, quietly smirking at her own jokes throughout the antics. Directed by FREAKY FRIDAY's Mark Waters, MEAN GIRLS doesn't miss a beat, following the faithful formula of teen fare such as SIXTEEN CANDLES and HEATHERS.

836025,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0002IQJ8W,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","""Mean Girls"" is an entertaining look at this year's version of a High School Caste system.  It's not nearly as black as a comedy as ""Heathers"", but it isn't difficult to see why so many reviewers are comparing the two.  Both feature a small group of pretty girls who desperately protect their popularity status at school.  ""Mean Girls"" does a better job of portraying the herd mentality that allows such a small group of mean, shallow individuals to nonetheless serve as role models for those less beautiful and popular.  Escalating practical jokes and back-stabbing is the norm within this culture.Lindsay Lohan gives a thoughtful performance as Cady, the ""new girl"".  Cady isn't just moving in from another school - she's in fact going to organized school for the first time as she has been with her parents in Africa her entire life following her mother the anthropologist.  Mom is offered tenured professorship at a University - Cady gets to go to American High School for the first time.  There are a few ""fish out of water"" jokes, but we get to see the beginnings of the socialization of Cady.  She's an outsider so the school outsiders befriend her first.  She's smart so the school geeks want her on their team.  She's also pretty enough that she is invited to join the Plastics - the pretty girls who dominate the school's social scene, led by Queen Bee Regina.  Everyone at the school knows that Regina is mean, and we see by the end that everyone at the school has been targeted by Regina at some time or other.  Yet the desire to emulate Regina is so great that when her shirt is cut up as a practical joke, the next day every girl in school is wearing a shirt cut up just like Regina's.The ending resolves things a little too unrealistically - the school changes overnight from a collection of back-stabbing cliques into high school Utopia.  But it's entertaining to see how things get there.Saturday Night Live Member Tina Fey wrote the screenplay and is cast as a teacher who seems one of the most realistic ones since ""Stand and Deliver"".  She's smart and wants her students to be educated, but she also recognizes the social obligations of her students.  She put her husband through law school only to have him divorce her, and she's trying to find her way through life as well.  Tim Meadows steals all of his scenes as the school principal.  His comic timing is great in a scene where he wants to come down hard on the girls and their practical jokes, but he is limited by school rules and regulations.  He threatens to cancel the Spring Dance.... but acknowledges that he won't because they've already paid the DJ.  He threatens to hold the girls there in assembly until confessions for the wrongdoing come forth, overnight if he has to!  Then he's reminded that he can't hold them beyond 4 o'clock.The movie is full of small touches like that that brought a smile to my face while watching an otherwise pretty standard story of high schoolers.",4,A Review for Adults,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,2963,"['Mean', 'Girls', 'entertaining', 'look', 'year', 'version', 'High', 'School', 'Caste', 'system', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'black', 'comedy', 'Heathers', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'comparing', 'two', 'feature', 'small', 'group', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'desperately', 'protect', 'popularity', 'status', 'school', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'herd', 'mentality', 'small', 'group', 'mean', 'shallow', 'individuals', 'nonetheless', 'serve', 'role', 'models', 'less', 'beautiful', 'popular', 'Escalating', 'practical', 'jokes', 'back-stabbing', 'norm', 'culture.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'Cady', 'new', 'girl', 'Cady', ""n't"", 'just', 'moving', 'school', 'fact', 'going', 'organized', 'school', 'first', 'time', 'been', 'parents', 'Africa', 'entire', 'life', 'following', 'mother', 'anthropologist', 'Mom', 'offered', 'tenured', 'professorship', 'University', 'Cady', 'go', 'American', 'High', 'School', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'fish', 'water', 'jokes', 'get', 'see', 'beginnings', 'socialization', 'Cady', 'outsider', 'school', 'outsiders', 'befriend', 'first', 'smart', 'school', 'geeks', 'want', 'team', 'also', 'pretty', 'enough', 'invited', 'join', 'Plastics', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'dominate', 'school', 'social', 'scene', 'led', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'Regina', 'Everyone', 'school', 'Regina', 'mean', 'see', 'end', 'everyone', 'school', 'been', 'targeted', 'Regina', 'time', 'other', 'desire', 'emulate', 'Regina', 'so', 'great', 'when', 'shirt', 'cut', 'up', 'practical', 'joke', 'next', 'day', 'girl', 'school', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'cut', 'up', 'just', ""Regina's.The"", 'ending', 'resolves', 'things', 'little', 'too', 'unrealistically', 'school', 'changes', 'overnight', 'collection', 'back-stabbing', 'cliques', 'high', 'school', 'Utopia', 'entertaining', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'get', 'there.Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Member', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'cast', 'teacher', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'ones', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'smart', 'students', 'be', 'educated', 'also', 'social', 'obligations', 'students', 'put', 'husband', 'law', 'school', 'only', 'have', 'divorce', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'scenes', 'school', 'principal', 'comic', 'timing', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'come', 'down', 'hard', 'girls', 'practical', 'jokes', 'limited', 'school', 'rules', 'regulations', 'cancel', 'Spring', 'Dance', 'wo', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'already', 'paid', 'DJ', 'hold', 'girls', 'there', 'assembly', 'confessions', 'wrongdoing', 'come', 'forth', 'overnight', 'Then', 'reminded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', '4', ""o'clock.The"", 'movie', 'full', 'small', 'touches', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'standard', 'story', 'high', 'schoolers']",N/A

Although I was slightly like the main character played by Lindsay Lohan, and had lunch in the toilets. But lets not get into that!I absolutely adored this movie! Lindsay Lohan is really coming into her own as an actress, although she's 'grown' up a little bit since her Freaky Friday role. I've got 'pink' decorations in my room, taken from a video store, so it gives my room a slightly girly feel. I put my foot down at the pink box for the DVD though! I'll stick to the one it came with!You'll probably recognise a lot of this movie. The bit that struck me the most familiar was The Plastics. The Pink Ladies anybody? Heathers? Oh come on! Everybody had their little cliques at school (hands up if you were in a clique all of your own, which nobody wanted to join) and if you were in one, you were automatically considered cool. I love this kinda movies, because I identify with the characters, through what I experienced at high school. There wasn't one single character I identified with the most in this movie, as even the 'outcasts' of the movie, Damian & Janis (Lizzy Caplan, who looks a great deal like Ione Skye and/or Fairuza Balk), have each other.If you're not American (that'll be me then), and have never heard of SNL of the fact that Tina Fey is one of the head writers, then most of this movie will make sense, but won't hit you on that level. Frankly, I've never heard of SNL.The Plastics are a bunch of spoilt, super cool, super gorgeous girls, who have all their own rules, such as wearing pink on such and such a day, only wearing jeans on Fridays, and only wearing their hair in a ponytail once a week. Of course. They're run by the evil Regina, who has an embarrassing mother, who's trying her hardest to stay young, cool & hip, and be friends with her daughter. Gretchen is to the Plastics what Shannen Doherty was to the Heathers. The 'dumb blonde' stereotype (and I mean really dumb) is Karen funnily enough. And you've got many other characters that you'll recognise from your school.The extras on this DVD actually look really cool. (Says she who's only watched the trailer so far) There are: commentary by director Mark S. Waters, screenwriter & actress Tina Fey and producer Lorne Michaels; featurettes: ""Only The Strong Survivor"", ""The Politics of Girl World"", & ""Plastic Fashion""; blooper reel; ""So Fetch"" - deleted scenes with commentary by director Mark S.

Fortunately, Tina Fey's wit and incisive knowledge of her subject matter makes MEAN GIRLS nonetheless a pretty entertaining and at times brilliantly funny film.Lindsay Lohan proves again her talent in playing a real teenager, and she shines in her duplicitous role, although her speech at the Spring Fling seems a little forced and a little hard to believe.  Rachel MacAdams is perfect as Queen Bee Regina, as are the other girls who play the Plastics.  Ditto to Janis Ian and Damien, the other end of the spectrum.  Tim Meadows is great as the principal and Tina Fey herself does a good job as the math teacher.  One of the funniest sequences involves Lohan's father (excellently played by Neil Flynn) who upon finding she is failing calculus, he asks ""What is that thing parents do?..Oh Yes, I'm going to ground you.""  But then he lets her go to a math competition, and asks his wife, ""Is not going out part of grounding.""Smart and sassy and well done.",4,BEST TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF HOME SCHOOLING,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,1124,"['MEAN', 'GIRLS', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'really', 'new', 'subject', 'matter', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'done', 'films', 'ranging', 'horrific', 'CARRIE', 'HEATHERS', 'JAWBREAKER', 'Fortunately', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'wit', 'incisive', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'matter', 'MEAN', 'GIRLS', 'nonetheless', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'times', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'film.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'again', 'talent', 'playing', 'real', 'teenager', 'duplicitous', 'role', 'speech', 'Spring', 'Fling', 'little', 'forced', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'Rachel', 'MacAdams', 'perfect', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'Regina', 'are', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'Plastics', 'Ditto', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Damien', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'great', 'principal', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'good', 'job', 'math', 'teacher', 'One', 'funniest', 'sequences', 'Lohan', 'father', 'excellently', 'played', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'who', 'finding', 'failing', 'calculus', 'What', 'thing', 'parents', 'do', '..Oh', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'going', 'ground', 'then', 'go', 'math', 'competition', 'wife', 'not', 'going', 'part', 'grounding', 'Smart', 'sassy', 'well', 'done']",N/A
836033,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002IQJ8W,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 4]","Mean Girls generated a lot of buzz when it first came out, but as you might have guessed, I'm not a Mean Girl, so I gave it a pass.  Eventually, my wife put it to the top of our Netflix queue and I got my chance to watch a movie without a theater full of teenagers.  I was curious if Tina Fey has the writing chops to pull off 30 Rock.The answer is a resounding yes.There's a sad irony in the portrayal of the protagonist, Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan. Lohan's Hollywood personality is far more like the Mean Queen Bee antagonist (Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams) these days. Fortunately, this movie was filmed when Lohan was on the verge of stardom and transitioning from cute Mousketeer to party bombshell.  In that regard, Mean Girls is both a coming of age film and a scorching attack on the backstabbing culture of teenage girls.To whit, Cady has returned to the U.S. after being home schooled in Africa.  She skipped the entire maturation process that girls go through.  This is a blessing in that Cady is completely unaware of her growing feminine presence and a curse, because she has no idea how to survive the social rigors of high school.  Cady also happens to be SMOKING HOT, an attribute everyone was presumably too polite to point out while she was being home schooled.Cady ends up making friends with two kids that gently transition her into high school life: artsy Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and ""almost too gay to function"" Damian (Daniel Franzese). The two provide a comedic duet of biting commentary on high school politics and perpetrate all manner of pranks to get back at their archenemies, the Plastics.  The Plastics are an unholy triumvirate consisting of aforementioned Regina, fawning Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and dumb as rocks Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). Janis and Damian hatch the perfect plan: use Cady to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them from within.The problem is that's exactly what happens to Cady.  When she finally manages to oust Regina, Cady discovers she's become the person she supposedly hates.  Drama, tears, and a struggle over a cute boy (Aaron Samuels, played by Jonathan Bennett) ensue.What separates this movie from all the other teen movies out there is the persistent humor of Tina Fey's script.  This is a movie taking a serious look at what makes girls hate each other, and when the teachers get involved they actually try to do something about it using psychological techniques.  In other words, the adults aren't all complete morons. Even the ""bad guys"" are more than one-dimensional ciphers.The movie is peppered with lessons about trust between friends, learning to like yourself, and accepting people for who they are. All of this is done with humor and the surprising aplomb of a very mature cast that never dumbs down the script...except for Karen, a character almost ""too dumb to function.""The extras on the DVD really make Mean Girls shine, especially an interview with the original author of Queen Bees and Wannabes, Rosalind Wiseman.  The extras elevate Mean Girls from teen comedy to smart social commentary.  It's worth viewing for anyone who has a teen girl...or is one.",5,Hell Hath No Wrath...,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3168,"['Mean', 'Girls', 'generated', 'lot', 'buzz', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', ""'m"", 'not', 'Mean', 'Girl', 'gave', 'pass', 'Eventually', 'wife', 'put', 'top', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'theater', 'full', 'teenagers', 'was', 'curious', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'writing', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', '30', 'Rock.The', 'answer', 'resounding', 'yes.There', 'sad', 'irony', 'portrayal', 'protagonist', 'Cady', 'Heron', 'played', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Lohan', 'Hollywood', 'personality', 'far', 'more', 'Mean', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'antagonist', 'Regina', 'George', 'played', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'days', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'when', 'Lohan', 'was', 'verge', 'stardom', 'transitioning', 'cute', 'Mousketeer', 'party', 'bombshell', 'regard', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'scorching', 'attack', 'backstabbing', 'culture', 'teenage', 'girls.To', 'whit', 'Cady', 'returned', 'U.S.', 'being', 'home', 'schooled', 'Africa', 'skipped', 'entire', 'maturation', 'process', 'girls', 'go', 'blessing', 'Cady', 'completely', 'unaware', 'growing', 'feminine', 'presence', 'curse', 'idea', 'how', 'survive', 'social', 'rigors', 'high', 'school', 'Cady', 'also', 'be', 'SMOKING', 'HOT', 'attribute', 'everyone', 'was', 'presumably', 'too', 'polite', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'home', 'schooled.Cady', 'up', 'making', 'friends', 'two', 'kids', 'gently', 'transition', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'artsy', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'almost', 'too', 'gay', 'function', 'Damian', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'two', 'provide', 'comedic', 'duet', 'biting', 'commentary', 'high', 'school', 'politics', 'perpetrate', 'manner', 'pranks', 'get', 'back', 'archenemies', 'Plastics', 'Plastics', 'are', 'unholy', 'triumvirate', 'consisting', 'aforementioned', 'Regina', 'fawning', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'dumb', 'rocks', 'Karen', 'Smith', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'hatch', 'perfect', 'plan', 'use', 'Cady', 'infiltrate', 'Plastics', 'destroy', 'within.The', 'problem', 'exactly', 'what', 'Cady', 'When', 'finally', 'oust', 'Regina', 'Cady', 'become', 'person', 'supposedly', 'Drama', 'tears', 'struggle', 'cute', 'boy', 'Aaron', 'Samuels', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'movie', 'other', 'teen', 'movies', 'persistent', 'humor', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'script', 'movie', 'taking', 'serious', 'look', 'what', 'girls', 'hate', 'other', 'when', 'teachers', 'get', 'involved', 'actually', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'using', 'psychological', 'techniques', 'other', 'words', 'adults', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'complete', 'morons', 'Even', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'ciphers.The', 'movie', 'peppered', 'lessons', 'trust', 'friends', 'learning', 'like', 'accepting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'done', 'humor', 'surprising', 'aplomb', 'very', 'mature', 'cast', 'never', 'dumbs', 'down', 'script', 'Karen', 'character', 'almost', 'too', 'dumb', 'function', 'extras', 'DVD', 'really', 'make', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'shine', 'especially', 'interview', 'original', 'author', 'Queen', 'Bees', 'Wannabes', 'Rosalind', 'Wiseman', 'extras', 'elevate', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'teen', 'comedy', 'smart', 'social', 'commentary', 'worth', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'teen', 'girl', 'one']",N/A
836034,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0002IQJ8W,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","This movie is and isn't an SNL movie.  It has a cast of many SNL cast members, and of course was written by Tina Fey and produced by Lorne Michaels.  The main cast however had no ties to SNL whatsoever which I think helped it because many of the movies that have been made over the years (aside from the original Blues Brothers) which had a lot of SNL cast members or were based on SNL skits are horrible.This is a movie about high school cliques and how kids treat each other, specifically focused on girls.  It is really a movie however that anyone can relate to, and is one of those high school movies that (aside from the music and some of the cultural references) has themes that are just as relevant now 10 years removed from when it was made and will be true in another 10 years.  It is also a brainy, witty comedy that does not rely just on gross, stupid humor.  It was a movie that would have launched Lindsay Lohan into superstardom if she had kept her nose clean.  She was definitely the star, and centerpiece of the movie, but the entire &#34;main&#34; cast was comprised of young stars that have gone on to varying levels of fame, with Amanda Seyfried and Lizzy Caplan probably being the most well known.Ultimately it is a funny, well acted movie with a good message.  It is not one where just from a preview you would think it is as good as it is, but it's worth taking a chance on if you are on the fence.  For those who get the actual DVD, the special edition DVD has about 45min of behind the scenes material, then a gag reel, some deleted scenes, the trailer and a commetary track.

Usually the main character of the film suffers at the hands of the Mean Popular Queen Bee, always an outsider waiting to be persecuted at any moment.This film is no exception, but it offers a sharp, clever, refreshing takeoff on this much-used theme in teen movies. And for the first time, we see a girl who finds herself accepted into the Alpha-girl group, only to still suffer at the hands of the Queen Bee, even as an insider.The story is also downright funny. Tina Fey did an excellent job with the script and in her role as the math teacher.The fact that Cady is a total innocent when she's dropped into the hormone-crazed world of high school and the Plastics makes even a greater impact, because we can see her innocence corrupted by the heady, seductive pull of popularity and power. Yet she never quite loses her innocence and her ideals; Cady is still part observer, part participant who gets lost along the way, but learns some important lessons about life in the end and becomes a better, wiser person as a result.The audience is made painfully aware of the strict rules and social classes that govern high school life, because it is in such sharp contrast to the innocent, blank slate accepting attitude that home-schooled Cady brings with her on that first day of high school. We've all had yearnings of being in the popular group, myself included, but after viewing this film, I'm glad I belonged to the Art/Drama/Politically Active Intellectual Crowd instead of the Popular Alpha Girl Clique. That world was once offered to me--but I wisely refused, because I had already found my niche with the Drama/Art students, and being in the Alpha Girl Group no longer had the appeal it once had, as it became associated with superficial, empty-headed jocks and cheerleaders.",5,"Hilarious, Clever, Refreshing View of Teen  Film Genre",1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1977,"['stereotypical', 'films', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'teenagers', 'popular', 'Alpha-girl', 'group', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'being', 'prettiest', 'most', 'glamorous', 'girl', 'school', 'also', 'meanest', 'Usually', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'suffers', 'hands', 'Mean', 'Popular', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'always', 'outsider', 'waiting', 'be', 'persecuted', 'moment.This', 'film', 'exception', 'sharp', 'clever', 'refreshing', 'takeoff', 'much-used', 'theme', 'teen', 'movies', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'girl', 'who', 'accepted', 'Alpha-girl', 'group', 'only', 'still', 'suffer', 'hands', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'even', 'insider.The', 'story', 'also', 'downright', 'funny', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'script', 'role', 'math', 'teacher.The', 'fact', 'Cady', 'total', 'innocent', 'when', 'dropped', 'hormone-crazed', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'Plastics', 'even', 'greater', 'impact', 'can', 'see', 'innocence', 'corrupted', 'heady', 'seductive', 'pull', 'popularity', 'power', 'never', 'quite', 'innocence', 'ideals', 'Cady', 'still', 'part', 'observer', 'part', 'participant', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'important', 'lessons', 'life', 'end', 'better', 'wiser', 'person', 'result.The', 'audience', 'made', 'painfully', 'aware', 'strict', 'rules', 'social', 'classes', 'govern', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'such', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'innocent', 'blank', 'slate', 'accepting', 'attitude', 'home-schooled', 'Cady', 'first', 'day', 'high', 'school', ""'ve"", 'had', 'yearnings', 'being', 'popular', 'group', 'included', 'viewing', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'belonged', 'Art/Drama/Politically', 'Active', 'Intellectual', 'Crowd', 'instead', 'Popular', 'Alpha', 'Girl', 'Clique', 'world', 'was', 'once', 'offered', 'wisely', 'refused', 'had', 'already', 'found', 'niche', 'Drama/Art', 'students', 'being', 'Alpha', 'Girl', 'Group', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'appeal', 'once', 'had', 'became', 'associated', 'superficial', 'empty-headed', 'jocks', 'cheerleaders']",N/A

So despite Mark's less than stellar track record to date, I should probably have given Mean Girls a try sooner than I did. I don't think I've laughed that hard during a movie since Schindler's List.Mean Girls is the story of Cady (pronounced ""Katy"") Heron, who grew up homeschooled in Africa until her parents got tenure at an American university. In order to better socialize their daughter, they enroll her in a public high school. You can already see where this is going, can't you?Sure it's your basic teen comedy (though it straddles the line between PG-13 and R, having had a few scenes cut to get the softer rating), but what makes it appealing to those of us who are well out of high school is that while it still has the over-the-top feel of your basic teen comedy, it's done perfectly-- while the surface points are exaggerated (I'd have loved to have a principal as moronic as Mr. Duvall), the nuts-and-bolts of the characters and their interactions are dead-on, letting the ludicrousness of the whole situation provide the humor without attempting to unnecessarily beef it up. That, of course, is funnier than anything comedy writers could make up.

836058,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002IQJ8W,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","During the thirties, forties, and fifties, there were more Westerns made than any other genre. Yet since around 1984 there have probably been three times as many teen high school comedies made than Westerns. For the most part, this is not a good thing. There is the occasional gem, like FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH or IGGY GOES DOWN or CLUELESS or NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, but most are -- as they might say in this film -- kinda skanky. For the genre, MEAN GIRLS is definitely way, way above average, and is often quite nice.The premise was a bit hard for me to take. I actually knew a very large number of kids raised in Africa when I was an undergraduate (missionary kids, or MKs, as they are more widely known). While many were wonderful kids, they weren't as naive as Cady in this film, though they all did experience varying degrees of alienation. The MKs simply didn't seem to feel comfortable in mainstream American culture. OK, so that is the complaint I have about the film. There was a great opportunity to replicate an experience that a surprising number of kids experience, but they didn't really go into that. The nature of that experience can be illustrated by an encounter I had once. I met a guy who said he grew up in Africa. I instantly concluded without asking him that he was an MK, and therefore knew the other MKs on the continent and I asked, ""Oh, do you know David and Steve Ch***e?"" I wasn't the tiniest bit surprised when he replied, ""Oh yeah, of course!""OK, that aside, I thought this was a very delightful comedy. I had never seen Lindsay Lohan in anything before, and really didn't know anything about her except that she seems to be having a feud with some other teen performer whom I have also not seen in anything. I was, however, quite enchanted with her performance. She has a great deal of charm and was believable in the central role in the film. All the girls in the ""plastics"" were effective in their roles. I also never seen any of them before, though in searching through their previous roles on IMDB.com I was absolutely delighted to learn that one of them, Lacey Chabert (the lone brunette in the group) does the voice for Meg Griffin on THE FAMILY GUY, one of my favorite animated shows. All in all, it is a pretty decent cast.There is not a great deal more that I can add. There are a host of teen high school movies, and this one is one of the better ones, and while it has a couple of surprises, it really doesn't break many molds. I recommend it for someone who wants a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours while eating queso and chips.

836059,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002IQJ8W,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 14]","Cady Heron is about to experience her first day at school.  However, unlike most of us who went through this experience at around five years of age, Ms. Heron is an 11th grader who has spent her whole life living in Africa being home-schooled by her parents.  Now that the family has moved to an Illinois suburb, Cady is about to be tossed into the shark-infested waters of what we commonly refer to as public high school.  Having been thus far removed from catty American culture, Cady is, naturally, a nave, good-natured teen who thinks only the best of people - until, that is, she comes up against a group of snooty, gossipy bitches known affectionately around campus as The Plastics.  Much to her surprise, Cady is recruited into this most-coveted and most-hated of all the school's numerous cliques, and this is where the ""fun"" begins.""Mean Girls"" is a reasonably entertaining little satire, even though it rarely has the courage to go for the jugular when skewering its targets.  Instead, it plays it safe and becomes, in the end, just as phony and plastic as the thing it is attacking.  The film aims its sights at the usual high school horrors of cliquishness, backbiting and pre-programmed humiliation familiar to us from earlier teen comedies such as ""Clueless,"" if not from real life itself.  The humor in the film ranges from the mildly acerbic to the heavy-handed and obvious, but Lohan's charming and winning personality goes a long way towards redeeming the movie.  Moreover, the narrative arc works well, with Cady going from nave innocent to calculating saboteur to certified snob to enlightened humanitarian without missing a beat.""Mean Girls"" would be better if it were, in fact, a whole lot meaner than it is, but for Lohan's performance and a few genuinely funny moments, it's worth watching.",3,could be more slashing but a decent little satire,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1814,"['Cady', 'Heron', 'experience', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'However', 'most', 'who', 'went', 'experience', 'five', 'years', 'age', 'Ms.', 'Heron', '11th', 'grader', 'who', 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'living', 'Africa', 'being', 'home-schooled', 'parents', 'Now', 'family', 'moved', 'Illinois', 'suburb', 'Cady', 'be', 'tossed', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'what', 'commonly', 'refer', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'Having', 'been', 'thus', 'far', 'removed', 'catty', 'American', 'culture', 'Cady', 'naturally', 'nave', 'good-natured', 'teen', 'who', 'only', 'best', 'people', 'up', 'group', 'snooty', 'gossipy', 'bitches', 'known', 'affectionately', 'around', 'campus', 'Plastics', 'Much', 'surprise', 'Cady', 'recruited', 'most-coveted', 'most-hated', 'school', 'numerous', 'cliques', 'where', 'fun', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'little', 'satire', 'even', 'rarely', 'courage', 'go', 'jugular', 'when', 'skewering', 'targets', 'Instead', 'safe', 'becomes', 'end', 'just', 'phony', 'plastic', 'thing', 'attacking', 'film', 'sights', 'usual', 'high', 'school', 'horrors', 'cliquishness', 'backbiting', 'pre-programmed', 'humiliation', 'familiar', 'earlier', 'teen', 'comedies', 'such', 'Clueless', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'humor', 'film', 'mildly', 'acerbic', 'heavy-handed', 'obvious', 'Lohan', 'charming', 'winning', 'personality', 'long', 'way', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'Moreover', 'narrative', 'arc', 'well', 'Cady', 'going', 'nave', 'innocent', 'calculating', 'saboteur', 'certified', 'snob', 'enlightened', 'humanitarian', 'missing', 'beat', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'were', 'fact', 'whole', 'lot', 'meaner', 'Lohan', 'performance', 'few', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

836061,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B0002IQJ8W,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[102, 102]","Mean Girls is a modern masterpiece is terms of comedy and social commentary.  This movie has so many things going for it, inlcluding a stellar cast, hysterical dialogue, and a tremendously important theme that every person on the planet needs to heed:  you can feel good about yourself in such a way that your self-worth isn't forged at anyone else's expense.  Towards the end of the movie, Cady realizes that making fun of a girl from the competing math team will not help her win the game.  She then expounds on that insight: calling people ugly will not make you any prettier, calling them fat will not make you any skinnier, calling them stupid will not make you any smarter, and treating people badly will not make you any happier.In the special features, Rosalind Wiseman talks about her work with teenage boys and girls in the Empower program (which she cofounded). She points out the link between pretending people are not equal to you (and therefore you can rationalize treating them however you want) and violence.  We all feel the need to belong, and there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to fit in and belong.  The problem, Rosalind states, is when the group you want to belong to comes at too high of a price.  Do they treat you well?  Do they treat each other well?  How do they treat outsiders?Rosalind likes the last scene of the movie where Cady and Regina exchange friendly nods, and ""nerds"" and former ""Plastics"" intermingle, high school social status no longer separating them.  Everyone has a more relaxed body language, and no one is ""posturing"" or ""fronting.""  If only we could all get through the barriers of one-upmanship, snobbiness, and group identity and just chill and be ourselves!  (Okay, I'm not about to talk about a ""rainbow of feelings"" or whatever the sentimental girl in the gym/impromptu ""group therapy"" scene ranted on about.)The movie's all-important theme (of feeling self-worth in such a way that is not at anyone else's expense) is undergirded by some wicked-good comedy.  One of my friends and I are trying to get ""fetch"" into everyday vernacular in honor of Gretchen Wieners.  And who can beat the line, ""My nail beds suck...""?Another aspect of this movie that I really like is Cady's love for math.  Yes, she pretends not to be good at math to get Aaron to tutor her (while she patiently corrects him in her self-talk), but by the end of the movie, ""Africa"" is back in full game.  I was taking Calculus (as an adult student at a community college) when this movie came out, so I really appreciated the math references.",5,Both hilarious and poignant,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2573,"['Mean', 'Girls', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'terms', 'comedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'inlcluding', 'stellar', 'cast', 'hysterical', 'dialogue', 'tremendously', 'important', 'theme', 'person', 'planet', 'heed', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'way', 'self-worth', ""n't"", 'forged', 'anyone', 'else', 'expense', 'end', 'movie', 'Cady', 'making', 'fun', 'girl', 'competing', 'math', 'team', 'will', 'not', 'help', 'win', 'game', 'then', 'insight', 'calling', 'people', 'ugly', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'prettier', 'calling', 'fat', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'skinnier', 'calling', 'stupid', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'smarter', 'treating', 'people', 'badly', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'happier.In', 'special', 'features', 'Rosalind', 'Wiseman', 'work', 'teenage', 'boys', 'girls', 'Empower', 'program', 'cofounded', 'out', 'link', 'pretending', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'equal', 'therefore', 'can', 'rationalize', 'treating', 'however', 'want', 'violence', 'feel', 'need', 'belong', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'wanting', 'fit', 'belong', 'problem', 'Rosalind', 'states', 'when', 'group', 'want', 'belong', 'too', 'high', 'price', 'Do', 'treat', 'well', 'Do', 'treat', 'other', 'well', 'How', 'do', 'treat', 'outsiders', 'Rosalind', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Cady', 'Regina', 'exchange', 'friendly', 'nods', 'nerds', 'former', 'Plastics', 'intermingle', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'status', 'no', 'longer', 'separating', 'Everyone', 'more', 'relaxed', 'body', 'language', 'one', 'posturing', 'fronting', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'barriers', 'one-upmanship', 'snobbiness', 'group', 'identity', 'just', 'chill', 'be', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'talk', 'rainbow', 'feelings', 'whatever', 'sentimental', 'girl', 'gym/impromptu', 'group', 'therapy', 'scene', 'ranted', 'movie', 'all-important', 'theme', 'feeling', 'self-worth', 'such', 'way', 'not', 'anyone', 'else', 'expense', 'undergirded', 'wicked-good', 'comedy', 'One', 'friends', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'fetch', 'everyday', 'vernacular', 'honor', 'Gretchen', 'Wieners', 'who', 'can', 'beat', 'line', 'nail', 'beds', 'suck', 'aspect', 'movie', 'really', 'like', 'Cady', 'love', 'math', 'Yes', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'math', 'get', 'Aaron', 'tutor', 'patiently', 'self-talk', 'end', 'movie', 'Africa', 'back', 'full', 'game', 'was', 'taking', 'Calculus', 'adult', 'student', 'community', 'college', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'really', 'appreciated', 'math', 'references']",N/A
836062,A2WMOFWHQNE90H,B0002IQJ8W,Shawna Ride,"[595, 607]","The previous time I checked (and for a long time before), the ""most helpful"" reviews of MEAN GIRLS were hanging in or slowly increasing in the 50s or so range of ""helpful votes"". Then suddenly today I looked and the ""most helpful reviews"" of MEAN GIRLS show over a thousand ""helpful"" votes for the highest and hundreds of ""helpful votes"" for many others. As for the now ""most helpful"" reviewer, who said he ""caved in"" and saw the movie, one can only wonder if a bunch of his friends also caved in and flooded the site with votes; only it wouldn't just be for him; so many other OLD and NEW reviews suddenly far exceed the 50-some votes held by the reviews most highly rated just awhile back. And those last-mentioned reviews ARE probably the most intelligent ones, I think, and their ratings have hardly increased. Some of the most insightful comments were by those reviewers, including Robyn Jamil-Walid, Tanya Jasmine Tucker and Ashley Judd (probably NOT the actress by the same name; the review is way too smart).As for the movie, I suspect it has a good chance of being sadly, Lindsay Lohan's last really good movie. It came out about when a firestorm of Lindsay-bashing was suddenly becoming the in thing. Whether the bashing was at all deserved, it's sad as it will no doubt affect how Lindsay will be perceived as an actress and what roles she'll get. MEAN GIRLS may be the last time her talents will be appreciated for what they are in casting. And if her alleged spiral of self-destructive behavior, starting about the same time the film came out, is really anything that it's cracked-up to be, it will sadly adversely affect her in various ways, including probably her acting ability.One can hope Lindsay will recover some of her remarkable acting talent and appreciation for it for what it is, but if not, that is all the more reason to cherish this movie for possibly the zenith of her career. This is Lindsay at her best, for all said by one mysteriously enormously highly raated review, that calls it ""so not Lindsay"". Her performance is likeable as a not perfect, but generally good-willed high school student struggling to fit in with no prior experience in formal schooling. But also essential to making the movie work are performances as the other students, most notably Regina, Gretchen, Karen, Janis and Damian, but some students with only bit parts are also quite impressive. They form an image of high school that I dare say many of us can relate to, even if criticisms that the movie is less that squeakily realistic are judged to have some value. If one's memories of high school include being tormented by ""queen bee"" types like Regina, then one must surely find this film gratifying. If one does not so relate, one must, to be honest, suspect that that person WAS more like such a ""queen bee"" type, in which case such a person also deserves to see this movie, even if it hurts.If there is a weak point in the movie it is in Tina Fey's unfortunate decision to be both the screen writer and the one who plays the character she most set out to make the film's voice of wisdom. The results of trying to make her character that are faltering at best, and indeed lend credibility to the criticism in one review that the movie is Tina Fey's vanity project.",5,What's with suddenly jacked-up review ratings?,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3275,"['previous', 'time', 'checked', 'long', 'time', 'most', 'helpful', 'reviews', 'MEAN', 'GIRLS', 'were', 'hanging', 'slowly', 'increasing', '50s', 'so', 'range', 'helpful', 'votes', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'today', 'looked', 'most', 'helpful', 'reviews', 'MEAN', 'GIRLS', 'show', 'thousand', 'helpful', 'votes', 'highest', 'hundreds', 'helpful', 'votes', 'many', 'others', 'now', 'most', 'helpful', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'caved', 'saw', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'bunch', 'friends', 'also', 'caved', 'flooded', 'site', 'votes', 'only', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'OLD', 'NEW', 'reviews', 'suddenly', 'far', 'exceed', '50-some', 'votes', 'held', 'reviews', 'most', 'highly', 'rated', 'just', 'awhile', 'back', 'last-mentioned', 'reviews', 'ARE', 'probably', 'most', 'intelligent', 'ones', 'think', 'ratings', 'have', 'hardly', 'increased', 'most', 'insightful', 'comments', 'were', 'reviewers', 'including', 'Robyn', 'Jamil-Walid', 'Tanya', 'Jasmine', 'Tucker', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'probably', 'NOT', 'actress', 'same', 'name', 'review', 'way', 'too', 'smart', '.As', 'movie', 'suspect', 'good', 'chance', 'being', 'sadly', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'last', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'firestorm', 'Lindsay-bashing', 'was', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'thing', 'bashing', 'was', 'deserved', 'sad', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'affect', 'how', 'Lindsay', 'will', 'be', 'perceived', 'actress', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get', 'MEAN', 'GIRLS', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'talents', 'will', 'be', 'appreciated', 'what', 'are', 'casting', 'alleged', 'spiral', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'starting', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'really', 'anything', 'cracked-up', 'be', 'will', 'sadly', 'adversely', 'affect', 'various', 'ways', 'including', 'probably', 'acting', 'ability.One', 'can', 'hope', 'Lindsay', 'will', 'recover', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'talent', 'appreciation', 'what', 'not', 'more', 'reason', 'cherish', 'movie', 'possibly', 'zenith', 'career', 'Lindsay', 'best', 'said', 'one', 'mysteriously', 'enormously', 'highly', 'raated', 'review', 'so', 'not', 'Lindsay', 'performance', 'likeable', 'not', 'perfect', 'generally', 'good-willed', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'struggling', 'fit', 'prior', 'experience', 'formal', 'schooling', 'also', 'essential', 'making', 'movie', 'work', 'are', 'performances', 'other', 'students', 'most', 'notably', 'Regina', 'Gretchen', 'Karen', 'Janis', 'Damian', 'students', 'only', 'bit', 'parts', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'impressive', 'form', 'image', 'high', 'school', 'dare', 'say', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'less', 'squeakily', 'realistic', 'are', 'judged', 'have', 'value', 'one', 'memories', 'high', 'school', 'include', 'being', 'tormented', 'queen', 'bee', 'types', 'Regina', 'then', 'one', 'must', 'surely', 'find', 'film', 'gratifying', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'relate', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'suspect', 'person', 'WAS', 'more', 'queen', 'bee', 'type', 'case', 'person', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'hurts.If', 'weak', 'point', 'movie', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'unfortunate', 'decision', 'be', 'screen', 'writer', 'one', 'who', 'character', 'most', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'voice', 'wisdom', 'results', 'trying', 'make', 'character', 'are', 'faltering', 'best', 'indeed', 'lend', 'credibility', 'criticism', 'one', 'review', 'movie', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'vanity', 'project']",N/A

I really like it and think it shows the high school scene through a girl's point of view.  This movie's about a young girl who enters high school for the very first time.  16-year-old Cady Heron has been home-schooled all her life.  Till now that is.  She befriends Janis Ian and Damian, who informs her on who is ""naughty or nice"" in the school.  They also tell Cady about, and to stay away from, The Plastics.  One day, Cady gets invited to sit with The Plastics for lunch.  Regina George, the leader of The Plastics (aka ""The Queen Bee"") invites Cady to eat with them for the rest of the week.  Cady agrees, and then afterwards tells Janis and Damian the news.When Cady falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels, Regina agrees to talk to him for Cady.  At a Halloween party, as Regina is talking to Aaron, she inadvertently kisses him.  Heartbroken, Cady and her two friends plan to destroy Regina (emotionally of course).  They do all kinds of stuff to breakdown Regina's ""image"".This is a really good movie with a great cast.  Lindsay Lohan plays an outstanding role as Cady.  Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams (also starred in The Notebook) is awesome at her role also.  Her role was also very believable, as if she was a real life ""Plastic"".P.S.

The film stars Lindsey Lohan as Cady Heron.  Cady's parents are zoologists that worked in Africa studying animals and Cady was home schooled her entire life.  They return to the U.S. and Cady enters public schooling for the first time.  Cady soon learns that life in the African bush was easy compared to life in a suburban high school jungle.  There are cliques everywhere, people pretend to be things they aren't, and very few people are sincere and genuine.  Cady is initially befriended by two of the school's outcasts, Damian (Daniel Franzese) and Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) who give Cady the lowdown of the different cliques in the school.  They warn Cady about the most harmful of all the groups, The Plastics, a group of high maintenance girls who because of their beauty are the most popular and most hated girls in the school.  Janis had been burned by the Plastic's Queen Bee, Regina George (Rachel McAdams) a few years ago and Janis wants revenge.  Cady might have been raised in the wilds of Africa, but she is intelligent and attractive and soon The Plastics seek to initiate her into their group.  Cady isn't very happy with the idea at first, but Janis thinks it's brilliant because Cady can be a spy for the cause.  Things start out alright but after seeing Regina smooching the boy she likes, Cady begins to hatch a plan of revenge of her own.  Things get messing and before the spring semester is over Cady finds that she has become the thing she most despised, the Queen Bee.Initially, I was reluctant to watch MEAN GIRLS.  I know it had received a lot of hype, but from the descriptions I had heard and read, it seemed to be like a glorified chick flick.  I was wrong.  The film will appeal most to high school and college aged girls, but it has a greater appeal than that.  No matter where a person has attended high school in the United States, they are sure to relate in someway to the groups that are described in the film and how every little petty thing can seem to have so much importance.  The film is extremely well written with a witty and biting sense of humor and isn't cheesy are schmaltzy.  The film is a great satire about high school life in most U.S. secondary schools, yet in doing so comments on larger issues affecting everyone in society.Lindsay Lohan is a very beautiful young woman and a talented actress.  If she gets her act together she might reach the top tiers of the acting profession.  Actually, all of the actors and actresses in the film do a great job.  Personally I was pleased to see Neil Flynn play Cady's father--I love his role of The Janitor on SCRUBS and I think he's one of the most underrated character actors in the business.With that said, MEAN GIRLS is still a chick flick, but it's one that doesn't have a sappy ending.

Cady is an American girl who was raised in South Africa and home schooled until she was 16. She goes into an Illinois high school having no understanding of the basic socialization that most kids experience in Junior High if not in grade school.So, Cady doesn't know about the ""slut rule"" wherein girls on Halloween can dress like a playboy centerfold and not get in trouble or about burn books or about backstabbing among friends. Cady learns very quickly with the help of two eccentric and artsy friends who have a grudge against Regina, the Queen Bee, at Cady's school.Lindsay Lohan does a good job of playing an innocent girl turned  witchy and then returned to normal. The jokes are cruel but funny and you feel Cady's embarrassment when she succumbs to the pressure of the ""plastics"" and starts spreading rumors about friends and teachers at school.In general, the movie is well cast. The principal of the school is awkward and dateless enough; Regina is as mean as can be while still seeming authentic; her two co-horts are so desperate for attention that they'll do anything or snub anyone to get it; the hot guy is genuinely ""hot"" enough to see why Cady has become a Plastic to get to him; and Cady's friends are forgivably vengeful as they use her to get back at Regina.The plot flows at a good pace and the dialogue is fresh enough to genuinely laugh along without fear of being caught up in horrible cliches.

My favorite characters in the movie, however, are Ms. Norberry (played by Tina Fey, who also helped to write the script) and Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan, from the short-lived TV show ""The Pitts""). They're both sarcastic, witty characters that make you laugh consistantly.The extras on the DVD are great too - deleted scenes (most of which are hilarious and should have stayed in the movie), a gag reel, and (my favorite) the audio commentary featuring star/writer Tina Fey. They definately talk about how the movie should have been, and why it almost got an R rating.MEAN GIRLS is my favorite movie/DVD of the year, I got it the day it came out and I've already watched it two or three times.
