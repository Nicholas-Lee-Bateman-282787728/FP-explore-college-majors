Not only is it nature, but it's educational and everyone in your home can watch it. Parents can sit with their kids and learn as well as talk about the things they are seeing.. it's interaction with each other.. you remember that right? lol.. anyway.. I highly recommend this show whether you are watching it alone or with the family. You can escape to Africa and come away with a bit more knowledge and perhaps a higher level of appreciation for this world and it's wildlife.",5,Love it!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,642,"['When', 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'wanting', 'something', 'expand', 'brain', 'rather', 'dull', 'one', 'shows', 'should', 'watch', 'opinion', 'Not', 'only', 'nature', 'educational', 'everyone', 'home', 'can', 'watch', 'Parents', 'can', 'sit', 'kids', 'learn', 'as', 'well', 'talk', 'things', 'are', 'seeing..', 'interaction', 'other..', 'remember', 'right', 'lol..', 'anyway..', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'are', 'watching', 'alone', 'family', 'can', 'escape', 'Africa', 'come', 'away', 'bit', 'more', 'knowledge', 'perhaps', 'higher', 'level', 'appreciation', 'world', 'wildlife']",BBC Atlas of the Natural World: Wild Africa

The episodes discuss the environmental changes that have given rise to each species. I prefer looking at individual ecosystems on one continent rather than the ""flying around the world"" approach ofPlanet Earth. With that said, this documentary is much older thanPlanet Earth(first produced in the late 1980s), so it simply doesn't have the HD quality viewers are used to. Regardless, there are still some amazing scenes, such as sea lions sneaking up on gannets in the water and hippos fighting each other with bloody jaws. Also, the enhanced mode is actually informative and not too intrusive, mentioning interesting facts about the animals.

Well-placed animation segments.  Overall, very enjoyable and easy to watch. After viewing this a second time, all I could think of was ""I-Max 3D.""  If I had the means, it would take longer for you to read this review than the time it would take to view the movie.  But, I won't burden you with that. The videography is so spectacular that at times I thought it would have to be staged in Hollywood rather than in the wild.  The time-lapse photograhy was stunning and the wild-life footage was unbelievable. The voice-over narration was helpful but non-intrusive and showed a great deal of reasearch on the part of the producers. For a middle or high school student this is a great movie.  Given tne right amount of preparation,it could also be very productive for younger students as well.  As for me, I'm waiting for it to appear in I-Max 3-D.
