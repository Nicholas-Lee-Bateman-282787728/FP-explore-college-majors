1152678,A2I5XLUCBTKQE4,B00168OILM,,"[3, 3]","Except for the ridiculous episode where Ryan and Micki infiltrate a Catholic Church looking for a pen, this whole first season was outstanding!  My wife and I crack up at that Church episode because, when they go to the basement of the church, naturally there's a guillotine! LOL... We Catholics always have guillotines at the bottom of our churches, just in case we decide to have a last-minute inquisition! LOL puhllleeze! lolI forgot actually how BOLD this series was horror-wise for its time. That episode ""Root of all Evil"" where that crazy mutha throws people into a yard shreader and money comes out!?....wowzers! That was gory and all-out creepy! I can't believe they even got that one on TV! lolAnother over-the-top creepy and YET HILARIOUS episode was ""The Electrocutioner.""  A dentist using a cursed electric chair!? Now that's definitely worth signing-on for!My favorite episodes were: ""The Quilt of Hathor I and II,"" ""Vanity's Mirror,"" ""A Cup of Time,"" ""Bedazzled"" etc.As interesting an episode as it was, ""The Baron's Bride"" was pretty weird. I like the way our heroes show up at the beginning of the episode to claim a cursed cape only to find out it's in the hands of a vampire. Now what are those odds! Then we get a Jack the Ripper plot to boot! LOLThis series was so much fun, so bold, and the characters were neat. Ryan is quirky and fun, Micki is hot as blazes, Jack is like the uncle you always wanted, and Uncle Lewis is an all-out wackoboy! The haunted antiques/items are downright creepy and clever.The DVD quality is a tad grainy and most definitely NOT perfect. But as other posters have stated, this was the 80's and the quality at the time. I remember watching this show at midnight after my parents went to bed as a junior high kid. It was a tad grainy and surely not HD lol but it works for me....Don't let a little imperfection snobbery keep you from watching a classic show!This show is a real gem. Go buy it and get out the popcorn!

It pre-dated such series as Tales from the Darkside, Tales from Crypt, and Freddy's Nightmares. The cast was great including Chris Wiggins (ReGenesis, Earth: Final Conflict, etc...) as Jack Marshak. Louis Robey as Mikki Foster, and John D. LeMay as Ryan Dallion.When I tell horror fans about it today, very few can recall it. I can remember many stories from the series including the vampire's cape, cupid's arrow, etc...I'm only giving the DVD 4 stars since I read today that there are no extra features.

I've seen a bootleg version of the series that was taped during a F13th marathon and it was no worse than these DVDs.

What we have here is nothing short of insulting--a total of 40-odd seconds of 2 promos with the trademark F13 headstone erupting out of the ground, and a brief sales promotion.  Who was really clamoring for these non-bonuses?Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but I was hoping for more.

In truth, it had absolutely nothing to do with it.This Canadian-made suspense drama's plot consisted of an antique dealer who made a deal with Satan to sell cursed artifacts.  The artifacts all brought the bearer some great benefit, but at a terrible price.  When his conscience  finally caught up with him, however, the devil turned on him and captured his soul.  His co-worker, along with his nephew and his cousin (played by Robey - one of the hottest redheads to ever grace our TV screens), set out to reclaim all the artifacts and return them to a secured and consecrated vaults where the artifacts can do no more harm.Each episode deals with the team trying to reclaim a new artifact.  There are some truly incredible moments of drama in this series showing how people can be seduced by evil, even though they have the purest hearts or intentions.Seasons 1 & 2 are incredible, and the finale to season 2 blew me away more than any episode of any TV show.  Season 3 saw the departure of one of the lead characters, which many see as the ""Jump The Shark"" moment, but the other two characters and the new actor still do an admirable job after loosing a key character.The whole series is available elsewhere online - just do a search and you can find the whole collection, region-free, for under $50.

Cousins Micki (Louise Robey) and Ryan (John D. LeMay, who would actually go on to star in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday) come to inherit an antiques shop from their uncle (who had made a deal with the devil), only to learn that the shop's antiques are cursed.  Eventually, they meet the knowledgable Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) who assists the cousins in tracking down the objects over the course of this debut season.  What really helped Friday the 13th: The Series so great was the atmosphere that the show managed to conjure on a consistent basis.  The stories may seem kind of cliche as the season opens, but there are some inventive twists and creepy turns that will definitely hold your interest.  Guest stars on this first season included R.G. Armstrong (as the cousin's late uncle) and an 8-year old Sarah Polley (both in the pilot episode), as well as Ray Walston, Carrie Snodgress, David Proval, and Postal's Zack Ward; and also featured horror great David Cronenberg helming the excellent episode ""Faith Healer"" to boot.  All in all, it's nice to finally have Friday the 13th: The Series on DVD, although it would have been nice if Paramount would have included some sort of extras on the set.

The one thing we have to point out is that in no way is this series related to the movies,  the series story is that you have an elderly man and owner of an antique store who made a pact with the devil for wealth and eternal life and part of the pact allows the devil to curse the mans collection of antiques from his store to bring darkness and calamity to anyone who uses them but seeing the devastation and calamity he helped cause becomes regretful and tries to reclaim the and reg nay on his deal with the devil which causes his death.  Than we have his nephew and niece who inherent the store and while the nephew wants to keep the store the niece ultimately convinces him that they should sell the store and the cursed antiques which their unaware of,  after selling most of the cursed objects the are accosted by another gentleman who was once a friend of their uncle who tells them about the curse and pact their uncle did.  Now filled with guilt of what they've done the group now tries to reclaim all the cursed objects they and their uncles have sold while trying to stay alive from the people who have giving into the power of the cursed objects and the gifts or rewards the objects promise to give them.  The effects while o.k. won't be up to what many people have gotten use to in the last fifteen years but considering that the series was in the mid 80's I think we can cut them a break,  the video while decent again won't be the clear video quality we've seen with other t.v. box sets since the last ten years but again the video is still decent in clear enough to not really worry about.

1152712,AVMAHVWDGNOKK,B00168OILM,Rock~N~Rolla,"[0, 0]","Friday the 13th the series is one of those shows that when I first heard about it coming to TV way back in the 1980s I was like, what the...?! How is a show based on Jason Voorhees going to work on a weekly basis? It would get old really fast. Then more details started to emerge about the plot synopsis...""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil to sell cursed antiques..."" And, well, you all know the drill--turned out the show had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the psycho slasher films starring ol' hockey mask-faced Jason Voorhees after all. And then I thought to myself, What a great concept for a TV series! And so it was. From the start I watched it weekly and quickly became a fan.Fast forward all these years later and here I am watching these now classic episodes on DVD and they are just as great as I remember them to be. It's great to finally be able to see this show again featuring favorite characters such as Ryan, Micki, and Jack Marshak, played wonderfully by the great John D. Lemay, Louise Robey, and Chris Wiggins. It feels like being reunited with long lost friends again.As others have mentioned before in previous reviews, there is something to be desired with the picture quality, it's not as good as it could be. Actually, it's not really all that bad and some episodes look much better than others, but for the most part the quality is passable, and for the price that I paid, more than acceptable enough to be able to revisit this old series.If you are looking for some spooky thrills and chills mixed in with some thought-provoking scenarios and unexpected twists and turns then definitely give this show a try. It will most assuredly keep you entertained, and also have you checking the closet and under your bed before going to sleep at night.",5,"One of the eeriest, and best TV shows that was ever aired!",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1787,"['Friday', '13th', 'series', 'one', 'shows', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'coming', 'TV', 'way', 'back', '1980s', 'was', 'what', 'How', 'show', 'based', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'going', 'work', 'weekly', 'basis', 'would', 'get', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'Then', 'more', 'details', 'started', 'emerge', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'Lewis', 'Vendredi', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'sell', 'cursed', 'antiques', 'well', 'know', 'drill', 'turned', 'out', 'show', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'psycho', 'slasher', 'films', 'starring', 'ol', 'hockey', 'mask-faced', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'then', 'thought', 'myself', 'What', 'great', 'concept', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'start', 'watched', 'weekly', 'quickly', 'became', 'fan.Fast', 'forward', 'years', 'later', 'here', 'am', 'watching', 'now', 'classic', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'remember', 'be', 'great', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'show', 'again', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'characters', 'such', 'Ryan', 'Micki', 'Jack', 'Marshak', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'John', 'D.', 'Lemay', 'Louise', 'Robey', 'Chris', 'Wiggins', 'being', 'reunited', 'long', 'lost', 'friends', 'again.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'reviews', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'Actually', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'episodes', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'others', 'most', 'part', 'quality', 'passable', 'price', 'paid', 'more', 'acceptable', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'revisit', 'old', 'series.If', 'are', 'looking', 'spooky', 'thrills', 'chills', 'mixed', 'thought-provoking', 'scenarios', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'then', 'definitely', 'give', 'show', 'try', 'will', 'most', 'assuredly', 'keep', 'entertained', 'also', 'have', 'checking', 'closet', 'bed', 'going', 'sleep', 'night']",Friday The 13th - The Series: Season 1
1152713,AJZAJ7S963ZS6,B00168OILM,"Sauromon ""sauroman5""","[0, 7]","I love a good fright  as well as I am sure a lot of others out there as well. Heck I even like a good slasher fick as well but this is not what this review is about. There are Great ways to do a Horror/Sci Fi Show and then there is this series which is most cerainly not. Yes all of these series will have some kind of cheese factor, cliches, and over acting and this FT13TS sad to say had way too much. The sign of a great series is if can be believable and frightening with out having to go to the gore / gross out factor- it is called using the imagination (remember Hitchcock..anyone??) which this series tried to do but failed on so many levels. Running thru the forrest with a tea cup over your head to keep it from the bad guy, or taking a white glove (  ooohhh...dont let him touch you!!) away from a faith healer or even taking a muppet like talking doll away from a little girl episode. ( even Chucky would hate this one!!) Dont even get started on the vampire episode which is so lame it is truly sad and their theory on just how was dracula written- Dont ask you just might gag. Yes, the the gag reflex is off the charts on this- when something is so bad you double over in agony just wishing it was over. This series is not scary or packs any thrills in any sence of the imagination. This series comes accross as a badly acted comedy. It tries too hard and falls flat. It simply does not deliver the chills or thrills or any thing for that matter. The series had great potential but was destroyed by poor writing, Cheezy story lines (aka lack of imagination), unbeilevably silly situations, really  and I mean REALLY bad acting, and the direction was lame as well as the picture quality of this series. Well some will say well this was done in the Mid 1980's and didnt have much to work with and My reply will be well then if you want to see how a really good series is done all you have to do is to go back into the late 60's and 1970's -years before this disaster was made and see two of the most influential series ( thet eventually inspired shows like Tales From the Crypt, Buffy, Angel, Charmed and a few others) those shows were Dark Shadows and The Night Stalker (No not the new one - they butchered that one as well) These series were told in 45 min or less (except for the movies) they had a great formula, story writing/lines, acting, atmosphers, great music, again no gore/ gross out needed. You set the situation up right with atmosphere, great story telling, supurb music, acting , direction and use of camera angles and set up-  add some cheese factor and cliches and what you get was a great laugh followed by a truly thrilling & chilling jump out of your seat experience.  Evey thing that FT13TS lacks on every level. It was so painful to watch I could just get to the middle of the first season before I had to turn it off. I truly could not pick one good episode from the bunch- not one. I truly am suprised by the ""rave"" reviews this recieved. Maybe for Nostalgia sake , but that cant even save the series. I grew up with all of these series and remember this being on TV so when I saw this come out and the reviews I thought well lets give it a try- in what should have been a fun blast truned into a real disappointment, unbearable to watch & a even quicker trip to trade it in. With ""older series like that were released like- Night Gallery, Twilight Zone, Dark Shadows, Night Stalker etc- when they came out on dvd the picture and sound was sharp , crisp and well done. Who ever got hold of this sad series to begin with didnt even bother to clean it up which just adds to the complete disaster that it already is.  The idea was there- but it simply didnt have anything going for it poorly executed in every way. What could have been great just  ends up like a big wet thud. If you like way over the top poorly acted, scripted  and way too cheezy (like Ed Wood movies) you may want to take a peek at this. Other wise if you are looking for a reasonably intelligent and classic series like the ones previously mentioned-you definately want to stay far away from this or you will be looking to off load this dvd at a trade in store with in a week you start watching it. There are just some things that should remain buried and Friday the 13th The Series is sure one of them. Ugh!

1152714,A35X1ATK484AMB,B00168OILM,Shane M. Turner,"[0, 2]","Pens, dolls, scalpels, boxing gloves, vanity mirrors, strange looking quilts, and just for good measure a defunct electric chair! Things most anyone could find at a garage sale or local flea market, or if you happen to reside near a cursed antique shop owned by Lewis Vandredi. And, since these items from Mr. Vandredi come with the bonus of having been cursed exclusively by the Devil himself, you also get the unwelcomed element of death waiting for you to turn your back on them as well!Enter our lucky trio consisting of young and rebellious Ryan Dallion (John D. Lemay), his beautiful, high-maintenance cousin Micki Foster (Louise Robey billed simply as Robey) and the wise-old sage and once close friend of Mr. Vandredi, Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins) (whom offers his knowledge of the occult and whom is often a key factor in their surviving the various deadly situations they find themselves struggling against) who are attempting to retrieve Uncle Lewis' cursed odds and ends, where they can be securely entrusted in the store's basement vault and away from the perverse temptations of the outside world.Risking being dismissed as a complete goof, F13TS manages to maintain a fine line between credibility and being entirely heedless. Most season one episodes keep the show on due course and manages to be, if not engaging, at least mildly entertaining and inventive. In defense of the seemingly sophomoric teleplays that enfold, the series is low budget at best and shot entirely in Canada, using mostly a Canadian cast and crew. All the while, trying to play itself off as taking place in America. There are faults in this attempt (mostly landmarks and signs which are a constant enemy of location shooting) most of which do not detract the viewer's attention. But, for those of us whom are blessed (or cursed depending upon one's point-of-view) with the ability to pinpoint a mistake in continuity or geographical location within the passing of a film frame or two, these blemishes only go to prove that the show was done quickly and on a shoestring budget and seems to carry about it the constant threat of being axed at any slip of a ratings point! And, while it did manage to thrive for three seasons, most fans revel in the 1st and 2nd seasons in which the character of Ryan was still present. Sadly, Mr. Lemay eventually pursued other interests and thus, the premature fate of the series was set in motionHaving nothing to do with the highly popular and successful film franchise bearing the exact name (something of a major disappointment to `Friday' fans, myself included) the series instead focuses on the hunting down and obtaining of cursed objects sold by Uncle Lewis (Ryan and Micki unknowingly contributed to this debacle when after having just inherited Lewis' antique store (after his bizarre death) they immediately began to sell everything off in the hopes of making a quick buck and getting out of dodge without too much disruption to their personal lives; of which none of the aforementioned happened much to their chagrin) rather than of having anything to do with the big, clumsy, hockey-masked sporting kid named Jason who excels in chopping people up with his oversized machete.And just as each item is unique as the next, so is the curse that belongs to it. Specifics are not important here as discovering what the item does and how it dispatches its victims is half of the fun! Here's just a few of the primo episodes that make up this 1st season: `The Inheritance', `A Cup of Time', `Hellowe'en', `Doctor Jack', `Root of all Evil', `Faith Healer', The Electrocutioner', `The Quilt of Hathor', `Double Exposure'(as close to Jason Voorhees as one will get in the first season),'The Pirate's Promise', and `What a Mother Wouldn't Do'. Of the 26 season one episodes, the aforementioned are the cr&egrave;me du lay and as the first season draws to an close, we witness it's gradual, yet persistent climb in production value and in the care taken providing stories that are both graphically enlightening and imaginatively unique, while ensuring that our protagonists remain interesting and continue to develop both as a trio, as well as individually. A certain challenge for a series that cost around $500,00 an episode and which became the target of infuriated viewers displeased with the amount of onscreen violence and gore that, for it's time, was running comfortably alongside with many of the R-rated horror films of it's day.F13TS' look does little to impress. Respectively shot in its original television 1.33:1 aspect ratio, most of the episodes are filled with film grain (the later few discs seem not to have inherited quite so much--of which I question either the transfer of the first few episodes or perhaps as the series grew in popularity, so did the quality of photography?), and colors are often muted and sometimes murky. Though, the series presented here on DVD is an improvement over the original broadcasts, this is far from showroom material. Then, again, were you really expecting `reference' showroom material from a low-budget 80's TV show?Audio is presented in Dolby Digital Mono and is efficient in delivering clear dialogue. No surrounds. No booming base.Extras are slim: two original network launch promotional trailers which tally up to 44 seconds worth of material. A ten minute sales presentation sums up the extras department and is nothing more than the various episodes fashioned in montage style and voiced-over by the late Don LaFontaine.Television history may or may not have taken notice of the `little engine that could' that is `Friday the 13th: the Series', but for those viewers who have come to embrace it over the years the series (""cheese"" factor and all!) still remains a guilty treat filled with hidden dangers, of which we can't help but indulge in anyway. And, I promise if you purchase it you won't get more than what you bargained for!Maybe.",3,Got Cursed Objects?,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,5924,"['Pens', 'dolls', 'scalpels', 'boxing', 'gloves',

F13: The Series is the story of Lewis Vendredi, a man who made a deal with the devil to sell cursed objects, but he broke the pact, and it cost him his soul. His neice Micki and her cousin Ryan inherited the store, and must now get everything back. Great series from the start, but the series lost a lot of appeal by the Third Season. A lot of people gripe it had nothing to do with F13 the movie series, but come on! The movies never copyrighted the Friday The 13th name so anyone else can use it for their own movies and TV shows. Anyway, my product is an obvious out and out bootleg. The cover art doesn't match the studio DVD, the picture quality is abysmal, the SyFy channel logo is present and so art clips of commercials, the commercial breaks are off, the close-captioning doesn't work either and the funny thing is, the box says ""Season One"" but its actually the WHOLE SERIES. I'd much rather have a quality Season One with some bonus features than a bootleg complete season in a Season One packaging. I think the retailer should have had more details in its description.",2,A Bit of a Surprise,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,1191,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'series', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'now', 'wish', 'had', 'waited', 'bit', 'longer', 'F13', 'Series', 'story', 'Lewis', 'Vendredi', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'sell', 'cursed', 'objects', 'broke', 'pact', 'cost', 'soul', 'neice', 'Micki', 'cousin', 'Ryan', 'inherited', 'store', 'must', 'now', 'get', 'everything', 'back', 'Great', 'series', 'start', 'series', 'lost', 'lot', 'appeal', 'Third', 'Season', 'lot', 'people', 'gripe', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'F13', 'movie', 'series', 'come', 'movies', 'never', 'copyrighted', 'Friday', '13th', 'name', 'so', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'use', 'own', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'Anyway', 'product', 'obvious', 'out', 'bootleg', 'cover', 'art', ""n't"", 'match', 'studio', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'abysmal', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'logo', 'present', 'so', 'art', 'clips', 'commercials', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'are', 'off', 'close-captioning', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'funny', 'thing', 'box', 'Season', 'One', 'actually', 'WHOLE', 'SERIES', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'quality', 'Season', 'One', 'bonus', 'features', 'bootleg', 'complete', 'season', 'Season', 'One', 'packaging', 'think', 'retailer', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'details', 'description']",Friday The 13th - The Series: Season 1
