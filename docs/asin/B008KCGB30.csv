1569041,AIO247KHD2O40,B008KCGB30,James N Simpson,"[1, 1]","This is a low budget film, partly funded by the Australian government but this one proves, that you don't need a lot of money to make a really good fun to watch movie.  Basically after a scene on a fictitious pacific island where our British groom to be meets an Australian girl, then one in and outside of a London flat, pretty much the rest of the film is filmed in the grounds of a mansion (and a set somewhere depicting a few rooms inside) in The Blue Mountains, a couple of hours out of Sydney where the wedding is to take place. It doesn't have a big name cast, the actors aren't unknown though, you might have seen them in other movies such as Bait, Pitch Perfect, Not Suitable For Children,  Death at a Funeral (original not American remake) and other movies.  You're biggest name would be Olivia Newton John, the bride's mother who hasn't been in much in the last few decades but obviously became an icon in the late 70's and 80s with Grease and other films.  She does a really good job in this one and isn't afraid to make fun of herself.  In fact all the actors are prepared to do scenes that make them look stupid or embarrassed, which is what really makes this work, all the scenes where a situations makes each characters uncomfortable, or takes them out of their comfort zone time and time again.A Few Best Men is a lot of fun, it's something a lot of comedies try and be, that is simply, it's funny!  Basically it's a culture clash in that the bride's family are a well to do upper class (dad is a senator) rich family and the groom's friends are typical British lads, into getting drunk who haven't really grown up yet. A lot of important Australians and politicians of course are attending the wedding. Although the British lads don't want to make things difficult for the groom, they just keep getting themselves into worse and worse scenarios, not helped by a night getting wasted on the eve of the wedding involving a ram which has been vital to the father's election plans over the years, which followed earlier in the day a stop at a weird drug dealers house one of them had got the name of, to buy some weed that didn't go as planned.",5,Fun Low Budget Film That Relies on a Good Script Instead of Special Effects,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2158,"['low', 'budget', 'film', 'partly', 'funded', 'Australian', 'government', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'money', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'Basically', 'scene', 'fictitious', 'pacific', 'island', 'where', 'British', 'groom', 'be', 'meets', 'Australian', 'girl', 'then', 'one', 'London', 'flat', 'pretty', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'filmed', 'grounds', 'mansion', 'set', 'somewhere', 'depicting', 'few', 'rooms', 'Blue', 'Mountains', 'couple', 'hours', 'Sydney', 'where', 'wedding', 'take', 'place', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'unknown', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Bait', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'Not', 'Suitable', 'Children', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'original', 'not', 'American', 'remake', 'other', 'movies', ""'re"", 'biggest', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'bride', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'obviously', 'became', 'icon', 'late', '70', '80s', 'Grease', 'other', 'films', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'one', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'make', 'fun', 'herself', 'fact', 'actors', 'are', 'prepared', 'do', 'scenes', 'make', 'look', 'stupid', 'embarrassed', 'what', 'really', 'work', 'scenes', 'where', 'situations', 'characters', 'uncomfortable', 'comfort', 'zone', 'time', 'time', 'again.A', 'Few', 'Best', 'Men', 'lot', 'fun', 'something', 'lot', 'comedies', 'try', 'be', 'simply', 'funny', 'Basically', 'culture', 'clash', 'bride', 'family', 'are', 'well', 'do', 'upper', 'class', 'dad', 'senator', 'rich', 'family', 'groom', 'friends', 'are', 'typical', 'British', 'lads', 'getting', 'drunk', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'yet', 'lot', 'important', 'Australians', 'politicians', 'course', 'are', 'attending', 'wedding', 'British', 'lads', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'things', 'difficult', 'groom', 'just', 'keep', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'scenarios', 'not', 'helped', 'night', 'getting', 'wasted', 'eve', 'wedding', 'involving', 'ram', 'been', 'vital', 'father', 'election', 'years', 'followed', 'earlier', 'day', 'stop', 'weird', 'drug', 'dealers', 'house', 'one', 'had', 'got', 'name', 'buy', 'weed', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned']","A Few Best Men (2011) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - Australia ]"
1569042,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B008KCGB30,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[1, 1]","Xavier Samuel (TWILIGHT, ANONYMOUS, NEWCASTLE, ETC.) is on vacation in Australia where he meets the love of his life. She is the daughter of a Senator who would like her to take his place when he shortly retires (a future complication for a planned marriage). Samuel proposes, she accepts, he returns to England before coming back to Australia for the upcoming nuptials. Back in England, Samuel encounters the rainy weather of London and is soaked by the time he gets back to his domicile.Once home, he peels off his wet clothes and proceeds to walk stark naked into either a living room or bedroom (it's not quite clear) only to encounter a surprise ""welcome home"" from a horde of family and friends. The stunned and embarassed Samuel anxiously covers himself and retreats from the laughing mob who are also busy taking pictures with their cell phones - a supposedly humorous portent of things to come. Get the picture?Once Samuel recovers, he announces his wedding plans to his ""best friends"" who immediately announce that they will accompany him back to Australia. Samuel does not appear to be especially pleased over the prospect - with good reason. This is a motley crew. From then on, in a kind of ""Wedding Crashers"" scenario, things begin to rapidly unfold for the worse - hilarious at times, a bit shocking at others, crude, lude, and entertaining all at the same time.What could have turned into a French Farce, however, is saved by the acting of the handsome and talented Samuel (who plays it straight) and the presence of Olivia Newton-John as the bride to be'ssympathetic and jovial mother. From a misguided speech by one of his ""best friends"" at Samuel's wedding to a convoluted situation with a ram, the movie progresses at a rapid pace to its predictable conclusion. Yet, this is not a trite story. Friendships are tested and endure, love prevails, and a great deal of self discovery for all comes about. The fun is ""getting there"". If you are not offended by particular language, references to certain sexual body parts, homosexual jokes, and the actions of those who appear more like a ""bull in a China shop"", this movie's for you. It does have substance as well as bawdy humor. Unfortunately, a limited theatrical release and a lack of sufficient advertising did not help this film achieve any heights. It deserved better.",5,WITH BEST FRIENDS LIKE THAT WHO NEEDS....,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2340,"['Xavier', 'Samuel', 'TWILIGHT', 'ANONYMOUS', 'NEWCASTLE', 'ETC', 'vacation', 'Australia', 'where', 'love', 'life', 'daughter', 'Senator', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'shortly', 'future', 'complication', 'planned', 'marriage', 'Samuel', 'England', 'coming', 'back', 'Australia', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'Back', 'England', 'Samuel', 'rainy', 'weather', 'London', 'soaked', 'time', 'back', 'domicile.Once', 'home', 'wet', 'clothes', 'proceeds', 'walk', 'stark', 'naked', 'living', 'room', 'bedroom', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'only', 'encounter', 'surprise', 'welcome', 'home', 'horde', 'family', 'friends', 'stunned', 'embarassed', 'Samuel', 'anxiously', 'retreats', 'laughing', 'mob', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'busy', 'taking', 'pictures', 'cell', 'phones', 'supposedly', 'humorous', 'portent', 'things', 'come', 'Get', 'picture', 'Once', 'Samuel', 'recovers', 'wedding', 'plans', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'immediately', 'announce', 'will', 'accompany', 'back', 'Australia', 'Samuel', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'especially', 'pleased', 'prospect', 'good', 'reason', 'motley', 'crew', 'then', 'kind', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'scenario', 'things', 'begin', 'rapidly', 'unfold', 'worse', 'hilarious', 'times', 'bit', 'shocking', 'others', 'crude', 'lude', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time.What', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'French', 'Farce', 'however', 'saved', 'acting', 'handsome', 'talented', 'Samuel', 'who', 'straight', 'presence', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'bride', ""be'ssympathetic"", 'jovial', 'mother', 'misguided', 'speech', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'Samuel', 'wedding', 'convoluted', 'situation', 'ram', 'movie', 'rapid', 'pace', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'not', 'trite', 'story', 'Friendships', 'are', 'tested', 'endure', 'love', 'prevails', 'great', 'deal', 'self', 'discovery', 'about', 'fun', 'getting', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'particular', 'language', 'references', 'certain', 'sexual', 'body', 'parts', 'homosexual', 'jokes', 'actions', 'who', 'appear', 'more', 'bull', 'China', 'shop', 'movie', 'have', 'substance', 'as', 'well', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'lack', 'sufficient', 'advertising', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'film', 'achieve', 'heights', 'deserved', 'better']","A Few Best Men (2011) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - Australia ]"
