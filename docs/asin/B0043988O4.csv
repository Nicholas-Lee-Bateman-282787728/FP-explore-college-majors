1384140,AN9J46667D80O,B0043988O4,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[6, 10]","I really like ""Skins"". I liked the first two series quite a bit and the third was... well, still pretty good! But the show seems to have really hit a major speedbump in the fourth series. It had two big problems and those were named Freddy and Effy.Most of series four seemed to center around these two to an unholy degree, and occasionally touched on Cook's relationship with Effy as well. Effy and Freddy (Freffy to some who need to get smacked), dominate a lot of screentime, which would be fine, except that neither them nor their relationship is nearly as interesting as the writers seem to think. What happens to Freddy at the end of the series was especially annoying, as was the fact that the final episode seemed to be two that were mashed together into one.However aside from all that, and that's a pretty big ""aside"", mind you, the series was decent. JJ, Cook, Emily, Naomi, Panda, Thomas and Katie all had pretty decent story arcs, and the acting from almost everyone was good. The trademark humor was there still, at least when it wasn't buried under piles of teen angst.While not as good as series one, two and three, it's still worth watching, and you'll probably have to see it on DVD since it seems unlikely BBC America will still broadcast it.",3,A sharp decline in quality,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1261,"['really', 'Skins', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'quite', 'bit', 'third', 'was', 'well', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'have', 'really', 'hit', 'major', 'speedbump', 'fourth', 'series', 'had', 'two', 'big', 'problems', 'were', 'named', 'Freddy', 'Effy.Most', 'series', 'four', 'seemed', 'center', 'two', 'unholy', 'degree', 'occasionally', 'touched', 'Cook', 'relationship', 'Effy', 'as', 'well', 'Effy', 'Freddy', 'Freffy', 'who', 'need', 'get', 'smacked', 'dominate', 'lot', 'screentime', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'relationship', 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'writers', 'seem', 'think', 'What', 'Freddy', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'especially', 'annoying', 'was', 'fact', 'final', 'episode', 'seemed', 'be', 'two', 'were', 'mashed', 'together', 'one.However', 'aside', 'pretty', 'big', 'aside', 'mind', 'series', 'was', 'decent', 'JJ', 'Cook', 'Emily', 'Naomi', 'Panda', 'Thomas', 'Katie', 'had', 'pretty', 'decent', 'story', 'arcs', 'acting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'was', 'good', 'trademark', 'humor', 'was', 'still', 'least', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'buried', 'piles', 'teen', 'angst.While', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'see', 'DVD', 'unlikely', 'BBC', 'America', 'will', 'still', 'broadcast']","Skins, Vol. 4"
1384141,A1YBSYL6THY865,B0043988O4,"Eden ""Wishful Thinking""","[1, 3]","This Second Generation is great, & personally my favorite. Season 3 was definitely just a warm up to Season 4. This season everyone who is supposed to be together is paired up. Emily & Naomi. Effy & Freddie. Thomas & Pandora. Everything is just wonderful for the cast has the opening of the season starts in a club. The camera lens then follows a girl who was never in season 3, she's taking drugs. She walks the club all alone passing all the happy cast members, dancing & kissing, having laughs. Then all of a sudden she goes upstairs on a railing, standing right on top of it, she falls straight to the ground committing suicide. The whole club & cast are circling around her bloody head & mangled body. She's dead & there's mass pandemonium. Everyone is in awe. No one saw this coming.*First Episode Teaser*This season opens up with Thomas' episode, it is his night at the club & he's taken in for questioning then given money by the club manager. This is when Thomas starts to question things himself & starts to feel wrong about his own lifestyle partying & having sex. He shoves Pandora away, & then goes to his local church to find himself, only there he meets a singer in the choir who can't stop eyeing him. He smiles back then goes to visit her with his siblings. His brother then has an attack of his lungs & is taken to the hospital. That is where he gets fed up with the way everything is treated in the UK. He just misses home, that is what leads him into the arms of the singer. They have sex in a closet, cheating on Pandora. He later tells her in the middle of a movie with JJ. She is devastated but there's nothing left to say. He thinks they're even after what she did with Cook in the Pandora episode of Season 3. But Pandora begs a differ. He goes up to her house & asks her to take him back. She closes the door in his face & that is when, baking poptarts Effy makes her first appearance of the season, comforting Pandora telling her Thomas needs to think about what he's done. The last scene is Thomas crying.*The Rest Of The Season Summary*After this is the episode of Emily. Then Cook. Both these episodes involve the death of the girl in the club who you later come to find out knows Naomi & Cook pretty well. Emily's episode is centered on getting to the bottom of the main reason why the girl killed herself. Cook's episode regards him on trial for beating a crowd at a party in Emily's episode after seeing Freddie & Effy making out on the dance floor. In the meantime, he also opens up about the selling of drugs the night the girl died. Katie's episode is centered around the Fitch family & the sad revelation that she isn't allow to have children. Emily & Pandora both do a bit of brooding in this season due to relationship troubles. There's a lot of cheating going around. The only two love birds throughout the season happen to be Effy & Freddie after Effy decides to give love a chance officially making it clear in this season that she loves Freddie, not Cook. But sooner than later there are signs that there's trouble in paradise, when Freddie finds Effy cutting up pictures & talking about death in his episode. That is when all goes wrong & Freddie is left trying to save Effy from herself, filling in his father's footsteps with his mother's suicide. He goes to everyone he knows terrified asking for advice & never leaves Effy alone because he knows something terrible is about to happen. Effy then attempts suicide & Freddie feels that there's no choice but to let her go. Though that isn't the end for them, Effy gets counciling by an eccentric John Foster who does the weird job of hypotizing Effy into forgetting all her bad memories...This doesn't end well.The season final will have a lot of people disappointed. There's one shocking twist that changes the whole cast forever. Yet I defend the season's material because it keeps the ride to the season finale very interesting. I think it shows guts to take things over the edge, not a lot of shows do what Skins did. & It still has a glorious ending the way it should be. Skins will never cease to surprise you, especially season 4.",5,One Death Changes It All.,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,4132,"['Second', 'Generation', 'great', 'personally', 'favorite', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'definitely', 'just', 'warm', 'up', 'Season', '4', 'season', 'everyone', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'together', 'paired', 'up', 'Emily', 'Naomi', 'Effy', 'Freddie', 'Thomas', 'Pandora', 'Everything', 'just', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'opening', 'season', 'club', 'camera', 'then', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'season', '3', 'taking', 'drugs', 'walks', 'club', 'alone', 'passing', 'happy', 'cast', 'members', 'dancing', 'kissing', 'having', 'laughs', 'Then', 'sudden', 'upstairs', 'railing', 'standing', 'right', 'top', 'straight', 'ground', 'committing', 'suicide', 'whole', 'club', 'cast', 'are', 'circling', 'bloody', 'head', 'mangled', 'body', 'dead', 'mass', 'pandemonium', 'Everyone', 'awe', 'one', 'saw', 'coming', '*First', 'Episode', 'Teaser*This', 'season', 'up', 'Thomas', 'episode', 'night', 'club', 'taken', 'questioning', 'then', 'given', 'money', 'club', 'manager', 'when', 'Thomas', 'question', 'things', 'feel', 'wrong', 'own', 'lifestyle', 'partying', 'having', 'sex', 'Pandora', 'away', 'then', 'local', 'church', 'find', 'only', 'there', 'singer', 'choir', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'eyeing', 'back', 'then', 'visit', 'siblings', 'brother', 'then', 'attack', 'lungs', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'fed', 'up', 'way', 'everything', 'treated', 'UK', 'just', 'home', 'what', 'arms', 'singer', 'have', 'sex', 'closet', 'cheating', 'Pandora', 'later', 'middle', 'movie', 'JJ', 'devastated', 'nothing', 'left', 'say', ""'re"", 'even', 'what', 'did', 'Cook', 'Pandora', 'episode', 'Season', '3', 'Pandora', 'differ', 'up', 'house', 'take', 'back', 'door', 'face', 'when', 'baking', 'poptarts', 'Effy', 'first', 'appearance', 'season', 'comforting', 'Pandora', 'telling', 'Thomas', 'think', 'what', 'done', 'last', 'scene', 'Thomas', 'crying', '*The', 'Rest', 'Season', 'Summary*After', 'episode', 'Emily', 'Then', 'Cook', 'Both', 'episodes', 'involve', 'death', 'girl', 'club', 'who', 'later', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'knows', 'Naomi', 'Cook', 'pretty', 'well', 'Emily', 'episode', 'centered', 'getting', 'bottom', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'girl', 'killed', 'Cook', 'episode', 'trial', 'beating', 'crowd', 'party', 'Emily', 'episode', 'seeing', 'Freddie', 'Effy', 'making', 'out', 'dance', 'floor', 'meantime', 'also', 'up', 'selling', 'drugs', 'night', 'girl', 'died', 'Katie', 'episode', 'centered', 'Fitch', 'family', 'sad', 'revelation', ""n't"", 'allow', 'have', 'children', 'Emily', 'Pandora', 'do', 'bit', 'brooding', 'season', 'due', 'relationship', 'troubles', 'lot', 'cheating', 'going', 'around', 'only', 'two', 'love', 'birds', 'season', 'happen', 'be', 'Effy', 'Freddie', 'Effy', 'give', 'love', 'chance', 'officially', 'making', 'clear', 'season', 'Freddie', 'not', 'Cook', 'sooner', 'later', 'are', 'signs', 'trouble', 'paradise', 'when', 'Freddie', 'Effy', 'cutting', 'up', 'pictures', 'talking', 'death', 'episode', 'when', 'wrong', 'Freddie', 'left', 'trying', 'save', 'Effy', 'filling', 'father', 'footsteps', 'mother', 'suicide', 'everyone', 'terrified', 'asking', 'advice', 'never', 'Effy', 'alone', 'something', 'terrible', 'happen', 'Effy', 'then', 'suicide', 'Freddie', 'choice', 'let', 'go', ""n't"", 'end', 'Effy', 'counciling', 'eccentric', 'John', 'Foster', 'who', 'weird', 'job', 'hypotizing', 'Effy', 'forgetting', 'bad', 'memories', ""n't"", 'end', 'well.The', 'season', 'final', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'people', 'disappointed', 'one', 'shocking', 'twist', 'whole', 'cast', 'forever', 'defend', 'season', 'material', 'ride', 'season', 'finale', 'very', 'interesting', 'think', 'guts', 'take', 'things', 'edge', 'not', 'lot', 'shows', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'still', 'glorious', 'ending', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Skins', 'will', 'never', 'cease', 'surprise', 'especially', 'season', '4']","Skins, Vol. 4"

1384143,A33CKIATHV5I5F,B0043988O4,Ken Jimenez,"[0, 1]","The BBC series Skins is about teens after high school and before college.  All the daily angst suffered by themand the people they love.  Sometimes funny, sometimes very sad always entertaining.  The first two seasons dealwith a group of teens but the school is only two years so at the end they graduate and move on.  The next twoseasons deal with a whole new group of teens except one.  Eff, a sister of the main character in the first twoseasons....there are a whole new group of problems.  I assume that if the show continues, it will have a freshset of faces and problems to deal with.  I admit the drug use and rampant sex in the show may be a little hardto take at times, but it is always interesting and the show does work to a conclusion.

1384144,A1EQ5JEKG8BCFV,B0043988O4,"Midan ""Nerdy Kid""","[5, 6]","Teenage drama ""Skins"" is about the evolution of misguided teens -- some of them are violent, others are mentally ill, and the rest are just... lost. I started watching ""Skins"" in April 2010, and I became instantly hooked on the series. Not only was it brilliantly structured, well-acted, and extremely bizarre, but the morals were there. I read reviews in the past on the show saying that it was despicable, and that parents and teens should both avoid the series. Trust me, it is revealing, but that is the beauty of the British teen drama: nothing is held back (and I mean nothing!).Generation One - Classy, wild, determined. The characters were wild, but there was a precedent with the characters. Although they did drugs, had sex, and went to ravenous parties during all hours of the night, they knew it was something they'd outgrow. Some characters did, earlier than others actually, while others didn't. The storylines were based around love, family issues, mental illness, and death. So the question becomes, how can you outdo this for future shows?They decided to keep the cast fresh (which at first I HATED because of my love for the first generation) but then I fell in love with the second generation. It was a complete surprise, given that I waited almost a year before watching it, but I am extremely glad I did.Like real life, ""Skins"" became darker, wilder, and extremely heartbreaking. The characters were even more lovable than the original (I love them all, but hey, the new is the new, right?) which kept the show interesting. The stories more WAAAAAY more intense, the relationships were deadly (yes, deadly), and it was a struggle for us as viewers to connect with them, because -- at times -- we either found ourselves hating them, or loving them. Overall the series was brilliant!Season Four focuses on the death of a young woman who structures the final season for generation two. Not only are lives ruined, but some of the characters end up in a darker place than before -- struggling to find a way out.If you love watching reality, through a teenager's eyes, this is the show for you!On your mark, get set, GO WATCH SKINS (ALL OF THE SEASONS!)***P.S.***Due to the surprise of generation two, I might not hesitate on the third! :)",5,Skins -- All About Evolution,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,2254,"['Teenage', 'drama', 'Skins', 'evolution', 'misguided', 'teens', 'are', 'violent', 'others', 'are', 'mentally', 'ill', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'lost', 'started', 'watching', 'Skins', 'April', '2010', 'became', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'series', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'structured', 'well-acted', 'extremely', 'bizarre', 'morals', 'were', 'there', 'read', 'reviews', 'past', 'show', 'saying', 'was', 'despicable', 'parents', 'teens', 'should', 'avoid', 'series', 'Trust', 'revealing', 'beauty', 'British', 'teen', 'drama', 'nothing', 'held', 'back', 'mean', 'nothing', '.Generation', 'One', 'Classy', 'wild', 'determined', 'characters', 'were', 'wild', 'there', 'was', 'precedent', 'characters', 'did', 'drugs', 'had', 'sex', 'went', 'ravenous', 'parties', 'hours', 'night', 'knew', 'was', 'something', ""'d"", 'outgrow', 'characters', 'did', 'earlier', 'others', 'actually', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'storylines', 'were', 'based', 'love', 'family', 'issues', 'mental', 'illness', 'death', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'outdo', 'future', 'shows', 'decided', 'keep', 'cast', 'fresh', 'first', 'HATED', 'love', 'first', 'generation', 'then', 'fell', 'love', 'second', 'generation', 'was', 'complete', 'surprise', 'given', 'waited', 'almost', 'year', 'watching', 'am', 'extremely', 'glad', 'did.Like', 'real', 'life', 'Skins', 'became', 'darker', 'wilder', 'extremely', 'heartbreaking', 'characters', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'lovable', 'original', 'love', 'hey', 'new', 'new', 'right', 'kept', 'show', 'interesting', 'stories', 'more', 'WAAAAAY', 'more', 'intense', 'relationships', 'were', 'deadly', 'yes', 'deadly', 'was', 'struggle', 'viewers', 'connect', 'because', 'times', 'found', 'hating', 'loving', 'Overall', 'series', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Season', 'Four', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'final', 'season', 'generation', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'lives', 'ruined', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'darker', 'place', 'before', 'struggling', 'find', 'way', 'love', 'watching', 'reality', 'teenager', 'eyes', 'show', 'mark', 'get', 'set', 'GO', 'WATCH', 'SKINS', 'ALL', 'THE', 'SEASONS', '***P.S', '***Due', 'surprise', 'generation', 'two', 'might', 'not', 'hesitate', 'third']","Skins, Vol. 4"
