But it's surprisingly funny and well done. However, the problem that films in this genre always have is that they are, ultimately, about either the tragedy or the comedy, or both, of pimping and whoring.People in the movie business, and some movie enthusiasts in the know, find this kind of backstage story great fun. But the audience doesn't seem to care for the implication that they are dolts and marks being gamed by various users and predators in the Hollywood system, who may just coincidentally have made films that the audience loves. In any case, it's worth a view, even if you have to deal with Meg's post surgery face -- she's so cute, can't she just be cute and older, instead of botoxed, lifted, implanted, stretched and embalmed.

There's suppose to be a quirky insider look at the movie making industry but, alas, nothing anyone born after 1930 doesn't already know.

Disaster follows disaster until it is all one great mess, which I assume is supposed to be amusing.There's a good cast of Macy, Meg Ryan, Elliot Gould, et al., but even a good cast can't make this amusing to anyone except Hollywood insiders.

1178632,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001D264TU,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 15]","""The Deal"" is a light comedy with a bit of romance and satire thrown in. It follows the story of one Charlie Burns (William H. Macy, who also co-wrote the screenplay), a failed Hollywood film producer, who uses his nephew's period-piece script (about 19th century British writer and statesman Benjamin Disraeli) for his ""comeback."" While Charlie struggles to get what he wants (sometimes by cheating and lying), he meets a beautiful studio executive Deidre (Meg Ryan). I almost forgot to say that Charlie is a lady's man, too.I am always interested in the ""films about filmmaking"" sub-genre. You know, there are so many of them - ""Adaptation"" ""Bowfinger"" etc - and some are great (""Day for Night"") and some terrible (""An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn"" ... what else?). Thanks to the cast (that includes Elliot Gould as rabbi and L.L. Cool J. as spoiled action star), ""The Deal"" is mildly amusing, but the film's satire is not sharp and the jokes are not very funny.Don't get me wrong. I like Meg Ryan and William H. Macy. But somehow it seems they are not the right choice for the roles they are playing in ""The Deal."" There is no chemistry between the two leads to make me believe that they fall in love with each other. Besides, the story itself doesn't convince me. How can a down-and-out film producer like Charlie get a 100 million dollar action movie greenlit when everyone in Hollywood knows he has been unsuccessful so long?All in all ""The Deal"" is not that bad, at least to me, but it has no originality either, except the location of South Africa.
