Harry Connick Jr stars as a father who has to come to grips with a sad time in his life and do the same for his son.  Moving to a new neighborhood which is on a world famous street known for its Christmas decorations is tough for Connick, a man who doesn't put up decorations, to deal with.  The whole community goes overboard for the Holidays and after some self revelations and wise advice from a mysterious friend Willie Nelson, he joins in.  It has humor, tears and music for everybody.",4,Nice Christmas Story For the Whole Family,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,566,"['Well', 'done', 'family', 'Christmas', 'story', 'talent', 'packed', 'cast', 'good', 'music', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'father', 'who', 'come', 'grips', 'sad', 'time', 'life', 'do', 'same', 'son', 'Moving', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'world', 'famous', 'street', 'known', 'Christmas', 'decorations', 'tough', 'Connick', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'decorations', 'deal', 'whole', 'community', 'overboard', 'Holidays', 'self', 'revelations', 'wise', 'advice', 'mysterious', 'friend', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'humor', 'tears', 'music', 'everybody']",Angels Sing

One reason that I love to watch stories around Christmas themes is that usually the whole family can watch it and enjoy it.  I hate the soft porn movies that are put out which are labeled as entertainment for the family.I really liked almost all of this movie.  My only complaint is that this is supposed to be a Christmas movie with nothing about Christ or the true meaning of Christmas even mentioned.  We have become a society that tolerates everything but no tolerance for Christian beliefs.  When did we change?The storyline, as a whole, is good.  The acting is good.  The singing is great.

1671861,A3ODENXA668OR,B00FKPHNF0,Markus Rexon,"[1, 1]","Even though I'm not really one to watch Family-gender movies, I found this one to be really enjoyable. Usually, I find Family moves to be a little ""kiddish"", but this one is sure to appeal to all ages. The acting is pretty good, the characters are nicely developed, and we even see Willie himself. But those aren't the most important aspects of a movie: the plot and felling of a film is the most important, and it seems that the producers really maxed that out with this one. There is a rather tragic event that happens, and threatens to make a certain person very bitter. But like any good movie, everything turns out good in the end, even if things almost went completely wrong. I'm pretty sure that most viewers will find this story heartwarming, fun and simply wonderful. Probably can be said to be one of the best Family/Christmas movies around. It just doesn't ""blend in"" with other family-oriented films. It really stands out as a great film.
