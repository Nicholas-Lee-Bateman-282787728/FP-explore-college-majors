342742,AY12DBB0U420B,6302877725,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Whoopi Goldberg has long been one of my favorite actresses. She's an excellent comedian too. When I see her on TV talk shows, she's personable and interesting. I think I'd enjoy knowing her as a person. As such, when I spotted ""Whoopi Goldberg Collection"" of four DVDs in a pack on a bargain shelf, I snapped it up in an instant. Can you imagine? Four Whoopi Goldberg movies for under eight bucks! Which should I watch first? Well, the DVDs are printed on both sides so there's no label and the only inscription is practically microscopic and our lighting is poor. Does it really matter? I started with the top one. It was ""Clara's Heart.""""Clara's Heart"" was an acceptable movie, without question, but I was very disappointed with it. The filming and the sound was good, and I have no complaints. The acting was stiff, however, and the characters didn't come to life. The story involved a well-to-do family (Mother, Father, young boy. and a recently-deceased baby daughter) with Goldberg acting as a live-in Jamaican housekeeper in Baltimore. Both the mother and father seemed self-absorbed and distant and were not sympathetic characters, in any way. The boy came across as a hard-to-like nerd. Even Goldberg didn't fit smoothly into this awkward situation and then the couple divorced. I might add, that even the two new mates of the parents were distant and unlikable. It's hard to enjoy a movie like this. With whom do you identify? What is the point of it all? Some reviewers remarked about how sad the movie was and to have plenty of tissues handy. I experienced more boredom than sorrow. Others wondered why this movie hadn't been released in DVD format (actually, it has but as a part of this four-movie pack). Well, it just wasn't a very good Goldberg movie and maybe that's why it wasn't released. In any case, it was a totally acceptable movie, but it wasn't up to the Goldberg standard that I expected.Gary Peterson",3,"Good, But Not Up To The Goldberg Standard.",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,1927,"['Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'excellent', 'comedian', 'too', 'When', 'see', 'TV', 'talk', 'shows', 'personable', 'interesting', 'think', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'knowing', 'person', 'such', 'when', 'spotted', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Collection', 'four', 'DVDs', 'pack', 'bargain', 'shelf', 'snapped', 'up', 'instant', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Four', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'movies', 'eight', 'bucks', 'Which', 'should', 'watch', 'first', 'Well', 'DVDs', 'are', 'printed', 'sides', 'label', 'only', 'inscription', 'practically', 'microscopic', 'lighting', 'poor', 'really', 'matter', 'started', 'top', 'one', 'was', 'Clara', 'Heart', 'Clara', 'Heart', 'was', 'acceptable', 'movie', 'question', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'filming', 'sound', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'complaints', 'acting', 'was', 'stiff', 'however', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'life', 'story', 'involved', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'Mother', 'Father', 'young', 'boy', 'recently-deceased', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Goldberg', 'acting', 'live-in', 'Jamaican', 'housekeeper', 'Baltimore', 'mother', 'father', 'seemed', 'self-absorbed', 'distant', 'were', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'way', 'boy', 'came', 'hard-to-like', 'nerd', 'Even', 'Goldberg', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'smoothly', 'awkward', 'situation', 'then', 'couple', 'divorced', 'might', 'add', 'even', 'two', 'new', 'mates', 'parents', 'were', 'distant', 'unlikable', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'whom', 'do', 'identify', 'What', 'point', 'reviewers', 'remarked', 'how', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'have', 'plenty', 'tissues', 'handy', 'experienced', 'more', 'boredom', 'sorrow', 'Others', 'wondered', 'why', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'format', 'actually', 'part', 'four-movie', 'pack', 'Well', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Goldberg', 'movie', 'maybe', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'case', 'was', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'Goldberg', 'standard', 'expected.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A
342743,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,6302877725,Kristopher Haines,"[3, 4]","This film is more than it wants to be. The critic and cynic in me would gleefully join Mr. Marshall Fine in enumerating the many ways this film tries to manipulate its audience. First on my list would be the score by Dave Grusin which acts as a musical leash to pull the audience where they probably would have gone anyway. But that is where I will stop, because although the film does everything in its power to convince us it's the cinematic equivalent of Prozac, it betrays this image by containing subtle, powerful insights that set it apart from its saccharine ilk. There IS something different here, you just have to know where to look. Its not so much about what Clara does for David, a lot of his problems remain after her departure... What is special about ""Clara's Heart"" is that its about the indestructible bond that unites two people. Clara was there for David when he needed her but she did not, could not, and would not clap her hands together and say something to the effect of: ""my work is done."" In so many other films like this things are ""set right"" because of a character's influence. Not so here. Clara does not embark upon a project she can finish. What she does is bring David to a point where he can continue on his own, though he does not feel that way at the time. The ""powerful force"" that Clara speaks of is not diminished by time or space. A movie that celebrates that kind of bond (which absolutely CAN exist) does not deserve to be dismissed as easily as the rest.",3,"""A Powerful Force""",1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,1496,"['film', 'more', 'be', 'critic', 'cynic', 'would', 'gleefully', 'join', 'Mr.', 'Marshall', 'Fine', 'enumerating', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'First', 'list', 'would', 'be', 'score', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'musical', 'leash', 'pull', 'audience', 'where', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'anyway', 'where', 'will', 'stop', 'film', 'everything', 'power', 'convince', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'Prozac', 'image', 'containing', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'insights', 'set', 'apart', 'saccharine', 'ilk', 'something', 'different', 'here', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Clara', 'David', 'lot', 'problems', 'remain', 'departure', 'What', 'special', 'Clara', 'Heart', 'indestructible', 'bond', 'two', 'people', 'Clara', 'was', 'David', 'when', 'needed', 'did', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'clap', 'hands', 'together', 'say', 'something', 'effect', 'work', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'right', 'character', 'influence', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'Clara', 'not', 'embark', 'project', 'can', 'finish', 'What', 'bring', 'David', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'continue', 'own', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'time', 'powerful', 'force', 'Clara', 'speaks', 'not', 'diminished', 'time', 'space', 'movie', 'kind', 'bond', 'absolutely', 'CAN', 'exist', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'dismissed', 'as', 'easily', 'rest']",N/A
342744,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302877725,Lawyeraau,"[2, 2]","This is a beautifully textured film about Clara Mayfield, a Jamaican care-giver, and David Hart, the troubled young boy who is her sole charge. He is the son of Leona and Bill Hart, two self-absorbed individuals whose marriage is crumbling all around them.Clara takes care of David and with her warm, motherly personality gives him the succor he craves, helping him with the pain of being emotionally bereft. He, in turn, loves her unconditionally and is even given to speaking patois, cementing the strong bond between them. Without his knowing it, he helps her to come to terms with her own pain and terrible secret.Whoopi Goldberg is a wonderful actress who gives rich dimension to the role of Clara Mayfield, infusing her with an intelligence, wisdom, and warmth that is palpable. Just beneath the surface, however, one senses a tremendous desolation that becomes clear at the end, when her terrible secret  is revealed. Whoopi also captures the rhythm of the lilting Jamaican accent and gets the patois down pat. It is one of her most memorable roles.Neil Patrick Harris is terrific in the role of David,  making his love for Clara believable and touching. His integration into Clara's Jamaican world is also moving, as he seeks to find a place he can truly call home. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and he even learns to speak a respectable Jamaican patois. All this, however, cannot stop his parents from claiming him in the end.Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as the coolly detached, yuppie mother, while Michael Ontkean resonates as the ambitious and driven yuppie father. They epitomize the kind of parents who are well meaning but too self-absorbed to see the effect that their actions have on their children or that their children have emotional needs of their own that need attention.All in all, this is a sensational movie and one in which Whoopi Goldberg leaves her mark. It is a film lovingly directed by Robert Mulligan (To Kill a Mockingbird, Up the Down Staircase, The Other) and should be seen by all discerning film lovers.

342748,A12WE3MP6QF04,6302877725,"""nanabush""","[12, 14]","The reason why l love this film so much is the performance of Academy Award-winner, Whoopi Goldberg.  People tend to label her a gifted comedienne but that`s not all she is, as this film proves.  In the role of  Clara Mayfield, Whoopi Goldberg recaptures the spirit and beauty of her  award-winning portrayal of Celie from &quot;The Colour Purple&quot;.  As l  sat watching this film, l was mesmerized by her.  And newcomer, Neil  Patrick Harris` Golden Globe-nominated performance as David is equally  powerful.  The dramatic score is another plus.  Sweeping notes from the  piano, flute and mandolin are enchanting to listen to and they only add  more beautiful textures to the film.  Now that l`ve explained what l love  about the actors and score, l should tell you a little bit about the story.  The film is basically about Jamaican housekeeper, Clara Mayfield (Whoopi  Goldberg), who comes into the life of a troubled young boy named David  (Neil Patrick Harris).  David is a young man caught in the middle of his  parents` messy divorce.  I'm sure a lot of people out there can relate to  this story.  Clara is the one who helps David confront his pain, and in  turn the two develop a strong bond of friendship and love.  I highly  recommend this film which is filled with terrific performances, especially  by the talented Whoopi Goldberg.
