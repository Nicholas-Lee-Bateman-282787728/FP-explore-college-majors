My wife had never viewed any of the Matrix movies before and though  watching 2 & 3 first without her seeing the first one she still enjoyed them overall. Was a bit confusing for her in the beginning but she got the over-all idea. Her only criticism was of the the Kung-Fu fighting scenes. which I loved. She said it was to much like being at the Opera or Ballet. I personally could have used a bit more blood ( it is a R rated film, was more like a PG to me.)I'll now have to wait for when the first Matrix Blue-Ray goes on sale to complete the trilogy.

I like the fact for this set I could get just the movies, in one package for cheap.The case / package is really ""budget"" (aka - cheap) but for this price they obviously had to cut corners and cost.  So for those of you looking for Steelbook quality in the packaging look elsewhere... the packaging is low budget.Another plus here is the Blu Ray transfer - it is very good.
