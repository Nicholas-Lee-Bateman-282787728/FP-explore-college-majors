I fully expected to turn it off part-way in.  However, I found that though there were gory scenes, the characters themselves were very interesting.  Denzel Washington is superb as Lincoln Rhyme who appears to have resigned himself to his physical limitations, yet becomes intrigued by this case despite himself.  Angelina Jolie plays a young cop with quiet sorrow and more humanity than some of her other roles.  She deftly portrays her character wrestling with her fear in order to learn what she needs to help catch a killer.  Queen Latifah is delightful as usual.I think the poor reviews here might reflect the disappointment in the less than spectacular climax of the movie with the revelation of the killer and his/her (so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it) motives.I liked it though.  It was less complicated perhaps than Silence of the Lambs or Seven (though in Seven it was all about the killings themselves not the killers real motives. The motive was covered in about 3 lines of dialogue as though it didn't really matter. Can you tell I really dislike that movie?), but it made enough sense psychologically.See it, rent it first if you're not sure you'll like it, but buy it ... .",4,"Very good, quite suspenseful",981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,1311,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'gory', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'fully', 'expected', 'turn', 'off', 'part-way', 'However', 'found', 'were', 'gory', 'scenes', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'superb', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'who', 'have', 'resigned', 'physical', 'limitations', 'yet', 'becomes', 'intrigued', 'case', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'young', 'cop', 'quiet', 'sorrow', 'more', 'humanity', 'other', 'roles', 'deftly', 'character', 'wrestling', 'fear', 'order', 'learn', 'what', 'help', 'catch', 'killer', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'delightful', 'usual.I', 'think', 'poor', 'reviews', 'here', 'might', 'reflect', 'disappointment', 'less', 'spectacular', 'climax', 'movie', 'revelation', 'killer', 'his/her', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'liked', 'was', 'less', 'complicated', 'perhaps', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Seven', 'Seven', 'was', 'killings', 'not', 'killers', 'real', 'motives', 'motive', 'was', 'covered', 'about', '3', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Can', 'tell', 'really', 'dislike', 'movie', 'made', 'enough', 'sense', 'psychologically.See', 'rent', 'first', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'like', 'buy']",N/A

The  psychopath theme is so well known, that every new movie can be linked to an  older one. In this case, there are similarities with a lot of movies.  Rutger Hauer's Bone Daddy springs to mind, but Silence of the Lambs, Evil  has a Face and a lot of others also contributed. Still, th Bone Collector  holds enough new elements to be interesting. The characters are worked out  rather better then usual and the gruesome details of the murders are  treated with less then the normal circumspection. The movie is borne by the  actors, not by the script, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The one  point, that I really disliked is the final scene. The 'everything comes  right at Christmas' idea is already too sentimental for my taste and in a  movie like this it does not have a place.

I also saw Silence of the Lambs and Seven and this one definitely doesn't compare with those.  But if you don't want to spend two hours  picking the movie apart, and if you'll remember that this is fiction and  not intended to be scientifically perfect, this is an entertaining movie.  The two main characters are fairly well developed, which I think is the  intention of the movie.  No, the killer really isn't an overwhelming  presence in the movie, but I don't think that is what was intended here.  I  really think the movie was more about the relationship which developed  between the two lead characters, which it does seem to cover fairly well.  They do seem to go from clashing with each other, to mutual respect, and  then to love.  Denzel Washington's character does at first seem to know too  much, but when you remember that he has read thousands of book, written  twelve, and collected pieces of whatever for his research, it does seem  logical that he would be such an expert.  Angelina Jolie's character does  seem that she will develop into a worthy successor in the field of  forensics.

68656,AUDIJM3VUULS7,0783240295,Charles Tatum,"[2, 2]","Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie get caught up in a thriller more complicated than ""Seven,"" and not as good.Washington is a paralyzed former New York CIty detective who can only move his head and one index finger. He is confined to a bed after an on the job accident and is cared for by nurse Queen Latifah. Angelina Jolie is a young cop trying to make it in the youth services division in the NYPD. She is running from personal demons of her own, including the suicide of her cop father.By chance, Jolie is the first on the scene of a gruesome discovery. As we have seen earlier, a wealthy couple is kidnapped by a rogue cabbie. The man's remains are found, and the killer leaves clues to where the woman is. Washington runs a miniature precinct out of his apartment, using his limited physical attributes to investigate and using Jolie to see what he would normally see. The team begins trailing the killer, trying to piece together the clues left at the crime scene. They are stopped at every turn by clicheed angry detective Michael Rooker, who keeps reminding everyone Washington is no longer a cop. After more bodies turn up, the climax involves the deaths of many characters, as the killer takes a roundabout way of trying to off the helpless Washington.The other murders in here are almost unnecessary since the original intent of the story is to put Washington in danger to begin with. The killer is not easily guessed because the film makers throw in all sorts of red herring suspects, but by the end you probably will not care all that much.Washington and Jolie are very good here. Jolie gets some background characterization, which helps explain her bitterness, and it takes her a while to warm up to Washington. Washington is also good in a physically limited role, using his facial expressions to relate to the audience. His frequent seizures are convincing. The rest of the cast mostly runs around with their guns drawn, quipping with Washington on down time. A special mention should go to Queen Latifah. I am not her biggest fan, but she won me over as the tough nurse whose primary responsibility is to her patient. This may be her best work yet.The killings are based on old New York City history, and some of that is interesting. With this serial killer genre of film, the film makers do take logical leaps in trying to solve the crimes that most crime audiences may have a problem swallowing. The crimes are so overcomplicated and really do not make much sense, considering the killer's final motive. Of course, the killer confesses everything in the climax, including why, and I thought this whole sequence was very weak.Director Noyce does a standard job with his camera, although I liked a lot of the shots of NYC we do not normally see, including the World Trade Center. The music is appropriately suspenseful, as is the cinematography.In the end, ""The Bone Collector"" is strictly suspense by committee. The great actors they enlisted almost make up for the shoddy story and ""seen it before"" feel that you are left with. If anyone else had been cast in this, it would have been a serious flop. As it is, this is a B movie serial killer flick dressed up with onscreen talent. The film makers failed to back the cast up with something the audience could jump at. I slightly do not recommend this.This is (R) for physical violence, gun violence, gore, and profanity.",3,Phillip Noyce's The Bone Collector,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,3406,"['Oscar', 'winners', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'thriller', 'more', 'complicated', 'Seven', 'not', 'good.Washington', 'paralyzed', 'former', 'New', 'York', 'CIty', 'detective', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'move', 'head', 'one', 'index', 'finger', 'confined', 'bed', 'job', 'accident', 'cared', 'nurse', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'young', 'cop', 'trying', 'make', 'youth', 'services', 'division', 'NYPD', 'running', 'personal', 'demons', 'own', 'including', 'suicide', 'cop', 'father.By', 'chance', 'Jolie', 'first', 'scene', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'kidnapped', 'rogue', 'cabbie', 'man', 'remains', 'are', 'found', 'killer', 'clues', 'where', 'woman', 'Washington', 'miniature', 'apartment', 'using', 'limited', 'physical', 'attributes', 'investigate', 'using', 'Jolie', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'team', 'trailing', 'killer', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'left', 'crime', 'scene', 'are', 'stopped', 'turn', 'clicheed', 'angry', 'detective', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'who', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'Washington', 'no', 'longer', 'cop', 'more', 'bodies', 'turn', 'up', 'climax', 'deaths', 'many', 'characters', 'killer', 'roundabout', 'way', 'trying', 'helpless', 'Washington.The', 'other', 'murders', 'here', 'are', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'original', 'intent', 'story', 'put', 'Washington', 'danger', 'begin', 'killer', 'not', 'easily', 'guessed', 'film', 'makers', 'throw', 'sorts', 'red', 'herring', 'suspects', 'end', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'care', 'much.Washington', 'Jolie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Jolie', 'background', 'characterization', 'explain', 'bitterness', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'also', 'good', 'physically', 'limited', 'role', 'using', 'facial', 'expressions', 'relate', 'audience', 'frequent', 'seizures', 'are', 'convincing', 'rest', 'cast', 'mostly', 'guns', 'drawn', 'quipping', 'Washington', 'down', 'time', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'won', 'over', 'tough', 'nurse', 'primary', 'responsibility', 'patient', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'yet.The', 'killings', 'are', 'based', 'old', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'history', 'interesting', 'serial', 'killer', 'genre', 'film', 'film', 'makers', 'do', 'take', 'logical', 'leaps', 'trying', 'solve', 'crimes', 'most', 'crime', 'audiences', 'may', 'have', 'problem', 'swallowing', 'crimes', 'are', 'so', 'overcomplicated', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'considering', 'killer', 'final', 'motive', 'course', 'killer', 'everything', 'climax', 'including', 'why', 'thought', 'whole', 'sequence', 'was', 'very', 'weak.Director', 'Noyce', 'standard', 'job', 'camera', 'liked', 'lot', 'shots', 'NYC', 'do', 'not', 'normally', 'see', 'including', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'music', 'appropriately', 'suspenseful', 'cinematography.In', 'end', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'strictly', 'suspense', 'committee', 'great', 'actors', 'enlisted', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'shoddy', 'story', 'seen', 'feel', 'are', 'left', 'anyone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'flop', 'B', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick', 'dressed', 'up', 'onscreen', 'talent', 'film', 'makers', 'failed', 'back', 'cast', 'up', 'something', 'audience', 'could', 'jump', 'slightly', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'this.This', 'R', 'physical', 'violence', 'gun', 'violence', 'gore', 'profanity']",N/A

68668,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783240295,D. Litton,"[5, 7]","In watching &quot;The Bone Collector,&quot; I wasn't looking for anything original or genuine. Anyone who has seen enough thrillers about serial killers knows that all the aspects of the genre have pretty much been played down to the bare bones, and even those are being made into movies as well. What makes &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; interesting is its intensity and its characters, as well as the acting effort put forth in making the movie come alive. So what if it's not all that original? It's still a shockingl intense piece of filmmaking, and that alone makes it worthwhile.The plot is pretty routine: a killer begins taking lives and leaving clues behind for the police to find, weaving an intricate puzzle of mystery and chills. The police detective in charge of the case is Lincoln Rhyme, a top homicide investigator and author of crime books who became a quadriplegic through an accident on the job. The movie chooses to take this character and build on him immensely (you'd think there'd be no where to go with the material with his one position being in his sick bed, but you'll be surprised). He has a lot to build on with his knowledge of crime and how killers work, so his intelligence and education guide the movie along its routine plot in a new and exciting fashion.While he must remain on the inside, he chooses a beat cop by the name of Amelia Donaghy to take the assignment of assessing the indivisual crime scenes and relaying the look and feel of the place back to him, all the while taking on the duties of gathering evidence and clues and bringing them to his attention. From the beginning of their acquaintance, it's clear that this is going to be a rocky road. Donaghy feels she is not adequate for the job, or the stomach, while Rhyme knows she has the potential to carry on with the task. Their collaboration and onscreen time together are the most enjoyable parts of the film.Through the clues the killer keeps leaving at each crime scene, they discover the location and nature of the next crime, arriving too little too late to save the victims from death. Their penetrations into the remaining evidence leads them to the realization that the killer is following the murders in a book titled &quot;The Bone Collector,&quot; and their finding of this book is what sparks the final climax that comes as a bit of a shock, and does have its surprises.The movie is not the most original piece ever to be filmed, and this must be realized in order to enjoy the movie. It has the regular features of a movie of this sort: the intelligent detective and the cop under his wing (one original twist here is that the cop ends up doing all the work, and the detective doesn't try to take all the credit), the bungling cops who don't believe for a minute the findings of the cop/detective team, a killer who leaves hints and clues only to kill more people without mercy. The story pattern here is pretty routine, I will admit that, but if you can set aside your need for a fresh new story and just enjoy this movie for its thrills and intensity, then you won't be disappointed.Thrills and intensity are all but absent here, keeping the movie moving at a nice steady pace the quickens when the plot requires it to. These two elements, plot and suspense, work extremely well together, and have a certain lingo to which they stick. In moments of intense action, the suspense is fast and incredible, while scenes that move slower have a gradual build of suspense that provides a healthy balance for its audience. For the amount of unoriginal material in this story, the movie does quite well for itself in making is watchable and suspenseful.Of course, the big mystery of this film is finding out who the killer is, and what his motives are for lashing out in such a gruesome way. This is the best aspect of the story, because the killer ends up being the last person in the world you would think to guess at. Also comes the fact that the killer may or may not be involved in Rhyme's life, which is another suspense builder which keeps you guessing until the brutal climax. Even the ending itself is a bit routine, but hey, with all that's happened in this film, is seems to work with the material, and that's more than enough to recommend it.Our key characters here are played by superb actors who each have unique qualities and attributes to offer to their roles. Denzel Washington, perhaps one of the most accomplished actors ever, plays Lincoln Rhyme, and he makes the role much more involved and important than any other actor would just lying in a bed spouting out gibberish. He makes us believe in Rhyme's struggle to keep himself alive by keeping up with his work. Angelina Jolie is stunning as Amelia Donaghy, bringing strength and emotion to her role. She portrays her character as strong yet weak, a woman whose need to get the job done does not provide for much of an emotional outlet. Queen Latifah makes an appearance as Rhyme's nurse, and although she doesn't have much to do here, she does offer what she can in advancing the script comically and sometimes intelligently.&quot;The Bone Collector&quot; is unoriginal, uninspired, and routine, but it takes the same old material and gives it a nice treatment, certainly worth more than my fellow critics would have you think. It is able to keep a high momentum throughout its discourse, allowing for some very high tension and suspense, all anchored together by the powerful performances of Washington and Jolie, who have a unique chemistry onscreen. If you can set aside your need for something new, this movie does work on more than one level, and proves itself worthy of recommendation.",5,Who needs originality?,969753600,"09 24,

68672,A3VQLTB724O77W,0783240295,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[2, 3]","The Bone Collector is two movies in one; the good movie has some nice acting from Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, some creepy special effects, and a couple of really terrifying and suspenseful moments for the killer's victims.  That's the movie you'll want to suspend your disbelief for--and that suspension would consist solely of accepting that this serial killer would leave clues to engage the police in a game of Cat and Mouse rather than just go directly for his real target.  That fictional convention would have been enough, and had the premise that forensics will triumph been followed though, the film could have been truly excellent.The other movie just asks too much; that a patrol cop who's never worked a crime scene would be the only policeperson allowed on a scene; that the scene of a crime would reveal only those clues intentionally left behind by the killer (isn't that the whole point of forensics, that you find out things the killer didn't intend you to discover?); and on and on.  This second movie apparently takes place on that alternate Earth on the opposite side of the sun from ours, where the writing is all backwards and the superhero the Flash looks like the FTD florist's logo.  When audience members find themselves thinking (or saying aloud) &quot;That wouldn't happen!&quot; over and over, there's something drastically wrong with the plot and the screenplay.  It's certainly not a problem unique to the Bone Collector; in fact I'd venture to guess that plot implausibility is one of the leading cause of death for Hollywood's hit status, only capable of being overcome by the infusion of massive star power.  Washington and Jolie, as attractive as they are, don't quite make it here.  All in all, The Bone Collector is probably worth renting, probably not worth owning.

Both put on an awesome performance.  This movie will easily ... scare the [daylights] out of you.Denzel Washington is a crime scene specialist that is forced to retire after a life threatening accident at the scene of a crime.  After a very gruesome murder, he becomes intrigued with the officer that is first on the scene to the murder, Angelina Jolie.  He tells her that she walked the scene like a special crime unit agent and pulls some strings to have her investigate the murder.  After a second horrifying murder, Denzel realizes that they are dealing with a serial killer.  The police needing his help, set up shop in his loft and Denzel then orders that Angelina will be the scene investigator.  It's a horrifying, freaky, thrill ride from start to finish.This is easily one of my favorites (behind Silence of the Lambs and Copy Cat).  This movie totally [scared me] and each one of the murders is intense, creapy and totally different from the last.  I assure each murder will [scare you].  This movie is ten times more horrifying than any other thrill that I've seen and honestly, it was great in that respect because this movie came out kind of in between the whole rebirth of slashers and it was a great throw back from all that stuff.Angelina and Denzel really show some true ability in this one as well.  She totally earns some respect in this one and she really becomes her character.  And Denzel, as usual, is great in this one.  Along with a great supporting cast, the on screen factor of this movie is also very great.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves thrillers, mysteries and there's also some drama in this one as well.

68681,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783240295,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 3]","This intelligent crime story is an excellent addition to the genre. It combines some time honored plot elements with some nuances and twists to provide an effective and intriguing story that has viewers wracking their  brains along with the characters to figure out &quot;who done it&quot;.I  was prepared to dislike this film when I rented it because I've  increasingly felt that the politically correct crowd in Hollywood has gone  overboard lately in their use of films as diversity training for the  masses. I was expecting preachy subtext about how the handicapped can be  heroes too. Though that message was inherent in the fact that the hero was  a quadriplegic, I came away feeling that the disability was an essential  plot element and was not used for shameless sermonizing.The quadriplegic  element was actually an effective novelty in a genre that is often  criticized (as was this film) for its lack of originality. The story's  calculating serial killer with a very specific motive was a welcome change  from oft used psychopath on the rampage. So, unlike many who have  excoriated this script for lacking freshness, I felt it had a lot of good  angles that distinguished it in a genre that has been greatly over plowed.  Though a novel murder mystery is as hard to come by as a novel romance,  that doesn't mean that such familiar themes can no longer be  entertaining.Director Phillip Noyce combines mystery, suspense, and  graphic violence and delivers the total package with great impact. He is  extremely effective in his use of the camera to heighten the effect of  scenes through extreme close ups, top down shots and interesting  perspective shots. His use of sound is also very compelling as on numerous  occasions I found myself startled right out of my seat (having the DTS  version of the DVD probably enhanced this effect). The underground sets  were fantastic and lent an eerie reality to the historic broken down  locations where the crimes were set.The acting by Denzel Washington was  first rate. He is particularly effective in thoughtful, intelligent roles  where his character has to think his way through the film while dealing  with emotional baggage. This was a particularly difficult role because he  had to deliver the impact of the character without the use of his body,  making his facial expressions and voice his only dramatic weapons. Given  these constraints, he did an outstanding job of presenting a dynamic and  powerful portrayal.Angelina Jolie has proven once again that she is a  serious dramatic talent. She consistently eschews the fluffy girlie roles  to take on difficult characters. She was hard as nails and convincing as  the intuitive forensics cop. It was she who made the chemistry work between  Lincoln and Amelia by creating an emotional barrier of spiteful cynicism  and then slowly letting it down as Lincoln gained her respect. She has the  range to effectively portray grit and vulnerability in the same character  which is no small order.I gave this film a 9/10. As crime dramas go, it  was terrific. The graphic violence is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a  good taut murder mystery, you can't go wrong with this film.",5,Excellent detective story,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,3191,"['intelligent', 'crime', 'story', 'excellent', 'addition', 'genre', 'time', 'honored', 'plot', 'elements', 'nuances', 'twists', 'provide', 'effective', 'intriguing', 'story', 'viewers', 'wracking', 'brains', 'characters', 'figure', 'out', 'quot', 'who', 'done', 'quot', 'was', 'prepared', 'dislike', 'film', 'when', 'rented', ""'ve"", 'increasingly', 'felt', 'politically', 'correct', 'crowd', 'Hollywood', 'gone', 'overboard', 'lately', 'use', 'films', 'diversity', 'training', 'masses', 'was', 'expecting', 'preachy', 'subtext', 'how', 'handicapped', 'can', 'be', 'heroes', 'too', 'message', 'was', 'inherent', 'fact', 'hero', 'was', 'quadriplegic', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'disability', 'was', 'essential', 'plot', 'element', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'shameless', 'sermonizing.The', 'quadriplegic', 'element', 'was', 'actually', 'effective', 'novelty', 'genre', 'often', 'criticized', 'was', 'film', 'lack', 'originality', 'story', 'calculating', 'serial', 'killer', 'very', 'specific', 'motive', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'oft', 'used', 'psychopath', 'rampage', 'So', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'excoriated', 'script', 'lacking', 'freshness', 'felt', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'angles', 'distinguished', 'genre', 'been', 'greatly', 'plowed', 'novel', 'murder', 'mystery', 'as', 'hard', 'come', 'novel', 'romance', ""n't"", 'mean', 'such', 'familiar', 'themes', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'entertaining.Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'combines', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'graphic', 'violence', 'total', 'package', 'great', 'impact', 'extremely', 'effective', 'use', 'camera', 'heighten', 'effect', 'scenes', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'top', 'down', 'shots', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'shots', 'use', 'sound', 'also', 'very', 'compelling', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'found', 'startled', 'right', 'seat', 'having', 'DTS', 'version', 'DVD', 'probably', 'enhanced', 'effect', 'underground', 'sets', 'were', 'fantastic', 'lent', 'eerie', 'reality', 'historic', 'broken', 'down', 'locations', 'where', 'crimes', 'were', 'set.The', 'acting', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'particularly', 'effective', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'roles', 'where', 'character', 'think', 'way', 'film', 'dealing', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'was', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'role', 'had', 'deliver', 'impact', 'character', 'use', 'body', 'making', 'facial', 'expressions', 'voice', 'only', 'dramatic', 'weapons', 'Given', 'constraints', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'presenting', 'dynamic', 'powerful', 'portrayal.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'proven', 'once', 'again', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'consistently', 'fluffy', 'girlie', 'take', 'difficult', 'characters', 'was', 'hard', 'nails', 'convincing', 'intuitive', 'forensics', 'cop', 'was', 'who', 'made', 'chemistry', 'work', 'Lincoln', 'Amelia', 'creating', 'emotional', 'barrier', 'spiteful', 'cynicism', 'then', 'slowly', 'letting', 'down', 'Lincoln', 'gained', 'respect', 'range', 'effectively', 'portray', 'grit', 'vulnerability', 'same', 'character', 'small', 'order.I', 'gave', 'film', '9/10', 'crime', 'dramas', 'go', 'was', 'terrific', 'graphic', 'violence', 'not', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'good', 'taut', 'murder', 'mystery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'film']",N/A

68698,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,0783240295,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 3]","&quot;The Bone Collector,&quot; based on Jeffrey Deaver's best-selling novel, is a gothic suspense thriller that takes the viewer below the streets of New York City, to places dark and chilling, where an evil serial killer does his dirty deeds. Creepy!!Police detective Lincoln Rhyme, (Denzel Washington is wonderful in this role - but isn't he always?), is considered to be THE genius of forensic science. His books on the subject are mandatory study at the Police Academy. During an investigation, four years before, Rhyme was involved in a terrible on-the-job accident which left him a quadriplegic and bedridden. Attached to life sustaining machines, he is only able to move one finger and his head and neck. He is subject to seizures that threaten to leave him a vegetable. A very angry man, he is bored and, at times, suicidal. Still an official member of the force, his former colleagues visit him constantly and involve him in difficult cases. A new, troubling case forces them to seek his help, yet again.Rookie cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), works with the city's troubled youth. By chance she discovers the half-buried body of a powerful New York City businessman, near a railroad track. She, almost intuitively, knows what to do to protect the forensic evidence. Sending a witness off to buy a disposable camera, she takes photos of the crime scene before a rainstorm can wash away the evidence. She then, single-handedly, stops a train to preserve valuable clues. Rhyme decides she has natural forensic talent and demands she be placed on the case. So she reluctantly joins his team. Donaghy does the leg work, connected by a headset to Rhyme, while he instructs her. The two puzzle over clues and work the case from his bedside. And the leg work is brutally grim. This killer, intelligent and demented, thinks up some awful ways to commit murder. The crime scenes are elaborately set-up and clues are purposefully left that would stump the most avid puzzle addict. The gruesome crimes remind me of those in the movie &quot;Seven.&quot;The mystery is intriguing and the forensic work absolutely fascinates. The chemistry between Rhyme and Donaghy is palpable. This is more than a student-mentor bond, although it takes them a while to get the relationship off the ground. He is cranky and imperious - she is just plain ornery. Amelia brings him to life again and he stops contemplating euthanasia. In turn, he brings new energy to Amelia's life and forces her to open up. Queen Latifa (as Rhyme's nurse) and Luis Guzman (as a fellow cop ands friend) are show stealers.This is no &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; but it is good entertainment. The camera gives the ambiance a dark and brooding look and provides some interesting angles. Often predictable, there are still surprises and the growing closeness between the detective and the cop is very well done and subtle. Although &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; is not a &quot;must see,&quot; it is certainly an exciting way to spend a rainy night.",4,"A Chilling,  Above Average Suspense Thriller",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,3017,"['quot', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'quot', 'based', 'Jeffrey', 'Deaver', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'gothic', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'places', 'dark', 'chilling', 'where', 'evil', 'serial', 'killer', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'Creepy', 'Police', 'detective', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'wonderful', 'role', ""n't"", 'always', 'considered', 'be', 'THE', 'genius', 'forensic', 'science', 'books', 'subject', 'are', 'mandatory', 'study', 'Police', 'Academy', 'investigation', 'four', 'years', 'before', 'Rhyme', 'was', 'involved', 'terrible', 'on-the-job', 'accident', 'left', 'quadriplegic', 'bedridden', 'Attached', 'life', 'sustaining', 'machines', 'only', 'able', 'move', 'one', 'finger', 'head', 'neck', 'subject', 'seizures', 'threaten', 'leave', 'vegetable', 'very', 'angry', 'man', 'bored', 'times', 'suicidal', 'Still', 'official', 'member', 'force', 'former', 'colleagues', 'visit', 'constantly', 'involve', 'difficult', 'cases', 'new', 'troubling', 'case', 'seek', 'help', 'yet', 'again.Rookie', 'cop', 'Amelia', 'Donaghy', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'city', 'troubled', 'youth', 'chance', 'half-buried', 'body', 'powerful', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'businessman', 'railroad', 'track', 'almost', 'intuitively', 'what', 'do', 'protect', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'Sending', 'witness', 'buy', 'disposable', 'camera', 'photos', 'crime', 'scene', 'rainstorm', 'can', 'wash', 'away', 'evidence', 'then', 'single-handedly', 'train', 'preserve', 'valuable', 'clues', 'Rhyme', 'natural', 'forensic', 'talent', 'be', 'placed', 'case', 'reluctantly', 'team', 'Donaghy', 'leg', 'work', 'connected', 'headset', 'Rhyme', 'two', 'puzzle', 'clues', 'work', 'case', 'bedside', 'leg', 'work', 'brutally', 'grim', 'killer', 'intelligent', 'demented', 'up', 'awful', 'ways', 'commit', 'murder', 'crime', 'scenes', 'are', 'elaborately', 'set-up', 'clues', 'are', 'purposefully', 'left', 'would', 'stump', 'most', 'avid', 'puzzle', 'addict', 'gruesome', 'crimes', 'remind', 'movie', 'quot', 'Seven.', 'quot', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'forensic', 'work', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Rhyme', 'Donaghy', 'palpable', 'more', 'student-mentor', 'bond', 'while', 'get', 'relationship', 'ground', 'cranky', 'imperious', 'just', 'plain', 'ornery', 'Amelia', 'life', 'again', 'contemplating', 'euthanasia', 'turn', 'new', 'energy', 'Amelia', 'life', 'open', 'up', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'Rhyme', 'nurse', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'fellow', 'cop', 'ands', 'friend', 'are', 'show', 'stealers.This', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'good', 'entertainment', 'camera', 'ambiance', 'dark', 'brooding', 'look', 'interesting', 'angles', 'Often', 'predictable', 'are', 'still', 'surprises', 'growing', 'closeness', 'detective', 'cop', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'subtle', 'quot', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'quot', 'not', 'quot', 'must', 'see', 'quot', 'certainly', 'exciting', 'way', 'spend', 'rainy', 'night']",N/A

C'mon!  Bone Collector!?  That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal.  Nice one.  You won't get me again.It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles.  This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy.  He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds.  He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!!  Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick.Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads.  Only, there are a few major plot-holes:1) There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments.2) There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull.3) There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with.4) The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is.Things learned from this movie:-Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role.-Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy.-I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity.

'Jeopardy' was a total waste of time, and to think we passed up Denzel, who as far as I am aware has NEVER been in a bad movie, for such drivel--well when I finally rented 'The Bone Collector' I felt even more stupid for passing it up originally.Now that I have been able to get over my mistake (with a few months of therapy of course...) this is the movie that got me to read the books with Lincoln Rhyme written by Jeffery Deaver.  I have been VERY glad I did, too.  Now as good as this movie is, I would have to say that it paled when compared to the book (but which movie is EVER better than the book?).  Without comparing it to the book, it was still a fun and exciting forensic-driven 'whodunnit'.  The character of Lincoln Rhyme is easily one of my favorite in the last 10 years mostly because he is so 100% the opposite of what we have come to expect in this type of crime-fighter.  He is bed-ridden due to an accident which left him paralyzed while on duty some years back.  So where is the action you might ask?  Well Denzel had to do pretty much all of his acting with his face, and that took a lot more talent than most people realize--and YES, in fact there is a LOT of action in this intense thriller.  If you are interested in the forensic side of crime you simply CANNOT pass up this movie.  How exactly can you find a murderer based upon such little evidence, all of which was purposely LEFT behind BY the killer?  Finding out is definitely the biggest portion of why this is such a great movie.I URGE you strongly, IF you enjoyed this movie, pick up a copy of the book, and then move on the the even better, 'The Coffin Dancer' also featuring Lincoln Rhyme.  If you are looking for a surprise ending, 'The Coffin Dancer' had a DOOSEY!  When all is said and done, if you see Denzel in the movie, go and see it, you are assured of a great time--and 'The Bone Collector' is NO exception.",5,What a GREAT 'whodunnit' and performance by Denzel,976665600,"12 13, 2000",2000,2062,"['can', 'still', 'remember', 'wife', 'deciding', 'see', ""'The"", 'Bone', 'Collector', ""'Double"", 'Jeopardy', 'chose', 'latter', 'boy', 'was', 'BIG', 'mistake', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'think', 'passed', 'up', 'Denzel', 'who', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'NEVER', 'been', 'bad', 'movie', 'such', 'drivel', 'well', 'when', 'finally', 'rented', ""'The"", 'Bone', 'Collector', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'stupid', 'passing', 'up', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'mistake', 'few', 'months', 'therapy', 'course', 'movie', 'got', 'read', 'books', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'written', 'Jeffery', 'Deaver', 'have', 'been', 'VERY', 'glad', 'did', 'too', 'Now', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'paled', 'when', 'compared', 'book', 'movie', 'EVER', 'better', 'book', 'comparing', 'book', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'exciting', 'forensic-driven', ""'whodunnit"", 'character', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'last', '10', 'years', 'mostly', 'so', '100', '%', 'opposite', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'type', 'crime-fighter', 'bed-ridden', 'due', 'accident', 'left', 'paralyzed', 'duty', 'years', 'back', 'where', 'action', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'Denzel', 'had', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'acting', 'face', 'took', 'lot', 'more', 'talent', 'most', 'people', 'realize', 'YES', 'fact', 'LOT', 'action', 'intense', 'thriller', 'are', 'interested', 'forensic', 'side', 'crime', 'simply', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'pass', 'up', 'movie', 'How', 'exactly', 'can', 'find', 'murderer', 'based', 'such', 'little', 'evidence', 'was', 'purposely', 'LEFT', 'behind', 'BY', 'killer', 'Finding', 'out', 'definitely', 'biggest', 'portion', 'why', 'such', 'great', 'movie.I', 'URGE', 'strongly', 'IF', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'book', 'then', 'move', 'even', 'better', 'Coffin', 'Dancer', 'also', 'featuring', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'are', 'looking', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Coffin', 'Dancer', 'had', 'DOOSEY', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'see', 'Denzel', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'are', 'assured', 'great', 'time', ""'The"", 'Bone', 'Collector', 'exception']",N/A
68701,A3PE884TA8529G,0783240295,J. E. Nelson,"[2, 2]","I saw The Bone Collector twice, once in the theater and once several years later.  This was one too many times to see this film.The story revolves around a quadriplegic police detective named Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) and a witty young patrol officer, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie).  The plot is fairly simple.  A series of rather unusual, methodically planned murders are taking place in the city, as the perpetrator taunts police with clues left at the scene of each murder.  The police department asks for help from the bedridden Detective Rhyme.  After the first murder, Rhyme sees the talent of Officer Donaghy and uses her as his eyes and feet in the investigation.  Not wanting to give the climax away, there is a reason the perpetrator is taunting the police.The ending of the movie was thrilling yet foolish at the same time.  To me, a good suspense thriller should leave clues so an extremely bright person might be able to figure out who is the ""shadowy"" bad guy and what he is after.  While the ending in this movie is predictable, I felt there is absolutely no way that anyone could figure out who the killer is much less the cause of his bloody rampage prior to the killer admitting it.This film is one of those movies where if you seen it once, there is really no reason to see it again.  The suspense is gone from the movie after you see it the first time.  While I thought the movie was quite good the first time I saw it, it was rather boring the second time I saw it.  This is not a movie I'd rent for a date or cuddle with someone to.  I'd recommend the movie to people who like a great suspense movie, and who have never seen it.

It kept coming on cable again and again and finally in November I was sick with the flu, it was Thursday morning, I think, and the only thing on the telly was The Bone Collector and so I bit. I lay there sick as a dog and watched the film.Interestingly, Jolie wasn't taking full advantage of her considerable assets. Her hair was pulled back, make-up natural, she was dressed mostly in cop clothes and her acting was very low-key. She was in character. She was acting. I was impressed.Denzel Washington had me within minutes. He's a gifted actor and the way he interacts with his supporting cast brings out the best in everyone else as well, like Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzman. I truly think Denzel was put on this earth to act.The story is about a serial killer and they're running out of time to save people's lives. Denzel is paralyzed but a brilliant criminologist so he needs Angelina to run around doing his `leg work'. But since she's sort of a newby on the force, it's difficult for her to, say, saw the arms off a dead lady (so he can get her prints) she finds even though he asks her very nicely. There's lots of gross out stuff here for you sick people, too.It's your typical 'crime/serial killer/ paralyzed cop' movie with a few twists.

However this entry into the well-worn genre is far-less exciting or even interesting than other superior predecessors. Directed by Philip Noyce, who gave us the excellent Dead Calm (1989), here seems to have forgotten how to create suspenseful action or anything resembling a proper structural build-up.The film's slender running time creates an anti-climax, giving the feeling that an over-enthusiastic editor has chopped out the best bits of the action.There are good points; Denzel Washington is great as the paraplegic who, with the help of Angelina Jolie's character, starts to track down a seriously demented serial killer. And there are some effectively creepy moments and the dark music adds to the film's suspense. But Angelina Jolie is wasted in this, and the aforementioned bog standard ending is a real letdown.

68721,A16X61RLY1YJL7,0783240295,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[1, 1]","&quot;The Bone Collector&quot; is a good but somewhat predictable thriller that has the good fortune of a good casting director.  Don't get me wrong about this movie, it is good, it just isn't one of those super thrillers that catches the imagination which is somewhat evidenced by a fair to midland run in the theaters and on the DVD racks.  One major note of caution when watching this thriller; if you're a videophile such as myself and can easily match voices with faces, watching the trailer for this movie will easily give away the killer and somewhat spoil the movie.Denzel Washington, as usual, performs brilliantly in this film as he does in most films he stars in.  I think that when I purchased and watched this particular movie some time ago that it had been the first film that I'd watched that had the ever beautiful and alluring Angelina Jolie in it.  I hate to admit it but at that time and upon a second viewing now, her performance in this film is somewhat lackluster which, having watched several of her other movies, is somewhat disappointing, but then again, the role she's taken for this film may have had a lot to do with her performance as her character is a somewhat subdued character in the first place.Director Phillip Noyce may best be known for such films as &quot;Clear and Present Danger,&quot; &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; over this particular film but I would note that he most likely did the best with this film that he could considering the overall predictability of the script.The Premise:Denzel Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, one of the best known forensics detectives who a few years earlier suffered an accident and is now bedridden and seriously considering suicide but for the help of his full time nurse Thelma who is played quite well by Queen Latifah.  Angelina Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy who is a street cop that stumbles across a particularly gruesome crime scene and handles it quite admirably until the rest of New York's finest shows up.  The detectives handling the case take the evidence to Lincoln for his opinion and he seeks Amelia's assistance in handling the case as he suddenly finds himself leading the entire investigation from his bed and there is a killer out there that continues to murder people and leaving clues...What follows from there is a respectable thriller of a movie that does somewhat suffer at the hands of predictability which keeps it one notch below some of the bigger thrillers of the last few years.  Despite the minor predictabilities I would still recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a &quot;good&quot; thriller.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Spotlight on Location-Feature Commentary with Director Phillip Noyce-Dolby and DTS Audio Tracks-Production Notes-Cast and Filmmakers-Theatrical Trailer-Universal Showcase-DVD-ROM Features",4,The Bone Collector - A fairly respectable thriller!,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2846,"['quot', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'quot', 'good', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'thriller', 'good', 'fortune', 'good', 'casting', 'director', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'one', 'super', 'thrillers', 'imagination', 'somewhat', 'evidenced', 'fair', 'midland', 'run', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'racks', 'One', 'major', 'note', 'caution', 'when', 'watching', 'thriller', ""'re"", 'videophile', 'such', 'myself', 'can', 'easily', 'match', 'voices', 'watching', 'trailer', 'movie', 'will', 'easily', 'give', 'away', 'killer', 'somewhat', 'spoil', 'movie.Denzel', 'Washington', 'usual', 'performs', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'most', 'films', 'think', 'when', 'purchased', 'watched', 'particular', 'movie', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'film', ""'d"", 'watched', 'had', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'alluring', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'hate', 'admit', 'time', 'second', 'viewing', 'now', 'performance', 'film', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'having', 'watched', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'then', 'again', 'role', 'taken', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'performance', 'character', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'character', 'first', 'place.Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'may', 'best', 'be', 'known', 'such', 'films', 'quot', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'quot', 'quot', 'Saint', 'quot', 'quot', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'quot', 'particular', 'film', 'would', 'note', 'most', 'likely', 'did', 'best', 'film', 'could', 'considering', 'overall', 'predictability', 'script.The', 'Premise', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'forensics', 'detectives', 'who', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'suffered', 'accident', 'now', 'bedridden', 'seriously', 'considering', 'suicide', 'help', 'full', 'time', 'nurse', 'Thelma', 'who', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Amelia', 'Donaghy', 'who', 'street', 'cop', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'crime', 'scene', 'quite', 'admirably', 'rest', 'New', 'York', 'finest', 'up', 'detectives', 'handling', 'case', 'take', 'evidence', 'Lincoln', 'opinion', 'Amelia', 'assistance', 'handling', 'case', 'suddenly', 'leading', 'entire', 'investigation', 'bed', 'killer', 'there', 'murder', 'people', 'leaving', 'clues', 'What', 'respectable', 'thriller', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'suffer', 'hands', 'predictability', 'one', 'notch', 'bigger', 'thrillers', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'minor', 'predictabilities', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'thriller', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Spotlight', 'Location-Feature', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce-Dolby', 'DTS', 'Audio', 'Tracks-Production', 'Notes-Cast', 'Filmmakers-Theatrical', 'Trailer-Universal', 'Showcase-DVD-ROM', 'Features']",N/A

I've no problem with the scripting changes necessitated when films are made from great books (although they usually don't work!)....but in this case, a truly unique first appearance of Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic forensic specialist, is spoiled by some deliberate and wasted alterations of the characters and the plot.The changes? Rhyme's nurse in the novel was a cynic, gay harpy...the perfect person to try to control Rhyme.  In the movie, a big-hearted, dedicated career nurse is played by Queen Latifah.  Why? The ending of the film was completely changed by the scriptwriters, and I urge you to read the novel to see the shocking conclusion that played so much better than the film ended.I blame Noyce, the director, for the script annihilation, the ""too dark"" filming sequences outside of Rhyme's apartment, and the waste of a pretty cohesive cast.I'm giving 3 stars instead of less because the cast does a fine job, and the sets are outstanding.  Angelina Jolie may not have been excellent here, in Amelia's first appearance, but you can believe that she would be perfect for the part if filmakers chose to continue the Rhyme theme and film some of the later, greater novels.  Supporting players are all strong, and Denzel is outstanding as Lincoln Rhyme, with his electronic life-giving toys, his attitude, and his willingness to give up life as every seizure (well played!) rocks his world.

68739,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783240295,Matthew Horner,"[14, 17]","It is rare that my reading habits coincide with what I see at the movies. I just happened to read Jeffrey Deaver's novel, The Bone Collector, just a few weeks before the film adaptation opened. I found Mr. Deaver's book to be scary, original and well researched. It is a page turner, and I highly recommend it to mystery fans. And the movie? Read on!I am fairly well educated on the subject of transferring books into films. I don't want to get too deep, but what we have to deal with is too different mediums. Writing is a linear art. Movies are a visual art. Simply put, it is not possible to precisely translate a book into a film. When people read, each person visualizes the text differently. A film is a singular vision. Assuming work of fiction is reasonably well written, only the plot and some descriptions will come out approximately the same to all readers. For movie purposes, plots often must be altered. There are two main reasons. One is time constraints. You may not care how long it takes you to read a good book, but would you sit through a faithful movie version if it ran six hours? The other is the idea that what engrosses people in a book is often different from what intrigues them in a movie.I prefaced my review of The Bone Collector with these remarks because there is something screen writers often do that both irritates and confuses me. It is easy to see why this book was bought for the screen. The story is highly cinematic, the kind that movie executives fight over the rights to produce. So what was the screenwriter thinking when deciding to rewrite key elements of the plot in order to create a weaker movie? I'll never know, but that's what seems to have occurred in this case. I'll get back to this in a minute.The movie stars two of this year's Oscar nominees, Denzel Washington and Angeline Jolie. It was directed by Phillip Noyce, a competent fellow who has directed such action hits as Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a top notch forensic detective who has been paralyzed from the neck down for three years. Despondent over the tedium of his life, he has consulted with a doctor about ending his life. When some of New York's finest come to his apartment to ask for his help in solving a particularly gruesome and clever murder, he is reluctant. As the case proceeds and becomes increasingly complex, he is given, at least temporarily, a reason to live. Jolie is Amelia Donaghy, a bright young cop who is the first at the scene of the killing. Impressed by her professional handling of the crime scene, he enlists her to be his eyes in the world beyond his apartment and his computers. Amelia also wants nothing to do with the manhunt at first, but as she becomes familiar with forensic science, she finds that she is a natural detective. What follows is a harrowing cat and mouse game between Lincoln, Amelia and the diabolical killer, who leaves bizarre clues at each crime scene. This planted evidence can tell a clever detective when and where the next crime will occur.Splendid story possibilities, right? Sounds like a great movie. Well, it's not, and this is due to that scriptwriter. I suppose it's okay to change Lincoln's nurse from a hip and funny [but no nonsense] gay guy to a warm and compassionate [but bland] woman named Thelma, a part wasted on the vibrant Queen Latifah. In the book, the nurse was an integral part of the story. Thelma mostly wanders around trying to help. Maybe it's also okay to change the nurse's ultimate fate. As in the book, the movie's villain is obsessed with old New York, particularly locales dating to around 1890. The movie, however, fails to capitalize on these visual treats, even though New York is still filled with such places. It is in the identity of the killer and in the reason why the killer is doing his deeds that the movie goes totally off the track. The book's ending could have made one of the most surprising and shocking film finales in years. It all made sense and had a great twist. The movie changes all this.

Angelina Jolie has one of her better roles as beat cop Amelia Donoghey, who is called in to help Rhyme against her wishes.  Jolie is more vulnerable and human than in some of her later roles.  The supporting cast is likewise top notch:  Queen Latifah shines as Rhyme's nurse Thelma (a character that is male in the books); Ed O'Neill underplays his role as Paulie, Rhyme's former partner; Michael Rooker sizzles as the egotistical Chaney; Luis Guzman does well as the lab technician Eddie; director Philip Noyce keeps the audience guessing and the screenplay uses a different murderer than in the book so fans familiar with the book may be surprised by the movie's denouement.

One by one, various people are captured, have horrible things done to them, leaving a crime scene which has clues to the next crime.  Luckily for us, Angelina Jolie finds one of the crime scenes, and her eagle eyes and careful technique means that a pettern starts to emerge.  The cops go to Washington, a severely crippled forensics man who was top of his field, showing him both the evidence and Jolie!  He nurtures her forensics abilities, and they close in on the killer.....  And so it goes, until the end, when, in the usual mix of drama, sudden realisation, desperate last minute chases, etc. etc.,  the killer is revealed to be....someone I didn't expect.The film is fairly straight forward, the important facts are right there for you to see, easy to follow.  Character development is poor - you learn some stuff about Jolie, but, for the life of me, I couldn't see what it added to her character (maybe I'm just thick).  Not enough detail goes into the criminal, you learn very little about him/her until right at the end, and even then you're only given an outline of what drives the killer.  Some of the plot development is a bit silly - for example, when Washington is brought into the case, against the wishes of a senior cop, it seems as if the whole of the forensics department, eqiopment, people, everything, moves into his apartment, and plugs into his computers, databases, etc. which all happen to be conveniently there!Anyway, nitpicking aside, this is a fairly good film, perfect for a night in if thrillers are what you like.

It is the first of 2 films in which she plays an investigator who pursues a serial killer (*Taking Lives*, released in 2003, is the second). As I mentioned in my *Mojave Moon* review, *The Bone Collector* is the first big-budget movie to run Ms Jolie's name above the title. She plays opposite one of Hollywood's most respected leading men, Denzel Washington. Also appearing are Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luiz Guzman, Leland Orser, John Benjamin Hickey, Bobby Cannevale, and Ed O'Neill. Philip Noyce (*Sliver* in '93, *Clear and Present Danger* in '94) directs.*CSI* (Crime Scene Investigation) is the hottest TV series going today. It was first aired one year after *The Bone Collector*'s release. I don't know if the brains at CBS behind *CSI* were inspired by *The Bone Collector.* But one thing is sure: in 1999 *The Bone Collector* tapped the magic of police forensics on the big screen in the same way that *CSI* does now on the small screen.But although the *Bone Collector* soars, it carries an annoying burden on its back that throws a wobble on its flight to glory. The blame is not due the acting, direction, camera, scenery, editing, or music. All of these are excellent and make for a very stylish movie, one that pleases the eyes and ears. But the move fails to satisfy the mind. Read my lips: the problem is the script.Before *The Bone Collector*, two very highly-rated films had set the standard for serial killer mysteries. These were *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) and *Se7ven* (1995). *The Bone Collector* matches them in style. Perhaps it even surpasses them, as its atmospherics are creepier. But *Se7ven*'s script is better. *Silence*'s script is way better.About *The Bone Collector* script, there are troubling weaknesses. One weakness concerns the conflict of authority in the NYPD hierarchy. This conflict is central to the dramatic tension of the movie as a whole, and so its weakness needs some care to explain.Denzel Washington is Lincoln Rhyme, a quadraplegic cripple (which means his four limbs--two arms, two legs--are paralyzed). He draws the full pay of a detective because he was incapacitated by an on-the-job accident. But he performs no official police duties. He's not fit to. Yet apparently on the strength of the respect the police have for his crime scene forensics expertise, he is able to insert Patrolwoman Amelia Donaghy (Jolie) into the task force that's trying to catch the so-called Bone Collector serial killer. Donaghy is just a beat cop with no plans to become a detective. (She does display a natural talent for forensics, which is why Rhyme is interested in her.) Rhyme doesn't just place her as an observer on the task force...he promotes her to sole CSI operative. Linked to Rhyme by radio, she acts as his eyes and ears at the crime scene, while back in his apartment he calls the shots from bed. Right here I'm asking myself, ""But if she, untrained in CSI work, messes up, and Rhyme is not on official duty status, then who is responsible?"" HELLO--the real world does not work that way, especially not when it comes to a high-stakes big-city crime caper like the movie is supposed to show us.It gets worse. Rhyme's arrangement with Donaghy is resented by the regular CSI team that works under the authority of Captain Cheney (Rooker). Cheney is no friend of Rhyme. In fact Cheney, who took over forensics after Rhyme's accident, has been replacing Rhyme's CSI people with his own loyalists. (That's why Rhyme wants Donaghy; he's not impressed with Cheney's people.) Rhyme's allies are Eddie Ortiz (Guzman), an expert in police lab work, and detectives Solomon (McGlone) and Sellitto (O'Neill) who are homicide dicks, not CSI at all. It was Sellitto who first came to see Rhyme about the Bone Collector. He mentioned that the Chief of Police sent him. The NYPD is all shook up because the Bone Collector kidnapped a VIP and his wife. No doubt Rhyme's advice in this dark hour would be a great help. But it is just as clear he is in no shape to resume any real authority--he has a spasmodic attack right in the middle of the talk with Sellitto! Rhyme's caregiver (Latifah) abruptly orders a panicked Sellitto to leave. It is incomprehensible to see, a little later, Lincoln Rhyme, now on the case from his bed, blithely brushing Captain Cheney aside. After an uncomfortable Cheney leaves Rhyme's apartment, Rhyme orders Donaghy to go out on her first mission. ""Should we keep Cheney in the loop?"" asks Sellitto. ""F*ck him,"" is Rhyme's reply.I'll summarize the power play at work here: Rhyme has no official authority over the Bone Collector case, he's just an advisor; Sellitto is Rhyme's friend and ally, and as detective he has enough authority to order Donaghy to do what Rhyme tells her; Captain Cheney, however, is in charge of CSI and is ranked higher than Sellitto; Donaghy is able to do CSI work only because Sellitto is keeping Cheny out of the loop. The crack in the chain of command eventually breaks out in the open. Starting at 1h:34m:26s, Cheney shows up at a crime scene to interrupt Donaghy and to berate Rhyme over her radio. ""I've got some news for you,"" he shouts. ""You are not a cop anymore, you understand that? What you are is a f*cking meddling cripple. Now, I'm going to put your little girlfriend under arrest. You don't mind that, do you?"" Occupied with venting his spleen at Rhyme, Cheney doesn't notice Donaghy giving him the slip. She disappears into the night to continue her search for the Bone Collector!Of course in the end their little stint as loose cannons comes out good for Rhyme and Donaghy. As it would only in Holly-would. Donaghy's reckless gamble with her police career is, in terms of real life, totally unbelievable.In *Silence of the Lambs*, Claire Starling (Jodie Foster) was an FBI trainee, not an active-duty agent. But because she showed exceptional ability, she was given special permission to take part in the Buffalo Bill serial killer investigation. The appeal of Foster's character is that she's the ever-dutiful newbie, respectful and polite at every turn. We believe in her all the way. Claire could never end up chasing a crazed murderer while at the same time being chased by her own agency for stealing police evidence, as did Amelia Donaghy.A second weakness of the script is the climax, when the killer reveals himself. I'm not going to spoil the suspense for you by explaining what happens. I'll just say the perp pops up in a totally unexpected, ""Jack-in-the-box"" way. The trail of evidence that Rhyme and Donaghy had carefully tracked for an hour and a half of the movie does not lead to this guy at all. So you're left with (or at least I was left with) a feeling of having been taken on a thrill ride to nowhere for most of the film. The one good that comes out of it is that Donaghy deduces the perp is going after Rhyme. But who the perp is and why he wants Rhyme dead we learn from the perp himself, not from Amelia's detective work.Another script weakness regards the state of Rhyme's health. In the beginning of the film we watch him convince his doctor to help him though his ""final transition"" (physician-assisted suicide). Rhyme speaks of the dysreflexia seizures that are occuring more often, and the buildup of fluid in his spine which is a degenerative condition. ""We both know I'm waiting for the seizure that's gonna make me a vegetable."" The doctor is clearly reluctant to be part of Rhyme's final transition. But since he has no medical argument to counter Rhyme, he finally agrees to do the deed on the coming Sunday. At the end of the film it's Christmas, nearly two months later. Rhyme and his doctor are talking again, this time about the view from Rhyme's window. ""It's looking better every day,"" Rhyme says. Then Amelia enters followed by other guests, and a Christmas party ensues. ""It's looking better every day"" is a hint, I guess, that Rhyme is getting better. Or at least feeling better. Well, I want to know what happened. Six weeks earlier he was all ready to check out. His doctor agreed that his health was in irreversable decline. Now we see Rhyme partying with Amelia and friends. Why he's still here is left to our imagination.OK, now that we're on the topic of the relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Donaghy, enough criticism. Ms Jolie remarked that the best sex scenes she ever did onscreen were with Denzel Washington. (Remember, *The Bone Collector* was made after *Pushing Tin*, so we must conclude these scenes were even better for her than kissing Billy Bob.) What she meant was that because these scenes were almost non-physical in nature, they required a lot more emotional involvement from the actors.I find these scenes just amazing! There's an intense exchange of glances when Amelia accidentially drops a small piece of crime-scene evidence on Lincoln's chest. There's Amelia touching the tracheotomy scar on his throat as he sleeps; then she fondles the index finger of his left hand, the only finger that he has control of. As she does this, her face is rapt with what looks like orgasmic meditation. There's an obvious symbolism to this that I won't bother to explain. At the very end of the film she again fondles that finger. Immediately afterward, starting at 1h:47m:01s soon before the film fades to black, we're seeing Lincoln's face full on and Amelia's from the left side. Watch carefully, you can observe Ms Jolie lifting her left eyebrow in that tradwmark way of hers as she looks into Denzel's eyes...that eyebrow, one commentator wrote, with which Jolie could lift weights. Watch Lincoln's facial expression. She's sending a signal, he's receiving it. It's so obvious. It's a signal that she has a present for him this Christmas that doesn't come sealed in a box wrapped in foil paper and a bright bow. This is surely one reason why he told his doctor, ""It's getting better every day.""Before I close I want to summarize the Amelia Donaghy character. Her father's name was John Donaghy. He was born in Brooklyn, was a NYPD patrolman, and was 47 years old when he killed himself with his service revolver. Amelia found his body at his apartment. This haunts her, naturally. Amelia's mother, Linda Wilken, is 6 years older than her husband. She was born in Salem, Massachussetts and lives there at present. John and Linda were divorced in 1977 when Amelia was 6 years old. She grew up in Salem with her mother. As a teen she did catalogue modeling. After high school she moved to New York to attend Washington College. Then she entered the New York Police Academy. Following the footsteps of her Dad, to whom she was very attached, she became a policewoman. She lives in an apartment in Queens. Many reviewers of *The Bone Collector* describe Amelia as a ""rookie cop"" when Lincoln Rhyme takes her on as his assistant. That is not true. At 19m:16s Captain Cheney asks Amelia if she is a rookie, and she says no. She's been on the force a while. As a cop she has high marks from her superiors; Lincoln praises her, ""You're gold shield material"" (detective material). Absolutely, Amelia is no rookie cop.As a woman, Amelia is lovely but modest. She wears little or no makeup, doesn't let her hair grow too long and keeps it tied back, and dresses simply. But still she's a sexual creature with an active love life. It's hard for her to commit to a relationship, though--even harder for her than for the men she knows intimately. It appears that Lincoln Rhyme is the one man Amelia's been waiting for. But why does she fall in love with a cripple? How long will this relationship last? How long CAN it last? These questions make Amelia and Lincoln all the more intriguing to us.",4,Before *CSI* there was *The Bone Collector*,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,11844,"['Bone', 'Collector*', '1999', 'third',

There are adaptions that improve on their source material, the best example being ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  And there are adaptions which deviate so much from there source material that one would be hard-pressed to call them ""adaptations"", such as ""Along Came a Spider"".  The Bone Collector falls directly in the middle of the spectrum.  Unfortunetly, the works of Jeffrey Deaver may not be the most adaptible for the big screen as the gems of his writing are often lost and we are left with an almost-generic action thriller.  I certainly didn't mind some of the changes made (Denzel Washington is a terrific actor and proved it yet again in this film.)  I think that a lot of minor plot points, such as a budding relationship between the two main characters, added up are what made the novel great.  But Hollywood can only make a movie so long, so I blame this less-than-amazing adaptation on the difficulty of adapting a work as complex as that which comes from the mind of Jeffrey Deaver.  I will say that any Deaver fan can still get a good viewing or two out of this, especially if they are as dedicated a Lincoln Rhyme fan as I am, but other than that, it really is just a generic action/crime thriller...even with the sometimes excessive killing.

68774,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783240295,Reviewer,"[1, 6]","Director Phillip Noyce delivers an atmospheric thriller with ""The Bone Collector,"" a somewhat grisly tale of a serial killer in New York City.  Homicide detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is an expert in the  field of forensics; he has also been a quadriplegic for four years, the  result of an accident sustained during the investigation of a crime scene.  From the neck down he has the use of only a single finger, with which he  controls a computer and monitor from his bed.  Useless though his body may  be, his mind is still sharp, and circumstances bring him together with a  young NYPD officer, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), who has just received  a long sought after transfer to the Youth Services Division.  Destiny takes  her elsewhere, however.  When she is the first officer to arrive  at a crime scene, Donaghy proceeds to secure the area and take the  appropriate measures to insure that any evidence is not compromised.  Rhyme  is consulted on the case (a murder), and takes note of the precision  employed  by Donaghy in handling the crime scene.  When he meets her, he  learns that while at the academy she had read one of his books on the  subject (He has written a dozen, on forensics and related issues).  Rhyme  then presses her into service as his eyes and ears, to physically do at a  crime scene what he cannot, by talking her through each step via radio.  Reluctant initially, Donaghy soon exhibits an affinity for forensics and  becomes much more than merely the physical extension of Rhyme; they become  partners, and continue with the case accordingly.  ""The Bone Collector""  offers some chilling moments, especially in two scenes, one of which  involves a steam pipe, the other, lots of rats.  In each case, it is all  the more horrifying because the victims can see exactly what is about to  happen to them, they have time to think about it, and there is absolutely  nothing they can do about it.  It makes for an eerie, disconcerting story,  and though inherently dark it never descends to the appalling level of a  predecessor in the genre, ""Seven.""  Washington gives a top notch  performance, keeping Rhyme interesting though confined to bed for the  entire movie, and Jolie takes Amelia to a believable level that far  surpasses the typical ingenue rendering of such characters.  Unfortunately,  character development, on the whole, is sacrificed for sensationalism; with  the exception of Rhyme, whose character is readily established, we are  offered mere glimpses of the rest.  We have hints as to what motivates  Amelia, but we are left guessing as to the agenda of Captain Cheney  (Michael Rooker).  Along the way, some characters are used like obstacles  thrown into the path of a race track (Cheney is one, a bookstore clerk is  another), with the sole intent of manipulating the audience.  With a little  more depth, this could have been a remarkable movie.  The supporting cast includes Queen Latifah,  who brings a welcome presence to the film as Rhyme's nurse, Thelma; Ed  O'Neill (Detective Sellitto); Leland Orser (Richard Thompson); Mike McGlone  (Detective Solomon), Luis Guzman (Eddie Ortiz); and Arthur Holden  (Bookstore clerk).

Aside from the blistering mediocrity of the  song itself, its placement-- in fact, its use at all in this film-- almsot  destroys the whole thing, turning it into an overly-sappy love-fest.That being said, the rest of the movie is pretty darn good. Seeing it in  relation to the two films below [Cube and Se7en], however, gives me the  distinct impression that there were a lot of things left to be desired in  this film.I doubt I need to recount the plot of one of the  best-selling and best-loved crime novels of the past decade, but just in  case you need a refresher-- Lincoln Rhyme is an NYPD detective who, while  investigating a crime scene, is hit with a falling concrete block and  becomes paralyzed. When a beat cop discovers a particularly nasty crime  scene and handles the evidence in a way that puts most forensics experts to  shame, Rhyme takes an interest in her and tries to steer her towards  detective work as she gets deeper into this case, even as she tries to  disentangle herself and get back to her coveted position in the Youth  Services department. Along the way, we meet the usual suspects--  incompetent Captain, really smart killer type, wisecracking sidekick, etc.And that's the main problem. The formula's here, it's well-used, and  there's not a single twist in it to makes us sit up and say  &quot;wha...?&quot; Sure, there are some great camera shots that make us  jump, but not a single place where the crime/mystery/suspense formula is  undercut, much unlike both of the films below. And because of that, I have  to knock it down a peg, despite having excellent camerawork, excellent  acting (even from Ed O'Neill!), a leading couple with great chemistry, and  a best-supporting-actress nod for Queen Latifah, who will one day begin to  use her own name when she makes movies.",3,"Coulda been worse, I guess.",961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,1984,"['worst', 'thing', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'worst', 'song', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Give', 'Up', 'quot', 'used', 'end', 'credit', 'theme', 'Aside', 'blistering', 'mediocrity', 'song', 'placement', 'fact', 'use', 'film', 'almsot', 'whole', 'thing', 'turning', 'overly-sappy', 'love-fest.That', 'being', 'said', 'rest', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Seeing', 'relation', 'two', 'films', '[', 'Cube', 'Se7en', ']', 'however', 'distinct', 'impression', 'were', 'lot', 'things', 'left', 'be', 'desired', 'film.I', 'doubt', 'need', 'recount', 'plot', 'one', 'best-selling', 'best-loved', 'crime', 'novels', 'past', 'decade', 'just', 'case', 'need', 'refresher', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'who', 'investigating', 'crime', 'scene', 'hit', 'falling', 'concrete', 'block', 'paralyzed', 'When', 'beat', 'cop', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'crime', 'scene', 'evidence', 'way', 'most', 'forensics', 'experts', 'shame', 'Rhyme', 'interest', 'tries', 'steer', 'towards', 'detective', 'work', 'deeper', 'case', 'even', 'disentangle', 'get', 'back', 'coveted', 'position', 'Youth', 'Services', 'department', 'way', 'meet', 'usual', 'suspects', 'incompetent', 'Captain', 'really', 'smart', 'killer', 'type', 'wisecracking', 'sidekick', 'etc.And', 'main', 'problem', 'formula', 'here', 'well-used', 'not', 'single', 'twist', 'sit', 'up', 'say', 'quot', 'wha', 'quot', 'Sure', 'are', 'great', 'camera', 'shots', 'make', 'jump', 'not', 'single', 'place', 'where', 'crime/mystery/suspense', 'formula', 'undercut', 'much', 'films', 'have', 'knock', 'down', 'peg', 'having', 'excellent', 'camerawork', 'excellent', 'acting', 'even', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'leading', 'couple', 'great', 'chemistry', 'best-supporting-actress', 'nod', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'begin', 'use', 'own', 'name', 'when', 'movies']",N/A

Zwick,"[2, 4]","&quot;The Bone Collector&quot; is yet another in a long line of films that subject their audience to a mind-numbing assault by nonstop gruesome images, yet try to compensate us by offering ostensibly upbeat redemptive  outcomes for their principal characters. Unfortunately, the intensity of  the suffering endured by the innocent victims in the film overwhelms what  positive feelings the story is trying to generate. Such is not the case in  films with a higher thematic purpose - films, like &quot;Schindler's  List,&quot; which try to shed light on the dark side of human nature for a  salutary purpose - but, in routine thrillers such as this one, the  grotesquerie becomes both exploitative and offensive. And, for an added  treat, not only are we subjected to the bloodbath resulting from the serial  killer's tortures and murders, but the clinical details of the main  character's degenerative neurological condition.Denzel Washington, in a  phone-in performance, stars as Lincoln Rhyme (there just has to be some  symbolic significance to that name somewhere), a crack homicide  investigator who, for the past four years, has been reduced to a bedridden  invalid after a freak accident while on a routine investigation. Subjected  to frequent seizures which threaten to reduce him to a vegetative state and  seriously contemplating an early exit from this earthly existence, Rhyme  discovers new purpose in his life when he begins to hunt down a serial  killer with the help of Amelia Donaghy, a rookie cop with a natural eye for  crime scene investigation. Together, they manage to hunt down the crazed  killer by following the clues he so ingeniously leaves behind.Probably  the most impressive aspect of the film is that Donaghy is portrayed as a  reluctant helper, made extremely quesy and disturbed by the human depravity  she is forced to witness. This allows her to function as an effective  representative for those of us in the audience who are also being dragged  along for the ride. However, this does not enhance the credibility of the  script. The acquisition and successful unraveling of clues seems highly  implausible at times, especially when the turn-of-the-century gothic novel  - that it turns out is the inspiration for the killer's crimes - literally  drops into Donaghy's waiting hands. And would the NYPD really allow a woman  not trained in crime scene forensics lead the investigations - even with  the crack investigator Rhyme at the controls?As Donaghy, Angelina Jolie  is woefully inadequate, sustaining an expression of openmouthed insipidness  throughout. Then again, all involved, on both sides of the camera, have  little to be proud of in &quot;The Bone Collector.&quot;",2,"morbid, pointless thriller",964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2713,"['quot', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'quot', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'films', 'subject', 'audience', 'mind-numbing', 'assault', 'nonstop', 'gruesome', 'images', 'yet', 'try', 'compensate', 'offering', 'ostensibly', 'upbeat', 'redemptive', 'outcomes', 'principal', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'intensity', 'suffering', 'endured', 'innocent', 'victims', 'film', 'overwhelms', 'what', 'positive', 'feelings', 'story', 'trying', 'generate', 'Such', 'not', 'case', 'films', 'higher', 'thematic', 'purpose', 'films', 'quot', 'Schindler', 'List', 'quot', 'try', 'shed', 'light', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'salutary', 'purpose', 'routine', 'thrillers', 'such', 'one', 'grotesquerie', 'exploitative', 'offensive', 'added', 'treat', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'subjected', 'bloodbath', 'resulting', 'serial', 'killer', 'tortures', 'murders', 'clinical', 'details', 'main', 'character', 'degenerative', 'neurological', 'condition.Denzel', 'Washington', 'phone-in', 'performance', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'just', 'be', 'symbolic', 'significance', 'name', 'somewhere', 'crack', 'homicide', 'investigator', 'who', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'been', 'reduced', 'bedridden', 'invalid', 'freak', 'accident', 'routine', 'investigation', 'Subjected', 'frequent', 'seizures', 'threaten', 'reduce', 'vegetative', 'state', 'seriously', 'contemplating', 'early', 'exit', 'earthly', 'existence', 'Rhyme', 'new', 'purpose', 'life', 'when', 'hunt', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'help', 'Amelia', 'Donaghy', 'rookie', 'cop', 'natural', 'eye', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigation', 'Together', 'manage', 'hunt', 'down', 'crazed', 'killer', 'following', 'clues', 'so', 'ingeniously', 'behind.Probably', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'Donaghy', 'portrayed', 'reluctant', 'helper', 'made', 'extremely', 'quesy', 'disturbed', 'human', 'depravity', 'forced', 'witness', 'function', 'effective', 'representative', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'dragged', 'ride', 'However', 'not', 'enhance', 'credibility', 'script', 'acquisition', 'successful', 'unraveling', 'clues', 'highly', 'implausible', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'turn-of-the-century', 'gothic', 'novel', 'out', 'inspiration', 'killer', 'crimes', 'literally', 'Donaghy', 'waiting', 'hands', 'would', 'NYPD', 'really', 'allow', 'woman', 'not', 'trained', 'crime', 'scene', 'forensics', 'lead', 'investigations', 'even', 'crack', 'investigator', 'Rhyme', 'controls', 'Donaghy', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'woefully', 'inadequate', 'sustaining', 'expression', 'openmouthed', 'insipidness', 'Then', 'again', 'involved', 'sides', 'camera', 'have', 'little', 'be', 'proud', 'quot', 'Bone', 'Collector.', 'quot']",N/A

First off, I think the director and producer put this movie together perfectly. In case you do not know about this movie, Ill start off by describing it a bit... The main theme lies in the thriller/mystery department, so if you like these kind of films, you will most definitely like this movie. The two main charactors in the movie are Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Denzel plays a disabled Crime Scene Investigator and Angelina plays a rookie police officer who laters finds out her talent as a crime scene investigator. The setting of the story takes place in New York City (which is a perfect spot for this type of movie) and is cast in modern day life. Basically, the plot of the movie is about a phsyco murderer who, very strategically, plans killings by using his job as a taxi cab driver to kidnapp people. I dont want to get too in depth, but the good guys would be Denzel and Angelina and a few other police bureau workers who try to solve the mystery behind all the kidnappings and hopefully get to the crime scene in time to save innocent people. You might have preconcieved notions about this movie being kind of average, but what makes this movie stand out is its outstanding film features. By features I mean, great music and excellent effects (everything such as lighting, settings etc). If your going to watch it, here are some VERY recommended suggestions...1. Make sure its dark- 50% of the movies general &quot;effect&quot; comes from the ambience in which you watch it. 2. Watch on a fairly large television with a fairly good sound system. - try to get the best TV and sound system to watch the movie otherwise dont even bother with the movie. 3. Must get it on DVD! - Dont watch the VHS version, I saw it and its horrible. Film quality is bad and it doesnt include all the extras which tell about the Bone collector. Sound is also improved on DVD version. Any way you look at it, you need to give the Bone Collector a try.

68793,A3MEGCL9WU0U1R,0783240295,Stephen G. Melvin,"[1, 3]","As if we hadn't seen enough sadistic serial killer flicks, The Bone Collector is now on the rental shelves. This cardboard cut-out movie is your typical long, drawn-out game of cat and mouse that culminates with a twisted, implausible motive to an overexaggerated psychopath who has taken  way too many pains to leave way to many hints which the experts have  figured out way too easy.I have always been a big fan of Denzel  Washington. From Glory to Malcom X and especially Devil in a Blue Dress he  has never ceased to impress me. He does have some moments as this  know-it-all parapalegic, and I understand that the fellow can only move his  index finger, but for the most part his character of Lincoln Rhyme lacks  depth and interest. Angelina Jolie on the other hand is brilliant as usual.  The now-Oscar winner is perfect as the hard-boiled rookie who is (in yet  another gross stretch of versimilitude) picked by Rhyme to work the crime  scenes. Queen Latifah is surprisingly tolerable. And why the heck Ed O'Neil  was cast is beyond me. He was funny as Al Bundy, but he is so pathetic as  an detective that there wasn't even a smile on my face.The thing that  did impress me somewhat was the forensics aspect. Having taken two classes  in investigation, I noticed how technical the knowledge was in this movie.  Most of this comes from the Jeffrey Deaver book from which it is adapted,  but Jeremy Iacone also had to know a good bit to script this. Still, when  Jolie's character (Amelia Donaghy) moves one of the clues, then sits it  back down and photographs it, I had to cringe. I think the French would  call that tainted a la O.J.. Ouch. Still, as technically correct as this  film was, it was equally improbable.Deaver's book of the same title was  lackluster at best, yet far better than the movie. Yet another of Iacone's  intolerable offenses were his changes in the plot. For starters, there was  no heat in the book between Officer Donaghy and Rhyme. But I suppose your  typical Hollywood screenwriter knows that there has to be some sort of  sparks flying for the masses to keep interested (as if the grisly images of  tortured bodies weren't enough).With a twisted plot, a  less-than-terrifying villian, and one bloody disgusting image after  another, this movie is your average run-of-the-mill serial killer flick.  Silence of the Lambs and Seven were both brilliant, but I've seen them. Why  not scrap this equation for movies and plug in some different numbers. Why?  Because serial killers sell, and the average moviegoer is not bright enough  to figure out he is watching the same movie with a different cast. Though  it is almost worth the watch just to see Jolie's tough chick performance, I  would recommend those serious movie fans pass this one up.My verdict:  Make it a dust collector on the rental shelves.",2,Another Run of the Mill Serial Killer Flick,955670400,"04 14, 2000",2000,2839,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'flicks', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'now', 'rental', 'shelves', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'movie', 'typical', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'twisted', 'implausible', 'motive', 'overexaggerated', 'psychopath', 'who', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'pains', 'leave', 'way', 'many', 'hints', 'experts', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'too', 'easy.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'From', 'Glory', 'Malcom', 'X', 'especially', 'Devil', 'Blue', 'Dress', 'never', 'ceased', 'impress', 'have', 'moments', 'know-it-all', 'parapalegic', 'understand', 'fellow', 'can', 'only', 'move', 'index', 'finger', 'most', 'part', 'character', 'Lincoln', 'Rhyme', 'depth', 'interest', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'other', 'hand', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'now-Oscar', 'winner', 'perfect', 'hard-boiled', 'rookie', 'who', 'yet', 'gross', 'stretch', 'versimilitude', 'picked', 'Rhyme', 'work', 'crime', 'scenes', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'surprisingly', 'tolerable', 'why', 'heck', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'was', 'cast', 'was', 'funny', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'so', 'pathetic', 'detective', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'smile', 'face.The', 'thing', 'did', 'impress', 'was', 'forensics', 'aspect', 'Having', 'taken', 'two', 'classes', 'investigation', 'noticed', 'how', 'technical', 'knowledge', 'was', 'movie', 'Most', 'Jeffrey', 'Deaver', 'book', 'adapted', 'Jeremy', 'Iacone', 'also', 'had', 'know', 'good', 'bit', 'script', 'Still', 'when', 'Jolie', 'character', 'Amelia', 'Donaghy', 'one', 'clues', 'then', 'back', 'down', 'photographs', 'had', 'cringe', 'think', 'French', 'would', 'call', 'tainted', 'la', 'O.J..', 'Ouch', 'Still', 'technically', 'correct', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'equally', 'improbable.Deaver', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'lackluster', 'best', 'yet', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'Iacone', 'intolerable', 'offenses', 'were', 'changes', 'plot', 'starters', 'was', 'heat', 'book', 'Officer', 'Donaghy', 'Rhyme', 'suppose', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'be', 'sort', 'sparks', 'flying', 'masses', 'keep', 'interested', 'grisly', 'images', 'tortured', 'bodies', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'twisted', 'plot', 'less-than-terrifying', 'villian', 'one', 'bloody', 'disgusting', 'image', 'movie', 'average', 'run-of-the-mill', 'serial', 'killer', 'flick', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Seven', 'were', 'brilliant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Why', 'not', 'scrap', 'equation', 'movies', 'plug', 'different', 'numbers', 'Why', 'serial', 'killers', 'sell', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'not', 'bright', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'different', 'cast', 'almost', 'worth', 'watch', 'just', 'see', 'Jolie', 'tough', 'chick', 'performance', 'would', 'recommend', 'serious', 'movie', 'fans', 'pass', 'one', 'up.My', 'verdict', 'Make', 'dust', 'collector', 'rental', 'shelves']",N/A

Ultimately it is no Silence of the Lambs, and you will not need to see this  film more than once, though a second viewing might be in order if you  really need to see if they show the killer earlier in the film.",3,"Not A Classic, but OK",955238400,"04 9, 2000",2000,721,"['film', 'had', 'good', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'interesting', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'killer', 'earlier', 'film', 'father', 'who', 'watched', 'have', 'remembered', 'killer', 'motive', 'seemed', 'absurd', 'too', 'Still', 'found', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'be', 'watchable', 'fans', 'genre', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Ultimately', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'will', 'not', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'second', 'viewing', 'might', 'be', 'order', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'show', 'killer', 'earlier', 'film']",N/A

Setting his finger to a computer, he is able to manipulate his environment with the help of a loving nurse. Even so, fearing seizures that could leave him a vegetable, he plans his ""transition"" with the help of a hesitational doctor friend. That all changes when he is confronted with clues from a serial killer that obviously are pointed to forensics investigation. The case clearly re-invokes his interest in life. A sharp, young cop's quick thinking saves the first crime scene. Recognizing her talent for forensics, he brings her unwillingly into forensics detection. Through radio contact, she becomes his eyes and legs on the scene. Michael Rooker also appears as the police captain, who has bungled earlier killings by the serial killer and is more interested in the press than in good police work. Ed O'Neill and Luis Guzman are support staff who aid Washington and run interference with Rooker. This is a great movie with a great storyline and great actors. This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. A movie that will keep you guessing and all though it.

68808,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,0783240295,wellwellwell,"[2, 2]","Denzel Washington stars as Detective Lincoln Rhyme.  But Rhyme, being a good and established detective, is laid up for life.  Years before the story takes place, he was hit so hard in an accident that his body was almost cut in half.  He survived the incident, though he now has to work from his bed with the use of only his brain and his pointer finger.  The plot, as noted by other reviewers, is not too original, but the movie does has it's high points.For instance, the sensual Angelina Jolie co-stars with Washington as she plays Amelia Donaghy.  What makes her character so interesting is that she's very good at what she does.  Yet, she's afraid to move on due to the fact that her father killed himself doing the same type of work.  And throughout the film she is faced with many hardships and danger that she is not used to.  What the two (Washington and Jolie) are studying is the recent trend of murders involving small clues that appear to tie together.  By now you're probably thinking the plot is similar to that of &quot;Seven&quot; or even &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;; and for the most part you are right.  Again, it's not very original and it doesn't quite compare to either of those two films.  But it will keep you guessing.  I can honestly say I didn't see the ending coming.  And the appearance by Ed O'Neill (aka Married...With Children's infamous Al Bundy) as Detective Paulie is a definite plus for the movie.To conclude this review, I can't recommend this movie over the much better &quot;Seven&quot;.  But if you enjoy, as I do, Denzel Washington's movies/work then you'll certainly enjoy &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;.  I gave it 3 stars for its lack of originality and seemingly 'too happy' ending.

Angelina also is very good, although her  transformation from a cop that is reluctant to help to full-blown crime  scene investigator takes place too quickly.The film does have some  pretty graphic scenes, although nothing that has not been seen before.  Furthermore, the movie has some great shots, specially of a heavy rain  pouring over New York, where every droplet can be seen in all of its DVD  glory.  Unfortunately, most of these beautifully arranged shots are shown  during the 30 second intro to the DVD menu.Anyway, the movie creates a  nice feeling of suspense and anxiety, although Jolie's character, again,  develops too quickly into a full-blown crime scene investigator, which I  found to be somewhat unbelievable.  My major complaint is w/ the  ending.SPOILER ALERT - MAY GIVE AWAY PLOT INFORMATIONThe motivation  of the killer is kind of cobbled together and thrown in during the last 5  minutes.  Nothing really relevant to the plot - just some generic excuse to  have this person rampage through New York.  Did not convince me.  Also,  although the killer speaks of clues placed at the scenes, they don't really  point to the identity of the killer - just to the possible locale and  demise of the victims.  Although I grant that the whole point of the clues  was whether the police could save the victims, the killer only left a  deadline for one of the victims.
