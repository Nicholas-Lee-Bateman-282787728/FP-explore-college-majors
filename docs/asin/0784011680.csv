76069,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0784011680,,"[0, 0]","Chaplin was a great Artist, and a pioneer of film, arguably the great art form of the 20th Century. American Poet Hart Crane put it this way, in his poem, Chaplinesque:We make our meek adjustments,Contented with such random consolationsAs the wind depositsIn slithered and too ample pockets.For we can still love the world, who findA famished kitten on the step, and knowRecesses for it from the fury of the street,Or warm torn elbow coverts.We will sidestep, and to the final smirkDally the doom of that inevitable thumbThat slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,Facing the dull squint with what innocenceAnd what surprise!And what surprise it was for Hart when after answering a knock on his door he saw a friend with the great comedian himself in tow. The three spent many whimsical hours together, I'm sure. I will continue the poem at this review's conclusion. While I never had the privilege of meeting Mr. Chaplin, I almost feel like I have, after seeing Richard Attenborough's film, Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. gave an excellent performance, recreating the great comedy and character of The Little Tramp, and also providing insight into the man behind the myth.I remember seeing Chaplin finally honored by the Academy after living in exile for so many years. There was a confused, frightened look in his eyes, as if he was afraid that he was about to be ambushed by his old nemesis, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked, as Hart Crane said in another poem, ""confused among the chrysanthemums."" There was also something else, the sense that his contribution was appreciated after all. He was finally getting validation. Robert Downey Jr. really captured that bittersweet moment, and all the other moments in Chaplin's life.Chaplin's case and the memorable ""Oscar Moment"" reminded me of two other events at the Oscars. One was when Roman Polanski, also in exile, won Best Director for The Pianist. Compare and contrast Chaplin's case with Roman Polanski. Discuss it amongst yourselves, as I have no real point to make--only that it was oddly similar, and oddly different. Then when Elia Kazan won a Lifetime Achievement award, some people refused to stand up for his standing ovation. Nick Nolte sat there looking as grim as a Malibu mug shot. Chris Rock later commented on the incongruity between the reaction for Polanski and the one for Kazan, who had named names to HUAC. How rude of Rock, and no wonder he wasn't asked back to host, but he did have a point.Chaplin, the film, makes a very good case that J. Edgar Hoover persecuted Chaplin, the man. There is a scene where Charlie is shown (wittily but unwittingly) planting the seeds of rancor:--------------------------J. Edgar Hoover: I have to wonder if you people realize the level of responsibility you carry. From my way of thinking, Motion Pictures are potentially the most influential form of communication ever invented. And there's no control over it. Your message reaches everyone, everywhere.Mary Pickford: Message?J. Edgar Hoover: Of course, Mr. Chaplin here reaches millions who only have to see; and when they see a mockery being made of our immigration services, I call that a message.Charlie Chaplin: Yes, well, uh, as you've already said Mr. Hoover, Motion Pictures are for the people; most of the people work for a living, and they don't make much money doing it; gives them pleasure to see an official from the upper classes getting a kick up the backside. Always has, and it always will; and if that can change things, so much the better.[in a better pronounced, less cockney voice]Charlie Chaplin: Bet-ter.=====================================What was it that Frank Zappa said about the reason Lenny Bruce died? And what was it Richard Nixon said to H.R. Haldeman when he heard that J. Edgar Hoover had died? Funny (again not funny ha ha) that Anthony Hopkins and James Woods, both in this film, played Nixon and Haldeman, respectively, in Oliver Stone's Nixon. And what were the final two stanzas of Hart Crane's poem, Chaplinesque? Why, look down below:And yet these fine collapses are not liesMore than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.We can evade you, and all else but the heart:What blame to us if the heart live on.The game enforces smirks; but we have seenThe moon in lonely alleys makeA grail of laughter of an empty ash can,And through all sound of gaiety and questHave heard a kitten in the wilderness.Geraldine Chaplin played her own grandmother, Charlie Chaplin's mother, Hannah, who was plagued by madness. She was excellent, but what would you expect? It's in her blood. Her presence gave the whole project the Chaplin Stamp of Approval.John Thaw was familiar to me as Inspector Morse, the title character from the British detective program. He played impresario Fred Karno, who gave Chaplin his first job, but also boorishly sabotaged his budding romance with Hetty Kelly. Akroyd was good as Mack Sennett, the man who gave Chaplin his big break in the film industry. James Woods was the 'persecuting attorney' who tried Chaplin in a bogus paternity suit. Anthony Hopkins was playing an editor, and had a utilitarian role to move the exposition along, when Chaplin was being vague about certain aspects of his personal life. A framing device. Not an actual person, a composite character.Kevin Kline was good as Douglas Fairbanks, doing some impressive stunts, but I can see him as Cole Porter in De-Lovely, or Guy Noir in A Prairie Home Companion, but I don't see him as Douglas Fairbanks. Funny (not funny ha ha, but funny weird/strange) that in the bonus material of Prairie Home Companion his fellow thespians, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, describe him as ""our generation's Chaplin."" Though he played The Pirate King in a film of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, that still doesn't qualify him to play Fairbanks. A minor quibble. He did a good job, but he didn't melt into his character like Robert Downey Jr.Moira Kelly played a dual role: both Hetty Kelly, young Charlie's first crush, and Oona O'Neill Chaplin, his last wife. I guess that was supposed to show that he was searching for that lost love of his youth. Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, and Milla Jovovich played other women in Chaplin's life.Bottom line is Chaplin was a very good film, successful as a biopic, and also as an historical chronicle showing the role of film and comedy in our country's history, and the intersection of politics and comedy. The Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Supporting Cast were all top notch. Great performance by Downey, who is a master of comedy and drama, and also not a stranger to controversy in his own life. He was perfect for this role. He could relate.---------------------------------Charlie Chaplin: Nothing quite like it.

76070,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0784011680,,"[0, 0]","Charlie Chaplin is played by Robert Downey, Jr., but also by Chaplin himself in old films, both his own movies and various studio publicity and news items. Another odd little twist is that Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother, Charlie's mother. The only truly fictional character is played by Anthony Hopkins, an editor on the writing of Chaplin's biography, or perhaps his literary agent, or something. In any case, it gives him the excuse to ask the elderly Chaplin questions about his early years and provide narration for the story.Dan Aykroyd is just right playing Mack Sennett, the director/producer who gave Chaplin his start in films. Kevin Kline plays Douglas Fairbanks and Maria Pitillo plays Mary Pickford, two of Chaplin's closest friends. For the villain of the piece, Kevin Dunn plays J. Edgar Hoover.Chaplain was married four or five times -- I rather lost track -- and at one point was sued for child support for a child that was not his because the State of California would not admit blood test evidence in court. Not DNA, mind you, but just blood type. Chaplin and the baby were tested, but the judge suppressed the evidence that would have exonerated him from responsibility. He paid child support until the girl turned 18.The last marriage, to Oona O'Neill (Moira Kelly), was the only one that lasted, and that for more than 20 years. In fact, I think it was more than 30 years, because the setting of when he wrote his autobiography was at least ten years before he died. Oona was only 18, Chaplin was already middle aged, when they married. It seems she may have been the only wife who actually loved him, rather than his money and his fame.A lot of the political material in the film was things I had not known, including the fact that he was criticized for making ""The Great Dictator"" before the US got into the war, and only praised for it once we were in it. Another is that Hoover eventually had him barred from returning to the states after he'd spent some time in London, arguing that he was a communist. It became quite clear that Chaplin was by no means a communist, with lower case or capital letter, but rather a humanist. Hoover, never one of the great intellectual lights of the nation, was unable to tell the difference, and cited the fact that Chaplin had never renounced his British citizenship and applied for American citizenship.An interesting biography of an interesting person.",4,A Unique Biography,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2428,"['Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'played', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'also', 'Chaplin', 'old', 'films', 'own', 'movies', 'various', 'studio', 'publicity', 'news', 'items', 'odd', 'little', 'twist', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'own', 'grandmother', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'only', 'truly', 'fictional', 'character', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'editor', 'writing', 'Chaplin', 'biography', 'perhaps', 'literary', 'agent', 'something', 'case', 'excuse', 'ask', 'elderly', 'Chaplin', 'questions', 'early', 'years', 'provide', 'narration', 'story.Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'just', 'right', 'playing', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'director/producer', 'who', 'gave', 'Chaplin', 'start', 'films', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Maria', 'Pitillo', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'two', 'Chaplin', 'closest', 'friends', 'villain', 'piece', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover.Chaplain', 'was', 'married', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'rather', 'lost', 'track', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'sued', 'child', 'support', 'child', 'was', 'not', 'State', 'California', 'would', 'not', 'admit', 'blood', 'test', 'evidence', 'court', 'Not', 'DNA', 'mind', 'just', 'blood', 'type', 'Chaplin', 'baby', 'were', 'tested', 'judge', 'suppressed', 'evidence', 'would', 'have', 'exonerated', 'responsibility', 'paid', 'child', 'support', 'girl', 'turned', '18.The', 'last', 'marriage', 'Oona', ""O'Neill"", 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'lasted', 'more', '20', 'years', 'fact', 'think', 'was', 'more', '30', 'years', 'setting', 'when', 'wrote', 'autobiography', 'was', 'least', 'ten', 'years', 'died', 'Oona', 'was', 'only', '18', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'already', 'middle', 'aged', 'when', 'married', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'wife', 'who', 'actually', 'loved', 'rather', 'money', 'fame.A', 'lot', 'political', 'material', 'film', 'was', 'things', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'including', 'fact', 'was', 'criticized', 'making', 'Great', 'Dictator', 'US', 'got', 'war', 'only', 'praised', 'once', 'were', 'Hoover', 'eventually', 'had', 'barred', 'returning', 'states', ""'d"", 'spent', 'time', 'London', 'arguing', 'was', 'communist', 'became', 'quite', 'clear', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'communist', 'lower', 'case', 'capital', 'letter', 'rather', 'humanist', 'Hoover', 'never', 'one', 'great', 'intellectual', 'lights', 'nation', 'was', 'unable', 'tell', 'difference', 'cited', 'fact', 'Chaplin', 'had', 'never', 'renounced', 'British', 'citizenship', 'applied', 'American', 'citizenship.An', 'interesting', 'biography', 'interesting', 'person']",Chaplin

76077,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0784011680,,"[0, 1]","Downey's performance in Chaplin is a one-man tour de force. Done at a time before Downey's own problems started creating problems for his acting career, it is probably the role for which he will be best remembered. Downey shows Chaplin to be a complex, multifacetted man who had many both good and bad qualities, but most importantly, was a creative and even visionary artist whose approach still couldn't halt the advent of the talkies. As Downey says in the movie, ""If the little tramp speaks, the mystery is gone."" But for better or for worse, the technology and the art of cinema were taking off in a different direction, after which it would never be quite the same. Overall Downey's best movie and one that should stand the test of time.Byt the way, this is an interesting snippet from a brief bio of Chaplin's life from the IMBD website, which I thought I'd post here:""In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a lot. He also had an ""un-millionaire"" way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations.In 1921 Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker, and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972 he was honored with an Academy Award for his ""incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century."" In 1975 England's Queen Elizabeth II knighted him. Chaplin's other works included musical scores he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, ""My Autobiography"" in 1964 and its companion volume, ""My Life in Pictures"" in 1974. Chaplin died of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Switzerland.In 1978, Chaplin's corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement. Charlie Chaplin was considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world, and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp's positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.",5,A brief comment,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,2252,"['Downey', 'performance', 'Chaplin', 'one-man', 'tour', 'force', 'Done', 'time', 'Downey', 'own', 'problems', 'started', 'creating', 'problems', 'acting', 'career', 'probably', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'remembered', 'Downey', 'Chaplin', 'be', 'complex', 'multifacetted', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'many', 'good', 'bad', 'qualities', 'most', 'importantly', 'was', 'creative', 'even', 'visionary', 'artist', 'approach', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'halt', 'advent', 'talkies', 'Downey', 'movie', 'little', 'tramp', 'speaks', 'mystery', 'gone', 'better', 'worse', 'technology', 'art', 'cinema', 'were', 'taking', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'quite', 'same', 'Overall', 'Downey', 'best', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'stand', 'test', 'time.Byt', 'way', 'interesting', 'snippet', 'brief', 'bio', 'Chaplin', 'life', 'IMBD', 'website', 'thought', ""'d"", 'post', 'here', 'contrast', 'many', 'boisterous', 'characters', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'kept', 'lot', 'also', 'had', 'un-millionaire', 'way', 'living', 'Even', 'had', 'accumulated', 'millions', 'continued', 'live', 'shabby', 'accommodations.In', '1921', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'decorated', 'French', 'government', 'outstanding', 'work', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'elevated', 'rank', 'Officer', 'Legion', 'Honor', '1952', '1972', 'was', 'honored', 'Academy', 'Award', 'incalculable', 'effect', 'making', 'motion', 'art', 'form', 'century', '1975', 'England', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'knighted', 'Chaplin', 'other', 'works', 'included', 'musical', 'scores', 'composed', 'many', 'films', 'also', 'authored', 'two', 'autobiographical', 'books', 'Autobiography', '1964', 'companion', 'volume', 'Life', 'Pictures', '1974', 'Chaplin', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'December', '25', '1977', 'home', 'Switzerland.In', '1978', 'Chaplin', 'corpse', 'was', 'stolen', 'grave', 'was', 'not', 'recovered', 'three', 'months', 'was', 're-buried', 'vault', 'surrounded', 'cement', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'history', 'American', 'cinema', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'popular', 'world', 'have', 'even', 'gained', 'notoriety', 'time', 'films', 'show', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'positive', 'outlook', 'life', 'world', 'full', 'chaos', 'human', 'spirit', 'always', 'will', 'remain', 'same']",Chaplin

76080,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,0784011680,,"[0, 2]","Chaplin manages to be an effective Bio pic of one of Hollywood's most famous Silent Film stars Charlie Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) despite simply jumping from one moment in his life to next. For instance when Charlie says he's going to be a director, it just jumps to him saying that after that he directed over 100 movies in one year. The film is long, yet it feels rushed. Downey Jr's performance is inspired and possibly his best performance, but the film itself doesn't feel too inspired.I mean we're supposed to believe that a woman that is only in 2 scenes was his lost love. This is how the film tries to make us believe that. Chaplin is helping a performer with her dress and sees a young actress changing, she's mad he's there, but lets him hold a mirror for her as she puts on lip-stick. Then suddenly the film jumps to them on a date and him asking her to marry him. Did I miss something ? When did he even ask her out and when did she even act like she liked him before that ? Then the film jumps to him getting invited to act in Hollywood and the film doesn't even bother showing him upset that he had to leave her or even show them say goodbye to each other.The film introduces Kevin Kline as Chaplin's best friend just as lazy. He simply is just shown playing tennis with Chaplin and I don't think we're even shown how these 2 met. Still, Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline work excellent together. It's the case where Chaplin works due to the actors pulling through better than the script. The film manges to be moving and effective but mostly due to performances by actors like Downey Jr. and Kevin Kline.The way Chaplin is unfairly treated like a communist by the President (Kevin Dunn) and a lawyer (James Woods) is well done though. Other than that the movie just jumps from Chaplin being with one woman to the next. It's how he was mis-treated that makes us feel for the guy. Chaplin says in public that he won't shake the hand of a Nazi, yet his film The Great Dictator where he dresses up like Hitler backfires in his face and finally gives the President a good reason to call him a communist.",4,Downey Jr. is great but the script could have been better,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2108,"['Chaplin', 'be', 'effective', 'Bio', 'pic', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'famous', 'Silent', 'Film', 'stars', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'simply', 'jumping', 'one', 'moment', 'life', 'next', 'instance', 'when', 'Charlie', 'going', 'be', 'director', 'just', 'saying', 'directed', '100', 'movies', 'one', 'year', 'film', 'long', 'rushed', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'performance', 'inspired', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'inspired.I', 'mean', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'woman', 'only', '2', 'scenes', 'was', 'lost', 'love', 'how', 'film', 'make', 'believe', 'Chaplin', 'helping', 'performer', 'dress', 'young', 'actress', 'changing', 'mad', 'there', 'hold', 'mirror', 'lip-stick', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'film', 'jumps', 'date', 'asking', 'marry', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'When', 'did', 'even', 'ask', 'out', 'when', 'did', 'even', 'act', 'liked', 'Then', 'film', 'jumps', 'getting', 'invited', 'act', 'Hollywood', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'showing', 'upset', 'had', 'leave', 'even', 'show', 'say', 'goodbye', 'other.The', 'film', 'introduces', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Chaplin', 'best', 'friend', 'just', 'lazy', 'simply', 'just', 'shown', 'playing', 'tennis', 'Chaplin', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'even', 'shown', 'how', '2', 'met', 'Still', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'work', 'excellent', 'together', 'case', 'where', 'Chaplin', 'due', 'actors', 'pulling', 'better', 'script', 'film', 'manges', 'be', 'moving', 'effective', 'mostly', 'due', 'performances', 'actors', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Kevin', 'Kline.The', 'way', 'Chaplin', 'unfairly', 'treated', 'communist', 'President', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'lawyer', 'James', 'Woods', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'Other', 'movie', 'just', 'jumps', 'Chaplin', 'being', 'one', 'woman', 'next', 'how', 'was', 'mis-treated', 'feel', 'guy', 'Chaplin', 'public', 'wo', ""n't"", 'shake', 'hand', 'Nazi', 'yet', 'film', 'Great', 'Dictator', 'where', 'up', 'Hitler', 'backfires', 'face', 'finally', 'President', 'good', 'reason', 'call', 'communist']",Chaplin

76083,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784011680,,"[1, 1]","`Chaplin' has a lot going for it.  It's a biopic and that always rests well with me.  The subject of that said biopic is a man who was famous for his ability to entertain.  The star cast in that important role of lead delivers a performance so electrifying there's no wonder why he received the Oscar nomination.  The rest of the cast is so star studded you're drawn to the prospect of what you'll see, even if every apart from the star is limited in their screen time.  It's faithfully directed by a man who adored and respected his subject.  But, without a script, without a story none of this really matters.  So, what makes `Chaplin' a film worth every second is the fact that it tells quite a story.The life of Charlie Chaplin was one filled with rises and falls.  He started off struggling but then rose almost immediately before falling back down only to be lifted up once again.  It's a rollercoaster of a way to live, but it makes for one interesting journey for the audience.  Charlie Chaplin started his life dirt poor.  What made things worse was the fact that his mother, for her own good, was admitted to an asylum while Charlie was still quite young.  His mothers theatrical aspirations did have an impact on Charlie though, a good one, for he soon made a name for himself as a comedian of the stage.  It wasn't until he moved to the states to pursue film roles though that he became the face behind silent film.`Chaplin' would be little more than a good story without the brilliant performance given by Robert Downey Jr., a performance that captures the essence that was Charlie Chaplin and exposes this man to the full.  Downey Jr. understands Chaplin and brings so much light and charisma to this role, a role that defined him as a star and not just a Hollywood bad-boy.  I only wish that Robert Downey Jr. could receive more roles of this nature for he really sinks his teeth into this performance and drags out something everyone can admire and respect.  He captured the emotional depth of this man while embellishing the signature charm and comedic grace of the legend himself.  A far cry from a mere mimic, Downey Jr. slipped away inside this man and recreated him from the ground up.Sadly, this was released the same year as `Malcolm X' so I can't truthfully say that Robert Downey Jr. was robbed of the Oscar.  In fact Denzel Washington was robbed of the Oscar, but that's for another review.The film exposes the good as well as the bad times in this mans life, from his womanizing days, his many marriages and his confrontations with J. Edgar Hoover, a volatile relationship that caused much heartache in Chaplin's life.  It never rushes things but takes it time to flesh out this man and create a feeling of truly knowing him inside and out.  Apparently the original cut of the film was nearly four hours long, and while that seems like a long time I'd be interested in seeing the film in its entirety for I'm sure there is so much more of this mans life that would be intriguing to discover.  Still, with all the cuts made to the film it never appears condensed or lacking.The film sports a slew of supporting performances, all of which are brilliantly crafted by the cast.  Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother Hannah effortlessly with such commanding presence and Paul Rhys is able to play second fiddle to the star without giving up is star power entirely.  The beautiful actresses who played the women in Charlie's life all do splendid jobs, Diane Lane in particular is stunning and makes the most lasting impression.  Moira Kelly is wonderful as Chaplin's loving wife Oona, but she lacks the screen presence that Lane brings to her performance.  Milla Jovovich is stunning as Charlie's first wife Mildred and Dan Aykroyd is in top form as Mack Sennett and delivers an exciting and well rounded comedic performance.  The cast is so extensive it's really hard to single out everyone, but one performer that needs to be mentioned is Kevin Kline who just delivers effortlessly as Charlie's good friend Douglas Fairbanks.  He's charming and graceful and so in tune with her character it's an utter joy to watch.`Chaplin' delivers everything you could ask for in a biopic.

The comic genius who showed the world what comedy was and introduced American society into the film era. This film, simply put, was amazing. I was hesitant at first to see how well Robert Downy, Jr would do as one of the most influential men in movie history...and he was on target. He showed the brilliance of Chaplin, and also showed a bit of his dark side. The side that not many knew about...his underage womanizing, his constant pursuit of perfection over anything else in the world, and also as the humanitarian.Chaplin did more for film then any other actor during his time, and it showed. Although my biggest gripe about this film would be the director, the actors themselves took me away from my seat an into the life of Charlie Chaplin. This film stared Dan Ankroyd, Anthony Hopkins, Moria Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Marisa Tomei, James Woods, Diane Lane, Nancy Travis, Kevin Kline, and even a favorite of mine...Milla Jovovich.

Now, don't get me wrong...he does good work...just this one was not his ""cup of tea"".  I went into this film expecting a darker ending...a darker story...and a darker character.  We all knew how funny he was, but how dark was his humor...when I went back and looked at some of his old silent films (before the ""talkies"") I was amazed by how many of them portray his life...the darker aspects of his life.  There are many scenes about his mother and how she was put into an asylum by Chaplin himself.  Hopkins makes the comment, ""Your grandmother was certified insane, and your mother was certified insane...where did you get your humor?"" That line made me think...I would have liked to see the trauma that was impacted him as a child.Douglas Fairbanks (played wonderfully by Kevin Kline) said to him, ""You know you look like him, Hitler...with the mustache. I think he stole your bit."" and Chaplin just smiles....was there something there that we didn't know about...was Chaplin a communist although his brother was a Jew.  These were confusing, and the director did not cover these grounds.Downey in several of the scenes tells Hopkins (the book reviewer) that he doesn't want to talk about it...and they don't .... I wanted them to go deeper into his psyche and see where all of it came from.  Most of these points were just passing glance...which irritated me. Watch the ending, the director tries to wrap up Chaplin's life at the Academy Awards, and that was when it hit me about how much darker I wanted this to be...I don't know, I guess I am the generation of JFK and Nixon or Oliver Stone at his best...but I needed darker.I know it was there.....I just know it!!!!Grade:  *** out of *****",3,"If you want to understand me, watch my movies.",1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2902,"['Directed', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'director', 'Gandhi', 'story', 'Sir', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'comic', 'genius', 'who', 'showed', 'world', 'what', 'comedy', 'was', 'introduced', 'American', 'society', 'film', 'era', 'film', 'simply', 'put', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'hesitant', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'men', 'movie', 'history', 'was', 'target', 'showed', 'brilliance', 'Chaplin', 'also', 'showed', 'bit', 'dark', 'side', 'side', 'not', 'many', 'knew', 'underage', 'womanizing', 'constant', 'pursuit', 'perfection', 'anything', 'else', 'world', 'also', 'humanitarian.Chaplin', 'did', 'more', 'film', 'then', 'other', 'actor', 'time', 'showed', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'director', 'actors', 'took', 'away', 'seat', 'life', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'stared', 'Dan', 'Ankroyd', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Moria', 'Kelly', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'James', 'Woods', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'even', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'star', 'cast', 'pushed', 'movie', 'excellence', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'autobiographical', 'pieces', 'ever', 'made', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'director', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'work', 'just', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'darker', 'ending', 'darker', 'story', 'darker', 'character', 'knew', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'how', 'dark', 'was', 'humor', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'looked', 'old', 'silent', 'films', 'talkies', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'portray', 'life', 'darker', 'aspects', 'life', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'mother', 'how', 'was', 'put', 'asylum', 'Chaplin', 'comment', 'grandmother', 'was', 'certified', 'insane', 'mother', 'was', 'certified', 'insane', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'humor', 'line', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'trauma', 'was', 'impacted', 'child.Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'said', 'know', 'look', 'Hitler', 'mustache', 'think', 'stole', 'bit', 'Chaplin', 'just', 'smiles', '.was', 'there', 'something', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Chaplin', 'communist', 'brother', 'was', 'Jew', 'were', 'confusing', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'cover', 'grounds.Downey', 'several', 'scenes', 'tells', 'Hopkins', 'book', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'go', 'deeper', 'psyche', 'see', 'where', 'came', 'Most', 'points', 'were', 'just', 'passing', 'glance', 'irritated', 'Watch', 'ending', 'director', 'wrap', 'up', 'Chaplin', 'life', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'when', 'hit', 'how', 'much', 'darker', 'wanted', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guess', 'am', 'generation', 'JFK', 'Nixon', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'needed', 'darker.I', 'know', 'was', 'there', 'just', 'know', 'Grade', '***', '*****']",Chaplin

76088,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0784011680,,"[3, 5]","It is probably not the best film ever made about Charlie Chaplin, and I even think it is far behind Charlie Chaplin's own autobiography on which it is supposed to be based. But it makes a couple of points rather well. First, show business is business first of all. Brutal, expeditious, pitiless, cruel, full of hate and with hardly any love, except the illusion of a companionship they call love in Hollywood. But we know that. And even the FBI or McCarthy could not touch that: business money is  business money and cannot be spoiled even if the owner is a communist or at least is accused of being one. Second, McCarthyism was an ugly adventure in the USA, but it is shown as having run in the texture of the country from the very start and particularly after the Russian revolution. The best part about it is that it made American politicians suspicious of anything that was not lauding the USA as THE ONLY country of freedom (except of course for those that have been declared unwanted characters, or anything that could in anyway seem to be supporting the poor, the working class, the underlings of this egotistic world. The portrait of Edgar Hoover is that of a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and yet nothing but an apparatchik that never leaves his pacifying desk and the comfortable warmth of his office. Third, this film shows so well through Chaplin's own life how the world changed and how no politician can stop it. A politician can make some people suffer, at times a lot when he has the means to go out and wage war, but even so he will not be able to change history, to stop history, to even strand or wreck history. Hitler is the best case at hand. The amount of suffering he caused is enormous and yet did he stop history, did he block it into some eternal barbaric dictatorship? Of course not. And Charlie Chaplin's wisecrack about not having the honor of being a Jew is the best answer anyone could do to any attempt at hijacking history: I don't have the honor of being your victim, and if I were your victim I would be honored to be one of them, to have their company.

The period accuracy is well done, and the acting is superb and just shows more of Chaplin doing what he does best - making people laugh! But of course it all showed the negative side when you see James Woods as a prosecutor working hard to nail Chaplin for anti-American sentiments and making Chaplin pay $75.00 a week in a paternity case.To his credit, Sir Richard Attenborough shows Chaplin as the social activist who had an FBI file close to 2,000 pages in length. The drama, at times, seemed a bit much for someone known for bringing joy to so many... perhaps, therein lies the irony of Chaplin's life. Seeing this film makes you appreciate why Chaplin was a genius, especially seeing Robert Downey, Jr. in top form in this Oscar nominated performance and ode to one of cinema's greatest artists who was the forerunner for such ""control freaks"" as Warren Beatty and Orson Wells.

76094,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0784011680,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Every so often, when I look up the historical critical context of a film, I am surprised by what I find. Most often I see films that are schlock get undue praise, but since most of anything in life is bad (lest we'd not notice the good). This is not unusual. Then there are good or great films that are severely dissed. Almost every Stanley Kubrick film, post-1970, falls into this category. But, then there are films which are nice little films, not particularly bad, but also nowhere near great, that just elicit an off reaction from critics. Such a film is Richard Attenborough's 1992 film, Chaplin, on the life of filmdom's first true superstar. Is it a great film? No. It's a rather standard biopic, and pretty much in line with what the director did, a decade earlier, in Gandhi. Like that film, this one features a previously little known actor who `arrived' via a career-making turn in the title role. In Gandhi it was Ben Kingsley. In Chaplin it is Robert Downey, Jr.Most of the kvetching revolves around the fact that the film uses a flashback sequence, or that a character played by Anthony Hopkins is fictive, or that the film focuses too much on the personal and sex life of Chaplin. But, let's look at these plaints. First, that a work of art uses a standard technique does not mean that it is trite. It can be trite, or it can be used very effectively. This film splits the difference. It's neither here nor there in that regard. Second, so what that the Hopkins character was not `real'? Again, it's a standard technique, and like the flashback structure, the use of a fictive character is neither here nor there. Third, a biopic could focus on the art of an artist, if the artist was not a film star, to great effect. But, since Chaplin was a film star, the reason the film exists is because everyone knows who he is, in his art. Therefore, only hints of his personal life are fodder for any extrapolation. And the only nudity the film shows is a rear view shot of Milla Jovovich's buttocks, as she portrays Chaplin's first wife, Mildred Harris.That said, and despite the assorted sex scandals that littered his personal life, Chaplin's personal life was rather dull. The real flaw of the film is that which haunts most biopics, and that is it tries to do the cradle to grave schtick, instead of picking a specific period of the comedian's life, and expounding upon it. One of the best biopics of all time, Patton, follows this method. The DVD, by LionsGate, is the 15th Anniversary Edition. Despite that honorific, the DVD is not top notch. Yes, the film transfer, in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, is well done, but there is no audio commentary on the disk. This is an alarming trend on many DVDs, especially considering that the costs for producing them has dropped precipitously in the last decade. There are a few bonuses, but they are meager. There's a brief home movie of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard cruising on his yacht off the California coast.

Robert Downey, Jr. literally steals the show away from such heavyweights as Anthony Hopkins and the film's director, Richard Attenborough.Though Attenborough, he himself an Oscar winning director, does some clever things to draw you into the world of Chaplin (making the film look old and distressed, using the same shakey &quot;hand-cranking&quot; speeds for action sequences, and use of moody, uneven lighting), his tempo for the film seems painfully slow at times, and at over two hours, the picture feels much longer.The film is packed with stars in small roles, as everyone plays second banana to Chaplin--Marisa Tomei, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovney, Dan Akroyd, Moira Kelly, and Geraldine Chaplin, just to name a few. The period accuracy is well done, and the acting is superb, however, the direction is heavy-handed--a major fault of Attenborough's other films, too, and leaves you feeling frustrated--just show more of Chaplin doing what he does best--making people laugh!To his credit, however, the director does show Chaplin as the social activist who had an FBI file close to 2,000 pages in length.  The drama, at times, seemed a bit much for someone known for bringing joy to so many...perhaps, therein lies the irony of Chaplin's life.  See this film to be educated, and see it to see Robert Downey, Jr. in top form in this Oscar nominated performance and ode to one of cinema's greatest artists who was the forerunner for such &quot;control freaks&quot; as Warren Beatty and Orson Wells.

It explores the life of Charlie Chaplin with all the complexities that life has to offer.This film is a beautiful work of art. Quality that rivals Hollywoods Golden Age that we rarely get to see. Centered around an actual storyline rather than relying on special effects, or over-payed ""A-List"" movie stars. Each actor/actress was carefully chosen. Great depth and detail went into this film. Included in the writing credits is Charlie Chaplin himself from his book (IMDB), so that adds an additional credibility to the content of the film.Another aspect that brings life to this story is the amazing Geraldine Chaplin, Charlies daughter, who had the wonderful job of portraying her grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.Robert Downey Jr pours his soul into bringing this character to life. This is by far the finest performance of his career, of which he should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but lost out to Clint Eastwood for Unforgiven (of all films).If Robert's and Geraldine's uncanny performances and Sir Richard Attenborough's brilliant directorial vison isn't enough; the film sports an all-star cast including:Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks,Sir Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann  Miller, Kevin Dunn (as J.

Chaplin had one heck of a complicated, long life with many severe ups and downs! Fortunately for us, they got some of these important factors right. The film runs well over two hours, but I never felt truly satisfied with the detail of many scenes. The biggest flaw is that some areas of his life are whisked by so fast it's hard to grasp everything.Robert Downey Jr. should get a lot of credit as without his believable portrayal of this man, the movie could never work at all.

""BobTheCopywriter""","[100, 106]","If you're anything like me, the almost semi-annual relapse and recovery of Robert Downey Jr. has been an interesting periodic feature of the morning news. After a while one begins to question why does Hollywood put up with him when there is no shortage of talented actors desperately trying to make it in Hollywood? Why would producers and studios, who are so financially dependent on their productions going off without a hitch, take yet another chance on Robert Downey, Jr? Then I saw Chaplin, and I understood.The intensity and power of the Robert Downey's performance in this film is the stuff of Oscars and true movie legend! It's both a beautiful performance and a beautiful film!Somehow Sir Richard Attenborough got out of Downey the kind of performance that can sustain a career, and a legend. But Sir Richard's mastery didn't stop there. He got spectacular performance out of everyone, including a young, pre-X-Files David Duchovny. (I know I misspelled that. But you know who I mean.)In summation, Robert Downey's performance is every bit the equal of James Dean's in Giant, East of Eden or Rebel without a Cause, and maybe that's what we should keep in mind. For unlike Dean, another self-destructive personality, Robert Downey has not driven off the cliff yet, and hopefully he never will.",5,Robert Downey Junior - The Bad Boy at His Best,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,1301,"[""'re"", 'anything', 'almost', 'semi-annual', 'relapse', 'recovery', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'been', 'interesting', 'periodic', 'feature', 'morning', 'news', 'while', 'one', 'question', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'up', 'when', 'shortage', 'talented', 'actors', 'desperately', 'trying', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'Why', 'would', 'producers', 'studios', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'financially', 'dependent', 'productions', 'going', 'off', 'hitch', 'take', 'yet', 'chance', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'Then', 'saw', 'Chaplin', 'understood.The', 'intensity', 'power', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'performance', 'film', 'stuff', 'Oscars', 'true', 'movie', 'legend', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Somehow', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'got', 'Downey', 'kind', 'performance', 'can', 'sustain', 'career', 'legend', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'mastery', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'got', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'everyone', 'including', 'young', 'pre-X-Files', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'know', 'misspelled', 'know', 'who', 'mean', 'summation', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'performance', 'bit', 'equal', 'James', 'Dean', 'Giant', 'East', 'Eden', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'maybe', 'what', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'Dean', 'self-destructive', 'personality', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'not', 'driven', 'off', 'cliff', 'yet', 'hopefully', 'never', 'will']",Chaplin

Hebbron ""S B H.""","[3, 3]","It must be enormously difficult to produce a worthy biographical movie, the subject matter can be less clourful than the ""Famous"" persona suggests. Critical scrutiny of the work is always going to be harsh and purist, particularly from family and the fan base. Chaplin is a more rounded and colourful subject than most but that notion in itself would not make the project easy.Attenborough does a sterling job given that the story has to span several decades of enormous change, incorporate a massive cast and demonstrate Chaplin's artistic importance as well as the complexities of his personal life.Downey Jr is an outstanding star and gives Chaplin a a fuller and more human character and face which is at once tragic, loving, driven,even sexy. His British accent is impeccable, I actually for got he is American very early on which is praise indeed from a native Brit, his Englishness was far better than Rees's Americanisation (the actor who plays Sydney Chaplin and is actually British, he is great in the role nonetheless).Downey Jr also manages to portray a sense of iron hard strength and lost and lonely vulnerability that were the essential components of Chaplin's personality. Downey Jr also works hard to get a sense of Chaplin's balletic, choreographed comedy. Essential viewing, Downey Jr was most definitely robbed of the Oscar for this role, he did however win the BAFTA for it (British Academy Film and Television Award).",5,An excellent film.,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,1439,"['must', 'be', 'enormously', 'difficult', 'produce', 'worthy', 'biographical', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'less', 'clourful', 'Famous', 'persona', 'Critical', 'scrutiny', 'work', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'harsh', 'purist', 'particularly', 'family', 'fan', 'base', 'Chaplin', 'more', 'rounded', 'colourful', 'subject', 'most', 'notion', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'project', 'easy.Attenborough', 'sterling', 'job', 'given', 'story', 'span', 'several', 'decades', 'enormous', 'change', 'incorporate', 'massive', 'cast', 'demonstrate', 'Chaplin', 'artistic', 'importance', 'as', 'well', 'complexities', 'personal', 'life.Downey', 'Jr', 'outstanding', 'star', 'Chaplin', 'fuller', 'more', 'human', 'character', 'face', 'once', 'tragic', 'loving', 'driven', 'even', 'sexy', 'British', 'accent', 'impeccable', 'actually', 'got', 'American', 'very', 'early', 'praise', 'indeed', 'native', 'Brit', 'Englishness', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'Rees', 'Americanisation', 'actor', 'who', 'Sydney', 'Chaplin', 'actually', 'British', 'great', 'role', 'nonetheless', '.Downey', 'Jr', 'also', 'portray', 'sense', 'iron', 'hard', 'strength', 'lost', 'lonely', 'vulnerability', 'were', 'essential', 'components', 'Chaplin', 'personality', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'also', 'hard', 'get', 'sense', 'Chaplin', 'balletic', 'choreographed', 'comedy', 'Essential', 'viewing', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'role', 'did', 'however', 'win', 'BAFTA', 'British', 'Academy', 'Film', 'Television', 'Award']",Chaplin
76111,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,0784011680,Silver Screen,"[7, 8]","""Chaplin"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the Little Tramp from the silent film era does something truly remarkable.  It tells the story of Charlie Chaplin, flaws and all, and still makes you admire and respect the man.The film, covering a period of roughly 70-80 years, could easily have become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the history, the characters, the events, but it flows so smoothly that never once did I glance at the clock.Downey turns in the performance of a lifetime.  Nothing against Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award that year for ""Scent of a Woman"", but Downey was clearly shortchanged in nothing short of highway robbery in his loss of the big award.His Chaplin is thoughtful, inspiring, flawed, creative, torn, troubled and a genius, all at the same time.  The real Chaplin's obvious gift for pantomine and entertaining is evident in this film, as well as his hardscrabble upbringing and his obvious liking of very young women as his paramours. (His last marriage, to the teenage Oona O'Neill, is shown as a real and affectionate marriage from both sides, and not the leering older man going after the young girl, as was the vast opinion at the time).The film is chock full of talent, from Kevin Kline, Marisa Tomei, Moira Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Diane Lane, Anthony Hopkins, James Woods . . .a real ""who's who"" of the Hollywood community.  And yet, the film truly belongs to Downey.The sets and scenery are beautiful and I loved seeing how Hollywood must have been back in the 1910s and 1920s.If you are a Chaplin aficionado, you will embrace and enjoy this look at his remarkable life - - even if you aren't a Chaplin fan, you can learn why Chaplin was such a revered man in Hollywood, and certainly appreciate Downey's acting chops.  This film is proof of why Hollywood keeps letting this particular bad boy come back home.See this movie to pay respects to Chaplin, to appreciate the always great Anthony Hopkins (in a small role) and the many other stellar actors in this film, but most of all, see it to awe over Robert Downey, Jr.'s impressive and poignant turn as one of the Hollywood Greats.Highly recommended.",5,An Oscar Worthy Performance,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,2147,"['Chaplin', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'something', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'flaws', 'still', 'admire', 'respect', 'man.The', 'film', 'covering', 'period', 'roughly', '70-80', 'years', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'overwhelmed', 'sheer', 'volume', 'history', 'characters', 'events', 'so', 'smoothly', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'glance', 'clock.Downey', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Nothing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'year', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Downey', 'was', 'clearly', 'shortchanged', 'nothing', 'short', 'highway', 'robbery', 'loss', 'big', 'award.His', 'Chaplin', 'thoughtful', 'inspiring', 'flawed', 'creative', 'torn', 'troubled', 'genius', 'same', 'time', 'real', 'Chaplin', 'obvious', 'gift', 'pantomine', 'entertaining', 'evident', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'hardscrabble', 'upbringing', 'obvious', 'liking', 'very', 'young', 'women', 'paramours', 'last', 'marriage', 'teenage', 'Oona', ""O'Neill"", 'shown', 'real', 'affectionate', 'marriage', 'sides', 'not', 'leering', 'older', 'man', 'going', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'vast', 'opinion', 'time', '.The', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'talent', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'James', 'Woods', '.a', 'real', 'who', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'yet', 'film', 'truly', 'Downey.The', 'sets', 'scenery', 'are', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'seeing', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'back', '1910s', '1920s.If', 'are', 'Chaplin', 'aficionado', 'will', 'embrace', 'enjoy', 'look', 'remarkable', 'life', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'Chaplin', 'fan', 'can', 'learn', 'why', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'such', 'revered', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'Downey', 'acting', 'chops', 'film', 'proof', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'letting', 'particular', 'bad', 'boy', 'come', 'back', 'home.See', 'movie', 'pay', 'respects', 'Chaplin', 'appreciate', 'always', 'great', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'small', 'role', 'many', 'other', 'stellar', 'actors', 'film', 'most', 'see', 'awe', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'impressive', 'poignant', 'turn', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'Greats.Highly', 'recommended']",Chaplin

The problem is, Richard Attenborough's &quot;Chaplin&quot; tries to cover way too much, and in the process fails to give us much insight on Chaplin or his times. On DVD, the scene selection option is terribly wonderful because the film give different aspects of Chaplin's life seperate, sketchy vignettes. His wives and mistresses are in it for two minutes apiece, &quot;The Great Dictator,&quot; &quot;City Lights,&quot; and &quot;Modern Times&quot; each have only one scene, and if you blink you might miss the coverage of &quot;The Gold Rush.&quot;The film is entertaining in that it is briskly paced, and the performances are good. Robert Downey Jr. should have won an Oscar, and supporting performers, especially Geraldine Chaplin, Kevin Kline, James Woods, and Dan Aykroyd, are great. But one reason their performances are so good is because they are given no challenge. Chaplin is the only character in this movie who has more than two dimensions.The DVD fares better. Colours are good throughout, and there aren't any visual flaws worth noting. The menu interface is pretty neat.
