121588,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,0790751658,Adam B. Krenn,"[2, 2]","First off, I must disagree with many other reviewers.  I think the acting in this film is mostly servicable and even quite good at moments and all of the actors in this film gave the director exactly what he wanted.  I just think that what the Director (Eric Red) wanted wasn't very good (whether due to time/financial constraints or inexperienced directing I can't say).  All of that said and despite Eric Red's rushed pace, Michael Pare had a couple of shining moments, the highlight taking place at the very beginning of one of the worst transformation scenes ever.  This movie is very uneven, it goes from mindless logic (or at least too brief exposition as to why things are happening) to interesting and clever moments (mostly centered around the dog Thor/aka Primo).  A fantastic lead into the final transformation turns into a werewolf fanboy's nightmare of comical made-for-TV CGI/Matte work. The fantastic werewolf suit in which Eric Red was proud to show off throughout the entire film, left me with a love/hate affection toward this piece as other moments seemed to lack any logic that even the best expostiton could explain.  All in all though, if you are a fan of the werewolf genre, this one understands what John Landis said about a good werewolf film, (paraphrasing) Lycanthropy is like cancer except instead of killing you, it kills everybody else.",4,Lycanthropy: The disease that keeps on giving!,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1366,"['First', 'must', 'disagree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'think', 'acting', 'film', 'mostly', 'servicable', 'even', 'quite', 'good', 'moments', 'actors', 'film', 'gave', 'director', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'just', 'think', 'what', 'Director', 'Eric', 'Red', 'wanted', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'due', 'time/financial', 'constraints', 'inexperienced', 'directing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'said', 'Eric', 'Red', 'rushed', 'pace', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'had', 'couple', 'shining', 'moments', 'highlight', 'taking', 'place', 'very', 'beginning', 'one', 'worst', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'ever', 'movie', 'very', 'uneven', 'mindless', 'logic', 'least', 'too', 'brief', 'exposition', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'interesting', 'clever', 'moments', 'mostly', 'centered', 'dog', 'Thor/aka', 'Primo', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'final', 'transformation', 'werewolf', 'fanboy', 'nightmare', 'comical', 'made-for-TV', 'CGI/Matte', 'work', 'fantastic', 'werewolf', 'suit', 'Eric', 'Red', 'was', 'proud', 'show', 'off', 'entire', 'film', 'left', 'love/hate', 'affection', 'piece', 'other', 'moments', 'seemed', 'lack', 'logic', 'even', 'best', 'expostiton', 'could', 'explain', 'are', 'fan', 'werewolf', 'genre', 'one', 'what', 'John', 'Landis', 'said', 'good', 'werewolf', 'film', 'paraphrasing', 'Lycanthropy', 'cancer', 'instead', 'killing', 'everybody', 'else']",N/A

Despite the apparent editing, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a modern monster movie with a soul, like WOLF with Jack Nicholson (another GREAT film!). The acting is pretty good, better than one might expect, and the plot is good. After a werewolf attack is South America, a man named Ted moves in with his sister and her son(the kid from that Dennis the Menace movie a few years back), where he begins a killing spree as a monstrous wolfman. The only one who knows Ted's secret(until the end) is the family German Shepherd named Thor. The ending is great too! The werewolf scenes are pretty gorey, but don't let that detract you from seeing this. Mariel Hemingway(SUPERMAN 4:THE QUEST FOR PEACE)does a great job with her character of the werewolf's sister. Overall, a fine werewolf movie. The only thing I don't like is the lame title. It doesn't really stick. Oh well, who cares?

BAD MOON is an adaptation of the Wayne Smith novel Thor, named for the family's heroic German Shepherd that protects them from the beast. While it is constantly dragged down by the complete lack of logic and shoddy performances, there are two distinct features that make this a hit amongst fans: Christopher Allen Nelson's gory effects and one of the most convincing costume designs ever conceived.

Of course The Howling collection is in there as well as others like the classic Wolf man and such. But when I came across this lost classic I had to watch it again, this is honestly one of the best werewolf movies of all time. Based on the book by Wayne Smith called ""Thor"" this film is a quick straight forward action packed werewolf flick. I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it; I recommend it to any movie fan out there.The story is about a man that is attacked along side his girl by a werewolf and well he makes it out alive with a nice little bite taken out of him. So when he returns home to visit his sister he must try not only to fight the turning into a wolf but also the family dog named Thor. Of course this movie wouldn't be here if he failed at both ends of that statement. Actor Michael Par&eacute; is perfect in the role of the uncle turned wolf in this film, he really makes it believable.  Same can be said for Mariel Hemingway who played the sister to the werewolf [I can see the net Howling title-Your Brother is a Werewolf], she is great in her role as well. Mason Gamble is good as the son in this film, but at times I swear he looks like a girl.

But the real star here is Primo who is the dog who played Thor, the trainers and this dog should get a lot of credit for making this what it is. The dog is really what makes this film, and make this film stand out from other werewolf films.A lot of credit should go to the make up and special effects department as well because as far as the time this film came out and on a low budget this film looks great.

And that's a shame, because this is really quite a good werewolf movie.  It is far superior to most of the other films of its type.  Why?  Most werewolf movies feel the need to be gory for the sake of horror, and they do so with aplomb.  I guess if you really like excessively gory films then such releases as &quot;The Howling&quot; and &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (both of which I think are good films too) are right up your alley.Bad Moon isn't a gory film.  It doesn't operate on a thin script and isn't mired down by bad acting or filming.  This is actually a really nicely made film with B list actors.Decent acting can only get you so far though.  If the script isn't any good, it doesn't matter.  In this case, the script is one of the best I've come across for a horror film.  The script takes the horror to an emotional level rather than a graphic level.  The werewolf is someone we care about and the victims are people we care about.  But this film is less about the werewolf than it is the discovery on the part of some of the characters of WHO the werewolf is.  It could be argued that everyone except the dog is too stupid to realize that there even is a werewolf.....so I ask you, would you assume that a werewolf was at work in any given situation?  Of course not.  And this film is developed from a sense of reality rather than in some alternate reality where the existence of werewolves is a foregone conclusion.Oddly enough, this is a horror movie that the kids (albeit older ones) could watch with their parents.  (I can't swear to it, but I think this film may have been a made-for-TV or made-for-cable film).Try this film on for size.

121612,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,0790751658,- Kasia S.,"[7, 7]","I adore werewolf books and movies gobbling up anything with the monstrum theme in it and I must say that this movie was excellent! I had the pleasure of watching it today for the second time and hours later it's still running though my mind so I had to put my two cents in and write about it. I would also like to mention that my favorite werewolf movie is Dog Soldiers, a movie that works because a main stream production company was not involved in the making of it, sparing it as a flick for kids and those who really only want eye candy.Bad Moon is a sweet movie because it's quite short and the werewolf looks wicked! There is also a transformation scene, quite unusual but it really shows the whole deal, so that was nice to see for once. Short and to the point, the movie starts with an expedition gone wrong in Nepal. A whole scientific team gets shredded to pieces by a very vicious wolf like creature that gives Ted a big scratch before he defends himself with a gun, changing him forever.  Back at the Pacific Northwest Ted reluctantly visits his sister Janet played by Mariel Hemingway and her ten year old son Brett. From the beginning the viewer can sense that she is on her own with the child, no man is taking care of them and their only furry companion and protects is Thor, an adorable yet stern German shepherd. The viewer gets an unsettling feeling that Ted is her brother but the experience in Nepal has left him with a changed heart. His keen senses and cold staring eyes betray hints of an animal kept deep inside as everyone is glad to see him except for the family dog. Now the dog is always present in this movie making it quite obvious that he is playing a big part. I was even joking to my boyfriend when we watched it that Thor was the main hero of the movie and we both ended up rooting for him not only because we love animals but because the werewolf and the dog were enemies form the start and the movie depicted the play on that perfectly.As Thor follows Ted's every step he encounters a scary experience in the woods one night, witnessing his master's brother in his full fangs and claws get up and runs back home to warn the family. I wouldn't dare spoil the movie and what happens next but thrills and chills are on all the time. Plenty of hikers and people who wandered around for various reasons found themselves as a monster snack and it made Janet and Brett weary but they felt safe since her bother was there, well little did they know.... The werewolf made plenty of appearances and I must say, it was one of the best looking wolves I have ever seen. It made me think that if I lived in a house like Janet, two or three dogs would have to be a must, especially with a beast like this crawling around. I would probably rent a tank to kill it because I wouldn't want my dogs hurt but Thor was a great addition to the film and we were always worried about him as he couldn't resist following Ted and his secrets.For the fans of the genre this is a sweet treat, and I know that a five star rating for this kind of a movie is hard to explain but I really get a good kick out of it when I see it and it's nearly flawless. This is not a multi million budgeted movie with latest CGI effects and that's why I like it. There is more madness than talking and hiding so I give it two thumbs up.- Kasia S.",5,You better hide because the big bad wolf is on the prowl,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,3335,"['adore', 'werewolf', 'books', 'movies', 'gobbling', 'up', 'anything', 'monstrum', 'theme', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'today', 'second', 'time', 'hours', 'later', 'still', 'running', 'mind', 'had', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'write', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'mention', 'favorite', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'movie', 'main', 'stream', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'making', 'sparing', 'flick', 'kids', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'want', 'eye', 'candy.Bad', 'Moon', 'sweet', 'movie', 'quite', 'short', 'werewolf', 'wicked', 'also', 'transformation', 'scene', 'quite', 'unusual', 'really', 'whole', 'deal', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'once', 'Short', 'point', 'movie', 'expedition', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Nepal', 'A', 'whole', 'scientific', 'team', 'shredded', 'pieces', 'very', 'vicious', 'wolf', 'creature', 'Ted', 'big', 'scratch', 'gun', 'changing', 'forever', 'Back', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ted', 'reluctantly', 'sister', 'Janet', 'played', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Brett', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'can', 'sense', 'own', 'child', 'man', 'taking', 'care', 'only', 'furry', 'companion', 'protects', 'Thor', 'adorable', 'yet', 'stern', 'German', 'shepherd', 'viewer', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'Ted', 'brother', 'experience', 'Nepal', 'left', 'changed', 'heart', 'keen', 'senses', 'cold', 'staring', 'eyes', 'betray', 'hints', 'animal', 'kept', 'deep', 'inside', 'everyone', 'glad', 'see', 'family', 'dog', 'Now', 'dog', 'always', 'present', 'movie', 'making', 'quite', 'obvious', 'playing', 'big', 'part', 'was', 'even', 'joking', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'watched', 'Thor', 'was', 'main', 'hero', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'rooting', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'animals', 'werewolf', 'dog', 'were', 'enemies', 'form', 'start', 'movie', 'depicted', 'play', 'perfectly.As', 'Thor', 'Ted', 'step', 'scary', 'experience', 'woods', 'one', 'night', 'witnessing', 'master', 'brother', 'full', 'fangs', 'claws', 'get', 'up', 'back', 'home', 'warn', 'family', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'spoil', 'movie', 'what', 'next', 'thrills', 'chills', 'are', 'time', 'Plenty', 'hikers', 'people', 'who', 'wandered', 'various', 'reasons', 'found', 'monster', 'snack', 'made', 'Janet', 'Brett', 'weary', 'felt', 'safe', 'bother', 'was', 'there', 'well', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'werewolf', 'made', 'plenty', 'appearances', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'wolves', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'made', 'think', 'lived', 'house', 'Janet', 'two', 'three', 'dogs', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'must', 'especially', 'beast', 'crawling', 'around', 'would', 'probably', 'rent', 'tank', 'kill', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'dogs', 'hurt', 'Thor', 'was', 'great', 'addition', 'film', 'were', 'always', 'worried', 'about', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'following', 'Ted', 'secrets.For', 'fans', 'genre', 'sweet', 'treat', 'know', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'kind', 'movie', 'hard', 'explain', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'kick', 'when', 'see', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'not', 'multi', 'million', 'budgeted', 'movie', 'latest', 'CGI', 'effects', 'why', 'more', 'madness', 'talking', 'hiding', 'so', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

However, the film slags because of its (sounded like a good idea at the time) melding of the family genre with the blood-and-thunder horror film genre, which is not always as successful as it could have been. It's enjoyable, just not as unified or as coherent as it should have been--and there's the obvious, upsetting 'let's take the dog away from the kid' scene which makes you want to smack the human characters for their ignorance. I don't believe in werewolves either, but Hemingway is a more than a little slow on the uptake! Overall, though, it's a fun movie to watch. I'd rather watch this than &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; any day.The DVD is good, including the trailer but no other extras (for a film so short, it's odd that no audio commentary was included), and the sound is killer. If you like werewolves, get it, but don't expect too much from it. This is the R-rated version of a family TV show plot--now I want to read the novel &#34;Thor&#34; to see what the story is like (ha!), but there is a lot to see in this movie.

I admit it's not the best werewolf movie in the world, but it's certainly not the worst (Just take a look at some of those HOWLING sequels). Director Eric Red has had a great genre career, what with screenwriting such 80s gems as THE HITCHER and NEAR DARK and directing the underrated BODY PARTS, he knows how to craft a decent horror movie. This movie however, suffers from what seems to be a low budget and quite surprisingly from Eric Red, an underwritten script. Lead actors Mariel Hemingway and Michael Pare equip themselves fine with the stilted dialogue and try to bring the movie out of the B movie realm. Jan Kiessers' cinematography is atmospheric and Steve Johnson's animatronic werewolf suit is great (it's just a pity the rushed CGI doesn't come up to scratch - the painful scene where Pare transforms into the creature using CGI is terrible and quite frankly, needed to be cut from the film, especially when the non-digital work in the movie is largely excellent).Warner Bros. dumped this movie straight to tape in the UK, and we never got the chance to see the movie at the theatres. Now, with DVD I can view the movie as it was meant to be seen. It benefits greatly from the digital format, what with a bright sharp picture (highlighting that cool, autumnal look of the cinematography) and the chance to see Steve Johnson's great creature effects. Reviewers moaned about this movie when it came out, and to a point I can see why, but when other dull &quot;horror&quot; movies like AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS and the latest SCREAM rip-off are released at the cinema, this low-budget flick doesn't seem so bad after all. Granted, it's not a great film by any means, but it's not a bad one either . . .

The difference is that the film doesn't become laden with the monster as victim angle (as emphasized by TWM) and the film's hero is an unlikely and ironic one.

Werewolf movies are generally a dime a dozen, regardless of the era.  Besides classics like An American Werewolf in London and the original Howling, there isn't a whole lot else that stands out in the genre.  Bad Moon sadly isn't any different.  80's star Michael Pare stars as a photojournalist that gets bitten by a werewolf in Nepal, and soon enough begins going on a bloodthirsty rampage.  After failing to find ways to cure himself, he decides that if he may rid himself of his curse if he spends time with his sister (Mariel Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble).  Naturally, that doesn't work out so well, as his dark secret is uncovered by the family's ultra-intelligent German-shepard Thor, and it isn't long before dog and werewolf have a bloody face-off.  The story is predictable, and the only actor that comes across as remotely believable is Pare who is surprisingly good here.  The gore effects are nice, as is the werewolf design, but Pare's transformation moment is utterly laughable as the CGI shows it's budget constraints.  The film flies by in a breeze though, and die hard fans of the werewolf sub-genre may find some enjoyment here, but for other horror fans, there isn't much to see here.",2,Disappointing,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1476,"['hearing', 'how', 'Bad', 'Moon', 'was', 'one', 'overlooked', 'gems', '90', 'realizing', 'Eric', 'Red', 'one', 'minds', '80', 'cult', 'classics', 'Hitcher', 'Near', 'Dark', 'had', 'directed', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Werewolf', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'dime', 'dozen', 'regardless', 'era', 'classics', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'original', 'Howling', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'else', 'out', 'genre', 'Bad', 'Moon', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'different', '80', 'star', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'photojournalist', 'bitten', 'werewolf', 'Nepal', 'soon', 'enough', 'begins', 'going', 'bloodthirsty', 'rampage', 'failing', 'find', 'ways', 'cure', 'may', 'rid', 'curse', 'time', 'sister', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'young', 'son', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'Naturally', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'dark', 'secret', 'uncovered', 'family', 'ultra-intelligent', 'German-shepard', 'Thor', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'dog', 'werewolf', 'have', 'bloody', 'face-off', 'story', 'predictable', 'only', 'actor', 'remotely', 'believable', 'Pare', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'here', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'nice', 'werewolf', 'design', 'Pare', 'transformation', 'moment', 'utterly', 'laughable', 'CGI', 'budget', 'constraints', 'film', 'flies', 'breeze', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'werewolf', 'sub-genre', 'may', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'other', 'horror', 'fans', ""n't"", 'much', 'see', 'here']",N/A

I remember that is why I wanted to see it when I was 16 so many moons ago.  The acting is pretty flat, but Thor is awesome.  The changing into a werewolf scene is just a joke, however the actual werewolf is pretty cool.  The movie opens pretty well with some brief nudity in a sex scene that turns into a bloodbath.  From there it is pretty much a family movie with a little gore.  A single mom living in Seattle with her young son and the family dog Thor the almost human German Sheperd.  A uncle comes into town with a secret, moves in with the family and does not get along to well with Thor.  Why you ask?  Well I don't want to spoil the movie for you so you will just have to watch to find out (wink wink).  It really is not a family movie like on Disney channel or ABC Family channel, but it does have its feel good family/family-dog elements, Old Yeller, My Dog Skip, Air Bud, Bingo and etc, with a vicious Werewolf, and some blood and guts.  Hard to imagine.  Well that is what makes Bad Moon, Bad Moon.  It is not a werewolf movie you remember like The Howling, or An American Werewolf in London.  It is a typical B horror movie with a amazing smart dog as the hero and the only character you will care about.  It is not a complete waste of time, but don't expect to come away with anything more than a film that passes the time.  I did buy this movie though because my son loves werewolfs and this movie is not to hardcore to really mess him up in the head.

At first, you feel pity for his character...I mean, the guy witnessed his lover attacked and eaten by a monster and is now himself living the life of the beast...but, you soon feel nothing but disgust and hatred towards the man when he decides to have a mental battle with Thor. The movie was scary and tense in parts and the gore factor was high , but I had such a hard time with some scenes in the film. I was VERY disturbed by the scene where Michael Pare's character entices Thor to bite him, therefore getting Thor hauled off by Animal control people in a truly heartwrenching scene that still to this day makes me sick. The movie is good in some aspects, The directing is good and you truly fear for the people in the situations they are in. The Creature effects are excellent and I much rather prefer costume/physical makeup werewolves over the newer, Van Helsing type Werewolf that CGI designs have come up with. There is NOTHING worse than a computer animated werewolf, just watch the movie CURSED to see what I mean. This movie, to me, is all about watching a poor territorial dog who wants to protect his owners, get pushed around. The CGI in this movie was awful just because it was 1996 and CGI was pretty much new to movies at that time, so the transformation scene in the end was a crapfest. The hero of the movie, Thor, is what I am giving this movie 2 stars for, because the dog really does pull through for the viewer and make them care. You kind of watch the movie only for the dog. You want the dog to live and get through it-and almost could care less about the family by the end of the film. Overall, the movie was scary and the werewolf was pretty good compared to some of the crap that has been out there in the past, but the dog getting knocked around and tortured throughout the movie was enough to ruin my life forever. At least the ending was somewhat happy....I was somewhat confused by the dream she had-but it seems to end with everything alright. Oh well, the movie was decent but could have been longer and could have had less traumatic incidents involving the dog.",2,This movie ruined my life,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2632,"['Bad', 'Moon', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'where', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'attacked', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'quickly', 'perspective', 'Thor', 'wonderfully', 'loyal', 'german', 'shepherd', 'owned', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Whom', 'tend', 'think', 'kind', 'scary', 'looking', 'weird', 'cheekbones', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'son', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'who', 'Mariel', 'brother', 'soon', 'picture', 'struggling', 'come', 'grips', 'attack', 'living', 'life', 'werewolf', 'first', 'feel', 'pity', 'character', 'mean', 'guy', 'witnessed', 'lover', 'attacked', 'eaten', 'monster', 'now', 'living', 'life', 'beast', 'soon', 'feel', 'nothing', 'disgust', 'hatred', 'towards', 'man', 'when', 'have', 'mental', 'battle', 'Thor', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'tense', 'parts', 'gore', 'factor', 'was', 'high', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'VERY', 'disturbed', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'character', 'Thor', 'bite', 'therefore', 'getting', 'Thor', 'hauled', 'off', 'Animal', 'control', 'people', 'truly', 'heartwrenching', 'scene', 'still', 'day', 'sick', 'movie', 'good', 'aspects', 'directing', 'good', 'truly', 'fear', 'people', 'situations', 'are', 'Creature', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'much', 'rather', 'prefer', 'costume/physical', 'makeup', 'werewolves', 'newer', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'type', 'Werewolf', 'CGI', 'designs', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'NOTHING', 'worse', 'computer', 'animated', 'werewolf', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'CURSED', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'movie', 'watching', 'poor', 'territorial', 'dog', 'who', 'protect', 'owners', 'get', 'pushed', 'CGI', 'movie', 'was', 'awful', 'just', 'was', '1996', 'CGI', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'new', 'movies', 'time', 'transformation', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'crapfest', 'hero', 'movie', 'Thor', 'what', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'dog', 'really', 'pull', 'viewer', 'make', 'care', 'kind', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'dog', 'want', 'dog', 'live', 'get', 'it-and', 'almost', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'family', 'end', 'film', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'werewolf', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'compared', 'crap', 'been', 'out', 'there', 'past', 'dog', 'getting', 'knocked', 'tortured', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'ruin', 'life', 'forever', 'least', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'happy', '.I', 'was', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'dream', 'had-but', 'end', 'everything', 'alright', 'Oh', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'less', 'traumatic', 'incidents', 'involving', 'dog']",N/A

A very quick film (under 80 minutes!) that doesn't bloat itself with too much back story and keeps the action pretty much centered on Ted (the werewolf) and Thor (the protective German Shepherd)focusing on their standoff (which is well shot, save for the obviously ""stuffed"" Thor for some over the shoulder thrashing).  Really well acted (Michael Pare as Ted really stands out)and the idea of having a werewolf film that is about 70% based on a dog's point of view is quite original.  Some terrific creature design and gore help with the intensity.  The actual transformation scene seems a little dated but this movie wasn't exactly big budget fare and besides any horror fan should know that most of the really good flicks come from genuine heart in the production, not deep pockets.

If you weren't glued to the screen cheering on the dog thor during the last 20 minutes of ""bad moon"" there's something wrong with you. Anyone who has owned a german shepard in their life, even if you don't like horror, this movie is for you. In the beautiful pacific northwest mountains a woman lives alone with her son and lucky they've got thor, a white german shepard with so much heart and love for his family that even a supernatural beast couldn't stop him. Something is tearing up the countryside leaving bodies hanging up in trees. Nobody knows who or what is going on but as mom's visiting brother starts acting strange, thor knows and gets delivered to the pound when attacking the werewolf in disguise. When the beast goes for his final rampage and the son breaks out Thor we get the showdown that ends all showdowns.

Mariel Hemingway stars as a single-mom who realizes that something is happening to her distant brother (Michael Pare).  Although he as always been a little different, Hemingway decides that the best thing she can do is support him--so she allows him to stay in his trailer park on her property--bad idea.  Her brother is a flesh-eating werewolf.Michael Pare is adequate as the mysterious man-turned-werewolf, showing that haunting despair of knowing that he is inflicting horror on those he loves.  The special effects are adequate and the acting is solid; director Eric Red does a nice job of slimming the film down and taking out the useless material to reveal a good horror film with the bare essentials.

121634,A2ONX15N6TWDR,0790751658,Vincenzo L.,"[1, 1]","Eric Red has written some great screenplays: The Hitcher, Near Dark, Blue Steel (the 2 latter co-written with Kathryn Bigelow). Bad Moon is no exception to the list. Based on the book ""Thor"", Bad Moon is well written and it's strength lies in the conflict between Ted and Thor the dog.First off kudos to the dog trainers, they did a great job. Thor is the most developed character in the whole film and I relished every ""stare downs"", ""fight scenes"" and intimidation tactics he had versus Ted. I have never seen a dog in a movie with so much personality and so much emphasis accorded to him, very original, very entertaining. The rest of the film is fairly standard Werewolf fare. Yes they discard a few Werewolf rules, in this flick the wolf changes every night not just on a full moon and regular bullets are as effective as silver ones. Those little ""variations"" don't affect the movie either way. What hurts the film is the chemistry between Pare and Hemingway. It's non existent. Having Pare call Hemingway ""sis"" all the time made me feel as if they were trying to force feed the fact that they're siblings. I know she's supposed to be his sister...enough with that ""sis"", ""little brother"" shite. Pare could call her ""sis"" 200 times and the chemistry still won't be there.Another problem the film suffers from is the werewolf himself; he looks good BUT he looks fake. Especially in the scenes with the dog. Having a real animal stand next to a fake one doesn't help the illusion. Putting the werewolf in the shadows a bit wouldn't have hurt...the wolf puppet reminded me that I was watching a movie...not good when you're trying to rake in some scares. But the biggest disappointment is the ""transformation"" finale, they used computer morphing and it looks like...well...computer morphing. No ""American Werewolf In London"" transformation sequence here - not even a Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" transformation. The morphing looks sloppy and feels awkward. But I will give merit when merit is due. The pace of the film is fast, what's going on between Ted and Thor is fascinating too watch, there's some nice gore and the last 15 minutes will take your breath away. I can count on one hand, how many decent werewolf flicks are out there...yes it has it's faults but I still have a finger on that hand reserved for Bad Moon. Howl at this...As for the actors: Michael Pare (Ted) really downplays it -- a lot. Sometimes it works, sometimes he looks like he wants to go home, call his agent and fire him. On a whole I bought it, specially the scenes with the dog but when he shares scenes with ""Hemingway"" he shifts into ""mediocre acting"", spitting lines and not seeming to care. Mariel Hemingway (Janet) is good when she's not sharing scenes with Pare. Her performance with Pare seems forced (filled with phony giggles)...did these too hate each other off set?? Was Pare nailing Hemingway on the side??? Something is very off. ""Sans"" Pare she does fine. Mason Gamble (Brett) is a little kid and he's not much different than other child actors...you guessed it...he's annoying. Primo (Thor) should get the best Canine actor award. His eyes are so expressive and we always see the character...impressive...woof woof.Red does ok directing this film, but he stands out when he directs ""suspense/action"" sequences. We get lots of dog POV shots (don't dogs see in black and white?), lots of close ups (specially dog eyes and Pare eyes) and one slow motion. The last 15 minutes is an edge of your seat ride. The movie looks good but I for one would have liked a bit more style.The film boasts an excellent score, very eerie... the music is excellent and sets the tone very, very well.In a world full of lousy ""Howling"" sequels, and CGI werewolves like ""American Werewolf in Paris"" and the ""Underworld"" series, it's refreshing to see a werewolf movie that's actually good. Yes we've seen all this before but this film has a ""gimmick"" that really works: the werewolf's foe is a dog. The tension between the dog and Pare makes it all worth it and the final fight scene is a kick-ass canine boxing match.
