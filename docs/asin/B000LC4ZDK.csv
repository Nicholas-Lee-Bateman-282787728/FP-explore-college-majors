Like the Moto movies, Fox has done a great restoration and remastering job on these.  But the real appeal is the movies -- full of humor, snappy dialogue, and solid performances, this is truly a superior B-movie mystery series.Lloyd Nolan plays Shayne as a smart-aleck, with an insanely acute sense of comic timing, especially with his throwaway one-liners.  But Shayne also portrays an intelligence that you get the sense that he's just playing the fool so that you don't notice how far ahead of the game he is.

This box set features four classic films from the original franchise.MICHAEL SHAYNE, PRIVATE DETECTIVE (1940): Cash-strapped Mike is called on to help keep an eye on a gambling-addicted debutante (Marjorie Weaver); an assignment which soon dissolves into murder and mayhem.  Co-starring Elizabeth Patterson and Walter Abel.BLUE, WHITE AND PERFECT (1941): While promising to finally settle down with his impatient fiancee (Mary Beth Hughes), Mike instead cashes in her check for the downpayment on their house, and boards a cruiser headed for Hawaii, where he's soon mixed up with a former girlfriend (Helene Reynolds) and a jewel smuggling operation.  Co-starring George Reeves.SLEEPERS WEST (1941): Boarding a train with a mystery blonde (Mary Beth Hughes) who's due to be the surprise star witness in an explosive murder trial, Mike hooks up with a wisecracking reporter (Lynn Bari), and uncovers a whole mess of trouble!THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T DIE (1942): Familiar faces Marjorie Weaver and Helene Reynolds return as different characters in arguably the most entertaining Mike Shayne film in the set.  Mike is called upon to pose as the husband of serial-bride Weaver, whose homecoming is marked by murder, blackmail and a death-defying gunsmith.This top-value DVD boxset will be relished by classic movie enthusiasts.  These entertaining murder mysteries (with their liberal doses of one-liners and light humour), are a great alternative to the more traditionally-themed Noir titles produced around the same period.

1038712,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000LC4ZDK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[22, 22]","""With your nerve, I'd hate to have a tooth pulled!"" That's Phyllis Brighton speaking indignantly to Mike Shayne (Lloyd Nolan) in the movie Michael Shayne, Private Detective. Mike has just intervened to keep her from betting a bundle she can't afford on a possibly rigged horse race. It doesn't help minutes later when the nag wins.Lloyd Nolan was one of those first-rate actors who had plenty of charm, energy and charisma, with confidence to spare. He always came across as smarter than he might seem, whether he played good guys or, more often, tough good guys. He had a long career and was 83 in his last movie, Hannah and Her Sisters. He is one of the best things about that fine movie. Michael Shayne, Private Detective was the first of seven Shayne movies Nolan starred in. He crammed them all in a three year contract period. They're all comedy-mysteries, all B movies, made quickly on tight budgets by journeymen, then shot out for quick play on the lower half of double bills across America. Four of these movies are in Michael Shayne Mysteries - Volume I.  Nolan gives us a character who is tough, resourceful and cocky. He's usually good natured and usually impertinent. He runs rings around the cops, who are usually portrayed as dunderheads. He's attractive to the the ladies but always manages to escape a wedding ring.----In Michael Shayne, Private Detective, the script has Shayne deal with fixed horse races, gambling debts, sleazy opportunists and a strong-willed young woman. Besides Nolan, it's always good to see Douglas Dumbrille (as a confident crook), Walter Abel (as a weak crook) and Elisabeth Patterson (as a crime-loving aunt).----The Man Who Wouldn't Die has the old dark house cliche down pat. Mike Shayne is called upon to pretend to be the new husband of the daughter of a wealthy businessman. The man has a lush, young wife, an obsequious male secretary, an older and discrete butler and a live-in, tall and handsome doctor/scientist. Most of all, the man has a huge, isolated mansion with lots of corridors and rooms. And at night, the shadows are dark, the grounds are scary, a murderer creeps about and a buried corpse has trouble staying buried. It's always fun to see Olin Howland do his gullible hayseed routine, this time as Police Chief Meek.----For the first 40 minutes of Sleepers West I thought we might be in the middle of tense Narrow Margin territory. Mike Shayne is hiding a secret witness on a train barreling through the night between Denver and a high profile trial in San Francisco. Her testimony can prove the innocence of a man framed for a murder...a murder that involves some very powerful people who want the case closed fast and permanently. And on that train is a killer determined to identify the witness and stop her from testifying. That's not all. Also aboard is a smart, shrewd and sexy newspaper reporter, Kay Bentley (Lynn Bari), an old romance of Mike's who is determined to find Mike's witness and get a scoop. Then there's the tall guy with a suitcase full of cash who might just be a poor shrump...or a killer, too. If that's not enough for Mike, his witness, Helen Carlson (Mary Beth Hughes), is a lush scoop of frosting who enjoys a drink, has lazy eyes and lips as plump as a grouper's. If Sleepers West, a great, odd-sounding title, settles down to standard B movie fare toward the end, the ride at least is a lot of fun. Lynn Bari adds style and sexiness and has a great voice. She was a good actress who could handle comedy, drama, weepies or romance. Over a long career she was never able to break out of the B's.----Blue, White and Perfect is the fourth and last in the Michael Shayne Mysteries - Volume I. In some ways, it's the best of the four. Once again we have an economical set, this time on an ocean liner steaming from Los Angeles to Honolulu. There's espionage, industrial diamonds, murder and a nice near-drowning in a flooding ship's compartment. The story is as complicated as the other three were, but it holds up for the length of the movie. The ruthless Mr. Big is cleverly disguised until the end. Shayne's escape from marriage this time is cleverly handled by a corpse with a knife in its back.Don't blame yourself if you get confused over some of the characters in these films. Mary Beth Hughes appears in three of them, Helene Reynolds in two and Marjorie Weaver in two. They're all in leading roles and never play the same characters twice. Lloyd Nolan must have been as confused as Mike Shayne sometimes appears to be. And let's hear it for double-breasted suits. That's what Shayne always wears, and they look good on him.All four movies in the package have excellent DVD transfers, crisp and clear. There are some extras on each disc which I didn't sample.",4,"Lloyd Nolan excels as the cocky, tough...and funny...private eye, Michael Shayne",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,4758,"['nerve', ""'d"",

Made in the days when films were a bit longer than an hour, and all the dialog was easy to hear, detectives like Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, Mr. Fong, the Thin Ma, and, I now know, Donald Shayne were appearing in film after film. These beauties were knocked out 3 or 4 a year, sometimes. Each detective, of course, had his modus operandi, just as every singing cowboy did. Some were good at small clues, had connections in the obscure corners of society, were high class, were low class. We first meet Shayne having his office furniture repossessed. In another film he tricks his fianc&eacute; into giving him $1000 he needs to buy a steamship ticket so he can pursue the stolen industrial diamonds, by pretending it is the down payment on their home to be. She thinks he's having a fling with the client, always a dame, and calls the cops on him. He solves the crimes by barging on ahead and winging it, by having a quick wit and a readiness to try anything. He does not gather everyone together and explain what &#34;really happened&#34; at the end, thus exposing the guilty party. It's fun to watch him get out of scrape after scrape by the skin of his teeth, and I enjoyed all 4 movies. The prints were restored, so were easy to watch.

If you want to wear his wedding ring, you have got to catch him between cases. Because Mike has his priorities: cases first, dames second, and marriage a distant third. If Mike has just solved a case, you have got to act fast, very fast, because he'll forget about marriage at the drop of a body.Sometimes, you'll find Mike exasperating. If you are mad at him just when you think you have hooked him, or you have discovered that he has been cavorting around with another dame, or you uncover another untruthful story he has told you, hey, just throw a few things at him, what the heck, he is the forgiving sort, he won't be mad at you, he'll just write it off as something a crazy dame like you just does.If you are a bad guy or gal and Mike is on the job, you'll wish you had chosen another career.If you are a police detective, your puffed-up dignity is going to be deflated, when Mike is on the case.These are great movies with many fun scenes.

1038728,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B000LC4ZDK,mrliteral,"[2, 2]","As far as fictional detectives go, Michael Shayne is not really well-known nowadays; in fact, most of the books featuring him are out-of-print.  The Michael Shayne movies are also almost forgotten, and Lloyd Nolan, Shayne's portrayer on screen, is not one of the most remembered names of 1940s cinema.  However, as shown in the Michael Shayne Mysteries collection, these little B-movies are enjoyable little gems.This two-disc boxed set has four movies, and though titled Volume 1, there is (as yet) no second volume with the remaining movies.  Shayne is a private eye with a quick, light wit and the hard luck to always need some money.  He is introduced in Michael Shayne, Private Detective, in which he is retained as a babysitter for a young woman with a gambling habit.  Shayne's plot to break her of the habit involves faking a murder, but this goes haywire when the faked murder turns out to be a real one.In The Man Who Wouldn't Die, Shayne is hired by a rich young woman who suspects there is a ghost in her house.  He poses as her husband and ferrets out the non-supernatural culprit.  Sleepers West, filmed a decade or so before the more well-known Narrow Margin, has a similar plot:  Shayne needs to escort a reluctant witness on a train, where there are various other goings on going on.  Finally, Blue, White and Perfect has Shayne on a cruise ship out to stop the smuggling of stolen industrial diamonds by an enemy government; this last film also has a pre-Superman George Reeves.All these movies are short (the longest is 77 minutes), and filled with a humor that moves the story right along.  I had never been all that impressed with Nolan in other movies I'd seen him, but here he is just great and he carries all the films.  In addition, each film has its own little extra featurette (or in one case, an interactive trivia guide); my favorite is a short documentary on Robert McGinnis who illustrated many of the original Shayne paperbacks and serves as a reminder that book cover illustrations are not nearly as interesting as they used to be.

Granted, another Shayne, DRESSED TO KILL, has been released separately and will probably not be included in a future set, but there is NO indication at all that more 'Shaynes' will be forthcoming.Is the difficulty in packaging only the remaining two Lloyd Nolan Shaynes in a set?

Is it that Volume 1 did not sell sufficiently to generate a second and even a third set???There are two more Lloyd Nolan films and five Hugh Beaumont vehicles.

1038735,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000LC4ZDK,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[2, 2]","It is too bad more people don't know about Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne. He was brilliant in the part, both comical and tough, but never too much of either. He played the part as an everyman who sometimes got himself into more trouble than he could handle, and in every corner of his life from work to women. Often the two mixed. This inexpensive set features four of Nolan's films as Shayne, and they're well worth the buy.The set starts off with Michael Shayne, Private Detective, an appropriate introduction to the series. Shayne is hired to babysit a reckless millionaire's daughter. On the job, he tries to play a little trick on her, but it backfires big time. Soon the girl's playboy boyfriend is dead, and Shayne is fingered as the prime suspect.The Man Who Wouldn't Die concerns a rich heiress who has recently married. Shayne is hired to impersonate her husband in order to protect her. It seems that late during the night, an intruder tried to murder her in her sleep! Furthermore, the suspect has long been dead.Sleeper's West is the best film of the series, a tightly crafted mystery that unfolds in 74 minutes. Shayne is aboard a train carrying an important witness to a murder case; it is his job to see that she is protected. However, some of the passengers would like to get at her, whether it be to scoop her or to bump her off. In fact, she isn't too keen on being cooped up herself, so Mike has a lot of job on his hands.Blue, White, and Perfect rounds out the set. Shayne is supposed to be settling down with a job as a welder so he can get married, but he quickly finds himself on a case. Some industrial diamonds have been stolen and the smugglers are hiding the loot in designer dresses bound for Hawaii. Thus, Mike follows them and runs into a few friends along the way.Additionally, there are a few featurettes with hokey gimmicks, but they are very informative. One disk has a trivia game and others contain trailers and restoration comparisons.",5,Buy It-- Shayne Needs the Money,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1973,"['too', 'bad', 'more', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'Michael', 'Shayne', 'was', 'brilliant', 'part', 'comical', 'tough', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'played', 'part', 'everyman', 'who', 'got', 'more', 'trouble', 'could', 'handle', 'corner', 'life', 'work', 'women', 'Often', 'two', 'mixed', 'inexpensive', 'set', 'features', 'four', 'Nolan', 'films', 'Shayne', ""'re"", 'well', 'buy.The', 'set', 'Michael', 'Shayne', 'Private', 'Detective', 'appropriate', 'introduction', 'series', 'Shayne', 'hired', 'babysit', 'reckless', 'millionaire', 'daughter', 'job', 'play', 'little', 'trick', 'big', 'time', 'Soon', 'girl', 'playboy', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'Shayne', 'fingered', 'prime', 'suspect.The', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'rich', 'heiress', 'who', 'recently', 'married', 'Shayne', 'hired', 'impersonate', 'husband', 'order', 'protect', 'late', 'night', 'intruder', 'tried', 'murder', 'sleep', 'Furthermore', 'suspect', 'long', 'been', 'dead.Sleeper', 'West', 'best', 'film', 'series', 'tightly', 'crafted', 'mystery', '74', 'minutes', 'Shayne', 'train', 'carrying', 'important', 'witness', 'murder', 'case', 'job', 'see', 'protected', 'However', 'passengers', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'be', 'scoop', 'bump', 'off', 'fact', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'being', 'cooped', 'up', 'so', 'Mike', 'lot', 'job', 'hands.Blue', 'White', 'Perfect', 'out', 'set', 'Shayne', 'supposed', 'be', 'settling', 'down', 'job', 'welder', 'can', 'get', 'married', 'quickly', 'case', 'industrial', 'diamonds', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'smugglers', 'are', 'hiding', 'loot', 'designer', 'dresses', 'Hawaii', 'Thus', 'Mike', 'runs', 'few', 'friends', 'way.Additionally', 'are', 'few', 'featurettes', 'hokey', 'gimmicks', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'One', 'disk', 'trivia', 'game', 'others', 'contain', 'trailers', 'restoration', 'comparisons']",Michael Shayne Mysteries: Volume One
