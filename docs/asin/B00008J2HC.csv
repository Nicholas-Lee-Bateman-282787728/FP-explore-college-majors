743077,A3JTBRDRK6Q0M3,B00008J2HC,24/F Review,"[4, 5]","Sure, everyone's heard of Diana Ross and the Supremes, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson, but what about the Funk Brothers? Never heard of them? It turns out that even if you've never heard of them, you've most likely heard this group of musicians before: it turns out they've played on more #1 hits than the Beatles, Elvis, Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys combined. Standing in the Shadows of Motown is a documentary that raises some debatable issues: someone in the film says that anybody could have sung the songs because it was the music (and the musicians) that was the key element in the song's success. Director Justman makes it seem like it was a gross miscarriage of justice the way that label head Berry Gordy didn't publicly acknowledge the Funk Brothers' contribution to the Motown sound. What fails to be kept in mind is that this oversight isn't unique. I mean, when kids listen to Christina Aguilera or Avril Lavigne today, how many actually stop to think about the backing musicians? The actual size of the Funk Brothers' contribution is never made completely clear here and none of the relevant people are interviewed (Berry Gordy, Diana Ross, etc.) so the tone remains decidedly one-sided. Even so, it's still an entertaining ride as the Funk Brothers liven up the proceedings with fascinating anecdotes and by reminiscing about Motown's heyday in the 60s which are much more vivid and memorable than director Justman's cringe-worthy use of reconstructions. Another touchy point is the fleeting, unnecessary mention of the Vietnam War and how the Motown sound apparently brought comfort to the soldiers: it seemed to have been included for sentimental value and didn't fit with the rest of the film and the reason why the soldiers listened to Motown was left unexplained. The many musical performances by the Funk Brothers and the guest singers are what make this film worth watching, even if it's a tad too long at 116 minutes. It's one thing to hear them say that the music was what made the song, not the singer, but the performances say so much more. Joan ""What If God Was One Of Us"" Osborne gives a powerful, touching rendition of ""What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted"" while Gerald Levert sounds every bit as good as Gloria Gaynor on ""Reach Out I'll Be There"". Even though Standing in the Shadows of Motown is a tribute to the Funk Brothers as musicians, it is the Funk Brothers as men that is really being honoured here: even with rumours that they were cheated out of royalties by Motown and the lack of public recognition, the Funk Brothers don't come across as bitter and vengeful at all, and this magnanimous attitude is what saves this documentary from being a humdrum VH1 special, despite director Justman's attempts to (over)lionize the Funk Brothers.",4,Tribute to the Funk Brothers,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2780,"['Sure', 'everyone', 'heard', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Supremes', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'what', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'Never', 'heard', 'out', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', ""'ve"", 'most', 'likely', 'heard', 'group', 'musicians', 'out', ""'ve"", 'played', 'more', '1', 'hits', 'Beatles', 'Elvis', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'combined', 'Standing', 'Shadows', 'Motown', 'documentary', 'debatable', 'issues', 'someone', 'film', 'anybody', 'could', 'have', 'sung', 'songs', 'was', 'music', 'musicians', 'was', 'key', 'element', 'song', 'success', 'Director', 'Justman', 'was', 'gross', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'way', 'label', 'head', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'did', ""n't"", 'publicly', 'acknowledge', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'contribution', 'Motown', 'sound', 'What', 'be', 'kept', 'mind', 'oversight', ""n't"", 'unique', 'mean', 'when', 'kids', 'listen', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'today', 'how', 'many', 'actually', 'stop', 'think', 'backing', 'musicians', 'actual', 'size', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'contribution', 'never', 'made', 'completely', 'clear', 'here', 'none', 'relevant', 'people', 'are', 'interviewed', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'etc', 'tone', 'decidedly', 'one-sided', 'Even', 'so', 'still', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'up', 'proceedings', 'fascinating', 'anecdotes', 'reminiscing', 'Motown', 'heyday', '60s', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'vivid', 'memorable', 'director', 'Justman', 'cringe-worthy', 'use', 'reconstructions', 'touchy', 'point', 'fleeting', 'unnecessary', 'mention', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'how', 'Motown', 'sound', 'apparently', 'brought', 'comfort', 'soldiers', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'sentimental', 'value', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'film', 'reason', 'why', 'soldiers', 'listened', 'Motown', 'was', 'left', 'unexplained', 'many', 'musical', 'performances', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'guest', 'singers', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'tad', 'too', 'long', '116', 'minutes', 'one', 'thing', 'hear', 'say', 'music', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'song', 'not', 'singer', 'performances', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Joan', 'What', 'God', 'Was', 'One', 'Us', 'Osborne', 'powerful', 'touching', 'rendition', 'What', 'Becomes', 'Brokenhearted', 'Gerald', 'Levert', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Gloria', 'Gaynor', 'Reach', 'Out', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Even', 'Standing', 'Shadows', 'Motown', 'tribute', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'musicians', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'men', 'really', 'being', 'honoured', 'here', 'even', 'rumours', 'were', 'cheated', 'royalties', 'Motown', 'lack', 'public', 'recognition', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'bitter', 'vengeful', 'magnanimous', 'attitude', 'what', 'documentary', 'being', 'humdrum', 'VH1', 'special', 'director', 'Justman', 'attempts', 'lionize', 'Funk', 'Brothers']",N/A

To learn about the Funk Brothers was incredibly insightful, but the real treat was the music, the real sound of the Funk Brothers.  And, of course, the performers were all great- Gerald Levert, Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Chakka Khan, and Bootsy Collins.  In a small concert setting, the Funk Brothers played with comfort backing up the artists.  Most did two songs each and the performances were great, each done with passion for the music.As it goes, the movie starts out in a music store, with a question asking customers about Motown and the Funk Brothers.  They all knew the Motown sound and artists, but nobody knew that the music was by a specific jazz/blues band called the Funk Brothers.Before I ever heard of this movie, or the Funk Brothers, I always knew that I liked the music on the Motown songs, and listening on mediocre equipment, and back then, I never gave much thought then as to who was playing.  Whether it was guitar intros/riffs, drums, bongos or sax, whatever, there was always something in the tune that stood out.  There was no doubt about it, the music was unique to Motown.  Those musical tunes had something no other songs had.  It's the tune that was unforgettable.The documentary is sprinkled with the performances and some re-creations of events.  And the 2nd DVD is more chatting and some jam sessions.  Picture quality and sound are perfect.

Instead, maddeningly, all we see are closeups of Ben Harper, Joan Osborne etc singing old Marvin Gaye songs. How ironic in a film that is ostensibly about how those Motown jazz musicians are the ones who really created the hits, not the vocalists. Sure, the camera does sometimes pan over the musicians so we can get a quick glimpse of their techniques, but I would have still preferred more of a tutorial on the musical techniques than we get here.

I have come to realize that all of the music I have grown up loving is by the Funk Brother, I feel really guilty of not even stopping for a moment to go look who made it or go and see who the artist was. It's like going to a restaurant and eating a spectacular meal and not even trying to find out who cooked it, automatically giving the credit to the restaurant itself. That's what thousands of millions of people did throughout the years. They didn't give credit to the chef (The Funk Brothers) they gave the credit to the restaurant (Motown). After years and years of The Funk Brothers just trying to make it big they just retired.One of the things in this movie that really brings it to life were the stunning reenactments. They really lighted up the screen, the black and white stage and the fifties / sixties atmosphere really makes you feel like the event is actually happening. What really makes the reenactments work were The Funk Brothers telling the stories while the reenactment was happening. Other great part was where the little boy was pulling back the string on the ant hill to make a guitar.Now between each section of the movie they play bits and pieces of a concert that The Funk Brothers are playing at. They have guest singers that accompany the Funk Brothers as well.A great deal of the film was spent talking about the Bass Guitar legend James Jamerson. They talk about him and his son, and how he was the worlds greatest bass player. This also saddens me because why didn't he get any recognition for any of the work, him and his fellow Funk Brothers did in the Snake Pit.Now your probably asking whats the Snake Pit, well its where the Funk Brothers practiced and created almost all of there songs.This movie is a classic, I strongly recommend it. It gives you the answer to the question you ask yourself time and time again when you listen to the Motown Sound.

I am one of those the movie is aimed at.  I was born in Detroit and grew up in Wayne, MI listening to CKLW, WXYZ, Keener 13, and later WABX and the others.  The music of Motown was an important part of my youth.  As the movie says, &quot;Motown was the sound track of our lives&quot;.  Maybe a bit of hyperbole, but poetically it certainly has a ring of truth to it.This movie is about the session musicians that made the &quot;sound&quot; Motown became famous for.  These musicians weren't paid much of anything, worked long hours, and lived for decades in anonymity.  It is great that they are now able to speak for themselves and we get to meet them in such a sympathetic way.This is an affectionate presentation of these men.  There is very little in the way of &quot;investigative reporting&quot; (thank heavens) to try and expose the very human flaws that any human life contains in abundance.  Nor does it play up the pain and conflicts within Motown and barely mentions Berry Gordy at all.  It really is a celebration of the session musicians and its purpose is to let us get to know them. In this it succeeds wonderfully.I don't know about you, but after viewing the movie I still wanted to know more about these musicians both for their playing and as people.  There are two DVDs and there is a bunch of really neat stuff to help us get to know these musicians a bit more.  In addition to the standard deleted scenes and trailers we get a short with these guys talking around a table (at dinner the DVD says) talking about the old days.  We also get video biographies of the musicians including the ones that have passed away.  And there is a &quot;jam session&quot; with three tunes of these guys playing together.If you even just enjoyed Motown music this DVD is worth having.  Your appreciation of what went into the creation of the music and the musicians who played it will increase tremendously.",5,Wonderful Movie - Even Better DVD with lots of great extras,1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,2028,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'great', 'DVD', 'where', 'extras', 'really', 'do', 'add', 'lot', 'value', 'viewing', 'experience', 'am', 'one', 'movie', 'aimed', 'was', 'born', 'Detroit', 'grew', 'up', 'Wayne', 'MI', 'listening', 'CKLW', 'WXYZ', 'Keener', '13', 'later', 'WABX', 'others', 'music', 'Motown', 'was', 'important', 'part', 'youth', 'movie', 'quot', 'Motown', 'was', 'sound', 'track', 'lives', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'bit', 'hyperbole', 'poetically', 'certainly', 'ring', 'truth', 'it.This', 'movie', 'session', 'musicians', 'made', 'quot', 'sound', 'quot', 'Motown', 'became', 'famous', 'musicians', 'were', ""n't"", 'paid', 'much', 'anything', 'worked', 'long', 'hours', 'lived', 'decades', 'anonymity', 'great', 'are', 'now', 'able', 'speak', 'get', 'meet', 'sympathetic', 'way.This', 'affectionate', 'presentation', 'men', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'quot', 'investigative', 'reporting', 'quot', 'thank', 'heavens', 'try', 'expose', 'very', 'human', 'flaws', 'human', 'life', 'contains', 'abundance', 'play', 'up', 'pain', 'conflicts', 'Motown', 'barely', 'mentions', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'really', 'celebration', 'session', 'musicians', 'purpose', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'wonderfully.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'viewing', 'movie', 'still', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'musicians', 'playing', 'people', 'are', 'two', 'DVDs', 'bunch', 'really', 'neat', 'stuff', 'help', 'get', 'know', 'musicians', 'bit', 'more', 'addition', 'standard', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'get', 'short', 'guys', 'talking', 'table', 'dinner', 'DVD', 'talking', 'old', 'days', 'also', 'get', 'video', 'biographies', 'musicians', 'including', 'ones', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'quot', 'session', 'quot', 'three', 'tunes', 'guys', 'playing', 'together.If', 'even', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'Motown', 'music', 'DVD', 'worth', 'having', 'appreciation', 'what', 'went', 'creation', 'music', 'musicians', 'who', 'played', 'will', 'increase', 'tremendously']",N/A

Slayton,"[0, 0]","The performances are top notch, with all the usual suspects in the background, (Tom Scott etc), full orchestra (when needed) and superb backup singing. The daunting task of reproducing these gems is handled beautifully.While many of these have left us, thank goodness Allen Slutsky got so many of these musicians out of the shadows before it was too late.Anyone expecting the crudity and rudeness endemic among popular musicians these days will be surprised,these men and woman speak with intelligence and wit, and clearly, these men have a bond from shared experiences, without any bitterness or competitive attitudes. The late Robert White is especially heartbreaking: he did not live to make the onstage reunion, but his demeanor and softspoken dignity are a joy, seems like somebody you would have a coffee with and never know that he came up with so many memorable licks that are now engraved into the neurons of those of us who heard them when fresh and new.Only took off a star because the organization of this film is a bit confusing. There is a little bit of dramatization with actors, interspersed with interviews, and then the film settles down, but the opening and occasional dramatizations followed by an interview with James Jameson's son do not seem in step with the rest of the show. The interview would have been better later in the film, when we know who he is talking about. They never explain the nickname ""Igor"" attributed to Jameson.The extras are okay, but the Video Biography section, while a pedestrian text presentation, is worthwhile because it identifies the key role in individual songs that these musicians contributed. Also, the brief excerpt of the James Jameson combo playing straight ahead jazz is as ear-opening as the featured excerpt of Joe Messina playing bebop guitar on the Soupy Sales Show.Highly recommended for anyone interested in the soundtrack of American life.",4,Superb tribute to otherwise anonymous greats,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,1907,"['performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'usual', 'suspects', 'background', 'Tom', 'Scott', 'etc', 'full', 'orchestra', 'when', 'needed', 'backup', 'singing', 'daunting', 'task', 'reproducing', 'gems', 'handled', 'beautifully.While', 'many', 'have', 'left', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Allen', 'Slutsky', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'musicians', 'shadows', 'was', 'too', 'late.Anyone', 'expecting', 'crudity', 'rudeness', 'endemic', 'popular', 'musicians', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'men', 'woman', 'speak', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'clearly', 'men', 'have', 'bond', 'shared', 'experiences', 'bitterness', 'competitive', 'attitudes', 'late', 'Robert', 'White', 'especially', 'heartbreaking', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'make', 'onstage', 'reunion', 'demeanor', 'softspoken', 'dignity', 'are', 'joy', 'somebody', 'would', 'have', 'coffee', 'never', 'know', 'came', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'licks', 'are', 'now', 'engraved', 'neurons', 'who', 'heard', 'when', 'fresh', 'new.Only', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'organization', 'film', 'bit', 'confusing', 'little', 'bit', 'dramatization', 'actors', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'then', 'film', 'down', 'opening', 'occasional', 'dramatizations', 'followed', 'interview', 'James', 'Jameson', 'son', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'step', 'rest', 'show', 'interview', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'know', 'who', 'talking', 'never', 'explain', 'nickname', 'Igor', 'attributed', 'Jameson.The', 'extras', 'are', 'okay', 'Video', 'Biography', 'section', 'pedestrian', 'text', 'presentation', 'worthwhile', 'key', 'role', 'individual', 'songs', 'musicians', 'contributed', 'Also', 'brief', 'excerpt', 'James', 'Jameson', 'combo', 'playing', 'straight', 'ahead', 'jazz', 'as', 'ear-opening', 'featured', 'excerpt', 'Joe', 'Messina', 'playing', 'bebop', 'guitar', 'Soupy', 'Sales', 'Show.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'soundtrack', 'American', 'life']",N/A

In general, Motown's music has never been taken seriously enough by critics - probably because this is some of the happiest music ever recorded and it's a lot easier to critically appraise doom-and-gloom than joy. More specifically, the Funk Brothers are one of the least-told tales of Motown history. Simply put, these men ROCK and need to be seen to be believed.Until I saw this movie, I had no idea that Motown relied on a stable house band to crank out the many backing tracks for the Supremes, Temptations, Miracles, etc. I assumed that Motown used a revolving cast of session musicians. The Funk Brothers remained anonymous during Motown's heyday because - just like virtually all sessionmen - they were never credited on albums. I was amazed to see not only how tightly knit this house band was, but also how tiny Motown studios actually was.Almost all of this movie consists of a ""reunion"" concert in which several headliners take turns recreating Motown hits with the Funk Brothers acting as the backup band. It's a treat to see these songs played with passion instead of being treated as limp oldies and it's pure joy to hear Bootsy Collins and Ben Harper sing material that isn't their own - and make it work.None of the surviving Funk Brothers seem to have a nasty bone in their bodies, so there are no confrontations of the kind you would see in Chuck Berry's ""Hail Hail Rock and Roll."" They seem to be sweet, well-mannered and humble gentlemen who just happened to be one of the finest rock bands of all time. While I am not going to minimize the importance of Motown songwriting from Smokey Robinson to Holland-Dozier-Holland or the crucial role sexy singers like Diana Ross and Smokey (again!) brought to the table, I can't underestimate the support that their backing players lent them.Anyone who loves the music of Motown will love this film.",5,Strong Motown Rockumentary,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2009,"['now', 'again', 'someone', 'rockumentary', 'right', 'way', 'Standing', 'Shadows', 'Motown', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'how', 'do', 'general', 'Motown', 'music', 'never', 'been', 'taken', 'seriously', 'enough', 'critics', 'probably', 'happiest', 'music', 'ever', 'recorded', 'lot', 'easier', 'critically', 'appraise', 'doom-and-gloom', 'joy', 'More', 'specifically', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'are', 'one', 'least-told', 'tales', 'Motown', 'history', 'Simply', 'put', 'men', 'ROCK', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.Until', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'Motown', 'relied', 'stable', 'house', 'band', 'crank', 'out', 'many', 'backing', 'tracks', 'Supremes', 'Temptations', 'Miracles', 'etc', 'assumed', 'Motown', 'used', 'revolving', 'cast', 'session', 'musicians', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'remained', 'anonymous', 'Motown', 'heyday', 'just', 'virtually', 'sessionmen', 'were', 'never', 'credited', 'albums', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'tightly', 'knit', 'house', 'band', 'was', 'also', 'how', 'tiny', 'Motown', 'studios', 'actually', 'was.Almost', 'movie', 'reunion', 'concert', 'several', 'headliners', 'take', 'turns', 'recreating', 'Motown', 'hits', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'acting', 'backup', 'band', 'treat', 'see', 'songs', 'played', 'passion', 'instead', 'being', 'treated', 'limp', 'oldies', 'pure', 'joy', 'hear', 'Bootsy', 'Collins', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'sing', 'material', ""n't"", 'own', 'make', 'work.None', 'surviving', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'seem', 'have', 'nasty', 'bone', 'bodies', 'are', 'confrontations', 'kind', 'would', 'see', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Hail', 'Hail', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'seem', 'be', 'sweet', 'well-mannered', 'humble', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'rock', 'bands', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'minimize', 'importance', 'Motown', 'songwriting', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Holland-Dozier-Holland', 'crucial', 'role', 'sexy', 'singers', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Smokey', 'again', 'brought', 'table', 'ca', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'support', 'backing', 'players', 'lent', 'them.Anyone', 'who', 'music', 'Motown', 'will', 'love', 'film']",N/A

Recognition of these outstanding men was long overdue (and that's quite an understatement).  The movie is highly personal and highly entertaining.  Watching the fascinating story of the men who invented the Motown sound is akin to actually being there with them at the time they were creating history in &quot;The Snake Pit.&quot;  In a sense, you are given a very unique opportunity to travel back in time and feel the same emotion they did.

To see these legendary and unsung (no pun intended) heroes of the music business is such a satisfying and wonderful experience.  The production is flawless and the MUSIC?  Oh, my!  What great artists who enabled so many singers to achieve the highest level of artistry because of The Funk Brothers' backing.  A couple of reviewers complained that there was not enough archival footage of Otis Redding, etc., but this documentary was about The Funk Brothers, who supplied most, if not all, of the backing for these awesome singers.  It is touching as sad to see some people being asked if they knew who the Funk Brothers were.  Not many could answer that question.  It is a shame that so many great artists behind the super-stars are no acknowledged properly.  Therefore, it was a pleasure to finally see these individuals, especially after so many years of obscurity.  The now living performers who appear with The Funk Brothers in LIVE renditions of some of the classic songs do a masterful job of re-creating that power and beauty.

At its peak, it played in only 59 theaters, a real shame. You've probably heard the buzz about how good it is.An encyclopedic collection of DVD extras gives the movie's fans another chance to hang with the Funk Brothers, Motown's mostly forgotten sidemen (until the movie was made). Only the obsessed would want more material.Sound and video capably deliver the soul power. The 6.1 DTS ES track sparkles, with the rear trio of speakers simulating concert-hall echoes. When the musicians re-create their magic in the Snakepit -- Motown's original recording studio -- the rear channel information sounds as if it were recorded out in the alley, a nifty piece of mixing. Only generously powered subwoofers need apply for the bass gig. The 5.1 Dolby EX sounds solid, but can't match the DTS experience.The movie comes widescreen only (16x9, enhanced). Douglas Milsome (""Full Metal Jacket"") was cinematographer on the concert scenes, in which contemporary artists such as Ben Harper and Meshell Ndegeocello sing Motown hits with the band.The performances were shot beautifully on film, with lots of crane work and cameras always on the move, as in ""The Last Waltz."" When Joan Osborne and the boys fire up ""Heat Wave,"" the combination of sound, vision and performance is breathtaking. The DVD-ROM high-res version of the film on disc 2 looks astonishing, with silky blacks and gold-record ambers.The producer and director's commentary provides a lot of detail missing from the film, along with significant updates on the Funks. Viewers can select pop-up trivia to play along with the commentary, enriching the playback.The extras often have a home-movie feel. The filmmakers' early video interviews with the Funks are seen in a short that was originally used to pitch the project. ""Dinner With the Funk Brothers"" lets the video tape roll as the sidemen, mellow but expansive, swap stories around a candle-lit table. Deleted scenes include a jam session with James Jamerson's son, a fine bassist.Another featurette serves as an epilogue, capturing the Funks' star time at the Hollywood premiere, hands in cement and all. ""We know this didn't have to happen,"" says Funk Brother Jack Ashford.

This documentary attempts to attribute the excellence of those wonderful records to the studio musicians known as ""The Funk Brothers"". However as accomplished as these musicians are, the great Motown records were truly the inspiration of the great record producers of the '60s who are sorely lacking in representation here. It needs be said these guys were merely session players for the Motown recording studio. Unsung heroes, no doubt, but not the guiding hands the movie alleges them to be. They would have never been left behind when Motown Records packed up their East Coast operation and moved West if they were the hitmakers the movie claims. Why for instance are the major artists of that era not here in this movie testifying and singing the praises of these musicians? Instead we're offered mostly lukewarm renditions of Motown classics by contemporary artists that seemed an excuse for a movie soundtrack recording, as the original hit records are heard here in only edited bits. Watching The Funk Brothers reminiscing and regretting came across as righteous sour grapes, however unfortunate the era was in reserving royalty checks for the record companies and not the musicians. They deserve their due and it is sad this film couldn't portray them as the strong backbone and not the curator of those wonderful records.

Here these men are the crators of the ""Motown Sound"" and prior to this documentary, they never received any credit for their arrangements of songs that have each been covered by modern artists time and time again.

743116,AL2VDE4LO4ESR,B00008J2HC,"Jack Fitzgerald ""JFD""","[1, 1]","""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" is an outstanding tribute to the unheralded studio musicians who backed many of the 1960s Motown/Soul era's biggest hits. The group was known as `The Funk Brothers' and consisted of Richard Allen, Jack Ashford, Bob Babbitt, Johnny Griffith, Joe Hunter, Uriel Jones, Joe Messina, Eddie Willis who were still alive for the filming of the documentary. Funk Brothers `here in Spirit' were Benny Benjamin, Eddie Brown, James Jamerson, Earl Van Dyke and Robert White. I had to mention the names of these guys once more, just to give them the recognition they deserve. Together they made up a baseball-team-like rotation of guitarists, bassists, drummers, keyboardists and utility musicians who backed countless tracks for star singers like Martha and the Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, The Drifters and Marvin Gaye.I enjoyed the mix of interviews and band footage, along with the historical photographs of the musicians back in the day. There was a unique bond and chemistry between these players that transcended race, Babbitt and Messina are white, and there is genuine affection for those not around today. As a bassist, I was especially interested in James Jamerson's contribution to the way the instrument was and is played, and his influence on countless players who have never heard of him.Some of the new concert footage included performances featuring vocalists such as Joan Osbourne, Ben Harper and Chaka Khan. These guys had such an easy groove, and they've still got the chops all these years later.The two-disk set is loaded with extras, including plenty of jams, biographies, and more interviews.This is a must-see for any musician or anyone interested in the history of music, especially the Motown era.",5,Outstanding tribute to unsung musicians,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,1743,"['Standing', 'Shadows', 'Motown', 'outstanding', 'tribute', 'unheralded', 'studio', 'musicians', 'who', 'backed', 'many', '1960s', 'Motown/Soul', 'era', 'biggest', 'hits', 'group', 'was', 'known', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'consisted', 'Richard', 'Allen', 'Jack', 'Ashford', 'Bob', 'Babbitt', 'Johnny', 'Griffith', 'Joe', 'Hunter', 'Uriel', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Messina', 'Eddie', 'Willis', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'filming', 'documentary', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'here', 'Spirit', 'were', 'Benny', 'Benjamin', 'Eddie', 'Brown', 'James', 'Jamerson', 'Earl', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Robert', 'White', 'had', 'mention', 'names', 'guys', 'once', 'more', 'just', 'give', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'Together', 'made', 'up', 'baseball-team-like', 'rotation', 'guitarists', 'bassists', 'drummers', 'keyboardists', 'utility', 'musicians', 'who', 'backed', 'countless', 'tracks', 'star', 'singers', 'Martha', 'Vandellas', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Drifters', 'Marvin', 'Gaye.I', 'enjoyed', 'mix', 'interviews', 'band', 'footage', 'historical', 'photographs', 'musicians', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'unique', 'bond', 'chemistry', 'players', 'transcended', 'race', 'Babbitt', 'Messina', 'are', 'white', 'genuine', 'affection', 'not', 'today', 'bassist', 'was', 'especially', 'interested', 'James', 'Jamerson', 'contribution', 'way', 'instrument', 'was', 'played', 'influence', 'countless', 'players', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'him.Some', 'new', 'concert', 'footage', 'included', 'performances', 'featuring', 'vocalists', 'such', 'Joan', 'Osbourne', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'Chaka', 'Khan', 'guys', 'had', 'such', 'easy', 'groove', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'chops', 'years', 'later.The', 'two-disk', 'set', 'loaded', 'extras', 'including', 'plenty', 'jams', 'biographies', 'more', 'interviews.This', 'must-see', 'musician', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'music', 'especially', 'Motown', 'era']",N/A
743117,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B00008J2HC,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[5, 5]","This film is a documentry about a group of professional musicians who were under so may people's rador but still happend to be blasted into millions of people's ears for years and years. The players were a band of mainly jazz musicians who turned to the pop charts in order to make a living. These musicians were known as The Funk Brothers, and were signed to the record company of Motown.Therefore they performed for all the record company's popular artists that it recorded but the spotlight almost always fell upon the pop artists and hardly ever fell upon the band who wrote and performed the music for the artists. STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN tells this story by the musicians themselves and it is captivating. The film will touch the heart of any musician and any fan of the music this band performed for such as ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", ""War"", ""Reach Out I'll Be There"", ""Too Many Fish In The Sea"", ""My Girl"", ""Cloud Nine"", ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave"", ""Do You Love Me"", ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me"", and so many more. Unforgettable moments of the film include the opening and closing of the documentry were it is stated and listed that The Funk Brogthers played more number one hits than any other band out there. A key moment is where film crews ask listner after listner if they know the music released by Motown, and if the listeners are fimilar with the band who performed for all the artists. Many of the listners had no idea who The Funk Brothers were, let alone how many hits the band played on. This moment personally touches me, because this still happens. Mainstream bands are given most of the attention to the music they perform, but how many listeners know that professional musicians are actually called into the studio to first write and perform pop artists' music? Another heart felt moment is where the original guitarist for ""My Girl"" was going to tell a listener that he was on the recording the radio happened to be playing at the time the guitarist was at a diner, but he decided against it. The viewer soon discovers just how hard it was and is for any professional musician to be behind a pop sensation and not to receive or receive little credit for his or her work with the pop star. To add to the film's musical atmosphere, there are clips of The Funk Brothers performing hit after famous hit of their soul and funk music that they created which made some other pop star big, leaving themselves in the shadows of Motown.",5,Musicians Who Any Musician Sould Know,1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2473,"['film', 'documentry', 'group', 'professional', 'musicians', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'may', 'people', 'rador', 'still', 'happend', 'be', 'blasted', 'millions', 'people', 'ears', 'years', 'years', 'players', 'were', 'band', 'mainly', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'who', 'turned', 'pop', 'charts', 'order', 'make', 'living', 'musicians', 'were', 'known', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'were', 'signed', 'record', 'company', 'Motown.Therefore', 'performed', 'record', 'company', 'popular', 'artists', 'recorded', 'spotlight', 'almost', 'always', 'fell', 'pop', 'artists', 'hardly', 'ever', 'fell', 'band', 'who', 'wrote', 'performed', 'music', 'artists', 'STANDING', 'THE', 'SHADOWS', 'OF', 'MOTOWN', 'story', 'musicians', 'captivating', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'musician', 'fan', 'music', 'band', 'performed', 'such', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Enough', 'War', 'Reach', 'Out', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Too', 'Many', 'Fish', 'Sea', 'Girl', 'Cloud', 'Nine', 'Love', 'A', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', ""'ve"", 'Really', 'Got', 'A', 'Hold', 'Me', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'Unforgettable', 'moments', 'film', 'include', 'opening', 'closing', 'documentry', 'were', 'stated', 'listed', 'Funk', 'Brogthers', 'played', 'more', 'number', 'one', 'hits', 'other', 'band', 'there', 'key', 'moment', 'where', 'film', 'crews', 'ask', 'listner', 'listner', 'know', 'music', 'released', 'Motown', 'listeners', 'are', 'fimilar', 'band', 'who', 'performed', 'artists', 'Many', 'listners', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'were', 'let', 'alone', 'how', 'many', 'band', 'played', 'moment', 'personally', 'still', 'Mainstream', 'bands', 'are', 'given', 'most', 'attention', 'music', 'perform', 'how', 'many', 'listeners', 'know', 'professional', 'musicians', 'are', 'actually', 'called', 'studio', 'first', 'write', 'perform', 'pop', 'artists', 'music', 'heart', 'felt', 'moment', 'where', 'original', 'guitarist', 'Girl', 'was', 'going', 'tell', 'listener', 'was', 'recording', 'radio', 'happened', 'be', 'playing', 'time', 'guitarist', 'was', 'diner', 'decided', 'viewer', 'soon', 'discovers', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'professional', 'musician', 'be', 'pop', 'sensation', 'not', 'receive', 'receive', 'little', 'credit', 'work', 'pop', 'star', 'add', 'film', 'musical', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'clips', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'performing', 'hit', 'famous', 'hit', 'soul', 'funk', 'music', 'created', 'made', 'other', 'pop', 'star', 'big', 'leaving', 'shadows', 'Motown']",N/A

The documentary honors the Funk Brothers, mostly African - American, but a couple white guys, who played on all those Tempts, Smokey, 4 Tops and Supremes classics.  I was in the 8th or 9th grade when My Guy and Please Mr. Postman launched it all.  The relaxed reminiscences of those years from the surviving Funk Brothers, their tributes to each other and to the fellow players -- bassman James Jamerson first and foremost -- nicely recreate a time when Detroit had reason beyond the Red Wings to feel optimistic.  Some period footage is a nice bonus, as is seeing the gorgeous Martha Reeves again.  The music and the Funk Brothers playing are as powerful as ever.  Ben Harper and Me'Shell NdegeOcello are particularly effective interpreters of the classics.  Joan Osburne does pretty well also, but Chaka Khan is a really bizarre choice to sing What's Goin' On, and does it as poorly as you would expect.

You don't have to be a Motown fan to enjoy this movie - just a music lover who enjoys the stories behind the sounds. During parts of this movie I wept silently - it is so moving! The story of James Jamerson Sr alone is worth telling, let alone the rest of the band. The tragedy of the tale is that too many band members did not live to garner the recognition they deserved.Some great anecdotes are espoused by these long-retired muzos, including these little beauties:* the 3-man guitar section was known as the Oreo section for a while - two black guitarists with a white one in the middle!* one of the drummers had to decide whether he was going to be a musician (trombonist) or a boxer - in the end he decided to be a drummer, because his lip kept getting beaten up and he couldn't play the trombone properly!At the tribute concert (in Detroit, of course), it is great to see contemporary musicians who understand the significance of the music (and are hugely talented to boot) performing with the band. The list is impressive: Joan Osborne (a wonderful rendition of 'What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted'), Chaka Khan, Ben Harper (not an electric performer but certainly soulful and sincere), and the outrageously flamboyant Bootsy Collins - and there are more besides.If I have one complaint, it is that we might have seen more of the lead artists commenting on the band - in particular Stevie Wonder, who got to work with them in his early career. It's hard to see why he would not have made a contribution to the film - there are a few photos of him and one clip from news footage in the 80s, but this does not compare to a current interview with the benefit of hindsight.However, this is a fabulous film that will leave you with an entirely different perspective on music.

743130,A3832F4CZPHZNX,B00008J2HC,MeMyselfandI,"[0, 0]","I've always been a fan of Motown but of the singers, now I'm starting to realize I shouldn't give the singers all the credit, it was the producers, songwriters, and musicians who made the artists become hits. We tend to overlook the people behind the scenes and give all the credit to the singers. If it wasn't for the unique, special Funk Brothers who knows if Motown would have become as successful as they did. It doesn't matter how good of a singer a singer is, if the music ain't right, the singer ain't gonna sound good. Its that something special about the Motown Sound that sparks something in our minds, hearts, and souls, the music complimented the singers excellently thanks to The Funk Brothers who made sure the music fit the artists image. They didn't play the same for everyone yet each song had their special trademark sound.I favor James Jamerson, as mostly everyone else do, he was just a handsome, wonderful, real, interesting, talented person. Its sad he and the other Funk Brothers had to get recognition after they passed on. It seems the only way to become a legend is to die first then people appreciate you more, well the book on Jamerson's life and this documentary taught me to love and praise people while their alive...that's what keeps them going. All James and The Funk Brothers wanted in their last days was recognition and to know they did make a difference in the world of music and they wanted people to know they created the Motown Sound. This documentary taught me to appreciate the musicians, songwriters, and producers, the people behind the scenes, who made it possible for the music to become timeless, sometimes we give the singers too much credit. The singers come to the studio do they number then get fame and fortune, its the musicians, producers, and songwriters who worked in the studio for many hours perfecting everything to make the artists successful.It was interesting for me to find out most of the Funk Brothers didn't even like Rock N Roll or Soul music and thought most of the songs at Motown wouldn't be hits, they were really jazz and blues fans and wanted to play jazz, so it shows how gifted they were to still play soul music effectively even though it wasn't their cup of tea. Another reason why Motown sound is so appealing and fresh is because the Funk Brothers laced different genres of music and tried new things creating the Motown Sound, a sound in its own class. Now I know why Berry Gordy didn't want The Funk Brothers playing for the other studios. He was afraid the Motown secret sound would get out and make other studios and artists successful. The Funk Brothers were so good they could make anyone a hit.The Funk Brothers were an entertaining, colorful group of guys who was Motown, thanks to this documentary, we now know it wasn't just the singers, there were other talents who contributed to the greatness of Motown. I loved the re-enactments of some of the hilarious things James and the other Funk Brothers did in their lives and careers. The story that put tears in my eyes in this documentary was the reenactment of when James slipped into a theater to watch Motown 25. He should have been at Motown 25, all the Funk Brothers should have been there, if it hadn't been for the Funk Brothers, there probably wouldn't have been a Motown 25. The Funk Brothers should have been the first invited but again The Funk Brothers were overlooked by Motown itself. Also, why wasn't David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Barrett Strong, Kim Weston, The Andantes, The Marvelettes, Brenda Holloway at Motown 25, there were a lot of key figures missing from Motown 25 who contributed to the greatness of Motown as well....but that's another story. It must have killed James to sit in the theater watching Motown 25, seeing all the people he help make superstars and legends, hearing the music he helped create and play on and then the people sitting around him didn't know he help make the Motown Sound, all that that must have did him in, he died shortly after Motown 25. He must have died of a broken heart too.Some people complain why the Motown artists weren't included in the documentary. I'm glad they weren't, it would have only overshadowed The Funk Brothers story, and they've been overshadowed enough. The purpose of having other singers sing the Motown songs was to show it was the musicians who made Motown and the documentary wanted to show that it didn't matter who was singing the songs, The Funk Brothers could have made those sound good and become hits regardless of who sings them. One of The Funk Brothers said if you took most of the Motown songs and gave them to other singers outside of Motown those songs would have been hits anyway if The Funk Brothers were playing on the songs, not to knock the Motown artists but its true, think about it. Its really the music, not the Motown singers, its something special about the Motown Sound that The Funk Brothers created that grabs you and makes you listen, they worked their magic and made the unique music classic and if you put The Funk Brothers behind any artists their gonna make that artists a hit. Most of the time I listen to Motown and just fascinated with the sound, the singers are great of course but the music just stands out to me more now.I liked seeing Lottie The Body in this documentary, she was something else and in her late 70's she still has IT. We learn The Funk Brothers learned a lot about music playing for her, so the Funk Brothers had some great teachers and great training from interesting places that benefited Motown.Everytime you listen to a Motown song, as much as you love the artists singing, don't forget to love The Funk Brothers playing right along singing through also through their music. It wasn't just Berry Gordy, it was the singers, producers, writers, arrangers, composers, and musicians who made Motown possible and everyone should be commended, not just some.No one could have done it alone!Now I hope the musicians who helped create The Philly Sound and the Chicago Sound have their story told!",5,The Funk Brothers were Motown!

Edelman,"[4, 4]","What started out as a project of interest only to musicians- Alan ""Dr. Funk"" Slutsky's book/project honoring James Jamerson- grew to become a project to recognize and honor all the musicians that made the  Motown magic. This movie is a moving and wonderfully entertaining look at the players behind the scenes who helped create the Motown sound.Of course, at the core was Berry Gordy and his vision of a new R&B; that cross race barriers and play the same venues as the top white acts of the day, And composers- most notable Smokey Robinson- were a big part of the sound as well. And I suppose some might argue that if it wasn't these guys, it could have easily been another dozen players who helped realize the Motown Sound (Although finding another Jamerson would have been tough).But so what? This movie isn't about crediting the Motown Sound to the men honored in it; rather, it's about looking behind the scenes and honoring a group of musicians who were an instrumental part of the Motown magic, men who until now have been known to only a few musicians and people in the business.I'm a musician, and I grew up in Detroit during the Motown era, so seeing the movie and the DVD was for me a given, of course. And for the same reasons I'd saying buying this is a requirement for anyone who grew up in Detroit back then, or anyone who was a fan of Motown.

I came close to giving this film a saggy review because I was left feeling unsatisfied by the film alone. Then I popped in Disc 2 to see the extras, and wow! That's the stuff I was waiting for.""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" (the feature film) is a broad overview of the Detroit phenomenon known as The Funk Brothers whose music has touched every human life on this planet. The documentary is well-produced and polished, but it misses some of the details that we might hunger for.What challenges or tragedies did these people face? How did the group deal with certain members' substance abuse, depression, mania, and ultimately death? What sort of camaraderie did they have? Any racial tensions? Who is still alive today?Few, if any, of these questions are answered in the feature film. In fact some of these issues were conspicuously avoided (and scenes deleted) almost as if the film producers decided to keep it cheerful & breezy instead of giving us the ofttimes turbulent truth. The overriding theme of this film is that the Motown groove makes people happy, so it does make sense that they would cut out the sadder/tragic elements. But if you want the rest of the story check out Disc 2.""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" takes the format of a collection of reminiscences, like browsing through an old photo album with old friends. Interviews are garnished with images, footage, and some re-created scenes with actors. Intermittantly we cut to the reunion concert for songs featuring well known contemporary singers. The feature film is oozing with feel-good nostalgia, mentioning only as footnotes how certain individuals were ""tortured artists"" or ""battled with addiction"". There was at least one powerful buildup to a tragic death, completely sidestepped to the point that I had to pause the movie and google how so-and-so died.Disc 2, I'm happy to report, fills in all the blanks. I would suggest first watching the featurette ""The Ones That Didn't Make It"" which tells you which of the Funk Brothers survived to see the completion of the film, who died during production, and who died before ever knowing they would be immortalized in this film. It's not just a macabre desire to know who's dead that interested me, but this featurette gave me more of an intimate connection with those who didn't survive. And it made me want to re-watch their interviews & performances so I could soak in every note. For example, in the features I learned that one of the most lovable Funk Brothers passed away during filming (I won't say who, in case for some reason you'd rather not know), but the feature film didn't mention it. Disc 2, however, gives us more of his screen time as well as the respectful and pensive reactions of his bandmates. This is the intimate, human side not fully explored in the feature.Disc 2 also has some raw yet emotional footage of the gang getting back together for the first time, hugging, joking and speaking incoherently in their secret code (literally, a secret language of pig-Latin and skatting fused together). I feel like the main feature could have used these scenes to establish the love they had for each other, transcending racial & cultural differences. Instead, the main feature focuses mostly on individual interviews, instead of everyone together in the same room.But for me, and for any musician-wannabe, the feature that knocked it out of the park was the multi-angle jam sessions. With your DVD remote you can choose what instrument you want to watch during their rehearsals. You can really scrutinize their technique, their gear and their style. THAT's what this film should have focused on... not just the story of a bunch of unsung heroes, but what made them heroes? What made this bunch of guys different from any other well-trained, skilled musician? Their performances say more than anyone could ever say, and the ability for us to pick what/whom we're looking at is a real treat for those of us who want to play musical detective.In all, this is an important film that all music lovers & musicians should see. Disc 2 is fantastic. The Disc 1 feature is good but not my favorite music documentary because it didn't really dig deep or pull together a story (which Disc 2 does much better). For a great example of a music storytelling documentary, check out ""Anvil! The Story of Anvil"" even if you're not an 80s metal fan; it's just a great story about a bunch of lovable guys who missed their shot.As for the Funk Brothers themselves, all hail. Thank you, sirs, for making the world a shade brighter.

The Funk Brothers consisted of 10+ very talented musicians, and they definitely deserve to have their stories told.  Unfortunately, despite their talent and contributions, the Funk Brothers apparently received little glory and compensation.  The story is inherently interesting, but the documentary ultimately falls a bit short of greatness.First, their contributions to Motown are not given enough context.  Most of the story is told by the remaining Funk Brothers, and very few Motown artists are interviewed.  I guess that the documentary makers wanted the focus to be on the Funk Brothers, but praise from artists such as Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, or some of the remaining Temptations would undoubtedly have added to the luster of the Funk Brothers.  Second, the degree to which the Funk Brothers wrote the music they played was not addressed (at times, the doc makes it seem as though they wrote much of it).  Third, some of the stories are told with cheesy re-enactments, which detract from their impact.Perhaps the best part of the documentary is that the Funk Brothers re-unite to play several songs throughout the movie.  When and where these live songs were recorded is not made clear, but many of them are very good.  The Funk Brothers team up with several singers, such as Ben Harper, Joan Osbourne, Montell Jordan, Gerald Levert, and (best of all) Chaka Khan.  Your enjoyment of these sections will likely correspond to how much you like these singers, but the performances are all pretty good.  Ultimately, I think that the makers of the documentary were a bit too timid and deferential in their approach.  They seem intent on avoiding angering Motown, even though many of the Funk Brothers seem to have been treated poorly by the label.  The Funk Brothers deserve 5 stars, but sadly I can give the doc only 3 stars.",3,"Funk Brothers = 5 Stars, but 3 Stars for the Documentary",1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,2062,"['Standing', 'Shadows', 'Motown', 'great', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'story', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'collection', 'talented', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'who', 'rewrote', 'musical', 'history', 'providing', 'music', 'many', 'Motown', 'greatest', 'hits', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'consisted', '10+', 'very', 'talented', 'musicians', 'definitely', 'deserve', 'have', 'stories', 'told', 'Unfortunately', 'talent', 'contributions', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'apparently', 'received', 'little', 'glory', 'compensation', 'story', 'inherently', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'short', 'greatness.First', 'contributions', 'Motown', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'context', 'Most', 'story', 'told', 'remaining', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'very', 'few', 'Motown', 'artists', 'are', 'interviewed', 'guess', 'documentary', 'makers', 'wanted', 'focus', 'be', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'praise', 'artists', 'such', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'remaining', 'Temptations', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'added', 'luster', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'Second', 'degree', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'wrote', 'music', 'played', 'was', 'not', 'addressed', 'times', 'doc', 'seem', 'wrote', 'much', 'Third', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'cheesy', 're-enactments', 'detract', 'impact.Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 're-unite', 'play', 'several', 'songs', 'movie', 'When', 'where', 'live', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'many', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'team', 'up', 'several', 'singers', 'such', 'Ben', 'Harper', 'Joan', 'Osbourne', 'Montell', 'Jordan', 'Gerald', 'Levert', 'best', 'Chaka', 'Khan', 'enjoyment', 'sections', 'will', 'likely', 'correspond', 'how', 'much', 'singers', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'makers', 'documentary', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'timid', 'deferential', 'approach', 'seem', 'intent', 'avoiding', 'angering', 'Motown', 'even', 'many', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'poorly', 'label', 'Funk', 'Brothers', 'deserve', '5', 'stars', 'sadly', 'can', 'give', 'doc', 'only', '3', 'stars']",N/A
