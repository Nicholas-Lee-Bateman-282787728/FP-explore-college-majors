He got all excited and we had to put it in right away.  He kept making my mom stand up and do what they were doing on TV.  It was cute watching them jump up and down and dance around.  This is a great DVD to get your kids active and they'll have a blast.",5,Bridget's Review,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,341,"['When', 'pulled', 'out', 'DVD', 'Damien', 'laid', 'eyes', 'was', 'had', 'struck', 'gold', 'got', 'excited', 'had', 'put', 'right', 'away', 'kept', 'making', 'mom', 'stand', 'up', 'do', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'TV', 'was', 'cute', 'watching', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'dance', 'around', 'great', 'DVD', 'get', 'kids', 'active', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast']",Lets Hear It for the Laurie Berkner Band
1361380,AONGA3BHTK0EG,B003SLEDGK,CHUS01 Fan,"[16, 17]","This DVD is not awful, but it is vastly inferior to ""We are... The Laurie Berkner Band"".  In that one, they draw from over a decade of songs that Laurie wrote.  We Are... also seems better produced and directed.  As an example, the lighting was much better in the first DVD.  In the new one, Laurie is blasted with high intensity lights, so much so that her face appears overexposed and white and her eyes a little too dramatic (guess that's the style today though).  Musically I prefer the first one too.This DVD also suffers from interludes with the Nick Jr. moose where he does silly things to hype the crowd.  This gets old fast, and kills replay value.Her early DVD I have literally watched a hundred times and still enjoy.  We even went to see the band in concert.  They are great.I still give this DVD four stars because it's above average compared to other childrens' DVDs.",4,Disappointing,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,881,"['DVD', 'not', 'awful', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'are', 'Laurie', 'Berkner', 'Band', 'one', 'draw', 'decade', 'songs', 'Laurie', 'wrote', 'Are', 'also', 'better', 'produced', 'directed', 'example', 'lighting', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'DVD', 'new', 'one', 'Laurie', 'blasted', 'high', 'intensity', 'lights', 'so', 'much', 'face', 'overexposed', 'white', 'eyes', 'little', 'too', 'dramatic', 'guess', 'style', 'today', 'Musically', 'prefer', 'first', 'one', 'too.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'interludes', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'moose', 'where', 'silly', 'things', 'hype', 'crowd', 'old', 'fast', 'kills', 'replay', 'value.Her', 'early', 'DVD', 'have', 'literally', 'watched', 'hundred', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy', 'even', 'went', 'see', 'band', 'concert', 'are', 'great.I', 'still', 'give', 'DVD', 'four', 'stars', 'above', 'average', 'compared', 'other', 'childrens', 'DVDs']",Lets Hear It for the Laurie Berkner Band

With those changes they got rid of Moose and Zee who were favorites on the channels for my oldest child well, since she was old enough to watch cartoons.
