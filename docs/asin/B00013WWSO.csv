MOTIVES was pretty darn good, and Shemar Moore's character did somewhat remind me of my character, Jaylin Rogers, in Two's Enough Three's A Crowd, as many said he would.  Shemar did a superb job keeping me entertained and I was blown away even more when I saw an old school mate of mine, Sean Blakemore, kicking it down in this movie as well.  The most amazing thing about the story was how unpredictable it was. Usually, a writer can tell where a story might be headed, but this one left me scratching my head thinking...how clever the ending was.

This film has a moderately complex plot, good acting but is rather predictable.  It's not fair to compare a film like this to the other erotic thrillers from bigger production companies where they have more money and more experienced cast members.  The company Rainforest Productions based in Atlanta is moving in the right direction with films such as the Trois series and this one.Vivica A Fox is always a pleasure to see on screen.  Both her and Shemar Moore are good actors when cast right, but they are no Hallie Berry and Denzel Washington.  At times their acting seems rather forced and over the top.  With experience they will get better I'm sure.  As far as the story is concerned, it was nice but in the introduction, most can tell that Shemar's so-called best friend is a rather shady character and so is he.  It's not hard to figure out who is trying to frame whom a little more than half way into the film.  But as I mentioned before, this is still an enjoyable film.  Even if you're able to figure everything in the film out well before the ending, it's interesting to see exactly how the events unfold.If you're looking for something really challenging and very suspenseful, then perhaps a Law & Order episode would be better for that.",4,very good erotic thriller,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,1420,"['One', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'films', 'black', 'erotic', 'thrillers', 'really', 'show', 'black', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'gansters', 'comedy', 'film', 'moderately', 'complex', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'rather', 'predictable', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'film', 'other', 'erotic', 'thrillers', 'bigger', 'production', 'companies', 'where', 'have', 'more', 'money', 'more', 'experienced', 'cast', 'members', 'company', 'Rainforest', 'Productions', 'based', 'Atlanta', 'moving', 'right', 'direction', 'films', 'such', 'Trois', 'series', 'Fox', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'screen', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'when', 'cast', 'right', 'are', 'Hallie', 'Berry', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'times', 'acting', 'rather', 'forced', 'top', 'experience', 'will', 'get', 'better', ""'m"", 'sure', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'was', 'nice', 'introduction', 'most', 'can', 'tell', 'Shemar', 'so-called', 'best', 'friend', 'rather', 'shady', 'character', 'so', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'trying', 'frame', 'whom', 'little', 'more', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'mentioned', 'before', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Even', ""'re"", 'able', 'figure', 'everything', 'film', 'out', 'well', 'ending', 'interesting', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'events', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'really', 'challenging', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'then', 'perhaps', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'better']",Motives

In this film Shemar Moore plays a pretty boy (in fact throughout the film he's often referred to as a ""pretty boy"") and scoundrel, who has an extramarital affair with dire consequences.  Shemar Moore is, as usual, impeccably gorgeous and I must say that his acting in this film was not THAT bad considering what he had to work with.  It is however, not a five star performance; but then again Moore is not a 5 star actor.  Some of his dialogue is somewhat corny, and I am not sure if this can be attributed to the screenwriting or him-I suspect the latter, because this seems to be a commonality in his performances. Of course, the immensely talented and beautiful Vivica Fox always does a great job; she and Moore have some chemistry, but Vivica outshines him and seemed to be a bit too much woman for him (Shemar Moore) who looked like a boy-toy in their scenes together. Joe Torry and Sean Blakemore give the best performances in the film (they are VERY good). Victoria Rowell is as usual beautiful, but is a bit over the top at times, and Mel Jackson tries his best with the dirth of material he's given. Overall, the film has plenty of beautiful people, and was decent; though not a great film, it was not a bad film either-though I could have done without the graphic sex scenes.",3,The Beautiful People....,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,1456,"['was', 'bit', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'kick', 'seeing', 'very', 'capable', 'performance', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Black', 'Woman', 'decided', 'get', 'film', 'see', 'more', 'acting', 'film', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'pretty', 'boy', 'fact', 'film', 'often', 'referred', 'pretty', 'boy', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'usual', 'impeccably', 'gorgeous', 'must', 'say', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'THAT', 'bad', 'considering', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'however', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'performance', 'then', 'again', 'Moore', 'not', '5', 'star', 'actor', 'dialogue', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'screenwriting', 'him-I', 'suspect', 'latter', 'be', 'commonality', 'performances', 'course', 'immensely', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'Moore', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Vivica', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'woman', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'who', 'looked', 'boy-toy', 'scenes', 'together', 'Joe', 'Torry', 'Sean', 'Blakemore', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'VERY', 'good', 'Victoria', 'Rowell', 'as', 'usual', 'beautiful', 'bit', 'top', 'times', 'Mel', 'Jackson', 'best', 'dirth', 'material', 'given', 'Overall', 'film', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'people', 'was', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'either-though', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes']",Motives

He could lose it all by having an affair with a beautiful temptress named Allanah (Goldyn Brooks).  The movie is a suspense thriller. The movie is about Love, Betrayal, and making decisions that you will later regret.  The movie has you wondering who is trying to play who, the person that you think is doing the playing ends up getting played.  I enjoyed the movie. It's a decent movie.
