Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere is one of those shows. It has lots of potential. Unfortunately, it becomes quickly apparent that there is nothing to see here beyond the skintight clothes and fanservice. The characters talk in ways that would be interesting if they actually had something to say that was deeper than merely reflecting the action on the screen. And when they do finally have something to say, it becomes a wall of text infodump with added English and German mixed in for extra confusion. This is a train wreck of epic proportions.But hey, the fanservice is top notch. You want to see boobs and butts and skin tight clothes? Check. Random fanservice lesbians? Check. Reverse trap with a complex about her chest? Check check check.Honestly, I really did want to like this show. I love light novel adaptations but this one is so weak I have to pass and warn others away. Far away.

1578089,AIS3Q7ISV0WGQ,B008XEZXIE,Angel,"[45, 54]","Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere is one of those anime's that you absolutely have to give a look. The animation is great, the songs are catchy, and the storyline is unique. Based centuries in the future where humans have comeback to Earth from outer-space to find that Japan is the only livable plot of land, the people of Earth create outer dimensions of Japan in order to accommodate all the people and follow the ""Testament"" in hopes of repeating history and returning to the great beyond.It is completely over-the-top crazy and wildly entertaining, and fails to fit in a neatly defined genre. The writing is pure genius and has carried over well into the anime which despite its complexity doesn't stop for long-winded explanations, but rather sweeps the audience away with the constant hands-on revelations about the structure of its world. This anime will confuse in the beginning you need to have strong mind that all i can say,its intriguing series that has me hooked up. There is a bit of something for everyone from Tons of action, an underlying love story, to raunchy comedy, Oh yeah Fanservice, most characters have Large Boobs.There are many whiners that dun understand it at all, gave up on series early there lost, there is a good chance the series will continue for a long time.

What was that technique? A debate. No, that's not a joke. That just gives you an idea of how different (and good) this show is. The characters decide to battle with a debate and what a debate! The main male character starts off with a unique tactic in this unique battle strategy that I have never before seen in a debate. Watch to find out what it was.This anime will have to be watched twice to understand fully what is going on as it doesn't explain the background and when the characters do exposition the history or their circumstances, it is still full with gaps.
