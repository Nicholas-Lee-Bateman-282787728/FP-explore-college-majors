Yes, this anime has great graphics (a bit dark, but that's the way the anime is). Yes, the characters are interesting. Yes the music (when appropriate)is well done. Usually you would expect a great ending right? Ehh somewhat. While the ending did close the doors, I felt it was a bit rushed. It's like trying to get the lunch line first....someone will get hurt getting there...well anyways, it is still an interesting and thoughtful (I mean it really makes you think sometimes!)anime.

For those who have watched through the whole series and finally reached the finally: the end was well worth the wait.  You will be awed and shocked by the final two episodes and the events that take place within.  The only problem (and a good one) is that the ending is so complex, you may need to watch the series over again to fully understand it.  On another note, many viewers may struggle with the complex themes and metaphors throughout the final chapter, but this is one reason why I watch anime so often: you have to actually have a brain and think things through sometimes.  This is not Transformers the movie (all action, no story).  This is another anime that shows you why these are not made for kids.This is the greatest artistic anime to date.  The colors, the tone, the music, even the voice acting (both Japanese and English are perfect; I actually prefer the English dub).  An amazing finale to a great series!  This is an instant classic that should be in every anime library.Pros: Artwork is the best I have seen so far, amazing story, wonderful characters.Cons: Very advanced story and metaphors, some viewers may be unable to comprehend.",5,A Fitting Finale to a Modern Classic,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1215,"['What', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'phenomenal', 'anime', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'finally', 'reached', 'finally', 'end', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'will', 'be', 'awed', 'shocked', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'only', 'problem', 'good', 'one', 'ending', 'so', 'complex', 'may', 'need', 'watch', 'series', 'over', 'again', 'fully', 'understand', 'note', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'struggle', 'complex', 'themes', 'metaphors', 'final', 'chapter', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'watch', 'anime', 'so', 'often', 'have', 'actually', 'have', 'brain', 'think', 'things', 'sometimes', 'not', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'action', 'story', 'anime', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'kids.This', 'greatest', 'artistic', 'anime', 'date', 'colors', 'tone', 'music', 'even', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'English', 'are', 'perfect', 'actually', 'prefer', 'English', 'dub', 'amazing', 'finale', 'great', 'series', 'instant', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'anime', 'library.Pros', 'Artwork', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'amazing', 'story', 'wonderful', 'characters.Cons', 'Very', 'advanced', 'story', 'metaphors', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'unable', 'comprehend']","Ergo Proxy, Volume 6: Deus Ex Machina"
1068172,A1COAX8KHFQHE3,B000P296B2,David Roth,"[2, 3]","Ergo Proxy Vol 6 marks the last volume in one of the most intriguing and thought provoking series I have seen in quite some time. While I can't go into too much details as to what actually goes on in the episodes I will give a brief spoiler free overview of where the disc starts. It picks up after Pino, Re-l, and Vincent have returned to Romdo to find that all is not well. There is what could be described as a civil war going on between the humans and the entourages. All the while you can tell there is something sinister lurking in the background just waiting to make itself known. The three episodes on the disc reveal everything that has been hidden in the past. As a result there are a lot of things thrown at you at once (as animes so often tend to do), so you may not get everything right away but after a few watches it does make sense. Re-l's truth and past is revealed along with Vincent's and the truth about what Proxy's are. Not too mention what roles the Regient, Daedalus, and Raul play in the unfolding of it all. One of the things I enjoyed most though, was the fact that this makes the previous episode about the Walt Disney like world make sense. If you read my review about that, I couldn't find anything relevant to it at all in the story. Now I can and that just shows how well the team behind the series developed it. Obviously if you are reading this you have probably watched the rest of the series and will pick this up regardless, but if for some reason you haven't seen any of it or just some, I cannot recommend it anymore. This is one of the best animes to come out in recent memory.",5,The end of a great series,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1617,"['Ergo', 'Proxy', 'Vol', '6', 'last', 'volume', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'details', 'what', 'actually', 'episodes', 'will', 'give', 'brief', 'spoiler', 'free', 'overview', 'where', 'disc', 'up', 'Pino', 'Re-l', 'Vincent', 'have', 'returned', 'Romdo', 'find', 'not', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'civil', 'war', 'going', 'humans', 'entourages', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'sinister', 'lurking', 'background', 'just', 'waiting', 'make', 'known', 'three', 'episodes', 'disc', 'reveal', 'everything', 'been', 'hidden', 'past', 'result', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'thrown', 'once', 'animes', 'so', 'often', 'tend', 'do', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'away', 'few', 'watches', 'make', 'sense', 'Re-l', 'truth', 'past', 'revealed', 'Vincent', 'truth', 'what', 'Proxy', 'are', 'Not', 'too', 'mention', 'what', 'Regient', 'Daedalus', 'Raul', 'play', 'unfolding', 'One', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'fact', 'previous', 'episode', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'world', 'make', 'sense', 'read', 'review', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'relevant', 'story', 'Now', 'can', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'team', 'series', 'developed', 'Obviously', 'are', 'reading', 'have', 'probably', 'watched', 'rest', 'series', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'regardless', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'anymore', 'one', 'best', 'animes', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'memory']","Ergo Proxy, Volume 6: Deus Ex Machina"

1068174,A1DSES64WY3DGM,B000P296B2,SnowDog3000,"[0, 0]","Great show. Interesting, dark visuals. Most of the time has realistic characters, sometimes goes into superhero action mode common to much anime. Interesting characters in Vincent, Re-L, Pino, Daedalus, and the Security Chief. There are some weak episodes that are probably best to skip, namely episodes 11, 14, 15, 16, and 20. And for a slightly more upbeat ending, I would suggest watching episode 19 last.The story is really about man's ability to destroy and also about his ability to create, and that humans must choose their own fates and not rely on thier rulers, such as Ergo, to save them from the bad things in life.*** Semi-Spoilers ahead: The basic gist of the story is that after a terrible world holocaust, the leaders of mankind create these superhuman beings called proxies to run the few remaining human domed cities (also referred to as arks) in different parts of the world, in order to prevent man's extinction and resurrect humanity from the ashes of the world war. In the meantime, a machine virus is causing many of the humanoid machines to ""develop souls"" (ie: become self-aware) and leads to various interesting character developments. As for the proxies, the foremost of the superhuman beings is Ergo, and like his fellow proxies, his dual nature has tremendous power both to create and to destroy. Over the many years, they created many amazing cities and mechanical servants of the remaining humans in these cities to shape humanity for the future. But the catch is, that the ancient humans who created the proxies, were also afraid that they might become too powerful, and so built into them programs that would prevent them from teaming up, as well as self-detructive or violent tendancies that which would make them feared by mankind. Even though the original creators of the proxies are long dead, the rules progammed into them live on. Unless, Ergo can break free and choose his own fate. All in all, a very different and interesting glimpse into the future.p.s.
