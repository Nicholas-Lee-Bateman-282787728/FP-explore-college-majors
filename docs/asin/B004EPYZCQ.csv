This means she has become the ultimate self help person who verges on the evangelical as she wants to improve the world while still being employed in corporate America.  This leads to positively cringe worthy scenes which Laura Dern does beautifully. My favorite one was a baby shower she attended for a coworker. When it became time for her to toast the baby shower mother to be, Amy launches into a plea for them all to join together for a Mexican mother on the news who is being deported back to Mexico while her children are left behind in California. The other women look like deer frozen in the headlights as they listen to her.  She is absolutely clueless as to how out inappropriate this speech was for someone else's joyous occasion.This would be an easy character to hate except that Dern gives her many layers. She now has been forced to work with the nerd division down in the basement of her company. There she makes her first friend post treatment and he is someone she would have never even spoken to before this.

Not only does ""Enlightened"" skewer our corporate culture with its fake smiles, secret loathings and high school cliques, but it also rips into the new age culture that is so prevalent in Southern California--right now! Lots of cringe humor here, also moments where you just cringe, as Laura Dern launches herself like a guided missile at the wrong person at the wrong time.

Laura Dern's ""Enlightened"" certainly is part of it.My first reaction to the first couple of episodes of this show is that it provided too many juicy opportunities to pass up for easy scorn and scoffing at LA-LA-Land New Age style faux-progressivism and middle class neurosis of the sort first identified by the old New Left theorists over four decades ago (think Herbert Marcuse and Guy Debord). And so it does. The main character played by Dern is such a cliche of these patterns that she could be taken for a mistrel show rendering of them. Dern's performance is masterful in everything from the grating empathy of her Vally Girl vocal patterns to the contorted expressions of deep concern for others' sufferings evident in her ever-twisted face. Her passion for self-help, positive thinking books and grandiose plans to save the planet by changing from within the culture of the trans-national consumer products corporation for which she works adds to the hilarity of her New Age enlightenment. To say nothing to the bill presented by her Hawaiian asrham for its priceless contribution to that enlightenment equivalent to a year's tuition at Harvard.It nonetheless becomes clear in ""Enlightenment"" that the profound shallowness of the culture and approach the main character takes to her own and the world's problems are the only tools she has for beginning to grapple with them. She (and we) really are trapped in a ruthless and irresponsible global capitalist world order, against which any effective push-back is increasingly difficult. That the most intimate personal relationships in this kind of world fracture under the pressures of ambition, despair and disappointment. And that trying to make even small changes to make this Brave New World more humane can make one seem (and even actually become!) maladjusted to the point of insanity. The brilliance of ""Enlightened"" is its engagement and expose of this world in a comic and real way that is never overly polemical, heavy-handed or didactic.

1398316,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EPYZCQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","One of the lowest rated programs on HBO's 2011 roster, ""Enlightened"" (created by stars Mike White and Laura Dern) was both fascinatingly unpredictable and practically impossible to describe succinctly. It's closest cousins are probably the Showtime line-up of wacky female-centric comedies--such as Nurse Jackie, The Big C, Weeds, and United States of Tara. But that comparison is mostly about tone and viewpoint as ""Enlightened"" has a distinctly unique voice that is unlike anything else on the TV landscape. Some episodes play rather seriously, others highlight slapstick mayhem, while others are incisive and filled with awkward humor. Is it a comedy? Certainly. Is it dramatic? You bet. Is it one of the most pointed character studies on TV? Absolutely, and this, more than anything else, is ""Enlightened"" strongest asset. Spiritual enlightenment and striving to create a more perfect world are usually topics handled with a startling lack of subtlety in comedy. They are almost always the punchline to a more cynical type of humor. And yet, while Laura Dern's Amy is a frustratingly flawed protagonist, her search for meaning is amazingly sensitive and real.Credit for the show's success sits squarely on its screenplays and its performances. Therefore, writers and stars Laura Dern and Mike White really must be given accolades for the show's impressive creative arc. I've been a fan of White's since the bizarrely intriguing ""Chuck and Buck"" (I, also, might be the only person on the planet that laments the early death of his before-its-time nighttime soap opera ""Pasadena""). He's found a real collaborator and muse in Dern, who turns in one of the season's most underrated performances as the complex central character. The ten episode season begins as Dern experiences a break-down at work, and after a retreat, attempts to rebuild her life into something much more meaningful. However, it's hard to remain Zen as the career she knew no longer has a place for her. Struggling in a new department (with co-worker White) Dern is also trying to rebuild her difficult relationship with her mother (Dern's real life mom Diane Ladd) and reform her troubled ex-husband (Luke Wilson). She yearns to really make a difference, both on those she cares for and on the world in general. But she can be so single-minded and so selfish, the struggle to enlightenment and goodness never runs smoothly.The primary source of ""Enlightened"" comedy is that Dern truly is an appalling employee. She is such a mess, seemingly without realizing her shortcomings, because she's always looking at the bigger picture. Part of the show's genius is that it allows Dern to come off as thoroughly unlikable (or flat out wrong) in many instances. But it also makes you understand her quest and constant struggle. Truly memorable moments of the series include Dern going on a job interview (spectacularly written!) only to realize it doesn't pay enough to live on and an episode dedicated to Ladd's character. Dern is a revelation, White is dead-pan perfection, and Ladd and Wilson offer exemplary support. I was never less than fascinated to see where ""Enlightened"" would go. I presumed it would conclude after one season due to the low ratings, but when the show picked up Golden Globe nods for Best comedy and Best Actress--HBO greenlit a second season. The show has also featured prominently in many year-end ""Best of Television"" critics' lists.""Enlightened,"" in the long run, may not be a show for everyone. You really have to appreciate it as a character study as much as a comedy. If you're expecting big laughs, the show may not always meet your needs. It can be painfully funny, but it can also be painfully real. I hope more people pick up on the show, it deserves a wider audience. About 4 1/2 stars.

1398326,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004EPYZCQ,M. Bullions,"[1, 1]","Season one of HBO&#8217;s new gem of a show &#8220;Enlightened&#8221; follows heroine (anti-heroine?) Amy Jellicoe (Laura Dern), after a very public (and quite funny, in a sad way) meltdown at work, and a stint at a holistic cult-like rehabilitation center, as she tries to live an enlightened and positive life, despite the numerous curve balls thrown at her from all possible angles.Jellicoe is a difficult character. She&#8217;s likable sometimes, and extremely fake and eye-roll inducing at others. The first time we see her is at an emotionally charged low in her life, and we know exactly what this woman is capable of, even though we cheer her efforts to change, the initial question remains &#8211; do people REALLY have the capacity to change? In my opinion, the characters that are best-written aren&#8217;t likable. They&#8217;re complicated and capable of dramatic highs and lows.Mike White and Laura Dern co-created &#8220;Enlightened&#8221; together, and Dern has always had a liking for playing damaged and complicated characters. So imagine what she does when she has the mother-child relationship with her character. Jellicoe is an onion, with layers being peeled away in each (too-short) 30-minute episode.But that&#8217;s a problem. Why is &#8220;Enlightened&#8221; given the 30-minute length of a comedy? While it certainly has its moments of great humor and comedic insight, it&#8217;s by no means a laugh-out-loud comedy. It&#8217;s much more interesting if you don&#8217;t approach it as a comedy, but as a drama with comedic elements. It&#8217;s interesting to think what the writers could have done if each show was an hour long. In the end, it&#8217;s about a character&#8217;s journey to self-fulfillment, despite all the terrifying insanity around her, some of which she is responsible for.In a standout episode, &#8220;Consider Helen,&#8221; we see Jellicoe&#8217;s mother (played by Dern&#8217;s real life mother, Diane Ladd), and the struggle that she&#8217;s been through in her life, and the quiet anger and regret that she holds within her, that she doesn&#8217;t care to talk about. This rare episode, from another character&#8217;s perspective, adds a fresh layer to the story, and makes everything that happens thereafter a bit more interesting.At the end of the first season of &#8220;Enlightened,&#8221; we leave Jellicoe in a place where the truth has hit her in the face. She&#8217;s at a crossroads and she has two paths to choose from &#8211; the right, which would jeopardize her job, her family and everything about her life that&#8217;s safe and secure, or the wrong, which would allow for poker-faced, unquestioning simplicity to rule her life. What does she choose? Stay tuned for season two of &#8220;Enlightened.&#8221;",5,"Fascinating character study drives HBO's criminally underrated ""Enlightened""",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2769,"['Season', 'one', 'HBO', '8217', 'new', 'gem', 'show', '8220', 'Enlightened', '8221', 'heroine', 'anti-heroine', 'Amy', 'Jellicoe', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'very', 'public', 'quite', 'funny', 'sad', 'way', 'meltdown', 'work', 'stint', 'holistic', 'cult-like', 'rehabilitation', 'center', 'live', 'enlightened', 'positive', 'life', 'numerous', 'curve', 'balls', 'thrown', 'possible', 'angles.Jellicoe', 'difficult', 'character', '8217', 'likable', 'sometimes', 'extremely', 'fake', 'eye-roll', 'inducing', 'others', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'low', 'life', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'woman', 'capable', 'even', 'cheer', 'efforts', 'change', 'initial', 'question', '8211', 'do', 'people', 'REALLY', 'have', 'capacity', 'change', 'opinion', 'characters', 'are', 'best-written', 'aren', '8217', 'likable', '8217', 'complicated', 'capable', 'dramatic', 'highs', 'lows.Mike', 'White', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'co-created', '8220', 'Enlightened', '8221', 'Dern', 'always', 'had', 'liking', 'playing', 'damaged', 'complicated', 'characters', 'So', 'imagine', 'what', 'when', 'mother-child', 'relationship', 'character', 'Jellicoe', 'onion', 'layers', 'being', 'peeled', 'away', 'too-short', '30-minute', 'episode.But', '8217', 'problem', 'Why', '8220', 'Enlightened', '8221', 'given', '30-minute', 'length', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'moments', 'great', 'humor', 'comedic', 'insight', '8217', 's', 'means', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', '8217', 's', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'don', '8217', 'approach', 'comedy', 'drama', 'comedic', 'elements', '8217', 'interesting', 'think', 'what', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'show', 'was', 'hour', 'long', 'end', '8217', 's', 'character', '8217', 'journey', 'self-fulfillment', 'terrifying', 'insanity', 'responsible', 'for.In', 'standout', 'episode', '8220', 'Consider', 'Helen', '8221', 'see', 'Jellicoe', '8217', 'mother', 'played', 'Dern', '8217', 'real', 'life', 'mother', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'struggle', '8217', 's', 'been', 'life', 'quiet', 'anger', 'regret', 'doesn', '8217', 'care', 'talk', 'rare', 'episode', 'character', '8217', 'perspective', 'fresh', 'layer', 'story', 'everything', 'thereafter', 'bit', 'more', 'end', 'first', 'season', '8220', 'Enlightened', '8221', 'leave', 'Jellicoe', 'place', 'where', 'truth', 'hit', 'face', '8217', 's', 'crossroads', 'two', 'paths', 'choose', '8211', 'right', 'would', 'jeopardize', 'job', 'family', 'everything', 'life', '8217', 'safe', 'secure', 'wrong', 'would', 'allow', 'poker-faced', 'unquestioning', 'simplicity', 'rule', 'life', 'What', 'choose', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'season', 'two', '8220', 'Enlightened.', '8221']",Enlightened: Season 1

The character humiliates herself over and over again.I think the acting is terrific and Dern is giving this 100%. Ladd's performances are gems. I found nothing redemptive in season 1 nor any take away. I found myself thinking of terrible employees and co-workers I've had and a lot of them were like Amy.Come to think of it, I did like a second episode about a yoga instructor (Sandy) who was visiting Amy.
