1206400,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B001JNNDC4,Amanda Richards,"[21, 29]","Angela Carson: Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben. That's it. There's nothing behind them.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Ex-cop Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland) is forced by necessity to take a job as a night watchman at a Department Store that has been gutted by a major fire.2. It doesn't take him 24 hours to find out that something's not quite right with his new job3. Sure enough, he soon learns that the Department Store was once a totally different type of institution, and that the man who burned it down had also killed his own family.  Strangely enough, the large mirrors in the building have all survived the destruction.4. When the hallucinations start, Ben starts digging around, and discovers a clue - the word ""esseker""5. No prizes for guessing that something evil lurks in the mirror world, and soon Ben's family become targets.6. It's up to Ben to find a way to save his family, and his time is almost up.This is a creepy, gritty sort of horror flick that will have you thinking twice about looking into the mirror, even if you've never before been able to pass one by without checking yourself out.  A bit of gore here and there adds to the drama, but the spine-tingling bits occur in the quieter moments.  The ending however, isn't so much anticlimactic as understated.

Of course I'm a fan of Kiefer Sutherland mainly for his incredible acting abilities in the hit TV show 24, but his movie performances are starting to win me over too.Jack's attempt... er, Kiefer's attempt at the horror genre is a pretty satisfying one.Mirrors is a terrifying movie because of certain tricks that happen to the mirrors throughout the film.  In a few scenes, Kiefer was shooting directly at the mirror only for the glass to ""grow back"" into place a few seconds later, like the glass had never been broken in the first place.Also, whenever someone who was facing a mirror would turn away, their image would still be marked into the mirror like they were still looking directly into it.  Very freaky stuff like that made the level of terror go through the roof.Some graphic, bloody scenes also dominated the film, such as one... memorable bathtub incident.  Probably the best part of the entire movie.  Also there was a mystery element to the entire film as Kiefer searched around for clues to try and explain the incident and stop it from killing his family.Kiefer attempting to get people to believe him about the odd and dangerous evil that lurks inside the mirrors was good storytelling too, because of course, no one believed a single word he said.Eventually it was figured out that anything that causes a reflection can bring harm to Kiefer's family, and this is when the movie really gets good.Overall, Mirrors is truly a great horror film that delivers the suspense, mystery, and action that you crave.",5,great movie,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,1548,"['really', 'liked', 'Mirrors', 'course', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'mainly', 'incredible', 'acting', 'abilities', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', '24', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'starting', 'win', 'too.Jack', 'attempt', 'er', 'Kiefer', 'attempt', 'horror', 'genre', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'one.Mirrors', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'certain', 'tricks', 'happen', 'mirrors', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'Kiefer', 'was', 'shooting', 'directly', 'mirror', 'only', 'glass', 'grow', 'back', 'place', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'glass', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'broken', 'first', 'place.Also', 'whenever', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'facing', 'mirror', 'would', 'turn', 'away', 'image', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'marked', 'mirror', 'were', 'still', 'looking', 'directly', 'Very', 'freaky', 'stuff', 'made', 'level', 'terror', 'go', 'roof.Some', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'also', 'dominated', 'film', 'such', 'one', 'memorable', 'bathtub', 'incident', 'Probably', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'Also', 'was', 'mystery', 'element', 'entire', 'film', 'Kiefer', 'searched', 'clues', 'try', 'explain', 'incident', 'stop', 'killing', 'family.Kiefer', 'attempting', 'get', 'people', 'believe', 'odd', 'dangerous', 'evil', 'mirrors', 'was', 'good', 'storytelling', 'too', 'course', 'one', 'believed', 'single', 'word', 'said.Eventually', 'was', 'figured', 'out', 'anything', 'reflection', 'can', 'bring', 'harm', 'Kiefer', 'family', 'when', 'movie', 'really', 'good.Overall', 'Mirrors', 'truly', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'action', 'crave']",Mirrors

As the visions transform into a terrifying reality, Ben must unravel the mystery behind the store's sordid past or face the wrath of the restless spirits within. Alexandre Aja's third foray into feature-length Horror is a considerable let down after the smash hits HIGH TENSION and THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake. MIRRORS never presents a consistent canon when it comes to the extent of the spirits' powers. First, it seems that they have the power to posses a person after looking in the mirror, then it seems they can steal the person's identity, entirely. The spirits are able to jump from the haunted location in to any other building with no established rule set, either, and their complete ability to interact with our world is dubious at best. It all seems so convenient and contrived that it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief. Kiefer Sutherland is outrageously over-the-top and can't be taken seriously in the role. Where the mirror motif offered Aja the potential to provide supreme tension and eerie atmosphere, he squanders every opportunity to unnerve the audience by using cheap shocks and excessive gore instead of a creating a slow suspense and creepy mood.

The only things I can see wrong with the movie would be the following:  1) the movie spends the majority of the time building up and then ends pretty quickly, squashing most of the ""fight scenes"" with the ""horror scenes"" in about 10 minutes time, and 2) the ""re-watchable"" factor for me is somewhat low (note:  this doesn't take away from a movie being good but means it's not one I would want to see more than a few times at most).",4,"For a non-horror-fan, this was a good movie",1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,994,"['Much', 'better', 'expected', 'Most', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', 'nothing', 'other', 'make', 'jump', 'once', 'twice', 'when', ""'m"", 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'Stories', 'are', 'usually', 'lacking', 'common', 'sense', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'worse', 'Mirrors', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'split', 'husband', 'wife', 'odd', 'misplaced', 'halfway', 'explained', 'explaining', 'more', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'When', 'common', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'talking', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', 'do', 'only', 'things', 'can', 'see', 'wrong', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'following', '1', 'movie', 'majority', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'then', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'squashing', 'most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'horror', 'scenes', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'time', '2', 're-watchable', 'factor', 'somewhat', 'low', 'note', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'being', 'good', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'most']",Mirrors

1206420,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001JNNDC4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 4]","Slasher / horror films have to start off believable to actually scare the viewer. Mirrors just doesn't set the stage with anything credible.The opening montage of the security guard running around a subway station and then being forced to slit his throat with a broken mirror, works pretty well. It's scary, the guard looks trapped, and he has no idea what to do. The second scary part is when Jack Bauer, oopsie, Ben Carson, played by Keifer Sutherland, a laid off police detective does his rounds at night in a burned out department store. The part that just doesn't ring true, he jumps every single time a bird flies. The director keeps birds flying all over the place. A trained detective, even nervous, would never jump the way Ben does. From there the credible details just fall all over the place. At one point, Ben just blindly fires his gun, nothing there, no mirrors, just fires it. Definately not something a police officer would ever do. Detail after detail just stopped adding up.So this viewer had a lot of difficulty being drawn into the story line of this movie. Production-wise, the film is done decently. There's some out of focus shots. The pacing, which is absolutely critical to horror films, just didn't work. No rythmn was built and maintained. The film lopes along between gory scenes, dragging its feet most of the time. Audio was well recorded and dialog clear. The blood, seemed real.This is an extremely gory movie. About every 20 minutes a person is killed or disfigured, and there is a ton of blood whenever that happens. The single worst one is the first bathtub scene. Frankly, that was probably a bit too far over the top. There's a fair amount of strong language. And there's two scenes of full nudity (Amy Smart one notable scene). Definately an R rated film. At one hour 50 minutes, this is a long film.The DVD has a single special feature, theatrical release and an unrated release. There is 1 minute difference between the two.

1206421,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001JNNDC4,Dave. K,"[4, 6]","MIRRORS***  Out of 5Release Date- August 15th, 2008Running Time- 110-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Alexandre Aja & Gregory LevasseurDirector- Alexandre AjaStarring- Kiefer Sutherland, Paula Patton, Amy Smart, Cameron Boyce, Erica Gluck, Mary Beth PeilUpon my first viewing of Mirrors I really didn't care for the movie at all I suppose maybe my expectations were too high; I've been a fan of Kiefer Sutherland since I was 9-years old after seeing Young Guns and now with 24 he's easily one of my very favorite actors of all time and I think Alexandre Aja has potential to be a great horror filmmaker so with these two involved I expected a lot more. But watching Mirrors again I've gained a little more appreciation for the movie; while far from a classic it does serve it's purpose as a fun if not very flawed movie.The screenplay by Alexandre Aja & Gregory Levasseur for the most part was pretty good; the characters are fairly interesting and are developed a bit as well. While not the greatest characters in a horror movie they are more than faceless characters. There is a good amount of drama added in and actually I think the dramatic elements worked better than the horror. I found myself more interested in the drama and that is where I found the writing to be at the best. Overall the screenplay might be lacking in some spots, but I suppose it's better than most horror screenplays these days.After bursting onto the scene with Haute Tension, Alexandre Aja I feel hasn't lived up to his potential. While I did enjoy The Hills Have Eyes remake I also felt it could have been better. And with Mirrors he seems to be staying put rather than moving forward. The thing about Aja is that me makes violence really scary. In general when it comes to horror the violence isn't the scary part it's the build up, but Aja is one of those filmmakers that can make the violence really creepy.With Mirrors Aja does well I suppose; the pace of the movie is good I can't say I was ever bored during the movie, but I found the suspense and tension to be slightly lacking and that is the biggest problem. Aja can make a suspenseful movie. Haute Tension is proof of that. When the killer shows up and starts killing people in the house were some of the most tension filled scenes I've seen in a long time. But since Haute Tension I don't think Aja has lived up to that potential even though he's always right about to reach it. Again Mirrors is never really slow and always moves forward so in that regard he gets the job done, but it's just the suspense and tension lack at times.Unlike his other movies Mirrors is a much more character driven movie that relies more on the characters and suspense than that of the violence. I think Alexandre Aja does fairly well with the characters and his dramatic scenes are the ones that work best oddly enough, but his suspense scenes don't work as well. Essentially I think the biggest problem is Mirrors is one of those movies you watch then sort of forget. You know those movies you watch and than a bit later someone asks you about it, but you can't remember the details? Well that's sort of what Mirrors was like for me. While I did enjoy the movie the 2nd time around it's still sort of forgettable.The one thing we know about Alexandre Aja is the man loves his gore and Mirrors while violent is nowhere near the level of Haute Tension or The Hills Have Eyes, but the few gore scenes were quite brutal only brought down by some shoddy CGI. The jaw ripping scene was awesome, but the CGI was a little poor. That is tough to pull off, but Adam Green did in Hatchet without the use of CGI. But the gore was excellent, but the CGI slightly brings it down. I don't wanna spoil anything, but a certain character who was engulfed in flames was some really poor CGI it really looked bad. But despite some suspect CGI the gore scenes were pretty cool and the jaw ripping scene was the highlight.Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer um I mean Ben Carson and Sutherland like always gives an excellent performance, but it's as if he made a wrong turn on the set of 24 and ended up on the Mirrors set. Sutherland is pretty much playing Jack Bauer. The final act is where it really shows if you just walked into the room and saw this on screen your first thought would be 24. First thing I wanna say is Jack Bauer is one of the greatest characters of all time and Sutherland plays the role to perfection, but he has a lot of depth and range as an actor and it's a shame to see him reduced to pretty much playing the same role.Paula Patton as Amy Carson also provides a solid performance and that brings me back to the drama element. I liked the basic idea with the characters even if a little clich&eacute;d, Ben Carson is the troubled ex cop sort of a broken down man and he is separated from his wife. While we have seen this done plenty of times in all genres, I think it added a lot of depth to Ben and Amy Carson and that's why I said I think the dramatic scenes is where Aja & Levasseur get it right in their writing and where Aja does excellent as director.In closing Mirrors isn't a bad movie it's never really boring, but just lacks the suspense and tension. Don't go in expecting Haute Tension, but if you don't expect too much you'll probably enjoy the movie. Hopefully Alexandre Aja can reclaim what he did with Haute Tension. But he needs to chill with all the remakes. Mirrors, though makes for a fun time, but sort of forgettable.The Blu-ray is amazing. The picture and sound quality are excellent, the picture is sharp and the colors are excellent. Of all the BD I own Mirrors easily ranks as one of my favorites.",3,"Didn't like it at first, but it's growing on me ***",1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,5648,"['MIRRORS***', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-',

Jack Bauer running around with a flashlight in a burnt out department store while CGI cracks run through multiple mirrors....oooh scary. I actually got pretty angry watching this flick, as a fan of both Sutherland and Aja, I expected a tense and frightening flick. The talent is here, but completely wasted. The singature suspense found in most Aja flicks is completely absent. Kiefer Sutherland does his best morose Jack Bauer impersonation as a drug addled ex-cop trying to cope with a mistake made while he was still on the job. Finding a position as a night watchman in a burned out NYC department store, he suddenly finds himself facing down an evil force that travels through various mirrors and reflective surfaces. The characters are dull, the special effects are Sci-Fi channel original movie quality, and basic storyline is non-sensical. While Aja does inject a couple frightening scenes here and there, it's way too little, way too late to keep any interest.Avoid this sucker, re-watch an old season of ""24"" or ""The Lost Boys"" to see Sutherland on top of his game, or re-watch ""High Tension"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"" to see Aja's better work.",2,Chalk up Another Lousy Asian Horror Remake,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1181,"['Ugh', 'was', 'flick', 'bore', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'running', 'around', 'flashlight', 'burnt', 'out', 'department', 'store', 'CGI', 'cracks', 'run', 'multiple', 'mirrors', '.oooh', 'scary', 'actually', 'got', 'pretty', 'angry', 'watching', 'flick', 'fan', 'Sutherland', 'Aja', 'expected', 'tense', 'frightening', 'flick', 'talent', 'here', 'completely', 'wasted', 'singature', 'suspense', 'found', 'most', 'Aja', 'flicks', 'completely', 'absent', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'best', 'morose', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'impersonation', 'drug', 'addled', 'ex-cop', 'trying', 'cope', 'mistake', 'made', 'was', 'still', 'job', 'Finding', 'position', 'night', 'watchman', 'burned', 'out', 'NYC', 'department', 'store', 'suddenly', 'facing', 'down', 'evil', 'force', 'various', 'mirrors', 'reflective', 'surfaces', 'characters', 'are', 'dull', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'original', 'movie', 'quality', 'basic', 'storyline', 'non-sensical', 'Aja', 'inject', 'couple', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'way', 'too', 'little', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'keep', 'interest.Avoid', 'sucker', 're-watch', 'old', 'season', '24', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'see', 'Sutherland', 'top', 'game', 're-watch', 'High', 'Tension', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'see', 'Aja', 'better', 'work']",Mirrors
1206423,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001JNNDC4,David J. Brown,"[0, 1]","I don't do plot synopsis in my reviews, so just scroll up for that.This is the newest Alexander Aja film(directed High Tension and remake of The Hills Have Eyes).  So far his films have been about human killers and sociopaths, but this one veers into the supernatural.  He's got the goods when it comes to moody lighting and a good set-up, but he brings along some ultra gorey sequences that were more fitting in his previous films, well there are actually only two in the film, but the second scene of major graphic violence is real grotesque and may turn off those tuning in for simple haunting.  The set-up is basic horror stuff.  Ex-cop(swear, they're always ex-cops so they have easy access to friends with info they couldn't possible get on their own and so they can carry a gun properly), ex-alcoholic takes a night time security job guarding the ruins of a burned down department store in New York.  Sounds like the Shining, right?  Well, it really does, but unlike the Kubrick film, the characters in the film feel real and are fairly fleshed out in their archetypical roles.Of course like most cinematic hauntings of recent years there's a mystery to solve and only Kiefer Sutherland can do it.  The mirrors are doing and showing him weird things from the store's past.  They etch a name in the glass of a woman he must find in order for the nasty mirrors to leave his wife and kids alone, wife and kids he seperated from of course--this ain't the strong family unit of the Poltergeist days.  The build up works.  Once you find out the answers to the mystery...well...well, things get a little goofy and outside the realm of understanding, even for a supernatural thriller.*SPOILER TOWN*  Okay, why do the spirits or ghosts or whatever have the power to mutilate and follow you home, but can't simply tell you what they want and why?  Amy Smart, plays Kiefer's sister, didn't really have to die.  In terms of film writing she is playing the Janet Leigh role, but I would have a little animosity towards these spirits if they killed my sister and I would be a little hesitant to help them, bunch of jerks.  I mean,I get it, her violent death gave the threat to his family some suspense but still...  Okay, and how come nobody talks about the fact that this department store was built on the old site of an asylum, isn't it always an asylum?  You think this would be common knowledge, at least on an urban legend level.  FINALLY, like I said before the answer to the film's mystery is totally silly.  These aren't ghosts in the mirror, it's one giant demonic entity looking to go back to its original host body.  Yup.  Stop smiling.  Apparently, a possessed girl was committed there and the doctor put her in a glass room to cure her of schizophrenia.  Why?  Movie doesn't really spend a bunch of time explaining our good doctor's theory on that one, and even less time on why the mirrors sucked the demon out of the girl in the first place.  When Sutherland reunited the girl and her demon(sounds kind of cute) the movie gets even sillier.  Now the nun is possessed again and she is jumping around like a hopped up monkey and fistacuffing it up with our ex-cop.  It's not scary.  It's not believable and its totally hysterical.Now I like my superantural horror with as little explanaions as possible, but this one pushes it a tad.  Why do the mirrors take the demon from the girl?  Does anyone know the answer from simply watching this film?  I have some previous knowledge about mirrors and their folklore origins involving soul stealing and evil trapping, and so do the writers of this film, but they don't incorporate it into their screenplay at all.  There's a cool special feature on the dvd that goes into mirror folklore, but why should I have to watch a dvd special feature to understand a film?  I shouldn't have to do homework to watch a movie(Yes, I'm looking right at you Southland Tales)!  This is an intriguing folklore idea and transporting it into a modern horror couldn've been a cool and intersting idea.The acting is all good, without being exceptional.  At this point I think unless Sutherland does a romantic comedy he will always be playing 24'S Jack Bauer.  The effects with the mirros are sometimes creepy.  The atmosphere in the first half is thick and effective.  The logic is out the window after about the hour mark, well as much logic as a film depicting supernatural events can have, but I assure it is possible.  The opening gore scene is unnecessary and ineffective, but really gross--if that's your thing.  It's a solid rental, but a better, ""Hey, looks whats on HBO, Mirrors, I kind of wanted to see that"" movie.

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 8]","... but instead it did for Alexandre Aja's stock what the economic recession did for the car industries-- dropped it harder and faster than a hammer onto a sleeping and sexually abusive stepfathers skull.  Much like my aforementioned(and tastless) comparison, Mirrors is such a forced mess that it makes you wonder just what the man behind two of the best horror offerings from the new millenium was going for?  The film tells the tale of an ex-cop(played by Keifer Sutherland in complete Jack Bauer of TV's 24 mode) who takes a night security job at a burned up department store.  We're not talking about just any run-of-the-mill Macy's here though, it's got a grisley and mysterious past!  You see, during one particularly ""creepy"" Fall sale, the store decided to sell mock-neck sweaters under the false pretenses of being full turtle necks... AND ALL SALES WERE FINAL!  Okay, maybe the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's plot from this point on is about as compelling.  In actuality it turns out that the store was built over the remains of a mental hospital accustomed to shady going-ons(are there any other kind?) and it's up to our anti-hero(he's a pill and alcohol abuser and generally bad husband and father, hence the ""anti"" before the ""hero"") to figure out what's going on before his life completely unravels.  From here on we get some great and genuinely unnerving moments involving the mirrors in the building, unevenly split with some extreme(and excellent) moments of grue.  Here lies the films main problem-- direction.  Not direction as in how it was filmed(Aja can shoot a great looking movie no doubt), but rather; direction as in where it's going and what it's deal is exactly.  Is it a ghost story, a demonic possession film, a slow-burn haunted house tale, a brooding mystery?  Oh it's all that and more!  The thing is, it's not only highly noticable everytime the movie does a 90 degree turn and reinvents itself, it's also jarring(including a Hollywood style, action-packed, CGI-laden final showdown that's pretty lame).  Calling Mirrors a movie(singular) would be a mistake, because it's actually movies(plural) rolled into a watchable but ultimately unmemorable 110 minutes(even though 109 of those minutes feature Keifer screaming at inanimate objects, which never gets old!).  2.5 stars, not one of the worst horror films of 2008, but far from one of the best(here's to Alexandre Aja bouncing back with his next offering Piranha-- although it is his 3rd remake in a row?!).",3,SHOULD'VE done for reflections what Jaws did for the water(2.5 stars),1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,2496,"['instead', 'did', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'stock', 'what', 'economic', 'recession', 'did', 'car', 'industries', 'dropped', 'harder', 'faster', 'hammer', 'sleeping', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'stepfathers', 'skull', 'Much', 'aforementioned', 'tastless', 'comparison', 'Mirrors', 'forced', 'mess', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'man', 'two', 'best', 'horror', 'offerings', 'new', 'millenium', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'tale', 'ex-cop', 'played', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'complete', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'TV', '24', 'mode', 'who', 'night', 'security', 'job', 'burned', 'up', 'department', 'store', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'about', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'Macy', 'here', 'got', 'grisley', 'mysterious', 'past', 'see', 'one', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'Fall', 'sale', 'store', 'decided', 'sell', 'mock-neck', 'sweaters', 'false', 'pretenses', 'being', 'full', 'turtle', 'necks', 'SALES', 'WERE', 'FINAL', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'movie', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'plot', 'point', 'about', 'compelling', 'actuality', 'out', 'store', 'was', 'built', 'remains', 'mental', 'hospital', 'accustomed', 'shady', 'going-ons', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'up', 'anti-hero', 'pill', 'alcohol', 'abuser', 'generally', 'bad', 'husband', 'father', 'hence', 'anti', 'hero', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'completely', 'unravels', 'here', 'get', 'great', 'genuinely', 'unnerving', 'moments', 'involving', 'mirrors', 'building', 'unevenly', 'split', 'extreme', 'excellent', 'moments', 'grue', 'Here', 'films', 'main', 'problem', 'direction', 'Not', 'direction', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'Aja', 'can', 'shoot', 'great', 'looking', 'movie', 'doubt', 'rather', 'direction', 'where', 'going', 'what', 'deal', 'exactly', 'ghost', 'story', 'demonic', 'possession', 'film', 'slow-burn', 'haunted', 'house', 'tale', 'brooding', 'mystery', 'more', 'thing', 'not', 'only', 'highly', 'noticable', 'everytime', 'movie', '90', 'degree', 'turn', 'reinvents', 'also', 'jarring', 'including', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'action-packed', 'CGI-laden', 'final', 'showdown', 'pretty', 'lame', 'Calling', 'Mirrors', 'movie', 'singular', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'actually', 'movies', 'plural', 'rolled', 'watchable', 'ultimately', 'unmemorable', '110', 'minutes', 'even', '109', 'minutes', 'feature', 'Keifer', 'screaming', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'never', 'old', '2.5', 'stars', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'horror', 'films', '2008', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'here', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'bouncing', 'back', 'next', 'offering', 'Piranha', '3rd', 'remake', 'row']",Mirrors

I have read a lot of things about this movie ranging from classic to horrible and I have to say that I find this film to be some where in the middle. This was in no part a bad movie in fact it is a really fun watch for those who like these type of films, there are some genuine scares to be had, some good creepy scenes. Plus Kiefer Sutherland and Alexandre Aja together should make for a good movie right?Ben Carson [Sutherland] is a cop who is loosing his grip on life and at the same time loosing his family because of an unfortunate event in which some one was killed. He is living with his sister played wonderfully by Amy Smart [glad to see her again], and is taking a new job as a security guard at an old department store. Everything seems fine at first but little by little something is stirring and trying to tell Ben something, but what could it be and what could it want? It turns out that there is something in the mirrors and it wants Ben to find some one for him and if he doesn't his family is at stake. So the race is one between man and demon [yes that is what it is, sorry for the spoiler] one out to kill and one out to stop it.I have to say that I really was not disappointed with this movie after reading a couple other reviews [WP] that let me know ahead of time to lower expectations. Of course since Aja directed this there will be high [as in tension] expectations for the film regardless for any one who follows the horror genre. I have to say that while it is not as good as his past efforts it is still a really well put together film with great direction and deserves a fair shot. Still though his screenplay with Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur based on Sung-ho Kim's film ""Into the Mirror"" is a little weak as far as dialogue goes, the story is there but the right words are not. It seems that the characters are kinda flat and missing something that makes them three dimensional. Still the tense moments do exist within this movie and are really well done and the film is shot perfectly as well. Another thing the film has going for it is the special effects, I have to say that the CGI is masterful and obviously the effects with the mirrors are great.As far as the acting goes producer/star Kiefer Sutherland returns to a genre that he was once a mainstay in some what. And while he once stole the show in things like ""The Lost Boys"" he is some what restrained in this one maybe that was the character though. Still I feel like something is missing in his performance particularly in the first third of the film. Still when the movie gets going so does Sutherland and that should be giving to his credit; he does do a good job with the film. Amy Smart does a great job as his sister and I have to say that her death scene is amazing, really one of the best things I have seen in a while. Paula Patton plays his wife who wants to help him but is still a little afraid of him does a good job in her role as well, as does Cameron Boyce and Erica Gluck  who play the kids. And of course the person who is really the most important is Mary Beth Peil who plays..........well you will see does a great job and may steal the show as far as performance goes.I must admit that I thought this movie would give me a little more but it fell a little short, still it is an enjoyable movie that at least should be on your rental list. Some of you will probably enjoy it enough to buy it, I did.

What is especially effective is the director's reliance on the viewer's intelligence to put the pieces together to discover the source and power of the evil entity behind the supernatural. A convoluted sentence to be sure, but it properly outlines the struts of the horror behind the mirrors.Just as in real life, we often do not get information in an orderly manner in a movie. We get bits and pieces which we must order into a reasonable explanation of what is not explainable. So it is with ""Mirrors."" Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) is the connected character, the one with the job in the burned out hull of a previous luxurious department store. Kiefer replaced the previous night-watchman, who appears in the first scene and is destroyed by horrific forces behind the mirrors. That's what I mean by displaced order. What one has to do with the other is the viewer's task to figure out, even as Kiefer does.The first 30 minutes are slow, even with grotesque violence, but as in any powerful horror movie, the effects must accrue into unbearable suspense. Kiefer exhibits a wonderful mix between crippling fear and strict determination to conquer what's behind the mirrors. His years as a NYPD detective pan out in obtaining information and evidence in tracking the source of the evil.Every mind-bending revelation of the story of the mirrors adds to the horror. He discovers that a  state hospital for the insane was the original occupant of the site where the burned out department store stands. Experimental testing with mirrors caused the original troubles.Suffice it to say that Kiefer must find that testing subject before he can save his family. Save them from what? You may not want to know!""Mirrors"" is a complex film which requires complex reflection (pardon the pun) to appreciate the tangled plot threads of the story. Special recognition goes to the young actor who plays Kiefer's son for his creepy scene toward the end. He had my attention! The weak link is Paula Patton, there just to be a haridan and to overact.The final scene elicits the greatest terror of all. Again, the viewer must be responsible and competent in paying attention to all the details. If he or she does, ""Mirrors"" is a very rewarding, if horrific viewing experience.

The old lady near the end and Amy Smart were the best, believe it or not. It was just VERY hard to care about ANYONE in this movie.Back to the plot...there were like 3. Its like they couldn't decide where to take it, so they took it EVERYWHERE. Why not just decide on ONE plot and ONE story and try to make it really great? I guess that would be too easy. They've thrown in so much, I almost forgot what I was watching. It was so choppy and uneven and it had NO flow. The ""twist"" ending (which is apparently identical to the original korean film) could have been good, but they did nothing to offer ANY explanation as to why or how it happened...it just created another plot hole, therefore, it didn't work at all. There were a few things I did enjoy, a few of the effects with the mirrors were pretty cool...just a FEW...most were terrible and cheesy. Very bad CGI.I can't say that I'm too surprised given that this was done by the same guy who did High Tension (which could have been great without ALL the ridiculous plot holes and horrid ending) and The Hills Have Eyes remake (which was just awful in general. WAY too over the top and just a bad, ugly, gritty movie). Given that, Mirrors just never had a chance. Its no wonder to me why it seemed to just pop up out of nowhere, it wasn't screened for critics (which is SUCH a bad sign), and I strongly believe that if they hadn't found a decent, subtle, creepy way to market this movie...it would have gone directly to DVD. It should have.Overall, I think this movie probably started off as a really great idea...as do all remakes of asian horror films, but, like all those other films...it went VERY wrong. Mostly because the writers seemed to have no self control. Everything but the kitchen sink, right?I saw 3 people I knew as I was walking out of the theatre and I convinced them to see something else.I suggest you all do the same.",1,What were they thinking?!,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2964,"['First', 'just', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'BAFFLED', 'positive', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'people', 'drugs', 'was', 'SO', 'excited', 'see', 'looked', 'really', 'great', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'want', 'damn', 'money', 'back', 'started', 'off', 'good', 'enough', 'first', 'half', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'went', 'totally', 'down', 'hill', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', ""'d"", 'left', 'alone', 'stopped', 'trying', 'add', 'different', 'back', 'stories', 'were', 'REALLY', 'unnecessary', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', '3', '4', 'different', 'movies', 'once', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'plot', 'scenes', 'where', 'lead', 'Pennsylvania', 'almost', 'lost', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'how', 'awful', '2', '3', 'scenes', 'were', 'EVERY', 'level', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'overall', 'things', 'happened', 'scenes', 'RIDICULOUS', 'unrealistic.And', 'acting', 'acting', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'everyone', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'far', 'one', 'worst', 'actresses', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'allowed', 'speak', 'EVER', 'Even', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'lead', 'did', 'pretty', 'horrific', 'job', 'old', 'lady', 'end', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'were', 'best', 'believe', 'not', 'was', 'just', 'VERY', 'hard', 'care', 'ANYONE', 'movie.Back', 'plot', 'were', '3', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'where', 'take', 'took', 'EVERYWHERE', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'decide', 'ONE', 'plot', 'ONE', 'story', 'try', 'make', 'really', 'great', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', ""'ve"", 'thrown', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'forgot', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'so', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'had', 'NO', 'flow', 'twist', 'ending', 'apparently', 'identical', 'original', 'korean', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'did', 'nothing', 'offer', 'ANY', 'explanation', 'why', 'how', 'happened', 'just', 'created', 'plot', 'hole', 'therefore', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'enjoy', 'few', 'effects', 'mirrors', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'just', 'FEW', 'most', 'were', 'terrible', 'cheesy', 'Very', 'bad', 'CGI.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'too', 'surprised', 'given', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'High', 'Tension', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'holes', 'horrid', 'ending', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remake', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'general', 'WAY', 'too', 'top', 'just', 'bad', 'ugly', 'gritty', 'movie', 'Given', 'Mirrors', 'just', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'wonder', 'why', 'seemed', 'just', 'pop', 'up', 'nowhere', 'was', ""n't"", 'screened', 'critics', 'bad', 'sign', 'strongly', 'believe', 'had', ""n't"", 'found', 'decent', 'subtle', 'creepy', 'way', 'market', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'directly', 'DVD', 'should', 'have.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'probably', 'started', 'off', 'really', 'great', 'idea', 'do', 'remakes', 'asian', 'horror', 'films', 'other', 'films', 'went', 'VERY', 'wrong', 'Mostly', 'writers', 'seemed', 'have', 'self', 'control', 'Everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'right', 'saw', '3', 'people', 'knew', 'was', 'walking', 'theatre', 'convinced', 'see', 'something', 'else.I', 'suggest', 'do', 'same']",Mirrors

This is how the story goes: It's been nearly a year since volatile detective Ben Carson was suspended from the NYPD for fatally shooting another undercover officer, an accident that not only cost him his job, but fueled the alcoholism and anger that has alienated his wife and kids and left him crashing on his sister's couch in Queens. Desperate to pull his life together, Carson takes a job as a night watchman at the burned-out ruins of the Mayflower department store, which was destroyed by a massive fire that devoured numerous innocent lives. As Carson patrols the eerie, charred remains of the store, he begins to notice something sinister about the ornate mirrors that adorn the Mayflower walls. Reflected in the gigantic shimmering glass are horrific images that stun Carson. Beyond projecting gruesome images of the past, the mirrors appear to be manipulating reality as well. When Carson sees his own reflection being tortured, he suffers the physical effects of his fractured visions. His sympathetic but skeptical sister Angela dismisses these bizarre ""nightmares"" as a consequence of his stress and guilt over the accidental shooting, but Carson's estranged wife Amy, a no-nonsense NYPD medical examiner, is less forgiving. Her husband's increasingly erratic behavior frightens her, pushing his family farther away--and, she fears, it's putting their children in danger. As Carson investigates the mysterious disappearance of a Mayflower security guard and its possible connection to his ghastly visions, he realizes that a malevolent, otherworldly force is using reflections as a gateway to terrorize him and his family. Carson must somehow uncover the truth behind the mirrors--and convince Amy to help him battle the greatest evil he has ever faced.The cast led by Kiefer Sutherland (as Ben Carson) is excellent!

1206462,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001JNNDC4,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","Keifer Sutherland has become a force to be reckoned with. Not only does he have one of the hottest shows on television in 24, he's made a series of films that have been hits as well. While his latest may not have broken records at the box office, it does offer some truly terrifying moments, something that is rarely seen in a world that prefers gore over scares in horror films. MIRR0RS may have a bit of well done special effects gore as well, but the story itself and the telling of it offer some truly scary moments.Sutherland stars as Ben Carson, a police detective down on his luck. Involved in a questionable shooting, he is on leave without pay. Drinking led to a separation with his wife and family. On medication, trying to get back on his feet, he takes a job as a night watchman in the burned out hulk of a building that once housed the biggest and best department store in the city.It seems that one of Ben's predecessors attempted to burn down the building a few years back, driven mad and killing his family prior to doing so. Now Ben steps into his shoes and those who followed, walking the halls of the blackened building making sure no one breaks in or damages it further.But something is strange here. Handprints on mirrors that seem to be everywhere in the building and visions of burning victims make Ben begin to question his sanity. Using the instincts honed by years on the force, he begins to investigate deeper into the building. The arrival of a package sent to him by the murdered previous night watchman leads Ben to look into the arsonist who burned down the building.The trail of clues gives Ben the sources that he needs to get to the bottom of things. But at the same time, the evil that resides in the building, in the mirrors, takes its toll. It murders Ben's sister in one of the most gruesome scenes found in recent years. And then it sets its sights on Ben's family, his ex-wife who thinks he's losing it and his two innocent children.As Ben races to find a solution to this puzzle, the evil in the mirrors gets closer and closer to his family. A discovery in the water filled basement of the building offers more clues, but time is not on Ben's side. With one way to put an end to the misery, Ben does all he can to save himself and his family.This movie works on so many levels. The mystery that finds Ben trying to find out what caused all of the happenings at this location is well thought out and believable in a horror film way. His dealing with his alcohol problem and trying to get his life together form an integral part of the story as well. And the family placed in jeopardy not because of his police work but because he lucked into the wrong job holds the viewer in suspense as well.The cast does a great job here. Sutherland shows torment and anguish well, working to cope with the most amazing scenes that play out before his eyes in the mirrors all around him. Underused is Amy Smart as his sister, offering solace and reaching a gory end. Paula Patton as wife Amy shows the biggest range going from shrill non-understanding wife to caring mother to supportive spouse all in one film.The effects are marvelous here. Not just the mirrors themselves that curve and poke when the evil is revealed but the gore effects are mind boggling. It's twisted but you can't seem to take your eyes off when Smart's death scene plays out. The sets for the store are magnificent and as much a part of the story as the rest.MIRRORS may not be for everyone. If you scare easily, tie yourself down while you watch. There are plenty of jump sequences and twists to give you nightmares of your own. The story unfolds well and the pacing makes you never look to see if you're close to the end yet. It's a well made horror film that offers scares. And that takes some doing in today's world.",4,REFLECTIONS OF HORROR,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,3821,"['Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'become', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'hottest', 'shows', 'television', '24', 'made', 'series', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'hits', 'as', 'well', 'latest', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'broken', 'records', 'box', 'office', 'offer', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'something', 'rarely', 'seen', 'world', 'prefers', 'gore', 'scares', 'horror', 'films', 'MIRR0RS', 'may', 'have', 'bit', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'telling', 'offer', 'truly', 'scary', 'moments.Sutherland', 'stars', 'Ben', 'Carson', 'police', 'detective', 'down', 'luck', 'Involved', 'questionable', 'shooting', 'leave', 'pay', 'Drinking', 'led', 'separation', 'wife', 'family', 'medication', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'job', 'night', 'watchman', 'burned', 'out', 'hulk', 'building', 'once', 'housed', 'biggest', 'best', 'department', 'store', 'city.It', 'one', 'Ben', 'predecessors', 'attempted', 'burn', 'down', 'building', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'driven', 'mad', 'killing', 'family', 'prior', 'doing', 'so', 'Now', 'Ben', 'steps', 'shoes', 'who', 'followed', 'walking', 'halls', 'blackened', 'building', 'making', 'sure', 'one', 'damages', 'further.But', 'something', 'strange', 'here', 'Handprints', 'mirrors', 'seem', 'be', 'everywhere', 'building', 'visions', 'burning', 'victims', 'make', 'Ben', 'begin', 'question', 'sanity', 'Using', 'instincts', 'honed', 'years', 'force', 'investigate', 'deeper', 'building', 'arrival', 'package', 'sent', 'murdered', 'previous', 'night', 'watchman', 'Ben', 'look', 'arsonist', 'who', 'burned', 'down', 'building.The', 'trail', 'clues', 'Ben', 'sources', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'evil', 'building', 'mirrors', 'toll', 'Ben', 'sister', 'one', 'most', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'found', 'recent', 'years', 'then', 'sights', 'Ben', 'family', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'losing', 'two', 'innocent', 'children.As', 'Ben', 'find', 'solution', 'puzzle', 'evil', 'mirrors', 'closer', 'closer', 'family', 'discovery', 'water', 'filled', 'basement', 'building', 'more', 'clues', 'time', 'not', 'Ben', 'side', 'one', 'way', 'put', 'end', 'misery', 'Ben', 'can', 'save', 'family.This', 'movie', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'mystery', 'Ben', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'caused', 'happenings', 'location', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'believable', 'horror', 'film', 'way', 'dealing', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'form', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'placed', 'jeopardy', 'not', 'police', 'work', 'lucked', 'wrong', 'job', 'viewer', 'suspense', 'well.The', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Sutherland', 'torment', 'anguish', 'well', 'working', 'cope', 'most', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'eyes', 'mirrors', 'Underused', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'sister', 'offering', 'solace', 'reaching', 'gory', 'end', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'wife', 'Amy', 'biggest', 'range', 'going', 'shrill', 'non-understanding', 'wife', 'caring', 'mother', 'supportive', 'spouse', 'one', 'film.The', 'effects', 'are', 'marvelous', 'here', 'Not', 'just', 'mirrors', 'curve', 'poke', 'when', 'evil', 'revealed', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'mind', 'boggling', 'twisted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'when', 'Smart', 'death', 'scene', 'out', 'sets', 'store', 'are', 'magnificent', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'story', 'rest.MIRRORS', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'scare', 'easily', 'tie', 'down', 'watch', 'are', 'plenty', 'jump', 'sequences', 'twists', 'give', 'nightmares', 'own', 'story', 'well', 'pacing', 'never', 'look', 'see', ""'re"", 'close', 'end', 'yet', 'well', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'scares', 'doing', 'today', 'world']",Mirrors

I picked it out knowing it was going to be a horror movie, but some of the scenes were just downright disturbing.Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben Carson, a suspended police officer who is taking a night job as a watchman for an abandoned department store.  The store is the Mayflower, a once grand place that was destroyed in a fire.  Before that it was a mental institution that specifically took in schizophrenics.  It is filled with large pristine  mirrors on every floor and they look out of place being in such a destroyed building.  He starts his night job thinking that it should be an easy job and hopefully get him back on the right track with his previous job and his family.It isn't long before he starts thinking he's seeing things in the mirrors that really aren't there.  Closed doors, people, burned images, he trys to shrug it off as a side effect from his medicine but after awhile cannot deny that something strange is going on.  He begins to research diligently trying to find out what is going on and what happened to his predecessor who had been found dead in the building shortly before Ben started working there.  He doesn't find anything definite though and the visions start getting worse and worse and his other senses start experiencing things as well.  He tells his sister, but this ends in tragedy and has him worried about his estranged family.  His wife and kids soon spiral into this mess with him and he must find out what the mirrors want before they destroy his whole family.At the risk of having spoilers in this review, I must tell you that the way his sister dies in this movie is utterly sickening.  I had to look away it was so gruesome.  While there are other horrific scenes,  this one by far is the worst.  Because of this, I definitely recommend younger children stay far far away from this movie.I do have to applaud the special effects in this movie.  They were very well done and unbelievably realistic.  With all the different horrors that the mirrors contain, it was interesting to see them on the tv screen coming to life before your eyes.  Some of the more gruesome scenes, despite being disgusting, definitely looked real as well.  There was some music in this film, but I don't really recall it to well so its safe to say its unmemorable.It was an ok movie I suppose, but I was also very unsatisfied with the ending.  It just seemed unfinished to me.  Definitely not a great movie for sure, but for anyone looking to get their horror fix, it would probably suffice.

1206474,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001JNNDC4,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[7, 11]","Ever since I caught wind of High Tension, anytime I see Alexandre Aja's name attached to something I look forward to it.  His remake of Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes was genuinely terrifying, and his script for P2 had potential, even though that film as a whole just didn't work out well.  Mirrors finds Aja helming another remake (this time of the 2003 South Korean film Into the Mirror), and stars Kiefer Sutherland as Ben Carson, an ex-cop trying to get back on his feet, and back into the good graces of his estranged wife (Paula Patton) while he stays with his sister (Amy Smart).  Taking a job as a night watchman of a partially destroyed department store, Ben soon learns of an evil force that is inhabiting the mirrors, and jeopardizing the lives of his family and himself.  Despite some genuinely shocking and gory moments (Amy Smart's scene in the bathtub is, and I just can't help the pun here, jaw-dropping), Mirrors as a whole is just too slow-moving and dull.  Not to mention that the bevy of plot holes, leaps in logic, and Sutherland's somewhat annoying performance don't help matters much here either.  Still though, Mirrors isn't a terrible horror flick my any stretch of the imagination, but it definitely doesn't do a director like Aja justice either.

That being said, it's a little bit better performed than most of your weekly multiplex scarefests.  That doesn't neccessarily mean it's a better movie overall.The movie follows ex-cop Ben, played by Sutherland, as a security guard for a burnt up department store/former hospital that is tied up in the courts because of insurance claims.  The setup follows standard issue horror films: It's night, it's lonely, it's haunted..by something in the mirrors.  The scenes in the store provide a good share of scares, and Sutherland isn't as dimwitted as typical horror protagonists.But aside from acting and some good scares, there's little else going on here. The story has a good setup, as we try to figure out why the mirrors are all haunted.  While the movie tries to serve up an answer, there seems to be holes in the explanation.  In an effort to create a shocking conclusion, the film makers settle for a weak puzzler of an ending that features a big visual goof that provides little closure.  I won't spoil it here, but will say that the ""shocking"" alternate ending doesn't help at all.Mirrors is a slightly better than average horror film, but it's still going through the motions.  Really, it's nothing more than an excuse to make mirrors seem scare, just as similar films have made basements, phones, and videos forever seem frightening.

It managed to send some good chills down my spine at least half a dozen times. The NY department store makes the perfect set for the freightening sequences that take place in it. The concept alone of a film production team making a film called 'Mirrors' seems totally crazy to even consider, because any camera man will tell you that shooting scenes where there are several mirror angles involved in the same room is always difficult to do without revieling the camera men and crew in the shot. Well this entire film is loaded with so many mirrors and reflective surfaces that it had to be an agonzing experience trying to work around them. I would have probably given this film 3 stars rather than 4, but because of the accomplishment of dealing with these mirrors, the excellent makeup effects, gloriously creepy moments, great sets, and great acting, I felt it deserved 4 stars(a close 3). Kiefer Sutherland(who I am a huge fan of) does in fact not only copy his Jack Bauer character, but he goes as far as to threaten a nun at gunpoint at a monastery to get her to comply. He also threatens torture with someone else to get results. And he reacts to anguishing moments identically to the way he did with his Jack Bauer character in the series 24. He sequences his face and crawls into a ball on the floor, he grabs his head in total pain and frustration while he has his gun in one hand. But because Kiefer is a master at showing deep intense anguish and pain in his character's face, so ""Kudos Kiefer"" I guess. However when he wasn't in his security guard uniform he actually wore the exact same clothes he wears in the 24 series. I mean exactly the same. Keifer looks great in these duds, so somehow I feel a little forgiving of that too. Really liked this film.",3,Jack Bauer takes on a demon!

1206483,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001JNNDC4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[14, 19]","Mirrors (Alexandre Aja, 2008)I was about forty minutes into the hundred-odd-minute Mirrors last night when my wife, who's down with bronchitis, took some cold medicine and went to bed. I considered turning the movie off and coming back to it today, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Why? Because I was seeing something I had never seen before--a good Alexandre Aja movie. No, seriously--a really good Alexandre Aja movie. (In my defense, when my wife takes cold medicine, twenty minutes later she has no idea whether I'm in bed with her or not. ""Comatose"" is a valid description.) I was expecting yet another stupid Hollywood remake (and with Alexandre Aja having helmed the epitome of the stupid Hollywood remake, the 2006 version of The Hills Have Eyes, I felt entirely justified in this). For the record, I have yet to see the film upon which this is based, the 2003 Korean project Into the Mirror, and maybe that changed my perception a bit. But oh, yes, I was completely immersed in this.And then we got to the last five minutes. And that Nike I was waiting for clonked me in the back of the head, except by then I wasn't expecting it. Ever since I finished watching the silly thing, I've been trying to spin the ending a different way. Me, of all people, trying to figure out how to defend a film by a guy who, up until now, hadn't even figured out how to direct a good short! (I generally don't review shorts, only rate them; I caught his first project, Over the Rainbow, earlier this year. It got two stars mostly for its brevity.) I think this is a sign of the apocalypse.In any case, the plot concerns an ex-cop named Ben Carson (Dark City's Kiefer Sutherland--who, let's face it, hasn't done a good film since the beginning of 24). Ben left the force after an incident that messed with his head enough that he fell into the bottom of a bottle, resulting in the breakup of his marriage (he's now sleeping on the couch of his sister Angela, played by Crank's Amy Smart) and a period of jobless wandering through a self-tortured life. He's started picking up the pieces, though, and newly sober, gets a job as a night watchman at a department store that burned down five years ago. (We're told that it's still being patrolled because the company is still tied up in a legal battle with the insurance company.) All well and good, except that ghostly goings-on begin his first night. He quickly finds out that every night watchman in the place, including the guy who originally burned the place to the ground, has had the same problems. You see, there's something wrong with the department store's mirrors. (This is not a spoiler; we find this out in the refreshingly gory opening scene.) Needless to say, whenever he tries to explain the mirror problem--to Angela, for example, or to his ex Amy (Precious' Paula Patton)--they look at him like he's nuts. How to convince them he's not before something unspeakable happens? And what do the things in the mirror want, anyway?It's always been the case that the decent American remakes, or even the mediocre ones that still somehow manage to be worth watching (Verbinski's The Ring, for example, or Scorsese's The Departed), are based on top-notch flicks. Not to say there haven't been awful American remakes (did you see Bangkok Dangerous? No? Stay that way.), but the good ones? Yeah. So I'm guessing that Sung-ho Kim's original Geoul Sokeuro is a real barnburner, because the first hundred minutes of this movie are, at least for Alexandre Aja, absolute genius. The whole thing is about character and atmosphere. It is, in fact, the second (that I know of) Asian-horror-flick remake to actually get that bit right, and as a result, the film shines. Some of the criticism leveled at the movie has had to do with some bad acting by supporting players, and this is true, but none of the supporting players here gets a whole lot of screen time; this is Kiefer Sutherland's movie, and he carries it. (Some of the other criticisms say he's just reprising his Jack Bauer role. I've never seen 24, so I can't comment on that, but if so, I can see why the show's a hit.) The atmosphere is tense, and more importantly it's believable enough to let the viewer swallow enough disbelief to actually buy the rather ridiculous premise.And then the final five minutes. Intellectually, I know I shouldn't hate them as much as I did. The ending probably even works in the original (though some of the things I've read lead me to believe the ending has been changed). And for the record, the final shot really is set up nicely all the way through the movie, and if you take it by itself, it's creepy and effective. But my god, the plot hole that gets blown through this movie in the final two scenes is unforgivable--especially because those scenes are right next to one another. It was as if Aja and his longtime writing partner Gregory Levasseur said ""hey, we need one of those endings that sets up for a sequel (ed. note: which is in the process of being filmed as we speak, of course), who cares if it makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film?"". And that's exactly what we got.I wanted to love this movie. And had I turned it off five minutes before the end, I probably would have. ***",3,So good until those final minutes.,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,5242,"['Mirrors', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', '2008', 'was',

It does deliver a few genuine scares, including one really shocking scene involving a woman, naturally, in a bathtub. (It's amazing that any of us ever bathes or goes in a basement, considering the lessons of horror movies.)However, the hauntings in this movie are a completely implausible muddle. It's no use trying to figure out exactly how, why, or where the avenging entity appears as it does.Also, the movie doesn't take advantage of its own projected setting. The epicenter of the haunting is supposed to be an old, burned-out department store. There's no accompanying commentary on the disc, so I don't know where these scenes were actually shot. However, most aspects of the store look like extravagant, unconvincing computer generations. If some actual abandoned building could have been found as location, the movie would have had much more atmosphere. This sort of film cries out for its location to become another character in the unfolding action - just as the old, abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts became such a portentous character in the thriller ""Session 9.""This film does try to capitalize on the inherent eeriness of mirrors, and on the suspicion many of us fleetingly entertain - that the reflection we see in the mirror has a life of its own. Again though, ""Mirrors"" ends up with less by doing more. There have been a few movies and TV episodes that played on this concept, but that featured reflections that moved just subtly out of synch with their fleshly counterparts. Just this shade of lag time made the reflections truly riveting and unnerving. However, here the reflections go off on radically different tangents. The obviousness of the mayhem they are going to launch detracts from the suspense.So ""Mirrors"" suffers from too many demonic manifestations that are too flagrant and ubiquitous.

Again this movie falls into the unfortunate chasm of movies that only made it the theater for three days.  The only saving grace is that this flick (and other short lived films in theaters) made it to DVD.""Mirrors"" has a very low budget/B movie/independent film feel to it.  This movie was made in 2008 and stars Kiefer Sutherland.  Kiefer has regained his success (and career) with the television program ""24"" (which is a great show).  It appears that ""Mirrors"" was made during the off season of ""24"".  The only reason I note ""24"" is because Kiefer plays Jack Bauer on this show and in ""Mirrors"" he plays a character named Ben Carson.  I must admit that I found some similarities between both of these characters, this isn't a bad thing.Ben Carson is a police officer who has been suspended for reasons that aren't totally explained, all we know is he killed a person.  As a result of this suspension his marriage is falling apart and he has temporally moved in with his sister (played by Amy Smart).  In addition Ben is grappling with a drinking problem and some anxiety/depression.  In the wake of all these cumbersome issues Ben takes a job as a night security guard at a mall that was recently condemned.  This mall was knighted with condemnation because it caught fire and almost burnt to the ground.During Ben's nightly routine at the mall he starts seeing strange things in the mirrors.  Are this things spirits, hallucinations, apparitions or projections of Ben's inner demons? Consequently, Ben's witnessing of horrible things in the mirrors promotes a level of foreshadowing to what might happen to Ben and people that he cares about.  Needless to say Ben is slowly pushed into the realm of madness as he struggles to convince himself and his love ones that some evil is transpiring.The movie takes some interesting twists and turns, both supernatural and psychologically.  This induces a build up to a climax that strongly reminds me of Dario Argento's 1980 filmInferno.  I only watched the ""unrated"" version and found it creepy but a little winded.  In other words, this movie could have shaved off about ten minutes and it wouldn't have bothered me.  The movie had a couple of cheesy moments but it didn't ruin the film for me.  I found that Kiefer provided a solid performance as a ""burn out"" on a path of self redemption.If you are looking for a creepy movie that is different than you average ""slasher flick"" than ""Mirrors"" is a good choice.  My only suggestion is turn your brain off a bit, because if a person starts to really dissect what they are seeing there going to find some discrepancies.

The problem here is that as this plays out, Keifer Sutherland's character finds that the mirrors in the place being to talk to him and begin to show him things, burning things, and ask for a singular word.and if history is to be taken seriously, those who do not find out the origins of this word end up with dead families, horrible lives, and broken everything elses.Mirrors had some really great stuff in it, and I found myself drawn to the movie. whether we were dealing with the movie and the turns it takes, the therapy that comes as part of the plot, or the mirrors and what they want, there is always something to be seen.

Ben, still traumatized by one tragic accident, starts to see weird things there at midnight. And those things have something to do with mirrors that still remain in this dilapidated building.The story of ""Mirrors"" may be based on a Korean film made in 2003 named ""Geoul sokeuro"" (which I haven't seen), but the thriller's touch is definitely that of Alexandre Aja, known for his ""High Tension"" and the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes."" Remember that his latest film as director includes more than one gruesome (and gory) death and some disturbing images.Unfortunately it seems Alexandre Aja is not interested in other parts of the film. Though the images of the run-down New York department store and its interiors (actually shot in Romania) are very spooky, ""Mirrors"" relies on a familiar tactic to scare you such as sudden big noises. Yes, I jumped in the seat several times, I admit, but this is not exactly what I had expected form the one who directed ""High Tension.""I am not perfectly sure that ""Mirrors"" was really the right choice for the director. The mysteries surrounding the mirrors and the strange visions Ben has are not very interesting. In fact Ben doesn't have to think much to get the answer. Besides, the film shows only half-hearted effort in its protagonist's character in spite of Kiefer Sutherland's energetic acting.

If you're considering renting or purchasing this movie, what follows is just one person's opinion.Impressive production design doesn't necessarily make for a successful movie. Case in point: MIRRORS. Where do I begin? Incredibly amateur dialogue, especially the howlingly unrealistic exposition. It sounds like a first draft, not a finished film script. Capable actors do their best with it but one wonders how they were directed. HUGE plot holes where logic flies out the window to serve getting the hero from point A to point B. Why go on and on about how a character is a fallen cop and then allow him access to all this police information? This convenience reaches new depths in the last half hour of the movie, with its far-from-unique possession cliche's.After watching a film like this, I wonder why the people behind it didn't just make a video game. Why bother with plot and characters if they're going to be so unbelievable? Have your cool, scary images and leave it at that.There are some promising ideas here and there. AND some different takes on themes which have been explored in other films. A few ""every parent's nightmare"" parts would've been more effective if the film was a bit more grounded in believability.I wanted to like MIRRORS. I'd read some good reviews.

1206508,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001JNNDC4,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 2]","Produced by Korean filmmaker Eun Young-Kim and directed by Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension), ""MIRRORS"" isn't exactly an official remake of the South Korean horror film ""Into the Mirror"" (aka. Geoul Sakeuro, 2003, directed by Sung-Ho Kim) but it does have pretty strong similarities (most specially the opening credits) since it is based on the Asian horror film. The ""Americanization"" of Asian Horror films are usually a miss more than a hit--with Aja at the helm as director, Eastern subtlety, slow suggestive, methodical creepiness is replaced by aggressive, grand displays of special effects--such a show-off approach does improve on the original when it comes to pace but doesn't necessarily make it a better film.Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland, ""24"") is a problematic ex-cop, he has a estranged relationship with his wife, Amy (sexy Paula Patton), has two kids and he is bunking with his baby sister Angela (sexy Amy Smart) until he gets back on his feet. Ben gets a job as a watchman in a burnt out department store called ""Mayflower"". Strangely, the burnt out store has unusually well-preserved mirrors--there is something sinister about them. When your reflection dies in the mirror, then you suffer the same fate. Demons from the past want something from everyone who had ever taken the job as night watchman--now, Ben must get to the bottom of the mystery of ""Esseker"", before it is too late to save himself and his family....With Alexandre Aja at the helm as director, then the expectations from horror fans will be expectedly a little high. I suppose the best way to approach ""Mirrors"" is by lowering your expectations. Aja cleverly only keeps the opening act, the climax, and the main premise from ""Into the Mirror"". This U.S. unrated version is more visceral and does have more blood and gore than the original. ""Into the Mirror"" does have a relevant social commentary that added some essential ""meat"" to its plot. However, the original also does have quite a number of dull moments and too many missed opportunities, with a subplot that is totally underdeveloped. Aja's approach is kept simple, it approaches a more visceral and violent approach with more effective use of special effects. The computer-generated set designs in the American version is also a lot creepier than the brightly lit, newly re-opened store in the Korean version.The main premise of ""Mirrors"" and ""Into the Mirror"", you guessed it, are mirrors. There are legends involving mirrors as another walkthrough to an alternate world, and that mirrors can used to capture hidden ""demonic"" entities. This legend was partly touched on in the opening act of ""Constantine"" and this film further expends on this premise. The plot also hits on some medical theories about schizophrenia and demonic possession. The laws of the ""mirrors"" may not be totally defined or fleshed out in this film but it does provide a good idea for a scary experience.The problems with ""Mirrors"" begin with the script and the dialogue. Considering the assumed limits of Aja's English knowledge, the dialogue is pretty much obligatory and very dry. Also, the part with Ben's estranged relationship with his wife Amy is too perfunctory. I'm not sure, Sutherland managed to express some emotions but the style is too similar to his ""Jack Bauer"" portrayal that makes the ""meant to be"" scary scenes a little funny with a predictable climax after the encounter with the nightmarish ghoul. I really felt as if Aja meant for it to be this way but ended up hampering the film a little. The family tension also overstays its welcome after awhile and  Ben`s trip to the backwoods was too formulaic and too reminiscent of Asian horror films. I rather thought that the powerful social criticism and the subtle doses of satire in the Korean version may have assisted the film's screenplay.Despite the uninspired script, the film is competently directed. I was impressed as to how Aja managed the shots, I would imagine that it would be a little difficult to shoot a film with a lot of mirrors (thank goodness for CGI) and Aja's set designs were creepy enough. The set ups for the gore scenes were well-directed and the film does have its share of unsettling images. The film's greatest strengths will have to be the opening scene, the one with mangled jaw, the flashbacks with a young Anna Esseker and Ben's first night in the burnt out building; accompanied by an ominous score by Javier Navarrete, the film does have its suspenseful moments.""Mirrors"" is a more decent attempt at an Asian horror re-imagining despite its many flaws and the weaknesses of the script. I was just disappointed that the mythos of the mirrors themselves and of doppelgangers weren't more efficiently explored and settled to just become one more ""visually inspired"" horror experience. The climax is also very predictable. ""Mirrors"" is perfectly watchable although it is definitely forgettable and wouldn't stand out.Recommended with caution to horror maniacs, but a RENTAL to experienced viewers.

A must see of any horror fan. Best of all it is a (A) movie so it doesn't need a lot of usless nudity to fill in the gaps in the plot.

1206510,A363FNQAAUNKN0,B001JNNDC4,Xmortis,"[3, 6]","The worst picture quality of any blu-ray I own. Please buy the standard issue DVD, or rent the Blu-ray version of this film.This is a complete remake of a Korean film. A retired cop takes a night watchman job in a burnt out department store. The mirrors in the store are not what they seem. A creepy, well done horror film with some good scares.After getting over all the static in the darker scenes, I really enjoyed the film. The acting is fantastic, I am impressed by the entire cast. Even the children interact with the supernatural in a very real and believable way. The make up, set design and score(*) all work to enhance the story.* (be sure to have your audio remote in hand...the score and audio effects are much louder than speech)The effects were excellent save for 2 very brief cg fire shots. Some entertaining extras including a fun and informative commentary gave me many hours of entertainment. The pip picture quality of the extras is absolutely crisp oddly enough. It would get 4 stars at least if the image quality were better.I recommend the movie, but don't think spending extra for the Blu-ray is a good idea.",2,Poor picture quality.
