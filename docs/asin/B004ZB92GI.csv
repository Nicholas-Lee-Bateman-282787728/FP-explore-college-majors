I found this dvd to be slightly more advanced than GIVE ME 10.  It's a fast paced, intense workout.  I recommend working through it segment by segment, and pausing when necessary.

1434486,A2QYRPXD3421B9,B004ZB92GI,Anthrochoirgirl,"[2, 2]","I love Amy Dixon's workout videos and own all of them. One of the reasons I like her so much is her great cues of what's coming up without losing your place. This video starts out much faster than her other (earlier) ones and doesn't give a very long warm-up. She uses moves that are similar to, but different from other videos and is moving through them faster as well. I still enjoy this video but would not recommend it for beginners or people who need more time to see an learn the next move, or get ""lost"" easily. It was a good workout combining strength and cardio although I felt it was more focused on the strength training. I'd recommend it for Amy fans who are used to her other workouts and can adapt quickly.",3,Another Great Amy Dixon Video- NOT for Beginners!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,720,"['love', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'workout', 'videos', 'own', 'One', 'reasons', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'cues', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'losing', 'place', 'video', 'out', 'much', 'faster', 'other', 'earlier', 'ones', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'long', 'warm-up', 'moves', 'are', 'similar', 'different', 'other', 'videos', 'moving', 'faster', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'enjoy', 'video', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'more', 'time', 'see', 'learn', 'next', 'move', 'get', 'lost', 'easily', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'combining', 'strength', 'cardio', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'strength', 'training', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Amy', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'other', 'workouts', 'can', 'adapt', 'quickly']",Give Me 10 More!
1434487,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B004ZB92GI,Feles31,"[6, 12]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.This cardio workout was tough enough to keep my heart rate in the zone without straining to keep up.  Music was good with a strong beat, instructor was decent, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying.  Could really use a music only option since the instructor never stops talking and I can already tell that, with repeated viewings, I will only get annoyed with that much repeated chatter.I felt the cardio choreography was more complex and awkward than it needed to be --- was there really that much more benefit from lunging in so many different directions with different arm movements sequentially?  Or doing skip-gallops instead of jumps or jogging?  I give the instructor credit for trying to keep things fresh with new moves (both the move itself and frequent move changes.)  That said, it is tricky to come up with new moves and new sequences of moves that make sense and flow well and this just did not do it for me.  While I was able to follow, I had to think twice as hard and did not feel like the result was worth that much more brain power expended.Despite giving me the workout level that I am after (which is getting harder and harder to find since I have been collecting workout DVDs for a while now), after doing this workout twice, I have decided it is just not a keeper for me.",3,good but not great,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1340,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.This', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', 'tough', 'enough', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'zone', 'straining', 'keep', 'up', 'Music', 'was', 'good', 'strong', 'beat', 'instructor', 'was', 'decent', 'backup', 'dancers', 'non-annoying', 'Could', 'really', 'use', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'instructor', 'never', 'talking', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'annoyed', 'much', 'repeated', 'chatter.I', 'felt', 'cardio', 'choreography', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'awkward', 'needed', 'be', 'was', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'benefit', 'lunging', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'different', 'arm', 'movements', 'sequentially', 'doing', 'skip-gallops', 'instead', 'jumps', 'jogging', 'give', 'instructor', 'credit', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh', 'new', 'moves', 'move', 'frequent', 'move', 'changes', 'said', 'tricky', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'moves', 'new', 'sequences', 'moves', 'make', 'sense', 'flow', 'well', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'had', 'think', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'result', 'was', 'worth', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'brain', 'power', 'expended.Despite', 'giving', 'workout', 'level', 'am', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'have', 'been', 'collecting', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'while', 'now', 'doing', 'workout', 'twice', 'have', 'decided', 'just', 'not', 'keeper']",Give Me 10 More!
