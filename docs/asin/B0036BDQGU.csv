Nicely done on that. I also found the first half of the story pretty exciting with car chases, running through corridors,stealing a flying saucer, and even running from aliens in a mine. The doctor remains a strong moral character throughout..I also appreciated the romance between an alien husband and wife couple.On the downside, I think the story loses a little momentum towards the end, and the story does show itself a tad naive on the Cold War, with Colonel Stark only slightly less crazy than General Cutler from the First Doctor story, &#34;The Tenth Planet.&#34;Overall,  this is a good Doctor Who story. It'll make no one's top Ten list, but it's worth viewing particularly if you enjoyed David Tennant's Doctor.",4,There's plenty to recommend the story beginning with the absolutely stunning animation which ...,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1008,"['adventure', 'Doctor', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'involved', 'mystery', 'dark', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'alien', 'bug', 'monsters', 'even', 'bit', 'romance.There', 'plenty', 'recommend', 'story', 'beginning', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'animation', 'everything', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'Nicely', 'done', 'also', 'found', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'car', 'chases', 'running', 'corridors', 'stealing', 'flying', 'saucer', 'even', 'running', 'aliens', 'mine', 'doctor', 'strong', 'moral', 'character', 'throughout..I', 'also', 'appreciated', 'romance', 'alien', 'husband', 'wife', 'couple.On', 'downside', 'think', 'story', 'little', 'momentum', 'end', 'story', 'show', 'tad', 'naive', 'Cold', 'War', 'Colonel', 'Stark', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'crazy', 'General', 'Cutler', 'First', 'Doctor', 'story', '34', 'Tenth', 'Planet.', '34', 'Overall', 'good', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', ""'ll"", 'make', 'one', 'top', 'Ten', 'list', 'worth', 'viewing', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Doctor']",N/A

One starAction and animation however were sorely lacking I wouldn't even call it video game animation, video game animation is much better.  It was computer animated, I think.  You could see what looked like brushstrokes or lines from colored pencils, animation didn't line up properly (he puts his hand over her mouth to quiet her and his open hand barely touches her mouth at all) the action was jerky, and if you see their feet it looks like they are doing the moon walk fowards (feet moving so much more than the background, feet appear to be sliding backward half the time)  So, three stars, it would have been better live action, or if they had gone really out there since it's animated.  I mean come one, why stick to such simplistic animation.  Mostly humans with two alien species, either of which would have looked better on the actual show.

1327587,AV4645DYR9KUL,B0036BDQGU,Kyle N.,"[0, 0]","Following somewhat in the vain of the previous Doctor Who animated special, ""The Infinity Quest"", ""Dreamland"" is a series of animated pieces that aired on BBC's Red Button service, with the whole forming what can amount to a special episode of Doctor Who, albeit one that is animated and not really considered a part of the main television stories or the 2009 Specials, which this aired in the middle of. Due to this lack of truly being a part of the television stories, ""Dreamland"" is not really a high-end production, and shouldn't be seen as such. It may be enjoyed by some fans of the series, but on its own merits, it doesn't really compare to the actual episodes of the show.In a little adventure that takes place after the excellent ""The Waters of Mars"" special, the Doctor finds himself in 1958 Dry Springs, Nevada. He meets a diner waitress named Cassie Rice (Georgia Moffat) and her friend Jimmy Stalkingwolf (Tim Howar), who have an alien artifact in their possession. Soon, agents from Area 51 arrive and the three are embroiled in a strange set of machinations going on inside the base.On its own, ""Dreamland"" is really not that special, and even as part of the Doctor Who franchise, it doesn't really live up to the standards of regular episodes. The premise of the Doctor visiting Area 51 is a fun premise and one any fan of the show will appreciate. However, the plot here isn't all that great. The villains are typical fanfare and really not that interesting, having all the usual villain clich&eacute;s. The characters aren't all that interesting, either, with none of them getting much development as this slightly convoluted story moves along. It's a shame that the narrative took much more of a focus than the characters did, because they are what often makes the series so enjoyable and heartwarming. The acting doesn't help, either. With the sole exception of the always excellent David Tennant, all of the actors in ""Dreamland"" give stilted and emotionless performances, probably because their characters don't really get much room to develop, either, despite the fact that all of these parts do equal the length of a whole episode of Doctor Who.The worst part, however, is the animation. Rather than using the animation style of ""The Infinity Quest"", this time a CG animation is used, creating 3D character models. The problem is, all of these character models are rigid and bland. Characters' faces don't really get the chance to show much emotion, and movement is so stiff and rigid it becomes painful to watch. You may get used to it, but that doesn't really make it any better.Overall, ""Dreamland"" isn't very good. The plot, even if it doesn't live up to the potential of a regular episode, does hit some decent themes that fit right in with the series, and the premise alone might warrant some to give it a try. However, uninteresting characters and awful animation really prevent this from living up to the high standards of the show.",2,A disappointing and unenjoyable adventure.,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2965,"['Following', 'somewhat', 'vain', 'previous', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'animated', 'special', 'Infinity', 'Quest', 'Dreamland', 'series', 'animated', 'pieces', 'aired', 'BBC', 'Red', 'Button', 'service', 'whole', 'forming', 'what', 'can', 'amount', 'special', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'one', 'animated', 'not', 'really', 'considered', 'part', 'main', 'television', 'stories', '2009', 'Specials', 'aired', 'middle', 'Due', 'lack', 'truly', 'being', 'part', 'television', 'stories', 'Dreamland', 'not', 'really', 'high-end', 'production', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'series', 'own', 'merits', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'actual', 'episodes', 'show.In', 'little', 'adventure', 'place', 'excellent', 'Waters', 'Mars', 'special', 'Doctor', '1958', 'Dry', 'Springs', 'Nevada', 'diner', 'waitress', 'named', 'Cassie', 'Rice', 'Georgia', 'Moffat', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'Stalkingwolf', 'Tim', 'Howar', 'who', 'have', 'alien', 'artifact', 'possession', 'Soon', 'agents', 'Area', '51', 'arrive', 'three', 'are', 'embroiled', 'strange', 'set', 'machinations', 'going', 'base.On', 'own', 'Dreamland', 'really', 'not', 'special', 'even', 'part', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'regular', 'episodes', 'premise', 'Doctor', 'visiting', 'Area', '51', 'fun', 'premise', 'one', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'appreciate', 'However', 'plot', 'here', ""n't"", 'great', 'villains', 'are', 'typical', 'fanfare', 'really', 'not', 'interesting', 'having', 'usual', 'villain', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'either', 'none', 'getting', 'much', 'development', 'slightly', 'convoluted', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'shame', 'narrative', 'took', 'much', 'more', 'focus', 'characters', 'did', 'are', 'what', 'often', 'series', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'heartwarming', 'acting', ""n't"", 'help', 'sole', 'exception', 'always', 'excellent', 'David', 'Tennant', 'actors', 'Dreamland', 'give', 'stilted', 'emotionless', 'performances', 'probably', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'much', 'room', 'develop', 'either', 'fact', 'parts', 'do', 'equal', 'length', 'whole', 'episode', 'Doctor', 'Who.The', 'worst', 'part', 'however', 'animation', 'Rather', 'using', 'animation', 'style', 'Infinity', 'Quest', 'time', 'CG', 'animation', 'used', 'creating', '3D', 'character', 'models', 'problem', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'rigid', 'bland', 'Characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'show', 'much', 'emotion', 'movement', 'so', 'stiff', 'rigid', 'painful', 'watch', 'may', 'get', 'used', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'better.Overall', 'Dreamland', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'even', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'regular', 'episode', 'hit', 'decent', 'themes', 'fit', 'right', 'series', 'premise', 'alone', 'might', 'warrant', 'give', 'try', 'However', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'awful', 'animation', 'really', 'prevent', 'living', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'show']",N/A
