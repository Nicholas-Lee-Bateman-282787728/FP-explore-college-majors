568699,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000056BOU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 24]","This was a very disappointing comedy show.  It wasn't even so much the profanity or vulgar scenarios that they were discussing that bothered me (because I love Chris Rock's work so much), but instead it was more the way that these four men presented themselves and represented themselves on stage.  The self-proclaimed ringleader of them all, Steve Harvey, was the worst.  The fact that he didn't even have enough material to survive on stage was pathetic enough.  That set the tone for the rest of the film that was not a positive tone.  His cheap monologue was filled with community insults and personal insults to the audience.  I know they may have been all in fun and jest, but to me it never really came across as fun.  Either Harvey was upset with the audience presented to him, or he just wasn't ready for his moment on stage, but it just came across as a completely different person than I was expecting.  The same can be said for all of them whom were somewhat more concerned about their image than the jokes that they were telling.I don't know why Lee chose this project to place his name on and why he proclaimed these four to be the ""Original Kings of Comedy.""  To me that is a bit misleading.  If he is speaking about African Americans being a part of comic culture, then I don't think these were the four to best represent it.  What about Eddie Murphy, Red Foxx, or even the great Richard Prior?  What about Bill Cosby?  There just seemed to be a self-proclaimed stigma already attached to this project before we even began it that was hurt with the opening of each of their mouths.  I was not impressed by any of them.  If I had one dollar to give to one of them for their performance from the evening, and was forced to hand it to one of them, it would have been Cedric the Entertainer.  He just seemed the most genuine of them all.  His performance on stage was honest, yet bold all at the same time.  He was talking to the audience, not above them, as the other performers seemed.  While I don't think he was the most liked in the audience, I did think that he was the most talented of them all.Another huge problem that I had with this film was the cut sequences.  You know, the moments that we spend talking to them off-stage about their lives and opportunity ahead.  This tries to give them a sense of humanity, showing the audience this different side to them than when they are on stage, but what I witnessed was something a bit scarier.  It seemed as if each was trying to grab the attention of the camera.  Were we dealing with a group of camera hogs that were willing to step on anyone to get to the next level?  Whether it is true or not, nothing is said to speak otherwise.  While these were created to show their brotherhood, it felt more like filler delaying the inevitable consequence that we were going to go back to a sub-par routine.  It was like a tease that hurt.Overall, I was not impressed.  I have seen some comedians take an opportunity like this and blow it out of the ballpark, but what I saw with this documentary were four men (possibly five if you count Spike) that just wanted the opportunity to showcase their talent.  They were not interested in the audience, or in trying to actually be funny, but instead just be on television.  Notice that most of them are doing well now after the release of this film, which means that something worked.  I just wish that they had put the same excitement behind their work in this film.  From utter confusion to just downright profanity (without a joke), these guys felt as if they were ""winging it"" instead of demonstrating to us the power of their trade.  I was embarrassed for everyone involved, even the people in the audience, but hope that others will see this review and take heed ... The Original Kings of Comedy is not worth the time or effort that you are going to put into it.  If they are not willing to work to make me laugh ... than why should I laugh?Grade: ** out of *****",2,We run when somebody else runs.,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,3975,"['was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'comedy', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'so', 'much', 'profanity', 'vulgar', 'scenarios', 'were', 'discussing', 'bothered', 'love', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'instead', 'was', 'more', 'way', 'four', 'men', 'presented', 'represented', 'stage', 'self-proclaimed', 'ringleader', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'was', 'worst', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'enough', 'material', 'survive', 'stage', 'was', 'pathetic', 'enough', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'positive', 'tone', 'cheap', 'monologue', 'was', 'filled', 'community', 'insults', 'personal', 'insults', 'audience', 'know', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'jest', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'fun', 'Harvey', 'was', 'upset', 'audience', 'presented', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'moment', 'stage', 'just', 'came', 'across', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'was', 'expecting', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'whom', 'were', 'somewhat', 'more', 'concerned', 'image', 'jokes', 'were', 'telling.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Lee', 'chose', 'project', 'place', 'name', 'why', 'proclaimed', 'four', 'be', 'Original', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'bit', 'misleading', 'speaking', 'African', 'Americans', 'being', 'part', 'comic', 'culture', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'four', 'best', 'represent', 'What', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Red', 'Foxx', 'even', 'great', 'Richard', 'Prior', 'What', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'self-proclaimed', 'stigma', 'already', 'attached', 'project', 'even', 'began', 'was', 'hurt', 'opening', 'mouths', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'had', 'one', 'dollar', 'give', 'one', 'performance', 'evening', 'was', 'forced', 'hand', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'just', 'seemed', 'most', 'genuine', 'performance', 'stage', 'was', 'honest', 'yet', 'bold', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'talking', 'audience', 'not', 'other', 'performers', 'seemed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'most', 'liked', 'audience', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'talented', 'all.Another', 'huge', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'sequences', 'know', 'moments', 'spend', 'talking', 'off-stage', 'lives', 'opportunity', 'ahead', 'give', 'sense', 'humanity', 'showing', 'audience', 'different', 'side', 'when', 'are', 'stage', 'what', 'witnessed', 'was', 'something', 'bit', 'scarier', 'seemed', 'was', 'trying', 'grab', 'attention', 'camera', 'Were', 'dealing', 'group', 'camera', 'hogs', 'were', 'willing', 'step', 'anyone', 'get', 'next', 'level', 'true', 'not', 'nothing', 'said', 'speak', 'otherwise', 'were', 'created', 'show', 'brotherhood', 'felt', 'more', 'filler', 'delaying', 'inevitable', 'consequence', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'back', 'sub-par', 'routine', 'was', 'tease', 'hurt.Overall', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'have', 'seen', 'comedians', 'take', 'opportunity', 'blow', 'ballpark', 'what', 'saw', 'documentary', 'were', 'four', 'men', 'possibly', 'five', 'count', 'Spike', 'just', 'wanted', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'talent', 'were', 'not', 'interested', 'audience', 'trying', 'actually', 'be', 'funny', 'instead', 'just', 'be', 'television', 'Notice', 'most', 'are', 'doing', 'well', 'now', 'release', 'film', 'something', 'worked', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'put', 'same', 'excitement', 'work', 'film', 'utter', 'confusion', 'just', 'downright', 'profanity', 'joke', 'guys', 'felt', 'were', 'winging', 'instead', 'demonstrating', 'power', 'trade', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'everyone', 'involved', 'even', 'people', 'audience', 'hope', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'review', 'take', 'heed', 'Original', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'not', 'time', 'effort', 'are', 'going', 'put', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'work', 'make', 'why', 'should', 'laugh', 'Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

Steve Harvey is the emcee, and he is joined by Cedric ""The Entertainer"", D.L. Hughley, and Bernie Mac. They each do an exceptional job of bringing their own comedic style to the stage, and I don't want to really go into the specifics because that would be giving away too much of the movie.So why didn't I give it five stars? Because there was one problem: part of D.L. Hughley's routine. Sure, his jokes were funny as ever, but we all know damn well that several of those jokes were the same jokes he told a year before (or a year later, depending on when this movie was taped) in his HBO special ""Going Home"". And I don't mean similar jokes, I mean EXACT jokes. Although the jokes are still funny, you can't help but ache for more new material. I've noticed that with a lot of black comedians. (I'm black too, so that's not a racist remark.) For example, several of Chris Rock's jokes from his HBO special ""Bigger &amp; Blacker"" were the same jokes given during his monologue when he hosted Saturday Night Live in 1996...minus the profanity, of course. I think that kind of pattern isn't good to follow.

D.L. Hughley was also a riot, even though he used some of his jokes before in other stand-up specials. Either he's not creative or I watch too much TV.

laugh a lot but the foul language on this dvd really prevented me from doing so. it may be because this dvd came out a very long time ago. it may have been a different time requiring different comedy tactics. it is true, after all, that audiences change over time.as for steve harvey who emcees the event and provides a few rather funny spots, i loved his whole church/""aunt flo"" routine as well as the spot on ""boogie."" you definitely have to watch it to appreciate it. steve harvey kept me laughing hysterically all the way through the routine and it still shines in my mind as one of the best comedy routines that i have ever listened to. steve harvey is totally enjoyable!also, my favorite out of the four comedy kings is cedric the entertainer. i especially love the parts on running, breaking and parking. his routine is totally hilarious aside from a few uses of foul language in the beginning of his act which, trust me, the church-going, southern charlotte, nc crowd did not appreciate too much either:)as for bernie mac, who is now deceased (i believe he passed away in 2008 due to complications from pneumonia), it was really great to see the ""Chicago man"" in action. it is so hard to believe that such a great talent is no longer with us. i loved his family-oriented bit on this dvd, especially when he delivers his ""comedic sermon"" on kids and milk and cookies. he was the first, i believe, to make fun of your own or any extended family ""daily living"" and ""child-rearing"" situations that tangle and involve both biological and surrogate parents and children. and, not only did bernic mac do so, but bernie did it tastefully and properly- getting an ""i know what you mean"" laugh out of it. he was so cute with his act and so down-right homestyle that it made you miss him even more. i mean this man started in his hometown of chicago and he spread like wildfire. i mean the man used to have the ""chicago bulls of the michael jordan years"" wrapped around his finger. bernie was a talent that respected talent and talent respected him in return.if you are a die hard steve harvey, cedric the entertainer or bernie mac fan i urge you to check this out first on ""you tube"" and then if you can get passed the horrible, indecent language then make your purchase. if not, just purchase it for your comedy collection to memorialize bernie mac. a talent that is

Much of the subject matter is not politically correct, but it's what most of us say or have heard said behind closed doors. Plus, it's just comedy and it's doesn't come across as mean-spirited. It's not highbrow, but it's certainly not sinister either.Though I see where some might have a problem with the language, I enjoyed most of the film and laughed throughout each comedian's set. Steve Harvey does a good job of pacing the show with his take-no-prisoners routines. Man, that whole bit about Rae Carruth was priceless. My other favorite part was at the end when each comedian explains which NBA player personifies his comedy style and Cedric compares himself to Latrell Sprewell.This concert film does a pretty good job of conveying each comedian's interaction with audience, which showed how much the audience enjoyed the show. The audience connected with Steve reminiscing about Ole School music, D.L.'s mean Big Mama ( we all had one), wishing like Cedric that someone would cross us, and wanting to whoop the tar out some some bad kid like Bernie Mack (figuratively speaking of course).On the whole, this was a worthwhile flick.

Hughley continues the show.He does routines about jobs,racism and what black people do for excitement.In""What Blacks Do For Excitement"",he says that blacks don't bungee jumpbecause it looks to much like lynching.That made me laugh a lot.He is more vulgar than Steve Harvey and Cedric The Entertainer,but not as vulgar as Bernie Mac.He is probably my second favorite on here.Cedric The Entertainer is next.His routine is divided into two parts,and neither of them are funny.He talks about the same thing that every black comedian has talked about:how black people are different from white people.He is probably the cleanest comic here.He is the reason why I didn't give this five stars.The best example of his work would be 'Starting Line Up'.Bernie Mac closes the show.He talks about why blacks use the ""F"" word,and why he doesn't like his sister's kids.His routine is definitely the longest,and definitely the most vulgar.His routine will probably offend A LOT of people.He is definitely my favorite.As you can see,this isn't exactly a clean show.There is enough swearing to make Richard Pryor blush.So if you have young children,DO NOT let them come close to this.Otherwise,sit back,pop some popcorn,and watch some good comedy!",4,A good movie!,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,1694,"['am', 'big', 'stand', 'up', 'freak.I', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'new', 'guys', 'try', 'out.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'white', 'black', 'Hispanic', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'way.I', 'decided', 'check', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedians.Here', 'review', 'comedian', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'show', 'off.He', 'routines', 'Titanic', 'music', 'going', 'church', 'LOT', 'swearing.He', 'probably', 'third', 'favorite', 'here.D.L', 'Hughley', 'show.He', 'routines', 'jobs', 'racism', 'what', 'black', 'people', 'do', 'excitement.In', 'What', 'Blacks', 'Do', 'Excitement', 'blacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'bungee', 'jumpbecause', 'much', 'lynching.That', 'made', 'lot.He', 'more', 'vulgar', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'not', 'as', 'vulgar', 'Bernie', 'Mac.He', 'probably', 'second', 'favorite', 'Entertainer', 'next.His', 'routine', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'funny.He', 'talks', 'same', 'thing', 'black', 'comedian', 'talked', 'how', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'white', 'people.He', 'probably', 'cleanest', 'comic', 'here.He', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars.The', 'best', 'example', 'work', 'would', 'be', ""'Starting"", 'Line', ""Up'.Bernie"", 'Mac', 'show.He', 'talks', 'why', 'blacks', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'why', ""n't"", 'like', 'sister', 'kids.His', 'routine', 'definitely', 'longest', 'definitely', 'most', 'vulgar.His', 'routine', 'will', 'probably', 'offend', 'LOT', 'people.He', 'definitely', 'favorite.As', 'can', 'see', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'clean', 'show.There', 'enough', 'swearing', 'make', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'blush.So', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'DO', 'NOT', 'let', 'come', 'close', 'this.Otherwise', 'sit', 'back', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'good', 'comedy']",N/A
568739,A1HAL6ZQ8MUJSD,B000056BOU,mr_bunghole,"[24, 27]","I'm going to start the review off with the obvious: this is not a movie, but rather a documentary on the Kings Of Comedy Tour.  In other words, a stand-up comedy film.  You're probably reading this and wondering &quot;why would anybody sell a collection of comedy skits as a full-length feature film?&quot;  See the movie and you'll understand.  While no doubt suited for television viewing (partly because they're all on BET), the experience in the theatre gives an overall impression of being there, actually watching Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac toss their routines live.  As for the performers themselves, some of them are downright hilarious - I particularly like Steve Harvey and, of course Bernie Mac - while DL Hughley is kinda so-so, spending most of the time talking about panties and dissing audience members.  But even the weaker performances survive because the performers are energetic and bristling with enthusiasm.  This ends up making the material seem a lot funnier than it really is.  I guarantee you'll find yourself laughing till you're crying over jokes that really aren't all that funny (like me as well as everyone else that was in the theatre).  DL Hughley is no doubt decent overall, and Cedric the Entertainer has his shining moments, although as a whole they aren't really anything special.  Emcee Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac, on the other hand, are awesome.  Steve Harvey's material is actually funny to begin with (I LOVE the Titanic bit at the beginning), but a lot of it is inspiring as well.  He manages to find humour in love, spirituality and family life without sounding blasphemous or disrespectful.  Most importantly, he means every single word he says, and that connects with the audience all too well when talking about romance and love.  As for Bernie Mac: THIS is the skit that makes the movie so good.  Without a doubt the star of the show, Bernie talks rudely about his kids and his unique parenting techniques, and pokes fun at other parents.  His subject matter can be a little risky, but he never comes through as disrespectful or snarky.  Whereas Steve Harvey delivers his skits with pure honesty, Mac's charm comes from the fact that its obvious that not a single word of it is true.  This allows him to explore territory that others may be afraid to.  As a whole, this movie is highly recommended if you love to laugh.  It is an entirely worthwhile way to kill two hours, and I can guarantee you'll leave the theatre (or television) with a gigantic smile on your face.",4,A refreshingly light-hearted experience,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,2553,"[""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'review', 'obvious', 'not', 'movie', 'rather', 'documentary', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'other', 'words', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'film', ""'re"", 'probably', 'reading', 'wondering', 'quot', 'why', 'would', 'anybody', 'sell', 'collection', 'comedy', 'skits', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'quot', 'See', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'doubt', 'suited', 'television', 'viewing', 'partly', ""'re"", 'BET', 'experience', 'theatre', 'overall', 'impression', 'being', 'there', 'actually', 'watching', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'DL', 'Hughley', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'routines', 'live', 'performers', 'are', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'particularly', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'course', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'DL', 'Hughley', 'kinda', 'so-so', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'talking', 'panties', 'dissing', 'audience', 'members', 'even', 'weaker', 'performances', 'survive', 'performers', 'are', 'energetic', 'bristling', 'enthusiasm', 'up', 'making', 'material', 'seem', 'lot', 'funnier', 'really', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'till', ""'re"", 'crying', 'over', 'jokes', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'theatre', 'DL', 'Hughley', 'doubt', 'decent', 'overall', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'shining', 'moments', 'whole', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'special', 'Emcee', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'awesome', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'material', 'actually', 'funny', 'begin', 'LOVE', 'Titanic', 'bit', 'beginning', 'lot', 'inspiring', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'humour', 'love', 'spirituality', 'family', 'life', 'sounding', 'blasphemous', 'disrespectful', 'Most', 'importantly', 'single', 'word', 'audience', 'too', 'well', 'when', 'talking', 'romance', 'love', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'THIS', 'skit', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'doubt', 'star', 'show', 'Bernie', 'rudely', 'kids', 'unique', 'parenting', 'techniques', 'fun', 'other', 'parents', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'risky', 'never', 'through', 'disrespectful', 'snarky', 'Whereas', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'skits', 'pure', 'honesty', 'Mac', 'charm', 'fact', 'obvious', 'not', 'single', 'word', 'true', 'explore', 'territory', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'afraid', 'whole', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'love', 'laugh', 'entirely', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'kill', 'two', 'hours', 'can', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'theatre', 'television', 'gigantic', 'smile', 'face']",N/A

These high-class coons are most likely to be embraced by mindless sheep too stupid to realize something wrong about 4 grown men talking about absolutely nothing. Just you average chittlin circuit routine. All that was missing from this show was all 4 of them putting on women's clothes and defiling the sacred image of the black elderly women.

Hughley, Cedric The Entertainer and Bernie Mac, and is a non-stop laugh-fest in the highest sense of the term. This review is not going to be a very long one - to be rather honest. The humor, of course, revolves around many taboo subjects like racial stereotypes, sex, religion and other things - if you are easily offended by any of these things, I suggest you avoid this film like the plague, because it is no holds barred! A few of the many hilarious scenes that I consider personal favorites from each comedian:(1). Steve Harvey does a pretty good job of mocking the characters in the Titanic film who choose to keep playing their violins amidst a major catastrophe. He later goes into detail about why he prefers ""old-school"" music; particularly old-school R&B;, over the hip-hop and rap trends that seem to be preferred by the modern generation. He does an effective job of lambasting rappers, and is absolutely laugh-out-loud hilarious. I was practically in tears from laughing so hard at this. Needs to be seen to be believed.(2). D.L. Hughley was hilarious too, but like some have pointed out, some of his routines came from other, earlier stand-up specials. Side note: If you can find a copy of his stand-up comedic special entitled ""Going Home,"" pick it up. That performance I believe to be his funniest, and it leaves me rolling on the floor everytime.(3). Cedric The Entertainer's humor was the least brash of all the four, and has more of a laid-back, subtle charm, which still manages to make you laugh. The whole break-dance scene was funny, as well as his ""cruising into outer space"" scene, his self-made ""martial art style"" scene, and others.(4). Bernie Mac - good lord. He was without a doubt the craziest, most brash, most (messed)-up comedian in this set. Sadistic and intensely cathartic, even. It's only fitting that he would be the last performer. His routine was just a little too much for me - and still is - and I mean that in the best way possible. His takes on kids and how they get (or should get) punished, sex and orgasm, and the ""stuttering"" kid were just too much - not only was I laughing too hard, but my lungs began to hurt, I nearly lost my voice for a brief period, and I was nearly out of oxygen. The guy was too much! Saying that he cracked me up would be a HUGE understatement.All in all, recommended for many who want (or need) a major laugh-fest. Sometimes, one of the best ways - if not the best way - to deal with unpleasant situations in life is to be able to laugh at them - as exemplified in this film. If you suffer from chronic asthma, heart disease, and/or are easily shocked - particularly by the things mentioned in the above paragraphs (including loads of profanity) - stay VERY far away from this - you will be digging yourself an early grave.",5,Sickeningly Hilarious!,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2874,"['film', 'stand-up', 'performances', 'comedians', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'non-stop', 'laugh-fest', 'highest', 'sense', 'term', 'review', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'long', 'one', 'be', 'rather', 'honest', 'humor', 'course', 'around', 'many', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'sex', 'religion', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'things', 'suggest', 'avoid', 'film', 'plague', 'barred', 'few', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'consider', 'personal', 'favorites', 'comedian', '1', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'mocking', 'characters', 'Titanic', 'film', 'who', 'choose', 'keep', 'playing', 'violins', 'major', 'catastrophe', 'later', 'detail', 'why', 'old-school', 'music', 'particularly', 'old-school', 'R', 'B', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'trends', 'seem', 'be', 'preferred', 'modern', 'generation', 'effective', 'job', 'lambasting', 'rappers', 'absolutely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'was', 'practically', 'tears', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.', '2', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'was', 'hilarious', 'too', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'routines', 'came', 'other', 'earlier', 'stand-up', 'specials', 'Side', 'note', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'stand-up', 'comedic', 'special', 'entitled', 'Going', 'Home', 'pick', 'up', 'performance', 'believe', 'be', 'funniest', 'rolling', 'floor', 'everytime.', '3', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'humor', 'was', 'least', 'brash', 'four', 'more', 'laid-back', 'subtle', 'charm', 'still', 'make', 'laugh', 'whole', 'break-dance', 'scene', 'was', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'cruising', 'outer', 'space', 'scene', 'self-made', 'martial', 'art', 'style', 'scene', 'others.', '4', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'good', 'lord', 'was', 'doubt', 'craziest', 'most', 'brash', 'most', 'messed', '-up', 'comedian', 'set', 'Sadistic', 'intensely', 'cathartic', 'even', 'only', 'fitting', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'performer', 'routine', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'mean', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'kids', 'how', 'get', 'should', 'get', 'punished', 'sex', 'orgasm', 'stuttering', 'kid', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'laughing', 'too', 'hard', 'lungs', 'began', 'hurt', 'nearly', 'lost', 'voice', 'brief', 'period', 'was', 'nearly', 'out', 'oxygen', 'guy', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Saying', 'cracked', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'HUGE', 'understatement.All', 'recommended', 'many', 'who', 'want', 'need', 'major', 'laugh-fest', 'Sometimes', 'one', 'best', 'ways', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'deal', 'unpleasant', 'situations', 'life', 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'exemplified', 'film', 'suffer', 'chronic', 'asthma', 'heart', 'disease', 'are', 'easily', 'shocked', 'particularly', 'things', 'mentioned', 'above', 'paragraphs', 'including', 'loads', 'profanity', 'stay', 'VERY', 'far', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'digging', 'early', 'grave']",N/A

You get the Original Kings of Comedy.For 2 years Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer criss-crossed the country performing funny and raunchy stand-up to sellout crowds left and right.  The movie, which is directed by Spike Lee, shows the Kings on the final stop on their tour in Charlotte, NC, along with how the crowd reacts to the jokes and how well these comic geniuses interact with each other.Harvey acts as the MC of the event, turning his hosting duties into hilarious riffs on how he knows that he's a country boy, a classic explanation on how different the music of the ""old-school"" R&B; is WAAAY different from the songs out now, and how it took a woman in his church who cursed and got her only other hobby of watching TV and church mixed up during devotional time that made him love going to church.Hughley's set is funny, but the only thing that burns him is that his jokes come at a rapid-fire pace that seems like it might be coming form the business end of a joke-telling Uzi.Cedric has what has to be the second-funniest performance in the movie as he has a more laid-back and down home style than Hughley.  Additionally, the fact that he can bust off some smooth dance moves to show how breakdancers used to settle up beefs and explain how he would deal with begging relatives is next to priceless...But the top dog of the perfornances has to go to Bernie Mac hands down.  He seemingly can show with effortless ease what a virtual hell his life is like dealing with being a surrogate father to 3 rather unruly kids, and how his sex life is not as up to par as it was when he was younger.  Additionally, I just couldn't stop laughing so hard when Bernie explained how one of his relatives who has a slight stuttering problem had to deal with being left by the bus...I nearly wet my pants from laughing so hard.The disc may not have a whole lot of extras (save for a few bonus scenes and the video for the Big Tymers' ""#1 Stunna"", but this is the quintessential comedy disc for those that are appreciative of stand- up and it shows why all 4 stars had their own TV shows (although only one of the shows-Bernie Mac's-is still on the air today in 2005).  It also shows why there was a spinoff tour/movie, The Queens of Comedy (Adele Givens, Sommore, Miss Laura, and Mo'Nique) created from the movie as well.Without question, these Kings deserve their crown, and long may they reign...",5,All hail the Kings!,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2588,"['What', 'when', 'take', 'four', 'funnest', 'African-American', 'male', 'comedians', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comedy', 'tours', 'recent', 'memory', 'get', 'Original', 'Kings', 'Comedy.For', '2', 'years', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'D.L', 'Hughley', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'criss-crossed', 'country', 'performing', 'funny', 'raunchy', 'stand-up', 'sellout', 'crowds', 'left', 'right', 'movie', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Kings', 'final', 'stop', 'tour', 'Charlotte', 'NC', 'how', 'crowd', 'jokes', 'how', 'well', 'comic', 'geniuses', 'interact', 'other.Harvey', 'acts', 'MC', 'event', 'turning', 'hosting', 'duties', 'hilarious', 'riffs', 'how', 'country', 'boy', 'classic', 'explanation', 'how', 'different', 'music', 'old-school', 'R', 'B', 'WAAAY', 'different', 'songs', 'out', 'now', 'how', 'took', 'woman', 'church', 'who', 'cursed', 'got', 'only', 'other', 'hobby', 'watching', 'TV', 'church', 'mixed', 'up', 'devotional', 'time', 'made', 'love', 'going', 'church.Hughley', 'set', 'funny', 'only', 'thing', 'jokes', 'come', 'rapid-fire', 'pace', 'might', 'be', 'coming', 'form', 'business', 'end', 'joke-telling', 'Uzi.Cedric', 'be', 'second-funniest', 'performance', 'movie', 'more', 'laid-back', 'down', 'home', 'style', 'Hughley', 'Additionally', 'fact', 'can', 'bust', 'off', 'smooth', 'dance', 'moves', 'show', 'how', 'breakdancers', 'used', 'settle', 'up', 'beefs', 'explain', 'how', 'would', 'deal', 'begging', 'relatives', 'next', 'priceless', 'top', 'dog', 'perfornances', 'go', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'down', 'seemingly', 'can', 'show', 'effortless', 'ease', 'what', 'virtual', 'hell', 'life', 'dealing', 'being', 'surrogate', 'father', '3', 'rather', 'unruly', 'kids', 'how', 'sex', 'life', 'not', 'par', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Additionally', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'when', 'Bernie', 'explained', 'how', 'one', 'relatives', 'who', 'slight', 'stuttering', 'problem', 'had', 'deal', 'being', 'left', 'bus', 'nearly', 'wet', 'pants', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard.The', 'disc', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'extras', 'save', 'few', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'video', 'Big', 'Tymers', '1', 'Stunna', 'quintessential', 'comedy', 'disc', 'are', 'appreciative', 'stand-', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'own', 'TV', 'shows', 'only', 'one', 'shows-Bernie', ""Mac's-is"", 'still', 'air', 'today', '2005', 'also', 'why', 'was', 'spinoff', 'tour/movie', 'Queens', 'Comedy', 'Adele', 'Givens', 'Sommore', 'Miss', 'Laura', ""Mo'Nique"", 'created', 'movie', 'well.Without', 'question', 'Kings', 'deserve', 'crown', 'long', 'may', 'reign']",N/A
568756,A9OVXY24IY777,B000056BOU,"""velurion""","[0, 0]","The first time I saw a blurry picture of Steve Harvey in a magazine I thought I was looking at a young Richard Pryor. My mistake, but besides that, I wasn&iexcl;t too far off; at least they&iexcl;re in the same business of making people laugh. Harvey, who is more or less the MC of the show, introduces the other comedians while adding in his own jokes along the way. I love that Harvey is so proudly &iexcl;old school&iexcl; and dishes out critique at the ever-so-annoying unenlightened Hip Hop artists; Original Kings of Comedy came out in 2000, but four years on, Harvey&iexcl;s observations are truer than ever.Obviously everyone will have his or her favourite comedian, but for me, the weakest link was by far DL Hughley. Maybe the younger crowd will like him more, but to me he seems more pretentious than the others. Unlike them, Hughley isn&iexcl;t self-effacing or self-deprecating, which to me is an essential quality for a comedian, because to be able to laugh at oneself is Basic Comedy 101. He&iexcl;s the first one on stage and to me he just sounds a lot like all the other stand up comedians out there. He lacks presence and charisma, which he probably thinks he makes up for by being loud and boisterous. Don&iexcl;t get me wrong, some of his jokes were funny, but the other 3 comedians just had a more unique style and flair.Next up is Cedric The Entertainer: I had high expectations of him, so along with his routine and his backstage banter plus Latin singing warm up in the men&iexcl;s&iexcl; bathroom, I was won over. He's got a real knack for pacing his jokes, that is, he takes his time more than the others. I mean this in a good way. It provides a nice contrast to the rapid-fire laughs of Mac and Hughley. He also plays with language a bit, and like Harvey, is excellent at creating a scene, where his characters and ensuing jokes come to life.When Bernie Mac arrives I was at first surprised by his thick accent, because I&iexcl;m used to seeing him in movie roles where he pronounces and articulates his lines more clearly. So admittedly I actually had to switch on the subtitles briefly while I reacquainted myself with his accent.  Anyway, Mac is just dynamite. He really is. He&iexcl;s such a great combination of honesty (especially about himself) and saying what the rest of us don&iexcl;t dare. And by the way he&iexcl;s right, it&iexcl;s not about black or white, we all just do things differently.So if I disliked Hughley so much, why do I still award the film 4 stars? Come on now, you can&iexcl;t beat the laughs in this one. The deleted scenes are all great (especially Mac&iexcl;s) and yes, perhaps Hughley is the weakest link to me, but thanks to him you really do get to see a variety of talent, and besides, maybe YOU will like him. This film by Spike Lee is a heap of fun. I&iexcl;ve seen other stand-up comedy DVDs, but this one is undoubtedly the &iexcl;King&iexcl; of &iexcl;em all!",4,The King of the Stand-up Comedy DVDs,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,2929,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'blurry', 'picture', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'magazine', 'thought', 'was', 'looking', 'young', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'My', 'mistake', 'wasn', 'iexcl', 't', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'least', 'iexcl', 're', 'same', 'business', 'making', 'people', 'laugh', 'Harvey', 'who', 'more', 'less', 'MC', 'show', 'other', 'comedians', 'adding', 'own', 'jokes', 'way', 'love', 'Harvey', 'so', 'proudly', 'iexcl', 'old', 'school', 'iexcl', 'out', 'critique', 'ever-so-annoying', 'unenlightened', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Original', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'came', 'out', '2000', 'four', 'years', 'Harvey', 'iexcl', 's', 'observations', 'are', 'truer', 'ever.Obviously', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favourite', 'comedian', 'weakest', 'link', 'was', 'far', 'DL', 'Hughley', 'Maybe', 'younger', 'crowd', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'more', 'pretentious', 'others', 'Hughley', 'isn', 'iexcl', 'self-effacing', 'self-deprecating', 'essential', 'quality', 'comedian', 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'Basic', 'Comedy', '101', 'iexcl', 'first', 'one', 'stage', 'just', 'lot', 'other', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'there', 'presence', 'charisma', 'probably', 'up', 'being', 'loud', 'boisterous', 'Don', 'iexcl', 'get', 'wrong', 'jokes', 'were', 'funny', 'other', '3', 'comedians', 'just', 'had', 'more', 'unique', 'style', 'flair.Next', 'up', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'so', 'routine', 'backstage', 'banter', 'Latin', 'singing', 'warm', 'up', 'men', 'iexcl', 'iexcl', 'bathroom', 'was', 'won', 'over', 'got', 'real', 'knack', 'pacing', 'jokes', 'time', 'more', 'others', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'nice', 'contrast', 'rapid-fire', 'laughs', 'Mac', 'Hughley', 'also', 'language', 'bit', 'Harvey', 'excellent', 'creating', 'scene', 'where', 'characters', 'ensuing', 'jokes', 'come', 'life.When', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'was', 'first', 'surprised', 'thick', 'accent', 'iexcl', 'm', 'used', 'seeing', 'movie', 'roles', 'where', 'lines', 'more', 'clearly', 'So', 'admittedly', 'actually', 'had', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'briefly', 'reacquainted', 'accent', 'Anyway', 'Mac', 'just', 'dynamite', 'really', 'iexcl', 's', 'such', 'great', 'combination', 'honesty', 'especially', 'saying', 'what', 'rest', 'don', 'iexcl', 'dare', 'way', 'iexcl', 'right', 'iexcl', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'just', 'do', 'things', 'differently.So', 'disliked', 'Hughley', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'do', 'still', 'award', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'Come', 'now', 'can', 'iexcl', 'beat', 'laughs', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Mac', 'iexcl', 'yes', 'perhaps', 'Hughley', 'weakest', 'link', 'thanks', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'variety', 'talent', 'besides', 'maybe', 'YOU', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'heap', 'fun', 'iexcl', 'seen', 'other', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'DVDs', 'one', 'undoubtedly', 'iexcl', 'King', 'iexcl', 'iexcl']",N/A

The show filmed is at the Charlotte Colosseum and additional footage at WPEG FM Power 98, backstage and viewer inserts are included. What makes this movie special is that all the comedians are targeting the same black audienence and are very different. Each comic complete with more good material than they ever use are funny. Steve Harvey localizes the Carolina Panthers football team and makes reference to how old school music involed love while hip hop is sometimes nonsense. DL Hughley's punch lines come as fast as an automatic weapon and does lots of observational humor into black culture. DL has more jokes than anyone else on the stage. Cedric's skit humor is more relaxed than Hughley and one could argue that he should have been the opener instead of DL just for tempo reasons. Cedric is hilarious but the audience seems slightly tired out after Harveys second performance. Finally Bernie Mac the Headliner of headliners for the evening gives what is a strong and shocking performance involving the disobedience of children and lackluster parenting of today. Mac is really doing a Broadway type one man show. Yes he's that good. Many great comics would have failed with his material but Bernie pulls it off with a strong finish. Black to White comparisons are made often in the show by each comic but they are more comparing than insulting. I would love to see a movie like this with white comics just because this movie has left me curious as to what it would be like.
