490140,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B000003K5S,Carl Malmstrom,"[4, 4]","When this episode was first shown on television and when I first watched it on video, I was rather disappointed at the fact that the writers of the episode could have done a lot more with the parallel universe idea than they actually did.  After all, in episodes like &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; in the Original Series and its (first) sequel &quot;Crossover&quot; in Deep Space Nine, they were able to put together some very creative ideas for how single events can change the course of history.  In &quot;Parallels&quot;, I was hoping for an all-out whirlwind tour through some of the strangest parallel worlds that the writers of Star Trek could come up with.  Back then, I was disappointed.However, having gone back and watched it a few days after the Voyager episode &quot;Shattered&quot; aired - a story basically designed to give a quick look back at the history of the series - I put in &quot;Parallels&quot; again to see how it had aged.  I realized that the episode was less about parallel worlds than it was about examining the historical dynamic of The Next Generation and what made it such a wonderful series.In retrospect, the episode was put together quite well.  The episode moves from mystery to psychological thriller to science fiction with well-written ease and slows along the way to highlight the decisions that took the Enterprise to where it was at the end of the TV series.I found the episode to be a wonderful example of Star Trek: The Next Generation in its full maturity as a series.  It exemplified the best ideas of Star Trek and told a compelling story with interesting science at the same time.  If you haven't seen it already and are a fan of Star Trek - or even just science fiction - I most definitely recommend owning this tape.",5,Better Than I Gave It Credit For...,980035200,"01 21, 2001",2001,1762,"['When', 'episode', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'television', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'video', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'writers', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'more', 'parallel', 'universe', 'idea', 'actually', 'did', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'Original', 'Series', 'first', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Crossover', 'quot', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'were', 'able', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'creative', 'ideas', 'how', 'single', 'events', 'can', 'change', 'course', 'history', 'quot', 'Parallels', 'quot', 'was', 'hoping', 'all-out', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'strangest', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'writers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'disappointed.However', 'having', 'gone', 'back', 'watched', 'few', 'days', 'Voyager', 'episode', 'quot', 'Shattered', 'quot', 'aired', 'story', 'basically', 'designed', 'give', 'quick', 'look', 'back', 'history', 'series', 'put', 'quot', 'Parallels', 'quot', 'again', 'see', 'how', 'had', 'aged', 'realized', 'episode', 'was', 'less', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'was', 'examining', 'historical', 'dynamic', 'Next', 'Generation', 'what', 'made', 'wonderful', 'series.In', 'retrospect', 'episode', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'well', 'episode', 'mystery', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'science', 'fiction', 'well-written', 'ease', 'way', 'highlight', 'decisions', 'took', 'Enterprise', 'where', 'was', 'end', 'TV', 'series.I', 'found', 'episode', 'be', 'wonderful', 'example', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'full', 'maturity', 'series', 'exemplified', 'best', 'ideas', 'Star', 'Trek', 'told', 'compelling', 'story', 'interesting', 'science', 'same', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already', 'are', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'even', 'just', 'science', 'fiction', 'most', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'owning', 'tape']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 163: Parallels VHS"
490141,A110AP71Q2CS1R,B000003K5S,Joe White,"[5, 5]","Two things make &quot;Parallels&quot; great:1. It's a Worf episode.  You can't go wrong there.2. It features parallel (or alternate) realities.  Trek has almost always been successful with this type of episode.  Remember classic Trek's &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;?  Or TNG's &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;?  You get the idea.It's fun to see our favorite characters in new roles.  As Worf bounces around from reality to reality (he hit one of those time warp/quantum flux space anomalies that seem so common in Trek), we see an Enterprise where Captain Picard was lost to the Borg, Riker is now the Captain and Worf is Riker's first officer.  We see a reality where Wesley Crusher is the chief security/tactical officer.  Another reality has a Cardassian flight control officer and the Federation is at war with the Bajorans!  And in yet another reality, Worf is married to Troi!  Fun all around!Usually, this type of episode would feature Riker or Picard or Data as the central character bouncing through parallel universe to parallel universe.  But this time it is Worf.  It isn't that Worf doesn't get his own stories (only Picard and Data had more in TNG's seven year run), it's just that Worf stories are generally tied into Klingon politics or raising his son Alexander.  It's nice that we get to see Worf as the central character in an episode dealing with time and space rather than the interworkings of Klingon politics.Strong episode and one of TNG's best.  It is a darn, fun episode, too.

From its inception, one of the underlying messages of TNG is &quot;anything and everything is possible.&quot; Parallels takes  this to the extreme. I really enjoyed the way the normally unflappable Worf  becomes increasingly baffled when confronted by weird gifts, ever-changing  realities and the truly awesome (frightening?) discovery that he's suddenly  married to Deanna Troi -- a fact he doesn't remember and probably never  even consciously considered. The storyline shifts very quickly between  realities and is downright surreal. I loved every minute of it. Non-TNG  viewers might find Parallels confusing, but fans will definitely appreciate  it.

There is no truth to the rumor that I have been spotted with wealthy Ferengi at the bar on Deep Space 9.  But I was pumped for this episode when it was broadcast. I have since recommended that everyone try to see Parallels, because I really do think it explains alot about our planet and the universe in general.  If you haven't seen it, in brief, Worf comes back from a gaming tournement only to find that reallity is changing for him about every  3 seconds, just not for everyone else.  So for example, Picard's there, then he's not, then Worf's married to Troi (he's the last to know this) then he's not (and gets in trouble), yadda, yadda, yadda.....Now, who among us has not worked somewhere like this?
