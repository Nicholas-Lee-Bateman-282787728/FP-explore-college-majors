1226602,A3CCVD1MKDVWZ7,B001PA0FF4,"A. Heifetz ""Arlekino1""","[1, 1]","The film started with a slow-paced exposition of Catholic school rituals and portrayal of characters.  From the moment I saw Meryl Streep's oppressive conduct during Father Flynn's rather simple-minded sermon, I knew that she would turn out to be the good person and he would end up being the scoundrel.  It was all expertly done but I thought that it was going to get boring. In the second half of the movie, however, the plot started to thicken.  Meryl Streep's performance in the film, especially during the verbal confrontation with Father Flynn, was so powerful that it took my breath away.  This performance alone made the film worth watching.The film explores themes regarding the Church and the relationship of the Church to the real world.  Some parts of it were very disturbing.  The boy's mother did not seem to mind that her boy was sexually abused, as long as he would end up getting a good education.  That is not easy to understand today but her life situation back then was rather complex and difficult.  Sister Aloysius wanted to bring down Father Flynn at any cost, even if the boy ended up being expelled - she did want to protect other children though.  Sister James was supposed to be a naive, innocent character.  It would seem that she would not be capable of lying or withholding any information from Sister Aloysius but then she never mentioned the undershirt that Father Flynn put in the boy's locker.  Yet she found it important enough to investigate herself and later ask Father Flynn about it.  At the end, she expressed her outrage at Sister Aloysius for lying about calling Father Flynn's last parish (it was funny how scared he got when he heard that).  Perhaps I am wrong, but the character of Sister James may not be so feeble-minded as inauthentic.  The ending was very problematic - Father Flynn ended up being transferred to another parish and in effect even promoted.  Given widespread, systematic and pervasive sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, it is not surprising.Overall, the film is not sympathetic to the practices of the Catholic church - I would even say that it is a scathing indictment.  Bishops and priests are shown as members of an old boys' club, living it up - boozing, feasting and sexually abusing children, and then covering up each other's crimes.  Those devotees who are capable of clearly distinguishing between right and wrong, even as they are trying to hang on to to the old traditions and rituals, are left having to live with the existential despair of doubting the existence of God.",4,Meryl Streep is magnificent...,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,2559,"['film', 'started', 'slow-paced', 'exposition', 'Catholic', 'school', 'rituals', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'moment', 'saw', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'oppressive', 'conduct', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'rather', 'simple-minded', 'sermon', 'knew', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'scoundrel', 'was', 'expertly', 'done', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'boring', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'however', 'plot', 'started', 'thicken', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'film', 'especially', 'verbal', 'confrontation', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'performance', 'alone', 'made', 'film', 'watching.The', 'film', 'themes', 'regarding', 'Church', 'relationship', 'Church', 'real', 'world', 'parts', 'were', 'very', 'disturbing', 'boy', 'mother', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'mind', 'boy', 'was', 'sexually', 'abused', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'good', 'education', 'not', 'easy', 'understand', 'today', 'life', 'situation', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'rather', 'complex', 'difficult', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'wanted', 'bring', 'down', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'cost', 'even', 'boy', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'expelled', 'did', 'want', 'protect', 'other', 'children', 'Sister', 'James', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'naive', 'innocent', 'character', 'would', 'seem', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'capable', 'lying', 'withholding', 'information', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'then', 'never', 'mentioned', 'undershirt', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'put', 'boy', 'locker', 'found', 'important', 'enough', 'investigate', 'later', 'ask', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'end', 'expressed', 'outrage', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'lying', 'calling', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'last', 'parish', 'was', 'funny', 'how', 'scared', 'got', 'when', 'heard', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'wrong', 'character', 'Sister', 'James', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'feeble-minded', 'inauthentic', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'problematic', 'Flynn', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'transferred', 'parish', 'effect', 'even', 'promoted', 'Given', 'widespread', 'systematic', 'pervasive', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'children', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'not', 'surprising.Overall', 'film', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'practices', 'Catholic', 'church', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'Bishops', 'priests', 'are', 'shown', 'members', 'old', 'boys', 'club', 'living', 'up', 'boozing', 'feasting', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'children', 'then', 'covering', 'up', 'other', 'crimes', 'devotees', 'who', 'are', 'capable', 'clearly', 'distinguishing', 'right', 'wrong', 'even', 'are', 'trying', 'hang', 'old', 'traditions', 'rituals', 'are', 'left', 'having', 'live', 'existential', 'despair', 'doubting', 'existence', 'God']",N/A

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","Excellent acting by all three stars enlivens this drama about a priest possibly involved in sexual abuse of a young teen. Merrill Streep, the middle-aged Sister Aloysius is principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx some time in the early 1960s. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Father Brendan, the parish priest who may possibly be abusing a teenage student. Amy Adams is Sister James, the young neophyte nun who wants to believe good about everybody but begins to develop doubts.The backdrop to the movie which uses authentic locations (it was shot in playwright and director John Patrick Shanley's own neighborhood and school) as well as the recurrent image of swirling leaves and the dark dull interiors lend an atmosphere of gloom.Streep gives a wonderful performance as a nun who has seen a good bit of the world. She had previously been married and widowed, we learn, before taking the veil. She is deliberately tough and down-to-earth. She is committed to fighting the priest. Seymour Hoffman portrays him as all too human, basically a decent sort with a specific weakness. Adams is all incredulity. Her character is the least nuanced and complicated but she delivers it well.The dialogue is often riveting and I found myself engrossed in the story.

1226609,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001PA0FF4,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","Doubt / B001PA0FFO*Spoilers*I have my doubts (har-har) that I went into ""Doubt"" with the correct mindset. I had expected one of those ""mess with your head"" movies where the viewer is never quite certain who was telling the truth and who was lying (or just blatantly wrong). So I was rather surprised and a bit disappointed when Philip Seymour Hoffman pretty much shows up in the first scene wearing an ""Hello, I am a pedophile"" T-shirt.Not that this was a bad call on the part of the movie-makers. Hoffman's recent roles have been enough of the ""shifty, guilty, and terribly wrong"" variety (Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) that it would be difficult for movie-goers to jump past that particular little type-casting long enough to give Hoffman the benefit of the doubt, particularly after a couple of decades of seemingly endless priest scandals and an unforgettable viewing ofDeliver Us from Evil. So even though a token effort is made to make Streep seem unfairly mean and spiritually shriveled, and to make Hoffman seem like a ""jus' folks"" kind of guy whose love for kids is completely wholesome, it's always clear that this token effort is made to excuse the doubts of the ancillary characters only, never to seriously engender doubts in the viewer.Not that the ancillary characters need much coaxing to believe the worst of Streep and the best of Hoffman. Adams stars across Streep as her younger foil, and her character is simultaneously frustratingly naive and yet realistically plagued with doubt. Her animosity towards Streep stems largely from an ideological difference in teaching (Adams thinks children are all unique butterflies and Streep thinks children are all unruly ruffians), but even when she makes this animosity plain and clear, Streep merely absorbs the abuse without a blink and carries on as if nothing has happened. By contrast, Hoffman reacts violently and abusively (even going so far as to incorporate the incident into an abusive and twisted sermon on ""his version"" of the matter) towards the slightest hint that his behavior may have been inappropriate, and Adams fails to notice anything usual or vindictive about this behavior in her haste to exonerate the priest.And here is the crux of the matter: Adams doesn't want Hoffman to be exonerated because she likes him, so much as she NEEDS him to be exonerated so that something awful hasn't happened under her very nose. Streep, on the other hand, is convinced of the truth and will not turn away from her convictions, but she confesses, in the movie's climax, to being haunted by doubts. The question we are left with is: What does she doubt? I do not think she doubts Hoffman's guilt or her own rightness, but rather I believe she doubts either the benevolence/existence of god or the rightness of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to, or possibly both.I deeply enjoyed this movie, if not as a ""who's telling the truth"" thriller, then at least as a dramatic depiction of one woman taking on the world, if not to save a child then at least to purge her school of a predator.

Their performances are stunning.Roman Catholicism is beset with contradictions.  It is a religion that has survived the ages despite itself.  It also has much to answer for and it has harmed many of its most fervent adherents.  In a broad sense, it is these issues that are touched upon in ""Doubt"".Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a priest (Father Flynn) within an inner city American diocese in the 1960s.  He seems good at his role but he is forced to confront Meryl Streep's Sister Aloysius who is principal of the diocesan school.  She comes to the view that Flynn is taking an unhealthy interest in an African American boy.  Unhealthy to point that there is some vague degree of sexual interference.  Flynn is vehement in his denials and the Sister has little proof.  She largely relies upon her own intuition.  The film is thus based around how the two main characters deal with the situation.Without wishing to reveal too much, the film ends with much doubt still remaining.

1226612,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001PA0FF4,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","I'm going to avoid using the obvious puns here (ala `no doubt about it' or `don't doubt it' or really anything with the word `doubt' in it) and just say this as blunt and straightforward as I can.I really expected a lot out of `Doubt', and while it managed to hit the right tone on a few occasions the end result was very uneven.Taking the helm in directing his own stage play for the big screen, John Patrick Shanley had a lot to live up to.  His play was very well received and so getting it onto the big screen was going to be difficult.  You have to be careful not to do your already adored work an injustice.  Getting the goddess known as Meryl Streep and the impressive Philip Seymour Hoffman to sign on to do your film is a step in the right direction.  Filter in `it' girl Amy Adams and veteran supporting player Viola Davis (the type of actress you recognize for her face, not her name) was also a blessing.But, can a writer actually direct his play on the big screen with the right amount restraint and power to make it enjoyable?I am in the minority here when I say that John Patrick Shanley's direction is probably the best thing about this movie; aside from Viola Davis.  Honestly, he really nailed it for me, and all the deemed clich&eacute; tricks he incorporated (ala the burnt out light bulbs and storm sequences) actually elevated the mood for me and really captured the essence of what `Doubt' was all about.  I even thought that his direction was slightly better than his writing.  The screenplay is powerful indeed, and the moral imposed on us is brilliantly developed; but I must admit that adapting a stage play holds varied obstacles; mainly dialog.  A play is very `dialog' reliant, while a film does not have to be such.  Some stage/screen adaptations remain dialog heavy because the story requires it (ala `Long Day's Journey into Night') but for the most part, if done right, the dialog can be trimmed and the surroundings can be used to emote what mere words cannot really convey.  I feel that Shanley's effort to transfer his play was only partially successful in that regard.  There are sequences that are almost boring because the words are not backed up by the needed emotion.  This could be a problem lying mainly in the actors themselves, but I feel that in some instances the dialog could have been trimmed to leave room for the actors to act with more than just their mouths.Take Viola Davis for instance, an actress who has a mere eight minutes or so of screen time and really only a mouthful of words to say and yet she manages to capture every ounce of this woman's state of affairs and dances circles around Streep.Aside from Davis the acting gets a little more hit-or-miss for me.  Amy Adams is serviceable yet nothing spectacular at all.  She hits the right emotional confusion in her final scenes, but it isn't anything truly noteworthy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in some scenes, and by that I mean VERY good.  In others though, he almost disappears into the background.  It's not that his performances is bad, because it's not, it's just that he lacks his usual strength in some scenes.  Streep was a surprise to me.  I had heard a lot said about how campy her performance was, but I didn't believe it.  Honestly, it's not wholly campy as much as it is just uneven.  She doesn't seem to have a complete handle on her character, and that's not something I've ever seen out of Streep.  Some scenes she's nearly flawless and yet in others it was almost as if a completely different actress was doing the role; and then to get walked all over like she was by all of her co-stars (Davis stomps all over her, Hoffman dominates her in their final confrontation scene and even Adams steals her thunder in the scenes finale).This is not `prime' Streep.The films subject of faith and morality, of suspicion and pride, of maliciousness and ethics is delicately handled and for the most part effective.  When the film ends the viewer is left with the same feeling of `doubt' Sister Aloysius is left with, so the film is effective.  It's just not as effective as it could have been had all of the elements come together as I expected they would.  I know that this is a raved film that landed on quite a few top ten lists and managed five Oscar nominations, but I'd only give it one (Davis in UNDENIABLE) and leave it at that.  I'd recommend it, sure, for it is not entirely without merit but I would not label it a masterpiece or even a `must see' film at all.",3,"It has its good points, but the elements didn't come together as perfectly as one would expect...",1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,4503,"[""'m"", 'going', 'avoid', 'using', 'obvious', 'puns', 'here', 'ala', 'no', 'doubt', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'really', 'anything', 'word', 'doubt', 'just', 'say', 'blunt', 'straightforward', 'can.I', 'really', 'expected', 'lot', 'Doubt', 'managed', 'hit', 'right', 'tone', 'few', 'occasions', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'very', 'uneven.Taking', 'helm', 'directing', 'own', 'stage', 'play', 'big', 'screen', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'play', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'received', 'so', 'getting', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'difficult', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'do', 'already', 'adored', 'work', 'injustice', 'Getting', 'goddess', 'known', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'impressive', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'sign', 'do', 'film', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'Filter', 'girl', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'veteran', 'supporting', 'player', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'type', 'actress', 'recognize', 'face', 'not', 'name', 'was', 'also', 'blessing.But', 'can', 'writer', 'actually', 'direct', 'play', 'big', 'screen', 'right', 'amount', 'restraint', 'power', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'when', 'say', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'direction', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'aside', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Honestly', 'really', 'nailed', 'deemed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tricks', 'incorporated', 'burnt', 'out', 'light', 'bulbs', 'storm', 'sequences', 'actually', 'elevated', 'mood', 'really', 'captured', 'essence', 'what', 'Doubt', 'was', 'even', 'thought', 'direction', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'powerful', 'indeed', 'moral', 'imposed', 'brilliantly', 'developed', 'must', 'admit', 'adapting', 'stage', 'play', 'varied', 'obstacles', 'mainly', 'dialog', 'play', 'very', 'dialog', 'reliant', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'such', 'stage/screen', 'adaptations', 'remain', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'story', 'ala', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'most', 'part', 'done', 'right', 'dialog', 'can', 'be', 'trimmed', 'surroundings', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'emote', 'what', 'mere', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'convey', 'feel', 'Shanley', 'effort', 'transfer', 'play', 'was', 'only', 'partially', 'successful', 'regard', 'are', 'sequences', 'are', 'almost', 'boring', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'backed', 'up', 'needed', 'emotion', 'could', 'be', 'problem', 'lying', 'mainly', 'actors', 'feel', 'instances', 'dialog', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'leave', 'room', 'actors', 'act', 'more', 'just', 'mouths.Take', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'instance', 'actress', 'who', 'mere', 'eight', 'minutes', 'so', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'only', 'mouthful', 'words', 'say', 'yet', 'capture', 'ounce', 'woman', 'state', 'affairs', 'dances', 'circles', 'Streep.Aside', 'Davis', 'acting', 'little', 'more', 'hit-or-miss', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'serviceable', 'yet', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'right', 'emotional', 'confusion', 'final', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'anything', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'mean', 'VERY', 'good', 'others', 'almost', 'background', 'not', 'performances', 'bad', 'not', 'just', 'usual', 'strength', 'scenes', 'Streep', 'was', 'surprise', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'said', 'how', 'campy', 'performance', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Honestly', 'not', 'wholly', 'campy', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'uneven', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'complete', 'handle', 'character', 'not', 'something', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Streep', 'scenes', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'yet', 'others', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'actress', 'was', 'doing', 'role', 'then', 'get', 'walked', 'was', 'co-stars', 'Davis', 'Hoffman', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'even', 'Adams', 'thunder', 'scenes', 'finale', '.This', 'not', 'prime', 'Streep.The', 'films', 'subject', 'faith', 'morality', 'suspicion', 'pride', 'maliciousness', 'ethics', 'delicately', 'handled', 'most', 'part', 'effective', 'When', 'film', 'viewer', 'left', 'same', 'feeling', 'doubt', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'left', 'film', 'effective', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'expected', 'would', 'know', 'raved', 'film', 'landed', 'few', 'top', 'ten', 'lists', 'managed', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', ""'d"", 'only', 'give', 'one', 'Davis', 'UNDENIABLE', 'leave', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'sure', 'not', 'entirely', 'merit', 'would', 'not', 'label', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'must', 'see', 'film']",N/A
1226613,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001PA0FF4,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","In various 'professional' reviews of John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own hit play, I've read things like ""Philip Seymour Hoffman goes toe to toe with Meryl Streep""..and ""Amy Adams holds her own against Meryl Streep""..and ""despite only being on the screen for 12 minutes, Viola Davis hangs with Meryl Streep.""  Hmmmm [scratches chin]...what do these reactions all have in common?  Only that Meryl Streep is the measuring stick against whom all others are to be judged.  I guess it's passe to say directly that Meryl Streep is extraordinary.  Instead, everyone now puts her co-stars on some type of Streep-o-meter.  Needless to say, the best performance in a Meryl Streep movie is...Meryl Streep.  That's taken for granted some times.The movie itself is pure dynamite.  As someone who was raised as a Catholic in the 60s and attended a Catholic high school in the 70s, this movie resonated deeply with me.  One scene that stuck out: Shanley's juxtaposition of the prim, cloistered convent with its almost mute nuns, followed immediately by nothing less than the raucous cacophony of the rectory with its hard-drinking, garrulous priests.  This scene was pure genius and no doubt left many of my fellow Catholics of a certain age thrilled with such a realistic portrayal.  I raved to my wife after the film about absolute truth of that passage.Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his role here.  His character is believable as a mentor to the boys - the scene where he helps them shoot foul shots and answers some of their questions shows that mentoring side.  But Shanley's script is subtle and telling here, too, because we also get some of the character's quirkiness.  Hoffman shows the boys his clean nails and says ""I like to keep them a little long.""  Just enough to make you start thinking...",5,Raised as a Catholic in the 60s and 70s?

1226615,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B001PA0FF4,Anthony Hand,"[3, 3]","This is going to be a somewhat short(ish) review from me. Primarily, because I don't wish to give too much away about the film. It's very difficult to talk about this film and remain on the side of a potential viewer, but here goes...The movie is set in 1964, a year after Kennedy's shooting, but goes a great distance to reflect a time even further back in the past. The particular religious order in the film is unbeknownst to me, but it is rooted in a staunch and strict manifestation of Catholic belief. Something which Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is eager to move away from in an effort to get closer to the general public. But, this staunchness, seems to offer succor to his opposite, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryil Streep), who appears to have surrendered herself to a more hard lined path. This is evidenced in her banning of ballpoint pens in the Catholic school she is principal of and her disapproval of Father Flynn's sweet tooth. These two characters are balanced out by Sister James (Amy Adams), who gives a gentle performance as Sister Aloysius' would-be cohort.In short, Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of engaging in ""activities"" that would be ""unbecoming"" of the school and seeks to undermine his position and have him removed. But the real meat of the piece is not in its basic premise, but in the questions (and doubts) it throws up in the course of the events. There is little of a black and white nature on offer in this film and that in itself creates a very strong and compelling pull to the story. Even at the end of the movie, there is still a lot of room for maneuver, as far as the viewer is concerned and for those wishing to have all the loose ends tied up, they may be left feeling a little disappointed.The real attraction to the film however, is not really the actual story (which may be a little thin to some), but the superb performances that are given by the cast involved. I haven't seen a film in such a long time where everyone on screen turns in such an utterly convincing act.

1226618,A2WFNZWC8O6O1J,B001PA0FF4,Atticus,"[0, 0]","""Doubt"", Father Brendan Flynn tells his congregation, ""can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.""  So fitting that an engaging sermon on Doubt should begin a film so thoroughly based on it.  John Patrick Shanley's DOUBT is an engaging drama about what to do and where you go when you are uncertain and filled with, for lack of a better term, doubts.  He wrote and directed this film based on his Tony and Pulitzer Award-Winning play.  In one of the rich texts of the original play, Sister James asks Flynn if he always makes up little stories to accompany his messages.  He replies, ""Yes.  What actually happens in life is beyond interpretation.  It tends to be confusing and have no clear conclusion.""  Shanley seems to agree.  In fact, he added the subtitle ""A Parable"" to DOUBT's title after it opened on Broadway.  He created his own little story to explain his reasoning and thoughts on that all-enveloping feeling of uncertainty and despair.  His play succeeded, and his film succeeds on many levels as well.Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of St. Nichol's Catholic School.  She rules with an iron fist, hissing and hitting students during sermons and interrupting classes to humiliate and punish kids.  When told by Sister James, adeptly played by Amy Adams, that ""the students are all uniformly terrified of you"", Streep replies wryly and nonchalantly: ""That's how it works"".  She is, at heart, a traditionalist, who loathes Father Flynn and everything he does and stands for.  When suggested that the school Christmas Pageant might include a secular song like ""Frosty the Snowman"" she rants on how the song inspires a pagan belief in magic and how it should be banned from the airwaves.  Trust me that ""Frosty"" is never mentioned again.  We know little of Sister Aloysius's past, other than she was married to a man who died in WWII.  Is her lasting grief the reason she's so bitter?  We never know, and it doesn't really matter.  That's why Shanley's character development is so unique.  He doesn't present us with life stories or background material.  We know who the characters are and what they're like now, and their attitudes and actions in the moment shape our perception of them.  We learn about them from their actions only, and we don't get motives or back-story.  Shanley doesn't psychoanalyze his characters; he presents them to us and leaves us to make of them what we will.  Aloysius is a true conservative, incorruptible and solid in her faith and methods...the true nun.  She will ""do what needs to be done"".That's why she launches herself and Sister James into a campaign of suspicion against Flynn, who has taken a particular interest in the school's first African American student, Donald Muller.  Sister James comes to Aloysius with concerns: Flynn has summoned Muller to the rectory for a private meeting, and, after returning, Donald acted strangely and smelt of alcohol.  He's the alter boy.  Did he sneak some wine?  Or, as Aloysius is convinced, was he given some by Flynn?  After an initial confrontation with Flynn, Aloysius is convinced he is taking advantage of young Donald and his fervent denials are lies.  Sister James wants no part of it, but it's too late.  She's in it already.  And Sister Aloysius won't stop until Father Flynn is punished for his sin.  It's no matter that there is no proof whatsoever.  She has her certainty, and she's justified in all means she uses to bring him to justice.Streep's personification of Aloysius is one of the best I've seen.  She completely submerges herself into the character, adapting mannerisms and speaking habits so unique and perfect you find yourself saying, this can't possibly be the woman I saw bouncing on mattresses, jumping with wild gesticulations into the ocean, and singing ABBA songs in the trailer for MAMMA MIA!  Well, it is.  That's the thing about Streep; she plays all of her roles with such cleverness and exclusivity that you can't possibly associate them closely with each other.  As Sister Aloysius she is a tsunami of acting, debating with Flynn with such forcefulness and convincing James with such smoothness and wit.  It's a knock she'll get an Oscar nomination for this role, and she deserves to win.Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Flynn, can't seem to decide whether his character is in the wrong or not.  One minute he'll make Flynn's denials seem false and forced, but in some scenes, as in the last debate between him and Streep, he is so convincing his innocence is thoroughly established in our minds.  Just as we can't decide, neither can he.  In one scene his characteristics will scream ""I'm lying!  I've sinned!  Look no further, here I am!"" and in some other scenes he'll make you wander how you ever questioned his purity.  Maybe this was how he intended to play his character, but I found myself wishing he would, as an actor, decide whether Flynn was in the right or not and play the character that way.  Anyhow, his arguments with Streep, especially the last, shoot out sparks from the screen.Amy Adams is wonderful in her role as Sister James, the nun who got herself into this mess and just wants out.  She came to Sister Aloysius with the purest of intentions, and now she is punished for it.  ""I wish I could be like you,"" she tells Aloysius.  ""Because I can't sleep at night anymore.  Everything seems uncertain to me."" In early scenes she is radiant while teaching, a joy to the kids in her class and a joy for the audience to watch.  During a later scene in her classroom, she is overwhelmed by it all.  She becomes Aloysius, snapping at her students and threatening punishment.  She apologizes to the class, but by the end of the film she is transformed.  She has doubts, and she's lost her joy in teaching.  She looks up to Aloysius as something to strive to and to Flynn as a mentor, and she's torn between them.  Adams, in her early scenes, reminds one of her earlier role as Giselle in ENCHANTED, but soon she breaks out of the mold and fleshes out her character.  Viola Davis will be nominated and will probably win Best Supporting Actress for her brief role as Donald's mother, who wants him to complete the school.  ""It's just `till June,"" she says.  After this school, he may even have a chance at college.  She's accepting of her son's ""nature"" and is fine with Flynn's relationship with her boy.  ""He has his motives,"" she says.  ""Everyone has their motives, you have yours.  But do I question him, when he's kind to my boy?  Never.""  She's heartbreaking in her only scene, as a mother who just can't do any more.  She wants the best for her son, but when will wanting the best come to something bad?  When does it get to the point where she just doesn't care anymore?Questions, questions.  The film is full of them, and not all of them get answered.  Many will be unsatisfied with the end of the film, but I thought it was perfect.  The final line and final revelation of the film spoke oceans to me, and it further proved Shanley's talent as a writer.  He is a decent director as well, using several inventive techniques to exploit the audience's emotions.  And yes, several emotions are exploited.  This film is an intelligent, engaging drama and you won't stop thinking until way after the credits are done rolling.  Think of how many films keep you on your toes and provoke thoughts and questions still after the film is over?  I bet that list is short.DOUBT succeeds as a very appealing and satisfying drama.  It forces one to look deeper than the initial suspicion and the initial revelation.  The performances are top-class and the script inspired.  The messages and feelings the story provoke and poignant and affecting...thought not necessarily classified as ""morals"" there are many themes to the story that you would be hard pressed not to pick up.  Yes, doubt affects everyone, even the most firm.  But when does uncertainty envelop all?  How far does certainty alone carry you?  How can circumstance be enough to condemn a man or prove his innocence?  Ask yourself these questions while viewing DOUBT, but be open for your answers to change.  Don't be too certain, like Sister Aloysius.  For purity can give way to corruption, and conviction can give way to doubt.",5,A Superbly Crafted Drama That Sports Winning Acting and Script!,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,8249,"['Doubt', 'Father',

1226619,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B001PA0FF4,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[0, 0]","""Doubt""-----------------------------------Two powerhouse performances bookend this adaptation of a searing topical play about child molestation in the Catholic Church. Philip Seymour Hoffman shines as a progressive young priest in charge of a mid-1960s Boston parish, and Meryl Streep stars as Sister Aloysius, a conservative nun in charge of the parish school. She is tense and snappish, constantly primed to find fault and to correct bad behavior, and when she comes to suspect the priest of abusing one (or more) of her students, she launches an all-out assault on his character and on his power. This clash is multi-layered and complex, touching on issues of religious orthodoxy, social change, Church hierarchy (and its gender-based components) as well as on the now-open issue of child abuse within church walls.As the title suggests, viewers are to be held in suspense by this film, as priest and nun joust and parry with each other, each asserting their own unassailable authority against that of the other. But did he do it... or not?  I thought each of the leads was superb in their roles, each completely inhabiting these characters from a bygone era. Less compelling was mousy, skittish Amy Adams, who plays a young nun caught in the crossfires -- she accidentally rats Hoffman out, but regrets her role in his undoing. Adams' character flits about like a whiffleball, siding with first one, then the other, while awkwardly bearing witness to their titanic struggle.  The trouble is, the struggle fizzles out quickly, and comes to an abrupt end that feels somehow unsatisfying in the context of such a large, elegant film. (I suspect it was much, much more electrifying in the original stage production...)  This was a good film, but I have to *ahem* confess that it didn't totally blow me away.  Certainly worth viewing, though.

Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Brendan Flynn, the parish priest. Joseph Foster II plays Donald Miller, the first black student in the school and an altar boy. Amy Adams plays his history teacher, Sister James.Ah, you're getting the picture already, aren't you?Sister Aloysius is suspicious of Father Flynn, although she does not specify why. It's not just the sermon he gives on the topic of Doubt, but as she puts it, ""I know people."" Indeed she does, but we may be left with a question as to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Father Flynn is only slightly indiscreet, and can cover his behavior with lies. But one lie (I'm trying not to give away too much) leaves the boy taking punishment for something that was really Father Flynn's doing.Sister Aloysius asks Donald's parents to come and talk with her, but only his mother shows up. She reveals some important facts about what's going on, as well as her attitude toward the situation and her husband's. The audience has no choice but to conclude that this boy is in a total trap. There is nothing, literally nothing, he can do to improve his situation.The same cannot be said of Sister Aloysius. And I will leave it there so as to avoid ruining the conclusion. In the very end, she is sitting in the courtyard which is covered with snow when Sister James finds her, and talks over with her exactly what happened. Her last line is ""I have such doubts. Such doubts.""It's a moving story, but it's hard to know with whom to sympathize, who to blame. It's just a very tragic story.

1226621,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B001PA0FF4,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[11, 11]","See this movie only if you enjoy a film where the acting and writing is way above average, and only if you are in the mood for a film that will induce thought. This is not a movie to settle down with if you just want to be entertained for the evening. It's basically a quiet character study about conflicting people (although it does get fairly tense and emotional at times).I grew up in the 1970's and went to Catholic school; it was a decade after this film's time period but not much had changed, believe me. I was used to all the trappings of the church and of nuns and priests. I was not an altar boy but I was exposed to the traditions and experiences that are seen in this film. I would imagine that someone who is not familiar with these things at all might find some aspects of this movie to be almost foreign in certain ways. But a viewer need not be familiar with Catholicism (or even with the Bronx in 1964) to appreciate this movie.The four principles give outstanding performances, particularly Meryl Streep and Viola Davis (Davis has just one major scene, and she is excellent in it). Streep owns the movie as the conflicted and multifaceted Sister Aloysius; this is probably the most relentless and stubborn woman in cinema since Nurse Ratched in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1975 (played by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher). I was fascinated with this character, and torn over how I felt about her. She can be considered a heroine and also a villain at the same time. It's hard to explain. She can be strict, unfair, caring, funny, impatient, and cold. And it's no surprise that this would be another (her sixteenth) Oscar nomination for Meryl Streep. She never stops creating authentic characters. In ""Doubt"", her mannerisms, body language, accent, and expressions were all spot-on.The film is sometimes ambiguous, particularly the final scene. Some things are left to the audience to wrestle with and to interpret. I enjoyed that the story becomes much more than a mystery, that it becomes more about a person's choices and judgments and decisions.

The answers to the questions it poses are not readily evidentIn 1964, a young idealistic priest starts work at a New York Catholic boys school, which just enroled its first black student. The school is run by an old school nun, who favors discipline over nuturing. The priest and nun are played by Philip Seamour Hoffman and Marrel Streep. Amy Adams plays the younger teacher trying to bridge the two.Hoffman's charactor is accused of molesting the young black student. There is evidence to suggest he did, but evidence to suggest he did not. Both nun and priest bring their own biasis to their argument--they highly dislike one another on personal and politcal ground--so who you beleive depends may depend on who you agree with. If this sounds subjective, think of how Amy Adam's charactor felt when chosing sides. She is the kindest here and the only person with no clear agenda.This was right after Vatican II, which tried to update dogma in the Catholic Faith.

1226624,A30TQET02FLSUX,B001PA0FF4,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching a fantastic film for those of us who love ""talkie"" movies. Doubt (2008) is extremely well written, well directed, and well acted. Another great Miramax masterpiece! I'm just disappointed in myself for missing this movie back in 2008 when it came out.  But having confessed and repented by seeing it on Starz in HD, I forgive myself! I give the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. The film is a tense mind puzzle that teases you along like a greyhound chasing a rabbit, with the hope of getting the prize. And yet the film's payoff at the end is just like at the racetrack...not quite what you wanted, but enough to satisfy you with having run the race. I respect director John Patrick Shanley for his choice to let the built-up tension in the film fade more with a whimper instead of a bang. The obvious choice, and probably the one I would make, would be to bring the film to the dramatic ""showy"" climax that you expect. It took guts on Shanley's part to instead choose the more sophisticated and subtle ending that he did. It's upon reflection on the movie that I get the ""bang"" from it...reliving the great tense scenes over and over in my mind and imagining various alternatives.The above may sound a little cryptic, but I don't want to give away the story of the film. This film is all about the story and the characters. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis are absolutely brilliant in their intertwined roles within the parish. Hoffman is the Priest, Streep is the Principal of the school, Adams is a teacher within the school, and Davis is the mother of the first and only black student. All four of them bring their A-game to their performances and rightly deserved the four Oscar nominations they got for acting. I'm surprised none of them won, but it was competitive year as always.Doubt was a very well designed and photographed production, it's austerity is true to its subject matter and setting within a Bronx Catholic church in 1964. I never once questioned when or where I was. I easily escaped into this film's time period. The cinematography by DP Roger Deakins is just as we have come to expect from him and his other great work in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), House of Sand and Fog (2003), Thirteen Days (2000), Kundun (1997), Courage Under Fire (1996), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), and Thunderheart (1992)...to name just a few of his 50+ movies! He's by far one of the most talented and prolific directors of photography in the business.What I really love about Doubt is that it asks many questions and it gets you to ask yourself many questions. And you don't always get answers from the movie or yourself. But it's a thought provoking movie that looks at a number of important issues in our culture from several points of view...from the time period of  the 1960s when this film is set, right to the present. It asks questions about religion and spirituality, about gossip, about school...and it all feels as relevant today as I'm sure it was in the 60s and probably earlier. I'm gonna go out on a limb and predict that this movie holds up well for many years to come. I'll be interested to revisit it down the road in 5-10 years and see what new questions (and/or answers) I get from it.",3,Ask Me No Questions and I'll Give You No Answers,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,3296,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'film', 'who', 'love', 'talkie', 'movies', 'Doubt', '2008', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'Miramax', 'masterpiece', ""'m"", 'just', 'disappointed', 'missing', 'movie', 'back', '2008', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'having', 'confessed', 'repented', 'seeing', 'Starz', 'HD', 'forgive', 'give', 'film', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'tense', 'mind', 'puzzle', 'greyhound', 'chasing', 'rabbit', 'hope', 'getting', 'prize', 'yet', 'film', 'payoff', 'end', 'just', 'like', 'racetrack', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'wanted', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'having', 'run', 'race', 'respect', 'director', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'choice', 'let', 'built-up', 'tension', 'film', 'fade', 'more', 'whimper', 'instead', 'bang', 'obvious', 'choice', 'probably', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'would', 'be', 'bring', 'film', 'dramatic', 'showy', 'climax', 'expect', 'took', 'guts', 'Shanley', 'part', 'instead', 'choose', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'subtle', 'ending', 'did', 'upon', 'reflection', 'movie', 'get', 'bang', 'reliving', 'great', 'tense', 'scenes', 'mind', 'imagining', 'various', 'alternatives.The', 'may', 'sound', 'little', 'cryptic', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'film', 'film', 'story', 'characters', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'intertwined', 'roles', 'parish', 'Hoffman', 'Priest', 'Streep', 'Principal', 'school', 'Adams', 'teacher', 'school', 'Davis', 'mother', 'first', 'only', 'black', 'student', 'four', 'bring', 'A-game', 'performances', 'rightly', 'deserved', 'four', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'got', 'acting', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'none', 'won', 'was', 'competitive', 'year', 'always.Doubt', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'designed', 'photographed', 'production', 'austerity', 'true', 'subject', 'matter', 'setting', 'Bronx', 'Catholic', 'church', '1964', 'never', 'once', 'questioned', 'when', 'where', 'was', 'easily', 'escaped', 'film', 'time', 'period', 'cinematography', 'DP', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'just', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'other', 'great', 'work', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', '2007', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', '2003', 'Thirteen', 'Days', '2000', 'Kundun', '1997', 'Courage', 'Fire', '1996', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '1994', 'Thunderheart', '1992', 'name', 'just', 'few', '50+', 'movies', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'prolific', 'directors', 'photography', 'business.What', 'really', 'love', 'Doubt', 'many', 'questions', 'ask', 'many', 'questions', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'answers', 'movie', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'number', 'important', 'issues', 'culture', 'several', 'points', 'view', 'time', 'period', '1960s', 'when', 'film', 'set', 'right', 'present', 'questions', 'religion', 'spirituality', 'gossip', 'school', 'feels', 'relevant', 'today', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', '60s', 'probably', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'predict', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'many', 'years', 'come', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'revisit', 'down', 'road', '5-10', 'years', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'questions', 'and/or', 'answers', 'get']",N/A

1226634,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001PA0FF4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 3]","The film based on John Patrick Shanley's play is superbly done. The actors are in top form with Meryl Streep and Seymour Hoffman demonstrating consider acting force as a nun and a priest in a struggle for competing versions of reality. It is basically about the quest for truth in a world of incomplete clues and hints. The search for truth may lead to a broad range of consequences depending on whose truth is accepted and whose truth is rejected. Sister Aloysius, the Catholic school principal, played by Meryl Streep, is convinced that she has discovered a truth about Father Brendan Flynn, a robust likable assertive priest, played by Seymour Hoffman.A great strength of the films script is that Shanley leaves the mystery somewhat unresolved in the screen play. Though some film viewers may have concluded that Father Flynn did have some improper behavior with a student, there is still much room for doubt since Father Muller could have been transferred to another Catholic parish to avoid Sister Aloysius' continued assault on his reputation and his peace of mind.The film begins with the central theme of the play, as given in a sermon by Father Flynn. He states: ""What do you do when you are not sure?""  The play cascades from this point with Sister Aloysius convinced of Father Flynn's guilt and Sister James wracked with moral uncertainty as to what is true or not true and what are the moral consequences for each decision.Each clue in the film propels you toward one solution until you are given another clue drawing you in the opposite direction and conclusion. In this way, Sister James acts as the viewer and she voices some of the same trusts and doubts that must be in the mind of every viewer of the film. Some viewers of the film will not rush to judgment and will absorb the subtle clues that propel this clash of characters forward.  Other viewers of the film will take sides since Father Flynn is a likeable, robust, assertive, clever, strong, person who is contrasted with the cold rock strength and certainty of Sister Aloysius, who is never presented as especially warm or compassionate yet her actions speak to great compassion if indeed she fully believes she is interrupting the sexual predatory actions of Father Flynn.The film even takes a surprise direction when we hear from Donald Muller's mother who tells us her son is an effeminate child who was been repeatedly beaten in public schools as well as by his father for his effeminate behaviors. In Catholic school, his mother hoped he would be protected. His mother sees the possible attentions of this white priest toward her son as far more desirable than the hostility he experiences from young males in public school or from his own father. The character of Mrs. Muller is unexpected, wonderfully acted, and throws a complete different light onto the actions of the play. Sister Aloysius thought she had found a partner and then found more than for which she had bargained.The film comes to a resolution, one that I will not reveal and one that not every viewer will like or appreciate. But the human condition requires doubt, and certainty is so rare that we rightfully distrust it, doubt is far more likely to be the fate of human beings.",5,We know more of doubt than we know of certainty,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3228,"['film', 'based', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'play', 'superbly', 'done', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'demonstrating', 'consider', 'acting', 'force', 'nun', 'priest', 'struggle', 'competing', 'versions', 'reality', 'basically', 'quest', 'truth', 'world', 'incomplete', 'clues', 'hints', 'search', 'truth', 'may', 'lead', 'broad', 'range', 'consequences', 'depending', 'truth', 'accepted', 'truth', 'rejected', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Catholic', 'school', 'principal', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'convinced', 'discovered', 'truth', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'Flynn', 'robust', 'likable', 'assertive', 'priest', 'played', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman.A', 'great', 'strength', 'films', 'script', 'Shanley', 'mystery', 'somewhat', 'unresolved', 'screen', 'play', 'film', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'concluded', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'did', 'have', 'improper', 'behavior', 'student', 'still', 'much', 'room', 'doubt', 'Father', 'Muller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'Catholic', 'parish', 'avoid', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'continued', 'assault', 'reputation', 'peace', 'mind.The', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'play', 'given', 'sermon', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'play', 'point', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'convinced', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'guilt', 'Sister', 'James', 'wracked', 'moral', 'uncertainty', 'what', 'true', 'not', 'true', 'are', 'moral', 'consequences', 'decision.Each', 'clue', 'film', 'propels', 'one', 'solution', 'are', 'given', 'clue', 'drawing', 'opposite', 'direction', 'conclusion', 'way', 'Sister', 'James', 'viewer', 'same', 'trusts', 'doubts', 'must', 'be', 'mind', 'viewer', 'film', 'viewers', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'rush', 'judgment', 'will', 'absorb', 'subtle', 'clues', 'propel', 'clash', 'characters', 'forward', 'Other', 'viewers', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'sides', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'likeable', 'robust', 'assertive', 'clever', 'strong', 'person', 'who', 'contrasted', 'cold', 'rock', 'strength', 'certainty', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'who', 'never', 'presented', 'especially', 'warm', 'compassionate', 'yet', 'actions', 'speak', 'great', 'compassion', 'indeed', 'fully', 'interrupting', 'sexual', 'predatory', 'actions', 'Father', 'Flynn.The', 'film', 'even', 'surprise', 'direction', 'when', 'hear', 'Donald', 'Muller', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'effeminate', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'beaten', 'public', 'schools', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'effeminate', 'behaviors', 'Catholic', 'school', 'mother', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'protected', 'mother', 'possible', 'attentions', 'white', 'priest', 'son', 'far', 'more', 'desirable', 'hostility', 'young', 'males', 'public', 'school', 'own', 'father', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Muller', 'unexpected', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'complete', 'different', 'light', 'actions', 'play', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'partner', 'then', 'found', 'more', 'had', 'bargained.The', 'film', 'resolution', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'one', 'not', 'viewer', 'will', 'like', 'appreciate', 'human', 'condition', 'doubt', 'certainty', 'so', 'rare', 'rightfully', 'distrust', 'doubt', 'far', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'fate', 'human', 'beings']",N/A

For all intents and purposes, he was speaking directly to the audience watching ""Doubt,"" a film adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's play. Here's a film that doesn't impose a belief so much as it encourages thought. It's an absorbing character study with the structure of a mystery and the subtext of a morality play, which is to say that the blending of genres makes for a fascinating story. So do the characters, each so thoroughly developed that they never once felt like shallow stereotypes. I felt as if I could listen to them talk for hours, which really must give you an idea how engrossing their dialogue is; Shanley reveals his characters more with the careful, deliberate usage of words than with actions. Some may find that boring. I found it masterful.Taking place in 1964, ""Doubt"" tells the story of a nun who suspects a priest of abusing a teenage boy at a New York City Catholic school. The nun is Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the school's principal. She's a stern, unsympathetic, conservative woman with a keen eye for misconduct. Some would say it's too keen; there's a sense that she actively looks for something to discipline, be it a student not sitting up straight, the obvious pagan undertones to ""Frosty the Snowman,"" the undignified usage of ballpoint pens, or teachers with an innocent outlook on life. Such a teacher is Sister James (Amy Adams), the school's eighth grade teacher; despite a relatively pleasant disposition, she's also somewhat reserved, afraid to provoke Sister Aloysius by not living up to her standards. Consider this moment when all the Sisters eat their dinners in silence--when Sister James takes a bit of food out of her mouth and puts it on the side of her plate, Sister Aloysius gives her a piercing stare, one that says, ""Not in my school, you don't.""Early on, she tells Sister James to be watchful of Father Flynn, who teaches boys' Basketball. It seems he's been spending a lot of time with Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), an alter boy who happens to be the school's only black student. Sister James tells Sister Aloysius about the day he went into the school's rectory alone with Father Flynn; when he came back, his expression was troubling, and worse yet, there was alcohol on his breath. ""So it's happened,"" says Sister Aloysius as if she knew it would happen all along. Thus begins an intense battle of wills, pitting a nun who has nothing but her certainty against a priest who maintains his innocence.The genius of this movie is that tackles religious and authority issues without getting preachy. We're shown only what needs to be shown, and from that, we're asked to make up our own minds. As in any good debate, both sides have their good points and their bad points. Take Father Flynn; he does seem to care about young Donald Miller, a young man who has made no friends and wants the security and guidance of an adult male figure. At the same time, there's a sense that maybe Father Flynn is taking too much of an interest in him and not enough of an interest in other boys. There are many possible reasons for this. It could be as simple as the boy's skin color--because Donald is the only black student, Father Flynn is compelled to give him just a little more attention than his white classmates. Or maybe he pities Donald for being abused by his father, which, for some, would explain the odd expression noticed by Sister James.Now, take Sister Aloysius. One could argue that she's the product of a very different set of values, having been conditioned to believe that teachers are enforcers, not nurturers, and that modern-day conveniences--a handheld transistor radio, for example--hinder a child's ethical development. And after years of seeing priests come and go, it's fair to say that she knows a thing or two about people. That being said, accusing a priest of abuse without proof is serious, perhaps even unwarranted. Sister James believes this to be true. She also has trouble accepting the idea she should look at people with suspicion. ""It feels as if I'm less close to God,"" she pleads. ""When you take a step to address wrongdoing,"" Sister Aloysius replies matter-of-factly, ""you are taking a step away from God, but in His service."" One wonders: Did Torquemada tell himself the same thing?The film's most pivotal scene features a conversation between Sister Aloysius and Donald's mother (Viola Davis), who fears her son's expulsion so strongly that she seems willing to let anything happen to him. ""It's just until June,"" she keeps saying, knowing that graduating from this school will mean access to a better high school. Sister Aloysius is at a loss to understand Mrs. Miller's line of thinking, although I suspect it has less to do with Donald's welfare and more to do with punishing Father Flynn. The emotions running through this scene are raw and intense, a perfect counterpart to the escalating tensions within the walls of the school. They eventually channel themselves to the film's inevitable climax and make it powerful, which is amazing given the fact that, for some, certainty can't be guaranteed. I left the theater feeling no surer than I did entering, which is a testament to the brilliance of Shanley's writing and direction.

By definition, it must be, for it cannot prove its claims and most of what we know about science refutes most of what's said by religion.It is using faith that Sister Alloyicious (Meryl Streep), bases her entire case against a charasmatic new priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He's the embodiment of Vatican 2, and she's... well, probably Mel Gibson's grandmother.The priest is doing things like giving sermons in English, that talk about peace, compassion and tolerace. He's taking sugar in his tea. He's even using a ballpoint pen! His ideas and his way of doing things are vastly different from those of the good Sister, so she's willing to believe, on the slightest, flimsiest theory, that the priest is molesting one of the boys in his care.It's fascinating to watch as she builds up this case in her own mind, eager to believe it is true. She talks with the priest, with the boy's mother (who is, btw, one of the most pragmatic characters I've ever seen on screen), with another nun, with just about everyone, and though everyone defends the priest against her, she refuses to listen, cause she has certainty. She has faith. She has no doubt.The character studies here are fascinating, as are the contrasts in this very important time of the Church's life, as is the rush to judgement and the power of rumor. Merely by raising the suspicion in people's minds that this priest may be molesting a child, she makes it real, no matter if it is or isn't.This is a very good movie and one I'd highly recommend.

1226641,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001PA0FF4,DanD,"[1, 2]","In a 1964 Catholic school, a priest has been accused--by the school's principle--of molesting the only black student.  This is the main plot of DOUBT, though as with any film of this nature, there's much more to it: tolerance, sexism, and yes, doubt in many of its forms.  This creates a slow-moving film that may not be for all viewers; it is a film made to make you think--especially the final confrontation between Streep and Hoffman, and viewers with little patience will come away somewhat disappointed.  That cannot be helped.There is a reason why four of DOUBT's principle actors were nominated for awards: This film is driven by its actors, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.  Hoffman is in strong form as always; Davis, in her too-brief role, is a marvel; Adams proves yet again she is a very reliable actress.  It is, however, Streep who steals the show, diving headlong into the character of a traditional nun who resents the presence of a reform-minded priest.  The actors help the film avoid the many pitfalls--too many dramatic camera angles, a couple of minor subplots that are distracting.  The theme is strong and well-carried out (this film was also nominated for its script, and rightly so), but it is up to the actors to make everything work.  And they do.  If nothing else, DOUBT is proof that there are genuinely talented actors still working in Hollywood, and filmmakers willing to challenge their viewers, even if it means low Box Office receipts and certain audience members getting offended (lets face it, it always happens).",5,Some of the year's most compelling performances.,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,1589,"['1964', 'Catholic', 'school', 'priest', 'been', 'accused', 'school', 'principle', 'molesting', 'only', 'black', 'student', 'main', 'plot', 'DOUBT', 'though', 'film', 'nature', 'much', 'more', 'tolerance', 'sexism', 'yes', 'doubt', 'many', 'forms', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'viewers', 'film', 'made', 'make', 'think', 'especially', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Streep', 'Hoffman', 'viewers', 'little', 'patience', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped.There', 'reason', 'why', 'four', 'DOUBT', 'principle', 'actors', 'were', 'nominated', 'awards', 'film', 'driven', 'actors', 'namely', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Hoffman', 'strong', 'form', 'always', 'Davis', 'too-brief', 'role', 'marvel', 'Adams', 'yet', 'again', 'very', 'reliable', 'actress', 'however', 'Streep', 'who', 'show', 'diving', 'headlong', 'character', 'traditional', 'nun', 'who', 'presence', 'reform-minded', 'priest', 'actors', 'help', 'film', 'avoid', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'too', 'many', 'dramatic', 'camera', 'angles', 'couple', 'minor', 'subplots', 'are', 'distracting', 'theme', 'strong', 'well-carried', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'script', 'rightly', 'so', 'actors', 'make', 'everything', 'work', 'do', 'nothing', 'else', 'DOUBT', 'proof', 'are', 'genuinely', 'talented', 'actors', 'still', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'willing', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'even', 'low', 'Box', 'Office', 'receipts', 'certain', 'audience', 'members', 'getting', 'offended', 'face', 'always']",N/A

Within the first few moments it is clear what the story is about and, there is no doubt about what will happen. The only glimmer of doubt was how explicit would the director be in describing or showing what happened.Details unfolded so slowly. This felt like a movies from the 20's or 30's or a Victorian novel. There was a different viewer dynamic; the director expected people to catch on slowly and fed the plot to the audience crumb by crumb.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep are amazing actors. Mr. Hoffman is one of my favorites. He is very consistent with the role of Father Flynn. Meryl Streep on the other hand, gains and loses that New Jersey / Irish accent frequently throughout this movie. It's sad that Ms. Streep has never been able to maintain a single accent through a movie (Sophie's Choice the most notable). She is a powerful actress, and sometimes that minor inability can be overlooked with her performances. Amy Adams is sweet, and innocent as Sister James. It's a decent performance.I am very sorry for being critical of this film. It really did not connect at all for me. The film is one hour and 45 minutes long. It is almost 45 too long. I think the real downfall was a poor script. Converting a play into a feature length film is a difficult process, what works on the stage rarely works on film; and vice versa. It seems the writer was just not up to the task. I know the Academy loved this film, and it has won many awards.At a certain point, I also didn't much care what happened to any of the characters. The film did not develop a compasion or connection for any of the characters. We know, or think we know, what the priest did; so he is reprehensible. In fact the director makes him all the more awful with the drunken dinner scene juxtaposed against the Nun's serene silent meals. The principal was constantly remprimanding every child in the school; so no love there. The children all seemed to just float along however the wind was blowing. One would act up, another would be good, another would be a teacher's pet... but no real deep character development. Even Donald Miller, the child that is supposed to have been abused, we don't get anywhere near how he feels about things. The children are all just colors in some kind of flat painting. We develop some like or attachment to Sister James, but because she's having trouble with her class; or tormented about what she may or may not have seen. But she's not the central character of the film. I didn't care much of what happened to anyone in the film.Technically, it's a decent job. There are about 6 angled shots where the camera is tilted 45 degrees for no particular reason. The tilt makes no sense at all. The sound was fairly flat. Thunder was about the only thing that delivered surround sound. The rest was all stuck in the front two channels. Dialog was clear. Pacing, this film is all over the map. There are so many framing errors and nonsense shots. It almost seems like they got the film in the can and then had to reshoot aimlessly.So no, can't really recommend this one too highly. If somebody has no idea about the Catholic Church scandals, then maybe they would appreciate this film.

Times are changing and the Catholic Church is becoming more liberal.  This sets the stage for a battle between principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of inappropriate behavior with a student (Joseph Foster II) on very circumstantial evidence and makes it her crusade to remove him from his position.  As she says, she has no proof, but she has her certainty.It is this certainty which seems to make her a monster, as she dismisses each bit of information or alternate interpretation of events that would cast doubt on her belief.  But this would not be such a rich film if writer / director John Patrick Shanley had made it that simple.  The viewer is never given satisfactory ground for completely siding with either the sister or the father.  While it is very clear that Sister Aloysius is very rigid, cold, and judgmental, it is also possible that she is right.  I admire the way Shanley encourages us to think about the issues raised and draw our own conclusions, which is why I was very disappointed in the final moments of this film, in which Shanley makes explicit a element of his theme that would have been better left understated, ending his script on a rather jarring note.

1226647,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001PA0FF4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","Amazing performances from Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis.  `DOUBT' is a thought provoking film that leaves you feeling a bit unsettled at the film's end.""DOUBT"" is a film based on the Tony Award winning play ""Doubt: A Parable"" by John Patrick Shanley.  The play was so successful would take the popular play and bring it to the big screen and Shanley would be the screen writer and director.Eventually, the film struck a chord with critics as ""DOUBT"" received five Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress Amy Adams and Viola Davis and Best Adapted Screenplay (John Patrick Shanley).  And after watching the film, you realize that this film and the talents are definitely deserving of each of those nominations.VIDEO & AUDIO:""DOUBT"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  The picture quality is very good as you can see the pores on the skin of Philip Seymour Hoffman, so it is done quite well.  But the film is mostly shot indoors.  The colors are not so vibrant as the sisters and Father Flynn are typically wearing black and white.  The school is featured in shades of brown and when shots are done outdoors, skies are gray and definitely not scenes that showcase much colors.  In a way, there is a sort of darkness when watching the film, even though it is a film that takes place in a Catholic school.Cinematography courtesy of the talent Director of Photography Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and many more), Deakins knows how to capture a mood and since he is one of my favorite DP's, he manages to capture light and dark moods of the film.As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  One thing that really came out quite well through my system in hearing the various soundtrack in DTS-HD is the music.  From the choir to the score, it comes out quite clear during the film.  For the most part, the film is dialogue-based.  Dialogue is clear but this is not a film to expect major usage of your rear channels.SPECIAL FEATURES:""DOUBT"" comes with several informative special features:* From Stage to Screen--(19:06) An intimate discussion with playwright, screenwriter and director John Patrick Shanley about the history of ""Doubt"", including his inspirations for the story, the acclaim the play's Broadway run received, the Pulitzer Prize and the process of adapting it for the screen. Joining the conversation are Meryl Streep and Sister Margaret McEntee (a consultant on the film and Shanley's former teacher).* Scoring Doubt--(4:37) Renowned composer Howard Shore discusses his inspiration for the music in the film and his collaboration with both John Patrick Shanley and producer Scott Rudin.* The Sisters of Charity--(6:28) In an insightful and lively dialogue, Meryl Streep and John Patrick Shanley discuss the interviews that Shanley did before shooting with real nuns to discuss their lives and make sure they would be accurately portrayed in the film.* Feature Commentary with John Patrick Shanley - (103 minutes) For the commentary, we get a bit of insight of John Patrick Shanley's experience of going to a Catholic school in the Bronx and trying to utilize what he remembers and making it come to life on film.  Shanley talks about the various talent, various scenes and how certain shots came about.* The Cast of Doubt-- (13:30) Ew.com's discussion with actors Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis.  A fun and insightful conversation with the talent and their feeling about the film and if the critics would get it.JUDGMENT CALL:""DOUBT"" is a thought provoking film.  Taking what we have seen in the last decade with certain pastors accused and having gotten away for child molestation, ""DOUBT"" tries to show viewers that even back in 1964, a perspective of how this was happening and despite some people having doubts about a priest and a few of those individuals with a close relationship with the younger altar boys, what makes this film much more entertaining is watching Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman really going off each other and both delivering powerful performances.Meryl Streep's transformation to Sister Aloysius is just impressive and her ability to project intimidation to even the viewer showcases her multiple-award winning talent.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is just a man who is well liked but to Sister Aloysius, it's about how far she will go to use her intimidation against him.  But as intimidating as she is to the Father.  The truth is that the system and hierarchy of how things are handled in the church reside in the leadership of men, not so much towards the women.  So, Hoffman then engages in intimidation towards Sister Aloysius.  Needless to say, the exchange between both individuals is quite powerful.  Which one of these individuals engages in their own perfidy?The other impressive performances go to Amy Adams as Sister Jane.  She exhibits innocence, purity and someone trying to comprehend why Sister Aloysius is the way she is and if she can possibly bring something new to the school with her warmer style.  Unfortunately, this style is similar to Father Flynn's and a style that Sister Aloysius is against.  So, to see the fear and intimidation that the Sister Jane is feeling is well projected by Adams.And Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller.  Despite having only several minutes on screen, her performance as a mother who has seen her son tormented and defeated, beaten and made to feel as an outcast, is willing to let him allegedly be in the companionship of the father, because he is the only person that has been there to protect him.  Twisted logic it may be, but considering the time this film takes place and that he was the sole Black person being integrated into the school, you feel sympathy for Mrs. Douglas but at the same time feel a bit disgusted.  Nevertheless, Viola Davis really did a great job portraying the mother in this film.""DOUBT"" is indeed a powerful and though provoking film.  The final minutes leave you feeling a bit unsettled.  But the film is indeed a pleasure to watch because of the power of the performances by the four key talents of the film.They made their characters so believable and because of that, ""DOUBT"" was able to flourish into this intriguing and gripping film.  By the end of the film, you have no doubt in your mind that Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis were definitely deserving of their Academy Award nominations.

1226648,ATA980NJ3OSZT,B001PA0FF4,Dennis at Holy Apostles,"[0, 0]","""Doubt"" is an intriguing film that features strong acting performances.  Set in a pre-Vatican II, inner-city Catholic church and school, ""Doubt"" creates a tension for the viewer that does not end with the last scene.  In no way is this film predictable.  While it may seem that Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is overreacting, the thought of a priest molesting a child already inhabits the Catholic psyche of 1964, the time setting of this film.  That puts it well before the public scandals of the last 25 years.  Any way you cut it, no well-grounded suspicion ought to be dismissed, then or now.

1226649,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B001PA0FF4,Dennis Littrell,"[0, 0]","[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]The doubt is on two levels.  One, there is the doubt that Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) molested the boy.  The deeper doubt is that if he did, did he do anything wrong?  Or on an even deeper level, did the wrong that he did outweigh the good that he did?  This last question is at the very heart of the relationship between priests and boys in the near contemporary American society depicted in this film.Personally I don't believe that the ephemeral culture in which we live can answer that question.  Perhaps it is true that people like Father Flynn are compelled to do good in this world for just those boys who most need them because of their ""nature"" (as Meryl Streep's character Sister Aloysius puts it).  Science has a lot of trouble accounting for homosexuality, and understandably most scientists aren't interested in exploring why some men are sexually attracted to boys.  The truth from an evolutionary point of view must be that in some sense that attraction leads to, paradoxically, a better fit for not only the boy, which is obvious in some circumstances, but also for the man.  How can this be?  Most theories about homosexuality invoke male bonding as the evolutionary force that makes the behavior adaptive.  Homosexual males bond with other males (homosexual or not) and thereby increase their access to females.  So great is the advantage that accrues to such males that even the homosexual males (who mate only to have offspring) have an adaptive advantage over outsider males.But what is the adaptive advantage to males who are sexually attracted only to boys?In a way this film (and the direction by John Patrick Shanley based on his play) actually addresses this question.  The answer comes from the scene in which Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller) talk and walk.  The mother clearly sees that whether her boy is getting molested by the priest or not is secondary to the fact that the priest cares about him more than his father.  In other words (and most specifically in other circumstances) the priest would become the ally of the mother and they would bond.  In a world far removed from ours, in the prehistory, they might become as one.  Or in a world removed from the celibacy of the priesthood he would love the boy and the mother and she would love him and sex would happen, although perhaps not as frequently as it would if the man were heterosexual.  Certainly he is a better man for the boy and for any further boys than a father who would beat his son.Meryl Streep who has given us so many brilliant performances gives yet another one here.  And Hoffman ditto.  I have said it before and I'll repeat it, Meryl Streep is nearly flawless in everything she does.  Philip Seymour Hoffman ditto.  To see two of the greatest actors of our time in the same film is quite a treat.  To give them such indelible characters to work with and such a compelling story to act out is really wonderful.  And I must say that Amy Adams who played Sister James was also excellent and was not noticeably overshadowed by Streep and Hoffman.  Viola Davis who played the one scene as the boy's mother was also excellent.The movie starts slowly as in a play, which it is. This is allowable since the play-going audience has an investment and won't get up even if the first act goes slowly.

Fallen into the hands of lesser performers, Doubt would have been long and draggy. However, the stellar cast headed by Meryl Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis is superb.From the very first scne where the no-nonsense and rigid Sister Aloysius Beauvier invokes fear in the kids attending Father Flynn's sermons, you know it will be one hell of a show. There's a lot of dialogue and at no time, you have clear evidence of the perpetrator's crime but the dramatic and extremely heated exchange between Streep and Hoffman in her office proves to us why Streep is one of the best actresses this century and why Hoffman won an Oscar a few years back. Amy Adams as Sister James is both precocious and perhaps the only one with doubt that Sister Aloysius is right in her accusations. Of course, the other scene stealer is Viola Davis with her short but impactful appearance as the mother of the boy victim (akin to Judi Dench's 8-minute run in Shakespeare in Love).Doubt is unquestionably one of the best films of 2008.

Is she simply someone who demands lifeless rigidity in her routine, stricking horror in the Catholic students, or is she relentless in her need to protect the children and demand the truth?Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)leaves you doubting, as well.

No one knows the full extent of the problem, but some estimates claim as many as 5% of Catholic clergy have been involved, and as of 2004 more than 10,000 victims had come forward with allegations against more than 4,000 Priests.Films have rarely addressed this troubling topic. Documentaries on the subject include ""Deliver Us From Evil"" (2006) and ""Sex Crimes and the Vatican"" (2006). Feature films include ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" (1992) which takes place in Canada, ""The Magdalene Sisters"" (2002) which takes place in Ireland, ""Song for a Raggy Boy"" (2003) which takes place in Spain""Doubt"" is a 2008 adaptation of the Pulitizer Prize winning semi-autobiographical play of the same name by John Patrick Shanley (1950).Time: 1964. Place: The BronxPhilip Seymour Hoffman (1967) plays a priest suspected of child abuse. Hoffman was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won once (""Capote"").Meryl Streep (1949) plays a nun and the principal of the school attached to the diocese when Hoffman preaches. Streep was nominated for an Oscar 16 times and won for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" (1979) and ""Sophie's Choice"" (1982),Beautiful and feisty Amy Adams (1974) plays a new teacher. Adams was nominated for an Oscar 3 times, for ""Junebug"" (2005), ""Doubt"" (2008), and ""The Fighter"" (2010).Viola Davis (1965) plays the child's mother. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this film. Primarily a TV actress, her previous film credits include ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Antoine Fisher"" (2002), and ""Solaris"" (2002). She has a recurring role as Molly Crane in the ""Jesse Stone"" TV movies.Joseph Foster plays the suspected victim. This was his second film.Writer and Director Shanley is primarily a writer. On his 12 screenplays, he won an Oscar for his screenplay ""Moonstruck"" (1987) and also wrote ""Joe Vs. the Volcano"" (1990) and ""Congo"" (1995). His only previous directing was ""Joe vs. the Volcano"".Roger Deakins (1949) is the cinematographer for more than half of the Coen Brothers films, including ""Fargo"", ""O Brother..."", and ""No Country..."" He accumulated 9 Oscar nominations but no wins.The film was nominated for 5 Oscars (Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Screenplay) but didn't win any. It was universally praised by critics, but did poorly at the box office, earning a half million dollars on its opening weekend despite a budget in excess of $20 million. Total domestic gross was $30+ million placing it at a rank of 1810.The top grossing films in 2008 were ""The Dark Knight"", ""Indiana Jones Crystal Skull"", ""Kung Fu Panda"", ""Hancock"", and ""Mamma Mia"". The big Oscar winner was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (Picture, Director, Screenplay).There's not a lot of action in this film, and indeed there is lots and lots of dialogue, sometimes extending beyond 10 minutes. This is clearly a ""thinking"" person's film and it will be of interest to people who enjoy that type of film. As one of the few films to deal with the issue of child abuse in the Catholic church, it is a really important film, and the endless debating about what is and isn't true and what can and can't be known is a really valuable education. However, this subject matter and the nature of the film itself will not give it universal appeal. OTOH, if you've ever had any question about whether or not to report a someone for something you think they did, this might be a very important film for you to view.PS - My grade of a 3 reflects the film as a general film.

The year is 1964, and Sister Aloysius runs her Bronx school, St. Nicholas, with an iron fist.  The children cower before her icy glare, and when she smiles, which is rare, her face fails to light up very much.  She hates newfangled inventions such as ball point pens and is constantly criticizing the girls and boys for minor offenses.  When Sister James, a young, pretty, and naive teacher, suggests that Father Brendan Flynn may be paying too much attention to the school's only black student, Donald Miller, Beauvier launches a crusade to oust Flynn.Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Father Flynn, a charismatic priest who coaches the basketball team, instructs the altar boys, and delivers brief but meaningful sermons from the pulpit.  He stands for everything that Sister Aloysius disdains:  embracing change, showing kindness and empathy, and reaching out to others with love.  However, he did leave his previous two parishes under mysterious circumstances, and although she has no hard evidence, Sister Aloysius feels certain that Father Flynn has done something wrong.  She urges him to bare his soul and confess his misdeeds.  He furiously denies any wrongdoing and chastises her for being rigid and coldblooded.The script, which Shanley adapted from his stage play, is a bit too heavy-handed.  A metaphor about gossip being like runaway feathers from a pillow is accompanied by a shot of a woman watching the feathers she has released flying all over the street.  In addition, Meryl Streep plays the forbidding Sister Aloysius with a stiffness that is almost robot-like.  When she finally unleashes her wrath at Hoffman, her lack of control seems extreme and out of character.  Amy Adams is fine as a sweet nun who is in a quandary.  Should she follow her own instincts or model herself after the confident Sister Aloysius?  Hoffman's Father Flynn has such a good heart that, since there is no proof to the contrary, you want to believe in his innocence.  Viola Davis, as Donald Miller's mother, is outstanding in a short but pivotal scene.  As she walks along with Sister Aloysius, the nun voices her suspicions about Father Flynn and is shocked when Mrs. Miller reacts in a way that the nun had not anticipated.Shanley tackles a number of important themes:  how the civil rights movement affected all-white schools, the ways in which the ""old boy"" network of priests may have shielded miscreants, and the corrosive nature of mistrust.  Was Father Flynn actually guilty of anything?  We can never know the full truth about his behavior, a fact that even the arrogant Sister Aloysius must acknowledge in a rare moment of humanity.",4,"""Where is your compassion?""",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2750,"['Doubt', 'written', 'directed', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Beauvier', 'year', '1964', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Bronx', 'school', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'iron', 'fist', 'children', 'cower', 'icy', 'glare', 'when', 'rare', 'face', 'light', 'up', 'very', 'much', 'newfangled', 'inventions', 'such', 'ball', 'point', 'pens', 'constantly', 'criticizing', 'girls', 'boys', 'minor', 'offenses', 'When', 'Sister', 'James', 'young', 'pretty', 'naive', 'teacher', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'Flynn', 'may', 'be', 'paying', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'school', 'only', 'black', 'student', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'Beauvier', 'crusade', 'oust', 'Flynn.Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'excellent', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'charismatic', 'priest', 'who', 'basketball', 'team', 'altar', 'delivers', 'brief', 'meaningful', 'sermons', 'pulpit', 'everything', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'embracing', 'change', 'showing', 'kindness', 'empathy', 'reaching', 'out', 'others', 'love', 'However', 'did', 'leave', 'previous', 'two', 'parishes', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'feels', 'certain', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'bare', 'soul', 'confess', 'misdeeds', 'furiously', 'wrongdoing', 'being', 'rigid', 'coldblooded.The', 'script', 'Shanley', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'bit', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'metaphor', 'gossip', 'being', 'runaway', 'feathers', 'pillow', 'accompanied', 'shot', 'woman', 'watching', 'feathers', 'released', 'flying', 'street', 'addition', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'forbidding', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'stiffness', 'almost', 'robot-like', 'When', 'finally', 'wrath', 'Hoffman', 'lack', 'control', 'extreme', 'character', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'fine', 'sweet', 'nun', 'who', 'quandary', 'Should', 'follow', 'own', 'instincts', 'model', 'confident', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Hoffman', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'good', 'heart', 'proof', 'contrary', 'want', 'believe', 'innocence', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'mother', 'outstanding', 'short', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'nun', 'voices', 'suspicions', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'shocked', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'way', 'nun', 'had', 'not', 'anticipated.Shanley', 'tackles', 'number', 'important', 'themes', 'how', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'affected', 'all-white', 'schools', 'ways', 'old', 'boy', 'network', 'priests', 'may', 'have', 'shielded', 'miscreants', 'corrosive', 'nature', 'mistrust', 'Was', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'actually', 'guilty', 'anything', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'full', 'truth', 'behavior', 'fact', 'even', 'arrogant', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'must', 'acknowledge', 'rare', 'moment', 'humanity']",N/A
1226661,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001PA0FF4,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Director/writer John Patrick Shanley measures the quality of mercy in his uncommonly well-crafted 2008 adaptation of his 2004 Broadway hit. One can imagine how well his intimate story must have played onstage as a four-actor chamber piece since the vivid personal interactions raise large questions about morality and organized religion. The title refers to the religious doubt that results when faith is not enough to reconcile suspicion with intellectual certainty. The subject of doubt is a popular priest who could be violating his position of trust and power. The question then becomes whether the severity of an accusation is enough to convict someone of wrongdoing and how the accuser must live with the consequences of raising doubt among others without the burden of proof.The story takes place in 1964, a year after Kennedy's assassination, in a non-segregated Bronx Catholic school. It's a time of great tumult in the church with the Second Vatican sweeping in reforms that prove unsettling to old-school Catholics like Sister Aloysius, the strict school principal who terrorizes the students with her mean-spirited, iron hand tactics. She is offended by ballpoint pens, too much sugar in others' tea, and the possible use ofFrosty The Snowmanin the holiday pageant. Her adversary is also her immediate superior, Father Flynn, a compassionate young priest who is fully immersed in the daily life of his congregation, particularly with the schoolboys whom he coaches in basketball and in life's lessons. She is suspicious of his motives, and when Sister James, an innocent novice, reports that one of her students, Donald Miller, returned from a meeting with the priest behaving strangely, Sister Aloysius becomes determined to remove him from his post.What Shanley does particularly well with this set-up is ensure we never know the true story and whether Sister Aloysius' assumptions are based in hard evidence. The ensemble cast is superior. It becomes redundant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse. She infuses her vinegary character with welcome humor. As Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to bring enough ambiguity to the priest to make the suspicions palpable, while Amy Adams plays Sister James with her natural perkiness toned down to reflect her character's questioning conscience. As Donald's anguished mother, Viola Davis blazes with quiet authority in an impressive face-off with Sister Aloysius that ends with an unsettling revelation. Shanley brings out all the dramaturgy of his work with full gale force and does not shy away from the dark, somber theme. It's just a good thing the actors make it intensely involving as well.",4,The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strained in This Compelling Actors' Showcase,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2814,"['Director/writer', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'quality', 'mercy', 'uncommonly', 'well-crafted', '2008', 'adaptation', '2004', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'One', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'well', 'intimate', 'story', 'must', 'have', 'played', 'onstage', 'four-actor', 'chamber', 'piece', 'vivid', 'personal', 'interactions', 'raise', 'large', 'questions', 'morality', 'organized', 'religion', 'title', 'refers', 'religious', 'doubt', 'results', 'when', 'faith', 'not', 'enough', 'reconcile', 'suspicion', 'intellectual', 'certainty', 'subject', 'doubt', 'popular', 'priest', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'violating', 'position', 'trust', 'power', 'question', 'then', 'severity', 'accusation', 'enough', 'convict', 'someone', 'wrongdoing', 'how', 'accuser', 'must', 'live', 'consequences', 'raising', 'doubt', 'others', 'burden', 'proof.The', 'story', 'place', '1964', 'year', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'non-segregated', 'Bronx', 'Catholic', 'school', 'time', 'great', 'tumult', 'church', 'Second', 'Vatican', 'sweeping', 'reforms', 'prove', 'unsettling', 'old-school', 'Catholics', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'strict', 'school', 'principal', 'who', 'students', 'mean-spirited', 'iron', 'hand', 'tactics', 'offended', 'ballpoint', 'pens', 'too', 'much', 'sugar', 'others', 'tea', 'possible', 'use', 'Snowmanin', 'holiday', 'pageant', 'adversary', 'also', 'immediate', 'superior', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'compassionate', 'young', 'priest', 'who', 'fully', 'immersed', 'daily', 'life', 'congregation', 'particularly', 'schoolboys', 'whom', 'basketball', 'life', 'lessons', 'suspicious', 'motives', 'when', 'Sister', 'James', 'innocent', 'novice', 'one', 'students', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'returned', 'meeting', 'priest', 'behaving', 'strangely', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'determined', 'remove', 'post.What', 'Shanley', 'particularly', 'well', 'set-up', 'ensure', 'never', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'assumptions', 'are', 'based', 'hard', 'evidence', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'superior', 'redundant', 'praise', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'bring', 'ardent', 'fervor', 'unapologetic', 'small-mindedness', 'formidable', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'convincing', 'accent', 'way', 'Grand', 'Concourse', 'vinegary', 'character', 'welcome', 'humor', 'Flynn', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'bring', 'enough', 'ambiguity', 'priest', 'make', 'suspicions', 'palpable', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Sister', 'James', 'natural', 'perkiness', 'toned', 'down', 'reflect', 'character', 'questioning', 'conscience', 'Donald', 'anguished', 'mother', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'quiet', 'authority', 'impressive', 'face-off', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'unsettling', 'revelation', 'Shanley', 'out', 'dramaturgy', 'work', 'full', 'gale', 'force', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'dark', 'somber', 'theme', 'just', 'good', 'thing', 'actors', 'make', 'intensely', 'involving', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1226662,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001PA0FF4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","NOTE: There is an update of interest at the end of this review. DOUBT has a potent albeit badly delivered message; it has stellar performances that nonetheless come too close to caricature. It is always unwise to attempt to insert levity where levity is not welcome.Meryl Streep's turn as Sister-Mother-Superior-Wannabe Aloysius (correct spelling is Aloisius by the bye) is simultaneously shocking, powerful and silly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the beleaguered (and probably guilty) Father Flynn is a character study worthy of Spencer Tracy. He has his dark side and dark moments.What are we, the audience, supposed to doubt? Streep's sanity? Hoffman's sincerity? Didn't the sweet, angelic Sr. James (Amy Adams) steal the show completely? Did Father Flynn abuse young Donald Miller (played beautifully by Joseph Foster II and miscredited at the end as ""Daniel Miller"")? Was he merely protecting young Donald? Did he identify with young Donald's emerging gayness (something Donald's mother clearly discloses to Streep)?Will the question marks ever end??In a way, this film is sheer insanity-in-the-making. A wicked witch of a nun, overburdened as a school's principal, automatically hates and suspects the young priest working at the school. She's out to get him, because she can smell a rat at a hundred paces. Yet as I discovered years later, she was right.There really is something awful, something 'funny', about Father Flynn. His nails really are too long. He resents the Church and its Medievalism. He dislikes the principal for her very crumbly old-fashioned ways. When confronted, he seems innocent and purely motivated. That is, until his facade begins to crack in an ugly way, and we see a guilty, evasive criminal-type. It's a type I know well among the clergy of the Catholic Church.We know the era of pedophile priests had begun to emerge into the public eye at this time, the late 1960s. So, did the priest victimize a ready-made victim, the only black child in the school? Or did he love this child a bit more than he loved the others? Was he merely protecting young Donald? The film, in my renewed opinion, holds the key.Actually, I know a bit more than the average audience. The actors in the film, as well as the direction of the original play, suggest Father Flynn is innocent and Sister Aloysius is a goofy old bat who has gone nuts. She targets Fr. Flynn as the root of all evil, which is actually a root growing wildly in her own head. And by the way, the play - and the actors here - seem to agree that Fr. Flynn is totally innocent.Here's what we all know: nasty looks shot at Fr. Flynn by certain students (BIG clue, thanks a lot). In fact, the little bastard who smiles at the news that Fr. Flynn is leaving gives us nothing - precisely because he's a little bastard.We know the goofy old nun is checking out the priest, investigating his past. We know she's willing to manually explode her rosary into tiny pieces in her crusade to ""get"" Fr. Flynn and chase him from the school. And we know he has a guilty past, which he declares is in the past for good. What we do not know is what precisely happened, what trouble he caused or why he felt the guilt.Like a very bad mystery, this film reveals little. Nothing but Sr. Aloysius' ""doubts"" - and I still ask myself, ""What?? What does she doubt?"", because we are never told what it is she doubts. I thought she simply began to doubt the very existence of God.My wife thought she was doubting her own faith. Also, I had initially thought she was doubting whether she did the right thing in going after Flynn, except that she was confident, glad and showed no remorse. Now I wonder if she was doubting the goodness of the Church, since Flynn is simply reassigned after all her hard work.There is one undercurrent that occurred to me that is not mentioned: the very real damage the Church has inflicted on its clergy. Both Sr. Aloysius and Fr. Flynn can be called victims. God knows what created a beast like Sr. Aloysius. Wounded animals trying to survive, like the Fathers Flynn, are so well known we pretend we don't see them in that light.Flynn comes into this film with unclean hands, and we are shown plenty of hard evidence of that. This in turn made me wonder whose idea it was to rob him of his original innocence, evident in the play. Hoffman's characterization reminded me of the infamous Father Murphy, who molested all those deaf boys in Milwaukee. So maybe the doubt is whether or how long the Chruch will last being run by aiders and abettors.UPDATE, FEBRUARY 2013: The announcement of the upcoming abdication of Pope Benedict XVI, plus a stunning documentary about the Catholic Church's worldwide pedophile scandal, set me to rethinking this film. After all, a crime against humanity is a crime against humanity.This film's facts ultimately must be in the eyes of the beholder. However, I think sadly enough there's concrete condemnation of Flynn here. He gives off all the signs, all the red flags go up and the crazy old nun doesn't seem quite so crazy in light of this. After all, Sister Aloysius makes a few startling discoveries about Father Flynn during her discreetly placed phone calls.Flynn's been shunted to the school - at the end he is shunted elsewhere and that speaks volumes. So I see a more profound message in this film than I ever realized up til now: it is a warning, an early-warning story if you like, about the building storm that was already very old at the time in which this film is set. The crazy old nun was fighting for her church, a church she pictured as disappearing in the near future.She was right.If you want to know all about the real-life problems, I highly recommend the bookThe Case of the Pope: Vatican Accountability for Human Rights Abuseby Judge Geoffrey Robertson QC, human rights attorney and Queen's Counsel.",3,"When in Doubt, Call the Exorcist!!",1254614400,"10

I was intrigued by the premise of a priest suspected of impropriety with an altar boy, but also put off by this subject that's been in headlines for the past decade. My wife and I finally decided to give it a chance, and we were both blown away by the story's layers, themes, and stellar acting on the parts of all involved.""Doubt"" is not a movie to provide easy answers. It sets out to uncover our prejudices and assumptions, our rigid rules, and then upsets them with a powerful story of an accused priest and the accusing Sister of Mercy, the principal of a small school in the Bronx. Between these two opponents, played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep, a kind-hearted nun provides the warmth this film needs. Amy Adams is amazing in this part, bringing depth despite the restraint required in the role. Rounding out the ensemble cast, Viola Davis plays the role of the altar boy's mother with empathy, depth, and heartrending honesty.The film opens with a sermon about doubt and its ability to strengthen. Throughout the film, our own doubts are stirred. We're made uncomfortable. We must think through our initial suspicions, realizing that many of life's situations require us to act even when we are not sure about something. How can a principal ignore the welfare of her own student? On the other hand, how can a well-meaning priest be blackmailed without any apparent evidence? These are only the first of many questions to be answered, and yet ""Doubt"" refuses to offer up easy explanations, instead requiring us to ponder these themes and come to our own conclusions.I loved the uncertainties of this film. With incredible acting and sure-handed directing, ""Doubt"" proves that not all American films are about car chases and explosions, that not all moviegoers check out their brains as they enter the theater. The villains and heroes are not always who we expect, and even those watching this film might disagree on who filled those stereotypical roles.

1226664,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B001PA0FF4,e. verrillo,"[1, 1]","Doubt is an extremely thoughtful, atmospheric and well made movie that really should have made more of an impression than it did.  While I enjoyed watching it, I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something. That ""something"" probably had a little to do with the adaptation, but quite a bit more to do with a flaw in the general conceptualization of the film.The themes of this film are wide-ranging: conflicts in the Church between old style Catholics and progressive Vatican II Catholics, faith versus doubt, de-segregation and the struggle of African Americans to have a future, innocence versus corruption, the persecution of those who are perceived as ""different,"" and mortal sin (pedophilia). While all of these rather weighty issues were essential to the the film, none were completely played out. Instead they simply competed with one another, each one jostling for attention.The characters were also under-developed. Father Flynn's progressive ""threat"" was never adequately demonstrated. (A single conflict over ""Frosty the Snowman"" did not suffice.) His sermons, which should have been the bully pulpit from which he rained progressive fire, were lackluster, mumbled affairs. Flynn's nemesis, Sister Aloysius, remained a two-dimensional character throughout the film, hardly showing a crack in her armor. The guileless Sister James had about as much substance as a jellyfish, and the person who should have occupied center stage, the young boy who Father Flynn had allegedly developed ""feelings"" for, was largely ignored. In short, none of the characters were adequately developed or entirely convincing (with one exception).To be fair, there were some fine dramatic moments. Viola Davis, who plays the boy's mother, gave a searing, if short, performance. (And one that put everyone else to shame.) The final confrontation between the tortured Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's one opportunity to actually do some acting) and Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) was brilliant. But there were too many other moments that effectively drained the intensity from a movie that should have left the audience biting their nails. The final scene was not just thoroughly out of character for Sister Aloysius, it was a cop-out. Not only did the ending fail to resolve the main plot, it didn't resolve any of the multiple issues that were brought up in the context of the movie. It was a weak, left-field ending for a film that promised much but delivered little.",3,"Nicely made, but unfocused",1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,2470,"['Doubt', 'extremely', 'thoughtful', 'atmospheric', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'impression', 'did', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'something', 'probably', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'adaptation', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'do', 'flaw', 'general', 'conceptualization', 'film.The', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'wide-ranging', 'conflicts', 'Church', 'old', 'style', 'Catholics', 'progressive', 'Vatican', 'II', 'Catholics', 'faith', 'versus', 'doubt', 'de-segregation', 'struggle', 'African', 'Americans', 'have', 'future', 'innocence', 'versus', 'corruption', 'persecution', 'who', 'are', 'perceived', 'different', 'mortal', 'sin', 'pedophilia', 'rather', 'weighty', 'issues', 'were', 'essential', 'film', 'none', 'were', 'completely', 'played', 'out', 'Instead', 'simply', 'competed', 'one', 'one', 'jostling', 'attention.The', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'under-developed', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'progressive', 'threat', 'was', 'never', 'adequately', 'demonstrated', 'single', 'conflict', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'did', 'not', 'suffice', 'sermons', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bully', 'pulpit', 'rained', 'progressive', 'fire', 'were', 'lackluster', 'mumbled', 'affairs', 'Flynn', 'nemesis', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'remained', 'two-dimensional', 'character', 'film', 'hardly', 'showing', 'crack', 'armor', 'guileless', 'Sister', 'James', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'substance', 'jellyfish', 'person', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'occupied', 'center', 'stage', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'had', 'allegedly', 'developed', 'feelings', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'short', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'adequately', 'developed', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'one', 'exception', '.To', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'boy', 'mother', 'gave', 'searing', 'short', 'performance', 'one', 'put', 'everyone', 'else', 'shame', 'final', 'confrontation', 'tortured', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'one', 'opportunity', 'actually', 'do', 'acting', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'brilliant', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'moments', 'effectively', 'drained', 'intensity', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'audience', 'biting', 'nails', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'thoroughly', 'character', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'was', 'cop-out', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'ending', 'fail', 'resolve', 'main', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'multiple', 'issues', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'context', 'movie', 'was', 'weak', 'left-field', 'ending', 'film', 'promised', 'much', 'delivered', 'little']",N/A

It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast, here cast in roles counter to their usual types, bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines.The story is well known by now (the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the 'doubt ' that brings into play in every character), but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is.

We looked up to these Priests.The true Heriones of this Era to me were The Sisters of Charity. They were often strict but they gave children like me enough basic education to at least get them through life. I think they must have known that many children would have to go to work early and that Higher eduction in some cases was not an option. It is shocking, in this day and age, to see the subordinate role that women in the Church were reduced to occupying. Priests could smoke Tobacco and consume Alcoholic beverages. Women could not. The womens' lives were rigorous, demanding and demeaning.Sure, there were some people in my school who didn't belong anywhere near children; Crabby old Sister Cecilia and that old Drunken Father Finn. I hated them, but every barrel has its rotten apples.The performances in this film are wonderful. Meryl Streep is downright amazing! Is there any role that she cannot play?  So many people have written that Sister Aloysius is a terrible person. I disagree. She's strict, but she takes her responsibilities seriously. Who does she remind me of? All of the nuns I have ever known! I caught a few slaps in my day,but, not as many as some of my peers. One would not dare to hit back! You didn't even tell your folks. They would ask ""What did you do?"" and if you fessed up, you would get more from your parents. It was an old-fashioned way of instilling discipline, but, it worked, in most cases.Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a gentler character. He didn't stand out on the first viewing, but on the second, he held his own quite nicely.The big Revelation to me was the performance of lovely Amy Adams. I remember a young nun very much like the nun Amy plays in this movie. Her name was Sister Teresa. She was sweet and gentle. She was everybody's favorite.I have no idea what the Clergy was like in private or how they behaved toward each other in private. To the best of my memory, the Sisters went back to the Convent after Class (where they also ran an orphanage). It seems that all they ever did was work and pray.The Priests had their own Residence. If the Priests and nuns interacted, I know nothing about it.SPOILER ALERT:As most of you know, this movie concerns itself with the possibility that one of the Priests may be molesting one of the Children under his care. Sister Aloysius is determined to drive the Priest away. Would a nun challenge a Priest under normal circumstances? Certainly not! Would a nun challenge a Priest under the circumstances presented in the Movie? I think this nun would do just that. She is the Principal and therefore the protector of the children in her charge.You'll have to see the movie to see how it all plays out.A number of years ago, I met a very kind middle-aged woman. Even without that ugly habit, I knew at once that she was a nun. As it turns out, she was a member of the Order of The Sisters of Charity. She said that it had been rough sledding for the order in recent years. Vocations had fallen off and most of the sisters were old. I hope they survive. Society will miss them more than it knows if they should disband.I will always miss them and I will always love them.If you were raised as a Roman Catholic, see this movie.",5,A Trip Back in time.,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,4581,"['Loved', 'Movie', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'religious', 'anymore', 'was', 'raised', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'was', 'schooled', 'complex', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'one', 'depicted', 'movie.Mr', 'Shanley', 'appear', 'be', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'went', 'school', 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'entire', 'setting', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'memories', 'past', 'great', 'small', 'thought', 'had', 'forgotten', 'were', 'NEVER', 'touch', 'person', 'Nun', 'Ball', 'Point', 'pens', 'were', 'verbotten', 'movie', 'why', 'Christmas', 'was', 'birth', 'Savior', 'Not', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'remember', 'Altar', 'Boy', 'getting', 'up', 'serve', 'Mass', '5:00AM', 'Day', 'Priests', 'were', 'part', 'teaching', 'order', 'was', 'improper', 'say', 'Mass', 'server', 'probably', 'not', 'former', 'Altar', 'Boy', 'alive', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'time', 'nick', 'little', 'taste', 'Altar', 'Wine.I', 'can', 'assure', 'Catholic', 'Priest', 'mind', 'ever', 'even', 'suggested', 'anything', 'sexual', 'nature', 'Not', 'ever', 'not', 'even', 'once', 'When', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'casting', 'Doubt', 'many', 'children', 'were', 'molested', 'decades', 'am', 'only', 'saying', 'never', 'happened', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'ugly', 'child.The', 'Priests', 'were', 'surrogate', 'Fathers', 'who', 'had', 'absentee', 'fathers', 'who', 'preferred', 'booze', 'nurturing', 'children', 'looked', 'up', 'Priests.The', 'true', 'Heriones', 'Era', 'were', 'Sisters', 'Charity', 'were', 'often', 'strict', 'gave', 'children', 'enough', 'basic', 'education', 'least', 'get', 'life', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'many', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'work', 'early', 'Higher', 'eduction', 'cases', 'was', 'not', 'option', 'shocking', 'day', 'age', 'see', 'subordinate', 'role', 'women', 'Church', 'were', 'reduced', 'occupying', 'Priests', 'could', 'smoke', 'Tobacco', 'consume', 'Alcoholic', 'beverages', 'Women', 'could', 'not', 'womens', 'lives', 'were', 'rigorous', 'demanding', 'demeaning.Sure', 'were', 'people', 'school', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'anywhere', 'children', 'Crabby', 'old', 'Sister', 'Cecilia', 'old', 'Drunken', 'Father', 'Finn', 'hated', 'barrel', 'rotten', 'apples.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'downright', 'amazing', 'there', 'role', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'terrible', 'person', 'disagree', 'strict', 'responsibilities', 'seriously', 'Who', 'remind', 'nuns', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'caught', 'few', 'slaps', 'day', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'peers', 'One', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'hit', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'folks', 'would', 'ask', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'fessed', 'up', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'parents', 'was', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'instilling', 'discipline', 'worked', 'most', 'cases.Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'gentler', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'held', 'own', 'quite', 'nicely.The', 'big', 'Revelation', 'was', 'performance', 'lovely', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'remember', 'young', 'nun', 'very', 'much', 'nun', 'Amy', 'movie', 'name', 'was', 'Sister', 'Teresa', 'was', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'was', 'everybody', 'favorite.I', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Clergy', 'was', 'private', 'how', 'behaved', 'other', 'private', 'best', 'memory', 'Sisters', 'went', 'back', 'Convent', 'Class', 'where', 'also', 'ran', 'orphanage', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'work', 'pray.The', 'Priests', 'had', 'own', 'Residence', 'Priests', 'nuns', 'interacted', 'know', 'nothing', 'it.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'most', 'know', 'movie', 'possibility', 'one', 'Priests', 'may', 'be', 'molesting', 'one', 'Children', 'care', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'determined', 'drive', 'Priest', 'away', 'Would', 'nun', 'challenge', 'Priest', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'Certainly', 'not', 'Would', 'nun', 'challenge', 'Priest', 'circumstances', 'presented', 'Movie', 'think', 'nun', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'Principal', 'therefore', 'protector', 'children', 'charge.You', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'out.A', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'met', 'very', 'kind', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'Even', 'ugly', 'habit', 'knew', 'once', 'was', 'nun', 'out', 'was', 'member', 'Order', 'Sisters', 'Charity', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'rough', 'sledding', 'order', 'recent', 'years', 'Vocations', 'had', 'fallen', 'off', 'most', 'sisters', 'were', 'old', 'hope', 'survive', 'Society', 'will', 'miss', 'more', 'should', 'disband.I', 'will', 'always', 'miss', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'them.If', 'were', 'raised', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 1]","Of course a film with Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead roles has to be worth seeing since there apparently is no character that these two consummate actors cannot convincingly play. Ms. Streep as Sister Aloysius Beauvier is the sad and angry nun intent on destroying the life of Father Flynn (Hoffman) in this intense movie set in 1964. Hoffman is the new breed of Catholic priest who, in addition to wanting change in the church, really cares about the students in this secondary Catholic school. Streep will do whatever it takes to keep the status quo even if means being both dishonest and rushing to judgment without hard evidence as she sets out to railroad Hoffman. Ms. Streep walks a thin line and at times is almost one-dimensional although she ultimately succeeds as the most despicable character I believe she has ever played. (It will be a joy to see her portray Julia Child in her next film.) Mr. Hoffman is particularly good in the three sermons he gives and completely convinces you that he is a priest. I saw the movie with a friend who attended Catholic schools; he commented that Ms. Streep certainly was believable to him.Amy Adams as the younger Sister James who wants to believe in Father Flynn gives a good performance as well while Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller, the mother of the son who Father Flynn may or may not have had an improper relationship, with is just outrageous. For my money, she deserved the Golden Globe award she didn't receive.My one complaint about ""Doubt"" is that the ending seemed contrived. A friend of mine who has seen the play as well says that the director changed the ending in the movie. Although I think that was a mistake, ""Doubt"" isn't to be missed.

And what a treat it is!Sometimes, plays that become movies, despite the authors attempt to ""open it up"", just end up looking like a filmed play, static and overly talkative. John Patrick Stanley, who authored the play, clearly knows his stuff. The screenplay sparkles with the spoken gems of the stage production, yet moves through the screenplay with panache and vigor. He quietly allows us to get to know these formidable characters, their strengths and weaknesses (if any), and them lets them loose in the story to wreck havoc amongst each other. This is truly a character driven drama.Sister Aloysius Beauvier (realized fully by Streep, and is this the same woman who gave us Donna inMamma Mia! The Movie (Two Disc Special Edition)?) is a stern and discpline driven principal of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx, run by nuns trying to educate their students and care for their souls. Father Flynn (Hoffman) is a radical new priest which immediately runs into opposition by Beauvier, clinging to the old ways. But this is not merely a new versus old conflict. Stanley interjects another story, one more modern, concerning the revelations of the Catholic Church's decision to hide its abusive priests from the public. Flynn may or may not have done something improper in the rectory with a new black student. Kind Sister James alerts her boss to the suspicion, and, pardon the expression, all hell breaks loose in the school.The brilliance of the script is Stanley never allowing any of his characters to fall into stereotypes. Beauvier cares for her students and fellow nuns, revealing a softer heart than you might think; Sister James is not merely a bubble headed optimist, but truly has depth to her compassion; Flynn has his motives, unspoken as they are. With each scene, who to side with is difficult to pick; do I want the principal to win to protect the kids or to stop the church's progress? Do I want the progressive priest to win, to encourage movement forward but at the risk of the children? Stanley plays with us constantly, and to watch that interplay is the movie's true joy. Add in a spectacular twist that I just didn't see coming, and an Oscar worthy performance of Viola Davis as the possibly afflicted student's mother, and you have a truly cinematic experience.Doubt is one of those movies that comes out in December to hopefully gain some attention from the Oscars. In this case, it is well deserved.

With 13 Oscar nominations, two Oscar wins, 16 Golden Globe nominations, 6 Golden Globe wins, and 2 SAG awards, Meryl Streep is one of the most decorated actresses of all time. The movie DOUBT is no different. As great as Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, Streep steals every scene she is involved in. Amy Adams is great as the submissive, sweet Sister James. Viola Davis, who is in the movie maybe 15 or so minutes, had me sold she was the character she was portraying.Now as for the movie, some people call it slow. I watched it with some friends of mine, of which they love silly comedies and CGI action movies like TRANSFORMERS, and they didn't like the movie. I had seen it before at the theater and it was great. If you can't sit through a movie with an uncomfortable subject matter and a lot of dialouge, then this movie probably isn't for you. As mentioned, there is an uneasiness throughout the movie that can't be explained. It pulls you in and if you don't know the subject matter, that is all the better. I wish I could watch every movie I've seen again, but with no preconcieved opinion of it or memory of it.

1226700,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001PA0FF4,J from NY,"[2, 2]","The only thing I can with certainty about John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"" is that it makes the grade for the best film of 2008.  Everything else is sort of up in the air, as I'm sure this playwright turned director would have it.Set in a Catholic School in 1964, right around the same time of Vatican II, one could make a good case that despite being set in an atmosphere of faith this is a perfect movie for an agnostic or a lapsed Catholic.  A really anguished agnostic and lapsed Catholic.Philip Seymour Hoffmann plays Father Brendan Flynn in one of the most exquisitely ambiguous performances I have ever seen.  His character is seen, indeed, ""through a glass darkly"" though despite the ambiguity I don't think any viewer can come away without feeling a little slime rub off.  What is the exact nature of the slime?  Is it shame over a different sexual orientation?  Or is he in fact what the hawk-like, steely Sister Alyosisus suspects him to be: a sexual predator?While Meryl Streep gave a very entertaining performance as the classic Nunzilla, she wasn't really as bad as many viewers of the film hyped her up to be.  I've had more frightening teachers than that in public school.Having attended Catholic school nearly my entire life, I can say that ""living in terror of priests and nuns"" is, by and large, a myth.  There was some discipline involved, but I don't walk around crying about it decades later.Though she laments the increasing use of ballpoint pens, transistor radios, and progress in general, she obviously has a heart.Always eager to assist Sister Veronica, an aging fellow nun who is slowly blinding,  and patient with the starry eyed Sister James (Amy Adams).  There a few moments of absolute frigidity that occur mostly when her Absolutist nature is disturbed (telling Donald's mother that she will kick the child out if she does up her unfounded allegations against Father Flynn.)  When Father Flynn suggests ""secular"" songs for the Christmas pageant, she becomes really chilling, insisting that ""Frosty The Snowman""  is a disgusting piece of pagan heresy.  Also, Frosty should be known as a heretic and it should be broadcast all over the airwaves during Christmas.There's obviously a lot of resentment on Shanley's part regarding the patriarchal nature of the Church.  When Sister Aloysius and Sister James confront Father Flynn their suspicions about his relationship with the only black student in the school, Donald Miller, he sets the tone very authoritatively by strongly ""suggesting"" they put sugar in his tea.  His explanation for Donald's absence and the alcohol on his breath is believable.  All too believable.This is the kind of movie in which you have to weigh and balance every word, every nuance, and understand the symbolism if you want to get to the root of it.  Personally, I got the very strong sense that Shanley is playing both sides to evoke a sense of justice: while Father Flynn represents progressivism and Vatican II, he is very probably a child molester.  On the other hand Sister Aloysius represents the desire for female liberation and absolute Conservatism at the same time, which is merely an unresolved complex and not appealing to most viewers at all.  But out of the two of them, she is the righteous one.  This movie has to be seen more than once.

Rooney,"[1, 1]","""Doubt"", the movie, opens up the play giving it interesting exterior scenes such as the convent garden and views of the community, but the congregation other than the students isn't really drawn into this cloistered drama. The three participants are keeping this situation among themselves, a church thing.Meryl Streep as the Mother Superior, the school principal, is the avenging angel, courageous, perhaps foolhardy, serving as the accuser, the jury and judge. That's a lot of authority residing in one righteous zealot. Streep perhaps goes over the top playing the heartless, bossy creature similar to the character she played in ""The Devil Wears Praada.""Streep plays a stereotypical Mother Superior, but does it with great dramatic power. The movie makes her into a dragon as Hoffman calls her, and yet she performs kindly acts for her fellow sisters. The other sisters (not Sister James) come out as a rather cloddish, sheepish, too cowed herd.The priest played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the accused, and a superb Amy Adams is the young nun, Sister James, as messenger, witness and catalyst who begins to regret her role in the whole crisis. Hoffman gives two very effective sermons. The way the movie handles his sermon on gossip with feathers is brilliant.We briefly see the boy's mother, Viola Davis, in a bravura performance. She knows and accepts what she is dealing with, a troubled son. A melodramatic wind and rain storm ends the stormy scene between the mother and Streep.""Doubt"" is about ambiguities in faith, in human relationships, in sexual identity, in the dangers of certitude. At the same time while dealing with complexities it has stereotypes and some oversimplistic touches.Hoffman says, ""There are people who go after your humanity."" People who ""kill kindness in the name of virtue."" Streep says, ""I know people.""

The film was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008 and scored Oscar nominations for all four main performances...I can honestly say that Doubt is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 2008.Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the dictator-like principal of Saint Nicholas Church School. Lips eternally pursed, Aloysius inspires fear in the hearts of staff and students alike. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the parish priest who is universally loved by all; nuns, students, superiors...Everyone except Aloysius. When Father Flynn takes an interest in a young African-American boy named Donald Miller, Aloysius warns Sister James (Amy Adams), the young and innocent history teacher, to keep her eyes open. One day, Donald Miller is called to the rectory by Father Flynn...When he returns, Sister James notices alcohol on his breath; she reports her findings to Aloysius.Doubt is not a mystery or a ""did he or didn't he?"" about the priest. If this is all you want from the film, you'll be disappointed. Doubt is about exactly what it title implies.Much has been made about the performances in the film...I'm about to add to this. Hoffman, Streep, and Adams all deliver powerhouse performances, but for completely different reasons. We have three actors here all delivering various degrees of performances. Streep completely disappears into her role, simultaneous getting our fear, hatred, and sympathy. Hoffman plays his role so well and with such nuance, we don't know how to feel about him. He's fascinating. Amy Adams brings such an innocent, endearing quality to her role it becomes apparent why she's one of the most acclaimed actress's of recent years...And than there's Viola Davis, who has less than 20-minutes of screen time and was nominated for an Academy Award.Davis is the most talked about, despite having only two scenes. In the first, she's working with Meryl Streep and actually threatens to upstage the woman. Davis plays Mrs. Miller and brings such a dramatic punch to the film; it's a travesty that an actress who pulled off such a feat did not win the Academy Award. She is the heart-and-soul of this film.Even the child actor's are good and don't have that annoying ""clearly acting"" quality.Anyone studying terrific acting need look no further than the scene where Father Flynn is confronted by Sister James and Sister Aloysius. I found this scene more thrilling than many action movies and the way the actors play off each other while the tension slowly builds is just wonderful.Movies based on stage plays are usually so rooted in their stage origins, there's little room in a film version for anything besides great acting and a great story. Well, Doubt has both as well as great set direction and great cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins.Entertaining, timeless, and powerful. Doubt may not look like a very appealing movie to the masses, but it's a wonderful film with some of the best performances of 2008.

What does doubt do to the equation? Can good come from doubt?""Doubt"" depicts the troubling nature of doubt. In fact, the viewer is lead by the playwright's skillful dialog to question Sister Aloysious as a righteous destroyer. Are her doubts founded? In her best role to date as idealistic, but easily influenced Sister James, Amy Adams shows us the damaging nature of doubt and resulting gossip and outright allegations.You see, Donald Miller is the first African American student in St. Nicholas Catholic School in Boston in 1964. Father Flynn takes a special interest in Donald because he is isolated and intimidated. The doubt begins when Sister James relates an incident--rather, pieces of an incident--about Donald's being called alone to the rectory.Actually, the doubt begins with Sister-and-Principal Aloysious and her strict, stern, brook-no-nonsense way of running the school. One scene shows the deadly dull minimal talk at the dinner table among the nuns. The other shows the three priests in lively, hilarious conversation. Joy and community vs duty and stodginess. The contrast actually shows the viewer the extremes that can exist in a conflict and should warn as foreshadowing instead of truth.It's an unspoken accusation that is at the center of this drama. Is Father guilty or not? The film's tone would have us believe that Sister Aloysious is on a witch hunt because she dislikes the warm, caring, and popular priest. However, as a teacher in a Catholic school where diligence training concerning sexual abuse and harrasment is a monthly event, I understand Sister Aloysious's attention to this duty. What is more important: the care of a child or the protection of a priest? There's a very fine line here and one the playwright/director walks so carefully.Is the priest guilty?

There really isn't, the stars are for the acting which is absolutely flawless. And the actors are the right choices for the roles they're in, so if you want to see some really great acting read no further this movie is for you. The trouble comes in when this movie asks you to suspend disbelief and believe that the events in the movie could have occurred in the time period of the film, and it is those doubts that keep you from fully believing the events in the movie could have transpired.Doubt is about a Catholic priest Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who goes into a new parish and runs afoul of the principal of the school Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) who believes Father Flynn has an improper relationship with a young boy under his charge as an altar boy. Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn for no other reason than he delivered a sermon on doubt. The movie follows Sister Aloysius attempts to confirm her suspicions through the aid of neophyte nun Sister James (Amy Adams).The movie is really a parable set in 1964  and it makes no excuses about that, and I have no problem with writers or filmmakers wanting to present a tale of morality and its consequences. For every innocent act by Father Flynn there has to be a not so innocent interpretation or action by Father Flynn, the purpose of the whole drama is cast to doubt about Father Flynn's actions and in the mind of the viewer, in that it succeeds as a parable. But it has to fit within the context of the time period chosen to illustrate the moral problem. There's no denying that the Catholic Church has a lot to answer for about pedophilia, but watching the bonus feature about the making of the film director writer John Patrick Shanley tells of how he came to write the play this movie is based on. He wrote the play because of a nun that he remembered from first grade. Shanley may want to cast the nun's as hero's, maybe he was rescued by one or wished to be, but the problem is Sister Aloysius seems imbued with modern sensibilities that are not out of step with our own point of view, but they are out of step with the times they're set in, and in the lengths Sister Aloysius goes to confirm her suspicions about Father Flynn. She is repeatedly told to stop but doesn't, and in fact steps up her attacks on Father Flynn. I was an altar boy a few years after the period the film takes place in, and even then the priests word was law, and if a priest told a nun to stop something and she didn't she would have been transferred out of the parish pretty quick. There is a hint that Sister Aloysius wasn't always a nun in that she mentions having a husband during WWII and it really stands out because there is no other hint or idea that Sister Aloysius had a life outside of being a nun. Is this fragment a leftover part of a subplot that something from Sister Aloysius' life was informing the way she acts? If so, it should have been developed more, if that's what it was meant to do. The ending doesn't stay true to the concept of doubt either, although it makes a stab at claiming it does. Sister Aloysius gives us a logical and definite resolution as to what occurred with Father Flynn, so that when she confesses her doubts it rings falsely because we've already been presented a definite resolution and one that would confirm her suspicions as true.I have to comment about the directing only because the usage of some of the directors devices is noticeable and heavy handed in their usage. The symbolism and foreshadowing especially seem obvious, the use of wind as a vehicle for change, at one point Sister Aloysius quips that the wind is changing the world, I half expected her to quote Bob Dylan. And Shanleys use of camera angles at climatic moments to illustrate the dissonance of the characters state of mind comes treacherously close to the tilted camera angles used in the old Batman TV series.This a good movie that has great actors and acting, but it could have been a great movie.",4,Some Doubt About Doubt,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,4084,"['may', 'think', 'contradiction', 'title', 'review', 'number', 'stars', 'awarded', 'really', ""n't"", 'stars', 'are', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'actors', 'are', 'right', 'choices', 'roles', ""'re"", 'want', 'see', 'really', 'great', 'acting', 'read', 'further', 'movie', 'trouble', 'when', 'movie', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'believe', 'events', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'doubts', 'keep', 'fully', 'believing', 'events', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'transpired.Doubt', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'new', 'parish', 'afoul', 'principal', 'school', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'improper', 'relationship', 'young', 'boy', 'charge', 'altar', 'boy', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'other', 'reason', 'delivered', 'sermon', 'doubt', 'movie', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'attempts', 'confirm', 'suspicions', 'aid', 'neophyte', 'nun', 'Sister', 'James', 'Amy', 'Adams', '.The', 'movie', 'really', 'parable', 'set', '1964', 'excuses', 'have', 'problem', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'wanting', 'present', 'tale', 'morality', 'consequences', 'innocent', 'act', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'there', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'innocent', 'interpretation', 'action', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'purpose', 'whole', 'drama', 'cast', 'doubt', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'actions', 'mind', 'viewer', 'parable', 'fit', 'context', 'time', 'period', 'chosen', 'illustrate', 'moral', 'problem', 'denying', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'lot', 'answer', 'about', 'pedophilia', 'watching', 'bonus', 'feature', 'making', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'tells', 'how', 'came', 'write', 'play', 'movie', 'based', 'wrote', 'play', 'nun', 'remembered', 'first', 'grade', 'Shanley', 'may', 'want', 'cast', 'nun', 'hero', 'maybe', 'was', 'rescued', 'one', 'wished', 'be', 'problem', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'imbued', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'not', 'step', 'own', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'step', 'times', ""'re"", 'set', 'lengths', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'confirm', 'suspicions', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'stop', ""n't"", 'fact', 'steps', 'up', 'attacks', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'was', 'altar', 'boy', 'few', 'years', 'period', 'film', 'place', 'even', 'then', 'priests', 'word', 'was', 'law', 'priest', 'told', 'nun', 'stop', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'parish', 'pretty', 'quick', 'hint', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'nun', 'having', 'husband', 'WWII', 'really', 'out', 'other', 'hint', 'idea', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'had', 'life', 'being', 'nun', 'fragment', 'leftover', 'part', 'subplot', 'something', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'life', 'was', 'informing', 'way', 'so', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'do', 'ending', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'concept', 'doubt', 'stab', 'claiming', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'logical', 'definite', 'resolution', 'what', 'occurred', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'so', 'when', 'doubts', 'falsely', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'presented', 'definite', 'resolution', 'one', 'would', 'confirm', 'suspicions', 'true.I', 'have', 'comment', 'directing', 'only', 'usage', 'directors', 'devices', 'noticeable', 'heavy', 'handed', 'usage', 'symbolism', 'foreshadowing', 'especially', 'seem', 'obvious', 'use', 'wind', 'vehicle', 'change', 'one', 'point', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'wind', 'changing', 'world', 'half', 'expected', 'quote', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Shanleys', 'use', 'camera', 'angles', 'climatic', 'moments', 'illustrate', 'dissonance', 'characters', 'state', 'mind', 'treacherously', 'close', 'tilted', 'camera', 'angles', 'used', 'old', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series.This', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

Well, the movie is slightly better than I had hoped.  It is awful in a way, but sticks in your mind even weeks after seeing it, so it must have something, right?It doesn't have subtlety, that's for sure.  The scenes of Meryl Streep battling the wind are more laugh inducing that the combined efforts of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, and you can throw in the Marx Brothers too.  They must have suggested to Streep that she watch the silent classic THE WIND with Lillian Gish and then ordered her to out-Gish Gish, with some Marcel Marceau thrown in too.  I'm surprised she didn't pluck a flower and smell it, she is so hammy you have to love her.  That, and the lights going out, are movie devices you hardly ever see today, more's the pity.  In fact we don't have enough symbolism about Vatican II in general.  I lived through the whole era, and in fact had an inappropriate relationship with a priest, without any of the wind coming down and whipping our garments around our faces.  And it just gets worse and worse.  At least Streep and Hoffman look like they're having fun, as does Viola Davis, much more pragmatic about letting her son carry on with an older man than my mom ever was, God rest her soul.  Amy Adams on the other hand does more moral suffering than all the actresses in Cries and Whispers combined.  Why she ever took the part I don't know, but it's lousy and so is she.Don't hate me, DOUBT lovers.  I just call them like I see them.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 4]","John Patrick Shanley's playDoubt: a Parablewon several prizes in 2005 for being one of the most subtle and thought-provoking plays of recent years.  This movie, adapted and directed by Shanley himself, will likely be remembered as one of the chief exemplars of why it's risky to adapt a play for the big screen.""Doubt"" turns on two nuns and a priest teaching at a Manhattan Catholic school in 1964.  One old nun carries baggage she never reveals, while her very young prot&eacute;g&eacute; has not yet become wise to life's subtle cues.  When the old nun suspects the priest of an inappropriate relationship with a young boy, her silent burden spurs her to rash action.It's a tale that admits no easy answers.  Is the priest guilty, or is the old nun harrying an innocent man from his pulpit?  Is the young nun's innocence her weakness, or the one trait tying her to God?  This beautiful ambiguity won a Tony, a Pulitzer, and five Drama Desk Awards, all considered well earned.The original play has been translated whole.  The characters, scenes, and most of the dialogue have been transported intact.  Yet somehow, the play, which moved so many people so deeply in the intimate confines of the theatre, seems too small for the screen.It's nothing against any of the creative team or the performers.  The visual design manages to capture a perfectly weather-beaten texture reflecting the quiet desperation of the characters.  And the cast, who would probably have been perfect for a proscenium stage, acquit themselves well in their roles, all of them appearing to eat themselves from within as they engage their conflicts.But the play is about personal interactions, mostly in groups of two, mostly in offices, prayer gardens, and other confined spaces.  The camera begs for more expanse than the situations permit, and the movie makes up the difference by having the characters walking, moving, shifting, and engaging in other actions which don't support the scenes.And the camera demands a richer, more populous world than the stage permits.  Numerous characters who linger offstage in the play suddenly walk into events and demand to be treated as part of the ensemble.  When other nuns and school staff barge in, that's one thing.  But the play maintained tension by keeping the boys around whom the controversy turns out of sight.  Now we see them interact with the principal characters, and it diffuses the energy.Besides that, some symbols added for the cinema serve no purpose.  Notably, the weather keeps cropping in, particularly oncoming or present storms.  This implies that a massive confrontation is approaching, though the ultimate conflict is finally too small to justify the symbols.This movie will be handy for people who live too far from a major theatre mecca to see the original play.  And it preserves at least part of the playwright's vision for posterity.  But it feels like a strained translation from a small, intimate medium into another medium which wants something bigger.

She's tough and traditional and bristles at the friendlier, more outgoing attitude of the pastor, Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  A young teacher tells her that the priest may have acted inappropriately with one of her students, and Sister makes it her business to rid the parish of the dangerous man.This movie didn't live up to its hype for me.  I found the script dull and the actors competent, but not memorable.  The plot also draws upon the priest scandals of recent years and assumes guilt even though there is no evidence or trial.  There is no action at all and the overblown,  trite speeches lack real conviction.  I never believed Streep as the principal despite her scowls and knitted brows (and her accent that comes and goes); it all felt like play-acting.  Amy Adams is  way too saccharine and childlike as the young teacher.  I did like Hoffman as Father Flynn, however, and thought he did a good job of keeping us guessing.All in all, it seemed too stagy and tedious and ultimately pointless.

The ending purports to be dramatic, but it is ambiguous and will leave you confused.  The problem here is we have a three hour play trimmed down for a two hour script.  There is a glaring loss of continuity.  I worked in insurance claims for 25 years and handled a great number of identical claims.

1226729,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B001PA0FF4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 10]","I saw a touring company of ""Doubt: A Parable"" starring Cherry Jones in the role that won her a Tony Award for Best Actress, and when I came out of the show what impressed me even more than her mesmerizing performance was the way John Patrick Shanley's play achieved such a delicately balanced sense of ambiguity on the issue of guilt and innocence.  Consequently, I was worried that even though Shanley would be both adapting his play to the screen and directing this film version, the careful calculus of the drama would be ruined.Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is concerned about young Donald Miller (nee Muller), a 12-year-old student at the St. Nicholas school in New York City, is having an improper relationship with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  She warns Sister James (Amy Adams) to keep an eye out for anything strange concerning the boy, and sure enough the young nun sees something that could be interpreted as being exactly what Sister Aloysius fears.  Armed with a certainty that is the antithesis of the work's title, Sister Aloysius works diligently, if not pathologically, to confirm her suspicions and to rid her school of the popular priest.There is an inherent impulse when a play is transformed to the screen to add characters and locations.  You might recall how ""Steel Magnolias"" added an entire new gender to the movie version with success.  But then there is the example of how the sense of claustrophobia so central to ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was jettisoned by a car trip to a road house.  Such pitfalls may well explain why Shanley decided to adapt and direct this movie.  The play consists largely of scenes of Father Flynn talking to his congregation or the school's male students, with those in which Sister Aloysius confronts each character in turn in her office.  Shanley has significantly reworked the former while keeping the latter scenes essentially the same, a precarious proposition because whereas the play tells us about Flynn's interaction with young Donald and the other students, the movie takes pains to show us several (but not all) key encounters.  Usually the dictate is for films to engage in showing rather than telling, but that is problematic here the audience should be in the position of Sister Aloysius, trying to render a judgment on the basis of hearsay evidence.  In reworking so many key elements of one half of the equation, Shanley does a masterful job of recalibrating his play for the screen.  Despite the performances in this film, once again it is the playwright's craft that most impresses me because if ""Doubt"" does not walk that fine line, so that each side can look at the evidence contained within and justify their respective rushes to judgment, the play collapses.The final hurdle is that audiences watch ""Doubt"" from a contemporary perspective in which the assumption, at least by late night comedians, is that every priest in the country has predilections to pedophilia.  But that is why it is so important that Shanley's story is set in 1964, and not just because it makes pedophilia less of an obvious concern.  It is because a key part of the dynamic here is that Sister Aloysius is old school while Father Flynn represents the tide of reformation in the Catholic Church mandated by Vatican II.  I have little doubt that when Sister Aloysius watches ""Going My Way"" she sees Bing Crosby's Father O'Malley as the most troublesome priest this side of Thomas a Beckett.  The fact that Sister Aloysius may be seen as having ulterior motives is another compelling complexity of the play, as is Father Flynn's attempt to demand blind obedience from someone who is only a nun in an organization that is the paradigmatic model of patriarchical order.I was concerned when I saw the trailer for ""Doubt"" that Streep's approach was wrong for the character, but was relieved to see that within the context of her performance those lines that struck me as being odd all work.  This is a performance when Streep's character is confined by the severe bonnet of her holy order, and the actress focuses her performance on her mouth, going through an impressive display of tight lips, puckers, and twitches to flesh out her characterization.  The standout scene in this film comes between Sister Aloysius and Donald's mother (Viola Davis).  The scene is critical because it is the first (but not the last) time that Sister Aloysius has to deal with somebody as a human being and not as a superior or subordinate within the strictures of the Catholic church.  The scene is also a textbook example of how an actress can earn at least an Academy Award nomination, if not the Oscar itself, on the basis of single solitary scene.  Davis is clearly the one to beat for Best Supporting Actress in 2009.  Of course, you can anticipate Streep being nominated for the umpteenth time as well (Tell the truth: when she won for ""Sophie's Choice"" way back in 1982, did you not think Streep would have a couple of more Oscars by now?), and could hardly be surprised if Hoffman and Adams received nods as well, although such a clean sweep might be too much to ask for.In the final analysis I tend to think the film did not work as well as the play, but that could because this was the second telling of the tale for me.  I still favor Jones' performance over that of Streep, but one of the attractions of this play is that each actress who assays the role has an opportunity to make it their own.  Every actress within spitting distance of 50 is going to what to play Sister Aloysius at some point, and the four person cast should make this Pulitzer Prize winning play a staple of local theater for decades to come.  The key is to judge Streep on her entire performance, because in her final lines there is a definite payoff to the way she has wound her character so tight.  I really did have some serious doubts about how well this film version would play.  Suffice it to say I have them no longer.",5,"I had my doubts about transferring this play to the big screen, but Shanley and company carry it off",1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,5958,"['saw',

1226732,AKR4DH6WLF6GG,B001PA0FF4,Linda Bulger,"[3, 3]","Doubtis a riveting movie with a terrific cast. The story is set in a Catholic school in the mid-1960s, fixed in time by reference to the assassination of JFK. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the tough principal who has no time for the popular, progressive priest of the parish, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). When he preaches a sermon on doubt--the lack of moral clarity and how to find your way through it--she sees it as a personal statement of his guilt about something, and warns her nuns to be on the look-out. Sister James (Amy Adams) joins the witch hunt and suggests that Father Flynn has too much interest in the school's first African-American pupil, an eighth-grade boy. There is no proof, only ugly suspicion, and the boy's mother (Viola Davis) wants to shove the question under the rug and let her son graduate and get on to high school without addressing the matter. In the end, Sister James recants.The story was topical and the performances award-worthy. While I enjoyed this short movie very much, there are a few points that gave me pause and are worth mentioning. For one thing, it adheres quite strictly to its antecedents as a play; some of the long scenes are occasionally static, and there is little attempt to develop back-story. We learn that Sister Aloysius also has experienced doubt--is it enough to know that, or should the viewer have been indulged with more background on what made her so hard-boiled? These decisions by playwright-screenwriter-director John Patrick Shanley are no doubt deliberate choices and they set a timeless, almost allegorical tone.Another question--and one I can't answer even though I was a Catholic school pupil in the year this movie was set--is whether the suspicions of the nuns are realistic in their time, or whether they are informed by later revelations. The case (if you can call it that) against Father Flynn is outlined with a very broad brush; his groomed fingernails, his progressive manner, the smell of alcohol on a boy's breath and the assumption that the priest provided it. Still, that IS the way of witch hunts, andDoubtisn't actually about Father Flynn's guilt or innocence, but about the toxic moral environment in which innuendo is as damning as proof.Meryl Streep is one of the greats performing today, and she played the narrow-minded harpy brilliantly. The character's flashes of humor and doubt are an interesting variation from the more augustly foreboding figure that might have been created for Sister Aloysius. Likewise, Hoffman is brilliantly convincing as the modern-thinking priest who dares to suggest a secular song for the Christmas pageant. In both these characters, true to the name of the film, the question of guilt or innocence is left intriguingly unanswered. In the end the question is not of guilt or innocence, it seems, but of our moral reaction to it.Linda Bulger, 2009",5,"""In the pursuit of wrong-doing, one steps away from God.

It has a narrow, intense and deep scope with most of the action taking place in a Catholic school and church in the Bronx in 1964.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a likable and jovial parish priest, Father Flynn, who likes his pleasures: his wine, his food, and his job apparently. He's an approachable priest.Contrast him to the nun played by Merryl Streep, Sister Aloysius, who runs the Catholic school.  She disapproves of the priest.  She is dour, strict and when you hear about the nuns smacking students' hands with a rule for an infraction, she's the type you can imagine doing so.There's another nun, played by Amy Adams, Sister James, who is asked by Sister Aloysius to report anything doubtful about Father Flynn.  When Adams witness something that concerns her, Sister Aloysius confronts Father Flynn.  Doubt permeates the situation.  Did Father Flynn do anything wrong?  Is Sister Aloysius right in threatening Father Flynn? Did Sister James see what she thinks she saw? And what about the mother of the student involved, played by Viola Davis (Oprah said she begged for that role)?  What does she really want?And we have doubts about Sister Aloysius - wouldn't we rather have that likable Father Flynn around than this frustrated, joy-denying Sister?This film sets up many conflicts, which we, the audience, will have doubts about.

Can Sister Aloysius' ""certainty"" be trusted or is she merely an intolerant (or disturbed) social dinosaur? These are questions the viewer will be asking. The movie swings both ways equally...giving evidence to Father Flynn's guilt and his innocence. The one element that really stood out for me was how Father Flynn seemed to use his pulpit to plant seeds of doubt in those who would be against him. If he was a manipulator, then he was a very, VERY good one...a ""sheep in wolves clothing"". On the other hand Sister Aloysius comes across as mean; almost cruel. But she has a will of iron and a steely determination. She will not back down from her sense of ""certainty"" regarding the character of Father Flynn...even when her only evidence is her observation of him touching a young boy's hand. She refuses to follow the protocol of the church and is willing to be cast out from its doors...all to protect the welfare of a child. Sister Aloysius is the only one not swayed, BUT in the end her humanity reveals itself. This is a powerful and disconcerting film. The performances were nothing short of amazing. I mean, who else but Meryl Streep could have pulled off the Sister Aloysius character. Phillip Seymore Hoffman as Father Flynn was amazing as well, although I don't think it was as demanding a role as that of Sister Aloysius.

To be around such a weird and fearful person in charge of children made me very glad I'm not a Catholic and never went to a Catholic school. I had a few mean teachers in my time, but never anything like her. Streep played the part perfectly for one of those overly fanatic religious people who think they know it all.  But the whole theme of the film, the suspicion, the cruelty, of a teacher whose in charge of children, upset me so much, I had to finally turn it off.After a while, I turned it back on.  It was still playing, and it was near the end.  Then I saw that cruel nun crying because of the fact that she might have been wrong by trying to ruin a priests career, and who knows about the boy? That part was totally unbelievable.  In reality, she would have been proud of what she had done, as most fanatics are when things go their way. It made me so mad, that I threw the film in the garbage where it belonged.First of all the movie was supposed to be in the early 60's where no one ever would have accused a priest of pedophilia!  Out of the question.  This never came up until the 90's when a few brave boys spoke up.  And even then, it took years for anyone to believe them, or the church to do anything about it, much less the civil authorities.  Rev. Law of Boston, who covered up the crimes of his pedophile priests holds a high position in Rome today.  The Church didn't care one wit. And they still don't or Law would have been excommunicated, and sitting in a jail cell in Boston along with those priests he was protecting.I have no sympathy for a paranoid teacher whose in charge of children.  She should not have been placed in a school. She belonged in a mental institution. Beyond that, the priest did absolutely nothing to even cause any such doubt.  Should any nice priest or the kind father of a child be considered a molester?  I think a man would go out of his way to not act suspicious.  Rather this priest was simply being nice and helpful to a kid who felt out of his place.  I guess nice priests are not acceptable in the Catholic church.  But wasn't it Jesus who said ""Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."" Perhaps the Catholic Church doesnt' accept Jesus' beliefs just the Church's beliefs. Certainly this nun didn't. A priest can be kind without being a pedophile. And a difficult priest can, in fact, be one.Meryl Streep is a great actress and played the part of the evil, destructive nun to a T. One of her best acting jobs since Sophie's Choice.

However, there was *something* about this film and especially her performance that seemed altogether redundant. I have never seen Meryl work so hard at 'trying' to be a character, rather than just 'be' that character. It was amazing to watch. And for all the wrong reasons.I must say the only saving grace is Amy Adams, who is excellent as a confused and morally divided person who prefers believing the easiest explanation. On one hand, the movie wants to work as a moral tale to demonstrate that even in these so-called religious institutions, no one is sure of anything, let alone God and various forms of philosophy. On the other, it is determined to work as a star vehicle for Streep, who pouts, slams and overacts throughout the entire film - with almost no real punch to it.That this is considered 'serious cinema' is sad. Yes, the 'shocking' confrontation between Streep and Viola Davis is interesting only because' of the Davis characters' reaction, but once you move past that, its amazing that Viola even garnered an Oscar nomination for barely ten minutes on screen (she was good, but not great).

1226746,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001PA0FF4,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 1]","Religious belief is founded in faith, the condition of believing in something that is unseen by the person of faith. ""Doubt"" as a concept is the polar opposite, the yin to the yang of faith, but both bound together at the hip like theological Siamese twins.People of faith prize the highest kind of faith - the unshaking, unswavering, unalterable faith that absolutely believes, no matter what.  I saw this kind of faith simplistically depicted in bumper stickers that proclaimed ""God said it.  I believe it.  That settles it."" But is it okay for a person of faith to have doubt?John Patrick Shanley had already proven his abilities as a writer with, for example, his Oscar-winning script to the delightful ""Moonstruck"".  In ""Doubt"" he does double-duty and directs as well.The four principle performers all earned Oscar nominations, and this film is uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, a compassionate Priest who opens the film with a sermon on exactly the topic of Doubt.  We learn that the man allows a place for doubt within his faith.  St. Nicholas is a grade school in Father Flynn's parish, and the principal there is Sister Aloysius, played by Meryl Streep, is a humorless nun who not only doesn't allow for any doubt in her beliefs or actions, but also doesn't allow for pretty much any views contrary to her extremely narrow view of the world.  She despises ball-point pens, for example, because you must press harder with a ball-point pen than with fountain pens, and she has an undisguised contempt for those who use ball-point pens - such as Father Flynn.  But the rich screenplay also shows a little of the humane side of Sister Aloysius as she helps and shields an elderly nun who is going blind, fearing that the poor dear will be put out to pasture if her disappearing sight is discovered.  None of the characters are one dimensional.Amy Adams is superb as Sister James, a bright young nun who teaches history and withers before the stern gaze of Sister Aloysius.At this Brooklyn Catholic school young Donald Miller enrolls.  Donald is African-American and doesn't quite fit in.  The staff take particular note of young Mr. Miller - not wanting to single him out for good or bad, but also wanting to make him feel welcome as in 1964 a young black man may not be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the all-white school.  Father Flynn in particular seems to encourage Donald, and in an early scene Donald confides that he aspires to become a priest as well.Sister James sees something... or does she?  She recognizes that what she has observed is circumstantial at best - Donald was called out of class to the rectory, and she is certain that she smells alcohol on his breath when he returns.Sister James dutifully informs Sister Aloysius, and the stern headmistress is absolutely certain - with no doubt - of the worst thing this can imply about ball-point pen-using Father Flynn.Father Flynn is confronted in a series of sensational scenes by Sister Aloysius, pleading not only his innocence, but also a ""how DARE you even THINK such a thing"" attitude that adds...doubt... in the eyes of the audience.  But Father Flynn knows that a public accusation such as the one Sister Aloysius is certain of would ruin him.  What Priest could recover from a scandal with an altar boy, even if he could be ""cleared"" in an investigation?Viola Davis also earned an Oscar nomination as the boy's mother.  She sees the school as a way for Donald to escape both the neighborhood and her own abusive husband.  If the Priest is kind to the boy, why should she have doubt?The dialogue is razor sharp and as good as Shanley's script is, his words are helped immensely by the delivery and the body language of the remarkable cast.  The academy award for adapted screenplay went to ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and I thought that film was excellent (as evidenced by my 5-star review), but I find this script a cut above. Not a tawdry story about a degenerate Priest, this is instead a story about the dichotomies that exist between moral rigidity and compassion, moral certainty and doubt, with a rich understory about the gap between the haves and have-nots, exemplified by Viola Davis as the woman who is willing to accept the possibility that a priest may be taking advantage of her son, as long as it gives the boy a possible road out of the nowhere world of their neighborhood.",5,How do you bridge the gap between Faith and...,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,4401,"['Religious', 'belief', 'founded', 'faith', 'condition', 'believing', 'something', 'unseen', 'person', 'faith', 'Doubt', 'concept', 'polar', 'opposite', 'yin', 'yang', 'faith', 'together', 'hip', 'theological', 'Siamese', 'twins.People', 'faith', 'prize', 'highest', 'kind', 'faith', 'unshaking', 'unswavering', 'unalterable', 'faith', 'absolutely', 'matter', 'what', 'saw', 'kind', 'faith', 'simplistically', 'depicted', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'proclaimed', 'God', 'said', 'believe', 'okay', 'person', 'faith', 'have', 'doubt', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'abilities', 'writer', 'example', 'Oscar-winning', 'script', 'delightful', 'Moonstruck', 'Doubt', 'double-duty', 'directs', 'well.The', 'four', 'principle', 'performers', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'compassionate', 'Priest', 'who', 'film', 'sermon', 'exactly', 'topic', 'Doubt', 'learn', 'man', 'place', 'doubt', 'faith', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'grade', 'school', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'parish', 'principal', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'humorless', 'nun', 'who', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'allow', 'doubt', 'beliefs', 'actions', 'also', ""n't"", 'allow', 'pretty', 'much', 'views', 'contrary', 'extremely', 'narrow', 'view', 'world', 'ball-point', 'pens', 'example', 'must', 'press', 'harder', 'ball-point', 'pen', 'fountain', 'pens', 'undisguised', 'contempt', 'who', 'use', 'ball-point', 'pens', 'such', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'rich', 'screenplay', 'also', 'little', 'humane', 'side', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'elderly', 'nun', 'who', 'going', 'fearing', 'poor', 'dear', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'disappearing', 'sight', 'discovered', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional.Amy', 'Adams', 'superb', 'Sister', 'James', 'bright', 'young', 'nun', 'who', 'history', 'withers', 'stern', 'gaze', 'Sister', 'Aloysius.At', 'Brooklyn', 'Catholic', 'school', 'young', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'Donald', 'African-American', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'staff', 'take', 'particular', 'note', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'not', 'wanting', 'single', 'out', 'good', 'bad', 'also', 'wanting', 'make', 'feel', 'welcome', '1964', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'welcomed', 'open', 'arms', 'rest', 'all-white', 'school', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'particular', 'encourage', 'Donald', 'early', 'scene', 'Donald', 'become', 'priest', 'well.Sister', 'James', 'something', 'what', 'observed', 'circumstantial', 'best', 'Donald', 'was', 'called', 'class', 'rectory', 'certain', 'alcohol', 'breath', 'when', 'returns.Sister', 'James', 'dutifully', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'stern', 'headmistress', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'doubt', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'imply', 'ball-point', 'pen-using', 'Father', 'Flynn.Father', 'Flynn', 'confronted', 'series', 'sensational', 'scenes', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'pleading', 'not', 'only', 'innocence', 'also', 'how', 'DARE', 'even', 'THINK', 'thing', 'attitude', 'doubt', 'eyes', 'audience', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'public', 'accusation', 'such', 'one', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'certain', 'would', 'ruin', 'What', 'Priest', 'could', 'recover', 'scandal', 'altar', 'boy', 'even', 'could', 'be', 'cleared', 'investigation', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'also', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'boy', 'mother', 'school', 'way', 'Donald', 'escape', 'neighborhood', 'own', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Priest', 'kind', 'boy', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'doubt', 'dialogue', 'razor', 'sharp', 'as', 'good', 'Shanley', 'script', 'words', 'are', 'helped', 'immensely', 'delivery', 'body', 'language', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'academy', 'award', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'went', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'evidenced', '5-star', 'review', 'find', 'script', 'cut', 'above', 'Not', 'tawdry', 'story', 'degenerate', 'Priest', 'instead', 'story', 'dichotomies', 'exist', 'moral', 'rigidity', 'compassion', 'moral', 'certainty', 'doubt', 'rich', 'understory', 'gap', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'exemplified', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'woman', 'who', 'willing', 'accept', 'possibility', 'priest', 'may', 'be', 'taking', 'advantage', 'son', 'as', 'long', 'boy', 'possible', 'road', 'nowhere', 'world', 'neighborhood']",N/A
1226747,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001PA0FF4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Doubt deserved more awards and nominations that it received.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire way through. This taut drama couldn't have been edited any better--there's nothing much to cut here! The plot moves along at a very good pace and the acting is very convincing; the brilliant cast turns in tremendous performances that would make most ""celebrities"" green with envy. The cinematography worked well, especially in the scenes in Sister Aloysius' office; and the choreography shines all the way through the film.When the action starts, we quickly meet Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the first and only African-American student in The Saint Nicholas Catholic School in late 1964. Donald doesn't fit in; the rest of the students are from Italian and Irish families and he does get harassed by a fellow student soon after he enters the school. Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) takes a liking to the young boy and professes that he wants to help Donald because Donald comes from a troubled home. Father Flynn thinks Donald needs extra attention to be sure Donald succeeds in his new school. Trouble is, however, that one day Sister James (Amy Adams) witnesses some odd behavior: Father Flynn returns Donald's undershirt to his locker instead of just giving it directly to Donald; and after a private talk with Father Flynn Donald returns to class--with alcohol on his breath.Sister Aloysius already dislikes Father Flynn intensely; his progressive attitudes represent all that is changing in the outside world while Sister Aloysius is desperate to preserve the old ways of life. Sister Aloysius also dislikes that Flynn takes sugar in his tea, wears his fingernails a bit long--and now he wants a secular song added to the school's annual Christmas show. But once Sister Aloysius finds out that Donald may have been approached by Father Flynn in an inappropriate way, she just might have all that she needs to drive him out.And what a power struggle it becomes. Sister Aloysius gets nothing but denial from Father Flynn; he adds that Mr. McGuinn (Jack O'Connell) caught Donald drinking alter wine and that Father Flynn privately forgave him so that Donald could remain an alter boy. Does McGuinn back this up? And when Sister Aloysius tries to talk to Donald's mother (Viola Davis) about the potential problem, she gets quite a different reaction than she expected. What an explosive scene!I can't say enough about these incredible, unforgettable performances. These actors really and truly become the characters that they play in this film; everything is THAT convincing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Viola Davis worked magic to make these characters come to life. The final confrontation between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn couldn't have been performed any better. In addition, the theme of light is very noticeable; Sister Aloysius opens the shutters to put Father Flynn in a police-like interrogation spotlight when she initially questions him with Sister James at her side; and it's interesting to note that Sister James, who comes to believe that Father Flynn is innocent, ""causes"" a light bulb to go out during a conversation she has with Sister Aloysius. The wind also is used to highlight the tensions between all these people.The DVD comes with a number of very good extras. We get a featurette on the Sisters Of Charity; and there's a commentary with writer/director John Patrick Stanley. I also liked the bonus feature entitled Doubt: From Stage To Screen. There is more, too.Doubt is not a family movie; it's a dark, pensive film that packs a punch. It also makes a strong statement about the difficulty of interpreting behavior that is ambiguous to say the least. I highly recommend this film for people who like dramas that are chock full of tension and suspense.",5,taut drama with lots of suspense--and the performances couldn't be better,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,3839,"['Doubt', 'deserved', 'more', 'awards', 'nominations', 'received', 'was', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'way', 'taut', 'drama', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'better', 'nothing', 'much', 'cut', 'here', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'turns', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'would', 'make', 'most', 'celebrities', 'green', 'envy', 'cinematography', 'worked', 'well', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'office', 'choreography', 'way', 'film.When', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'Donald', 'Miller', 'Joseph', 'Foster', 'II', 'first', 'only', 'African-American', 'student', 'Saint', 'Nicholas', 'Catholic', 'School', 'late', '1964', 'Donald', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'students', 'are', 'Italian', 'Irish', 'families', 'get', 'harassed', 'fellow', 'student', 'soon', 'school', 'Father', 'Brendan', 'Flynn', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'liking', 'young', 'boy', 'help', 'Donald', 'Donald', 'troubled', 'home', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Donald', 'extra', 'attention', 'be', 'sure', 'Donald', 'new', 'school', 'Trouble', 'however', 'one', 'day', 'Sister', 'James', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'odd', 'behavior', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Donald', 'undershirt', 'locker', 'instead', 'just', 'giving', 'directly', 'Donald', 'private', 'talk', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Donald', 'class', 'alcohol', 'breath.Sister', 'Aloysius', 'already', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'intensely', 'progressive', 'attitudes', 'represent', 'changing', 'outside', 'world', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'desperate', 'preserve', 'old', 'ways', 'life', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'also', 'Flynn', 'sugar', 'tea', 'fingernails', 'bit', 'long', 'now', 'secular', 'song', 'added', 'school', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'show', 'once', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'out', 'Donald', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'approached', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'inappropriate', 'way', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'drive', 'out.And', 'what', 'power', 'struggle', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'nothing', 'denial', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Mr.', 'McGuinn', 'Jack', ""O'Connell"", 'caught', 'Donald', 'drinking', 'alter', 'wine', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'privately', 'forgave', 'so', 'Donald', 'could', 'remain', 'alter', 'boy', 'Does', 'McGuinn', 'back', 'up', 'when', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'talk', 'Donald', 'mother', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'potential', 'problem', 'quite', 'different', 'reaction', 'expected', 'What', 'explosive', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'incredible', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'actors', 'really', 'truly', 'become', 'characters', 'play', 'film', 'everything', 'convincing', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'worked', 'magic', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'better', 'addition', 'theme', 'light', 'very', 'noticeable', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'shutters', 'put', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'police-like', 'interrogation', 'spotlight', 'when', 'initially', 'questions', 'Sister', 'James', 'side', 'interesting', 'note', 'Sister', 'James', 'who', 'believe', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'innocent', 'causes', 'light', 'bulb', 'go', 'out', 'conversation', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'wind', 'also', 'used', 'highlight', 'tensions', 'people.The', 'DVD', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'extras', 'get', 'featurette', 'Sisters', 'Charity', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Stanley', 'also', 'liked', 'bonus', 'feature', 'entitled', 'Doubt', 'From', 'Stage', 'Screen', 'more', 'too.Doubt', 'not', 'family', 'movie', 'dark', 'pensive', 'film', 'punch', 'also', 'strong', 'statement', 'difficulty', 'interpreting', 'behavior', 'ambiguous', 'say', 'least', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'dramas', 'are', 'chock', 'full', 'tension', 'suspense']",N/A

While the film doesn't fit in the prior classifications, there is enough vagueness about Father Flynn, mysteriously played by Philip Seymour Hoffman,  to capture all the elements of a good mystery.  Exactly who this man is, what background he came from, and what his intentions may be, are not fully revealed - and that's exactly how he wants it.Perhaps the good Father relies on faith for those who wish to trust him.  Perhaps he prefers a sense of wonderment to revelation.  Or perhaps he's just a pervert pursuing Donald Miller, a young and vulnerable student and altar boy.  In any case the topics of his sermons, his tendency to avoid direct answers, and his slightly overgrown nails, are enough to arouse the suspicions of those far less curious than the persistent Sister Aloysius, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep.But to what point do we rely on gut instinct over lack of factual evidence?  To what extent must we do the ""right"" thing in spite of personal consequences?  And what's the ratio of prevailing goodness to sins that are washed away?  This movie asks all these questions while attempting to answer none of them.Therefore, for those liking well-rounded conclusions, then the ending may be a disappointment.  But if you believe as Alfred Hitchcock did that the greatest horror exists in the human mind, then I would highly recommend this drama.Other than my disappointment that the Supporting Actress nomination wasn't an Oscar win for Viola Davis, who played Donald's mother, my only complaint was that the movie was too short.  I was still hanging onto my seat waiting for more.

With the help of a fellow nun, the two of them investigate to uncover the truth and bring justice to light.As mentioned before, this film is superbly acted. Meryl Streep, already a legend, earned her fifteenth nomination for her role, who balances wit, steely demure, and when she let loose in some of the confrontations, its a very powerful thing to watch. Phillip Seymore Hoffman imbues Father Flynn with so much warm and kindness it most certainlty instills doubt in the viewer if he truly is capable of such a horrible act. Amy Adams acts as the mediator between the two, always holding her own against the two experience actors. And finally Viola Davis, who joins the select few actors to make the most out of a limited role.The film is very shady about the details about the crime and never gives any explicit details. This causes you to wonder, did Father Flynn do it? Is Sister Aloysius wrong? As the film goes on, you get little snip its of details that one moment will say the two nuns are right and then the next putting that questioning feeling in you and by the end of the film (spoiler alert! do not read on if you have not seen the film!) you are left to wonder, did Father Flynn really do it? or was it all just an overblown lie?This is a must see film for anyone who has followed the award season.",5,A Talented Cast Brings To Life This Powerful Drama,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1761,"['Doubt', 'based', 'Tony', 'award', 'winning', 'play', 'perhaps', 'most', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'year', 'four', 'stars', 'being', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'line', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong.Sister', 'Aloysius', 'strict', 'hard', 'nosed', 'principle', 'local', 'Catholic', 'school', 'who', 'midst', 'personal', 'battle', 'one', 'priest', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'abusing', 'one', 'altar', 'help', 'fellow', 'nun', 'two', 'investigate', 'uncover', 'truth', 'bring', 'justice', 'light.As', 'mentioned', 'before', 'film', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'already', 'legend', 'earned', 'fifteenth', 'nomination', 'role', 'who', 'wit', 'steely', 'demure', 'when', 'let', 'loose', 'confrontations', 'very', 'powerful', 'thing', 'watch', 'Phillip', 'Seymore', 'Hoffman', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'so', 'much', 'warm', 'kindness', 'most', 'certainlty', 'instills', 'doubt', 'viewer', 'truly', 'capable', 'such', 'horrible', 'act', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'mediator', 'two', 'always', 'holding', 'own', 'two', 'experience', 'actors', 'finally', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'select', 'few', 'actors', 'make', 'most', 'limited', 'role.The', 'film', 'very', 'shady', 'details', 'crime', 'never', 'explicit', 'details', 'wonder', 'did', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'do', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'wrong', 'film', 'get', 'little', 'snip', 'details', 'one', 'moment', 'will', 'say', 'two', 'nuns', 'are', 'right', 'then', 'next', 'putting', 'questioning', 'feeling', 'end', 'film', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'did', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'really', 'do', 'was', 'just', 'overblown', 'lie', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'award', 'season']",N/A

I think the people who loved it, loved it because of some excellent acting.  And undeniably, this film is full of excellent acting.  But it doesn't have much else going for it.  A vague, mysterious story, and an ending that only tells you the movie is over--but doesn't answer many questions.The director (who is also the writer) is fond of ominous portents: strong winds blowing, light bulbs burning out, close-ups of Hoffman's fingernails, students with mysterious angry or smiling faces...  What does it all mean?  Well, nothing.  They're portents for portents' sake, I guess; ""dramatic"" scenes that keep the movie from only being an hour long.And more:  Hoffman confesses to... we're not sure what.  Iron nun Streep suddenly breaks down (right at the end--what wonderful timing!) and confesses to... doubt!  But doubt about what?  Her faith?  Her actions?  Hoffman's guilt?  Agreeing to be in this film?  We're never told.  But it's definitely supposed to be dramatic, because the music swells and the camera pulls way back to show her and Amy Adams in a black, sisterly huddle.In fact, there's lots of drama in this drama, which makes it all very dramatic.

1226752,A2YFFQQ2100DKO,B001PA0FF4,"Michael Giltz ""Michael in New York""","[3, 12]","Doubt was a wonderful play with four powerhouse actors led by Cherry Jones in a performance for the ages. I love Meryl Streep (what film buff doesn't) but couldn't for the life of me understand why playwright John Patrick Shanley would ignore the dream cast in place and put in mostly all new people. I know, I know. Box office. But wouldn't you want to capture the play as well as possible and let the box office take care of itself? The film is a complete misfire from start to finish. Virtually every decision by Shanley is misguided. (I loved his movie Joe Versus The Volcano and have waited for him to direct ever since, by the way.) In the movie, we meet the little boy who Streep suspects is being molested by a priest. Later in the film, it will be a thunderclap of a revelation when the boy's mother indicates she thinks her son might be gay. But that's ruined when the boy walks into church and asks a fellow altar boy if he thinks the pants the boy is wearing make him look fat? Is that really Shanley's idea of how a gay kid in the early 60s might talk? Smaller and larger details are wrong too. During Sunday mass, three or four kids are literally turned around in their seats and chatting away during the sermon until Streep swoops down on them and shushes them up. This would absolutely never have happened. Even today kids might whisper something to the kid next to them (until their parents made them shut up) or even break down in giggles. But just chatting away as if they're at McDonalds? No way. it's just a chance to show how stern Streep is but the result is an inability to suspend disbelief. I was furious at Shanley for quite a while. But the truth is that this play would have been extremely hard to film. Much of its power comes from the theatricality, from the fact that we never see the little boy (or any kids, for that matter). All of that had to change with the film and I don't know that it could have been done well. But it remains a shame that the performance by Jones will only live on in my memory. Actually, if the film would have spoiled that memory by an awkward attempt to recreate it, maybe I'm glad after all.",1,A great play becomes a botched movie,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,2153,"['Doubt', 'was', 'wonderful', 'play', 'four', 'powerhouse', 'actors', 'led', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'performance', 'ages', 'love', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'what', 'film', 'buff', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'playwright', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'would', 'ignore', 'dream', 'cast', 'place', 'put', 'mostly', 'new', 'people', 'know', 'know', 'Box', 'office', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'capture', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'let', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'care', 'film', 'complete', 'misfire', 'start', 'finish', 'Virtually', 'decision', 'Shanley', 'misguided', 'loved', 'movie', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'have', 'waited', 'direct', 'ever', 'way', 'movie', 'meet', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'Streep', 'being', 'molested', 'priest', 'Later', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'thunderclap', 'revelation', 'when', 'boy', 'mother', 'son', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'ruined', 'when', 'boy', 'church', 'fellow', 'altar', 'boy', 'pants', 'boy', 'wearing', 'make', 'look', 'fat', 'really', 'Shanley', 'idea', 'how', 'gay', 'kid', 'early', '60s', 'might', 'talk', 'Smaller', 'larger', 'details', 'are', 'wrong', 'too', 'Sunday', 'mass', 'three', 'four', 'kids', 'are', 'literally', 'turned', 'around', 'seats', 'chatting', 'away', 'sermon', 'Streep', 'swoops', 'down', 'shushes', 'up', 'would', 'absolutely', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'Even', 'today', 'kids', 'might', 'whisper', 'something', 'kid', 'next', 'parents', 'made', 'shut', 'up', 'even', 'break', 'down', 'giggles', 'just', 'chatting', 'away', ""'re"", 'McDonalds', 'way', 'just', 'chance', 'show', 'how', 'stern', 'Streep', 'result', 'inability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'was', 'furious', 'Shanley', 'quite', 'while', 'truth', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'hard', 'film', 'Much', 'power', 'theatricality', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'little', 'boy', 'kids', 'matter', 'had', 'change', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'well', 'shame', 'performance', 'Jones', 'will', 'only', 'live', 'memory', 'Actually', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'spoiled', 'memory', 'awkward', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'glad']",N/A

1226758,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001PA0FF4,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","""Doubt"" is an adaptation of the acclaimed theatrical play by John Patrick Stanley, set in a small Catholic school in 1964, as the nation and Church are poised for great social change. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a friendly, easy-going man who teaches the boys basketball at the St. Nicholas School and gives the 8th graders light-hearted advice on their nascent social lives. The school's principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), is a humorless disciplinarian suspicious of Flynn's outgoing disposition and progressive ideas. Those suspicions infect a kindly young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), who reports some unusual behavior of the school's first and only black student (Joseph Foster) after a private meeting with Father Flynn. That's enough to convince Sister Aloysius that Flynn is a child molester who must be driven out.John Patrick Stanley took inspiration from the Catholic school he attended as a child in the Bronx and a nun of the Sisters of Charity who was a favorite teacher. He adapted the play for the screen himself and also directs the film. I wondered if this might result in a movie that looks like a play on film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the its beauty. Roger Deacons' cinematography makes an impression immediately, while the opening credits are still rolling. He has created many striking shots, including some unexpected canted shots that don't seem unnatural or self-conscious. ""Doubt"" is still a film whose action takes place in conversations between its characters; it's not visually dynamic. But it is visually captivating -much  moreso than I expected from a film that is about the interactions between four people in one location.The secret of ""Doubt""'s success may be that it is perceived differently by different people. I don't think there is agreement on what it's all about. At first the audience wonders if Father Flynn is guilty of misconduct. Eventually, we don't care, because so many other interesting questions have been raised. People are not what we expected and not what they expected of each other. There is a lot going on in the minds of these characters, and that's where the story lies. The idea of ""doubt"" is curious, because Sister Aloysius never has proof of anything; she only has her certainty. She banishes doubt, because she is incapable of acting without certainty. Many people wouldn't sweat the doubts so much in condemning their enemy.Is it acceptable to stray from the values that we claim to espouse in the pursuit of justice? Are we to condemn people for what they do or for what they are? ""Doubt"" raises a host of contemporary issues in a confined period drama. The most amazing thing it does is to introduce a third perspective, just when we're thinking that the battle is between Sister Aloysius' obsessive intolerance and Father Flynn's conspicuous kindness. The perspective is that of the boy's mother, Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), who turns everything upside down in just one scene. I laughed out loud at Sister Aloysius' reaction: ""This will not do."" The actors pack so much into their performances. ""Doubt"" is a thought-provoking film and a bit of a chameleon.The DVD ( Miramax 2009): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""From Stage to Screen"" (19 min) interviews John Patrick Stanley about his inspiration for the play and adapting it for the screen, as well as the actors and production designer David Gropman. ""The Cast of Doubt"" (14 min) is an interview of the principle cast by Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly. In ""Scoring Doubt"" (4 1/2 min), composer Howard Shore and Shanley talk about the music. ""Sisters of Charity"" (6 1/2 min) interviews 4 nuns from the Sisters of Charity order, including the woman who inspired the Sister James character, about their lifestyle then and now.  The audio commentary by John Patrick Shanley talks a great deal about the time and place in which the story takes place. He also offers some information on visual decisions, sets, and filming.

1226763,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B001PA0FF4,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[3, 6]","This film opens with a view of a street scene from the sixties. We see the neighborhood and those who inhabit it, preparing for the daily parade to the center of the community, the Catholic Church. And that is as far as we are taken from church grounds. Without researching the production, I can be reasonably sure that it originated as a play. It is not so much what happens on these grounds that is the reason we are here, it is what might have occurred.This is a story-based film, and one that I was looking forward to. Philip Seymour Hoffman is an outstanding actor (and one of my favorites. Meryl Streep isn't but she is excellent in everything she chooses to be a part of. With story being the action, I didn't feel enough kick. It was too subdued. What we received packed little punch and was nothing more than an episode of `Little House on the Prairie'. I say this because in the end it was always the moral of the story that was most important. And often times, that was left for the viewer to interpret. This is central to 'Doubt' as well.I loved the feel of the film, as I was raised in the sixties. Everything looked right and it brought back memories of a time when buildings had character, automobiles were distinct and the people who lived around you were not strangers.It is a period piece that succeeds exceedingly well on that level. And true to form, Meryl Streep is fantastic. I had thought that this took place in any one of the cities with a large Irish population But Ms. Streep has an unmistakable Boston accent (and perfect I might add).The Catholic Church in America is a once powerful entity that for a time was as influential as the government itself. But it began to crumble; as did the government when the truth was revealed to those whose support made the institutions possible. Lying beneath the surface was an ugly network of pathetically powerful men. A cabal based on power, greed, lust and deception. Demons who were meant to dwell in the final chapter of the book they used to advance their cause.

1226765,AF17B68RFKUW4,B001PA0FF4,Mrs. Robinson,"[5, 5]","Some years ago, before John Patrick Shanley's play ""Doubt"" was made into a movie, I read a magazine interview with him about this work. The sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church had broken a few years before, and Mr. Shanley remarked that at the same time much of this abuse must have been taking place, religious sisters were leaving their communities in droves. He pointed out that as many of the sisters were teachers in Catholic schools, they would have been in a position to be aware that something was wrong if a student were being abused, that in some cases they must have surely known about it. At the same time, their position was such that they had little recourse. He speculated that this may have been a driving factor behind many sisters' decision to leave the religious life. This speculation led him to write the script for ""Doubt"", a subtle, intricate, haunting movie about not just abuse, but about power -- the differences in power between adults and children, between blacks and whites, between teachers and students, between different members of a religious order, and between women religious and their male priests.Do I think the priest was guilty? Absolutely -- but ultimately we cannot know. The story plays out as a long, beautifully nuanced sketch of the characters of the two antagonists, though, showing how each one wields his or her particular type of power and shows his or her motivations.Sister Aloysius is the sort of person easy for contemporary Americans to laugh at, the dragon lady principal of a Catholic school who strolls the nave at Mass searching for misbehaving students, smacking heads, grabbing ears, barking harsh reprimands for minor infractions. She hates Frosty the Snowman because of his ""pagan"" origin. She has a thing about ballpoint pens. She has a maddening, almost unshakeable certainty that looks an awful lot like prejudice at times. And yet, she is also simply -- right most of the time. She is a shrewd, experienced observer who doesn't miss a trick and is usually proved correct -- for example, she clearly has William Lunden's number when she asks Sister James if his nosebleed was self-induced!Probably a lot of viewers want to root for Father Flynn because he is more likeable. He tells jokes. (Sister Aloysius does, too, but her sense of humor is so dry that they tend to fall flat.) He hangs out with the kids and speaks to them about things that would concern and interest them, like how to shoot a basket or ask a girl to dance. He smiles; he is warm and physical. He says the Church must change by engaging popular culture, loosening up on secularism, and most importantly by showing that priests and religious are just like everyone else. This will appeal to many contemporary American viewers.Yet this warm and charismatic man, who I think genuinely sees himself as a liberator and a champion, is also a callous, louche, loose-lipped sensualist. We see this most strikingly in the dinner he shares with the delightedly laughing bishop: Red-faced, shoveling in rare beef and swilling alcohol, his eyes gleaming with meanspirited glee, he can barely contain himself as he regales his dining companions with a cruel personal story about a woman who more than likely is or was his parishioner, under his spiritual care. The contrast between this self-indulgent and ill-mannered meal is in painful contrast to the humble, ascetic dinner shared by the sisters, who eat the gristle with their meat and quietly drink milk.We know that this man is vain and of questionable masculinity (at least according to the conventions of the time) because he fusses over his long, immaculate fingernails. His comment about the length of his nails is interesting: Yes, they're ""a little long"", but they're clean, and that makes it all right. One wonders what other kinds of unusual behavior he considers acceptable as long as one observes the niceties.He talks more than once about compassion, highlighting his own. But is he so compassionate? Look at the way he interacts with Donald Miller, the lone black student he has taken under his wing. After the Mass that opens the movie, the boy looks at his adored pastor with shining eyes and a shy, confiding smile and tells him that he wants to be a priest. What would the proper response be? Couldn't Father Flynn have taken a few minutes to talk to the boy about whether or not he had a vocation, offering him real encouragement and giving him real feedback? Instead, he makes a throwaway comment about how Donald would surely make a good priest, then gives him a little toy. Does he even take the boy's expressed wish seriously? (And what an interesting toy! A scantily clad dancer spinning endlessly in front of a mirror, perhaps a subtle reference to Father's exhibitionism and narcissism?)The other scene that really stood out for me as showing the shallow, self-serving nature of Father's vaunted compassion was the one where William Lunden grabs and spills the contents of Donald Miller's book bag in the middle of a busy hallway. A caring adult witnessing this scene would come to Donald's aid, help him pick up his things, maybe offer a quick, encouraging word. That wouldn't be good enough for Father Flynn! Instead of offering him practical assistance, he takes the boy in his arms and cuddles him, right there in the hall with other students bumping past, in a way that might be appropriate for a very small child, but certainly not for a middle schooler, especially a boy! Does this look caring, or does it look like showy behavior that only serves to make Donald look even more conspicuous than he already is? And more suspect.Contrast this with Sister Aloysius' behind-the-scenes concern for Donald. In her talk with Sister James, she makes clear that when a student hits Donald, it will be for the last time. When discussing the Christmas pageant, she is concerned that he be equally included with the other students but not made to stand out. In her much-noted scene with Donald's mother, her distress for the boy -- for his innocence, for the injustice of his situation, for his victimization at the hands of his violent father -- is clear. This scene, incidentally, is a standout not just for the superb acting on both sides -- doesn't Viola Davis tear up the screen in her brief appearance! Wow! -- but for its painful depiction of two women talking past each other, unable to understand each other, both wanting to protect Donald but at loggerheads because of the different share of power each woman has in the world. As a black woman in the '60s married to a brutal, unloving man, Mrs. Miller has almost none. Sister Aloysius has some, but mostly in the fact that she is highly intelligent and willing to be ruthless in the pursuit of right. She sees the long view, which includes Donald's soul and his future emotional intactness, whereas Mrs. Miller, inescably constrained by circumstance, can only see till June. Yet both women care deeply for the boy, whereas Father cares for how he personally is seen. He cares very much that he should be the one Sister James sees as looking out for Donald; he tells her as much, bluntly, in words that mirror those of an emotionally abusive parent castigating an ex-spouse to a child.I found it striking that whereas Sisters James and Aloysius both do what they can to preserve the innocence of the flirtatious girl (I can't remember her name), Father Flynn encourages her (shudder!) to tell the boy with whom she was ""in love"" all about her feelings. Who is more careful of the well-being of that child, the sisters or Father?Abusers come in all styles and persuasions, with some, like Father Flynn, priding themselves on being progressives, and others more conservative and traditional. The propensity to be an abuser has nothing to do with theological orthodoxy, politics, or personality type. However, Father Flynn reveals himself to be hypocritical in his progressiveness. For all that he waxes passionate about priests and religious coming down among the people and showing themselves to be no different, he sure doesn't like it when his privileged position is challenged, pulling rank on Sister Aloysius as he belligerently reminds her of her vows of obedience and the fact that she has no right to ask a fellow nun about his past behavior. This follows a great deal of disrespectful and inappropriate behavior toward her: belittling her to her subordinate (""The dragon is hungry"" comment at the beginning), openly digging at her during their first meeting by letting her know pointedly that he is going to give a sermon on intolerance, indirectly accusing her of ""gossip"" simply for doing her job and asking questions about his suspicious behavior (which she has the right and responsibility to do as principal), twitting her about her Lenten sacrifice of sugar, and taking her seat behind the desk in her own office. His progressiveness is merely self-serving, something that allows him to do what he wants while still enjoying the perks of kingly authority over the sisters, lavish meals every night, the ear of the admiring bishop.When Sister Aloysius breaks down at the movie's close and tearfully confesses her ""doubts"", I don't think she is saying that she doubts Father Flynn's guilt. I think she is deeply distressed that her move to protect the boys at her school has resulted in Father having unlimited access to the boys of another school; I think she doubts the hierarchy that is not doing its job of shepherding and protecting the flock; she is disillusioned by the painfully apparent good ole boys' network that keeps her from being able to do her job and protect the students under her care; and I think she doubts God, Who allows evil to flourish.I can agree neither with Sister Aloysius' dishonesty, her ruthlessness in forcing a confession, nor her attitude toward addressing wrongdoing. Does one really step away from God ""in His service"" when making a move to redress wrong? How can it be so? Yet what a powerful, anguished portrait of what can happen to someone spiritually when struggling for justice in the face of appalling abuse of power and the failure of those in charge to listen.",5,It Takes a Cat ...

Then, you have to adjust to Meryl Streep's heavy Brooklyn accent, which is so over-the-top it's a hoot. Flickering lights and blowing leaves are also a heavy-handed device.Beyond that, you can settle in to enjoy a story that is full of intrigue, despite the lack of much onscreen action. Did the priest molest a boy or didn't he?Without printing any spoilers, I will say that I doubted that Meryl Streep's nun could have the power to bring down a Catholic priest of that era. Today, after the pedophile scandals, yes. In the 1960s, no. Also, if there is any doubt about the priest's guilt, why does he act the way he does? It didn't add up for me. Doubts of faith seemed plausible to me, doubts of other kinds didn't.Still, I much prefer this kind of movie, in which the inner lives of the protagonists are rich, and their motives mixed.

1226770,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B001PA0FF4,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 1]","John Patrick Shanley has turned his prize-winning stage drama into a cinema version that is richly flavored and expands slightly on his theme of power, corruption and moral authority in a Catholic Church during the 1960s. At the heart of the tale is a progressive-minded priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is viewed as highly suspect by a tyrannical nun (Meryl Streep) who personifies all that was wrong with the strict nuns who thought that harsh discipline and humiliation was the way to rule the school classroom. The old vs. the new is what happens when these two clash.Very unlike what happened when Hollywood first tackled the subject of old vs. new in films like GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S where a young priest has to cope with the unchanging steel will of a crusty old parish priest.Here the subject matter is much more serious too, involving the suspicions of a nun eager to seize on any reason for ridding the parish of Father Flynn whom she accuses of an immoral act with a young altar boy in his charge, based on very flimsy evidence of another naive young Sister James (Amy Adams).The story becomes a character study of these three as they confront the issues raised by the domineering Sister Aloysius (Streep) who insists on a private meeting with Flynn in which the accusations fly fast and furious. This scene is super-charged with emotion and dramatically effective--but even more striking fireworks are yet to come when we meet the mother of the boy (Viola Davis) who is brilliant in her two big scenes with Streep during which another twist is given to the tale.To tell any more would be to spoil this for anyone not familiar with the material. Clearly, Shanley has written a very powerful drama and staged it with simplicity and truth in a way that is cinematic without losing any of its dramatic force as a play.For the performances alone, highly recommended as a thinking man's morality play that never quite gives you the feeling that you know all the answers to the riddle presented. It's open to many interpretations, but there's no doubt about one thing--this is a stark, emotional drama and Shanley makes the transfer to screen full of cinematic magic.",5,Fascinating character study of morality and authority in the Church...,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2194,"['John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'turned', 'prize-winning', 'stage', 'drama', 'cinema', 'version', 'richly', 'flavored', 'slightly', 'theme', 'power', 'corruption', 'moral', 'authority', 'Catholic', 'Church', '1960s', 'heart', 'tale', 'progressive-minded', 'priest', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'viewed', 'highly', 'suspect', 'tyrannical', 'nun', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'was', 'wrong', 'strict', 'nuns', 'who', 'thought', 'harsh', 'discipline', 'humiliation', 'was', 'way', 'rule', 'school', 'classroom', 'old', 'vs.', 'new', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'clash.Very', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'tackled', 'subject', 'old', 'vs.', 'new', 'films', 'GOING', 'MY', 'WAY', 'THE', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'ST.', 'MARY', 'where', 'young', 'priest', 'cope', 'unchanging', 'steel', 'will', 'crusty', 'old', 'parish', 'priest.Here', 'subject', 'matter', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'too', 'involving', 'suspicions', 'nun', 'eager', 'seize', 'reason', 'ridding', 'parish', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'whom', 'immoral', 'act', 'young', 'altar', 'boy', 'charge', 'based', 'very', 'flimsy', 'evidence', 'naive', 'young', 'Sister', 'James', 'Amy', 'Adams', '.The', 'story', 'character', 'study', 'three', 'confront', 'issues', 'raised', 'domineering', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Streep', 'who', 'private', 'meeting', 'Flynn', 'accusations', 'fly', 'fast', 'furious', 'scene', 'super-charged', 'emotion', 'dramatically', 'effective', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'fireworks', 'are', 'yet', 'come', 'when', 'meet', 'mother', 'boy', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'brilliant', 'two', 'big', 'scenes', 'Streep', 'twist', 'given', 'tale.To', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'material', 'Clearly', 'Shanley', 'written', 'very', 'powerful', 'drama', 'staged', 'simplicity', 'truth', 'way', 'cinematic', 'losing', 'dramatic', 'force', 'play.For', 'performances', 'alone', 'highly', 'recommended', 'thinking', 'man', 'morality', 'play', 'never', 'quite', 'feeling', 'know', 'answers', 'riddle', 'presented', 'open', 'many', 'interpretations', 'doubt', 'one', 'thing', 'stark', 'emotional', 'drama', 'Shanley', 'transfer', 'screen', 'full', 'cinematic', 'magic']",N/A
1226771,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B001PA0FF4,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[14, 30]","Doubt (2008) tries to pass itself off as being about a morally ambiguous situation in which a conflict arises between an old nun and a young priest and there is simply insufficient information to determine who is the real wrongdoer.  However, what this film is really about is such questions as those of faith and certainty and doubt - the kinds of questions that plague philosophers.For a movie about a moral problem with insufficient information the movie fails for failing to take a clear unequivocal stance in comdemning a clear wrong - either the clear wrong of a man preying on young children or the clear wrong of gossiping about those you know and damaging their reputations.  There is no ""doubt"" about this matter.  Both are clear wrongs and it must be one or the other.As a philosophical movie that calls into question the nature of faith, the movie also fails in providing no termination point to the endless succession of generating doubts other than the apparent fact that absolute skepticism is self-refuting.  As such, the movie ends up wallowing in doubt which ultimately will lead to despair.  The movie does nothing to rectify this situation, offers no way out of this dreaded impasse, and leaves us in the midst of the mental meltdown of the old nun afflicted with this disease.  For failing to offer us hope and a foundation upon which one can build one's faith, this movie fails as well choosing instead to leave us dangling right over the abyss.The movie also tries to address Catholic issues, showing the apparent conflict between the old-pre-Vatican II church and the changes made post-Vatican II.  The movie considers the ""old church"" to be one based on discipline and ethically rooted in the notion of virtue, which the modernist priest seeks to replace with ""kindness"".  The well-meaning and idealistic young nun is certainly a likeable character in her innocence; however, it causes her to become so nave that she cannot even recognize that members of her own class are not listening or misbehaving until the old nun tips her off.  (Also, she thinks that FDR, Lincoln, and JFK were the three greatest presidents and states this pronouncement ex-cathedra coming straight from the chair of the self-appointed historical experts we all apparently know and look up to.)  Fortunately, the young nun learns that in order to control her class she must enforce some form of discipline, although she is not a harsh disciplinarian and apologizes once for being too harsh.  The old nun supposedly represents the pre-Vatican II church and places a portrait of Pope Pius XII above the board.  What is odd in this movie is how much power this woman has over a priest.  Further, she does not go to the proper channels, legal and hierarchical, but rather confronts the man himself, making a very awkward situation.  Ultimately however we simply do not have enough information to make a proper judgment as to who the guilty party is.  But we do know that we must unequivocally condemn them for either preying on young boys or for ruining the reputation of a good man.  The old nun appears to suffer from scrupulosity and is haunted by doubts and fears of sin in her own life and the lives of others.  She is a sympathetic character once we begin to understand the illness that afflicts her.  Unfortunately, the movie gives us nowhere to go from here.  It offers this woman no way to make redress, no way to ease her fears, no way to quash her doubts, and no foundation on which to build her faith.  As such, the movie creates a deplorable situation where everything becomes ambiguous and then wallows in its own doubt and moral relativism.  The movie of course will say that it is designed to make one think and that it is not meant to be ""anti-Catholic"", but ultimately it does neither and seems to serve largely as the all-too-familiar charges leveled against the church concerning pedophile priests, intolerant and strict old nuns, and a failing faith plagued by nagging doubts in a society in which doubt has been turned into a virtue.  As such, I feel that this film is positively harmful and its message is extremely negative and dissatisfying.  In the last scene, one searches for some hope but finds none.  Only further and further doubt persists.  Much as today's culture finds itself in.  A lack of fundamental trust where paranoia, fear, and mistrust run rampant.  A situation where it is possible to denounce those you know and work with for various crimes, real and imaginary.  And a general cloud of ambiguity that covers the whole thing making us believe that there are no moral absolutes anymore.  Thus, we see the real rot that has sank in as moral relativism inflicts its harm upon our culture and society and as doubt develops and lack of trust and paranoia ensues.--  a Catholic reviewer.",1,No Doubt.,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,4819,"['Doubt', '2008', 'pass', 'off', 'being', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'situation', 'conflict', 'old', 'nun', 'young', 'priest', 'simply', 'insufficient', 'information', 'determine', 'who', 'real', 'wrongdoer', 'However', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'such', 'questions', 'faith', 'certainty', 'doubt', 'kinds', 'questions', 'plague', 'philosophers.For', 'movie', 'moral', 'problem', 'insufficient', 'information', 'movie', 'failing', 'take', 'clear', 'unequivocal', 'stance', 'comdemning', 'clear', 'wrong', 'clear', 'wrong', 'man', 'preying', 'young', 'children', 'clear', 'wrong', 'gossiping', 'know', 'damaging', 'reputations', 'doubt', 'matter', 'are', 'clear', 'wrongs', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'other.As', 'philosophical', 'movie', 'question', 'nature', 'faith', 'movie', 'also', 'providing', 'termination', 'point', 'endless', 'succession', 'generating', 'doubts', 'other', 'apparent', 'fact', 'absolute', 'skepticism', 'self-refuting', 'such', 'movie', 'up', 'wallowing', 'doubt', 'ultimately', 'will', 'lead', 'despair', 'movie', 'nothing', 'rectify', 'situation', 'way', 'dreaded', 'impasse', 'midst', 'mental', 'meltdown', 'old', 'nun', 'afflicted', 'disease', 'failing', 'offer', 'hope', 'foundation', 'one', 'can', 'build', 'one', 'faith', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'choosing', 'instead', 'leave', 'dangling', 'right', 'abyss.The', 'movie', 'also', 'address', 'Catholic', 'issues', 'showing', 'apparent', 'conflict', 'old-pre-Vatican', 'II', 'church', 'changes', 'made', 'post-Vatican', 'II', 'movie', 'old', 'church', 'be', 'one', 'based', 'discipline', 'ethically', 'rooted', 'notion', 'virtue', 'modernist', 'priest', 'replace', 'kindness', 'well-meaning', 'idealistic', 'young', 'nun', 'certainly', 'likeable', 'character', 'innocence', 'however', 'become', 'so', 'nave', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'recognize', 'members', 'own', 'class', 'are', 'not', 'listening', 'misbehaving', 'old', 'nun', 'off', 'Also', 'FDR', 'Lincoln', 'JFK', 'were', 'three', 'greatest', 'presidents', 'states', 'pronouncement', 'ex-cathedra', 'coming', 'straight', 'chair', 'self-appointed', 'historical', 'experts', 'apparently', 'know', 'look', 'up', 'Fortunately', 'young', 'nun', 'order', 'control', 'class', 'must', 'enforce', 'form', 'discipline', 'not', 'harsh', 'disciplinarian', 'once', 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'old', 'nun', 'supposedly', 'pre-Vatican', 'II', 'church', 'portrait', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'board', 'What', 'odd', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'power', 'woman', 'over', 'priest', 'not', 'go', 'proper', 'channels', 'legal', 'hierarchical', 'rather', 'man', 'making', 'very', 'awkward', 'situation', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'information', 'make', 'proper', 'judgment', 'who', 'guilty', 'party', 'do', 'know', 'must', 'unequivocally', 'condemn', 'preying', 'young', 'boys', 'ruining', 'reputation', 'good', 'man', 'old', 'nun', 'suffer', 'scrupulosity', 'haunted', 'doubts', 'fears', 'sin', 'own', 'life', 'lives', 'others', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'begin', 'understand', 'illness', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'go', 'here', 'woman', 'way', 'make', 'redress', 'way', 'ease', 'fears', 'way', 'quash', 'doubts', 'foundation', 'build', 'faith', 'such', 'movie', 'deplorable', 'situation', 'where', 'everything', 'ambiguous', 'then', 'own', 'doubt', 'moral', 'relativism', 'movie', 'course', 'will', 'say', 'designed', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'anti-Catholic', 'ultimately', 'serve', 'largely', 'all-too-familiar', 'charges', 'leveled', 'church', 'concerning', 'pedophile', 'priests', 'intolerant', 'strict', 'old', 'nuns', 'failing', 'faith', 'plagued', 'nagging', 'doubts', 'society', 'doubt', 'been', 'turned', 'virtue', 'such', 'feel', 'film', 'positively', 'harmful', 'message', 'extremely', 'negative', 'dissatisfying', 'last', 'scene', 'one', 'searches', 'hope', 'none', 'Only', 'further', 'further', 'doubt', 'Much', 'today', 'culture', 'lack', 'fundamental', 'trust', 'where', 'paranoia', 'fear', 'mistrust', 'run', 'rampant', 'situation', 'where', 'possible', 'denounce', 'know', 'work', 'various', 'crimes', 'real', 'imaginary', 'general', 'cloud', 'ambiguity', 'whole', 'thing', 'making', 'believe', 'are', 'moral', 'absolutes', 'anymore', 'Thus', 'see', 'real', 'rot', 'sank', 'as', 'moral', 'relativism', 'harm', 'culture', 'society', 'doubt', 'develops', 'lack', 'trust', 'paranoia', 'ensues.', 'Catholic', 'reviewer']",N/A

Wow. It was not as dark a movie as I had feared, performances are uniformly astonishing and the film keeps you second-guessing (which, I imagine, is the point).Inevitably, Streep is the star of this film. The legendary actress plays Sister Aloysius Beauvier, a nun who serves as the principal at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The year is 1964, and the school has just admitted its first black student (Donald, played by Joseph Foster) in the fall. There's a charismatic new priest in St. Nicholas parish - Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Father Flynn often finds himself at odds with Sister Aloysius' strict ways with the schoolchildren and her faith.So when young, naive Sister James (Amy Adams) mentions to Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may have taken a bit too much interest in Donald, Sister Aloysius becomes certain that the relationship has developed into something improper.Without proof, the two nuns confront Father Flynn, who defends his innocence. Undaunted, Sister Aloysius schedules a meeting with Donald's mother (played with heartbreaking genius by Viola Davis). The woman, who is dealing with her own suspicions about Donald's nature as well as violence in the home, provides Sister Aloysius with no method through which to exercise her moral certainty.As Sister Aloysius becomes more and more definite in her efforts to oust Father Flynn, questions of faith and doubt emerge in stark relief.What can I say about this movie? Meryl Streep is a goddess, and anyone who denies it is a fool. The woman is Proteus-like in her ability to inhabit any character with utter credibility. It completely blows my mind. Adams and Hoffman aren't slouches, either, but Streep owns this movie.Though the story line isn't a happy one, rest assured that the film focuses on Sister Aloysius and her quest. The film purposefully neither confirms nor denies the suspected relationship between the priest and the boy, leaving the viewer to wonder if the nun's conviction has any truth.A fascinating character study.

There is no ending. Well, there is, but then again there isn't. What we're left with is our handbag of biases. Was Meryl Streep correct in her assertion that Philip Seymour Hoffman molested a boy at St. Nicholas, or was he innocent? We'll never know.I watched this movie with different audiences, each group asserting swaying judgments, depending mostly on their methods of interpretation. Personally, I think he's innocent. But here's the ultimate lesson to be learned. Gossip destroys. If you want to take down the reputation of any man, claim him to be a sex offender.

1226775,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,B001PA0FF4,NostalgiaVHS,"[1, 1]","Phillip Seymour Hoffman had a great year in 2008 as he starred in both Charlie Kaufman's 'Synecdoche, New York' and in 'Doubt', an understated drama in which he portrays a young and optimistic priest who finds himself at odds with a strict nun played by Meryl Streep. Both performances are fantastic, each actor perfectly capturing every emotional nuance of their character. Every line has meaning and is delivered to a T by the amazing talented cast.Doubt is based off a play by the film's director, John Patrick Shanley. The film is composed mainly of dialogue scenes, but the lack of cinematic action is compensated by the beautiful cinematography and set design. Doubt is a period piece set in the mid-60's and captures that time period very well. The plot itself is symbolic of the culture clash that occurred at that time, one of the film's many layers.Doubt is mostly carried by the performances of the two main leads, who do a masterful job of portraying these very complex and emotional characters dealing with some very intense and contentious situations.

1226776,AITI12BBKCYG9,B001PA0FF4,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[1, 1]","Very few films I've seen (made in the last decade or so, at least) rightly deserve the adjective compelling. So many deliver either a skillfully-crafted plot or singular performances by a certain actor or an ensemble cast, but seldom does the combination of both cinematic aspects meld to form a truly amazing movie. Doubt, written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, delivers the exception to the rule, and the result is a miracle to behold.I won't divulge many specifics because Doubt is a creature that must be experienced without much foreknowledge in order to be fully appreciated. The setting is a Roman Catholic grade school, St. Nicholas, located in the Bronx; the year is 1964. The protagonist is a Sister of Charity, S. Aloysius, who is the school's principal as well as the superior of the convent. Rev. Brendan Flynn is the curate (assistant priest) of St. Nicholas Church.Suffice it to say the two are at odds over most everything--but usually in a subdued, intellectual manner. Sister Aloysius is stern and old-fashioned; Father Flynn is relaxed and progressive. Meryl Streep is unforgettable as the principal; one can scarcely imagine any other actress breathing such forceful life into the role. Ms. Streep can infuse the tiniest act--the raising of an eyebrow, a murmured ""hmm""--with oceans of disdain and derision as no other actress today. Philip Seymour Hoffman, a character actor who has justifiably garnered a reputation for his considerable talent, delivers a nuanced performance as the priest.Another great talent is the fresh-faced Amy Adams, who plays Sister James, a young nun who is neatly--and regrettably--thrust between the two leads and their duelling philosophies of education and spirituality.This is a thinking film. Based on the play which Shanley wrote, it is incredibly dialogue-driven, but the pacing is impeccable. From the first syllable of Father Flynn's homily at the outset of the storyline the viewer is drawn in as the leads contend inexorably with one another until one of them proves victorious.One of the many questions the viewer will come away with after watching is: Who won? And at what cost?Anyone who has seen this movie will tell you: ""I believed X""; the crux of the drama evolves from suspicion and self-defense on the part of the nun and the priest toward one another. The polarization of opinion should lead to intense discussion among viewers. Be assured this film will appeal to a wide audience; it is not solely fixated on the Catholic Church, although those familiar with Catholicism will perhaps comprehend more fully some of the themes and issues raised in the plot. At its core Doubt speaks to sweeping concepts applicable to everyone: faith and faithlessness, optimism and pessimism, mercy and justice, right and wrong.A gross travesty of the 2009 Oscars was that this phenomenal piece didn't receive a single gold statue (it was, however, nominated for five of them).I invite the reader to obtain a copy and examine the credibility of Doubt.",5,Without a Doubt,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,3011,"['Very', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'least', 'rightly', 'deserve', 'adjective', 'compelling', 'So', 'many', 'deliver', 'skillfully-crafted', 'plot', 'singular', 'performances', 'certain', 'actor', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'seldom', 'combination', 'cinematic', 'aspects', 'meld', 'form', 'truly', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Doubt', 'written', 'directed', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'exception', 'rule', 'result', 'miracle', 'behold.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'many', 'specifics', 'Doubt', 'creature', 'must', 'be', 'experienced', 'much', 'foreknowledge', 'order', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'setting', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'grade', 'school', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'located', 'Bronx', 'year', '1964', 'protagonist', 'Sister', 'Charity', 'S.', 'Aloysius', 'who', 'school', 'principal', 'as', 'well', 'superior', 'convent', 'Rev', 'Brendan', 'Flynn', 'curate', 'assistant', 'priest', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'Church.Suffice', 'say', 'two', 'are', 'odds', 'most', 'everything', 'usually', 'subdued', 'intellectual', 'manner', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'stern', 'old-fashioned', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'relaxed', 'progressive', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'unforgettable', 'principal', 'one', 'can', 'scarcely', 'imagine', 'other', 'actress', 'breathing', 'such', 'forceful', 'life', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'can', 'infuse', 'tiniest', 'act', 'raising', 'eyebrow', 'murmured', 'hmm', 'oceans', 'disdain', 'derision', 'other', 'actress', 'today', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'justifiably', 'garnered', 'reputation', 'considerable', 'talent', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'priest.Another', 'great', 'talent', 'fresh-faced', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'Sister', 'James', 'young', 'nun', 'who', 'neatly', 'regrettably', 'thrust', 'two', 'leads', 'duelling', 'philosophies', 'education', 'spirituality.This', 'thinking', 'film', 'Based', 'play', 'Shanley', 'wrote', 'incredibly', 'dialogue-driven', 'pacing', 'impeccable', 'first', 'syllable', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'homily', 'outset', 'storyline', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'leads', 'contend', 'inexorably', 'one', 'one', 'victorious.One', 'many', 'questions', 'viewer', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'watching', 'Who', 'won', 'what', 'cost', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'tell', 'believed', 'X', 'crux', 'drama', 'suspicion', 'self-defense', 'part', 'nun', 'priest', 'one', 'polarization', 'opinion', 'should', 'lead', 'intense', 'discussion', 'viewers', 'Be', 'assured', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience', 'not', 'solely', 'fixated', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'familiar', 'Catholicism', 'will', 'perhaps', 'comprehend', 'more', 'fully', 'themes', 'issues', 'raised', 'plot', 'core', 'Doubt', 'sweeping', 'concepts', 'applicable', 'everyone', 'faith', 'faithlessness', 'optimism', 'pessimism', 'mercy', 'justice', 'right', 'wrong.A', 'gross', 'travesty', '2009', 'Oscars', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'piece', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'single', 'gold', 'statue', 'was', 'however', 'nominated', 'five', 'invite', 'reader', 'obtain', 'copy', 'examine', 'credibility', 'Doubt']",N/A

I tried to compose a review without PLOT SPOILERS but found that I could not adequately convey that which was haunting and praiseworthy about the film.  This fine film is built on a foundation of uncertainty, doubt, suspense and surprise.  If you haven't seen it yet, and want to enjoy it as much as I did, don't spoil the experience -- just go ahead and rent/buy it without reading further.***I found this a magnificent film; it has haunted me fairly intensely since we saw it last night.  The performances are magnificent, as you would expect from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep.  The direction and pacing suited the storyline extremely well.  The film is intense and somewhat claustrophobic, with dire events playing out in a close community andwithin an enclosed space.  This accentuates both the isolation and the lack of privacy of Meryl Streep's character as she must confront an awful situation, largely alone.As it develops, the film pulls you this way and that, leading you first toward one conclusion, then to another, back and forth until by the end the terrible truth cannot be denied, despite it having been a purely circumstantial case.  The film ends with the fulfillment of a great act of heroism, which is then quickly undermined, leaving the abiding faith of the protagonist deeply shaken.  Because the protagonist is at first so unlikable, it takes time for the viewer to appreciate her virtues and ultimately her heroism, which renders the film's faith-shaking denouement all the more tragically felt.I tend to rebel against most film clich&eacute;s, but one that I am known to eat up -- and did again in this film -- is the counterpoise of an unlikable protagonist and a seductive villain.  In this film, the hero is indeed deeply flawed, and while the actions of the villain are unforgivable, he is also possessed of some good intentions, or at least has convinced himself that he is.The premise of the film is that two nuns suspect a priest in their church/school of being a child molester.  They - and the viewer - have nothing concrete to go on, only circumstantial evidence and intuition.  One of them is grabs the first opportunity to believe ""proof"" that her suspicions are ill-founded, whereas the other continues to believe in his guilt, and pursues him relentlessly and fearlessly until that guilt is implicitly admitted.The film toys with the viewer a great deal, dropping suggestions of guilt, then quickly supplying exculpatory explanations.  How the viewer reacts to all this may be influenced by knowledge of the breadth of this problem as it is now known to have existed in the American Catholic church over this time period.  With this in mind, the viewer may be predisposed to see guilt in every circumstantial clue.  But I was influenced by other things as well - including the film Capturing the Friedmans, in which a family was basically railroaded on trumped-up charges of child molestation.  Awareness of these conflicting potential story directions makes the viewer feel guilty, and cynical, for seeing depravity in what might actually be pure acts of kindness.  One scene in which Hoffman hugs the student, who has just had his books spilled, could have been a model of Christian comfort were it not for the viewer's eyes probing for every evidence of impropriety.  Absent hard proof of anything, it comes down to what we each read into what little we do see, and we feel the uneasy basis on which to make a judgment.If there's one Hollywood clich&eacute; that really bugs me, it's the stereotype of the hypocritical sanctimonious religious blowhard, pointing the finger of accusation at everyone else while engaging in private indiscretions or even crimes.  Hollywood has beaten that one to death, and I found this film refreshing in its alternative portrayal.  Here the ramrod-straight religious conservative is actually the sincere, idealistic one, whereas the one who seems superficially more reasonable, pluralistic and tolerant who is actually up to no good.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is the one who thinks it's perfectly fine if Frosty the Snowman appears in the Christmas pageant, or if students have access to ballpoint pens, in contrast with Meryl Streep's uncompromisingly rigid ways. It's his comforting demeanor that causes Amy Adams's character to drop her suspicions, and even to turn on Meryl Streep for her intolerance, which proved later to be exactly the wrong call.Interestingly, people are at their least convincing in this film when they are making their own cases in oral conversation.  I was convinced of Phillip Hoffman's character's innocence until his conversation with Amy Adams in which he sounded like a creepy NAMBLA spokesman, trying to redefine ""love"" to suit a private twisted purpose.  And again, later in the film, even when no one has caught him doing anything, he destroys his credibility by the way that he tries to constrain Meryl Streep's avenues for checking on his past behavior.  Nor does Meryl Streep do herself many favors by the way she presents herself early; she leads the viewer to deem her a heartless tyrant before later revealing her inner compassion through action.  But each builds a more positive case for themselves with actions in other scenes - or at least, so it seems.The film is morally complex in that it shows a series of suppositions and intuitions leading to the accusation of a terrible crime, all in the absence of clear evidence.  The easiest type of film to make would be one in which it was all a big misunderstanding, and the lesson is not to jump to rash conclusions.  But in this case, the suppositions turn out to be right, raising the far more complex case of how to morally conduct oneself when one lacks clear information and the consequences of being wrong are terrible.  No jury could have convicted Hoffman's character on such flimsy evidence, but Streep's character lacked the luxury of legal certainty in moving to protect a child.The final confrontation between Hoffman and Streep is a powerful moment, in which Streep's character, a woman who has devoted her life to unquestioning service of the church, declares her loyalty to a higher moral sense - she in effect declares that she will do what she believes is right, to protect a child, regardless of how the church judges her and indeed regardless of how God judges her. She doesn't put it as directly as this in the film, but more artfully, and the effect is more moving than I am relaying here.In the final scene, when Streep's character expresses deep doubt while clutching her cross, she doesn't say what she doubts:  Hoffman's guilt?  Her own actions?  The actions of a church that basically just kicked him a level upstairs, free to prey?  Her own fundamental religious faith?  Whichever she means, she has plenty to doubt at that moment - her certainty of her moral rectitude has given way to a dumbfounding confusion in which her church and faith have failed to uphold the most fundamental principles of a moral society.It's so easy to imagine a lesser film being made from this material - how easy it would have been to craft a ham-fisted, preachy film, or one in which all religious people are portrayed as hypocrites, or a broadside attack on Catholicism, or any of a number of other lousy ideas.  Instead, Doubt is a riveting, emotionally buffeting, engrossing, moving film of great moral complexity and subtlety.",5,"Intense, morally complex, and powerful",1243123200,"05 24,

It isn't an easy movie to watch, but the performances are brilliant in every respect and the screenplay is possibly one of the best constructed I have seen in a very long time, perhaps because it is based on Shanley's play of the same name which enjoyed a long theatrical run.Set in 1964 in the Bronx, New York, the movie centers on Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the tough as nails principal of St. Nicholas school and her suspicions that the charismatic new priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), has taken too personal an interest in a young African American boy under his tutelage.  Though it is never spoken aloud, Beauvier is convinced that Flynn is sexually abusing the boy.  Thus the conflict begins as Beauvier searches for proof to confirm what she absolutely knows in her heart to be true and comes head to head with Flynn.Streep is brilliant as the old battle axe of a nun who is desperately trying to do the right thing.  Never once does she falter.  Never once does she doubt what Flynn is doing to the boy.  Or does she?  Streep plays this woman on many levels: the terror that she is to her students, a woman who enjoys her position of power but tries to be even handed in the meting out of discipline.  She is also a woman wholly devoted to the school and church, seeing that their solemn duty is to teach and guide these children, to protect them.  It is a multifaceted performance, resonant for anyone who had a scary nun as their principal during childhood.Hoffman as Flynn gets every beat right.  He oozes charisma as the priest trying to ""modernize"" the church by being more a friend to the children than a mentor or disciplinarian.  He is gregarious and approachable and charming, but when Streep turns her sights on him, one sees the danger and vindictiveness and manipulation that lies beneath the facade he presents to the world. You see the darkness inside him that makes you believe he was doing exactly what he is suspected of doing.Shanley also gets the entire abuse dynamic exactly right.  Like many priestly perpetrators, Flynn drifts toward the student who needs a friend the most...the outsider, the odd duck in the school:  the sole African American boy amongst a sea of pasty white faces.  Shanley shows us Flynn ""grooming"" the boy, drawing him in.  Shanley plants the seeds that Flynn very well could be sexually molesting the boy.  The other aspect that is completely spot on how these perpetrators justify their ""closeness"" with their kids as trying to modernize the church, trying to humanize it and become more friend than anything else.  The result is a performance by Hoffman that is charming in every way and intensely creepy and dirty.Viola Davis as the young boy's mother turns in an Oscar worthy performance as well as a woman who just doesn't want to know or is willing to look the other way with respect to what may be happening to her little boy.  Believe it or not, back in 1964 (and in some respects, still today) this was a very, very common reaction.  Close your eyes and it never happened.  Brilliant performance and completely realistic.The sole clink in this otherwise fine film is Amy Adams as Sister James, the newest nun whose naivete allows her first to suspect Flynn and then turn away from those foul thoughts when he offers the flimsiest of excuses.  The role really serves very little purpose in the film as portrayed by Adam, whose performance is whiny and one note. I found her annoying from the start and I longed for her scenes to be over quickly.As to whether Flynn did molest the boy or not...well, you'd have to see the movie.  One moment you'll think yes, and then next you'll think no.  That's the nature of Doubt and the question which is placed before every survivor of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest...prove it.Highly, highly recommended.",5,Tough to Watch but Worth It,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3949,"['ever', 'had', 'doubts', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'urge', 'set', 'aside', 'rent', ""n't"", 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'respect', 'screenplay', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'constructed', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'based', 'Shanley', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'theatrical', 'run.Set', '1964', 'Bronx', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'centers', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Beauvier', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'tough', 'nails', 'principal', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'school', 'suspicions', 'charismatic', 'new', 'priest', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'taken', 'too', 'personal', 'interest', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'boy', 'tutelage', 'never', 'spoken', 'aloud', 'Beauvier', 'convinced', 'Flynn', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'boy', 'Thus', 'conflict', 'Beauvier', 'searches', 'proof', 'confirm', 'what', 'absolutely', 'heart', 'be', 'true', 'head', 'head', 'Flynn.Streep', 'brilliant', 'old', 'battle', 'axe', 'nun', 'who', 'desperately', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Never', 'once', 'falter', 'Never', 'once', 'doubt', 'what', 'Flynn', 'doing', 'boy', 'Streep', 'woman', 'many', 'levels', 'terror', 'students', 'woman', 'who', 'position', 'power', 'tries', 'be', 'even', 'handed', 'meting', 'discipline', 'also', 'woman', 'wholly', 'devoted', 'school', 'church', 'seeing', 'solemn', 'duty', 'teach', 'guide', 'children', 'protect', 'multifaceted', 'performance', 'resonant', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'scary', 'nun', 'principal', 'childhood.Hoffman', 'Flynn', 'beat', 'right', 'charisma', 'priest', 'trying', 'modernize', 'church', 'being', 'more', 'friend', 'children', 'mentor', 'disciplinarian', 'gregarious', 'approachable', 'charming', 'when', 'Streep', 'sights', 'one', 'danger', 'vindictiveness', 'manipulation', 'facade', 'world', 'see', 'darkness', 'believe', 'was', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'suspected', 'doing.Shanley', 'also', 'entire', 'abuse', 'dynamic', 'exactly', 'right', 'many', 'priestly', 'perpetrators', 'Flynn', 'student', 'who', 'friend', 'most', 'outsider', 'odd', 'duck', 'school', 'sole', 'African', 'American', 'boy', 'amongst', 'sea', 'pasty', 'white', 'Shanley', 'Flynn', 'grooming', 'boy', 'drawing', 'Shanley', 'plants', 'seeds', 'Flynn', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'sexually', 'molesting', 'boy', 'other', 'aspect', 'completely', 'spot', 'how', 'perpetrators', 'justify', 'closeness', 'kids', 'trying', 'modernize', 'church', 'trying', 'humanize', 'become', 'more', 'friend', 'anything', 'else', 'result', 'performance', 'Hoffman', 'charming', 'way', 'intensely', 'creepy', 'dirty.Viola', 'Davis', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'willing', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'respect', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'happening', 'little', 'boy', 'Believe', 'not', 'back', '1964', 'respects', 'still', 'today', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'common', 'reaction', 'Close', 'eyes', 'never', 'happened', 'Brilliant', 'performance', 'completely', 'realistic.The', 'sole', 'clink', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'film', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Sister', 'James', 'newest', 'nun', 'naivete', 'first', 'suspect', 'Flynn', 'then', 'turn', 'away', 'foul', 'thoughts', 'when', 'flimsiest', 'excuses', 'role', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'purpose', 'film', 'portrayed', 'Adam', 'performance', 'whiny', 'one', 'note', 'found', 'annoying', 'start', 'longed', 'scenes', 'be', 'quickly.As', 'Flynn', 'did', 'molest', 'boy', 'not', 'well', ""'d"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'One', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'think', 'yes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'think', 'nature', 'Doubt', 'question', 'placed', 'survivor', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'hands', 'priest', 'prove', 'it.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The boy's history teacher, Sister James (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius that the boy came back from a private meeting with Father Flynn acting peculiarly. Does Sister Aloysius suspect Father Flynn because he has done something wrong or is she biased against him because she disagrees with his progressive methodologies?The story is an important one, but it is used as a vehicle to debate a broader topic. The movie specifically addresses an allegation of misconduct by a priest, but the characters generally disagree on the role the Church plays in people's lives. Should the Church continue as strict disciplinarian? or adapt to the changing times to become part of the family?John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt for the stage, and then adapted his own story into this movie, which he also directed. The story is brilliantly controversial. While you are left to form your own opinion of guilt or innocence, the arguments on both sides are incredibly persuasive.I have not seen a movie with acting this good in a long time. (Stay with me because I will actually praise Philip Seymour Hoffman, something I normally do as infrequently as possible.) With three strong performances from the movie's three main players (Streep, Hoffman and Adams) one somehow managed to outshine the others. Both Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman were great. Meryl Streep brought the house down; she was fantastic.Another performance worth noting was Viola Davis, who plays the boy's mother. She has maybe 5 minutes of screen time, but they are 5 of the most powerful minutes in an already powerful movie. It is probably a name you will hear again.I will not delve into any conclusions I may have drawn from the movie, particularly because I opted against drawing any. The movie may leave you with a burning curiosity to know if he did it, but I invite you to see this movie with friends so you may discuss your thoughts.

And what a combination it has proved to be in this gem of a movie. Doubt is the very foundation of the film, one which is attacked in sermons delivered by Hoffman's character. But Streep's character thrives on it. Herein lies the paradox that runs throughout the film. As viewers, we also find it very hard to guess who is right and who is wrong. The film masterfully creates that doubt in our minds and to the last second, that feeling lingers on.  The film skillfully portrays what doubts can do to people. The tension is almost palpable in some of the scenes of verbal confrontations between the two lead characters.You buy this blu ray essentially for the film, not as a demo material. The sound too is dialogue driven, so do not expect much from the surround channels. That said, the blu-ray is a solid presentation. The photography is excellent, though it is mostly an `indoor' movie. But one outdoor scene is outstanding - the conversation between the mother of one of the altar boys and Streep's character.

In this case accusations of sexual misconduct against a priest (Hoffman) by a suspicious nun(Streep) is only presumed and never proven. In a sense the film makes a case for the possible innocence of priests accused of such terrible things in the catholic church who may indeed be innocent of such charges based on fanatical presumptions of their accusers rather than evidence. In reality though, the history of priests accused of such discusting things in the catholic church is not without hard evidence. The charges often reveiled are perpetrated by the victims, so the evidence leaves little room for ""Doubt"" in the real world. The film however in a sense is a lesson for all of us.

This was an excellent screen adaptation of the award-winning play by director, John Patrick Shanley  which ultimately resulted in a uniquely liberating, somewhat painful, yet truly thought-provoking viewing experience.  Kudos goes to the principal players, Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Joseph Foster, all of whom gave wrenching award-worthy performances.The story is set in the mid-sixties, not long after the assassination of JFK.  A Catholic school in the Bronx accepts its first black student, Donald Miller, beautifully portrayed by Joseph Foster. The priest, wonderfully realized by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is truly empathetic and realizing what a struggle it must be for the student, keeps an eye on him to make sure he adjusts well to this new and very intricate situation.  Because of his attention, one sister, a very effective Amy Adams, initially becomes slightly suspicious of his motives and, unfortunately, reports her suspicions to the principal, an exceedingly pedagogical nun, exquisitely played by Meryl Streep. She, of course, confronts the priest with her suspicions which he vehemently denies and she steadfastly refuses to believe.  She even confronts the boy's mother, portrayed by Viola Davis who gives a wrenching performance.  The encounter between these two is as taut and revealing as those between the accusing nun and the outraged priest.  The overall dialogue is crisp, biting, poignant and positively riveting.Certain aspects of this whole scenario evoked poignant memories making it rather easy for me to relate to.  Moreover, certain revelations the mother made to the nun re the boy's home life raised VERY serious questions.  These questions will be at the focal point of any discussions about the play for the simple reason the author wisely neither confirmed nor denied those suspicions which, obviously, was pivotal to the whole theme.  Any ""doubts"" you find yourself faced with while watching this further fuels the profound impact the film makes because in the final analysis, it will be up to the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions - as well it should be.  The ending is little short of devastating.With such a riveting and important play being realized by a positively flawless cast, this could hardly miss.  Just eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeescellent.

1226791,A2FV4Y4I7BBL6I,B001PA0FF4,R. Crane,"[1, 1]","The setting for this movie is circa 1964 at Writer/Director Shanley's school, run by the Sisters of Charity in Bronx, New York. An Order founded by famed Mother Seton, the Sisters wore widow's garb, as this was how she was dressed by friends in Italy following her husband's death, and the Sisters were too poor to afford anything else.  Thus the costume became a Habit (from the DVD interview with the Sisters).  The clothing itself is intimidating--dark and reminiscent of crows.  The camera alights on a crow during the movie and the similarities become even more obvious.  In fact, Director Shanley uses the forces of nature to underscore the evil discussed: electric light bulbs explode unexpectedly, howling winds smash branches from trees, leaves pour out of the trees and the winds practically carry Meryl Streep away.But it is the cast and the performances of all four key characters (Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis) that is truly outstanding  and which bring this disturbing drama to life.  ""Doubt"" is about a Priest whose possible improper relationship with a particular boy is a cause of concern.  What we see, what we think we believe and what we want to believe are all in question.  Streep has spent a lifetime in roles for which she has been lauded as the greatest living actress.  In my opinion this is one of her finest performances.  She makes you hate her for her determination to get rid of this Priest when there is no certainty about what has happened.  On the other hand she makes you admire her for her determination to do what she believes is right. In a changing world she refuses to change, and holds back progressive thinking.  But, is she entirely wrong?This is a thought-provoking, haunting movie (and award-winning stage play).  It will linger long after the movie is over, and the surprise ending is perfect. How refreshing it is to find something so well written, acted and directed.

Meryl Streep plays a nun in the middle private school that is stern where even a local priest calls her a ""dragon"".  She is a school principal dedicated to discipline, tradition and propriety.  School priest in the other hand is likable, he is popular with students and seemingly easy going.  However, the mutual dislike between him and the principal leads them both to a different level of intellectual battlefield.Nun is concerned about priest's close relationship with one of the school students that also happens ot be black.  Her suspicions are confirmed in one of the most stunning moments in the film when nun meets boys mother (shinning star actress Viola Davis).  The revelation between the two women about the boy's present state and his future is the soul of the movie.  Both nun and mother wish the best for the school and the young man, but what shall be the price of securing his destiny and the well being of the students of the school?""Doubt"" is about crisis of faith, of individual's choosing to do the right things and any decent person's making moral transgressions for the greater good.

""Doubt"" is one of the worst movies I've seen in years, and I have no doubt about that.  I won't even bother with the hopelessly stagey quality of the film.  Instead I'll confine myself to its intellectual pretensions.  The film sets itself up as a ""drama of ideas,"" with Streep and Hoffman representing mighty opposites.  Streep's character is supposed to represent the ""old church"" based on discipline and tradition, whereas Hoffman's represents the new wave of compassion and friendliness (virtue vs. love, as the movie idiotically frames it).But Streep's character is so monstrous she can't represent anything except maybe psychpathology. She is obsessed by a hatred of ballpoint pens (personally, I agree on that one), sugar and Frosty the Snowman (which occasions the immortal line quoted above).  Streep is quite good (though toward the end even she begins to chew the scenery), but the role really should have been played by Cloris Leachman (a la her part in ""High Anxiety"").  Hoffman essentially plays Pat O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (or perhaps Bing Crosby in ""Going My Way"").  Hoffman's a great actor, but he's totally wasted in this one-dimensionsal role.  In fact he seems a little bored by it. The film introduces a phony ambiguity about what really went on between the priest and the boy, presumably to introduce doubt on the part of the viewer.  But the alleged ambiguity derives from absolutely nothing in the rest of the film, and Hoffman's character is so decent and Streep's so crazy, that the ""ambiguity"" is just a pretense of complexity in a movie notable only for its simple-mindedness.  I won't ""spoil"" the movie's ridiculous ending, but it too comes out of nowhere.  It might have made a good final line as the curtain comes down in a theater, but it couldn't be sillier in this context.

1226798,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001PA0FF4,RMurray847,"[3, 7]","DOUBT was a stage play by John Patrick Shanley...a much-revered play.  Great, theatrical dialogue and the opportunity for good actors to really tear into some juicy characters and excellent dialogue.But you know, not every stage play translates naturally into a compelling film.  You can't act a film at the same pitch you do on stage.  And strangely, dialogue that sounds intelligent, lofty, philosophical and NATURAL on stage can often on film sound intelligent, lofty, philosophical and UNNATURAL on screen.  Much like stage musicals can be tricky to put on screen, so too can ""straight"" plays.Unfortunately, John Patrick Shanley has been allowed to adapt his beloved play for the screen and then allowed to direct it as well.  What he has is an interesting but emotionally uninvolving film that makes me wish I could take stars Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman and see them do this story on stage.  Hoffman sweets and smiles and squirms and emotes with great energy...all to minimal effect.  His performance lacks subtle touches.  Streep falls into the same traps, although her character comes across on screen as even more one-dimensional (although, speaking of one-dimensional, poor Amy Adams, whom I normally think is great, is completely unconvincing.)DOUBT is set in the `60s in an inner-city Catholic School.  Hoffman is the popular parish priest and the religious center for the kids at the school, particularly the boys whom he coaches in basketball and even engages in discussions about girls.  To the story's credit, none of these activities feel mawkish, and without knowing where the film was  headed, you certainly would not suspect Hoffman of having less than pure intentions with these boys.  He GENUINELY seems to care about them and connect to them.  He develops a tight friendship with the one black boy in the school, a shy kid who needs the father's help to pass through the quiet gauntlet of racism he faces.On the other hand, the principal of the school is a severe, old-fashioned nun played by Streep.  She clearly resents Hoffman for his popularity AND populism.  Her character is almost unbelievably single-minded and sure of herself.  And when just the tiniest hint that Hoffman may not be altogether pure comes her way, she seizes on it.So the question is:  did Hoffman commit unforgiveable acts or is Streep simply obsessed with bringing down this pries with modern views she does not approve of?  Adams is the sister who first feels uncomfortable with Hoffman but later regrets the storm she caused.  As the movie wears on, our allegiances change, and this keeps the story compelling.  It plays out like perhaps the best episode of LAW & ORDER ever, where you're never sure what the truth is.But it is an intellectual exercise.  The acting is so very ""stagey"" and theatrical that I was constantly aware that these two film greats were ACTING.  Oh, look at Streep roll her eyes in disapproval.  Oh, look at Hoffman let his jaw hang slack in disbelief.And while director/writer Shanley has on the surface opened up his film by placing scenes all around the school and even outside, it seldom feels like much more than a play with some really realistic sets.  Scenes are long and generally take place in one room or one small outside location.  It feels, in case I haven't already made this clear, like a play.  I like plays, but when sitting in a movie theater, I like movies that don't feel like plays.One note about the much-praised performance of Viola Davis.  She plays the mother of the black student, and has one long scene with Streep.  She actually underplays her role nicely, and that, coupled with the fact that her character's point-of-view is controversial and a bit wrenching makes her role stand out.  Her performance is not Oscar worthy...there's no real arch to her character.  But because she outshines Streep, I think folks are jumping on the Davis bandwagon.

Well, that may be true, but I am convinced that there is only one reasonable way to view the events. So I do not think that Mr. Shanley's script leave as much room for Doubt as he perhaps wants.

1226801,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B001PA0FF4,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","This is a very interesting story about the conflict between a tradition-bound disciplinarian, Streep, and a progressive priest played brilliantly by Hoffman.  Though it takes place in 1964, the 60s upheavals are really only beginning.  Streep wants to keep things simple and controlled, Hoffman to open the church to new ideas.  While Streep is more overtly political in the way she enlists a young nun, the wonderful Amy Adams, Hoffman is also proven extremely adept at these kinds of career maneuvering.The pawn in the story is a solitary young black boy, the first admitted to the Bronx catholic school.  He is deeply troubled from an abusive household, yet full of potential; his mother is on his side and hoping to advance his education with the desperation of a person who know she has only one shot.  As we all know from recent allegations, the church did not deal well with the proclivities of some of its employees.  As Hoffman has lavished attention on the black boy, he becomes suspect in this regard.  The young nun is caught in between.Now, on the surface, it is easy to label the characters.  Streep is vicious, resentful, and seeking power as she looks back; Hoffman is a good man, a victim, a visionary who looks forward.  But of course, things may not be that simple.  Streep may be onto something.  Hoffman may not be all that he appears.  To the great credit of the playwrite, this is never definitively resolved, but left to the viewer to reason it out.  The result is an utterly rivetting drama that can be interpreted in many different ways.  I think that there is truth to everyone's point of view in the film.Recommended.  The film is a window into a world, a time, and a terrible human dilemma.

1226802,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001PA0FF4,Roland E. Zwick,"[22, 26]","***1/2Strong performances are the saving grace of ""Doubt,"" an otherwise uneven, overly glib tale of possible sexual abuse in one New York City parish circa 1964.Sister Aloysius is a tradition-bound nun who goes through life utterly untroubled by uncertainty or doubt, running her convent and grade school with unyielding self-righteousness and the iron fist of unchallenged authority. Sister Aloysius doesn't take any more kindly to the accoutrements of the modern world - she has banned all ballpoint pens from the premises and decries ""Frosty the Snowman"" as a celebration of pagan magic - than she does to the ""liberalizing"" effect Vatican II has had on the Church she views as the last bastion of morality in an increasingly permissive and immoral world.  This puts her in direct conflict with Father Flynn, a reform-minded, man-of-the-people priest who is more concerned with his parishioners' needs than with church ritual per se - yet whom Sister Aloysius has reason to suspect might be a pedophile.  Or is she simply targeting the man and seeing what she wants to see because his view of the Church is so at odds with her own?  The third main character, Sister James, is a perpetually upbeat but generally nave novice who becomes more than a disinterested bystander in the war-of-wills that erupts between her two equally hardnosed superiors.In adapting his play to the screen, writer/director John Patrick Shanley hits on some intriguing themes revolving around certainty vs. doubt and traditionalism vs. progressivism, but the movie isn't always as intellectually honest and convincing as one might wish it to be, especially when Shanley indulges in such hokey effects as the winter wind batting against the windows or well-orchestrated thunder bolts crashing overhead at  ""meaningful"" and dramatic moments in the picture.  Similarly, the reactions the characters have to one another and the situation they're involved in don't always ring true given the less enlightened time period in which the story takes place.  And the final ""transformative"" moment comes upon us with such abruptness and with so little preparation that it quite literally rings down the curtain on the entire enterprise.Yet, despite all these flaws, ""Doubt"" periodically rises to the occasion and does justice to the complexity of its subject matter.  This is particularly the case in a searing scene between Sister Aloysius and the mother of one of the boys who may have fallen victim to Father Flynn's inappropriate conduct, a scene that catches us completely off-guard with its sheer unexpectedness and its paradigm-shifting effect on the story.Moreover, the performances are uniformly excellent, starting with Meryl Streep who brings a surprising amount of humor and even warmth to a character who is, for all intents and purposes, cut off from her emotions by her dogmatically rigid nature.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman effectively keeps us guessing as to the truth about his character, never tipping his hand one way or the other as to what is taking place in the depths of his soul.  Amy Adams makes a compelling stand-in for those of us in the audience who are trying to reserve judgment on these two characters before all the facts are revealed.  Special note must also be taken of Viola Davis, superb in her brief but unforgettable appearance as the mother who delivers an unsettling response to news that her son may have been the victim of a sexual predator.The movie seems to suggest that one can never have one hundred percent certitude about anything in this life and that actions must often be taken even when all the ""facts"" in a particular case can never be fully known.  Yet, what happens when such an action could result in the destruction of another person's livelihood and reputation?  It's an interesting theme that is only sporadically well addressed by ""Doubt,"" but the food-for-thought that the movie provides makes it worth checking out anyway.",3,interesting idea only sporadically well executed,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3950,"['***1/2Strong', 'performances', 'are', 'saving', 'grace', 'Doubt', 'otherwise', 'uneven', 'overly', 'glib', 'tale', 'possible', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'parish', 'circa', '1964.Sister', 'Aloysius', 'tradition-bound', 'nun', 'who', 'life', 'utterly', 'untroubled', 'uncertainty', 'doubt', 'running', 'convent', 'grade', 'school', 'unyielding', 'self-righteousness', 'iron', 'fist', 'unchallenged', 'authority', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'kindly', 'accoutrements', 'modern', 'world', 'banned', 'ballpoint', 'pens', 'premises', 'decries', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'celebration', 'pagan', 'magic', 'liberalizing', 'effect', 'Vatican', 'II', 'had', 'Church', 'last', 'bastion', 'morality', 'increasingly', 'permissive', 'immoral', 'world', 'direct', 'conflict', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'reform-minded', 'man-of-the-people', 'priest', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'parishioners', 'needs', 'church', 'ritual', 'se', 'yet', 'whom', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'reason', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'pedophile', 'simply', 'targeting', 'man', 'seeing', 'what', 'see', 'view', 'Church', 'so', 'odds', 'own', 'third', 'main', 'character', 'Sister', 'James', 'perpetually', 'upbeat', 'generally', 'nave', 'novice', 'who', 'more', 'disinterested', 'bystander', 'war-of-wills', 'erupts', 'two', 'equally', 'hardnosed', 'superiors.In', 'adapting', 'play', 'screen', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'hits', 'intriguing', 'themes', 'revolving', 'certainty', 'vs.', 'doubt', 'traditionalism', 'vs.', 'progressivism', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'intellectually', 'honest', 'convincing', 'one', 'might', 'wish', 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'Shanley', 'such', 'hokey', 'effects', 'winter', 'wind', 'batting', 'windows', 'well-orchestrated', 'thunder', 'bolts', 'crashing', 'overhead', 'meaningful', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'picture', 'Similarly', 'reactions', 'characters', 'have', 'one', 'situation', ""'re"", 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'ring', 'true', 'given', 'less', 'enlightened', 'time', 'period', 'story', 'place', 'final', 'transformative', 'moment', 'such', 'abruptness', 'so', 'little', 'preparation', 'quite', 'literally', 'down', 'curtain', 'entire', 'enterprise.Yet', 'flaws', 'Doubt', 'periodically', 'occasion', 'justice', 'complexity', 'subject', 'matter', 'particularly', 'case', 'searing', 'scene', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'mother', 'one', 'boys', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'fallen', 'victim', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'inappropriate', 'conduct', 'scene', 'completely', 'off-guard', 'sheer', 'unexpectedness', 'paradigm-shifting', 'effect', 'story.Moreover', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'starting', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'surprising', 'amount', 'humor', 'even', 'warmth', 'character', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'cut', 'off', 'emotions', 'dogmatically', 'rigid', 'nature', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'effectively', 'guessing', 'truth', 'character', 'never', 'tipping', 'hand', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'depths', 'soul', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'compelling', 'stand-in', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'reserve', 'judgment', 'two', 'characters', 'facts', 'are', 'revealed', 'Special', 'note', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'taken', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'superb', 'brief', 'unforgettable', 'appearance', 'mother', 'who', 'unsettling', 'response', 'news', 'son', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'sexual', 'predator.The', 'movie', 'suggest', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'certitude', 'anything', 'life', 'actions', 'must', 'often', 'be', 'taken', 'even', 'when', 'facts', 'particular', 'case', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'known', 'what', 'when', 'such', 'action', 'could', 'result', 'destruction', 'person', 'livelihood', 'reputation', 'interesting', 'theme', 'only', 'sporadically', 'well', 'addressed', 'Doubt', 'food-for-thought', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'anyway']",N/A

I suppose people shouting impassioned arguments at each other while holding back tears is what he meant. The thing is, there's nothing new here. There's nothing new about a priest that (possibly) had improper relations with a young altar boy. There's nothing new about the clash of the old ways and new ways in the Church. The only new thing I saw was the great (and short) performance by Viola Davis as she was willing to let quite a lot pass for the sake of her son. Meryl Streep is yet again amazing at keeping in character so that we firmly believe she is a real person and not just a stage character. The movie ends too soon. There is punishingly little understanding from the POV of the young African American child who should be the center of this entire production. The most we get out of him is a few lines and a lot of scowling and sniffling. I wanted to know more about him. How does he feel to be in a an all white school. How does he feel about the Priest, really? How does he feel about his father who beats him. The lack of a climax to the story leaves the viewer a bit underwhelmed and cheated even.The Bronx set (I had no idea where it was.

On the one hand, it could be the doubt that the head sister had of the priest--whether he was indeed a good man or not.  She had no concrete evidence so that accounted for her doubts.  On the other hand, it could be the doubt of the non-believers of God or Jesus Christ.  When we intellectualize things and need concrete proof to remedy our doubts--like the head sister or the non-believers--then we'll never be true believers of anything.

Meryl Streep is immaculate, no pun intended, as the domineering, condescending but well-intentioned principal. Her performance is to the point, without any embellishments, always with almost melodious tones, and ironically bitingly terse line deliveries, like her unforgettable turn in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" but without the Pradas. Streep is a textbook representation of acting (less is more, though stylistic acting decorum is projected on her sometimes wringing, wriggling fingers, and the movements of her neck). ""Doubt"" works not solely within the confinements of the Catholic establishment, but can be applied to any structural regime or beliefs. We need to dare to question anything, just that sometimes we also need to be aware of the consequences such as losing humanity in the face of faith. Thus, is it worth to doubt? Thematically wise, that is up to the person. In any case, looking from a cinematic point of view, there is no arguing that one should not even have a single trace of doubt in seeing this film.",5,Great masterful drama that is even more solified by its agenda to question.,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1496,"['Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'may', 'be', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'physically', 'wise', 'still', 'ever-dependable', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'something', 'audiences', 'refers', 'apt', 'title', 'doubt', 'are', 'definite', 'answers', 'film', 'screenplay', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'face', 'off', 'sans', 'boxing', 'gloves', 'punctuated', 'sharply', 'defined', 'words', 'while', 'maintaining', 'concept', 'doubting', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'immaculate', 'pun', 'intended', 'domineering', 'condescending', 'well-intentioned', 'principal', 'performance', 'point', 'embellishments', 'always', 'almost', 'melodious', 'tones', 'ironically', 'bitingly', 'terse', 'line', 'deliveries', 'unforgettable', 'turn', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Pradas', 'Streep', 'textbook', 'representation', 'acting', 'less', 'more', 'stylistic', 'acting', 'decorum', 'projected', 'sometimes', 'wringing', 'wriggling', 'fingers', 'movements', 'neck', 'Doubt', 'not', 'solely', 'confinements', 'Catholic', 'establishment', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'structural', 'regime', 'beliefs', 'need', 'dare', 'question', 'anything', 'just', 'sometimes', 'also', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'consequences', 'such', 'losing', 'humanity', 'face', 'faith', 'Thus', 'worth', 'doubt', 'Thematically', 'wise', 'up', 'person', 'case', 'looking', 'cinematic', 'point', 'view', 'arguing', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'single', 'trace', 'doubt', 'seeing', 'film']",N/A

They both lift this film from being standard fare to being something great and with gravitas. Hoffman is a progressive priest and Streep is a puritanical nun who is desperate to see any bad in him so that she can hound him out of the church school and maintain her austere status quo. She then starts to have suspicions of inappropriate behaviour with the children, which in reality may just be an informal personality and a man in touch with his gentler side, and yet she is so certain of her suspicions that you are left doubting his behaviour by the end as well. The direction and acting is excellent and although the story could have been resolved more fully, it gave you enough to become fully involved in the plot. In fact, it may have deliberately left the ending slightly ambiguous so that you feel the doubt that other characters also feel and if that was the intention it was a masterly cinematic trick.

1226817,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B001PA0FF4,S. Schell,"[1, 1]","""What do you do when you're not sure?"" asks Father Flynn of his congregation at the inception of ""Doubt"", a film that centers on the doubt of the truth, doubt of faith, doubt of the nature of man and doubt of self while delving into the controversial dilemma of child molestation within the Catholic church and the church's efforts to cover it up.  Winner of four Tony awards including Best Play in 2005, author John Patrick Shanley's superb story is one of the more smooth and succinct Broadway-to-Hollywood transitions to come along in a great while.It is a blustery winter in 1964 at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church.  Sister Aloysius (Streep), the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic primary school, presides over her students with fear and intimidation.  Though stern and seemingly mirthless on the surface, Aloysius is empowered by the grace of God and believes in the saving of her student's minds and souls through discipline and contrition.  Father Flynn (Hoffman), the new parish priest, views things differently, his friendly and newfangled approach bristling the staunchly traditional Sister Aloysius to a curious degree.  She views him from the beginning with a critical gaze, his aim to change things rustling her old feathers considerably, but it isn't until he takes a special interest in Donald Miller (the school's one and only black student) that the seeds of doubt are planted in her mind.  Sister James (Adams), a novice in her profession as well as in the ways of the world, thinks Flynn charming and believes his interest in Donald is with good intention.  But time and experience have Sister Aloysius believing otherwise and she begins digging deeper for the truth, those seeds of doubt now taking root in her heart.  All  the while Flynn rebukes her interrogations but oddly enough does everything except proclaim his innocence.  The peripatetic winds that Sister Aloysius complains of begin to mount in their intensity the further she prods into the situation, and when she and Flynn finally confront one another, a literal and figural storm has brewed, their fury towards one another brilliantly underscored by the blinding flash of lightning and the menacing roll of thunder from the heavens above them.""Doubt"", much like its title, creeps into the subconscious, festering, and it is a masterpiece in all its subtleties, particularly its use of visual metaphor.  Whereas other films practically beat you over the head with suspense, ""Doubt"" whispers it in your ear, its calm, hushed tone provoking a more attentive eye and ear to its proceedings.  With John Patrick Shanley serving as writer and director for the adaptation of his successful stage play, ""Doubt"" remains nearly 100% intact and fully realized according to Shanley's vision.  Foregoing visual effects and tricky camera angles, the play's impact and presence on a stage comes through on screen, the simplistic beauty of its cinematography and the focus on its small but superior cast making it an exquisite film that centers solely on its deeply dramatic story.Each of the four roles is a labyrinthine ship commanded only by the best captain, and each actor navigates and mans their vessel with power and precision.  It comes as no surprise that all four actors were nominated for Oscars (though none of them won) as well as a nomination for Shanley for his screenplay (which lost out to ""Slumdog Millionaire"", a HUGE upset in my humble opinion).  Adams nails the wide-eyed innocence of Sister James and offers a quiet intensity while Streep glowers, smirks and steadfastly barrels through as Sister Aloysius.  Hoffman imbues Flynn with an intriguing mixture of mischief and tenderness while at the same time suggesting with a glint of his eye a covertness that Sister Aloysius immediately detects.  Though Davis is only present for two scenes in the film's 104-minute runtime (one in which she doesn't even have any lines), her small role as Mrs. Miller is sublime, made memorable in her capable hands; she even manages to make one forget that a powerhouse like Streep is standing right there with her.This single disc DVD edition comes with some interesting extras, the most intriguing being a featurette entitled ""Doubt: From Stage to Screen"" in which Shanley shares his own thoughts and feelings about the play, its transition from stage to screen, commentary from its actors and an impromptu interview he conducted with Streep.  Shanley chose to shoot the film in the neighborhood he himself grew up in, centering his outdoor shots on the very intersection where he attended Catholic school in the Bronx.  He also managed to come into contact with Sister Margaret James (the very woman on whom the character Sister James is based) from the school he attended and she served as a technical advisor on the film, helping Streep and Adams with the application of their habits and rosaries.  ""The Cast of Doubt"" is a casual sit down with the four main actors, ""Scoring Doubt"" reviews composer Howard Shore's inspiration for the film's music and ""The Sisters of Charity"" offers an enlightening background on the origin of the Sisters of Charity of New York and the humbling, often thankless work of the nuns.Bottom line: Truly one of the best films of 2008, ""Doubt"" will leave a lasting impression on viewers who crave a good, absorbing drama that offers them the opportunity to form many different interpretations from its complex story.",5,Gossip Is Feathers On The

1226818,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B001PA0FF4,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 1]","Doubt is the most powerful, well-acted drama of 2008. The story is set in 1964, at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The plot centers around the school's priest, Father Flynn. He is suspected of instigating an improper relationship, with one of the students at the school.Meryl Streep plays the stern nun and school Principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier. Sister Aloysius is often at odds with her subordinate, Sister James. Sister James is a much younger nun, then Sister Aloysius. And Sister James doesn't agree with the harsh methods, that Sister Aloysius insists on using to deal with the students.A black student named Donald Miller is admitted to the school, and he's the only black attending. Mass integration hasn't yet been implemented at the school. So, Donald is often singled-out by the white kids, as a target for their racism. Donald seeks advice from Father Flynn, about his interest in becoming a priest. Father Flynn also gives Donald morale support, when Donald is harassed by some white students.One day, Sister James witnesses Father Flynn summoning Donald into a private meeting, in the Rectory. She also sees Father Flynn place Donald's T-shirt, into a locker. When Donald returns to his desk after his meeting with Father Flynn, Donald seems upset to Sister James. She also notices the odor of alcohol, on Donald's breath. Suspecting that Father Flynn had lured Donald into a carnal tryst inside the Rectory, Sister James goes immediately to Sister Aloysius with her concerns.Meanwhile, Father Flynn wants the school to become more progressive, and reach-out more to their congregation. His philosophy is in direct opposition, to the old-fashioned mentality of Sister Aloysius. She thinks that order and propriety, are more important than the more congenial values, espoused by Father Flynn.After Sister James confronts Sister Aloysius with her terrible suspicions regarding Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius is 'certain' that Father Flynn is guilty. And she's determined to prove that the seemingly benign, compassionate Father Flynn, is truly a proverbial wolf-in-sheep's-clothing.Meryl Streep should win an Oscar, for her stellar performance as Sister Aloysius. As a woman on the cusp of being a senior citizen, Meryl fit nicely into the role of the dignified, elder nun. Phillip Seymore Hoffman, was also a good choice to play Father Flynn. Hoffman portrays Father Flynn with just enough of a smarmy aura, to make the view believe that he could really be a devil-in-disguise.Doubt is a deep, and moving drama. It's an intelligent film, that makes the viewer question their own assumptions about human nature.

As soon as the credits roll, scenes from the film tumble around in your mind, causing you to seriously evaluate what you have just seen. You come up with your own interpretation of the events.Directed by John Patrick Shanley from his own play, DOUBT tells the story of an uptight, extremely conservative nun who suspects foul play in the church, when the new priest is suspected of molesting a black student. The nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, has good reason to accuse the progressive, somewhat libral priest of the crime. Or does she? That's one of the many questions that the film asks the characters on screen, as well as the audience. Are things REALLY what they seem to be? Or is Sister Aloysius simply out to pick a fight? She doesn't like change. Father Brendan Flynn is all for it, and he constantly tries to break through Aloysius' tough exterior. Times have changed, he says, and so must she. It is no suprise that she takes aim at him the first chance that she gets - but, once again, does she have good reason? Did the priest really molest the boy or not? Is there any reason to doubt that he did? The film presents the argument from both sides, and in my opinion, is very ambiguous in it's conclusion.This film is carried by the dialogue and acting, which is amazing. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Amy Adams give some of the best performances of the year. Amy Adams shines as a young and naive nun who gives Streep reason to question Hoffman.SEE IT!

The trailer looks boring and depressing and the subject matter isn't something that I would expect to hold my attention.I was wrong.The screenplay provides the foundation for a great film, and I don't use that word lightly, but what really elevates Doubt is the superb performances from the cast. Meryl Streep is utterly convincing as Sister Aloysius Beauvier. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. The students must have been terrified of her. My school had someone just like that. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a very convincing priest. When the two finally clash in a war of words, it's one of the most breathtaking confrontations I have ever seen. Amy Adams has never been better and I wish she would choose to do more serious roles. Viola Davis made a brief appearance, but I will never forget it.I'm tempted to say that Streep was robbed of another Oscar, but Kate Winslet was brilliant in The Reader. Hoffman was never going to eclipse Heath Ledger, but his performance shouldn't be forgotten.Doubt is all about the dialogue. It's also subtle. We are never told the complete truth and it's left up to us to decide whether Father Flynn (Hoffman) is guilty or innocent. This is writing at its best. The other thing that is perfectly depicted is the setting. I felt as if I had been transported back to the 1960s.This is the kind of film that makes you want to find out more about the actors.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 0]","Having seen the play on tour with the original Broadway lead actor, Cherry Jones, I was anxiously awaiting this release. In a somewhat different way, Meryl Streep is exceptional in the film's lead role. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is equally brilliant in his role. But the film lacks some of the tension of the stage production, whose cast consisted of just four actors. Playwright John Patrick Shanley ""opened"" of the story with his film adaptation. He added many more characters - quite a few are superfluous - and brought it outside the Catholic School. More importantly, he added extra events that seem contrived. When Sister Beauvier (Streep) does something wrong there is a clap of thunder - or the lights go out. When Shanley wants to build suspense he brings in a strong wind. He wants the viewer to know that God is ""not pleased"" or ""Something terrible is about to happen"". These moments are so obvious that you are distracted by the IDEAS that Shanley has  put into the words that his characters speak.But let me not dissuade you from seeing this DVD. The acting is SUPERB from all the main characters. The films FIVE Oscar nominations certainly support this. Shanley was nominated - but for the screenplay (well deserved); not as a Director.The bonus features are interesting but often spend a lot of time showing scenes from the film, which you have already seen. This is becoming common practice and a 10 minute ""featurette"" will often only have six minutes of new material. I have not taken the time to listen to Shanley's complete commentary track.Highly recommended, specifically for the acting, but also for the script if you have not previously seen the stage version.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"SUPERB Acting, but Shanley better writer than director",1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1715,"['Having', 'seen', 'play', 'tour', 'original', 'Broadway', 'lead', 'actor', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'was', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'release', 'somewhat', 'different', 'way', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'exceptional', 'film', 'lead', 'role', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'role', 'film', 'tension', 'stage', 'production', 'cast', 'consisted', 'just', 'four', 'actors', 'Playwright', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'opened', 'story', 'film', 'adaptation', 'added', 'many', 'more', 'characters', 'quite', 'few', 'are', 'superfluous', 'brought', 'Catholic', 'School', 'More', 'importantly', 'added', 'extra', 'events', 'seem', 'contrived', 'When', 'Sister', 'Beauvier', 'Streep', 'something', 'wrong', 'clap', 'thunder', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'When', 'Shanley', 'build', 'suspense', 'strong', 'wind', 'viewer', 'know', 'God', 'not', 'pleased', 'Something', 'terrible', 'happen', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'are', 'distracted', 'IDEAS', 'Shanley', 'put', 'words', 'characters', 'speak.But', 'let', 'not', 'dissuade', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'acting', 'SUPERB', 'main', 'characters', 'films', 'FIVE', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'certainly', 'support', 'Shanley', 'was', 'nominated', 'screenplay', 'well', 'deserved', 'not', 'Director.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'often', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'showing', 'scenes', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'becoming', 'common', 'practice', '10', 'minute', 'featurette', 'will', 'often', 'only', 'have', 'six', 'minutes', 'new', 'material', 'have', 'not', 'taken', 'time', 'listen', 'Shanley', 'complete', 'commentary', 'track.Highly', 'recommended', 'specifically', 'acting', 'also', 'script', 'have', 'not', 'previously', 'seen', 'stage', 'version.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

But she isn't alone. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis each give outstanding performances helping this film stand out from the rest of the pack.Set in the mid 60s, at a Catholic Parish back East, Father Flynn (Hoffman) is the charismatic young priest leading the whole parish. But Sister Aloysius, the elementary school principal and leader of the nuns who work on the grounds, has her suspicions about Father Flynn. She dislikes his modern ways, and seems particularly shocked when he suggests they include a secular song in the Christmas pageant. Sister Aloysius would rather rule over the children with fear, instilling the fear of God into them. Father Flynn would rather be kind. Aloysius turns to her flock of sisters and asks them to keep an eye open for anything suspicious. Sister James (Amy Adams) seems to take this to heart and considers it odd that Flynn calls one of her students, Donald Miller, the lone black student in the school, to his office for a private conversation. Later, she spots him putting something in Donald's locker. Aloysius immediately suspects Flynn of wrongdoing and confronts him. But she can do little else and he won't admit to anything. But she begins a campaign and will not stop until Flynn admits his wrongdoing and leaves. She turns to Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother, for support.Written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, I get the feeling this play was either based on something he personally experienced, whether he had first hand knowledge, or later learned of such a thing happening in a school just like the one he attended. He has provided a unique and seemingly extensive attention to detail, giving us a real feel for what life was like in this community, at this time in history. From an overhead shot of the community, watching various parishioners' head to Sunday service, to moments with Sister Aloysius and her nuns, Shanley makes us feel as though we are living through this with the characters.He isn't content to depict just a small slice of life in this absorbing drama; he provides historical benchmarks, helping us place the story in a larger framework. There are some references to Kennedy's assassination; the children are clearly enamored of certain pop culture icons, indicative of the times. It is very clear these people populate the mid 60s.But the most important benchmark helps establish the history and also provides the backbone for most of the story is that Donald Miller is the first and only black student in the school. He has a difficult time acclimating and many of the other children pick on him, getting into fights with him. But his mother is intent on him finishing his education there because she knows he will get accepted to a better high school and then a better college, greatly improving his life. Hi mother's devotion to him and her absolute conviction that he finishes his education at the Catholic school provides one of the most dramatic moments I have seen in recent film. It is also the one scene in which Viola Davis appears, for any length of time, with any dialogue, and she more than holds her own against Meryl Streep's powerful portrayal of Sister Aloysius. This is the scene that got Davis an Oscar nomination and will make her stand out among the rest of the pack.As Streep's Sister Aloysius gets more and more frustrated with Father Flynn, we begin to get a fuller picture of her history. She isn't JUST frustrated with Father Flynn, and his encouragement to modernize the church, or his approval of including a secular song in the Christmas pageant, or his insistence that maybe they could all be nicer to the parishioners and the children. Although, all of these things probably serve to make Sister Aloysius' head explode on a nightly basis, she is frustrated most outwardly in what she deems inappropriate behavior by Father Flynn towards Donald.When Sister James spots the suspicious moments, she runs back to her superior and reports, giving Sister Aloysius exactly what she needs and didn't want to use against Father Flynn. But they are mere accusations and she has no proof. So she must tread delicately at first.This leads us to recognize what frustrates her the most. What eats away at her, silently, making her seethe and become more and more bitter by the day? She is frustrated that she has no power in the church. The men have all of the real power. Sure, she can wield a ruler and smack the children. She can cast a look at many of the children and make them practically pee their pants. But she can't bring an accusation against Father Flynn without evidence.This fact leads to a powerful, extremely illuminating scene depicting the relationship between Father Flynn and the two nuns. And it shows so many levels of their relationship, giving us insight into some of the problems with the Catholic Church, problems that, to my limited knowledge, still exist today.Streep's Sister Aloysius believes so strongly in her convictions, she continues to harangue Father Flynn and continues to try to uncover some evidence she can use.Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as Father Flynn. As a man, he has the power in this church, and Flynn uses this knowledge to his own advantage. This aspect of the film was actually the most interesting for me; watching the three leads dance and shuffle around each other as they attempt to get to the bottom of information or situations, while always trying to ascertain who has the real power in any given moment.Hoffman has a difficult role in that he has to appear powerful, in charge, but this is clearly not the case in some moments. When Flynn even realizes this, Hoffman has to show us Flynn's realization while maintaining the character's convictions. Flynn knows he can't let his guard down around the two women, so he exerts his power in subtle methods. In a way, these displays of power are meant to remind both the sisters and Father Flynn of his own power.Sister James is eager to please and Adams brings a certain naivet&eacute; to the role, letting us believe she is fairly new to this work. She wants to make Sister Aloysius happy so she is very keen to help Sister get the information she wants and needs. Does this lead her to see things that don't really happen? This is part of the beauty of her character.Shanley has done a great job, but the film doesn't completely escape its stage origins. Too much of the film depicts conversations between two or three people, isolating them from other people and events, focusing on what they are saying. In real life, people interrupt, we hear noises outside, they walk through a courtyard, and the world is larger. In a play, everything is smaller because of the limit of space and the necessity for scenery. It is a challenge to 'open up' a play when adapting it to the screen, but the most memorable adaptations accomplish this.Don't get me wrong. I have the utmost respect for good playwrights, but film is a very different artistic medium and adapting plays to film is usually somewhat problematic.""Doubt"" is a very good film, but it never

1226828,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001PA0FF4,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 1]","The original play ""Doubt"" was a powerhouse built around four actors, suspicion and a new vs old church divide that made it intensely dramatic. However, that kind of staging would be near impossible to film, and the movie adds characters (like the young boy Donald who is the source of the conflict) and a church full of congregents. The movie is still a heavy, densely wordy affair, but the inclusiuon of more bodies and business dilutes the ambiguity, or the ""doubt"" as it were.However, when you have Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman turning in their most ferociously thesbian performances possible, ""Doubt"" still comes out as a really good movie. Both Amy Adams as the innocent (who utters the scene stealing line above) and Viola Davis (who torpedoes the self-rightous certainty of Sister Aloysius with the rules of the world) as the mother who will protect her son through any or all make deeply impressive supporting appearances, and all work with John Patrick Shanley's fine adaptation of his original play. Togther, these folks were all nominated for Oscars, that is how good each individual is here.Streep, as Sister Aloysius Beauvier, takes that crusty old nun that everyone remembers from Sunday School and infuses her with both wit, wisdom and Nunly Facism. Hoffman's Father Flynn is the new breed of Priest, a big Catholic teddy bear who thinks the church must become more human and humane, but Sister Aloysius sees that as both weak and suspect. When she sees Father Flynn acting with (what she sees as) undue compassion towards the new kid, she decides to drive him out of the church at all costs...even if so much of her certainty may be flawed by her mistrust of change.At a very taut 100 minutes, ""Doubt"" works both as an indictment of the scandals within the Catholic Church and as an allegory to the modern day, when ""Change"" became a buzzword in the making of a war and a new president. Viola Davis, with maybe 10 minutes of screentime, tears all of the arguments into shreads, making the theme of doubt in the movie play right into the ambiguous ending. Powerful stuff and worthy of all its awards and nominations.",4,"""I like Frosty the Snowman!""",1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2142,"['original', 'play', 'Doubt', 'was', 'powerhouse', 'built', 'four', 'actors', 'suspicion', 'new', 'vs', 'old', 'church', 'divide', 'made', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'However', 'kind', 'staging', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'film', 'movie', 'characters', 'young', 'boy', 'Donald', 'who', 'source', 'conflict', 'church', 'full', 'congregents', 'movie', 'still', 'heavy', 'densely', 'wordy', 'affair', 'inclusiuon', 'more', 'bodies', 'business', 'ambiguity', 'doubt', 'when', 'have', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'turning', 'most', 'ferociously', 'thesbian', 'performances', 'possible', 'Doubt', 'still', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'innocent', 'who', 'scene', 'stealing', 'line', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'self-rightous', 'certainty', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'rules', 'world', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'protect', 'son', 'make', 'deeply', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'appearances', 'work', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'original', 'play', 'folks', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'how', 'good', 'individual', 'here.Streep', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'Beauvier', 'crusty', 'old', 'nun', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'Sunday', 'School', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'Nunly', 'Facism', 'Hoffman', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'new', 'breed', 'Priest', 'big', 'Catholic', 'teddy', 'bear', 'who', 'church', 'must', 'become', 'more', 'human', 'humane', 'Sister', 'Aloysius', 'weak', 'suspect', 'When', 'Father', 'Flynn', 'acting', 'what', 'as', 'undue', 'compassion', 'new', 'kid', 'drive', 'church', 'costs', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'certainty', 'may', 'be', 'flawed', 'mistrust', 'change.At', 'very', 'taut', '100', 'minutes', 'Doubt', 'indictment', 'scandals', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'allegory', 'modern', 'day', 'when', 'Change', 'became', 'buzzword', 'making', 'war', 'new', 'president', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'arguments', 'shreads', 'making', 'theme', 'doubt', 'movie', 'play', 'right', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'Powerful', 'stuff', 'worthy', 'awards', 'nominations']",N/A
1226829,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001PA0FF4,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 8]","I must be careful not to give anything away in this review of ""Doubt,"" a masterwork beyond even what I expected.If you're expecting a whodunnit, you'll still wonder at the end...that's as much as I'll give away.Meryl Streep plays a nun, Mother Superior, with pre-Vatican II leanings; most of her associates at the school in the Bronx are ancient--a condition you'd find even in the 1964 in which the story takes place. There is one younger sister, though, Sister James, played wonderfully by Amy Adams, who, while not inclined to challenge authority, God forbid, does have a slightly rebellious streak in her.Sister Aloysius (Streep) is first seen waking up her students, and keeping them concentrating on the mass, as celebrated by Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). She yanks a transistor radio headphone out of the ear of one of her students, objects to the use of ballpoint pens, and has the most hilarious objection to ""Frosty the Snowman,"" which is defended by Father Flynn and Sister James who're both inclined to want to wake up to a growing world.Indeed, the appropriateness of the film's title is exposed early in the film when Sister Aloysius at dinner asks the sisters what they think of Father Flynn's sermon that day. She wonders: does it indicate any lack of certainty on Flynn's part? Heaven forbid, any DOUBT?In this school in the Bronx, there is one black student, Donald Miller. Father Flynn seems to have taken a special interest in the boy. Sister Aloysius seems to have planted a seed of, yes, doubt into her fellow sisters. Sister James reports to her that she has observed a few questionable acts between Father Flynn and Donald. I refuse to give away any more here, except that Sister James is less sure of her observations than is Sister Aloysius. Ahhhh, yes...The conflict develops then between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. I was impressed with Flynn's answers to Sister James when they sat on a bench on the church grouds. After Flynn's biting sermon on the subject of gossip, Sister asks Father, ""Was your sermon directed at anyone in particular?"" Father answers with a question, ""What do you think?""There were other answers too in the script that were thought provoking, rather than pugnacious. And that made the script attention grabbing.There were symbols in the film that at first put me off a little but, after discusssing the film with my wife, I found then appropriate. In Father Flynn's sermon, for example, he referred to a character stabbing a pillow and feathers flew all over--it was an important symbol in the ""parable"" of the sermon. There were sort of ""reference"" scenes for a second or two making the symbolism a bit more concrete. Those I thought wer distracting but, as my wife pointed out, in the film, there were leaves blowing, then there was snow blowing, much like the feathers. Ahhh....The conflict develops and Sister Aloysius meets with Donald's mother, Mrs. Miller. The wonderful Viola Davis played Mrs. Miller. My spouse had read of the four major players in this film and we agree that, while Davis's role was a short one, she was the fourth player. We learn a lot about her, about her son, and about the boy's father from Mrs. Miller--NONE of which I'll reveal here because it complicates the story, appropriately. But Davis should be up for Best Supporting Actress, unless Amy Adams gets it!Father Flynn eventually confronts Sister Aloysius and, what can I say but that nobody's perfect! Yeah, yeah, that's a tease. But my spouse first felt that she was disappointed in Hoffman's acting until I explained the way I saw it and then she agreed his acting was off the scale!At the end, the film reminded me a little of ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" or some other Kubrick films in that one isn't exactly sure what happened. And, for the first time in the film, even Sister Aloysius isn't sure. She has DOUBT! And Sister James, while occasionally antagonizine Sister Aloysius, offers a little consolation to her superior, becoming somewhat of a confidant.The script offers challenges to church hierarchy; Sister Aloysius was supposed to have called the pastor, not a sister at another parish; despite what Father Flynn MIGHT have done--Did he or didn't he? That's for you to determine--he was promoted because his superior disregarded any suspicion. It also challenges moral certainty--an issue my spouse and I had been talking about pertinent to one of her colleagues just a week before. In short, the script is brilliant.John Patrick Shanley, the playwright, is clearly a talented individual. He wrote the play, he wrote the screenplay, and he directed the film. And the film is worth seeing. The acting is so worth of oscars that I'm glad I'm not on a board that would have to decide this year on who's entitled to those awards!See it--whether recoverning Catholic school veteran or not--and think.",5,"Superb script, incredible acting",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,4853,"['must', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'review', 'Doubt', 'masterwork', 'even', 'what',

1226831,A4JHEO7H330AF,B001PA0FF4,Tom Brody,"[4, 7]","DOUBT is an excellent film taking place entirely in a Catholic school for boys and girls.  The storyline shares a remote similarity with FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and with Fellini's AMARCORD, in that the viewer is treated to scenes showing innocuous wrong-doings by schoolchildren.  For example, the film DOUBT shows a boy in dance class doing steps to the Mashed Potatoes, when the actual school lesson is to learn the Bossa Nova.  Of course, dancing the Mashed Potatoes when the teacher wants you do dance the Bossa Nova is not much of a wrongdoing.  In another scene, a boy in class gets in trouble because the teacher catches him listening to a transistor radio during history lesson in the Catholic school.  But these things provide a nice counterpoint to the wrongdoing of Meryl Streep, described below.In other scenes, the viewer is treated to a couple of unusually articulate sermons, played by famed actor, Philip Hoffman. One of these sermons concerns the concept of ""doubt.""  In the sermon, Mr. Hoffman takes the example of the assassination of President Kennedy, and he mentions the collective doubt, alienation, and anxiety, shared by most Americans at the time (November 22, 1963).  The sermon then cleverly continues with the concept of doubt, as it applies to personal (non-collective) tragedies, as when a person has contracted a terminal illness, or when a person has lost his best friend.  In a separate clever sermon, by Mr. Hoffman, the topic is rumor-mongering.  This sermon compares rumors to a pillow of feathers that is cut open, resulting in feathers being scattered to the wind. At this point, the viewer might expect the movie DOUBT to develop a positive spin regarding Catholicism and the Catholic church, for example, in the manner so elegantly developed in Mr. Clint Eastwood's movie from 2008, GRAN TORINO.  But in DOUBT, this does not come to pass. The positive spin never occurs.  Instead, what happens is a step-by-step account of a witch-hunt conducted by Meryl Streep against Philip Hoffman.The principal of the Catholic school, played by Meryl Streep, finds evidence that the priest (Philip Hoffman) is engaging in hanky-panky with one of the boys, a 12-year old.  But the ""evidence"" is, at best, minimal.  The Meryl Streep character is easy to hate, because she is a very stern nun.  Moreover, she is easy to hate because she uses rumors, innuendos, and self-righteous gossip, in attempt to ruin the career of Philip Hoffman.  Regarding Meryl Streep's willingness to perceive wrongdoing with minimal evidence, the viewer is treated to a scene where Meryl Streep demonstrates how she is able to detect bad behavior of classroom students by looking at their reflection, where the reflection is provided by the glass that covers a photograph of the Pope.  (An amusing aspect of this episode, is that Meryl Streep states that it does not matter that the photo is of a former Pope, as long as a reflection of the classroom students appears in the glass.)  The viewer is treated to further development of this technique, where Meryl Streep's protege, a young nun played by Amy Adams, uses this same reflection technique to catch misbehaving students. When taken out of context, this scene is amusing.  However, this scene is actually a demonstration of Meryl Streep's pernicious willingness to accuse other people based on minimal evidence.  At any rate, Meryl Streep assembles minimal evidence that Philip Hoffman is dilly-dallying with a 12-year old boy, she accuses Mr. Hoffman of dilly-dallying.  As a consequence, he resigns from the Catholic school.  (In this process, Mr. Hoffman accepts a better position at another Catholic school, but this is besides the point.)I only have one complaint about the script.  This is about the ending of the movie. At the end of the movie, the Meryl Streep character expresses self-doubt, feels guilty, and loses composure, because of her own behavior in conducting a witch-hunt against the priest.  But this does not ring true.  In my opinion, it is not the case that people who conduct witch-hunts ever feel pangs of self-doubt or of guilt.  A better ending, and a more realistic ending, would have been for Meryl Streep to embark on a fresh witch-hunt (Joseph McCarthy-style) against another priest.Why only three stars?  First, the main theme of this movie is unpleasant, that is, innuendos, rumors, and gossip.  This topic does not make a pleasant film. Second, the film deals with a strict, dictatorial nun (Meryl Streep).  This is also not pleasant.  Third, I have a continuing issue with actor Meryl Streep.  I did not like what she did to Dustin Hoffman in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, a film from 1979.  She also did THE SAME THING to a farmer in the movie, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTRY.  To conclude, although the script in DOUBT is flawless, and although the acting is first-rate, I found the movie to be a stinky film.  In my opinion, witch-hunts are stinky, and also, films about witch-hunts are stinky.  It is quite possible that another customer of Amazon.com will find enjoyment in watching 90 minutes of pernicious rumors, innuendos, and gossip.  However, I cannot.

1226832,A1YYA7TDET32WC,B001PA0FF4,"Ugur Akinci ""Fortune 500 Tech Writer""","[3, 3]","The movie ""Doubt (2008)"" is an experience you shouldn't miss. It's a moral roller-coaster and ethical juggernaut of a story brought to life by two of the finest actors you can find in any country on any continent: Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Father Brendan Flynn) and Meryl Streep (as the sister with the impossible name: Aloysius Beauvier).The plot is both very simple and not so very simple. Sister Aloysius is a disciplinarian. She thinks modernity is relaxing people and sapping away their character and faith. That's why she is even against using ballpoint pen in the church school. She is a hard-as-nails woman suspicious of anything and everything around her - which betrays her hunger for control and power as well.Opposite her is Father Flynn, a beautiful compassionate man who is trying to change the stodgy old ways of the church and welcome all parishioners regardless of their imperfections. He thinks the church should be more like the people; an idea which Sister Aloysius abhors. She believes people actually enjoy the priests and nuns to be very different from the common folk and that's why they believe in clergy and continue to have faith in the church.Into this dyad, steps in Sister James, played by another actor of note and immense talent, Amy Adams, an Irish beauty with clear eyes which reminds me of a younger Jane Fonda.Sister James observes certain things about Father Flynn. Just impressions. Snippets of sense data. She ""catches"" Father Flynn dropping something into the locker of the only African American student in the church school, Donald (played by Joseph Foster). She is aware that Father has met with this boy ALONE in his room. Hmmm... that the kid was caught with ALCOHOL on his breath... another hmmm... The question ""is there really anything going on here?"" somehow spins into ""what's exactly going on here?"" in the mind of the impressionable Sister James.Then, Sister James, in all her naivete, commits the monumental blunder of sharing her ""doubt"" with the Sister General, who is also the principal of the school. And the rest is a tsunami of innuendo, picking up speed and becoming a head-on train wreck, a spectacle which forces us to question our very own assumptions about what's a fact and what's a gossip. To what extend should we trust our own assumptions about ""human nature""?The very last scene of this great film throws in a monkey wrench so fast that you can never see it coming. And the film ends right there, leaving you stunned as though you're zapped by a taser gun, without any adequate cooling off period to come back to your senses. You'll go home fighting back your tears and looking deep into your own heart about the way you went through similar situations in your own past, sometimes in flying colors and sometimes in colors that faded fast into mediocrity and moral self-righteousness.

On one side of the coin is faith and the other doubt. While this movie deals with the suspicions of an uptight nun (Meryl Streep), a young acolayte (Amy Adams)about whether the beloved Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)abused a young boy, it's really about doubt and faith (hence the title)as well as what motivates us to embrace one or the other.Father Flynn has taken a young African American boy under his wing--the first in a white school consisting of people of Irish and Italian descent. He clearly identifies with the boy. Different people will come away with different impressions (this isn't really a mystery focusing on whether or not he did it as much as what and why we choose to believe)after watching this and it does reward with mulitple viewings.The Blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. I also saw a preview of the DVD and it looks quite good as well. Both have the same special features including a commentary track with John Patrick Shanley. He's engaging, entertaining and informative unlike some solo commentary tracks. We also get a very good making of featurette, one that focuses on the ""Sisters of Charity"" order that the nuns belong to in the film. We also hear from various nuns as to their impression of the play and film (particularly from the woman that inspired Sister James played by Adams who was one of Shanley's teachers). The only thing missing is a joint commentary track from the cast although Hoffman, Adams and Streep do appear in a segment answering questions about the film, their roles. They all give thoughtful, entertaining and intelligent answers.John Patrick Shanley has done a terrific job adapting his play to the screen making it more cinematic in often subtle (and not so subtle)ways. The performances are brilliant--all three main actors were deservedly nominated for Oscars as was the film itself. Shanley expertly mines his experience raised in the Roman Catholic faith and being taunt at a Catholic school in Boston. Set in 1964 ""Doubt"" symbolizes the winds of change that were shaking the nation, politics and the Catholic Church with Vatican II. This film isn't really about the Catholic Church nor is it about the alleged abuse itself and how it is dealt with but it's really about the conflict between doubt, faith, old and the new way of doing things in a institution struggling to remain relevant during the turbulent 1960's.In the end all you can do is wake up in the morning, flip the coin and hope for the best but you won't be flipping a coin when it comes to the quality of this terrific drama.

1226839,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001PA0FF4,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 4]","Based on the award-winning play and adapted for the screen by John Patrick Shanley, who also directs this film, ""DOUBT"" is a riveting, powerful film full of raw emotional drama that registers as something truly worthy of praise. It has been made outstanding by the exceptional performances that would give you goose bumps and enough meat to talk about after the first viewing. It is just a film almost impossible to ignore with its superb direction, beautiful but simple cinematography--truly an awesome blend of solid storytelling and powerful performances. I was truly awed.A year after the Kennedy assassination, in a Catholic church with a school in its grounds, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a progressive priest with ideas that defy tradition. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is a traditional nun who is also the school's principal, who believes in protecting and preserving known rules and old-school beliefs. The two are meant for a battle of wills and on the sidelines is nave sister James (Amy Adams). When Sister James brings her observations to Sister Aloysius about the things she had seen about a lone African-American student, Donald. The school principal is pushed to believe that Father Flynn may have an undesirable relationship with the young student, without the benefit of solid evidence. Flynn denies the charges that leads the elder nun to pursue an audience with Donald's mother (played by Viola Davis), leaving Sister James confused and the matter eating away at her conscience...I know what you're thinking--who is right and who is wrong? Did Flynn really molest the boy? With the film's very strong Catholic overtone, the direction presents a very suffocating screenplay. Both Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius appear to have the best interests of the boy in mind, both characters are sympathetic and believable; even Sister James have her heart in the right place. I suppose if there are any bad guys in this film, it would be our own PERCEPTION. It sends us to a wild moody set piece that bring us to the uttermost places of uncertainty.Catholic authority is also somewhat called into play as this church is obviously one divided by gender (as illustrated with the separate scenes of social intermingling at dinner). One may think that Aloysius has the motivation to grab power from Flynn, the script effectively represents the psychological dissertation between our two main characters. The film goes into the opposing viewpoints--things that need to be changed within the confines of the rectory and things that need preserving. It was a nice to touch to see Aloysius annoyed when Flynn wanted sugar in his tea. Both sides have a point, but it is difficult to take a side and nor does Shanley point an accusing finger. The dialogue is very strong and the material is well structured; the screenplay is very enthralling as it takes the viewer to behavioral actions that provokes our curiosity. Director Shanley also takes a look at the premise and methodically shows the larger picture, at the same time it kept on generating a strong uneasy feeling that can get under your skin.The lingering suspicion is powerfully played to its fullest and I will be honest, it is driving me crazy. The excellently staged exchanges of dialogue between Streep and Hoffman are truly awe-inspiring. I have always loved both performers and this movie just justifies my reasons as to why. The more they bicker and argue the more the truth becomes cloudy. The two have good reason to protect the details from each other's eyes, and I have to commend the script by Shanley; he obviously chose the words carefully--with the sole purpose of confusing, provoking our senses and engaging the viewer in its sequences.Aside from Hoffman and Streep's exchanges, there is also a very emotionally charged exchange with Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother. That scene almost made my jaw drop as I was very moved with their conversation. Donald is a child with a huge problem--is Father Davis helping or is he taking advantage? Sister James doesn't think so after she had a conversation with Father Flynn in the garden. Amy James does feel a little too ditzy, and I guess that is just the way her character needed to be portrayed. The film is just a marvelous roller coaster of emotional exchanges and when you have such performers as Hoffman and Streep, you will have to prepare to be absolutely impressed.""Doubt"" has marvelous writing that fabulously challenges the viewer to question and well, ""doubt"" the film's resolution. Shanley made a wise move in not dissecting the truth, and express the insidiousness of rumors and gossip. It also makes a bold statement about faith, tradition and trust that sometimes we need to listen and restrain our potential for damaging perceptions; and Shanley amazingly does so without discrediting religion. ""Doubt"" is a powerful motion picture since I am certain that I will be pondering its final act long after the end credits stop rolling. Those who like their moral dramas with an absolute resolution may be a little disappointed, but for those who doesn't mind pondering what they've seen are in for a treat. I like films that leave me asking questions, it is a welcome departure from the usual Hollywood fare that spoon-feeds the answers.Highly Recommended!!

Sanders,"[3, 5]","When I see the talents of Meryl Streep squandered in films like ""Mama Mia,"" I am certain that her only absolution and redemption is to make a film like ""Doubt."" Some may lament the subtle development of the characters and mystery and the equally subtle resolution, but for me it's about time we don't get some obvious ending where everyone and everything is happily resolved. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the priest with the perfect amount of good 'ole boy among fellow priests and bully--threatening any who dare question him. In a small scene in the film Viola Davis (for which she deserved the best supporting actress) and Meryl Streep discuss the options of a young black child in 1960's America. This small scene tells more than many  hand-wringing epics on the same subject. Amy Adams (who also was nominated for best supporting actress for this film) acted more as a catalyst between the giant roles of Streep and Hoffman, and in some respects depicted the bewilderment of the audience.

Meryl Streep is superb as Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Catholic secondary school that faces a coming era of change in 1964 when this drama is set. The night before I saw ""Doubt"", I watched the DVD of Mamma Mia! How can one woman be so talented? Meryl Streep is simply amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman has to be a lock for best actor performance in my book. He matches Streep stride for stride, and convinces us of his role with subtlety of facial expression as well as a huge dynamic range of tone and timbre in the delivery of his lines. Best Supporting Actresses -- and there are two. The larger part belongs to Amy Adams, who is superbly nuanced as Sister James. In her role, we can almost feel the innocence of the 1950s becoming the breakdown of authority in the 60's and 70's. Little foxes running rampant in the vineyard! I was stunned by Adams' acting skill in this very difficult role. However, I cannot give her my supporting actress award by herself. Viola Davis, as the mother of a troubled black student at the school, has only one long scene plus a short later appearance. She handles it with consummate skill. Try conveying a realistic portrayal of a mother who is willing to accept a lesser evil in the life of her son in order to avoid a much greater evil. But both options are evil and destructive. Davis carries the day to perfection.Well, I don't have time to go through all the other badges of excellence this film should receive: best script (one of the best EVER), subtle direction, superb cinematography -- you feel like you are watching a black and white film at times, even though it is in color, because the cinematography matches so well with the somber mood of some scenes.Message. Lots of small messages that add up to one big message. A person has only so much capacity for dealing with and surviving the ravages of doubt. If you spend all of your certainty potential on a minor matter (oh, and you may be wrong about that), you won't have any left to deal with the really big decisions about God and your relationship with Him.Summary: This is a movie for thinking adults. If you are willing to invest a few hours in it, you will reap a huge return. If you are only looking for a light-hearted hour of entertainment, you might want to avoid this one. But, then, you will have missed the Best Picture, the Best Actress, the Best Actor, and the Best Supporting Actresses of 2008.

Her character is similar to the character she played in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" given they are both total beotches.

I can't figure out what they meant but I know they meant something. Technically,  I loved the way Doubt was filmed and I liked the colours they used, the cinematography was excellent.
