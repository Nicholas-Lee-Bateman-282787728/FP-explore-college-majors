Their music is still burned into our minds and their live performances are the stuff of legend.  To that point, The Doors supplied plenty of post-Independence Day fireworks on July 5, 1968 when the legendary quartet played the Hollywood Bowl, a concert that is considered to be the band's finest on film. For the first time, the film from the historic performance has been painstakingly restored using the original camera negatives and the audio has been remixed and mastered from original multi-tracks by the group's engineer Bruce Botnick. This new restoration offers a stunning visual upgrade from earlier versions and will give fans the closest experience to being there live alongside Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, who opined, ""You can hear it as if you were at the Hollywood Bowl, on stage with us.""LIVE AT THE BOWL '68 will include three previously unreleased tracks from the performance. Technical issues with the recording of ""Hello, I Love You,"" ""The WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat),"" and ""Spanish Caravan"" prevented them from being released in the past. Now, through meticulous restoration of the audio, all three will be included, marking the first time the concert has been available in its entirety.The DVD, Blu-Ray and digital video each feature a 16x9 high-definition digital transfer with both a stereo and 5.1 audio soundtrack as well as over an hour of bonus material. Included in the additional content are Echoes From The Bowl, The Doors' route to the Hollywood Bowl; You Had To Be There, memories of The Doors' performance at the Bowl; Reworking The Doors, an in-depth look at how the film was restored; and three bonus performances: Wild Child from The Smothers Brothers Show in 1968, Light My Fire from The Jonathan Winters Show in December 1967 and a version of Van Morrison's Gloria with specially created visuals.Jeff Jampol, Doors manager and producer of the film said ""The Doors' live performances were a shamanistic journey into dark rock and roll psychedelic theater - a swirling mixture of rock `n' roll heat, poetry, danger, drama and unbridled musical virtuosity. Captured at the height of The Doors' magical powers, in one of the world's greatest venues, this brand new restoration, edit and mix, corny as it may sound, made me fall in love a hundred times, all over again.""Geoff Kempin, executive producer for Eagle Rock said ""The Doors were one of THE most incredible live bands ever - we wanted to apply the top technology so that everyone can fully appreciate the phenomenon of The Doors captured at their height on 5 July 1968"".In addition to Doors fans, music and pop culture historians will definitely want to own their own copy of this masterful restoration of this historic performance by one of rock's iconic bands: The DoorsBoomerocity.com",5,Revisiting Rock History,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,2959,"[""'re"", 'classic', 'rock', 'then', 'who', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'not', 'love', 'Doors', 'contribution', 'soundtrack', 'youth', 'music', 'still', 'burned', 'minds', 'live', 'performances', 'are', 'stuff', 'legend', 'point', 'Doors', 'supplied', 'plenty', 'post-Independence', 'Day', 'July', '5', '1968', 'when', 'legendary', 'quartet', 'played', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'concert', 'considered', 'be', 'band', 'finest', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'historic', 'performance', 'been', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'using', 'original', 'camera', 'negatives', 'audio', 'been', 'remixed', 'mastered', 'original', 'multi-tracks', 'group', 'engineer', 'Bruce', 'Botnick', 'new', 'restoration', 'stunning', 'visual', 'upgrade', 'earlier', 'versions', 'will', 'give', 'fans', 'closest', 'experience', 'being', 'there', 'live', 'alongside', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'John', 'Densmore', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'who', 'opined', 'can', 'hear', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'stage', 'LIVE', 'AT', 'THE', 'BOWL', ""'68"", 'will', 'include', 'three', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'tracks', 'performance', 'Technical', 'issues', 'recording', 'Hello', 'Love', 'WASP', 'Texas', 'Radio', 'Big', 'Beat', 'Spanish', 'Caravan', 'prevented', 'being', 'released', 'past', 'Now', 'meticulous', 'restoration', 'audio', 'three', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'marking', 'first', 'time', 'concert', 'been', 'available', 'entirety.The', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'digital', 'video', 'feature', '16x9', 'high-definition', 'digital', 'transfer', 'stereo', '5.1', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'hour', 'bonus', 'material', 'Included', 'additional', 'content', 'are', 'Echoes', 'Bowl', 'Doors', 'route', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'Had', 'Be', 'memories', 'Doors', 'performance', 'Bowl', 'Reworking', 'Doors', 'in-depth', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'restored', 'three', 'bonus', 'performances', 'Wild', 'Child', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Show', '1968', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Show', 'December', '1967', 'version', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'Gloria', 'specially', 'created', 'visuals.Jeff', 'Jampol', 'Doors', 'manager', 'producer', 'film', 'said', 'Doors', 'live', 'performances', 'were', 'shamanistic', 'journey', 'dark', 'rock', 'roll', 'psychedelic', 'theater', 'swirling', 'mixture', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'heat', 'poetry', 'danger', 'drama', 'unbridled', 'musical', 'virtuosity', 'Captured', 'height', 'Doors', 'magical', 'powers', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'venues', 'brand', 'new', 'restoration', 'edit', 'mix', 'corny', 'may', 'sound', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'hundred', 'times', 'over', 'again', 'Geoff', 'Kempin', 'executive', 'producer', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'said', 'Doors', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'live', 'bands', 'ever', 'wanted', 'apply', 'top', 'technology', 'so', 'everyone', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'phenomenon', 'Doors', 'captured', 'height', '5', 'July', '1968', 'addition', 'Doors', 'fans', 'music', 'pop', 'culture', 'historians', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'own', 'own', 'copy', 'masterful', 'restoration', 'historic', 'performance', 'one', 'rock', 'iconic', 'bands', 'DoorsBoomerocity.com']",N/A

1579813,A1H2QTHHP2DJJ5,B0090O07RS,David Thompson,"[3, 3]","A lot of time and energy has gone into this excellent digital restoration of ""Live at the Bowl '68"". An impressive achievement. And as I've commented before, in previous posts on this page, I was one of the cameramen that night, on stage filming Jim with a 16 mm Arriflex 16BL hand held camera.I see in the Product Information section on Amazon's ""Live at the Bowl '68"" page, the Director is listed as...The Doors. Well,  the cameramen and the overall film shoot that night was directed by Paul Ferrara. Paul was a classmate of Ray and Jim at UCLA Film School, as I also was, as well as most members of the film crew that night. Paul was working for the Doors, directing the shooting of footage for what would become the film, ""Feast of Friends"". The Hollywood Bowl concert was originally shot for inclusion of some of the footage in ""Feast of Friends"". And the last sequence of that film is The Doors' performance of ""The End"" that night at the Bowl. Paul Farrara was also the cinematographer on Jim's film, ""HYWAY"", or ""HWY"". Which Paul shot in gorgeous 35 mm  wide screen Eastman Color (I saw the only 35 mm Eastman Color release print a couple of times, in 1970) . ""HWY"" seems to have fallen into one of those copyright/ownership black holes, but, of course,  inferior bootleg versions have been posted on You Tube (as have re-edited and re-scored versions of ""Feast of Friends""). Hopefully, some day a digital transfer from the original 35 mm Eastman Color negative (wherever that cut negative is) will someday be available on what will be a visually stunning Blu-ray. Sequences from HWY can be seen in the documentary ""When You're Strange"", also available from Amazon. At some time in the early 1970's, Paul sold his percentage of the ""Feast of Friends"" film, all the footage shot as well as the finished film, back to the Doors. Which I guess gives them the right to put their name on the Hollywood Bowl concert as...The Director.The Doors' Hollywood Bowl concert is a very good concert. But, the best Doors concert I ever experienced in, a larger venue, was about 2 months later, at the Roundhouse in North London. The Doors played Friday and Saturday nights at the Roundhouse, on a double bill with The Jefferson Airplane. The Doors opened on Friday night, followed by the Airplane. Then The Doors did a second set, and the Airplane closed the show. On Saturday night the Airplane opened, then the Doors, then the Airplane and then the Doors closed the show. The Doors came on very early in the AM of Sunday, after the Underground had stopped running at 11:00 PM. Almost the entire audience stayed, and the Doors played until dawn, and the opening of the Underground on Sunday morning.  That second Doors performance on Saturday night is the very best Doors performance I've ever seen, outside of a club. That performance truly lived up to all the hype of a Doors performance being a shamanistic journey. Unfortunately, it's only available as a DVD transfer from a grainy 16 mm film shot and made by British TV. Not even the complete first Friday night performance. Most likely also available from Amazon.The best Doors' club performance I ever experienced was also the most powerful Doors-performance-as-shamanistic- journey I ever experienced. Which was at the old Ciro's nightclub, on the Sunset Strip, in a concert presented by Kaleidoscope, in Spring 1967. I wish that performance had been filmed, or video taped!",4,Back to the Bowl...Once again,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,3427,"['lot', 'time', 'energy', 'gone', 'excellent', 'digital', 'restoration', 'Live', 'Bowl', ""'68"", 'impressive', 'achievement', ""'ve"", 'commented', 'previous', 'posts', 'page', 'was', 'one', 'cameramen', 'night', 'stage', 'filming', 'Jim', '16', 'mm', 'Arriflex', '16BL', 'hand', 'held', 'camera.I', 'see', 'Product', 'Information', 'section', 'Amazon', 'Live', 'Bowl', ""'68"", 'page', 'Director', 'listed', 'Doors', 'Well', 'cameramen', 'overall', 'film', 'shoot', 'night', 'was', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Ferrara', 'Paul', 'was', 'classmate', 'Ray', 'Jim', 'UCLA', 'Film', 'School', 'also', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'members', 'film', 'crew', 'night', 'Paul', 'was', 'working', 'Doors', 'directing', 'shooting', 'footage', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'film', 'Feast', 'Friends', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'concert', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'inclusion', 'footage', 'Feast', 'Friends', 'last', 'sequence', 'film', 'Doors', 'performance', 'End', 'night', 'Bowl', 'Paul', 'Farrara', 'was', 'also', 'cinematographer', 'Jim', 'film', 'HYWAY', 'HWY', 'Which', 'Paul', 'shot', 'gorgeous', '35', 'mm', 'wide', 'screen', 'Eastman', 'Color', 'saw', 'only', '35', 'mm', 'Eastman', 'Color', 'release', 'print', 'couple', 'times', '1970', 'HWY', 'have', 'fallen', 'one', 'copyright/ownership', 'black', 'holes', 'course', 'inferior', 'bootleg', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'posted', 'Tube', 'have', 're-edited', 're-scored', 'versions', 'Feast', 'Friends', 'Hopefully', 'day', 'digital', 'transfer', 'original', '35', 'mm', 'Eastman', 'Color', 'negative', 'cut', 'negative', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'available', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Blu-ray', 'Sequences', 'HWY', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'documentary', 'When', ""'re"", 'Strange', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon', 'time', 'early', '1970', 'Paul', 'sold', 'percentage', 'Feast', 'Friends', 'film', 'footage', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'finished', 'film', 'back', 'Doors', 'Which', 'guess', 'right', 'put', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'concert', 'Director.The', 'Doors', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'concert', 'very', 'good', 'concert', 'best', 'Doors', 'concert', 'ever', 'experienced', 'larger', 'venue', 'was', '2', 'months', 'later', 'Roundhouse', 'North', 'London', 'Doors', 'played', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'Roundhouse', 'double', 'bill', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'Doors', 'opened', 'Friday', 'night', 'followed', 'Airplane', 'Then', 'Doors', 'did', 'second', 'set', 'Airplane', 'closed', 'show', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Airplane', 'opened', 'then', 'Doors', 'then', 'Airplane', 'then', 'Doors', 'closed', 'show', 'Doors', 'came', 'very', 'early', 'AM', 'Sunday', 'Underground', 'had', 'stopped', 'running', '11:00', 'PM', 'Almost', 'entire', 'audience', 'stayed', 'Doors', 'played', 'dawn', 'opening', 'Underground', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'second', 'Doors', 'performance', 'Saturday', 'night', 'very', 'best', 'Doors', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'club', 'performance', 'truly', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'Doors', 'performance', 'being', 'shamanistic', 'journey', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'grainy', '16', 'mm', 'film', 'shot', 'made', 'British', 'TV', 'Not', 'even', 'complete', 'first', 'Friday', 'night', 'performance', 'Most', 'likely', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon.The', 'best', 'Doors', 'club', 'performance', 'ever', 'experienced', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'powerful', 'Doors-performance-as-shamanistic-', 'journey', 'ever', 'experienced', 'Which', 'was', 'old', 'Ciro', 'nightclub', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'concert', 'presented', 'Kaleidoscope', 'Spring', '1967', 'wish', 'performance', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'video', 'taped']",N/A

When I read that they re-stored the microphones carefully, restoring at least 2 songs I had to get it. ""Hello, I love you,"" and ""Unknown Soldier"" both come alive with greater power than other live versions. No one could touch the band, and nobody could top Jim Morrison's theatricality in full, improvisational force. Every reason for taking a literature class, especially poetry gets full credence. You are transfixed as Jim prowls his improvisational licks without missing a beat, seamlessly moving into another killer song like ""Unknown Soldier,"" which surpasses the excitement of the black-and-white European tour version. The Bonus Features make it more than collectible featuring: a wonderful final interview with the surviving members recollecting that time and their place in it, just a wonderful thanks to their fans.

Alternatively, Jim Morrison, who was already showing the disillusionment of being a rock star, said ""just give me my microphone, and do whatever you want to do."" Maybe if Morrison had been more receptive to the idea and they had gone through with it, the costumes would have distracted them from giving one of the best concerts of their career, and it was filmed.""Live at the Bowl `68"" shows The Doors at the height of their musical prowess and their career. The summer before ""Light My Fire"" had made The Doors a nationally known act when it hit number one on Billboard's charts. Later in July of 1968 ""Hello, I Love You"" would do the same, and in September of 1968 they flew to Europe on what would become their one European tour. The Hollywood Bowl show was to be a celebration of The Doors and it was a hometown audience for the band, as well as the prestige of playing at the Hollywood Bowl. Before the show The Doors met and had dinner with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both of whom attended the Hollywood Bowl show with Pam reportedly sitting on Jagger's lap during the show. That spring The Doors had started filming the shows that would become ""Feast of Friends"" so they decided to film the Hollywood Bowl show. If all that wasn't enough pressure, Morrison took a hit of acid before going on.""Live at the Bowl `68""  reveals the stark theatre of The Doors, Morrison prowling the stage, the rat-a-tat-tat of John Densmore's drums, Manzarek's apparent joy as he played, and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger wandering the stage like a lost troubadour. The Hollywood Bowl was an atypical Doors show in a couple of ways, one that they rehearsed prior to the show, and the second was The Doors had a setlist for the show and stuck to it! Something they rarely did. The deconstruction of ""Celebration of the Lizard"" that had poetic segues into the more traditional songs such as ""Light My Fire"" creates a jarring, disconcerting and theatrical effect. Morrison demonstrates his command of an audience, highlighted during ""The End"" when he goofs on a grasshopper he sees onstage and creates the impromtu ""Ode to a Grasshopper."" When he realizes it's a moth says ""uh-oh, I blew it, it's a moth"" and gets a laugh, but he pulls everyone back into the tension and drama of the song.Then there's the reason for the release of this DVD, the restored three songs ""Hello, I Love You,"" ""The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat),"" and ""Spanish Caravan,"" finally make this show complete. The show was remastered and digitally transferred. The color has also been restored. You can see the green of the carpeting The Doors were playing on and Jim Morrison's face doesn't turn purple or look fuzzy as it does on ""The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl."" The restoration lives up to the claims on the promotional materials that it `feels like you're on stage with the band.'Something else that is unusual for The Doors is the DVD contains many bonus features, including ""Echoes From the Bowl,"" a brief history of the Hollywood Bowl, and includes The Doors history leading to the show at the bowl.

1579826,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0090O07RS,M. Oleson,"[14, 16]","This brief 71 minute concert is said to be the best The Doors ever recorded.  I never actually saw them live but certainly remember the directional change they and others had on modern music.  The producers of the Blu ray transfer that I watched should be commended for their efforts to resurrect this filmed version.  The original film was directed by keyboard player Ray Manzarek.Aside from an unusual amount of shots from ""right field"" the overall work is decent.  The audio work was very good.  The audio engineer in 1968 was Bruce Botnick who also did the mix and restoration work on this disc.  Botnick notes in his booklet notes that lead singer Jim Morrison had dropped acid just before going on.  I suspect that wasn't the only thing he had been ingesting.Frankly his performance was pretty poor.  He spends a lot of time dancing around the stage, while his band mates play the same refrain over and over, waiting for him to return.  On one song he nearly nods off standing at the mic before screaming ""wake up.""  I don't think that was aimed at the audience.  Guitarist Robby Krieger also appears high, floating around Morrison with mostly background strumming.  His one brief solo is good not great.John Densmore on drums and Manzarek carried this concert and I suspect the band, at least on this night.  Densmore didn't seem to miss a beat and certainly had a bead on Morrison.  The more I listen and look at this band, I tend to give more and more credit to Manzarek.  As the keyboard player and without a bass player in the band, Manzarek handles the beat on the lower octaves as well as alternate as the lead instrument with Krieger.  I suspect everybody was stoned but Manzarek had that little grin on his face, suggesting ""I can't believe we're playing the Hollywood Bowl.""  This was a big deal at the time.While my comments suggest I didn't like this concert, I did.  I just think it could have been better with a more coherent Morrison.  For me the best songs came midway through with ""Moonlight Drive,"" ""Horse Latitudes,""  ""A Little Game,"" ""The Hill Dwellers"" and ""Spanish Caravan.""It is evident that this aging film required some serious video noise reduction.  Even so, the clarity is less than great, especially on the many distant shots.  There is new material added to the original version and some of it was edited out for a reason.  Certainly on the mid-range and close-ups the picture is very good.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option as well as LPCM stereo.  I only listened to the 5.1 and it is excellent.  Certain audio segments were in fact lost on some of the songs and were recreated using other concerts.  If you watch closely you can see some synch issues, but they are barely noticeable and not a big deal.  In general the audio track is clear and authentic.Here are the added bonus features which add about an hour to the disc (HD and SD):Echoes from the Bowl: Background piece on the performance venue.You Had to Be There: Interviews with Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, Robby Krieger, The Chambers Brothers (opening acts), and others.Reworking The Doors: A look at the efforts to restore the concert.Wild Child (From The Smothers Brothers Show)Light My Fire (From The Jonathan Winters Show)Gloria (Music Video)",3,3 1/2 stars for a great Blu ray transfer of rare concert,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,3318,"['brief', '71', 'minute', 'concert', 'said', 'be', 'best', 'Doors', 'ever', 'recorded', 'never', 'actually', 'saw', 'live', 'certainly', 'remember', 'directional', 'change', 'others', 'had', 'modern', 'music', 'producers', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'watched', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'efforts', 'resurrect', 'filmed', 'version', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'keyboard', 'player', 'Ray', 'Manzarek.Aside', 'unusual', 'amount', 'shots', 'right', 'field', 'overall', 'work', 'decent', 'audio', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'audio', 'engineer', '1968', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Botnick', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'mix', 'restoration', 'work', 'disc', 'Botnick', 'notes', 'booklet', 'notes', 'lead', 'singer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'had', 'dropped', 'acid', 'just', 'before', 'going', 'suspect', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'been', 'ingesting.Frankly', 'performance', 'was', 'pretty', 'poor', 'lot', 'time', 'dancing', 'stage', 'band', 'mates', 'play', 'same', 'refrain', 'waiting', 'return', 'one', 'song', 'nearly', 'nods', 'off', 'standing', 'mic', 'screaming', 'wake', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'aimed', 'audience', 'Guitarist', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'also', 'high', 'floating', 'Morrison', 'mostly', 'strumming', 'one', 'brief', 'solo', 'good', 'not', 'great.John', 'Densmore', 'drums', 'Manzarek', 'carried', 'concert', 'suspect', 'band', 'least', 'night', 'Densmore', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'miss', 'beat', 'certainly', 'had', 'bead', 'Morrison', 'more', 'listen', 'look', 'band', 'tend', 'give', 'more', 'more', 'credit', 'Manzarek', 'keyboard', 'player', 'bass', 'player', 'band', 'Manzarek', 'beat', 'lower', 'octaves', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'alternate', 'lead', 'instrument', 'Krieger', 'suspect', 'everybody', 'was', 'stoned', 'Manzarek', 'had', 'little', 'grin', 'face', 'suggesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'playing', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'time.While', 'comments', 'suggest', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'concert', 'did', 'just', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'coherent', 'Morrison', 'best', 'songs', 'came', 'midway', 'Moonlight', 'Drive', 'Horse', 'Latitudes', 'Little', 'Game', 'Hill', 'Dwellers', 'Spanish', 'Caravan', 'evident', 'aging', 'film', 'required', 'serious', 'video', 'noise', 'reduction', 'Even', 'so', 'clarity', 'less', 'great', 'especially', 'many', 'distant', 'shots', 'new', 'material', 'added', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'reason', 'Certainly', 'mid-range', 'close-ups', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', '1080p', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'option', 'as', 'well', 'LPCM', 'stereo', 'only', 'listened', '5.1', 'excellent', 'Certain', 'audio', 'segments', 'were', 'fact', 'lost', 'songs', 'were', 'recreated', 'using', 'other', 'concerts', 'watch', 'closely', 'can', 'see', 'synch', 'issues', 'are', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'general', 'audio', 'track', 'clear', 'are', 'added', 'bonus', 'features', 'add', 'hour', 'disc', 'HD', 'SD', 'Echoes', 'Bowl', 'Background', 'piece', 'performance', 'venue.You', 'Had', 'Be', 'Interviews', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'John', 'Densmore', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'Chambers', 'Brothers', 'opening', 'acts', 'others.Reworking', 'Doors', 'look', 'efforts', 'restore', 'concert.Wild', 'Child', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Show', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Show', 'Gloria', 'Music', 'Video']",N/A

The result are quiet surprising in this Blu-Ray with no grainy spots in the picture and some nice black levels. But the main treat is the DTS surround mix that let you hear the guitar of Mr. Krieger circulating in the speakers. Naturally the picture of a old show can't be as sharp as a new concert, but they did a nice restoration of the picture and especially the sound, because in some songs, were missing the sound of Jim's voice on the original tape. These details are fully explained in the excellent documentary in the extras.Seeing the young Jim Morrison clearly affected by LSD is kind of strange, but he managed to start the show with control, but as the show progress, he tend to extend the notes longer, his mind starting to slow down a bit, but it didn't affected the music that much.This is a complete show even at  72 minutes long. It goes in a flash when you feel immersed in the music of this original classic rock band that developed  a original sound with a unique singer that add poetry to his singing. It's only sad that he died a few years later, because the band could have made a lot more music, who knows.",5,"Short, but intense!",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,1244,"['Almost', '45', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'now', 'restoration', 'legendary', 'concert', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'July', '5', '1968', 'result', 'are', 'quiet', 'surprising', 'Blu-Ray', 'grainy', 'spots', 'picture', 'nice', 'black', 'levels', 'main', 'treat', 'DTS', 'surround', 'mix', 'let', 'hear', 'guitar', 'Mr.', 'Krieger', 'circulating', 'speakers', 'Naturally', 'picture', 'old', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'sharp', 'new', 'concert', 'did', 'nice', 'restoration', 'picture', 'especially', 'sound', 'songs', 'were', 'missing', 'sound', 'Jim', 'voice', 'original', 'tape', 'details', 'are', 'fully', 'explained', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'extras.Seeing', 'young', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'clearly', 'affected', 'LSD', 'kind', 'strange', 'managed', 'start', 'show', 'control', 'show', 'progress', 'tend', 'extend', 'notes', 'longer', 'mind', 'starting', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'affected', 'music', 'much.This', 'complete', 'show', 'even', '72', 'minutes', 'long', 'flash', 'when', 'feel', 'immersed', 'music', 'original', 'classic', 'rock', 'band', 'developed', 'original', 'sound', 'unique', 'singer', 'poetry', 'singing', 'only', 'sad', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'band', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'music', 'who']",N/A
