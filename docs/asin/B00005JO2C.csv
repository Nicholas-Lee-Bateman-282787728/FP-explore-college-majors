These western episodes with the handsome, intelligent, down-to-earth gambler are refreshing because of the light approach paired with classic situations from the settling of the west.

Fun, clean, entertainment for families.  Though my memory fades me of the episodes, getting re-aquainted will be an enjoyment.James Garner, and Jack Kelly were so cool, handsome, and smart. Though they got into a jam many times, it was always fun to watch them overcome their dilemma.  Many times, Jack Kelly had to get James Garner out of trouble.  James Garner, a card shark, and Jack Kelly, a ladies man among many other things.One poster noted the theme song not being present in the episodes, which I did notice as well.  It was not present in the ending of the episode either.  I am not sure when the title song was sang during the show.  So far, only the music was played.  This is not a problem for me, for my interest is in the show itself.  There are some grainy areas in the show as another reviewer pointed out.  As long as its not too bad, I can put up with it.I will say that the packaging is terrible.  The case is bulky and cheap.  My case was broken on one end.  I placed some tape to secure the other side from losing any of the discs.  This show deserves better packaging as others I've seen in the past.  To save a dollar, some companies will put out just about anything.  This tells me a lot about the value of their image.  Because of this, I gave one less star for the packaging issue.  Five stars for the show though.

I was able to scare up a half dozen episdoes of the series and they just watched them over and over.  When they heard the great news about this upcoming release they were ecstatic.

And may they also bring back other classic Warner shows like the highly entertaining 77 SUNSET STRIP.

639011,A39FAGMPGDZ8X1,B00005JO2C,"Jon Glade ""Jon Forrest Glade""","[1, 3]","I remember ""Maverick"" as the apex of fifties television, despite the fact that I didn't regularly see television until late in 1958. My wife also remembered the program in much the same way, and she was raised with a television set in her home so early that she doesn't remember a time when television wasn't a part of her life. When the price of ""Maverick: The Complete First Season"" fell a little a few weeks after Christmas last year, we decided to buy a copy although the price did seem a little too dear; sad to say, we were disappointed. The reality of the first season did not match our memories of the series. Granted, I never saw a single episode of the first season until the DVD set arrived (and at that time the second season was not yet available, or I would have ordered it instead because it was the first season of the series I was able to watch and I probably saw ninety per cent of the episodes). I suppose, in hindsight, that we shouldn't have been expected the first season to match our expectations; ""Maverick"" always seemed a little unbalanced, since it was more like two closely related series than a consistently entertaining program. I knew that Jack Kelly hadn't originally been part of the series and had been introduced to give James Garner some relief in a grueling work schedule (and I suspect to keep the individual shows from seeming rushed and/or unpolished). Watching the first seven episodes, I really didn't expect great material nor did I get it, although the stories did seem a bit different than the few other series from the same year that I have been able to see again recently, and the scripts seemed a bit better than those of the competiion. However, once the Bart Maverick character was introduced, I expected much better episodes and, naturally, they did not meet my expectations; the ones with James Garner were appreciably no better, and those with Jack Kelly clearly weren't in the same league. I will admit that there were two or three episodes (one featuring Kelly solo) that were quite good, but I was seeing very little sign of the ""old Maverick Magic."" Frankly, I wonder if any part of the series was as good as I remember it being, because the first season may have had great potential but it seldom realized that potential. It could be that Maverick was head and shoulders above most of the competition at the time, might even have been the apex of fifties television with the '58 - '59 and/or the '59 - '60 season, but that the true high water marks of early television hadn't yet been reached during the first season. To make a long story shorter, we watched the entire first season of Maverick then put it away and have not looked at any of it again (I might dig it out again when the weather gets cold and the nights are longer, but I might not).I'll admit that I would like to see at least part of the Second season, and since I would be doing that with lowered expectations it might seem better than I fear. I do know that given my experience with the initial season, the price will have to come down some before I would seriously consider taking another chance.",3,Rather Disappointing...,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3124,"['remember', 'Maverick', 'apex', 'fifties', 'television', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'regularly', 'see', 'television', 'late', '1958', 'wife', 'also', 'remembered', 'program', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'raised', 'television', 'set', 'home', 'so', 'early', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'life', 'When', 'price', 'Maverick', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'fell', 'little', 'few', 'weeks', 'Christmas', 'last', 'year', 'decided', 'buy', 'copy', 'price', 'did', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'dear', 'sad', 'say', 'were', 'disappointed', 'reality', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'memories', 'series', 'Granted', 'never', 'saw', 'single', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'arrived', 'time', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'available', 'would', 'have', 'ordered', 'instead', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'probably', 'saw', 'ninety', 'cent', 'episodes', 'suppose', 'hindsight', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'first', 'season', 'match', 'expectations', 'Maverick', 'always', 'seemed', 'little', 'unbalanced', 'was', 'more', 'two', 'closely', 'related', 'series', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'program', 'knew', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'had', ""n't"", 'originally', 'been', 'part', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'introduced', 'give', 'James', 'Garner', 'relief', 'grueling', 'work', 'schedule', 'suspect', 'keep', 'individual', 'seeming', 'rushed', 'and/or', 'unpolished', 'Watching', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'material', 'did', 'get', 'stories', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'different', 'few', 'other', 'series', 'same', 'year', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'recently', 'scripts', 'seemed', 'bit', 'better', 'competiion', 'However', 'once', 'Bart', 'Maverick', 'character', 'was', 'introduced', 'expected', 'much', 'better', 'episodes', 'naturally', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'expectations', 'ones', 'James', 'Garner', 'were', 'appreciably', 'better', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'clearly', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'will', 'admit', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'one', 'featuring', 'Kelly', 'solo', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'seeing', 'very', 'little', 'sign', 'old', 'Maverick', 'Magic', 'Frankly', 'wonder', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'being', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'seldom', 'realized', 'potential', 'could', 'be', 'Maverick', 'was', 'head', 'shoulders', 'most', 'competition', 'time', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'apex', 'fifties', 'television', ""'58"", ""'59"", ""'59"", ""'60"", 'season', 'true', 'high', 'water', 'marks', 'early', 'television', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'reached', 'first', 'season', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'shorter', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Maverick', 'then', 'put', 'away', 'have', 'not', 'looked', 'again', 'might', 'dig', 'out', 'again', 'when', 'weather', 'cold', 'nights', 'are', 'longer', 'might', 'not', '.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'least', 'part', 'Second', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'might', 'seem', 'better', 'fear', 'do', 'know', 'given', 'experience', 'initial', 'season', 'price', 'will', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'would', 'seriously', 'consider', 'taking', 'chance']",Maverick: Season 1

This was the series that made James Garner famous and shaped much of his image that audiences enjoyed in his second TV hit ""The Rockford Files"" as well as films such as ""The Great Escape"" and ""Support Your Local Sheriff"".When ""Maverick"" first appeared in 1957, it immediately set itself apart from most Western series thanks to its somewhat lighter approach and the magnetic character that Garner had created. While the first episodes of the season are generally more serious in tone than what ""Maverick"" became famous for, the sheer entertainment value and strong story telling is apparent right from the get-go with the pilot episode ""War of the Silver Kings"" which demonstrated the ability of Bret Maverick to quickly think on his feet.The first seven episodes feature only James Garner, but it was taking too long to shoot each episode to fulfill the contract so they brought in Jack Kelly as Bret's brother Bart Maverick and they began splitting episodes. Kelly brought a much needed addition to the series with his unique personality and style which worked well with Garner. The series then began taking on the somewhat lighter tone that made ""Maverick"" famous.This 27 episode collection on 7 DVDs is moderately priced and well packaged, though there are no extras whatsoever which is a little sad considering the long wait for this series to come to DVD. There is a small insert which gives a basic description of each episode and highlights the noteworthy guest stars. Otherwise, this collection is fairly bare bones though it does have some highly entertaining episodes such as the aforementioned ""War of the Silver Kings"".Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this release is the fair to good quality of the episode prints themselves. There are scenes in some episodes such as ""Ghost Rider"" that are grainy and of poor quality. Perhaps the master prints are not in very good shape and either no effort or attempt was made to restore them. Plus, some episodes such as ""According to Hoyle"" and ""The Long Hunt"" actually used old stock footage from previous Warner Brother's western films such as ""Dodge City"".For the generally poorer quality of the episode prints and the lack of any extras, I am docking this DVD collection one star. However, this should not reflect poorly on the highly entertaining nature of the episodes themselves which certainly deserve a 5 star rating.For those who want to see James Garner establish the character that he became famous for, this is still a fine collection for those who want to see one of the most entertaining Western TV series ever made.",4,...and Maverick is the name...,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2713,"['years', 'celebrated', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'classic', 'Western', 'series', 'Maverick', 'finally', 'DVD', 'was', 'series', 'made', 'James', 'Garner', 'famous', 'shaped', 'much', 'image', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'TV', 'hit', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'such', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Sheriff', '.When', 'Maverick', 'first', 'appeared', '1957', 'immediately', 'set', 'apart', 'most', 'Western', 'series', 'thanks', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'approach', 'magnetic', 'character', 'Garner', 'had', 'created', 'first', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'generally', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'what', 'Maverick', 'became', 'famous', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'value', 'strong', 'story', 'telling', 'apparent', 'right', 'get-go', 'pilot', 'War', 'Silver', 'Kings', 'demonstrated', 'ability', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'quickly', 'think', 'feet.The', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'feature', 'only', 'James', 'Garner', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'shoot', 'episode', 'fulfill', 'contract', 'brought', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'Bret', 'brother', 'Bart', 'Maverick', 'began', 'splitting', 'episodes', 'Kelly', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'addition', 'series', 'unique', 'personality', 'style', 'worked', 'well', 'Garner', 'series', 'then', 'began', 'taking', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'tone', 'made', 'Maverick', 'famous.This', '27', 'episode', 'collection', '7', 'DVDs', 'moderately', 'priced', 'well', 'packaged', 'are', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'little', 'sad', 'considering', 'long', 'wait', 'series', 'come', 'DVD', 'small', 'insert', 'basic', 'description', 'episode', 'highlights', 'noteworthy', 'guest', 'stars', 'Otherwise', 'collection', 'fairly', 'bare', 'bones', 'have', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'such', 'aforementioned', 'War', 'Silver', 'Kings', 'most', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'release', 'fair', 'good', 'quality', 'episode', 'are', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'such', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'are', 'grainy', 'poor', 'quality', 'Perhaps', 'master', 'prints', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'shape', 'effort', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'restore', 'episodes', 'such', 'According', 'Hoyle', 'Long', 'Hunt', 'actually', 'used', 'old', 'stock', 'footage', 'previous', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'western', 'films', 'such', 'Dodge', 'City', 'generally', 'poorer', 'quality', 'episode', 'prints', 'lack', 'extras', 'am', 'docking', 'DVD', 'collection', 'one', 'star', 'However', 'should', 'not', 'reflect', 'poorly', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'nature', 'episodes', 'certainly', 'deserve', '5', 'star', 'rating.For', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'James', 'Garner', 'establish', 'character', 'became', 'famous', 'still', 'fine', 'collection', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Western', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'made']",Maverick: Season 1
