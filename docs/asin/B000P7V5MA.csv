1069259,A192UPT6KST3E2,B000P7V5MA,Gary W. Phelps,"[3, 3]","This DVD has a story which could be replayed in any major city around the world which has street crime in a poverty-stricken jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, thereal value of this DVD is the altruism of producer Antonio Capuano which resulted in groundbreaking international attention about neglected youth with nofuture in Italy, especially the poor of Naples. The producer illustrates all of this, in the true-to-life tragedy of a boy who is orphaned, and left with abusive relatives.  He roams the streets with a boy-and-girl gang of youths and joins in their drug abuse, prostitution and petty crimes.  Even worse, is a 12-year-old boy jailed by mistake with adult prisoners who rape and abuse him without mercy; then the boy is plagued by nightmares and bed-wetting.  After release, heand his other gang members are used sexually by adults, prostituted, and included in criminal activities with reckless abandon.  Why?  Italian youth under the age of 14 years old can not be arrested and jailed?!  In desperation, some of the gang members succumb to suicide or other self-destructive behaviors.  Theshocking reality of this DVD is enhanced by a cast of nonprofessional street boys and girls.  This is a film worthy of attention and viewing - more than once.",5,Vito and the Others,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,1258,"['DVD', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'replayed', 'major', 'city', 'world', 'street', 'crime', 'poverty-stricken', 'jurisdiction', 'Nevertheless', 'thereal', 'value', 'DVD', 'altruism', 'producer', 'Antonio', 'Capuano', 'resulted', 'groundbreaking', 'international', 'attention', 'neglected', 'youth', 'nofuture', 'Italy', 'especially', 'poor', 'Naples', 'producer', 'true-to-life', 'tragedy', 'boy', 'who', 'orphaned', 'left', 'abusive', 'relatives', 'streets', 'boy-and-girl', 'gang', 'youths', 'joins', 'drug', 'abuse', 'prostitution', 'petty', 'crimes', 'Even', 'worse', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'jailed', 'mistake', 'adult', 'prisoners', 'who', 'rape', 'abuse', 'mercy', 'then', 'boy', 'plagued', 'nightmares', 'bed-wetting', 'release', 'heand', 'other', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'used', 'sexually', 'adults', 'prostituted', 'included', 'criminal', 'activities', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'Why', 'Italian', 'youth', 'age', '14', 'years', 'old', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'arrested', 'jailed', 'desperation', 'gang', 'members', 'succumb', 'suicide', 'other', 'self-destructive', 'behaviors', 'Theshocking', 'reality', 'DVD', 'enhanced', 'cast', 'nonprofessional', 'street', 'boys', 'girls', 'film', 'worthy', 'attention', 'viewing', 'more', 'once']",N/A
