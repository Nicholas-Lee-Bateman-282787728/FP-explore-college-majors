1006000,A1NPROXGAEEPHD,B000GNVPZ0,"Amazon Customer ""Mrs. Snowman""","[1, 1]","No I don't own this series yet, but I was a HUGE Rainbow Brite fan in the 80s. I was really happy when she got her own syndicated cartoon for Sunday mornings and my dad recorded them all for me (but I have lost the VHS tapes of course!) However I thought it was rotten that they cut out certain scenes. I paid enough attention to notice this. Probably for essence of time on the air, but it was still crummy! Also I found it to be downright DIRTY that they up and took RB off the air and replaced it with dumb Lady Lovelilocks and the Pixie Tails (which was NEVER as popular!) Especially since they were supposed to air part II of The Beginning of Rainbow Land that Sunday (a rerun, of course, but I was recording it so I only had part I) Really dirty of Kideo TV to do that!! I remember when KCPQ channel 13 (now FOX) had the rights to the show, they aired the 3 origianal episodes (2+ hours) at first one a day but one weekend I was delighted when they did a whole marathon of them--the first 3. The following year, I guess KTZZ bought the rights and I was overjoyed to see more episodes!! Dang it, Rainbow Brite and Strawberry Shortcake were AWESOME!! I wish kids today could grow up like I did in the 80's.
