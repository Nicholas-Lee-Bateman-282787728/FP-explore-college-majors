If you like the TVD I would definitely recommend buying these DVD's - they are quite entertaining.  This particular show was when the show was still relatively new, but it was still enjoyable.",5,Good Entertainment,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,492,"['attended', '2014', 'TVD', 'PaleyFest', 'show', 'was', 'fantastic', 'screaming', 'was', 'hard', 'hear', 'actor', 'respond', 'questions', 'why', 'like', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'somehow', 'are', 'able', 'edit', 'out', 'screaming', 'can', 'actually', 'hear', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'saying', 'like', 'TVD', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'particular', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable']",The Vampire Diaries: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

Although I enjoy Vampire Diaries more than True Blood or Twilight, I always wondered if the show was taking their outside ideas and just adapting them...well, in this discussion Producer Kevin Williamson actually talks about how his show is NOT a knock-off!Everyone in Vampire Diaries is gorgeous, so it was awesome to hear the cast discuss everything that goes in to vampire make up and sexy abs :)  Now that I know just how much work goes into the make up, I don't feel quite as bad about myself! If you're a fan of the show at all, this DVD is a perfect supplement for those annoying days in-between episodes.",5,Great behind-the-scenes stuff with Nina Dobrev and others!,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,679,"['show', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'officially', 'obsessed', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'enjoy', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'more', 'True', 'Blood', 'Twilight', 'always', 'wondered', 'show', 'was', 'taking', 'outside', 'ideas', 'just', 'adapting', 'well', 'discussion', 'Producer', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'actually', 'how', 'show', 'NOT', 'knock-off', 'Everyone', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'awesome', 'hear', 'cast', 'discuss', 'everything', 'vampire', 'make', 'up', 'sexy', 'abs', 'Now', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'make', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'bad', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'supplement', 'annoying', 'days', 'in-between', 'episodes']",The Vampire Diaries: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

But the producers allowed anyone to jump in at any time, and a couple of them did, drowning out the others' responses frequently.

They seem to really like working together and get along well.
