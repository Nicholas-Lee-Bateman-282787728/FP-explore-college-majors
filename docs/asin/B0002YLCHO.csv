851809,A1JEE6BMU0F6D8,B0002YLCHO,"Amazon Customer ""Savanah""","[1, 1]","I truly expected a better effort from Disney. I am a huge Disney fan myself, my children love Disney films so we want to see that ""magic"" that makes their products famous.The DVD has three stories. The first is more of an old Aladdin series tale than it is a princess tale. The story barely fits into the ""tales of friendship"" theme and quite frankly was a bit scary for little girls which is who Disney is trying to please anyway. Little spooky looking sprites that cause mischief and mayhem, fighting, chaos, and yelling that borders on swearing. The whole atmosphere is ridiculous and poorly animated to boot. I don't like the old Disney shows from the 90's but I also don't have anything against them. I just wish Disney had  remembered that these DVD's appeal to toddlers and little girls, NOT 13 year old's!!!!!!All of the above applies to the third tale of Ariel. Spooky, inappropriate and another story that didn't fit well into the aforementioned theme. I was also upset to find a story in which a maniacal Ursula uses Ariels' treasures to cause panic and mayhem and then assume the role of Queen in return for ending the spell. ONCE AGAIN....way too age inappropriate.The reason for the three stars is because my daughter (2) and my 4 year old son beg me to play the Snow White portion of the DVD! Many reviewers were disappointed to find that the Snow White tale wasn't a newly animated story, I was too, at first. In all honesty the clips, and the story book animation are all very charming and the DVD is interactive but also plays by itself if you leave it. My daughter has just enough time to stand up and run to the screen to point to the correct answer before the DVD continues on with the story. I would actually buy a DVD that had 3-4 storybook tales with minimal animation and sound storytelling narration and presentation. This portion was created directly for little girls which makes the other two upsetting and poor quality stories even more of a mystery. Rent this DVD for your little girl and play the Snow White story, I assure you she'll love it. I played this and the best clips of other Disney films for the girls at my son's birthday party two weeks ago and the whole party ended up sitting down and requesting us to ""do again, do again!""If you are looking for a great princess DVD purchase for your little princess I highly recommend the sing along DVD's within this princess series. Those won't fail your expectations and will keep your children entertained and happy.",3,Expected more effort from Disney,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,2501,"['truly', 'expected', 'better', 'effort', 'Disney', 'am', 'huge', 'Disney', 'fan', 'children', 'love', 'Disney', 'films', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'magic', 'products', 'famous.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'stories', 'first', 'more', 'old', 'Aladdin', 'series', 'tale', 'princess', 'tale', 'story', 'barely', 'tales', 'friendship', 'theme', 'quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'bit', 'scary', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'Disney', 'trying', 'please', 'anyway', 'Little', 'spooky', 'looking', 'sprites', 'cause', 'mischief', 'mayhem', 'fighting', 'chaos', 'yelling', 'borders', 'swearing', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'ridiculous', 'poorly', 'animated', 'boot', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'old', 'Disney', '90', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'just', 'wish', 'Disney', 'had', 'remembered', 'DVD', 'appeal', 'toddlers', 'little', 'girls', 'NOT', '13', 'year', 'old', 'above', 'applies', 'third', 'tale', 'Ariel', 'Spooky', 'inappropriate', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'theme', 'was', 'also', 'upset', 'find', 'story', 'maniacal', 'Ursula', 'Ariels', 'treasures', 'cause', 'panic', 'mayhem', 'then', 'assume', 'role', 'Queen', 'return', 'ending', 'spell', 'ONCE', 'AGAIN', '.way', 'too', 'age', 'inappropriate.The', 'reason', 'three', 'stars', 'daughter', '2', '4', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'beg', 'play', 'Snow', 'White', 'portion', 'DVD', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'were', 'disappointed', 'find', 'Snow', 'White', 'tale', 'was', ""n't"", 'newly', 'animated', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'first', 'honesty', 'clips', 'story', 'book', 'animation', 'are', 'very', 'charming', 'DVD', 'interactive', 'also', 'plays', 'leave', 'daughter', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'stand', 'up', 'run', 'screen', 'point', 'correct', 'answer', 'DVD', 'story', 'would', 'actually', 'buy', 'DVD', 'had', '3-4', 'storybook', 'tales', 'minimal', 'animation', 'sound', 'storytelling', 'narration', 'presentation', 'portion', 'was', 'created', 'directly', 'little', 'girls', 'other', 'two', 'upsetting', 'poor', 'quality', 'stories', 'even', 'more', 'mystery', 'Rent', 'DVD', 'little', 'girl', 'play', 'Snow', 'White', 'story', 'assure', ""'ll"", 'love', 'played', 'best', 'clips', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'girls', 'son', 'birthday', 'party', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'whole', 'party', 'ended', 'up', 'sitting', 'down', 'requesting', 'do', 'again', 'do', 'again', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'princess', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'little', 'princess', 'highly', 'recommend', 'sing', 'DVD', 'princess', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fail', 'expectations', 'will', 'keep', 'children', 'entertained', 'happy']","Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 2 - Tales of Friendship"

851815,A3A21QST6QZE1F,B0002YLCHO,"S. Gunderson ""gundy""","[1, 1]","As I stated in my review for the first volume of this series, maybe this isn't a 5-star production but it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve all the 1-star ratings that are on here and several reviews aren't even accurate descriptions of the product. Apparently people were expecting some big budget production on par with Disney's big screen counterparts and that's not the case, nor was it intended that way. This is a THEME DVD intended for CHILDREN focused on the importance of friendship, however I do feel it does a poor job in this regard. Many of those posting the negative reviews even admit that their children enjoy the stories. I also don't understand all the harsh comments regarding the quality. Some have pointed out that the two fully-animated stories are from TV shows and that's the kind of quality you get which isn't terrible. Disney has been reissuing TV episodes on DVD for years and still does. Again, this DVD features stories focused on a central theme targeted to elementary-aged children.The first ""chapter"" is fully animated and portrays how Jasmine and the gang overcome the bad behaviours of some mischievious sprites. Unfortunately, as others have correctly pointed out, Jasmine isn't really featured here and doesn't play a major role which is disappointing based on the series' princess theme. It is not scary or inappropriate as some have stated.The second chapter is presented in an anmimated read-along story book format but the words are not highlighted as they are spoken as in the first volume. Again, I don't see a major connection to the friendship theme here as it is mainly about Snow White making dinner for the dwarves. There are some interactive moments where you can use your remote to make a choice but the story will continue if you do nothing.The third story is fully animated and shows how Ariel stops the evil Sea Witch from destroying and/or taking over her father's kingdom. It starts out with Ariel and her friend Gabriella but then Gabriella is essentially non-existant and I saw very little ""friendship"" moments during the show. The Sea Witch does create some ""scary"" situations but nothing I would view as being traumatizing for young children.The bonus features include a music video, princess game and a craft activity.Bottom line is, yes the quality is mediocre though it is made for younger children so it was not made to be spectacular in the eyes of an adult film critic. The friendship theme is really lost here but the stories can still be entertaining for younger children. The first volume is definitely better but this Volume 2 isn't terrible either.",3,"Better than ""1 star""",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2611,"['stated', 'review', 'first', 'volume', 'series', 'maybe', ""n't"", '5-star', 'production', 'DEFINITELY', ""n't"", 'deserve', '1-star', 'ratings', 'are', 'here', 'several', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'accurate', 'descriptions', 'product', 'Apparently', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'par', 'Disney', 'big', 'screen', 'counterparts', 'not', 'case', 'was', 'intended', 'way', 'THEME', 'DVD', 'intended', 'CHILDREN', 'focused', 'importance', 'friendship', 'however', 'do', 'feel', 'poor', 'job', 'regard', 'Many', 'posting', 'negative', 'reviews', 'even', 'admit', 'children', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'harsh', 'comments', 'regarding', 'quality', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'two', 'fully-animated', 'stories', 'are', 'TV', 'shows', 'kind', 'quality', 'get', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'Disney', 'been', 'reissuing', 'TV', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'years', 'still', 'Again', 'DVD', 'stories', 'focused', 'central', 'theme', 'targeted', 'elementary-aged', 'children.The', 'first', 'chapter', 'fully', 'animated', 'how', 'Jasmine', 'gang', 'overcome', 'bad', 'behaviours', 'mischievious', 'sprites', 'Unfortunately', 'others', 'have', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'Jasmine', ""n't"", 'really', 'featured', 'here', ""n't"", 'play', 'major', 'role', 'disappointing', 'based', 'series', 'princess', 'theme', 'not', 'scary', 'inappropriate', 'have', 'stated.The', 'second', 'chapter', 'presented', 'anmimated', 'read-along', 'story', 'book', 'format', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'highlighted', 'are', 'spoken', 'first', 'volume', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'major', 'connection', 'friendship', 'theme', 'here', 'mainly', 'about', 'Snow', 'White', 'making', 'dinner', 'dwarves', 'are', 'interactive', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'use', 'remote', 'make', 'choice', 'story', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'nothing.The', 'third', 'story', 'fully', 'animated', 'how', 'Ariel', 'evil', 'Sea', 'Witch', 'destroying', 'and/or', 'taking', 'over', 'father', 'kingdom', 'out', 'Ariel', 'friend', 'Gabriella', 'then', 'Gabriella', 'essentially', 'non-existant', 'saw', 'very', 'little', 'friendship', 'moments', 'show', 'Sea', 'Witch', 'create', 'scary', 'situations', 'nothing', 'would', 'view', 'being', 'traumatizing', 'young', 'children.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'music', 'video', 'princess', 'game', 'craft', 'activity.Bottom', 'line', 'yes', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'made', 'younger', 'children', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'be', 'spectacular', 'eyes', 'adult', 'film', 'critic', 'friendship', 'theme', 'really', 'lost', 'here', 'stories', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'younger', 'children', 'first', 'volume', 'definitely', 'better', 'Volume', '2', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'either']","Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 2 - Tales of Friendship"
