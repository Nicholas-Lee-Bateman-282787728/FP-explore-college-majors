1288456,AE2WZJ5OQR52R,B002TMI2A2,A. Salazar,"[12, 14]","Similar to the 'Dark Knight' blu-ray, this is the version shown at IMax theaters.  This is on both the dvd and blu-ray from Wal-Mart.  In addition, it has a slightly different cover, with Bumblebee instead of Megatron.Keep in mind, that the whole movie is not ""big screen"", just the fight scene in the middle and end of the movie, the rest is standard 16:9.  It even boast's a few extra seconds of deleted scenes during these segment's as well.  I would recommend this version to people, especially if you got a really big screen tv, 55"" and bigger.  If you live in the states, pick this up at your local Wal-Mart, and if you got a blu-ray player, even better!!",5,Transformers 2 - Big Sreen Edition,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,661,"['Similar', ""'Dark"", 'Knight', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'shown', 'IMax', 'theaters', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'Wal-Mart', 'addition', 'slightly', 'different', 'cover', 'Bumblebee', 'instead', 'Megatron.Keep', 'mind', 'whole', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'just', 'fight', 'scene', 'middle', 'end', 'movie', 'rest', 'standard', '16:9', 'even', 'boast', 'few', 'extra', 'seconds', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'segment', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'version', 'people', 'especially', 'got', 'really', 'big', 'screen', 'tv', '55', 'bigger', 'live', 'states', 'pick', 'up', 'local', 'Wal-Mart', 'got', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'even', 'better']",Transformers 2: Revenge Of The Fallen Exclusive Big Screen IMAX Edition 2-Disc Special Collector's Edition Widescreen DVD Featuring The Biggest On-screen Picture Available

They comedy aspect of it is also very well timed and works well within the movie as well. All I have to say is watch out for &#34;The Twins&#34;. Enjoy the ride.

The package was not damaged in any way and the other 5 movies that came with them were all good. The snap holder that holds the discs in the case was completely broken and both discs were sliding in the case and getting all scratched up. I had to return them both for a refund.,5,"5 stars for the movie, zero stars for the delivery...",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,411,"['bad', 'feedback', 'delivery', 'bought', 'Transformers', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'were', 'damaged', 'package', 'was', 'not', 'damaged', 'way', 'other', '5', 'movies', 'came', 'were', 'good', 'snap', 'holder', 'discs', 'case', 'was', 'completely', 'broken', 'discs', 'were', 'sliding', 'case', 'getting', 'scratched', 'up', 'had', 'return', 'refund']",Transformers 2: Revenge Of The Fallen Exclusive Big Screen IMAX Edition 2-Disc Special Collector's Edition Widescreen DVD Featuring The Biggest On-screen Picture Available
