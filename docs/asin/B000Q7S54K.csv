1074471,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B000Q7S54K,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[2, 2]","VISIT TO A SMALL PLANET was a hit for Gore Vidal in the late 1950s, a satire on Cold War obsessions through the device of having an alien visiting the Earth from another planet.  In Norman Taurog's version the story has been coarsened into a vehicle for Jerry Lewis, who turns in a performance that can most charitably be described as irritating.  The basic framework of the play remains; but the political satire has been removed.  Now all we are left with are some fairly predictable points about sexual repression and fake morality in a Puritan world.  The lovers (Joan Blackman, Earl Holliman) elope in order to continue their love-affair, but (true to the spirit of the times) they have to get married at the same time. 'Living in sin,' is frowned upon.  Such constraints, both sexual and social, are precisely the kind of material Vidal so objected to in societies throughout his life.  John Williams turns up in the film as Kreton's - in in other words, cretin's - (Lewis's) control, living in outer space; he turns in a passable imitation of George Sanders.  However the film outstays its welcome, despite being only 80 minutes long.",2,Desperate Version of a Satiric Comedy,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1141,"['VISIT', 'TO', 'A', 'SMALL', 'PLANET', 'was', 'hit', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'late', '1950s', 'satire', 'Cold', 'War', 'obsessions', 'device', 'having', 'alien', 'visiting', 'Earth', 'planet', 'Norman', 'Taurog', 'version', 'story', 'been', 'coarsened', 'vehicle', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'who', 'performance', 'can', 'most', 'charitably', 'be', 'described', 'irritating', 'basic', 'framework', 'play', 'political', 'satire', 'been', 'removed', 'Now', 'are', 'left', 'are', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'points', 'sexual', 'repression', 'fake', 'morality', 'Puritan', 'world', 'lovers', 'Joan', 'Blackman', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'elope', 'order', 'continue', 'love-affair', 'true', 'spirit', 'times', 'have', 'get', 'married', 'same', 'time', ""'Living"", 'sin', 'frowned', 'Such', 'constraints', 'sexual', 'social', 'are', 'precisely', 'kind', 'material', 'Vidal', 'so', 'objected', 'societies', 'life', 'John', 'Williams', 'up', 'film', 'Kreton', 'other', 'words', 'cretin', 'Lewis', 'control', 'living', 'outer', 'space', 'passable', 'imitation', 'George', 'Sanders', 'However', 'film', 'welcome', 'being', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'long']",Visit To A Small Planet

1074473,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B000Q7S54K,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[6, 6]","Gore Vidal penned the story upon which this film is based.  Originally a satire on the Cold War, the film turns this story into more of a farce, much safer fare for Hollywood that didn't want to be seen as criticizing the government during the Cold War (shades of McCarthy still roamed the Hollywood Hills).  Still, this is a reasonably good comedy for the time period.  Jerry Lewis plays his favourite character - himself - as an alien schoolboy (Lewis' stock characters were usually much younger than he himself was) infatuated with the Earth.  However, not taking into account the time lapse caused by the speed of light, the images of Earth he has been seeing are of the Civil War; his space ship manages to arrive on Earth about a hundred years later.  He drops into a home in the South, where people are dressed for a costume party (complete with a Jefferson Davis).  Lewis' character, Kreton (cretan), combines his own ignorance with the ignorance of the humans he encounters - the difference, of course, is that Kreton doesn't have a particular political angle to support among the Earthlings, and therefore can approach things a bit more objectively, albeit (since this is Lewis) in a slapstick fashion.At first, the humans he encounter don't want to accept the reality of aliens; Kreton convinces them, but along the way some become fearful, and others become intrigued.  Character actor John Williams plays Devlin, the long-suffering teacher of Kreton, who allows his wayward pupil to try to get the 'Earth obsession' out of his system.  Earl Holliman and Joan Blackman play a couple trying to figure out their future; Gale Gordon (perhaps best known as one of the Mr. Wilsons in 'Dennis the Menace' or as Lucille Ball's boss, Mr. Mooney) plays the civil defense authority variously trying to figure out what to do and how to get proof to share of the alien.Does the alien mean well?  Are humans in fact always happy-go-lucky, planning costume balls and falling in love?  These are things the alien explores, with some unexpected results.Detail to note - many of the ways the spaceman manifests his powers include tugging the ear and twitching the nose, classic `Bewitched' moves, a show done about the same time.",4,Put out the Welcome mat...,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2224,"['Gore', 'Vidal', 'penned', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'Originally', 'satire', 'Cold', 'War', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'farce', 'much', 'safer', 'fare', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'seen', 'criticizing', 'government', 'Cold', 'War', 'shades', 'McCarthy', 'still', 'roamed', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'Still', 'reasonably', 'good', 'comedy', 'time', 'period', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'favourite', 'character', 'alien', 'schoolboy', 'Lewis', 'stock', 'characters', 'were', 'usually', 'much', 'younger', 'was', 'infatuated', 'Earth', 'However', 'not', 'taking', 'account', 'time', 'lapse', 'caused', 'speed', 'light', 'images', 'Earth', 'been', 'seeing', 'are', 'Civil', 'War', 'space', 'ship', 'arrive', 'Earth', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'home', 'South', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'dressed', 'costume', 'party', 'complete', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'Lewis', 'character', 'Kreton', 'cretan', 'own', 'ignorance', 'ignorance', 'humans', 'difference', 'course', 'Kreton', ""n't"", 'have', 'particular', 'political', 'angle', 'support', 'Earthlings', 'therefore', 'can', 'approach', 'things', 'bit', 'more', 'objectively', 'Lewis', 'slapstick', 'fashion.At', 'first', 'humans', 'encounter', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'accept', 'reality', 'aliens', 'Kreton', 'way', 'become', 'fearful', 'others', 'become', 'intrigued', 'Character', 'actor', 'John', 'Williams', 'Devlin', 'long-suffering', 'teacher', 'Kreton', 'who', 'wayward', 'pupil', 'try', 'get', ""'Earth"", 'obsession', 'system', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'Joan', 'Blackman', 'play', 'couple', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'future', 'Gale', 'Gordon', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Wilsons', ""'Dennis"", 'Menace', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Mooney', 'civil', 'defense', 'authority', 'variously', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'get', 'proof', 'share', 'alien.Does', 'alien', 'mean', 'well', 'Are', 'humans', 'fact', 'always', 'happy-go-lucky', 'planning', 'costume', 'balls', 'falling', 'love', 'are', 'things', 'alien', 'explores', 'unexpected', 'results.Detail', 'note', 'many', 'ways', 'spaceman', 'powers', 'include', 'tugging', 'ear', 'twitching', 'nose', 'classic', 'Bewitched', 'moves', 'show', 'done', 'same', 'time']",Visit To A Small Planet
