1670361,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00F3OLVWE,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","Obviously inspired by ""The Purge"" and 1967's ""Wait Until Dark"", ""Mischief Night"" combines a blind girl left alone in a large upper-class house with the not really explained ""Purge""-ish ""Mischief Night""; a sort of pseudo night of freedom for people to do halloweenish things like egging houses and letting out their immature tendencies; I think. Of course, somebody takes it too far and Emily (Noell Coet), the blind girl, ends up fighting for her life against the masked pansy. I mean seriously... a blind girl?! You're out to exercise your mischief night liberties and you have to pick on the poor girl who can't even see!!! This alone makes you anxious to see the assailant get his punk beat down. I was hoping for a weeping like a girly-man scene, but it didn't play out.Despite the obvious cowardice of the guy on the cover of the movie box, ""Mischief Night"" is actually a pretty good movie. It was better than I thought it would be and I had enough thoughts about it that I felt like writing this review.Noell Coet is a good actress and actually plays a really good blind girl. She only overplayed it a couple of times. She hasn't been blind her entire life and her navigation of the household that she's become familiar with is believable. I especially liked the moment where she was rattled, started to run and ran hard into a counter. It looked painful and it added to the intensity of the scene. Her emotions throughout the film were spot on and had me feeling her fear.The movie is also beautifully filmed and capably edited. Mr. Mischief night may have chosen the poor blind girl to pick on so that he could stand around and follow her through her house without her knowing. This is certainly a great gimmick and it is pulled off well., especially when Mr. Mischief Night poses as Emily's boyfriend for a brief moment.Much was done correctly with ""Mischief Night"" and I found the movie enjoyable for the most part, but the times that it ventures into eye-roll land spoil the party. When Emily finds a chainsaw in the garage attached to a tree-trimmer extender and decides to put it to use, it may have created the most horribly coincidental occurrence in movie cinema history. Fortunately the entire movie wasn't that way. Although the cut she received to her foot when stepping on a broken glass vase would have rendered her a lot less mobile than it did, but I think the creators were more concerned with showing a gnarly-cut in a horror movie than being realistic. Finally, the ending, while not as bad as the chainsaw extender scene, was one more giant eye-roller.""Mischief Night"" could have been so so so much better had the creators not tried to overdo it. Had they just kept things inside reality or logic, it may have even been a great independent horror movie. As is though, 1967's ""Wait Until Dark"" is a better film because they at least kept things real.Another ""Mischief Night"" came out in 2014 that looks eerily similar. Apparently they aren't connected, but I find that hard to believe. Mr. Mischief night on both dvd cases even look similar. The theme is similar. Possibly the director and writer of ""Mischief Night"" 2014 was involved in ""MN"" 2013 and didn't like the things that I pointed out. To each his own. ""The Purge"" wasn't that great of a movie, but I guess it does have the possibility of many story lines. Or does it?",3,COULD HAVE been a surprise hit,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,3353,"['Obviously', 'inspired', 'Purge', '1967', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'blind', 'girl', 'left', 'alone', 'large', 'upper-class', 'house', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'Purge', '-ish', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'sort', 'pseudo', 'night', 'freedom', 'people', 'do', 'halloweenish', 'things', 'egging', 'houses', 'letting', 'out', 'immature', 'tendencies', 'think', 'course', 'somebody', 'too', 'far', 'Emily', 'Noell', 'Coet', 'blind', 'girl', 'up', 'fighting', 'life', 'masked', 'pansy', 'mean', 'seriously', 'blind', 'girl', ""'re"", 'out', 'exercise', 'mischief', 'night', 'liberties', 'have', 'pick', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'alone', 'anxious', 'see', 'assailant', 'get', 'punk', 'beat', 'down', 'was', 'hoping', 'weeping', 'girly-man', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'out.Despite', 'obvious', 'cowardice', 'guy', 'cover', 'movie', 'box', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'enough', 'thoughts', 'felt', 'writing', 'review.Noell', 'Coet', 'good', 'actress', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'blind', 'girl', 'only', 'overplayed', 'couple', 'times', ""n't"", 'been', 'blind', 'entire', 'life', 'navigation', 'household', 'become', 'familiar', 'believable', 'especially', 'liked', 'moment', 'where', 'was', 'rattled', 'started', 'run', 'ran', 'hard', 'counter', 'looked', 'painful', 'added', 'intensity', 'scene', 'emotions', 'film', 'were', 'spot', 'had', 'feeling', 'fear.The', 'movie', 'also', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'capably', 'edited', 'Mr.', 'Mischief', 'night', 'may', 'have', 'chosen', 'poor', 'blind', 'girl', 'pick', 'so', 'could', 'stand', 'around', 'follow', 'house', 'knowing', 'certainly', 'great', 'gimmick', 'pulled', 'off', 'well.', 'especially', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'Emily', 'boyfriend', 'brief', 'moment.Much', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'found', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part', 'times', 'ventures', 'eye-roll', 'land', 'party', 'When', 'Emily', 'chainsaw', 'garage', 'attached', 'tree-trimmer', 'extender', 'put', 'use', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'most', 'horribly', 'coincidental', 'occurrence', 'movie', 'cinema', 'history', 'Fortunately', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'cut', 'received', 'foot', 'when', 'stepping', 'broken', 'glass', 'vase', 'would', 'have', 'rendered', 'lot', 'less', 'mobile', 'did', 'think', 'creators', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'showing', 'gnarly-cut', 'horror', 'movie', 'being', 'realistic', 'Finally', 'ending', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'chainsaw', 'extender', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'giant', 'eye-roller', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'creators', 'not', 'tried', 'overdo', 'Had', 'just', 'kept', 'things', 'reality', 'logic', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'great', 'independent', 'horror', 'movie', '1967', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'better', 'film', 'least', 'kept', 'things', 'real.Another', 'Mischief', 'Night', 'came', 'out', '2014', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Apparently', 'are', ""n't"", 'connected', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Mischief', 'night', 'dvd', 'cases', 'even', 'look', 'similar', 'theme', 'similar', 'Possibly', 'director', 'writer', 'Mischief', 'Night', '2014', 'was', 'involved', 'MN', '2013', 'did', ""n't"", 'things', 'pointed', 'out', 'own', 'Purge', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'guess', 'have', 'possibility', 'many', 'story', 'lines']",Mischief Night
1670362,A1MECEHZHFE5PT,B00F3OLVWE,"Dayna Newman ""Slasher Diva""","[7, 8]","Mischief Night is a good little thriller that plays out more like an R rated lifetime made for TV movie.The acting was above par and there were some chilling moments courtesy of a home invader in a raincoat and an effectively creepy mask,it has clever camera angles and great production value!The story was simple enough and adhered to most of the slasher cliche`s.In the beginning we are introduced to a couple (Charlie O`Connell) and (Erica Leehrson) Leerhson who is no stranger to the genre, being in such movies as Wrong Turn 2,The  Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and The Blair Witch Project 2 Gave it some horror cred. We watch as they try and fend off the attacker who writes Boo In blood before he attacks,after having his way with them the film cuts to ( Noel Coet`s) character Emily in her shrinks office where they are talking about the reason she is blind and how her sight could return at anytime.Emily`s dad played by (Daniel Hugh Kelly)is going on a date leaving Emily alone on Mischief night which is the night before Halloween and this is when the cat and mouse games begin during which Emily`s boyfriend and Aunt stop in with some dire consequences.The killer s effectively creepy and since he can see that Emily is blind he decades to  taunts her more than his usual victims.it`s an entertaining film that I would call slasher light because there are a few bloody moments but not enough to make it hard core.its definitely worth a rent.It was somewhat reminiscent of (Eyes of a Stranger)an 80`s slasher starring Lauren Tewes and Jennifer Jason Leigh.",4,BOO,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1568,"['Mischief', 'Night', 'good', 'little', 'thriller', 'out', 'more', 'R', 'rated', 'lifetime', 'made', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'par', 'were', 'chilling', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'home', 'invader', 'raincoat', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'mask', 'clever', 'camera', 'angles', 'great', 'production', 'value', 'story', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'adhered', 'most', 'slasher', 'cliche', 's.In', 'beginning', 'are', 'introduced', 'couple', 'Charlie', 'O', 'Connell', 'Erica', 'Leehrson', 'Leerhson', 'who', 'stranger', 'genre', 'being', 'such', 'movies', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '2', 'Gave', 'horror', 'cred', 'watch', 'try', 'fend', 'attacker', 'who', 'Boo', 'blood', 'having', 'way', 'film', 'cuts', 'Noel', 'Coet', 's', 'character', 'Emily', 'shrinks', 'office', 'where', 'are', 'talking', 'reason', 'blind', 'how', 'sight', 'could', 'return', 'anytime.Emily', 's', 'dad', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Hugh', 'Kelly', 'going', 'date', 'leaving', 'Emily', 'alone', 'Mischief', 'night', 'night', 'Halloween', 'when', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'begin', 'Emily', 's', 'boyfriend', 'Aunt', 'stop', 'dire', 'consequences.The', 'killer', 's', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'can', 'see', 'Emily', 'taunts', 'more', 'usual', 'victims.it', 's', 'entertaining', 'film', 'would', 'call', 'slasher', 'light', 'are', 'few', 'bloody', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'hard', 'core.its', 'definitely', 'rent.It', 'was', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', '80', 's', 'slasher', 'starring', 'Lauren', 'Tewes', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh']",Mischief Night
1670363,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00F3OLVWE,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 5]","Fact: the 1980&#8217;s were a tremendous boon for the home entertainment industry.  The explosion of VHS brought an incredible influx of properties to the marketplace, and, despite some of what you&#8217;ll read about many of these forgotten flicks of yesteryear, several of them were quite good.  It&#8217;s been said that the emergence of the digital recorder will inevitable produce the same boomtown today, though I&#8217;ve yet to see any clear signs that&#8217;ll happen.  Granted, it&#8217;s already happened (if not still happening) in the horror film industry, but that&#8217;s always been the case: any Tom, Dick, or Harry with a camera can slap together a slasher flick, although it&#8217;s rare to get a really good effort distinguishing itself from the pack.However, I&#8217;ve a suggestion for you: get out to the video store (assuming you still have one) and give MISCHIEF NIGHT a spin in the DVD player.  To my surprise, it&#8217;s a surprisingly entertaining old-school slasher flick that makes solid use of set, character, and script.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Em Walton (played by a wholesome Noell Coet) is still reeling from the aftermath of an automobile accident that, nine years previous, took the life of her mother.  In fact, Em is continuing to struggle with a form of psychosomatic blindness that even her psychiatrist (an interesting cameo by the always reliable Ally Walker).  Her father, David (Daniel Hugh Kelly), is also hoping to get on with his life; he&#8217;s finally dating again, but, like all doting fathers, he hates leaving his daughter at home alone &#8230; especially on Mischief Night &#8230; as that&#8217;s when the boys who will be boys playfully terrorize residents with all kinds of benign trickery.  But this Mischief Night is different, as it brings out an ax-wielding maniac who has his sights set on hurting Em!Truth be told, there&#8217;s probably very little in MISCHIEF NIGHT that you haven&#8217;t seen before.  It bears a lot of similarity to 1971&#8217;s SEE NO EVIL, starring a young Mia Farrow as a blind woman pursued by a homicidal maniac.  And there&#8217;s a trend in the home-based horror stories that started a few years back, of which you may&#8217;ve seen THE PURGE (2013) or even THE STRANGERS (2008).  MISCHIEF NIGHT is much the same, but it&#8217;s given a breath of fresh air with Coet&#8217;s believable performance as the blind (but spunky) damsel in distress.To his credit, writer/director Richard Schenkman brought a nice &#8216;workman&#8217; quality to both the script and the filming process.  Admittedly, these might be cookie cutter characters, but he gives Em just enough substance to make her seem like someone you could know (or would like to know), and he doesn&#8217;t short dear old dad David either.  They may not be fully three-dimensional, but each has an arc to the past that relates to their present (how they&#8217;re dealing with it, as well as how they confront the killers).  Also, I&#8217;d have to give kudos to the fact that despite being entirely shot within a single large house, Schenkman goes to honorable lengths to make use of every room, every nook, and every corridor; it&#8217;s rare to see a director wring that much effect out of simple real estate!Sometimes being in the middle of the road is a respectable place to be.  Rather than trying to the limelight, MISCHIEF NIGHT is exactly the kind of direct-to-DVD release (it may&#8217;ve had a token release, but I couldn&#8217;t find any info online to substantiate it) that made the 1980&#8217;s such a great decade for home entertainment.  It establishes a relatively slim premise very quickly, and it delivers on it; when it comes to slasher flicks, who could ask for anything more?MISCHIEF NIGHT (2013) is produced by Mischief Night and Ruthless Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds very solid consistently (there was only a single sequence that I backed up as I wanted to clearly hear some rather muddled dialogue).  As for the special features, there&#8217;s a nice (although brief) behind-the-scenes short (it&#8217;s all a bit obligatory), if that sort of thing interests you.  Otherwise, that&#8217;s all there is, none too surprising.RECOMMENDED.  Look, if slasher films are your thing, then you could do an awful lot worse than the technically proficient MISCHIEF NIGHT.  Sure, I have some quibbles with characterization (I tend to like mine a bit more fully fleshed out), and I could pick at the bones of the routineness of it all (it&#8217;s relatively predictable) &#8230; but I&#8217;d also have to be honest in admitting that it kept my interest from the start to the finish.  That could be because I thought Noell Coet&#8217;s performance was quite good as the kinda/sorta blind girl who finds herself using what smarts she can muster against some masked evildoers.  And I&#8217;ve always rooted for Daniel Hugh Kelly, who deserves to get more work; he does a nice turn here as the father who&#8217;s only looking out for his little girl.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Image Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of MISCHIEF NIGHT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Predictable

There are many plot holes in this story and some will smack you in the face they are so obvious.If they would have spent some time at the table discussing various possible scenarios during the home invasion they could have filtered out many if not all the serious flaws that made it past the edit room. I will give a few examples for you to compare. The girls phone (where she kept it, its 911 activation or lack there of, when it was and wasn't used)??? The dad and his actions regarding his daughter??? Last but certainly not least was the saw??? Hence my title and shall we say what did I hear coming from that unplugged electric saw???When you are under extreme duress you will do some pretty silly/dumb things, but here it was over the top and over played.This movie was still fun to watch even with its flaws because otherwise it was a very well produced and acted movie that actually had some likable characters in it. Was it graphic? No not at all nor was it filled with foul language, sex, nudity or drugs. The violence was also held to a minimum, so this is one the whole family can watch if they are in their early teens or younger if the parents think its ok. 3 stars for production values.",3,"""WHAT JUST A MINUTE, DID YOU JUST DO WHAT I THINK YOU DID""?",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1636,"['Mischief', 'Night', 'quality', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'story', ""n't"", 'new', 'twist', 'head', 'surprise', 'twists', 'turns', 'corner.It', 'effective', 'building', 'fear', 'sense', 'apprehension', 'here', 'there', 'problem', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'scenario', 'know', 'whats', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'girl', 'dad', 'bad', 'guy', 'real', 'payoff', 'viewer', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'will', 'smack', 'face', 'are', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'table', 'discussing', 'various', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'home', 'invasion', 'could', 'have', 'filtered', 'out', 'many', 'not', 'serious', 'flaws', 'made', 'edit', 'room', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'examples', 'compare', 'girls', 'phone', 'where', 'kept', '911', 'activation', 'lack', 'there', 'when', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'dad', 'actions', 'regarding', 'daughter', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'saw', 'Hence', 'title', 'shall', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'hear', 'coming', 'unplugged', 'electric', 'saw', 'When', 'are', 'extreme', 'duress', 'will', 'do', 'pretty', 'silly/dumb', 'things', 'here', 'was', 'top', 'played.This', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'flaws', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'acted', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'likable', 'characters', 'Was', 'graphic', 'No', 'not', 'was', 'filled', 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'violence', 'was', 'also', 'held', 'minimum', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'are', 'early', 'teens', 'younger', 'parents', 'think', 'ok.', '3', 'stars', 'production', 'values']",Mischief Night

1670369,A1N3ICO0066BS6,B00F3OLVWE,"Utterly Undead Reads (and sometimes more) ""Re...","[0, 0]","Discounting the couple in the opening scene, this 80-some-odd minute movie takes (literally) 40 minutes to really start picking up steam. It's all backstory and character building, but we get it all ready- the main character is blind and insists on being independent. She does a pretty good job of it, too, with some minor struggles. It could have all been conveyed and explained in half the time or less.But once it gets going (finally), it's pretty good. Some things are bit predictable, but the slasher-stalking-blind-girl twist is something new to me. I didn't know how I'd feel about that, when we, the audience, can SEE the threat but she can't. It worked, in general, and much to my surprise. One part in particular was applause-worthy for shock value and creativity.The lead in this movie is phenomenal. She exceeded my expectations.There are the expected blood and violence in this movie, of course, but it's not over-the-top. This one does not try to hide behind shocking violence and excessive gore to carry it.I would have enjoyed a little more as to the 'why' besides 'It's Mischief Night', especially when the slasher apparently has taken to attacking the same house at least two years in a row. Really? Kind of lame, especially when there's no explanation offered.A decent movie IF you have the patience to get past the lengthy set-up in the first half of the movie. And, of course, it never hurts when Richard Riehle (a.k.a 'Tom' in Office Space, the 'Jump to Conclusions' matt guy) shows up for a moment or two.

There is not much blood, but the movie would be scarey enough to give children nightmares, The nasty psycho was a very very menacing freak.  Good acting, good script.  There were a couple of errors, like the cell phone not having a panic button to call 911, or staying in areas of the house instead of just flat out leaving.  They were very light flaws and not to noticeable, just a little irritating.
