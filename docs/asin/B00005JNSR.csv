It turned out to be an excellent movie!It is very well-done...Depp's acting and directing is remarkable.  This is an extremely emotional movie, and I'm betting that Raphael's life is a parallel of Johnny Depp's life.Raphael (Depp) and his family are exceedingly poor.  This is a huge obstacle since Raphael would do absolutely anything for his family...even die.  In the beginning, he finds a snuff film maker (Marlon Brando).  For those who don't know, a snuff film is a film in which an actual murder is filmed for entertainment in a movie.  Anyway, Raphael agrees to do it.  He has one week before he is scheduled to die, but he will be paid $50,000.  From this point on, many things happen.  He builds a junkyard fair for his two children.  He re-falls in love with his wife and kids.  People are suspicious of his sudden large income.  His home will be destroyed.  Threats, murder, jealousy, and every emotion possible...all in the last 7 days of his life.  And it is all for his love for his family.It really is a beautiful story.  Sad, but beautiful.  Yes, perhaps it is a bit crazy to commit suicide just so your family can have money, but that's what love does to you.  It makes you crazy. The only reason I gave it 4(1/2) instead of 5 stars is because the beginning was a little slow.  Also, there is a lot of blood and the F word, but then again it is rated R.  Besides that, I would say Depp's movie is a huge success.  I guarantee that anyone who watches this will be moved.",4,"A moving, brave story",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,1624,"['Well', 'got', 'DVD', 'ebay', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'work', 'DVD', 'players', 'did', 'watch', 'computer', 'however', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'excellent', 'movie', 'very', 'well-done', 'Depp', 'acting', 'directing', 'remarkable', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'movie', ""'m"", 'betting', 'Raphael', 'life', 'parallel', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'life.Raphael', 'Depp', 'family', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'poor', 'huge', 'obstacle', 'Raphael', 'would', 'do', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'family', 'even', 'die', 'beginning', 'snuff', 'film', 'maker', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'snuff', 'film', 'film', 'actual', 'murder', 'filmed', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'Raphael', 'do', 'one', 'week', 'scheduled', 'die', 'will', 'be', 'paid', '50,000', 'point', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'junkyard', 'fair', 'two', 'children', 'love', 'wife', 'kids', 'People', 'are', 'suspicious', 'sudden', 'large', 'income', 'home', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Threats', 'murder', 'jealousy', 'emotion', 'possible', 'last', '7', 'days', 'life', 'love', 'family.It', 'really', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Sad', 'beautiful', 'Yes', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'crazy', 'commit', 'suicide', 'just', 'so', 'family', 'can', 'have', 'money', 'what', 'love', 'crazy', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '4', '1/2', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'beginning', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'Also', 'lot', 'blood', 'F', 'word', 'then', 'again', 'rated', 'R.', 'Besides', 'would', 'say', 'Depp', 'movie', 'huge', 'success', 'guarantee', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'moved']",The Brave

One day this wallpaper decides it's not good enough for the house anymore and gets in touch with an interior decorator, played by Marlon Brando in a convincing turn as Jabba the Hut sans special effects, who eventually sets this strip of wallpaper on fire in a fit of sadistic glee. But you literally have to watch the wallpaper glue dry for an hour or so before you go from the old batch to the new batch.

This movie was filmed in 1997 and it marked Johnny Depp's directing debut which I believe he did a terrific job being his first time behind the camera. He also co-wrote the script with his brother.This is a great film ( a little too slow perhaps at times) but nevertheless a very good movie. Johnny plays Raphael, a man with a wife and family to support in desperate need of a job. He has lost all hope and agrees to participate in a snuff film trading his life for a large sum of money so that his wife and two kids can lead a decent life. He strikes a deal with Marlon Brando (in a very small role) and has one week to live and spent every time possible with his family before he is to go back and participate in this horrible act that will eventually cause his demise.The more pain he is able to withstand the more money his family will receive. I don't want to continue talking it about it because I would like for all of you to see it and decide for yourself if Rapahel did the right thing or not. He did it all for the love of his family and so that they live a better life since he was never able to give them much of anything.The movie is somewhat dark and sad (obviously) and although I don't think this movie would do too well if it were to be release in theaters not because is not good but is kind of a depressing movie and it would not hold the interest of too many people I believe. Still I gave the movie five stars because I believe that Johnny Depp as well as the rest of the cast did a fantastic Job. Johnny especially was wonderful and managed to successfully pull off a great character study of a man on the brink of desperation only to save his family from leading a rather meaningless life without the hope of a brighter future.Hopefully it won't be too long before this movie is release on DVD so that many people and all of the Depp fans which they are many can see this incredible movie. It is a movie not to be missed and Johnny Depp proves once again his incredible talent as an actor as well as a first time writer/director. When the movie is finally release on DVD get it right away you will like it a lot I think.

I live near where the movie was filmed, and recognized some of the background shots, including the four-horse merry-go-round made from metal barrels.

Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.Raphael (Johny Depp) is a recently out of jail American Indian. Unemployed, he lives with his wife Rita (Elpidia Carrillo) and two young children in a dirt poor small community near a rubbish dump. As most of people (mostly Indians) living there, he earns his - very miserable - living by scavenging through the dump and selling whatever he can find. Ashamed by his inability to correctly take care of his family and deeply humiliated by his situation, Raphael is a greatly desperate man and therefore also an easy target.Indeed one day a strange and very unpleasant man named Larry (Marshall Bell) contacts him and brings him to a sinister place, where awaits an even stranger and scarier character, a certain McCarthy (Marlon Brando). This man will make Raphael an unusual, shocking and completely illegal offer - maybe not exactly an offer he cannot refuse, but certainly one that can not be accepted easily... In fact, McCarthy, who is a quasi-luciferian figure, offers him a quasi-faustian deal... And then the film really begins.Adapted remotely from a novel published in 1991 by American mystery writer Gregory MacDonald, this is a very good film, but it is also one of the most deeply disturbing, shocking, bleak and dark things I ever saw! Honestly, it is one the same level of shocking as ""Seven""!Johny Depp, who never directed anything before or since, proved here that he definitely CAN make a film, not only star in it. He wanted to make a film about the bleakest misery, the deepest despair and the most abject depravation - and he succeeded so well, that when watching this film I almost could smell the rot, decay and corruption which gnaws at people's bodies and souls...Surprisingly, American critics destroyed this film so comprehensively that it was impossible to find a distributor who would release it in USA - and in Old Europe the reception was hardly better. I cannot really comprehend this...I will keep this review short to avoid any temptation of giving more spoilers, because this thing deserves to be discovered entirely by yourself.I canot say that I liked this thing and you will certainly not enjoy it (if you do, go urgently see a doctor!) but it is nevertheless a GREAT AND UNIQUE FILM, very much worth discovering. It's just that after watching it you will probably need to go hug somebody - or have a solid shot of vodka - and maybe also take a long, long hot shower...",5,"""I guess we will see you in the movies, Tonto""",1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2587,"['only', 'film', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'wrote', 'directed', 'very', 'VERY', 'good', 'albeit', 'incredibly', 'shocking', 'terminally', 'DARK', 'opus', 'more', 'impressions', 'very', 'limited', 'SPOILERS.Raphael', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'recently', 'jail', 'American', 'Indian', 'Unemployed', 'wife', 'Rita', 'Elpidia', 'Carrillo', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'dirt', 'poor', 'small', 'community', 'rubbish', 'dump', 'most', 'people', 'mostly', 'Indians', 'living', 'there', 'very', 'miserable', 'living', 'scavenging', 'dump', 'selling', 'whatever', 'can', 'find', 'Ashamed', 'inability', 'correctly', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'deeply', 'humiliated', 'situation', 'Raphael', 'greatly', 'desperate', 'man', 'therefore', 'also', 'easy', 'target.Indeed', 'one', 'day', 'strange', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'man', 'named', 'Larry', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'sinister', 'place', 'where', 'even', 'stranger', 'scarier', 'character', 'certain', 'McCarthy', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'man', 'will', 'make', 'Raphael', 'unusual', 'shocking', 'completely', 'illegal', 'offer', 'maybe', 'not', 'exactly', 'offer', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'certainly', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'easily', 'fact', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'quasi-luciferian', 'figure', 'quasi-faustian', 'deal', 'then', 'film', 'really', 'begins.Adapted', 'remotely', 'novel', 'published', '1991', 'American', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Gregory', 'MacDonald', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'shocking', 'bleak', 'dark', 'things', 'ever', 'saw', 'Honestly', 'one', 'same', 'level', 'shocking', 'Seven', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'who', 'never', 'directed', 'anything', 'proved', 'here', 'definitely', 'CAN', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'bleakest', 'misery', 'deepest', 'despair', 'most', 'abject', 'depravation', 'succeeded', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'almost', 'could', 'smell', 'rot', 'decay', 'corruption', 'people', 'bodies', 'souls', 'Surprisingly', 'American', 'critics', 'destroyed', 'film', 'so', 'comprehensively', 'was', 'impossible', 'find', 'distributor', 'who', 'would', 'release', 'USA', 'Old', 'Europe', 'reception', 'was', 'hardly', 'better', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'comprehend', 'will', 'keep', 'review', 'short', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'giving', 'more', 'spoilers', 'thing', 'be', 'discovered', 'entirely', 'yourself.I', 'canot', 'say', 'liked', 'thing', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'enjoy', 'do', 'go', 'urgently', 'see', 'doctor', 'nevertheless', 'GREAT', 'AND', 'UNIQUE', 'FILM', 'very', 'much', 'discovering', 'just', 'watching', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'go', 'hug', 'somebody', 'have', 'solid', 'shot', 'vodka', 'maybe', 'also', 'take', 'long', 'long', 'hot', 'shower']",The Brave

634808,A2YX9VMOSROGOZ,B00005JNSR,RM,"[15, 16]","The story revolves around a Native American Indian (Depp), who lives in poverty with his family and other Native American families in a scrapyard, miles away from the nearest town. The area may be Arizona or New Mexico, judging by the fact that many Native Americans listen to Spanish music, radio, tv, etc. He decides to be tortured to death in a ""snuff"" film and in return, his family will get $50,000 and will be able to live a better life. In the last 7 days he has to live, he spends as much time with his family as he can. In those 7 days, we chart Johnny's activities, his relationship with his wife and kids, with his friends, a couple of unfortunate encounters with the man who will torture him and his visit to the local church. I know, it may not sound very interesting but this film needs to be watched uninterrupted, with the right frame of mind and you need to have a good attention span. If you can appreciate fine acting and a film which elicits a very strong emotional response, then this would be the ideal film for you. I believe that it's the American public's loss that this film is not available on Reg 1.What can I say about this film other than it's a masterpiece? The acting is so intense and the characters so believeable and completely in despair, that you genuinely feel heart-broken for them. I especially loved the first 5-10 minutes of the film, with beautiful music but no actual dialogue. For example, Johnny Depp is looking at his son in bed and his son is looking right back at him. It is such a powerful moment where not a single solitary word is uttered but it's almost as if they are communicating with one another telepathically.It's as if both of them have a moment of clarity and just know that something awful is going to happen to their family. This film is about relationships, belief and sacrifice. It's certainly not a film for the mainstream audiences. So, if you are looking for action, explosions, car chases, plenty of swearing, gore, scares, etc you'll be disappointed and I suggest you look elsewhere. This film is a slow-paced drama which explores the concepts of marriage and, more importantly, life and death.",5,This film made me weep like a little kid,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2164,"['story', 'around', 'Native', 'American', 'Indian', 'Depp', 'who', 'poverty', 'family', 'other', 'Native', 'American', 'families', 'scrapyard', 'miles', 'away', 'nearest', 'town', 'area', 'may', 'be', 'Arizona', 'New', 'Mexico', 'judging', 'fact', 'many', 'Native', 'Americans', 'listen', 'Spanish', 'music', 'radio', 'tv', 'etc', 'be', 'tortured', 'death', 'snuff', 'film', 'return', 'family', 'will', 'get', '50,000', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'better', 'life', 'last', '7', 'days', 'live', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'family', 'can', '7', 'days', 'chart', 'Johnny', 'activities', 'relationship', 'wife', 'kids', 'friends', 'couple', 'unfortunate', 'encounters', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'torture', 'visit', 'local', 'church', 'know', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'uninterrupted', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'need', 'have', 'good', 'attention', 'span', 'can', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'acting', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'emotional', 'response', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'film', 'believe', 'American', 'public', 'loss', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'Reg', '1.What', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'other', 'masterpiece', 'acting', 'so', 'intense', 'characters', 'so', 'believeable', 'completely', 'despair', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'heart-broken', 'especially', 'loved', 'first', '5-10', 'minutes', 'film', 'beautiful', 'music', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'example', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'looking', 'son', 'bed', 'son', 'looking', 'right', 'back', 'such', 'powerful', 'moment', 'where', 'not', 'single', 'solitary', 'word', 'uttered', 'almost', 'are', 'communicating', 'one', 'telepathically.It', 'have', 'moment', 'clarity', 'just', 'know', 'something', 'awful', 'going', 'happen', 'family', 'film', 'relationships', 'belief', 'sacrifice', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'plenty', 'swearing', 'gore', 'scares', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'slow-paced', 'drama', 'concepts', 'marriage', 'more', 'importantly', 'life', 'death']",The Brave
