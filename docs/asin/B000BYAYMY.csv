953088,A387BD735MI50R,B000BYAYMY,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.",5,A Compelling Documentary About America's Worst Ax-Murder,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2872,"['not', 'sensational', 'account', 'ax-murder', 'eight', 'innocent', 'people', 'town', 'Villisca', 'Iowa', '1912', 'are', 'looking', 'lurid', 'graphics', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'story', 'typical', 'turn-of-the-century', 'rural', 'town.Villisca', 'was', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Town', 'place', 'one', 'gentle', 'clickety-clack', 'time', 'got', 'derailed', 'bizarre', 'murder', 'town', 'railroad', 'comfortingly', 'scheduled', 'passings', 'indeed', 'set', 'tone', 'sober', 'account', 'However', 'train', 'might', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'instrumental', 'delivering', 'killer', 'Moores', 'doorstep', 'one', 'dark', 'night.It', 'strange', 'how', 'murders', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'ax-murders', 'remain', 'collective', 'memory', 'even', 'become', 'part', 'vernacular', 'common', 'pool', 'referenced', 'happenings', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'mysterious', 'murders', 'such', 'one', 'are', 'forgotten', 'everyone', 'local', 'people', 'film', 'commentators', 'speculate', 'such', 'disparities', 'sustained', 'interest', 'documentary', 'tragedy', 'Villisca', 'shadows', 'context', 'town', 'larger', 'life.A', 'number', 'Villisca', 'locals', 'children', 'time', 'murders', 'appear', 'documentary', 'filmed', '1990', 'early', '2000', 'elders', 'give', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'days', 'preceding', 'murders', 'whirlwind', 'days', 'followed', 'talk', 'heightened', 'suspicion', 'prejudice', 'infected', 'town', 'reinforcing', 'laws', 'members', 'minority', 'groups', 'being', 'allowed', 'stay', 'there', 'overnight', 'talk', 'sequence', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'suspected', 'crime.The', 'killings', 'had', 'distinctive', 'ritualistic', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'town', 'primary', 'suspicions', 'might', 'seem', 'ludicrously', 'misguided', 'today', ""'ve"", 'been', 'well-informed', 'CSI', 'shows', 'likely', 'psychological', 'profile', 'such', 'killer', 'profile', 'hardly', 'fit', 'man', 'whom', 'town', 'settled', 'conviction', 'guilt', 'while', 'also', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'similar', 'killings', 'other', 'towns', 'eventually', 'came', 'be', 'deemed', 'irrelevant', 'Villisca', 'case', 'However', 'elders', 'who', 'appear', 'here', 'tell', 'business', 'rivalries', 'illicit', 'romances', 'were', 'tacit', 'common', 'knowledge', '1912', 'Villisca', 'then', 'got', 'out', 'clothes', 'lines', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'obvious', 'motives', 'murder', 'fact.These', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'accounts', 'researchers', 'are', 'generously', 'interspersed', 'sepia', 'photographs', '1912', 'time', 'place', 'Villisca', 'reminiscent', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'two', 'excellent', 'commentaries', 'commentary', 'local', 'researcher-historian', 'Edgar', 'Epperly', 'especially', 'literate', 'evocative', 'accompaniment', 'crime', 'once', 'so', 'far-removed', 'yet', 'so', 'affecting', 'intelligent', 'absorbing', 'film', 'levels']",Villisca

953092,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B000BYAYMY,TawnTawn,"[0, 0]","Background of the town Villisca throughout the years interspersed with bits about the axe murder. When they came back to talking about the murder I had some trouble remembering who was who back in 1912. No concrete example was given as to why the Reverend George Kelly was referred to as nuts, crazy, mentally ill and mentally unstable (merely because he wanted kids out of the house because he wanted to ""walk the floor?"").  Later in the film info is given that he was a Peeping Tom, but that doesn't necessarily mean a person is crazy.  That the authorities believed him when he said he had worked for Scotland Yard and let him in the house just showed that they were not terribly bright. There also really wasn't any proof of Albert Jones being stupid, except that his wife cheated on him, although later love letters from another woman to Albert Jones were found by a woman (this was talked about in one of the extra chapters) and ""Bob"" (whoever that was) told her to burn them, so she of course she did what Bob told her to do. People of Villisca did not care to have their town talked about for the murder...probably because of how some of the townspeople reacted after the murder. Many were nosy, some were opportunistic, some were liars, and some were trying to make trouble for others in order to profit for themselves. Current day Villisca: they wear HUGE pink pig face hats and march in a parade.I thought it was interesting that according to a lady who lived in the house (as a child) 24 years after the murder, the bloodstains were still on the wallpaper.I could not see why anyone in the town, including the ""crazy"" minister, would have a motive to kill six children and two adults.  Probably the filmmakers (or whoever decided this) are correct in their supposition of who committed the murder. I take with a grain of salt that everyone locked their front door, but of course not the back door. That didn't make much sense.",3,Good Effort,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,1938,"['Background', 'town', 'Villisca', 'years', 'interspersed', 'bits', 'axe', 'murder', 'When', 'came', 'back', 'talking', 'murder', 'had', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'back', '1912', 'concrete', 'example', 'was', 'given', 'why', 'Reverend', 'George', 'Kelly', 'was', 'referred', 'nuts', 'crazy', 'mentally', 'ill', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'merely', 'wanted', 'kids', 'house', 'wanted', 'walk', 'floor', 'Later', 'film', 'info', 'given', 'was', 'Peeping', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'person', 'crazy', 'authorities', 'believed', 'when', 'said', 'had', 'worked', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'let', 'house', 'just', 'showed', 'were', 'not', 'terribly', 'bright', 'also', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'proof', 'Albert', 'Jones', 'being', 'stupid', 'wife', 'cheated', 'later', 'love', 'letters', 'woman', 'Albert', 'Jones', 'were', 'found', 'woman', 'was', 'talked', 'one', 'extra', 'chapters', 'Bob', 'was', 'told', 'burn', 'course', 'did', 'what', 'Bob', 'told', 'do', 'People', 'Villisca', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'town', 'talked', 'murder', 'probably', 'how', 'townspeople', 'reacted', 'murder', 'Many', 'were', 'nosy', 'were', 'opportunistic', 'were', 'liars', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'trouble', 'others', 'order', 'profit', 'Current', 'day', 'Villisca', 'wear', 'HUGE', 'pink', 'pig', 'face', 'hats', 'march', 'parade.I', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'according', 'lady', 'who', 'lived', 'house', 'child', '24', 'years', 'murder', 'bloodstains', 'were', 'still', 'wallpaper.I', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'town', 'including', 'crazy', 'minister', 'would', 'have', 'motive', 'kill', 'six', 'children', 'two', 'adults', 'Probably', 'filmmakers', 'whoever', 'decided', 'are', 'correct', 'supposition', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'everyone', 'locked', 'front', 'door', 'course', 'not', 'back', 'door', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense']",Villisca
