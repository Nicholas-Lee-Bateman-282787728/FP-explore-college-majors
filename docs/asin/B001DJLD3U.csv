1182002,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B001DJLD3U,Adam,"[0, 0]","The story of the Doctor on a quest to find the Infinite, a space ship from the Dark times that promises to grant people their heart's desire is intriguing, if a bit of a departure from typical New Who stories. In some ways, this felt like a classic adventure that involved hopping times and places for solutions.While I understand this was originally created as a web series, I think Infinite Quest's biggest fault is that it's just not developed enough. It goes too fast leading to quick fix solutions and lack of development in understandng problems. This was a fun production, but I can't help feel it would have been more enjoyable at 90 minutes than it was at 45.",3,Doctor Who: The Animated Story,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,668,"['story', 'Doctor', 'quest', 'find', 'Infinite', 'space', 'ship', 'Dark', 'times', 'grant', 'people', 'heart', 'desire', 'intriguing', 'bit', 'departure', 'typical', 'New', 'Who', 'ways', 'felt', 'classic', 'adventure', 'involved', 'hopping', 'times', 'places', 'solutions.While', 'understand', 'was', 'originally', 'created', 'web', 'series', 'think', 'Infinite', 'Quest', 'biggest', 'fault', 'just', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'too', 'fast', 'leading', 'quick', 'fix', 'solutions', 'lack', 'development', 'understandng', 'problems', 'was', 'fun', 'production', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', '90', 'minutes', 'was', '45']",Doctor Who: The Infinite Quest

It was a nice story with a great cast (Anthony Head, Giles of Buffy fame who has done several episodes of the new Who series as the villain). The animation was top notch. They matched the opening of the show beautifully. I would love to see a full episode animated for the adult set, although this did touch upon the unrequited love of Martha for the Doctor briefly at the end. It was better than I thought it would be. There are many extras on the disc including animation trials and behind the scenes interviews and voice over recordings with the actors (which I love). The Dr. Who staff really does a great job of giving fans behind the scenes info that we just love. It also showcases just how great David Tennant is with voice work. I miss him greatly in the new series. I think it is a great edition to the Who collection and I hope they do more of this type of show, but lean towards the adults more.",4,Animated Episode of Dr. Who for the Younger Set,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,940,"['enjoyed', 'animated', 'feature', 'was', 'nice', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'fame', 'who', 'done', 'several', 'episodes', 'new', 'Who', 'series', 'villain', 'animation', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'matched', 'opening', 'show', 'beautifully', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'full', 'episode', 'animated', 'adult', 'set', 'did', 'touch', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Martha', 'Doctor', 'briefly', 'end', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'disc', 'including', 'animation', 'trials', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'voice', 'recordings', 'actors', 'love', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'staff', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'fans', 'scenes', 'info', 'just', 'love', 'also', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'David', 'Tennant', 'voice', 'work', 'miss', 'greatly', 'new', 'series', 'think', 'great', 'edition', 'Who', 'collection', 'hope', 'do', 'more', 'type', 'show', 'lean', 'towards', 'adults', 'more']",Doctor Who: The Infinite Quest

Gammill,"[22, 22]","As an American fan of Doctor Who, I knew nothing about this animated version until this DVD was released in the U.S.  But I was intrigued by the very idea of an animated Doctor Who, and it's VERY inexpensive compared to the full-season sets, so I decided to give it a try.As others have said, the overall feel of the show is that it is aimed at younger viewers (ironically, the BBC apparently considers the live-action WHO a kid's program, and everyone I know who watches it is over 30).  The plot reminded me a bit of watching the old Space Ghost cartoons from the 60's.While the characters and background are beautifully rendered, the animation is a bit limited.  This is apparently the new accepted style for many animated series, but it takes some getting used to if you're a fan of classic cartoons.And while the voice acting does appear lackluster at times, I thought Anthony Head (who also appears in the 2nd season episode ""School Reunion"") does a fine job as the villain.Extras include brief behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the program.  While it's good to see David Tennant and the others working outside their normal venues, most folks will probably watch the bonus features once and never again.Overall, The Infinite Quest is a mixed bag.

1182008,A38JR7ANL46IYW,B001DJLD3U,Doctor Gangreene,"[0, 0]","This isn't my favorite installment in the Doctor Who-niverse.  The animation isn't &#34;all that and a bag of ju-ju-bees&#34;  but I've seen worse.  I think the premise for the story is pretty good here.  Possibly the beginnings of one of the best Doctor Who tales ever.  I just think it should have been expanded into a longer format; maybe like they used to do with the William Hartnell & John Pertwee shows where they'd have one adventure span three or four full episodes.  The story they started here really deserved a little more exploration and there were too many characters introduced whom NOBODY was meant to care about at all.  The whole thing goes something like this:&#34;Hello, I'm the Doctor and this is Martha Jones, and we're on a quest.&#34;&#34;Hello Doctor.  I'm an ex-convict and I have the thing you need.  Prepare to die.&#34;&#34;Run, Martha!&#34;(Off-screen violence ensues)&#34;Oh no, look, Martha... the ex-con has been disintegrated.  Oh well, at least now we can get the thing we need.&#34;And repeat that four times.Also, it's incredibly corny.  Think Doctor Who meets SpongeBob Squarepants.  This one is obviously designed for a younger audience than the usual Doctor Who adventures.  So overall, it looks like they were off to a good start in the plot department but it really fell apart after the first day of work.  If they re-made this story in the style of the full-length TV show or maybe a movie, with a slightly older target audience and a proper devotion to plot and character development, then I might watch that.",2,This one really should have been better than it is.,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,1553,"[""n't"", 'favorite', 'installment', 'Doctor', 'Who-niverse', 'animation', ""n't"", '34', 'bag', 'ju-ju-bees', '34', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'think', 'premise', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'Possibly', 'beginnings', 'one', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'ever', 'just', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'longer', 'format', 'maybe', 'used', 'do', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'John', 'Pertwee', 'where', ""'d"", 'have', 'one', 'adventure', 'three', 'four', 'full', 'episodes', 'story', 'started', 'here', 'really', 'deserved', 'little', 'more', 'exploration', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'introduced', 'whom', 'NOBODY', 'was', 'meant', 'care', 'whole', 'thing', 'something', '34', 'Hello', ""'m"", 'Doctor', 'Martha', 'Jones', ""'re"", 'quest.', '34', '34', 'Hello', 'Doctor', ""'m"", 'ex-convict', 'have', 'thing', 'need', 'Prepare', 'die.', '34', '34', 'Run', 'Martha', '34', 'Off-screen', 'violence', 'ensues', '34', 'Oh', 'look', 'Martha', 'ex-con', 'been', 'disintegrated', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'thing', 'need.', '34', 'repeat', 'four', 'times.Also', 'incredibly', 'corny', 'Think', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'SpongeBob', 'Squarepants', 'one', 'obviously', 'designed', 'younger', 'audience', 'usual', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'So', 'overall', 'were', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'plot', 'department', 'really', 'fell', 'apart', 'first', 'day', 'work', 're-made', 'story', 'style', 'full-length', 'TV', 'show', 'maybe', 'movie', 'slightly', 'older', 'target', 'audience', 'proper', 'devotion', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'might', 'watch']",Doctor Who: The Infinite Quest

Back when Tom Baker was the Doctor and the show was very set-bound and claustrophobic, an animated adventure would have permitted epic landscapes and casts of thousands which would have been beyond the scope of the live-action series.  But now, when cinematic production values can be had for relatively modest budgets, I watch this adventure, and my reaction is to shrug.This piece is up to the par of mini-episodes which used to appear on the BBC website and had to be limited to a downloadable file size.  It makes no use of the capabilities of DVD.  Sound is pitched at more or less the same level, without regard for story quality.  The sound designers should spend some time watchingWall-Eto see how a genius like Ben Burtt can make a vast soundscape with a Macintosh and a simple mike rig.The story is also very choppy, probably because it was first broadcast in three-minute increments.  But the net result is a story of such rapid peaks and troughs that I fear getting whiplash trying to follow the narrative.  On consideration it's merely cute, nothing more.I can see where this might be fun for kids.  Really small kids.  Especially since the actual show has gotten so dark that it may rattle too many little squirts, something cute and frothy might be up their street.
