1362173,A3BYR4TTDTDZ2S,B003TLMPFA,An W.,"[1, 2]","I loved Star Wars growing up and then became angry with the franchise after I saw the first two prequels (Episode III was alright). I didn't bother with the Clone Wars movie and never planned on getting into the tv series. I impulse bought the first season two months ago, and my initial belief that I had wasted my money was nearly realized when the first few episodes did not impress me. I kept watching and the quality of the episodes seemed to get better, to the point that I started to like the series. I went ahead and bought the second season, and was even more impressed. I found myself really engaged during some of the episodes, and found myself laughing at some of the dialogue (the writing really improved I think, and I noticed some subtle, less childish, humor that was thrown in). I don't know if this is because my expectations were so low in the beginning, or if it was because I forced myself to watch it for so long that I started to like it, but I think season II is really good quality entertainment, and more than good enough for Star Wars fans that felt betrayed with the prequels :)",4,Loving Star Wars Again,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1106,"['loved', 'Star', 'Wars', 'growing', 'up', 'then', 'became', 'angry', 'franchise', 'saw', 'first', 'two', 'prequels', 'Episode', 'III', 'was', 'alright', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'movie', 'never', 'planned', 'getting', 'tv', 'series', 'impulse', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'months', 'ago', 'initial', 'belief', 'had', 'wasted', 'money', 'was', 'nearly', 'realized', 'when', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'kept', 'watching', 'quality', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'get', 'better', 'point', 'started', 'like', 'series', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'found', 'really', 'engaged', 'episodes', 'found', 'laughing', 'dialogue', 'writing', 'really', 'improved', 'think', 'noticed', 'subtle', 'less', 'childish', 'humor', 'was', 'thrown', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'beginning', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'so', 'long', 'started', 'think', 'season', 'II', 'really', 'good', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'more', 'good', 'enough', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fans', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'prequels']",N/A

I own the first two seaons, have skipped the third, and will likely purchase season 4 in the future. S2 is an improvement over the fairly decent S1, IMHO. The animation improves every year but S2 has the most noticable differences. If you are a SW fan, and enjoy the show, than I would certainly recommend S2. I will say that TCW is not for everybody, particularly the old-school die-hard fans like me, but if even I can overlook some of the blatent disregard for EU continuity in this series than I would think most older fans can as well. However, that does not mean I approve of decision and story of this series, as my aforementioned skipping of S3 should show.",4,Getting Good,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,786,"['am', 'aware', 'series', 'primarily', 'directed', 'younger', 'audience', 'am', 'too', 'big', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'avoid', 'own', 'first', 'two', 'seaons', 'have', 'skipped', 'third', 'will', 'likely', 'purchase', 'season', '4', 'future', 'S2', 'improvement', 'fairly', 'decent', 'S1', 'IMHO', 'animation', 'year', 'S2', 'most', 'noticable', 'differences', 'are', 'SW', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'show', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'S2', 'will', 'say', 'TCW', 'not', 'everybody', 'particularly', 'old-school', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'even', 'can', 'overlook', 'blatent', 'disregard', 'EU', 'continuity', 'series', 'would', 'think', 'most', 'older', 'fans', 'can', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'not', 'mean', 'approve', 'decision', 'story', 'series', 'aforementioned', 'skipping', 'S3', 'should', 'show']",N/A

1362177,AN6Y4IYXXDNVV,B003TLMPFA,Bob02,"[5, 6]","If you're looking for a more visual review, you might as well skip this one.  You're seeing Star Wars through the eyes of a guy who's been blind since birth, so I'll mainly be focusing on the story and voice talent.  But if you're feeling daring and adventurous, read ahead.Being a boxset, this contains all 22 episodes of season 2.  There are a few featurettes focusing on how some of the larger story arcs in season 2 were created.  I wish they had given us a small commentary on each episode like they did in the season 1 boxset, but this isn't bad at all.Season 2 boasted some terrific story arcs.  Among my favorites were the Geonosis 4 parter.  The first 2 episodes in this arc contain one of the most kick butt ground battles.  I also enjoyed the Mandalore trilogy.  Some viewers found this trilogy to be contrary to the Expanded Universe, but I don't see that.  So their are a few peaceful Mandalorians.  Who is to say that their warrior culture won't win out in the end.  And Pre Viszla(hope I'm spelling that correctly), was such a ruthless villain.  Hats off to John Favreau for a thrilling performance, and I'm really digging that darksaber!(I buy a few of Hasbro's action figures and vehicles from this show so I can get a better feel for what I'm seeing, by the way.  Now if they'd only release that supertank.)I also got to see one of my favorite characters again in season 2.  Cad Bane got his own trilogy.  As did another one of my favs: Boba Fett, who was brought to life by the incredible voice talent of Daniel Logan.  Bounty hunters in the Star Wars universe have always interested me, so these 6 episodes were such a treat.  So was the 2 part story arc featuring General Grievous. No one will ever be able to replace Matt Wood as the voice of everyone's favorite cyborg.What can I say about the voice talent?  They all do such a fantastic job.  I love James Arnold Taylor's Obi Wan Kenobi.  And Matt Lanter is a joy to listen to as Anakin Skywalker.(I hear he's on that new 90210 show and I've been wanting to glance at one episode to see if I can pick him out of the crowd.)  Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka pulled out all the stops this season, and so did Cat Taber as Padme.  I grew up listening to Corey Burton in shows like Transformers, so it's great listening to him work as Dooku and Cad Bane.  Way to go there, Shockwave!  Every voice actor who works on this series gives 200 percent and it certainly shows.  And I can't fail to mension Tom Kane as Yoda and the narrator.  I wish he could read my grocery list back to me each week.  Maybe I'd have more fun instead of being bored shopping at HEB.(Really hate grocery shopping.)So that about wraps it up.  I had a Clone Wars fest when I bought this back in 2010 and finished rewatching the season in about a day or so.  The episodes are that good.  You have to will yourself to turn off the DVD player.  And I'd already seen each of these episodes when they heired.  So please don't pass this season up.  I mean hey, it's Star Wars for crying out loud!  And Dave Filoni, director of the series, really delivers.",5,This season blew me away.,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3085,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'visual', 'review', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'skip', 'one', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'eyes', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'blind', 'birth', ""'ll"", 'mainly', 'be', 'focusing', 'story', 'voice', 'talent', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'daring', 'adventurous', 'read', 'ahead.Being', 'boxset', '22', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'are', 'few', 'featurettes', 'focusing', 'how', 'larger', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', '2', 'were', 'created', 'wish', 'had', 'given', 'small', 'commentary', 'episode', 'did', 'season', '1', 'boxset', ""n't"", 'bad', 'all.Season', '2', 'boasted', 'terrific', 'story', 'arcs', 'favorites', 'were', 'Geonosis', '4', 'parter', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'arc', 'contain', 'one', 'most', 'kick', 'butt', 'ground', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Mandalore', 'trilogy', 'viewers', 'found', 'trilogy', 'be', 'contrary', 'Expanded', 'Universe', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'few', 'peaceful', 'Mandalorians', 'Who', 'say', 'warrior', 'culture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'out', 'end', 'Pre', 'Viszla', 'hope', ""'m"", 'spelling', 'correctly', 'was', 'such', 'ruthless', 'villain', 'John', 'Favreau', 'thrilling', 'performance', ""'m"", 'really', 'digging', 'darksaber', 'buy', 'few', 'Hasbro', 'action', 'figures', 'vehicles', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'feel', 'what', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'way', 'Now', ""'d"", 'only', 'release', 'supertank', 'also', 'got', 'see', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'again', 'season', '2', 'Cad', 'Bane', 'got', 'own', 'trilogy', 'did', 'one', 'favs', 'Boba', 'Fett', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'life', 'incredible', 'voice', 'talent', 'Daniel', 'Logan', 'Bounty', 'hunters', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'have', 'always', 'interested', '6', 'episodes', 'were', 'treat', 'was', '2', 'part', 'story', 'arc', 'featuring', 'General', 'Grievous', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'replace', 'Matt', 'Wood', 'voice', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'cyborg.What', 'can', 'say', 'voice', 'talent', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'love', 'James', 'Arnold', 'Taylor', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Kenobi', 'Matt', 'Lanter', 'joy', 'listen', 'Anakin', 'Skywalker', 'hear', 'new', '90210', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'glance', 'one', 'episode', 'see', 'can', 'pick', 'crowd', 'Ashley', 'Eckstein', 'Ahsoka', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'season', 'so', 'did', 'Cat', 'Taber', 'Padme', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'shows', 'Transformers', 'great', 'listening', 'work', 'Dooku', 'Cad', 'Bane', 'Way', 'go', 'there', 'Shockwave', 'Every', 'voice', 'actor', 'who', 'series', '200', 'percent', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fail', 'mension', 'Tom', 'Kane', 'Yoda', 'narrator', 'wish', 'could', 'read', 'grocery', 'list', 'back', 'week', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'instead', 'being', 'bored', 'shopping', 'HEB', 'Really', 'hate', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'wraps', 'up', 'had', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'fest', 'when', 'bought', 'back', '2010', 'finished', 'rewatching', 'season', 'day', 'so', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'will', 'yourself', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', 'when', 'heired', 'So', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'season', 'up', 'mean', 'hey', 'Star', 'Wars', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Dave', 'Filoni', 'director', 'series', 'really', 'delivers']",N/A

1362182,A3I8OURC83NM6V,B003TLMPFA,"Christopher M. Fulton ""Purveyor of Truth""","[4, 4]","As much as I liked season one, I like this so much more.  The series grew up some.  It isn't as ""childish"" as the first season.  We get deeper into the every day of the war.  Not that I am into uber-violence, but, it is war-time.  Even though it is geared towards a younger audience, there are certain things one expects in a series dealing with a war.  Hard decisions must be made; characters must be tested in harsh circumstances.  And to that end, it succeeds.  A reviewer or two has stated the characters seem detached about the death around them.  I would think that would be a normal knee-jerk reaction.  One has to deal with the violence, the death, the destruction, the intensity, somehow.  So I think it is natural that one would detach and seem cold and emotionless.  But, I digress.  This is a great season of a great show.  For what it is worth, my younger brother who has heard of it, but never watched it, recently tuned into Cartoon Network and started watching season three and has decided he likes the show.

1362188,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B003TLMPFA,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","I was definitely one of those skeptics who didn't think Star Wars would work as an animated show. I especially was worried about the art style. However, after hearing that Darth Maul was coming back, I decided to try it out - and ended up loving it.The show is very respectful of the movies and does a good job building upon the themes in the original and prequel trilogies while adding its own new characters and stories. Ashoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice, has a wonderful combination of sass and charm. Assaj Ventress, Dooku's apprentice, adds the first true female villain to the series. Even more impressive, the series makes you care about the clone troopers, who act much more like American G.I.s than Stormtroopers.The second season I felt had much more variable quality than the first. While the first season was consistently solid, the second had some high highs and low lows. The best part of the season for me was the opening trilogy featuring the bounty hunter Cad Bane. He has an amazing screen presence and takes the series into darker territory. Some of the other strong episodes in the season were the standalone episodes that focus on character development, particularly ""The Deserter"" and ""Lost Lightsaber,"" which give Rex and Ashoka Tano respectively a chance to shine. Some of the other episodes also give Jedi masters like Plo Koon and Ki-Adi Mundi fun lines.A lot of the episodes this season were tributes to classic films or film genres. ""Bounty Hunters"" was a fun episode introducing several new bounty hunters, was a tribute to Kurosawa. The brain invaders arc had a blatant mix of Aliens with the Geonosian queen and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The Zillo Beast duology was a carbon copy of Godzilla and King Kong. The episodes on their own don't do a whole lot to advance the meta-story of the Clone Wars, but they're fun tributes.The weaker parts of the season were the longer story arcs. The Geonosis arc just didn't do anything for me and reminded me of the soulless battle scenes in Attack of the Clones. Although admittedly the Clone Wars did a better job, giving Jedi Masters Luminara and Ki-Adi Mundi some real depth. The Mandalore arc also didn't really excite me for some reason. The only part I really enjoyed was seeing the flirtation with Obi-Wan and Duchess Satine. I can't pinpoint exactly what I didn't like, but couldn't really get into seeing Mandalore in such a state.Overall, if you like Star Wars I'd recommend giving the show a try. It's not just for kids. I haven't once felt ""silly"" for watching it.

I would have preferred if Season Two had the featurettes for each episode like Season One, but instead they are grouped by each multi-episode story.

Its not bad.  But the stories seemed recycled from old movies:  The magnificent seven, Godzilla, some other stories I couldn't put my finger on but seemed familiar somehow.  Each episode seemed to be somehow disconnected from the larger story of the Clone War that is supposed to be taking place.  Then the last thing I watched on the DVD's was an interview with the producer who said ""George Lucas wanted to pay homage to old movies with the stories in Season 2"" and then it all made sense.The problem with that is, George took us on this trip by suspending too much disbelief and almost ignoring the larger war entirely.  For example, in order to setup the Magnificent Seven storyline, he had 3 Jedi's go on a trip to investigate the destruction of an entire clone facility in a little courier sized starship, so it could get shot down and strand them on a planet, forcing the storyline.  At this point don't they know they are at war?  They send 3 Jedi in a Winnebago to investigate the destruction of an entire starbase?The graphics are still good, though starting to show their age.  The epic battles of season 1 are present in the first half of the season, replaced by non related filler stories and recycled stories in the 2nd half.  You don't get the sense like you did in season 1, that the current story counts.

One other reviewer said they should use this tech to continue Luke Skywalker's further adventures after ""Return of the Jedi"", ergo, the destruction of the Death Star.  I agree 235%.  That would be Timothy Zahn's ""Heir to the Empire"" book trilogy, which I found to be no less than awesome reading.  So much of that stuff would have to be CG'd or animated.  I'd get a huge kick out of it myself.  This Clone Wars series is for kids and for big kids like me.  My wife is resigned to the fact that I'll never grow up no matter how old I get.  I have all Star Wars movies and all the animated movies and Clone Wars series and movies that have come out so far.  I have them arranged in the proper order that the legend takes them.  I'm a sci-fi nut.  I've also got everything Star Trek and the complete Babylon-5 series and lots of old 1950s movies.

The art is fuller, richer, deeper and more importantly the characters are given more depth and development and the variety of characters, including a closer focus on some of the bad guys, make for compelling and diverse episodes.  From the grief that intriguing bounty hunter Cad Bane causes to the returning focus on Ahsoka occasionally teamed up with another Padawan (Barriss Offee) that deepens character sentiment and attachment Season 2 lays a rich story foundation for future seasons.  There are plenty of standalone eps in this season (like the meaningful &#34;The Deserter&#34; wherein Captain Rex encounters another Clone who has deserted the war and taken up residence on Felucia and has a family thus individualizing himself beyond the scope of what he was created for) as well as several small story arcs such as the homage to Godzilla in &#34;The Zillo Beast&#34; storyline and the fascinating &#34;The Mandalore Plot&#34; where we are treated not just to the origin to Jango and Boba Fett's traditional warrior's outfit but also to some tasty and terse relational moments between Obi Wan and Mandalorian Duchess Satine.The whole offering is simply quite tasty and would appeal to open-minded fantasy enthusiasts of all types.
