1603550,APCPKFNRS5WXV,B00A144O4S,Alex T,"[0, 0]","I was expecting lots of intricately choreographed action (because its alternative title is Bangkok Kung Fu), and characters that really helped to drive the themes of the film. Nope, I got none of those things from this awfully structured movie. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is often laughable (not-on-purpose laughable), and more importantly, there's very little direction or thought put into most of the film.I don't have so much of a problem with the special effects (considering the budget of the film) or the premise of a Shaolin Kung Fu master training abused children. In fact, I found that premise to be quite promising, since it could have opened so many doors for character studies and showing the inner conflict between respecting Shaolin ideology and the human need for vengeance - you know, something that could have redeemed everything else in the film! That's what it promised for the start of the movie, but then it miraculously screws up. For one thing, the acting is pretty stiff and nonexistent in this movie. I'm not sure if the poor dialogue is making the acting bad, or the bad acting is making the dialogue poor, but once the film ends, you just decide that it's both.It makes such a sloppy attempt at giving these characters some depth and sense of brotherhood as they avenge their fallen master. No, I wasn't expecting an Oscar-caliber script or acting, but even compared to typical action movies, the attempt is still terrible. Consider this: once the plot fast forwards after the Shaolin master saves the tortured children from abductors, we notice an interwoven subplot of this teenage love triangle between the now trained martial artists. Not only is this subplot completely unnecessary and brainless, but to make this even more insulting, the movie still continues to plug in this melodrama literally only a few moments after their master has been killed! What was supposed to be the focus of the movie gets so abruptly and awkwardly pushed aside for something writer/director Yuthlert Sippapak thought would work. As a result, the film also drifts off for long periods of time. So by the time this subplot comes into play, you begin to realize there was very little effort put into piecing together this movie, regardless of what demographic they were trying to appeal to.The fight scenes are mostly uninspiring, plain and simple. As I mentioned before, the film's special effects quality isn't that big of an issue, but the fact that it's not being complemented by anything remotely resembling thought-out choreography is the problem. In many scenes, it almost feels like the director just told the actors to improvise some fight moves while the camera rolls, and that made the final cut. And for the few moments that do contain some sort of impressive martial arts display, you realize you might have seen the same fight moves in many other martial arts movies before it. That's a small note for those expecting something original in this film.To its credit, the film does make use of its Thai backdrop, allowing for its diverse filming locations to give the movie its intended Southeast Asian setting. In addition, the people who put together Bangkok Assassin did make a bold move in wanting to depict Thailand's national issue of child abductions. The inclusion of deaf, blind, and mentally disabled main characters wasn't as exploitative as I'd thought it would be. As viewers, we actually see how they became that way in the film's prologue, and that gave us some sort of discernible reason to care about what happens to them next.Perhaps that's why I'm extremely disappointed with the film. It started promisingly well, and it gave the sense that it could deliver a strong emotional purpose equally matched by its action and exposition. Once the main characters are shown as teenagers, it felt like not much more effort was given afterwards to any aspect of the film. The characters get caught up in horribly scripted melodrama, and too often the director seems to forget where he's going with the flick. There wasn't any redeeming qualities that would make me call this even an OK film. For those with Amazon Prime, you can see this film for yourself, but don't go in expecting much from it. Because you will when it starts off.",2,"Disappointing movie, not worth most of the running time",1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,4275,"['was', 'expecting', 'lots', 'intricately', 'choreographed', 'action', 'alternative', 'title', 'Bangkok', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'characters', 'really', 'helped', 'drive', 'themes', 'film', 'Nope', 'got', 'none', 'things', 'awfully', 'structured', 'movie', 'acting', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'often', 'laughable', 'not-on-purpose', 'laughable', 'more', 'importantly', 'very', 'little', 'direction', 'thought', 'put', 'most', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'much', 'problem', 'special', 'effects', 'considering', 'budget', 'film', 'premise', 'Shaolin', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'training', 'abused', 'children', 'fact', 'found', 'premise', 'be', 'quite', 'promising', 'could', 'have', 'opened', 'so', 'many', 'doors', 'character', 'studies', 'showing', 'inner', 'conflict', 'respecting', 'Shaolin', 'ideology', 'human', 'need', 'vengeance', 'know', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'redeemed', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'what', 'promised', 'start', 'movie', 'then', 'miraculously', 'up', 'one', 'thing', 'acting', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'nonexistent', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'making', 'acting', 'bad', 'bad', 'acting', 'making', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'once', 'film', 'just', 'decide', 'both.It', 'sloppy', 'attempt', 'giving', 'characters', 'depth', 'sense', 'brotherhood', 'avenge', 'fallen', 'master', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Oscar-caliber', 'script', 'acting', 'even', 'compared', 'typical', 'action', 'movies', 'attempt', 'still', 'terrible', 'Consider', 'once', 'plot', 'fast', 'forwards', 'Shaolin', 'master', 'tortured', 'children', 'abductors', 'notice', 'interwoven', 'subplot', 'teenage', 'love', 'triangle', 'now', 'trained', 'martial', 'artists', 'Not', 'only', 'subplot', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'brainless', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'insulting', 'movie', 'still', 'plug', 'melodrama', 'literally', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'master', 'been', 'killed', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'focus', 'movie', 'so', 'abruptly', 'awkwardly', 'pushed', 'aside', 'something', 'writer/director', 'Yuthlert', 'Sippapak', 'thought', 'would', 'work', 'result', 'film', 'also', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'So', 'time', 'subplot', 'play', 'begin', 'realize', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'put', 'piecing', 'together', 'movie', 'regardless', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'appeal', 'to.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'uninspiring', 'plain', 'simple', 'mentioned', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'quality', ""n't"", 'big', 'issue', 'fact', 'not', 'being', 'complemented', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'thought-out', 'choreography', 'problem', 'many', 'scenes', 'almost', 'feels', 'director', 'just', 'told', 'actors', 'improvise', 'fight', 'moves', 'camera', 'rolls', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'few', 'moments', 'do', 'contain', 'sort', 'impressive', 'martial', 'arts', 'display', 'realize', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'fight', 'moves', 'many', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'small', 'note', 'expecting', 'something', 'original', 'film.To', 'credit', 'film', 'make', 'use', 'Thai', 'backdrop', 'allowing', 'diverse', 'filming', 'locations', 'give', 'movie', 'intended', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'setting', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'Bangkok', 'Assassin', 'did', 'make', 'bold', 'move', 'wanting', 'depict', 'Thailand', 'national', 'issue', 'child', 'abductions', 'inclusion', 'deaf', 'blind', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'main', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'exploitative', ""'d"", 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'viewers', 'actually', 'see', 'how', 'became', 'way', 'film', 'prologue', 'gave', 'sort', 'discernible', 'reason', 'care', 'what', 'next.Perhaps', 'why', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'started', 'promisingly', 'well', 'gave', 'sense', 'could', 'deliver', 'strong', 'emotional', 'purpose', 'equally', 'matched', 'action', 'exposition', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'teenagers', 'felt', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'effort', 'was', 'given', 'afterwards', 'aspect', 'film', 'characters', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'horribly', 'scripted', 'melodrama', 'too', 'often', 'director', 'forget', 'where', 'going', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'would', 'make', 'call', 'even', 'OK', 'film', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'much', 'will', 'when']",Bangkok Assassins

Don't get me wrong, there are some scenes in this film that are fairly entertaining and some of the fight scenes are fun to watch, BUT....well the film taken as a whole just didn't seem to work.  It is almost like the director couldn't remember what the plot of the movie was as it was being made, it comes across as a hodgepodge collections of scenes that are only loosly associated.  Even the supposed epic showdowns throughout the film that are supposed to be big revenge fights kinda come out of nowhere and dissapate just a awkwardly.  There are multiple times in the movie where I found myself wondering why the characters whouldn't use the special moves that they displayed earlier in the film in the situations they get stuck in?  It is like one minute the are able to drop people with no effort then they end up standing there helpless in the next scene.... This film will leave you less than satisfied and even though it does resolve some plot points throughout, the manner in which it unfolds just makes you not care about it anymore.  If they could have just edited out the cheasy and unnessasary parts they would have had a more streamlined film...but it would have been only about 15min long.",3,believe the low scores,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,1292,"['Having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'so', 'cheap', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'BUT', '.well', 'film', 'taken', 'whole', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'almost', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'hodgepodge', 'collections', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'loosly', 'associated', 'Even', 'supposed', 'epic', 'showdowns', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'revenge', 'fights', 'kinda', 'come', 'nowhere', 'dissapate', 'just', 'awkwardly', 'are', 'multiple', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'characters', 'whould', ""n't"", 'use', 'special', 'moves', 'displayed', 'earlier', 'film', 'situations', 'get', 'stuck', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'able', 'drop', 'people', 'effort', 'then', 'end', 'up', 'standing', 'there', 'helpless', 'next', 'scene', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'less', 'satisfied', 'even', 'resolve', 'plot', 'points', 'manner', 'just', 'not', 'care', 'anymore', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'edited', 'out', 'cheasy', 'unnessasary', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'streamlined', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'about', '15min', 'long']",Bangkok Assassins

From Bruce Lee to Donny Yen, from Korea to Thai to China to Japan. So I know a good martial arts movie when I see one.This movies has many minuses:1. They over did the slow motion effects. We all love a good slo-mo to enjoy the full quality of the power of a strike or speed of a run, but every single punch in this movie was done in extra slo-mo which shows that none of these actors can actually fight. They compensate their lameness with this... A LOT.2. They over did the Shaolin Martial Art skills. It seemed that these kids, having learnt martial arts from a young age, suddenly became mega-ultra masters of the trade and with one single touch, can disable a full grown man. It is too comical and unbelievable to be taken seriously.3. Cheesy comedy. This movie has a lot of Asian slap-stick, which is sort of funny in Thai movies when done right, but defintely not in this one. The comedy is waaayy to cheesy.One thing this movie has done right: The male leads are pretty hot (even the slow boy) but even that could not compensate for the horrible horrible acting, plot, and fighting this movie carries.I cant believe they put money into something like this.
