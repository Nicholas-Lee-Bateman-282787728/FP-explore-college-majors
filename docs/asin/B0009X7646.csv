White,"[1, 1]","This isn't a bad set of episodes by any means, but I think many fans would agree that at around this point in the series it started to get a little too weird, which does affect the entertainment aspect a bit IMHO. If this is any indication where volume 3 starts off, the Syndicate/Consortium is destroyed on the second of its four discs, effectively wiping out the colonization ""project"" that has been in the show since the beginning for the most part.I only had two minor criticisms with the product as a whole, and the Mythology Collection in general, and those are the 'theme' or 'title' of each volume doesn't really mean anything and the choice of episodes included are somewhat questionable. The volumes show the mythology episodes in chronological order, so I don't know why they were given titles/themes instead of just cover images and volume numbers. If this were strictly the 'colonization' collection the earlier stuff that sets up this conspiracy would be here rather what we get. Also, the episode selection a little too conservative; there are several eps that should've been included, with a few others that were being left out, but for some reason only the eps that directly involved the mythology/conspiracy were included and not ones that delved further into the plot and characterization. Other than those issues I rather enjoyed the continuation of the mythology plot.",4,Title is Misleading,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1389,"[""n't"", 'bad', 'set', 'episodes', 'means', 'think', 'many', 'fans', 'would', 'agree', 'point', 'series', 'started', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'weird', 'affect', 'entertainment', 'aspect', 'bit', 'IMHO', 'indication', 'where', 'volume', '3', 'off', 'Syndicate/Consortium', 'destroyed', 'second', 'four', 'discs', 'effectively', 'wiping', 'out', 'colonization', 'project', 'been', 'show', 'beginning', 'most', 'part.I', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'product', 'whole', 'Mythology', 'Collection', 'general', 'are', ""'theme"", ""'"", 'volume', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'anything', 'choice', 'episodes', 'included', 'are', 'somewhat', 'questionable', 'volumes', 'show', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'chronological', 'order', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'were', 'given', 'titles/themes', 'instead', 'just', 'cover', 'images', 'volume', 'numbers', 'were', 'strictly', ""'colonization"", 'collection', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'up', 'conspiracy', 'would', 'be', 'here', 'rather', 'what', 'get', 'Also', 'episode', 'selection', 'little', 'too', 'conservative', 'are', 'several', 'eps', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'included', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'being', 'left', 'out', 'reason', 'only', 'eps', 'directly', 'involved', 'mythology/conspiracy', 'were', 'included', 'not', 'ones', 'delved', 'further', 'plot', 'characterization', 'Other', 'issues', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'continuation', 'mythology', 'plot']","X-Files: Mythology, Volume Three - Colonization"

The four mythology sets contain most of the story arc scripts.  This, the third set, resolved many of the mysteries from the earlier seasons.  A conspiracy involving collaboration with alien invaders was uncovered, while the conspirators found their unearthly allies to be unreliable partners, and a new element, rebel aliens was introduced.  The X-Files movie, Fight the Future, which was released about the same time, explored the same themes.  Paradoxically, by resolving one of the key plot lines, these episodes set the stage for the decline, and eventual end of the series.  Some of these episodes were outstanding.  Others, however, were overly mystical.  In the coming seasons, David Duchovny's role would be written out of the scripts, while Gillian Anderson's role would be diminished.

915494,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0009X7646,"N.

Many of the episodes featured here (from season's five and six mainly) are classic episodes that revealed much of the show's grand scheme, but the last few featured here weren't up to the same quality that fans of the show expected.  There are some pluses here, including the introduction of Agent John Dogget (Terminator 2's Robert Patrick), but as a whole, this collection is better off to casual X-Files fans who don't want to shell out the cash for the full season sets.  All in all, like the two volumes before it, Colonization is a decent purchase for casual X-Files fans that are just interested in the show's mythology (the stand alone episodes that the show is renowned for are not included in any of the Mythology sets), but for those who already own the various full season sets, this is completely worthless.",4,Another volume for casual X-Files fans,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1235,"['third', 'volume', 'X-Files', 'mythology', 'series', '16', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'five', 'eight', 'including', 'Patient', 'X', 'Red', 'Black', 'End', 'Beginning', 'S.R', '819', 'Two', 'Fathers', 'One', 'Son', 'Biogenesis', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'II', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'Sein', 'Zeit', 'Closure', 'En', 'Ami', 'Requiem', 'Within', 'focus', 'Colonization', 'aspect', 'show', 'main', 'story', 'arc', 'Many', 'episodes', 'featured', 'here', 'season', 'five', 'six', 'mainly', 'are', 'classic', 'episodes', 'revealed', 'much', 'show', 'grand', 'scheme', 'last', 'few', 'featured', 'here', 'were', ""n't"", 'up', 'same', 'quality', 'fans', 'show', 'expected', 'are', 'pluses', 'here', 'including', 'introduction', 'Agent', 'John', 'Dogget', 'Terminator', '2', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'whole', 'collection', 'better', 'casual', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'shell', 'out', 'cash', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'two', 'volumes', 'Colonization', 'decent', 'purchase', 'casual', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'are', 'just', 'interested', 'show', 'mythology', 'stand', 'alone', 'show', 'renowned', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'Mythology', 'sets', 'who', 'already', 'own', 'various', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'completely', 'worthless']","X-Files: Mythology, Volume Three - Colonization"
915495,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009X7646,Robert Moore,"[48, 55]","I still have my complaints about this odd series of DVD sets from Fox. The basic idea isn't a bad one under the right circumstances: take all of the mythology episodes from THE X-FILES and group them in four inexpensive sets that leave out the stand alone episodes in order to tell ""the X-Files story."" I'm still not quite sure who the target audience for these sets is. Neophytes will be missing the standalone episodes that are just as typical of the series as the mythology episodes (and that represent many of the finest episodes), and serious fans already have all these episodes. To sum up, here are my complaints:1. Instead of providing some inexpensive Mythology sets, FOX Entertainment should instead have focused on cutting the exorbitant prices of the complete season sets. They should provide us with sets that list around $59.95, so that places like Amazon can sell them at initial offerings of $38.2. The sets come with minimal extras, largely recycling the special features from the original boxed DVD sets.3. While the Mythology sets serve a function by calling attention to the seasons-long story arc, they hurt by eliminating the standalone episodes, which are just as crucial to developing the Mulder-Scully chemistry as the Mythology episodes.4. In the end, the sets feel like an attempt to milk X-FILE fans who are anxious for new material while waiting and hoping for a new feature length film.Nonetheless, I can support the idea of these sets for two reasons. First, they do help focus attention on the alien colonization story arc that runs through the various seasons of THE X-FILES. Second, they are very cheap.Unfortunately, after this third set, things go downhill pretty quickly. I absolutely love THE X-FILES, and even loved Season Eight after Duchovny largely left the show, and much of Season Nine after he was gone entirely (though his memory lingered on). But the fourth set will be dedicated to the Super Soldiers story arc, and that was the one truly awful thing that ever occurred in THE X-FILES. The story arc that ended with the destruction of the cooperative efforts with the aliens striving to colonize earth left the show without much structure in Season Seven, so I can understand the desire to reintroduce structure with a new story arc. Unfortunately, the Super Soldiers simply didn't work, partly because they were a little too powerful (though they did find a kind of kryptonite that worked against them), and partly because the show was running out of gas when they were introduced, and no one seemed to want to try and make them interesting. Once the main arc that dominated the show from the first season until the very beginning of Season Seven came to an end, the show largely drifted from one standalone episode to another. Some familiar characters reappeared from time to time, like the Cigarette Smoking Man, and we got some alien episodes, but for all intents and purposes the main arc came to an end in ""Amor Fati"" in Season Seven. Everything after that has a tacked on feeling to it.The importance of THE X-FILES in popularizing very long story arcs simply cannot be overstated. I've argued in several places that one reason that the ceiling for what television is capable of doing has been raised so high has resulted from the successive contributions of TWIN PEAKS, THE X-FILES, and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, the first by showing that television was capable of telling riveting narratives, the second by exciting us with multi-season story arcs, and the third by keeping the multi-season story arcs, but shifting the main concern from plot to character development. The first three (but not the fourth) of the Mythology sets help make the case for this important contribution THE X-FILES has made to the history of television.",4,The set where the mythology truly comes to an end,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3786,"['still', 'have', 'complaints', 'odd', 'series', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Fox', 'basic', 'idea', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'right', 'circumstances', 'take', 'mythology', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'group', 'four', 'inexpensive', 'sets', 'leave', 'out', 'stand', 'alone', 'order', 'tell', 'X-Files', 'story', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'who', 'target', 'audience', 'sets', 'Neophytes', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'standalone', 'are', 'just', 'typical', 'series', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'represent', 'many', 'finest', 'episodes', 'serious', 'fans', 'already', 'have', 'episodes', 'sum', 'up', 'here', 'are', 'complaints:1', 'Instead', 'providing', 'inexpensive', 'Mythology', 'sets', 'FOX', 'Entertainment', 'should', 'instead', 'have', 'focused', 'cutting', 'exorbitant', 'prices', 'complete', 'season', 'sets', 'should', 'provide', 'sets', 'list', '59.95', 'so', 'places', 'Amazon', 'can', 'sell', 'initial', 'offerings', '38.2', 'sets', 'come', 'minimal', 'extras', 'largely', 'recycling', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'boxed', 'DVD', 'sets.3', 'Mythology', 'sets', 'serve', 'function', 'calling', 'attention', 'seasons-long', 'story', 'arc', 'hurt', 'eliminating', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'crucial', 'developing', 'Mulder-Scully', 'chemistry', 'Mythology', 'episodes.4', 'end', 'sets', 'feel', 'attempt', 'milk', 'X-FILE', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'anxious', 'new', 'material', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'new', 'feature', 'length', 'film.Nonetheless', 'can', 'support', 'idea', 'sets', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'do', 'help', 'focus', 'attention', 'alien', 'colonization', 'story', 'arc', 'various', 'seasons', 'X-FILES', 'Second', 'are', 'very', 'cheap.Unfortunately', 'third', 'set', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'absolutely', 'love', 'X-FILES', 'even', 'loved', 'Season', 'Eight', 'Duchovny', 'largely', 'left', 'show', 'much', 'Season', 'Nine', 'was', 'gone', 'entirely', 'memory', 'lingered', 'fourth', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'dedicated', 'Super', 'Soldiers', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'one', 'truly', 'awful', 'thing', 'ever', 'occurred', 'X-FILES', 'story', 'arc', 'ended', 'destruction', 'cooperative', 'efforts', 'aliens', 'striving', 'colonize', 'earth', 'left', 'show', 'much', 'structure', 'Season', 'Seven', 'can', 'understand', 'desire', 'reintroduce', 'structure', 'new', 'story', 'arc', 'Unfortunately', 'Super', 'Soldiers', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'partly', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'powerful', 'did', 'find', 'kind', 'kryptonite', 'worked', 'partly', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'gas', 'when', 'were', 'introduced', 'one', 'seemed', 'want', 'try', 'make', 'interesting', 'main', 'arc', 'dominated', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Seven', 'came', 'end', 'show', 'largely', 'drifted', 'one', 'standalone', 'episode', 'familiar', 'characters', 'reappeared', 'time', 'time', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'got', 'alien', 'episodes', 'intents', 'main', 'arc', 'came', 'end', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Everything', 'tacked', 'feeling', 'it.The', 'importance', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'popularizing', 'very', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overstated', ""'ve"", 'argued', 'several', 'places', 'one', 'reason', 'ceiling', 'what', 'television', 'capable', 'doing', 'been', 'raised', 'so', 'high', 'resulted', 'successive', 'contributions', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'first', 'showing', 'television', 'was', 'capable', 'telling', 'riveting', 'narratives', 'second', 'exciting', 'multi-season', 'story', 'arcs', 'third', 'keeping', 'multi-season', 'story', 'arcs', 'shifting', 'main', 'concern', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'first', 'three', 'not', 'fourth', 'Mythology', 'sets', 'help', 'make', 'case', 'important', 'contribution', 'X-FILES', 'made', 'history', 'television']","X-Files: Mythology, Volume Three - Colonization"

We also know about the aliens and that they are taking people, and we know about the Black Oil and how it works - somewhat. The ""alien virus"" notion is out there as well, and Skully has shown us what all it can do on the scientific front. This leaves us open to the fact that there are aliens and that the aliens are quite possibly setting up shop on Earth, something that might be quite bad. Enter the Syndicate, the conspiracy rooted in the lore of yesteryear, and the fact that there are some big egos waiting to unleash something quite bad on the whole of humankind.Beofre starting, I feel like I need to mention the one inster that proves to be important in all these sets. It is a timeline/ people list AND it is connective when placed with all the other sets. That means you would want to have it and that means you would want to get them all. That also means you have the one feature you might want to get out of all of these sets. The other special feature, basically an interview with Kim Manners or Chris Carter every 3 or 4 episodes, is not that big. You also get some deleted things here and there, but you really do not get that many. The insert, however, is nice and beautiful and is something you might want to check on - missing it is bad considering I want mine to frame because they look so nice.In this set, you have a few major players coming in. The First Elder, Well-Manicured Man, C.G.B Spender (Smoking Man), Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Gibson Praise, and the Alien Rebels are all listed here. Some are part of the syndicate and you would not know their names if they were not mentioned. Others play odd roles when it comes out, like Praise, and others are names coming out of our character's past (Fowley). The Rebels also play an interesting role and ne I would not have seen coming, and all of them come together to complete a huge arch that was three sets long. Even if you do not like the last set and what it stands for, the three sets that start everything are impoortant when it comes to the X-Files. In fact, the story in the story in connective and essential here.When it comes to this set, it does have some overlap with Black Oil and Abduction. You see the Black Oil more and have the things starting to play out. This means you have a nice piece of media and it points out something you might want ot look at. I personally enjoy the fact that everything hits here, and that some really odd stuff happens in this. In fact, some of the things change a lot of what happens and show exactly what the aliens and what the clones can do. It is good stuff.I guess the real question here is whether or not you need this and the answer is - maybe. I cannot envision skipping this myself, but I like having the inner story plucked out and shown to everyone around me. You are talking aobut 3 seasons of inner workings and, immediately, it is hard to pull into the limelight. True, it is something you can get to and the seasons contain it. Still, it is not on the surface and it is not so easy to handle.I think a person who wants this knows it and, honestly, fans and casual watchers alike may enjoy it. There are some episodes that could be debated on their merit here, but that is one of the many things that could be thrown out and discussed. What cannot be argued is that this is the backbone of the show and it is important in painting an overall picture. Accordingly, I give it a 5/5 and say that like is enough meri to obtain. Just make certain the timeline is there.Thanks and I hope this helps.",5,Completing a 6 season arch that spans Vol. 1 - 3,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3602,"['now', 'know', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'crusade', 'find', 'sister', 'also', 'know', 'aliens', 'are', 'taking', 'people', 'know', 'Black', 'Oil', 'how', 'somewhat', 'alien', 'virus', 'notion', 'out', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Skully', 'shown', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'scientific', 'front', 'open', 'fact', 'are', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'are', 'quite', 'possibly', 'setting', 'up', 'shop', 'Earth', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'quite', 'bad', 'Enter', 'Syndicate', 'conspiracy', 'rooted', 'lore', 'yesteryear', 'fact', 'are', 'big', 'egos', 'waiting', 'unleash', 'something', 'quite', 'bad', 'whole', 'humankind.Beofre', 'starting', 'feel', 'need', 'mention', 'one', 'inster', 'be', 'important', 'sets', 'timeline/', 'people', 'list', 'connective', 'when', 'placed', 'other', 'sets', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'would', 'want', 'get', 'also', 'have', 'one', 'feature', 'might', 'want', 'get', 'sets', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'basically', 'interview', 'Kim', 'Manners', 'Chris', 'Carter', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'not', 'big', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'many', 'insert', 'however', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'something', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'missing', 'bad', 'considering', 'want', 'mine', 'frame', 'look', 'so', 'nice.In', 'set', 'have', 'few', 'major', 'players', 'coming', 'First', 'Elder', 'Well-Manicured', 'Man', 'C.G.B', 'Spender', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'Jeffrey', 'Spender', 'Diana', 'Fowley', 'Gibson', 'Praise', 'Alien', 'Rebels', 'are', 'listed', 'here', 'are', 'part', 'syndicate', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'mentioned', 'Others', 'play', 'odd', 'roles', 'when', 'out', 'Praise', 'others', 'are', 'names', 'coming', 'character', 'past', 'Fowley', 'Rebels', 'also', 'play', 'interesting', 'role', 'ne', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'come', 'together', 'complete', 'huge', 'arch', 'was', 'three', 'sets', 'long', 'Even', 'do', 'not', 'last', 'set', 'what', 'three', 'sets', 'start', 'everything', 'are', 'impoortant', 'when', 'X-Files', 'fact', 'story', 'story', 'connective', 'essential', 'here.When', 'set', 'have', 'overlap', 'Black', 'Oil', 'Abduction', 'see', 'Black', 'Oil', 'more', 'have', 'things', 'starting', 'play', 'out', 'have', 'nice', 'piece', 'media', 'out', 'something', 'might', 'want', 'ot', 'look', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'everything', 'hits', 'here', 'really', 'odd', 'stuff', 'fact', 'things', 'change', 'lot', 'what', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'aliens', 'what', 'clones', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'stuff.I', 'guess', 'real', 'question', 'here', 'not', 'need', 'answer', 'maybe', 'can', 'not', 'envision', 'skipping', 'myself', 'like', 'having', 'inner', 'story', 'plucked', 'out', 'shown', 'everyone', 'are', 'talking', '3', 'seasons', 'inner', 'workings', 'immediately', 'hard', 'pull', 'limelight', 'True', 'something', 'can', 'get', 'seasons', 'contain', 'Still', 'not', 'surface', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'handle.I', 'think', 'person', 'who', 'honestly', 'fans', 'casual', 'watchers', 'alike', 'may', 'enjoy', 'are', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'debated', 'merit', 'here', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'discussed', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'backbone', 'show', 'important', 'painting', 'overall', 'picture', 'Accordingly', 'give', '5/5', 'say', 'like', 'enough', 'meri', 'obtain', 'Just', 'make', 'certain', 'timeline', 'there.Thanks', 'hope', 'helps']","X-Files: Mythology, Volume Three - Colonization"
