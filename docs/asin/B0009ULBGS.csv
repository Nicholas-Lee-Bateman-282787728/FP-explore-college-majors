I immediately purchased it even though my wife strongly protested it's purchase. However, since she was in the midst of purchasing over a 100 dollars worth of products herself she had no alternative but to allow me to indulge in my muppet mania. There I stood in the middle of the aisle beaming like a child who just received his first candy bar. How easily amused I am. Although I give it only 3.6 stars I am still psyched over the purchased of this product. Allow me to explain.The Good: The show is still entertaining, light in subject matter, non-offensive to children, and amusing to watch. A show both children and adults will find entertaining, and can watch together. Who doesn't like seeing Miss Piggy lay Kermit flat on his back, or those two old guys in the balcany insult the show all the way through?The Bad: Some of the jokes and skits are a little weak at times. The show is definately dated which becomes painfully obvious as you watch it at times. Also, the first couple of episodes are weaker than the episodes that appear later on in the set. Some might be disappointed with this set if they don't keep a realistic perspective. Many of us loved the muppets when we were children, and as a child the muppets were the greatest show on earth. Believe me when I tell you if you hold that expectation when you watch this you will be disappointed.Conclusion: This set is a worthy addition to your DVD library, and if you keep the right perspective you should thoroughly enjoy it. However, if one can not keep in mind the limitations of the era in which this show  was originally produced, or the humor that is meant to reach a broad audience from close to 30 years ago, you will be disappointed. This DVD is not a classic in that sense. Ground breaking for it's time? Yes!!! Yet I would be lying if I didn't say it was a little dated in spots. If you view this DVD set with the right expectations you won't be disappointed.3.6 stars is what I give it, 3 stars means it's OK, this DVD set does exceed ""OK"" status in my humble opinion.",3,"The Muppet Show, A classic",1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,2170,"['remember', 'watching', 'show', 'child', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'excited', 'was', 'find', 'local', 'store', 'yesterday', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'even', 'wife', 'strongly', 'protested', 'purchase', 'However', 'was', 'midst', 'purchasing', '100', 'dollars', 'products', 'had', 'alternative', 'allow', 'indulge', 'muppet', 'mania', 'stood', 'middle', 'aisle', 'beaming', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'received', 'first', 'candy', 'bar', 'How', 'easily', 'amused', 'am', 'give', 'only', '3.6', 'stars', 'am', 'still', 'psyched', 'purchased', 'product', 'Allow', 'explain.The', 'Good', 'show', 'still', 'entertaining', 'light', 'subject', 'matter', 'non-offensive', 'children', 'amusing', 'watch', 'show', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'entertaining', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'Who', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'lay', 'Kermit', 'flat', 'back', 'two', 'old', 'guys', 'balcany', 'show', 'way', 'Bad', 'jokes', 'skits', 'are', 'little', 'weak', 'times', 'show', 'definately', 'dated', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'watch', 'times', 'Also', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'appear', 'later', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'realistic', 'perspective', 'Many', 'loved', 'muppets', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'child', 'muppets', 'were', 'greatest', 'show', 'earth', 'Believe', 'when', 'tell', 'hold', 'expectation', 'when', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Conclusion', 'set', 'worthy', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library', 'keep', 'right', 'perspective', 'should', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'mind', 'limitations', 'era', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'humor', 'meant', 'reach', 'broad', 'audience', 'close', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'not', 'classic', 'sense', 'Ground', 'breaking', 'time', 'Yes', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'little', 'dated', 'spots', 'view', 'DVD', 'set', 'right', 'expectations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.3.6', 'stars', 'what', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'OK', 'DVD', 'set', 'exceed', 'OK', 'status', 'humble', 'opinion']",The Muppet Show: Season 1

The picture and sound quality is excellent. The pop up trivia is very interesting, although the flying Kermit head and question marks are a wee bit annoying. The bonus footage is also very cool for those of us who have never seen it. During this first season some of the muppets were still trying to find themselves, Miss Piggy isn't as glamorous as she would become, and she and Janice's voices weren't quite right yet either. I used to watch The Muppet Show every Saturday night at 7:30pm and watching it now, it still makes me laugh. I've never thought of the muppets as being exclusively for kids, to me they were always like the Warner Bros. cartoons, funny for kids yes, but loaded with humor that was over the kid's heads. I'm having a blast watching these shows again. Looking forward to the upcoming seasons!!!

Of course, with any tv show, the first season rarely is as good as future seasons, but the muppet show still shines quite well despite all their problems in the early productions.However, the reason i'm writing this is to warn a few of you. The shows have been edited. Before this was availible on DVD I taped it off of Nickelodeon in the mid-90's. My favorite episode was the one with Vincient Price, especially his final closing song ""you've got a friend in me.""I eagerly looked forward to having that on DVD and was shocked to see that it was removed from the episode. You can literally see where they cut it out, for they show a clip of it at the begining of the episode.I love the muppets and am rather dissapointed that they have cut and edited what I thought was the original episodes.

I told him the Muppet Show is great family entertainment.This puppet vauldeville show may have bad one liners, silly songs, cute skit comedy, and over the top running gags...but it still works twenty years later and doesn't seem old at all. The humor seems like cute puns and gags, but that what the muppets are known for..their  running gags. In a way, this is a family version of Laugh-in (without that Sock-it-to-me!)Kermit, the host who always seem to lose control of the show, has a great troupe of standard muppets (Piggy, Fonzy, Gonzo, DR Teeth and Animal, Statler and Waldorf)combined with other assorted muppets. The cast like any skit show (mad-tv, saturday night live, laugh-in)  can do anything from Dr. Bob, Pigs in space to simple schtick comedy and make it works.The weekly guest star has moments where they can shine-whether its  singing, dancing or comedy...and where else can you watch such talents like Joel Grey, Rita Moreno, Vincent Price, Paul Williams, ben Vereen, Sandy Duncan, Peter Ustinov and others in true showcases of their talentsand this material does not date itself--how can you date fun?I just hope Disney releases volume two soon!Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD",5,Family Fare which never dates itself,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1282,"['friend', 'asked', 'What', 'could', 'get', 'DVD', 'daughter', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'told', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment.This', 'puppet', 'show', 'may', 'have', 'bad', 'one', 'liners', 'silly', 'songs', 'cute', 'skit', 'comedy', 'top', 'running', 'gags', 'still', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', ""n't"", 'seem', 'old', 'humor', 'cute', 'puns', 'gags', 'what', 'muppets', 'are', 'known', 'for..their', 'running', 'gags', 'way', 'family', 'version', 'Laugh-in', 'Sock-it-to-me', 'Kermit', 'host', 'who', 'always', 'seem', 'lose', 'control', 'show', 'great', 'troupe', 'standard', 'muppets', 'Piggy', 'Fonzy', 'Gonzo', 'DR', 'Teeth', 'Animal', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'combined', 'other', 'assorted', 'muppets', 'cast', 'skit', 'show', 'mad-tv', 'saturday', 'night', 'live', 'laugh-in', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'Dr.', 'Bob', 'Pigs', 'space', 'simple', 'schtick', 'comedy', 'make', 'works.The', 'weekly', 'guest', 'star', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'shine-whether', 'singing', 'dancing', 'comedy', 'where', 'else', 'can', 'watch', 'such', 'talents', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'ben', 'Vereen', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'others', 'true', 'showcases', 'talentsand', 'material', 'not', 'date', 'how', 'can', 'date', 'fun', 'just', 'hope', 'Disney', 'releases', 'volume', 'two', 'soon', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",The Muppet Show: Season 1
913172,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0009ULBGS,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","It is hard for me to imagine that I will say anyting which has not already been said about this set in earlier reviews. I was devoted to watching The Muppet Show when it originally ran (I think it was on Monday night at 7:30, in syndication.) Watching one episode a week made hearing the opening theme and business enjoyable. When you watch all the episodes, one after another, the repeated opening routine becomes very boring. My only benefit derived from that is to see that in fact it is always exactly the same, except for Kermit's announcing the special guest star, and Gonzo's running gag with the gong.Which brings me to the innards. One might say the heart and soul of The Muppet Show was the running gag, spread out over all 22 episodes. Fortunately, most were creative enough to earn a smile or a chuckle, but Miss Piggy's karate chops got really old really fast, after the episode where she did seven in one show.How do I know there were seven? Because one option was to enable on screen notes of facts about the episode, the puppets, the puppeteers, and the guests. One show counted the Karate chops. What these optional notes mean is that you will be sure to get at least two viewings, one without notes, and one with. I recommend you do the first without, because the notes are distracting, and you may miss a punch line.The guests are by far the best part of each show, even though almost all of them perform ""potboilers"" for which they are famous in their past careers. But, Liza Minelli doing ""Mein Herr"" from Cabaret... with Muppets, is quite a treat, Just as seeing Joel Grey doing a number from the same show. It's remarkable that the one guest for which I had the greatest disappointment was on episode 22, with Mummenshanz. There is something to be said for song and dance, and the Mummenshanz mimery tended to be washed out in the context of this first class troupe of puppets.Much is made of cut segments; however there are also many segments included, almost one per episode, where were not shown in the US, only in the UK. I don't feel cheated for those missing segments, however, it did make Charles Aznavour's appearance seem very short.One may almost wish a DVD were prepared with all the repetition removed... and the deleted segments restored.

And getting in touch with that inner kid can be pretty darn fun.I loved this show when it was on television. I enjoyed seeing who would be their next ""special guest"" (from getting a crush on a young Sandy Duncan to laughing out loud over Vincent Price's over-the-top parodies of horror.)But, of course, the real stars of the series are the muppets themselves. Kermit stays pretty much the same throughout. He's the default leader of the show, a charming and gracious, uh, frog.Ms. Piggy is the character with the most growth, as she goes from a simple dancing partner during the ballroom skits, to Kermit's love interest (if they had a complete interspecies relationship, would their offspring be Progs? Or Figs?)Fozzie Bear is the corny comedian who has to deal with his substandard material and the heckling of the in-residence old farts who inhabit the balcony.Gonzo, Dr. Teeth, Ralph the Dog (piano player extraordinaire), the Swedish Chef, Wayne and Wanda, Sam the Eagle, Crazy Harry, and a multitude of other muppet characters never fail to entertain (one of my favorite repeat skit's was Veterinarians Hospital, ""a show about an orthopedic surgeon who's gone to the dogs"", but that might be because I'm IN the medical field!)But if there's one muppet that has continually entertained me, I'd have to say it was Animal, the red-haired, over-active, and sometimes insane drummer in the muppet orchestra. Whether he was chasing around a guest host because she was cute, or dancing under a chandelier and slamming his partner onto the floor, I never failed to at least crack a smile when he showed up on-screen.This DVD set (containing 24 episodes) was a great walk down memory lane, catching up with many actors and actresses I had forgotten about, and getting me back to my inner kid, even if just for a little while.",4,Celebrational!

Though The Muppet Show is a little before my time, all the clever witty banter and running gags that enchanted me when I was younger are still very much present right from the start. Yes, some of the material is dated, and some of the characters we love so much today had yet to be fully developed. I can't tell you how horrified I was to hear a voice other than Frank Oz's come out of Miss Piggy's mouth! But even so, the mastering is wonderful, with crystal clear audio and visual that would make you think it was filmed yesterday.In regards to the editing and the ""completeness"" of this box set that other reviewers have discussed, as a retroactive fan it doesn't bother me too much.

Besides all those wonderful characters, he created a show that could be enjoyed by both adults and children.  This DVD collection shows how this classic show evolved. Kermit the Frog had been on Sesame Street. The Sex and Violence pilot, included here, had cameos from Sesame Street regulars Bert and Ernie.  They also appear in the Connie Stevens episode. Rowlf had appeared with Jimmy Dean and on Purina dog food commercials. The Muppet Show also gave us Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the Swedish Chef, Statler, Waldorf, and many more.  A few characters, such as George the janitor, Hilda the wardrobe lady, Mildred, and Sam the Eagle's favorite singing duo Wayne and Wanda were dropped after the first season.  Some made brief appearances later. One word comes to mind:  ecclectic.  There must have been a fortune spent on music rights.  We get songs by:  Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Barry Manilow, the Beatles, Roger Miller (a future Muppet Show guest), Stan Freberg, Scott Joplin, and many more.  Various Broadway shows and movies get represented.  Wait until you see Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem do Tenderly! Jim Nabors sings Thank God I'm A Country Boy.  I was surprised to hear Twiggy sing so well. She's actually recorded several albums.  There are some great guests.  We have wonderful picture and sound quality.  The bonus features are quite good. Note:  the Muppet Morsels don't show up on all DVD players.  I found this out the hard way.  You can learn a lot about the show and its characters' evolution from this material.  There is even a version of ""Six Degrees of Muppet Guests."" Many have connections with other guests.  Several worked with the Muppets before and after their appearances on the Muppet Show.  I would like to add some information.  Paul Williams sang An Old Fashioned Love Song.  It was a hit for Three Dog Night.  He also wrote You And Me Against The World.  Kermit sang it with Helen Reddy on a later episode.  We also see segments that originally ran only in the UK.  This program was produced in London, England. One was the song Big Blue Frog.  I recall seeing it on another episode.  You'll watch these episodes more than once.  Enjoy hearing Mahna Mahna again.  I look forward to seeing the future seasons.

Sitting down to watch the Muppets was a weekly ritual the whole family enjoyed.  Everyone could enjoy their humor and the music.  More than that though, the Muppets could be inspiring and touching at times as well.  There really is no way to adequately express how wonderful the Muppets can be.So why am I only giving this collection 3 star?  Because despite the claim on the box of being ""restored and remastered,"" some of the episodes have been butchered.  I saw the Vincent Price episode when it was originally shown, and it closed with Vincent and the Muppet monsters singing ""You've Got a Friend.""  It was, for me, one of the most enjoyable scenes in the series.  The sequence was included in the Columbia House ""Best of the Muppets"" series, but it is excluded from this set.  Likewise, the Jim Neighbors episode originally opened with Jim singing, ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""  Re-runs on Nickelodeon included this sequence, but the sequence is missing from this set.  I can only guess what is missing from the other episodes in the set.Mind you, these omissions do not keep one from enjoying the set, especially children who did not see the series when it originally aired and do not realize that they are missing.  And, I must admit, the screwy antics of the Swedish Chef and the weekly face offs between Fozzie Bear and Stadler and Waldorf still make me smile.

913194,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B0009ULBGS,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[10, 10]","Finally. It seems like every show ever put on TV except the Muppet Show has seen a DVD release. Now at last we have Season One of the most bizarre, visually stunning, and entertaining thing to ever grace a television screen. The Muppet Show looks and feels like no other show. It all began in 1976, well before the computerized entertainment age. So all of the characters, monsters, set pieces, voices, and stunts were done by people using actual physical materials. No bits or bytes here. What Jim Henson and Company accomplished with this medium still remains impressive some thirty years later. This DVD set allows fans to see the spectacle unfold from the show's brilliant pitch reel to the pilot and finally to the show itself.The world of the 1970s variety show might seem quaint and dated to the hyper-paced no cut longer than 2 seconds media world of today. Entertainment in this genre meant dancing, singing, puns, slapstick, and ridiculous situations. Special effects comprised no more than analog wipes, dissolves, multi-framed keys, or excessive color saturation. The Muppet Show showcases the technology of the day and the crew used what they had at their disposal to great effect. But the main attraction were the Muppets themselves. To have humans and puppets share a stage involved a high degree of complexity. The stage had to be raised and specially built to accomodate all of the interaction. And Henson took puppetry to its extreme. He had plenty of practice on his then popular Sesame Street (it premiered in 1969 and still runs today). But where the main focus of Sesame Street remained children (but plenty existed there for adults as well) The Muppet Show targeted adult audiences directly. And adult entertainment in 1976 meant the variety show (even though the genre was in a bit of a decline; the early 1980s saw the obliteration of nearly all variety shows).At first the show had trouble attracting guest stars. The idea of appearing on stage with a bunch of puppets probably didn't appeal to the sometime self-indulgent celebrity ideal of the time. Only after the show became a huge hit a year or so later did the big stars agree to appear. So Season One features some now obscure names (another sign of how the times change): the late Juliet Prowse dances with dayglo green giraffes; Paul Williams sings ""Just an Old Fashioned Love Song"" with two Muppet likenesses; 1960s entertainer/model Connie Stevens struggles for the spotlight with 2 giant muppets; dancer/Broadway star Joel Grey goes to a Muppet cabaret (with ""a beautiful orchestra""); Rita Moreno struggles with Animal's hyperactive drumming on ""Fever""; Sandy Duncan has her skirt removed by large muppets during a musical number. Other names will be more familiar to people today: Broadway legend Ethel Merman, Florence Henderson (""Mrs. Brady""), Candice Bergen (of ""Murphy Brown""), Lena Horne, Vincent Price, and the first famous emaciated model Twiggy.But, again, the real attraction are the muppets themselves: Kermit, Mrs. Piggy (her voice changes throughout the first season), Rowlf the dog, Gonzo (who begins as a frustrated artist). Dr. Teeth, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (no Beaker in Season One), Fozzie Bear, Statler and Waldorf (the hecklers), The Swedish Chef (who remains almost unchanged), and countless others. Some of the musical numbers approach the surreal (check out the ""Hugga-Wugga"" song on the Phyllis Diller show for a good mind bending). Others are just hilarious (Ruth Buzzi and Sweetums' violently slapstick ""You're Just Too Good To Be True""). Some have 1970s fashion and music splashed all over them (Florence Henderson's first song may evoke a ""Whoa!""). But the famous ""Pigs in Space"" doesn't appear in this season at all. In the end, Season One displays the show developing its own very unique personality. It hasn't quite made it yet, but by the end of the season it's very close.The pilot shows just how much the show changed from concept to reality. Kermit only appears briefly (promising a shapely female Muppet a spot on a ""Children's educational program"" before sneering at the camera), and the pilot's host becomes the band's conductor in the series. There is little emphasis on music or guest stars, so something drastically changed before the show went on the air. The big highlight of the pilot comes at the end: the camera pulls out to reveal the puppeteers (including Henson of course) manipulating their puppets from underneath. It shows just how bizarre filming this show must have been.Lastly, don't even think about missing Henson's incredible pitch reel. It speaks for itself.So here it is, finally. Season One of the Muppet Show. It's great, it's funny, it's a spectacle, it's a blast from the past. And all fans should watch this show until they have every frame memorized. And now the painful wait for Season Two begins.",5,The spark that ignited the 1970s Muppet craze...,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,4849,"['Finally', 'show', 'ever', 'put', 'TV', 'Muppet', 'Show',

913206,A2J74AQZCTFD52,B0009ULBGS,"Jerry Edwards ""jebsdad""","[198, 233]","The Muppet Show is one of my all-time favorite TV shows. I have seen most of the shows throughout the years and still own a large number on video and DVD. However, I do recognize that the individual shows are not always great - depending on my interest in the guest star and the quality of the variety of sketches. Some of the acts make me laugh and laugh and laugh ... others just feel like a waste of time.The first season of the Muppet Show was in 1976. While most of my favorite shows are from later seasons, there are several shows this season that I look forward to owning on DVD. Plus I look forward to watching the shows in the order they were shown to get a feel for how the show evolved over the years.As I understand it, there were two ""pilot"" shows - The Muppets Valentine Show (which I have seen) and the Muppet Show Sex and Violence (which I don't recall seeing). It would be great if these pilots were included in this 1st Season set, but I don't know yet if they will be.From various reference sources, I have verified there were 24 shows the first season. They are (in order they were shown, as far as I can determine):1. Juliet Prowse2. Connie Stevens - this show also has Bert & Ernie. I don't recall the Sesame Street characters showing up on the Muppet Show. This may be the only show Bert & Ernie was in.3. Joel Grey4. Ruth Buzzi5. Rita Moreno6. Jim Nabors7. Florence Henderson8. Paul Williams9. Charles Aznavour (a French singer/entertainer)10. Harvey Korman11. Lena Horne12. Peter Ustinov13. Bruce Forsythe14. Sandy Duncan15. Candice Bergen16. Avery Schreiber17. Ben Vereen18. Phyllis Diller19. Vincent Price20. Valerie Harper21. Twiggy22. Ethel Merman23. Kaye Ballard24.

913211,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B0009ULBGS,Jonathan Cohen,"[1, 2]","""It's 'The Muppet Show', with our very special guest star, Miss Ethel Merman!"" When was the last time you heard Kermit the Frog intone those words? Too long, it says here. But ""The Muppet Show"" is back with a bang! (""Did somebody say 'Bang?'"")Yes, here on four glorious discs, the initial season of one of the funniest, most inventive, and most colorful TV shows ever. I was a fan back then, but seemed to watch mostly for Kermit and the guest stars. Now, I love to see the dozens- maybe hundreds- of creations, characters and comedy bits that made up this unique outfit, all from the mind of the late and very great Jim Henson.The first thing I'll discuss is the video quality, which is fantastic. Many of the tapes come from the original British sources (the show was produced in the UK). For something that's nearly 30 years old, the shows look and feel brand new! You haven't seen the Muppets until you've seen this. The colors, music and movements come jumping right out of your set- it's like watching it live as it happened!As for the shows themselves, the format was obviously inspired by ""Laugh-In"", arguably my favorite show of all time: quickie comedy skits, quirky musical numbers, running and sight gags. The setting, of course, was backstage at the Muppet theatre, with host/manager Kermit running the show. A few of the regulars, notably Miss Piggy, didn't really jell until about the seventh or eighth segment, but once they did, you can't beat it.My favorites include Rowlf, the piano-playing dog; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, the green ball with the wacky inventions; and so many more.You'll be impressed by the top-drawer guests the Muppets attracted- everyone from Parisian cabaret artiste Charles Aznavour to, as noted and quoted, the one and only Ethel Merman (joined, memorably, by Miss Piggy). Arguably the best single episode here features one of the loveliest chanteuses ever, Lena Horne, who sings the jazz standard ""I'm Glad There Is You"" to...Gonzo? Hey, it worked. Like the best cartoon characters, you always feel that the Muppets are living, breathing things, not just, say, a piece of green felt. Some surprises, too, like Bruce Forsyth, a lanky English music-hall entertainer who fits in with the group better than almost anyone.Of course, the classic numbers are here: ""Mahna Mahna"", one of the most famous Muppet routines, was actually the very first number on the very first show! I guarantee you'll have this silly little tune (from an Italian ""mondo"" movie) in your head right away. How about Kaye Ballard singing ""One Note Samba""with a big blue monster- and playing it on clarinet, flute and tuba? That's right, a tuba. Senhor Jobim must have fainted on that one. Everything from vaudeville to hillbilly to jazz was covered.The ten-plus hours of shows here will keep you busy for a while- you can also watch them with ""Muppet Morsel"" subtitles. A brief but witty ""pitch"", created by Henson with assistance from ""Laugh-In""'s George Schlatter, is also included, as is the pilot, which featured rough versions of the familiar bits but had Nigel the orchestra leader (!) as host. Even the discs themselves have lovely pictures of Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo on them!If you love The Muppets, don't you dare miss this. If you haven't seen them in a while (like me), you're in for a real treat. And if you want to introduce them to a new generation of kids (or adults), what are you waiting for? Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy, Rowlf and all the rest- they're Muppetational!",5,"""IS THIS A SHOW OR A ZOO?""",1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,3498,"[""'The"", 'Muppet', 'Show', 'very', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'Miss', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'heard', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'intone', 'words', 'Too', 'long', 'here', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'back', 'bang', 'Did', 'somebody', 'say', ""'Bang"", 'Yes', 'here', 'four', 'glorious', 'discs', 'initial', 'season', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'inventive', 'most', 'colorful', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'was', 'fan', 'back', 'then', 'seemed', 'watch', 'mostly', 'Kermit', 'guest', 'stars', 'Now', 'love', 'see', 'dozens-', 'maybe', 'hundreds-', 'creations', 'characters', 'comedy', 'bits', 'made', 'up', 'unique', 'outfit', 'mind', 'late', 'very', 'great', 'Jim', 'Henson.The', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'video', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'Many', 'tapes', 'come', 'original', 'British', 'sources', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'UK', 'something', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'old', 'shows', 'look', 'feel', 'brand', 'new', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Muppets', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'colors', 'music', 'movements', 'come', 'jumping', 'right', 'set-', 'watching', 'live', 'happened', 'shows', 'format', 'was', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Laugh-In', 'arguably', 'favorite', 'show', 'time', 'quickie', 'comedy', 'skits', 'quirky', 'musical', 'numbers', 'running', 'sight', 'gags', 'setting', 'course', 'was', 'backstage', 'Muppet', 'theatre', 'host/manager', 'Kermit', 'running', 'show', 'few', 'regulars', 'notably', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'jell', 'seventh', 'eighth', 'segment', 'once', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'it.My', 'favorites', 'include', 'Rowlf', 'piano-playing', 'dog', 'Dr.', 'Bunsen', 'Honeydew', 'green', 'ball', 'wacky', 'inventions', 'so', 'many', 'more.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'top-drawer', 'Muppets', 'attracted-', 'everyone', 'Parisian', 'cabaret', 'artiste', 'Charles', 'Aznavour', 'noted', 'quoted', 'one', 'only', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'joined', 'memorably', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'Arguably', 'best', 'single', 'episode', 'here', 'one', 'loveliest', 'chanteuses', 'ever', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'who', 'jazz', 'standard', ""'m"", 'Glad', 'Gonzo', 'Hey', 'worked', 'best', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'always', 'feel', 'Muppets', 'are', 'living', 'breathing', 'things', 'not', 'just', 'say', 'piece', 'green', 'felt', 'surprises', 'too', 'Bruce', 'Forsyth', 'lanky', 'English', 'music-hall', 'entertainer', 'who', 'group', 'better', 'almost', 'anyone.Of', 'course', 'classic', 'numbers', 'are', 'here', 'Mahna', 'Mahna', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'Muppet', 'routines', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'first', 'number', 'very', 'first', 'show', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'have', 'silly', 'little', 'tune', 'Italian', 'mondo', 'movie', 'head', 'right', 'away', 'How', 'Kaye', 'Ballard', 'singing', 'One', 'Note', 'Samba', 'big', 'blue', 'monster-', 'playing', 'clarinet', 'flute', 'tuba', 'right', 'tuba', 'Senhor', 'Jobim', 'must', 'have', 'fainted', 'one', 'Everything', 'vaudeville', 'hillbilly', 'jazz', 'was', 'covered.The', 'ten-plus', 'hours', 'shows', 'here', 'will', 'keep', 'busy', 'while-', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'Muppet', 'Morsel', 'subtitles', 'brief', 'witty', 'pitch', 'created', 'Henson', 'assistance', 'Laugh-In', 'George', 'Schlatter', 'also', 'included', 'pilot', 'featured', 'rough', 'versions', 'familiar', 'bits', 'had', 'Nigel', 'orchestra', 'leader', 'host', 'Even', 'discs', 'have', 'lovely', 'pictures', 'Kermit', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'Gonzo', 'love', 'Muppets', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'miss', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', ""'re"", 'real', 'treat', 'want', 'introduce', 'new', 'generation', 'kids', 'adults', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'Long', 'live', 'Kermit', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'Rowlf', 'rest-', ""'re"", 'Muppetational']",The Muppet Show: Season 1

913213,A4Q2UOVXW9477,B0009ULBGS,Justin E. Miller,"[4, 9]","Ahh, yes... nostalgia. When I was a kid I would watch The Muppet Show and laugh and laugh and laugh. Now, as an adult, I find myself again laughing and laughing and laughing. The weirder part is, the stuff I'm laughing at doesn't seem to be the same things I remember laughing at as a kid.The Muppet Show Season One comes with twenty-four episodes, plus the original pilot, a pitch reel, a promo gag reel, and my personal favorite part, ""Muppet Morsels"" mode. Muppet Morsels mode is kind of like the old VH1 television show ""Pop-Up Video"" that gives you interesting facts and points out errors that a lot of people wouldn't otherwise have caught. I found myself a lot of times reading what a fact said, then having to go back just to see what it said. There's a lot of things like ""Look! There's Jim Henson's head in the background. Oops!"" or the running count of the number of times Miss Piggy karate chopped someone. It's really a cool feature.I think I actually prefer the on-screen commentary vs a separate audio track for commentary. When you have a secondary audio being played over top of the screen, a lot of the time it's hard for me to follow along with what's going on because it's hard to make out the dialogue sometimes. I'd always find myself watching commentaries with subtitles on, so this is an easier, more convenient way for me to do this. I am a fan of both methods of commentary, but I am thinking it is a better way to have it pop up onto the screen for you to read.Another feature I would have liked to have seen would be a separate video angle from the performers perspective. As an adult, I now realize that Muppets aren't actually real, which is something I didn't seem to get when I was five years old sitting in front of the TV watching Big Bird talk about Snuffy on Sesame Street. With that being said, it would really be cool that if any kind of video footage exists of the under the stage performers, they should try to integrate that into the releases of the remaining seasons of the show.When it came down to the actual shows, I found a lot of the performances by the guest stars to really be dated, but that's to be expected since the shows were originally aired almost thirty years prior. For the most part though, the Muppet-exclusive performances still stand the test of time. One of the things I learned after getting this set was there were skits created exclusively for the United Kingdom. I'm not sure why they actually did this, but it could be due to the requirement of having to fill time that would otherwise be filled with commercials here in the United States.My favorite skits out of the entire season were: Mahna Mahna (Episode 1), all of the Swedish Chef skits, as well as the facts I'd learned about them, the Fozzie Bear heckling. My favorite episode overall would probably be the Bruce Forsyth episode (#13).The Muppet Show Season One is a buy.

The first few episodes are rather annoying to watch, some of the charachters (eg- Miss Piggy) have different voices, many of the jokes include terrible puns, but once you hit disc 3 and disc 4 things get better.I must say to the original creators of the show, being a musical theater fan, I loved your choice of guest stars and muiscal numbers.

You already KNOW what to expect, and you will buy this set pretty much no matter what.If you are not old enough, you are in for a treat. You see, back in the day when your parents were snot-nosed brats themselves, people had a thing called ""talent"". They would put this talent on display on a wonderful box called ""television"". One result of this global talent competition was the Muppet Show. Kiddies, sit back, watch, learn, and be amazed at what truly good television was back in the day.The Muppets didn't need to drop the ""F""-bomb, abuse or demean people to be funny. Today, that is called a ""novel concept"", but back then it was par for the course. You either had the ability to make people laugh, or you did not. Jim Henson was one of the very rare people who had this ability, even if most TV executives at the time couldn't see it. Thank God for videotape and now DVD, or you young people would totally miss out.Some of the best entertainers in the world put in appearances on the Muppet Show. Shoot, most of you won't even know who Sandy Duncan, Kaye Ballard, or Jim Nabors was, or why they were popular. It's all about the talent, my young friends. It's all about the talent. Yes, the trivia pop-ups are killer, but my only beef with the DVDs at all is the pop-up Kermit head gets really old, really fast after... oh, the 500th time. On this point, and this point alone, less would really have been more.So what do you really get for under $50? You get the best history lesson (vis-a-vis popular culture) of your entire lives.

Here, you had large puppets doing the dances, singing the songs, telling the jokes, and performing the skits.  And they do it well.It's hard to describe the typical episode because they have some variety.  Each episode features a special guest star (more on that later) who is involved in a few of the scenes.  There are usually a variety of skits and at least one or two song and dance numbers.  And there's the behind the scenes drama.  We are always treated to some backstage antics as poor host Kermit the Frog has to put up with the temperamental stars of the show.  Whether its stand up comic Fozzie Bear who thinks no one wants him around to a band who has decided the theme song isn't hip enough so they plan to quit, he's got to make sure the show goes on.There are some regular skits.  There's always a segment where we are treated to jokes by people at a dance.  There are lots of Special News Bulletins with some wacky news items.  Veterinarian's Hospital is an excuse for really bad puns, so naturally, I love it.  And everything is commented on by Statler and Waldorf, the two gentlemen in the balcony who heckle everything, especially poor Fozzie as he tries to tell some jokes.I do know enough about the show to know that some things haven't fully developed yet.  Miss Piggy's looks change later.  Beaker isn't helping Dr. Bunsen Honeydew in the lap yet.  And my favorite recurring segment, ""Pigs in Space"" isn't anywhere to be seen.  But what is here is still very funny.As I mentioned earlier, each episode has a guest star.  While I recognize some of them, like Joel Grey, Florence Henderson, Candice Bergen, or Valerie Harper, I don't know who most of them are.  After all, the show is 30 years old.  But that doesn't matter because the jokes are still funny and the songs are still great.As long as we're mentioned the songs, be on the look out for the classic ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" and the Muppet version of ""Mahna-Mahna.""  Plus this set is a rare chance to hear the words to ""Never Smile at a Crocodile.""The set contains 24 half hour episodes on four discs.  All the episodes come with ""Muppet Morsels"" which are trivia tidbits that appear on screen every so often.  The final disc feature the original pitch reel and the original pilot, which is much different and not nearly as funny.  Finally, there are some fun promos that aired during the first season.I avoided getting this season for a long time.  Why?

913229,A3E832FY3AIKFT,B0009ULBGS,"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad""","[3, 3]","Even the most loyal of fans would have to admit that lately the Muppets have produced some rubbish. The spark that made the Muppets so special when they revolutionised TV in the '70's seems to have died with Jim Henson and, since his death, only 'Christmas Carol' and 'Treasure Island' have come close to the magic. Certainly 'Wizard of Oz' and the Christmas special from a few years ago have been insults to the Henson name in trying to be 'cool' and roping in z-grade celebs.It is so comforting then, to sit down and see why we feel in love with Kermit and co all those years ago. This boxed set is testament to the genius of Henson and (sadly) shows up the current Muppet output as the trash that it is. Very little can be said about the show other than it was innovative and extremely well done. Fantastic production values and such starry guests would be impossible to recreate now (see the appauling 'Muppets Tonight') and the writing and Muppet performers would never be better.It's interesting to watch this first season to see the genesis of some of the characters. Some, such as Kermit and Rowlf, had careers prior to the show and are fully formed from the start. Others, such as Waldorf and Statler and Fozzie, are new for the show but basically haven't changed since. The interesting ones are those like Miss Piggy and Gonzo who grow and change as the series progresses and who may even start as almost unrecognisable from those characters we love today (Miss Piggy's changing voice is very disconcerting!).The extras here are slim but make sure you use the Muppet Morsel feature. This gives facts and trivia along the bottom of the screen - particularly helpful when wanting to put the show in the 'historical context' of when it was made or when you want info on the guests or songs being performed. This info tends to repeat itself as the series goes on but I watched all episodes with this feature and it certainly enhanced the pleasure.Also here is 'Sex and Violence', the oddly named pilot. This isn't great but hints at the madness to come. Bizarrely, at the end of this the camera tracks back to reveal the Muppeteers at work - a magic-shattering decision.One last point to recommend this set - not a Pepe the Prawn in sight!

Unfortunately my parents would often overrule my wishes and tune in to M*A*S*H* instead (although I now love M*A*S*H* too).  Now I can get my revenge with Season One of the Muppet Show and force these episode onto the family television.I was afraid that these episodes would not meet my more mature expectations, but I'm happy to report that this is not the case.  Even these early episodes of the Muppet Show are great.  The modus operandi of these show is much like a vaudevilleshow, with some glimpses into the backstage.  Kermit remains one of the greatest television hosts of all time (even against many flesh and blood counterparts).Some of the shows in this set are a little primitive.  It's rather jarring to hear Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy with different voices in the first few episodes.  Additionally, the guest stars of each episode make sparse appearances (althought this is a good thing for a few of the episodes).

913231,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B0009ULBGS,Melissa Niksic,"[5, 5]","Let's begin on a positive note, shall we? I purchased ""The Muppet Show"" DVD set for my fianc&eacute;. Both of us were impressed by the overall quality and snazzy packaging of the DVD set (although the packaging is lacking one major component...I'll get to that in a minute). This four-disc set contains all 24 episodes from the first season of the show, back when ""The Muppet Show"" followed a pretty rigid format and Miss Piggy sounded more like a drag queen than the scrappy, high-pitched suidae she evolved to be. Memorable guest stars from the first season include Florence Henderson, Candice Bergen, and Vincent Price (my personal favorite). The DVD set also contains a decent amount of bonus features, including two never-before-seen episodes and Jim Henson's original pitch reel. Overall, this is a great DVD collection that is a must-have for any Muppet enthusiast.Now for the question everyone has been asking...what's up with that flap?! Like many other Amazon.com reviewers, I was befuddled by the fact that there is a slot in the DVD packaging that was obviously made to hold a booklet of some sort, but there was no booklet included with the set. Thinking that there was a component missing, I probably would exchanged my set if I hadn't stopped to read the other reviews on Amazon and learned that everyone was experiencing this problem. I guess the people who put the DVD set together just ""forgot"" to add a booklet. Sheesh! That makes it pretty hard to navigate the four DVDs because you have no way of knowing what's on them until you actually pop them in the DVD player, which stinks. (That's the only reason I gave this item four stars instead of five.) Perhaps we can write down the details of all the episodes as we watch them and store our notes in that useless little pocket.

This DVD collection demonstrates truly classic entertainment.  But ""Classic"" doesn't mean ""old"" in this case.  It means something that can be enjoyed today as much as when the first aired 30 years ago.Yes, it's true you probably haven't heard of all the guest stars if you're under 30.  But that doesn't matter because the stars of these shows are the Muppets themselves, and they always bring out the best in everyone, including any humans lucky enough to work with them.  The Muppet Show is like Laugh-In, except Laugh-in was a product of its time, and the Muppets are apparently timeless.The humor is broad but clever.  And it's very interesting to see the development of the show in its first year.  Miss Piggy, for instance, was just a supporting character until she proved herself worthy of the spotlight.  And it's great to see Rowlf, my favorite of the bunch, and his songs, many of which were never aired in the U.S. before.  There's also a terrific pop up trivia track for each episode, and the original Muppet Show pilot.  Very neat.I do agree the loss of some songs for legal reasons is disappointing.  But even without them, this is still a great set.Anyway, where else are you going to see Florence Henderson sing ""Happy Together"" with a bunch of monsters or hear jokes from a bear?

913244,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0009ULBGS,Newton Ooi,"[1, 2]","Three TV shows appeared in the mid-1970's that are now considered all-time classics.  The 3 shows are Saturday Night Live, All in the Family, and The Muppet Show.  Each show appeals to a particular segment of the viewing population, with the The Muppet Show directed at children.  But all three share several things in common.  First, they parody all the sins of human beings in general, and Americans in particular.  Second, each show tackled all the major and minor social, economic and political issues of the time.  Whether it be high energy prices, affirmative action, workforce discrimination, marital violence, job loss, inter-racial dating, medical malpractice, or any other issue, each of these shows tackled them.  Surprisingly, The Muppet Show handled these issues in a similar fashion as Saturday Night Live; short comedic skits that often parodied an idea, issue or cultural current.Each show is about 30 minutes in length; i.e. these were shown on PBS so no commercials.  Many of the standard features that people remember from the Muppet Show slowly appear over the course of the first season.  These include the Swedish Chef, Vetenerian Hospital, the romance between Miss Piggy and Kermit, Fozzie's comedy act, and Gonzo's crazy tricks.  Note that they don't all appear in the first episode.  There are some muppet standards that are not present in this first season.  Two examples are the regular skit ""Pigs in Space"" and the character Beaker.  Like all good comedies, each episode has one serious section.  For the Muppet Show 1st season, this is Rowlf's jazz skit.For the child viewer back then, or an adult viewer now, this show is a great window into American culture of the 1970's.  Dancers, actors, singers and other celebrities are featured.  No pro-athletes though, which is surprising given the large number of famous athletes during the 1970s.

The memorable characters like the wise cracking Statler and Waldorf, the brilliant writing, voice acting,and directing, and most of all, the expanded vision of Jim Henson who believed that fictional characters could be brought to life, and that thier personalities could, and can, influence us ""real"" people in such a way so as to bring joy to our lives (even if it is in 25 minute spurts.)",5,Quality show for adults.,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1560,"['are', 'aspects', 'show', 'parents', 'not', 'however', 'might', 'find', 'objection', 'when', 'choosing', 'program', 'younger', 'viewers', 'certainly', 'was', 'intended', 'youngsters', 'were', 'older', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'age', 'were', 'few', 'violent', 'moments', 'show', 'How', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'beating', 'up', 'drunk', 'bar', 'scary', 'ineptitude', 'Dr.', 'Bob', 'Ralph', 'Dog', 'Veteranarian', 'Hospital', 'Harry', 'bomb', 'specialist', 'Animal', 'taking', 'girlfriend', 'trip', 'Avery', 'Schriver', 'duel', 'Jack', 'giant', 'muppet', 'even', 'song', 'Ralph', 'Dog', 'called', 'Me', 'Bob', 'where', 'Bob', 'leaving', 'just', 'older', 'children', 'especially', 'adults', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'show', 'show', 'perfect', 'entertainment', 'variety', 'show', 'best', 'tradition', 'best', 'variety', 'ever', 'Song', 'dance', 'comedy', 'even', 'few', 'serious', 'moments', 'type', 'show', 'where', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'entertained', 'fullest', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'joy', 'guest', 'stars', 'not', 'only', 'added', 'value', 'entertainment', '70', '80', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'well.There', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'title', '5', 'stars', 'memorable', 'characters', 'wise', 'cracking', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'directing', 'most', 'expanded', 'vision', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'who', 'believed', 'fictional', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'life', 'thier', 'personalities', 'could', 'can', 'influence', 'real', 'people', 'such', 'way', 'so', 'bring', 'joy', 'lives', 'even', '25', 'minute', 'spurts']",The Muppet Show: Season 1

Some performers, as to be expected, are better than others (the best in the collection are Ethel Merman, Florence Henderson, Ruth Buzzi, and Vincent Price) but in general, the whole collection pleases.  It's also interesting to see them work out the kinks as the show goes on.  In the first few episodes, many of the sketches Henson did on Sam and Friends or the Ed Sullivan Show are repeated.The one slightly disappointing part of the set is that some sketches had to be left out because of copyright laws.

913262,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0009ULBGS,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[5, 5]","Now that I have the season one DVD set I can give you low down on this sensational collection. I won't go much into the episodes themselves since there are plenty of episode lists for you already. Suffice it to say there are some gems on this DVD. Also the extras are delightful.The episodes look very clean and the audio is well balanced. I don't recall whether or not the show was remastered for this DVD set, but I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest. It really looks like you are watching the shows for the time in all their pristine glory.This being the first season you will notice a few differences to the later seasons like how Fozzy Bear and Miss Piggy look and how Janice and some other characters sound. I kinda like seeing the earlier processes and how they evolve later on. Also there seems to be more of an irreverent charm in these episodes as well (then again I think the Muppets have always been like that). If you ever watched the Muppets you know that while you get some great comedy and wit most of the time there are those moments that seem dry. Considering these eps were done in the mid-70's that dryness might show up even more with dated material. Trust me, there is still PLENTY of fun content even if you feel the variety show format is old.The episodes are great and I'm very happy to own them, but the extras you get really stand out as something really special and entertaining too. My personal favorite is the pitch reel Jim Henson used to sell the show to the TV executives. It's a riot! It shows just how clever and daring the show can be.The reel even takes jabs at the very execs Henson is trying to win over. Classic!! The pilot episode is another treat as well. The pacing of the pilot is a lot like Cartoon Network's ROBOT CHICKEN with very fast cuts between gags. I like the differences between the pilot and actual show like Kermit having a cameo appearance instead of being the host and how Sam the Eagle had a bigger and more laid back role in the show.The other extras are great as well. There is a ""gag"" reel that seems more like commercial spots for early episodes, but their are fun to watch anyway. The Fun Facts is essentially a subtitle track (with an occasional splash of Kermit on the screen) you can have play on the episodes that give you TONS of information about the show, the current episode, and more. The Fun Facts are as informative and interesting as the best director or cast commentaries you can come up with from any DVD anywhere. It's that good.The DVD set itself is put in an interesting DVD case that supposedly simulates Kermit's muppet skin. I don't think it's actual felt but it's a really neat design none the less. The 4 DVDs are kinda squished together within what would normally be a 2 DVD case by having two DVDs overlap each other. It's a neat design, however getting at disk 2 or 4 means you have to take out disk 1 or 3 to get to them. Small price to pay for a space-saving design.Here's the deal. If you're a fan of The Muppet Show this DVD set is essential. You get a lot of good content for the price. The quality of this DVD set is excellent. It definitely beats out those ""Best of The Muppets"" DVDs we have had to endure all this time (incomplete, lacking extras, etc). You like the Muppets? GET THIS DVD.

The show was brilliant and, sadly, there's been nothing like in the last 25 years.The first season DVD collection is loaded with great stuff. If you've never seen ""The Muppet Show"" before, each episode followed a basic formula of guest star solo song or dance, a guest star/muppet sing-a-long, and a handful of short comedic sketches.  Sure, some of the jokes are real groaners, but that's part of the charm of the show.Watching these episodes from 1976 -- wow! 30 years ago already -- is like opening a time capsule.  The clothes, the music, the jokes, are all reflective of that era.  Paradoxically, although ""dated"" in those ways, the shows seem timeless.

I loved THE MUPPET SHOW as a child.  Years later my appreciation and fascination with the show has only increased.  The first season of the show might not have been the best of the series, some of the jokes aren't as funny and some of the best re-occurring sketches did not even appear.  For the most part, most of the performers were just beginning to become acquainted with their characters and in some places the unfamiliarity shows.  Some characters do not yet exist in Season One, for instance Dr. Honeydew's assistant Beaker (he arrives in Season Two) or the chickens that Gonzo adores so much.  Other characters appear in Season One, but are rarely seen again or sometimes disappear, e.g. George the Janitor or Wayne's performance partner Wanda.  None of this takes away from how delightful it is to watch the first season of THE MUPPET SHOW in its entirety.  Watching (and often re-watching) these shows is like traveling back through time and watching some monumental event once again on television, such as the Berlin Wall crumbling.

The list of guest stars for the season is listed below.Episode 1--Juliet ProwseEpisode 2--Connie StevensEpisode 3--Joel GreyEpisode 4--Ruth BuzziEpisode 5--Rita MorenoEpisode 6--Jim NaborsEpisode 7--Florence HendersonEpisode 8--Paul WilliamsEpisode 9--Charles AznavourEpisode 10--Harvey KormanEpisode 11--Lena HorneEpisode 12--Peter UstinovEpisode 13--Bruce ForsythEpisode 14--Sandy DuncanEpisode 15--Candice BergenEpisode 16--Avery SchreiberEpisode 17--Ben VereenEpisode 18--Phyllis DillerEpisode 19--Vincent PriceEpisode 20--Valerie HarperEpisode 21--TwiggyEpisode 22--Ethel MermanEpisode 23--Kaye BallardEpisode 24--MummenschanzMy favorite episodes from this season include the ones with Rita Moreno, Jim Nabors, Florence Henderson, Peter Ustinov, Sandy Duncan, and Vincent Price.  The last episode in the series has the Swedish theatrical-mime troupe, Mummenschanz as the guests.  Mummenschanz was probably the most unusual guests to ever host THE MUPPET SHOW.  When I was younger and saw this episode it actually frightened me a bit, with all the strange masks and such, but now watching it again, even though it isn't one of my favorites, I really enjoyed the performances.Each episode is pretty much shown in its entirety, except for six of the shows which had songs which can no longer be shown because of copyright issues.  In addition, every episode includes a segment from the U.K. that did not air when the shows were scene in the U.S.  Watching it on DVD is the first time Americans are able to see these U.K. spots.The DVD set includes an option called ""Muppet Morsels"" that can be played with each episode.  This morsels are kind of like the bubbles from VH1's Pop-Up Video, but aren't nearly as annoying.  Some of the information the morsels provide becomes redundant such as telling when each episode was filmed and when it first aired in New York City.  Also, after watching enough episodes it becomes apparent that Disney is now in control of The Muppets because there are always little plugs for Disney films, shows, etc.  For instance, in providing information about a guest host a morsel might mention the productions the host is most well known for and then the next morsel says something like, ""so-and-so also starred in (Disney film), (Disney film), and (show now owned by Disney).""  These plugs are subtle and not obvious, but they are there.Also included as a special feature is the original Muppet pitch reel that Jim Henson used to pitch the show to the executives at CBS.  Almost the entire pitch reel is available, but there is a very short afterwards from Kermit that has been cut because he asked ""What the h**l was that?"".  Nevertheless, even with the Kermit footage missing, it is a joy to be able to own this piece of marketing because it illustrates not only how creative Jim Henson was, but also that he was a savvy businessman.  Season One also includes the second Muppet Show pilot, ""Sex and Violence"".  There was a previous pilot, ""The Valentine Show"" that is supposedly going to be an extra feature on THE MUPPET SHOW: SEASON TWO.  Finally, the last of the special features is a promo gag reel, which really isn't a gag reel at all but is a series of promo spots highlighting upcoming episodes from season one.THE MUPPET SHOW is a classic piece of American television.  It's a great item to own and watch together with families, but if you're a Muppet fan, it's a must-have item.",5,It's Time To Raise the Curtain!,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,4864,"['grew', 'up',

If you're a muppets fan and care about the fuzzy packaging, buy early -- my season 1 set lacks it.The packaging is otherwise good.DVD video and sound quality are exceptional for a videotaped program this age.But as others have said time and time again, it's been butchered.

Cutting up episodes like this is rather like selling a prosthetic hand after chopping off two of the fingers.

It's great to see how certain characters like Miss Piggy developed in looks and personality over time.

913276,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0009ULBGS,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[32, 33]","Humor in whatever form it takes has a universal appeal. The Muppets had to work hard for their laughs. Not because they weren't funny but because nobody was really interested in a comedy aimed at adults and children with furry Muppets. When the show premiered in America in 1976, it caught on quickly with its audience delighting both adults and children. What's fascinating is that the show had a hard time attracting guest stars during its first season. After Rudolf Nureyev appeared all of that changed but during the first season Henson and his staff would have to rely on friends in the entertainment business to be guest stars in this bizarre variety show.What's amazing is how well this show has aged. Despite some references to events that are nearly thirty years old, ""The Muppet Show"" remakes funny because of its combination of the absurd and everyday. That along with talking Muppets channeling the surreal world of The Marx Brothers allowed ""The Muppet Show"" to transcend children's programming and appeal to a universal audience.""The Muppet Show"" was shot on videotape in the mid-70's so it's no surprise that the show looks soft and the colors aren't as vibrant as they should be but the show looks very good overall. The image quality is fairly consistent throughout.""The Muppet Show"" looks, for the most part, pretty good given the age of the source material. The mono sound has been beefed up a bit but, aside from that, it appears au natural.No retrospective featurettes or new interviews with people like Frank Oz but we do get one of the pilots made for the series that was never aired. Evidently there were two pilots one of them being ""The Muppet's Valentine Special"" and the pilot entitled ""Sex and Violence"" (since it's the Muppets you know that it has absolutely nothing to do with pointless sex and violence) is included here. What's surprising is that Kermit doesn't host the pilot. He does appear briefly with a prototype for Miss Piggy promising her a job on an ""educational program"".  Hopefully we'll get the second pilot with the second season set. We also get a first season promo gag reel and, more importantly, Jim Henson's original pitch reel. Interestingly, Floyd, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, Astoria and the chef (and even Bert and Ernie who appeared as ""guests"" in one episode appear) and other characters are here but the show is hosted by Nigel a nondescript Muppet that doesn't have half the personality of Kermit. It's clever, funny by the end. This isn't an extra exactly but we do get the songs and short sketches that were aired in the BBC but not in America. The BBC aired the show without commercials and, as a result, the BBC episodes run longer than the US versions by about 3 to 4 minutes. So we are truly seeing these uncut for the first time in the U.S. with the original British segments intact.Perhaps Disney will include the segments shot for Germany and other countries that appeared only overseas as extras for the next set.We get a trivia filled text commentary referred to as ""Muppet Morsels"" which features all sorts of unusual facts about the Muppets and the various shows. While it can't possibly replace a true commentary track (I'd love to hear Frank Oz or one of the other writers/producers do a commentary track with behind-the-scenes information), it's a pretty good compromise. They could do without the question marks that appear on the screen along with the stars and everything else. I could have done without some of the question marks and stars that appear during some of the text commentaries. I would have liked to see a featurette on Jim Henson and other key Muppet operators.Disney has done a very good job with the first season of ""The Muppet Show"". The show looks surprisingly spry on DVD given the age of the original videotapes. Truly Jim Henson and his collaborators were comedic geniuses and the lasting testament to that is this very funny variety show that captures this classic series in its formative years.",5,"Great season, good extras",1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,3987,"['Humor', 'form', 'universal', 'appeal', 'Muppets', 'had', 'work', 'hard', 'laughs', 'Not', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'nobody', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'comedy', 'aimed', 'adults', 'children', 'furry', 'Muppets', 'When', 'show', 'premiered', 'America', '1976', 'caught', 'quickly', 'audience', 'delighting', 'adults', 'children', 'What', 'fascinating', 'show', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'attracting', 'guest', 'stars', 'first', 'season', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'appeared', 'changed', 'first', 'season', 'Henson', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'rely', 'friends', 'entertainment', 'business', 'be', 'guest', 'stars', 'bizarre', 'variety', 'show.What', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'aged', 'references', 'events', 'are', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'old', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'funny', 'combination', 'absurd', 'everyday', 'talking', 'Muppets', 'channeling', 'surreal', 'world', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'allowed', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'transcend', 'children', 'programming', 'appeal', 'universal', 'audience', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'was', 'shot', 'videotape', 'mid-70', 'surprise', 'show', 'soft', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'vibrant', 'should', 'be', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'image', 'quality', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'good', 'given', 'age', 'source', 'material', 'mono', 'sound', 'been', 'beefed', 'up', 'bit', 'aside', 'au', 'natural.No', 'retrospective', 'featurettes', 'new', 'interviews', 'people', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'do', 'get', 'one', 'pilots', 'made', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'aired', 'Evidently', 'were', 'two', 'pilots', 'one', 'being', 'Muppet', 'Valentine', 'Special', 'pilot', 'entitled', 'Sex', 'Violence', 'Muppets', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'pointless', 'sex', 'violence', 'included', 'here', 'What', 'surprising', 'Kermit', ""n't"", 'host', 'pilot', 'appear', 'briefly', 'prototype', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'promising', 'job', 'educational', 'program', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'second', 'pilot', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'also', 'get', 'first', 'season', 'promo', 'gag', 'reel', 'more', 'importantly', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'original', 'pitch', 'reel', 'Interestingly', 'Floyd', 'Dr.', 'Teeth', 'Waldorf', 'Astoria', 'chef', 'even', 'Bert', 'Ernie', 'who', 'appeared', 'guests', 'one', 'episode', 'appear', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'show', 'hosted', 'Nigel', 'nondescript', 'Muppet', ""n't"", 'have', 'personality', 'Kermit', 'clever', 'funny', 'end', ""n't"", 'extra', 'exactly', 'do', 'get', 'songs', 'short', 'sketches', 'were', 'aired', 'BBC', 'not', 'America', 'BBC', 'aired', 'show', 'commercials', 'result', 'BBC', 'episodes', 'run', 'longer', 'US', 'versions', 'about', '3', '4', 'minutes', 'are', 'truly', 'seeing', 'uncut', 'first', 'time', 'U.S.', 'original', 'British', 'segments', 'intact.Perhaps', 'Disney', 'will', 'include', 'segments', 'shot', 'Germany', 'other', 'countries', 'appeared', 'only', 'overseas', 'extras', 'next', 'set.We', 'get', 'trivia', 'filled', 'text', 'commentary', 'referred', 'Muppet', 'Morsels', 'sorts', 'unusual', 'facts', 'Muppets', 'various', 'shows', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'replace', 'true', 'commentary', 'track', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'one', 'other', 'writers/producers', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'behind-the-scenes', 'information', 'pretty', 'good', 'compromise', 'could', 'do', 'question', 'marks', 'appear', 'screen', 'stars', 'everything', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'question', 'marks', 'stars', 'appear', 'text', 'commentaries', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'featurette', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'other', 'key', 'Muppet', 'operators.Disney', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'season', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'spry', 'DVD', 'given', 'age', 'original', 'videotapes', 'Truly', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'collaborators', 'were', 'comedic', 'geniuses', 'lasting', 'testament', 'very', 'funny', 'variety', 'show', 'classic', 'series', 'formative', 'years']",The Muppet Show: Season 1
