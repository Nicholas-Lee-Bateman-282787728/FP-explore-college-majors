I assume that maybe the MENUS are in color, so they list the entire DVD as color, but the SHOWS are probably b/w.Which episodes?  Apparently someone is afraid to point out how LITTLE is included.  Five shows are listed, but the total run time of the DVD is listed as 90 minutes.  Even with commercials removed, this is dreadfully short for what we EXPECT to get here.  Also, are FIVE episodes enough to cover holiday-themed episodes from a 14-YEAR series???Why don't we have a COMPLETE season-by-season set of ANY of the seasons?That's what I will wait for........and wait.... and wait.... and wait.........",2,Info sketchy on this one...,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,694,"['others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'problem', 'amazon', 'info.Is', 'b/w', 'color', 'assume', 'maybe', 'MENUS', 'are', 'color', 'list', 'entire', 'DVD', 'color', 'SHOWS', 'are', 'probably', 'b/w.Which', 'episodes', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'afraid', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'LITTLE', 'included', 'Five', 'shows', 'are', 'listed', 'total', 'run', 'time', 'DVD', 'listed', '90', 'minutes', 'Even', 'commercials', 'removed', 'dreadfully', 'short', 'what', 'EXPECT', 'get', 'here', 'Also', 'are', 'FIVE', 'episodes', 'enough', 'cover', 'holiday-themed', 'episodes', '14-YEAR', 'series', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'COMPLETE', 'season-by-season', 'set', 'ANY', 'seasons', 'what', 'will', 'wait', '..and', 'wait', 'wait', 'wait']",N/A

If they include the Thanksgiving episode,Holloween episode, and Valentines Day episode that would have made 12.That would have been half the previous sets. Now if they included birthdayepisodes that weren't included in previous sets and costume parties, and the like I have no doubt they could have made it to 24. There are also anniversaries.

The first one is about the boys want to have Christmas early and they want to work and earn money for it. So Ozzy  calls some store owners and gets one to hire them. Harriet does the same thing and gets that one to hire them too. Well both Ozzy and Harriet don't tell each other what they did. Then a bad storm hits and the owner of the story that Ozzy  had stopped over with the groceries and fines out the boys never showed up. Ozzy gets worried, but Harriet isn't, then Harriet goes over and calls the owner of the store and finds out the same thing. She then gets worried. The boys come home and tells them that they found their own jobs and got hired to watch tv in the show room of a store. The next story is about they all got gifts from Ozzy's  mom. Well the name tags got on two of the wrong gifts. They happen to be the ones for David and Ozzy. David got this one heavy book and Ozzy got this nice sport coat. So Ricky gets to thinking that maybe their grandmother made a mistake about those two gifts. They figure it out that it was and so the gifts then get to the right people and then they find a letter left inside the book and they were right.  The last story is about writing thank you notes. Ricky questioned about tell a lie about says its nice when it didn't fit and how that would be telling a lie. So Ozzy decides to tell the truth to his friend how he did like the gift that they gave, but could when his friend stated how they loved the gift they were given. Then Ozzy decides that it was best to let them think their gift was nice only to find out that their gift got exchanged at the store. The last story is about finding the right Christmas tree. David and Ricky rented this lot from Wally's dad so they could sell trees. David didn't know that Ricky sold the lot and paid back Wally's dad. So all the trees got deliver to their house and they then had to find another lot. Ozzy finds one for them and also does the realitor a favor. He ask if the boys would take the girls around town. So then the find that the trees aren't selling so they come up with an idea to have a show. I believe this is Ricky's first time singing on tv. The girls show up and the boys see that they are pretty and go out with them. The trees sell and then Ozzy sings for everyone.",5,Love it!!!,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2336,"['three', 'stories', 'Christmases', 'first', 'one', 'boys', 'want', 'have', 'Christmas', 'early', 'want', 'work', 'earn', 'money', 'So', 'Ozzy', 'store', 'owners', 'one', 'hire', 'Harriet', 'same', 'thing', 'one', 'hire', 'too', 'Well', 'Ozzy', 'Harriet', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'other', 'what', 'did', 'Then', 'bad', 'storm', 'hits', 'owner', 'story', 'Ozzy', 'had', 'stopped', 'groceries', 'fines', 'out', 'boys', 'never', 'showed', 'up', 'Ozzy', 'worried', 'Harriet', ""n't"", 'then', 'Harriet', 'owner', 'store', 'out', 'same', 'thing', 'then', 'worried', 'boys', 'come', 'home', 'found', 'own', 'jobs', 'got', 'hired', 'watch', 'tv', 'show', 'room', 'store', 'next', 'story', 'got', 'gifts', 'Ozzy', 'mom', 'name', 'got', 'two', 'wrong', 'gifts', 'happen', 'be', 'ones', 'David', 'Ozzy', 'David', 'got', 'one', 'heavy', 'book', 'Ozzy', 'got', 'nice', 'sport', 'coat', 'So', 'Ricky', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'grandmother', 'made', 'mistake', 'two', 'gifts', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'gifts', 'then', 'get', 'right', 'people', 'then', 'find', 'letter', 'left', 'book', 'were', 'right', 'last', 'story', 'writing', 'thank', 'Ricky', 'questioned', 'about', 'tell', 'lie', 'nice', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'lie', 'So', 'Ozzy', 'tell', 'truth', 'friend', 'how', 'did', 'gift', 'gave', 'could', 'when', 'friend', 'stated', 'how', 'loved', 'gift', 'were', 'given', 'Then', 'Ozzy', 'was', 'best', 'let', 'think', 'gift', 'was', 'nice', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'gift', 'got', 'exchanged', 'store', 'last', 'story', 'finding', 'right', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'David', 'Ricky', 'rented', 'lot', 'Wally', 'dad', 'could', 'sell', 'trees', 'David', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ricky', 'sold', 'lot', 'paid', 'back', 'Wally', 'dad', 'trees', 'got', 'deliver', 'house', 'then', 'had', 'find', 'lot', 'Ozzy', 'one', 'also', 'realitor', 'favor', 'boys', 'would', 'take', 'girls', 'town', 'So', 'then', 'find', 'trees', 'are', ""n't"", 'selling', 'so', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'have', 'show', 'believe', 'Ricky', 'first', 'time', 'singing', 'tv', 'girls', 'show', 'up', 'boys', 'see', 'are', 'pretty', 'go', 'out', 'trees', 'sell', 'then', 'Ozzy', 'sings', 'everyone']",N/A
