1355274,A1NJLH4H82S1CV,B003NHMYI8,"I. Stanley ""MotleyHoople""","[14, 17]","Our memories can sometimes play tricks on us when we think back to our old favorite TV shows from decades past. We remember how great these shows were, how funny and original they were, and moan about how much we wish that one series or another would be released on DVD. And sooner or later these old shows usually do make it onto DVD, and we buy them with great anticipation of reliving something wonderful from years ago. And unfortunately, we sometimes find that our faded memories of a certain show are much better than the show actually was. Perhaps because the humor was of a certain time and has become dated. Or perhaps as we grow older our tastes change, and what we once considered to be hilarious we now find to be rather sophomoric.I am very happy to say that this is not the case with The Norm Show. I purchased this DVD set expecting it to be as funny as I'd remembered, and it is! I looked forward to favorite gags or punchlines that I remembered from the series, and they still made me smile or chuckle when I heard them again. Jokes I'd forgotten made me laugh out loud.It is testimony to how smartly the show was written that the jokes work as well now as they did when the show originally aired a decade ago. With the exception of one Pokemon sequence, they smartly chose to avoid using cultural references of the time that would lose their relevance in later years. Even a hilarious scene where Norm's straight laced boss Mr. Denby dresses as Gene Simmons of KISS for Halloween is as relevant now as it was then, thanks to KISS' continued popularity, and Gene Simmons' own exposure on his Family Jewels reality show.As for the actors, they all play their characters perfectly and contribute greatly in every scene they appear. There is no deadwood in this cast, everyone on screen is integral to the storyline and the humor.And Norm Macdonald plays the role that he was born to play in Norm Henderson. The character's smirking, wise cracking, smart alec demeanor is an extension of Norm Macdonald's style of comic delivery when he did the news update segment on Saturday Night Live. But in the character of Norm Henderson he found an outlet to sharpen the wit and fine-tune the punchlines.I loved The Norm Show when it aired on television more than a decade ago, and I'm happy to say that these episodes are as funny now as they were then and still made me laugh.

1355276,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B003NHMYI8,Kasey G,"[3, 4]","IMO, the TV sitcom landscape in the late '90s was a wasteland. My old favorites ""Roseanne"" and ""Murphy Brown"" were getting long in the tooth, and I found the vastly overrated ""Friends"" unwatchable.It was by chance I discovered ""The Norm Show"" at a friend's house shortly before it was cancelled. I was surprised to see Laurie Metcalf, so wonderful in ""Roseanne"" among the cast. Since the show was never syndicated, I was only able to catch full episodes on two Emmy screener VHS tapes I acquired from eBay about 10 years back.Needless to say, I was thrilled when I learned Shout! Factory was partnering with WB to bring the complete series to DVD in a comprehensive set which consists of all 54 episodes from the three seasons of ""The Norm Show"" (later shortened to simply ""Norm"") which ran on ABC from 1999 to 2001. There are commentaries on select episodes but I wish there was a featurette reuniting the entire cast to discuss the show together.I guess you could say ""The Norm Show"" is my ""Seinfeld"" since I never was a big fan of Jerry's show. The characters in ""Norm"" are similar though, in that they are often self-serving and deceitful to get what they want. Much of the humour is mean-spirited (especially that directed towards Mr. Denby) but never comes off as too bitter.Dare I say Ms. Metcalfe is even more hilarious here than she was on ""Roseanne"". However, it's not all about Laurie. This is truly an ensemble comedy--albeit a quirky one that many people may not ""get""--but let 'em watch ""Friends"" or ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" instead. I have never been a fan of anything than panders to the lowest common denominator.Henderson's delivery takes some time to get used to, but it works well within the show and the chemistry among the actors is terrific.I always got a kick out of the fact that ""Too Bad"" by Doug & the Slugs was used as the series' theme song, because that song was actually a big hit here in Canada, reaching #7 during the summer of 1980. Most Americans had probably never heard of it before this show.Unlike ""Will & Grace"", ""Norm"" did not rely on topical humour, so luckily it hasn't dated much since 1999.Some of the supporting cast (Nikki Cox, Faith Ford) come and go, then return again.Although Max Wright wasn't there for the early episodes, I thought the first season was the funniest, although all were great.A BIG thank-you to Shout!
