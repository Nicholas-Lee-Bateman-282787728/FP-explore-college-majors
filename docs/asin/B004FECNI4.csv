I throughly enjoyed the series but found it difficult to follow because the station running the reruns did not run them in order and thus it was difficult to follow.  Accordingly, when it came out on DVD I had to have it and finally have the sequences straight.  Unfortunately, the series only lasted 3 seasons --- probably due in part because the star, Simon Baker, didn't really like it.

However, there are always the exceptions.  ""Beautiful Blue Mystic"", an episode in this collection, is one of those gems of TV history.  It is worth seeing even if ""The Guardian"" isn't your typical fare (although it helps to see a reasonable amount of the shows as the plot to this particular episode builds up from the others.Innovative, breath-taking, and mind-blowing are all adjectives that can be used to describe that particular episode.  It's difficult to expound on it without giving a critical element away, but the bottomline is:  If you are a fan of ""The Guardian"" this is the crown jewel of the series.  If you are new to the series you will find the entire third season outstanding, but particularly come away from ""Beautiful Blue Mystic"" believing you have just seen one of the finest hours in television history.",5,Beautiful Blue Mystic,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,930,"['t-shirt', 'Stage', 'life', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'art', 'television', 'furniture', 'However', 'are', 'always', 'exceptions', 'Beautiful', 'Blue', 'Mystic', 'episode', 'collection', 'one', 'gems', 'TV', 'history', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'Guardian', ""n't"", 'typical', 'fare', 'see', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'shows', 'plot', 'particular', 'episode', 'up', 'others.Innovative', 'breath-taking', 'mind-blowing', 'are', 'adjectives', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'particular', 'episode', 'difficult', 'expound', 'giving', 'critical', 'element', 'away', 'bottomline', 'are', 'fan', 'Guardian', 'crown', 'jewel', 'series', 'are', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'entire', 'third', 'season', 'outstanding', 'particularly', 'come', 'away', 'Beautiful', 'Blue', 'Mystic', 'believing', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'one', 'finest', 'hours', 'television', 'history']",N/A

1404864,A1AM2YSWG5NRRJ,B004FECNI4,"Sophia ""the thinker""","[6, 6]","Simon Baker is perfect as the corporate attorney forced to do community service at a legal aid center because of a drug conviction. The series juxtaposes the upper class world of wealth and influence with the world of economic and social deprivation and almost utter helplessness against misfortune. His character, Nick Fallon gradually learns to understand that world as he faces his own kind of helplessness. This is one of those ""social message"" stories that in less capable directing/acting hands would be formulaic and smarmy. The Guardian is not like that at all. It is presented as honestly as fiction ever gets while make the viewer think - a lot! - about our social problems and how to deal with them. Sometimes, there are no answers and s---t just happens. It helps to have money at those times. Nick Fallon could deal with his Down's Syndrome baby because he had the money to meet her needs. Someone depending on social service agencies would never fare so well.
