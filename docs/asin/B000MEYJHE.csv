She was so funny in 'She's The Man' and hell, she's even alright in this, but of course her personality isn't quite as defined.The scenery is really beautiful and some will find the actors and actresses beautiful, but the storyline just rolls and rolls until it crashes into a pile of cliched flames.Let me tell you something for a fact: Just because the person you like doesn't want to be with you, DOES NOT mean that you'll instantly fall in love with your best friend whose been pining over you for ages because he's 'always there' for you and is a good catch. Chemistry and love is so much more complicated than that. Why do they always use these stupid storylines? This could have been a good movie. Not great, but good. Everything is fine until near the end and it's all ruined with a dumb fairytale that's highly unrealistic and ruins the whole movie.It's just not a very funny movie, either. Not a lot of comedy, but maybe that's just me...There is a 'just friends' rule for friendship for a reason - no chemistry.

Before Amanda Bynes became just another trashy hollywood actress getting drunk and crashing cars and making statements about loving chocolate men...she was a good actress with some fun movies. She has also always looked normal in filns but here she looks too skinny woth tiny tooth pick legs. I have enjoyed everything else I have ever seen her in (and She's the Man itself is pretty ridiculous), but this is just a poor story with awkward moments that are supposed to be funny. A geeky guy has a crush on his best girl friend. He doesn't realize it until almost the end, but it's red flashing lights obvious where thus is going. She has a crush on a pop star who comes to stay at the resort they work at. She ends up following the pop star onto a boat, he falls off, she jumps in, a storm takes them to a nearby island. He hurts his ankle, they think they are shipwrecked...then she finds out they are on the other side of the island. Thus begins the awkward lies and scenes of her sneaking into town to buy groceries and pretend she picked fruit, caught fish, ground berries for makeup...it is all very awkward and unbelievable. He starts to fall in love with her, enter the second annoying twist. Her geeky friend duscovers her in town showering and agrees to help. The slutty, catty, empty headed nemesis of girl follows him and hatches a plan to pretend she is a stranded french model throwing herself at him and making other girl look bad. The girls fight, pop star professes his like for normal girl...and of course geek boy does the dramatic ""we belong together kiss"" out of nowhere. As the movie progresses it just gets more annoying and more awkward. It tries so hard to use Amanda's well known comedic timing and humor but falls flat every single time. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is one of the most far-fetched, annoying, and just plain stupid I have ever seen. We see the cliched coupling hinted from scene one but everything else the ending wraps up with is...bizarre and very unhappy for everyone but the new cliche couple.Skip this snoozer.
