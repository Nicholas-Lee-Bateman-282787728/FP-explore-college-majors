The script writing is smart, but not self-indulgent .. and Jane Curtin and Susan St. James form a FINE, comedy-type of (female) protagonists. .. Moreover, the plots are fairly-original, and there is .. still .. and enduring quality .. to the entire series .. such as it was.

It was difficult to find in reruns (for some reason) and so I am very glad to be able to pop in a DVD and watch it whenever I like. As a New Yorker, I also like seeing the opening scenes of Kate & Allie walking around the city and talking. By the way, it is clearly typed as Susan Saint James on each of the DVD collections and not Susan St. James, as suggested by another reviewer here. P.S. Jane Curtin is probably the funniest actress since Carol Burnett, my other favorite.",5,Hands Down Kate & Allie is My Favorite TV Show,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,521,"['never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'was', 'difficult', 'find', 'reruns', 'reason', 'so', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'pop', 'DVD', 'watch', 'whenever', 'like', 'New', 'Yorker', 'also', 'seeing', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'walking', 'city', 'talking', 'way', 'clearly', 'typed', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'DVD', 'collections', 'not', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'suggested', 'reviewer', 'here', 'P.S', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'probably', 'funniest', 'actress', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'other', 'favorite']",Kate And Allie: Season 4
1074484,AMF1KU1X1RKWK,B000Q7ZG1U,"Melvin F. Martin ""oldscififan""","[0, 2]","I really purchased this show for only about 30 to 45 seconds(separate story of no interest to anyone). However I did watch all the dvds because I did enjoy the show. I think shows such as this one holds up very well over time. The actors were all very good, story lines were sometimes very forced(how many times can you have single women trying to find a husband to be written differently)and having children and their problems to be found interesting.Shows like this come down to the characters as played by the actors, which in this case does make this show.If the program has not be seen before I think anyone will enjoy these dvds. If you remember seeing the show then you will be a person who enjoyed the actors and characters and will enjoy seeing it again. The purchase price was very important for me and was in the end a good buy.The two leading actress' are very good and the remaining cast all do a very good job.",3,good show not the greatest,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,924,"['really', 'purchased', 'show', 'only', 'about', '30', '45', 'seconds', 'separate', 'story', 'interest', 'anyone', 'However', 'did', 'watch', 'dvds', 'did', 'enjoy', 'show', 'think', 'shows', 'such', 'one', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'time', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'sometimes', 'very', 'forced', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'have', 'single', 'women', 'trying', 'find', 'husband', 'be', 'written', 'differently', 'having', 'children', 'problems', 'be', 'found', 'interesting.Shows', 'come', 'characters', 'played', 'actors', 'case', 'make', 'show.If', 'program', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'dvds', 'remember', 'seeing', 'show', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'characters', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'again', 'purchase', 'price', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'was', 'end', 'good', 'buy.The', 'two', 'leading', 'actress', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'remaining', 'cast', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job']",Kate And Allie: Season 4

1074486,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000Q7ZG1U,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","This 1986-87 Season of this awesome sitcom introduced a new type of nuclear family to the 1980s: a pair of divorced women living with their children together in a somewhat cramped New York brownstone.The mid-season replacement of KATE & ALLIE'S debut in the Spring of 1984 starring Susan Saint James as Kate McArdle and Jane Curtain as Allie Lowell was both a critical and commercial success. The shoulder pads, clunky answering machine, and hairdon'ts give away the decade, but the storylines of grown-up best friends supporting and, at times, sparring with each other during personal and professional crises are timeless.Curtain and Saint James share a wonderful chemistry that makes them easy to watch. At the start of this 6-year sitcom, viewers are introduced to Allie's first post-divorce date, played by a dashing young Kelsey Grammer from CHEERS & FRASIER.Almost 2 decades before the gals on SEX & THE CITY began tackling relationships, Kate summed it up best: &#34;Dating's about finding someone so you never have to date again.&#34; By the time CBS cancelled KATE & ALLIE in the Spring of 1989, Kate and Allie's relationship had gotten a little hackneyed & stale and it was time for the ladies to move on. But those first few seasons were fast, funny, and full of possibilities since the show was still in its honeymoon phase, but perhaps the whole cast & crew of the show was getting tired & the show was running out of steam.",4,Kate & Allie Score,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1437,"['1986-87', 'Season', 'awesome', 'sitcom', 'introduced', 'new', 'type', 'nuclear', 'family', '1980s', 'pair', 'divorced', 'women', 'living', 'children', 'together', 'somewhat', 'cramped', 'New', 'York', 'brownstone.The', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'KATE', 'ALLIE', 'debut', 'Spring', '1984', 'starring', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Kate', 'McArdle', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'Allie', 'Lowell', 'was', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'shoulder', 'pads', 'clunky', 'answering', 'machine', ""hairdon'ts"", 'give', 'away', 'decade', 'storylines', 'grown-up', 'best', 'friends', 'supporting', 'times', 'sparring', 'other', 'personal', 'professional', 'crises', 'are', 'timeless.Curtain', 'Saint', 'James', 'share', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'easy', 'watch', 'start', '6-year', 'sitcom', 'viewers', 'are', 'introduced', 'Allie', 'first', 'post-divorce', 'date', 'played', 'dashing', 'young', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'CHEERS', 'FRASIER.Almost', '2', 'decades', 'gals', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'began', 'tackling', 'relationships', 'Kate', 'summed', 'up', 'best', '34', 'Dating', 'finding', 'someone', 'so', 'never', 'have', 'date', 'again.', '34', 'time', 'CBS', 'cancelled', 'KATE', 'ALLIE', 'Spring', '1989', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'relationship', 'had', 'gotten', 'little', 'hackneyed', 'stale', 'was', 'time', 'ladies', 'move', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'were', 'fast', 'funny', 'full', 'possibilities', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'honeymoon', 'phase', 'perhaps', 'whole', 'cast', 'crew', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam']",Kate And Allie: Season 4
