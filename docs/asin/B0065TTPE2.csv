1510773,A250B73BJZ408E,B0065TTPE2,ck,"[0, 0]","Synopsis:Playful Kiss is based on the Japanese sh'jo manga, Itazura Na Kiss.Oh Ha Ni is a sweet lively and happy high school student yet she is definitely not the smartest student at her school.She has a crush on Baek Seung Jo, the smartest boy in school despite being chased loyally by Bong Joon Gu herself. When she confesses to Seung Jo through a letter, he brings it back to her, after grading it harshly and commenting that he hates stupid girls.When Oh Ha Ni's new house suddenly collapses her father's friend offers for him and Ha Ni to stay with them. But Oh Ha Ni dosent know that her father's friend is actually Baek Seung Jo's dad.As they continue to live under the same roof and attend Parang University together, Ha Ni continues to show affection for Seung Jo although he seems to be more interested in the equally clever and beautiful Yoon Hae Ra.Following Ha Ni's many efforts, Seung Jo finally falls for her in a romantic and protective way.The drama continues to show the young couple marry and go on to a pretty disasterous honeymoon.Product: this DVD came in a very nice quality box, and says Naughty kiss on it. The box is also very colorful and cute with lots of pictures. When you open the box, there are 4 different disks inside. Each disk has a picture of one of the main characters on the front. The reason I give it 4 stars is, because the grammar on the subtitles are incorrect. You can still understand everything on it. The netflix subtitles were much better than the dvds.

An extra bonus in watching Asian movies, to me, is that they have peeked my interest in other cultures too, although it may take a little getting use to reading subtitles.  Sometimes the stories, acting and subtitles are a bit off, however Asian films, for the most part, are solidly entertaining and offensive free.Considering the above, one of my favorite Korean movies is 'Naughty Kiss'.  The movie is cute and lighthearted, w/good acting and leaves one feeling totally stress free.

1510775,AA14STLBMT82U,B0065TTPE2,Elizabeth,"[11, 12]","I decided to watch this drama because of Kim Hyun Joong who also starred in Boys Over Flowers. It was certainly a different experience to watch him play a character who is described as cold and uncaring in this drama. It is definitely entertaining to watch. A brief synopsis: Oh Ha Ni is a girl who has crush on Baek Seung Jo (the high school genius). It basically begins when she summons up the courage to leave him a love letter. He in turn, gives it back to her... with various corrections to her spelling and grammer. He then tells her that he hates stupid girls. You'd think that after that terrible experience Oh HaNi would give up however she continues on her quest to capture his interest by means of sticking to him like glue any chance she gets. To the dismay of Baek Seung Jo, HaNi ends up living with him and his family after Oh HaNi's house collapses. The reason is that SeungJo and HaNi's fathers are long time friends. It is fun to watch as this drama unfolds. You can't always guess what the genius Baek Seung Jo thinks of HaNi as he pretty much treats her like crap. He treats her so badly that you think she would give him up and that is what makes this series entertaining because she keeps trying.",4,Entertaining,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1217,"['decided', 'watch', 'drama', 'Kim', 'Hyun', 'Joong', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Boys', 'Over', 'Flowers', 'was', 'certainly', 'different', 'experience', 'watch', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'described', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'drama', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'girl', 'who', 'crush', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'high', 'school', 'genius', 'basically', 'when', 'summons', 'up', 'courage', 'leave', 'love', 'letter', 'turn', 'back', 'various', 'corrections', 'spelling', 'grammer', 'then', 'stupid', 'girls', ""'d"", 'think', 'terrible', 'experience', 'Oh', 'HaNi', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'however', 'quest', 'capture', 'interest', 'means', 'sticking', 'glue', 'chance', 'dismay', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'HaNi', 'up', 'living', 'family', 'Oh', 'HaNi', 'house', 'reason', 'SeungJo', 'HaNi', 'fathers', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'fun', 'watch', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'guess', 'what', 'genius', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'thinks', 'HaNi', 'pretty', 'much', 'like', 'crap', 'so', 'badly', 'think', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'what', 'series', 'entertaining', 'trying']",Naughty Kiss (Mischeivious Kiss / Playful Kiss) - Korean drama (4DVD - Complete Series) All Region with English Subtitles
1510776,A2Y4AGDHAHIFRL,B0065TTPE2,Katie Scarlet,"[0, 0]","I watched Playful Kiss on Hulu and I was really bored with the opening day dreaming scene. In fact I stopped watching it for that reason. But a week or so later, I was in the mood to see a romance, and because of the title, I  went back to it, fast forwarding over those stupid dream scenes. Because I did this, I really enjoyed the series and watched it about two or three times. I loved the high school setting, the mother, the kid brother, the girl's two best friends, and of course, the two main characters. Later, after the faithful hopeless male friend, finally stopped looking like a weirdo and became skillful in something, I liked him, too. He was actually a better person than the sophisticated, good looking, prodigy teenager. I can't help but think, that what helped the main guy realize his feelings for the girl, was that his competitor was going to win the prize. It was annoying that he never verbally admitted his feelings or apologized for his cold treatment of her. I love this drama, even with it's shortcomings. Oh yeah, I wonder if anyone will agree with me, that most of the kissing scenes were lame and unrealistic. With all of those raging teenage hormones, the jealous anger, and the adorable teenage girl in those short skirts, I would have expected to see some passion from the main guy, at least. And as a personal preference, I would have enjoyed seeing the girl continuing on with the spunky attitude she started with. The drama was really good, even if the embarrassing scenes were a little excruciating to watch, and the girl wasn't as smart as she should be. I definitely can recommend this to anyone interested in a romantic comedy. Lots of laughs.By the way, I typed in Naughty Kiss on youtube and it had more scenes in it, but the version I saw, didn't have English subtitles. I wish they had included them. It would be nice to see more scenes of the main male character interact with the main female character, before they became a couple.",4,Amusing,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1977,"['watched', 'Playful', 'Kiss', 'Hulu', 'was', 'really', 'bored', 'opening', 'day', 'dreaming', 'scene', 'fact', 'stopped', 'watching', 'reason', 'week', 'so', 'later', 'was', 'mood', 'see', 'romance', 'title', 'went', 'back', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'stupid', 'dream', 'scenes', 'did', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'watched', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'loved', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'mother', 'kid', 'brother', 'girl', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'course', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Later', 'faithful', 'hopeless', 'male', 'friend', 'finally', 'stopped', 'looking', 'weirdo', 'became', 'skillful', 'something', 'liked', 'too', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'person', 'sophisticated', 'good', 'looking', 'prodigy', 'teenager', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'what', 'helped', 'main', 'guy', 'realize', 'feelings', 'girl', 'was', 'competitor', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'prize', 'was', 'annoying', 'never', 'verbally', 'admitted', 'feelings', 'apologized', 'cold', 'treatment', 'love', 'drama', 'even', 'shortcomings', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'will', 'agree', 'most', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'were', 'lame', 'unrealistic', 'raging', 'teenage', 'hormones', 'jealous', 'anger', 'adorable', 'teenage', 'girl', 'short', 'skirts', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'see', 'passion', 'main', 'guy', 'least', 'personal', 'preference', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'girl', 'continuing', 'spunky', 'attitude', 'started', 'drama', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'girl', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'smart', 'should', 'be', 'definitely', 'can', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Lots', 'laughs.By', 'way', 'typed', 'Naughty', 'Kiss', 'youtube', 'had', 'more', 'scenes', 'version', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'scenes', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'interact', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'became', 'couple']",Naughty Kiss (Mischeivious Kiss / Playful Kiss) - Korean drama (4DVD - Complete Series) All Region with English Subtitles
1510777,A33YVLUPYCQZ15,B0065TTPE2,Kellie,"[2, 2]",This drama is funny. I feel sorry for Oh Ha-ni because the guy she likes does not pay much attention to her in the beginning and is quite rude to her. Even though he has made her cry she does not give up on her first love. The funny part about the drama is she always gets into some sticky situation and Baek Seung-jo (her first love) usually ends up helping her out.,5,Laugh Out Loud Fun!,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,367,"['drama', 'funny', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Oh', 'Ha-ni', 'guy', 'not', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'beginning', 'quite', 'rude', 'Even', 'made', 'cry', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'first', 'love', 'funny', 'part', 'drama', 'always', 'sticky', 'situation', 'Baek', 'Seung-jo', 'first', 'love', 'usually', 'up', 'helping', 'out']",Naughty Kiss (Mischeivious Kiss / Playful Kiss) - Korean drama (4DVD - Complete Series) All Region with English Subtitles
1510778,A2NRX980SWCB1Q,B0065TTPE2,paola,"[3, 6]","I am a big fan of romantic comedies and novellas, but this one is way, way, way too corny and unrealistic.  I don't find it charming that Oh Ha Ni is after a guy that doesn't seem to like her very much and treats her terribly for his own amusement.  Especially, when a hard working man like Bong Joon Gu is genuinely vying for her attention.  Sure, Bong Joon Gu isn't the smartest guy, nor is he the best looking guy (with the strange hair style), but he seems to really love Oh Ha Ni regardless of whether she deserves it or not.  And watching Oh Ha Ni desperately try to win Baek Seung Jo's attention and affection is painful to watch: mainly because I keep face-palming myself at the ridculousness of it all.Since I'm a stubbon fan of Korean-novellas, I did watch the entire series through with a hope that Oh Ha Ni will become a woman with more gumption and show Baek Seung Jo that she deserves his respect as his equal.  Unfortunately for me, that didn't happen; she will be the perfect desperate housewife, though.  Still, I must say the reason why I didn't give this series one star is because I was happy that Bong Joon Gu ended up with someone he deserved in the end.Bottom line is, cuteness (Oh Ha Ni) and arrogance (Baek Seung Jo) can get annoying when each episode is the same, predictable routine.  I suggest looking for a series where the leading female character has more self-respect and the leading male character has less of an ego because a realistic relationship doesn't work when the two parts of a couple lacks respect for each other, or when each person's pride gets in the way.",2,Cheesy and Over-the-top,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1601,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'novellas', 'one', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'corny', 'unrealistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'charming', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'guy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'much', 'terribly', 'own', 'amusement', 'Especially', 'when', 'hard', 'working', 'man', 'Bong', 'Joon', 'Gu', 'genuinely', 'vying', 'attention', 'Sure', 'Bong', 'Joon', 'Gu', ""n't"", 'smartest', 'guy', 'best', 'looking', 'guy', 'strange', 'hair', 'style', 'really', 'love', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'regardless', 'not', 'watching', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'desperately', 'try', 'win', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'attention', 'affection', 'painful', 'watch', 'mainly', 'keep', 'face-palming', 'myself', 'ridculousness', 'all.Since', ""'m"", 'stubbon', 'fan', 'Korean-novellas', 'did', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'hope', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'will', 'become', 'woman', 'more', 'gumption', 'show', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'respect', 'equal', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'though', 'Still', 'must', 'say', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'series', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'happy', 'Bong', 'Joon', 'Gu', 'ended', 'up', 'someone', 'deserved', 'end.Bottom', 'line', 'cuteness', 'Oh', 'Ha', 'Ni', 'arrogance', 'Baek', 'Seung', 'Jo', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'when', 'episode', 'same', 'predictable', 'routine', 'suggest', 'looking', 'series', 'where', 'leading', 'female', 'character', 'more', 'self-respect', 'leading', 'male', 'character', 'less', 'ego', 'realistic', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'two', 'parts', 'couple', 'respect', 'other', 'when', 'person', 'pride', 'way']",Naughty Kiss (Mischeivious Kiss / Playful Kiss) - Korean drama (4DVD - Complete Series) All Region with English Subtitles
