He was a true athlete, not some skinny twerp pretending to be a tough guy.  He could act.  He appealed to all ages and genders for different reasons: ladies like the pretty-boy aspect, guys liked the tough guy thing, little boys knew he'd always save the kid from trouble.  While the actor died of a tragic accident, he left a short, but impressive legacy in his role as Phinneas Bog.The kid was a touch hammy, but often true to form for child actors of the era.  The difference here was the show's writers played to his strengths and it showed.  He complemented his on-screen buddy well.The shows did its best stab at history, made it exciting, and ended each episode with a ""if you want to learn more, it's all in books, at your public library.""Quantum Leap never would have happened without this show where the characters fixed things that went wrong with time...",5,Better than I remembered,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1114,"['1982', 'show', 'aired', 'was', 'six', 'turning', 'seven', 'run.While', 'only', 'lasted', '20', 'episodes', 'was', 'bumped', 'World', 'Series', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'glued', 'television', 'whenever', 'was', 'on.The', 'lead', 'actor', 'was', 'rare', 'thing', 'days', 'was', 'true', 'athlete', 'not', 'skinny', 'twerp', 'pretending', 'be', 'tough', 'guy', 'could', 'act', 'appealed', 'ages', 'genders', 'different', 'reasons', 'ladies', 'pretty-boy', 'aspect', 'guys', 'liked', 'tough', 'guy', 'thing', 'little', 'boys', 'knew', ""'d"", 'always', 'save', 'kid', 'trouble', 'actor', 'died', 'tragic', 'accident', 'left', 'short', 'impressive', 'legacy', 'role', 'Phinneas', 'Bog.The', 'kid', 'was', 'touch', 'hammy', 'often', 'true', 'form', 'child', 'actors', 'era', 'difference', 'here', 'was', 'show', 'writers', 'played', 'strengths', 'showed', 'complemented', 'on-screen', 'buddy', 'well.The', 'shows', 'did', 'best', 'stab', 'history', 'made', 'exciting', 'ended', 'episode', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'books', 'public', 'library', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'show', 'where', 'characters', 'fixed', 'things', 'went', 'time']",N/A

I didn't even mind that I may be learning something about history in the process. Truly one short lived show. Should have lasted longer so it could develop more. Seems to me that any type of show that is both action/adventure but also teaches you something always gets passed over. I wonder if this is more an issue with the executives than the fans. Remember the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles? TV can be educational and fun as this show proved. Aside from a few saturday morning shows, there was little on tv that had much to offer that didn't talk down to kids. This show seemed like it was aimed at kids and adults. One thing I thought that it showed was that kids have something to offer if adults would just listen. Though Boggs was the one in charge of the time travel it was the kid who had a lot of the answers. So they benefited each other very well. Anyway this is a great dvd to buy to watch and have fun If I were the history channel (which I love) I would try to include this in my lineup because it shows how learning history can be fun and addictive.

It is good clean fun with adventure and some humor all mixed together and topped off with Jon-Erik Hexum's hunky good looks. The only real problem is that it makes me sad that this actor never got the chance to really further his career due to his sudden and sad death at such an early age. Maybe if this show had not been cancelled he would not have had the tragic accident that took his life while filming his next show. Anyway, these episodes of Voyagers are fun to watch and interesting. I found them to be amusing because you get the fun adventures while learning about history. I've always thought the concept of time travel was cool and this is sort of a Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure of TV. The only thing that bothered me was that Jeffrey and Phineas always wore the same clothes in every episode. Didn't they ever stop to get new threads?

But I soon got caught up in the idea of this smart, personable kid who has to tell the professional who someone is and what needs to happen in history as they pop in and out of situations gone awry.  Nostalgia had me getting the DVD set, but after viewing these episodes again I realized this is a great way for kids to get enthused about history.  The end of each episode even encourages you to go to your local library to learn more.In each episode the duo generally take on two problems in history, often filled with action and danger.  You learn something about famous history figures in different times and places in the world.Jeffrey Jones, the twelve year-old kid, had recently been orphaned and overhears his aunt and uncle arguing about being forced to take him on.  Phineas Bogg, the Voyager, crashes into the kid's bedroom by mistake.  Jeff ends up falling out of a window and Phineas dives after him to use the Omni, the time travel device, to get them out of there before they hit the ground.  He's unable to get Jeff back to his own time.  Unfortunately Bogg loses his book telling him what needs to take place in history.  But Jeff's father had been a history professor and Jeff knows his stuff, making him an important partner in Bogg's job.Ok, their are lots of explosions and some are reused in different episodes.  And if you pay attention you'll recognize some locations being reused with different props to give it a different time period, but hey, this was filmed at Universal Studios.

1070657,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B000PFUAN2,Hound Dog,"[1, 1]","Just imagine a sci-fi fantasy television series geared towards children that would introduce them to extraordinary individuals and monumental events throughout world history.  Yet, something is wrong - history isn't following its intended course, as, for instance, the Germans are winning World War I handily because they invented the airplane first (after the Wright Brothers had broken up in Dayton, OH, before completing their famous collaboration at Kitty Hawk, NC).  Enter the Voyagers: time travelers criss-crossing the space-time continuum righting historical inaccuracies and ensuring that history unfolds as truly intended.In late 1982, Universal Studios and Scholastic Books produced this inventive, albeit short-lived Sunday night adventure featuring the late Jon-Erik Hexum as the swashbuckling, impetuous Phineas Bogg and Meeno Peluce as his young sidekick, Jeffrey Jones (a historical whiz).  Thrown together by a fluke meeting at Jeffrey's home in 1982, Bogg, whose brash courage often overrides his lack of historical knowledge, must now rely on an 11-year old orphan to keep his job since his trusty Voyager guidebook was left behind in the jaws of Jeffrey's dog, Ralph.  Worse yet, Bogg's time-traveling device, the Omni (similar to a gold-plated pocket watch), is designed only to go up to 1970, so there is no way of Bogg returning Jeffrey to his proper time.  Hence, the series is set for Bogg and Jeffrey to zip back and forth through time for 20 episodes typically correcting wrongs in two different time periods per episode.  Exemplified in several solid episodes, the cause-and-effect significance in world history should prove fascinating to a new generation of young fans watching this DVD set.Overall, this exuberant series still performs exceptionally well after nearly thirty years.  Despite being a 25-year old rookie actor, Hexum gave an excellent performance as the heroic lead next to the scene-stealing Peluce (a TV veteran at his young age).  Their on-screen chemistry, I think, remains the program's strongest asset, in addition to its adherence to at least fairly accurate portrayals of major historical figures ranging from Thomas Edison to Cleopatra to Babe Ruth to Abraham Lincoln, among numerous others.  For instance, how many television programs can coherently juggle a storyline with infant Moses, the Wright Brothers, Eddie Rickenbacker vs. the Red Baron, and Hollywood actress Mary Pickford in its pilot episode alone?  ""Voyagers!"" managed to do it for one season in an era in which inspired prime-time children's programming was most uncommon.What I really believe endures about ""Voyagers!"" is the maturing father-son relationship between Bogg and Jeffrey, as Bogg (despite his dislike of children) begrudgingly grants Jeffrey's wish for a surrogate father.  Evidence of this ongoing sub-plot is readily seen in the poignant Christmas episode entitled ""Merry Christmas, Bogg,"" where Bogg tries to leave a disgruntled Jeffrey with his early 20th Century ancestors thinking the boy is ultimately better off with family than time-traveling without a home.  Further evidence of their growing friendship appears in ""The Trial of Phineas Bogg,"" as Bogg's superiors put him on trial for committing multiple offenses against the strict Voyager Code.  As hints of Jeffrey's destiny are revealed, the episode (perhaps the series' best) would have worked quite well as its finale.  Instead, a sequel to this episode featuring Jack the Ripper (entitled ""Jack's Back"") is the last one, which originally aired in mid-1983.For what it is worth, I highly recommend purchasing ""Voyagers! The Complete Series"" as a terrific means of introducing your young children to the (pardon the expression) timeless magic and wonders of history, let alone other fascinating books they may yet find at the local library.It's an excellent investment for ages 8 and up.Rating: 10/10.P.S.  You can also find for a low cost on Amazon.com the long out-of-print Scholastic adaptation by Joe Claro of the series' premiere episode.  I certainly recommend it for second graders and up.",5,Voyagers!: The Timeless Adventures of Phineas Bogg and Jeffrey Jones,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,4094,"['Just', 'imagine', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'television', 'series', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'would', 'introduce', 'extraordinary', 'individuals', 'monumental', 'events', 'world', 'history', 'something', 'wrong', 'history', ""n't"", 'following', 'intended', 'course', 'instance', 'Germans', 'are', 'winning', 'World', 'War', 'handily', 'invented', 'airplane', 'first', 'Wright', 'Brothers', 'had', 'broken', 'up', 'Dayton', 'OH', 'completing', 'famous', 'collaboration', 'Kitty', 'Hawk', 'NC', 'Enter', 'Voyagers', 'time', 'travelers', 'criss-crossing', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'righting', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'ensuring', 'history', 'unfolds', 'truly', 'intended.In', 'late', '1982', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Scholastic', 'Books', 'produced', 'inventive', 'short-lived', 'Sunday', 'night', 'adventure', 'featuring', 'late', 'Jon-Erik', 'Hexum', 'swashbuckling', 'impetuous', 'Phineas', 'Bogg', 'Meeno', 'Peluce', 'young', 'sidekick', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'historical', 'whiz', 'Thrown', 'together', 'fluke', 'meeting', 'Jeffrey', 'home', '1982', 'Bogg', 'brash', 'courage', 'often', 'lack', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'must', 'now', 'rely', '11-year', 'old', 'orphan', 'keep', 'job', 'trusty', 'Voyager', 'guidebook', 'was', 'left', 'jaws', 'Jeffrey', 'dog', 'Ralph', 'Worse', 'yet', 'Bogg', 'time-traveling', 'device', 'Omni', 'similar', 'gold-plated', 'pocket', 'watch', 'designed', 'only', 'go', 'up', '1970', 'way', 'Bogg', 'returning', 'Jeffrey', 'proper', 'time', 'Hence', 'series', 'set', 'Bogg', 'Jeffrey', 'zip', 'back', 'forth', 'time', '20', 'episodes', 'typically', 'correcting', 'wrongs', 'two', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'episode', 'Exemplified', 'several', 'solid', 'episodes', 'cause-and-effect', 'significance', 'world', 'history', 'should', 'prove', 'fascinating', 'new', 'generation', 'young', 'fans', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set.Overall', 'exuberant', 'series', 'still', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'being', '25-year', 'old', 'rookie', 'actor', 'Hexum', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performance', 'heroic', 'lead', 'scene-stealing', 'Peluce', 'TV', 'veteran', 'young', 'age', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'think', 'program', 'strongest', 'asset', 'addition', 'adherence', 'least', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'major', 'historical', 'figures', 'ranging', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'Cleopatra', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'numerous', 'others', 'instance', 'how', 'many', 'television', 'programs', 'can', 'coherently', 'juggle', 'storyline', 'infant', 'Moses', 'Wright', 'Brothers', 'Eddie', 'Rickenbacker', 'Red', 'Baron', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'pilot', 'episode', 'alone', 'Voyagers', 'managed', 'do', 'one', 'season', 'era', 'inspired', 'prime-time', 'children', 'programming', 'was', 'most', 'uncommon.What', 'really', 'believe', 'endures', 'Voyagers', 'maturing', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Bogg', 'Jeffrey', 'Bogg', 'dislike', 'children', 'begrudgingly', 'Jeffrey', 'wish', 'surrogate', 'father', 'Evidence', 'ongoing', 'sub-plot', 'readily', 'seen', 'poignant', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'Bogg', 'where', 'Bogg', 'leave', 'disgruntled', 'Jeffrey', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'ancestors', 'thinking', 'boy', 'ultimately', 'better', 'off', 'family', 'time-traveling', 'home', 'Further', 'evidence', 'growing', 'friendship', 'Trial', 'Phineas', 'Bogg', 'Bogg', 'superiors', 'put', 'trial', 'committing', 'multiple', 'offenses', 'strict', 'Voyager', 'Code', 'hints', 'Jeffrey', 'destiny', 'are', 'revealed', 'episode', 'perhaps', 'series', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'finale', 'Instead', 'sequel', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'entitled', 'Jack', 'Back', 'last', 'one', 'originally', 'aired', 'mid-1983.For', 'what', 'worth', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'Voyagers', 'Complete', 'Series', 'terrific', 'introducing', 'young', 'children', 'pardon', 'expression', 'timeless', 'magic', 'wonders', 'history', 'let', 'alone', 'other', 'fascinating', 'books', 'may', 'yet', 'find', 'local', 'library.It', 'excellent', 'investment', 'ages', '8', 'up.Rating', '10/10.P.S', 'can', 'also', 'find', 'low', 'cost', 'Amazon.com', 'long', 'out-of-print', 'Scholastic', 'adaptation', 'Joe', 'Claro', 'series', 'premiere', 'episode', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'second', 'graders', 'up']",N/A

The older guy/John Erik-Hexum is a time-traveler.  His job is to pop in and out of history and tweak things that are not exactly right, so they can happen the way they are supposed to.  I don't remember them ever explaining WHY they needed tweaking when they already happened once.  While I'm sure it must be the ""overlapping time & space/there is no linear time theory,"" I don't think they ever actually SAID it. Anyway, John pops into current times (with a bang) into this young boy's (age 10/12?)room (actually hanging out his window).  In all the excitement, the boy's dog grabs the guide book and John and the boy fall out the window. To keep from dying in the fall, John leaps them into another time and place.  The problem is, that John needs the guide book to navigate around and no longer has it.  John doesn't really know history either, but the boy's father was a history buff or teacher, so the boy knows all about what actually happened in history when they pop in and out of the different time periods.  They keep popping around history, fixing things that went astray, and trying to get the boy back to current times.It's a neat show for the action as well as for the history lessons that you get.  Although the show seemed to be quite successful, a tragic accident while filming took the life of John, which is why he quickly disappeared from sight.  Still, there are a lot of good episodes here.

Phineas Bogg is a Voyager--a person who is supposed to travel through time and give history a push from time to time so that the proper things take place.  The machine that he uses malfunctions a lot, he doesn't have a lot of knowledege about history, and he accidentally ends up in the bedroom of a boy named Jeffrey Jones in 1982, an orphan who knows a lot about history.  He ends up traveling with Bogg, going from one adventure to the next.  Not as heavy handed and preachy as Quantum Leap (which I loved, too)--a fun series, great family entertainment, kids should like it.One thing I remember is that whenever Meeno and Jon-Erik did interviews, they always spoke as if they were an equal team.  Jon-Erik never spoke of Meeno as just a kid.  On screen, they had a very nice relationship.  The kid's cute, the guy's hunky, and the adventures are fun.Generally in each episode, the voyagers drop into one scenario, leave at the first commercial break to another, solve the second problem, then take knowledge from that second scenario back to the first to solve the initial problem.

Bogg (a Voyager) and a boy ""traveled through time to help history along, give it a push when needed."" They have a pocket watch type of thing called an Omni. When the Omni flashed red, history was wrong. When they fixed history and put it like it should be, the Omni flashed Green.Bogg was a pirate who was then made a Voyager. By mistake, he was transported to 1982 (the Omni should only go ti the early 1970's.

If you want to find out what the mishap was, then you need to get the series.As I said, they travel through history and have to fix it. The adventures lead Bogg and Jeffery to all sorts of historical events. Some of the historical events are: The Salem Witch Trials, The Revolutionary War where the British win, the Civil War, where the South wins, helping out in fighting slavery, Billy the Kid, Moses, Gladiators, Babe Ruth, and much, much more.The costumes in Voyager! are fantastic! They are period correct, and just adds so much to the series. The music is also period correct.I also loved at the end of every episode Jeffery does a voice over, ""If you want to learn more about *insert episode adventure here, i.e Civil War, Babe Ruth, ect) then take a voyage to your local library, it's all in books.""
