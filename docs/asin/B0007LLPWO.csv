Millett,"[7, 11]","This is rough, this is real rough...I really, really WANTED to like this movie, dispite the fact that almost all original sandlot movie fans dispised the making of this.I have respect for people who write and direct somethings that are personal to them.  It seemed like it had potential, doing a 'next generation' type of thing for the sandlot.There are a couple of cool moments in the movie when they reference the first one, but after a while, they literally just rehash the same jokes, dialouge and plot outline from the first one...it got hard to watch.  I was praying for a cameo from any one of the random kids from the first one; considering the only good aspect of the movie was the legacy thing they kept trying to play up.  James Earl Jones is good in it, but he's pretty good in everything he does, I mean, he's Darth Vader for crying outloud.The features are pretty weak too, there is a cool featurette that takes a retrospective look at the original sandlot, but the only kids in it are squints, ya-ya and Bertrom.  Very mediocre.Overall, I really wanted to give this movie at least 2 stars, but I could't do it, I kind of saw what he was going for with same general plot, a lot of the same shots and even same exact dialouge, but you can't catch lightening in a bottle twice...especially when the first sandlot is accesible on DVD and is played out sooo much better.Also, side note, the end is an obvious set up for either one or many other sequels...I gotta say...I just hope they let sleeping dogs lie.

One for the camp and one for home of course - can't leave home without it. Even more importantly in The Sandlot is to watch the extra's about the making of the film.  They interviewed a couple of the guys who played in the Sandlot and they talked about how fun it was to make the movie.  Also there was mention that one or two of the characters were switched during the making of the movie (amongst each other not replacements).

882171,A3JNICYJRSVGA9,B0007LLPWO,Comic Online,"[0, 1]","There are quite a lot of negative reviews here about the Sandlot 2.  Honestly, i don't think it's as bad as many claim.  It's not a GREAT movie, but it's not bad.  The problem is that it's supposed to be a sequel, yet it retreads every single theme from the first movie.  If this were the only Sandlot film made, it would probably be considered much better.Unfortunately, they try to play it as a sequel.  The story continually drops little reminders along the way that this is a new story (such as the addition of girls to the grou and a romance), but every theme and story arc from the first film is repeated, some with almost verbatim dialogue.Here are a few among the many, many retreads:1. The dorky kid (also named Smalls) who doesn't play baseball, but is eventually accepted by the initially exclusive neighborhood kids.2. Smalls sends something sailing over the wall into the dog lot, where it must be retrieved from the mean dog's clutches.3. Devising silly schemes to retrieve said item.4. Knocking down said wall in a big hellabaloo.5. Nearly every character copied almost verbatim, only with new names and actors. (i.e., the fat kid, the two brothers, the black kid, the cool leader, the dorky non-athlete, etc)6. Big chase scene with dog and the neighborhood ""cool kid.""I could go on and on and on with the direct rips from the first film.  But because there IS so much from the first film here, it makes it somewhat enjoyable.  No, it doesn't quite have the magic of the original, but it's still enjoyable...so long as you accept it as a REMAKE, and not a SEQUEL.

This one, despite trying to be everything that the original Sandlot was, fails miserably.First of all, there is no real personality to the characters like there was in the first one. This might just be the acting, the script, or a combination of both. There is no sense of camaraderie between the characters in comparsion to the original Sandlot.  The stupidity of some scenes don't fall into the ""fun"" category that we might excuse in a kid's movie. Instead, this movie's production seemed rushed and out to profit from the first film. We see this with so many of the same scenes and conflicts from the first film: the battle for the sandlot, the insults being thrown between the two rival teams, hitting the ball over the fence and having to retrieve it, the legend, etc. If there is one difference, it is that it is supposed to be 10 years later, and there are 3 girls on the team.Sometimes you can forgive a movie for being unoriginal and poor.

882176,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007LLPWO,Joe Sherry,"[38, 43]","Ten years after the events of ""The Sandlot"" comes another story set in the same neighborhood on the same sandlot.  All of the kids from the first movie are now ten years older and have all moved away.  The only person remaining is Johnny Smalls (James Willson), the younger brother of Scott Smalls, the main character and narrator of the first movie.  Johnny grew up hearing about the legends of the sandlot and how Benny pickled the Beast and recovered the Babe Ruth autographed ball and how Hercules, the Beast, was tamed.  But this is now 1972 and those events are barely legend around the sandlot.  A new group of kids play there now.  But there are only 5 boys on this team.  The boys are led by David Durango (Max-Lloyd Jones).  The rest of the boys are fairly nameless.  Sure, they are all given names, but their personalities are lacking.  The catcher, Mac (Brett Kelley) seems to be taking the place of Hamilton Porter from the first movie as the loud mouth, large bodied catcher.  But  he lacks the personality of Ham.  It is as if he is a poor copy of the original character.  There is the token black kid on the team, taking the place of Kenny DeNunez.  There is one character who stands out, the entertaining Fingers Samuelson (Sean Berdy).  Fingers is deaf, hence the nickname, but is somehow the most striking character in the movie.But there is a twist.  This time there are girls.  Hayley Good fairer (Samantha Burton) and two of her friends end up rounding out the team and are just as good, if not better, than the boys.  Right from the start some of the old conflicts start up: the sandlot kids have a rivalry with the uniformed little leaguers and someone hit's a ball over the fence at Mr, Mertle's yard (James Earl Jones) where there lives a descendant of the Beast called the Great Fear.  It is at this point that Johnny Smalls relates the legend of the Beast and the rise of the Great Fear.  Naturally mischief ensues.If anyone has seen the first ""Sandlot"", that person has a very good idea about how the rest of ""The Sandlot 2"" is going to play out.  The stakes are raised in this movie, though that is also a matter of perception considering the first movie featured a retrieval of a ball autographed by Babe Ruth.  Even so, ""The Sandlot 2"" is not a very original movie.  Perhaps this isn't a surprise considering this movie was direct to video rather than getting a theatrical release.  But so much of it plays out exactly like the first movie even with the same dialogue.  What is most disappointing about this is the fact that both this movie and the original were written and directed by David Mickey Evans.  If anyone could recapture some of the magic of ""The Sandlot"", it would be him.  At least this wasn't a low budget sequel written and directed with somebody who has no ties to the original.  That's also why this is so disappointed.  Evans essentially remade the first movie with small cosmetic changes.But what I don't understand is why the kids didn't just go and ask Mr. Mertle for help in retrieving what went over the fence.  Scott Smalls had been friends with Mr. Mertle for  years, so Johnny has to know that he is a decent and friendly man.  The brief explanation given doesn't really make sense except that it allows the last third of the movie to have a conflict.  Without it, this movie would have ended after an hour.  It was just a weak explanation, though, and it just let the kids go through some of the same things that occurred in the original movie.I'm sure than a younger audience will enjoy ""The Sandlot 2"",  but those who have fond memories of ""The Sandlot"" should probably stay away.  This does nothing to tarnish the original movie, but there just wasn't a need for a sequel and even with the original writer/director on board, there is no comparison between the two movies.  ""The Sandlot 2"" is an inferior product and is missing the charm and humor and fun of ""The Sandlot"".Grade: C--Joe Sherry",2,clearly not as good as the original,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,3956,"['Ten', 'years', 'events', 'Sandlot', 'story', 'set', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'same', 'sandlot', 'kids', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'have', 'moved', 'away', 'only', 'person', 'remaining', 'Johnny', 'Smalls', 'James', 'Willson', 'younger', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Smalls', 'main', 'character', 'narrator', 'first', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'grew', 'up', 'hearing', 'legends', 'sandlot', 'how', 'Benny', 'pickled', 'Beast', 'recovered', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'autographed', 'ball', 'how', 'Hercules', 'Beast', 'was', 'tamed', 'now', '1972', 'events', 'are', 'barely', 'legend', 'sandlot', 'new', 'group', 'kids', 'play', 'there', 'now', 'are', 'only', '5', 'boys', 'team', 'boys', 'are', 'led', 'David', 'Durango', 'Max-Lloyd', 'Jones', 'rest', 'boys', 'are', 'fairly', 'nameless', 'Sure', 'are', 'given', 'names', 'personalities', 'are', 'lacking', 'catcher', 'Mac', 'Brett', 'Kelley', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'Hamilton', 'Porter', 'first', 'movie', 'loud', 'mouth', 'large', 'bodied', 'catcher', 'personality', 'Ham', 'poor', 'copy', 'original', 'character', 'token', 'black', 'kid', 'team', 'taking', 'place', 'Kenny', 'DeNunez', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'out', 'entertaining', 'Fingers', 'Samuelson', 'Sean', 'Berdy', 'Fingers', 'deaf', 'hence', 'nickname', 'somehow', 'most', 'striking', 'character', 'movie.But', 'twist', 'time', 'are', 'girls', 'Hayley', 'Good', 'fairer', 'Samantha', 'Burton', 'two', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'rounding', 'team', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'boys', 'Right', 'start', 'old', 'conflicts', 'start', 'sandlot', 'kids', 'have', 'rivalry', 'uniformed', 'little', 'leaguers', 'someone', 'hit', 'ball', 'fence', 'Mr', 'Mertle', 'yard', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'where', 'descendant', 'Beast', 'called', 'Great', 'Fear', 'point', 'Johnny', 'Smalls', 'legend', 'Beast', 'rise', 'Great', 'Fear', 'Naturally', 'mischief', 'ensues.If', 'anyone', 'seen', 'first', 'Sandlot', 'person', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'rest', 'Sandlot', '2', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'movie', 'also', 'matter', 'perception', 'considering', 'first', 'movie', 'featured', 'retrieval', 'ball', 'autographed', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Even', 'so', 'Sandlot', '2', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'movie', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'direct', 'video', 'rather', 'getting', 'theatrical', 'release', 'so', 'much', 'out', 'exactly', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'same', 'dialogue', 'What', 'most', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'movie', 'original', 'were', 'written', 'directed', 'David', 'Mickey', 'Evans', 'anyone', 'could', 'recapture', 'magic', 'Sandlot', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'low', 'budget', 'sequel', 'written', 'directed', 'somebody', 'who', 'ties', 'original', 'also', 'why', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Evans', 'essentially', 'remade', 'first', 'movie', 'small', 'cosmetic', 'changes.But', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'ask', 'Mr.', 'Mertle', 'help', 'retrieving', 'what', 'went', 'fence', 'Scott', 'Smalls', 'had', 'been', 'friends', 'Mr.', 'Mertle', 'years', 'so', 'Johnny', 'know', 'decent', 'friendly', 'man', 'brief', 'explanation', 'given', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'have', 'conflict', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'hour', 'was', 'just', 'weak', 'explanation', 'just', 'let', 'kids', 'go', 'same', 'things', 'occurred', 'original', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'younger', 'audience', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Sandlot', '2', 'who', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Sandlot', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'nothing', 'tarnish', 'original', 'movie', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'need', 'sequel', 'even', 'original', 'writer/director', 'board', 'comparison', 'two', 'movies', 'Sandlot', '2', 'inferior', 'product', 'missing', 'charm', 'humor', 'fun', 'Sandlot', '.Grade', 'C', 'Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

Well, I'd have to go back and check to be sure, but I think the kid in the legend was standing there listening to the story. . .yet there was no recognition that he or any of the other kids present knew anything about it.  Maybe I'm wrong and he wasn't there--but there's still another question, regardless:  if the dog was biting kids at some point and was never provoked, why would he be friendly and comparitively well-behaved at the end of the movie?  And I agree that Smalls's little brother should have been more familiar with Mr. Mertle, but maybe the family just never learned to communicate very well.  Stranger things have happened.Despite what other people say, I'm pretty sure that there ARE nine kids on the team.  I agree, though, that the characters are not as endearing as the ones in the first story.  I'm a woman who loves baseball, and I agree that the girls shift the focus of the movie too much.  Baseball is not the heart of The Sandlot 2; a girl is, and it's not because she wants to be part of the team more than anything.  So this movie is about the space program, how many things can possibly be blown up or hurled over a fence into a pool, and spats between lovesick kids.  The emotional components take away from the adventure scenes instead of giving them strength.I gotta complain about the shoes too--I didn't think the Nikes in this movie were as cool as the PF Flyers in the first movie; and, if I'm not mistaken, the kid who goes over the fence casts aside PF Flyers for the Nikes.But the movie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  If I hadn't seen the first movie and happened to catch this one on TV, it would be enjoyable.  The characters--even the brooding, secretive one--aren't especially deep, and the plot is somewhat far-fetched, but I had fun watching and didn't regret having rented the movie.",3,"Not great, but not the worst movie I ever saw.",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,2155,"['agree', 'reviews', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'Sandlot', 'classic', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'reason', 'needed', 'more', 'story.And', 'are', 'flaws', 'plot', 'Sandlot', '2', 'instance', 's', 'point', 'where', 'kid', 'talks', 'neighborhood', 'legend', 'involving', 'Mr.', 'Mertle', 'new', 'dog', 'Well', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'be', 'sure', 'think', 'kid', 'legend', 'was', 'standing', 'there', 'listening', 'story', 'was', 'recognition', 'other', 'kids', 'present', 'knew', 'anything', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'still', 'question', 'regardless', 'dog', 'was', 'biting', 'kids', 'point', 'was', 'never', 'provoked', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'friendly', 'comparitively', 'well-behaved', 'end', 'movie', 'agree', 'Smalls', 'little', 'brother', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'familiar', 'Mr.', 'Mertle', 'maybe', 'family', 'just', 'never', 'learned', 'communicate', 'very', 'well', 'Stranger', 'things', 'have', 'happened.Despite', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'say', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'ARE', 'nine', 'kids', 'team', 'agree', 'though', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'endearing', 'ones', 'first', 'story', ""'m"", 'woman', 'who', 'baseball', 'agree', 'girls', 'shift', 'focus', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'Baseball', 'not', 'heart', 'Sandlot', '2', 'girl', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'team', 'more', 'anything', 'movie', 'space', 'program', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'blown', 'up', 'hurled', 'over', 'fence', 'pool', 'spats', 'lovesick', 'kids', 'emotional', 'components', 'take', 'away', 'adventure', 'instead', 'giving', 'strength.I', 'got', 'ta', 'complain', 'shoes', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Nikes', 'movie', 'were', 'as', 'cool', 'PF', 'Flyers', 'first', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'kid', 'who', 'fence', 'casts', 'aside', 'PF', 'Flyers', 'Nikes.But', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'be', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'happened', 'catch', 'one', 'TV', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'even', 'brooding', 'secretive', 'one', 'are', ""n't"", 'especially', 'deep', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'rented', 'movie']",N/A

A lot of people have said what they feel about this remake but this is an awful attempt. It was very hard watching this but since my past is so in love with the original it would have been odd to watch this and like it. For on this movie is goofy and these actors really don't have the same talent or strong presence the old cast had. If you ask me this is just a weak attempt to give the new generation their own Sandlot because the only thing different here are the girls. This Sandlot is a legendary classic so why would you be so cheap to ruin a films reputation this way.The comedy is not the same, neither is the seriousness of the characters, and then there's no powerful character like Benny who was the most memorable character from Sandlot. Nobody here is memorable and they don't give off the deep feeling the original cast gave. Then there is the part at the end where they make this story up about the Beast really wanting to be released because there was a female dog in another fence he was in love with and he couldn't get to her. If I remember correctly the backyard was so huge that there wasn't enough room for another fence or for the Beast to know there was a female dog around. I also hated that the beast was smaller than most of the kids and in the first Sandlot beast was huge. This isn't really a sequel it's just a lousy remake with a couple of changes to make it appeal to kids. It's hard to believe that I don't hate this film because it was made off of a film my cousin and I grew up on but I gave it a fair chance and it just didn't work.

If you treasure the first Sandlot, as I do, you will not find anything here of value. Nothing. It feels very forced and some parts are totally ridiculous. Sometimes lack of attention to detail can expose even deeper problems with a movie. For example, this story is set in 1972. The kids use expressions not yet in the vernacular of the 70's. Music is used that hasn't been released yet. ""Summer"" by War was released in 1976. BTO's ""Takin' Care of Business"" came out in 1974. For the final scene, the lead male actor puts on a new pair of Nike running shoes. Nike wasn't a company until 1978. So the girl then saying ""just do it"" is a cheap attempt at humor made worse by the lack of attention to continuity. Small details, yes, but if you preface your movie as happening in a certain year or period, you can't then populate it with music and cultural details that didn't exist at that time.

Now with all that being said all in all this movie (even though it really wasn't that bad) was basically just a worse clone of the original Sandlot with a girl thrown to the mix 10 years later.Although the same breed, different story for Mr. Mertle's dog, fence with a wall of appliances representing a structure similar to the green monster, no one goes over the fence in fear of Mr. Mertle and his dog just like in the first Sandlot.Same campout to tell the story of Mr. Mertle's dogSpace Shuttle model goes over the fence instead of a ball signed by George ""The Babe"" RuthSame camera angles and everything as the first when the kids try to get the shuttle from the dog with their own home made gadgets.  No erector sets though.Line up of kids playing positions similar to the first Sandlot + one kid who is defPrivate above ground pool, instead of a public oneFireworks set off by Smalls instead of by the cityPredictable if you've seen the first Sandlot.
