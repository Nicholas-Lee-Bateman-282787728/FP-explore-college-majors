The cinematography was ok and effective in bringing you to what it was like in the Falklands war. However, the acting was pretty mediocre. The actors portraying the Argentine soldiers would have had a more genuine portrayal if they went to boot camp even for a week, e.g. Capt. Dale Dye's boot camp for actors (Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, etc.). The fact that the actors never went to boot camp does show on film (inexperience, lack of training, weird reaction in the midst of battle, etc.). I am not familiar with how the Argentine Military Junta treated their soldiers but in this film, it's as if they treated them worse than their British attackers. There was also a scene wherein the soldiers were crouching as if they were attacking an enemy position which turned out they were only attacking a herd of sheep. This brings me back to a Band of Brother's episode where one of the soldiers made fun of his buddy: ""Why are you crouching? Afraid that the deer will shoot back?""

1020745,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000II7CLY,K. Gordon,"[2, 2]","I fall between those who see this as a near masterpiece, andthose who dismiss it as overly familiar and done better before.An intense, fascinating look at the Falklands war, from the Argentineansoldier's POV, it begins with the attempted suicide of an ex-solider,which throws his war-time buddy into remembrances of the hell these menendured.While the war may have seemed a silly little flare up about a bunch ofrocks to most of the world, to the Argentinean draftees who lost theirlives their limbs and their sanity in a futile, under equipped attemptto hold off a wildly more powerful British force was as real to them asVietnam or Iraq or the coast of Normandy was to the men who sufferedand died there.Indeed, through this film's eyes it was worse, because it was anabsolutely pointless and quickly forgotten war, drummed up by thegenerals back home as a nationalistic exercise to take the country'smind off its faltering economy,And then, in the ultimate ignominy, the men are sworn to silence abouttheir defeat (and, presumably, abusive treatment by their ownofficers).Any war where more of the soldiers die of suicide in the years afterthan on the battlefield itself is indeed worth examining.The film succeeds in capturing the horror, confusion, and fear,although it doesn't quite get under the skins of the characters enoughto make us understand on a visceral level. I was never bored, butnowhere near as deeply moved as I wish I had been.--mild spoiler ahead--Still, I would have rated this higher except for a stumble in the verylast seconds of the film, where suddenly a burst of sentimentality andlatent nationalism in the form respectively of a pop song, and a lastscreen graphic made me question if I had been giving the film too muchcredit for having an enlightened point of view.",4,"An intense, fascinating look at the Falklands war, from the Argentinean soldier's POV",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,1796,"['fall', 'who', 'see', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'andthose', 'who', 'dismiss', 'overly', 'familiar', 'done', 'better', 'before.An', 'intense', 'fascinating', 'look', 'Falklands', 'war', 'Argentineansoldier', 'POV', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'ex-solider', 'war-time', 'buddy', 'remembrances', 'hell', 'war', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'silly', 'little', 'flare', 'up', 'bunch', 'most', 'world', 'Argentinean', 'draftees', 'who', 'lost', 'theirlives', 'limbs', 'sanity', 'futile', 'equipped', 'attemptto', 'hold', 'off', 'wildly', 'more', 'powerful', 'British', 'force', 'was', 'real', 'asVietnam', 'Iraq', 'coast', 'Normandy', 'was', 'men', 'who', 'sufferedand', 'died', 'there.Indeed', 'film', 'eyes', 'was', 'worse', 'was', 'anabsolutely', 'pointless', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'war', 'drummed', 'up', 'thegenerals', 'back', 'home', 'nationalistic', 'exercise', 'take', ""country'smind"", 'faltering', 'economy', 'then', 'ultimate', 'ignominy', 'men', 'are', 'sworn', 'silence', 'abouttheir', 'defeat', 'presumably', 'abusive', 'treatment', 'ownofficers', '.Any', 'war', 'where', 'more', 'soldiers', 'die', 'suicide', 'years', 'afterthan', 'battlefield', 'indeed', 'worth', 'examining.The', 'film', 'capturing', 'horror', 'confusion', 'fear', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'skins', 'characters', 'enoughto', 'make', 'understand', 'visceral', 'level', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'butnowhere', 'deeply', 'moved', 'wish', 'had', 'been.', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'stumble', 'verylast', 'seconds', 'film', 'where', 'suddenly', 'burst', 'sentimentality', 'andlatent', 'nationalism', 'form', 'respectively', 'pop', 'song', 'lastscreen', 'graphic', 'made', 'question', 'had', 'been', 'giving', 'film', 'too', 'muchcredit', 'having', 'enlightened', 'point', 'view']",N/A

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[1, 1]","""Iluminados por el fuego"" (= ""Blessed by fire"") is a wonderful Argentinian film, directed by Trist&aacute;n Bauer and loosely based on the real experiences of some young Argentinian soldiers that fought in the 1982 Malvinas' war.One of the main characters is Esteban Leguizam&oacute;n (Gast&oacute;n Pauls), a journalist who is informed that Vargas (Pablo Ribba), one of the men he served with in the Malvinas' war, attempted to commit suicide. Vargas suffered from depression, and couldn't live with his memories any more. Esteban visits Vargas at the hospital, and that situation prompts Esteban to remember what it was like for him and his friends to fight a war they were not prepared for.The screen is flooded by images of Esteban, Vargas, and Juan (C&eacute;sar Albarrac&iacute;n), young Argentinian men fulfilling their compulsory military draft, men that in a matter of hours saw themselves in a life and death situation, in the middle of a war for the Malvinas Islands. These young men didn't want to be soldiers, they were forced to try to behave likeones. They had many enemies, not only the English soldiers, but also the cold, the lack of proper clothing and food, and military leaders without sensible ideas. It is astounding to see how young they seemed, and how unfair the whole situation was...""Iluminados por el fuego"" talks about the Malvinas' war, but also tells us about the suffering that all wars bring about, and the toll they take on survivors. We should take that into account, and care. No military action should be taken lightly, ever. Even if the justification for a war is good, negotiation should always be the first option, and the use of force only a last resource, certainly not a decision to be taken due to political opportunism.It is not easy to watch this film, but I think everybody should.
