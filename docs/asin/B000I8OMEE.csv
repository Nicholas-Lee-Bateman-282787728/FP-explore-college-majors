It is real weak film versions of the American Pie series combined with  Bring it On and Legally Blonde films without the cheerleading. John Waters could have made a better film in his sleep..and I think he has!The plot is confusing story line. Also with 30 year old adults trying to play college cut ups, it seems like these ""KIDS""  seem too old to do some of this CRAZY STUFF.Their sight gags may make anyone gag. The pie scene steals from ANIMAL HOUSE's & Blazing Saddles's food fight and old three stooges movies..and Paris, you get not a drop of pie on you (AMAZING since you are inthe middle of the tossing)The one star is for the star of the film, Ms Hilton...who is her screen time makes herself seen.

1019484,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000I8OMEE,Richard Ross,"[3, 5]","Victoria English (Paris Hilton) is the rich, beautiful, and sadistic president of the Gamma Gamma sorority. She delights in torturing her  underlings and is especially cruel to new pledges.  Victoria excuses her behavior by thinking that everyone wants to be like her anyway.  Her  goal in life is to grace the  cover of FHM magazine. The magazine is running a contest to find the hottest sorority and Vicky is willing to do whatever it takes to win the coveted title. What it takes is for her to relax her tough standards of admittance to the sorority and allow girls that she would never think of speaking to pledge. Victoria searches for girls who she thinks will be so flattered by  her attention that they won't realize that she is setting them up for public humiliation. The freshmen dorm has been closed down thanks to an exploding toilet and luckily for Victoria they  are in need of a place to stay. The cliches abound since the group includes a fat girl, a lone black girl, a few lesbians, and a hot  exchange student. She is of Indian descent and since no one can pronounce her full name they call her Poo Poo for short. There is also an older woman who is pledging in the hopes of sleeping with some hot college guys to get back at her cheating husband. The wife has just undergone  a disastrous boob job which she's  more than happy to show off to her terrified roommates. The movie gives us our heroine in the form of Paula Garces. She's  the one level headed girl of the group which is to say she  is  the most sensitive and vulnerable. The freshmen meet Victoria and the hazing begins. First up for the girls is hunting for used condoms at four in the morning. As the Garce's character performs her degrading task of finding used rubbers she meets Victoria's abused boyfriend who she has just  kicked out of her room forcing him to sleep outside on a picnic table. He is played by Simon Rex. Sick of putting up with Victoria he helps the freshmen bring her down and end her reign of terror. The cast isn't exactly strong if Hilton is your main star but they do decent enough considering the lack of material to work with. There is some comedic talent  in the presence of Reno 911's Kerri Kinney as the horny wife. D lister Taylor Negron plays a Kama Sutra professor who is the recipient of a lap dance from Hilton.(Her double that is.) Carmen Electra shows up for one scene and the filmmakers even saw fit to throw Paris's aunt into the mix by having her play a fashion teacher. As you might expect from a DVD that bills itself as ""the naughty version"" there is a generous amount of nudity. This is where the director goes all out because why have one topless chick onscreen when you can have five. It's  all the nudity and sex in the film which bothered Hilton and caused her to  disown it.  This would have marked her film debut  but it was held up for a while (wonder why) in which time House of Wax was released first. The funniest moment in this film occurs during the credits. After William Heins is identified as being responsible for this and Hilton is  implicated as one of the producers a title card comes up saying ""Additional Scenes directed by Stratherford.."" I won't name names here Stratherford but it turns out that all the nudity was an afterthought. The producers didn't think the film was appealing enough so they had someone go back and insert more sex into the film hoping to reach a wider audience. Pledge This is like the teen version of Caligula. Hilton and the director thought they were making a serious film but sneaky producers sexed it up and completely ruined the finished film.  What do people expect of a film that stars Hilton and that went straight to DVD? Of course it sucks so don't even waste your time or money  if you hate Paris and think the film  looks terrible. I personally love bad movies and usually find some redeeming thing in them but I can't say that I found anything in this film. There are three good looking women to enjoy though. Hilton, Garces, and Noureen DeWolfe (Poo Poo) are all very attractive ladies and they all appear in their underwear at some point.  The lone bonus feature is a making of which features Hilton being mobbed by the press at Cannes where she promoted the film. It also features such acting heavyweights as Randy Spelling and Geoffrey Arend (the pyramid scheme guy from Garden State) boldly declaring that Pledge This is going to become a new comedy classic.
