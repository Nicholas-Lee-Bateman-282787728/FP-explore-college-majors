This show is more faithful to the original toyline's storyline. The writing actually forms cohesive story-arcs. The animation quality is top-notch, not only when compared to the low-budget Filmation original, but especially when compared to other 2002 cartoon contemporaries. A much more mature and fleshed out storyline is presented with sleek stylish action, wonderful voice acting, music, and steller production quality.Filled to the brim with interviews, commentaries, featurettes, a script for every episode and a look at the unproduced 40th episode, this has great special features and is a must have for any fan or collector.FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY",5,He-Man and the Masters of the Unvierse (2002) truly HAS THE POWER,1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,1087,"['He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', '2002', 'Complete', 'Series', 'fantastic', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'quality', 'animation', 'general.Having', 'grown', 'up', 'original', 'show', 'sequel/spiritual', 'successor/spin-off', 'toys', 'live-action', 'film', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'following', 'show', 'original', 'water', 'quite', 'literally', 'way', 'show', 'more', 'faithful', 'original', 'toyline', 'storyline', 'writing', 'actually', 'forms', 'cohesive', 'story-arcs', 'animation', 'quality', 'top-notch', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'compared', 'low-budget', 'Filmation', 'original', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', '2002', 'cartoon', 'contemporaries', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'fleshed', 'out', 'storyline', 'presented', 'sleek', 'stylish', 'action', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'acting', 'music', 'steller', 'production', 'quality.Filled', 'brim', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'featurettes', 'script', 'episode', 'look', 'unproduced', '40th', 'episode', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'must', 'have', 'fan', 'collector.FIVE', 'STARS', 'ALL', 'THE', 'WAY']","He-man and the Masters of the Universe - The Complete Series DVD Set Volume 1, 2 & 3 - 9 Disc Set , 39 Episodes , 14 Hours"

1198747,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B001GUL6BK,A. Gammill,"[11, 12]","Like so many people here, I'm a fan of the original Filmation He-Man series, and was quite skeptical about ordering this 2002 version.  But the price was almost unbelievably low (still is as of this writing) for the entire series, so I figured I'd take a chance.  And I'm glad I did, because this He-Man is actually a very good series.  True, it lacks some of the lighthearted tone and cheerful optimism of the original, but the fact is, the animation is a LOT better.  Almost old the old characters are here, just with more modern makeovers.  I also like the fact that Prince Adam and He-Man really seem like two different characters, rather than the Clark Kent/Superman-style not-so-secret identity used in the original show.As a hardcore fan of these characters, I'll always prefer the original series.  It was, after all, the last fully American hand-drawn animated series produced by a major studio.  Most every action cartoon since has been influenced by highly-overrated Japanese ""anime"" (this is apparent in the fight scenes of this series, though no where near as prevalent as it is in the 1990The New Adventures of He-Man, Vol. 1).

1198774,A6S7BFWB40M6B,B001GUL6BK,KAB,"[1, 1]","This series is great and I thank Mike Young for his retread of it. Let me clarify here: I was born in the '80s and there is just no topping the original He-man/She-ra canon for me. Still, of the two retreads of the He-Man line, Young's MOTU is by far the greater.In one particular aspect, this series even does a couple of things that the original series did not. First of all, it taps well into Eternia's history (something that Filmation occasionally did in one or two episodes) and the history of the council of Elders. More importantly, however, it takes viewers back to the time when Prince Adam had first learned of his destiny to be He-Man and, albeit briefly, before Skeletor had actually become Skeletor. Another thing that I personally owe this series is that it visited many of my favorite (underused) supporting characters of the original series and even gave them very important roles in their own episodes. Until now, Syklone (""The Mystery of Anwat Gar"") had appeared in two Filmation episodes and was given an approximate total of 45 seconds of screen time between the two. Now, he has an episode devoted to his joining of the Masters and his new character role (a samurai???) is well thought out. Two-Bad (""The Monster Within"") had also only appeared in only a handful of Season Two episodes before and, like many of the characters shy of He-Man, Teela and Orko, was hardly fleshed out in the '80s series. In Mike Young's reincarnation, we get to see Two-Bad in his (""their"") original form(s) as a pair of bounty hunters; only becoming one because of Skeletor's magic. Even Roboto (""Roboto Gambit"") was given a part of his moment to shine! A couple of villains in He-Man's rogues gallery outside of Skeletor's service, Count Marzo (""Mekaneck's Lament"") and Evilseed (""Orko's Garden"") even made their triumphant returns.This new series even saw the appearance of Stinkor (""The Sweet Smell of Victory"") and King Hiss and the Snakemen; all characters whom, until now, had been characters in Mattel's toyline but had never once appeared on screen! Still, even with these new characters, my personal favorites, Mekaneck and Buzz-off, were still made one regular Master and one ally, respectively. In these aspects, we owe Mike Young a great deal for reintroducing this classic show and we owe Mill Creek a great deal for picking up where BTC/BCI would have unfortunately left off when they closed their doors. The DVD collection even includes the end of episode moral segments that I had never seen before when Young's MOTU was on television!However, not even this (or even the '80s) gems are completely flawless and all that I can complain about this one is that it didn't last nearly long enough. For instance, it would have been interesting to see what Mike Young could have done with Granamyr and the Darksmoke-based dragon characters (they already had access to Larry DiTillo, the original writer of each of those classic episodes). Also, we caught a brief glimpse of the direction that Hordak's character was being taken and it would have made for a great extension of the She-ra canon. Unfortunately, this did not happen as of yet when the series ended.Overall: a fantastic retread that actually dared to go in several directions that even the classic original would not.",5,Perspectives in Greatness,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,3289,"['series', 'great', 'thank', 'Mike', 'Young', 'retread', 'Let', 'clarify', 'here', 'was', 'born', ""'80s"", 'just', 'topping', 'original', 'He-man/She-ra', 'canon', 'Still', 'two', 'retreads', 'He-Man', 'line', 'Young', 'MOTU', 'far', 'greater.In', 'one', 'particular', 'aspect', 'series', 'even', 'couple', 'things', 'original', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'First', 'all', 'well', 'Eternia', 'history', 'something', 'Filmation', 'occasionally', 'did', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'history', 'council', 'Elders', 'More', 'importantly', 'however', 'viewers', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'had', 'first', 'learned', 'destiny', 'be', 'He-Man', 'albeit', 'briefly', 'Skeletor', 'had', 'actually', 'become', 'Skeletor', 'thing', 'personally', 'owe', 'series', 'visited', 'many', 'favorite', 'underused', 'supporting', 'characters', 'original', 'series', 'even', 'gave', 'very', 'important', 'roles', 'own', 'episodes', 'now', 'Syklone', 'Mystery', 'Anwat', 'Gar', 'had', 'appeared', 'two', 'Filmation', 'episodes', 'was', 'given', 'approximate', 'total', '45', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'two', 'Now', 'episode', 'devoted', 'joining', 'Masters', 'new', 'character', 'role', 'samurai', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Two-Bad', 'Monster', 'Within', 'had', 'also', 'only', 'appeared', 'only', 'handful', 'Season', 'Two', 'episodes', 'many', 'characters', 'shy', 'He-Man', 'Teela', 'Orko', 'was', 'hardly', 'fleshed', 'out', ""'80s"", 'series', 'Mike', 'Young', 'reincarnation', 'get', 'see', 'Two-Bad', 'original', 'form', 's', 'pair', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'only', 'becoming', 'one', 'Skeletor', 'magic', 'Even', 'Roboto', 'Roboto', 'Gambit', 'was', 'given', 'part', 'moment', 'shine', 'couple', 'villains', 'He-Man', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'Skeletor', 'service', 'Count', 'Marzo', 'Mekaneck', 'Lament', 'Evilseed', 'Orko', 'Garden', 'even', 'made', 'triumphant', 'returns.This', 'new', 'series', 'even', 'saw', 'appearance', 'Stinkor', 'Sweet', 'Smell', 'Victory', 'King', 'Hiss', 'Snakemen', 'characters', 'whom', 'now', 'had', 'been', 'characters', 'Mattel', 'toyline', 'had', 'never', 'once', 'appeared', 'screen', 'Still', 'even', 'new', 'characters', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Mekaneck', 'Buzz-off', 'were', 'still', 'made', 'one', 'regular', 'Master', 'one', 'ally', 'respectively', 'aspects', 'owe', 'Mike', 'Young', 'great', 'deal', 'reintroducing', 'classic', 'show', 'owe', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'great', 'deal', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'BTC/BCI', 'would', 'have', 'unfortunately', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'closed', 'doors', 'DVD', 'collection', 'even', 'end', 'episode', 'moral', 'segments', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'when', 'Young', 'MOTU', 'was', 'television', 'However', 'not', 'even', 'even', ""'80s"", 'gems', 'are', 'completely', 'flawless', 'can', 'complain', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'instance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'Mike', 'Young', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Granamyr', 'Darksmoke-based', 'dragon', 'characters', 'already', 'had', 'access', 'Larry', 'DiTillo', 'original', 'writer', 'classic', 'episodes', 'Also', 'caught', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'direction', 'Hordak', 'character', 'was', 'being', 'taken', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'extension', 'She-ra', 'canon', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'yet', 'when', 'series', 'ended.Overall', 'fantastic', 'retread', 'actually', 'dared', 'go', 'several', 'directions', 'even', 'classic', 'original', 'would', 'not']","He-man and the Masters of the Universe - The Complete Series DVD Set Volume 1, 2 & 3 - 9 Disc Set , 39 Episodes , 14 Hours"

The original He-Man series had this element of lightheartedness, cheerfulness and optimism that for me constituted part of the essence of He-Man. (One of the things I loved the most about the original series is the theme music.) A later series in which He-Man was dressed in full-length leggings instead of a speedo and was whisked away to a far-future world named Primus managed to preserve much of that sunny spirit, even though much of the cast was changed (which I have to say I wasn't too happy about). But in THIS series that sunny spirit is gone. It now feels grim, serious and heavy. Admittedly the artwork is top-notch, but that doesn't help as far as I'm concerned. It's as if a familiar friend of yours had changed his personality from a cheerful, bright person into a brooding person who constantly pulled a long face. Sometimes this series tries to be humorous, but it just doesn't feel right. Neither does the quasi-Indian background music seem to fit in. Sorry, but I really regretted buying this.There's honestly something to be said about the proliferation today of fantasy reading and viewing material with this sort of dark and serious content. Whatever happened to that sunny, optimistic type of fantasy? I really wish writers and film/TV producers can put a little more sunshine into what they come up with.

Initially when I heard of the remake, I didn't care. Then I caught some episodes just by chance when channel surfing in college and... well, I was impressed! I still enjoy animation and some kids shows to this day, especially dealing with superheroes, and this series felt very much like a superhero program. If you are familiar with the original series, it takes and is true to the same basic premise: the planet of Eternia is a fantasy realm with magic and advanced technology, with a colorful cast of characters fighting for both the side of good (Masters of the Universe) and evil (Evil Warriors), who all have their own unique abilities like any superhero team. What makes this stand out is they took that premise and added actual developed storylines, action sequences, and brilliant animation. It's not perfect, and is still more than a little cheesy at times (although it never begins to approach the levels of cheese of the original), and is clearly for kids, but it also is a ton of fun, especially if you fondly remember these characters.About this particular DVD release: All of the episodes are included and work well.

1198783,AHF97M45JFCB,B001GUL6BK,ONENEO,"[169, 171]","There's no denying it: BCI Eclipse had some incredible animated titles that risked becoming forever lost to the archives of time once the company was forced to shut its doors this past year.  Fortunately Mill Creek Entertainment, which by the way is distributed by BCI's parent company, Navarre, has acquired the rights to bring many of BCI's titles to the home market once more.  Even more impressive still is that these sets will be packaged up and sold as complete box sets (rather than individual season releases).In the case of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, this set represents the complete 2002-series release by Mike Young Corporation.  Coming in at a total runtime of 960 minutes, this set spans 4 discs and contains the same clear-plastic slipcase and artwork-style as the previous BCI releases.The extras contained are only slightly less thorough than the individual season releases and include:End of Episodes MoralsInterviews with Toyline Artists from Mattel and The Four Horsemen12 audio commentariesScripts for episodes 1-40A PDF Comic Book for unproduced episode #40Notably missing from this set are the original art cards (a pair was included in each of the three season releases).Now let's take a look at the show itself:Fans are treated to what many consider the most accurate and exciting rendition of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe saga. Debuting in 2002 under the Mike Young Productions umbrella, this latest rendition of the He-Man source material closely follows the original Filmation standard set in the early 1980s with modernized animation quality and in-depth stories that further built upon the original characters and environments.  The first season consisted of the following 26 episodes:The Beginning Part 1The Beginning Part 2The Beginning Part 3The Courage of AdamSky WarThe Deep EndLessonsSiren's SongThe Ties That BindDragon's BroodTurnaboutMekaneck's LamentNight of the ShadowbeastsUnderworldThe Mystery of Anwat GarThe Monster WithinRoboto's GambitTrustOrko's GardenBuzz-Off's PrideSnake PitThe IslandThe Sweet Smell of VictorySeparationThe Council of Evil Part 1The Council of Evil Part 2Season two consisted of the following thirteen:The Last StandTo Walk With DragonsOut of the PastRise of the Snake Men Part 1Rise of the Snake Men Part 2The Price of DeceitOf Machines and MenSecond SkinThe Power of GrayskullWeb of EvilRattle of the SnakeHistoryAwaken the SerpentIn case you're just tuning in, no this isn't the Filmation version of the show so many of us recall with warm fuzzies from our youth. This is in fact the third (and most recent) animated iteration of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Produced for Cartoon Network by Mike YoungProductions, this version ran from 2002 until 2004 where it went for two full seasons (26 in the first season, 13 in the second). Along the way it managed to snag a very well deserved Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing (2004).While there are few who could argue successfully that anything could replace the original Filmation series, Mike Young Productions managed to capture all of the elements that made the original so successful and to bring them up to modern standards of animation quality, sound work, and script writing. As a result the mythos had been brought to an entirely new generation of fans while simultaneously pleasing fans of the original.Without giving too much away (I hate spoilers personally), I will say that the origins of Snake Mountain will begin to unfold in the second-half of the first season in addition to the complete origin of the Dark Hemisphere which imprisons Skeletor and his minions. New characters are plentiful as well and contain some slick back-story efforts, which make even the original Mattel toys a lot more desirable. Among the notables includes the stories of Two-Bad, Cobra Kahn, Cyclone, Roboto, Moss Man, Zodak, and Stinkor. Many of these characters were never fully fleshed out in the original show (if they appeared at all) and would have remained only in the imaginations of those who played with the toys if not for the spectacular effort here. We are also treated to a couple of new looks for He-Man himself including an amped up version of he and Skeletor in combat and his ever impressive winter gear which includes a flowing fur cape and a heavy battle ax.The Snakemen element introduced in the first season develops into sheer brilliance in the second (and unfortunately final) season! Not to insinuate that the Masters didn't have their hands full as it was with Skeletor and his minions, this time around the threats to peace and justice come in from all angles in the form of the Skeletor and company, the Snake Men, and the Evil Horde! Yes, you read that correctly- She-Ra's arch nemesis, Hordak, who just so happens to have been Skeletor's mentor, shows up in Season 2 within Skeletor's origin story that finally ties all of the loose threads of Mattel's franchise together once and for all.I often like to wonder what ground Mike Young's team would have covered had the show continued.  Would they have expanded to include He-Man's sister (She-Ra's) story arc? Could have writer Larry DeTillio revisited some of his wise dragon influence?  A shame that we'll probably never know.All in all, the show simply continued to build upon the foundation first set by Filmation in the 1980s and thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment, can be yours in its entirety for the cost of each of the single season releases.",5,The Silver Lining of BCI's Unfortunate Closing,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,5500,"['denying', 'BCI', 'Eclipse', 'had', 'incredible',

Were as Filmation production team valued story telling and character development as most important features of the original series (which is the primary reasons the original series is considered a classic) with team Korea good story writing and character development are tied for dead last with this He Man incarnation. Instead we get more proof how ""drag your balls Z"" and Pukieman have corrupted and destroyed Asian anime studios creativity . Sadly every episode 5 to 20 minutes is wasted by lame, tired, hackney, cliched , boring Asian anime animation stunts, 2 minutes wasted power posing, 452 back flips then into another power pose , needless long power up then into a 5 minute running charge scene with a flashing backgrounds toward a enemy, a power pose with some quasi 3d back drop stunt,crap. It all adds up to detract from story telling and the characters and I find myself fast forwarding though on average 1/3 of every episode one episode serious only took me 4 minutes to watch. (this is after only two discs I've watch and I seriously doubt I be able to get thru all 4 depressing discs). Also the voice acting is a joke, who knew Stratos and Sean Connery were the same person ? W*F? seriously? The voice acting is really bad but its hidden by the lack of dialog most episodes have. This set is a massive bummer and might appeal to fans of really really bad Korean anime. Wow this was sad. Luckily in the same shipment I got all of the original He man series the full season sets of season 1 and 2 so Ive got the ""real"" He Man which I'm very happy with great sets with all the interview extras and Easter eggs . The only real positives of this set is that they didn't change motif adam is still the crown prince of Enteria.etc.... . And if your a fan of really bad over the top Korean anime devoid of story or characters with lots of flashy cunning animations stunts this could be for you. But what  think it best for is honing your after a six pack of colt 45 mystery science theater 2000 skills because what ever voice acting and dialog you create on the fly (G, Pg, R or XXX) versions will be more entertaining than the voice acting and the stories on this third sad incarnation of He man.

Silva ""Lone Wolf""","[0, 0]",I have to admit that this show was much better than I thought it would be especially considering how I was brought up with the 80s version. The artwork and story design were great. It was cool that they actually went about and told how Prince Adam got the sword since the original didn't and cool how Skeletor came to be. Was disappointed that there were only 40 episodes made since I was left wanting more and to see how they might have branched off into a possible spin off with She-Ra since they introduced Hordak. But overall a really great show that leaves you wanting more.,5,Better than I thought,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,579,"['have', 'admit', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'was', 'brought', 'up', '80s', 'version', 'artwork', 'story', 'design', 'were', 'great', 'was', 'cool', 'actually', 'went', 'told', 'how', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'got', 'sword', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'cool', 'how', 'Skeletor', 'came', 'be', 'Was', 'disappointed', 'were', 'only', '40', 'episodes', 'made', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'branched', 'off', 'possible', 'spin', 'She-Ra', 'introduced', 'Hordak', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'wanting', 'more']","He-man and the Masters of the Universe - The Complete Series DVD Set Volume 1, 2 & 3 - 9 Disc Set , 39 Episodes , 14 Hours"

However, as a word of warning to others (which from looking at other posts I'm not alone in this) just know the dvd packaging is really, really cheap. I have owned somewhere between 500-700 movies and rented hundreds of others and have never encountered a case like this one. Instead of any kind of disc holder you get this little square tab inside the dvd case which houses 4 dvd's in sleeves and it's not easy to get the disks in and out without bending which may not be a huge concern for you but if you like to keep things nice it's a little annoying. The cover art and case itself is fine but it's the way the dvd's are housed that is absurd/cheap. The series itself gets a 4 but if I were to rate the package it came in, one that aspect alone it would be a - 4.",4,"Good cartoon series, really bad case",1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,873,"['am', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'series', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'especially', 'such', 'great', 'price', 'However', 'word', 'warning', 'others', 'looking', 'other', 'posts', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'just', 'know', 'dvd', 'packaging', 'really', 'really', 'cheap', 'have', 'owned', 'somewhere', '500-700', 'movies', 'rented', 'hundreds', 'others', 'have', 'never', 'encountered', 'case', 'one', 'Instead', 'kind', 'disc', 'holder', 'get', 'little', 'square', 'tab', 'dvd', 'case', 'houses', '4', 'dvd', 'sleeves', 'not', 'easy', 'get', 'disks', 'bending', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'concern', 'like', 'keep', 'things', 'nice', 'little', 'annoying', 'cover', 'art', 'case', 'fine', 'way', 'dvd', 'are', 'housed', 'absurd/cheap', 'series', '4', 'were', 'rate', 'package', 'came', 'one', 'aspect', 'would', 'be', '4']","He-man and the Masters of the Universe - The Complete Series DVD Set Volume 1, 2 & 3 - 9 Disc Set , 39 Episodes , 14 Hours"

So, we I first heard that they were remaking the series, I was super excited. For the most part, this is great, really top notch. But, my main issue is with the voice actors they chose for some of Skeletor's crew. They are HORRIBLE. Not only does Clawful, Beast Man, and Mer-Man sound goofy and dumb, they're just straight up obnoxious. It sounds so unbelievably kiddish, it's hard to listen to at times. If only they could redo the voices for those characters, it'd be perfect in my opinion. The action, storylines, and characters themselves are great. Orko gets a little annoying at times, but he's not in it much. And some dialogue is cheesy, but it's a cartoon, I'm not expecting Oscar worthy dialogue. But I am expecting the voices to match the style and edginess of it.

Action packed, a perfect homage to the beloved 80's show and a darker, better animated revision to boot.  I love how they explore the origin of not only several key characters but Eternia as well.  This is non-stop entertainment and a lively animated He-man show that should have gotten more episodes during its run.  A clean, fantastic look to this show highlights the obvious upgrades to every character from the original Masters of the Universe.Every episode is jam packed with heavy pathos and heart-wrenching developements.  Every twist and story thread matters, every character plays a role and real peril is at every corner.  These are writers that know drama and the original characters and show very well.
