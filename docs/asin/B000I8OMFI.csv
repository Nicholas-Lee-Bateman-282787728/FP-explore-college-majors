1019505,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000I8OMFI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Brutal, but with a keen sense of irony, Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Pusher Trilogy"" is a wildly entertaining ride that's far more sophisticated than might appear at first glance. Three films that share certain overlapping characters, the ""Pusher Trilogy"" also links the stories with thematic similarities--but any of these movies also stand up to independent viewing. Individually, they are gritty and effective looks at the criminal underbelly--but together, they are an undeniable masterwork! Uproariously hilarious, wickedly bloody, and even surprisingly moving at times, I wholeheartedly recommend these to lovers of international film (they are set in Copenhagen) or the action genre.""Pusher"" tells the story of a low-life hood, Frank. As Frank hustles up a drug deal that turns south, he suddenly finds himself in a week long scramble to get on top of a bad situation. When bad goes to worse, he turns on his closest allies and faces the final reckoning alone. But he may just be in too deep! ""Pusher"" is a solid action picture. Frank's relationship with his cohort Tonny is played extremely well. His desperate machinations are a doomed excursion to the darkside and have a black humor that's uncomfortably appealing. Not the most original story in the ""Pusher"" arsenal, but it works really well regardless. 4 stars.""Pusher II: With Blood On My Hands"" is easily my favorite film of the trio. Why? It is understated and surprising and, of all the films, the most unique. Tonny (the terrific Mads Mikkelsen) returns from ""Pusher."" Some time in the future, Tonny is being released from prison and Tonny must reestablish his place in the outside world. A disapproving father, who just happens to be a crime boss, doesn't help matters. Tonny finds it difficult to be taken as a real player and is a doormat for those that surround him, both professionally and personally. Tonny actually starts to prove that perhaps he is the most worthy character amidst a barrel of bad apples and a final act of redemption is oddly heartfelt. 5 stars.""Pusher III: I'm The Angel of Death"" reintroduces Milo--a boss who has played a supporting role until now. Like a mad comic opera, ""Pusher III"" has Milo making dinner for his daughter's birthday party, juggling rehab meetings (he's 5 days clean), and trying to maintain business as usual with his crew. When a drug deal sours (that happens way too much!), Milo's perfect day loses all sense of balance and Milo is drawn into an unpleasant series of events leading to human trafficking. Milo's bratty daughter is a hoot as are his attempts to shanghai the addict's meetings. But ultimately, it's Milo's drug fueled descent (based on both morality and pride) that is nightmarish and unforgettable. 4 1/2 stars.Each film works and succeeds on its own merits! But if you get the ""Pusher Trilogy"" and watch them in conjunction, it is a movie making magic. Together, I easily rate the product at 5 stars as the three different films enhance the others.

Spilka,"[1, 3]","Spoilers.The movie tries to be authentic and perhaps succeeds, but the characters in it and their environment are thoroughly and utterly depressing. Of course, so is Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment, but there is a luminosity in the Russian novelist's depiction or his erring character, which is totally missing here. Mads is a brave actor--all in through some gruesome and embarrassing scenes. He is electric on the screen--as he is in his later movies. But the script doesn't give him a chance to reflect on his life. He shoots from the hip, as it were, in every occasion, and that's a pity. He looks much more intelligent and even thoughtful than what the movie script charts out for him. I knew he couldn't kill his father's whore. I knew he wouldn't, even when he was testing the wire to wring her neck with. But then he goes and kills his father. What are the repercussions of that action? What are his feelings about it? It reminds me of Dostoyevski again. In his The Brothers Karamazov, both Ivan and Dmitri want to kill their father, but Dmitri doesn't do it--wants to, speaks about it, is tempted to do it--but doesn't. And Dostoevsky explores this to a satisfactory conclusion. Here the Mads character does it, but what does he feel about it?  He carries his baby around in the hope of what? Redemption? Longing? Forgiveness? Does he feel any guilt about killing his father? Perhaps this will pick up in the third Pusher movie, but I don't have the stomach to watch it.I saw Mads also in the Bond movie, and as Hannibal Lecter. I must say that he is not a very good villain. Perhaps he doesn't have this Cobra poison in his blood to portray a convincing villain. In Hannibal, he is never sinister, or scary. Besides, they should have given him a bigger role. Perhaps I need to wait for the end of the series. However, my sense is that Mads, perhaps, is not evil enough to imagine the villain who is utterly devoid of conscience.",3,"Depressing, good acting",1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,1941,"['Spoilers.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'be', 'authentic', 'perhaps', 'characters', 'environment', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'utterly', 'depressing', 'course', 'so', 'Dostoyevski', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'luminosity', 'Russian', 'novelist', 'depiction', 'erring', 'character', 'totally', 'missing', 'here', 'Mads', 'brave', 'actor', 'gruesome', 'embarrassing', 'scenes', 'electric', 'screen', 'later', 'movies', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'chance', 'reflect', 'life', 'hip', 'were', 'occasion', 'pity', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'even', 'thoughtful', 'what', 'movie', 'script', 'out', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'kill', 'father', 'whore', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'when', 'was', 'testing', 'wire', 'wring', 'neck', 'then', 'father', 'What', 'are', 'repercussions', 'action', 'What', 'are', 'feelings', 'Dostoyevski', 'again', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'Ivan', 'Dmitri', 'want', 'kill', 'father', 'Dmitri', ""n't"", 'do', 'speaks', 'tempted', 'do', ""n't"", 'Dostoevsky', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'Here', 'Mads', 'character', 'what', 'feel', 'baby', 'around', 'hope', 'what', 'Redemption', 'Longing', 'Forgiveness', 'feel', 'guilt', 'killing', 'father', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'third', 'Pusher', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'watch', 'it.I', 'saw', 'Mads', 'also', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'villain', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", 'have', 'Cobra', 'poison', 'blood', 'portray', 'convincing', 'villain', 'Hannibal', 'never', 'sinister', 'scary', 'Besides', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'bigger', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'wait', 'end', 'series', 'However', 'sense', 'Mads', 'perhaps', 'not', 'evil', 'enough', 'imagine', 'villain', 'who', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'conscience']",N/A
