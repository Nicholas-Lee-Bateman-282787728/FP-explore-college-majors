I don't believe they have been widely distributed commercially on videotape and highly recommend them on DVD.  I'd like to give this disc a 4.5 rating, actually.  The only reason I don't quite think they deserve a 5 is that the second story, about the retainer which picks up very unexpected signals, doesn't appeal to me as much as the others, which hone in on human psychology through the medium of fantasy.  The retainer story is fun, is amusing, but just fluff.  In addition, I really kind of wish Marshall lived in a dysfunctional family like Simon's, so we wouldn't have to see his parents and sister.  I find the whole bunch of them annoying.  Fortunately, the focus is on the two boys, both of whom are excellent actors.  Think of all the bad cute kiddie actors you have seen on TV.  Justin Shenkarow is the opposite of that as the younger of the boys.  The writing is so clever and creative, with plot angles that are both eerie and funny.  As others have said, this series was way ahead of its time and stands the test of time ten years later.  According to the extras on the DVD, two more sets of Eerie, IN will be appearing on DVD.  Soon, I hope.  I never saw the other episodes.",4,"Inventive, Imaginative, Entertaining",1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,1332,"['happened', 'be', 'back', 'States', 'when', 'Eerie', 'IN', 'first', 'aired', 'taped', 'episodes', 'have', 'watched', 'once', 'year', 'so', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'been', 'widely', 'distributed', 'commercially', 'videotape', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'disc', '4.5', 'rating', 'actually', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'think', 'deserve', '5', 'second', 'story', 'retainer', 'up', 'very', 'unexpected', 'signals', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'hone', 'human', 'psychology', 'medium', 'fantasy', 'retainer', 'story', 'fun', 'amusing', 'just', 'fluff', 'addition', 'really', 'kind', 'wish', 'Marshall', 'lived', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Simon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'parents', 'sister', 'find', 'whole', 'bunch', 'annoying', 'Fortunately', 'focus', 'two', 'boys', 'whom', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Think', 'bad', 'cute', 'kiddie', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'Justin', 'Shenkarow', 'opposite', 'younger', 'boys', 'writing', 'so', 'clever', 'creative', 'plot', 'angles', 'are', 'eerie', 'funny', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'series', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'test', 'time', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'According', 'extras', 'DVD', 'two', 'more', 'sets', 'Eerie', 'IN', 'will', 'be', 'appearing', 'DVD', 'Soon', 'hope', 'never', 'saw', 'other', 'episodes']","Eerie, Indiana - Forever Ware / The Retainer / ATM with a Heart of Gold"

The creative team included Karl Schaefer, who later produced the equally wonderful TV show &quot;Strange Luck,&quot; and Joe Dante, a director who has shown his Spielberg touch with young actors in movies like &quot;Matinee.&quot;With its telepathic poodles, sleep-shopping, a sinister lightning-rod salesman and a farewell episode that turns the whole series inside-out, I would highly recommend this disc and any future episodes of this neat little feast of humorous, colorful, and occasionally touching TV. Those of you who have never seen the show or are only familiar with the US/Canadian revival that was shown on Saturday mornings a few years back should definitely see the original.",4,"It's Wholesome, yet  Eerie",1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,836,"['Creativity', 'not', 'guarantee', 'success', 'American', 'TV', 'least', 'show', 'got', 'air', 'life-span', 'NBC', 'series', 'was', 'brief', 'creative', 'team', 'included', 'Karl', 'Schaefer', 'who', 'later', 'produced', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'TV', 'show', 'quot', 'Strange', 'Luck', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'director', 'who', 'shown', 'Spielberg', 'touch', 'young', 'actors', 'movies', 'quot', 'Matinee.', 'quot', 'telepathic', 'poodles', 'sleep-shopping', 'sinister', 'lightning-rod', 'salesman', 'farewell', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'inside-out', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disc', 'future', 'episodes', 'neat', 'little', 'feast', 'humorous', 'colorful', 'occasionally', 'touching', 'TV', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'are', 'only', 'familiar', 'US/Canadian', 'revival', 'was', 'shown', 'Saturday', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'original']","Eerie, Indiana - Forever Ware / The Retainer / ATM with a Heart of Gold"

562461,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B0000507OU,S Martin,"[0, 0]","When I was a kid I watched this series. Unfortunately it was pretty short lived, running only about 10 episodes. Two episodes in particular stuck with me ever after I grew up, Forever Ware, and one about a girl who would draw and whatever she signed would come to life and actually be. The second episode isn't on this disk, but the first one is.Forever Ware is a creepy concept, as is most of these episodes. In it, a woman who sells forever ware guarantees that whatever you seal up in it will last, forever. So, after her husband dies she seals herself and her twin boys into it, keeping them the same age for many years. She encourages Simon's mother to sign up and purchase forever ware. Simon's afraid he'll end up like the twins, so he and Marshall find a way to keep his mom from buying forever ware.The other two on this disk aren't as good as forever ware, but they're not bad. In The Retainer, one of the kids in Eerie has a retainer that allows him to hear what dogs are thinking. This leads him, Simon and Marshall to the local pound, where the dogs have revolted against the dogcatcher and taken care of him, and then run the kid with the retainer off into the woods.In the ATM with a Heart of Gold, Simon's dad programs an ATM with a personality. When the only person who's nice to him is Marshall, the ATM begins to give Marshall money. The more money he gives Marshall, the poorer the citizens of Eerie get. Simon and Marshall figure out that money can't buy happiness and instead is causing people grief, so they return the money to the ATM, which causes it to have a nervous breakdown.When I was a kid I loved this series, I thought it was both creepy and interesting. Now that I'm an adult I still enjoyed seeing the episodes, but I don't find them as interesting as I did as a kid. I guess this was really was aimed more at kids.",3,One of my favorite shows as a kid,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1850,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'watched', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'short', 'lived', 'running', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'Two', 'episodes', 'particular', 'stuck', 'ever', 'grew', 'up', 'Forever', 'Ware', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'draw', 'signed', 'would', 'come', 'life', 'actually', 'be', 'second', 'episode', ""n't"", 'disk', 'first', 'one', 'is.Forever', 'Ware', 'creepy', 'concept', 'most', 'episodes', 'woman', 'who', 'forever', 'ware', 'guarantees', 'seal', 'up', 'will', 'last', 'forever', 'So', 'husband', 'twin', 'keeping', 'same', 'age', 'many', 'years', 'Simon', 'mother', 'sign', 'up', 'purchase', 'forever', 'ware', 'Simon', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'twins', 'Marshall', 'find', 'way', 'keep', 'mom', 'buying', 'forever', 'ware.The', 'other', 'two', 'disk', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'forever', 'ware', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'Retainer', 'one', 'kids', 'Eerie', 'retainer', 'hear', 'what', 'dogs', 'are', 'thinking', 'Simon', 'Marshall', 'local', 'pound', 'where', 'dogs', 'have', 'revolted', 'dogcatcher', 'taken', 'care', 'then', 'run', 'kid', 'retainer', 'woods.In', 'ATM', 'Heart', 'Gold', 'Simon', 'dad', 'programs', 'ATM', 'personality', 'When', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'nice', 'Marshall', 'ATM', 'give', 'Marshall', 'money', 'more', 'money', 'Marshall', 'poorer', 'citizens', 'Eerie', 'get', 'Simon', 'Marshall', 'figure', 'out', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'instead', 'causing', 'people', 'grief', 'return', 'money', 'ATM', 'have', 'nervous', 'breakdown.When', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'series', 'thought', 'was', 'creepy', 'interesting', 'Now', ""'m"", 'adult', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'interesting', 'did', 'kid', 'guess', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'aimed', 'more', 'kids']","Eerie, Indiana - Forever Ware / The Retainer / ATM with a Heart of Gold"
