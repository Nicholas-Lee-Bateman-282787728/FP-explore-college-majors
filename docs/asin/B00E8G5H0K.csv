1665317,A1UIU3DF5EPIGF,B00E8G5H0K,DEAD2RITES,"[1, 1]","Ok, so I am by no means a huge SW fan, but I like the saga well enough so I thought I would give this show a shot and I don't regret it for a second. I think I paid about $100 for this set when I bought it and it was worth every penny. I'm not done with the show yet but from what I hear it gets only better as it progresses so I doubt my opinion will change, so here is a list of pros and cons for any potential buyers.CONS: Lets just get these out of the way first:-Many characters have there share of cheesy lines.-Jar-Jar Binks is in a few episodes and I still want to strangle him.-If you've seen the movies you know which main characters won't die in the series.-Running animations for any character is pretty funny looking most of the time. (my personal opinion)-Seems to be a problem with the discs not letting you resume, can be very annoying.Ok, enough of that on to the PROS:-Beautiful animation, scenery, detail everything looks amazing!-Anakin is actually likeable.-Ashoka is likeable, sigh of relief because she was the new main character for this series.-Lightsaber battles are amazing, far beyond the poor stick-swinging you see in the movies. Granted these are not real people, but this is what lightsaber fights should look like.-Excellent villains, new and old.-Droids really have a personality now and it adds so much to the comedic portion of the show.-Aurra Sing is a character here!! By far my favorite SW character ever.-Speaking of Aurra the show has plenty of pretty ladies (pronounced priteee layyydeeees)-Copious amounts of violence, yes way more than the movies and in a pretty continuous stream. Seriously this was on CN??-Clones have there own story and it's pretty cool to see it unfold.-Voice acting is generally top-notch.-Space battles are pretty epic and land battles are sweet too. Lightsaber duals are just straight dope as I've said.I could come up with more, but you get the idea. I love this show and highly recommend it to anyone, and on blu ray it's even better.",5,"Amazing Show, Star Wars Gold",1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,2005,"['Ok', 'am', 'huge', 'SW', 'fan', 'like', 'saga', 'well', 'enough', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'show', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'second', 'think', 'paid', 'about', '100', 'set', 'when', 'bought', 'was', 'worth', 'penny', ""'m"", 'not', 'done', 'show', 'yet', 'what', 'hear', 'only', 'better', 'so', 'doubt', 'opinion', 'will', 'change', 'so', 'here', 'list', 'pros', 'cons', 'potential', 'buyers.CONS', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'first', '-Many', 'characters', 'have', 'share', 'cheesy', 'lines.-Jar-Jar', 'Binks', 'few', 'episodes', 'still', 'want', 'strangle', 'him.-If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'series.-Running', 'animations', 'character', 'pretty', 'funny', 'looking', 'most', 'time', 'personal', 'opinion', 'be', 'problem', 'discs', 'not', 'letting', 'resume', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'annoying.Ok', 'enough', 'PROS', '-Beautiful', 'animation', 'scenery', 'detail', 'everything', 'amazing', '-Anakin', 'actually', 'likeable.-Ashoka', 'likeable', 'sigh', 'relief', 'was', 'new', 'main', 'character', 'series.-Lightsaber', 'battles', 'are', 'amazing', 'far', 'poor', 'stick-swinging', 'see', 'movies', 'Granted', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'what', 'lightsaber', 'fights', 'should', 'look', 'like.-Excellent', 'villains', 'new', 'old.-Droids', 'really', 'have', 'personality', 'now', 'so', 'much', 'comedic', 'portion', 'show.-Aurra', 'Sing', 'character', 'here', 'far', 'favorite', 'SW', 'character', 'ever.-Speaking', 'Aurra', 'show', 'plenty', 'pretty', 'ladies', 'pronounced', 'priteee', 'layyydeeees', '-Copious', 'amounts', 'violence', 'yes', 'way', 'more', 'movies', 'pretty', 'continuous', 'stream', 'Seriously', 'was', 'CN', '-Clones', 'have', 'there', 'own', 'story', 'pretty', 'cool', 'see', 'unfold.-Voice', 'acting', 'generally', 'top-notch.-Space', 'battles', 'are', 'pretty', 'epic', 'land', 'battles', 'are', 'sweet', 'too', 'Lightsaber', 'duals', 'are', 'just', 'straight', 'dope', ""'ve"", 'said.I', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'get', 'idea', 'love', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'blu', 'ray', 'even', 'better']",StarWars:The Clone Wars:SN1-5(CE/DVD)

It comes with a nice (if not great) art book, plus a separate booklet detailing each episode.  The picture and sound quality for both the episodes and the extras is superb, and a definite step up from my old DVDs.  For those of you who haven't watched the series yet, this is the box to get I think.The series finale (which I will not spoil here) was a rather clever ending that DID at least answer the biggest question of all - why wasn't Anakin's new padawn not in the movies?  The series also ends in a way that absolutely informs Anakin's perspective and who he is at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith.  For me, that's 99% of why I love this box set, because even though the show was abruptly cancelled, they did at least answer that one rather large question. Overall, the chronology stays intact and actually enhances the movies greatly in my opinion....To be fair though, there are two or three story threads that I wish would have been wrapped up, but Lucasfilm is supposed to be releasing a few more episodes next year which may (or may not) answer the remaining questions.  But speaking soley for this set I believe it (more or less) does tell a complete tale, and contains many of the absolute best Star Wars stories ever told.

It's cool if they want to play with their own characters, like Ahsoka, but the second they started messing with George's characters, I became irate!  I was, and&#65279; still am, quite the fan of Barriss Ofee.  I read her expanded universe books, and was very excited to see her in the Clone Wars.  Then they decided to make her a traitor!!!  This little plot twist went completely against her character and destroyed this really great Jedi Lucas had created!!  Again, if they wanna mess with their own characters, that's fine.  But how dare you mess with one of George's creations!!!  (Spoiler alert) Similarly, I was equally pissed off when Salvatore killed off Chewbacca.  Chewbacca was not his character to mess with!!!  Yes I know this is supposed to be a review of the Clone Wars, but mentioning R. A. Salvatore's travesty of a Star Wars book seemed appropriate.  That'd be like if I decided to write my own Lord of the Rings book and, towards the end, decided, I'm going to kill Sam.  No reason for it, but people will sure remember me.

1665332,ADBT2QYXGQCSJ,B00E8G5H0K,"TV-Tastic ""Shawn""","[2, 3]","Until I pre-ordered Star Wars; The Clone Wars, I had never seen a single episode of it.  Despite being a fan of the franchise since i was two-years old in 1977, it was something I just never got around to and I didn't appreciate how a prime time series on Cartoon Network revolving around Star Wars would be anything but geared towards little kids.Boy was I mistaken...Star Wars: The Clone Wars is the best animated action series in the history of television, hands-down, and this Blu-ray release of the complete series is a triumph both visually and audio-wise.Contrary to my misgivings, the series is definitely not geared towards younger kids.  It's dark, it's heavy and there's plenty of good guys and bad guys getting killed (sometimes graphically) to make the PTC have kittens.  The series is incredibly well-written and weaves seamlessly into the Star Wars mythology and honestly, it adds more depth to the franchise than ANY of the films ever have.  This is not to criticize the films, but they were all pretty straightforward as far morality plays are concerned.  Good vs. evil, black and white... that's about it... oh, and of course Muppets (nub, nub).  Of course, the supporting novels, comic book series, etc., add much more to the universe, but on-screen it's been pretty basic.  Star Wars: The Clone Wars has so many different levels of ambiguity and shades of gray that you can't help to find yourself wrapped up in the introspective nature of the narrative, questioning your own preconceived notions of right and wrong.The CGI is so crisp and detailed on both the planetside landscapes and the exterior in-space battle scenes that I find myself forgetting that I'm watching an animated series.The audio mix is also a surprisingly well-done Dolby Digital 5.1 for the first two seasons.  I say surprisingly well-done because as anyone with a decent home theater can attest to, there is a vast difference in audio quality between the compressed Dolby Digital/DTS codecs and the lossless Dolby True HD/DTS HD MA codecs.  The Dolby mix is surprising rich and full with booming sound effects during battle scenes and feature film quality scores in both composition and presentation.  I haven't yet gotten to season three yet to judge the lossless DTS HD MA audio tracks but I can only imagine that if they put that much effort into the Dolby Digital mixes, the HD mixes must be as equally outstanding.As far as the bonus features are concerned, there is a good amount of interesting content revolving around the behind-the-scenes production and the creative process.  It's thoroughly enjoyable.  The set comes with a neat little hard-bound book that features the concept art of the series as well.Overall, this series and the presentation on Blu-ray is a treat and you cannot beat the pricepoint, even if you paid full MSRP considering that the individual seasons are $60 each. I pre-ordered and paid $105, less than the cost of two seasons.NOTE: In the 1-star ratings, there seems to be a trend of some people having issues with season five.  I can't comment on that as I haven't gotten that far but will if I encounter similar issues.I have close to 400 Blu-ray titles, some good, some bad but Star Wars: The Clone Wars is by far one of the best I own and I would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you're not a fan of the franchise.",5,Absolutely phenomenal series and you can't beat the price of the complete series... even at MSRP.,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,3350,"['pre-ordered', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'being', 'fan', 'franchise', 'i', 'was', 'two-years', 'old', '1977', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'how', 'prime', 'time', 'series', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'revolving', 'around', 'Star', 'Wars', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'geared', 'towards', 'little', 'kids.Boy', 'was', 'mistaken', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'best', 'animated', 'action', 'series', 'history', 'television', 'hands-down', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'triumph', 'visually', 'audio-wise.Contrary', 'misgivings', 'series', 'definitely', 'not', 'geared', 'towards', 'younger', 'kids', 'dark', 'heavy', 'plenty', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'killed', 'sometimes', 'graphically', 'make', 'PTC', 'have', 'kittens', 'series', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'seamlessly', 'Star', 'Wars', 'mythology', 'honestly', 'more', 'depth', 'franchise', 'ANY', 'films', 'ever', 'have', 'not', 'criticize', 'films', 'were', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'far', 'morality', 'plays', 'are', 'concerned', 'Good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'black', 'white', 'oh', 'course', 'Muppets', 'nub', 'nub', 'course', 'supporting', 'novels', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'etc.', 'add', 'much', 'more', 'universe', 'on-screen', 'been', 'pretty', 'basic', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'ambiguity', 'shades', 'gray', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'wrapped', 'up', 'introspective', 'nature', 'narrative', 'questioning', 'own', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'right', 'wrong.The', 'CGI', 'so', 'crisp', 'detailed', 'planetside', 'landscapes', 'exterior', 'in-space', 'battle', 'scenes', 'find', 'forgetting', ""'m"", 'watching', 'animated', 'series.The', 'audio', 'mix', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'well-done', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'say', 'surprisingly', 'well-done', 'anyone', 'decent', 'home', 'theater', 'can', 'attest', 'vast', 'difference', 'audio', 'quality', 'compressed', 'Dolby', 'Digital/DTS', 'codecs', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD/DTS', 'HD', 'MA', 'codecs', 'Dolby', 'mix', 'surprising', 'rich', 'full', 'booming', 'sound', 'effects', 'battle', 'scenes', 'feature', 'film', 'quality', 'scores', 'composition', 'presentation', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'gotten', 'season', 'three', 'yet', 'judge', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', 'audio', 'tracks', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'mixes', 'HD', 'mixes', 'must', 'be', 'equally', 'outstanding.As', 'far', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'concerned', 'good', 'amount', 'interesting', 'content', 'revolving', 'behind-the-scenes', 'production', 'creative', 'process', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'set', 'neat', 'little', 'hard-bound', 'book', 'concept', 'art', 'series', 'well.Overall', 'series', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray', 'treat', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'pricepoint', 'even', 'paid', 'full', 'MSRP', 'considering', 'individual', 'seasons', 'are', '60', 'pre-ordered', 'paid', '105', 'less', 'cost', 'two', 'seasons.NOTE', '1-star', 'ratings', 'be', 'trend', 'people', 'having', 'issues', 'season', 'five', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'far', 'will', 'encounter', 'similar', 'issues.I', 'have', 'close', '400', 'Blu-ray', 'titles', 'good', 'bad', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'own', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'franchise']",StarWars:The Clone Wars:SN1-5(CE/DVD)
1665333,A29VWNV3SOMRJA,B00E8G5H0K,Ultralite,"[2, 2]","I ""upgraded"" to this box set from the individual seasons and am a bit disappointed. The hardcover artbook included with this set is roughly the same number of pages (and same size pages) as each of the art booklets that were included in the Season 1 and Season 2 digibooks. So if you had both digibooks, as I did, you already have twice as much artwork as is included in this entire collectors edition. So that begs the question - did the design of this collectors edition play a role in the discontinuation of those digibooks after Season 2? Did they realize the digibooks were outdoing themselves and might trivialize this collectors edition? Whether or not that's the case, one cannot help but wonder - nor help but be dismayed by the mediocrity of this set.On the upside, the heavily embossed chipboard artbox that this comes in, which admittedly is where the large portion of the manufacturing costs lie, is magnificently done.
