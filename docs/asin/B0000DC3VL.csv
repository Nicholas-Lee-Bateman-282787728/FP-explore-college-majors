No doubt about that. So, once they realized they were surrendered by a lot of cop cars, they began to shoot.I simply didn't understand why the regular officers did not wait, let them go away from the bank, away from civilians, all the while calling SWAT. Only after that, they should have engaged. But, no: seeing all that cars around them with pistols pointing at them, Larry and Emil obviously decided to go all with a bang. And, once the first patrolman was hit, there was no question about this: both of them would never have a proper judgment. (I'm not saying that they deserved one! &Iacute;'m just voicing my opinion).Anyway, Larry committed suicide and some soures say that Emil was, on purpose,left to bleed in the asphalt for more than one hour. (I think that was due to the chaos and to ambulances having to help so many wounded innocents, simply there was no resource for him - bad luck).As a movie, it's clearly intended to glorify LAPD officers, but that's not a sin, because that's what really happened, a lot of officers were decorated.

Instead of containment, should have used some high tech gears to track the the robbers and allow SWAT to take over. This would have saved so many cops and many other citizens.2. Stupid cop comment on citizens legally buying rifles: ""I cannot believe they just let people buy these.."" A real cop would have known that it is the Second Amendment which allows us to bear firearm. In fact, in 1997, the ""Assault Rifle Ban 1994"" was in place and did not allow any civilian to buy any of those rifles unless the rifles were made before the ban. The cop's job is to enforce the law, not to say how stupid the law is.3. They keep referring the M16 as a machine gun. It is not, nor is it a ""high powered"" rifle. Many may even feel the M16 is a baby rifle only a little more powerful than a .22. The civilian version is semi-automatic, not a ""machine gun"" which wasn't even available to civilian because of the ban. Another thing is ""armor piercing bullets"" - most ""regular"" rifle rounds can penetrate Level IIIA body armor, the best armor worn by personnel. There's nothing special about the AK47 rounds the bad guys were shooting. Almost anything shot from any rifle is armor piercing unless the recipient is protected by a rifle plate.4. Obviously written by gun haters, the anti-gun attitude and pro gun control have polluted this movie, but it unintentionally tells people how stupid the gun control is. Criminals don't obey the law but we do. This leaves us with no weapon against criminals firing ""machine guns"" at us. The two perps got their automatic ""machine guns"" (AK47 full auto) with very little effort, while law abiding citizens like you and me were forbidden to have them, not even the semi autos.Compare this incident with ""Texas Tower Sniper Charles Whitman"" where many citizens pulled out their own rifles, started to shoot back and eventually killed the gunman. Their heroic effort minimized how many people had to die in the hands of the madman, Whitman. It wouldn't happen in CA with their gun laws.FYI, those who buy firearms from stores are actually the ultimate good guys as they must go through criminal background checks first. Bad guys just buy guns from the black market illegally; they don't give a crap about the law to begin with which is why they are the bad guys.Again, the movie is not too bad, but with little character building.

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[7, 14]","The tag headline on the DVD box reads ""The most intense shoot out in LAPD history""....unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this weak and slow moving dramatization.Many persons would be quite familiar with the notorious 1997 incident at the Bank of America branch in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles when the ""High Incidence"" bandits finally met their match against dozens of LAPD officers in a ferocious gun battle lasting approximately 44 minutes.This 2003 telemovie is closely based around the events of that day and stars Michael Madsen, Mario van Peebles & Ron Livingston as three police officers caught in the maelstrom of bullets roaring from the bandits gun's. Now, with such gripping source material to work with, three decent male leads and lots of firepower you would anticipate a fast paced, dynamically acted recreation right ?......WRONG !The disappointing ""44 MINUTES"" never really kick's into high gear and since the character development of the three lead roles is so minimal, viewers don't feel any real affinity for their struggle against the homicidal bandits ( played by ex-Ultimate Fighting Championship contender, Oleg Taktarov plus Andrew Bryniarski...seen as ""Madman"" Kelly in ""Any Given Sunday"" ). Director Yves Simoneau primarily treads down the well worn path (originally started by Sam Peckinpah ) of utilising slow motion cinematography of the incessant gunfire, spent rounds bouncing around on the pavement, grimacing cops & police cars being shredded to pieces. However, the film editing is quite boring, so there is no real zest or excitement whilst bullets are flying in all directions, and the LAPD are trying to halt the carnage. Additionally, any tension build up in the film is regularly dismantled by having the main actors talking to the camera (in character) every 5-10 minutes saying how scared they were that day, or that they didn't think they would survive.The script writers & director should have decided earlier on whether they were making a testimonial documentary, or an action movie...because it ultimately fails on both fronts.For my money, if you want to watch more suspenseful, well acted (and action packed) telemovie's based on real life crimes, seek out the gripping ""In The Line Of Fire: The FBI Murders"" starring David Soul & Ronny Cox....or ""In the Line of Fire: Manhunt in the Dakotas"" with Michael Gross & Rod Steiger"".",2,Ploddingly slow retelling of infamous Hollywood gunfight.,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2380,"['tag', 'headline', 'DVD', 'box', 'most', 'intense', 'shoot', 'out', 'LAPD', 'history', '.unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'weak', 'slow', 'moving', 'dramatization.Many', 'persons', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'familiar', 'notorious', '1997', 'incident', 'Bank', 'America', 'branch', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'when', 'High', 'Incidence', 'bandits', 'finally', 'met', 'match', 'dozens', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'ferocious', 'gun', 'battle', 'lasting', 'approximately', '44', 'minutes.This', '2003', 'telemovie', 'closely', 'based', 'events', 'day', 'stars', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Mario', 'van', 'Peebles', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'three', 'police', 'officers', 'caught', 'maelstrom', 'bullets', 'roaring', 'bandits', 'gun', 'Now', 'such', 'gripping', 'source', 'material', 'work', 'three', 'decent', 'male', 'leads', 'lots', 'firepower', 'would', 'anticipate', 'fast', 'paced', 'dynamically', 'acted', 'recreation', 'right', 'WRONG', 'disappointing', '44', 'MINUTES', 'never', 'really', 'kick', 'high', 'gear', 'character', 'development', 'three', 'lead', 'roles', 'so', 'minimal', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'affinity', 'struggle', 'homicidal', 'bandits', 'played', 'ex-Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Championship', 'contender', 'Oleg', 'Taktarov', 'Andrew', 'Bryniarski', 'seen', 'Madman', 'Kelly', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Director', 'Simoneau', 'primarily', 'down', 'well', 'worn', 'path', 'originally', 'started', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'utilising', 'slow', 'motion', 'cinematography', 'incessant', 'gunfire', 'spent', 'rounds', 'bouncing', 'around', 'pavement', 'grimacing', 'cops', 'police', 'cars', 'being', 'shredded', 'pieces', 'However', 'film', 'editing', 'quite', 'boring', 'real', 'zest', 'excitement', 'whilst', 'bullets', 'are', 'flying', 'directions', 'LAPD', 'are', 'trying', 'halt', 'carnage', 'Additionally', 'tension', 'build', 'up', 'film', 'regularly', 'dismantled', 'having', 'main', 'actors', 'talking', 'camera', 'character', '5-10', 'minutes', 'saying', 'how', 'scared', 'were', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'survive.The', 'script', 'writers', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'decided', 'earlier', 'were', 'making', 'testimonial', 'documentary', 'action', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'fronts.For', 'money', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'acted', 'action', 'packed', 'telemovie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'crimes', 'seek', 'out', 'gripping', 'Line', 'Fire', 'FBI', 'Murders', 'starring', 'David', 'Soul', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'Line', 'Fire', 'Manhunt', 'Dakotas', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'Rod', 'Steiger']",44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout

778179,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000DC3VL,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 12]","Watching '44 Minutes' is a strange experience to me. It begins with semi-documentary touch with the grainy images and the actors talking to the camera, but once the bank robbery happens, suddenly the made-for-TV film begins to look like the violent shoot-outs in `Heat.' Lots of bullets fly in the air, making huge holes in the bodies of the cars, and many people are gunned down in the street, police officers and civilians alike. Suppose someone tells you this is made for television, and it would take some time before you believe what is told.Perhaps before the day February 28, 1997, story of '44 Minutes' would be almost unbelievable. Two robbers armed with AK-47s and covered with body armor go into the bank, and open fire on the outmatched police surrounding the building. The only way for the police officers to fight back is to shoot the head of the criminal, but shooting the moving target is extremely difficult. And as you see, standard 9 mm handgun is not the best choice to do that.Though Michael Madsen, Ron Livingston and Mario van Peebles all give solid acting, it is the skillful editing and intense gunfights that are the most impressive in the film. The tension of the life-threatening situation is heightened by the good sound effect that conveys the firepower of AK-47s though the use of shaky camera would divide the opinions. Though some (including me) would say the shaky camera brings realism to the film, others would say it is only annoying.Unfortunately, the characters do not have much time to tell us about themselves. It is understandable that we see no so-called character development as the film is based on the recent events and the real-life people, but the portraits of the LAPD officers here often look like those of the police dramas on TV. The script of Tim Metcalfe gets sometimes flat when it tells of the background story of each character, or Michael Madsen's character who does one thing to keep the loud party-giving neighbors very quiet. It is funny, and I like that scene, but well, is it true? I don't think so.I don't know anything about the accuracy of the film, but as far as the heroism of the police officers are concerned, the film is a success with one of the intense and realistic shoot-outs I have ever seen recently. But with a less conventional and more detailed approach to the characterization of the brave officers, '44 Minutes' could be much better.",4,(3.5 STARs) Intense Gunfights with Slightly Conventional Portraits of Brave LAPD Officers,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,2415,"['Watching', 'Minutes', 'strange', 'experience', 'semi-documentary', 'touch', 'grainy', 'images', 'actors', 'talking', 'camera', 'once', 'bank', 'robbery', 'suddenly', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'look', 'violent', 'shoot-outs', 'Heat', 'Lots', 'bullets', 'fly', 'air', 'making', 'huge', 'holes', 'bodies', 'cars', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'gunned', 'down', 'street', 'police', 'officers', 'civilians', 'alike', 'Suppose', 'someone', 'made', 'television', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'believe', 'what', 'told.Perhaps', 'day', 'February', '28', '1997', 'story', ""'44"", 'Minutes', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'Two', 'robbers', 'armed', 'AK-47s', 'covered', 'body', 'armor', 'go', 'bank', 'open', 'fire', 'outmatched', 'police', 'surrounding', 'building', 'only', 'way', 'police', 'officers', 'fight', 'back', 'shoot', 'head', 'criminal', 'shooting', 'moving', 'target', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'see', 'standard', '9', 'mm', 'handgun', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'do', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Mario', 'van', 'Peebles', 'give', 'solid', 'acting', 'skillful', 'editing', 'intense', 'gunfights', 'are', 'most', 'impressive', 'film', 'tension', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'heightened', 'good', 'sound', 'effect', 'firepower', 'AK-47s', 'use', 'shaky', 'camera', 'would', 'divide', 'opinions', 'including', 'would', 'say', 'shaky', 'camera', 'realism', 'film', 'others', 'would', 'say', 'only', 'annoying.Unfortunately', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'tell', 'understandable', 'see', 'so-called', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'based', 'recent', 'events', 'real-life', 'people', 'portraits', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'here', 'often', 'look', 'police', 'dramas', 'TV', 'script', 'Tim', 'Metcalfe', 'sometimes', 'flat', 'when', 'background', 'story', 'character', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'character', 'who', 'one', 'thing', 'keep', 'loud', 'party-giving', 'neighbors', 'very', 'quiet', 'funny', 'like', 'scene', 'well', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'accuracy', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'heroism', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'concerned', 'film', 'success', 'one', 'intense', 'realistic', 'shoot-outs', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'recently', 'less', 'conventional', 'more', 'detailed', 'approach', 'characterization', 'brave', 'officers', 'Minutes', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better']",44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout
