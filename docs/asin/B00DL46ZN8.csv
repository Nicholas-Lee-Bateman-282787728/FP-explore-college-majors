1657027,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DL46ZN8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Quirky indie comedies are a dime a dozen these days, and their popularity has soared since films like &#8216;Juno&#8217; and &#8216;Little Miss Sunshine&#8217; took Oscar by storm.  Now it feels like every year there is that one film that is trying to be &#8216;Juno&#8217;.  Earlier this year, we got a small film called &#8216;The Way Way Back&#8217; that many were toting as the next big indie Oscar breakthrough, but the trailer gave me heed.  It just looked too light for Oscar.  Reviews confirmed that speculation.But not every movie needs to be an Oscar movie.&#8216;The Way Way Back&#8217; suffers from one major issue; it feels like two movies.  There is the darkly enlightening portrait of Duncan&#8217;s home life (vacation life) with his mother and her creepy boyfriend, and then there is a very tonally different film, that of a young boy coming into his own skin as he starts working at a water park.  I wish that the two halves met better in the middle, but when they attempt to (like in that awkward finale) things get even worse.  Separate, they work to varying degrees, but ultimately the first film is far better than the second and quite honestly you can feel the quality of the film drop every time Duncan goes to the water park, despite the fact that Sam Rockwell is the best thing about the film.He just doesn&#8217;t fit.The film tells the story of a young 14-year-old boy whose father abandoned him and his mother for a younger woman.  Now he is stuck in summer vacation with his mother and her new boyfriend and his daughter.  The new boyfriend, Trent, doesn&#8217;t even try to hide his douchbaggery, and yet Duncan&#8217;s mother seems to ignore it for her own illusion of happiness.  While wasting away at Trent&#8217;s beach house, Duncan strikes up a small romance with the neighbor girl and begins to work at a water park when he befriends a childish man named Owen who, well, refuses to care about much of anything.There is a lot of potential here and yet none of it truly comes together like it should have.  It is an enjoyable film that lacks the connective tissue to make it a good film.  The ensemble is spectacular though, with each performer really nailing their respective character.  I just wish that the film felt more cohesive, and I wish that ridiculous final scene with the tubes was omitted entirely.  &#8216;The Way Way Back&#8217; has a sweet spot, and there is a tenderness and an honesty that permeates much of the darker aspects of the film (the blowout over Trent&#8217;s indiscretions feels so rich poignancy, especially when you couple it with Pam&#8217;s immediate reaction), but this is a prime example of a filmmaker (or filmmakers) who didn&#8217;t quite know how to express all their ideas at once.And was I the only one who was confused about the decade this took place?  Like, I swore this was the 70&#8217;s or something like that until they hit the water park and kids started krumping.Anyways, I can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t recommend it because it has its perks, but overall this is an uneven venture that missed a lot of key opportunities to be something better than it is.",3,"Way, way too uneven&#8230;",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,3140,"['Quirky', 'indie', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'days', 'popularity', 'soared', 'films', '8216', 'Juno', '8217', '8216', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', '8217', 'took', 'Oscar', 'storm', 'Now', 'year', 'one', 'film', 'trying', 'be', '8216', 'Juno', '8217', 'Earlier', 'year', 'got', 'small', 'film', 'called', '8216', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', '8217', 'many', 'were', 'toting', 'next', 'big', 'indie', 'Oscar', 'breakthrough', 'trailer', 'gave', 'heed', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'light', 'Oscar', 'Reviews', 'confirmed', 'speculation.But', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'Oscar', 'movie.', '8216', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', '8217', 'suffers', 'one', 'major', 'issue', 'two', 'movies', 'darkly', 'enlightening', 'portrait', 'Duncan', '8217', 'home', 'life', 'vacation', 'life', 'mother', 'creepy', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'very', 'tonally', 'different', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'coming', 'own', 'skin', 'working', 'water', 'park', 'wish', 'two', 'halves', 'met', 'better', 'middle', 'when', 'attempt', 'awkward', 'finale', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'Separate', 'work', 'varying', 'degrees', 'ultimately', 'first', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'second', 'quite', 'honestly', 'can', 'feel', 'quality', 'film', 'drop', 'time', 'Duncan', 'water', 'park', 'fact', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'best', 'thing', 'film.He', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'fit.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', '14-year-old', 'boy', 'father', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'younger', 'woman', 'Now', 'stuck', 'summer', 'vacation', 'mother', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Trent', 'doesn', '8217', 'even', 'try', 'hide', 'douchbaggery', 'yet', 'Duncan', '8217', 'mother', 'ignore', 'own', 'illusion', 'happiness', 'wasting', 'away', 'Trent', '8217', 'beach', 'house', 'Duncan', 'up', 'small', 'romance', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'work', 'water', 'park', 'when', 'childish', 'man', 'named', 'Owen', 'who', 'well', 'care', 'about', 'much', 'anything.There', 'lot', 'potential', 'here', 'yet', 'none', 'truly', 'together', 'should', 'have', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'connective', 'tissue', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'ensemble', 'spectacular', 'performer', 'really', 'nailing', 'respective', 'character', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'cohesive', 'wish', 'ridiculous', 'final', 'scene', 'tubes', 'was', 'omitted', 'entirely', '8216', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', '8217', 'sweet', 'spot', 'tenderness', 'honesty', 'much', 'darker', 'aspects', 'film', 'blowout', 'Trent', '8217', 's', 'indiscretions', 'feels', 'so', 'rich', 'poignancy', 'especially', 'when', 'couple', 'Pam', '8217', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'prime', 'example', 'filmmaker', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'didn', '8217', 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'express', 'ideas', 'once.And', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'confused', 'decade', 'took', 'place', 'swore', 'was', '70', '8217', 'something', 'hit', 'water', 'park', 'kids', 'started', 'krumping.Anyways', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'don', '8217', 'recommend', 'perks', 'overall', 'uneven', 'venture', 'missed', 'lot', 'key', 'opportunities', 'be', 'something', 'better']",N/A

I can't say it is a bad movie but I wanted to point out the flaws. Ultimately this movie has been done many times before... and much better. I couldn't help but see similarities between this and ""Meatballs.""14 year old Duncan is shy and awkward and stuck going on vacation with his mom, jerk of a boyfriend, and his daughter. Yes this is not going to be a good summer. Upon his arrival, his neighbors offer some option for companionship but being awkward, friendship with the older pretty girl next door isn't likely. So Duncan follows this charismatic manager of the local water park, Owen. Owen, like Bill Murry in Meatballs... is funny and doesn't take life too seriously. Owen also sees that Duncan needs someone to believe in him badly. In essence, Owen is a camp counselor here... just the camp is the water park. Owen hires Duncan and via the employment and support Duncan blossoms, increasing in confidence until in the end he helps his mom leave her jerk boyfriend and gets a kiss from the pretty girl next door.A simple story. Too simple for me. The movie ends awkwardly without much of a pay off. Duncan's transformation doesn't feel earned but rather rushed to get it in for the end. It is touched on for a second but Owen's character raises the question of responsibility much more than in Meatballs. Owen is a park manager... and he acts like a camp counselor (pawning off the work on everyone else). But the movie doesn't want to dwell on any larger issues.  Also the actor who played Duncan probably isn't going to win any academy awards anytime soon.

1657030,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00DL46ZN8,Anthony L.,"[2, 2]","If you were expecting The Way Way Back to be a typical Hollywood comedy, complete with crass jokes, a thin story, and stereotypical hot female characters, prepare to think again. But neither is The Way Way Back an overtly-dramatic, sentimental, and cheesy drama piece that leaves you gagging in treacle. Directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have constructed a breezy and well-acted film with the perfect mix of killer humour and moving drama. Unlike most other comedies out there, The Way Way Back puts a strong emphasis on it's characters (who are brought to life by a colorful cast), meaning that the film stays relatable and at times, surprisingly poignant.Speaking of cast, can we give a shout out to relative newcomerLiam James? His performance as 14-year-old social outcast Duncan is so awkward you feel pity just looking at him. Unlike most teen stars who've played a loser onscreen, James *legitimately* seems a loser who finds confidence and becomes cool, rather than a cool guy who hides his coolness in loser persona to shed it later on. This guy is a talent to hopefully watch out for.The big draw of the movie, however, is probablySteve Carell, who completely sheds his lovable idiot persona playing an absolutely detestable, controlling, dominating stepdad for our hero. Trust me, you're going to hate him by the time the credits roll (but that doesn't mean you don't empathize with him, and that's the power of Carell's performance). However, the biggest scene-stealer in a movie full of scene-stealer's is going to beSam Rockwell, who - in addition of making every movie he is in approximately 47.02% better, and being extremely charismatic - provides all the films biggest laughs.The female supporting cast - Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Maya Rudolph, and *especially* AnnaSophia Robb - are all excellent, hilarious, and interesting in their colorful roles. I was especially impressed in the way that Duncan and Robb's Susanna's relationship remained fresh and touching without ever resorting to cliches or cheesy sentimentality.In fact, The Way Way Back rejects unearned sentiment in favour of honestly-won emotion, and lots and lots of laughs. Now keep in mind that I don't watch a lot of comedies, but The Way Way Back is the funniest film I've see all year (in particular a moment of rich humor comes courtesy of co-director and actor Nat Faxon, Sam Rockwell, some kids stuck in a water slide, and a large black man). Hilarious and filled with humor, but never cheesy or sentimental, The Way Way Back is certainly not original - you've seen all of these elements before.

If there's anything even remotely offensive taking place anywhere, I didn't notice.  That's not a bad thing of course, but there's quite a bit of aimless filler taking place (especially in the beginning) so it's not like I can claim the writing is stellar.  The characters themselves are fine however.  It just takes a while and a desire to sort through the predictable/boring portions in the beginning to really get into this movie.It's about a shy teenage kid played by Liam James who doesn't want to go with his mom and her boyfriend (played by Steve Carell who I swear plays in at least 20 movies a year) to a vacation near the beach, but ends up forced to go along anyway.  This is one of the slowest moving storylines you could ever imagine because it takes forever for the boy to finally open up and overcome his shyness related to talking to girls and other people, and figuring out what he wants to do while he's there.  However the story clearly centers around him so we have to persevere it.  The comedy is on the light/harmless side the entire way through the film.  Basically all the actors are the right choices, the characters are memorable, the acting itself is pretty good but the storyline writing needs a lot of work because the way it is, it's just not interesting enough.The one character that makes this movie Sam Rockwell's character.  Liam becomes friends with Sam at the water ride park.  He's definitely the one actor who spices up a light-hearted comedy in constant need of something to cover up the dryness and the slow movement of the storyline.  Perhaps the funniest part is that Steve Carell actually plays a strict tough stepdad to the teenage boy, and this is just hilarious on so many unintentional levels.  Steve Carell's the LAST person who should be playing this role.Everything about the boy finding a summertime job at the water park, to his interaction with the teenage ladies, to the conflicts that arise with his mom and Steve Carell is all very competent storytelling, but nothing particularly special or what I'd consider must see entertainment which is why this movie is fairly overrated in my opinion.  Nothing special ever occurs.  Maybe we've reached a dead-end in this area pertaining to light family comedies, who knows.Still, I found the Way, Way Back fun to watch and even laughed a few times so it can't be all *that* bad.  The kid with the apparent wandering eye was a minor pleasant addition (though his eyes looked fine to me- I must have missed something here).  Most of the humor comes when the boy goes to work at the water park thanks again, to Sam Rockwell's arrogant character.  Otherwise a good movie but nothing to write home about.  Oh and of course, when three boys become trapped in a slide tunnel at the water park and the technique Sam suggests to remove them.  THAT was probably the best moment of the movie!",4,overrated but certainly decent,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,2986,"['Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'nothing', 'more', 'nice', 'little', 'family', 'movie', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'family', 'movie', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'offensive', 'taking', 'place', 'anywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'course', 'quite', 'bit', 'aimless', 'filler', 'taking', 'place', 'especially', 'beginning', 'not', 'can', 'claim', 'writing', 'stellar', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'however', 'just', 'while', 'desire', 'sort', 'predictable/boring', 'portions', 'beginning', 'really', 'get', 'movie.It', 'shy', 'teenage', 'kid', 'played', 'Liam', 'James', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'mom', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'swear', 'plays', 'least', '20', 'movies', 'year', 'vacation', 'beach', 'up', 'forced', 'go', 'along', 'anyway', 'one', 'slowest', 'moving', 'storylines', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'forever', 'boy', 'finally', 'open', 'up', 'overcome', 'shyness', 'related', 'talking', 'girls', 'other', 'people', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'there', 'However', 'story', 'clearly', 'centers', 'so', 'have', 'persevere', 'comedy', 'light/harmless', 'side', 'entire', 'way', 'film', 'Basically', 'actors', 'are', 'right', 'choices', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'writing', 'lot', 'work', 'way', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough.The', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'character', 'Liam', 'friends', 'Sam', 'water', 'ride', 'park', 'definitely', 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'up', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'constant', 'need', 'something', 'cover', 'up', 'dryness', 'slow', 'movement', 'storyline', 'Perhaps', 'funniest', 'part', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'actually', 'strict', 'tough', 'stepdad', 'teenage', 'boy', 'just', 'hilarious', 'so', 'many', 'unintentional', 'levels', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'LAST', 'person', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'role.Everything', 'boy', 'finding', 'summertime', 'job', 'water', 'park', 'interaction', 'teenage', 'ladies', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'mom', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'very', 'competent', 'storytelling', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'what', ""'d"", 'consider', 'must', 'see', 'entertainment', 'why', 'movie', 'fairly', 'overrated', 'opinion', 'Nothing', 'special', 'ever', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'dead-end', 'area', 'pertaining', 'light', 'family', 'comedies', 'who', 'knows.Still', 'found', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', '*that*', 'bad', 'kid', 'apparent', 'wandering', 'eye', 'was', 'minor', 'pleasant', 'addition', 'eyes', 'looked', 'fine', 'me-', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'here', 'Most', 'humor', 'when', 'boy', 'work', 'water', 'park', 'thanks', 'again', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'arrogant', 'character', 'Otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Oh', 'course', 'when', 'three', 'become', 'trapped', 'slide', 'tunnel', 'water', 'park', 'technique', 'Sam', 'remove', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'moment', 'movie']",N/A

I really liked Liam Jones's performance.  All the actors give great understated performances.The story really is predictable in a way, Duncan is drawn to Sam Rockwell's character and Rockwell is drawn to Duncan.  Why the aging cool guy picks out Duncan is one of those movie tropes that defies reason and is just there to get the two together.

That might do.But then again, maybe a better way would be to write a way, way good screenplay, and then throw that screenplay to your actor candidates. or at least their agents.  After they nearly pass on the project because of the low salaries, they might read it and then nearly beg to take a pay cut to just be part of it all.Well, I'm assuming that this is kind of how it went with really top-notch acting talent such as Toni Collette and Sam Rockwell, but I'm just guessing.  But I'm not guessing that this film was made for a mere five million dollars, which is an unbelievable steal nowadays.  Heck, you could barely cover just the cost of their summer rental for that.  Even in a place that just looks like it's in the Hamptons.I can't say that I liked this film as much as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or even ""The Descendants,"" but it is really close.  The writing was terrific in all three, the directing was terrific in all three, and the acting was terrific in all three.  What else could you ask for really?It seems that the theme of this film is ""Settling.""  The workers at the water park have settled for their ""measly"" jobs for longer than they'd care to discuss.  The water park itself has even settled for a manager that might be out of his mind -- a really funny Sam Rockwell that sure tries to steal the show.  The mother settles for a boyfriend who might have a few skeletons in his closet (I won't say what those skeletons are as that might be a spoiler).  But I guess the title ""The Way Way Back"" has something to do with the very back seats in station wagons.  I had never heard the phrase until today, outside of perhaps in baseball.  Perhaps it is a metaphor for being able to get away from your problems?  Or maybe even take control of them when you decide to by going to your happy place?  And our protagonist finds out that sometimes, while it might be best to be alone, it might be best to be alone together.I just watched a film called ""Lincoln"" this week, which was beyond a snooze-fest.  Many critics have complained about that film's historical inaccuracies that were completely unnecessary as well, but I'm not a history buff so I can't say.  And that film was made for $65 million, which is 13 times the cost of this little gem.  Which producer do you think got the better deal?  While I may not be a history buff, my math skills aren't too bad.I say, ""Why settle for a lousy, overblown film such as Lincoln?"" at 65 mil when you can sit back and truly enjoy yourself for a mere 5?  Take control, and don't be willing to settle for anything less.",5,"It's Way, Way Good",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2803,"['How', 'do', 'get', 'bunch', 'A', 'A-list', 'actors', 'star', 'small-budget', 'film', 'such', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'Well', 'offer', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Hamptons', 'least', 'location', 'lot', 'Hamptons', 'might', 'do.But', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'better', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'write', 'way', 'way', 'good', 'screenplay', 'then', 'throw', 'screenplay', 'actor', 'candidates', 'least', 'agents', 'nearly', 'pass', 'project', 'low', 'salaries', 'might', 'read', 'then', 'nearly', 'beg', 'take', 'pay', 'cut', 'just', 'be', 'part', 'all.Well', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'kind', 'how', 'went', 'really', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'talent', 'such', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', ""'m"", 'just', 'guessing', ""'m"", 'not', 'guessing', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'mere', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'unbelievable', 'steal', 'nowadays', 'Heck', 'could', 'barely', 'cover', 'just', 'cost', 'summer', 'rental', 'Even', 'place', 'just', 'Hamptons.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'even', 'Descendants', 'really', 'close', 'writing', 'was', 'terrific', 'three', 'directing', 'was', 'terrific', 'three', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'three', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'ask', 'really', 'theme', 'film', 'Settling', 'workers', 'water', 'park', 'have', 'settled', 'measly', 'jobs', 'longer', ""'d"", 'care', 'discuss', 'water', 'park', 'even', 'settled', 'manager', 'might', 'be', 'mind', 'really', 'funny', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'sure', 'tries', 'steal', 'show', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'few', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'skeletons', 'are', 'might', 'be', 'spoiler', 'guess', 'title', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'something', 'do', 'very', 'back', 'seats', 'station', 'wagons', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'phrase', 'today', 'perhaps', 'baseball', 'Perhaps', 'metaphor', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'problems', 'maybe', 'even', 'take', 'control', 'when', 'decide', 'going', 'happy', 'place', 'protagonist', 'out', 'sometimes', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'be', 'alone', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'be', 'alone', 'together.I', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'called', 'Lincoln', 'week', 'was', 'snooze-fest', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'history', 'buff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'was', 'made', '65', 'million', '13', 'times', 'cost', 'little', 'gem', 'Which', 'producer', 'do', 'think', 'got', 'better', 'deal', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'history', 'buff', 'math', 'skills', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad.I', 'say', 'Why', 'settle', 'lousy', 'overblown', 'film', 'such', 'Lincoln', '65', 'mil', 'when', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'mere', '5', 'Take', 'control', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'willing', 'settle', 'anything', 'less']",N/A

It's not for nothing that Rockwell, while giving the kid a tour of the park, goes on with an extended bit about the mythical owner demanding that the place be forever stuck in 1983 -- this movie wears its &#34;homage&#34; on its sleeve.  Meanwhile, Toni Collette is dependably great as the divorcee giving it another whirl with an obnoxious car salesman played by Steve Carell, who comes equipped with his own mean-spirited teenage daughter -- a chip off the old block.  And so they all play out a ghastly Brady Bunch scenario at Carell's beach rental during summer vacation: the boy runs off whenever possible and eventually gets a job at the waterpark, the girl sneers at anyone who isn't good-looking, and the adults spend most of their time drunk with Carell's friends and even hitting the ganja when available.  A quiet day at home during a light rain begins with a game of Candyland and turns into a fight.  Good times.  Will our young hero find peace of mind?  Mentoring from a (comparatively) responsible adult?  A kiss from a cute girl?  Well, you'll just have to watch and see, won't you?The revelation here is Carell.  If nothing else, Carell confirms my opinion of the word &#34;buddy&#34; when used with boys.  It's obnoxious to begin with, and, as Carell demonstrates here, can be used with deeply hypocritical condescension.  &#34;Hey buddy, we clean up after ourselves around here.&#34;  &#34;Buddy, I need you to put this life-jacket on.&#34;  &#34;Buddy, on a scale of 1 to 10, you're a 3.&#34;  Carell has spent most -- not all, but most -- of his career being a goofball, but he is so perfect here that I completely forgot who the actor was and just hated this guy.Well, not much else to say about this.  30, 35 years ago this movie would've been dumped on screens for the &#34;summer demographic&#34; -- that is to say, pubescent boys like me back in 79 trying to get out of the heat during summer break.  In those days, movies like &#34;Meatballs&#34; were released by the majors and didn't require a prestigious &#34;independent cinema&#34; sheen to convince people they were good.  We also required a little more farce than what's served up here, and all the stuff with the parents would've been too heavy, man -- a total bummer.  Well, at least we get the waterpark guy who monitors the lines at the top of the waterslide: for reasons of &#34;safety&#34;, he tells the good looking girls to &#34;wait please ... hold ... not yet ... hold ... hold&#34; -- a little more of that and a little less angst might've served this movie better.

For me, that includes movies like &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; and &#34;The Dead Poets Society.&#34;  &#34;The Way, Way Back&#34; is one of those movies.  It is a quite little movie that doesn't have car chases and explosions, there are no gimmicks anywhere, it's just a simple story told in a pretty simple way but still packs quite a punch.The story's main character, who we see the world through his eyes, is 14-year-old Duncan who is on summer break with his mother, her boyfriend, played by Steve Carell, and her boyfriend's daughter.  None of them seem to get along that great and Duncan is truly a fish out of water (pun intended since a lot of this movie takes place in a water park) looking for where he fits in.The two main characters that help Duncan find his way are the manager of the Water Wizz Water Park, played to perfection by Sam Rockwell, and the girl next door played by AnnaSophia Robb.  They keep Duncan on course when he tries to navigate through all the bad things happening at home.  He sees Carell's character, who plays a total jerk that truly makes you want to hate him, kissing another woman and finally blows up when his mother won't do anything about it.Overall this is a story about growing up that I think everyone can relate to in some way or another.  The acting is perfection and the story so believable you are just transported into their world.  Perhaps that's what makes me put this movie into the same category as &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; and &#34;The Dead Poet's Society&#34; as they are all about growing up and finding your voice in the world.Overall I highly recommend &#34;The Way, Way Back&#34; to anyone, a true 5-star effort all the way around.",5,A Quiet Movie That Stays With You,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1811,"['once', 'while', 'movie', 'just', 'chord', 'sticks', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '34', '34', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society.', '34', '34', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', '34', 'one', 'movies', 'quite', 'little', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'are', 'gimmicks', 'anywhere', 'just', 'simple', 'story', 'told', 'pretty', 'simple', 'way', 'still', 'quite', 'punch.The', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'see', 'world', 'eyes', '14-year-old', 'Duncan', 'who', 'summer', 'break', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'None', 'seem', 'get', 'great', 'Duncan', 'truly', 'fish', 'water', 'pun', 'intended', 'lot', 'movie', 'place', 'water', 'park', 'looking', 'where', 'in.The', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'help', 'Duncan', 'find', 'way', 'are', 'manager', 'Water', 'Wizz', 'Water', 'Park', 'played', 'perfection', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'played', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'keep', 'Duncan', 'course', 'when', 'navigate', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'home', 'Carell', 'character', 'who', 'total', 'jerk', 'truly', 'want', 'hate', 'kissing', 'woman', 'finally', 'up', 'when', 'mother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'it.Overall', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'think', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'way', 'acting', 'perfection', 'story', 'so', 'believable', 'are', 'just', 'transported', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'put', 'movie', 'same', 'category', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '34', '34', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', '34', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'voice', 'world.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', '34', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', '34', 'anyone', 'true', '5-star', 'effort', 'way']",N/A

This movie, The Way Way Back, is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a really long time. The cast, the story line, dialogue, all of it together makes one amazing Film !It's not often we find ourselves wrapped up in the life of a character, laughing and crying right long with him, and to have the audience clap at the end of the movie, should show the entire crew working to make this Film know that they did a stellar job.The movie follows a young teen who is 15 on a summer beach vacation with his Mom and her boyfriend, and his daughter. His mom is wrapped up in her boyfriend and the young boy feels left out, feels like he does not amount to much. He befriends a manager of a local waterpark who gives him a job and the two form a really nice friendship, the older one is more like a mentor, gives the boy confidence and self assurance that he IS someone important, which gives him the courage to tackle some issues in his own life.It's a great story, the soundtrack is good, the filming location is really pretty and its an overall fun movie, family friendly, really no bad language or sex scenes which would make it okay for some of the younger teens whose parents are being cautious about what their children see.I just wish it was in more mainstream theaters among these ""popular"" movies, which really amount to nothing compared with this Movie. Please if you are able to find it, even if you have to drive more than a half hour or more, make a trip out of, grab dinner and a movie, you will not be disappointed. It's not often I desire to see a movie at the Theater more than once, but this one, Yes I think I will make an exception.Steve Carell and Toni Collette did a great job as his Mom and boyfriend, Duncan, the main character was also ""young Shawn Spencer"" for you Psych Fans.Sam Rockwell did just a great job befriending Duncan and really making him feel like he was someone important in this world.Five Stars, no question.",5,Wide Release PLEASE,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2170,"['why', 'are', ""n't"", 'captivating', 'movies', 'given', 'chance', 'wide', 'release', 'im', 'fortunate', 'have', 'one', 'movie', 'theater', 'yes', 'single', 'movie', 'theater', 'tix', 'less', '9', 'kind', 'indie', 'independent', 'type', 'films', 'movie', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'cast', 'story', 'line', 'dialogue', 'together', 'one', 'amazing', 'Film', 'not', 'often', 'find', 'wrapped', 'up', 'life', 'character', 'laughing', 'crying', 'right', 'long', 'have', 'audience', 'clap', 'end', 'movie', 'should', 'show', 'entire', 'crew', 'working', 'make', 'Film', 'know', 'did', 'stellar', 'job.The', 'movie', 'young', 'teen', 'who', '15', 'summer', 'beach', 'vacation', 'Mom', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'mom', 'wrapped', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'young', 'boy', 'feels', 'left', 'out', 'feels', 'not', 'amount', 'much', 'manager', 'local', 'waterpark', 'who', 'job', 'two', 'form', 'really', 'nice', 'friendship', 'older', 'one', 'more', 'mentor', 'boy', 'confidence', 'self', 'assurance', 'someone', 'important', 'courage', 'tackle', 'issues', 'own', 'life.It', 'great', 'story', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'filming', 'location', 'really', 'pretty', 'overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'really', 'bad', 'language', 'sex', 'scenes', 'would', 'make', 'okay', 'younger', 'teens', 'parents', 'are', 'being', 'cautious', 'what', 'children', 'see.I', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'mainstream', 'theaters', 'popular', 'movies', 'really', 'amount', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Movie', 'Please', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'even', 'have', 'drive', 'more', 'half', 'hour', 'more', 'make', 'trip', 'grab', 'dinner', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'often', 'desire', 'see', 'movie', 'Theater', 'more', 'once', 'one', 'Yes', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'exception.Steve', 'Carell', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Mom', 'boyfriend', 'Duncan', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'young', 'Shawn', 'Spencer', 'Psych', 'Fans.Sam', 'Rockwell', 'did', 'just', 'great', 'job', 'befriending', 'Duncan', 'really', 'making', 'feel', 'was', 'someone', 'important', 'world.Five', 'Stars', 'question']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","A film about a brooding, depressed, self-esteem-challenged 14-year-old does not, on its face, sound appealing or entertaining.  Add to the mix an overbearing new boyfriend for the teen's divorced mom, a mom seemingly content to look the other way in her desperation not to be alone, and even more angst and misery seems eminent.  But director/writer/actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have waved a magic wand over their delightful film THE WAY, WAY BACK, as this charmer is a keeper.  It's tender, poignant, funny, and uplifting--with a twist of defiance in the end that can't help but make a viewer smile.  When said teen is dragged against his will to accompany his mom and boyfriend to a summer resort--a resort with a very special water park--the magic of THE WAY, WAY BACK begins weaving.The cast is exceptional.  Steve Carell plays boyfriend Trent, a less than savory, pretentious, transparently fake rogue, with the wonderful Toni Collette as teen Duncan's mother, who finally realizes the proverbial line has been crossed.  Kudos to young Liam James as downtrodden Duncan; over the course of this film, Duncan takes an amazing, life-changing journey.  Yet the true scene stealer is brilliant Sam Rockwell as Owen, the ""developmentally challenged"" manager of Water Wizz, the local water park.  I'm used to seeing Rockwell in dark, often sinister roles, so here the actor throws a sensational change of pace; as Duncan's mentor and ardent supporter, Rockwell is funny, yet compelling and very strong.  Other cast members include Maya Rudolph as Owen's often-frustrated girlfriend, and Allison Janney as next-door neighbor Betty, who can't live life to its fullest enough.  Even Faxon and Rash have small, yet satisfying, roles playing employees of Water Wizz.  With spontaneous moments that will have you burst out laughing, or get angry at Trent's callousness, or find a lump in your throat, THE WAY, WAY BACK is a diamond in the rough.

The teen boy (Duncan) starts and ends the movie very much a child and is lucky in this film to get a first kiss; he leaves with his innocence quite in tact. What this move is about are those key, critical people in our lives that enable a person to pivot from a bad place to a much better place. And, in stark contrast, those key relationships that can chip away at ones confidence and make the world a quite miserable place. The latter person in Duncan's life is Trent played by Steve Carrel, in one of his finest acting roles. He is Duncan's mother's boyfriend and without for the most part laying a hand on Duncan is a mean SOB with each interaction with the boy worse than the last. Owen is the man who enables Duncan to pivot from this dark existence into a much brighter place. I love in this movie the transformation of Duncan as he comes into his own. I also like that the film doesn't provide any easy, magic solutions to complicated problems.A second theme is how middle aged parents see that last gasp of vitality and beauty in their own lives and want to grasp it and take full advantage, ditching their responsibility to parent youths who probably need them more than ever.

1657081,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DL46ZN8,FNDNreview,"[15, 21]","The Academy Award winning writing team (The Descendants) of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash are back at it with the coming-of-age drama, The Way Way Back.  Both Faxon and Rash write, direct, and act in the film, which stars Liam James as Duncan - a shy, uncertain 14-year-old that travels to an East Coast vacation house for the summer with his mother, Pam (Toni Collette), his mother's boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell), and Trent's daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin).  Trent and Duncan have a rocky relationship due to Trent seemingly always picking on Duncan or isolating him in some way - forcing Duncan into a world of seclusion.  After arriving at the coast, Duncan feels out of place and miserable until one afternoon when he encounters Owen (Sam Rockwell), the manager of a local waterpark.  Owen befriends Duncan, gives him a job, and encourages him to have fun while being his own person and creating his own path in life.  The dramatic-comedy's supporting cast also includes Allison Janney, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, Jim Rash, and Nat Faxon.While the plot of this film is nothing new, it really does capture the essence and purpose of making a ""coming-of-age"" film.  In order for a film of this nature to succeed, a distinct antagonist really has to emotionally hammer away at the protagonist before the push-back occurs.  Oddly enough, Steve Carell is the antagonist in this film, a role which is completely unlike him, yet he pulls it off in an entertaining, proficient manner.  It's hard to believe - during his scenes in the film - that's he's still the same funny-man that brought us Michael Scott in The Office, and the roles of Brick Tamland in Anchorman and Andy Stitzer in The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  For once, it was an absolute pleasure to watch Carell in a role where he doesn't have to rely on being funny or outlandish.  Carell's dramatic roles are few and far between, but he has previously thrived as these rarely-acted characters, the most notably of which can be found in Little Miss Sunshine.  Speaking of Little Miss Sunshine, Carell is once again reunited with Toni Collette for the first time since the 2006 road drama.There are literally not enough great things to say about the entire cast of The Way Way Back.  Outside of Carell's dramatic performance, Sam Rockwell steals the show.  He brings such a unique enthusiasm to his roles, which is one of the many reasons he's become such a well-respected and sought-after actor.  There's very little doubt Rockwell is well on his way to earning himself an Academy Award - since he's far too talented to not have one already.  Along with Rockwell, the talented Liam James is also making quite a name for himself.  At only 16 years old, James has already had significant roles on television, but none more important than his big screen feature role in The Way Way Back.  James does an admirable job in the role of Duncan - the quiet loner who is searching for his identity.  He brings raw emotion to the screen and meshes well in the role of Rockwell's befriended prot&eacute;g&eacute;.As the film begins, trying to dissect the title of the film is a bit of a head-scratcher.  It's an unusual name for a film, and while it's initially unclear what it means, mostly due to the symbolism only being in the first and last scenes of the film, the title really does earn its meaning by the time the credits roll.  This is a moving film about a boy growing up, finding his own way and becoming his own person, despite being neglected and ridiculed.  Not only is the script well-rounded with the perfect amount of drama and comedy, it's also a respectable theme-driven film that can be watched over and over with enjoyment.  Writers and directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have written another gem, and have created one of the most heartwarming, entertaining films of the year.Overall, The Way Way Back should be seen by anyone and everyone without hesitation.  It features an all-around brilliant cast, in which each member plays their roles exquisitely.  Aside from the slightly predictable and recycled plot, the film has something to offer all movie lovers.  The Way Way Back is full of charm, charisma, and honesty, meshing perfectly with the incorporation of family drama and teenage fun.  Even though this well-written script is a bright spot, the plot is still overshadowed by the superb acting of Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, and the rest of the supporting cast.  There's very little doubt that after viewing this film, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable family film thus far in 2013.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,'The Way Way Back' one of the year's best.,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,4576,"['Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'writing', 'team', 'Descendants', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'are', 'back', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'Faxon', 'Rash', 'write', 'direct', 'act', 'film', 'Liam', 'James', 'Duncan', 'shy', 'uncertain', '14-year-old', 'East', 'Coast', 'vacation', 'house', 'summer', 'mother', 'Pam', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'Trent', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Trent', 'daughter', 'Steph', 'Zoe', 'Levin', 'Trent', 'Duncan', 'have', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'due', 'Trent', 'seemingly', 'always', 'picking', 'Duncan', 'isolating', 'way', 'forcing', 'Duncan', 'world', 'seclusion', 'arriving', 'coast', 'Duncan', 'place', 'miserable', 'one', 'afternoon', 'when', 'Owen', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'manager', 'local', 'waterpark', 'Owen', 'Duncan', 'job', 'have', 'fun', 'being', 'own', 'person', 'creating', 'own', 'path', 'life', 'dramatic-comedy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'Nat', 'Faxon.While', 'plot', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'purpose', 'making', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'order', 'film', 'nature', 'succeed', 'distinct', 'antagonist', 'really', 'emotionally', 'hammer', 'away', 'protagonist', 'push-back', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'antagonist', 'film', 'role', 'completely', 'yet', 'off', 'entertaining', 'proficient', 'manner', 'hard', 'believe', 'scenes', 'film', 'still', 'same', 'funny-man', 'brought', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Office', 'roles', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Anchorman', 'Andy', 'Stitzer', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'once', 'was', 'absolute', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Carell', 'role', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'being', 'funny', 'outlandish', 'Carell', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'previously', 'thrived', 'rarely-acted', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Speaking', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Carell', 'once', 'again', 'reunited', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'first', 'time', '2006', 'road', 'are', 'literally', 'not', 'enough', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'entire', 'cast', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'Carell', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'show', 'unique', 'enthusiasm', 'roles', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'become', 'such', 'well-respected', 'sought-after', 'actor', 'very', 'little', 'doubt', 'Rockwell', 'well', 'way', 'earning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'far', 'too', 'talented', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'already', 'Rockwell', 'talented', 'Liam', 'James', 'also', 'making', 'quite', 'name', 'only', '16', 'years', 'old', 'James', 'already', 'had', 'significant', 'roles', 'television', 'none', 'more', 'important', 'big', 'screen', 'feature', 'role', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'James', 'admirable', 'job', 'role', 'Duncan', 'quiet', 'loner', 'who', 'searching', 'identity', 'raw', 'emotion', 'screen', 'meshes', 'well', 'role', 'Rockwell', 'befriended', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'film', 'trying', 'dissect', 'title', 'film', 'bit', 'head-scratcher', 'unusual', 'name', 'film', 'initially', 'unclear', 'what', 'mostly', 'due', 'symbolism', 'only', 'being', 'first', 'last', 'scenes', 'film', 'title', 'really', 'earn', 'meaning', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'moving', 'film', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'own', 'way', 'becoming', 'own', 'person', 'being', 'neglected', 'ridiculed', 'Not', 'only', 'script', 'well-rounded', 'perfect', 'amount', 'drama', 'comedy', 'also', 'respectable', 'theme-driven', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyment', 'Writers', 'directors', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'have', 'written', 'gem', 'have', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'entertaining', 'films', 'year.Overall', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'hesitation', 'all-around', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'member', 'roles', 'exquisitely', 'Aside', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'recycled', 'plot', 'film', 'something', 'offer', 'movie', 'lovers', 'Way', 'Way', 'Back', 'full', 'charm', 'charisma', 'honesty', 'meshing', 'perfectly', 'incorporation', 'family', 'drama', 'teenage', 'fun', 'Even', 'well-written', 'script', 'bright', 'spot', 'plot', 'still', 'overshadowed', 'superb', 'acting', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'little', 'doubt', 'viewing', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'film', 'thus', 'far', '2013.GRADE', 'AFNDNreview.com']",N/A
1657082,A1TPFCXHCGKTY6,B00DL46ZN8,Frank L. Urbano,"[7, 9]","'The Way Way Back' is really great movie which is both hysterically funny and deeply heartwarming.  It tells the story of Duncan (portrayed by Liam James) and his mother Pam (portrayed by Toni Collette) as they go on a summer vacation with Pam's boyfriend Trent (portrayed by Steve Carell) and his daughter Steph.  Duncan is quiet and shy and evidently not enamored with his mom's boyfriend.  The summer vacation is filled with a lot of adult fun, but Duncan seems to be forgotten in the whole thing, until he finds a place to fit in at a local waterpark, where he meets Owen (portrayed by Sam Rockwell).The movie is filled with hysterical performances by Alison Janney and Sam Rockwell, and it also has a very serious side as it examines the difficult family dynamic between the main characters.  There are several secondary stories which tie nicely into the main story as well.  The story is complemented by a great soundtrack, which has an eclectic mix of songs.Overall, after seeing this movie, you might feel it is a bit formulaic and sappy, but it isn't.  The combination of the very funny dialogue and the serious and heartwarming story of Duncan makes this movie a very fun one to watch.  You will walk away satisfied, both from laughter and probably a few tears as well.This one's well worth your time and whatever you spend to see it.

It doesn't normally happen but this ruined the very spirit of the film for me. You see, The Way Way Back is a film about a single mother who has a boyfriend and a shy kid named Duncan. Duncan is so shy and awkward but under his demeanour there lies a true worthy grit of someone who knows right from wrong. There were scenes involving him smiling and laughing which were easily among the best scenes in the film so he is that likeable.What didn't work for me in the film was Sam Rockwell. From the moment he entered the film you seem to know what he is going to try and do, then a few scenes more and you are convinced you know everything about this man trying to bring a semblance of clarity and pleasantville to the little kid, Duncan. It just all didn't add up well for me. Sam's character was unlikable and I thought Steve Carrel was a gamble that didn't pay off.I did like Duncan's mother and Duncan, the little relationship they shared where Duncan would just hang around the make shift house not willing to come home because he couldn't be bothered.Conclusion - This is a film about growing up and rising out of the odds.

I learned that America's nicest guy, Steve Carrell, can actually act like America's biggest jerk,  2.  I learned that Sam Rockwell, who rarely if ever gets to play a lead role, is absolutely good enough to win an Academy Award,  3.  I learned who Liam James is, he did play the lead role of a 14 year old boy,This movie is told from the viewpoint of 14 year old Duncan who is taken on a family vacation for the summer with his mom's (""Pam""-Toni Collette) jerk of a boyfriend (""Trent""-Steve Carrell) and his daughter, who could not be more glum.  On the car ride to the summer house, Trent tells Duncan that on a scale of 1 to 10, he thinks Duncan is a 3.  That gives you an idea what kind of summer Duncan is in for, at least until he meets Sam Rockwell's ""Owen"" who is HILARIOUS and works at the local water park!  Whoever wrote the dialogue for Owen also deserves an Academy Award (I can't believe I am saying things like this!!!).  Duncan gets a job at the water park which changes his view of life over the course of the summer...for the better, thank goodness.

Although the story is somewhate predictable, this is an enjoyable and sweet little film. It's a coming-of-age story of 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James). He is dealing with the trauma of his parents' divorce. His mother Pam (Toni Collette) has found love again in the form of Trent (Steve Carell) who has a teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). The four take a roadtrip to spend the summer at a cottage by the beach.The scenery is gorgeous and one wonders how all these grown-ups have their summers free to have dinner and beach parties every night. It's a lovely setting for a group of people who are emotionally broken. Duncan is shy and awkward around people, especially girls but neighbor Susana (the lovely AnnaSophia Robb) takes an interest in him. Wacky Owen (Sam Rockwell) becomes his mentor and hires him to work at the Water Wizz theme park.  Owen is little more than a kid emotionally and it is hard to understand why he takes such an interest in Duncan. I can seem creepy but the attention is all innocent as Owen tries to break Duncan out of his shell. Add in the fantastic Maya Rudolph and Allison Janney and we have quite the cast.Both AnnaSophia Robb and Liam James seem to have a bright acting career ahead of them. Both are a joy to watch on screen and along with the a great adult cast, THE WAY, WAY BACK becomes a movie worth watching.Of course, secrets are unearthed. Trent is not the perfect man Pam needs. Carell treats his version of Trent tenderly. It's clear that Trent is emotionally broke and unable to cope with fatherhood or relationships but he is not a bad-hearted guy. Trent needs to grow up just as much as Duncan does.  The story does get predictable but there is just joy in this cast and the setting is so wonderful that THE WAY, WAY BACK is a pleasant movie to watch.",4,SWEET LITTLE FILM WITH A PHENOMENAL CAST,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,1937,"['are', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'see', 'WAY', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'are', '1', 'wonderful', 'cast', '2', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'location', 'Massachusetts', 'story', 'somewhate', 'predictable', 'enjoyable', 'sweet', 'little', 'film', 'coming-of-age', 'story', '14-year-old', 'Duncan', 'Liam', 'James', 'dealing', 'trauma', 'parents', 'divorce', 'mother', 'Pam', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'found', 'love', 'again', 'form', 'Trent', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Steph', 'Zoe', 'Levin', 'four', 'take', 'roadtrip', 'spend', 'summer', 'cottage', 'beach.The', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'how', 'grown-ups', 'have', 'summers', 'free', 'have', 'dinner', 'beach', 'parties', 'night', 'lovely', 'setting', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'emotionally', 'broken', 'Duncan', 'shy', 'awkward', 'people', 'especially', 'girls', 'neighbor', 'Susana', 'lovely', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'interest', 'Wacky', 'Owen', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'mentor', 'work', 'Water', 'Wizz', 'theme', 'park', 'Owen', 'little', 'more', 'kid', 'emotionally', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'interest', 'Duncan', 'can', 'seem', 'creepy', 'attention', 'innocent', 'Owen', 'break', 'Duncan', 'shell', 'Add', 'fantastic', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'have', 'quite', 'cast.Both', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Liam', 'James', 'seem', 'have', 'bright', 'acting', 'career', 'ahead', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'screen', 'great', 'adult', 'cast', 'WAY', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.Of', 'course', 'secrets', 'are', 'unearthed', 'Trent', 'not', 'perfect', 'man', 'Pam', 'Carell', 'version', 'Trent', 'tenderly', 'clear', 'Trent', 'emotionally', 'broke', 'unable', 'cope', 'fatherhood', 'relationships', 'not', 'bad-hearted', 'guy', 'Trent', 'grow', 'up', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Duncan', 'story', 'get', 'predictable', 'just', 'joy', 'cast', 'setting', 'so', 'wonderful', 'WAY', 'WAY', 'BACK', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

A great directing duo, Nat Faxon and Jim Rashhelm, and a great ensemble, in a charming but not too sentimental coming of age drama with a lot of comedy and a lot of heart. The protagonist is the teenage,socially awkward Duncan, played charmingly by the young Liam James. He really leads the cast of sometimes much older and more experienced actors.Duncan's mother (the awesome Toni Collete) is a divorced, probably lonely,woman dating an overbearing car salesman Trent, played effectively by Steve Carell.

My mom said this movie was out.  I saw a preview for it a bit ago and wanted to see it.  So we did.  I am so glad we choose this movie.  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  That being said, the movie is very simple.  There are not a lot of things going on.  Though you may find that the characters have a lot going on in their lives.  Things are changing.  The movie is one I am sure you've seen before.  A girl and her father and a boy and his mother find themselves together.  They go on a trip.  Certain members of the group may not get along.  The mother tries to make everything work.  The boy is shy and kind of a dork.  He finds someone to help him relax and that lets him see that he can be and is a good person.  You will see things happen that will make you ask yourselves why.  Why the people or person would be with the other, when they seem so different and when one seems to really only have themselves in mind.Does that make sense?  I did not want to give to much away.  This movie had 80s summer movie written all over it.  I really enjoyed it.  I will pre order as soon as I can.  The cast is so great in this movie.  You see a lot of known actors.  Even in smaller parts.  You may be able to figure out what is going to happen at the end.  But you may be surprised.  Though, at the very end something happens that really leaves you wondering.  Wonder IF.  Amazing movie.  Check it out!!!!Just a bit more.You really see a reflection of the parents in their kids.  The son does not know who he is.  He is afraid to say what he thinks and to stand up for himself.  The daughter is kind of mean and thinks only of herself.  She does seem to change or at least act different during a part towards the end though.  Very well done.I really liked the colors and general tone of the film.  Everything seemed to be set to the same pallet.  Very relaxing and laid back.  The colors and textures never took over the story of the movie.  Sometimes it seems like things get dragged down by certain elements of movies.  That never happened in this movie.  Such a great movie.  Just go see it.

He starts off as a quiet, socially awkward teenager who learns how to stand up for himself and let his personality show, thanks to guidance of Owen (played by Sam Rockwell).This movie shows the not always pleasant adjustment that kids of divorced parents go through when their mom or dad begins to date.

1657147,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00DL46ZN8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 8]","In the first five minutes of this movie, Trent (Steve Carell), the boyfriend of Pam (Toni Collette), tells Pam's only son, Duncan (Liam James), that he thinks -- on a scale of one to ten -- Duncan is a three. He bases this on the fact that Duncan never goes anywhere or tries to make friends or pretty much does anything except mope around his mom's apartment. Duncan doesn't ""put himself out there."" The three of them (plus Trent's spoiled daughter) are headed up to Trent's beach house for the summer, and Trent hopes that this experience will help Duncan ""get that score up.""Now, look. It's a horrible thing to tell a kid he's a three on a scale of one to ten. It's not bound to be inspiring, like Trent seems to think it is. It's a douchey move, and the movie obviously intends for this to immediately characterize Trent as a douche supreme.But the problem is that Trent, it turns out, is 100% correct.For the first thirty minutes of the film, Duncan mopes around sullenly like a stereotypically bitter teenager, barely talking, enduring everything with insufferable silence, and basically wearing his self-pity on his sleeve. The only thing that makes him a likable character is that he's constantly juxtaposed against Trent's relentless douchey-ness. Douche-osity. Douche-itude. Whatever. The point being: Duncan doesn't do anything to make you root for him other than be quietly put-upon, and his complete passivity -- while understandable -- doesn't really earn him a whole lot of points, especially since he's surrounded by a cast of characters with so much more depth and energy to their personalities, including an alcoholic neighbor, her cross-eyed child, and even her curiously cranky daughter, a girl who takes sullen silence and actually makes it interesting by covering it with a poetically repressed rage.Then, while wandering the area, looking for ironic places to be depressed, Duncan stumbles upon a water park with the unlikely name of Water Wizz. While practicing his silent moping at the park, he is inexplicably befriended by the charismatic manager of the park, a ne'er-do-well named Owen (Sam Rockwell). As Duncan learns to put himself out there and do things outside of the house, his score goes up. Ta da!There is a lot to like about this movie. Toni Collette -- while underutilized -- is amazing as usual. Rockwell is also a win, although he seems to be channeling Bill Murray in the role. Some of the antics at the water park, especially the bits involvingCommunity'sJim Rash, are winners. Even Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry as Trent's friends are pretty good (although, again, not allowed to live up to their potential). The stuff surrounding Duncan isn't half bad, and is worth a watch.The problem is that the backdrop of the film is so colorful and engaging that it makes Duncan and his issues look even duller and more predictable than they already are, like a paint-by-numbers exercise book that only uses black, white, and gray. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way the character is written or acted (or a bit of both), but Duncan sucks the life out of the script, even when he's supposed to be finally finding a spine and learning to love life. It just feels fake.The best example of this comes in a scene about break dancing. MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Duncan, working at the water park, is told to stop some breakdancers who have set up a sheet of cardboard and are doing spins and ollies and whatever they're called. Duncan goes up, turns off the music and begins to remove the cardboard, and -- of course -- everyone boos. Then, bizarrely, one of the breakdancers tells Duncan that he can take the cardboard if he first does some breakdancing himself. At this moment, contrary to anything we've seen in the character so far and propelled by nothing that makes sense, Duncan does some of the worst and most awkward dance moves I've ever seen. And EVERYONE CHEERS. That's right. This group of crunking teens cheers him, shows him some moves, and even helps him spin on his head and ""stick it."" Then they clap as Duncan removes the cardboard and ends their dancing party. I mean, is it just me, or are these the most ridiculously friendly break dancers outside of Sesame Street? I kept expecting them to mock him, or even demand that he leave the cardboard and boom box, but nope. After he does dance moves that would get him mocked off of a Barney video, they applaud and cheer and let him take their fun away. END OF MILD SPOILERS!!!This scene was where I felt a huge part of myself disengage with the film. ""Is this meant to be a farce?"" I wondered, but nope, because the stuff with his mom and her jerk boyfriend is aggressively sincere. I realized, at the end of this scene, that the movie meant for this to be the first catalyst of Duncan ""coming of age.""I didn't buy it. And even when I tried to buy it, all I kept thinking was, ""Trent was right."" Duncan is a boring, gloomy kid -- a three all around -- and it is only when he puts himself out there and tries to do something with himself that he comes out of his shell. I doubt the movie meant for our resident villain to also be the film's moral mouthpiece, and so the flick comes across as disingenuous and cheap when it should be its deepest and most meaningful.Genuinely enjoyable when it's being funny and silly, but boringly insincere when it's trying to be dramatic, this film only half-worked for me.",3,"The Way, Way ...

Duncan (Liam James) is a shy 14 year old in route to a beach town and a cabin owned by his mother Pam's (Toni Collette) boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell).  Along for the ride is Trent's teen aged daughter Steph (Zoe Levin).  We know things are bad right away as Duncan has to ride in in the ""way back"" backward facing seat in Trent's restored vintage Buick station wagon.Playing against type, Carell's Trent is a real jerk, but he sees himself as a sophisticated stud.  Once at the cabin, Trent restarts a friendship with Kip and Joan (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet).  Joan also wants to reignite an affair with Trent and Trent is welcoming even as he courts Pam.  Feeling lonely, Duncan strikes up a friendship with Owen (Sam Rockwell), the owner of the local water park.  Faxon and Rash have supporting roles as employees of the park along with Maya Rudolph, a potential love interest for Owen.Rockwell rocks as Owen a sloppy, lazy manager but with a quick wit and a heart of gold.  Owen takes Duncan under his wing as the adults in his life constantly get drunk and/or high along with their wild next door neighbor Betty (Allison Janney).

His eyes are opened to some of the sadness and disappointments of the adults in his life.

The movie finally opened today, and I went to see it right away.""The Way, Way Back"" (2013 release; 103 min.) tells the story of 14 yr. old Duncan (played by newcomer Liam James) who, along with his mom Pam (played by Toni Collette), her boyfriend Trent (played by Steve Carell) and his 16 or 17 yr. old daughter Stephanie, are going to spend the summer at Trent's summer house on a beach somewhere in Massachusetts. Right as the movie opens, Trent and Duncan get into an already destined-to-be-a-classic exchange: Trent: ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you see yourself?""; Duncan: ""a 6""; Trent: ""a 6? more like a 3... Let's try and get that score up this summer!"". Duncan has a hard time fitting in with anyone but he does seem to be able to talk to Suzanna, the neighbor's daughter who's just a bit older than him. Duncan then strikes gold when he is able to get a job at the local water amusement park (called Water Wizz, which in fact does exist in real life under that name) and gets taken under the wings of the park's manager Owen (played by Sam Rockwell). It doesn't mean that all is well, though. But to tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this is yet another coming-of-age movie in the last several month's, after ""Mud"" and ""The Kings of Summer"", yet this one clearly stands apart from the previous two, both in its bitter-sweet tone, and its depth. Second, this movie is a labor of love for writers-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (they also have a small acting part in the movie), as they have been trying to make this movie for years (winning an Oscar for best screenwriting for ""The Descendants"" a few years ago finally got them on track for this movie). Third, the movie is a nice study of how people, both young and adults, adjust to new situations (following divorce). Most of the immediate families we get to know in the movie comprise of single moms, either with or without a new husband or boyfriend. Fourth, the movie just oozes great acting performances, none more so that from Liam James as the awkward teenager who is flailing his arms about as he is trying go get comfortable with himself and those around him. And what about Steve Carell, who is cast against type, in a role 180 degrees away from the likeable guy he usually plays. Here he plays a jerk whom you'd like to slap in the face and yell ""look at all the hurt you're causing to people you supposedly love"". Carell pulls it off brilliantly. Other notables include Maya Rudolph (as one of the waterpark managers), and Allison Janney as Betty, the loud and possible alcoholic neighbor. She is as outrageous as she is funny. Last but not least, the movie features a great soundtrack (which is available on CD) with tracks from indie-artists like Edie Brickell, Wild Belle, and Ben Kweller, just to name those. (There are also several 80s hits from Mr. Mister, INXS, etc.)When doing a coming-of-age movie like this, there is a thin line between bitter-sweet/moving and overly sentimental. This movie never gets too sentimental. Instead, the directors bring what feels like a very authentic, even if fictional, story about young adults fitting in and also broken families. I'll admit that I was pretty much choking up the last 15-20 min. of the movie. The screening I saw this at today was very well attended, and this movie seems to have all the makings of a hit movie on the art-house theatre circuit. If it wasn't clear enough by now, ""The Way, Way Back"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"4.5 stars...

The story revolves around a young teenager, Duncan, on his family vacation with his mother and her boyfriend and well as the boyfriend's daughter. His relationship with his mom's boyfriend is less than stellar with Trent (the boyfriend) calling him a 3 on a scale of 1-10. The mother is a total wreck of a midlife crisis who can't handle her divorce and is clinging to her awful boyfriend like a life raft in the storm. Duncan at first makes no friends on his trip and eventually strikes out on his own with a bicycle he found in the garage. He starts to hang around at a local waterpark that is full of that small town amusement park charm. The place has it's own way of operating, it's own crazy cast of characters, and it's own folklore. Duncan is eventually offered a job by the owner of the waterpark and he spends the rest of his summer vacation finding acceptance amongst his coworkers. This movie made me feel nostalgic for the summers of my youth. It made me miss the years when summer meant months at the pool. Even though this movie had some truly funny moments it was a bit heavier on the coming of age stuff that Duncan dealt with. Learning how to stand up for himself and how to accept himself. I highly recommend this movie, great cast, great writers,  really nice visuals.

Seeking to escape the heart-heavy atmosphere weighing him down, Duncan peddles to the local water park, finding himself mentored by the comedic Owen (Sam Rockwell).Despite the strong cast of comedians, THE WAY, WAY BACK should not be considered a comedy.

1657225,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00DL46ZN8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 6]","""The Way, Way Back"", written and directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, is a welcome escape in the summer sea of bloated, unimaginative summer blockbusters. Combining funny moments with incredibly rare observations, the film is a gem that deserves to be remembered among the best coming-of-age films.Faxon (star of the short-lived TV show ""Ben and Kate"") and Rash have been working on this project for years. A while back, the stars started to align and they were able to get the relatively small budget together before moving on and signing Sam Rockwell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney and Steve Carell. At the most recent Sundance Film Festival, ""The Way, Way Back"" sold for a near record price to Fox Searchlight and a mid-summer release date was set.Duncan (Liam James) travels with his divorced mom (Toni Collette), her boyfriend (Steve Carell) and his older daughter (Zoe Levin) to the boyfriend's summer house in a sleepy New York beach town. As soon as they arrive, the boyfriend's insecurities begin to rear their ugly heads, but Mom downplays the behavior, desperate for a relationship, any relationship even if there are problems. And the boozy next door neighbor (Allison Janney) immediately insinuates herself into the family's activities. Kip and Joan (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet) are two friends who hang out with the family a bit, but they have problems and insecurities as well. When someone comments ""It's like summer camp for adults"" they weren't kidding. As the vacation continues, and Duncan feels increasingly alienated, he finds solace and friendship in Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), the daughter of Betty (Janney) and Owen (Sam Rockwell), the manager of a rundown water park, Water Wizz.When you watch a film like ""Way Back"" it quickly becomes apparent that someone was crafting this story from events they actually experienced. There are too many moments that seem real, could be real. Jim Rash wrote an early draft of the screenplay based on his own experiences. Later, when he became creative partners with Nat Faxon, they fleshed out the story and ideas and made it something that is, at times, a little magical.As Duncan realizes how much his mom is going to side with her new-ish boyfriend, played completely against-type by Steve Carell, he spends more and more time trying to stay away from them. He spends a lot of time outside and watches as Susanna deals with her own parental issues. There are moments when we think Susanna might become the typical teenage girl, ready and willing to lord her supposedly confident sexuality over the younger boy living next door because many of the girls in her group do this. But she shows some depth and doesn't fall into this trap; she prefers to do things her own way and that means talking with and becoming friends with Duncan. This relationship is especially refreshing and adds nice nuance to the film.Out of frustration, Duncan rides a bike far into the little village and finds the run-down water park. He quickly meets Owen (Rockwell), his girlfriend, Caitlin (Maya Rudolph) and two of the ne-er do well employees, Roddy and Lewis (Faxon and Rash). Owen immediately takes a liking to Duncan and you can see he recognizes a little of himself in the younger boy, so he befriends him and gives him a job. Duncan immediately takes to the new profession like a fish to water and really seems to grow and break out of his shell. These moments are quiet and subtle, making them seem almost downplayed and ultimately more real.But then he has to return home every night. And face the reality of his mom's low self-esteem and her boyfriend's continuing efforts to demoralize him.So the young man seeks refuge at the water park and Owen becomes a mentor to Duncan, listening to him, guiding him and teaching him. These interactions allow the teenager to have fun and forget about his troubles at home.Liam James seems like a natural fit for Duncan, a smart, good looking, normal young teen with pretty typical problems. While this may not be an earth-shattering portrayal, the young actor makes the role very believable. We can all relate to his problems because we have gone through many, if not all, of these issues ourselves. James makes the role believable by bringing the quiet nuances and moments to life.Toni Collette is also pretty much perfect as the single mom desperate to make her new relationship work. Because of this desperation, she overlooks many things, neglecting her needs, her son's needs, losing a little of herself and her son in the process. It is Collette's ability to bring a quiet intensity to this role that makes it work. She doesn't shout a lot, but pain and disappointment register on her face. And when realization hits, it is a powerful moment because it could happen to any of us.The lovable, but awkward guy Steve Carell usually portrays is nowhere to be seen. Instead, he has a lot of problems he has clearly never dealt with, choosing to deflect them upon those around him. It is a good performance and more memorable because it is surprising.As soon as Allison Janney's Betty appears on screen, her mouth opens and she begins a rapid fire litany of booze-induced observations, remembrances and predictions that prove she is simply the perfect person to play this role. Betty insists on becoming a part of the festivities and Janney provides a lot of laughs throughout the film.But the real standout in the cast is Sam Rockwell. I have never been a huge fan, but as Owen, he seems the perfect fit. Again, there are some great comic observances, but the filmmakers have also managed to give him moments of particularly lucid introspection. Owen recognizes a lot of himself in Duncan and while he realizes it is too late for him to change, there is still time for Duncan.""The Way, Way Back"" is a fairly rare film; when you leave the theater you feel like smiling rather than demanding a refund. You also remember moments from it, moments that will make you smile and moments that will make you talk about the story with your friends and family.

But, what really makes it a good film, the characters in the movie are relatable, especially Duncan, a shy 14-year old.  His character is relatable, because I have been shy before and sometimes still am shy.  But, it shows how an isolated teen can find something he enjoys and is good at.

1657233,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00DL46ZN8,V. Berk,"[34, 42]","The Way Way Back is a follow up to The Descendants for writer/director pair Nat Faxon and Jim Rash that premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.  It is a coming of age film focused on an awkward teenager named Duncan (Liam Jones) who has been forced on a vacation with his mother and her new boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell).  The relationship between Duncan and Trent is uneasy to say the very least.  The film opens with Trent telling Duncan that, on a scale of 1 to 10, Duncan is a 3.  Duncan wishes he could be with his father, all while he continues to become more and more disgusted with his mother's choice in Trent.  From their summer beach house he finds a bicycle and makes his way to Water Wizz, a local water park built during the 1980s, and run by Owen (Sam Rockwell) and his girlfriend Caitlyn (Maya Rudolph).  At Water Wizz Duncan finds a place where he belongs as his family life continues to devolve back at the beach house.When The Way, Way Back is centered on the story of a boy living in a divorced family and dealing with his mother's new boyfriend The Way, Way Back is a spot on, honest movie about a teenager growing up in a divided family.  The material at Water Wizz is also enjoyable.  The Way, Way Back does have weaknesses in deriving humor froma generic, disobedient teenage girl  (Trent's daughter) and setting up a sort of romance between Duncan and the girl next store which is essentially the same romance you see in every other coming of age movie.Occasionally hard to sit through due to the overwhelming awkwardness of the situations, one cannot penalize The Way Way Back for its accuracy.  The moments watching 14 year old Duncan respond to his mother and Trent are incredibly genuine and do set the film apart.  It is a rough subject matter to address in film, but it is done well here and is in no way sugar coated.The acting is, like the plot, down to earth.  All the characters are believable.  Steve Carell is an unlikable character, and we are not meant to support him, but the character of Trent does exist as a human being.  The most eccentric role (not to mention, most entertaining) is Sam Rockwell's Owen, but even then we're left with a character who one could easily imagine meeting at a water park.Despite some missteps, and coming of age clich&eacute;s, The Way, Way Back sells itself on its honesty.  Although it doesn't manage to break new ground it is different enough to recommend it to viewers who are willing to sit through it.  If you lived through a divorce as a child the film could either be a tear jerker or it could be a trigger you'd rather not sit through.  From my point of view, it was worth sitting through even with the harsh memories it dug up.  If you're looking for an honest, sometimes humorous, often times serious look at a teen living in a post-divorce family then you should give The Way, Way Back a watch.",4,"""You're having way too much fun.

1657238,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00DL46ZN8,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[88, 103]","Written and directed by the team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (winners of the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Descendants), The Way, Way Back is absolutely one of the best films of 2013 so far. And even saying that feels inadequate because it's such a fine film, a coming-of-age comedy/drama with a great script, fine performances by a superb cast, and directed with a flawless natural touch so that there's never a moment where things feel false or forced.The Way, Way Back is seen from the point of view of Duncan (Liam James), the  shy and awkward fourteen-year-old son of recently divorced Pam (Toni Collette), as they head out on a summer vacation with Pam's also-divorced boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell), and Trent's teenaged daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). Riding in the back of Trent's station wagon, Duncan is visibly less than thrilled at the prospect. It's quickly apparent why in the opening scene when Trent engages Duncan in conversation while Pam and Steph are sleeping, asking Duncan to rate himself on a scale from one to ten. When Duncan shrugs and rates himself a middling ""six"", Trent immediately responds with a down-putting""I think you're a three.  You know why I think you're a three?  Since I've been dating your mom, I don't see you putting yourself out there, bud.  The good news is that there are going to be plenty of opportunities for you to take advantage of at my beach house this summer. It's a big summer for all of us really.  So what do you say you try to get that score up huh?  Aim a little higher than a three?  You up for that, buddy?""Which tells us everything we need to know about Trent and how he deals with people.When they arrive at Trent's beach house, they are immediately greeted by neighbor, Betty (Allison Janney), who like Pam is divorced with kids, teenage daughter Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) and younger son Peter (River Alexander). Later on they are joined by Trent's friends Joan (Amanda Peet) and Kip (Rob Corddry). Duncan feels distinctly out of place and increasingly miserable. Trent and Pam are always partying with Trent's friends (with Trent constantly seeming to find ways to intimidate or humiliate Duncan). Steph is like a miniature version of her father, bossing her own clique around and not wanting anything to do with Duncan. Peter's too young to be company, and Susanna is, well, a girl, and Duncan finds it very difficult to talk to girls. Even when Susanna makes the effort to talk to him.Desperate to get away from the beach house, Duncan finds a small girls' bike - probably Steph's when she was younger - in the garage and takes a ride into the nearby town. At the local pizzeria he sees Owen (Sam Rockwell) busily playing Pacman on an old videogame machine. After watching for a bit, Duncan mentions that there's a trick to the game - a pattern to follow that'd make it a lot easier. Owen looks at Duncan like he's crazy. ""What fun is that?"" Owen retorts. ""Just following a pattern?"" Before he can finish his game though, Owen, who it turns out owns the local water park - the Water Wizz - gets called back to work.  He still has a life left on the game, so he asks Duncan to finish up. But as Owen leaves, he calls back mock-imperiously ""No pattern on _my_ quarter!  Cut your own pattern!"" Which tells us everything we need to know about Owen and how different he is from Trent, something that Duncan immediately picks up on.The next day, Duncan goes to the Water Wizz, partly out of curiosity but mainly to get away from the beach house. The scene when Owen comes across Duncan sitting by himself on a bench is priceless:Owen (deadpan serious):  ""I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.""Duncan (startled): ""What?""Owen: (still deadpan): ""You're having way to much fun. It's making everyone uncomfortable.""Duncan (dejected, getting up to go): ""Okay.""Owen (dropping the act when he realizes that Duncan is taking him seriously): ""Wow! I was just kidding! And that wasn't even my best stuff!""Before Duncan knows it, Owen takes him under his wing and gives him a job helping out at the Water Wizz, giving him both a place to escape to during the day and, more importantly, a place people just accept him as he is. This is the kind of summer job we all wish we had when we were kids (well, all of us who aren't future Trent's anyway).  Given his first real taste of both acceptance and responsibility, Duncan blossoms in the easy-going environment, and for the first time we actually see him happy.It's hard to say enough about the superb cast and the spot-on performances they bring. Liam James (The Killing, Psych) does a marvelous job of bringing out Duncan's coming of age, growing over the course of the film from being withdrawn and uncertain to growing in self-identity and confidence as he confronts the unpleasant realities that his mother is unwilling to face.  Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, Little Miss Sunshine and The United States of Tara) is particularly moving as Duncan's mom, Pam, struggling to deal with being divorced, with raising a teenaged son and with her fear of being alone, and knowing that she's not doing all that good a job at any of it. Steve Carell, well-known from his many, many comedic roles, turns in a highly effective straight-laced performance as Trent, bringing out the character's manipulative and frequently demeaning nature in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Allison Janney (The West Wing)'s Betty is a nice turn as a kind of simpatico counterpoint to Pam, being another divorced mother with kids, trying to do her best and dealing with the same struggles, albeit with a fair amount of drinking, a performance at once both comic and sympathetic. Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaids, Saturday Night Live and Up All Night) is solid as Owen's patient but reaching-her-limits girlfriend, Caitlin. AnnaSophia Robb (Bridge to Terabithia, Soul Surfer) is perfect as Susanna, Duncan's companion in summer-vacation misery and the girl who (after several tries) gets Duncan to open up some. River Alexander has some choice comic moments as Susanna's younger brother, Peter, who's desperate to escape their well-meaning but trying-too-hard mom. And writers/directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash bring good-natured comradery as Roddy and Lewis, veteran employees of Water Wizz, the water park where Duncan ends up working. But it's Sam Rockwell who gives The Way, Way Back a lot of its comic heart as Owen, the laid-back cracking-wise owner of the water park who ends up taking Duncan under his wing and giving him his first tastes of independence, of responsibility, and most importantly of acceptance for simply being who he is and not expecting him to be anything other than that.The screenplay is extremely well done, with a nice even flow and natural believable dialogue that gives depth and development to all of the characters, and is, I feel, worthy of a Best Original Screenplay nomination come Oscar time.  According to an interview, Jim Rash said that the main inspiration for the story was really the opening scene between Duncan and Trent, which was based on a similar conversation he had with his own stepfather when he himself was 14.There is also an interesting story behind how the film ended up with the title The Way, Way Back.  When the script was actually written back in 2007, the original title was The Way Back, which was easily understood given the themes of the film and the way in which it ends.  However, by the time the project was green-lit for actual production, another film with the title The Way Back had just come out in 2010.  So partly to avoid confusion with that film, and partly as a kind of inside joke, Faxon and Rash changed the name of their film to The Way, Way Back.And on a last note of trivia, the Water Wizz is an actual water park in Massachusetts. Everything you see in the Water Wizz scenes - including the staff uniforms - is part of the water park, and most of the extras are locals who actually go there. A nice touch of reality that really adds to the realistic feel of the film.Highly, highly recommended.",5,Absolutely one of the best films of 2013,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,8072,"['Written',
