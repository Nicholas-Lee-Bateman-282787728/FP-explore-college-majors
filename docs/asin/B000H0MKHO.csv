1008641,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B000H0MKHO,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[33, 33]","I bought this DVD a while back and didn't think much of it because it had so much verbal instruction during the practice. I then realized there is an alternate practice mode that uses less verbal instruction once you've learned the routine and/or know a bit about yoga already. You can easily switch from one mode to another if you have an audio button on your DVD controller. If you're new to yoga this would be a great instructional video. I use the version with just the queues, it's great!It has some lovely, relaxing music and Dr. Bell's voice is very soothing and relaxing. The whole practice is very restorative and refreshing.Also, there is a cool yoga timer built into the practice. You need to have a top menu button on your DVD controller and when you press it you can hold a pose for 2, 5, or 10 minutes and then the practice continues. If you practice Yin Yoga this is a great option! You can go very deep into the postures.There are two practices, each run 35 minutes. You can do either one separate or together. Stress prevention is a bit more active and stress relief practice is very restorative & relaxing. He uses props like blocks, bolsters, and straps, but you could get away with not using those items.The stress prevention workout starts with a slow meditative sun salutation series, then on to warrior, tree, wide leg forward bend with a twist, cobbler, boat, seated twists, bridge, and more. What makes this practice different than other DVDs is he holds the poses for a long enough time that you feel it. It might be considered too slow moving if you like fast moving power yoga. There is time in between postures to settle in and feel your body. There is also a froggie version of downward facing dog that my bull dog and I really enjoyed, ribbit ;o)There are also 3 short practices covering breathing, relaxation, and meditation.This is a good DVD and I highly recommend it. The audio option and timer are great additions to this DVD which I have not seen on other productions. The more I use this DVD, the more I like it. Check my other DVD review on Amazon.

1008645,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000H0MKHO,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[17, 17]","In order to manage stress through mindfulness, Dr. Baxter Bell presents two practices. The first focuses on energizing poses and the second focuses on calming the nervous system. If you are interested in avoiding stress related illnesses then you might enjoy one or both of the 30-minute practice sessions. In the first session you may recognize:Practice 1Mountain PoseMini Sun SalutesStanding Forward BendLungesDownward Facing DogChair PoseLocust PoseWarrior IITree PoseSide Angle PoseWide-Legged Forward Standing BendCobbler's PoseBoat PoseHalf King of the Fishes PoseModified BridgeFinal Relaxation Pose (skip this is you want to continue for 60 minutes)While doing the postures it is helpful to have a block or a set of pillows.Practice 2Dr. Baxter Bell's pleasant narration leads you through the poses with some creative visualizations. In the second practice there are lots of stretches and they are held for just the right amount of time. Some of the postures/poses include:Mountain PoseShoulder RaisesEagle Arms (great for tight shoulders)Standing Forward BendWide-Legged Forward Standing BendDownward Facing DogSupported Child's PoseSpinal TwistQueen's PoseFinal RelaxationFor the most part this DVD presents exercises that calm and nourish. With the use of blankets and pillows this becomes a gentle yoga practice. If you put both practices together you can exercise for 60 minutes. Since I did this workout before an interview it gave me a chance to see if it really was able to reduce stress. I feel that this yoga DVD also gave me a clear mind and I felt relaxed and healed. I can recommend this to beginners and intermediates who are seeking a stress reduction program.This DVD also contains a section on breathing exercise a guided relaxation and a guided meditation. For Christians I'd skip the guided meditation as it seems to contain some beliefs from the Hindu religion.

1008646,A2OWR5G2OAQF7C,B000H0MKHO,Sincerely Yours,"[10, 11]","the DVD practice offers two 35 minutes practices, the first covers basic poses like down facing dog, warrior positions and a few hip twists; the second is more to relax and release stress from the body that uses a lot of props like 2X blankets, blocks and a wall.  In addition, there are two 10-min guided practices: meditation and relaxation, which i wished both were longer.Both 35 minutes session were very gentle and instructions were clear.  If you are particularly new to yoga, I think you will enjoy this DVD. I store a lot of stress in my upper body and found this dvd useful, but not targeted for my specific needs.  However, I still got a lot out of using the DVD and still felt the release; but I do need to supplement this dvd with a more targeted stress reliever for particulary bad days.I recommend this dvd to learn about breathing, which is absolutely critical for any yoga practice and the ability to relax, which this dvd does address.",3,I like the option to cut the instructor's voice out,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,953,"['DVD', 'practice', 'offers', 'two', '35', 'minutes', 'practices', 'first', 'covers', 'basic', 'poses', 'down', 'facing', 'dog', 'warrior', 'positions', 'few', 'hip', 'twists', 'second', 'more', 'relax', 'release', 'stress', 'body', 'lot', 'props', '2X', 'blankets', 'blocks', 'wall', 'addition', 'are', 'two', '10-min', 'guided', 'practices', 'meditation', 'relaxation', 'wished', 'were', 'longer.Both', '35', 'minutes', 'session', 'were', 'very', 'gentle', 'instructions', 'were', 'clear', 'are', 'particularly', 'new', 'yoga', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'store', 'lot', 'stress', 'upper', 'body', 'found', 'dvd', 'useful', 'not', 'targeted', 'specific', 'needs', 'However', 'still', 'got', 'lot', 'using', 'DVD', 'still', 'felt', 'release', 'do', 'supplement', 'dvd', 'more', 'targeted', 'stress', 'reliever', 'particulary', 'bad', 'days.I', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'learn', 'breathing', 'absolutely', 'critical', 'yoga', 'practice', 'ability', 'relax', 'dvd', 'address']",Yoga Journal: Yoga for Stress With Dr. Baxter Bell
