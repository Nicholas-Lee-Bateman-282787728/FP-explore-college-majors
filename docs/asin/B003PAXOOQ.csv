1356650,AC4XV78EJG1QB,B003PAXOOQ,Anne,"[0, 0]","This week I watched a new movie coming out by Lionsgate, The Least Among You.  It is inspired by a true story.  Inspired can mean many things, but at the very least it has given the producers of the movie the idea for the movie's story.  I tried to research what the truth is of this movie to no avail, so I'm not sure how factual it is.My plain and simple view of this movie is that it's good--actually, it's very good.  The acting and script hold your attention from the beginning.  It never feels too slow or too fast.  There are several recognizable actors in it including Louis Gossett, Jr., William Devane and Lauren Holly.  This is a movie you can feel good about watching with your high schoolers.  Because of the story theme and content, I wouldn't recommend it for children under 13 years old as the PG-13 rating recommends.  One reviewer mentioned that there is a PG edition out, but I haven't been able to find it on the web.  I didn't notice the language, but I think this is a good movie to watch and discuss with your children--not for them to watch and process alone.  But, it's a great movie to start dialogue about life and faith with your teenagers.The story of this movie is of a young black man who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets caught up during the Watts Riots of 1965.  As probation, he goes to an all-white seminary.  The movie centers on his struggles for acceptance and what he does in those struggles.  His journey to faith in God is very interesting and well handled. He comes to faith amidst the hypocrisy of others around him as they claim to be Christians.  This struggle is one we all live with and I think struggle with in this age of cynicism.  I think it is one that young adults today have to come to terms with more and more today.Many reviewers commented that this film is poorly done and not well filmed.  I would disagree.  I was very impressed by it as a Christian film.  It reminds me a lot of Spitfire Grill--it is a Christian film but it doesn't shy away from this world that we live in.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this video for review from Thomas Nelson.",4,A Movie Worth Watching,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,2152,"['week', 'watched', 'new', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'Lionsgate', 'Least', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Inspired', 'can', 'mean', 'many', 'things', 'very', 'least', 'given', 'producers', 'movie', 'idea', 'movie', 'story', 'tried', 'research', 'what', 'truth', 'movie', 'avail', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'factual', 'plain', 'simple', 'view', 'movie', 'good', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'script', 'hold', 'attention', 'beginning', 'never', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'fast', 'are', 'several', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'including', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'William', 'Devane', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'movie', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'watching', 'high', 'schoolers', 'story', 'theme', 'content', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'children', '13', 'years', 'old', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'recommends', 'One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'PG', 'edition', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'web', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'language', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'discuss', 'children', 'not', 'watch', 'process', 'alone', 'great', 'movie', 'start', 'dialogue', 'life', 'faith', 'teenagers.The', 'story', 'movie', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'caught', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'caught', 'up', 'Watts', 'Riots', '1965', 'probation', 'all-white', 'seminary', 'movie', 'centers', 'struggles', 'acceptance', 'what', 'struggles', 'journey', 'faith', 'God', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'handled', 'faith', 'hypocrisy', 'others', 'around', 'claim', 'be', 'Christians', 'struggle', 'one', 'live', 'think', 'struggle', 'age', 'cynicism', 'think', 'one', 'young', 'adults', 'today', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'more', 'more', 'today.Many', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'film', 'poorly', 'done', 'not', 'well', 'filmed', 'would', 'disagree', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Christian', 'film', 'lot', 'Spitfire', 'Grill', 'Christian', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'world', 'live', 'in.Please', 'note', 'received', 'complimentary', 'copy', 'video', 'review', 'Thomas', 'Nelson']",The Least Among You
1356651,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003PAXOOQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Least Among You honestly didn't do a whole lot for me as far as providing an enticing, enjoyable storyline.  I realize how difficult it was for African Americans back when the riots were going on, but this film didn't really touch upon that particular aspect and instead focused on other areas that made it an absolute chore to watch.Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is how there was most certainly enough potential in the beginning (the first 45 minutes or so) as we witness the black student attend a well-respected college university in Texas.  We quickly find out he's the only African American student there, however, the moment the subject turned away from the struggles the student had to put up with while attending the college and turned towards religion and spiritual beliefs, *this* is when I lost interest.  This is when the storyline became significantly less interesting.This is because religion became an extremely popular subject from this point until the very end of the movie, and even though the film is based on a true story, I believe it would have worked a whole lot better had it focused on the African American student having to find a way to deal with the white kids who'd constantly pick on him (granted, in reality the situation was probably a lot worse than the movie portrays).

Although he states his innocence, he has two choices. One of which is attending an all-white seminary. Richard has dreams that doesn't involve preaching, but he finds this choice better than jail.Very few accept Richard, and as he copes with his new probabtion sentence, he learns that friends he had before seem against him as well. During this time, his mom becomes terribly ill and needs extreme medical care. The doctors first need five thousand dollars to treat her. Can he get through this? Richard faces recurring dreams that he can't seem to understand. He meets ""the gardener in the basement,"" and begins to realize what his purpose in life truly is, and he is a true friend.While Richard is trying to achieve his goal, he is rejected by many that cannot see past race. He begins to see how much strength he really has mentally. Richard is threatened by the seminary president that if he follows through with his goals, he will be put back into jail.Find out how this young man handled these situations and trials.

The Least Among You which is loosely based on a true story takes place during this time period.  Richard Kelly, played by Cedric Sanders, was caught up in the 1965 Watts riots.  He was given a choice to go to jail or go on probation and attend an all-white seminary.Kelly quickly realizes that all may not be what it seems at first.  Teachers that should be helping him are instead harassing him.  Samuel Benton, the gardener played by Louis Gossett, Jr., ends up being an unlikely mentor and friend to Kelly.  Samuel helps him through the trials and tribulations that seem to plague every facet of his life.I was prepared to really like this movie as it sounded like something that we would enjoy.  Instead, both my husband and I found it just okay.  It wasn't one of those movies were we felt like we had wasted our time watching it, but it also wasn't one that we would want to watch again.The acting was fine, but the characters needed to be fleshed out a bit more.  The plot felt under developed, and the story seemed to skip around too much.  While it wasn't our favorite movie, I do believe that this type of movie can be useful to those interested in things that happened during the fight for civil rights in the 1960s.The Least Among You is rated PG-13 for thematic content (drinking, smoking, groping of a woman...), violence, and some drug use, so it's not really a family movie even though it is Dove family approved.Disclosure: I received a copy of The Least Among You from BookSneeze to help facilitate the writing of this review.

""The Least Among You"" was set in 1965, It tells the story of Richard Kelly -Cedric Sanders-, he's sent to an all-white seminary for 2 semesters as part of his probation at his mom's suggestion. One person who really helped Richard was a humble caretaker, Samuel Benton-Louis Gossett, Jr- The acting is magnificent.Kate Allison-Lauren Holly- played a troubled teacher that once was a missionary. She has something in her past that is making her so sad. Parts of this wonderful movie will bring you sadness, joy, tears and leave you in awe.To me it is so sad that people were treated so badly and it wasn't so long ago either. It should make us think what kind of people were we or are now. This movie will really get you to thinking and tell you even one person can make a difference if you only try.I highly recommend this for your collection.
