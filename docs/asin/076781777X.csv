Suzanne talks as if introducing strangers. Others are interviewed, like some news show after a tragedy. [These interviews seem embarrassing, don't they? Do they seem real?] Does the interest of these people in show business seem phony? That gossip seems fake to me. Is TV news just part of show business? The story shows Suzanne's entry into television. She talks to a high school class. Some students volunteer for extra-curricular activities. The story moves on with many events that provide a background to this drama. [Note the differences in their backgrounds. This is a warning to anyone who would judge a person on looks alone.]Suzanne has an affair with a male student, asking him to do something so they can be together. He agrees, and makes a purchase. While Suzanne gives the weather forecast her husband runs into bad luck at home. [No burglar alarm?] When the body is discovered the police start their investigation. Suzanne takes her dog to the funeral. [Believable?] Those students learn of their changed circumstances. The police investigation continues to gather clues. A metal revolver can be located with technical devices. The usual ruses gets the suspect Jimmy to talk. Lydia talks to Suzanne in the mall. ""I thought we were friends."" Police entrapment? She blames Jimmy and Russell of being drug dealers! [Wouldn't a lawyer tell her not to talk about the case?] Will Suzanne meet a friendly stranger? Yes.What chance of success did Suzanne have in show business? She did not come from a wealthy family who could pull strings for her. She had no regular college degree or a lot of experience in TV, or talent in acting. I don't think she would ever be a success in big-city TV. Notice the life-span of people doing the weather reports on TV? Is it the fickleness of the TV audience? Can a job be ended when there is a change in management? A new manager may hire his own people and fire most of the others.A better writer or director would have made a better movie. The one big problem is Suzanne's character. Could she have such a diabolical personality without anyone noticing it in her small town? This movies seems to mock small town people. This story seems to be loosely based on a real crime where a high school teacher recruited students to kill her husband. Wouldn't this relationship be noticed in a small town? When a spouse is murdered the surviving spouse, boyfriends or girlfriends become the prime suspects or ""persons of interest"". Some experienced detectives can notice something funny when talking to these people. Serial killers or organized crime gangs usually have no known connections to the victim that the police can examine, unless they find some clue.

Directed by Gus Van Sant, this movie is the perfect and sexiest dark comedy ever I think. Co-starring Matt Dillion and Joaquin Phoenix are perfectly cast and boy Kidman really steals the show.

She plays Suzanne Stone, who dreams of becoming a t.v. journalist, and no one not even her neglected yet devoted husband will stand in her way.

Buck Henry wrote the screenplay, which should say plenty about the level of intelligence and sly wit at work here.  Nicole Kidman gives the performance of a career as a woman who looks, acts, and dresses like a Barbie doll come to life.  She has completely bought into the myth that, frankly, we all believe to one extent or another.  That is, being on tv is a good thing and validates a person, makes that person more real than real.  Her obsession to be a tv celebrity is like a narcotic for her.Suzanne Stone lives in a fantasy land, imagining that her role as the weather lady on a local cable access tv station will somehow be a springboard for Babwa Wawa type notoriety.  Watching her voracious, yet somehow sadly innocent, ambition is both funny and horrifying.  Kidman plays it perfectly, never winking at the camera.  The story, though based on actual events, is little more than a vehicle for many wonderful performances.  Her husband, played with real comic skill by Matt Dillon, has to go, he's just in the way.  The stoner, semi-goth high school students she enlists for the hit, including Joaquin Phoenix, are charmed and subservient, amazed that a celebrity would pay attention to them.  (As we would be if Oprah asked us to wax her car, which we probably would, because we also believe that being on tv is a good and important thing.)Other inspired performances include George Segal in a splendidly cynical cameo, succinctly summarizing tv business reality.  Dan Hedaya, who must get his 5:00 shadow somewhere around 9:47 a.m., is just right as the guy who settles the score.  But the real sleeper is Illeana Douglas, narrator and Ms. Stone's sister-in-law.  She smells a rat long before anyone else, and her wise-acre sarcastic delivery is terrific, especially as she gracefully skates over the evidence.  That's cold!Van Sant is a very interesting director.  Drugstore Cowboy was as fascinating as it was disturbing.  Elephant offered an amazing look at Columbine through the other end of the lens.  Finding Forrester, a tad trite and commercial, did have heart.  Good Will Hunting, yikes, what did we do to deserve the twin monsters it loosed upon the landscape?  Even Cowgirls Get The Blues, one of the best books ever becomes one of worst movies ever.  My Own Private Idaho. This movie, featuring an unnerving performance by the late River Phoenix, was chilling, haunting, beautiful, and absolutely brilliant.  Van Sant is certainly capable of greatness, and Kidman is also.

14218,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,076781777X,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I had heard a lot of great things about Nicole Kidman's performance in this black comedy, so many good things that I had to check it out.  The problem was that I could never find it anywhere.  Then, gloriously, it came on Encore the other night and so I DVR'd it and settled down to take in the gift that is Kidman.  What I found was not just Kidman's finest screen performance ever, but quite possible Gus Van Sant's finest film ever.  `To Die For' is just that, a film that is to die for.  It is funny, smart, witty and darkly powerful; a film that plays to its strengths, and thankfully it has many of them.Gus Van Sant is a hit-or-miss director with me.  He has a unique style that I appreciate when it is channeled properly (ala `Elephant') but find myself put off when it is misdirected (circa `Psycho').  He attempts to commercialize his talent with mixed results, at times drawing enough star power to make up for lack of material (witness `Good Will Hunting') but then there are times when even his best efforts result in mediocre offerings (take `Finding Forester' for instance).  There is no denying that Van Sant has talent and he has vision, and I respect that, but at times that talent and vision is muddled and produces films I don't feel are really up to par.  Regardless though, I still longed to see `To Die For' if not for Kidman and Kidman alone.Luckily for me, Van Sant is at the top of his game here and matches Kidman's brilliance step for step, pace for pace.  Kidman plays Suzanne Stone, a young and ambitious woman who will do anything to achieve the fame she knows she is destined for.  She marries Larry Maretto, a good looking Italian man who supports her dreams and believes in her, but his support is not enough for it alone won't get Stone what she wants.  When Stone takes her ambitions to the next level, trying to engage some high school students in a news segment, she meets three particular students who prove to be the key to Stone's inevitable success.  Jimmy, Russel & Lydia are putty in Stone's hands, easily manipulated and convinced to go along with Stone's scheme to rid her of her husband and catapult her to the spotlight she so longs for.Fame comes at a cost; and that cost is something Stone will soon have to pay.Van Sant films this black comedy as if it were part mockumentary, which aids in adding connectivity to the film, for it allows the characters to engage to audience and make them a part of the film.  As each actor talks directly to the viewer we begin to feel like a part of their schemes and thus feel an intimate relation to the film.  Even though the film has some devastating situations (murder and adultery) they are played out much like a Coen film, used for comedic effect and so while we are allowed to judge we are never allowed to judge too harshly.Nicole Kidman is a force in this film, a dynamic ball of comedic energy.  The way she can consume her character, delivering each and every line with precision and dedication, creating a character that is funny as can be yet serious as heart attack.  She brilliantly manages to coat her satirical performance with enough genuine sincerity that her character becomes a real person instead of a farce.  Matt Dillon is sorely underused as Larry, Stone's unsuspecting husband.  He manages well with what he is given, but the film (like Stone) is pretty much uninterested with him.  Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland are wonderful as the three dimwitted students whom Stone uses and abuses.  Phoenix has the most screen time, for he plays Jimmy, the student who falls for Suzanne and thus becomes the focus of her attention.  Phoenix has surely turned in finer performances (it's nice to see the fine actor he's become) but this is far from a bad performance.  He captures the mental level of his character, which isn't high mind you, and manages to make him interesting.  His first line in this film alone is priceless.  I also enjoyed the supporting performances by Illeana Douglas and Dan Hedaya who managed to make their small roles seem larger than they really were.In the end `To Die For' is a brilliant satire, a fantastic film about the dangers of fame and obsession.  Sure, it may seem far fetched at times but that's what a satire does; it blows truths out of proportion in an effort to cause the audience to realize the facts resting before their eyes.  In a world so obsessed with being on the top of everything, of being in front of the cameras and in the magazines and on the lips of every living breathing human being, `To Die For' is a wonderful example of why that particular thinking is so far off the mark.",5,Pitch perfect example of misguided reasoning's...,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,4655,"['had', 'heard', 'lot', 'great', 'things', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'black', 'comedy', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'problem', 'was', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'anywhere', 'Then', 'gloriously', 'came', 'other', 'night', 'so', 'DVR', ""'d"", 'settled', 'down', 'take', 'gift', 'Kidman', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'Kidman', 'finest', 'screen', 'performance', 'ever', 'quite', 'possible', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'finest', 'film', 'ever', 'Die', 'just', 'that', 'film', 'die', 'funny', 'smart', 'witty', 'darkly', 'powerful', 'film', 'strengths', 'thankfully', 'many', 'them.Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'hit-or-miss', 'director', 'unique', 'style', 'appreciate', 'when', 'channeled', 'properly', 'ala', 'Elephant', 'find', 'put', 'off', 'when', 'misdirected', 'circa', 'Psycho', 'commercialize', 'talent', 'mixed', 'results', 'times', 'drawing', 'enough', 'star', 'power', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'material', 'witness', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'then', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'best', 'efforts', 'result', 'mediocre', 'offerings', 'take', 'Finding', 'Forester', 'instance', 'denying', 'Van', 'Sant', 'talent', 'vision', 'respect', 'times', 'talent', 'vision', 'muddled', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'really', 'par', 'Regardless', 'still', 'longed', 'see', 'Die', 'not', 'Kidman', 'Kidman', 'alone.Luckily', 'Van', 'Sant', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'Kidman', 'brilliance', 'step', 'step', 'pace', 'pace', 'Kidman', 'Suzanne', 'Stone', 'young', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'achieve', 'fame', 'destined', 'Larry', 'Maretto', 'good', 'looking', 'Italian', 'man', 'who', 'dreams', 'support', 'not', 'enough', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Stone', 'what', 'When', 'Stone', 'ambitions', 'next', 'level', 'trying', 'engage', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'news', 'segment', 'three', 'particular', 'students', 'who', 'prove', 'be', 'key', 'Stone', 'inevitable', 'success', 'Jimmy', 'Russel', 'Lydia', 'are', 'putty', 'Stone', 'hands', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'convinced', 'go', 'along', 'Stone', 'scheme', 'rid', 'husband', 'catapult', 'spotlight', 'so', 'longs', 'for.Fame', 'cost', 'cost', 'something', 'Stone', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'pay.Van', 'Sant', 'films', 'black', 'comedy', 'were', 'part', 'mockumentary', 'adding', 'connectivity', 'film', 'characters', 'engage', 'audience', 'make', 'part', 'film', 'actor', 'talks', 'directly', 'viewer', 'begin', 'feel', 'part', 'schemes', 'thus', 'feel', 'intimate', 'relation', 'film', 'Even', 'film', 'devastating', 'situations', 'murder', 'adultery', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'much', 'Coen', 'film', 'used', 'comedic', 'effect', 'so', 'are', 'allowed', 'judge', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'judge', 'too', 'harshly.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'force', 'film', 'dynamic', 'ball', 'comedic', 'energy', 'way', 'can', 'consume', 'character', 'delivering', 'line', 'precision', 'dedication', 'creating', 'character', 'funny', 'can', 'be', 'yet', 'serious', 'heart', 'attack', 'brilliantly', 'coat', 'satirical', 'performance', 'enough', 'genuine', 'sincerity', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'instead', 'farce', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'sorely', 'underused', 'Larry', 'Stone', 'unsuspecting', 'husband', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'film', 'Stone', 'pretty', 'much', 'uninterested', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'are', 'wonderful', 'three', 'dimwitted', 'students', 'whom', 'Stone', 'abuses', 'Phoenix', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Jimmy', 'student', 'who', 'Suzanne', 'thus', 'focus', 'attention', 'Phoenix', 'surely', 'turned', 'finer', 'performances', 'nice', 'see', 'fine', 'actor', 'become', 'far', 'bad', 'performance', 'mental', 'level', 'character', ""n't"", 'high', 'mind', 'make', 'interesting', 'first', 'line', 'film', 'alone', 'priceless', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'who', 'managed', 'make', 'small', 'roles', 'seem', 'larger', 'really', 'were.In', 'end', 'Die', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'fantastic', 'film', 'dangers', 'fame', 'obsession', 'Sure', 'may', 'seem', 'far', 'fetched', 'times', 'what', 'satire', 'truths', 'proportion', 'effort', 'cause', 'audience', 'realize', 'facts', 'resting', 'eyes', 'world', 'so', 'obsessed', 'being', 'top', 'everything', 'being', 'front', 'cameras', 'magazines', 'lips', 'living', 'breathing', 'human', 'being', 'Die', 'wonderful', 'example', 'why', 'particular', 'thinking', 'so', 'far', 'mark']",N/A

The psychopath is the one area of psychology that no one has a cure for.  Psychopaths lack  moral impulse.  They not only don't have the vaguest idea of what right and  wrong mean, but they also don't understand why other people can get all  exercised about violations of right and wrong.  Kidman in the movie doesn't  murder because it's calculated and she can get away with it; she doesn't  even think that far ahead.  And that's what makes acting a role like this  so blamed difficult.  Kidman pulls it off in what I regard as one of the  two greatest bravura female acting performances in the past quarter  century.  (The other is Kate Nelligan in the 1981 movie, EYE OF THE  NEEDLE.)  If only the screenplay were up to Kidman's level, it would shake  five stars out of me.  There's a little too much fussing about with the  teenagers, and some scenes last too long.

14220,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,076781777X,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[1, 1]","Nicole Kidman is excellent here as ""Suzanne Stone-Maretto,"" the central hub of a two-hour-long blonde joke called ""To Die For"" (1995).  It just may be Director Gus Van Sant's best film.  If the film's darkly straight-faced humor weren't so blantantly bust-out-laughing obvious in its dialogue, the screenplay would be as dark as a noir film with Kidman as the story's femme fatale for everything happening in it.  The film's non-linear narrative goes between normal story-line scenes, ""afterwords"" regarding the incidents in summary, and a scene having the in-character, narcissistic Kidman staring straight into the camera as though the audience were being brought straight into the film's narrative.  Also bringing the audience straight into the film's narrative is a talk-show scene with both the parents of ""Suzanne"" and the parents of her husband, ""Larry Maretto.""  This has the added effect of heightening the need for recognizing the wake-up, distress call on society, particularly involving the current television media which is what the film comments on directly.  Even though the film was released in 1995, its point is just as relevant today, maybe even more so.It seems universally perfect as a comment on narcissism, schizophrenia, and psychological superficiality, here developed dually as a social object, perhaps even mass paranoia--recognizably using sexual overtones to provide at least part of its exploitation--and the implications of a pseudo-social mentality of acceptance-through-denial by consumers who don't recognize it.  The more sex, the more reality t.v., the more Jerry Springer rednecks the film utilizes, the more it reveals the dirtiness of what people enjoy watching.  The film here is standard intelligence training in psychology, and justified, because it pulls away the curtain showing a much darker image than an audience expects or knew existed.  Appropriately, it is Critic Rex Reed of the New York Observer cited in bold on the back of the DVD case: ""Humor, tragedy, sex--this movie has everything!""Matt Dillon plays ""Larry,"" the newly-wed husband to ""Suzanne.""  Dan Hedaya plays her father-in-law, ""Joe Maretto,"" and Kurtwood Smith plays her paternal father, ""Earl Stone.""  It's easy to see how she and her biological father have certain character traits in common.The side-story of ""Suzanne"" documenting the lives of three adolescents, two of them played by Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's brother), comes center-stage later in the film when the point for having this side-story becomes apparent.  Its relevance to the whole of the film's statement furthers the film's theme--that tabloid talk shows exploit and distort the normally private lives of typically poverty-level citizens, provoking them into things like violence, not only metaphorically but also directly, out of the interest in such things brought on by television consumerism.  One of the non-linear elements has the parents of both ""Suzanne"" and ""Larry"" on a tabloid talk show, and it's no different than watching Jerry Springer.  For this and other non-linear scenes, the film restrains itself from fully providing the reason for them until the film's very end as though it were reserving a joke's punchline.",4,"""To Die For,"" a Non-Linear Social Satire of Dark Proportion",1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,3235,"['Nicole', 'Kidman', 'excellent', 'here', 'Suzanne', 'Stone-Maretto', 'central', 'hub', 'two-hour-long', 'blonde', 'joke', 'called', 'Die', '1995', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'Director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'best', 'film', 'film', 'darkly', 'straight-faced', 'humor', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'blantantly', 'bust-out-laughing', 'obvious', 'dialogue', 'screenplay', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'dark', 'noir', 'film', 'Kidman', 'story', 'femme', 'fatale', 'everything', 'happening', 'film', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'normal', 'story-line', 'scenes', 'afterwords', 'regarding', 'incidents', 'summary', 'scene', 'having', 'in-character', 'narcissistic', 'Kidman', 'staring', 'straight', 'camera', 'audience', 'were', 'being', 'brought', 'straight', 'film', 'narrative', 'Also', 'bringing', 'audience', 'straight', 'film', 'narrative', 'talk-show', 'scene', 'parents', 'Suzanne', 'parents', 'husband', 'Larry', 'Maretto', 'added', 'effect', 'heightening', 'need', 'recognizing', 'wake-up', 'distress', 'call', 'society', 'particularly', 'involving', 'current', 'television', 'media', 'what', 'film', 'comments', 'directly', 'Even', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'point', 'just', 'relevant', 'today', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so.It', 'universally', 'perfect', 'comment', 'narcissism', 'schizophrenia', 'psychological', 'superficiality', 'here', 'developed', 'dually', 'social', 'object', 'perhaps', 'even', 'mass', 'paranoia', 'recognizably', 'using', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'provide', 'least', 'part', 'exploitation', 'implications', 'pseudo-social', 'mentality', 'acceptance-through-denial', 'consumers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'more', 'sex', 'more', 'reality', 't.v.', 'more', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'film', 'more', 'dirtiness', 'what', 'people', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'here', 'standard', 'intelligence', 'training', 'psychology', 'justified', 'away', 'curtain', 'showing', 'much', 'darker', 'image', 'audience', 'knew', 'existed', 'Appropriately', 'Critic', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'New', 'York', 'Observer', 'cited', 'bold', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'Humor', 'tragedy', 'sex', 'movie', 'everything', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Larry', 'newly-wed', 'husband', 'Suzanne', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'father-in-law', 'Joe', 'Maretto', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'paternal', 'father', 'Earl', 'Stone', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'biological', 'father', 'have', 'certain', 'character', 'traits', 'common.The', 'side-story', 'Suzanne', 'documenting', 'lives', 'three', 'adolescents', 'two', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'brother', 'center-stage', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'point', 'having', 'side-story', 'apparent', 'relevance', 'whole', 'film', 'statement', 'film', 'theme', 'tabloid', 'talk', 'exploit', 'distort', 'normally', 'private', 'lives', 'typically', 'poverty-level', 'citizens', 'provoking', 'things', 'violence', 'not', 'only', 'metaphorically', 'also', 'directly', 'interest', 'such', 'things', 'brought', 'television', 'consumerism', 'One', 'non-linear', 'elements', 'parents', 'Suzanne', 'Larry', 'tabloid', 'talk', 'show', 'different', 'watching', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'other', 'non-linear', 'scenes', 'film', 'fully', 'providing', 'reason', 'film', 'very', 'end', 'were', 'reserving', 'joke', 'punchline']",N/A

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[1, 1]","InTo Die ForNicole Kidman delivers a magnificent, realistic performance as Suzanne Stone, a devious New Hampshire housewife who dreams of becoming the top TV personality in the world. As a beautiful, manipulative weather girl with a modicum of talent for the job, she uses her feminine wiles to reach her dreams of fame and glory. Unfortunately, she's also greedy and grasping, so she doesn't stop there.Although I think this is a spoiler, other reviews, including Amazon's editorial review, have already mentioned that when her husband gets in the way of her plans, she tricks some gullible teenagers into murdering him. Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the role of the teen boy who is so infatuated with her he will do anything for her. Her sexual escapades with him in front of the other kids are shocking.When I viewed this film it seemed like a drama/thriller with deadly consequences to me, so I was surprised to read that it's supposed to be a dark comedy. I generally enjoy satire and dark comedy, but I saw nothing funny about this movie. If, indeed, it's a dark comedy, then it's pitch black, IMO.I did find the cold, hard, nonchalant attitude of the character portrayed by Kidman to be amusing at times--in a shake-your-head-in-bewilderment kind of way. That made me wonder how a person could ever become so calculating. She seemed to lack a conscience, so perhaps that explains it.The only thing remotely comical inTo Die Foris Suzanne Stone's grandiose opinion of herself.I should have had a clue that it was a satire when I read the name of the brilliant director Gus Van Sant on the credits; he's known for that type of movie and I think he's one of the most outstanding directors in Hollywood.But no matter what they call this well-crafted, well-acted movie, Van Sant drew the best from all the actors. Matt Dillon was excellent in the role of the faithful husband, Joaquin Phoenix perfect in the part of the obsessed teenager and Kidman deserved the 1995 Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role.This is a gripping, blood-chilling, fact-based movie, with so many twists and turns it will make your head spin.

Directed by Gus Van Sant, screenplay by Buck Henry from the book by Joyce Maynard (both Henry and Maynard have bit parts in the film), ""To Die For"" is a wicked little gem of a film.Kidman won the Golden Globe award for Best Actress for her performance, and frankly I thought she should have gotten the Academy Award (unless I remember incorrectly, I don't think she was even nominated for an Academy Award for it). But she is absolutely brilliant in it: chilling, funny, scary, sexy, and horrifically evil.Kidman portrays Suzanne Stone-Maretto: a devious, calculating, self-centered woman who manipulates Larry Maretto (a very sympathetic performance by Matt Dillon) into marrying her, quickly tires of him when he tries to stand in her way of her greatest ambition in life, which is to be the next Diane Sawyer, and soon convinces her teenage lover to kill him for her. Sound familiar? ""To Die For"" was loosely based on the real-life story of Pamela Smart, who seduced her 15-year old lover into murdering her husband.Joaquin Phoenix is Jimmy Emmett, the hapless student who becomes Suzanne's lover; Lydia Mertz is Alison Follard, a young girl who idolizes her; and Casey Affleck is Russel Hines, another student who gets caught up in the scheme. Illeana Douglas is great as Larry's acidic, loving sister Janice, who also gets one of the best lines in the film, and at the very beginning, no less; and Dan Hedaya is Larry's father, Joe Maretto. Dan Hedaya is a master of the ""Believe me, you don't want to see me mad"" performance, with obvious menace just under a calm surface.

If you ever have the great misfortune of tangling with one of these psychopaths, trust me, you WONT be laughing.Nicole Kidman plays Suzanne Stone, the girl who grows up as the center of her family's never-ending attention, the Golden Child Who Can Do No Wrong.  As life goes on, Suzanne hones her manipulation skills, and marries Larry (played by Matt Dillon), who reflects back to Suzanne the image of herself that she wants to believe and see.  Perfect!That is, until Larry demands that the marriage include him.  In bed one morning soon after being wed, Larry wants to make love with Suzanne. She icily shoves his hand away saying ""get your hands off me.""  She has to get ready for work, to ""fix my face"" for the world.  It's performance time, and Suzanne is always on.

When Larry broaches the topics of having children and her helping him out in the family restaurant business, Suzanne decides he has to go.  This girl has global aspirations.  She won't be marginalized with motherhood and a family business!When Suzanne lands a job at a community TV station, she turns a small job fetching coffee and running errands into her role as the weather girl reporting from ""The Weather Center.""

Enter Joaquin Phoenix's character Jimmy Emmet, an introspective but deeply lost teenager who falls hard for Suzanne.  She soon sexually manipulates Jimmy into doing her bidding, with promises of eternal love and ""then we can always be together.""  Her blinding charisma engulfs Jimmy and friends Russel and Lydia, and of course she heartlessly kicks them all to the curb the instant she achieves her goal.If you know anything about narcissism, you'll see all the high points in To Die For: grandiosity, complete disregard for the feelings of others, ice-cold manipulation, and lightning-fast betrayal once the narcissist has achieved her goal.

When this film was first released, most of the reviews that appeared in the newspapers were less than glowing, which put me off this film for a number of years, and when I finally did see it, I was astounded by just how good it is. I suspect the reason why many of the critics didn't like this film was because it is a black comedy and as with most black comedies, if the humour isn't to your taste, it can end up falling flat or not being understood at all. The film is also made in a documentary format, which I can imagine might also annoy some viewers (generally, I don't like this format, but in this case I didn't mind it.

All of the ingredients were there, an incredible and gifted director in Gus Van Sant, what I consider to be Nicole Kidman's finest performance, a wicked and not just satirical script and an excellent supporting cast.Of particular note is Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Jimmy Emmet, the typical high school metal head loser who becomes obsessed with Kidman's evil character, Suzanne Stone-Maretto. Phoenix is a gifted actor with a wide pallet to choose from. Contrast this performance with the job he does of playing The Abbe in Quills. It makes his role in To Die For all the stronger. Allison Folland is also a standout in her debut performance as Jimmy's pathetic friend Lydia Mertz. Together with Casey Affleck as Russel, the three unwittingly become assassins for the callous Mrs. Stone. The story is built up very effectively, and as a viewer there is never any doubt that these three ""dorky"" kids will pull the murder off.Also magnificent and lending strong supporting roles are Dan Hedaya and Illeana Douglas who play Larry Maretto's father and sister, respectively. The part of Larry is played with near perfect un-bravado by Matt Dillon, who does so without his usual pomp and bluster. Basically, Larry is the perfect everyman trying to do right by his new wife and family [....]Hedaya is perfectly cast and uses his natural menacing qualities quite well. My favorite though, is Janice Moretto, Larry's sister played by Douglas, who is the only character who sees Suzanne for what she really is. The dancing on the grave ice-skating bit at the end is also really well done. Douglas doesn't fall once.Hats off to Van Sant for a creating a satirical masterpiece that contains enough side elements to hold the viewers attention through more than one viewing. For instance, what exactly is Suzanne's relationship with her father? Also, the fact that Janice is most likely gay and this might be why she understands Suzanne so well. Cudos as well to the director for the style he employed, blurring the line between film and documentary. Some people have argued to me that To Die For contains too many cuts and flashbacks and consequently the viewer has a difficult time following the action. I do not find that to be true.

14250,A34D06JL7LC6MU,076781777X,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","""To Die For"" features the same character we've seen in hundreds of movies before. A character that is deceitful, stupid, gullible, at times smart, and has delusions of grandeur. The difference between all those movies and this one, is that this movie is told like a documentary, is darkly humorous, and is one of Gus Van Sant's best films. The movie stars Oscar Winner Nicole Kidman (Best Actress, The Hours) as Suzanne Stone, who has apparently done something really bad. Through several interviews (which cut in with the actual events) we slowly learn what took place. Suzanne gets married to Larry Marretto (Matt Dillon) and gets a job at a Weather Station. Suzanne has one dream, one aspiration...To be on a big network television show. And she'll stop at nothing to get what she wants. Anyway, while filming a documentary called ""Teens Speak Out"" she meets Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix), Russel (Casey Affleck), and Lydia (Alison Folland) who are all used as ploys by Suzanne to get what she wants. She seduces both Jimmy and Lydia (Jimmy with sex and Lydia with friendship) and when you have two idiotic un-social people being seduced by a beautiful blonde newsreporter...You can pretty much see what's going to happen for the rest of the movie. I have to admit, this movie is smart for a film in it's respective genre. It uses every cliche invented, you can see what's going to happen a mile away. But Kidman, Dillon, Phoenix, and Affleck are so charming(ly evil, at times) that I couldn't help respecting this movie. I have to say the only fault of the film is that the cover is just as misleading as Suzanne is. Looking at the cover you'd expect a movie chock full of Nicole Kidman naked. Truth is, there isn't any nudity in this film at all. There's sexual situations and a couple scenes that flash by for roughly 2 seconds and are shot from above, but that's as far as it goes. Anyway, what I'm getting at is...Gus Van Sant fans should be pleased.GRADE: A",5,To Die For,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,1960,"['Die', 'same', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'character', 'deceitful', 'stupid', 'gullible', 'times', 'smart', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'difference', 'movies', 'one', 'movie', 'told', 'documentary', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'one', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'best', 'films', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Hours', 'Suzanne', 'Stone', 'who', 'apparently', 'done', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'several', 'interviews', 'cut', 'actual', 'events', 'slowly', 'learn', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'Suzanne', 'married', 'Larry', 'Marretto', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'job', 'Weather', 'Station', 'Suzanne', 'one', 'dream', 'one', 'aspiration', 'be', 'big', 'network', 'television', 'show', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'Anyway', 'filming', 'documentary', 'called', 'Teens', 'Speak', 'Out', 'Jimmy', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Russel', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Lydia', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'ploys', 'Suzanne', 'get', 'what', 'Jimmy', 'Lydia', 'Jimmy', 'sex', 'Lydia', 'friendship', 'when', 'have', 'two', 'idiotic', 'un-social', 'people', 'being', 'seduced', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'newsreporter', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'rest', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'smart', 'film', 'respective', 'genre', 'cliche', 'invented', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'mile', 'away', 'Kidman', 'Dillon', 'Phoenix', 'Affleck', 'are', 'so', 'charming', 'ly', 'evil', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'respecting', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'only', 'fault', 'film', 'cover', 'just', 'as', 'misleading', 'Suzanne', 'Looking', 'cover', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'naked', 'Truth', ""n't"", 'nudity', 'film', 'sexual', 'situations', 'couple', 'scenes', 'flash', 'roughly', '2', 'seconds', 'are', 'shot', 'as', 'far', 'Anyway', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'pleased.GRADE']",N/A

14258,A266V5A29PB10U,076781777X,Mark Keith,"[1, 2]","I want to qualify this next statement by saying I have not seen his version of &quot;Psycho&quot;.  With that aside I would like to say that  &quot;To Die For&quot; is Gus Van Sant's best film to date (&quot;Drugstore  Cowboy&quot; is his second best).  The Buck Henry screenplay is what makes  it so good.Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) is genuinely evil, there is no  doubt about it.  She is the personification of unbridled ambition, willing  to do anything to gain her desired goal.  But she is  more than just the  villain of the movie, she's is the primary sympathetic character.  That's  the ambiguity that makes this a &quot;good&quot; black comedy.  She has a  predatory mammalian intelligence that makes her dangerous, but she is also  naive and just plain none-too-bright at times (though the movie doesn't  abound in overly intelligent characters).  And, I have to admit, Nicole  Kidman has never looked so good to me, though attractive in a  kitschy-kitten sort of way (I'm heterosexual, but I tired quickly of her  repetitious nude screen in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;) .The sad depths  of how far she was willing to go to achieve her ambition is best shown by  the scene directly after her job interview at the little local cable  station.  In this scene she pulls a letter-sized envelope out of her purse,  rips it up and throws it in a garbage can out front.  We don't know what's  in the letter -- no letter was shown to us earlier -- but we can assume it  contained an explicit promise for sexual favors along the lines of a letter  she heard about, a little earlier in the film, in a story told by a  journalist (George Segal) -- a letter that had helped some unidentified,  though supposedly famous, news woman land one of her first important  jobs.Suzanne's husband (Matt Dillon) decides, after a year of marriage,  that she has had her fun playing the weather girl down at the cable  station, but she must now give that up so she could be with him at his' and  his father's restaurant.  Even though this is the event that precipitates  his demise -- her preeminent evil act -- we, the audience, can feel how  robbed she feels.  At no point in the movie is she more a metaphor for the  misunderstood artist, thwarted by the small-mindedness of others.  She sits  stunned and submissive in her chair as he tells her what her life is going  to be like from then on, attempting to separate her from the dream that has  defined her for as long as she can remember.  It is assumed, throughout the  movie, that Suzanne does everything out of selfish motives, but here we see  he has been equally false, marrying her without really believing in her  aspiration to be a news woman, supporting her in her dream for only a short  time, then pulling it away when she feels she might be getting somewhere .  . . though she had duped herself, as usual, about how well her career was  actually going.Suzanne Stone is the evil one in the movie, but none of  the other characters are all that good.  In many ways she is the  &quot;scapegoat&quot; that redeems them.  All the exploitative press about  her crime spawns celebrity status for the cable station manager (Wayne  Knight), a prestige he seems to enjoy, though he had always made light of  her ambition for fame.  Her sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) -- who desires  to be a skater (from her first scene she appears to be not particularly  good at it), and is also depicted as competing with Suzanne for the  spotlight -- describes Suzanne as being  &quot;cold&quot;.  Yet the very  last shot of the movie shows Douglas's character skating on the lake where  we -- and we expect she too knows -- her evil sister-in-law is buried  beneath the ice.  I wouldn't say such an act -- to dance on one's grave,  so to speak -- is especially &quot;warmhearted&quot;.",5,Empathy for the Evil Queen,967852800,"09 2, 2000",2000,3818,"['want', 'qualify', 'next', 'statement', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'version', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'aside', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'quot', 'Die', 'quot', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'quot', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'quot', 'second', 'best', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'screenplay', 'what', 'so', 'good.Suzanne', 'Stone', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'genuinely', 'evil', 'doubt', 'personification', 'unbridled', 'ambition', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'gain', 'desired', 'goal', 'more', 'just', 'villain', 'movie', 'primary', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'ambiguity', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'black', 'comedy', 'predatory', 'mammalian', 'intelligence', 'dangerous', 'also', 'naive', 'just', 'plain', 'none-too-bright', 'times', 'movie', ""n't"", 'abound', 'overly', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'have', 'admit', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'though', 'attractive', 'kitschy-kitten', 'sort', 'way', ""'m"", 'heterosexual', 'tired', 'quickly', 'repetitious', 'nude', 'screen', 'quot', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'quot', '.The', 'sad', 'depths', 'how', 'far', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'achieve', 'ambition', 'best', 'shown', 'scene', 'directly', 'job', 'interview', 'little', 'local', 'cable', 'station', 'scene', 'letter-sized', 'envelope', 'purse', 'up', 'garbage', 'can', 'out', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'letter', 'letter', 'was', 'shown', 'earlier', 'can', 'assume', 'contained', 'explicit', 'promise', 'sexual', 'favors', 'lines', 'letter', 'heard', 'about', 'little', 'earlier', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'journalist', 'George', 'Segal', 'letter', 'had', 'helped', 'unidentified', 'though', 'supposedly', 'famous', 'news', 'woman', 'land', 'one', 'first', 'important', 'jobs.Suzanne', 'husband', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'year', 'marriage', 'had', 'fun', 'playing', 'weather', 'girl', 'down', 'cable', 'station', 'must', 'now', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'father', 'restaurant', 'Even', 'event', 'demise', 'preeminent', 'evil', 'act', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'how', 'robbed', 'point', 'movie', 'more', 'metaphor', 'misunderstood', 'artist', 'thwarted', 'small-mindedness', 'others', 'stunned', 'submissive', 'chair', 'what', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'then', 'attempting', 'separate', 'dream', 'defined', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'assumed', 'movie', 'Suzanne', 'everything', 'selfish', 'motives', 'here', 'see', 'been', 'equally', 'false', 'marrying', 'really', 'believing', 'aspiration', 'be', 'news', 'woman', 'supporting', 'dream', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'then', 'pulling', 'away', 'when', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'somewhere', 'had', 'duped', 'usual', 'how', 'well', 'career', 'was', 'actually', 'going.Suzanne', 'Stone', 'evil', 'one', 'movie', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'many', 'ways', 'quot', 'scapegoat', 'quot', 'exploitative', 'press', 'crime', 'spawns', 'celebrity', 'status', 'cable', 'station', 'manager', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'prestige', 'enjoy', 'had', 'always', 'made', 'light', 'ambition', 'fame', 'sister-in-law', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'who', 'be', 'skater', 'first', 'scene', 'be', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'also', 'depicted', 'competing', 'Suzanne', 'spotlight', 'describes', 'Suzanne', 'being', 'quot', 'cold', 'quot', 'very', 'last', 'shot', 'movie', 'Douglas', 'character', 'skating', 'lake', 'where', 'expect', 'too', 'evil', 'sister-in-law', 'buried', 'ice', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'such', 'act', 'dance', 'one', 'grave', 'so', 'speak', 'especially', 'quot', 'warmhearted', 'quot']",N/A

She persuades via sexual favors another gullible man, this time a teenaged Joaquin Phoenix (in a remarkably good performance) to help her get rid of Dillon so she and he can go off to California to make television history.While the territory is somewhat familiar, it is Kidman's on target performance that elevates this dark little comedy to its heights of excellence.  George Segal has an uncredited cameo as a t.v. exec who lets Kidman know what she needs to do to succeed, and good support is also garnered from Dan Hedaya, Casey Affleck and Holland Taylor as well.TO DIE FOR is a cynically engaging little dramedy which established Kidman as an actress to watch out for.",4,NICOLE DOES NASTY,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1169,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'deliciously', 'dark', 'comedy', 'killer', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Kidman', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Comedy', 'award', 'righteously', 'so', 'devious', 'cunning', 'psychopathic', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'assure', 'success', 'broadcast', 'star', 'gullible', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'kids', 'run', 'father', 'nightclub', 'Kidman', 'undivided', 'attention', 'Aha', 'Kidman', 'other', 'plans', 'future', 'sexual', 'favors', 'gullible', 'man', 'time', 'teenaged', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'remarkably', 'good', 'performance', 'help', 'get', 'rid', 'Dillon', 'can', 'go', 'off', 'California', 'make', 'television', 'territory', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'Kidman', 'target', 'performance', 'dark', 'little', 'comedy', 'heights', 'excellence', 'George', 'Segal', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 't.v', 'exec', 'who', 'Kidman', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'succeed', 'good', 'support', 'also', 'garnered', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'well.TO', 'DIE', 'FOR', 'cynically', 'engaging', 'little', 'dramedy', 'established', 'Kidman', 'actress', 'watch', 'out']",N/A

If anyone ever doubted that she was just another pretty face, if she didn't have a smig of talent, this was the movie that launched her officially into critical and popular acclaim.  I wonder if the real people it was based on had anything to say about it?Nicole Kidman's character, Suzanne Stone Maretto, is based the antics of a New Hampshire woman in the early 1990s.  Pamela Smart, like her counterpart on the opposite coast, Mark Kay Letourneau, was a teacher who had an affair with one of her students.  As opposed to Letourneau's crime, having sex with a minor because she was in love with him, Smart manipulated her teenage lover to murder her husband.  Smart was tired of her marriage.  Suzanne, although portrayed as far more ambitious and having much more sophistication than Smart has, is equally unhappy with her marriage as she feels her husband is holding her back from her career wants in television.  Taking three disadvantaged teenagers under her wing to film a documentary (as Smart did with an orange juice commerical project with her charges), Suzanne lures Jim, played with equal aplomb and skill by Joaquim Phoenix (who also emerged from under the shadow of his later brother, River), into her bed.  Young, inexperienced, and with plenty of white trash around the edges, Jim and his two friends are brought into her plot to murder her husband.  Once caught, Suzanne denies the whole thing.The sense of comedy in this movie, however, is what made it.  While one one hand it could have been a fleshed out version of the American Justice episode, it was made out to laugh at ourselves as well as the people it was about.  The three kids are stupid, yet ernest in so many ways, and while they are trashy they did want acceptance from others.  Her husband's family, in particular his sister Janice, is a conflict to hers and they hide a thin layer of resentment towards this atypical match for Larry.  All the other characters (her coworkers at the TV station, the convention people she meets in Florida, etc.) are just as much fascinated by her as they are taking advantage of her.  And Suzanne herself.  Cold, calculating, and ambitious who won't let anyone stop her from getting to the top; yet, she is not all that bright and knows she has to use her body just as much to get the things she wants.Based on the outcome of the movie as well as the real events, I did leave me wondering what if.  After all, Suzanne said it best.  She said she is a professional person who comes from a good home and background, the three kids are trailer trash.  Who do you think a jury's going to believe?A great movie, ironic and sad and funny.",5,The tabloid tale was never this funny,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,2753,"['Nicole', 'Kidman', '1995', 'last', 'emerged', 'shadow', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'anyone', 'ever', 'doubted', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'smig', 'talent', 'was', 'movie', 'launched', 'officially', 'critical', 'popular', 'acclaim', 'wonder', 'real', 'people', 'was', 'based', 'had', 'anything', 'say', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'Suzanne', 'Stone', 'Maretto', 'based', 'antics', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'woman', 'early', '1990s', 'Pamela', 'Smart', 'counterpart', 'opposite', 'coast', 'Mark', 'Kay', 'Letourneau', 'was', 'teacher', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'one', 'students', 'opposed', 'Letourneau', 'crime', 'having', 'sex', 'minor', 'was', 'love', 'Smart', 'manipulated', 'teenage', 'lover', 'murder', 'husband', 'Smart', 'was', 'tired', 'marriage', 'Suzanne', 'portrayed', 'far', 'more', 'ambitious', 'having', 'much', 'more', 'sophistication', 'Smart', 'equally', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'husband', 'holding', 'back', 'career', 'television', 'Taking', 'three', 'disadvantaged', 'teenagers', 'wing', 'film', 'documentary', 'Smart', 'did', 'orange', 'juice', 'commerical', 'project', 'charges', 'Suzanne', 'Jim', 'played', 'equal', 'aplomb', 'skill', 'Joaquim', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'also', 'emerged', 'shadow', 'later', 'brother', 'River', 'bed', 'Young', 'inexperienced', 'plenty', 'white', 'trash', 'edges', 'Jim', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'brought', 'plot', 'murder', 'husband', 'Once', 'caught', 'Suzanne', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'sense', 'comedy', 'movie', 'however', 'what', 'made', 'one', 'one', 'hand', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'version', 'American', 'Justice', 'episode', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'laugh', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'was', 'about', 'three', 'kids', 'are', 'stupid', 'yet', 'ernest', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'trashy', 'did', 'want', 'acceptance', 'others', 'husband', 'family', 'particular', 'sister', 'Janice', 'conflict', 'hers', 'hide', 'thin', 'layer', 'resentment', 'towards', 'atypical', 'match', 'Larry', 'other', 'characters', 'coworkers', 'TV', 'station', 'convention', 'people', 'Florida', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fascinated', 'are', 'taking', 'advantage', 'Suzanne', 'Cold', 'calculating', 'ambitious', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'stop', 'getting', 'top', 'yet', 'not', 'bright', 'use', 'body', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'get', 'things', 'wants.Based', 'outcome', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'events', 'did', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'Suzanne', 'said', 'best', 'said', 'professional', 'person', 'who', 'good', 'home', 'background', 'three', 'kids', 'are', 'trailer', 'trash', 'Who', 'do', 'think', 'jury', 'going', 'believe', 'great', 'movie', 'ironic', 'sad', 'funny']",N/A

14266,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,076781777X,Only-A-Child,"[1, 4]","In contrast to ""Direct Cinema"" (a documentary style in which the filmmakers do not involve themselves in the action- the camera being all seeing and unobtrusive-even hidden), ""Cinema Verite"" permits the presence of the camera to make a difference in the reactions of those being filmed. Both documentary styles allow a degree of narrative freedom not permitted by the conventional Hollywood-style of a chronologically ordered series of dramatic scenes.The unique feature of ""To Die For"" is the use of both the ""Cinema Verite"" and the conventional narrative styles in the same film. Van Sant inter-cuts a traditional dramatic storyline with simulated documentary style commentaries by the principal characters. The commentaries are not just retrospective, they jump around in time and it is not entirely clear the order in which the interviews took place. Four years later ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" would be made entirely out of simulated interviews.The interplay of the two narrative styles in ""To Die For"" is critical to the advancement of its theme about the contrasting public and private faces each of us constructs. The irony is that the faces presented in the documentary interviews are much more human and revealing than their counterparts in the dramatic scenes. Perhaps not surprising given our ""camera whore"" compulsion, these characters are guarded and private when interacting with each other but liberated, open, and out-there when being interviewed.The most interesting aspect of all this is the plausibility of Kidman's character. At times Suzanne comes across as narcissistic, manipulative, complex, and sophisticated; at other times shallow and naive-dumb. This contrast is because to Suzanne every waking moment is an on-camera moment, yet she is only vulnerably human during her actual on-camera moments. She embodies, to an extreme degree, feelings we have all had in smaller and more subtle ways. She simply lacks the skill and/or desire to conceal them. Almost everyone has encountered someone who, while a skilled manipulator, is utterly clueless as to the transparency of their motives to everyone but the person being manipulated.Kidman's performance is inspired. Her clothes, her speech, her makeup, her hair, and the way she carries herself all make for a unity of complete self-absorbed superficiality. Suzanne pities us mere mortals - not because we are mortal but because we are not her.The producers seem to have gotten a little confused about just who was their target audience, which would account for the film's poor performance at the box office. Although not exactly ""high-brow"", the movie is obviously geared to a relatively sophisticated audience who can relate to black comedy, parody, and its psychological message. But instead of giving their film a unified style (which consistently connects to that audience), they throw in a lot of crude humor and gross cartoonish behavior more appropriate to a teen comedy. Their target audience and even the type of teens who might enjoy this movie are more put off than amused by this stuff.Which gets into the issue of trimming. The pace of the film is a little slow and the scenes where Suzanne seduces James are embarrassingly moronic and unconvincing; although the seduction dance is exceptional. If they trimmed 10-15 minutes from the middle of the film it would have better unity and would move along faster. The seduction angle would work better if kept off screen, there is enough explanation of these events in the various retrospective on-camera interviews. And they should lose some of the Buck Henry crazy teacher stuff-it works once but then becomes repetitive and unfunny.Illeana Douglas is wonderful as Suzanne's disgusted sister-in-law, who closes the film skating on the frozen lake containing Suzanne's body as the credits roll and Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" plays.

The movie was funnier and more satirical than the book. Kidman is great as Suzanne Maretto--she's evil incarnate disguised as a cute, perky blonde  with a penchant for bright, sunny-colored, coordinated outfits and loud makeup. On the night Larry was killed is when we first see her wearing a dark color. Underneath the Barbie doll is a despicable, dastardly soul hungry to join the ranks of Barbara Walters and Connie Chung. At the same time, we know that Suzanne, for all her disturbed efforts, will never, ever make it in big-time broadcasting. She doesn't have the smarts or the savvy, but in her warped mind, she thinks it is her husband Larry that's holding her back. Kidman is especially brilliant when her Suzanne tries so hard to be professional when delivering the weather reports, but ends up sounding silly and amateurish. Kidman is also great during the cocktail scene with the dirty old network executive and his sycophants, because she makes Suzanne sounds so cluelessly stupid. Additionally, I am amazed at how well Kidman mastered the American accent. Joanquin Phoenix rivals Kidman's performance with his portrayal of the dim metalhead Jimmy Emmett, Suzanne's teenage loverboy and husband assasinator. Alison Folland is also superb as the overweight misfit Lydia Mertz, who is dazzled and bewitched by Suzanne. The movie format is that of a series of interviews of the main characters, tied together with  continous commentary by Suzanne  which turns out to be a video she is making for her interview with a big-time network executive. It is Suzanne's over-inflated ego and delusions of grandeur which renders her blind to evil in herself and in others; she fails to see that the bigwig network executive is a cold-blooded killer like herself. Joyce Maynard, the author, makes an Alfred Hitchcock-like cameo appearance in the film as well.  For me, the most chilling part (no pun intended here) was seeing the frozen body of Suzanne underneath the ice in her little coral pink business suit and gold Monet jewelry. One of the most hilarious and telling scenes was the shot of Faye Stone (Suzanne's overshadowed sister) and Janice Maretto as bridesmaids in Suzanne's wedding. As Suzanne's bridal bouquet sails through the air, these two bridesmaids deliberately move away to avoid catching the flowers. Another fun scene was Janice Maretto skating blithely across the pond that has become Suzanne's tomb. She was the perfect character to end the film with, as she was the only one who immediately saw through Suzanne's cutesy facade.",5,Brilliant Dark Comedy of a Hyper-Ambitious Career Gal,1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,2687,"['Funny', 'edgy', 'tragic', 'Van', 'Sant', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'society', 'naked', 'ambition', 'hunger', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'movie', 'was', 'funnier', 'more', 'satirical', 'book', 'Kidman', 'great', 'Suzanne', 'Maretto', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'disguised', 'cute', 'perky', 'blonde', 'penchant', 'bright', 'sunny-colored', 'coordinated', 'outfits', 'loud', 'makeup', 'night', 'Larry', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'wearing', 'dark', 'color', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'despicable', 'dastardly', 'soul', 'hungry', 'join', 'ranks', 'Barbara', 'Walters', 'Connie', 'Chung', 'same', 'time', 'know', 'Suzanne', 'disturbed', 'efforts', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'make', 'big-time', 'broadcasting', ""n't"", 'have', 'smarts', 'savvy', 'warped', 'mind', 'husband', 'Larry', 'holding', 'back', 'Kidman', 'especially', 'brilliant', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'professional', 'when', 'delivering', 'weather', 'reports', 'up', 'sounding', 'silly', 'amateurish', 'Kidman', 'also', 'great', 'cocktail', 'scene', 'dirty', 'old', 'network', 'executive', 'sycophants', 'Suzanne', 'sounds', 'so', 'cluelessly', 'stupid', 'Additionally', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'Kidman', 'mastered', 'American', 'accent', 'Joanquin', 'Phoenix', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'dim', 'metalhead', 'Jimmy', 'Emmett', 'Suzanne', 'teenage', 'loverboy', 'husband', 'assasinator', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'also', 'superb', 'overweight', 'misfit', 'Lydia', 'Mertz', 'who', 'dazzled', 'bewitched', 'Suzanne', 'movie', 'format', 'series', 'interviews', 'main', 'characters', 'tied', 'together', 'continous', 'commentary', 'Suzanne', 'out', 'be', 'video', 'making', 'interview', 'big-time', 'network', 'executive', 'Suzanne', 'over-inflated', 'ego', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'blind', 'evil', 'others', 'see', 'bigwig', 'network', 'executive', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'Joyce', 'Maynard', 'author', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock-like', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'chilling', 'part', 'pun', 'intended', 'here', 'was', 'seeing', 'frozen', 'body', 'Suzanne', 'ice', 'little', 'coral', 'pink', 'business', 'suit', 'gold', 'Monet', 'jewelry', 'One', 'most', 'hilarious', 'telling', 'scenes', 'was', 'shot', 'Faye', 'Stone', 'Suzanne', 'overshadowed', 'sister', 'Janice', 'Maretto', 'bridesmaids', 'Suzanne', 'wedding', 'Suzanne', 'bridal', 'bouquet', 'air', 'two', 'bridesmaids', 'deliberately', 'move', 'away', 'avoid', 'catching', 'flowers', 'fun', 'scene', 'was', 'Janice', 'Maretto', 'skating', 'blithely', 'pond', 'become', 'Suzanne', 'tomb', 'was', 'perfect', 'character', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'immediately', 'saw', 'Suzanne', 'cutesy', 'facade']",N/A

The result is a pleasantly watchable movie that moves quickly and keeps you guessing the limits to which our protagonist would limp to achieve her ambitious goals.I felt that the premise, beyond its chirpy surface, is quite thought-provoking. If our perky weather reporter were to be successful in her quest then we could believe that total dedication to a quest is admirable and ultimately rewarded -- regardless of the means employed. Can we condone murder though? Perhaps we are offered a tongue-in-cheek hyperbole that extremes are necessary if we are to escape our station in life.This movie apart from amusing you will surely leave you with something to savor, not just off its theme but from the brilliant supporting performances of Casey Affleck, Matt Dillon and especially Joaquin Phoenix.Recommended rental.",4,"ICY, SATIRICAL DARK COMEDY",1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,1342,"['Nothing', 'little', 'dark', 'humor', 'feminine', 'fangs', 'make', 'mash', 'culture', 'driven', '15-minutes-of-fame', 'case', 'riveting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'perky', 'self-obsessed', 'suburban', 'nutcase', 'who', 'big', 'dreams', 'finding', 'fame', 'fortune', 'even', 'expense', 'husband.Directed', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'usual', 'cobbled-together', 'manner', 'hoary', 'quasi-documentary', 'devices', 'propel', 'screenplay', 'regular', 'flashbacks', 'direct-to-the-camera', 'diction', 'etc..', 'based', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'trippy', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'result', 'pleasantly', 'watchable', 'movie', 'quickly', 'guessing', 'limits', 'protagonist', 'would', 'limp', 'achieve', 'ambitious', 'goals.I', 'felt', 'premise', 'chirpy', 'surface', 'quite', 'thought-provoking', 'perky', 'weather', 'reporter', 'were', 'be', 'successful', 'quest', 'then', 'could', 'believe', 'total', 'dedication', 'quest', 'admirable', 'ultimately', 'rewarded', 'regardless', 'means', 'employed', 'Can', 'condone', 'murder', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'offered', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'hyperbole', 'extremes', 'are', 'necessary', 'are', 'escape', 'station', 'life.This', 'movie', 'apart', 'amusing', 'will', 'surely', 'leave', 'something', 'savor', 'not', 'just', 'theme', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'especially', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix.Recommended', 'rental']",N/A

The first time we meet her character, Suzanne Stone, loosely based on the real-life Pamela Smart, we are made aware that she is the most self-absorbed woman on earth. From offering unwanted beauty advice to her future sister-in-law (which includes the leading statement that Gorby would have done better in Russia ""if he'd had that big purple thing taken off""), to admitting that she was like Jane Pauley (""but we don't have to struggle with the weight problem like she does""), we are served up a delicious character study of a conniving and deeply superficial young woman who will stop at nothing to achieve her dreams of international attention. Meeting Larry (Dillon), a handsome down-to-earth guy who falls hard for her, she takes him ""from Van Halen to Jerry Vale,"" according to his sister Janice. Janice, who skates ""the Peggy Lipton part in an ice skating tribute to the Mod Squad"", provides the voiceover that tells the story. Life with Suzanne isn't quite as fairytale-ish as Larry planned it - when he brings up the subject of children, she cuts him off with, ""If you wanted a babysitter you should have married Mary Poppins"". Suzanne realizes the marriage is a mistake, but uses the opportunity to further herself. Dressed to kill and clawing her way to the top, Suzanne insinuates into the lives of three disenfranchised teens -- kids who would not be able to tell you what their aspirations were even if they knew what the word meant, whom she gratuitously practices her powers of manipulation on. ""The road we chose to travel on was paved with many speedbumps,"" she tells them, as she involves them in her scheme to murder her husband. Besotted with this glamorous figure, the teens do as she commands. In one of the most hysterical scenes in any movie, Kidman's character has a record player brought to the funeral and she mourns to the song ""All By Myself"" in front of the assembled crowd. But, of course, over time, the close-knit group unravels and under ceaseless pressure from the authorities, they begin to crack. Alison Folland, as the young teen girl, has a heartbreaking and hilarious confrontation scene at the mall with her monstrous mentor, and she nails the character of the confused adolescent perfectly. Van Sant's direction is quirky and lively, and more than a bit sarcastic. In scenes such as the masturbation fantasy, and skating over the pond under which the body is frozen, Van Sant (*Drugstore Cowboy* and *Private Idaho*) is at his best visually and conceptually, and has created a complex and compelling film that sets forth immensely disturbing issues, but also manages to be a comedy that is both hysterical and wicked.",4,Hysterical and Wicked,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2930,"[""'re"", 'not', 'anybody', 'America', ""'re"", 'TV', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'Lady', 'Di', 'dropped', 'prince', 'went', 'nudist', '*To', 'Die', 'For*', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'crossover', 'film', 'taking', 'wife', 'status', 'major', 'A-list', 'actress', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'character', 'Suzanne', 'Stone', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'Pamela', 'Smart', 'are', 'made', 'aware', 'most', 'self-absorbed', 'woman', 'earth', 'offering', 'unwanted', 'beauty', 'advice', 'future', 'sister-in-law', 'leading', 'statement', 'Gorby', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Russia', ""'d"", 'had', 'big', 'purple', 'thing', 'taken', 'off', 'admitting', 'was', 'Jane', 'Pauley', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'struggle', 'weight', 'problem', 'are', 'served', 'up', 'delicious', 'character', 'study', 'conniving', 'deeply', 'superficial', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'international', 'attention', 'Meeting', 'Larry', 'Dillon', 'handsome', 'down-to-earth', 'guy', 'who', 'hard', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Jerry', 'Vale', 'according', 'sister', 'Janice', 'Janice', 'who', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'part', 'ice', 'skating', 'tribute', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'voiceover', 'story', 'Life', 'Suzanne', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'fairytale-ish', 'Larry', 'planned', 'when', 'up', 'subject', 'children', 'off', 'wanted', 'babysitter', 'should', 'have', 'married', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Suzanne', 'marriage', 'mistake', 'opportunity', 'further', 'Dressed', 'kill', 'clawing', 'way', 'top', 'Suzanne', 'lives', 'three', 'disenfranchised', 'teens', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'what', 'aspirations', 'were', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'word', 'meant', 'whom', 'gratuitously', 'practices', 'powers', 'manipulation', 'road', 'chose', 'travel', 'was', 'paved', 'many', 'speedbumps', 'scheme', 'murder', 'husband', 'Besotted', 'glamorous', 'figure', 'teens', 'do', 'one', 'most', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Kidman', 'character', 'record', 'player', 'brought', 'funeral', 'song', 'Myself', 'front', 'assembled', 'crowd', 'course', 'time', 'close-knit', 'group', 'unravels', 'ceaseless', 'pressure', 'authorities', 'begin', 'crack', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'young', 'teen', 'girl', 'heartbreaking', 'hilarious', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'mall', 'monstrous', 'mentor', 'character', 'confused', 'adolescent', 'perfectly', 'Van', 'Sant', 'direction', 'quirky', 'lively', 'more', 'bit', 'sarcastic', 'scenes', 'such', 'masturbation', 'fantasy', 'skating', 'pond', 'body', 'frozen', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Cowboy*', '*Private', 'Idaho*', 'best', 'visually', 'conceptually', 'created', 'complex', 'compelling', 'film', 'forth', 'immensely', 'disturbing', 'issues', 'also', 'be', 'comedy', 'hysterical', 'wicked']",N/A

I don't know if that's because I had seen fewer films, the seamy world it depicts has come even more commonplace (and thus less shocking) or what, but this bold and edgy film now has a somewhat conventional feel.  I still love the ending, the closing shot, beautiful in its poetic justice and its use of visual metaphor (what film is all about, after all), but instead of savaging the TV news industry, this movie just slaps it on the bottom a little.There's also a problem they couldn't foresee in 1995, at least in my eyes, and that is that being on TV has lost some of its allure, thanks to a chronically-shrinking audience and the newer fame of blogs, webcasts, podcasts, and everything else out there.  Once America's royalty, TV personalities are now more like cogs in the big corporate wheel--well-paid and well-tended cogs, but cogs to some extent.  It is possible today for someone to get on the air in a top five market like San Francisco rather quickly--gone are the days of long apprenticeship, of starting out your career in Buttfuque Iowa--or Little Hope, New Hampshire.But that's where Suzanne Stone begins her journey into television.  What I couldn't help but wonder, after about half the movie, was why she didn't try to move on, to a bigger city and a better station.  Doing the weather live for six months, lame as it is, and her documentary tape, would be enough to land her a job at a small or even mid-market station.But maybe I'm being too analytical, and should look at the movie on its own terms.  The satire itself is sharp at times, but after roughly halfway it turns into just another seamy murder movie.  And, perhaps more importantly, I couldn't decide if filmmaker Gus Van Sant wanted us to feel sorrow or contempt for the three wasted teenagers whom Suzanne enlists to help her carry out her deed.  They are maybe painted a bit too broadly, without any sense that the filmmaker or the screenwriter (Buck ""Get Smart"" Henry) have much insight into their dead-end plight.  The way Suzanne turns from understanding friend to cold-hearted mastermind is well-done by Kidman, and the kids, especially Alison Folland, are good actors.  Still, something about the whole thing felt just a little too trite, too simple.Kidman is terrific as the scheming reporter, with limited talent but boundless ambition.  How an Aussie can consistently play better middle-America characters than most American actresses is amazing--or maybe not.  Illeana Douglas is deliciously quirky and believable in her role.  A lot of the dialogue is very sharp, and the quick-cutting, multiple POV technique, which could have become confusing in less sure hands, here clarifies and sharpens the story.  I just wish they'd pushed it even further than they did--at some point it stops feeling like a biting satire and starts feeling like an episode of Law & Order.  To Die For is definitely worth watching, but it's not the searing indictment it could have been.  Transfer to DVD is sharp and crisp.  No extras except for a trailer.",3,"* * * 1/2  Good, but not quite as good as I remember",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,3085,"['When', 'saw', '1995', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'seen', 'fewer', 'films', 'seamy', 'world', 'come', 'even', 'more', 'commonplace', 'thus', 'less', 'shocking', 'what', 'bold', 'edgy', 'film', 'now', 'somewhat', 'conventional', 'feel', 'still', 'love', 'ending', 'closing', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'justice', 'use', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'what', 'film', 'instead', 'savaging', 'TV', 'news', 'industry', 'movie', 'just', 'bottom', 'little.There', 'also', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'foresee', '1995', 'least', 'eyes', 'being', 'TV', 'lost', 'allure', 'thanks', 'chronically-shrinking', 'audience', 'newer', 'fame', 'blogs', 'webcasts', 'podcasts', 'everything', 'else', 'there', 'Once', 'America', 'royalty', 'TV', 'personalities', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'like', 'cogs', 'big', 'corporate', 'wheel', 'well-paid', 'well-tended', 'cogs', 'cogs', 'extent', 'possible', 'today', 'someone', 'get', 'air', 'top', 'five', 'market', 'San', 'Francisco', 'rather', 'quickly', 'gone', 'are', 'days', 'long', 'apprenticeship', 'starting', 'out', 'career', 'Buttfuque', 'Iowa', 'Little', 'Hope', 'New', 'Hampshire.But', 'where', 'Suzanne', 'Stone', 'journey', 'television', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'move', 'bigger', 'city', 'better', 'station', 'Doing', 'weather', 'live', 'six', 'months', 'lame', 'documentary', 'tape', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'land', 'job', 'small', 'even', 'mid-market', 'station.But', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'analytical', 'should', 'look', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'satire', 'sharp', 'times', 'roughly', 'halfway', 'just', 'seamy', 'murder', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'filmmaker', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'wanted', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'contempt', 'three', 'wasted', 'teenagers', 'whom', 'Suzanne', 'help', 'carry', 'deed', 'are', 'maybe', 'painted', 'bit', 'too', 'broadly', 'sense', 'filmmaker', 'screenwriter', 'Buck', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Henry', 'have', 'much', 'insight', 'dead-end', 'plight', 'way', 'Suzanne', 'understanding', 'friend', 'cold-hearted', 'mastermind', 'well-done', 'Kidman', 'kids', 'especially', 'Alison', 'Folland', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'Still', 'something', 'whole', 'thing', 'felt', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'trite', 'too', 'simple.Kidman', 'terrific', 'scheming', 'reporter', 'limited', 'talent', 'boundless', 'ambition', 'How', 'Aussie', 'can', 'consistently', 'play', 'better', 'middle-America', 'characters', 'most', 'American', 'actresses', 'amazing', 'maybe', 'not', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'deliciously', 'quirky', 'believable', 'role', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'very', 'sharp', 'quick-cutting', 'multiple', 'POV', 'technique', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'confusing', 'less', 'sure', 'hands', 'here', 'clarifies', 'story', 'just', 'wish', ""'d"", 'pushed', 'even', 'further', 'did', 'point', 'feeling', 'biting', 'satire', 'feeling', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'Die', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'searing', 'indictment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Transfer', 'DVD', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'extras', 'trailer']",N/A

Nearly all of the characters are painted with a very broad brush, and are made to look absurd and ugly for their stupidity, spitefulness and vanity.  Such harsh characterizations may seem surprising coming from a director like van Sant, whose other films generally display a strong empathy and compassion for the wide range of humanity (see: ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""My Own Private Idaho"", ""Paranoid Park"".)Of course, it all becomes clear as the film progresses that the film is, in fact, a satire on a shallow celebrity- and media-obsessed culture.  That is, such pathetic, shallow characters (and the subsequent bitter aftertaste) serve as a condemnation of a culture of headlines and breaking news and journalistic ""investigations"" in which small, humanizing details and character traits are lost so that the audience make a quick, untroubled about whether the subject is good or bad, malicious or benevolent.  All subtlety is lost, and thus much of what makes us human.I don't know if I'll return to this film (it is just a little too brutal for my tastes), but I'm glad I saw it.",4,A strangely brutal film,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,1184,"['Die', 'mean-spirited', 'little', 'film', 'one', 'left', 'something', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Nearly', 'characters', 'are', 'painted', 'very', 'broad', 'brush', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'absurd', 'ugly', 'stupidity', 'spitefulness', 'vanity', 'Such', 'harsh', 'characterizations', 'may', 'seem', 'surprising', 'coming', 'director', 'van', 'Sant', 'other', 'films', 'generally', 'display', 'strong', 'empathy', 'compassion', 'wide', 'range', 'humanity', 'see', 'Drugstore', 'Cowboy', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'Paranoid', 'Park', 'course', 'clear', 'film', 'film', 'fact', 'satire', 'shallow', 'celebrity-', 'media-obsessed', 'culture', 'such', 'pathetic', 'shallow', 'characters', 'subsequent', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'serve', 'condemnation', 'culture', 'headlines', 'breaking', 'news', 'journalistic', 'investigations', 'small', 'humanizing', 'details', 'character', 'traits', 'are', 'lost', 'so', 'audience', 'make', 'quick', 'untroubled', 'subject', 'good', 'bad', 'malicious', 'benevolent', 'subtlety', 'lost', 'thus', 'much', 'what', 'human.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'return', 'film', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'brutal', 'tastes', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw']",N/A

I always thought so. I had goals and aspirations too you know.Yes, those nights when my buddy and I would wait outside of Helens bar for the 1:00am closing call to ask older women if they could read us some bedtime stories. There were mixed results.Needless to say, some lucky kids get all the fun, it seems. Most recently I've read one about the thirty year old teacher from Florida who had sex with some lucky young kid in the back of a stolen car. WOW! Talk about kicks! She's in a sh*t load of hot water now, and she doesn't even CARE! She plans on writing a book about it! Sweet lord knows I'm waiting for that bit. They say the kid is traumatized. Traumatized? I don't know man, I seen that chick, she was hot to trot let me tell ya. His friends are probably traumatized with jealousy. I know I am.Anyway, this ain't nothing new. I'm sure this stuff happens all the time. There are some freaky chicks out there, man. Remember that other chick that got tossed in jail because of what she did with a teenage boy. Only to get let out after five years to do it again! Get tossed back in, and then come out to marry that kid. Its a modern day fairy tale! What a beautiful story.Then you have this story. TO DIE FOR, the 1995 movie starring Nicole Kidman and Jou&%%&%& Phoenix. This one takes the cake for a sick twisted chick. Though she has a drop dead smile, and a body that would leave you stripped to bones. Her seduction was beyond kicks. This chick was pure evil. She really did mess up that kid. This WAS a true story that happened some time ago in a small New Hampshire town, where a very sexy older woman seduced this kid to the point of killing her husband. Oh man. That's not part of the fantasy.Oh well, its a great movie. Any teenager who likes to wait for much older women to read them bedtime stories would be wise to check this movie out as some food for thought. I always kept Nicole Kidmans To die For character in the back of mind. You never know when an evil woman can strike a manipulative blow.
