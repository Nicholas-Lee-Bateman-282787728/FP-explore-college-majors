I'm glad to see this finally out on DVD - and with subtitles for the hearing impaired.The storyline might seem a little corny - blackmailing a known cat burglar to steal diamonds from a foreign embassy to disrupt Nazi operations in South America.  But when you consider that during World War II British Intelligence actually dressed a dead body as a British officer and floated it onshore in Spain with phony letters suggesting the Allied invasion of southern Europe would be through Greece (instead of Sicily), and it worked . . . well, who knows.  (It was known as operation Mincemeat.)What I liked about this movie was the set designs.  They were so 1930s!  Set designers don't get the credit they should.  I particularly like the scenes at the nightclubs and on the train.  And they had the cars right, also.  Good set designs add a lot to any movie.The chemistry between Tom Selleck and Jane Seymour was good.  And Bob Hoskins was great as the 'copper'.  If there was a disappointment in the acting, it was Joe Regalbuto as the FBI agent.  He came across as a wimp, and FBI agents just are not timid.  But I would be remiss if I did not give credit to Lauren Hutton, who played a Nazi courier with a wild side.So when you put the acting and set designs together with the plot, you come up with a movie that's pretty entertaining.
