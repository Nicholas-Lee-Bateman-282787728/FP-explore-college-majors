35782,AIMR915K4YCN,0780627784,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[2, 2]","How can you beat this collection? All three POISON IVY movies together for one low price! The original POISON IVY stars Drew Barrymore in the title role, as a sociopathic loner who latches on to a wealthy family in order to manipulate, control, and ultimately destroy them. She befriends the lonely daughter, Sylvie (Sarah Gilbert) and quickly moves right in. Tom Skerritt (Alien, The Dead Zone) is the hopelessly Ivy-obsessed dad. Cheryl Ladd is the weak, sickly mum. Drew Barrymore plays her part w/ deadly accuracy. She combines innocence and seduction into a sticky web of deception and murder. Great stuff! In POISON IVY 2: LILY, Alyssa Milano is an insecure art student until she stumbles across Ivy's diary. She uses the diary as her bible, transforming into a super-slut out to seduce all men in her path. This one plays more like a drama, w/ far less tension than the other two IVY entries. Not much in the way of action (aside from the obvious, naked variety) happens until the semi-lame conclusion. If it weren't for the rampant nudity, this could have been another sappy made-for-tv movie. So-so. This brings us to POISON IVY: THE NEW SEDUCTION. I had expected this to be the worst of the three. I was happy to be wrong! Jaime Pressly is the perfect home-wrecker / killer as she merrily goes about ruining as well as taking lives. Violet's (Ms. Pressly) natural heat burns up everything she touches, leaving nothing but cinders in her wake! This gal is H-O-T! Crikey! The plot is somewhat similar to the first movie, with Violet moving in w/ an old friend and taking over her family through lies, sensuality, and multiple homicide. This one has a higher body count, with Violet being even more cunning and cold than the original Ivy in her ability to use people to get what she desires. Well, there you have it.

And if you liked the original, you will be severely disappointed by this sequel.After having watched the original Poison Ivy, I looked forward to this one. Unfortunately, this is one of those sequels that had a lot going for it until the creators ruin it.What the movie is *supposed* to be about is a ""good girl"" (Milano) just starting college in a new place and doesn't know anyone, so she tries to fit in by making changes to herself and her personality. She finds old diaries of the original ""Ivy"" and learns Ivy's art of seduction from them and slowly, but surely becomes her own version of what Ivy was.Ok, that sounds to me like the premise for a great sequel...but the creators of the movie ruined it by:1. Not enough emphasis on our ""new Ivy""'s mental change and growing obsession with her new ways.2. Because of what I mentioned above in #1, our new Ivy (Milano) isn't very creepy at all. The change from her good girl image to that of Ivy is shallow, at best. There is no obsession, no reminder of the drive behind her character.3. Because of #2, our new Ivy is not in control of the story. Her pervert teacher is. In fact, she is even treated as a victim in the end. What?! Where's the seduction? Where's the loss of control?4. Given what the movie is supposed to be about, the ending definitely leaves a lot to be desired. So she realizes the ""error of her ways"" (and since there was never really any emphasis on exactly what her ""error"" was, that statement is a misnomer) and hooks up with her boyfriend. Big deal.

New to the school she now attends, she befriends a nerdy girl, Sylvie, who comes from a wealthy family:  Her father is a prominent but controversial TV anchor, and her mother, formerly a socialite who is stricken with emphysema at middle age, and getting worse.  Sylvie and ""Ivy"" (a name Sylvie abruptly chooses based on a tattoo she sees on her) become fast friends, and she soon starts living with Sylvie's family, becoming a 'play' sister.  But Ivy has more in mind than just hanging out with her new buddy.  The sexually precocious Ivy wants to seduce Sylvie's father and take her mom out of the picture.  From there, a series of shocking events take place, as the mystery of Ivy starts to creep up on Sylvie.POISON IVY 2Alyssa Milano is Lily, a struggling artist who somehow stumbles upon the diaries of Ivy-- and then begins applying Ivy's ""life lessons"" to her own heretofore humdrum existence, with surprising-- and highly sexualized-- results..POISON IVY 3Apparently, ""Ivy"" was the real name of the girl in part 1-- here we see her, with younger sister Violet, as the playmates of Joy Greer.  Ivy and Violet's mom is the housekeeper for the Greer family.  She is also apparently the secret lover of Mr. Greer.  The girls' mom also has a lover on the side-- who decides to have a 'nooner' at the Greer's residence-- but Mr. Greer comes home early, and everyone's deceit is laid out in the open.. naturally, Mrs. Greer kicks out Ivy & Violet's mom,  and she and the kids are never seen again-- until maybe 12 years later, when a gorgeous, college-aged Violet shows up alone at the Greer household.  She claims to have come back to town after having moved away, waitressing at a restaurant while attending junior college.  The dominatrix gear kept in a black bag is a giveaway that she isn't all she appears to be.  Joy is ecstatic to see her old childhood friend.  Before long, Violet begins to insinuate herself into the lives of the surviving Greers (Joy's mom is deceased), while manipulating everyone in her path.  Now a widower, Mr. Greer is vaguely apprehensive about Violet staying at the house, but he can't keep his eyes off her.  The same goes for Joy's boyfriend.

Munson,"[2, 3]","Alyssa Milano stars in this sexy sequel to the first ""Poison Ivy"" movie.Milano stars as Lily, a somewhat innocent girl from Kalamazoo, Michigan, who has moved to Los Angeles to attend art school.  She arrives on campus two weeks after the beginning of the semester.  One of her classes is taught by Professor Donald Falk (Xander Berkeley).  Prof. Falk has a weakness for young female undergraduates, as evidenced by the opening scene of the film.  Also taking Prof. Falk's class is Gredin (Jonathon Schaech), an aspiring sculptor and, along with several other ""different"" people, a roommate of Lily's.Once she's settled in her room in the boarding house, Lily discovers a box containing a diary and nude photos.  The items belong to Ivy (presumably from the first movie).  Intrigued, Lily begins going through the items, especially the diary.  Lily is intrigued by all of the sexy entries Ivy made in the diary.  Lily decides to experiment a little, so she cuts her hair and develops a more sexy look.Her new looks haven't went unnoticed, as both Gredin and Donald have taken an interest in Lily.  Donald, who hasn't painted in several years, finally finds the urge to paint again, and Lily becomes his subject, sitting for numerous sessions with Donald, and she's barely clothed in any of them.  Meanwhile, Gredin has taken his own interest, and he and Lily begin to have a torrid sexual relationship.However, things begin spinning out of control.  Donald's obsession with Lily becomes almost uncontrollable.  And at Thanksgiving dinner, things go from bad to worse as Donald's young daughter finds him attempting to rape Lily.  The young child bolts from the house and directly into the path of an oncoming car.  Donald's wife and Gredin attend to the child, while Lily runs home.  Unfortunately, things don't end here.  Donald follows Lily to her house, breaks in, and resumes his pursuit of Lily.  Terrified, she tries desperately to fight back.  Will she succeed in stopping Donald, or will Donald prove too much for her?Usually, sequels fail to live up to the standards set by the original film, but this movie does a pretty good job.  Alyssa Milano is not Drew Barrymore, but she's sexy and beautiful in her own right.  Barrymore did no nude scenes in the first movie, but Alyssa does several in this film.

This is a story about a girl name Lily who never fit in, and she wants to be somebody else & belong. So with Ivy's words and influence from her diary, Lily becomes someone else entirely. The movie shows her blossom from the innocent outsider she was to the sexy, manipulative person she became. You can see her change perfectly on the screen. In the end, Lily's new behavior leads to obsession and maybe even death. The point is, I know alot of teens can relate to not fitting in & trying to change who you are. So what if this movie has sex, it's part of everyday life, and there's no reason it shouldn't be in a movie. It's not that big of a deal. Hey, watch the rated version if you want! This movie wasn't meant to be a serious movie, so if you are looking for a movie with a good plot that's like the movie Fear, rent this or buy it. You will be surprised. If all you do is sit down and watch movies studying every detail and scene, trying to find something wrong with it, this movie is not for you.

She picks up a boyfriend on one hand and is pursued by her art teacher on the other.I have nothing against soft-core movies and every now and then I see one that is actually not bad. Unfortunately, Poison Ivy II is not one of those movies.

If there was some genuine heat on the screen when the movie tries to be sexy, you might forgive this. Alas, the sex is just as ponderous and devoid of appeal as the rest of Poison Ivy II. Alyssa Milano looks like she wants to be somewhere else every time she reveals even a little bit of skin and there is never a sense of true passion when she's with either her boyfriend or her art teacher.All in all, this movie is a stinker.

It's setting up for anyone who hasn't seen the first movie, not that it's repeating the first, but it is incredibly boring.

She ends up babysitting for her art teacher's daughter (Camilla Belle from Practical Magic) and one thing leads to another. You know the rest.There's a happy ending tacked onto the end of this, after a pretty shocking incident (which I did not see coming) but it seems worthless after you've sat through the first half of the movie.

This time, an innocent young woman (Milano, of course) finds herself led down the road to unsavory temptations, none of which involve the study of, say, systematic theology.  What any of this has to do with the original Ivy is anybody's guess.

35813,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0780627784,S. Schell,"[6, 8]","This little ditty from director Anne Goursaud is simply a nudie pic designed to break Alyssa Milano free of the wholesome image that her long-running TV series ""Who's The Boss"" ensnared her in.  Neophyte screenwriter Chloe King has composed a tale that is simply a divulgence in every typical adolescent girl's fantasy: nullifying their uneventful, introverted existences and transfiguring into the most enviable nymphette their college/high school campus has ever seen.  Milano portrays a beautiful college freshman named Lily Lionetti, an art student who has just made the long bus ride from Michigan to California to attend a top-notch art school.  Her living arrangement is co-ed, her roommates consisting of a computer engineering major named Tanya, a forever-rehearsing and reticent cellist named Robert, a ditzy dancer named Bridgette, and a roguish and rebellious sculptor named Gredin.  As she is unpacking, she discovers a box in her closet containing nude artistic photos, various articles of clothing and a diary, property of the ruthless homewrecker from the first PI installment (Drew Barrymore).  Lily reads the diary voraciously and is seduced by Ivy's wily ways and free spirit, so much that she is inspired to make a physical transformation that will disturb even herself, let alone her heedless housemates.The opening scene to the movie is a barefaced indicator to what the plot comprises.  Donald Falk (Berkeley), an art instructor at the university, is copulating with one of his many female undergrads.  He decides after they start getting dressed that he's just not interested anymore and that he wants to be alone.  The brokenhearted girl does not show up the next morning for class and who should take her empty seat but the timorous and incredibly fetching Lily.  Gee, I wonder whom Donald will pursue next?  Who also has an eye on her is her housemate Gredin, played by a bleach-blonde Johnathan Schaech (Hush, How To Make An American Quilt).  Soon after Lily's inevitable transformation (cutting her hair, dressing in Ivy's clothes), she and Gredin begin seeing each other and things become serious.  At the same time, she is having a dangerous affair with Donald, much to the humiliation of his wife Angela, who has suffered his infidelity for years.  Donald's affections for Lily soon turn into full-blown obsession and this equals cheesy drama, thus ending much like the first PI did.Milano does a mediocre job, stating in a recent interview for E!'s Celebrity Profile that she simply did the film just to keep working.  This was one of the few projects she found possible to get an audition for since her stint on WTB had limited her chances of being taken seriously.  This was before she became Aaron Spelling's new golden child and made her triumphant return to prime-time as the sexy and devious sister of Michael Mancini on ""Melrose Place"", followed by her regular stint on the WB series ""Charmed"".  Johnathan Schaech does his best with a limited role, but of course it's not his acting we're supposed to care about - only those washboard abs.  Xander Berkeley wins the crown for king of melodrama portraying Donald, a love-crazed, mentally-disturbed individual.  Berkeley is, of course, A LOT more talented than this b-vehicle divulges and that's the saddest part.  What pleasantly surprised me is that he provided all the original artwork for the film.The majority of the audience for this film is heterosexual males between the ages of 16 and 35.  Even middle-agers croon over Alyssa's obvious endowments and enjoy the moments where they may pause the film to fully capture her voluptuous silhouette.  I, for one, could care less because I am not of the majority and I appreciate good acting much more than a good body (although seeing Johnathan Schaech's butt wasn't too shabby, lemme tell ya!).  Overall, this movie is nothing but a skin flick that makes the bulk of its revenue from Milano's bold career move - the corruption of her chaste facade.",2,Milano Exposed,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,3989,"['little', 'ditty', 'director', 'Anne', 'Goursaud', 'simply', 'nudie', 'pic', 'designed', 'break', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'free', 'wholesome', 'image', 'long-running', 'TV', 'series', 'Who', 'Boss', 'ensnared', 'Neophyte', 'screenwriter', 'Chloe', 'King', 'composed', 'tale', 'simply', 'divulgence', 'typical', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'fantasy', 'nullifying', 'uneventful', 'introverted', 'existences', 'transfiguring', 'most', 'enviable', 'nymphette', 'college/high', 'school', 'campus', 'ever', 'seen', 'Milano', 'beautiful', 'college', 'freshman', 'named', 'Lily', 'Lionetti', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'just', 'made', 'long', 'bus', 'ride', 'Michigan', 'California', 'attend', 'top-notch', 'art', 'school', 'living', 'arrangement', 'co-ed', 'roommates', 'consisting', 'computer', 'engineering', 'major', 'named', 'Tanya', 'forever-rehearsing', 'reticent', 'cellist', 'named', 'Robert', 'ditzy', 'dancer', 'named', 'Bridgette', 'roguish', 'rebellious', 'sculptor', 'named', 'Gredin', 'unpacking', 'box', 'closet', 'containing', 'nude', 'artistic', 'photos', 'various', 'articles', 'clothing', 'diary', 'property', 'ruthless', 'homewrecker', 'first', 'PI', 'installment', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Lily', 'diary', 'voraciously', 'seduced', 'Ivy', 'wily', 'ways', 'free', 'spirit', 'so', 'much', 'inspired', 'make', 'physical', 'transformation', 'will', 'disturb', 'even', 'let', 'alone', 'heedless', 'housemates.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'barefaced', 'indicator', 'what', 'plot', 'Donald', 'Falk', 'Berkeley', 'art', 'instructor', 'university', 'copulating', 'one', 'many', 'female', 'undergrads', 'start', 'getting', 'dressed', 'just', 'not', 'interested', 'anymore', 'be', 'alone', 'brokenhearted', 'girl', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'class', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'empty', 'seat', 'timorous', 'incredibly', 'fetching', 'Lily', 'Gee', 'wonder', 'whom', 'Donald', 'will', 'pursue', 'next', 'Who', 'also', 'eye', 'housemate', 'Gredin', 'played', 'bleach-blonde', 'Johnathan', 'Schaech', 'Hush', 'How', 'Make', 'American', 'Quilt', 'Soon', 'Lily', 'inevitable', 'transformation', 'cutting', 'hair', 'dressing', 'Ivy', 'clothes', 'Gredin', 'begin', 'seeing', 'other', 'things', 'become', 'serious', 'same', 'time', 'having', 'dangerous', 'affair', 'Donald', 'much', 'humiliation', 'wife', 'Angela', 'who', 'suffered', 'infidelity', 'years', 'Donald', 'affections', 'Lily', 'soon', 'turn', 'full-blown', 'obsession', 'equals', 'cheesy', 'drama', 'thus', 'ending', 'much', 'first', 'PI', 'did.Milano', 'mediocre', 'job', 'stating', 'recent', 'interview', 'E', 'Celebrity', 'Profile', 'simply', 'did', 'film', 'just', 'keep', 'working', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'projects', 'found', 'possible', 'get', 'audition', 'stint', 'WTB', 'had', 'limited', 'chances', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'was', 'became', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'new', 'golden', 'child', 'made', 'triumphant', 'return', 'prime-time', 'sexy', 'devious', 'sister', 'Michael', 'Mancini', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'followed', 'regular', 'stint', 'WB', 'series', 'Charmed', 'Johnathan', 'Schaech', 'best', 'limited', 'role', 'course', 'not', 'acting', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'care', 'only', 'washboard', 'abs', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'crown', 'king', 'melodrama', 'portraying', 'Donald', 'love-crazed', 'mentally-disturbed', 'individual', 'Berkeley', 'course', 'LOT', 'more', 'talented', 'b-vehicle', 'divulges', 'saddest', 'part', 'What', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'provided', 'original', 'artwork', 'film.The', 'majority', 'audience', 'film', 'heterosexual', 'males', 'ages', '16', '35', 'Even', 'middle-agers', 'croon', 'Alyssa', 'obvious', 'endowments', 'enjoy', 'moments', 'where', 'may', 'pause', 'film', 'fully', 'capture', 'voluptuous', 'silhouette', 'one', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'am', 'not', 'majority', 'appreciate', 'good', 'acting', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'body', 'seeing', 'Johnathan', 'Schaech', 'butt', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'lem', 'tell', 'ya', 'Overall', 'movie', 'nothing', 'skin', 'flick', 'bulk', 'revenue', 'Milano', 'bold', 'career', 'move', 'corruption', 'chaste', 'facade']",N/A
35814,A20ELE6G4N447V,0780627784,Steve Vander,"[3, 4]","R rated and Unrated versions of the 1995 movie (nudity and language).  Thriller (""dark/adult""). (barely 3 stars, closer to 2 1/2 stars)The DVD reviewed contains just the movie and some cast & crew information.  There are four different versions of the movie: two widescreen (R and unrated) and two full screen (R and unrated).  Testing will allow you to find the best version of the film (both formats cut off the edges, the top, or the bottom).  This review is of the unrated widescreen version.Credits: The movie stars Alyssa Milano (Lily; TV: ""Who's the Boss"", ""Charmed""), Xander Berkeley (Professor Donald Falk; TV: ""24""), and Jonathon  Schaech (Gredin - a roommate; TV ""Partners"").  The director is Anne Goursaud (""Embrace of the Vampire"").  The movie is written by Chloe King.Plot: The movie is the about a young inexperienced woman, Lily, who moves to Los Angles to attend an art school.  While there she finds a box left behind by Ivy.  Among other things, the box contains a diary and some self-portraits of Ivy (Drew Barrymore, apparently the box has been sitting around undisturbed for three years) the subject of the previous movie.  The movie boils down to this: ""pure"" young woman's life is changed by ""rule-breaking""/taboo-breaking helped along by an explicit diary, an art teacher and a male art student.Review: I appear to be watching this series backwards as the only other movie I have seen in the series is the third (the 2nd and 3rd movies are direct to video sequels).  The third movie in the series, which I watched first and stars Jamie Pressly, is a better movie than the second movie in the series.The movie opens on Donald Falk's art classroom with Falk and a woman having some fun (immediate nudity).  Falk stops in the middle and breaks up with the woman (I believe he got what he wanted, though).  And now we meet the just arriving Lily looking like she is wearing many layers of clothing  in the style of a hobo, and wearing army boots.  Despite the hobo appearance, she appears to have similarities between her and the just rejected woman (a pattern - looking for a younger version of his wife?).  Lily arrives thirty minutes late to an art class two weeks after school started carrying all her luggage.  The professor isn't particularly put out, and directs the attention of the class to the posed pale red-haired nude woman.  After class, Lily heads off to her coed group house where she meets Gredin: I don't know why, but when I first see Gredin, he looks like he is a little fake, looking like he is trying to look like a rough Val Kilmer-type person - we later learn that he is a ""rebel"" and not constrained by ""traditional"" art traditions.  Later, after a bad experience in art class due to comments by Gredin, Lily reads Ivy's diary and butchers the self-portraits, while this occurs ""Ivy"" (who I strongly doubt is Drew Barrymore) dances around nude representing the pictures (black & white filming would have worked better here, considering the pictures themselves are black & white).  Apparently, one reading of the diary and one deep glance through the photos causes Lily to start down the slippery slope  (the change to the ""bad"" girl side is just too quick, and the slope leads to nudity for Lily).The movie is quite unrealistic.  Lily arrives two weeks late to her classes at her new art school, and the teacher doesn't seem to mind that much (perfect opportunity for the lecherous teacher to ""privately tutor"" the woman, but he doesn't suggest it, instead he hires her as a baby-sitter; and as a model).  Having the class immediately start drawing a posed nude woman after apparently two weeks of background, is not particularly realistic.  Also, Lily seems to have just one teacher and one class (part of the struggle of college is having to take so many classes at once).  Based on an early phone conversation between Lily and her parents, this is not a graduate art school, so why are the art students drawing nude portraits so soon?David Falk and Milano seem to have some acting ability, most of the time, while the rest of the actors seem to have some trouble acting, that or they are very good actors - acting as if they are disturbed artists (none of the characters are likable).  Personally, I like the music.  The clothing is reflective of the time, I suppose, but quite horrible (early: army boots, drab clothing; later: clothing you might see on an episode of ""Charmed"").  The plot and dialogue hinder the movie (though Berkley and Milano seem to put some energy into trying to make it work).  Overall, I would give the movie 2.63 stars (due for the irritating nature of the plot and dialogue ""your beauty scares me"").

Then I saw the 2nd one and watched it.Well to tell you the truth,it was not what I expected,it was dull and predictable...Alyssa Milano was ok,it really did'nt have much of a storyline/plot,except the same B movie that a young attractive girl moves her way into a family that she wants,similar to Poison Ivy.But not vey good,I actually fell asleep in the middle of this film,shows it dosent catch my attention...If you are looking for a movie with a lot of sex,and Alyssa taking her clothes off then this is the movie for you.But if you want a movie that will catch your attention,dont rent this one.Its just plain sex B-movie,I think they thought after making Poison Ivy with Drew Barrymore,and it was a good movie(my opinion),they thought why not make another,probably thinking it would go off good like the first,well it didnt. As they say sequel's are not as good as the 1st,on this movie,I agree...All it was, was Alyssa taking her clothes off,seducing,and just plain dumb...Anyone can take their clothes off,but you had better have a plot to be considered a good movie...I say,stick with Drew Barrymore's performance in the first Poison Ivy,at least it was exciting and never dull or dumb...And that movie did have a plot,if you really watch,Drew's character,wanted what she never had,a family,and she snuck into the family,and began to start little problems,she wanted to be in the family,the only way was to get rid of the wife who was dying of emphysema,(Cheryl Ladd),and then her trusted new friend,(Sara Gilbert),and then after they were gone,start her seductive moves on the father,(Tom Skerrit),and then she would be in...But that took a different turn,at least it had a good plot and good star's that could really act,so if you want to watch Poison Ivy,I would not recommend Poison Ivy 2,it was not THAT good,hope this helped...",2,"""A Disapointment""",1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,1885,"['Drew', 'first', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'loved', 'Then', 'saw', '2nd', 'one', 'watched', 'it.Well', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'dull', 'predictable', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'was', 'ok', 'really', 'have', 'much', 'storyline/plot', 'same', 'B', 'movie', 'young', 'attractive', 'girl', 'way', 'family', 'similar', 'Poison', 'Ivy.But', 'not', 'vey', 'good', 'actually', 'fell', 'asleep', 'middle', 'film', 'dosent', 'catch', 'attention', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'lot', 'sex', 'Alyssa', 'taking', 'clothes', 'off', 'then', 'movie', 'you.But', 'want', 'movie', 'will', 'catch', 'attention', 'dont', 'rent', 'one.Its', 'just', 'plain', 'sex', 'B-movie', 'think', 'thought', 'making', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'opinion', 'thought', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'probably', 'thinking', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'good', 'first', 'well', 'say', 'sequel', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', '1st', 'movie', 'agree', 'was', 'was', 'Alyssa', 'taking', 'clothes', 'off', 'seducing', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'Anyone', 'can', 'take', 'clothes', 'had', 'better', 'have', 'plot', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'movie', 'say', 'stick', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'performance', 'first', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'least', 'was', 'exciting', 'never', 'dull', 'dumb', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'plot', 'really', 'watch', 'Drew', 'character', 'wanted', 'what', 'never', 'had', 'family', 'snuck', 'family', 'began', 'start', 'little', 'problems', 'wanted', 'be', 'family', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'get', 'rid', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'dying', 'emphysema', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'then', 'trusted', 'new', 'friend', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'then', 'were', 'gone', 'start', 'seductive', 'moves', 'father', 'Tom', 'Skerrit', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'took', 'different', 'turn', 'least', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'good', 'star', 'could', 'really', 'act', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'Poison', 'Ivy', '2', 'was', 'not', 'THAT', 'good', 'hope', 'helped']",N/A
