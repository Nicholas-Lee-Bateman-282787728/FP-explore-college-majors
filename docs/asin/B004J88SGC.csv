It was also a concert venue, for some of the biggest & greatest rock bands in the world, including the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Others. After this concert, the historic stadium was demolished. The entergy level and enthusiasm of the crowd, Billy Joel & his Band, & the Special Guest Artists, is simply ""AWESOME"".

1411416,A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B004J88SGC,"Michael Kerner ""Michael Kerner""","[0, 1]","There is no question that when it has came down to great music, many of today's artists like Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Beyonce' have been known to lip sync into their performances, where they've personally stopped delivering anything that has felt organic or special. Sometimes it is lackluster music that makes me constantly go back to artists who've only been known for talent, not flash and flare. That has been the case with Billy Joel. While it has been almost 20 years since he delivered his last album, River Of Dreams, his music has always remained timeless just like it was yesterday. But when it has came down to performing live, the Piano Man still has shown to knock it right out of the park. That was the case when he was the first singer to do a concert at Yankee Stadium in 1990, and again as he performed the final concert at Shea Stadium. For his hard core fans, and die hard fans of his music, that concert is here for all to enjoy.Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium showcases the 2 concerts that Billy Joel had sung his heart out and tickled those ivories like there was no tomorrow on DVD. The concert is well-received and honestly one of the best live concert packages you've seen of Billy Joel. The 2 night event showcases some of Billy's biggest songs, sung to a whole new generation of fans. Billy performs some of his classics like My Life, his standard Piano Man, also rocking out to a guitar on We Didn't Start The Fire in one of the rare times we've seen Billy strum a guitar in concert, and Scenes From An Italian Restaurant to just name a few. There are also some great collaborations here as well including Shameless with Garth Brooks and New York State Of Mind with legendary crooner Tony Bennett. The live event is fun to enjoy, but some of the songs he performed with others could've brought in some more life alone. Not only that, but one of Billy's biggest tributes also came into playing piano into other songs of his own, like leading classic songs like Take Me Out To The Ball Game and Yankee Doodle Dandy into some of his hits like My Life & Piano Man. While it is clever going toward his own music, it just adds into Billy's classic standard of why he still can play to a wonderful audience, despite not making a album in years.All in all, I enjoyed watching Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium, and it is a great delight for any die hard Billy Joel fan, or for anyone who is also new to Billy's music with his over 40 year career of playing great music. There are a lot of memories Billy had made for all audiences and generations young and old with his music, and this is a wonderful moment from a man who not only became the first singer to perform live at Yankee Stadium and the grand finale of Shea Stadium hands down. I absolutely recommend this DVD a lot. Keep singing Billy, because you're keeping on doing New York proud.DVD Cover: BMastering: B+Extras: BPrice: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+",4,Shea & Billy,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2925,"['question', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'great', 'music', 'many', 'today', 'artists', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'Rihanna', 'Beyonce', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'lip', 'sync', 'performances', 'where', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'stopped', 'delivering', 'anything', 'felt', 'organic', 'special', 'Sometimes', 'lackluster', 'music', 'constantly', 'go', 'back', 'artists', 'who', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'known', 'talent', 'not', 'flash', 'flare', 'been', 'case', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'been', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'delivered', 'last', 'album', 'River', 'Dreams', 'music', 'always', 'remained', 'timeless', 'just', 'was', 'yesterday', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'performing', 'live', 'Piano', 'Man', 'still', 'shown', 'knock', 'right', 'park', 'was', 'case', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'singer', 'do', 'concert', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', '1990', 'again', 'performed', 'final', 'concert', 'Shea', 'Stadium', 'hard', 'core', 'fans', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'music', 'concert', 'here', 'enjoy.Billy', 'Joel', 'Live', 'Shea', 'Stadium', '2', 'concerts', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'had', 'sung', 'heart', 'tickled', 'ivories', 'was', 'tomorrow', 'DVD', 'concert', 'well-received', 'honestly', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'concert', 'packages', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Billy', 'Joel', '2', 'night', 'event', 'Billy', 'biggest', 'songs', 'sung', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'Billy', 'classics', 'My', 'Life', 'standard', 'Piano', 'Man', 'also', 'rocking', 'out', 'guitar', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Start', 'Fire', 'one', 'rare', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Billy', 'guitar', 'concert', 'Scenes', 'From', 'Italian', 'Restaurant', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'collaborations', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Shameless', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Mind', 'legendary', 'crooner', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'live', 'event', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'performed', 'others', 'could', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'more', 'life', 'alone', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'Billy', 'biggest', 'tributes', 'also', 'came', 'playing', 'piano', 'other', 'songs', 'own', 'leading', 'classic', 'songs', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ball', 'Game', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'hits', 'My', 'Life', 'Piano', 'Man', 'clever', 'going', 'own', 'music', 'just', 'Billy', 'classic', 'standard', 'why', 'still', 'can', 'play', 'wonderful', 'audience', 'not', 'making', 'album', 'years.All', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'Live', 'Shea', 'Stadium', 'great', 'delight', 'die', 'hard', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'also', 'new', 'Billy', 'music', '40', 'year', 'career', 'playing', 'great', 'music', 'are', 'lot', 'memories', 'Billy', 'had', 'made', 'audiences', 'generations', 'young', 'old', 'music', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'became', 'first', 'singer', 'perform', 'live', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'grand', 'finale', 'Shea', 'Stadium', 'down', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'lot', 'Keep', 'singing', 'Billy', ""'re"", 'keeping', 'doing', 'New', 'York', 'proud.DVD', 'Cover', 'BMastering', 'B+Extras', 'BPrice', '1/2+Overall', 'B', '1/2+']",N/A
