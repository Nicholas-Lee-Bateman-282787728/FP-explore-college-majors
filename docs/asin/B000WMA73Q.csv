How can this happen Warner Bros?  In thisepisode the character of John-Boy (Richard Thomas) returns home for a visit from New York. I own this episode on video tape, recorded several years ago from WGN. There are some coal mine scenes which are edited, including a scene of a small cave in before the big one hits. There is a scene in which the daughter Erin gives her father John some money to help the family out, and this is cut from the DVD. There is a scene in which the character of Harley refuses to discuss his fears of a possible cave-in with his wife Verdie which is not on this DVD. A scene in which John-Boy conducts an interview with a businessman is shortened too. Again, I think about six minutes total is missing.I noticed a few edits in the season five set too. I must say when I ampaying for a complete season and see so many cuts or edits it is prettydisappointing. Were the original master tapes not available? I would verymuch like to know what happed as this cut up episode, ""The Return"", is one of my favorites. I thought that quality control at Warner Bros. would do a better job. From what I could tell ""Grandma Comes Home"" seemed complete, but what happened with ""The Return""? This is why I rate this as four stars instead of five.

1110524,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000WMA73Q,"kone ""kone""","[6, 6]","Back in the seventies when I watched the Waltons on TV (CBS, Thursday nights at 7 PM), I thought that when John-Boy left the show, the series would ""die"", or at least diminish, as the series is told from John-Boy's point of view.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Season 6 is chock-full of dramatic episodes that are every bit as good as the five seasons that preceeded it.Jason is now the oldest brother in the Walton family, and he accounts himself well in the many episodes in which he plays a major role.  ""The Recluse"" is an excellent episode where Jason draws out a reclusive woman from her self-imposed isolation.  ""The Warrior"" follows this episode and is another great hour of entertainment.  The Walton family is challenged by two Native American Indians who claim the Walton barn lies over sacred Indial burial grounds.  The Indians try to burn down the barn.  The Waltons resolve their dispute in an honorable fashion.  ""The Volunteer"" is actually the first part of a two-part episode involving the relationship between G.W. and Erin.  Erin rejects G.W.'s proposal of marriage, and joins the army.  In a later episode, G.W. dies in a training accident and Erin has to deal with her guilt over rejecting G.W.  Erin and GW both show they can act in these two episodes.  I always thought the acting of G.W. was sort of ""wooden"", but he pulls off these two episodes with a maturity not seen in previous seasons.Mary Ellen and Curt give the Waltons their first grandchild, a son in a two-part episode in mid-season.  ""The Milestone"" gives Momma Walton a chance to show how very well she can act.  She goes through her change of life in this episode.  It is tastefully done as usual.  ""The Anniversary"" shows the 25th wedding anniversary of John and Olivia Walton; it is a very special edition and shows the deep love they have for each other.  Meanwhile, cracks appear in the marriage of Mary Ellen and Curt, as Curt is apart in the Army.The season ends with a terrific combination of episodes.  The first is ""The Ordeal"", another two-parter where Elizabeth is injured and Jim-Bob and Ben have to deal with their own guilt over her accident.  This one is a real tear-jerker, especially at the end where Elizabeth takes her first halting steps after her accident.  John-Boy returns in yet another two-part episode involving a disaster at a reopenned coal mine.  The next to the last episode is another classic John-Boy episode, where he proposes marriage to his long-term girlfriend Daisy, but is in for a sudden revelation about her past.  Finally, the season ends with the return of Grandma Esther Walton.  (Actress Ellen Corby had suffered a stroke in real life, and had been away from the show since early in Season Five).  This is another tear-jerker, and shows the courage of Ellen Corby in returning to the series, as she never fully recovered her voice as a result of the stroke.  I have to applaud the producers of the Waltons for bringing back Grandma Walton despite her obvious disability.  Many shows would have written her off, but not the Waltons.  They deal with real-life drama and situations, and their love for each other and committment to family is what makes this show so endearing to all who love the series. I am sure every family today watching the Waltons wishes that their own family could have the love for each other that binds the Waltons together.If you don't have this season, purchase it.  It is well worth the investment.  The entire family can enjoy the episodes.  There is nothing like The Waltons on tv today, much to our great loss.Jim ""Konedog"" Koening",5,The Waltons Sixth Season is More Family-Centered Drama,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,3587,"['Back', 'seventies', 'when', 'watched', 'Waltons', 'TV', 'CBS', 'Thursday', 'nights', '7', 'PM', 'thought', 'when', 'John-Boy', 'left', 'show', 'series', 'would', 'die', 'least', 'diminish', 'series', 'told', 'John-Boy', 'point', 'view', 'Boy', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'Season', '6', 'chock-full', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'five', 'seasons', 'preceeded', 'it.Jason', 'now', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Walton', 'family', 'well', 'many', 'episodes', 'major', 'role', 'Recluse', 'excellent', 'episode', 'where', 'Jason', 'out', 'reclusive', 'woman', 'self-imposed', 'isolation', 'Warrior', 'episode', 'great', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'Walton', 'family', 'challenged', 'two', 'Native', 'American', 'Indians', 'who', 'claim', 'Walton', 'barn', 'over', 'sacred', 'Indial', 'burial', 'grounds', 'Indians', 'try', 'burn', 'down', 'barn', 'Waltons', 'resolve', 'dispute', 'honorable', 'fashion', 'Volunteer', 'actually', 'first', 'part', 'two-part', 'episode', 'involving', 'relationship', 'G.W', 'Erin', 'Erin', 'G.W', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'army', 'later', 'episode', 'G.W', 'dies', 'training', 'accident', 'Erin', 'deal', 'guilt', 'rejecting', 'G.W', 'Erin', 'GW', 'show', 'can', 'act', 'two', 'episodes', 'always', 'thought', 'acting', 'G.W', 'was', 'sort', 'wooden', 'two', 'episodes', 'maturity', 'not', 'seen', 'previous', 'seasons.Mary', 'Ellen', 'Curt', 'give', 'Waltons', 'first', 'grandchild', 'son', 'two-part', 'episode', 'mid-season', 'Milestone', 'Momma', 'Walton', 'chance', 'show', 'how', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'act', 'change', 'life', 'episode', 'tastefully', 'done', 'usual', 'Anniversary', '25th', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'John', 'Olivia', 'Walton', 'very', 'special', 'edition', 'deep', 'love', 'have', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'cracks', 'appear', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Curt', 'Curt', 'apart', 'Army.The', 'season', 'terrific', 'combination', 'episodes', 'first', 'Ordeal', 'two-parter', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'injured', 'Jim-Bob', 'Ben', 'have', 'deal', 'own', 'guilt', 'accident', 'one', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'especially', 'end', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'halting', 'steps', 'accident', 'John-Boy', 'returns', 'yet', 'two-part', 'episode', 'involving', 'disaster', 'reopenned', 'coal', 'mine', 'next', 'last', 'episode', 'classic', 'John-Boy', 'episode', 'where', 'marriage', 'long-term', 'girlfriend', 'Daisy', 'sudden', 'revelation', 'past', 'Finally', 'season', 'return', 'Grandma', 'Esther', 'Walton', 'Actress', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'had', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'away', 'show', 'early', 'Season', 'Five', 'tear-jerker', 'courage', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'returning', 'series', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'voice', 'result', 'stroke', 'have', 'applaud', 'producers', 'Waltons', 'bringing', 'back', 'Grandma', 'Walton', 'obvious', 'disability', 'Many', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'not', 'Waltons', 'deal', 'real-life', 'drama', 'situations', 'love', 'other', 'committment', 'family', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'endearing', 'who', 'love', 'series', 'am', 'sure', 'family', 'today', 'watching', 'Waltons', 'wishes', 'own', 'family', 'could', 'have', 'love', 'other', 'Waltons', 'together.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'season', 'purchase', 'well', 'investment', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'Waltons', 'tv', 'today', 'much', 'great', 'loss.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koening']","Waltons, The: S6"
