But his blandness is too easy and his search for respect and manliness is a dynamic that holds up the film.Props to Steve Martin for taking on such a different style and character, his pattern of lame remakes and sequels shades his deeper nature, here captured and-Mamet has got to have something to do with this!-executed well. But Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife-my knowing this probably hurts the film-nails the annoying, obvious, apparent, ""my god she's something other than she appears to be,"" secretary/assistant. She's so completely obvious...it distracts.Overall, I like the film, but I think Mamet is better at the set-up than the delivery, because the film, like Spartan, Heist, House of Games, State and Main, etc. excel in character, language and circumstance. But ultimately, if my feeling about The Spanish Prisoner is to be wary of rich mysterious types when you've invented a sure-fire cash cow, and ardent gabby type women who are interested in you to an obvious degree, then...",3,The Set-Up and the....,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1471,"['Dammit', 'man', 'take', 'breath', 'recognize', 'want', 'process', 'cost', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'liked', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'love', 'Mamet', 'point', 'view', 'language', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'reminded', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'watching', 'character', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'kick', 'ass', 'like', 'sympathize', 'with.Campbell', 'Scott', 'actor', 'admire', 'good', 'patsy', 'protagonist', 'blandness', 'too', 'easy', 'search', 'respect', 'manliness', 'dynamic', 'up', 'film.Props', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'taking', 'different', 'style', 'character', 'pattern', 'lame', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'deeper', 'nature', 'here', 'captured', 'and-Mamet', 'got', 'have', 'something', 'do', '-executed', 'well', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'Mamet', 'wife-my', 'knowing', 'probably', 'film-nails', 'annoying', 'obvious', 'apparent', 'god', 'something', 'other', 'be', 'secretary/assistant', 'so', 'completely', 'obvious', 'like', 'film', 'think', 'Mamet', 'better', 'set-up', 'delivery', 'film', 'Spartan', 'Heist', 'House', 'Games', 'State', 'Main', 'etc', 'excel', 'character', 'language', 'circumstance', 'ultimately', 'feeling', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'be', 'wary', 'rich', 'mysterious', 'types', 'when', ""'ve"", 'invented', 'sure-fire', 'cash', 'cow', 'ardent', 'gabby', 'type', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'obvious', 'degree', 'then']",N/A

I know many people will choose 'House of Games,' but I thought the 'Prisoner' storyline was better, and I really like the work turned in by Mamet novices Campbell Scott (whose combination of brains and naivete drives the film), Ben Gazzara and especially Steve Martin, who plays totally against type here.In the Mamet-penned 'Wag the Dog' we hear over and over again &quot;It's a pageant.&quot;  Replace that here with &quot;It's a process.&quot;  We hear over and over again about The Process.  We never find out what exactly the Process is (that's not the point), but all actions and reactions in 'Prisoner' involve securing, stealing and resecuring The Process.  It's a classic Mametian plot device and it works great here.For Mamet fans, there's a subset of regulars, most notably Mamet house players Ricky Jay and Jerry Graff.

10901,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0767811410,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 8/12Rate: 98/12: Coming off from a recent viewing of House of Games, I eagerly looked forward to the next thriller in The Spanish Prisoner. I've always liked David Mamet's works, and they do make for great pictures. Well, The Spanish Prisoner is perhaps a repeat of House of Games but not too much better. Perhaps, a little bit too refined. I am surprised that Jeremy Irons wasn't cast as Joe the mathematician in The Spanish Prisoner. The film is predictable as it gets because of the dead giveaways except for the ending which was a bit of a surprise. Then again, I haven't seen another film with such an ending like Twelve Monkeys. For a mathematician (as I ought know since I am a one), Joe is pretty stupid, and that is a put-off for me. Seeing the countenance on Joe's face, I expected him to have a Ph.D., be a near grandmaster in chess, be fluent in several world languages, and be an expert in couple of musical instruments. Yet he brings the book of the actual formulas to the meeting! No self-respecting mathematician would ever do that. Just make up the stuff, and it wouldn't make a difference because it takes a long time to unravel and decipher the information. Moreover, all mathematicians do double check everything and have already thought up of many scenarios to a problem/conflict. Why is that Joe did not do that is because David Mamet has no real understanding of how a mathematician's mind works. That's why The Spanish Prisoner is so flawed, but I enjoyed the film a lot and found it a good ride. When I saw the boatman asking for tickets near the end, I wasn't sure if that was Joe Mantegna or not. Alas, it was not he. I wish that was so because I wanted him to tell Joe the ultimate, ""Oh, you're a bad pony, and I'm not going to bet on you!"" Anyway, great performance by Campbell Scott, but Steve Martin? Not so much because he has been there and done that through Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Should've went with another actor. All in all, The Spanish Prisoner is a worthy predictable, deeply flawed film noir with plenty of Hitchcockian about it.",5,"Good Film, But House of Games Was Better.",1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,2079,"['Viewed', '8/12Rate', '98/12', 'Coming', 'off', 'recent', 'viewing', 'House', 'Games', 'eagerly', 'looked', 'forward', 'next', 'thriller', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'David', 'Mamet', 'works', 'do', 'make', 'great', 'pictures', 'Well', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'perhaps', 'repeat', 'House', 'Games', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'better', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'refined', 'am', 'surprised', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'was', ""n't"", 'cast', 'Joe', 'mathematician', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'film', 'predictable', 'dead', 'giveaways', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'Then', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'ending', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'mathematician', 'ought', 'know', 'am', 'one', 'Joe', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'put-off', 'Seeing', 'countenance', 'Joe', 'face', 'expected', 'have', 'Ph.D.', 'be', 'near', 'grandmaster', 'chess', 'be', 'fluent', 'several', 'world', 'languages', 'be', 'expert', 'couple', 'musical', 'instruments', 'book', 'actual', 'formulas', 'meeting', 'self-respecting', 'mathematician', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'Just', 'make', 'up', 'stuff', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'long', 'time', 'unravel', 'decipher', 'information', 'Moreover', 'mathematicians', 'do', 'double', 'check', 'everything', 'have', 'already', 'thought', 'many', 'scenarios', 'problem/conflict', 'Why', 'Joe', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'because', 'David', 'Mamet', 'real', 'understanding', 'how', 'mathematician', 'mind', 'why', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'so', 'flawed', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'found', 'good', 'ride', 'When', 'saw', 'boatman', 'asking', 'tickets', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'not', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'wish', 'was', 'so', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Joe', 'ultimate', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'bad', 'pony', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bet', 'Anyway', 'great', 'performance', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'went', 'actor', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'worthy', 'predictable', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'film', 'noir', 'plenty', 'Hitchcockian']",N/A

10903,A20IIR0422G3A5,0767811410,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 3]","`The Spanish Prisoner', written and directed by David Mamet and released in 1999 has been, since the time I first saw it, one of my most cherished `secret pleasures', along with Mamet's first film, `House of Cards'. The title is based on the name of a classic confidence game where the perp claims he left behind in `the home country (Spain, for example) his sister (or some other likely relative) and a large sum of money. The offer to the mark is that if the victem supplies enough money to rescue the prisoner, the mark will be rewarded with all the money in the treasure accompanying the `prisoner'.Oddly, the plot of the movie doesn't really fit this pattern too well, although it is clearly about a confidence game done on a large scale. It is easy to see that there is some great scam being played out here. The audience probably sees each step coming just before the mark, played by Ricky Jay, catches on. In most cases, the audience is given just enough clues to stay one step ahead of the relatively gullible mark. But, while the mark is has just a bit too little healty suspicion about the actions of the people around him, the con is, indeed, carried out with highly believable precision. If one has seen the movie `The Sting', it is even easier to see how an experienced team of con men could lay out so elaborate a plot.Having Steve Martin play the role of the primary con man is a brilliant piece of casting, not only for Martin's skill with this dramatic role, but in how easy it is for us to see him as nothing more than a very casual encounter on the resort island and in Manhattan.Like `The Sting', there are at least three layers of deceit at work. The top layer is fronted by Martin's character who is revealed as a con artist about half way through the film, when the mark finally goes to the NYPD, after being fooled by an FBI team which was actually part of the con.The second level is carried off by a character who does everything you would expect to maintain the mark's trust, and it is revealed to the audience that this character is part of the con several scenes before the mark discovers it, almost too late for his continued health.The third level is a total surprise, backed up by a surprise from `the good guys', who save the mark, in the end from being killed by the perps.While the story is involved and reality is bent just a bit by how easily the mark lets himself be lead into the trap, the cleverness of the plot easily holds up under multiple viewings. I am just a bit surprised at the extent to which the police are fooled into believing the web of lies built up around the perp's loosing the `treasure'.",4,Good Steve Martin Role as consummate con man.

What's left?  The Spanish Prisoner, an intelligent, quirky, well played film.Campell Scott plays Joe, an engineer who has slaved in a small boiler room office for who knows how long, creating an unnamed, unseen product that could propel his company instantly to Microsoft-like power and money.  Joe is a fundamentally good person who is not so meek as to let the company walk off with his invention without at least inquiring as to how he will be compensated.  He is also not above having his head turned when friendship is offered by a Gatsby type character played by Steve Martin.  Thus distracted, the basically naive Joe suddenly finds himself at the center of some bad business.  To reveal more is to spoil a concatenation of plot twists.This film is executed in high style.  It is written with respect for language and its rhythms.  Even the surreal aspects that surround Joe touch on familiar realities.  Joe's office is out of Dilbert, Kafka, Melville and all of our workplaces.  The secretary played by Rebecca Pidgeon could have been that annoying girl down the hall in your freshman dormitory.  The scenes of wealth shown or suggested by Martin's character tap into all our fantasies of how the jet set lives.  So Joe gets sucked in; so do we.As suspense films go, you can anticipate several of the twists, but not the last one, which is sort of a deus ex machina.

Written and directed by Mamet (House of Games, Glengarry Glen Ross, Wag the Dog), the film stars Campbell Scott, Steve Martin, Ben Gazzara, and Rebecca Pidgeon (who's married to Mamet).Scott plays Joseph Ross, an inventor who creates a top secret mathematical formula of sorts intended to allow for the manipulation of the stock market somehow, and has the potential to make a lot, a whole lot, of money for the company he works for...problem is Ross is beginning to have doubts about receiving his fair share, what he believes he's entitled to, from the company that plans to utilize the formula.  As he tries to negotiate an equitable agreement with the company, he meets a well to do businessman by the name of Julian `Jimmy' Dell (Martin) to which they become friendly, with Jimmy even offering to assist Joseph by putting him in contact with a lawyer that deals with contract law and proprietary information.  But nothing is what it seems in this film, as Joseph soon learns as he's accused of theft of the formula, and even murder, as evidence begins appearing that certainly points the finger at him, becoming the perfect patsy.  Will he be able to fully understand the intricacies of the con and learn who's involved before he captured by the police and/or FBI?  I know, but you'll just have to watch to find out...I really enjoyed this film, and all its' intricate twists and turns.  It's difficult to talk about without giving anything away, but the story is truly a wonderful mystery that will keep you guessing until the end, even if you manage to uncover some of the elements for yourself.  The crafting of the con within the story is really good, even though we see so very little of the machinations and planning behind it, instead seeing only the end results, as Scott's character is drawn into a world of fabrication, deceit, and lies.  My favorite role here was the character played by Steve Martin.  I thought he did an excellent job presenting a charming and sophisticated character, playing the rare serious role.  I do enjoy many of his comedic roles, but it's always a treat to see an actor successfully break out of his/her element and show they are more than what we see on the surface.  Scott was good, although I felt his character was just a bit too gullible at times, especially given the nature of his work.  I've never really cared for him much as an actor as he reminds me too much of that lame white guy from the 3rd season of MTV's The Real World (I think his name was Judd).  He was such a smarmy, wishy washy annoyance always following the majority, trying to present an image of the understanding, evolved, sophisticated, yet oh-so-sensitive male in touch with his feminine side, ever careful never to appear politically incorrect for fear of being offensive to the viewers on the other end of the camera, spouting meaningless phrases that make you want to punch him in the face like ""I feel your pain"", or ""Why can't we all just get along?"" but I digress...A couple of things about Mamet's movies, sort of his signatures to me, is the direction by Mamet giving the film the feel of not so much watching a film but of watching a play on film unfold outside of a stage and also the often times odd dialogue spoken throughout by a number of lead characters.  I think the latter element is what may put some viewers off, as it can sound very unrealistic and sometime contrived.  I mean have you ever heard anyone say, ""Worry is like interest paid in advance on a debt that never comes due""?  It sounds nice, but I know of no one in real life that talks like this, spouting strange and introspective statements off the cuff (you could catch a beating in my neighborhood for doing so).  I suppose the character played by Rebecca Pidgeon had the most noticeably odd lines, especially seeming out of her character.  Maybe these looked good on paper, but I feel it takes a really good actor to pull them off on screen, and make them sound natural.  I like Rebecca Pidgeon, as she's very sexy in a demure way and, I believe, a capable actress, but I felt she wasn't able to pull off some of the lines she was given here, within the context of her character.The picture presented here looks very clear and crisp, and the disc is two sided, with a wide screen version on one side, and full screen format on the other.  I did feel the audio was a bit soft, but English subtitles are available.  I did find the subtitles didn't always match exactly what was spoken, and I thought that a little weird.  Not much here with regards to special features other than a theatrical trailer and brief production notes on the insert inside the DVD.Overall, I think The Spanish Prisoner is a very good, low-key mystery thriller that will keep you on your toes until the end and does have replay value if only to better understand the layered complexities within the story (I've seen it twice), but I still feel a better Mamet film to watch is the first he wrote and directed in House of Games, with Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna.Cookieman108",4,"""Beware of all enterprises which require new

Remember, this guy is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright.Then  there's Mamet's plotting: we know there are going to be &quot;bad&quot;  people--masters of the Big Con--conniving to steal Campbell Scott's  lucrartive &quot;process&quot; (one of the best MacGuffin's since  Hitchcock), but trying to determine who's in on it and who's an innocent  (?) bystander is one of the ongoing delightful puzzles of the movie.  Mamet  slowly reveals the true colors of his characters like a master at stud  poker.  Eventually poor Campbell realizes he's been robbed, framed and  screwed eight ways til Sunday (in a brilliant interrogation scene where  most of the pieces come together), and as viewers, we feel as tightly  trapped as he does.Finally there are the perfomaces: Scott's nicely  understated playing of the niave but brainy techno-geek, Steve Martin's  deft characterization of the moody, mysterious millionare, and Rebecca  Pigeon's suspiciously winsome gal Friday.  Many of Mamet's old  &quot;Chicago school&quot; regulars show up, though poor Ricky Jay gets  stuck mouthing a lot of platitudes--one of the few weakness of Mamet's  script.Yes, maybe this film isn't quite as brilliant as &quot;House of  Games,&quot; Mamet's previous exploration of the Big Con, but darn few  movies are.  The deus ex machina ending is less satisfying than  &quot;House&quot;'s more character-driven conclusion, and I sure miss Joe  Mantegna (no one spits out Mamet's dialog with quite his authority).  Nonetheless, &quot;Prisoner&quot; stands up to multiple viewings without  losing its appeal or mystery, and may in fact require more than one viewing  in order to be truly appreciated for its labyrinthine plotting and  underlying themes.",5,Another Great Con-Game Movie From Mamet,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,1947,"['First', 'Mamet', 'dialogue', 'punchy', 'pungent', 'once', 'surreal', 'downright', 'earthy', 'pidgin', 'English', 'out', 'sounding', 'weird', 'contrived', 'actor', 'mouths', 'sounding', 'as', 'honest', 'breathing', 'Remember', 'guy', 'also', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'playwright.Then', 'Mamet', 'plotting', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'people', 'masters', 'Big', 'Con', 'conniving', 'steal', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'lucrartive', 'quot', 'process', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'MacGuffin', 'Hitchcock', 'trying', 'determine', 'who', 'who', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'one', 'ongoing', 'delightful', 'puzzles', 'movie', 'Mamet', 'slowly', 'true', 'colors', 'characters', 'master', 'stud', 'poker', 'Eventually', 'poor', 'Campbell', 'been', 'robbed', 'framed', 'screwed', 'eight', 'ways', 'til', 'Sunday', 'brilliant', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'where', 'most', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'viewers', 'feel', 'tightly', 'trapped', 'does.Finally', 'are', 'perfomaces', 'Scott', 'nicely', 'understated', 'playing', 'niave', 'brainy', 'techno-geek', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'deft', 'characterization', 'moody', 'mysterious', 'millionare', 'Rebecca', 'Pigeon', 'suspiciously', 'winsome', 'gal', 'Friday', 'Many', 'Mamet', 'old', 'quot', 'Chicago', 'school', 'quot', 'regulars', 'show', 'up', 'poor', 'Ricky', 'Jay', 'stuck', 'mouthing', 'lot', 'platitudes', 'one', 'few', 'weakness', 'Mamet', 'script.Yes', 'maybe', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'House', 'Games', 'quot', 'Mamet', 'previous', 'exploration', 'Big', 'Con', 'darn', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending', 'less', 'satisfying', 'quot', 'House', 'quot', 'more', 'character-driven', 'conclusion', 'sure', 'miss', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'one', 'out', 'Mamet', 'dialog', 'authority', 'Nonetheless', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'losing', 'appeal', 'mystery', 'may', 'fact', 'require', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'order', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'labyrinthine', 'plotting', 'underlying', 'themes']",N/A

Pidegon has an interesting face and was new on the film scene when this came. She's made a couple of films since that are recognizable but I can't say the same for Scott. Also making smaller appearances here are ""name"" players, Steve Martin and Ben Gazzara.  Of course, they're on the cover of the DVD, which is a bit misleading.The story is about an elaborate con job perpetrated on Scott.

If he had somehow managed to cheat death, it would have been he, not David Mamet, who would be taking credit for the fiendishly clever ""The Spanish Prisoner"". As it is, Hitch will have to settle for merely being the inspiration behind this most excellent diabolical work world nightmare.Taking its title from the con game, ""The Spanish Prisoner"" plays sleight of hand with the audience, its writer/director, Mamet, functioning as prestidigitator. The cards comprising the deck of the plot are played out before us, a hand is waved, and everything comes up aces. Casting, plot, and quintessential dialog provided by Mamet, all add up to one of the finest psycho-thrillers to hit the screen in a long, long time.Campbell Scott plays Joe Ross, a vain young man who has created ""The Process"" that will net his company untold wealth - so untold that despite a final figure written on a blackboard for all the movers to see, we glimpse only Joe's beaming face. While on a Caribbean excursion to enlighten the powers of his corporate home, Joe meets Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin in a laudable casting decision against type). The mysterious Dell takes Joe under his wealthy wing and eventually asks a favor - that Joe deliver a package to Jimmy's sister when he returns to New York. Once on the plane, Joe's pert new secretary, Susan (Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), lapses into a discussion concerning the fate of those asked to be mules for the drug trade. Joe immediately begins to question his taking of Jimmy's package and fears that he may have sabotaged his entire life in an act of Boy Scoutish good graces. Indeed he has, but not in the way he envisions.No good magician gives away his secrets, nor will I endeavor to elucidate further on Joe's inevitable fate. ""The Spanish Prisoner"" is a joyously twisted affair that is cunning, ruthlessly efficient, and humorous in its payoff. It is a two hour treasure that I can honestly recommend to just about any thinking person of any age. The plot is a bit too convoluted for young children, but teens and adults will certainly enjoy it.""But,"" you cry, ""this is a David Mamet film. Doesn't that mean trainloads of profanity?"" It's amazing to me to say, but I can't remember anything objectionable at all in this film. True, a PG Mamet seems like an oxymoron, but anyone can watch this.

The premise is a con, called &quot;the Spanish Prisoner&quot; con.  Steve Martin is the chief con artist, Jimmy Dell, while Campbell Scott is the victim, Joe Ross, whose proprietary business formula--displayed prominently throughout the movie as a red bound notebook--is the booty.Most of us are familiar with this con from our e-mail where it typically takes the form of an African or the Middle Eastern princess seeking help from us to escape from a corrupt society or an oppressive husband.  We are advised that she has many millions of dollars but can't get them out of the country without our help in the form of a few thousand bucks for various fees, etc.  If we send the money we are assured that we will get a significant percentage of the millions.Here the come-on includes a dark-haired beauty we see only in passing and in photos.  Playing her foil is Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's talented wife) as Susan Ricci, a somewhat ditzy secretary for Joe's company.  At the beginning everything is opaque and intriguing.  It's not clear who is who, and who can be trusted and who can't.  Indeed if this movie had a theme it would be &quot;you can't trust anybody.&quot;  The real worry, however, seems to be whether Joe will get paid for his work.  Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara) keeps putting him off.  And so it appears that we may be viewing another business and relationships satire for which Mamet is justly famous (e.g., Glengarry Glen Ross 1992), but after a bit we begin to see the sinister plot unfold.The acting is good and Mamet sets up his plot twists with precision--although the resolutions of some of the twists are a bit strained; in fact, probability and logic, in keeping with the time-honored tenets of the genre, are sometimes just plain ignored.  But what carries this unusual thriller is an underlying tone of irony.  Steve Martin is perfectly cast because underneath his sly exterior there seems lurking a guy about to bust out laughing; and indeed the entire edifice is a crafty but covert spoof of Hollywood thrillers.  It's almost as though Mamet set out to write and direct a standard thriller but just couldn't help himself.  On the other hand he may have had the understated parody in mind all the way, but just didn't want to tell anybody!  Certainly Steve Martin was not fooled, but I do wonder about Campbell Scott who played his part with such single-minded intensity.Anyway, there's a lot of clever dialogue, some of it cribbed (&quot;Beware of enterprises requiring new clothes&quot; is from Thoreau), and some interesting stage business (the tickets, the tennis book, the red-bound book, the camera/gun, the club certificate/request for passage to Venezuela, etc.).  And trying to figure out who is up to what will keep you awake.  But see this for Rebecca Pidgeon who, in her way, is as original as Mamet.  Although her role here is not strictly comedic she reminds me a little of the Japanese comedic actress, Nobuko Miyamoto, widow of director Juzo Itami.  She also reminds me of somebody who should be playing Saturday Night Live.

10918,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,0767811410,Earl Hazell,"[3, 4]","Mamet seems to be attracted to a particular style of acting that doesn't compete with his screenplays, as if too much emotionalism or sometimes too much realism would get in its way.  Despite the fact that this seeming trend toward his casting and requirements for character development of his actors is totally discarded with GLENGARRY, GLEN ROSS (a virtuoso masterpiece that plays like the Miles Davis Quintet the late-sixties), it is evident here.  The beginning of this movie can come off almost cold, distant and wooden because of it; as if it is screaming the words INTRODUCTION; PROLOGUE; ON TO ACT I while you are watching the characters be introduced.Nonetheless, what Mamet really seems to demand is an economy of reality and emotion as opposed to the absence of it, as is made manifest in all the moments of the film thereafter.  Steve Martin is brilliant in this; he is one of those comedians who, moreso than even the fine/eerie work Robin Williams has been doing the past year and a half, can completely channel his spirit into a serious part in a way that makes you believe he was never a comic actor.  Ben Gazzara makes you ignore him, distrust him, dislike him...and then shockingly feel for him in this role of a corporate boss.  Campbell Scott, the main character, seems to work within the economy of emotion and reality that I mentioned Mamet seems to require, and where it comes off as wooden in the beginning, there are some profound and provocative scenes that suck you in and make him powerful with every scene thereafter.Mamet's directing is fine in this movie; little he does distracts you from either the characters or the story.  But as you would expect from him, the screenplay is the real star of this film.  If you have been hungering for a smart, edgy, thinking man/woman's film to rent before enjoying the quality junk food of X-MEN 2 and the dessert of MATRIX RELOADED (my weekend plans), this is the full, Thanksgiving Day-type meal to fit between the two for you.  Describing what this film is truly about--not to mention what the title actually refers to--would actually be giving so much of it away that I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to avoid reviews that do so.  Mamet, beginning with HOUSE OF GAMES, has mastered a genre of films to such a degree that THE SPANISH PRISONER will make you wonder if he in fact invented the genre itself.This will keep you guessing until the end, even when you think you've figured it all out.

The acting isn't perfect, there are some ""loose ends"" and the dialogue takes some getting used to.  But it's a brilliant film in many ways and very entertaining.This is a fascinating film, despite its flaws. It's a must-see for Hitchcock fans (just likeDead Againwith Kenneth Branaugh) for all the wonderful Hitchcockian touches Mamet inserts.  The music, the camera work, all resemble Hitchcock's style. Hitchcock liked to include what he called ""refrigerator scenes""-- that is, scenes that can't be easily explained.  He said that people would go home and stand  around the fridge talking about them and trying to figure them out.  (The most famous is inVertigo (Collector's Edition)when the Kim Novak character is seen in a window but when the apartment is searched, it's empty and no explanation is offered.)  Several scenes in this film qualify for that- how does the certificate transform? How did they pull off the restaurant/club thing?  Also, Hitchcock was famous for his ""MacGuffins""-- items which moved the plot along but really were nothing. (Again, a famous one would be the money that's stolen in ""Psycho""- by the end of the movie no one cares about the money.) The ""formula"" appears to be a MacGuffin-- just something to get the story going- it really doesn't matter whether the formula exists, is a fake, or whatever.

For quite some time, he has been one of the finest dramatic authors for the stage, and has recently proven his ability to write for the screen with Glengarry Glen Ross, Wag The Dog, and the excellent script that is The Spanish Prisoner. We have here the definition of a &quot;taut thriller.&quot;The acting is quite good. One weak spot can be found in Rebecca Pidgeon, but her flat and lackluster performance is generally made up for by Campbell Scott and Steve Martin. The acting coupled with the script immediately draws you into this intriguing story of The Process and how it affects its creator, Joe Ross (Scott).As good as Mamet's script may be, however, his heavy-handed directing tips its hand. There are enough small hints in the dialogue, enough subtle clues in the surrounding, that the plot's twists and turns would be believable. Unfortunately, Mamet felt the need to throw a few blatant foreshadowed bits in our face to dumb down the film to be sure everyone would &quot;get&quot; the ending. It wasn't necessary, and it turned a great script into a good movie.Is it worth seeing? Sure; it's a great example of how a thriller should be written. Is it worth buying to watch again and again?

His participation in this film - along with a role that is an about face for him - solidifies his brilliance.This script is impeccable - Hitchcockian - and, as I understand from the credits - a remake of a black and white thriller.which I am now dying to see. It focuses on the subsequent circumstances the inventor of a &quot;secret formula&quot; finds himself drawn into. Rather than focusing on the formula, as many blockbusters would, the film takes a more intelligent twist, leaving the formula in the background and the audience more unsuspecting. Pigeon's performance as the love interest in the film may appear shallow through a first viewing, but a second viewing will make you sit up and notice the depth that she portrays. Our leading man portrays naivete in a manner so realistic, the film envelops an almost documentary atmosphere - which, in turn, delivers a far more sinister punch than it would if the central character were some type of superhuman character. As an &quot;average joe&quot;, he easily gains sympathy and believability. In fact, the power of the film lies heavily in its' realistic direction and character development.Unless you are impressed with detail and find a lack of eye candy to be somewhat of a relief, this film may not be for you. But, if you enjoy scripts that leave your mind spinning and planning a second viewing as the credit rolls by - this is the film for you.",5,The Spanish Prisoner will take you captive.,1000425600,"09 14, 2001",2001,2287,"['What', 'refreshment', 'loudly', 'applaud', 'makers', 'glorious', 'film', 'standing', 'up', 'showing', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spend', 'kind', 'money', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'year', 'just', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'theater', 'date', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Rather', 'throwing', 'punches', 'had', 'offer', 'credits', 'exasperating', 'storyline', 'hour', 'film', 'presented', 'one', 'Emeril', 'dishes', 'plenty', 'spice', 'slowly', 'properly', 'cooked', 'occassional', 'quot', 'bam', 'quot', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'tremendous', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'have', 'usually', 'preferred', 'more', 'intellectual', 'films', 'proved', 'genius', 'good', 'taste', 'updated', 'versions', 'quot', 'Cyrano', 'De', 'Bergerac', 'quot', 'quot', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'quot', 'films', 'quot', 'Roxanne', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Simple', 'Twist', 'Fate', 'quot', 'participation', 'film', 'role', 'face', 'solidifies', 'brilliance.This', 'script', 'impeccable', 'Hitchcockian', 'understand', 'credits', 'remake', 'black', 'white', 'thriller.which', 'am', 'now', 'dying', 'see', 'subsequent', 'circumstances', 'inventor', 'quot', 'secret', 'formula', 'quot', 'drawn', 'Rather', 'focusing', 'formula', 'many', 'blockbusters', 'would', 'film', 'more', 'intelligent', 'twist', 'leaving', 'formula', 'background', 'audience', 'more', 'unsuspecting', 'Pigeon', 'performance', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'shallow', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'viewing', 'will', 'make', 'sit', 'up', 'notice', 'depth', 'leading', 'man', 'naivete', 'manner', 'so', 'realistic', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary', 'atmosphere', 'turn', 'far', 'more', 'sinister', 'punch', 'would', 'central', 'character', 'were', 'type', 'superhuman', 'character', 'quot', 'average', 'joe', 'quot', 'easily', 'gains', 'sympathy', 'believability', 'fact', 'power', 'film', 'heavily', 'realistic', 'direction', 'character', 'development.Unless', 'are', 'impressed', 'detail', 'find', 'lack', 'eye', 'candy', 'be', 'somewhat', 'relief', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enjoy', 'scripts', 'leave', 'mind', 'spinning', 'planning', 'second', 'viewing', 'credit', 'rolls', 'film']",N/A

10934,A2T049UQONS0OY,0767811410,Larry VanDeSande,"[8, 12]","Campbell Scott gives a fine, restrained and ultimatley unbelievable performance as the sap in this film rendition of David Mamet's Kafkaesque screenplay about deceit, paranois, theft and idiocy. Playwright Mamet has traversed this ground before in 1992's ""The Water Engine"", a similarly droll screenplay about which Amazon gives this synopsis:""In the 1930s, Charles Lang invents an engine that runs using water for fuel. But when he tries to get it patented, he is first offered a ridiculously low amount. When he refuses, he is suddenly several people are pressuring him to sell. The big oil companies don't want the competition. Now he has to try and keep them from getting his idea, and somehow get it published. ""If you substitute Scott's late 1990s draft of an unstated new technology for the water engine, you have the makings of ""The Spanish Prisoner"", which is defined in the film as the oldest scam in the book: A guy marries a Spanish queen but can't bring her home. To rescue her and her fortune in Spain, he must have the riches of someone else invested. This is what Scott faces and falls for.I like Campbell Scott as an actor and think he does fine work, but his role is too comfortable with being the sap in this film. Even when circumstances dent the denseness of his senses and he finally realizes he's being scammed, he still falls for the girl and unwittingly participates in a set up murder. This is a guy smart enough to invent a new technology that can't find a way not to participate in a set up!My wife, who is something of an expert at figuring out the clues in mysteries like this one, pegged the two earliest clues immediately after they were presented -- Scott being given a Swiss bank account (not full of cheese!) and signing his name to a fraudlent document that comes back to haunt him later.Similar events occurred during Mamet's ""The Water Engine"", whose premise seemed more well thought out and realistic than the never stated technology of this film. Where Kafka's paranoia was under the umbrella of post World War II European communism, Mamet's paranoia is built around corporate intrigue where all that pretend to be your allies are indeed your competitors and  are out to fleece you from your fortune. In this vein, poor Campbell Scott doesn't have a friend in the whole flick. Even his erstwhile boss (Ben Gazarra) is involved in the scam.Steve Martin is hit and miss in an unsuitably dramatic and despicable role that is pretty much out of character for him. Other supporting characters, incluidng the fetching Mrs. Mamet as one of several femme fatales, are effective in a monochromatic way. The script begins with promise but shows its superficiality the longer it unfolds. It becomes ridiculous at the end, almost cartoonish.Still this can be a pleasant experience for mystery watchers that will fill an evening when nothing better is available.

10941,A319KYEIAZ3SON,0767811410,Mary Whipple,"[13, 14]","Written and directed by David Mamet, this clever thriller of industrial espionage is full of surprising twists and turns which keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.  Joe Ross (Campbell Scott), a young man working under a special contract, has developed ""the process"" which will allow a company to control the global market.  Only Ross and the company president, Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara), have keys to the safe where the notes on the process are kept, and high security has been maintained, but Ross is edgy.  Klein has not paid him a bonus and is dragging his feet about rewarding him appropriately.Devious manipulators conspire to make Ross even more uncertain about Klein's loyalty, hoping they can steal the formula and sell it to European or Japanese competitors.  Front and center in the plot is Jimmy Dell (smarmily played by Steve Martin), who masquerades as a very wealthy high flyer, appealing to Ross's desire to get what he deserves and fears he won't get from Mr. Klein.  Appealing to Ross's natural paranoia, Dell soon has him doing exactly what he wants, as Ross tries to ""protect"" himself from Klein.This intricately plotted conspiracy keeps the viewer on the edge of the chair, trying to figure out what is going on.  As Ross begins to discover Dell's lies, the film offers one surprise after another, and these surprises keep coming right up to the blockbuster ending.  Viewers will be fascinated to look back to see how the conspiracy and the plotting have set them up for the surprises.  The music introducing the film is appropriately romantic, mysterious, and ominous, and repeats throughout for emphasis.  The cinematography (Gabriel Beristain), even for somewhat trite scenes, is effective and adds to the suspense.Unfortunately, the dialogue is filled with clich&eacute;s and clunky  remarks, a surprise considering Mamet's stage background.  Unrealistic and ponderous comments abound, always followed by a trenchant pause.  Dell, remarking to Ross about his sister, says, ""All we ever had was each other (pause).""  A policeman tells Ross, ""You'll be back (pause).""  Another says, ""Always do business as if the person you're doing business with is [betraying] you (pause).""  The acting is generally good, and Ed O'Neil has a nice cameo as an FBI investigator.  Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, plays Susan Ricci, a role which is not clearly developed or integrated and for which she seems a bit too mature.  Despite the clumsy dialogue, this is an exciting film, great fun to watch for its unexpected twists and turns.

10943,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767811410,Matthew Horner,"[13, 18]","You can forget the dreaded Fear of Foreign Films. ""The Spanish Prisoner"" is in English. In fact, it takes place in America. This movie is so great that I'm giving you but one clue about the title. It does not refer to a person. If you haven't seen it or read about it, but know what the term means, I doubt I'd want to be within a thousand miles of you.The director and writer, David Mamet, is both talented and prolific. His many writing credits include ""Ronin"", ""Wag the Dog"", ""The Edge"" and ""The Untouchables"". As good as his work is on big projects, he truly excels on smaller ones such as ""The Spanish Prisoner"", 1988's ""Things Change"", and 1987's ""House of Games"".Reviewers relentlessly compare countless suspense thrillers to those of the master, Alfred Hitchcock. They cringe in horror at any remake of one of his films, even before it goes into production. Mamet's film follows the formula of the genre so perfectly that I suspect Hitch himself would have loved it and perhaps would not have seen an attempt to imitate his style.What Mamet understands is that a thriller is not the same animal as a mystery. A thriller has less to do with who done it that it does with the suspense created by our trying to figure out how - or if - the main character is going to get out of the terrible mess he or she has gotten trapped in. I have always found this setting to be especially chilling, because it makes me think of a large spider's web.You will note that it is rated PG. Don't be fooled by that innocent tag. It's dark, intense and devious. It is crammed with characters who lie, cheat and steal with style and relish. You could almost say they love their work. The movie is so rated because it's a rare example of substance over style.Except for Steve Martin, the cast members have made careers by working in independent productions. I must tell you that Mr. Martin's character is serious, and he is excellent as an affable yet mysterious businessman.""The Spanish Prisoner"" has several layers to it. It may be the best film of its type you'll see this year, and on that level, it is pure entertainment. Underneath the fun and games, there is a chilling indictment of the way big business is conducted. David Mamet is most sophisticated, and the viewpoint is that things are run today in the same way they have been for centuries. When huge sums of money show up, even otherwise honest people can quickly be filled with greed and lust. Why, when the Spaniards arrived at what is now Mexico City, they encountered what was then the largest city in the world. What they saw was gold in quantities they never dreamed existed. Unfortunately for the Aztecs, they'd never bothered to have it appraised.As in all of Mamet's work, ""The Spanish Prisoner"" is full of memorable dialog. I'll never know how this technique went out of style. ""Hasta la vista, baby"" does not a screenplay make. Dialog is the way characters are developed and defined. It also sets the tone. So Mamet's characters say words like this: ""We must never forget we are human, and as humans we dream, and when we dream, we dream of money."" Or this: ""Never trust an enterprise that requires you to buy new clothes."" These words easily connect us to the way the characters think and feel.",5,One of my Top Ten of 1998,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3255,"['can', 'forget', 'dreaded', 'Fear', 'Foreign', 'Films', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'English', 'fact', 'place', 'America', 'movie', 'so', 'great', ""'m"", 'giving', 'one', 'clue', 'title', 'not', 'refer', 'person', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'read', 'know', 'what', 'term', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'want', 'be', 'thousand', 'miles', 'you.The', 'director', 'writer', 'David', 'Mamet', 'talented', 'prolific', 'many', 'writing', 'credits', 'include', 'Ronin', 'Dog', 'Edge', 'Untouchables', 'As', 'good', 'work', 'big', 'projects', 'truly', 'smaller', 'ones', 'such', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', '1988', 'Things', 'Change', '1987', 'House', 'Games', '.Reviewers', 'relentlessly', 'compare', 'countless', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'master', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'cringe', 'horror', 'remake', 'one', 'films', 'even', 'production', 'Mamet', 'film', 'formula', 'genre', 'so', 'perfectly', 'suspect', 'Hitch', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'perhaps', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'attempt', 'imitate', 'style.What', 'Mamet', 'thriller', 'not', 'same', 'animal', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'less', 'do', 'who', 'done', 'suspense', 'created', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'going', 'get', 'terrible', 'mess', 'gotten', 'trapped', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'setting', 'be', 'especially', 'chilling', 'think', 'large', 'spider', 'web.You', 'will', 'note', 'rated', 'PG', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'innocent', 'tag', 'dark', 'intense', 'devious', 'crammed', 'characters', 'who', 'lie', 'cheat', 'steal', 'style', 'relish', 'could', 'almost', 'say', 'love', 'work', 'movie', 'so', 'rated', 'rare', 'example', 'substance', 'style.Except', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'made', 'careers', 'working', 'independent', 'productions', 'must', 'tell', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'character', 'serious', 'excellent', 'affable', 'yet', 'mysterious', 'businessman', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'several', 'layers', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'type', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'level', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'fun', 'games', 'chilling', 'indictment', 'way', 'big', 'business', 'conducted', 'David', 'Mamet', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'viewpoint', 'things', 'are', 'run', 'today', 'same', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'centuries', 'When', 'huge', 'sums', 'money', 'show', 'up', 'even', 'otherwise', 'honest', 'people', 'can', 'quickly', 'be', 'filled', 'greed', 'lust', 'Why', 'when', 'Spaniards', 'arrived', 'what', 'now', 'Mexico', 'City', 'encountered', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'largest', 'city', 'world', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'gold', 'quantities', 'never', 'dreamed', 'existed', 'Unfortunately', 'Aztecs', ""'d"", 'never', 'bothered', 'have', 'appraised.As', 'Mamet', 'work', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'full', 'memorable', 'dialog', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'how', 'technique', 'went', 'style', 'Hasta', 'la', 'vista', 'baby', 'not', 'screenplay', 'make', 'Dialog', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'defined', 'also', 'tone', 'So', 'Mamet', 'characters', 'say', 'words', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'are', 'human', 'humans', 'dream', 'when', 'dream', 'dream', 'money', 'Never', 'trust', 'enterprise', 'buy', 'new', 'clothes', 'words', 'easily', 'connect', 'way', 'characters', 'think', 'feel']",N/A

From step one (the sea plane landing) to the final act (the pseudo-japanese tourists being on exactly the right water taxi out of hundreds of others), the audience is asked to believe that these staged coincidences are possible.  They're not, and so the film becomes unconvincing from start to finish.Setting: Is it 1940's film noir?  Is it the 90's?  Is this some sort of Jimmy Buffet island theme mystery gone sour?  Hard to tell.  Oddly enough, it almost appears intentionally so.  The potential gains from the formula are written on a blackboard but not shown to the audience.  Phones look modern (for the 1990's), but you still have secretaries dialing for execs.  I'm not sure when ""get me [name here] on the phone, Dolores"" went out of style, but it was definitely before the 90's.Costuming: so/so.  No real issues here, other than it's a little ambiguous.Cinematography: My biggest beef.  If you're going to do a 1940's film noir knock-off, film it in grainy B&W; or at least work the camera angles better.  L.A. Story et alia do a much better job of evoking the period and the genre.  There were a few half-hearted attempts (the focus on the sunshine bakery bag, for example), but none accomplished much more than making me wonder why they bothered.Misc:- The use of the carousel was an obvious nod to The Sting.  Unfortunately, this movie had none of the campy believability of that classic.- The female lead was a bad pick.  Steve Martin made a decent attempt to carry the bad dialogue, but she just cranked out each monotone wooden line one after the other as if people anywhere or anywhen had actually spoken in that fashion.  It would be hard for one actress to ruin a film, but she gives it an old college try.- The lead character makes a big deal over the fact that his formula is locked in a safe- but then leaves it scribbled on a blackboard covered only with a curtain.",1,"Don't buy this movie.

10946,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0767811410,Mike Stone,"[1, 1]","At this point, for a contemporary filmmaker to ""do a Hitchcock"", it has become necessary for said filmmaker to understand all the cliches that come with that territory.  And to further understand that if used, those cliches will stick out like a sore thumb (for example).  The contemporary filmmaker must not try and avoid the use of those cliches (for that will surely let the audience down), but revel in them to the point where they become grandiose, distracting the viewer from the inherent holes in the plot that inevitably hinders such an endeavor.  These aren't my rules, mind you.  I'm just transcribing what was obviously on David Mamet's mind when conceiving ""The Spanish Prisoner"".He starts out with a classic Hitchcock MacGuffin: The Process, which (in conjunction with the Formula and the Company) gets Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) in more trouble than he can handle.  We are never told what the Process is, or even how much wealth it will generate.  In fact, it is made obvious that information is being withheld (witness the scene where Ross writes a figure on a blackboard -- projected earnings for the Company -- where all we see is the leading dollar sign), so much so that it frees us from trying to deduce any further.  Relax and enjoy the plot, Mamet says.And a fine plot it is, shaped like a Mobius strip, where just when you think you've figured out who the good guys are, the thing flips over to reveal that there's more to it on the underside.  It nearly got to the point where the whole enterprise became tiresome, and I just wanted to know who really set poor Joe up.  Even though the ending was kind of clumsy, I was glad that it came when it did.I guess what really elevates the piece over other faux-Hitchcockian works is the dialogue.  To state the obvious, Mamet has a wonderful flair for language.  Here, he's toned down his patented rat-a-tat-tat patter.  It still takes a while to get used to its artificial rhythms, but about a third of the way through, it becomes relaxed and musical.  A real joy.  It should also be noted that Mamet acquits himself well as a director.  His camera shows us just enough so that we think we've gotten the whole picture, but haven't really at all.The performers, for the most part, are rather effective.  Campbell Scott is in every scene, and does a fine job as the innocent caught in the con.  Steve Martin is understated to the point of being laconic, a perfect choice for his character.  Ben Gazzara, Ricky Jay, and Felicity Huffman make the best of their minor roles (although Jay's character seems to be little more than a collection of epigrams for the cynical capitalist).  Rebecca Pidgeon (Mrs. Mamet), on the other hand, is horrible.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Well, not really.  In the beginning, she is kind of clunky.  Her character is nothing more than an awkward vessel for exposition.  And she hasn't the flair for her husband's dialogue that the other actors do.  But her role turns meaty enough as we move along, and she eventually gets the hang of things.  Still, I think the movie would have been better served overall if she'd switch roles with Huffman, an actress who has proven, on Aaron Sorkin's Mametesque sitcom `SportsNight' (R.I.P.), to have a flair for this kind of dialogue.Even though quite flawed at times, I found myself (literally) on the edge of my seat throughout the entire third act.  It's a wonderfully conceived and executed movie that, even though it has Mamet's fingerprints all over it, would've made Hitch proud.",4,It's Mamet?  It's Hitchcock?

Pope,"[4, 13]","I didn't know Rebecca Pigeon was the director's wife until now, but that explains why she did the most memorable acting in a film full of bad acting, and I don't mean that in a good way. In fact her acting and his scriptwriting was so bad, I was determined not to forget to review the film. Perhaps some of the actors should not get all the blame, but didn't they read the script before signing on? Speaking of reading before signing, the paper Steve Martin's character signed said Club Membership, so isn't it cheating for the director to later make it look like he signed something to open a Swiss bank account, which by the way is a Swiss state secret, so how did they know? I think the director/writer has no clue how people really talk. Most of these 5 star reviews on here suspiciously use the same words always referring to, David Mamet, by name, and as the brilliant writer. Do that many reviewers talk about the writer by name typically? That seems as odd as the phrasing of his dialogue with zingers like having more than one character say the same odd phrase ""a man once said..."". It's like bad Shakespeare.I have never seen a film in which I was hit over the head with the same clue, not once but 3 times. I guessed it with no clues, so I could't believe he thought anyone would need to hear it 3 times. How can they call it a plot twist if you predicted it? If Mamet is brilliant then this is all intentional which means he is twisted enough to dumb down a movie script so much that morons can feel smart that they guesses what was really happening.

10955,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767811410,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","When you meet a stranger, your first impression is often very telling, and good instincts can be very valuable.  Because people are not always whom or what they appear to be, which is the case in ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" written and directed by David Mamet.  As can be expected in a Mamet story, the con is on once again, and this time it involves a certain valuable formula developed by a man named Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) for a company run by a Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara).  It's a formula that will put them ahead of the Japanese for the next three to five years, and during that time it's going to make everyone in the company very rich.  Only two people have access to the formula, which is written on Xerox-proof paper and kept in a safe:  Joe and Mr. Klein.  Joe, however, is somewhat concerned about being properly compensated for his work, as he is not a full time employee of the company, but took this particular job as a work-for-hire; and Mr. Klein has a way of putting off any talk of how much Joe can expect by telling him to wait until the ""Board meeting.""  And it's making Joe a bit anxious.In the meantime, Joe meets another man, Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a wealthy businessman who ingratiates himself with Joe and in a subtle, passive-aggressive way inflames Joe's doubts about whether or not he will eventually get his due from Mr. Klein and the company.  Joe has no reason to suspect that Jimmy wants anything from him; Jimmy apparently has enough irons in his own fires and he shows no real interest in whatever it is that Joe is involved in, business wise.  He's merely a man who seems to know finance, and his counsel to Joe is nothing more than well-disposed advice to a friend with a mutual concern from someone with experience.  Jimmy even goes so far as offering to have his lawyers look into Joe's affairs.  Joe is not exactly naive, but he lacks experience in these matters.  He trusts Jimmy, but he still wants to believe that Mr. Klein and the company will do right by him eventually.  It's something of a conundrum, but very quickly things begin to happen that force Joe's hand and make it necessary for him to make some decisions.  And it all comes down to the age old question:  Who do you trust?Mamet certainly knows how to weave a web, and what makes this one so effective is the fact that with a clever, detailed screenplay he never lets the audience in on anything more than what they have to know at any given point in time.  Watching the story unfold, you never know any more than what Joe knows, which allows you to experience it all first hand, so to speak, through Joe.  It all becomes very confusing very quickly, and it's supposed to be; it's what makes it so engrossing and very subtly gets you inching ever closer to the edge of your seat.  You-- like Joe-- know that something is going on, but you never know exactly what or who's behind it.  That it has something to do with the formula and Joe's access to it is obvious early on, but beyond that, anything goes.  It's complex storytelling, and Mamet makes it even more mesmerizing with his unique touch of having his actors deliver their lines in a clipped, rhythmic manner, which combined with the plot makes this spellbinding cinema.Campbell Scott is well cast as Joe Ross; he has the look and affects a manner completely compatible with his character.  Anyone who has ever been in a position in which things are not quite clear will be able to identify with him, and Scott never lets the character get ahead of where he's supposed to be, as far as what he could possibly know and when, and it adds credibility to the fact that a con like this can be perpetrated at all.  If Scott didn't do his job, it would be like having a crack in the dam, and the water would quickly come gushing out.  But he does do his job, and it keeps the tension and the mystery in tact until the very end.In a dramatic role, Steve Martin is effective playing somewhat against type in the role of Jimmy.  He's convincing, and displays an aloofness that makes everything he does believable and, like Scott, he never tips his character's hand or does anything to reveal any more than he should.  The winsome Rebecca Pidgeon gives an absolutely enticing performance as Susan Ricci, the ""new girl"" with the company who befriends Joe and gives him the encouragement he needs as he attempts to make some sense of all that is happening.  Pidgeon has an extremely direct approach and employs Mamet's style of acting perfectly (few actors have been able to utilize that rhythm more effectively, in fact; Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy and Lindsay Crouse among them), and she has a quality that draws your attention, no matter who else may be in the scene with her.  Arguably, it is her performance that defines the realism of Mamet's world.The supporting cast includes Ricky Jay (George), Felicity Huffman (Pat McCune), Ed O'Neill (F.B.I. Team Leader), Paul Butler (Bookbinder) and J.J. Johnston (Doorman).  With a cryptic title taken from one of the oldest con games on the books, ""The Spanish Prisoner"" is riveting drama that will keep you guessing until the very end.  But be forewarned; like ""Enemy of the State,"" this film has the ability to induce paranoia.  It may make you take a closer look at your co-workers and neighbors, and if you don't already have a caller ID on your telephone, you'll probably want to get one, and soon.  Such is the impact a film like this can have, and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.",5,"Once Again, the Con is On",996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,5500,"['When', 'meet', 'stranger', 'first',

The plot itself was easily predictable and it was obvious where it  was headed.&quot; &quot;From Campbell Scott's irritating stupidity to the  aggravatingly sappy writing to the inane story, this film is void of any  positives whatsoever.&quot; &quot;The acting was flat with lines that are  often cliched.
