1066946,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000OYAT3U,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[0, 0]","BREACH is thrilling even if you know the outcome. Actually knowing the outcome makes it at times more tense and interesting. Waiting for the inevitable can have more an effect than not knowing what's coming. Basically this is one of those rare true life stories that is as weird, if not weirder than Hollywood could make up. FBI agent Robert Hanseen sold government secrets to the Russians for 20 years, making him the biggest traitor in all of U.S. history. Chris Cooper is one of the finest actors working today. Of Robert Hanseen Cooper says he is the most contradicted character he has ever played. After seeing the film you can understand where Cooper is coming from. You might feel Hanseen is the most contradicted person you ever heard of. Robert Hanseen was an ultra-conservative and like many conservative types seemed to be talking out one side of his head while going off and acting in ways that, well,  don't quite fit with his professed belief system. To say the least. The DVD includes some useful bonus material.

Young agent aspirant, Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) proves to be the kind of wunderkind his agency needs to do some in-house spying.  At first he finds his mission nearly impossible, but his target is near-retiree curmudgeon Robert Hanssen (played with finesse by stock jerk-villain actor Chris Cooper, who here shows greater spectrum).  He is prompted by his stridently clinical supervisor (Laura Linney in a starchly cool performance) who tells a story that seems to belie the facts.  Relying on poker-face strategies, all players sort out mutual duplicity until the facts are revealed.  In the meantime, like many spy dramas of late, the protagonist must balance his ambition with the love of his life.Fascinating, this nail-biting drama is all the more tangible for being real.  The hypnotic score gives a proper old-fashioned element that works so well in this thriller.

What can Eric O'Neill learn about Robert Hanssen, the highly skilled expert on Soviet Espionage? Is he as moral as his desk ornaments suggest? He belongs to the same church as Director Freeh. Top management in the FBI comes from the law enforcement side, not desk analysts. [Practical experience?] There are some humorous scenes in this serious drama. Their retirement age is 57; Hanssen will have 25 years of service. The meetings are at night in a public place, just like in novels. They finally tell Eric the truth about Hanssen - he likes strippers!For years they could never find the suspected mole who was responsible for assets that disappeared. Finally they figured out the reason why [after paying millions to get the name of Ramon]. We see how a ruse is used to get Hanssen out of his office so his SD micro card can be copied. [Wouldn't a regular computer operate much faster?] We see a ""power play"" where a meeting is scheduled only to be canceled. We see how a traffic jam is created on a highway in order to delay a suspect. And a lie is hidden by a truth. They know how to open mail without leaving a trace. [Fingerprints on a VHS cassette?] Bugs in a car create static on the radio, or set off car alarms. Agent Eric wants one more try to get Hanssen to make his drop. ""Can I trust you?""Does the stress on Hanssen cause him to act strange? [Or is it guilt?] There is a dramatic scene in a park. [Washington DC is not a gun-free zone.] This seems to give confidence to Hanssen so he will make another drop of secret information. But this time he is captured. ""Maybe now you'll listen."" [What could he be thinking?] ""Pray for me"" seems ironic.There seem to be as many locks on the doors in Washington DC as an apartment in New York city. Eric brought down ""the worst spy in American history"". [Really? What about Benedict Arnold?] Hanssen got paid for revealing sources on the other side. Didn't he realize it was only a matter of time before someone on the other side got paid the same way? Why did Eric quit the FBI? Having a wife born in a foreign country would handicap him [in my opinion].This is an interesting film but it doesn't seem as good as ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" or ""The House on 92nd Street"".",3,The Capture of a Top Spy,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2351,"['young', 'FBI', 'agent', 'given', 'new', 'assignment', 'spy', 'top', 'FBI', 'manager', 'unusual', 'sexual', 'hobby', 'Internet', 'What', 'can', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'learn', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'highly', 'skilled', 'expert', 'Soviet', 'Espionage', 'as', 'moral', 'desk', 'ornaments', 'suggest', 'same', 'church', 'Director', 'Freeh', 'Top', 'management', 'FBI', 'law', 'enforcement', 'side', 'not', 'desk', 'analysts', '[', 'Practical', 'experience', ']', 'are', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'serious', 'drama', 'retirement', 'age', '57', 'Hanssen', 'will', 'have', '25', 'years', 'service', 'meetings', 'are', 'night', 'public', 'place', 'just', 'novels', 'finally', 'tell', 'Eric', 'truth', 'Hanssen', 'strippers', 'years', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'suspected', 'mole', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'assets', 'disappeared', 'Finally', 'figured', 'out', 'reason', 'why', '[', 'paying', 'millions', 'get', 'name', 'Ramon', ']', 'see', 'how', 'ruse', 'used', 'get', 'Hanssen', 'office', 'so', 'SD', 'micro', 'card', 'can', 'be', 'copied', '[', 'Would', ""n't"", 'regular', 'computer', 'operate', 'much', 'faster', ']', 'see', 'power', 'play', 'where', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'only', 'be', 'canceled', 'see', 'how', 'traffic', 'jam', 'created', 'highway', 'order', 'delay', 'suspect', 'lie', 'hidden', 'truth', 'know', 'how', 'open', 'mail', 'leaving', 'trace', '[', 'Fingerprints', 'VHS', 'cassette', ']', 'Bugs', 'car', 'create', 'static', 'radio', 'set', 'off', 'car', 'alarms', 'Agent', 'Eric', 'one', 'more', 'try', 'get', 'Hanssen', 'make', 'drop', 'Can', 'trust', 'stress', 'Hanssen', 'cause', 'act', 'strange', '[', 'guilt', ']', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'park', 'Washington', 'DC', 'not', 'gun-free', 'zone', ']', 'give', 'confidence', 'Hanssen', 'will', 'make', 'drop', 'secret', 'information', 'time', 'captured', 'Maybe', 'now', ""'ll"", 'listen', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'thinking', ']', 'Pray', 'ironic.There', 'seem', 'be', 'many', 'locks', 'doors', 'Washington', 'DC', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Eric', 'brought', 'down', 'worst', 'spy', 'American', 'history', '[', 'Really', 'What', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', ']', 'Hanssen', 'got', 'paid', 'revealing', 'sources', 'other', 'side', 'Did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'someone', 'other', 'side', 'got', 'paid', 'same', 'way', 'Why', 'did', 'Eric', 'quit', 'FBI', 'Having', 'wife', 'born', 'foreign', 'country', 'would', 'handicap', '[', 'opinion', '.This', 'interesting', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'good', 'Confessions', 'Nazi', 'Spy', 'House', '92nd', 'Street']",N/A

1066954,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000OYAT3U,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`Breach' is a fantastic film that took me by surprise; for I never expecting it to hit all the marks it did.  I saw the trailer and expected it to be an average government thriller, but what I got was an above average thriller than not only delivered chills (I was on edge throughout this entire film) but it also delivered the right mixture of drama and justice.  It is a thought provoking moral driven film that masters its genre quite easily.  Thanks to tight scripting and excellent acting the film is further elevated into pristine territory.The film, based on a true story, recounts the greatest security breach in US history, one made by a certain Robert Hanssen.  You Eric O'Neill, trying desperately to make agent, is handed a job monitoring Hanssen, under the premise that he is being investigated for his questionable extracurricular activities.  Eric is a little put off by his new job, especially once he gets to know Hanssen and begins to feel that the investigation is a little unfair; and then he learns the truth behind what he's really after and things begin to change.  Hanssen is much smarter than the rest of them and this makes O'Neill uneasy, for he's young and inexperienced, but he has one thing on his side; Hanssen trusts him.The film is expertly woven, truly, for it never loses the audience for a single moment.  The script brilliantly plays scene off scene, actor off actor, and weaves a very believable and understandable film.  I was never lost, wondering what was going on, yet the film is never too simple, never dumbed down for the audience.  It is smart and interesting and impeccably crafted.The acting is another highlight.  Chris Cooper is phenomenal as Hanssen, slipping beneath the man's skin and fleshing out his inner demons.  Hanssen has a gruff exterior, but his heart is not as cold as he depicts, and this is seen as he attempts to befriend O'Neill.  I never thought that Ryan Phillippe would be able to hold his own aside Cooper or Linney or even Haysbert, but he does.  I've liked Phillippe (I adored him in `Cruel Intentions') but for the most part I never saw him as an overly strong actor.  Here he holds his own and demands our attention.  The way he displays his characters panic while restraining it to mainly his eyes and a few well placed twitches is astonishing.  I kept looking at my wife going `he is really pulling this off'.  Linney is fine, although she's been better and her character is a little clich&eacute;d (my wife asked me a few times if people really talk like that).  Haysbert doesn't have a lot to do, but he is always commanding.The film belongs to Cooper and Phillippe, and they support each frame masterfully.If you are looking for an absorbing thriller that will leave you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end then `Breach' is the film you are looking for.  Even if you already know the end (which they share with you at the very beginning) the film will never cease to grab you.  The acting is impeccable, the script is spot on and the direction is tight enough to keep the action heavy and our interest unwavering.",5,"Tightly woven, briskly paced and utterly absorbing...",1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3104,"['Breach', 'fantastic', 'film', 'took', 'surprise', 'never', 'expecting', 'hit', 'marks', 'did', 'saw', 'trailer', 'expected', 'be', 'average', 'government', 'thriller', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'thriller', 'not', 'only', 'delivered', 'chills', 'was', 'edge', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'delivered', 'right', 'mixture', 'drama', 'justice', 'thought', 'provoking', 'moral', 'driven', 'film', 'genre', 'quite', 'easily', 'Thanks', 'tight', 'scripting', 'excellent', 'acting', 'film', 'further', 'elevated', 'pristine', 'territory.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'greatest', 'security', 'breach', 'US', 'history', 'one', 'made', 'certain', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'trying', 'desperately', 'make', 'agent', 'handed', 'job', 'monitoring', 'Hanssen', 'premise', 'being', 'investigated', 'questionable', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'Eric', 'little', 'put', 'off', 'new', 'job', 'especially', 'once', 'know', 'Hanssen', 'feel', 'investigation', 'little', 'unfair', 'then', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'Hanssen', 'much', 'smarter', 'rest', ""O'Neill"", 'uneasy', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'one', 'thing', 'side', 'Hanssen', 'him.The', 'film', 'expertly', 'woven', 'truly', 'never', 'audience', 'single', 'moment', 'script', 'brilliantly', 'scene', 'scene', 'actor', 'actor', 'very', 'believable', 'understandable', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'lost', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'simple', 'never', 'dumbed', 'down', 'audience', 'smart', 'interesting', 'impeccably', 'crafted.The', 'acting', 'highlight', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'phenomenal', 'Hanssen', 'slipping', 'man', 'skin', 'fleshing', 'out', 'inner', 'demons', 'Hanssen', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'heart', 'not', 'as', 'cold', 'seen', 'befriend', ""O'Neill"", 'never', 'thought', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'aside', 'Cooper', 'Linney', 'even', 'Haysbert', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Phillippe', 'adored', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'most', 'part', 'never', 'saw', 'overly', 'strong', 'actor', 'Here', 'own', 'attention', 'way', 'characters', 'panic', 'restraining', 'mainly', 'eyes', 'few', 'well', 'placed', 'twitches', 'astonishing', 'kept', 'looking', 'wife', 'going', 'really', 'pulling', 'off', 'Linney', 'fine', 'been', 'better', 'character', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'wife', 'asked', 'few', 'times', 'people', 'really', 'talk', 'Haysbert', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'always', 'commanding.The', 'film', 'belongs', 'Cooper', 'Phillippe', 'support', 'frame', 'masterfully.If', 'are', 'looking', 'absorbing', 'thriller', 'will', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat', 'beginning', 'end', 'then', 'Breach', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'Even', 'already', 'know', 'end', 'share', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'cease', 'grab', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'script', 'spot', 'direction', 'tight', 'enough', 'keep', 'action', 'heavy', 'interest', 'unwavering']",N/A

They don't listen to you, unless they need your expertise, which most of them don't understand and could never equal.  You're an obsessively devout Catholic with a penchant for porn and strippers.  The fools around you cannot see the smirk behind your stern grimace.  Friends who know you, don't know you.  Neither does your wife and family. None of them could imagine you're a traitor.  The idiots had even tasked you to catch yourself.  They couldn't imagine the secret thrill you get by betraying the very institutions you supposedly uphold.  You are an enigma to them, and perhaps even to yourself.Was this Robert Hannsen? Or not. The great question, finally unanswered and probably unanswerable is the massive ""WHY?"" of the FBI's Robert Hannsen's vile treachery. He volunteered himself to the Soviets, very carefully keeping his identity secret from them.  He divulged vast amounts of information, some of it causing the deaths of others.  He was so meticulous in protecting his surreptitious avocation that he went undetected for 22 years!  He took money, but it appears money wasn't his real motivation.  Who the hell was Robert Hanssen?This interesting film cannot explain him.  I doubt any one explanation would be sufficient.  It presents several clues, but doesn't settle on any one.  Okay with me, as I hate easy explanations.  Instead we get a fine Chris Cooper portrait of a man so compartmentalized that there are too many strange doors into strange rooms in his psyche.  Conflicted to say the least, Hannsen is a strange cat, and Chris Cooper's subtle shadings of performance bring us this enigma of a person to life.Hanssen is seen by us through the eyes of John O'Neill, a young man yearning to be an agent, and assigned to watch Hannsen, while ostensibly assisting him.  We share his perplexity at dealing with this brilliant and complicated man.  O'Neill's FBI handlers, most notably a tough female agent, do not initially divulge their real interest in Hannsen.  O'Neill has conflicting attitudes toward both his ""boss"" Hannsen, and his assignment.

While a special agent in the intelligence division of the FBI, Hanssen sold out his country and caused the death of key American agents in the Soviet Union. This movie attempts to answer the question of why he did it, while thrilling us with the story of how he was caught.Hanssen is a complicated man: a religious, ""Opus Dei"" Catholic and a pornographer who sends abroad movies of his sexual relations with his wife; a right-wing conservative who spies for the Soviets; a loving grandfather who overreacts to minor slights; a paranoid who wound up trusting the one man sent to make the case against him. Although ""Breach"" does not really explain Hanssen's motivation, it appears that Hanssen had no small measure of resentment against the FBI for failing to recognize his talents and promote him to the position he believed he deserved.  Chris Cooper captures Hanssen in a five-star performance that should win an Academy Award.Laura Linney is also outstanding as the Special Agent in charge of the investigation of Hanssen.  The nerve-wracking investigation, full of twists, turns and near-misses, demands total commitment.  For once, we get to see a realistic career woman, totally dedicated to her demanding job, and not messing up or falling in love with any of the other characters in the movie.If you are trying to choose between ""Breach"" and ""The Good Shepherd"" (a fictionalized story of the founding of the CIA), choose ""Breach.""

Indeed, one character laments that Robert Hansen had basically reduced the FBI counter intelligence to less than worthless during this period.Basically, I sort of liked this movie. It was short, very short considering the important material that was covered. Also, had the music and mood been played a little different, it would have been like ""The Sting"", the landmark movie about a con. Basically, that is what's going on here; Hansen is conning the FBI and the FBI is conning Hansen into believing they are too stupid to know what's going on. Hansen nearly wins; he is only betrayed by a Russian agent known to a hand full of FBI agents.The trouble is the movie drags. Chris Cooper does a good job of playing Hansen but not a great job. Cooper does not convince us of Hansen's duplicity in ""Breach"" like Cooper did while as the CIA's director of the Treadstone project in the very excellent movie ""The Borne Identity"". There just isn't that much to work with. At heart Hansen is just a spoilt bureaucrat who works for the Russians to ""make a difference"".Honestly, I thought Laura Linny gave the best performance of the movie. She honestly comes across as a scheming FBI insider who is merely out to manufacture some bogus charge against an FBI programming wonk, Hansen. However, later in the movie when Linny has to brief Phillippe that Hansen is a spy, it's when we see her character change. Linny goes from being a hard nosed career climber to merely an out-foxed bureaucrat who knows she's been beat; her life of hard work and near celibacy in service to the nation was in vain.This movie actually makes one wonder about the days when Edgar J. Hoover ran the FBI with an Iron Fist. While agents played by Linny are wonderful people, what's the good with an agency that's plain out foxed by a corrupt and greedy bureaucrat?But the movie could have been a little tighter and a tad longer.

I think this movie is worth watching one time when you have nothing better to do but other than that it really is not very dramatic.  Too much time spent on the Catholicism and such when that really has very little if anything to do with an agency that has a traitor in the midst.  I find some other reviews quite funny, I see these peoples waltzing in claiming to be former spies, former FBI and CIA agents, really c'mon now let's not get carried away with trips to fantasy land.  I know it is easy to act like you are someone else on the internet but if I had a nickel for every time someone claimed to be something they were not I would be one rich lady.  Perhaps what is really troubling to me are the people saying that Hanssen was doing this to show that there was an issue with security.  Some may stand back and think oh yeah this guy he is taking the high road here, but that is not true.  When someone jeopardizes national security and puts many lives at great risk the way he did I do not think that mentality pans out.  2 wrongs do not make a right, as they say.  Other people worked with the system to get it changed and in the process did not put lives at risk, so why would Hanssen's actions be looked at as the good guy who became a goat?  He got what he deserved; he belongs in Supermax with the rest of his kind.",3,The traitor,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,2017,"['Breach', 'Breach', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'Well', 'not', 'one', 'scary', 'bourne', 'identity', 'type', 'films', 'bourne', 'was', 'fiction', 'something', 'based', 'true', 'accounts', 'What', 'really', 'show', 'how', 'typically', 'inept', 'own', 'government', 'agencies', 'are', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'now', 'took', 'what', '22', 'years', 'catch', 'guy', 'Someone', 'convenience', 'store', 'can', 'catch', 'someone', 'stealing', 'till', 'FBI', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'narrow', 'down', 'who', 'leaking', 'info', 'pretty', 'scary', 'considering', 'technology', 'intelligence', 'have', 'disposal.The', 'guy', 'assigned', 'shadow', 'Hanssen', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'other', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'dramatic', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Catholicism', 'such', 'when', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'anything', 'do', 'agency', 'traitor', 'midst', 'find', 'other', 'reviews', 'quite', 'funny', 'see', 'peoples', 'waltzing', 'claiming', 'be', 'former', 'spies', 'former', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'agents', 'really', ""c'mon"", 'now', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'trips', 'fantasy', 'land', 'know', 'easy', 'act', 'are', 'someone', 'else', 'internet', 'had', 'nickel', 'time', 'someone', 'claimed', 'be', 'something', 'were', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'rich', 'lady', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'really', 'troubling', 'are', 'people', 'saying', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'doing', 'show', 'was', 'issue', 'security', 'may', 'stand', 'back', 'think', 'oh', 'yeah', 'guy', 'taking', 'high', 'road', 'here', 'not', 'true', 'When', 'someone', 'national', 'security', 'many', 'lives', 'great', 'risk', 'way', 'did', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'mentality', 'out', '2', 'wrongs', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'right', 'say', 'Other', 'people', 'worked', 'system', 'get', 'changed', 'process', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'lives', 'risk', 'why', 'would', 'Hanssen', 'actions', 'be', 'looked', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'became', 'goat', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'Supermax', 'rest', 'kind']",N/A

1066972,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000OYAT3U,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","Well this is certainly an excellent film. The script is smart and requires constant attention. The acting is superb. The narrative and editing are fast paced and yet the viewer does not get lost.  The story is compelling, complex, and frightening. Even with all these positive qualities, the film leaves the viewer with one unresolved issue, and that is to fully understand the motives behind FBI agent Robert Hanssen's 20 years of spying for the Soviet Union while nestled in the center of the FBI.Chris Cooper is always superb. He is one of the finest actors in films. He is absolute great in this film. The other actors are excellent also but Cooper's performance was over and beyond excellent. He fully captured the psychological construction of a highly conflicted and brilliant man. Laura Linney is cool and professional in her search for the evidence against Hanssen. Ryan Phillippe, who plays young FBI clerk Eric O'Neill, does not often show emotion on his face or in his tone, but in some ways this allows him to play the 'everyman' type of guy with whom most guys would identify.There is considerable wisdom in not over explaining, of allowing conjecture, of leaving lose ends for the audience to tie together. This is the case in this film where motive remains only partly revealed, partially exposed, and never resolved or packaged for the viewer.Robert Hanssen was a conservative, Opus Dei Catholic, who engaged in sexual perversions. This fact alone allows us to see that the man contains conflicting emotional forces that are not resolved. But why would he become a traitor for 20 years, resulting in the deaths of many agents and loss of national security?  There is a hint that he wished to show the US how vulnerable we really are. But why did it go on for 20 years?  There is also considerable resentment and hostility toward authority and FBI management shown by Agent Hanssen. Was he so anti-authoritarian that he secretly wished to undermine the FBI leadership?  There is resentment and sarcasm about federal policies and procedures, but every federal employee is subject to these procedures and endures them to get their work done. Was it that FBI leadership failed to recognize how smart he was, to offer him praise and recognition for his analytical abilities? This seems to me to be one of the best partial explanations. He was indeed a smart man, but even the most brilliant man can not expect constant support and praise from supervisors and leaders. The lack of constant praise, recognition, and verbal reinforcement is punishment for some personalities without a centered stable core self concept. Hanssen had strict rules for himself and family but strict rules maintained obsessively is actually about control of impulses and negative feelings more so than about organizational skills and high morality. The person with a strong sense of self is able to give themselves recognition and reward when they feel their advice has been ignored by leadership or they feel they are not appreciated. A person with a strong sense of self has the ability to empathize and realize there are lots of smart folks in federal jobs and no one gets constantly reinforced. Instead a healthy attitude is that bright employees have to take turns in the spotlight. Hanssen was vulnerable because he lacked this strong center. He was smart and organized but he was far from self-actualized, thus making him very vulnerable under pressure.",4,Motive remains the mystery,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,3448,"['Well', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'film', 'script', 'smart', 'constant', 'attention', 'acting', 'superb', 'narrative', 'editing', 'are', 'fast', 'paced', 'yet', 'viewer', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'story', 'compelling', 'complex', 'frightening', 'Even', 'positive', 'qualities', 'film', 'viewer', 'one', 'unresolved', 'issue', 'fully', 'understand', 'motives', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', '20', 'years', 'spying', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'nestled', 'center', 'FBI.Chris', 'Cooper', 'always', 'superb', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'films', 'absolute', 'great', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'also', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'was', 'over', 'excellent', 'fully', 'captured', 'psychological', 'construction', 'highly', 'conflicted', 'brilliant', 'man', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'cool', 'professional', 'search', 'evidence', 'Hanssen', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'who', 'young', 'FBI', 'clerk', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'not', 'often', 'show', 'emotion', 'face', 'tone', 'ways', 'play', ""'everyman"", 'type', 'guy', 'whom', 'most', 'guys', 'would', 'identify.There', 'considerable', 'wisdom', 'not', 'explaining', 'allowing', 'conjecture', 'leaving', 'lose', 'ends', 'audience', 'tie', 'together', 'case', 'film', 'where', 'motive', 'only', 'partly', 'revealed', 'partially', 'exposed', 'never', 'resolved', 'packaged', 'viewer.Robert', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'conservative', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Catholic', 'who', 'engaged', 'sexual', 'perversions', 'fact', 'alone', 'see', 'man', 'conflicting', 'emotional', 'forces', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'why', 'would', 'become', 'traitor', '20', 'years', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'many', 'agents', 'loss', 'national', 'security', 'hint', 'wished', 'show', 'US', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'really', 'are', 'why', 'did', 'go', '20', 'years', 'also', 'considerable', 'resentment', 'hostility', 'authority', 'FBI', 'management', 'shown', 'Agent', 'Hanssen', 'Was', 'so', 'anti-authoritarian', 'secretly', 'wished', 'undermine', 'FBI', 'leadership', 'resentment', 'sarcasm', 'federal', 'policies', 'procedures', 'federal', 'employee', 'subject', 'procedures', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'Was', 'FBI', 'leadership', 'failed', 'recognize', 'how', 'smart', 'was', 'offer', 'praise', 'recognition', 'analytical', 'abilities', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'partial', 'explanations', 'was', 'indeed', 'smart', 'man', 'even', 'most', 'brilliant', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'constant', 'support', 'praise', 'supervisors', 'leaders', 'lack', 'constant', 'praise', 'recognition', 'verbal', 'reinforcement', 'punishment', 'personalities', 'centered', 'stable', 'core', 'self', 'concept', 'Hanssen', 'had', 'strict', 'rules', 'family', 'strict', 'rules', 'maintained', 'obsessively', 'actually', 'control', 'impulses', 'negative', 'feelings', 'more', 'so', 'organizational', 'skills', 'high', 'morality', 'person', 'strong', 'sense', 'self', 'able', 'give', 'recognition', 'reward', 'when', 'feel', 'advice', 'been', 'ignored', 'leadership', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'appreciated', 'person', 'strong', 'sense', 'self', 'ability', 'empathize', 'realize', 'are', 'lots', 'smart', 'folks', 'federal', 'jobs', 'one', 'constantly', 'reinforced', 'Instead', 'healthy', 'attitude', 'bright', 'employees', 'have', 'take', 'turns', 'spotlight', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'vulnerable', 'lacked', 'strong', 'center', 'was', 'smart', 'organized', 'was', 'far', 'self-actualized', 'thus', 'making', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'pressure']",N/A
1066973,A3SFPAKTI4GBYD,B000OYAT3U,"Charles M. Corden ""Book lover extraordinaire""","[15, 17]","I found Breach to be a fair film, filled with the typical cliches of the genre. Chris Cooper who plays Hansson does a credible job---not great---but credible. He, at times, overplays his hand but he is still heads and shoulders better than Phillippe and the actors who play the two wives. I used the word cliches meaning that I could guess at the start of the film that Eric O'Neill was going to have marital problems with his East German wife and that there were going to be very ""close"" calls for O'Neill in his undercover role and that Hansson's Catholicism would be constantly viewed with the biased eye that Hollywood uses with anything Christian. I understand that these have to be included for dramatic effect. As was the compression of many characters involved in the effort to trap Hansson into the character of O'Neill.But what is the missing element which, for me, was the most important part of this whole tragic story?  For a long time, an employee of the CIA was suspected of being the mole. This person was Brian Kelly who was a military officer in Japan and later joined the CIA. For a while he was the CIA station chief in Panama. I know Brian, having grown up across the street from him in Waterbury, CT. Actually, he was two or three years younger than me. Later, I taught with one of his sisters. His mother was my mother's best friend.The story of his life while he was considered to be the mole has been documented by the CBS newsmagazine, 60 Minutes. He was suspended and questioned and not only was he interrogated but also his two sisters. The strange part of this tale is that after being treated like dirt by the CIA, he returned to the company.  Why did he do so? This fact makes the story intriguing. One theory I have is that Brian was a ""strawman""; that is, the investigation was centered on him in order to remove any suspicion from Hansson that he was the target.To me, this story is much more interesting and much more dramatic than a novice FBI employee (he was not an agent) who went undercover and suffered predictable marital woes.I generously give this film three stars.",3,An important missing element,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2109,"['found', 'Breach', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'filled', 'typical', 'cliches', 'genre', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Hansson', 'credible', 'job', '-not', 'great', '-but', 'credible', 'times', 'hand', 'still', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'better', 'Phillippe', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'two', 'wives', 'used', 'word', 'meaning', 'could', 'guess', 'start', 'film', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'was', 'going', 'have', 'marital', 'problems', 'East', 'German', 'wife', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'close', ""O'Neill"", 'undercover', 'role', 'Hansson', 'Catholicism', 'would', 'be', 'constantly', 'viewed', 'biased', 'eye', 'Hollywood', 'anything', 'Christian', 'understand', 'have', 'be', 'included', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'was', 'compression', 'many', 'characters', 'involved', 'effort', 'trap', 'Hansson', 'character', ""O'Neill.But"", 'what', 'missing', 'element', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'whole', 'tragic', 'story', 'long', 'time', 'employee', 'CIA', 'was', 'suspected', 'being', 'mole', 'person', 'was', 'Brian', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', 'military', 'officer', 'Japan', 'later', 'joined', 'CIA', 'while', 'was', 'CIA', 'station', 'chief', 'Panama', 'know', 'Brian', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'street', 'Waterbury', 'CT.', 'Actually', 'was', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'younger', 'Later', 'taught', 'one', 'sisters', 'mother', 'was', 'mother', 'best', 'friend.The', 'story', 'life', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'mole', 'been', 'documented', 'CBS', 'newsmagazine', '60', 'Minutes', 'was', 'suspended', 'questioned', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'interrogated', 'also', 'two', 'sisters', 'strange', 'part', 'tale', 'being', 'treated', 'dirt', 'CIA', 'returned', 'company', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'so', 'fact', 'story', 'intriguing', 'One', 'theory', 'have', 'Brian', 'was', 'strawman', 'investigation', 'was', 'centered', 'order', 'remove', 'suspicion', 'Hansson', 'was', 'target.To', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'novice', 'FBI', 'employee', 'was', 'not', 'agent', 'who', 'went', 'undercover', 'suffered', 'predictable', 'marital', 'woes.I', 'generously', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

If you're the FBI, you don't follow up on tips about the guy, you don't get curious that his expensive life style doesn't match his FBI salary, you ignore his extensive, private hetero kinkiness even though a murmur about homosexuality would get another person booted out the door, and you sure don't want to look too hard and then find a scandal on your hands like the CIA's Aldrich Ames.It was in 1979, three years after he joined the FBI, that Robert Hanssen started his career as a spy. It wasn't until 1999 that it occurred to the FBI to look closely at Hanssen. At one point, concerned about the possibility of a mole in their midst, the FBI actually had Hanssen investigating any possible moles within the FBI.Don't look for FBI culpability in Breach. The movie barely alludes to all this, yet this is the real story of Robert Hanssen. What we have, instead, is a genuinely fascinating story of the final hunt to nail Hanssen, the hunt for evidence that would stand up in court. To get that evidence the FBI, finally on the job, sends in Eric O'Neill, a young man without much experience to be Hanssen's gofer. The hope is that Hanssen will not see this fellow as a threat and may let down his guard. If the FBI is going to nail Hanssen, they need to catch him in the act of sending classified information to the Russians. Without this, the best they can do is fire him. It's no spoiler to say that Robert Hanssen was arrested in 2001 and is now serving a life sentence in a high security prison, restricted to solitary confinement 23 hours a day. Eric O'Neill did his job.That outstanding actor, Chris Cooper, plays Hanssen. It's a magnificent performance, stuffed full with intelligence, arrogance, suspicion, threat and conflict. Hanssen is not a likeable guy, but he's shrewd and smart. The contest between Hanssen's deep suspicions toward anyone and Eric O'Neill's odd combination of apparent naivety and resourceful quick thinking keeps the movie, for the most part, speeding right along. The one real weakness is Laura Linney as O'Neill's boss. It's an unnecessary part and just seems to sit there as a way to feature a star name who can be used now and then for some plot exposition. As much as I like Linney, every time she's on screen I'm reminded that I'm watching a Hollywood movie. That goes for some of the secondary parts, too. The movie needed faces we'd never seen before, except for Cooper. Instead there are too many vaguely familiar Hollywood faces, such as Gary Cole, Dennis Haysbert, and Kathleen Quinlan. They all do good jobs, but their familiarity is distracting.Ryan Phillippe as Eric O'Neill gives a first-class, nuanced performance. O'Neill is not thrilled with what he's called upon to do. He can't tell anyone, including his wife, and she's not happy with his long and erratic hours. It's a dangerous, high stress job and the man he's trying to catch is no dummy. Phillippe holds his own with Cooper. It's unfortunate that he has one of those youngish, generically handsome faces. He's a good actor, and I think his looks get in the way of critical appreciation of his skills. The movie stands or falls on the actor who plays Hanssen. Chris Cooper is so good and so believable it's a pleasure to sit back and lose yourself in his performance. He's been memorable is so many movies, but one of his best performances (and a favorite of mine) is inLone Star.",4,"Your FBI at work, and after only 20 years of traitorous leaks, they bust the case.

Ad...","[1, 1]","If you are looking for a movie that has lots of sex or violence, pass on this.If you want a movie about a real person- about fairly current history- about our govt agencies- about intrigue/espionage and the matter of TRUTH that provokes questions- this is the movie for you.This is a movie about a real person. Maybe some people were not paying close attention in 2001 when Hannsen was arrested.Now is your chance to find out why this was such a big deal.While not exactly a biopic( it only focuses intensely on approx 3 months of this character's life- but they prove to be critical months)you still become engaged in getting to know, or trying to know, what made Robert Hannsen tick.Just when you think he is done being enigmatic- you realize he remains a mystery on many levels. Can anyone figure this guy out?In the end, you still may not be sure what makes him tick, but what you will come away with, is how his brilliance allowed him to get away with his crimes,for so long.You end up viewing Hannsen as both an appalling and fascinating individual.(There is no doubt the man is slick- and a  bit of an oddball as well.)While watching you may find it embarrassing that our govt had the wool pulled over their eyes for so long.Hence, it is that realization that causes viewers to wonder about our govt intelligence, how strong it really is and the security of such.Of course, there are those of us who cannot help wonder, if this story we are watching unfold, is  THE TRUTH or if the govt needed a fall guy.Truth can be so much stranger than fiction.There are only a handful of people who truly know if this  man is really guilty- the rest of the nation swallows what the mass media( controlled by the govt) tells us is *truth*.This movie( according to Wikipedia's review) is for the most part- highly accurate when compared to the supposed events that happened in real life vs what is shown in the movie.Only a few  scenes in the movie did not happen or happened in a slightly different manner.Nonetheless, those scenes and the fact that they are fictional, don't alter the story- or even the so called TRUTH, one iota.There is much to reflect on as you watch the story unfold.You end up not just questioning the content of character of a man named  Robert Hannsen- but the integrity of our govt's multiple intelligence organizations and covert operations, how secure they really are since Hannsen's arrest and lastly, the disturbing question of, who exactly is working within them?Friend or foe?You wonder based on the comments he makes through out the movie, how Robert Hannsen thinks about life- or wants you to think, he thinks about life.When he speaks he comes across as a rebel, anti-bureacratic, resentful of the things that most workers aspire to. Simple things, like a corner office with a window.He sees it all as so petty. He feels his work as having far more importance than to be concerned with acquiring a corner office with a window view.You are left for a moment believing his sentiments- and then later questioning them. Is this how he really feels- or is this how he wants you to think he feels?While the movie is one of intrigue, it is  subtle as it moves along.It becomes a  mind game for those characters in it and the viewer, as well.While the ending is not a disappointment, if you were hoping to understand why someone would be a traitor to his country, Hanssen offers up many reasons why a person would do so- and by him doing so, he seems to also offer up nothing in particular.Ever hear someone give an answer that if you analyze it- was not really an answer?  This is what the viewer is left with: more questions.It would seem that every  traitorous spy has their own reason(s) for what they do- why they stoop so low as to work against their country: for money, revenge, ego, to reasons known only to them.I liked the pace of the movie. Not rushed- not slow.It is more akin to slowly unpeeling an onion and seeing the layers of the story unfold; as well as the layers of Hannsen's complex character revealed and then left to be dissected,  by both the viewer and those involved in the storyline;characters who think they know him, but what they really only  know is that which is obvious, not what is hidden deep inside the man.In the end, if you never knew much about the biggest USA spy/traitor in history, you may feel prompted to read up on this man who is serving  life in prison, with 23 hrs of solitary confinement.If there seems like there is a spoiler in my writing, there really isn't.Not for any American that knew about this man's arrest in 2001.In fact, the movie opens with a tv broadcast of Ashcroft announcing the arrest of Hannsen and the movie takes off from there, going backward in time, a mere 3 months.There is one thing that can be said with certainty: You don't get to pull off what Hannsen did, by being a  loyal, by the book, Fed.You have to be cocky, with no respect for rules, ruthless, disloyal to your country, and brilliant.He was all that.  Too bad that brilliance did not end up helping the USA.",4,Great Movie- Pulls you in within the first 5 minutes.,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,5064,"['are', 'looking', 'movie', 'lots', 'sex',

Of course, the brutal irony of that statement is that Mr. Hanssen was indeed one of the ""anyones"" our enemies chose to work with.  In fact, by that time Robert Hanssen had inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on the US and cost the lives of three agents.O'Neill (solidly played by Ryan Phillippe) is assigned to watch over Hanssen as a task force tries to bear down on the double agent in their midst.Since early on it's been established that Hanssen is so smart, and has the self-professed ability to read people easily and tell if they're BS'ing, the tension that develops in their working relationship is exquisite.  Practically every moment that follows is awash in a doubt and paranoia as one wonders if O'Neill has been made.One of the things that works well in this film is the fact that both Hanssen and O'Neill are portrayed as having inferiority complexes of sorts and thus feel they have something to prove.  These underlying traits are what makes each of them do some fairly surprising things.The only unconvincing aspect of this movie is how quickly Phillippe's O'Neill transitions from uncertain rookie to ""I'll roll this guy"" uber-cockiness.  I wish they had shown that journey more, and how/why he gained such confidence in such a short time.Other than that, Cooper is terrific as Hanssen, Laura Linney does good work as tough agent Kate Borroughs, and the story is swiftly paced and deeply engaging, even if you know what's going to eventually happen.All in all, Breach is a terrific true-crime thriller, one that also has great historical significance.",4,"""Our Enemies Aren't Picky - They'll Work With Anyone""",1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,1691,"['Robert', 'Hanssen', 'speaking', 'clerk', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'super-suspenseful', 'true-life', 'thriller', 'Breach', 'course', 'brutal', 'irony', 'statement', 'Mr.', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'indeed', 'one', 'anyones', 'enemies', 'chose', 'work', 'fact', 'time', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'had', 'inflicted', 'billions', 'dollars', 'damage', 'US', 'cost', 'lives', 'three', ""agents.O'Neill"", 'solidly', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'assigned', 'watch', 'over', 'Hanssen', 'task', 'force', 'tries', 'bear', 'down', 'double', 'agent', 'midst.Since', 'early', 'been', 'established', 'Hanssen', 'so', 'smart', 'self-professed', 'ability', 'read', 'people', 'easily', 'tell', ""'re"", ""BS'ing"", 'tension', 'working', 'relationship', 'exquisite', 'Practically', 'moment', 'awash', 'doubt', 'paranoia', 'one', 'wonders', ""O'Neill"", 'been', 'made.One', 'things', 'well', 'film', 'fact', 'Hanssen', ""O'Neill"", 'are', 'portrayed', 'having', 'inferiority', 'complexes', 'sorts', 'thus', 'feel', 'have', 'something', 'prove', 'underlying', 'traits', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'fairly', 'surprising', 'things.The', 'only', 'unconvincing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'how', 'quickly', 'Phillippe', ""O'Neill"", 'transitions', 'uncertain', 'rookie', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'guy', 'uber-cockiness', 'wish', 'had', 'shown', 'journey', 'more', 'how/why', 'gained', 'such', 'confidence', 'such', 'short', 'time.Other', 'Cooper', 'terrific', 'Hanssen', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'good', 'work', 'tough', 'agent', 'Kate', 'Borroughs', 'story', 'swiftly', 'paced', 'deeply', 'engaging', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'eventually', 'happen.All', 'Breach', 'terrific', 'true-crime', 'thriller', 'one', 'also', 'great', 'historical', 'significance']",N/A
1066979,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000OYAT3U,Craig Connell,"[6, 6]","This was an interesting movie, and very well-acted. It had to be, because there was very little action and only a little suspense. Like the old Columbo"" television series, you knew who the crook was right away. What you didn't know was how the cops were going to catch him.In this case, the question was how the FBI was going to finally nab Robert Hanssen, the biggest spy in the history of the United States. He finally was caught in 2001 after about 15 years of giving tons of information to the Soviet Union.Exactly how much damage Hanssen did isn't public knowledge which hurts the film because you never get a real grasp of what a ""bad guy"" this man was and, hence, you don't feel as satisfied at the ending of the movie as you should. In fact, this film almost makes him look sympathetic at times. I fell into that trap myself a few times, in a way feeling sorry for this man, so well portrayed by actor Chris Cooper. If knew a little more of what harm this man did, there were no sympathy.Anyway, the acting is superb led by Cooper, of course, as Hanssen and ably supported by Ryan Phillippe as FBI clerk ""Eric O'Neill,"" who brought him down, and Laura Linney as FBI agent ""Kate Burroughs,"" who recruited O'Neill for the job. Those three along with Caroline Dehavemas, who plays Hanssen's wife, ""Julianna,"" are the main characters and dominate the film.This is a low-key film. Don't look for James Bond-spy-type action and humor. This is the gritty real thing. It's also another ""based on a true story"" movie so how much of this is true, I don't know. Only the key people involved know for sure. I could see they really wanted to emphasize Hanssen''s strong Catholic beliefs and, naturally being Hollywood, demonize the man for that.The first third of this film is primarily showing his strong feeling for the Catholic Church and disdain for those aren't are weak ones. The filmmakers subtly put in their agendas by making sure they portray Hanssen as against Liberal causes. The left-wing slants are normal for filmmakers so I ignored those and just enjoyed the excellent acting and interesting story. It's amazing Hanssen got away with what he did for so long. As he himself says at the end, he might have helped at least tighten up our own security by showing how many holes were in it. Hopefully, that has changed. It's equally as amazing that a young kid who wasn't even agent-status could bring this spy down.",4,"Amazing Story, Nicely Presented",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2422,"['was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'very', 'well-acted', 'had', 'be', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'only', 'little', 'suspense', 'old', 'Columbo', 'television', 'series', 'knew', 'who', 'crook', 'was', 'right', 'away', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'how', 'cops', 'were', 'going', 'catch', 'him.In', 'case', 'question', 'was', 'how', 'FBI', 'was', 'going', 'finally', 'nab', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'biggest', 'spy', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'finally', 'was', 'caught', '2001', '15', 'years', 'giving', 'tons', 'information', 'Soviet', 'Union.Exactly', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'Hanssen', 'did', ""n't"", 'public', 'knowledge', 'film', 'never', 'get', 'real', 'grasp', 'what', 'bad', 'guy', 'man', 'was', 'hence', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'movie', 'should', 'fact', 'film', 'almost', 'look', 'sympathetic', 'times', 'fell', 'trap', 'few', 'times', 'way', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'man', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'knew', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'harm', 'man', 'did', 'were', 'sympathy.Anyway', 'acting', 'superb', 'led', 'Cooper', 'course', 'Hanssen', 'ably', 'supported', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'FBI', 'clerk', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'brought', 'down', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Kate', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'recruited', ""O'Neill"", 'job', 'three', 'Caroline', 'Dehavemas', 'who', 'Hanssen', 'wife', 'Julianna', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'dominate', 'film.This', 'low-key', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'James', 'Bond-spy-type', 'action', 'humor', 'gritty', 'real', 'thing', 'also', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Only', 'key', 'people', 'involved', 'know', 'sure', 'could', 'see', 'really', 'wanted', 'emphasize', 'Hanssen', 's', 'strong', 'Catholic', 'beliefs', 'naturally', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'demonize', 'man', 'that.The', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'primarily', 'showing', 'strong', 'feeling', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'disdain', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'weak', 'ones', 'filmmakers', 'subtly', 'put', 'agendas', 'making', 'sure', 'portray', 'Hanssen', 'Liberal', 'causes', 'left-wing', 'slants', 'are', 'normal', 'filmmakers', 'so', 'ignored', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'excellent', 'acting', 'interesting', 'story', 'amazing', 'Hanssen', 'got', 'away', 'what', 'did', 'so', 'long', 'end', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'least', 'tighten', 'up', 'own', 'security', 'showing', 'how', 'many', 'holes', 'were', 'Hopefully', 'changed', 'equally', 'amazing', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'agent-status', 'could', 'bring', 'spy', 'down']",N/A
1066980,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000OYAT3U,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","While all movies based on historical subjects must fictionalize events and compress timelines, it is how they do so that matters.  Do they still tell the underlying truth of the story?  Do they distort the substance of the story?  Do they dumb it down so much that it transforms the story into something else?  If it does any of these things, I tend to dislike it to the extent it does so.  While this movie does make up scenes that never happened and puts actions into the hands of people that didn't do them, it still tells the truth of the story quite well for a Hollywood movie.  You can read about the reality and the movie at chasingthefrog under their reelfaces link for this movie.  It is quite interesting.The movie is told through the eyes of the FBI operative who was put close to Hanssen and who was very important during the last two months of the investigation that finally caught him.  This person is quite real and his name is Eric O'Neill and is played very well by Ryan Phillippe.  The focus of the movie is the spy and traitor Robert Hanssen.  The performance given here by Chris Cooper is superb and I hope it is recognized when awards are handed out.  Chris Cooper is a fantastic actor whose range of characterizations in his many performances is breathtaking.  Not only in the type of character, but their ages, in how they look, their intelligence, their moral make-up.  He has it all and I enjoy everything I have seen him do.Hannsen's wife, Bonnie is played very well by Kathleen Quinlan, and it is her devout faith that adds such a contradiction to Hannsen's character and motivation.  It would be easy to paint Hannsen as using his religion cynically.  However, while he certainly violated the tenets of his faith, it is clear that he holds his faith close, even while engaging in many seriously bad and compromised behaviors (beyond the spying).  O'Neill's immediate superior and FBI handler Kate Burroughs and played very well by Laura Linney.  She is tough enough to use O'Neill unsympathetically and yet has enough sense to know when she is pushing too hard and when to take a different tact with her inside guy.I enjoyed this movie very much.  It is smart and doesn't cheat by giving us a simple answer to the puzzle.  Just as in real life, we do not know Hanssen's true motivations.  Even Hanssen may not understand them.  We do know he cost real people their lives and compromised the United States in profound ways.

While I'm sure plenty of this ""true story"" is fabricated, what's most important are the parts that are all too real!The film makes a subtle, but scathing, indictment of Roman Catholicism in particular and religiosity in general; likewise for the FBI  and all other American intelligence agencies.How could a twisted, homophobic creep find solace in Opus Dei, an ultra-conservative movement within the Roman Catholic Church?  The answer is simple: Over the past 25 years Pope John Paul 2, and his close ally, Pope Bennedict have allowed the ultra-conservative elements of the Church to thrive. Meanwhile the liberal movements within the church - from former liberal  Congressman Father Robert Drinan S.J. to Catholic theologians Fr. Charles Curran and Fr. Mathew Fox to the liberation theology seminaries of the developing countries - have been allowed to wither on the vine. (Actually Congressman Father Drinan was told to quit; theologian Curran was banned from his job; theologian Fox was ""silenced"" - (I kid you not!) - and he has since left the Church; and the liberation theology seminaries have all since been closed.) Given the direction of the Church, I don't find it the least bit hard to believe convert Hanssen found comfort with a religious movement that would only be too happy to turn back the clock!!Next, how could the FBI allow one of it's top spies to betray the American people for around twenty years? To add insult to injury, the FBI remained clueless until Soviet defectors were paid 6 million dollars to spill the beans on Hanssen, and others like him! And these are same folks the American public are supposed to trust with their lives!But in hindsight, the events of 9/11 proves when the chips are down, our lofty American intelligence agencies do not add up to a hill of beans. But they did blame everyone else for their failure because their ""hands were tied"" by laws protecting American privacy, and even by the ""rule of law"", itself!  I mean, it's war - first a Cold one, now a hot religious one - so anything goes!But what was most endearing about this film is the very moving decision by our hero FBI agent to quit while the quitting was good! In other words, he had both the sense, and courage, to put his, and his wife's, emotional wellbeing ahead of his career with all its supposed glory!Which left me with a smile on my face as I walked out of the theater!",5,Folks Will Be Watching This Film A 100 Years From Now!,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,2539,"['consider', 'Breach', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'only', 'along', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'way', ""'m"", 'sure', 'plenty', 'true', 'story', 'fabricated', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'too', 'real', 'film', 'subtle', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'particular', 'religiosity', 'general', 'likewise', 'FBI', 'other', 'American', 'intelligence', 'agencies.How', 'could', 'twisted', 'homophobic', 'creep', 'find', 'solace', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'ultra-conservative', 'movement', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'answer', 'simple', 'past', '25', 'years', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', '2', 'close', 'ally', 'Pope', 'Bennedict', 'have', 'allowed', 'ultra-conservative', 'elements', 'Church', 'thrive', 'Meanwhile', 'liberal', 'movements', 'church', 'former', 'liberal', 'Congressman', 'Father', 'Robert', 'Drinan', 'S.J', 'Catholic', 'theologians', 'Fr', 'Charles', 'Curran', 'Fr', 'Mathew', 'Fox', 'liberation', 'theology', 'seminaries', 'developing', 'countries', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'wither', 'vine', 'Actually', 'Congressman', 'Father', 'Drinan', 'was', 'told', 'quit', 'theologian', 'Curran', 'was', 'banned', 'job', 'theologian', 'Fox', 'was', 'silenced', 'kid', 'not', 'left', 'Church', 'liberation', 'theology', 'seminaries', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'direction', 'Church', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'least', 'bit', 'hard', 'believe', 'convert', 'Hanssen', 'found', 'comfort', 'religious', 'movement', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'too', 'happy', 'turn', 'back', 'clock', 'Next', 'how', 'could', 'FBI', 'allow', 'one', 'top', 'spies', 'betray', 'American', 'people', 'twenty', 'years', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'FBI', 'remained', 'clueless', 'Soviet', 'defectors', 'were', 'paid', '6', 'million', 'dollars', 'spill', 'beans', 'Hanssen', 'others', 'are', 'same', 'folks', 'American', 'public', 'are', 'supposed', 'trust', 'lives', 'hindsight', 'events', '9/11', 'proves', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'lofty', 'American', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'hill', 'beans', 'did', 'blame', 'everyone', 'else', 'failure', 'hands', 'were', 'tied', 'laws', 'protecting', 'American', 'privacy', 'even', 'rule', 'law', 'mean', 'war', 'first', 'Cold', 'one', 'now', 'hot', 'religious', 'one', 'so', 'anything', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'endearing', 'film', 'very', 'moving', 'decision', 'hero', 'FBI', 'agent', 'quit', 'quitting', 'was', 'good', 'other', 'words', 'had', 'sense', 'courage', 'put', 'wife', 'emotional', 'wellbeing', 'ahead', 'career', 'supposed', 'glory', 'Which', 'left', 'smile', 'face', 'walked', 'theater']",N/A

Hartley,"[2, 2]","Early in 2001, the FBI capped off its investigation of the most serious national security breach in U.S. history by arresting Robert Hanssen, who had used his access as the Bureau's top Soviet counter-intelligence expert to sell classified information to the KGB.That case is dramatized in ""Breach"", a superb film starring Chris Cooper as Hanssen and directed by Billy Ray, who previously helmed ""Shattered Glass"" (another true tale dealing with deception and betrayal.)The film opens just a few months prior to the arrest. A young, ambitious field agent, Eric O'Neill (Ryan Philippe) is ""tasked"" to work in Hanssen's office as his assistant, while surreptitiously reporting on his boss's ""activities"" (O'Neill has been told that Hanssen is under suspicion of engaging in ""sexual perversion"" while on the taxpayer's dime).The officious, guarded and inherently suspicious Hanssen is a tough nut to crack; when O'Neill introduces himself on his first day of work, Hanssen barks ""Your name is Clerk, and my name is Sir"" before slamming his office door shut. However, as O'Neill ingratiates himself into his boss's life, he is surprised to find him admirable in many ways; he appears to be a true patriot, a good Catholic, and a dedicated ""family man"". O'Neill can't seem to dig up any dirt on the increasingly puzzling ""perversion"" charges.When he confronts his ""real"" boss (Laura Linney) with his doubts, she lets the cat out of the bag and admits that he has been the victim of a ruse to ensure he could gain Hanssen's trust. Hanssen, she tells him, is actually under investigation for something more ominous; he is suspected of selling information to the Soviets, possibly over a period of 20-odd  years. The degree of damage from this breach is so devastating, that ""We (the intelligence community) might as well have all stayed home (all those years).""Some may find the film bereft of nail-biting suspense; but real-life espionage isn't always as intriguing as a Le Carre novel or exciting like a Bond film. When the credits roll, Hanssen remains a cipher; although we are shown enough to quash any agent 007 comparison(unbeknownst to his wife, he videotaped their lovemaking and got his jollies mailing copies to cronies-the very antithesis of suave and sophisticated, I'd wager). If Hanssen recalls any fictional invention, it would be a protagonist from a Graham Greene novel (typically a bitter, world-weary public servant, mulled in Catholic guilt).The film abounds with excellent performances; it's certainly the best work Philippe has done to date. Dennis Haysbert and Gary Cole lend good support, and Bruce Davison (as O'Neill's father) makes the most of a brief, poignant scene with Philippe.",4,The spy who came in from the beltway,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2703,"['Early', '2001', 'FBI', 'capped', 'off', 'investigation', 'most', 'serious', 'national', 'security', 'breach', 'U.S.', 'history', 'arresting', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'who', 'had', 'used', 'access', 'Bureau', 'top', 'Soviet', 'counter-intelligence', 'expert', 'sell', 'classified', 'information', 'KGB.That', 'case', 'dramatized', 'Breach', 'superb', 'film', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Hanssen', 'directed', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'who', 'previously', 'helmed', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'true', 'tale', 'dealing', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'film', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'prior', 'arrest', 'young', 'ambitious', 'field', 'agent', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'tasked', 'work', 'Hanssen', 'office', 'assistant', 'surreptitiously', 'reporting', 'boss', 'activities', ""O'Neill"", 'been', 'told', 'Hanssen', 'suspicion', 'engaging', 'sexual', 'perversion', 'taxpayer', 'dime', 'officious', 'guarded', 'inherently', 'suspicious', 'Hanssen', 'tough', 'nut', 'crack', 'when', ""O'Neill"", 'first', 'day', 'work', 'Hanssen', 'name', 'Clerk', 'name', 'Sir', 'slamming', 'office', 'door', 'shut', 'However', ""O'Neill"", 'boss', 'life', 'surprised', 'find', 'admirable', 'many', 'ways', 'be', 'true', 'patriot', 'good', 'Catholic', 'dedicated', 'family', 'man', ""O'Neill"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'dig', 'up', 'dirt', 'increasingly', 'puzzling', 'perversion', 'charges.When', 'real', 'boss', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'doubts', 'cat', 'bag', 'been', 'victim', 'ruse', 'ensure', 'could', 'gain', 'Hanssen', 'trust', 'Hanssen', 'actually', 'investigation', 'something', 'more', 'ominous', 'suspected', 'selling', 'information', 'Soviets', 'possibly', 'period', '20-odd', 'years', 'degree', 'damage', 'breach', 'so', 'devastating', 'intelligence', 'community', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'years', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'bereft', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'real-life', 'espionage', ""n't"", 'always', 'as', 'intriguing', 'Le', 'Carre', 'novel', 'exciting', 'Bond', 'film', 'When', 'credits', 'roll', 'Hanssen', 'cipher', 'are', 'shown', 'enough', 'quash', 'agent', '007', 'comparison', 'unbeknownst', 'wife', 'videotaped', 'lovemaking', 'got', 'jollies', 'mailing', 'copies', 'cronies-the', 'very', 'antithesis', 'suave', 'sophisticated', ""'d"", 'wager', 'Hanssen', 'fictional', 'invention', 'would', 'be', 'protagonist', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'typically', 'bitter', 'world-weary', 'public', 'servant', 'mulled', 'Catholic', 'guilt', '.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'certainly', 'best', 'work', 'Philippe', 'done', 'date', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'lend', 'good', 'support', 'Bruce', 'Davison', ""O'Neill"", 'father', 'most', 'brief', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Philippe']",N/A

Based on the book by Eric O'Neill (played by a charming and sweet Ryan Phillippe), it tells the jump-in-your-seat sting operation aimed at America's worst turncoat spy Robert Hanssen (a creepy-silky-voiced Chris Cooper).FBI prick Hanssen, a know-it-all careerist who thinks he's far superior to careerists everywhere, has been selling us out to the Russians for nearly two decades. Poor little O'Neill, desperate to be some sort of real agent, is assigned to spy on Hanssen--and what he finds will rattle your bones. Of course no one at the time of O'Neill's assignment knew what Hanssen had done, exactly...and O'Neill himself thought he was supposed to catch Hanssen watching porn on the net.This dramatic, night-shade noirish adventure will leave you wondering about your own siblings and neighbors. Sure, Hanssen is a bastard with a perverted wife and phony Catholic morals...it's the weak spot that O'Neill exploits to get Hanssen nailed. However, there is a side to Hanssen's schizophrenic intelligence: he wants America to see how pathetically insecure it really is.So he makes a fortune selling secrets to the Russians to prove himself correct. Uh-huh. I recall how well THAT stood up in court at Hanssen's trial. Treason and espionage, and only the government knows what all else. They threw the book at him, and I say JUSTICE!!Chris Cooper gives an Oscar-worthy turn here, and I tell you: THAT man can be SPOOKY as hell! Ryan as real-life Eric O'Neill (now an attorney) is unmatched as an actor, for someone of his god-like beauty and age. He is sweet yet tough, fearless yet flashes those lashes and has you melting in a puddle. No wonder the real Hanssen fell for the sting: the real O'Neill looks like he could be Phillippe's brother. Very cool.You won't soon forget this classic slice of recent American history. You won't forget the lessons learned, and one thing you will never forget is the tension caused expertly: you think O'Neill is either going to get caught or bungle the whole operation.

I feel that the writers fudged by not offering any insight on Hannsen's motives for betraying his country. He does not seem to have done so for reasons of ideology. The scriptwriters' thrice-repeated portrayal of the Hannsen character as saying: ""The 'why' doesn't tell us anything!"" seems to me to be a cop-out for not offering a plausible explanation, even though such an explanation might be merely speculation. Are we really supposed to think that Hannsen spied for the Soviet Union because of a nasty father? Or because Hannsen sent racy tapes of himself and his wife to his best friend? Or, even less plausibly, because Hannsen was, according to the film, a devoted member of Opus Dei? Or because he nobly took only $100,000 for his services (as opposed to the millions taken by Ames)? For that matter, does Hannsen even deserve the title of 'mole,' since that term, as coined by John Le Carr&eacute;, refers to someone who was recruited by the Soviets (as were the Cambridge Spies, who, incidentally, took no money) to penetrate an agency on a long-term basis, becoming active only at the behest of his handlers? Hannsen was already in place in a position of importance; a mole does not usually volunteer his services for hire!Be that as it may, I believe that the film, which, it must be reiterated, is well acted and entertaining, would have become far more intriguing and complex had the authors offered some insight into the character of their antagonist, who, in the film, for the most part, seems to have been merely obnoxious.",3,The 'Why' Does tell us something!,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,1628,"['well-acted', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'somehow', 'left', 'dissatisfied', 'feel', 'writers', 'fudged', 'not', 'offering', 'insight', 'Hannsen', 'motives', 'betraying', 'country', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'reasons', 'ideology', 'scriptwriters', 'thrice-repeated', 'portrayal', 'Hannsen', 'character', 'saying', ""'why"", ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'be', 'cop-out', 'not', 'offering', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'even', 'such', 'explanation', 'might', 'be', 'merely', 'speculation', 'Are', 'really', 'supposed', 'think', 'Hannsen', 'spied', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'nasty', 'father', 'Hannsen', 'sent', 'racy', 'tapes', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'even', 'less', 'plausibly', 'Hannsen', 'was', 'according', 'film', 'devoted', 'member', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'nobly', 'took', 'only', '100,000', 'services', 'opposed', 'millions', 'taken', 'Ames', 'matter', 'Hannsen', 'even', 'deserve', 'title', ""'mole"", 'term', 'coined', 'John', 'Le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'refers', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'recruited', 'Soviets', 'were', 'Cambridge', 'Spies', 'who', 'incidentally', 'took', 'money', 'penetrate', 'agency', 'long-term', 'basis', 'becoming', 'active', 'only', 'behest', 'handlers', 'Hannsen', 'was', 'already', 'place', 'position', 'importance', 'mole', 'not', 'usually', 'volunteer', 'services', 'hire', 'Be', 'may', 'believe', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'reiterated', 'well', 'acted', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'intriguing', 'complex', 'had', 'authors', 'offered', 'insight', 'character', 'antagonist', 'who', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'merely', 'obnoxious']",N/A

It was one of those movies that has spies. Then there are counter spies. Then there are spies within the spies who are looking for the counterspies.  You probably get the idea. Lots of intrigue. Very dangerous. Everybody is really uptight. In any case, it's a well-done movie, if you go in for stuff like this, and it's based on a real case.The acting in this film is quite good. Perhaps if there is a problem it would be that the story is slow moving with lots of character development and the characters aren't particularly interesting. When it comes to pace, glacial might be a good term. If you're expecting a spy story with lots of action, shoot-em up scenes and destruction, well, forget it. Most of the  action here takes place in offices, apartments and cars and mostly consists of talking and diddling with electronic equipment. Maybe if you were really, really interested in this particular espionage case, this would be a fascinating movie for you. I can understand that. It was well directed and nicely filmed. The sound was good, although the background music got a bit too loud at times.Chris  Cooper played an FBI man assigned to be a counterspy in infiltrating the Soviet KGB. Well, he's fulfilling his function, all right, but he's also bleeding secret information to them and becomes a suspect within the FBI. Ryan Philippe is secretly assigned to infiltrate the office of Cooper and report  back to a higher-level officer within the FBI. It all becomes a bit sticky, of course and there are a lot of tense moments among this generally-paranoid crowd. Ultimately, Cooper is arrested, but, of course, you already knew that because this is a depiction of an actual true story that is on the record as being one of the greatest breaches in the history of American security. The movie is well done. I would consider it to be more educational than just a piece of entertainment.Gary Peterson",4,Interesting True Story. Glacial Pace. Good Acting.

Both films are based on the true stories of men whose whole lives were based on falsehoods and both films deal with the downfall and resulting implications of their demise for these men and those around them. Being a huge fan of ""Shattered Glass"", it came as no surprise to me that I also liked ""Breach"". In a way, the strong similarities between ""Shattered Glass"" and ""Breach"" detracted from ""Breach"", since I would have liked to see Billy Ray extend himself more. Nevertheless, ""Breach"" is still a great film.Although Robert Hanssen was a traitor to his country, instead of portraying him as a man who is purely evil, he is portrayed as a weak man who still has some good features. That is, he is portrayed as a human being, albeit a flawed one, rather than a cardboard cut-out villain. Chris Cooper gives an excellent performance in this role. This isn't the first film I've seen him in (in fact, it's the seventh), but it's the first time that I've really taken any notice of him.The script of this film is also great, if a little bit by-the-book (its structure follows that given in screenwriting texts to the letter, not that that's a bad thing). When you think about it, a film about one man spying on his boss has the potential to be completely boring. Yet, Ray turns this into a well-written, well-paced thriller with plenty of moments of genuine tension.  Several of the scenes in the film seem far too cinematic to be true, which makes me wonder how close this film kept to the fact. Nevertheless, even if this film turns out to be 95% fiction, that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a highly enjoyable movie that will make you think.",5,The life of another liar,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,2114,"['Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'young', 'FBI', 'employee', 'who', 'desperate', 'become', 'agent', 'assigned', 'spy', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'top', 'FBI', 'agent', 'family', 'man', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'selling', 'government', 'secrets', 'Russians', 'past', '16', 'years', 'Breach', 'writer/director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'touches', 'many', 'same', 'themes', 'first', 'film', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'fabulist', 'Stephen', 'Glass', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'men', 'whole', 'lives', 'were', 'based', 'falsehoods', 'films', 'deal', 'downfall', 'resulting', 'implications', 'demise', 'men', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'came', 'surprise', 'also', 'liked', 'Breach', 'way', 'strong', 'similarities', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'Breach', 'detracted', 'Breach', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'extend', 'more', 'Nevertheless', 'Breach', 'still', 'great', 'film.Although', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'traitor', 'country', 'instead', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'purely', 'evil', 'portrayed', 'weak', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'good', 'features', 'portrayed', 'human', 'being', 'flawed', 'one', 'rather', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'villain', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'excellent', 'performance', 'role', ""n't"", 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fact', 'seventh', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'really', 'taken', 'notice', 'him.The', 'script', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'little', 'bit', 'by-the-book', 'structure', 'given', 'screenwriting', 'texts', 'letter', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'When', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'spying', 'boss', 'potential', 'be', 'completely', 'boring', 'Ray', 'well-written', 'well-paced', 'thriller', 'plenty', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tension', 'Several', 'scenes', 'film', 'seem', 'far', 'too', 'cinematic', 'be', 'true', 'wonder', 'how', 'close', 'film', 'kept', 'fact', 'Nevertheless', 'even', 'film', 'out', 'be', '95', '%', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think']",N/A

Gilbert""","[2, 2]","I saw the previews for this film at the beginning of a different one, and immediatly wanted to see it although I really didn't know what it was about: I don't even remember realizing that it was based on a true story.I personally don't think that this film is the typical 'spy' film; it's certainly loads different than any James Bond movie, and a far cry from any of the Bourne movies either.  This isn't a bad thing: it's just a different thing.  Some of the reviewers claimed that the film is to slow or boring, but I think that those reviewers have completely missed the point of the film - and the man that the film is about.After I watched the film I did a little of my own research on Robert Hanssen and found that even where the film might not have followed his story exactly (Hanssen never actually came over to the O'Neill's house, O'Neill's not the one who actually downloaded information from Hanssen's PDA, et. al.) it still does an excellent job of just stretching the events enough to make them a little more exciting without actually creating something altogether different (Hanssen and O'Neill had apparently planned to go for dinner, but it would have been after Hanssen was arrested, and Hanssen DID ask O'Neill if he'd gone through his bag after the information had been downloaded by people that O'Neill had brought the PDA to - and had nearly not gotten it back in the bag on time).I also like how key phrases were inserted, even though we might not have noticed.  Early on in the film Hanssen tells O'Neill something like ""[he'll piss purple if Hanssen ever catches [O'Neill] in his office again].""  In real life, it was hearing this phrase (that Hanssen often said) on a tape that the FBI got from an ex-KGB member that helped them realize that the mole they were looking for was actually Hanssen, not a different individual who they had suspected.The crimes that Hanssen committed were not full of action and drama.  As the film shows, Hanssen would simply put information in Hefty plastic bags and leave them at drop points for the Russians to pick up.  He wasn't intested in a lot of money because he knew that if he'd spend big hunks of money all of a sudden, people would be onto him.  To put too much action and drama into this film would be to misunderstand the story.Hanssen did do things that could be deemed slightly socially defective, like run people into walls, copiers, etc., when he'd walk with someone, as is depicted in the film.  All the little isms about who Hanssen was/is are what make the film: not action and drama.  I think that Chris Cooper portrays Hanssen brilliantly, and Phillippe does an excellent job with O'Neill.Overall an excellent film, I'm looking forward to watching it again!",5,Not what I expected...,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2737,"['saw', 'previews', 'film', 'beginning', 'different', 'one', 'immediatly', 'wanted', 'see', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'realizing', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story.I', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'typical', ""'spy"", 'film', 'certainly', 'different', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'far', 'cry', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'either', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'different', 'thing', 'reviewers', 'claimed', 'film', 'slow', 'boring', 'think', 'reviewers', 'have', 'completely', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'man', 'film', 'about.After', 'watched', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'own', 'research', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'found', 'even', 'where', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'exactly', 'Hanssen', 'never', 'actually', 'came', ""O'Neill"", 'house', ""O'Neill"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'downloaded', 'information', 'Hanssen', 'PDA', 'et', 'al', 'still', 'excellent', 'job', 'just', 'stretching', 'events', 'enough', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'exciting', 'actually', 'creating', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'Hanssen', ""O'Neill"", 'had', 'apparently', 'planned', 'go', 'dinner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'arrested', 'Hanssen', 'DID', 'ask', ""O'Neill"", ""'d"", 'gone', 'bag', 'information', 'had', 'been', 'downloaded', 'people', ""O'Neill"", 'had', 'brought', 'PDA', 'had', 'nearly', 'not', 'gotten', 'back', 'bag', 'time', '.I', 'also', 'how', 'key', 'phrases', 'were', 'inserted', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'Early', 'film', 'Hanssen', 'tells', ""O'Neill"", 'something', '[', ""'ll"", 'piss', 'purple', 'Hanssen', 'ever', '[', ""O'Neill"", ']', 'office', 'again', ']', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'hearing', 'phrase', 'Hanssen', 'often', 'said', 'tape', 'FBI', 'got', 'ex-KGB', 'member', 'helped', 'realize', 'mole', 'were', 'looking', 'was', 'actually', 'Hanssen', 'not', 'different', 'individual', 'who', 'had', 'suspected.The', 'crimes', 'Hanssen', 'committed', 'were', 'not', 'full', 'action', 'drama', 'film', 'shows', 'Hanssen', 'would', 'simply', 'put', 'information', 'Hefty', 'plastic', 'bags', 'leave', 'drop', 'points', 'Russians', 'pick', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'intested', 'lot', 'money', 'knew', ""'d"", 'spend', 'big', 'hunks', 'money', 'sudden', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'drama', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'misunderstand', 'story.Hanssen', 'did', 'do', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'slightly', 'socially', 'defective', 'run', 'people', 'walls', 'copiers', 'etc.', 'when', ""'d"", 'walk', 'someone', 'depicted', 'film', 'little', 'isms', 'who', 'Hanssen', 'was/is', 'are', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'action', 'drama', 'think', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Hanssen', 'brilliantly', 'Phillippe', 'excellent', 'job', ""O'Neill.Overall"", 'excellent', 'film', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'again']",N/A

Yet the screenplay by Adam Mazur and William Rotko in turn based on a story by director Billy Ray with Mazur and Rotko transforms this infamous case into a fine melodrama. The result is a smart thriller, one that holds our attention despite the fact that the results of the case are public knowledge.Robert Hanssen (in a brilliant performance by Chris Cooper) works in national Intelligence and is a crusty, ominous character with some strange demons in his head.  FBI Agent Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney) studies a young FBI clerk Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) and decides he is the one gritty and fearless enough to assign to the suspicious Hanssen, a man the FBI feels certain is a major suspect in the breach of security.  Hanssen has been selling Intelligence reports to the Soviet Union but in so careful a manner that his status is almost impenetrable.  Eric is married to an East German girl Julianna (Caroline Dhavernas) and while she is proud of Eric's advancement in the FBI she fears his preoccupation with his work. Hanssen and his wife  Bonnie (Kathleen Quinlan) form a friendship with Eric and Julianna and that friendship, together with a shared near obsession with the Catholic Church, gains Hanssen's trust in Eric. The tension between the investigation by the FBI and Eric's role as a mole create some terrifying situations. But Eric overcomes all obstacles and proceeds to successfully match Hanssen's inscrutable mind and behavior and in the end takes great risks in all aspects of his life to fulfill his mission.The cast is excellent with special attention to the performances of Cooper, Phillippe, and Linney.  The supporting roles are carefully cast with such fine actors as Gary Cole, Dennis Haysbert, and Bruce Davison. The production values add immeasurably to the aura of suspense.

Howell ""neogalahad""","[5, 6]","""Breach"" is not a James Bond-inspired action flick laden with explosions and car chases; instead, it's the flawlessly-acted real-life story of Robert Hanssen (played by Chris Cooper), an FBI agent convicted of spying for the Soviets, and the young FBI clerk (Ryan Phillipe) who helps the Bureau bring him to justice.Cooper and Phillipe give standout performances.  Cooper shows all the conflicting facets of Hanssen, by turns devout, rude, charming, paranoid, brilliant, perverted, opinionated.  Just a narrowing of his eyes or a slight smirk shows what's going on in Hanssen's head.  Laura Linney is also memorable in a supporting role as the no-nonsense agent in charge of the investigation.Eric O'Neill, the real-life clerk who was Hanssen's assistant, was a consultant to the film, and the movie is considered an accurate portrayal of the case and the people involved.  A tight, intelligent script combined with great performances make ""Breach"" both an absorbing character study and a tense spy thriller for those who enjoy a good cat-and-mouse battle of wits.

An FBI trainee is assigned to spy on a veteran Agent who it turns out is selling secrets to the Soviets.The Robert Hanssen spying case, was -- it is so clear now -- the harbinger of 9/11, a big honking symptom of the entrenched, institutional problems at the FBI that let big clues slip by, clues that might have prevented the horrors of that day. Robert Hanssen, career FBI agent, was intel, and, as Hanssen (Chris Cooper) explains to the agent wannabe assigned to work as his assistant, Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe), the intel side of the FBI gets no respect. And, oh, don't get Hanssen started on the lack of interagency cooperation between the FBI and the CIA. Peter TraversEric O'Neill, played by Ryan Philippe becomes discouraged with his FBI career and he goes to his father to discuss whether he should quit. His father tells him the philosophy of his seafaring father, which is an analogy for life. ""Get on the boat, do your job, and get back home'. Eric O'Neill is a surveillance-operative for the FBI and his goal is to be promoted to a full Agent. One day he is called into a meeting with Agent Burroughs, played by Laura Linney. She tells him he is being assigned to the desk of Robert Hanssen, and that Hanssen is suspected of posting sexual content on the Internet. His job will be to watch Hanssen's every move and to report back to Burroughs. Within a short while O'Neill doubts his job, as he has come to respect Hanssen.O'Neill confronts Burroughs and the real story is told. Hanssen has been feeding top secret information to enemies for twenty years, and the damage is in the millions of dollars and dozens of lives. Now O'Neill finds himself pitted against one of the finest minds in the FBI.The drama and suspense in this movie is overwhelming. This story is partially known as the story begins. However, the story progresses and the life of Robert Hanssen is laid bare. The power of the finale is superb. We are left to wonder about the man Hanssen at the end. This is a story of the real world of politics and espionage. The real story is that of the relationship that develops between O'Neill and Hanssen. The mind games that are played are essential to the whole. Chris Cooper is phenomenal as Hanssen. One of the better acting roles I have seen this year. Ryan Philippe playing O'Neill is the perfect foil.Recommended for fans of spy thrillers.Gunner  January, 2008",5,I want to make History,1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2439,"['Breach', 'DVDBreach', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'FBI', 'trainee', 'assigned', 'spy', 'veteran', 'Agent', 'who', 'out', 'selling', 'secrets', 'Soviets.The', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'spying', 'case', 'was', 'so', 'clear', 'now', 'harbinger', '9/11', 'big', 'honking', 'symptom', 'entrenched', 'institutional', 'problems', 'FBI', 'let', 'big', 'clues', 'slip', 'clues', 'might', 'have', 'prevented', 'horrors', 'day', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'career', 'FBI', 'agent', 'was', 'intel', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'agent', 'wannabe', 'assigned', 'work', 'assistant', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'intel', 'side', 'FBI', 'respect', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Hanssen', 'started', 'lack', 'interagency', 'cooperation', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'Peter', 'TraversEric', ""O'Neill"", 'played', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'discouraged', 'FBI', 'career', 'father', 'discuss', 'should', 'quit', 'father', 'philosophy', 'seafaring', 'father', 'analogy', 'life', 'Get', 'boat', 'do', 'job', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'surveillance-operative', 'FBI', 'goal', 'be', 'promoted', 'full', 'Agent', 'One', 'day', 'called', 'meeting', 'Agent', 'Burroughs', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'being', 'assigned', 'desk', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'Hanssen', 'suspected', 'posting', 'sexual', 'content', 'Internet', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'watch', 'Hanssen', 'move', 'report', 'back', 'Burroughs', 'short', 'while', ""O'Neill"", 'job', 'come', 'respect', ""Hanssen.O'Neill"", 'confronts', 'Burroughs', 'real', 'story', 'told', 'Hanssen', 'been', 'feeding', 'top', 'secret', 'information', 'enemies', 'twenty', 'years', 'damage', 'millions', 'dollars', 'dozens', 'lives', 'Now', ""O'Neill"", 'pitted', 'one', 'finest', 'minds', 'FBI.The', 'drama', 'suspense', 'movie', 'overwhelming', 'story', 'partially', 'known', 'story', 'However', 'story', 'life', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'laid', 'bare', 'power', 'finale', 'superb', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'man', 'Hanssen', 'end', 'story', 'real', 'world', 'politics', 'espionage', 'real', 'story', 'relationship', ""O'Neill"", 'Hanssen', 'mind', 'games', 'are', 'played', 'are', 'essential', 'whole', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'phenomenal', 'Hanssen', 'One', 'better', 'acting', 'roles', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'playing', ""O'Neill"", 'perfect', 'foil.Recommended', 'fans', 'spy', 'thrillers.Gunner', 'January', '2008']",N/A

Performances by its stars, led by Chris Cooper, are spooky good.  (Excuse the pun).  Although the DVD's Special Features reveal certain dramatic liberties taken with the story, it is based on facts and the real life experience of a young FBI agent.  He is brought in to spy on a 25-year veteran of the Bureau with the goal being to catch him in the act of spying for the Russians.  The twists and turns will have you on the edge of your seat, despite the lack of big-budget special effects.Acting in this movie simply couldn't be better.  Chris Cooper is so convincing as the villain and paranoid FBI veteran you have to worry about people who get in contact with him in real life.  Ryan Phillipe as the young FBI trainee is the perfect foil as he tries to gain the trust of his senior colleague.  Laura Linney is great as the young man's supervisor and mentor.  She also seems made for the part.Although the movie and its fine Special Features fail to really tell us why a 25-year old FBI agent, family man, and devout Catholic would betray his country, there are hints of causes here and there.  Some reviewers recommend getting an earlier version of the story, starring William Hurt, which I am pursuing.  Was it jealousy?  Was there an ideological basis?  Was he insane?  Was there demon possession?  Maybe Robert Hanssen, the guilty man, will tell us himself some day.  He is currently serving a life sentence in a high-security federal prison, where he is in solitary confinement, 23 hours a day. Only family members may visit him.Summing up, if you have any interest in spy stories or just outstanding drama, you need to see this film. It is far superior to movies like ""The Good Shepherd"" and ""The Company.""

1067017,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000OYAT3U,Jason,"[2, 6]","Breach is a classic espionage movie.  Eric O'Neill (Ryan Philippe) is sent to work on the daunting task of spying on a spy.  He's paired with a veteran agent named Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper).  Initially, O'Neill is given the assignment by Agent Burroughs (Laura Linney) under the guise that Hanssen has been posting sexual content on the web.  Eventually he discovers that Hanssen is involved in something much more despicable.From there it's a somewhat tense battle of wills as O'Neill, Burroughs, and all involved do whatever they can to uncover the web of lies and deceit being perpetrated by Hanssen, while he does everything he can to hide his intention and his actions.It's well acted, and the story itself is fairly interesting.  If it were a documentary on the History channel, I would have been much more interested - because there would have been many more details.  And while I appreciate the fact that it stayed true to the content, there was simply something lacking in the delivery of the story, not to mention the fact that the explanation of Hanssen's actions was nearly absent.  Sooner or later there needs to be a little bit of video stimulation to go along with the audio counterpart.In the end it's a spy movie that falls flat because of bad pacing, painfully slow sequences, long-winded and uninteresting dialogue, and a great deal of disappointment.  The movie is coma-inducing during portions of the movie, slower than wheelchair stuck the mud, and much like running on the beach, the arduous effort doesn't seem to be nearly as worthwhile or as running on a flat surface.",2,The great acting cannot overcome the pace,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1598,"['Breach', 'classic', 'espionage', 'movie', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'sent', 'work', 'daunting', 'task', 'spying', 'spy', 'paired', 'veteran', 'agent', 'named', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Initially', ""O'Neill"", 'given', 'assignment', 'Agent', 'Burroughs', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'guise', 'Hanssen', 'been', 'posting', 'sexual', 'content', 'web', 'Eventually', 'Hanssen', 'involved', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'somewhat', 'tense', 'battle', 'wills', ""O'Neill"", 'Burroughs', 'involved', 'do', 'can', 'uncover', 'web', 'lies', 'deceit', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'Hanssen', 'everything', 'can', 'hide', 'intention', 'actions.It', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'were', 'documentary', 'History', 'channel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'more', 'details', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'stayed', 'true', 'content', 'was', 'simply', 'something', 'lacking', 'delivery', 'story', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'explanation', 'Hanssen', 'actions', 'was', 'nearly', 'absent', 'Sooner', 'later', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'video', 'stimulation', 'go', 'along', 'audio', 'end', 'spy', 'movie', 'flat', 'bad', 'pacing', 'painfully', 'slow', 'sequences', 'long-winded', 'uninteresting', 'dialogue', 'great', 'deal', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'coma-inducing', 'portions', 'movie', 'slower', 'wheelchair', 'stuck', 'mud', 'much', 'running', 'beach', 'arduous', 'effort', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'worthwhile', 'running', 'flat', 'surface']",N/A

Darling,"[4, 4]","I finally got around to seeing ""Breach"" last night, and am very happy I didn't let this one slip by me - having missed it in theatres.One thing I really liked about this film was that it dealt with a very brief period of time - about 2 months prior to and leading up to the case being concluded against Robert Hansen. No dwelling in the characters' respective pasts - it just jumps right into the drama and it never lets up or gets boring. There is a nail bite-inducing sequence in just about every segment - whether it takes place at the offices of the CIA, the outskirts of Washington D.C., or at someone's home.I had anticipated more violent death scenes of U.S. Operatives, but am glad to report there are none to speak of. Just a couple Russian contacts are shown being executed during a quick sequence recalling the past incident. The movie did not need violence to achieve what it does. Just the suggestion of how many lives Hansen gave up during his dealings of espionage are enough. You're allowed to imagine just how the demise of these agents came about.The characrer portrayals are also top-notch. Chris Cooper is spell-binding as the traitor Robert Hansen. He chills a room by just walking into it. Ryan Phillipe is also in top form as the young gun with his eye on becoming an Agent. The interaction between the two is full of tension as one attempts to gather evidence against the other in a ruse of friendship and mentorship. Laura Linney - although in a relatively minor role - is excellent as the career woman hell-bent on busting Hansen and vindicating her life's work in the CIA which has been compromised by Hansen the whole time.Although the viewer knows the fate of Hansen before even beginning to watch this film, the way in which the story is concluded is nevertheless nothing short of exciting.Just to back-track slightly... the opening of the film - which is actual footage of former Attorney General Ashcroft making the announcement that the traitor Hansen has been caught - was a brilliant sequence. Ashcroft makes mention of how the case only underscores how The United States is ""still"" a target from outside forces who mean to do the country harm. This was February of 2001......... we were soon to find out just how true those words were.An excellent film all-around.",5,Great spy movie without any need for violence,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,2300,"['finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'Breach', 'last', 'night', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'one', 'slip', 'having', 'missed', 'theatres.One', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'about', '2', 'months', 'prior', 'leading', 'up', 'case', 'being', 'concluded', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'dwelling', 'characters', 'respective', 'pasts', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'drama', 'never', 'up', 'boring', 'nail', 'bite-inducing', 'sequence', 'just', 'segment', 'place', 'offices', 'CIA', 'outskirts', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'someone', 'home.I', 'had', 'anticipated', 'more', 'violent', 'death', 'scenes', 'U.S.', 'Operatives', 'am', 'glad', 'report', 'are', 'none', 'speak', 'Just', 'couple', 'Russian', 'contacts', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'executed', 'quick', 'sequence', 'recalling', 'past', 'incident', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'violence', 'achieve', 'what', 'Just', 'suggestion', 'how', 'many', 'Hansen', 'gave', 'up', 'dealings', 'espionage', 'are', 'enough', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'imagine', 'just', 'how', 'demise', 'agents', 'came', 'about.The', 'characrer', 'portrayals', 'are', 'also', 'top-notch', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'spell-binding', 'traitor', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'room', 'just', 'walking', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'young', 'gun', 'eye', 'becoming', 'Agent', 'interaction', 'two', 'full', 'tension', 'one', 'attempts', 'gather', 'evidence', 'other', 'ruse', 'friendship', 'mentorship', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'relatively', 'minor', 'role', 'excellent', 'career', 'woman', 'hell-bent', 'busting', 'Hansen', 'vindicating', 'life', 'work', 'CIA', 'been', 'compromised', 'Hansen', 'whole', 'viewer', 'fate', 'Hansen', 'even', 'beginning', 'watch', 'film', 'way', 'story', 'concluded', 'nevertheless', 'nothing', 'short', 'exciting.Just', 'back-track', 'slightly', 'opening', 'film', 'actual', 'footage', 'former', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Ashcroft', 'making', 'announcement', 'traitor', 'Hansen', 'been', 'caught', 'was', 'brilliant', 'sequence', 'Ashcroft', 'mention', 'how', 'case', 'only', 'how', 'United', 'States', 'still', 'target', 'outside', 'forces', 'who', 'mean', 'do', 'country', 'harm', 'was', 'February', '2001', 'were', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'true', 'words', 'were.An', 'excellent', 'film', 'all-around']",N/A

1067021,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000OYAT3U,J from NY,"[1, 1]","""Breach"" is the most unpleasant and morbidly fascinating tale of Robert Phillip Hansenn, one of the worst traitors in American history: actually, the movie downplays just how treacherous he was in terms of how many deaths he is responsible for, not to mention the extremely high security nature of the secrets he was selling.Chris Cooper makes the movie as the monstrously hypocritical and somehow entranching Hansenn: face pale and drawn, ultra-conservative and outwardly a devout Catholic, bitter and cruel with unexpected moments trust and warmth, he seems the personification of what can happen what an individual identifies too much with his nation--and all the while he is committing high treason and engaging in sexual deviance by distributing tapes of him and his wife copulating. Ryan Phillipe turns in a golly gee All American Boy performance as the extraordinary Eric O' Neill, the agent who put Hansenn exactly where he belongs: in a solitary cell 23 hours a day.Everything somehow falls to the sidelines of Cooper's performance, however: the perverse enigma of his character is unforgettable.  He plays a broken, ruined man in need of validation, friendship, or something outside the narrow locus of his ""clean cut"" life.  At one point he asks O' Neill, finding himself in ever more compromised positions trying to get the drop on his target, whether this job is too much for him.  He says ""Yes, sir"".  Hansenn's response is: ""Pray more"".This is more of a character study than anything else, though at times the stunning incompetence of the FBI might disturb the viewer more than information about Hansenn's activities; he wasn't caught until he was 56 years old, and if they hadn't sicked O'Neill on him, he probably would have walked.  Cooper manages to evoke some pity for Hansenn with his masterfully macabre and conflicted performance: the real Hansenn doesn't deserve much.  The film references his ""harassing female subordinates"": he did more than that, on one occasion actually dragging another agent across the floor for leaving one of his meetings early.  When the FBI showed up at the drop point, Hansenn's response was not ""Pray for me"" or anything like that, but ""What took you so long?""

Chris Cooper is one of the best actors of our generation, but unfortunately he is the only one who carries this tiresome, slow-paced, talky and overdramatic film that deals with the investigation of the biggest FBI spy in the US history. We never thought that working for the FBI could be so boring.Brief Story:A young bureau operative Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) has been assigned to spy on a fellow FBI agent Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), who apparently has committed a series of sexual misconducts within the organization--Eric is going to work as his secretary. The FBI agents behind this investigation are Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney ), Rich Garces (Gary Cole) and the man in charge Dan Plesac (Dennis Haysbert). They depend on Eric to find any information about him that might be important for the case. Agent Burroughs works closely with Eric and gives him a beeper for any emergencies.Eric gets to know Robert Hanssen quite well. Apparently, he is a nobleman who goes to church along with his wife; his family loves him; his computer is clean and he never makes sexual comments. What is Robert Hanssen hiding? Eric soon realizes that something bigger is happening, but they are not telling him. After a dispute with agent Burroughs, Eric finds out that is in a bigger case that will change his life and probably advance his career. The FBI agent he is spying is one of the biggest double agents in US history. A man who has sold secrets to the Soviet Union--costing lives and money to the US Government--for years and Eric is the one who will bring him down, but also he has to deal with his own personal issues with his wife Bonnie (Kathleen Quinlan).Review:Director Billy Ray ('Shattered Glass') had an opportunity to explore an exciting event in the FBI history, but he preferred to use no action, awkward dialogue with long conversations, very little thriller and clich&eacute;s in his new film Breach. Do not expect something like the TV series ""24."" The star who saves ""Breach"" from a complete failure is Chris Cooper--he is probably an underrated actor--who gives an excellent performance in this film. He is intelligent, mysterious, a bit funny, but a very unlikable character who keeps things for himself, talks about God, but trusts no one. ""Breach"" would have never worked without him. We feel little chemistry between Cooper and Phillippe who have more screen time than anybody else and this creates a tiresome movie experience.""Breach"" has an editing flaw; it feels longer than it is, probably because of long explanations and lack of action. Some of the scenes go on forever and do not advance the story--especially the scene between Eric and his father ""do the right thing"" conversation that reminds us of a drug-free family commercial, with the music and all. No matter how much Billy Ray tried to give some thrilling moments to this film, we can't help to see its predictable end.The Verdict:""Based on a true story"" doesn't mean the movie has to be boring and predictable. Writers should be free to unleash their imaginations to make a better entertaining experience--after all, that's what movies are about. ""Breach"" is a dull film that deals with an important FBI case that probably was more interesting than what they portray here.",3,We never thought that working for the FBI could be so boring,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,3461,"['*No', 'Spoilers*We', 'were', 'expecting', 'kind', 'action/espionage', 'thriller', 'new', 'movie', 'Breach', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'none', 'above', 'trailer', 'illusion', 'something', ""n't"", 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'tiresome', 'slow-paced', 'talky', 'overdramatic', 'film', 'deals', 'investigation', 'biggest', 'FBI', 'spy', 'US', 'history', 'never', 'thought', 'working', 'FBI', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'boring.Brief', 'Story', 'young', 'bureau', 'operative', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'been', 'assigned', 'spy', 'fellow', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'apparently', 'committed', 'series', 'sexual', 'misconducts', 'organization', 'Eric', 'going', 'work', 'secretary', 'FBI', 'agents', 'investigation', 'are', 'Kate', 'Burroughs', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Rich', 'Garces', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'man', 'charge', 'Dan', 'Plesac', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'depend', 'Eric', 'find', 'information', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'case', 'Agent', 'Burroughs', 'closely', 'Eric', 'beeper', 'emergencies.Eric', 'know', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'quite', 'well', 'Apparently', 'nobleman', 'who', 'church', 'along', 'wife', 'family', 'computer', 'clean', 'never', 'sexual', 'comments', 'What', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'hiding', 'Eric', 'soon', 'something', 'bigger', 'happening', 'are', 'not', 'telling', 'dispute', 'agent', 'Burroughs', 'Eric', 'out', 'bigger', 'case', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'probably', 'advance', 'career', 'FBI', 'agent', 'spying', 'one', 'biggest', 'double', 'agents', 'US', 'history', 'man', 'who', 'sold', 'secrets', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'costing', 'lives', 'money', 'US', 'Government', 'years', 'Eric', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'bring', 'down', 'also', 'deal', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'wife', 'Bonnie', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', '.Review', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Ray', ""'Shattered"", 'Glass', 'had', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'exciting', 'event', 'FBI', 'history', 'preferred', 'use', 'action', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'long', 'conversations', 'very', 'little', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'new', 'film', 'Breach', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'something', 'TV', 'series', '24', 'star', 'who', 'Breach', 'complete', 'failure', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'probably', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'excellent', 'performance', 'film', 'intelligent', 'mysterious', 'bit', 'funny', 'very', 'unlikable', 'character', 'who', 'things', 'God', 'one', 'Breach', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'worked', 'feel', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Cooper', 'Phillippe', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'anybody', 'else', 'tiresome', 'movie', 'experience', 'Breach', 'editing', 'flaw', 'longer', 'probably', 'long', 'explanations', 'lack', 'action', 'scenes', 'go', 'forever', 'do', 'not', 'advance', 'story', 'especially', 'scene', 'Eric', 'father', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'conversation', 'drug-free', 'family', 'commercial', 'music', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'tried', 'give', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'predictable', 'end.The', 'Verdict', 'Based', 'true', 'story', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'be', 'boring', 'predictable', 'Writers', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'unleash', 'imaginations', 'make', 'better', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'Breach', 'dull', 'film', 'deals', 'important', 'FBI', 'case', 'probably', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'what', 'portray', 'here']",N/A

When Breach starts the screen notes that it is based on a true story.  Yep, about 3% of it at most. One nearly always knows that what follows after a note like this means approximately 99% of what follows is pure fiction. First, the movie ignores the 2 times that the FBI nearly caught Hanssen by his own  foolish mistakes but dismissed all of the evidence incriminating him. Then it makes the Eric character look like the main guy that caught him. However, even thought Eric did play a part, the FBI really caught Robert Hanssen by bribing a former Russian SVR agent who gave them a disc w/ Hanssen's voice on it, along w/ different items, that allowed them to definitively ID him as the traitor. Then there are silly scenes such as the drunken shootout by Hanssen which never happened, Eric actually bringing home a VCR tape of Hanssen's self made porn tape which his wife gets into & illogical dialog such as ""this is a witch hunt like Ken Starr and the blue dress."" Well, Ken Starr was proved right! Bill did lie. Then you have annoying details such as the Eric character calling Hanssen ""boss"" all of the time like it was the 1950s & some incompetent make up artist that put way too much pink lipstick on Chris Cooper that makes him look like he's light in the loafers or something. Anyway, I nearly feel asleep 10 minutes into the film. Instead of focusing in on Eric & Hanssen's relationship, FAR more true interesting things could have been put into the movie which really DID happen.

O'Neill's role in catching Hansenn was classified until this movie, which is why you do not see him mentioned in any of the books about the case. ( And it makes you wonder what else they don't mention.) O'Neill affirms that most of the movie is highly factual: they even use things owned by Hansen and O'Neill as the case unfolded, and many things are filmed exactly where they happened, including Hansenn's capture.

1067040,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000OYAT3U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","Robert Hanssen was an FBI agent who was arrested in 2001 and pled guilty to 15 counts of espionage with regards to having sold American secrets to Moscow for $1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 15-year period.  Hanssen's activities have been described as ""possibly the worst intelligence disaster in US history,"" including leaking the names of doubles agents, the continuity of government plan in case of a Soviet nuclear attack, and American methods for intercepting Soviet transmissions.  ""Breach"" is the story Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillipe), a young FBI employee who had been doing surveillance work on counterterrosism was given a special assignment to work undercover as a clerk to Hanssen (Chris Cooper).  O'Neill is told by his handler, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), that Hanssen is suspected of being a sexual deviant, but the film opens with a clip of then Attorney General John Ashcroft announcing Hanssen's arrest.Hanssen has been recalled to FBI headquarters, supposedly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance.  But Hanssen is suspicious of the move and therefore doubly suspicious of O'Neill.  Time and time again Hanssen tells O'Neill ""I need to know if I can trust you,"" and the answer of course is ""no.""  The dynamic of this film is that O'Neill starts off behind the story until he sees through the cover story that Hanssen is a sexual deviant and is brought up to speed by Burroughs.  Then he has to get ahead of Hanssen.  According to the commentary track by director Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"") and the real Eric O'Neill, this is the biggest change from what really happened because O'Neill was told Hanssen was under suspicion but not that the FBI already had hard evidence of espionage.  But the main part of the investigation being run by Burroughs is happening mostly in the background of this film, where the emphasis is on the cat and mouse game taking place between Hanssen and O'Neill.  The FBI has 500 people on this case, but only one of them is stuck in the room with the guy all day.Chris Cooper's dominating performance carries this movie.  It is not that Phillipe's performance is bad, but neither he nor anybody else stands a chance being in a scene with Cooper in this movie (Linney comes the closest, but technically she is never actually IN a scene with Cooper: you will see what I mean when you watch the film).  I know this movie came out in February and that performances early in the calendar year tend to be forgotten (prime case in point, Joan Allen in ""The Upside of Anger""), but Cooper should at least earn a nomination for Best Actor for his work in this film.  On one of the bonus features director Ray talks about he was looking for an actor who was somebody you would not want to think you were an idiot, which certainly defines Chris Cooper.  This is a marvelously nuanced performance and when you feel yourself feeling sympathetic towards Hanssen you know exactly how great of a job Cooper is doing playing this guy.  ""Breach"" is not really an action film and so it comes down to the performances and it is because of the superb work by Cooper (and Linney), as well as the excellent commentary track that pays equal attention to the performances and the true story that in the end I round up.The movie backs off on the ""why"" behind Hanssen's actions, perhaps ultimately that is not what the film is about, even though a scene is shot for the end of the movie to provide broad hints.  So there is plenty for you to debate the matter in your own mind as to why Hanssen did what he did.  One of the bonus features on the DVD is a ""Dateline"" report on ""The Mole"" (aired between Hanssen's arrest and his conviction in 2001), that does a nice job of getting into some of the details of how Hanssen pulled this off for so long and stuff that happened way before the movie starts (kudos to Linney for her work as mistress of exposition in this film).  Final Note: I do not think I have seen this before on a DVD but there are sub-titles for the commentary track.  I usually like to have the movie sub-titles on while listening to the commentary and here you can actually do it the other way around if that strikes your fancy.  Just pick the 4th subtitle track instead of the 1st.",5,Chris Cooper's Oscar worthy performance as the spy Robert Hanssen,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,4254,"['Robert', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'arrested', '2001', 'pled', 'guilty', '15', 'counts', 'espionage', 'regards', 'having', 'sold', 'American', 'secrets', 'Moscow', '1.4', 'million', 'cash', 'over', '15-year', 'period', 'Hanssen', 'activities', 'have', 'been', 'described', 'possibly', 'worst', 'intelligence', 'disaster', 'US', 'history', 'including', 'leaking', 'names', 'doubles', 'agents', 'continuity', 'government', 'plan', 'case', 'Soviet', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'American', 'methods', 'intercepting', 'Soviet', 'transmissions', 'Breach', 'story', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'young', 'FBI', 'employee', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'surveillance', 'work', 'counterterrosism', 'was', 'given', 'special', 'assignment', 'work', 'undercover', 'clerk', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', ""O'Neill"", 'told', 'handler', 'Kate', 'Burroughs', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Hanssen', 'suspected', 'being', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'film', 'clip', 'then', 'Attorney', 'General', 'John', 'Ashcroft', 'announcing', 'Hanssen', 'arrest.Hanssen', 'been', 'recalled', 'FBI', 'headquarters', 'supposedly', 'head', 'up', 'new', 'division', 'specializing', 'Information', 'Assurance', 'Hanssen', 'suspicious', 'move', 'therefore', 'doubly', 'suspicious', ""O'Neill"", 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'Hanssen', ""O'Neill"", 'need', 'know', 'can', 'trust', 'answer', 'course', 'dynamic', 'film', ""O'Neill"", 'story', 'cover', 'story', 'Hanssen', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'brought', 'up', 'speed', 'Burroughs', 'Then', 'get', 'ahead', 'Hanssen', 'According', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'real', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'biggest', 'change', 'what', 'really', 'happened', ""O'Neill"", 'was', 'told', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'suspicion', 'not', 'FBI', 'already', 'had', 'hard', 'evidence', 'espionage', 'main', 'part', 'investigation', 'being', 'run', 'Burroughs', 'happening', 'mostly', 'background', 'film', 'where', 'emphasis', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'taking', 'place', 'Hanssen', ""O'Neill"", 'FBI', '500', 'people', 'case', 'only', 'one', 'stuck', 'room', 'guy', 'day.Chris', 'Cooper', 'dominating', 'performance', 'movie', 'not', 'Phillipe', 'performance', 'bad', 'anybody', 'else', 'chance', 'being', 'scene', 'Cooper', 'movie', 'Linney', 'closest', 'technically', 'never', 'actually', 'scene', 'Cooper', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'know', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'February', 'performances', 'early', 'calendar', 'year', 'tend', 'be', 'forgotten', 'prime', 'case', 'point', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'Cooper', 'should', 'least', 'earn', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'work', 'film', 'one', 'bonus', 'features', 'director', 'Ray', 'talks', 'was', 'looking', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'somebody', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'think', 'were', 'idiot', 'certainly', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'marvelously', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'when', 'feel', 'feeling', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Hanssen', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'great', 'job', 'Cooper', 'doing', 'playing', 'guy', 'Breach', 'not', 'really', 'action', 'film', 'down', 'performances', 'superb', 'work', 'Cooper', 'Linney', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track', 'equal', 'attention', 'performances', 'true', 'story', 'end', 'round', 'up.The', 'movie', 'backs', 'off', 'why', 'Hanssen', 'actions', 'perhaps', 'ultimately', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'even', 'scene', 'shot', 'end', 'movie', 'provide', 'broad', 'hints', 'plenty', 'debate', 'matter', 'own', 'mind', 'why', 'Hanssen', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'One', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Dateline', 'report', 'Mole', 'aired', 'Hanssen', 'arrest', 'conviction', '2001', 'nice', 'job', 'getting', 'details', 'how', 'Hanssen', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'long', 'stuff', 'happened', 'way', 'movie', 'kudos', 'Linney', 'work', 'mistress', 'exposition', 'film', 'Final', 'Note', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'DVD', 'are', 'sub-titles', 'commentary', 'track', 'usually', 'like', 'have', 'movie', 'sub-titles', 'listening', 'commentary', 'here', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'other', 'way', 'fancy', 'Just', 'pick', '4th', 'subtitle', 'track', 'instead', '1st']",N/A

Previously, he'd directed ""Shattered Glass"" and written screenplays for the filmsHart's War& ""Flightplan.""  Chris Cooper, who had a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Adaptation"" in 2002, plays Robert Hanssen.  Hanssen is a complex character, one adept at masks.  We see him as a loving husband, devoted grandfather and devout Catholic.  Ryan Phillipe, who has played in major films such as ""Gosford Park,"" ""Crash"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"" as well as being ex-Mr. Reese Witherspoon, plays his agent trainee assistant Eric O'Neill.  O'Neill develops a bond with the crusty Hanssen and comes to admire him.  Laura Linney, who was nominated for Oscars for ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000) and ""Kinsey"" (2004), plays O'Neill's supervisor.  We see her as a by-the-book straightlaced bureaucrat with no personal life.  Then she has to show O'Neill evidence of what they suspect with taping his wife, visiting adult websites and selling documents to Russia.  O'Neill snaps into shape and vigorously pursues Hanssen.  Caroline Dhavernas who was in ""Hollywoodland"" plays Mrs. O'Neill, a young bride from East Germany who cannot relate to all the religious emphasis as Hanssen interjects himself into their personal lives.  Kathleen Quinlan whose lone Oscar nomination came in 1995 for ""Apollo 13"" plays the dutiful wife who loves and admires her husband.  Bruce Davison plays John O'Neill.  Davison has had a long career from 1970's ""The Strawberry Statement"" and 1971's ""Willard"" to the two X-Men movies.  Davison has a lone Oscar nomination for ""Longtime Companion"" in 1990.""Breach"" held my attention.

A very strange movie with lots of intriguing details - such as the pen, the boat painting, the Catholic Catechism book on Hanssen's desk, and Burroughs' ""I don't even have a cat"" summary of her work-centered life.  I enjoyed Hanssen's opinions about the stupidity and waste (not to mention the obsese SUVs with only two passengers) caused by bureaucrats and micromanagement. Most of the gov't employees looked sad.The scene in the woods with Hanssen and O'Neill was particularly disturbing. It showed such desperation and the broken-down depravity of humans.The writers bashed Catholics a bit too much, but that's hardly a new movie theme. Lovely soundtrack.Hollywood messed up while attempting to portray gun use - Hanssen was in the firing range without safety glasses (also annoyingly displayed on the dvd cover...I get angry just looking at it). As bureaucratic as the gov't is, I can't imagine that they would allow such a ""breach"" of safety. Even at most public ranges, you're refused entry unless you have the glasses (and ear protection). The other guy had glasses on, so maybe Hanssen just refused to wear them out of spite. Who knows.In any case, a great movie if you enjoy spy thrillers. It's even more fascinating to me because it's based on true events, which add depth and curiosity - I'm now looking forward to researching Hanssen and O'Neill online.

More than great. Hansen's bizarre personality that incorporated traitorous espionage, a powerful interest in porn, and deeply entrenched Christian values is portrayed by Cooper so convincingly that you wonder if anyone else could have been cast in the role.Hansen was finally caught by the CIA in 2001, so this is a true story based on fairly recent events. Ryan Philippe turns in an excellent performance as the young CIA agent who winds up trapping him by coming on board as his assistant, and Laura Linney is, as usual, terrific--here as Kate Burroughs, Philippe's boss--a snow queen who is all business, dead set on nabbing Hansen no matter what. Gary Cole and Dennis Haysbert are also very good as other agents involved in catching Hansen at his game.But this is really Cooper's movie. He should be nominated for an Academy Award for this; he's riveting. This is not a family film, nor is it anything like a date movie.

This is, honestly, my favorite movie. I'm not just saying that to make this review enthusiastic. Usually strong political/espionage movies rely on an intricate and very complex plot twisting, as well as ironclad, spot-on acting. This movie is neither a fiction with insane twists and turns, and the main actor's (not Chris Cooper) performance was criticized. Nonetheless, the idea of putting one of the biggest spy cases in U.S. history onto the big screen is easily figured. The story itself is terrifying enough.

While there are some tense moments where we wonder if the counter-spy clerk will be caught in the act of stealing damning data from his double-crossing boss, there's never a sense of life and death being at stake.  If they fail to find the evidence they need to arrest the mole, he simply gets away with his crimes (or is charged for lesser offenses) ... its not like he will start shooting people or create a terrorist event in retaliation.  While its clearly important to catch the mole, the real damage to undercover agents and exposed secrets has already been done ... there is no impending doom.  In the mean time, the film does little to ""prove"" the case that Hannsen is a spy - this is taken as fact and the plot focuses on how to catch him in the act of a data drop.One thing I found interesting is that Hannsen claims to be an expert lie detector, yet this newbie agent is able to constantly lie to him without raising much suspicion out of this paranoid experienced mole.  Even when Hannsen becomes a bit suspicious, the underling simply lies some more to cover it up.  Just doesn't feel as believeable as it was portrayed.So if you're looking for Tom Clancy-like anti-spy action, this is not the film for you. I think of this movie as more like something you'd see on the History channel... a fictional story that is moderately similar to real events so that you can sense the general flavor of the event and the film director can make some political or social statement about the characters.

1067051,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000OYAT3U,maskirovka,"[4, 4]","I think ""Breach"" is a well-made, highly entertaining movie.  I enjoyed it and have added it to my DVD collection.But for people who don't know anything about the case before they watch the film, go check a book called ""Spy"" by David Wise out from the library or the local bookstore.  That is bar-none, the very best book out about Robert Hanssen (there are about five others that are pretty lousy).If you read ""Spy,"" I think you will see that O'Neill's heavily fictionalized account of his participation in the last weeks of the Hanssen investigation is a bit like the fictional story of the actor who played the gravedigger in Hamlet when asked what that play is about.  He replied, ""well, it's about this gravedigger who met this prince with a really messed up family.""What I mean is that O'Neill really did not play the crucial role that the film ascribes to him in bringing Robert Hanssen to book.  For me the true (and historically accurate) drama of the Hanssen case come from two elements the movie ignores in one case and gives short shrift to in the other.In the former case, I am referring to the fact that for several years, the FBI had focused in on a CIA officer as being the mole.  The CIA officer in question was totally innocent and what he endured was a bit out of something that Franz Kafka might write.  Imagine spending several years frozen out of the job you love while the FBI is dangling the possibility of charging you with death penalty offenses.The second case is how the FBI and the CIA got the real proof that Hanssen was the spy.  As Wise recounts, the FBI and CIA had effectively put out a bounty for any Russian intelligence officer who could provide them with the name of a mole.  And in Hanssen's case, this paid off.  A Russian intelligence officer had spirited Hanssen's file out of the KGB records during the chaos of the fall of the Soviet Union and tucked it away for a rainy day.  In the file, was a trash bag with Hanssen's fingerprint on it (he had used it to wrap one of his drops) and a tape recording of Hanssen speaking to a KGB officer on the phone.So if I had made the movie ""Breach,"" I probably would have done it as a miniseries and taken all of these truly dramatic elements in.  As for O'Neill's story, it would have been there too but perhaps in the last half hour our so.This being said:  it's a good spy story, but it's not really that good a history of the actual spy story.",4,"a good spy movie but as history, it's a view through the eyes of a bit player",1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,2429,"['think', 'Breach', 'well-made', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'added', 'DVD', 'collection.But', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'case', 'watch', 'film', 'go', 'check', 'book', 'called', 'Spy', 'David', 'Wise', 'library', 'local', 'bookstore', 'bar-none', 'very', 'best', 'book', 'out', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'are', 'five', 'others', 'are', 'pretty', 'lousy', '.If', 'read', 'Spy', 'think', 'will', 'see', ""O'Neill"", 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'participation', 'last', 'weeks', 'Hanssen', 'investigation', 'bit', 'fictional', 'story', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'gravedigger', 'Hamlet', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'play', 'about', 'replied', 'well', 'gravedigger', 'who', 'met', 'prince', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'family', 'What', 'mean', ""O'Neill"", 'really', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'crucial', 'role', 'film', 'ascribes', 'bringing', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'book', 'true', 'historically', 'accurate', 'drama', 'Hanssen', 'case', 'come', 'two', 'elements', 'movie', 'one', 'case', 'short', 'shrift', 'other.In', 'former', 'case', 'am', 'referring', 'fact', 'several', 'years', 'FBI', 'had', 'focused', 'CIA', 'officer', 'being', 'mole', 'CIA', 'officer', 'question', 'was', 'totally', 'innocent', 'what', 'endured', 'was', 'bit', 'something', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'might', 'write', 'Imagine', 'spending', 'several', 'years', 'frozen', 'job', 'love', 'FBI', 'dangling', 'possibility', 'charging', 'death', 'penalty', 'second', 'case', 'how', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'got', 'real', 'proof', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'spy', 'Wise', 'recounts', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'had', 'effectively', 'put', 'out', 'bounty', 'Russian', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'who', 'could', 'provide', 'name', 'mole', 'Hanssen', 'case', 'paid', 'off', 'Russian', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'had', 'spirited', 'Hanssen', 'file', 'KGB', 'records', 'chaos', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'tucked', 'away', 'rainy', 'day', 'file', 'was', 'trash', 'bag', 'Hanssen', 'fingerprint', 'had', 'used', 'wrap', 'one', 'drops', 'tape', 'recording', 'Hanssen', 'speaking', 'KGB', 'officer', 'phone.So', 'had', 'made', 'movie', 'Breach', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'miniseries', 'taken', 'truly', 'dramatic', 'elements', ""O'Neill"", 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'too', 'perhaps', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so.This', 'being', 'said', 'good', 'spy', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'history', 'actual', 'spy', 'story']",N/A

At the beginning of 2001, Robert Hansen, a highly regarded 25-year veteran of the FBI, had been selling secrets to the Russians for more than a decade and a half. Why did he do it? We never quite know -- but in the last analysis, as Hansen himself says after his arrest, ""why"" doesn't matter. The story is told from the POV of Eric O'Neill, an ambitious junior agent who is assigned to Hansen as a clerk/assistant but who is really trying to help bring him down. Hansen is an extreme Catholic with a highly abrasive personality, a meddler in the private matters of his subordinate, and a ""sexual deviant"" (as another investigator labels him), but Eric still develops a careful respect for his boss. Ryan Philippe does an excellent underplayed job as O'Neill, a taciturn young man who nevertheless has the gift of blarney when it's needed. But he finally decides the Bureau isn't for him, and it's especially not for his wife. Chris Cooper takes center stage whenever he's on screen as the brilliant, brooding Hansen, a demanding devotee of strict standards who ignores all standards in his own actions. The action is minimal -- this ain't James Bond -- but the viewer's intellectual involvement in the complex relationship between the two men make for an absorbing drama.",5,The best spy flick I've seen in quite some time,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1388,"['Even', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'level', 'breath-stopping', 'suspense', 'film', 'considerable', 'beginning', '2001', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'highly', 'regarded', '25-year', 'veteran', 'FBI', 'had', 'been', 'selling', 'secrets', 'Russians', 'more', 'decade', 'half', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'last', 'analysis', 'Hansen', 'arrest', 'why', ""n't"", 'matter', 'story', 'told', 'POV', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'ambitious', 'junior', 'agent', 'who', 'assigned', 'Hansen', 'clerk/assistant', 'who', 'really', 'trying', 'help', 'bring', 'down', 'Hansen', 'extreme', 'Catholic', 'highly', 'abrasive', 'personality', 'meddler', 'private', 'matters', 'subordinate', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'investigator', 'Eric', 'still', 'careful', 'respect', 'boss', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'excellent', 'underplayed', 'job', ""O'Neill"", 'taciturn', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'gift', 'blarney', 'when', 'needed', 'finally', 'Bureau', ""n't"", 'especially', 'not', 'wife', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'center', 'stage', 'whenever', 'screen', 'brilliant', 'brooding', 'Hansen', 'demanding', 'devotee', 'strict', 'standards', 'who', 'ignores', 'standards', 'own', 'actions', 'action', 'minimal', 'ai', ""n't"", 'James', 'Bond', 'viewer', 'intellectual', 'involvement', 'complex', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'make', 'absorbing', 'drama']",N/A

Based on a true story, its characters are nearly archetypical, a fact that gives the film, along with its extensive moral ambiguities, haunting power. Here, it's impossible to get away from the big themes: religion, sexuality, psychology, and professionalism are at full and merciless play.The film is plot and character-driven, without any special effects gloss. Most of it consists of dialogue between Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper) and Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe). O'Neill is assigned to keep tabs on Hanssen, providing detailed reports to Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney). Mysterious deadlines loom, and Hanssen, a veteran of Cold War politics, is a tad suspicious of all the goings-on. Hanssen and O'Neill move from room to room, situation to situation; each scene adds a layer of suspense. Further, both men have intriguing and complex moral selves. These selves are illuminated via startling combinations of beliefs and personality traits.Cooper is amazing as Hanssen. To my mind, he's one of the most fascinating of today's male screen personas, communicating a visible emotional depth and intensity that's fraught with ragged edges. Ryan Phillippe subtly and thoroughly transforms himself through mannerism, voice, and expression. Linney's Burroughs is, on the surface, as hard as nails; a more complicated personality is suggested when she delivers a few moments of much-needed humor, without which the film would be unbearable.Director Billy Ray has made a film that's polished from start to finish. He and the screenwriters tell the story dispassionately, clinically; they give it an ambiance of objectivity but delay final revelations and easy summaries. Tak Fujimoto's photography is just right, particularly during that bridge sequence, when we get a sense of how quietly and in what solitude people can be betrayed. As a whole, the film has a fascinating, music-like structure.The whole thing is unforgettable, and the extras on the DVD are great.

He was also one of the very few who did it for reasons other than money. ""Breach"" introduces us to Hanssen and the world that he inhabited at the F.B.I. through the story of Eric O'Neill, who spent 2 months working closely with Hanssen in order to obtain evidence against him. This account is fictionalized in some aspects, but it strives to be a character study of sharp, duplicitous Hanssen as well as a tense, compelling drama. F.B.I. surveillance operative Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) is assigned by Special Agent Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney) to work under Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), a talented 25-year veteran agent, allegedly in order to find evidence that Hanssen is a pornographer. Eric comes to respect Hanssen's maverick ways and insight in spite of his gruff, threatening manner and eventually questions the case against his boss.The scenario is naturally suspenseful: Hanssen is a master of deception, so deceiving him is a challenge. Eric learns to exploit Hanssen's ego and his obsessive religiosity -he was a member of Opus Dei- to gain his trust. The situation is urgent. The Bureau must catch Hanssen red-handed, selling secrets to the Russians, before he retires in a few months. ""Breach""'s brilliance is in its layered presentation of Hanssen and his professional life. We know the outcome but are captivated by the finer points. The characters constantly lie to disguise their agendas. Hanssen is right about many things, but his ideals are at the mercy of his overwhelming spite and egoism. Hanssen would be a distasteful character even if he were not a spy whose actions resulted in 3 deaths. But Chris Cooper's extraordinary performance inspires the audience's sympathy and our revulsion at the same time. I can't praise this taut, smart script enough, and Chris Cooper's work may be the most memorable performance this year.The DVD (Universal 2007): There are 3 featurettes, 2 alternate and 8 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and an audio commentary by writer/director Billy Ray and the real Eric O'Neill. ""Breaching the Truth"" (10 min) interviews the director, creative team, cast and the real Eric O'Neill and wife Juliana about how the movie came to be made and challenges of making a film about real people and events. In ""Anatomy of a Character"" (7 min), Chris Cooper, Billy Ray, and Eric O'Neill talk about the character of Hanssen, including preparation for the role. ""The Mole"" (19 min) is a production about the Hanssen case that aired on ""Dateline"" in March 2001 which offers more detail about his espionage. The audio commentary by Billy Ray and Eric O'Neill is good. They take us through each scene, Ray discussing his intentions, story, characters, sets, and what is fictionalized. O'Neill talks about his experiences with the Hanssen case.

It's been awhile since I read the outstanding book, but I think some of the characterization may have been a little overplayed. It was not overplayed by the acting of Chris Cooper, but the lines he was given were a little cliche for my tastes.  The lines were a little too easy in parts.  A little too quick.  I would've preferred more characterization and less over the top lines.  I understand the constraints of time and all that, but the rest of the movie was drawn out and careful.  The characterization of Hanson was given less effort than I would've liked, and the kid's character was given more.  I was less interested in the kid's character. Having said all that, the movie does an excellent job of portraying a story some of us knew well before we entered the theater. Another complaint I have is when Robert Hanson is caught, he delivers an excellent line that wrapped up the story so well: ""What took you so long?"" I believe the line the screenwriters chose was: ""Now, maybe, you'll listen to me."" It's a decent line, but the real line was so much better. I'm not sure why the screenwriters didn't use it. The kid in the movie is good, but Cooper steals the show with his subtlety. Chris Cooper is excellent.

But the review's title still applies as we embark on the saga that culminated in the capture of former FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who had been selling secrets to the Soviet Union and Russia for many years, his actions directly causing the deaths of multiple U.S. assets overseas.  In the center of the investigation is FBI newcomer Eric O'Neill, played here by Ryan Phillippe.  He is tasked with directly spying on Hanssen, played by Chris Cooper, working undercover as Hanssen's clerk.  First and foremost, this film works because Ryan Phillippe and Chris Cooper work well together on the screen, even when they're not supposed to.  You can see the growing bond that plays against the knowledge that one of these men is committing one of the greatest breaches of intelligence in U.S. history.  It's a plot device that will have you on the edge of your seats right up to the very last scene...and I do mean the very last scene...sorry, no spoilers.  It's nice to see that this film stuck so closely to what really happened...personally, I can respect it more for that.  Also, I didn't really know any of the cast members (I know, shame on me since at least one of them has won an Academy Award) so I didn't have too many set expectations for how they'd perform.

Any screenplay about Hanssen would be expected to be ion this format but BREACH is not.  This movie is more like a biopic, with the star spy's last few months 'on the job' chronicled from the point of view of 26-year-old Eric O'Neill, an agent-in-training who worked with him for just two months.O'Neill at first admired and sympathized with Hanssen, who seemed like a somewhat-wronged, brilliant, straitlaced FBI man, devoutly Catholic and devoted to his family.  Only gradually does O'Neill (Chris Cooper plays the role well) come to suspect and eventually fear Hanssen.It is this compelling story that makes BREACH a great film to watch-- the suspense, drama, and human interaction are intense throughout.  A dark, chilly atmosphere pervades as Director Billy Ray combines good timing with ambience.Chris Cooper is so engaging as an utterly exothermic Hanssen that this movie should be added to the collection of anyone interested in the genre or just a good drama.

Ditto Laura Linney.Not sure if Ryan Phillippe can act.  Mostly he is not called upon to do it.  He employs the Keanu Reeves ""yes, I am a tree"" method of Comatose Walking Through His Part.  Once or twice, he flies into a rage, and then is pretty good; so I guess he can act, but the director and/or writing stifled him.But it is really the writing that is deadly here.The first principle of writing fiction--or of movies, even factual movies--is: Don't tell, SHOW.This movie lamentably fails at that.  They TELL everything--Hanssen's supposed sexual peccadillos, Hanssen's supposed betrayal of ""turned"" foreign agents, Hanssen's supposed revelation of ""important"" U.S. info.(One piece is: Where the government is to go in an emergency.  The Prez here; the V Prez there; the Congress somewhere else.  Given the lamentable performance of all these parties, it might be better if they WEREN'T protected.)But these are not shown, only talked about.In fact the movie is nothing but talk, and dull talk at that.Chris Cooper does his best, but Hanssen, in the end, seems less a person than simply a rigid tangle of neuroses.  He has all the empathy of a mortar shell, so we hardly lament his fall.It's not tragic, but neither is it satisfying: he seems less a traitor than a candidate for the psychiatrist.And the whole question of ""treason"" and ""duty"" is so remote, that the movie seems less about heroics than about an insular club with no reference outside itself.The ultimate effect (unintended, I think) is: the Spy World is a completely insular world; it has no real effect on anything but other spies.This is probably true--expensive (and this case, dull) entertainment.",1,Deadly,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,1906,"['ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Hanssen', 'life', 'capture', 'were', 'really', 'dull', 'movie', 'just', 'dull.But', 'dull', 'dull', 'dull.The', 'actors', 'are', 'good.Chris', 'Cooper', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'not', 'much', 'work', 'Ditto', 'Laura', 'Linney.Not', 'sure', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'can', 'act', 'Mostly', 'not', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'yes', 'am', 'tree', 'method', 'Comatose', 'Walking', 'Part', 'Once', 'twice', 'rage', 'then', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'guess', 'can', 'act', 'director', 'and/or', 'writing', 'stifled', 'him.But', 'really', 'writing', 'deadly', 'here.The', 'first', 'principle', 'writing', 'fiction', 'movies', 'even', 'factual', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'SHOW.This', 'movie', 'lamentably', 'TELL', 'everything', 'Hanssen', 'supposed', 'sexual', 'peccadillos', 'Hanssen', 'supposed', 'betrayal', 'turned', 'foreign', 'agents', 'Hanssen', 'supposed', 'revelation', 'important', 'U.S', 'info', 'One', 'piece', 'Where', 'government', 'go', 'emergency', 'Prez', 'here', 'V', 'Prez', 'Congress', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Given', 'lamentable', 'performance', 'parties', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'WERE', ""N'T"", 'protected', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'only', 'talked', 'about.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'nothing', 'talk', 'dull', 'talk', 'that.Chris', 'Cooper', 'best', 'Hanssen', 'end', 'less', 'person', 'simply', 'rigid', 'tangle', 'neuroses', 'empathy', 'mortar', 'shell', 'hardly', 'lament', 'fall.It', 'not', 'tragic', 'satisfying', 'less', 'traitor', 'candidate', 'psychiatrist.And', 'whole', 'question', 'treason', 'duty', 'so', 'remote', 'movie', 'less', 'heroics', 'insular', 'club', 'reference', 'itself.The', 'ultimate', 'effect', 'unintended', 'think', 'Spy', 'World', 'completely', 'insular', 'world', 'real', 'effect', 'anything', 'other', 'spies.This', 'probably', 'true', 'expensive', 'case', 'dull', 'entertainment']",N/A

In the very early years of the George W. Bush administration, before 9/11, the arrest of Hansen was a big story.  I called him a traitor, rather than a double agent, because the extent of the damage he caused to the US intelligence efforts over a couple of decades was in the billions of dollars and also probably cost the lives of several KGB agents who were working for the US.BREACH doesn't quite tell us exactly why Hansen did what he did, but it certainly creates a complex personality and  gives us enough clues to draw our own conclusions.  As portrayed by the brilliantly cast Chris Cooper, Hansen is highly intelligent, extremely intuitive, bitter, deeply religious, deeply paranoid, socially awkward, not well liked by his peers and also into some kinky stuff.  Yet, despite his personality difficulties, he seems to be a top-notch performer and an invaluable asset.  My guess would be that Hansen didn't feel valued ENOUGH b y the US, so he made himself important to the Russians.Laura Linney (in one of her patented terse, tart performances that doesn't stretch her in the least) plays the primary agent in charge of finally proving Hansen is their man.  He's been a suspect for awhile...but there's no proof.  Linney conceives of an idea to place a green but up-and-coming young intelligence officer in Cooper's office as his new assistant.  Ryan Phillipe, whom I don't always like too much, is very good.  He comes into the film as a guy confident that he's got a lot to offer...he's got a great wife, great clothes, great brain and a lot of swagger.  But as he is essentially confined to a small office with Cooper (as sterile and unexciting an office as there could possibly be!), the two men begin to affect each other.  First, Hansen belittles his new helper, but Phillipe actually learns from this experiences man, and even begins to doubt that there is anything nefarious about him.  But Hansen also begins to espouse his deeply held religious beliefs on Phillipe.  Both men are Catholics, but Hansen is devoted to a fault...attending mass every day.  His recommended cure for stress or pressure at work...""pray more.""Eventually, Phillipe ingratiates himself to some extent with his new boss...and Hansen loosens up just a little.  He comes to trust this young man (as much as he can trust anyone)...and takes a somewhat unhealthy interest in his life and particularly in his wife.One can't quite call this a cat and mouse game...because Hansen isn't chasing Phillipe.  Nor is it a battle of wits, exactly, because Hansen clearly is superior there as well.  But it's a battle of Phillipe's native wit and  blazingly fast thinking on his feet vs. Hansen's analytical, experience brain.Obviously, you know how this turns out...but it is the journey that is fascinating.  The movie is very well written, and the direction is simple and clean.  Most of the movie belongs to these two men.  While Phillipe holds up his end very well, it is Chris Cooper, in an award-worthy performance, who steals the show.  It is far from a flashy performance...this guy is the best actor I've ever seen to have so little charisma (although he sure turned his charisma ON in ADAPTATION!).  He always looks vaguely like he has an upset stomach.  He brings a particular sourness to this role, combined with great intelligence.  It is as complete a characterization as one could ever hope to see in a movie.  He's so riveting, that when he IS finally apprehended...you can't help but feel just a little sad seeing it coming to an end.I'd also like to compliment Gary Cole's work as a peer of Hansen's, along with Kathleen Quinlan in a small but effective turn as Hansen's wife.  Also excellent is Caroline Dhavernas in a critical supporting role as Phillipe's wife...I look forward seeing more of her in the future.This is not an action-packed movie...but it is certainly one of the most exciting and intelligent thrillers to come along in a long time.  I very heartily recommend it for adult viewers.Also, whenever  I see a ""non-fiction"" movie, I always wonder how close to the truth it may have been.

The dirty little secret at CIA is that Ames was not the only traitor, a brand new career trainee gave up ten or so of our Soviet agents in place, all killed.  In this movie, the damage that Hansen did is severely over-stated, and the facts of the matter are not as they should be, but I still give this a five star rating because the movies is absolutely top notch on the personality details.This movie is much superior to The Good Shepard.  The only other spy movies that really come close are those featuring Alec Guiness as George Smiley.The reviewers that cannot understand motive will never understand spys and traitors.  One line in this movie really grabbed me--in it, Hansen talks about how ""the US can be likened to a powerfully built but retarded child.""  Throughout the movie, Hansen is cast as a devout even obsessive Catholic who cannot get people inside the FBI to realize how vulnerable they are, and ultimately I would conclude from the movie that the motivation may have started as a desire to prove a point, then a slow burn into addiction--making fools of those that would not listen.The movie misrepresents the clerk as counter-spy.  The FBI actually caught Hansen by going through his trash and finding the one note that he failed to destroy.  Still and all the individual depictions, from the hardened solitary female senior special agent with no one in her life, not even a cat, to various others, are excellent.  Especially meaningful to me is the depiction of the loving wife that becomes suspicious and then unloving because she confuses her husband's loyalty to duty and secrecy with inattention and being scorned, and of course that is rarely the case.  Spies need loving trusting wives.This and ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" are first rate.  Anything with Alec Guiness as George Smiley is first rate.

1067083,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B000OYAT3U,Royce Callaway,"[1, 2]","I liked this movie and would certainly  recommend it.  Like the Good Shepard this is a movie about betrayal, secrets, and the corrosive nature of secrets.  Soldiers risk their lives in service to their country but others risk their honor and pay a terrible psychological price when it goes badly.  That is what we see in this film as O'Neil forms a friendship with Hanssen and grows to respect him, but ultimately destroys him through a betrayal of that friendship.  O'Neil like a soldier places the country above self and pays the price.  The screen play touches on these and many themes but doesn't explore them in any depth.  Ironically the flaw in the movie is the screen play,which is actually well done.  Unfortunately the screen play follows the actual events very closely but in doing so, it lacks excitement.  It is well written and well acted with Cooper and Phillippe and the entire cast doing a very good job.  They really demonstrate the complexity of the characters and make them very human.  Unfortunately the screen play fails to provide any background story.  The movie would have been greatly enhanced had it provided some insight into the impact of the actual betrayal.  Showing how Hanssen headed the search for himself would also have given the screen play some excitment.  Instead the movie focuses only on the last couple of months of the search.  There are flashes of humor, the puritanical views of Hanssen, and some good advice from the father. For those with experience in the corporate world the theft of the computers, the turf battles, and the new guys getting all of the junky furniture and computers really gave the movie a feeling of reality.  This was a very good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I only gave it four stars because it could have been so much better.

The focus, kept tight, is on his clerk's (Ryan Phillipe) role in the case.  The downloading of the palm pilot was evidently important, but one senses the FBI probably already had him -- and that is kind of missing from the movie. Still, spy stories, by their very nature, are convoluted things, and trying to tell all in two hours is tough to do.  From that point of view, ""Breach"" succeeds where ""The Good Shepherd"" fails. ""Breach"" does clearly suggest that there is more to the story and the case -- than Eric O'Neil (the clerk) is aware of. On the other hand, the movie seems ""small,"" like a good made for tv movie.  And there are a few scenes that seem contrived beyond belief (elevator scene at the end) that almost had me giving this 3 stars.  What elevates this moive however is the outstanding cast: Chris Cooper, Laura Linney, Phillipe, the always fine Gary Cole, and others.  They're all very good, but Cooper in particular gives a great performance that makes this a must-see if you like spy stories. The actor seems to have nailed the overall weirdness of Hanssen(kinky sex fascination, super conservative Catholic, spy for an atheistic regime), a man of so many contradictions that ultimately he has no center at all.  Hanssen would be a good candidate for Eliot's ""hollow men,"" and thus the worst person to ask as to why he did it. He probably is incapable of giving the same answer as to the Why twice, which makes him, as Le Carre put it, the ""perfect spy.""",4,Good spy story,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,1549,"['Breach', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'telling', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'espionage', 'case', 'focus', 'kept', 'tight', 'clerk', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'role', 'case', 'downloading', 'palm', 'pilot', 'was', 'evidently', 'important', 'one', 'FBI', 'probably', 'already', 'had', 'kind', 'missing', 'movie', 'Still', 'spy', 'stories', 'very', 'nature', 'are', 'convoluted', 'things', 'trying', 'tell', 'two', 'hours', 'tough', 'do', 'From', 'point', 'view', 'Breach', 'where', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Breach', 'clearly', 'suggest', 'more', 'story', 'case', 'Eric', ""O'Neil"", 'clerk', 'aware', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'small', 'good', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'seem', 'contrived', 'belief', 'elevator', 'scene', 'end', 'almost', 'had', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'What', 'moive', 'however', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Phillipe', 'always', 'fine', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'others', ""'re"", 'very', 'good', 'Cooper', 'particular', 'great', 'performance', 'must-see', 'like', 'spy', 'stories', 'actor', 'have', 'nailed', 'overall', 'weirdness', 'Hanssen', 'kinky', 'sex', 'fascination', 'super', 'conservative', 'Catholic', 'spy', 'atheistic', 'regime', 'man', 'so', 'many', 'contradictions', 'ultimately', 'center', 'Hanssen', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'candidate', 'Eliot', 'hollow', 'men', 'thus', 'worst', 'person', 'ask', 'why', 'did', 'probably', 'incapable', 'giving', 'same', 'answer', 'Why', 'twice', 'Le', 'Carre', 'put', 'perfect', 'spy']",N/A

The trouble was that he did his spying for the Soviet Union. He was only brought to book in 2001, after 500 operatives had spent months stealthily investigating him.Hanssen had spilt secrets for some 22 years during the Cold War and was clearly more intelligent than most of those who suspected him.

He was also, amazingly enough, a devout Catholic and a member of Opus Dei.Such a story would seem to lend itself to a thrilling movie.

The Russians had intimated there was a mole to the Americans,but didn't have his name(Hansen used aliases,never met them face-to-face).Linney is O'Neill's supervisor.Chris Cooper captures the angry,brooding intensity of this embittered man,who is outwardly austere,a stickler for protocol and professionalism,yet a man of deep,Catholic beliefs,who believes he's been overlooked and under-appreciated in his career.He has been promoted to an office job, prior to retirement,in a new division charged with evaluating security procedures around classified FBI intelligence.This is a ploy by the FBI,who have gathered some evidence he's the mole,but not enough,they'll need to catch him in the act making a dead drop.To do this they make Eric O'Neill(Ryan Phillipe) his assistant,with his computer-savvy skills and his Catholic belief(lapsed). Hansen continually tests the young man,who is keen to become an agent.O'Neill has been told Hansen is a sexual deviant and he needs to be monitored.He feels respect for this man,who wants him to renew his Catholicfaith,and takes on a father-mentor role with him and his wife.Both O'Neill and Hansen were married.Their wives are played by Davernas and Quinlan.The story gains strength showing the intertwining of the personal and professional lives.As well as subtle layers of respect and fondness,there are levels of fear and paranoia, handicapping O'Neill's personal life.O'Neill is able to use Hansen's faith against him convincingly.Though the film's perspective is O'Neill,it's the mystery of the complex Hansen that steals the show.O'Neill is informed Hansen is a spy and finds evidence of his sexual pecadillos on a tape.The film is meticulously shot in the areas where it occurred using the real life O'Neill as source.Hansen is impossible to read,it wasn't the money, was it the thrillof the game?or insanity hard-wired into him from years of counter-intelligence,the man's paranoia come to seem a by-product of his faith.We never really find out,being too close to the documentary sources.Quietly superb.",5,Cat and mouse paranoia,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,2771,"['Set', 'year', '9/11', 'film', 'set', 'parting', 'ways', 'old', 'cold', 'war', 'enemy', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'new', 'Al-Quaeda', 'terrorism', '21st', 'century.The', 'film', 'shot', 'blue', 'sepulchral', 'tones', 'set', 'drab', 'government', 'offices', 'FBI.This', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'riveting', 'fact-based', 'drama', 'worst', 'mole', 'American', 'history', 'Robert', 'Hansen', 'FBI', 'operative', 'convicted', '2001', 'selling', 'state', 'secrets', 'documents', 'betrayed', '50', 'people', '3', 'were', 'executed', 'KGB.This', 'film', 'throwback', 'era', '50s', '80s.The', 'FBI', 'suspected', 'was', 'mole', 'never', 'month', 'Sundays', 'guessed', 'was', 'outwardly', 'patriotic', 'Catholic', 'family', 'man', 'retirement', 'Hansen', 'Russians', 'had', 'intimated', 'was', 'mole', 'Americans', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'name', 'Hansen', 'used', 'aliases', 'never', 'met', 'face-to-face', '.Linney', ""O'Neill"", 'supervisor.Chris', 'Cooper', 'angry', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'embittered', 'man', 'who', 'outwardly', 'austere', 'stickler', 'protocol', 'professionalism', 'man', 'deep', 'Catholic', 'beliefs', 'who', 'been', 'overlooked', 'under-appreciated', 'career.He', 'been', 'promoted', 'office', 'job', 'prior', 'retirement', 'new', 'division', 'charged', 'evaluating', 'security', 'procedures', 'classified', 'FBI', 'intelligence.This', 'ploy', 'FBI', 'who', 'have', 'gathered', 'evidence', 'mole', 'not', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'need', 'catch', 'act', 'making', 'dead', 'drop.To', 'do', 'make', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'assistant', 'computer-savvy', 'skills', 'Catholic', 'belief', 'lapsed', 'Hansen', 'continually', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'keen', 'become', ""agent.O'Neill"", 'been', 'told', 'Hansen', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'be', 'monitored.He', 'feels', 'respect', 'man', 'who', 'renew', 'Catholicfaith', 'father-mentor', 'role', 'wife.Both', ""O'Neill"", 'Hansen', 'were', 'married.Their', 'wives', 'are', 'played', 'Davernas', 'Quinlan.The', 'story', 'gains', 'strength', 'showing', 'intertwining', 'personal', 'professional', 'lives.As', 'well', 'subtle', 'layers', 'respect', 'fondness', 'are', 'levels', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'handicapping', ""O'Neill"", 'personal', ""life.O'Neill"", 'able', 'use', 'Hansen', 'faith', 'convincingly.Though', 'film', 'perspective', ""O'Neill"", 'mystery', 'complex', 'Hansen', ""show.O'Neill"", 'informed', 'Hansen', 'spy', 'evidence', 'sexual', 'pecadillos', 'tape.The', 'film', 'meticulously', 'shot', 'areas', 'where', 'occurred', 'using', 'real', 'life', ""O'Neill"", 'source.Hansen', 'impossible', 'read', 'was', ""n't"", 'money', 'was', 'thrillof', 'game', 'insanity', 'hard-wired', 'years', 'counter-intelligence', 'man', 'paranoia', 'come', 'seem', 'by-product', 'faith.We', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'too', 'close', 'documentary', 'sources.Quietly']",N/A
1067094,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000OYAT3U,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","""Breach"" is based on the true story of Robert Hanssen, an FBI operative found guilty of treason in 2001.  For more than twenty years, Hanssen sold America's key intelligence to the former Soviet Union.The film is set in and around FBI headquarters in Washington.  Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe), an aspiring agent, is selected by Agent Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney) to keep tabs on Hanssen (Chris Cooper).  He is told of Hanssen's importance in the area of intelligence.  But he is a sexual deviant, and this might embarrass the Bureau if news of it became public.  Eric is to keep a journal of Hanssen's activities, movements, phone calls, and behavior, reporting back to Burroughs from time to time with updates.Eric is assigned as Hanssen's assistant.  But he is not sure what he is supposed to be looking for, and this serves as an increasing frustration.  He even comes to respect Hanssen for his values, intelligence, and experience.Hanssen is deeply religious, has a devoted wife and family, and is regarded as a genius in the FBI's Intelligence unit.  But he's not a guy who plays politics, and this has cost him promotions.  Now, on the verge of mandatory retirement, he has been put in charge of improving the way sensitive data is stored.Eric's relationship with Hanssen and attempts to gain his trust take a toll on Eric's home life with wife, Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), since his assignment must be kept secret even from her.""Breach"" is an old-style thriller -- one that builds its suspense not from what will happen, but from how events will play out.  Hanssen has been able to outsmart the entire FBI for decades.  Will Eric be able to outsmart him, and what will be the cost if he can't?  The antithesis of James Bond-style films, ""Breach"" has no car chases, explosions, or demonic madmen who want to rule the world.  It is a film about ordinary men who exploit their normalcy either to mask their nefarious activities or to gain trust.Cooper fits the role of Hanssen nicely, doing a credible job of channeling him and all his idiosyncrasies.  A fine character actor who has seldom shouldered an entire film, Cooper conveys just the right blend of dark menace, intimidation, authority, indignation, and intelligence.  He plays the role on a low-key note, rarely departing from a soft-spoken delivery.  It's his way of looking at people that is unsettling.  As Eric states, he is always testing people.  As spy or intelligence expert, he relies on his ability to read a person and separate truth from lie.Phillippe, seen recently in the excellent ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" takes on another meaty role as the man who ultimately becomes Hanssen's undoing.  The role of Eric O'Neill is well defined by screenwriters Adam Mazer, William Rotko, and Billy Ray.  He's patriotic, having chosen the FBI over the military to serve his country.  He shares a Catholic background with Hanssen, who feels an affinity and connection with the younger man.  Phillippe's Eric reminded me of Leonardo Di Caprio's character in ""The Departed.""  Both men are on undercover assignments.  Both have to get the goods on dangerous individuals.  Both find their personal lives suffering because of the stress.Laura Linney presents a tough yet sympathetic boss.  Initially, she is a hard-as-nails, no-nonsense superior, calling the shots, not wanting to be questioned.  But as the film progresses and situations become more complex, she reveals a softer side.  Her transformation from a dictatorial leader to a compassionate colleague occurs naturally and believably, presenting Agent Burroughs less as a stereotype, more as a real person.",5,Top-notch Cold War thriller,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,3626,"['Breach', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'FBI', 'operative', 'found', 'guilty', 'treason', '2001', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'Hanssen', 'sold', 'America', 'key', 'intelligence', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union.The', 'film', 'set', 'FBI', 'headquarters', 'Washington', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'aspiring', 'agent', 'selected', 'Agent', 'Kate', 'Burroughs', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'keep', 'tabs', 'Hanssen', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'told', 'Hanssen', 'importance', 'area', 'intelligence', 'sexual', 'deviant', 'might', 'embarrass', 'Bureau', 'news', 'became', 'public', 'Eric', 'keep', 'journal', 'Hanssen', 'activities', 'movements', 'phone', 'calls', 'behavior', 'reporting', 'back', 'Burroughs', 'time', 'time', 'updates.Eric', 'assigned', 'Hanssen', 'assistant', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'increasing', 'frustration', 'even', 'respect', 'Hanssen', 'values', 'intelligence', 'experience.Hanssen', 'deeply', 'religious', 'devoted', 'wife', 'family', 'regarded', 'genius', 'FBI', 'Intelligence', 'unit', 'not', 'guy', 'who', 'politics', 'cost', 'promotions', 'Now', 'verge', 'mandatory', 'retirement', 'been', 'put', 'charge', 'improving', 'way', 'sensitive', 'data', 'stored.Eric', 'relationship', 'Hanssen', 'attempts', 'gain', 'trust', 'take', 'toll', 'Eric', 'home', 'life', 'wife', 'Juliana', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'assignment', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'even', 'Breach', 'old-style', 'thriller', 'one', 'suspense', 'not', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'how', 'events', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'Hanssen', 'been', 'able', 'outsmart', 'entire', 'FBI', 'decades', 'Will', 'Eric', 'be', 'able', 'outsmart', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'cost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'antithesis', 'James', 'Bond-style', 'films', 'Breach', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'demonic', 'madmen', 'who', 'want', 'rule', 'world', 'film', 'ordinary', 'men', 'who', 'exploit', 'normalcy', 'mask', 'nefarious', 'activities', 'gain', 'trust.Cooper', 'role', 'Hanssen', 'nicely', 'doing', 'credible', 'job', 'channeling', 'idiosyncrasies', 'fine', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'seldom', 'shouldered', 'entire', 'film', 'Cooper', 'conveys', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'dark', 'menace', 'intimidation', 'authority', 'indignation', 'intelligence', 'role', 'low-key', 'note', 'rarely', 'departing', 'soft-spoken', 'delivery', 'way', 'looking', 'people', 'unsettling', 'Eric', 'states', 'always', 'testing', 'people', 'spy', 'intelligence', 'expert', 'ability', 'read', 'person', 'separate', 'truth', 'lie.Phillippe', 'seen', 'recently', 'excellent', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'meaty', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'Hanssen', 'undoing', 'role', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'well', 'defined', 'screenwriters', 'Adam', 'Mazer', 'William', 'Rotko', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'patriotic', 'having', 'chosen', 'FBI', 'military', 'serve', 'country', 'shares', 'Catholic', 'background', 'Hanssen', 'who', 'affinity', 'connection', 'younger', 'man', 'Phillippe', 'Eric', 'reminded', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'character', 'Departed', 'men', 'are', 'undercover', 'assignments', 'have', 'get', 'goods', 'dangerous', 'individuals', 'find', 'personal', 'lives', 'suffering', 'stress.Laura', 'Linney', 'tough', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'boss', 'Initially', 'hard-as-nails', 'no-nonsense', 'superior', 'calling', 'shots', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'questioned', 'film', 'progresses', 'situations', 'become', 'more', 'complex', 'softer', 'side', 'transformation', 'dictatorial', 'leader', 'compassionate', 'colleague', 'naturally', 'believably', 'presenting', 'Agent', 'Burroughs', 'stereotype', 'more', 'real', 'person']",N/A
1067095,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000OYAT3U,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 2]","""Breach"", directed by Billy Ray (who wrote ""Flight Plan"" and wrote and directed ""Shattered Glass"") is based on the true story of how the FBI finally caught Robert Hanssen, the agent who perpetrated the greatest breach in American intelligence. The film features an Oscar worthy performance from Chris Cooper as the American spy.Eric O'Neil (Ryan Phillippe), an eager FBI recruit, submits a report on how he feels computers can help the intelligence community improve their work. Agent Burroughs (Laura Linney) brings Eric in and offers him a new assignment; he will work as an assistant to Hanssen, providing her with information about anything and everything he does. She explains Hanssen is a sexual deviant and could prove an embarrassment to the bureau. As O'Neil gets to know his new boss, he comes to respect him and realizes there may be something else going on here. The man attends church every day, loves his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) and grand children, and is two months away from retirement. Why would the bureau bother spending all of this money to trap someone who will soon fade away into the sunset? O'Neil confronts Burroughs with his suspicions and she reveals the truth. Hanssen has been selling secrets to the Soviets for twenty plus years, revealing classified information, the identity of informants and more. He has caused irreparable damage. O'Neil finally understands and realizes he has to help catch the man in the act. As the noose tightens, Hanssen's behavior becomes more erratic and strange and finally they fear he may not make that last drop to his Soviet contacts, a drop they need to catch him in the act.Much like last year's ""Devil Wears Prada"", ""Breach"" is dominated by one actor and his performance is the main reason to watch this film. It is almost mesmerizing to watch Chris Cooper play Robert Hanssen; a man who we know sold vital secrets to the Soviets, perhaps costing lives. Before he appears, Agent Burroughs (Laura Linney) meets with Eric and gives him a run down of what they are trying to do, what he should expect from his `new boss', basically setting up the character, building our anticipation of him. When he first appears on screen, he does seem tense, conflicted and more. He quickly establishes his feelings about his new posting. He was once the head of the department in charge of Soviet relations and now is in charge of helping the FBI streamline their new computer operations. Bitter? A little.And there are deep trust issues. After twenty something years of working with and around the Soviets, he has become suspicious of everyone. As he and Eric initially begin to work together, they clearly will never be the type of buddies who will share a trip to the baseball park and a couple of beers. But then Hanssen learns Eric is Catholic and Eric plays this up, seeking his boss' help with some theological issues lying about marital problems with his wife. This proves a useful entry into his bosses guarded world.Hanssen is a deeply religious man. He and his wife attend a weekly Latin service and Bonnie (Kathleen Quinlan), his wife, wears a little veil on top of her head. As Eric uses this to become closer to his boss, Hanssen feels he can open up a little, trust his new employee a little.But that doesn't make Hanssen exactly a warm man. He remains guarded throughout, sharing little even with his newly `trusted' Catholic employee.Throughout, we watch Cooper reveal facets of this man's character, slowly, but surely and decisively, making the character one of the most complete I have seen in film for some time. There are frequent mentions of Hanssen's sexual proclivities and these remain in the back of our head throughout. When we see him interact with Bonnie, we can't understand how he would ever be able to make a video of a sexual act between the two of them. Bonnie wears a freaking veil to her church services, how would she ever be able to willingly participate in a sex video?As we watch Hanssen interact with his wife and kids, we begin to have our doubts, along with Eric. Can we stop for a minute and look at this? We all know about Robert Hanssen and know he has been convicted of espionage. Yet, as we watch Cooper play this real-life person, we begin to have doubts about whether he could've done what the government is saying he did. Think about that for a moment. Cooper's performance is so good, so powerful; it is making us question what we know about this person, this real life person.Cooper has always turned in interesting performances, but because he is a bit older, a bit more interesting looking, he remains a character actor. Even after this outstanding lead performance, I have no doubt he will remain a character actor. In a way, this is a blessing. Because he isn't considered a star, he doesn't have to worry about his image and can take challenging roles like this. We are the more fortunate for it.The rest of the cast is top notch, but they remain in Cooper's shadow. The person who fares the best under Cooper is Laura Linney as FBI Agent Burroughs. She is tough as nails and has devoted her life to this agency. In one scene, she has a funny interaction with Eric and reveals a lot about the sacrifices she has made for her career. Ryan Phillippe is good, but he can't hold a candle to Chris Cooper (interestingly, much like Anne Hathaway drowned in the presence of Meryl Streep in ""Devil""). The ads have reported that Phillippe ""holds his own against Cooper"", Richard Roeper stated ""Phillippe deserves credit for playing against his pretty boy image"". What kind of praise is this? It's actually fairly accurate. They are trying to be kind, because they see he is giving it a shot. He could certainly be earning more money portraying the super hero du jour. Instead, he takes on more difficult, more challenging roles in films like ""Breach"". But his performance is nowhere near as good as Cooper's and they share many scenes together. Dennis Haysbert, Gary Cole and Kathleen Quinlan round out the cast, adding much needed gravitas to the subject matter.""Breach"" is also a very suspenseful film. We know what will happen to Hanssen, the film begins with new Attorney General John Ashcroft's announcement of his capture and then shifts to two months earlier. This sets up a `ticking clock'; we are essentially watching how the FBI will trap this individual, catch him at his own game. Because we have a timetable in our mind, the story races towards the inevitable climax. But ""Breach"" surprises us as well, giving us a lot of information about the man behind the story.Writer / director Billy Ray has taken a very small section of Robert Hanssen's life, the last two months of his freedom, and created an illuminating portrait of this unique individual.",5,"Tense, Taut and a True-Life Tale",1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,6762,"['Breach', 'directed', 'Billy', 'Ray',

1067096,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000OYAT3U,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 3]","The Robert Hanssen story--that of an Opus Dei (extremely conservative) Catholic making kinky movies of him and his wife and their sexual experiences is by nature titillating. The contradiction between the rabid anti-Communist and his selling secrets to the Soviet Union is intriguing. So my interest in this case had led me to read a lot about it, and to anticipate this film eagerly.I regret to say I found the film less in line with the depth of the story than I would have liked.To be perfectly honest, despite how much I admire Chris Cooper's acting, I wondered how he could play Hanssen who he doesn't resemble. Cooper didn't let me down (though, frankly, I don't recall from what I read that Hanssen was as arrogant as the character in the film seemed. But perhaps I don't remember that, or that character was made that way ""for dramatic effect.)There was a little discussion in the script of Hanssen's sexual deviance. There was one line referring to his taste for ""a stripper."" That's where I felt the film was less accurate than I'd have liked. And I therefore think the film's theme, of Hanssen's overwhelming, conniving brilliance, was inaccurate. Allow me to explain.The script indicated that Hanssen was so smart that the bureau didn't see through his clever, shrewd planning. In real life, the ""stripper"" issue was a major issue, not just a script one-liner. Hanssen had a relationship with a dancer at a club I'm familiar with in Washington. More important, my reading indicated that he took her to some FBI event in I think Tokyo, or somewhere in Asia, and the FBI didn't notice. Here's an Opus Dei Catholic travelling with a young woman he's not married to and the bureau didn't notice? So one can infer the bureau's ineptitude rather than Hanssen's brilliance.Indeed, authors don't know that Hanssen had more than a platonic relationship with the stripper. And I don't recall from what I read that Hanssen was taking movies of him and his wife and their sexual activities. I think he described them in lurid detail on what was ostensibly his web page. And at least one author indicated that he wasn't absolutely sure it was Hanssen's web page. (All right, there was solid evidence that it was--or couldn't have been someone else's--but it wasn't cut and dry). But movie or not, sexual or not, something pretty blatant, something a school kid would have noticed the bureau didn't see. I'm afraid in that sense, the film left the FBI off with much less guilt than I would have.My spouse was concerned that there wasn't enough discussion of Opus Dei and Hanssen's affliation therewith. Indeed, in one of the deleted scenes, there was a little more said about Hanssen's daughter sleeping on a board, for example. But to me that wasn't something the script needed to dwell on more than it did.Overall it was a pretty good thriller, the type that keeps you on the edge of your seat despite your knowing what's going to happen. And the bonus material asks some of Hanssen's colleagues why they think Hanssen did what he did. While I won't give away their answers, they seem pretty reasonable. But if you want a more accurate view of what happened, I suggest you read many of the fine books available on the subject.",3,A little disappointing,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,3226,"['Robert', 'Hanssen', 'story', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'Catholic', 'making', 'kinky', 'movies', 'wife', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'nature', 'titillating', 'contradiction', 'rabid', 'anti-Communist', 'selling', 'secrets', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'intriguing', 'So', 'interest', 'case', 'had', 'led', 'read', 'lot', 'anticipate', 'film', 'regret', 'say', 'found', 'film', 'less', 'line', 'depth', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'liked.To', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'how', 'much', 'admire', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'acting', 'wondered', 'how', 'could', 'play', 'Hanssen', 'who', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Cooper', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'read', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'as', 'arrogant', 'character', 'film', 'seemed', 'perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'character', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'was', 'little', 'discussion', 'script', 'Hanssen', 'sexual', 'deviance', 'was', 'one', 'line', 'referring', 'taste', 'stripper', 'where', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'accurate', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'therefore', 'think', 'film', 'theme', 'Hanssen', 'overwhelming', 'conniving', 'brilliance', 'was', 'inaccurate', 'Allow', 'explain.The', 'script', 'indicated', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'so', 'smart', 'bureau', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'clever', 'shrewd', 'planning', 'real', 'life', 'stripper', 'issue', 'was', 'major', 'issue', 'not', 'just', 'script', 'one-liner', 'Hanssen', 'had', 'relationship', 'dancer', 'club', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Washington', 'More', 'important', 'reading', 'indicated', 'took', 'FBI', 'event', 'think', 'Tokyo', 'somewhere', 'Asia', 'FBI', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Here', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Catholic', 'travelling', 'young', 'woman', 'not', 'married', 'bureau', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'one', 'can', 'infer', 'bureau', 'ineptitude', 'rather', 'Hanssen', 'brilliance.Indeed', 'authors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hanssen', 'had', 'more', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'stripper', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'read', 'Hanssen', 'was', 'taking', 'movies', 'wife', 'sexual', 'activities', 'think', 'described', 'lurid', 'detail', 'what', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'web', 'page', 'least', 'one', 'author', 'indicated', 'was', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'sure', 'was', 'Hanssen', 'web', 'page', 'right', 'was', 'solid', 'evidence', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'else', 'was', ""n't"", 'cut', 'dry', 'movie', 'not', 'sexual', 'not', 'something', 'pretty', 'blatant', 'something', 'school', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'bureau', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'sense', 'film', 'left', 'FBI', 'much', 'less', 'guilt', 'would', 'have.My', 'spouse', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'discussion', 'Opus', 'Dei', 'Hanssen', 'affliation', 'therewith', 'Indeed', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'said', 'Hanssen', 'daughter', 'sleeping', 'board', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'script', 'needed', 'dwell', 'more', 'did.Overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'type', 'edge', 'seat', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'bonus', 'material', 'Hanssen', 'colleagues', 'why', 'think', 'Hanssen', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'answers', 'seem', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'want', 'more', 'accurate', 'view', 'what', 'happened', 'suggest', 'read', 'many', 'fine', 'books', 'available', 'subject']",N/A

1067101,A37LWWZBFW2VRH,B000OYAT3U,"Wade R. Goria ""Historian""","[5, 5]","This is a taut, riveting and important film directed by Billy Ray that examines the notorious Robert Hanssen spy case. Even if many of the details highlighted in this film fail to dovetail with the facts surrounding Hanssen's eventual apprehension, co-screen writers Adam Mazer and William Rotko have crafted a screenplay that evinces an intelligent and perceptive grasp of the FBI. Unlike legendary British traitor Harold Adrian Russell a.k.a. Kim Philby, whose commitment to communist ideology appears to have been genuine, or CIA counterintelligence officer and analyst Aldrich Ames, whose motivations were primarily mercenary, Hanssen's raison etre rested in the perverse thrill he derived from manipulating American-Soviet espionage operations - usually in a manner that left in its wake widespread havoc and death..All of the performances of this film are first rate. Cris Cooper renders this very dark, intense, yet strangely sympathetic character with extraordinary skill.  Laura Linney brings substance and some poignancy to the role of Kate Burroughs, a veteran FBI agent who entrusts 26 year old agent-in-training Eric O'Neil, performed by Ryan Phillipe, to entrap Hanssen. One [...] reviewer has lamented the lack of authenticity in the German accent of French Canadian actress Caroline Dhavernas' who plays Eric O'Neal's wife Juliana. While this may have been true, and the paucity of my knowledge of German dissuades me from offering an alternative viewpoint here, Dhavernas seemed to deliver, accent aside, a very strong performance.There is an eerie and depressing mood of realism pervading this film that holds a salient message: namely that the pursuit of power and vainglory by individuals too often impedes actions and policies that should advance the common cause of a more just and orderly world.  Rather than serve the FBI and America as a valuable cog in the wheel of national security,  Hanssen  pursued malevolent and treasonous manipulation at any cost and toward this end, he self-destructed. As he currently serves a life sentence in Allenwood Federal Prison in Pennsylvania,  one cannot help but speculate about whether Hanssen has performed some degree of soul searching regarding the dastardly crimes he committed, or if, alternatively and regrettably, Billy Ray's extraordinary effort here has given Hanssen a further occasion to bask in the spotlight of critical attention that this superb film will surely cast for many years to come.",4,"a taut, riveting and important film...",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2469,"['taut', 'riveting', 'important', 'film', 'directed', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'notorious', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'spy', 'case', 'Even', 'many', 'details', 'highlighted', 'film', 'fail', 'dovetail', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'Hanssen', 'eventual', 'apprehension', 'co-screen', 'writers', 'Adam', 'Mazer', 'William', 'Rotko', 'have', 'crafted', 'screenplay', 'intelligent', 'perceptive', 'grasp', 'FBI', 'legendary', 'British', 'traitor', 'Harold', 'Adrian', 'Russell', 'a.k.a', 'Kim', 'Philby', 'commitment', 'communist', 'ideology', 'have', 'been', 'genuine', 'CIA', 'counterintelligence', 'officer', 'analyst', 'Aldrich', 'Ames', 'motivations', 'were', 'primarily', 'mercenary', 'Hanssen', 'raison', 'etre', 'rested', 'perverse', 'thrill', 'derived', 'manipulating', 'American-Soviet', 'espionage', 'operations', 'usually', 'manner', 'left', 'wake', 'widespread', 'havoc', 'death..All', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Cris', 'Cooper', 'very', 'dark', 'intense', 'yet', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'extraordinary', 'skill', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'substance', 'poignancy', 'role', 'Kate', 'Burroughs', 'veteran', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', '26', 'year', 'old', 'agent-in-training', 'Eric', ""O'Neil"", 'performed', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'entrap', 'Hanssen', 'One', '[', ']', 'reviewer', 'lamented', 'lack', 'authenticity', 'German', 'accent', 'French', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'who', 'Eric', ""O'Neal"", 'wife', 'Juliana', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'paucity', 'knowledge', 'German', 'dissuades', 'offering', 'alternative', 'viewpoint', 'here', 'Dhavernas', 'seemed', 'deliver', 'accent', 'aside', 'very', 'strong', 'performance.There', 'eerie', 'depressing', 'mood', 'realism', 'pervading', 'film', 'salient', 'message', 'namely', 'pursuit', 'power', 'vainglory', 'individuals', 'too', 'often', 'impedes', 'actions', 'policies', 'should', 'advance', 'common', 'cause', 'more', 'just', 'orderly', 'world', 'Rather', 'serve', 'FBI', 'America', 'valuable', 'cog', 'wheel', 'national', 'security', 'Hanssen', 'pursued', 'malevolent', 'treasonous', 'manipulation', 'cost', 'end', 'self-destructed', 'currently', 'life', 'sentence', 'Allenwood', 'Federal', 'Prison', 'Pennsylvania', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'speculate', 'Hanssen', 'performed', 'degree', 'soul', 'searching', 'regarding', 'dastardly', 'committed', 'alternatively', 'regrettably', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'extraordinary', 'effort', 'here', 'given', 'Hanssen', 'further', 'occasion', 'bask', 'spotlight', 'critical', 'attention', 'superb', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'cast', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A

As he looks nothing like Hanssen  the ""suspension of disbelief"" necessary to become involved in the outcome of this ""thriller"" was negated the moment one sees Cooper.Photographs of Hanssen show a burly man with a toothy smile who one could well imagine having 6 children. The ideal type to be a career bureaucrat attending pointless good-old-boy meetings for 25 years. Whereas Cooper is a smaller acerbic type and a born eccentric. Any civil servant with that kind of weird personality would have been sent packing after 2 years of unflattering reviews. (I too write from experience)I believe the producers cast Cooper with the sole intention of cashing-in on his unforgettable performance in ""The Bourne Identity"".  Another sad comparison being the boss lady in both films was played by an attractive blonde.  Laura Lynley never convinced me either she could be a hard-nosed spy bureaucrat (as did Joan Allen).The less said about the nominal hero the better.  This movie was obviously his ""vanity project"".  A small fish whose need or ability to outshine Hanssen made no sense at all.  Except as fiction - to introduce fake-tension into the latter stages of a ""thriller"" which had no natural thrills.What a crazy genius like Hanssen requires is an insightful 2-hour documentary extending way beyond the phenomena  of ""turned spies"".  Orwell's DOUBLETHINK being so common in every walk of life no one can believe a word any politician says.

What was a revelation for me was the performance of Ryan Phillipe as agent-in-training Eric O'Neill who served as Hanssen's assistant for two months and ultimately helped bring him down.  While I thought Phillipe gave a real solid performance in ""Crash"", he was superb in ""Breach"", giving a very subtle performance.  I thought both Cooper and Phillipe had great chemistry and did not try to outshine the material or story.If one is looking for an true life action spy movie, this will disappoint.  However, if one is interested in a great character study of a flawed human being, this movie surely won't disappoint.",5,Great Espionage Thriller,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,1052,"['Having', 'heard', 'really', 'positive', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'watch', 'other', 'night', 'viewed', '4', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'amazed', 'found', 'movie', 'boring', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'story', 'betrayal', 'US', 'trading', 'top', 'secret', 'intelligence', 'Russian', '20', 'years.Chris', 'Cooper', 'great', 'performance', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'work', 'What', 'was', 'revelation', 'was', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'agent-in-training', 'Eric', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'served', 'Hanssen', 'assistant', 'two', 'months', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'bring', 'down', 'thought', 'Phillipe', 'gave', 'real', 'solid', 'performance', 'Crash', 'was', 'superb', 'Breach', 'giving', 'very', 'subtle', 'performance', 'thought', 'Cooper', 'Phillipe', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'outshine', 'material', 'story.If', 'one', 'looking', 'true', 'life', 'action', 'spy', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'However', 'one', 'interested', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'movie', 'surely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint']",N/A

This film involves an in house cat and mouse game where the person put in the roll of cat is a young man hoping to become an agent while the mouse is none other but someone the FBI regards as the man who has been outsmarting the best spies of the Soviet Union for twenty years.His agency handler Laura Linney, who urges caution as the watchword in dealing with the legendary Soviet strategist within the FBI Hanssen, played by Chris Cooper, delivered the last compliment of sorts as a caveat to Ryan Phillippe.  She also reveals that Hanssen is a sexual deviate that gets his kick watching pornography over the Internet.It takes Phillippe little time to learn how complicated and paranoiac Cooper is, based on his own highly religious exterior.  When checking Phillippe's file Cooper learns that he is a Catholic.  He begins asking questions to determine whether he is sufficiently devout and makes a quick visit to the local Catholic bookstore to find literature for him to read.Phillippe is informed at the outset that he is unable to tell his wife, played by Caroline Dhavernas, anymore than that he is assigned to work under Cooper.  By not being able to confide more his marriage is put at great risk.  On one occasion, for instance, Dhavernas discovers her husband watching a home movie of Cooper having sex with his wife, played by Kathleen Quinlan, that Phillippe has pilfered from the superspy's files.Dhavernas tells her husband that she considered Cooper a ""creep"" from the time she met him and deeply resents his efforts, enlisting wife Quinlan in the process, to convert her to Catholicism.Cooper, who is superb at playing troubled types, as evidenced by his role as the thoroughly paranoid, gung ho Marine neighbor of Kevin Spacey in ""American Beauty,"" masters this role by letting the conflicted personality and illness of the spy he plays show without the kinds of outbursts and frothing at the mouth that would occur if played by a lesser performer.  Cooper brilliantly internalizes, making his version of Robert Hanssen appear all the more frightening.Here is a man attending mass one moment, tearfully confessing his sins on another occasion, and becoming drunk, then firing his gun in Phillippe's direction, almost hitting him, in yet another instance.As for Phillippe, the opportunity served him well and he makes the most of it.  ""Breach"" provides Phillippe with his chance to move outside the realm of ""handsome hunk"" to that of highly accomplished actor.  One can feel his suffering as he weighs his obligations as an FBI agent alongside his marriage that is being jeopardized in his total pursuit of helping the agency obtain sufficient evidence against the master spy to arrest him.He begins to wonder how long his marriage is destined to last after a necessary late night visit takes him to boss Laura Linney's house, in the course of which she tells him that she does not even own a cat.  The idea is that the agency is her entire life.So how does it end for Phillippe?  We know without divulging anything how the ill-fated Robert Hanssen ended up.  What about Phillippe?  Will he get the promotion to agent that he desires?  What will be his future within the agency?These are the secrets divulged in the film.  Go see it to learn how it all comes out.  You will be seeing a highly sophisticated film in the process, one done under the skilled hand of Billy Ray, who directed based on his own script.",5,Cat and Mouse Spy Games,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,3723,"['Spy', 'games', 'written', 'professionals', 'such', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'professionals', 'game', 'making', 'living', 'writing', 'down', 'proverbial', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Breach', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'exploits', 'notorious', 'U.S.', 'spy', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'film', 'house', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'where', 'person', 'put', 'roll', 'cat', 'young', 'man', 'hoping', 'become', 'agent', 'mouse', 'none', 'other', 'someone', 'FBI', 'regards', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'outsmarting', 'best', 'spies', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'twenty', 'years.His', 'agency', 'handler', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'caution', 'watchword', 'dealing', 'legendary', 'Soviet', 'strategist', 'FBI', 'Hanssen', 'played', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'delivered', 'last', 'compliment', 'sorts', 'caveat', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'also', 'Hanssen', 'sexual', 'deviate', 'kick', 'watching', 'pornography', 'Internet.It', 'Phillippe', 'little', 'time', 'learn', 'how', 'complicated', 'paranoiac', 'Cooper', 'based', 'own', 'highly', 'religious', 'exterior', 'When', 'checking', 'Phillippe', 'file', 'Cooper', 'Catholic', 'asking', 'questions', 'determine', 'sufficiently', 'devout', 'quick', 'visit', 'local', 'Catholic', 'bookstore', 'find', 'literature', 'read.Phillippe', 'informed', 'outset', 'unable', 'tell', 'wife', 'played', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'anymore', 'assigned', 'work', 'Cooper', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'confide', 'more', 'marriage', 'put', 'great', 'risk', 'one', 'occasion', 'instance', 'Dhavernas', 'husband', 'watching', 'home', 'movie', 'Cooper', 'having', 'sex', 'wife', 'played', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'Phillippe', 'pilfered', 'superspy', 'files.Dhavernas', 'husband', 'considered', 'Cooper', 'creep', 'time', 'met', 'deeply', 'resents', 'efforts', 'enlisting', 'wife', 'Quinlan', 'process', 'convert', 'Catholicism.Cooper', 'who', 'superb', 'playing', 'troubled', 'types', 'evidenced', 'role', 'thoroughly', 'paranoid', 'gung', 'ho', 'Marine', 'neighbor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'American', 'Beauty', 'role', 'letting', 'conflicted', 'personality', 'illness', 'spy', 'show', 'kinds', 'outbursts', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'would', 'occur', 'played', 'lesser', 'performer', 'Cooper', 'brilliantly', 'making', 'version', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'appear', 'more', 'frightening.Here', 'man', 'attending', 'mass', 'one', 'moment', 'tearfully', 'confessing', 'sins', 'occasion', 'becoming', 'drunk', 'then', 'firing', 'gun', 'Phillippe', 'direction', 'almost', 'hitting', 'yet', 'instance.As', 'Phillippe', 'opportunity', 'served', 'well', 'most', 'Breach', 'Phillippe', 'chance', 'move', 'realm', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'One', 'can', 'feel', 'suffering', 'obligations', 'FBI', 'agent', 'marriage', 'being', 'jeopardized', 'total', 'pursuit', 'helping', 'agency', 'obtain', 'sufficient', 'evidence', 'master', 'spy', 'arrest', 'him.He', 'wonder', 'how', 'long', 'marriage', 'destined', 'last', 'necessary', 'late', 'night', 'visit', 'boss', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'house', 'course', 'not', 'even', 'own', 'cat', 'idea', 'agency', 'entire', 'life.So', 'how', 'end', 'Phillippe', 'know', 'divulging', 'anything', 'how', 'ill-fated', 'Robert', 'Hanssen', 'ended', 'up', 'What', 'Phillippe', 'Will', 'get', 'promotion', 'agent', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'agency', 'are', 'secrets', 'divulged', 'film', 'Go', 'see', 'learn', 'how', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'process', 'one', 'done', 'skilled', 'hand', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'who', 'directed', 'based', 'own', 'script']",N/A
1067105,A1E6LTFDBY8AGB,B000OYAT3U,William R. Drake,"[0, 0]","I loved this movie. It portrays the two month period before Hansen was arrested. Hansen had been promoted to a meaningless position and assigned a ""clerk"" who was given the task of spying on Hansen so the FBI could get information on Hansen and hopefully catch him in the act of spying. Because a trial might be necessary, the details of this two month period and the clerk's role were ""classified."" Consequently, the writers of the books on Hansen and the creators of the other movie on this subject (Master Spy)were not aware of the details of this critical period of time or the role played by the clerk. As the movie's commentary makes clear, the movie is pretty accurate, with a few exceptions (Hansen and his wife visiting the clerk and his wife unannounced; Hansen loosing it and firing his gun in the woods). The commentary (with the director and the actual FBI clerk) is well worth watching even though the director goes ""on and on"" praising his actors. All of the acting in this movie is outstanding and Chris Cooper should get an Academy Award.

1067107,AP3B615GM191G,B000OYAT3U,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Many films based on a true story are either hampered by accidentallytheir source material or dragged down by uninspired transition from reality to screen.  ""Breach"" is an exception to this rule by provided high drama and suspense even whey you know what is coming and how everything will turn out.For a basic plot summary, ""Breach"" sees young FBI recruit Eric O'Neill (Ryan Phillippe) tabbed by the Bureau to spy on senior agent Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper), who is both a sexual deviant and a traitor and thus an embarrassment/risk to the organization.For me, this movie succeeded on two different levels:First, of course, is the tension in trying to catch the most accomplished spy in United States history.  Not until the very end of the film do viewers find out if Hanssen is on to the investigators, thus creating suspense in nearly every scene.Second, and perhaps most importantly, is the portrait painted of Hanssen.  There are so many discrepancies between ""Hanssen the spy"" & ""Hanssen the man"" that puzzling through them leads to a fascinating character study.  Without knowing ""the whole story"" (and you won't, unless you have prior knowledge of the case, until the very end of the movie) about Hanssen, you will (at times) actually find yourself agreeing with many things he says/does.  He is an intensely conflicted individual, to be sure, and those types of personalities just translate well onto the big screen.  I give director Billy Ray props for that transition.About the only reason I can't give this film the full five stars (4.5 would more more accurate) is because it could have focused so much more on WHY Hanssen was doing his espionage to begin with.  This is hinted at throughout the movie, but I felt it needed to be better developed in order to take ""Breach"" to that ""next level"".Overall, ""Breach"" is a great flick that tells an intriguing story about a real-life individual.  The acting is top-notch, the suspense/drama is palpable, and the morality issues & character development are superb.

That being said, this is a credible spy thriller that is slowly paced, yet grips you with a tight plot and good acting. The story itself is based on the FBI's efforts in exposing Robert Hansen, arguably the most notorious spy in US history [found guilty of treason in 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment]. Chris Cooper does his role justice, playing a flawed character with all his perversions and moral ambiguities with a certain understatednes that nevertheless makes for compelling viewing. The FBI operative assigned to cover Hanssen,Eric O'Neill is played by Ryan Phillippe who gets a chance to flesh out his acting chops here [considering his lacklustre silver screen performances thus far] and manages to hold his own against a veteran & talented actor like Chris Cooper. Some of the best scenes in this movie are those that show the strong chemistry between the two leads, played by Cooper and Philippe respectively. Both men's characters are fleshed out in the movie, yet it is still Hanssen's character that remains a mystery. There are some good supporting roles, such as Laura Linney's Kate Burroughs [Eric's superior], Dennis Haysbert & Gary Cole.
