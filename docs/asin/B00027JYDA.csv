825685,A1MP4NG18QD5J,B00027JYDA,"Amazon Customer ""vjb3""","[40, 40]","This is a much better collection than I was expecting!  The segments are on baseball (friction), the Teacher-athalon (cardiovascular health), and (only loosely sports/games related) artifacts.  I'm anxiously awaiting the DVD release of a collection with ""Inside Ralphie"", and the one on cardio-health is an ok substitute while we wait.  For some reason, it seems like several of the most popular episodes are yet to be out on DVD... I wonder why?  None of these are particularly outstanding, but they are all quite good and easy to watch, repeatedly, as toddlers & preschoolers tend to want to do.  The manufacturer thinks this is for kids 6&up I believe, but I would say it may be more entertaining for maybe the 4-5 crowd.  My almost-2 and almost-4 year olds watch them and probably don't get most of the science, but it still encourages them to ask questions and they do pick up on a fair amount of the ""simpler"" content.",4,More fun with the Friz,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,924,"['much', 'better', 'collection', 'was', 'expecting', 'segments', 'are', 'baseball', 'friction', 'Teacher-athalon', 'cardiovascular', 'health', 'only', 'loosely', 'sports/games', 'related', 'artifacts', ""'m"", 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'collection', 'Inside', 'Ralphie', 'one', 'cardio-health', 'ok', 'substitute', 'wait', 'reason', 'several', 'most', 'popular', 'episodes', 'are', 'yet', 'be', 'out', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'why', 'None', 'are', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'easy', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'toddlers', 'preschoolers', 'tend', 'want', 'do', 'manufacturer', 'kids', '6', 'up', 'believe', 'would', 'say', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'maybe', '4-5', 'crowd', 'almost-2', 'almost-4', 'year', 'olds', 'watch', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'science', 'still', 'ask', 'questions', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'fair', 'amount', 'simpler', 'content']",The Magic School Bus - Super Sports Fun

Now, scholastic has reissued them and they are now available at a REASONABLE price to anyone.  Check out the other book store or search for scholastic!
