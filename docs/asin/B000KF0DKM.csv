1033348,A1OKNI3GDEP5EZ,B000KF0DKM,"G. Mosley ""Itinerant""","[2, 3]","""Wetback"" is a vital documentary. Instead of a third person presentation of material (a la ""Frontline"") or activist presentation (a la Barbara Koppel or Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock), this is the old first person documentary style. The film maker either is or feigns being a naif at the art of cinema, and he follows two of his real life friends, as they decide to leave Nicaragua for America. The camera and audio just follow, and the outside perspectives come from government ministers in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, as well as safe house operators, and there are extensive interviews with U.S. Border Patrol and the paranoiac vigilante groups.The film maker is honest, but he is also committed to presenting a narrative. His two friends turn back, but his film continues on by simply picking up new migrants to follow. We can never be sure the degree of editing with the interviews, although the DVD provides, on its ""extras,"" copious documentation.I used the documentary for a college class and found, to my dismay, that there was something I had not remembered from the television showings of the film. There is a scene with full frontal male nudity, and there are four or five offensive words.For any individual American, this is a vital documentary.

1033349,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000KF0DKM,Jeffery Mingo,"[8, 23]","I loved DiCaprio's ""Titanic"" because it allowed me to experience the famous sinking and live to tell about it.  Personally, I wouldn't want to have to immigrate anywhere illegally.  However, this documentary gives you a great view of those who take that dangerous journey.The documentary maker said he wanted to make a neutral work on illegal immigration.  By stating little and allowing immigrants and Americans along the border to speak freely, he comes close to accomplishing that.  However, the issue is such a divisive one, that I'm still skeptical whether any work on it could be deemed ""neutral.""Whether it's ""The Odyssey,"" ""Watership Down,"" or today's ""Cold Mountain,"" one sees how the immigrants are going on a journey that has so many spikes in the road.  The documentary states that only 1/10 of the undocumented actually make it successfully to the US or Canada.  We who look at maps can easily fool ourselves into thinking lines separate nations.  However, this documentary shows that in the real world, a trail, a small river, or other very passable landmarks divide nations.  Just because East Berlin was walled away doesn't mean that whole nations can do that.Perhaps I tuned out, but I still don't understand how and why the undocumented allowed themselves to be filmed.  The director is guapisimo.  He needs to act and reveal his body like the director of ""The Gatekeeper"" did.  One undocumented man begins swimming across the Rio Grande in a thong and ends his swim naked.  What happened to his clothes!?  I'm imagining that a naked Latin American walking around would stand out to Border Patrol.The work dismantles the idea of a strict ""US v. Mexico.""  Many of these immigrants were non-Mexican Central Americans who faced difficulties in Mexico.  On American TV, many Hispanic actors and actresses are light-skinned with heavy European features.  Here, people with rich indigenous features are filmed, instead.",3,Seeing the Journey of the Undocumented,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1931,"['loved', 'DiCaprio', 'Titanic', 'allowed', 'experience', 'famous', 'sinking', 'live', 'tell', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'immigrate', 'anywhere', 'illegally', 'However', 'documentary', 'great', 'view', 'who', 'take', 'dangerous', 'journey.The', 'documentary', 'maker', 'said', 'wanted', 'make', 'neutral', 'work', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'stating', 'little', 'allowing', 'immigrants', 'Americans', 'border', 'speak', 'freely', 'close', 'accomplishing', 'However', 'issue', 'such', 'divisive', 'one', ""'m"", 'still', 'skeptical', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'neutral', 'Odyssey', 'Watership', 'Down', 'today', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'one', 'how', 'immigrants', 'are', 'going', 'journey', 'so', 'many', 'spikes', 'road', 'documentary', 'states', 'only', '1/10', 'undocumented', 'actually', 'make', 'successfully', 'US', 'Canada', 'who', 'look', 'maps', 'can', 'easily', 'fool', 'thinking', 'lines', 'separate', 'nations', 'However', 'documentary', 'real', 'world', 'trail', 'small', 'river', 'other', 'very', 'passable', 'landmarks', 'divide', 'nations', 'Just', 'East', 'Berlin', 'was', 'walled', 'away', ""n't"", 'mean', 'whole', 'nations', 'can', 'do', 'that.Perhaps', 'tuned', 'out', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'why', 'undocumented', 'allowed', 'be', 'filmed', 'director', 'guapisimo', 'act', 'reveal', 'body', 'director', 'Gatekeeper', 'did', 'One', 'undocumented', 'man', 'swimming', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'thong', 'swim', 'naked', 'What', 'happened', 'clothes', ""'m"", 'imagining', 'naked', 'Latin', 'American', 'walking', 'around', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'Border', 'Patrol.The', 'work', 'idea', 'strict', 'US', 'v', 'Mexico', 'Many', 'immigrants', 'were', 'non-Mexican', 'Central', 'Americans', 'who', 'faced', 'difficulties', 'Mexico', 'American', 'TV', 'many', 'Hispanic', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'light-skinned', 'heavy', 'European', 'features', 'Here', 'people', 'rich', 'indigenous', 'features', 'are', 'filmed', 'instead']",National Geographic - Wetback: The Undocumented Documentary

1033351,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000KF0DKM,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[39, 43]","Wetback: The Undocumented Documentary is an astoundingly well put together documentary of the lives of people who risk their lives just to survive in this world. As many people know, life in Central America, Mexico and many other countries is exceptionally difficult. Because of near starvation families in these countries must decide if they wish one of their younger men to make the remarkably dangerous journey to the United States in search of money to send back home.I must admit I never knew the extent of the dangers these immigrants face. Even if they are successful, they must practically cheat death several times during their journey. Particularly in Mexico this film shows us how immigrants are not just treated like animals--indeed, they are raped, robbed of all their money and even killed if their captors just happen to feel like killing them.Wetback proves that these immigrants, legal or not, are truly desperate to find a better way of life instead of starvation and poverty in their native lands. We learn that these people, men and women, don't want to be in the United States any more than some Americans want them out! They know they must stay so that their family members back home must survive.For a particularly dramatic effect the documentary Wetback films the hazardous trip of two young men from Central America on their way to the states. We hear them tell their stories when they stop at ""safe houses"" in Mexico and other countries on their way. These ""safe houses"" are run by the local Catholic Churches; but unfortunately they are so crowded that these immigrants can only stay an average of three days.I was struck by just how hard it is for an illegal immigrant to cross the Rio Grande River from Mexico into the USA. They practically have to strip naked and swim across the river while their meager possessions float behind them in a black plastic bag. I presume that they seal off their clothing in the plastic bag to keep it dry; it didn't look like a workable life support device.Of course, we also get an even better understanding of the complex situation when the director films some of the people in Arizona who live near the Rio Grande River and who want to keep these immigrants out. The commentary these local townsfolk provide is fascinating although I can't say I agreed with what they said. I commend the director for being as neutral as possible about the political situation.There is one extra on this DVD worth watching but it is very brief. There is a brief interview with director Arturo Perez Torres; he expresses his view that this is a human situation and that as human beings we must all treat each other with more respect and dignity. I think that he simplifies the situation somewhat but he does have a good point.In short, Wetback is an educational and fascinating close up look at the people who bravely risk their lives--everything--to live the American Dream and make their families back home have clothing and food to eat. I highly recommend this documentary for people who wish to study immigration issues.",5,a humanity film...,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,3071,"['Wetback', 'Undocumented', 'Documentary', 'astoundingly', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'documentary', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'just', 'survive', 'world', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'life', 'Central', 'America', 'Mexico', 'many', 'other', 'countries', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'near', 'starvation', 'families', 'countries', 'must', 'decide', 'wish', 'one', 'younger', 'men', 'make', 'remarkably', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'United', 'States', 'search', 'money', 'send', 'back', 'home.I', 'must', 'admit', 'never', 'knew', 'extent', 'dangers', 'immigrants', 'face', 'Even', 'are', 'successful', 'must', 'practically', 'cheat', 'death', 'several', 'times', 'journey', 'Particularly', 'Mexico', 'film', 'how', 'immigrants', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'treated', 'animals', 'indeed', 'are', 'raped', 'robbed', 'money', 'even', 'killed', 'captors', 'just', 'happen', 'feel', 'killing', 'them.Wetback', 'immigrants', 'legal', 'not', 'are', 'truly', 'desperate', 'find', 'better', 'way', 'life', 'instead', 'starvation', 'poverty', 'native', 'lands', 'learn', 'people', 'men', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'United', 'States', 'more', 'Americans', 'want', 'out', 'know', 'must', 'stay', 'so', 'family', 'members', 'back', 'home', 'must', 'survive.For', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'documentary', 'Wetback', 'films', 'hazardous', 'trip', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Central', 'America', 'way', 'states', 'hear', 'tell', 'stories', 'when', 'stop', 'safe', 'houses', 'Mexico', 'other', 'countries', 'way', 'safe', 'houses', 'are', 'run', 'local', 'Catholic', 'Churches', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'so', 'crowded', 'immigrants', 'can', 'only', 'stay', 'average', 'three', 'days.I', 'was', 'struck', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'cross', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'River', 'Mexico', 'USA', 'practically', 'have', 'strip', 'naked', 'swim', 'river', 'meager', 'possessions', 'float', 'black', 'plastic', 'bag', 'presume', 'seal', 'off', 'clothing', 'plastic', 'bag', 'keep', 'dry', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'workable', 'life', 'support', 'device.Of', 'course', 'also', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'understanding', 'complex', 'situation', 'when', 'director', 'films', 'people', 'Arizona', 'who', 'live', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'River', 'who', 'want', 'keep', 'immigrants', 'out', 'commentary', 'local', 'townsfolk', 'provide', 'fascinating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'agreed', 'what', 'said', 'commend', 'director', 'being', 'as', 'neutral', 'possible', 'political', 'situation.There', 'one', 'extra', 'DVD', 'worth', 'watching', 'very', 'brief', 'brief', 'interview', 'director', 'Arturo', 'Perez', 'Torres', 'view', 'human', 'situation', 'human', 'must', 'treat', 'other', 'more', 'respect', 'dignity', 'think', 'situation', 'somewhat', 'have', 'good', 'point.In', 'short', 'Wetback', 'educational', 'fascinating', 'close', 'look', 'people', 'who', 'bravely', 'risk', 'lives', 'everything', 'live', 'American', 'Dream', 'make', 'families', 'back', 'home', 'have', 'clothing', 'food', 'eat', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'people', 'who', 'wish', 'study', 'immigration', 'issues']",National Geographic - Wetback: The Undocumented Documentary

Under the so-called ""free"" trade policies pushed by various administrations and authors like Thomas Friedman, workers have lost job security, pensions, union support and much else.  In Mexico, highly subsidized corn from agribusiness firms like Cargill have flooded markets and destroyed the livlihoods of small Mexican farmers.  Our corporate media usually avoids challenging this country's power elite, so instead they direct people's anger towards scapegoats.  Undocumented immigrants have been one of the targets of a vicious campaign of caricature and dehumanization.  This film does a lot to put a human face on the struggles of undocumented economic refugees.So much mud has been thrown at immigrants that it would take several films to deconstruct it all, but ""Wetback"" is a good beginning.

We sometimes forget that the boundaries between Mexico and the United States are political and cultural rather than physical. Both nations are part of North America, though quite different in values and laws. As we approach the time when politicians are ready to declare an amnesty for illegal immigrants the film is important. Yet we cannot ignore the fact that as a nation we must maintain borders, and we cannot allow the uncontrolled influx of immigrants. We must also realize that the issue of immigration in the 19th and 20th Century is far different from the issue of immigration in the 21st Century. In this regard the film places too much emphasis on emotion rather than the reality of how are we as a society able to absorb the economic and sociological consequences of this uncontrolled exodus from Mexico. In addition we cannot ignore the movement emerging in the Southwest that views our possession of the Southwestern U.S. States as illegal. There is a strong movement that wants to unite our Southwestern States with Mexico as it was before the Mexican American War. These people are serious in pursuit of those goals making these immigrants different from past immigrants.
