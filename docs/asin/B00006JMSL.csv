718658,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00006JMSL,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","Animation and live action combine in this family comedy, which stars the beloved Don Knotts as Henry Limpet, a meek and bespectacled but passioantely patriotic bookkeeper at a New York shipyard.  The Second World War is raging, Nazi submarine wolfpacks prowl the Atlantic, and poor Henry, who loves both his country and anything to do with the ocean, tries to volunteer for the Navy, only to be washed out for a regular laundry list of physical disqualifications.  That his wife Bessie's (Carole Cook) one-time suitor George Stickel (Jack Weston) has been accepted as a Machinist's Mate Second Class and is currently staying with the couple while on liberty doesn't make the situation any easier for him.  Henry begins to wish he could be a fish; fishes, at least, are never 4-F!  Then, on a day trip to Coney Island, he falls off a pier, and--whish!--he *is* a fish!  A talking, bespectacled fish with the ability to emit a literally stunning wave of sound he calls a ""thrum.""  When he observes an American ship trying to drop a depth-charge on a German sub, he makes contact with its captain (Andrew Duggan) and helps guide the charges accurately, then volunteers himself as a living Naval weapon.  It takes some doing, but with the help of Crusty (Paul Frees), a very well-named hermit crab, and the beautiful Ladyfish (Elizabeth MacRae), he succeeds in helping the US sweep the Atlantic.  But somebody's loose lips may yet sink Henry (if not his ship), for the Nazis have found out that he exists, if not exactly what or who he is.  This funny and charming little movie (a remake is supposedly on the drawing board) is suitable for all ages and has something to say about the importance of finding one's proper place in life.",4,How a fish won the war,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,1729,"['Animation', 'live', 'action', 'combine', 'family', 'comedy', 'beloved', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Henry', 'Limpet', 'meek', 'bespectacled', 'passioantely', 'patriotic', 'bookkeeper', 'New', 'York', 'shipyard', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'raging', 'Nazi', 'submarine', 'wolfpacks', 'prowl', 'Atlantic', 'poor', 'Henry', 'who', 'country', 'anything', 'do', 'ocean', 'tries', 'volunteer', 'Navy', 'only', 'be', 'washed', 'out', 'regular', 'laundry', 'list', 'physical', 'disqualifications', 'wife', 'Bessie', 'Carole', 'Cook', 'one-time', 'suitor', 'George', 'Stickel', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'been', 'accepted', 'Machinist', 'Mate', 'Second', 'Class', 'currently', 'staying', 'couple', 'liberty', ""n't"", 'make', 'situation', 'easier', 'Henry', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'fish', 'fishes', 'least', 'are', 'never', '4-F', 'Then', 'day', 'trip', 'Coney', 'Island', 'pier', 'whish', 'fish', 'talking', 'bespectacled', 'fish', 'ability', 'emit', 'literally', 'stunning', 'wave', 'sound', 'thrum', 'When', 'American', 'ship', 'trying', 'drop', 'depth-charge', 'German', 'sub', 'contact', 'captain', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', 'guide', 'charges', 'accurately', 'then', 'living', 'Naval', 'weapon', 'doing', 'help', 'Crusty', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'very', 'well-named', 'hermit', 'crab', 'beautiful', 'Ladyfish', 'Elizabeth', 'MacRae', 'helping', 'US', 'sweep', 'Atlantic', 'somebody', 'loose', 'lips', 'may', 'yet', 'sink', 'Henry', 'not', 'ship', 'Nazis', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'who', 'funny', 'charming', 'little', 'movie', 'remake', 'supposedly', 'drawing', 'board', 'suitable', 'ages', 'something', 'say', 'importance', 'finding', 'one', 'proper', 'place', 'life']",N/A

Unable to join the navy in anticipation of WWII, Knotts' character lands in the waters off Coney Island and turns into a fish, finally able to help the US war effort.It's a cute blend of animation and film, carefully steered by a director who was involved in such efforts as ""Mr. Ed"" and the Francis (the mule!) movies. You'll recognize the blend of animation and film if you've been watching Disney movies with your kids (although this comes from the Warner Bros studios), and the media jump won't seem as silly as when Sponge Bob surfaces from Bikini Bottom.The younger kids will like it, but it took a little cajoling to get some nine year olds to stick with it until the war scenes - - initially it was beneath them. But adventure developed, and the movie actually brings up themes regarding roles which they were familiar with from movies like The Little Mermaid (is Limpet a fish? a man? what's this mean for his old relationship with his wife, and new relationships with other sea creatures?) I hate to wax overly philosophical about this, but these are the parts which make it interesting for adults. As Limpet-the-fish says, ""There's nothing like realizing your importance to the world to make a man out of you. Even if that man is a fish.""Yes, it has a bit of pathos, but it also has submarine battles, jokes, a crusty hermit crab, cute animation, and a great group of B-grade actors who are somehow able to keep a straight face through the whole exercise. (What may surprise you -- or disappoint you -- is that Knotts' character is never the frenetic, shrill Barney Fife. But he is very good nonetheless, and you shouldn't typecast him.)",4,"A nice soft gem, but don't push it on pre-teens or older.",1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,1785,"['.Don', 'Knotts', 'namby', 'pamby', 'fish-loving', 'bookish', 'bookkeeper', 'Brooklyn', 'married', 'lively', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'relate', 'habits', 'Unable', 'join', 'navy', 'anticipation', 'WWII', 'Knotts', 'character', 'lands', 'waters', 'Coney', 'Island', 'fish', 'finally', 'able', 'help', 'US', 'war', 'effort.It', 'cute', 'blend', 'animation', 'film', 'carefully', 'steered', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'such', 'efforts', 'Mr.', 'Ed', 'Francis', 'mule', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'blend', 'animation', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Disney', 'movies', 'kids', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'studios', 'media', 'jump', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'silly', 'when', 'Sponge', 'Bob', 'surfaces', 'Bikini', 'Bottom.The', 'younger', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'took', 'little', 'cajoling', 'get', 'nine', 'year', 'olds', 'stick', 'war', 'initially', 'was', 'beneath', 'adventure', 'developed', 'movie', 'actually', 'up', 'themes', 'regarding', 'roles', 'were', 'familiar', 'movies', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Limpet', 'fish', 'man', 'what', 'mean', 'old', 'relationship', 'wife', 'new', 'relationships', 'other', 'sea', 'creatures', 'hate', 'wax', 'overly', 'philosophical', 'are', 'parts', 'make', 'interesting', 'adults', 'Limpet-the-fish', 'nothing', 'realizing', 'importance', 'world', 'make', 'man', 'Even', 'man', 'fish', 'Yes', 'bit', 'pathos', 'also', 'submarine', 'battles', 'jokes', 'crusty', 'hermit', 'crab', 'cute', 'animation', 'great', 'group', 'B-grade', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'somehow', 'able', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'whole', 'exercise', 'What', 'may', 'surprise', 'disappoint', 'Knotts', 'character', 'never', 'frenetic', 'shrill', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'very', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'should', ""n't"", 'typecast']",N/A

718684,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B00006JMSL,Jonathan Cohen,"[8, 8]","""McHale's Navy"" meets ""SpongeBob"" with ""Action in the North Atlantic""? Well, that's one way to define ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"", one of the oddest family fantasy movies ever. An early attempt at a live-action/animation mix, it launched Don Knotts' post-""Andy Griffith"" career as the classic ""Don Knotts"" character: a geeky, milquetoast guy who stumbles into a heroic turn in spite of himself. Henry Limpet, of course, is two characters in one: a nerdy Brooklyn accountant who loves tropical fish, and- well- a nerdy, bespectacled cartoon fish!With a WWII setting, he's an obvious 4-F as a human, but becomes an underwater guide for a Navy fleet as a fish. Oh, yeah- did I mention it's also (kinda sorta) a musical?Though released in 1964, ""Limpet"" sounds and feels like 1954- or is it 1944? It's as quaint as a movie can get: old New York costumes and settings, hokey humor, bumbling Navy brass and a super-patriotic musical choir. The animation, the late-model Warner Bros. kind, is a little bland by ""Looney Tunes"" standards, even with a few legendary artists (but no Jones or Friz) involved. And the non-Knotts cast is a little bit stiff on the whole, save old-timers Andrew Duggan and Larry Keating as the stuffy admirals.Yet, somehow, ""Limpet"" works better than described, especially if, like me, you're still fond of old-school family comedy Americana. The story's a cut above most period Disney fare, both animated and live. As a fish, Limpet's engaged in a kind of proto-""SpongeBob"" journey with his purple ""Lady Fish"" friend and a great little creation called- really!- ""Crusty Crab""! A kind of crustacean Yosemite Sam (voiced by great radio/cartoon veteran Paul Frees), he actually looks and sounds a bit like Mr. Krabs- nearly 40 years before ""SpongeBob""!And how does our sea-creature hero, who still looks and sounds exactly like Knotts, interact with humans? Well, after his old Navy buddy George Stickel (the rotund veteran Jack Weston), who keeps getting called ""Pickel"" by the officers, almost drops dead after he discovers that his old friend Henry didn't drown at Coney Island after all, Henry-the-fish serves as an undersea swimming spy on German U-boats and, after a couple of underwater mishaps, helps the U.S. Navy invade Normandy, all to a booming, George M. Cohan-style patriotic chorus! Oh, yes- director Arthur Lubin was no stranger to talking creatures, since he helmed most of ""Mister Ed"" and ""Francis the Talking Mule"".They sure don't make 'em like this any more, and ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"", tacky and corny as it is, just might be a surreal comedy in disguise. Certainly it's one of the few pre-""Roger Rabbit"" part-animated movies that works, awkward transitions and all (no computer tricks here, folks). It also started a new genre, the Don Knotts nerd-com, as perfected in deathless fare like ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" and ""The Reluctant Astronaut"". It's even a light-hearted salute to the kind of old-fashioned Hollywood patriotism that would get shot to Kingdom Come as the '60s moved on. Why, it probably stuck somewhere in Steve Hillenberg's mind when he grew up to draw the SpongeBob crew.The extras are modest (a ""fishtank"" game), but the little promo film, which shows the ""Limpet"" premiere at Weeki Wachee, an old-Florida tourist trap (it's near Clearwater) that involved mermaid shows and glass-bottom boats, is a priceless little slice of old-Hollywood ballyhoo, complete with a few words from Arthur Godfrey- who sincerely thought he'd have a hit with a rendition of ""I Wish I Were a Fish"", the ditty Knotts sings before he hits the drink. Beatlemania saved us from it.To enjoy ""Mr. Limpet"", it probably helps if you still love ""My Three Sons"", Lawrence Welk and other squeaky-clean '60s stuff. But when the Crusty Crab keeps calling Limpet ""Flatbush"" and the bumbling admirals give the fish an officers' commission, you're going to laugh.

(Like we actually just purchased it on Blu Ray while I was writing this review!)Bowling for Movies Score - 245.625 of 300 - a true gem of a silly movie!What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]If you don't enjoy Simply Silly Films (or SSFs) well, you've got no call to go any further - this movie is a Super Simply Silly Film (SSSF!! Which constitutes an entire extra `S' over other less `S' films, so assume what you must from that uncomplicated fact) -  don't even bother to read on.  Now, if like The Movie Dude, you don't mind walking on the silly side of life with no other hope than simply being entertained without the bother of having to think - then by all means read on!What's this SSSF about?Don Knotts takes you on a mad-capped underwater adventure in this classic 1964 farce about a patriotic bookkeeper who is deemed unfit for duty due to his poor eyesight and stickman-like physique during the days preceding WWII.  Mr. Limpet retreats from his rejection into his lifelong hobby - fishkeeping - a hobby his wife detests.  When a friend drops by on leave from the Navy, they all take a trip down to Coney Island where this mild mannered man wishes so hard to become a fish that the unthinkable happens - he gets what he asked for!  Silliness ensues and The Incredible Mr. Limpet makes new friends, finds he has a special talent, and enlists in the armed services as a Nazi U-Boat spotter...  can a man turned fish turn the tide of war?What a delightful ride into the obtuse with the master of all things nervous, Don Knotts.  Warner Brothers did an incredible job stitching together animation and live action seamlessly.  The story is as silly as it gets but children (and people who are children at heart) can easily get lost in the beautiful underwater world.What we loved!The sequences which featured real people interacting with the animated critters were done incredibly well - the actors appear to be looking directly at Mr. Limpet and considering this movie was done in '64 there were no ""CGI-wizards"" to smooth out the rough spots - they had to just get it right!A good natured family flick that's easy to watch; although I have seen quite a few reviews saying the film was a big bore for adults I would have to respectfully disagree - while I did watch with Little Miss Movie Dude we both enjoyed the film togetherI admit I may have a bias - I too have been a lifelong aquarist and have wished more than once to be a fish and enjoy the spectacle of the underwater world :]What we didn't like:When I asked Little Miss Movie Dude she replied, ""uhh, uuhhhh.... Hmmmm"".  Is it a perfect movie - no, its just a simple fun movie from the 60's.  It wasn't written to be an Academy Award winner but it certainly was fun to watch with plenty of shared laughs for the entire family... in this day and age when its more `acceptable' to be mean and snarky it was a great pleasure to watch a movie that simply was silly, laid back, and entertaining.  :]Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

Coming in at approximately #64 on my own personal Top 100, MR. LIMPET is a blend of live action and colorful animation, an impossible fantasy film which somehow manages to entice even the most sourpussed of  viewers. Although it starts out a bit slowly, MR. LIMPET is irresistible, a pure entertainment experience.The fishlike Don Knotts is perfectly cast as Henry Limpet, a nebbishy bookkeeper from Brooklyn, circa 1942. Walter Mitty-like, Henry dreams of being a war hero. His one other passion is his fish tank. When Henry is rejected from military service as a 4-F, he falls into a depression and escapes into unreality by wishing he was a fish.Walking on the Coney Island pier one day with his wife, Bessie, Henry takes a misstep and falls into the briny Atlantic. Lo, and behold!---he is instantly transformed into a (cartoon) fish (complete with pince-nez glasses). Although Henry is initially lonely, he soon makes the acquaintance of Crusty the Crab and the seductive but loving Ladyfish, and sets off with them to explore his new, aquatic, world.During one of his many misadventures, Henry discovers that he is the possessor of a powerful vocal ""thrum"" which can be used as an early warning system. Thinking quickly, he finds the ship his friend George Stickel is assigned to, and convinces Stickel (and the U.S. Navy) that he can act as a sort of secret escort for convoys and naval ships crossing the U-boat strewn Atlantic.With Henry by their side, the Navy is able to turn the course of the Battle of the Atlantic, discovering and destroying enemy submarines and warships by the score. Although the Nazis try to stop Mr. Limpet, he is able to turn their weapons against them.His wartime actions earn him high rank and many honors, and Henry Limpet, having become the fish he'd always dreamed of being becomes the hero he'd always dreamed of being, too.A charming (and oddly gentle) war film, THE INCREDIBLE MR.

The plot's been rehashed in many other reviews, so I'll stick to what makes this animated/live action film such a pleasure.

This early (1964) blend of live action & animation casts Knotts as the title character, a meek accountant with his head stuck firmly in the world of sea life during WW II. So much so that it creates strain with his loving but impatient wife (Carole Cook, terrific here) & annoyed Navy buddy (Jack Weston in a solid & funny supporting role). Naturally, on a trip to Coney Island, the song the picture chirps ""Be Careful What You Wish"" quite literally comes true when Limpet falls off the pier, and evolves (or is that DE-evolves?) into an actual fish, complete with Knotts' overbite & spectacles! Believed to be dead, his wife & friend move on with their lives. From here on, the movie is an undersea adventure as Limpet makes friends with a grumpy crab and begins an unusual relationship with Ladyfish. Along the way, Limpet discovers he has a powerful ""thrum"" weapon, and is soon enlisted by the military to use this weapon in locating Nazi subs. Inevitably, Limpet is reunited with his buddy under the craziest circumstances during his mission with the military. A rousing finale involving a blind Limpet (with Crusty the crab his ""eyes"") using the Nazis' own ""counter-weapon"" to sink their own subs makes Limpet the unlikeliest hero the military has ever seen.While the animation is certainly not up to Disney standards, it's still extremely entertaining.

718714,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00006JMSL,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","The Incredible Mr.Limpet(released Mar/64)stars Don Knotts(better known as Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show)as the star character,Lucille Ball proteg&eacute; Carole Cook as Mrs.Limpet,Jack Weston as George Stickle,Elizabeth McCrae(better known as Lou Ann Pouvey on the Gomer Pyle Show)as the voice of lady fish,Oscar Bereji as the German Admiral and voice actor Paul Frees as Crusty the hermit crab.This was Warner Brothers foray into the animated market at the time which was,more or less,the sole domain of that big juggernaut Walt Disney.Warners,I think,pulled it off with this charmer.It wasn`t well received if I recall originally,but was re-released and subsequently went onto the small screen where it did very well.The plot finds Don Knotts as a hen pecked husband,stuck in a mundane job that he doesn`t particularly like;all this during 1942/43.He absolutely loves fish and wishes he was one;in fact Don actually sings I wish I was a Fish,quite well I thought.The U.S.is getting hit by Nazi subs off the east coast and Knotts wishes there was something he could do.A friend of Knotts,George Stickle who is a seaman in the Navy,visits Limpet and his wife one day and they decide to go to Coney Island.While there,Knotts is leaning under a rail staring intently into the water and falls in.During his descent he magically turns into a fish.His wife and friend consider him drowned,while in his new world he makes a couple of new friends relatively quickly;an old persnickety hermit crab called Crusty and another female fish called,simply,ladyfish.She immediately takes to him but because he is still ``married``,he has second thoughts.She swims off but much to his chagrin he cannot find her,as he has had a change of heart.He tells Crusty to stay behind in the wrecked ship they first met in and keep an eye out for Ladyfish should she return.In the meantime Limpet has come to the idea he can be of great help to the US Navy,as he could spot and lead the American fleet directly to the Nazi subs prowling the waters.To aid in this,he has discovered a talent he originally did not know he had;a booming underwater `shout`.When a naval ship passes overhead he contacts them through their underwater listening device,then above water.They at first cannot wrap their heads around this body less voice in the water.He asks the Navy personnel to get his friend George Stickle,to be their liaison.They get George who rows out by himself and is stunned to see his old friend still alive,presumed drowned,but now in a fish body.After this initial meeting the wheels of progress roll faster and faster.The Navy is able to take out sub after sub due to the help of Limpet and his underwater `boom`.However the German`s also become aware of the Navy`s secret weapon and they plan to stop him.They gather a large wolf pack of subs to take out an important US convoy and to surround and kill Limpet with homing torpedoes.Limpets booming voice fools the torpedoes and he leads the torpedoes back to the German subs,sinking them all.In the end and after the war,Limpet becomes,of all things,a Commodore in the US Naval Reserves and he lives happily ever after with Ladyfish.This film is a charming entry by Warners and Don Knotts voice was perfect in the lead role.He was well supported throughout and the animation is very well done.Technically speaking this film is in either full screen or in its original a/r of 1:85:1 in this dreaded two sided disc.The film is quite clear and crisp.Extras include:An intro by Don Knotts himself,the press hullabaloo leading up to the films premier in 1964 in Florida,a look at the real sea creatures seen in the film,an interactive game and a trailer.All in all this film is a charmer from start to finish.Knotts is top notch as Mr.Limpet and the animation is very good and still holds up quite well today.Recommended.",4,Warner Brother goes up against

The animation is strong, it is full of good characters who are funny in their awareness of the unbelievability of it all, and there are some surprisingly adult themes, like the fact that Limpet's wife may be having a love affair.This time, I watched it with my son, who has a kind of indulgent tolerance of all the ""strange stuff"" I like to add to our DVD library.

718728,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00006JMSL,trebe,"[1, 1]","Don Knotts (1924-2006) had become a comic icon as Deputy Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show.  After winning five consecutive Emmys in the role, some may have questioned his decision to depart to pursue a movie career.  The success of his first feature film, The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964) proved that Knotts was not only a comic genius, but a genuine movie star with considerable box office juice.  Knotts would follow up with a string of hits for Universal Studios, includingThe Ghost and Mr. Chicken(1966), perhaps his funniest film.The Incredible Mr. Limpet is notable, as it combines animation with real filmed footage, and features Knotts in a dual role as mild mannered accountant Henry Limpet, is transformed into a fish that then aids the US Navy in combating Nazi submarines, operating in the Atlantic during World War II.  Although a Warner Brothers production, the film is very reminiscent of a Disney movie, because of its high quality animation, goofy comic elements, and catchy musical numbers.Henry Limpet is fond of fish, and has an aquarium in the New York City apartment that he shares with his wife Bessie (Carole Cook).  George Stickle (Jack Weston), a machinist mate in the navy arrives for a visit, and the three journey to Coney Island for a picnic.  When Henry falls into to ocean while on a pier, he is mysteriously transformed into a green bespectacled fish.The transition from human to animated character is quite smooth, and the new aquatic version of Limpet quickly becomes adjusted to his new form.  He makes friends with Crusty (Paul Frees) the hermit crab, and discovers that he has the ability to produce a powerful sound, that can be used as a weapon or signal. He saves the life of the sexy `Ladyfish', voiced by the sultry southern drawl of Elizabeth MacRae, who is probably best known for playing Lou Ann, in Gomer Pyle USMC.  While Carole Cook's performance is fine, unlike MacRae she doesn't seem a very good pairing with Knotts.The fusing of the live action and animated sequences is facilitated by an inspired idea, as Limpet patriotically decides that he wants to help in the war effort, when America enters World War II.  He communicates with a Navy destroyer and arranges a meeting with his old buddy George Stickle.  Jack Weston is predictably good in his role.  Working through the chain of command, Limpet and his `thrum', soon become the Navy's secret weapon against the Nazi U-boats, eventually becoming the instrument of defeat for the German wolf pack, in a major operation in the Atlantic.The Incredible Mr. Limpet was great family entertainment when it was released, and even with the World War II theme and the slightly dated looking animation, it may still play pretty well with young ones today.  The animated segments are fun, and innovatively combined with real footage.  Knotts' comic persona remains intact, even as a fish.  The story is imaginative, captivating, and ridiculously funny, with the mood amplified by the various musical interludes.  Directed by Arthur Lubin (Mr. Ed), the cast is terrific, the acting wonderfully campy, and the voice work outstanding.The image quality of the DVD is excellent, with ample sharpness, and vibrant colors.  The DVD also features a fun and informative vintage featurette about the film's unusual `underwater' premiere.  The Incredible Mr. Limpet, is undeniably one of the highlights in the career of the incredible Mr. Knotts.",5,Don Knotts' fanciful and fantastic leap to the big screen...,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,3435,"['Don', 'Knotts', '1924-2006', 'had', 'become', 'comic', 'icon', 'Deputy', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'winning', 'five', 'consecutive', 'Emmys', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'questioned', 'decision', 'depart', 'pursue', 'movie', 'career', 'success', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Incredible', 'Mr.', 'Limpet', '1964', 'proved', 'Knotts', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'comic', 'genius', 'genuine', 'movie', 'star', 'considerable', 'box', 'office', 'juice', 'Knotts', 'would', 'follow', 'up', 'string', 'hits', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Ghost', 'Mr.', 'Chicken', '1966', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'film.The', 'Incredible', 'Mr.', 'Limpet', 'notable', 'animation', 'real', 'filmed', 'footage', 'features', 'Knotts', 'dual', 'role', 'mild', 'mannered', 'accountant', 'Henry', 'Limpet', 'transformed', 'fish', 'then', 'US', 'Navy', 'combating', 'Nazi', 'submarines', 'operating', 'Atlantic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'production', 'film', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Disney', 'movie', 'high', 'quality', 'animation', 'goofy', 'comic', 'elements', 'catchy', 'musical', 'numbers.Henry', 'Limpet', 'fond', 'fish', 'aquarium', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'apartment', 'shares', 'wife', 'Bessie', 'Carole', 'Cook', 'George', 'Stickle', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'machinist', 'mate', 'navy', 'arrives', 'visit', 'three', 'journey', 'Coney', 'Island', 'picnic', 'When', 'Henry', 'ocean', 'pier', 'mysteriously', 'transformed', 'green', 'bespectacled', 'fish.The', 'transition', 'human', 'animated', 'character', 'quite', 'smooth', 'new', 'aquatic', 'version', 'Limpet', 'quickly', 'adjusted', 'new', 'form', 'friends', 'Crusty', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'hermit', 'crab', 'discovers', 'ability', 'produce', 'powerful', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'weapon', 'signal', 'life', 'sexy', 'Ladyfish', 'voiced', 'sultry', 'southern', 'drawl', 'Elizabeth', 'MacRae', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Lou', 'Ann', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'USMC', 'Carole', 'Cook', 'performance', 'fine', 'MacRae', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'good', 'pairing', 'Knotts.The', 'fusing', 'live', 'action', 'animated', 'sequences', 'facilitated', 'inspired', 'idea', 'Limpet', 'patriotically', 'help', 'war', 'effort', 'when', 'America', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Navy', 'destroyer', 'meeting', 'old', 'buddy', 'George', 'Stickle', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'predictably', 'good', 'role', 'Working', 'chain', 'command', 'Limpet', 'thrum', 'soon', 'become', 'Navy', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Nazi', 'U-boats', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'instrument', 'defeat', 'German', 'wolf', 'pack', 'major', 'operation', 'Atlantic.The', 'Incredible', 'Mr.', 'Limpet', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'even', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'theme', 'slightly', 'dated', 'looking', 'animation', 'may', 'still', 'play', 'pretty', 'well', 'young', 'ones', 'today', 'animated', 'segments', 'are', 'fun', 'innovatively', 'combined', 'real', 'footage', 'Knotts', 'comic', 'persona', 'intact', 'even', 'fish', 'story', 'imaginative', 'captivating', 'ridiculously', 'funny', 'mood', 'amplified', 'various', 'musical', 'interludes', 'Directed', 'Arthur', 'Lubin', 'Mr.', 'Ed', 'cast', 'terrific', 'acting', 'wonderfully', 'campy', 'voice', 'work', 'outstanding.The', 'image', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'ample', 'sharpness', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'DVD', 'also', 'fun', 'informative', 'vintage', 'featurette', 'film', 'unusual', 'underwater', 'premiere', 'Incredible', 'Mr.', 'Limpet', 'undeniably', 'one', 'highlights', 'career', 'incredible', 'Mr.', 'Knotts']",N/A
