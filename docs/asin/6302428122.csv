But this was the first time I'd actually seen the man in concert, and it most certainly won't be the last.  Absolutely one of the most hilarious concerts I've ever seen.  Beside me, my Australian wife was also laughing so hard we had to pause the thing from time to time, so he crosses national boundaries as easily as he does racial ones.  I had no idea he was so visual as well as verbal.  And at a whopping 102 minutes, I really hope they pieced this together from several performances, because doing all that in a single session would probably kill somebody.  Just remembering that much material would be too much for most.  It's too easy to remember what his career turned into and dismiss him, but in his prime, meaning right here, wow.  I've slipped this one onto that very special place in my shelves where DVDs live that I'll watch again and again and never part with.  That's why it's got five stars.

312257,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6302428122,andy8047,"[4, 7]","Silly Bill Cosby comes alive on stage in Ontario,Canada and on movie screens almost everywhere. The opening theme song is entitled IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME. First,Cosby talks about drugs. Normally,he's no trashmouth but he does mention once and only once the vulgar slang word for ""anus"",""rectum"",""idiot"" and ""jerk"". Then he talks about dentistry,the subject that opens the soundtrack album which is entitled THE DENTIST. ""Dentists tell you not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object."",he tells his audience. Then,there's what's entitled on the album,NATURAL CHILDBIRTH. Cosby tells about pregnancy,the joyous aftermath and what his wife Camille went through when she was pregnant with the Cosbys' first child. ""You just had a lizard!"",Bill tells Camille after the birth. The audience breaks into uproarious laughter. Then there's Cosby's definition of BRAIN DAMAGE,which is disobedience and immediate forgetfulness. A child is told by an adult not to do something then when the adult turns his/her back and turns it around again,the child is caught violating. The adult asks the child,""If you were told not to do it,then why did you do it?"" The child answers,""I don't know!"" That subject is carried over into what's entitled KILL THE BOY. The boy is Cosby's now-deceased son Ennis. Bill comes home from a tennis game and Camille tells him,""I want you to go upstairs and kill that boy!"". Bill tells Ennis,""Your mother sent me here to kill you!"" What motivated this? Ennis gave himself a haircut. Bill asked Ennis,""What happened to your hair?"". Ennis said ""I don't know!"". Then Bill asks,""Was your head with you all day today?"". Ennis said ""Ah-hah!"". Then Bill asks,""Did you cut your hair off?"". Ennis replies,""Ah-hah!"". ""Why didn't you tell me that then?"". Ennis replied,""I don't know!"". Another funny moment in the Cosby household was when Camille wanted Bill to cook breakfast for the couple's five children. Bill reluctantly complied with Camille's order after being threatened with a shotgun and a bucket of ice water. So he proceeds with a frying pan and,as he tells in an angry tone,the damn bacon,sausage and the(""you have to be careful with"")eggs. The Cosbys' youngest child,then-age 4,spotted chocolate cake. She asked her father if she could have some of the cake. The other four children decide to have the same thing after seeing the 4-year-old eating it. That relieved Bill from the duty of cooking. They were all happy eating the cake and listening to music until an angry Camille came along and shouted,""WHERE DID YOU GET CHOCOLATE CAKE FROM?"". Bill replied,""THEY ASKED FOR IT!"". One of the children then said,""We asked for eggs and milk and Dad made us eat this!"". Bill then tells about the nightly routine in the Cosby household entitled SAME THING HAPPENS EVERY NIGHT. After dinner Camille tells the children,""Go upstairs,take off all your clothes,get into the shower,use the soap and shampoo,rinse yourselves off,dry yourselves off,get into your pajamas and go to sleep. Now if you do as I say,there will be no beatings!"" However,there's a scuffle between Ennis and his two younger siblings. The youngest one feared she'd be blinded for life because shampoo has run from her hair into her eyes. This scenario has been re-enacted in the premiere episode of NBC's ""The Cosby Show"" in 1984. Angry Camille then grabs a yardstick and according to Bill,""holds it like a Samaurai warrior"". Camille announces,""THE BEATINGS WILL NOW BEGIN!"". Then Bill talks about grandparenthood,entitled THE GRANDPARENTS. Bill of course is referring to his mom and dad and Camille's mom and dad. Bill's mother was an authority on pigsties. All she had to do was find a shoe lying upside down in a room and to her that room was the filthiest she had ever seen,according to Bill. Bill's dad would fart and shift the blame to ""invisible animals"". The soundtrack album is on the Motown label.

It was easily the funniest thing I had ever heard in my life, and I went around telling everyone just how hilarious Bill Cosby was.  At the time, I only knew Cosby from his Picture Pages segments on Captain Kangaroo and the Fat Albert cartoons, and I actually felt like some type of visionary when a little television vehicle called The Cosby Show debuted soon thereafter based to a large degree on the comedy you will find on both the album and video of Bill Cosby, Himself.  A few of the skits in this performance were translated almost directly to the screen in the show's first few episodes.The Bill Cosby, Himself video is hilarious; I still laugh every time I watch it, no matter how many times I've heard the routines.  There was a time when I practically had The Dentist memorized, but I still love to hear it (and I felt privileged indeed to hear that story told again on the occasion I had to see Cosby perform live some years after this video came out).  Cosby's humor resonates so well with audiences because he is describing and joking about things we all know and understand to some degree.  He doesn't need to use foul language or tell dirty jokes in order to reach his audience.  He comes in, sits in a plain old chair in front of the live audience at Toronto's Hamilton Place Performing Arts Center, and just starts talking about the humorous things in life.  The audience feels as if Cosby is one of them, and the connection between audience and comic is immediate and powerful.The comic material on Bill Cosby, Himself, deals primarily with family life - marriage, children, etc.  He makes the birth of his first child a hilarious journey into the delivery room, explains that parents age and lose a lot of their intellect because of the brain damage that characterizes all of their children, explains how differently his parents treat his own children compared to the way they treated him, offers a wonderful illustration of the talent fathers have of getting out of doing things, and describes quite vividly some of the antics of his own five children over the years.  He also describes the typical weekend activities of people who go out drinking and questions just how hangovers and nausea can be considered essential parts of ""having a good time.""Bill Cosby knows people, and he knows what will make them laugh; he is also one of the greatest storytellers in the world.  He is at his funniest on this video, and I really can't imagine there is anyone out there who would not enjoy watching Bill Cosby, Himself.

The following year came the first season of The Cosby Show.  It took me over twenty years to learn how closely connected Bill Cosby Himself was to the creation (and duration) of The Cosby Show (especially the pilot episode).  For me during the 80's, it only mattered that this special didn't include Phylicia, Sabrina, Lisa, Malcolm, Tempestt or Keshia.  (And of course, there wasn't Geoffrey, Deon or Raven.)Then, we entered the 90's, and I fully awoke to the differences between situation comedy, film comedy and - ta da - stand-up comedy.  Once I finally got the gist of stand-up routines, this show made all the sense in the world.  And, I fully grew to love it.  One of my favorite moments in the show is the segment, ""Natural Childbirth.""  (It wasn't until right before I purchased my copy that I learned the origin of the cheer, ""Push him out, shove him out, way out,"" which would appear in the Cosby Show pilot.)  But, the reason I loved that segment best is that one of my siblings and I used to imitate Dr. Cosby's vigorous Lamaze breathing (""Push, push!).  Between that chapter and the Dentistry topic, I almost started calling Bill ""Bottom-Lip Cosby.""When this show was first recorded, I was so curious what it was like to fly on an airplane.  After watching the ""Little Jeffrey' chapter, I'm glad I didn't.  I may not have behaved any better as a four-year-old than that kid, if I'd flown.  Now, in my adulthood, that experience would just imbrue my joyous childhood recollections - even though I may have behaved no better than Dr. Cosby's actual children behaved.  Now, how did some of you other Pepsi Generation kids behave with your parents or each other?[And, it's not too often that you see envelope-controlled floodlights whose amplitude rises and falls based on what comes out of Bill's microphone.]Well, it's time to head for the dentist.

This is primarily a collection of routines about his immediate family, mixed with opening routines on the effects of drugs and alcohol (which were not included on the LP), some cute stuff on dentists, and a few gags about his father and brother Russell.  The record album is edited, by the way, so this dvd is better off for your library in that respect.  This interestingly enough marks the 3rd version of this show I've seen.  The first time I saw it (and currently have on tape) features a song during the credits written by Cosby and his long time tv associate Stu Billett called ""It was a good idea at the time"" (hence my title).  The first time I taped it, it had NO BACKGROUND MUSIC whatsoever.  This copy (on both sides: Full Screen on one or Widescreen on the other) features a song called ""Just the slew of us"" and features some of the gags from this show in it.  At first, I didn't get it, but then realized it was a parody on the popular 80s hit ""Just the two of us"".  Nevermind the music, just watch the show.

I'd heard some of the lines before but there's no amount of sound effect that can replicate the humor involved in just watching his facial expressions.I think the second half of the show was better than the first.I probably don't remember all the segments, but the section on drunks (""having a good time""), dentists, sons and daughters, and others kept my whole family entertained. There are a few slow points, but some of the segments take a little setup. Of course some sections were funnier than others, but as a whole, this is a wonderful sampling of some classic comedy routines.Parental note: There are a few curse words contained w/in, but mostly the show's just funny and practically timeless. If you've ever been to the dentist, you can relate to at least half the things he's talking about. I don't know if a teenager would find the same level of good humor in this work, but it would be interesting to hear their thoughts.I haven't laughed out loud that many times in a long time.

Everyone else since he has gotten older and retired, hasn't been as good at noticing the normal things in life, in family life and bringing it to our notice as how funny it is...without making it dirty or offensive. He never had the need to do that. He never had to put in four letter words, or make his comedy so bad you couldn't let your kids hear it. And his smile? You knew what was coming...just in the way he smiled. I miss that. Sometimes, he gets a little preachy now, but most of the time he is right about what he is preachy about.

Cosby also talks about people snorting cocaine.b) Very late in the performance Cosby jokingly talks about how when he was young he thought his name was ""Jesus Christ"" due to his father's exclamations.3) ProductionThe DVD includes a Full Screen and a Wide Screen version on a double-sided disc.

The man is absolutely hilarious.As a warm up of sorts, he starts out by talking about people who use alcohol and drugs to have ""fun"" on the weekends.  Then he discusses going to the dentist.  Finally, he gets to the main event where family life is skewered.  Everything from ""natural childbirth"" to trying to wrangle 5 kids to the change from parents to grandparents (watching his parents make the change that is) is fair game here.Those looking for something visually stimulating will be disappointed.  This is just Bill, a microphone, and a chair (which he sits in more often than not) for the entire time.  But please don't let that stop you.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  And his observations are absolutely true, too.  At times he has a point to make, but he makes it with dead accurate humor.And this movie is mostly clean, too.  There was one word early on and a bit at the end I didn't appreciate, but we're talking about a minute out of an hour and forty-five minutes of comedy.  I'm not complaining.

I also own the album, and wore out two or three copies of it on cassette in the eighties. (Thank heaven for the CD!) I DVRed it from one of the commercial-free channels a few months ago and saved it to watch with my daughter recently; she's about the same age now I was when I first saw it, so it seemed a natural. My daughter's one of those kids who laughs at comedies, but is horrified of being seen to like things that won't be seen as cool (for example, she goes into fits of giggling when I sit her down in front of an episode of Are You Being Served? or The Golden Girls, but still professes to hate them), so I figured I'd get the same reaction here. It seems, though, that Bill Cosby is still cool. We've been going around the house intermittently singing the Chocolate Cake for Breakfast song ever since.Cosby, of course, went mainstream (and kind of boring) in the mid-eighties with The Cosby Show and Bill Cosby Mysteries, but as a standup comedian, the man has been a king among kings since the sixties. I've always thought Himself has actually been his best set; pieces of it (including the Chocolate Cake for Breakfast song and the immortal first line of the album: ""Dentists tell you not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object. Then you sit in their chair..."") have become cultural icons, quoted even by those who have no idea where they came from. Unlike the album, though, the film of Himself is not the entirely-wholesome image that Cosby kind of grew into after The Cosby Show started airing; his first monologue here, about drugs, is not off-color, but it's definitely a mature theme, and Cosby proves himself as hysterical when walking the same ground as folks like Richard Pryor and George Carlin as he is when doing the family-oriented stuff. (During my drunk years, I always used to do the ""oh, toilet bowl, you're my only friend"" routine when I found myself in, erm, that position.)This is straight-out four-on-the-floor funny stuff, and it remains the finest standup video I've ever seen. Great stuff. And I now have evidence, though it's the smallest of sample sizes, that new generations are also finding Cosby as funny as us old folks.

He did his routine on Noah reluctantly building the ark at God's bidding.  In a subsequent program he did the Revolutionary War routine, in which the two sides tactics were decided like the flip of a coin at the start of a football game.  It was immediately obvious that he was headed for great things.  He broke barriers as a comic, then as an actor in a primetime crime series.This disk is of a more mature comic, after he was married with children, and most of the comedy is about that.  He never resorted to offensive language to get nervous laughter from an audience pretending to be so very hip.  This is the vintage stuff, a seamless stream of telling us what was funny n his own life and acting it out.

Almost every one them tells tasteless jokes, filled with comments about (bad) intimacy with the girlfriend or specific bodily functions.  The tasteful comedian is a dying breed it seems.  Humor has descended to its lowest common denominator.Bill Cosby, Himself is great proof that you don't have to be tasteless and obscene to be funny.  His comedy is clean, and has always been, which makes him a breed of performer I find to be very rare in today's market.  It is this fact, and the fact that he somehow is able to capture life in its truthfulness and bring out the humor in it that makes him among the best comedians of the past 50 years.For me, a guy who's had extensive dental work done, every time I see the dentistry bit, I can't stop laughing.  He had it, right down to the sound of the pick on the teeth and the drill slipping.  It wasn't funny when I was having it done, but Cosby somehow can bring it out.

After all these years I still find myself laughing hard, with tears running down my face like it's the first time I've seen his performance.  Bill Cosby is an awesome story teller.  Hiss set is simple.  The stage, and a chair.  He tells a story and he really has something to talk about.  Unlike some of the comedians to today that cuss to fill in the space where they ran out of things to say.  Bill Cosby knew how to be funny without all the foul language.I love it when he talks about his wife going into labor and grabbing his bottom lip and lifting it over his head screaming ""I want morphine!!!!!""  ""Mom can't have drugs; the father can have all the drugs he wants.""  He talks about how his parents want to get into heaven and treats the grandchildren better then they treated him as a child.  Brain damaged children, feeding chocolate cake to the children for breakfast.  How fathers are more fun then Moms because fathers are allowed to have gas.  The Baby poo poo.  He talks about being high and laughing for no reason.  Drugs and paranoia, Getting drunk, going to the Dentist.  Brain Damaged children saying ""I don't know"" when you ask them a question.You can appreciate the material because you can relate to it.  Some of what Bill talks about you may have experience yourself, and now you can laugh about it if you did not laugh about it before.

This is one of those must-have comedy special DVD's everyone should own. I am not a parent, but can still relate to his subject matter. (I deal with plenty of incompetent people who act like bad children in real life.) No use of the f-bomb needed, not that I care about that, but for anyone worried about ""bad language"", there's very little of that here. The show is approx. an hour-and-a-half long. Along with his infamous & riotous dissertation of being a father to five children, he makes true-to-life (and thus, funny) comments about co-workers, people who go out partying every weekend only to come to work on Monday worn out from their two days of ""fun"" & thoughts on his own parents becoming grandparents (and changing drastically in personality over the years).
