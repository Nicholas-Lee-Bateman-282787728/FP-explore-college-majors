1505162,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B005XB8S64,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[0, 0]","A The World God Only Knows Anime ReviewKeima is a boy that really likes video games. To be exact dating sim games. These types of games involve conquering 2-dimensional girls and to make them fall in love with him. The only real problem is Keima would rather exist only in his 2-D dating sim games. He would frequently try to reject the real world. This causes everyone around him to see him as a total dweeb Oh, and he usually would get teased Although the interesting thing about him is that Keima doesn't that bother him. Since he's actually pretty well-known on the web as a major 2-D girl conqueror he gets approached by Elsie, a demon girl, who sees him as a God or ""Kami"". Elsie wants him to make girls fall in love with him.The World God Only Knows creates a most original concept in the story. Keima soon starts caring about others beyond just his dating sim games even though he still regains his ideals primarily the one of ""the world not exactly being anything particularly impressive"". He is determined to protect what he believes in.The characters in The World God Only Knows are just full of great development. Elsie seems to be a cute moe demon girl that is just admirable. Keima is just amazing. He is obviously a supposed geek but his indifferent personality is incredibly hilarious at the the time since it puts off people. Even so Keima truly doesn't care.The animation is very smooth and fluid. The animation is nothing like the early days of anime. It is bright and full of cutesy character designs. Even Keima is a cute-looking guy yet what puts people off is his non-stop gaming. The World God Only Knows anime series is really one of the best anime series that have released in recent years. The animation which for an anime is most important is superb!-Originally posted on The Huge Anime Fan blog.

1505163,A3474ZR07UN1CJ,B005XB8S64,"DL ""never slacking in pace, only lacking mist...","[0, 0]","I actually really enjoyed this series.  You already know the premise so I wont go over that.  The show is about 50/50 between the boys obssesion with video games and the actual conquests of the girls.  I believe there were only 4 actual conquests of girls during this first season.  Each conquest lasts a few episodes, and they go into the back story of why the girl is the way she is. Keima tries to use his knowledge and experience of dating sims to win over the real-life girls affections.  Loose soul in custody!  I like the aspect of Keima trying to conquer all these different types of girls, who are all very different from eachother.  Therefore, he has to use different strategies and tactics for each one.  Seems very playerish to make each girl fall in love with him and then move onto the next.  Seems kinda wrong.  But this is not the case, as when each girl is free'd of the loose soul, she loses all memory of the ordeal.  The show seemed so short and did have an odd ending, so I was glad to see there will be a second season.  Nice premise, and Elsie, the demon from Hell, is absolutely adoarable and very funny.

1505167,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B005XB8S64,NC,"[2, 3]","Over the years harem style animes have come and gone. With very few good ones, and tons of copycats. God Only Knows I would consider a harem in basic concept of one guy after a lot of girls. It steps outside that concept when you see Keima is just a gamer...he has no interest in real women or the real world. His whole life is spent in the digital world. So how does he get girls and why?Simple! Keima is a dating sim master. For those that don't know, dating sims are huge in Japan and have been for many years. The closest we get to them is in games like Fable 2 and 3 where you can date and marry any in game character. Or in Bioware games where you can romance a character.So why does this all happen? Well simple, to not give away too much, Keima runs his digital mouth off as the God of Conquest. A demon sees it and gets him to help her recover escaped evil souls that are running loose. She is of course a ditz and doesn't realize this conquest is only digital women. Unfortunately, both will die if he doesn't help so thus begins their adventure recovering loose souls that end up...you guessed it, inside hearts of women. Most of the time, ones dealing with emotional issues in their lives. The only cure is for him to fill their hearts to force the evil spirit to leave.The show picks up there and just gets better and better. I won't spoil anymore of it, each conquest in season 1 is based on generic anime female models. But they are all done very well with some quite memorable moments. Season 2, which we don't have yet...goes even further. It brings in more women and even does some different ones that most animes skip over. It also explains more about why these loose souls are running amok and why it is so important for Elsie to capture them.But for more on season 2, you'll have to wait for it's release. Overall this is a fantastic series. It takes generic anime and turns it around, making something entirely new and original. Not a lot of shows can do that. Buy it, rent it, just check it out. If you are a romantic comedy or harem anime fan, this series is for you!",5,I can see the ending...,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,2091,"['years', 'harem', 'style', 'animes', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'very', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'tons', 'copycats', 'God', 'Only', 'would', 'consider', 'harem', 'basic', 'concept', 'one', 'guy', 'lot', 'girls', 'concept', 'when', 'see', 'Keima', 'just', 'gamer', 'interest', 'real', 'women', 'real', 'world', 'whole', 'life', 'spent', 'digital', 'world', 'how', 'get', 'girls', 'why', 'Simple', 'Keima', 'dating', 'sim', 'master', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dating', 'sims', 'are', 'huge', 'Japan', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'closest', 'get', 'games', 'Fable', '2', '3', 'where', 'can', 'date', 'marry', 'game', 'character', 'Bioware', 'games', 'where', 'can', 'romance', 'character.So', 'why', 'happen', 'Well', 'simple', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'Keima', 'digital', 'mouth', 'God', 'Conquest', 'A', 'demon', 'help', 'recover', 'escaped', 'evil', 'souls', 'are', 'running', 'loose', 'course', 'ditz', ""n't"", 'realize', 'conquest', 'only', 'digital', 'women', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'die', ""n't"", 'help', 'so', 'thus', 'adventure', 'recovering', 'loose', 'souls', 'end', 'up', 'guessed', 'hearts', 'women', 'Most', 'time', 'ones', 'dealing', 'emotional', 'issues', 'lives', 'only', 'cure', 'fill', 'hearts', 'force', 'evil', 'spirit', 'leave.The', 'show', 'up', 'there', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anymore', 'conquest', 'season', '1', 'based', 'generic', 'anime', 'female', 'models', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'quite', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Season', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', 'even', 'further', 'more', 'women', 'even', 'different', 'ones', 'most', 'animes', 'skip', 'also', 'more', 'why', 'loose', 'souls', 'are', 'running', 'amok', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'Elsie', 'capture', 'them.But', 'more', 'season', '2', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'release', 'Overall', 'fantastic', 'series', 'generic', 'anime', 'making', 'something', 'entirely', 'new', 'original', 'Not', 'lot', 'shows', 'can', 'do', 'Buy', 'rent', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'harem', 'anime', 'fan', 'series']",N/A
