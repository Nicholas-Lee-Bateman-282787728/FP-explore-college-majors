Sort of.""The Heart of Christmas"" begins on Halloween, when a mother is taking her child trick-or-treating only to wander into a Christmas setting. She is told to read a blog and does so. What she finds is Dax's story. For the most part, this movie is not a Christmas movie, though. It is the story of a couple facing quite possibly the worst tragedy they could, the terminal illness that eventually will claim their son. Throughout the film, they spend most of their time at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, where Dax undergoes treatment after treatment. But St. Jude is wonderfully supportive, especially in that Dax's parents, Austin and Julie (performed solidly by Eric Jay Beck and Jeanne Nelson), are around others who know what they are going through and who can therefore offer the combination of support, empathy, and understanding that probably isn't readily available in too many places. Ultimately, however, the couple must face the possibility that Dax will not live to see Christmas.This film has every chance to be maudlin, and I expect some will indeed find it so. I didn't, though. The script, the cast, and the direction seemed thoroughly heartfelt to me. I suspect that there were some unpleasant moments in the real story that did not make it to the film; Julie and Austin come across as almost perfect, but, as I don't know the real Julie and Austin and as the film does seem sincere, I'm prepared to acknowledge that what we see is an accurate reflection of their good qualities.I noted earlier two points. The first is that this film is ""sort of"" Dax's story. There are clear differences between the truth and the script. But I found those out after seeing the film, and the fact that I was moved to look up the story says something about the movie. I also noted that this movie is ""not a Christmas movie."" It does, however, have a healthy dose of religion. The characters pray frequently, cite scripture, and generally exhibit their faith--all in a way that seems entirely consistent with the way people do act. In other words, nothing here felt forced. Does the movie preach? Yes, it does, and it does so without apology. But the message is that we should treasure each moment. I can't see any reason anyone would object to that message.Also included on the DVD is the music video that inspired the film as well as information about The Dax Locke Foundation.",4,This one's real,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2505,"['Dax', 'Locke', 'was', 'born', 'June', '2007', 'passed', 'away', 'AML', 'M7', 'leukemia', 'December', '30', '2009', 'movie', 'story', 'Sort', 'Heart', 'Christmas', 'Halloween', 'when', 'mother', 'taking', 'child', 'trick-or-treating', 'only', 'wander', 'Christmas', 'setting', 'told', 'read', 'blog', 'so', 'What', 'Dax', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'though', 'story', 'couple', 'facing', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'tragedy', 'could', 'terminal', 'illness', 'eventually', 'will', 'claim', 'son', 'film', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'St.', 'Jude', 'Children', 'Research', 'Hospital', 'where', 'Dax', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'St.', 'Jude', 'wonderfully', 'supportive', 'especially', 'Dax', 'parents', 'Austin', 'Julie', 'performed', 'solidly', 'Eric', 'Jay', 'Beck', 'Jeanne', 'Nelson', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'who', 'can', 'therefore', 'offer', 'combination', 'support', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'probably', ""n't"", 'readily', 'available', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'couple', 'must', 'face', 'possibility', 'Dax', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'Christmas.This', 'film', 'chance', 'be', 'maudlin', 'expect', 'will', 'indeed', 'find', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'though', 'script', 'cast', 'direction', 'seemed', 'thoroughly', 'heartfelt', 'suspect', 'were', 'unpleasant', 'moments', 'real', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'Julie', 'Austin', 'come', 'almost', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'Julie', 'Austin', 'film', 'seem', 'sincere', ""'m"", 'prepared', 'acknowledge', 'what', 'see', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'good', 'qualities.I', 'noted', 'earlier', 'two', 'points', 'first', 'film', 'sort', 'Dax', 'story', 'are', 'clear', 'differences', 'truth', 'script', 'found', 'out', 'seeing', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'moved', 'look', 'up', 'story', 'something', 'movie', 'also', 'noted', 'movie', 'not', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'however', 'have', 'healthy', 'dose', 'religion', 'characters', 'pray', 'frequently', 'cite', 'scripture', 'generally', 'exhibit', 'faith', 'way', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'way', 'people', 'do', 'act', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'here', 'felt', 'forced', 'movie', 'preach', 'Yes', 'so', 'apology', 'message', 'should', 'treasure', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'anyone', 'would', 'object', 'message.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'music', 'video', 'inspired', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'information', 'Dax', 'Locke', 'Foundation']",N/A

We both enjoy Christmas movies, we are Christians who take our faith seriously, and we both like Matthew West's music.  And... I am a physician so there were a number of reasons we were interested. Unfortunately, the movie is pretty bland and maudlin. The medical scenes were embarrassingly bad, but that is the case with a lot of movies that deal with medicine, and I could forgive that. Mostly what irritated me was the repeated boosting of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as the best hospital in the world. I have great admiration for St. Jude but I didn't realize I would be sitting through an hour and a half promo. The answer to whether a group of teens would enjoy this movie would be a ""No.""While the leads (Neilson and Beck as Dax's mom and dad) are appealing and good actors, some of the lines spoken by others clanked as badly as a lead bell. And Dax never looked convincingly ill in one single scene. And there was an almost complete lack of any humor to alleviate all the on-screen tears and sadness.(Spoilers follow) The side story of the harried mother (Bure) who had let her job take her away from a good relationship with her husband and children was trite. And to believe that she is so busy that she could not go to her children's performances or games but yet she could sit for (apparently) days and read through a year plus of the blog written by Dax's mom, and that doing so completely changed her life, was not believable. Admittedly, the film could have been more manipulative as Dax's death was not shown, and I appreciated that. And West's music was very moving. But any Christian message from the film was so muted as to be nonexistent. Instead we get humanistic pablum... ""Cherish Every Moment."" I am not a cynical man but saying things like that is not helpful to people who have to deal with life's day to day pressures.I guess I will go back to watching 2007's Nolle.
