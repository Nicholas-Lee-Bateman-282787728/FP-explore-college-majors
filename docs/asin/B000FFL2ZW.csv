I was not expecting to like it much at all.But once i started watching it, this was the best thing i had ever seen.Each episode (40-60minutes a piece) was full of action and excitement. But it is also full of story, plot twists and it always keeps you ready for more.This dvd set is well worth more than $20.",5,Greatest anime out there,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,387,"['reviewer', 'i', 'bought', 'set', 'friend', 'reccomended', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'like', 'much', 'all.But', 'once', 'i', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'i', 'had', 'ever', 'seen.Each', 'episode', '40-60minutes', 'piece', 'was', 'full', 'action', 'excitement', 'also', 'full', 'story', 'plot', 'twists', 'always', 'ready', 'more.This', 'dvd', 'set', 'well', 'more', '20']",N/A

It is as if the writers decided to take the story in multiple directions and failed in every single one. It tries to be philosophical. Can one obtain happiness without sacrifice?, repeatedly asks the main character, but I really didn't care for the answer to the question because it seemed very trivial to me (adult in his 30s).How come most of the villians are always wearing a nice suit? How come the giant evil sphere is in a shape of an eye and many of the characters lose their eye? How come Giant Robo (which is purely mechanical) inexplicably cries when it loses its arm? How come Dr. Shizuma just explain things instead looking like a drug addict suffering from severe withdrawl and speech impairment?  There are many inexplicable events which this anime does not even attempt to explain.The 6 episode series starts off great. The initial explaination of Dr. Von Fogler and his attempt to create a ""beautiful night"" is one of the all time great Japanese animation clips. Rarely has a depiction of a ""Mad Scientist"" so compellingly dramatized and shown with such unforgettable vision.But the series takes few twists and starts to introduce unnecessary characters which confuses lot more than it adds to the coherence of the story.In the end, it is just a cartoon. It is visually satisfying and has enough elements to be worth watching. This is still one of the best Japanese animation of the 90s. Giant Robo is an example of how much Japanese animation has slid from its glory years of late 60s to early 80s.",3,Becomes stranger by the episode,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,1688,"['would', 'have', 'really', 'loved', 'anime', 'was', 'around', '14', 'too', 'violent', 'younger', 'viewers.The', 'plot', 'most', 'Japanese', 'animation', '90s', 'very', 'incoherent', 'writers', 'decided', 'take', 'story', 'multiple', 'directions', 'failed', 'single', 'one', 'be', 'philosophical', 'Can', 'one', 'obtain', 'happiness', 'sacrifice', 'repeatedly', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'answer', 'question', 'seemed', 'very', 'trivial', 'adult', '30s', '.How', 'come', 'most', 'villians', 'are', 'always', 'wearing', 'nice', 'suit', 'How', 'come', 'giant', 'evil', 'sphere', 'shape', 'eye', 'many', 'characters', 'lose', 'eye', 'How', 'come', 'Giant', 'Robo', 'purely', 'mechanical', 'inexplicably', 'cries', 'when', 'arm', 'How', 'come', 'Dr.', 'Shizuma', 'just', 'explain', 'things', 'instead', 'looking', 'drug', 'addict', 'suffering', 'severe', 'withdrawl', 'speech', 'impairment', 'are', 'many', 'inexplicable', 'events', 'anime', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'explain.The', '6', 'episode', 'series', 'great', 'initial', 'explaination', 'Dr', 'Von', 'Fogler', 'attempt', 'create', 'beautiful', 'night', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'clips', 'Rarely', 'depiction', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'so', 'compellingly', 'dramatized', 'shown', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'vision.But', 'series', 'few', 'twists', 'introduce', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'lot', 'more', 'coherence', 'story.In', 'end', 'just', 'cartoon', 'visually', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'elements', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'Japanese', 'animation', '90s', 'Giant', 'Robo', 'example', 'how', 'much', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'slid', 'glory', 'years', 'late', '60s', 'early', '80s']",N/A

I never bought this packaged set, but I have the indivdual DVDs from Anime Works.  If you desire the Manga Dub of Giant Robo (and, really, why wouldn't you?) then you should know this: the DVDs contain a hidden track which has the Manga dub.  It CANNOT be selected from the menus.  Instead find the ""audio"" button on your DVD remote and push it until the Manga Dub begins.Thanks!",5,Here is a suggestion!,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,443,"['Terrific', 'show', 'need', 'address', 'one', 'posts', 'never', 'bought', 'packaged', 'set', 'have', 'indivdual', 'DVDs', 'Anime', 'Works', 'desire', 'Manga', 'Dub', 'Giant', 'Robo', 'really', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'then', 'should', 'know', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'hidden', 'track', 'Manga', 'dub', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'be', 'selected', 'menus', 'Instead', 'find', 'audio', 'button', 'DVD', 'remote', 'push', 'Manga', 'Dub']",N/A
