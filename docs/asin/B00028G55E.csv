I picked up this compilation of Manchilds first season, and was snagged by the cover which advertised ""Sex In The City for men"".  ""Ahkay"", I groaned, figuring something half as entertaining would make a fine accompaniment to drawn blinds and a trough-full of Spinach Artichoke Dip.Dragged myself home, popped this thing in with low expectation, and was immediately, and very pleasantly, surprised.I watched the entire 2 DVD's in one sitting, and laughed (painfully considering the headache) the entire way through.  The characters are, much like Sex In The City, leaning over the cliff of believably, but sufficiently real to connect with.  All four of them roughly 50, all of them successful, all but one of them are single.  Philosophically ""light"", but nonetheless intriguing.Where Sex In The City seemed to be about four young women growing up and finding a place in their lives for family, Manchild is more about what's on the other side of family...""what then?"".I do think it appropriate however to issue a yellow ""Girlfriend/Wife alert"", there are numerous ""men issues"" that these energetic 50 year olds aggressively and often unsensitively tackle.  I watched with my girlfriend, and would occassionally glance over to see her, mouth agape in horror that men might ever think or do such things.For those that love SITC, you have cause for celebration, this is a male reflection of that show; for everyone else who are looking for a good laugh (or to successfully nurse a hangover), pick this DVD series up.  You won't be dissapointed.Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California",5,"""Sex in the City"" for men...",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1729,"['was', 'perusing', 'unusual', 'today', 'search', 'comfort', 'video', 'nurse', 'balance', 'particularly', 'violent', 'Sunday', 'hangover', 'picked', 'up', 'compilation', 'Manchilds', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'snagged', 'cover', 'advertised', 'Sex', 'City', 'men', 'Ahkay', 'groaned', 'figuring', 'something', 'half', 'entertaining', 'would', 'make', 'fine', 'accompaniment', 'drawn', 'blinds', 'trough-full', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Dip.Dragged', 'home', 'popped', 'thing', 'low', 'expectation', 'was', 'immediately', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.I', 'watched', 'entire', '2', 'DVD', 'one', 'sitting', 'laughed', 'painfully', 'considering', 'headache', 'entire', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'Sex', 'City', 'leaning', 'cliff', 'believably', 'sufficiently', 'real', 'connect', 'four', 'roughly', '50', 'successful', 'one', 'are', 'single', 'Philosophically', 'light', 'nonetheless', 'intriguing.Where', 'Sex', 'City', 'seemed', 'be', 'four', 'young', 'women', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'place', 'lives', 'family', 'Manchild', 'more', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'what', 'then', '.I', 'do', 'think', 'appropriate', 'however', 'issue', 'yellow', 'Girlfriend/Wife', 'alert', 'are', 'numerous', 'men', 'issues', 'energetic', '50', 'year', 'olds', 'aggressively', 'often', 'unsensitively', 'tackle', 'watched', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'occassionally', 'glance', 'see', 'mouth', 'agape', 'horror', 'men', 'might', 'ever', 'think', 'do', 'such', 'things.For', 'love', 'SITC', 'have', 'cause', 'celebration', 'male', 'reflection', 'show', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'laugh', 'successfully', 'nurse', 'hangover', 'pick', 'DVD', 'series', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed.Enjoy', 'Christian', 'HunterSanta', 'Barbara', 'California']",Manchild - The Complete First Season
826547,A2JVXOZR3EY5PZ,B00028G55E,"Christoph B. Gondek ""Host, www.theinvisibleha...","[13, 16]","Sex in the City for men was how this show is always described. I have not seen any episodes of SITC, but I own this series. Some women I know seem to be concerned that watching it will give their husbands ideas. Lord, I hope not.See, the trick with the show is in the credits. Watch them and you'll notice the wives are still there (execpt Patrick). During the course of the show, anyone with a brain should notice that:1. Terry is a complete wanker.2. James is a dim bulb.3. Patrick, though bright and funny, is full of himself.4. Gary, the fat married one, is actually the happiest of them all. (And Cheryl, his wife, is the smartest character in the show)It is a funny show and it hit all sorts of fantasy buttons for this male (initally). But watch it several times and you realize how utterly empty their lives are (Something the lads notice themselves in Series 2).There is a second series of Manchild. There are 8 episodes, 2 of which (Dirty Dixon returns from Africa and James moves in with Terry for a few weeks) are the best in the series, while the other six are utter embarassments. If you think Terry was a wanker in Series 1, he is almost unwatchable in Series 2.Still, if nothing else, Manchild gives us the intriguing question, ""Can you seduce her without saying a word?"". Patrick always was good with those sorts of questions.",5,"Funny, but what is underneath?",1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1343,"['Sex', 'City', 'men', 'was', 'how', 'show', 'always', 'described', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'SITC', 'own', 'series', 'women', 'know', 'seem', 'be', 'concerned', 'watching', 'will', 'give', 'husbands', 'ideas', 'Lord', 'hope', 'not.See', 'trick', 'show', 'credits', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'wives', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'execpt', 'Patrick', 'course', 'show', 'anyone', 'brain', 'should', 'notice', 'that:1', 'Terry', 'complete', 'wanker.2', 'James', 'dim', 'bulb.3', 'Patrick', 'bright', 'funny', 'full', 'himself.4', 'Gary', 'fat', 'married', 'one', 'actually', 'happiest', 'Cheryl', 'wife', 'smartest', 'character', 'show', 'funny', 'show', 'hit', 'sorts', 'fantasy', 'buttons', 'male', 'initally', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'realize', 'how', 'utterly', 'empty', 'lives', 'are', 'Something', 'lads', 'notice', 'Series', '2', 'second', 'series', 'Manchild', 'are', '8', 'episodes', '2', 'Dirty', 'Dixon', 'returns', 'Africa', 'James', 'moves', 'Terry', 'few', 'weeks', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'other', 'six', 'are', 'utter', 'embarassments', 'think', 'Terry', 'was', 'wanker', 'Series', '1', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Series', '2.Still', 'nothing', 'else', 'Manchild', 'intriguing', 'question', 'Can', 'seduce', 'saying', 'word', 'Patrick', 'always', 'was', 'good', 'sorts', 'questions']",Manchild - The Complete First Season
826548,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00028G55E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","The easiest way to recommend a British television series might be to compare it to a successful American television series, but there is no reason to believe that is the best way. I was told that ""Coupling"" was the British version of ""Friends,"" which is obvious but not really significant because the romance between Steve and Susan is more central to the story than was ever really true about Ross and Rachel. Similarly, I was told that ""Manchild"" was the British version of ""Sex in the City,"" although there is an even more obvious difference because we are talking four males into of four females. But, again, there is an even more important distinction in that this particular quartet is about to hit the big five-oh and not the big three-oh. Most of them are not looking forward to marriage, but rather behind. If anything this is a show about four Englishmen who are embracing their mid-life crises (or perhaps post mid-life crises since they are probably not going to live to be 100 or even close to it).Besides, I watched the show because Anthony (Stewart) Head plays James and this fall catching up on what the old ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" gang are up to on the tube is the thing to do, even if you have to track down an import from across the pond. However, the central character is Terry (Nigel Havers, ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Empire of the Sun""), the narrator of the series, who has divorced his wife and is looking to life the good life now that he has the freedom (and the money) to do so. Patrick (Don Warrington) knows all about living the good life because he wasted all his money on Beatles' memorabilia when he was younger. Then there is Gary (Ray Burdis), who is still married to Cheryl (Lindsey Coulson), who is twice as smart as he is, and who looks at what his friends are up to and wonders why he cannot get a bit of action himself. As for James, well, his seals are leaking.So much more than ""Sex and the City"" what ""Manchild"" strikes me as being is a British version of ""fiftysomething,"" since the topics are clearly two decades beyond that of ""thirtysomething."" It also helps that ""Fiftysomething"" is the title of the first episode, but I swear, I really was thinking along those lines."" However, as we see from the episodes in the first season (nee series), irony abounds as a series of cosmic jokes await our aging band of brothers:(1) ""Fiftysomething"" sets up James and his constant dating of models as the epitome of the good life, only for him to discover that he has performance issues; (2) ""Art"" specifically means fine art, which is what Patrick is enjoying with his friends over the weekend; (3) ""Marriage"" is about Gary risking his own marriage when he visits a lap dancing club and becomes enamored by one of the young ladies; (4) ""Jealousy"" focuses on James, who finds out there are worst things to be green-eyed over than his ex-wife's new boyfriend when he finds out who his son is dating; (5) ""Responsibility"" is about Patrick disappearing following the death of a loved while James continues to receive a series of psychological blows; (6) ""Swingers and Shakers"" has Gary trying to be the former, when he asks Cheryl if she wants to try swinging, and Patrick as the latter, when he signs up with a dating agency to try and find a wife; and (7) ""Four of a Kind,"" which ends the first year with the boys out in the country for a little hunting that will help them reconnect.For the most part ""Manchild"" is about the slings and arrows that men of this age group are prone to in their attempts to find happiness relieve their childhoods, or however you want to characterize their prime motivations. Certainly watching these shows makes me glad I am not out there the way three of these four blokes are, because it is a lot easier to laugh at the pain of others than it is at your own. ""Manchild"" also does a nice job of playing out the comedic nightmares of what Terry sees is his review mirror regarding the wife and son he left behind or the continuing travails of James deal with erectile dysfunction, but the part that got me hooked on this show was the end of ""Jealousy"" when Patrick and his friends raise their champagne glasses in a toast to his mum. Knowing that this show is capable of such emotional depth, to go along with the laughs, is what truly makes it worth checking out.",5,"Actually the British male version of ""fiftysomething"" rather than ""Sex in the City""",1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,4326,"['easiest', 'way', 'recommend', 'British', 'television', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'compare', 'successful', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'reason', 'believe', 'best', 'way', 'was', 'told', 'Coupling', 'was', 'British', 'version', 'Friends', 'obvious', 'not', 'really', 'significant', 'romance', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'more', 'central', 'story', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'true', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Similarly', 'was', 'told', 'Manchild', 'was', 'British', 'version', 'Sex', 'City', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'difference', 'are', 'talking', 'four', 'males', 'four', 'females', 'again', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'distinction', 'particular', 'quartet', 'hit', 'big', 'five-oh', 'not', 'big', 'three-oh', 'Most', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'marriage', 'rather', 'anything', 'show', 'four', 'Englishmen', 'who', 'are', 'embracing', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'perhaps', 'post', 'mid-life', 'crises', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'be', '100', 'even', 'close', 'watched', 'show', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'James', 'fall', 'catching', 'up', 'what', 'old', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'gang', 'are', 'up', 'tube', 'thing', 'do', 'even', 'have', 'track', 'down', 'import', 'pond', 'However', 'central', 'character', 'Terry', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'narrator', 'series', 'who', 'divorced', 'wife', 'looking', 'life', 'good', 'life', 'now', 'freedom', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'Patrick', 'Don', 'Warrington', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'wasted', 'money', 'Beatles', 'memorabilia', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Then', 'Gary', 'Ray', 'Burdis', 'who', 'still', 'married', 'Cheryl', 'Lindsey', 'Coulson', 'who', 'twice', 'as', 'smart', 'who', 'what', 'friends', 'are', 'up', 'wonders', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'bit', 'action', 'James', 'well', 'seals', 'are', 'leaking.So', 'much', 'more', 'Sex', 'City', 'what', 'Manchild', 'being', 'British', 'version', 'fiftysomething', 'topics', 'are', 'clearly', 'two', 'decades', 'thirtysomething', 'also', 'Fiftysomething', 'title', 'first', 'episode', 'swear', 'really', 'was', 'thinking', 'along', 'lines', 'However', 'see', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'nee', 'series', 'irony', 'abounds', 'series', 'cosmic', 'jokes', 'await', 'aging', 'band', 'brothers', '1', 'Fiftysomething', 'up', 'James', 'constant', 'dating', 'models', 'epitome', 'good', 'life', 'only', 'discover', 'performance', 'issues', '2', 'Art', 'specifically', 'fine', 'art', 'what', 'Patrick', 'enjoying', 'friends', 'weekend', '3', 'Marriage', 'Gary', 'risking', 'own', 'marriage', 'when', 'lap', 'dancing', 'club', 'becomes', 'enamored', 'one', 'young', 'ladies', '4', 'Jealousy', 'James', 'who', 'are', 'worst', 'things', 'be', 'green-eyed', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'out', 'who', 'son', 'dating', '5', 'Responsibility', 'Patrick', 'disappearing', 'following', 'death', 'loved', 'James', 'receive', 'series', 'psychological', 'blows', '6', 'Swingers', 'Shakers', 'Gary', 'trying', 'be', 'former', 'when', 'Cheryl', 'try', 'swinging', 'Patrick', 'latter', 'when', 'signs', 'up', 'dating', 'agency', 'try', 'find', 'wife', '7', 'Four', 'Kind', 'first', 'year', 'boys', 'out', 'country', 'little', 'hunting', 'will', 'help', 'reconnect.For', 'most', 'part', 'Manchild', 'slings', 'men', 'age', 'group', 'are', 'prone', 'attempts', 'find', 'happiness', 'relieve', 'childhoods', 'however', 'want', 'characterize', 'prime', 'motivations', 'Certainly', 'watching', 'shows', 'glad', 'am', 'not', 'there', 'way', 'three', 'four', 'blokes', 'are', 'lot', 'easier', 'laugh', 'pain', 'others', 'own', 'Manchild', 'also', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'out', 'comedic', 'nightmares', 'what', 'Terry', 'review', 'mirror', 'regarding', 'wife', 'son', 'left', 'behind', 'continuing', 'travails', 'James', 'deal', 'erectile', 'dysfunction', 'part', 'got', 'hooked', 'show', 'was', 'end', 'Jealousy', 'when', 'Patrick', 'friends', 'raise', 'champagne', 'glasses', 'toast', 'mum', 'Knowing', 'show', 'capable', 'such', 'emotional', 'depth', 'go', 'along', 'laughs', 'what', 'truly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Manchild - The Complete First Season
826549,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B00028G55E,Mr. J. Murdock,"[0, 0]","I wanted to see Manchild as it's often times been marketed as a male version of Sex & The City. It's fine to derive one's material from a previously successful show like Sex & City, as Terry is the Carrie Bradshaw of Manchild and James is the male version of Samantha Jones. They get themselves into embarrassing situations, such as Terry finding out his twenty something year old girlfriend Sonja is dating his son Justin or James,' um, cosmetic surgery. Or when Gary's wife Cheryl finds out about his special stripper friend who keeps calling him on his cell phone. But the problem is, the embarrassing scenarios in a sitcom has got to be funny which Manchild is not. I have no problem with characters being selfish, boorish, crude or downright stupid--provided they're making me laugh in the process. But there just wasn't any scenes in Manchild that was a knee slapper. I found it to be a very forgettable and unfunny series.",2,A Forgettable and Unfunny Series,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,929,"['wanted', 'see', 'Manchild', 'often', 'times', 'been', 'marketed', 'male', 'version', 'Sex', 'City', 'fine', 'derive', 'one', 'material', 'previously', 'successful', 'show', 'Sex', 'City', 'Terry', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'Manchild', 'James', 'male', 'version', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'get', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'such', 'Terry', 'finding', 'out', 'twenty', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Sonja', 'dating', 'son', 'Justin', 'James', 'um', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'when', 'Gary', 'wife', 'Cheryl', 'out', 'special', 'stripper', 'friend', 'who', 'calling', 'cell', 'phone', 'problem', 'embarrassing', 'scenarios', 'sitcom', 'got', 'be', 'funny', 'Manchild', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'characters', 'being', 'selfish', 'boorish', 'crude', 'downright', 'stupid', 'provided', ""'re"", 'making', 'process', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'scenes', 'Manchild', 'was', 'knee', 'slapper', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'forgettable', 'unfunny', 'series']",Manchild - The Complete First Season
826550,A3OB3WDUN51D8A,B00028G55E,Sterling,"[1, 4]","I got interested in Manchild based on reviews describing it as ""Sex and the City"" for men, lough-out-loud funny, etc. I found some similarities in the two shows. One is that both have Women's Lib underpinnings. In Sex and the City women can do no wrong, while in Manchild men are buffoons, who other than financial success are failures in life. It is a bit uneasy that such spupid, insecure men are presented to have achieved financial success.In both shows the central characters offer some deep thoughts to the viewer. While in Sex and the City such pearls of wisdom foster momentary pondering, in Manchild they are plainly moronic. In Sex and the City the approach to sex is that girls just got to have fun, regardless of what they do, with a variety of men, and are presented as independent, likable characters. In Manchild the men, who could be close to being senior citizens are portrayed as shallow, unfulfilled, and in a sophmoric pursuit of women, as the highest goal in life. None have the wisdom acquired over a long life of experiences. Even an ED/prostrate problem is used to mock men, got your comeuppance type, and almost as a triumph for femininity (James' ex-wife). Manchild also trivializes and mocks other pursuits and interests of men in a fashion true to today's political correctness. The writing is not crisp, witty, nor brilliant. Sex and the City is a much better show. Manchild is not appropriate for children, but not as much because of nudity or sex.Many things can be overlooked if a show is funny, alas, Manchild is not.",2,Tiresome,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,1550,"['got', 'interested', 'Manchild', 'based', 'reviews', 'describing', 'Sex', 'City', 'men', 'lough-out-loud', 'funny', 'etc', 'found', 'similarities', 'two', 'shows', 'One', 'have', 'Women', 'Lib', 'underpinnings', 'Sex', 'City', 'women', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Manchild', 'men', 'are', 'buffoons', 'who', 'other', 'financial', 'success', 'are', 'failures', 'life', 'bit', 'uneasy', 'such', 'spupid', 'insecure', 'men', 'are', 'presented', 'have', 'achieved', 'financial', 'success.In', 'central', 'characters', 'offer', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'viewer', 'Sex', 'City', 'such', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'foster', 'momentary', 'pondering', 'Manchild', 'are', 'plainly', 'moronic', 'Sex', 'City', 'approach', 'sex', 'girls', 'just', 'got', 'have', 'fun', 'regardless', 'what', 'do', 'variety', 'men', 'are', 'presented', 'independent', 'likable', 'characters', 'Manchild', 'men', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'close', 'being', 'senior', 'citizens', 'are', 'portrayed', 'shallow', 'unfulfilled', 'sophmoric', 'pursuit', 'women', 'highest', 'goal', 'life', 'None', 'have', 'wisdom', 'acquired', 'long', 'life', 'experiences', 'Even', 'ED/prostrate', 'problem', 'used', 'mock', 'men', 'got', 'comeuppance', 'type', 'almost', 'triumph', 'femininity', 'James', 'ex-wife', 'Manchild', 'also', 'other', 'pursuits', 'interests', 'men', 'fashion', 'true', 'today', 'political', 'correctness', 'writing', 'not', 'crisp', 'witty', 'brilliant', 'Sex', 'City', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'Manchild', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'nudity', 'sex.Many', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'show', 'funny', 'alas', 'Manchild', 'not']",Manchild - The Complete First Season
