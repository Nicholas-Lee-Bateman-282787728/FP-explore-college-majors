235166,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300269728,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","This is the story of one ""patrol torpedo"" boat, expendable forces used to attack the enemy to do the most damage at the lowest cost. The opening scene tells how JFK wrangled a front-line combat position instead of an office job is some safe rear echelon location. There is soon a warm welcome to the front. JFK wanted to learn what they didn't teach at Harvard (like some other wealthy men). An air raid shows that danger is near. Can JFK get his boat in shape in a week? The commander is not a happy man. PT 109 needs work, and gets it to pass inspection. Its engines are old. JFK had a taste for chocolate candy.Their first combat assignment is to help evacuate Marines from an island and provide covering fire. What if they run out of gas? Will help arrive in time? What happens if the engines fail? They get an assignment to attack a Japanese supply fleet. Their base is attacked by Jap fighters. JFK scrounged a 37 mm anti-tank gun for his boat. The boats patrol in the dark, there is radio silence. The engines are muffled. Radar picks up a boat. A Jap destroyer runs into their ship and cuts it in two! Burning gasoline lights up the scene, men are rescued and brought to the floating wreck. The loss of PT 109 is reported, no survivors seen. The survivors swam to a deserted island to avoid capture. Planks are used as flotation devices. They land safely. Can they be rescued? Can they signal a friendly ship? ""Nobody is giving up!""Will they have to swim to another island? They can't fight against overwhelming odds. They travel to another island for food and water. JFK inscribed a message on a coconut so two natives can carry a message to Rendovo. The men are becoming dispirited. Then a reply is received. Friendly natives wave at a passing Jap Zero. A rendezvous is made after firing recognition shots. JFK leads a PT boat to the island that rescues the crew. They will be sent back to the states on leave. But JFK wants another boat to continue the war.The credits name the actors in the crew. This is a slow-paced movie, but it is based on reality rather than Hollywood drama. JFK was the first President to have naval combat experience. His assassination was never solved in a court of law. There were a lot of changes to this country since his murder.

The leading man looks and  build are things that as a young man Kennedy would have envied.

235187,AVCIAWHTON93E,6300269728,John Dziadecki,"[9, 9]","This review references the WB Archive DVD that became available in 2011 -- it's great! What more do you want? Get it!Prior to the Warner Archive release, the film has been released on VHS in pan & scan and widescreen and also on laserdisc. Why this film has never been previously released on DVD remains a mystery but this Warner Archive release blows previous releases out of the water!Warner Archive discs are DVD-Rs -- not mass-pressings. Warner Archive source materials are of variable quality but usually pretty darn good. This keeps studio costs down and spares the studio the cost of full-fledged remastering. Archive releases are bare bones -- don't expect anything more than the featured film. Hopefully, WB will start offering Blu-ray options in this series. Hats off to Warner for their continued pioneering efforts in home video.""PT 109"" was theatrically released in July 1963. I was a high school sophomore when I saw the film in its initial release -- it was quite impressive on the big screen. The film was a modest success in its limited release. Four months after it premiered, tragically, Kennedy was assassinated. Warner pulled the film from circulation.For this 2011 DVD release, Warner states: ""This Warner Archive Collection presentation of PT-109 has been sourced from a recently-created HD 1080p master, derived from newly-manufactured film elements. The feature is presented in 16x9 Letterbox format, preserving the film's original 2.40 theatrical aspect ratio.""Image quality here *is* excellent! Maybe this is a dry run for a Blu-ray release? Contrast is good. Colors are rich and clean as befits the South Pacific locale -- albeit most exteriors were filmed around the Florida Keys and Hollywood stages. Aspect ratio of this Panavision film is 2.35:1 and that's we get here! (Amazon's 1.77:1 description is erroneous. And Panavision's figure differs slightly from WB's.)Sound quality is quite good with very discernible dialog -- something that is often lacking in current films where dialog gets buried under loud sound effects and louder music. And it's mono. Why, I really don't know. This was, after all, a major, high-profile WB production -- ""under the personal supervision of Jack L. Warner"" though reportedly he was never on the set -- and WB knows how to do sound. (Take into consideration The Beatles releases of the time were mono.) Apparently the film was released in mono. But as I say, it sounds quite good -- the balance of dialog, sound effects and music is exemplary.Menu. Well, again, Warner Archive releases have zilch menus. In this case: ""Play"" and ""Trailer"" with a picture of a WB water tower in the background. That's it.The production is top notch -- money spent shows on the screen. Cast and crew are excellent. Story and character development are good though I wish they didn't tinker with the order of and depiction of historical fact -- the marine rescue occurred subsequent to the demise of the 109 while Kennedy commanded the 59, a memorial service was held for the crew of the 109 while the survivors were still stranded, the natives were sent by the coast watcher to find the survivors, Kennedy deeply regretted the loss of life in the incident, etc. These things could have been handled better. The producers needed to make an entertaining film so fact, as usual, is fodder for the mill. Switching directors early on may have led to some structural issues? I've never read the original script and am in no position to second guess. The film score is serviceable -- it works well in film -- but it could have helped to shape the film better. And maybe that's the issue here, the shaping of the film as a whole.This film isn't for everyone. The story takes its time, unfolding slowly (some may say too slowly). There are occasional lapses of logic -- say, don't PT boats have anchors to prevent drifting? All in all, make no mistake, this *is* a well crafted, (sometimes) engaging film that keeps your attention for its 140 minute length. It's good -- but it could have been great.I sincerely hope WB plans to do a proper remastering for a future Blu-ray. What we have here really looks and sounds great. But there are a couple of minor timing issues when cutting between location exteriors and studio interiors, a stereo mix would be very desirable and a plethora of extras would be *most* welcomed.All minor quibbles aside, this is a fine film with a fine presentation and I'm glad to have it at long last! Thanks to WB for making this available on DVD -- it's a keeper!Now -- bring on the WB DigiBook Collector's Edition Blu-ray!PS -- For a different look at PTs in the South Pacific, have a look at the excellent John Ford / John Wayne film ""They Were Expendable"".",4,PT 109 on WB DVD!,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,4726,"['review', 'WB', 'Archive', 'DVD', 'became', 'available', '2011', 'great',

235196,A7Z2DWCF66Q4H,6300269728,L. Der,"[0, 0]","PT 109 is a movie based on the true World War II story of John F. Kennedy who commanded a pt boat that was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer during the Solomon Islands campaign in 1943 and his heroic efforts that saved his crew. The movie was filmed during the glory of Kennedy's ""Camelot"" presidency (and was released only six months before he was assassinated), so it is more of a glowing tribute to Kennedy and his wartime exploits than it is a war movie. Like most war movies of that era, combat realism and gore are at a minimum, and PT 109 also has a softer edge to it because it honors the popular President.The movie stars Oscar-winning Cliff Robertson as Kennedy. The cast also includes Robert Culp (I SPY), Ty Hardin (BRONCO), James Gregory (BARNEY MILLER, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE), Robert Blake (IN COLD BLOOD, BARETTA, OUR GANG), Grant Williams (THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN) and Norman Fell (THREE'S COMPANY). The uncredited narrator is veteran character actor Andrew Duggan who was a tv mainstay and whose movie credits included IN LIKE FLINT and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY. Ironically, the helmsman on the Japanese destroyer that rammed PT 109 is George Takei who held a similar position as Sulu on the starship Enterprise in STAR TREK.The depiction of PT 109 being rammed by the destroyer is a highlight of the movie. It was filmed from above and shows the bow of the destroyer as it sliced through the starboard side of the pt boat and is impressive to watch. However, there is one continuity problem in the scene in that just before the ramming, it shows one crewman sleeping on the midboat structure and a crewman in the 50 cal. machine gun just behind him with four more crewmen behind them at the stern 20 mm cannon position. However, when the destroyer rams PT 109, the sleeping crewman, the 50 cal. machine gunner and the others are nowhere to be seen. Then the following scene shows the 50 cal. gunner back at his position as the destroyer cuts through the ill-fated pt boat.Another inaccuracy in the movie that is intentional is the depiction of Kennedy and PT 109 saving a group of Marines on the beach as Japanese troops attack. In reality, this rescue mission occurred after PT 109 was sunk and involved Kennedy as commander of PT 59. The commander of the Marine unit was famed Lt. Col. Victor Krulak who promised Kennedy a bottle of whiskey for saving his men. Krulak delivered the bottle to Kennedy 20 years later when Kennedy was President.A second highlight of this movie is to see the Elco pt boats. Although the movie pt boats are replicas (supposedly Navy and USAF rescue motorboats modified to look like pt boats), they are a cool to see---unfortunately, there aren't a lot of movies about pt boats.The video quality on this dvd is very good, but the menu offers no options such as scenes, special features, set up, etc.Overall, despite its fluff content, PT 109 offers a good portrayal of Kennedy's heroic service in World War II, particularly for those who are not familiar with the subject. This would be a good addition to a dvd war movie collection.",3,"good, but fluffy, movie about John F.

235205,AYU9LBROYQBG6,6300269728,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[33, 36]","PT 109 is a 1963 biographical movie which shows the events of John F. Kennedy's actions in command of Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 as an officer of the United States Navy during World War II. The movie was adapted by Richard L. Breen, Vincent Flaherty and Howard Sheehan from the book PT 109: John F. Kennedy in WWII by Robert J. Donovan.The movie stars Cliff Robertson, Ty Hardin, James Gregory, Robert Culp, Robert Blake, Andrew Duggan (the uncredited narrator), Michael Pate and George Takei (uncredited as helmsman on Japanese destroyer, best known as Sulu of Star Trek). The exteriors for the movie were filmed at Little Palm Island (formerly Little Torch Key), a resort in the Florida Keys. Power and fresh water were run out to the island for the movie, allowing the resort to be built years later. The former owner was the local Monroe county sheriff.The most dramatic special effect is what appears to be a full-size set with live actors appearing to be crushed by the bow of a destroyer.In the movie, the PT 109 is reported missing and a search is started. According to National Geographic, and the original book, the boat explosion was observed from other PT boats in the vicinity and it was given up as lost. A memorial service was held at the motor torpedo boat squadron's forward operating base at Rendova while the crew was still marooned on the islands in the vicinity of Japanese-held Kolombagara Island.Solomon Islanders Biuki Gasa and Eroni Kumana were portrayed as random natives, when in fact they were dispatched by the coastwatcher, Arthur Reginald Evans, to find them. The movie holds to the Donovan book version that Kennedy first suggested the idea of using a coconut for a message, using a knife to carve it. Gasa was later interviewed as suggesting the idea and sending Eroni to pluck a fresh coconut. The actors playing Gasa and Kumana were not credited either, though the senior native is mentioned by name when the large canoe arrives.The scene rescuing ambushed Marines is actually covered by the chapter in the book about PT 59, which Kennedy commanded after the PT 109. It was an older model Elco PT boat that was converted to a gunboat with its torpedoes removedThe White House had full approval of casting and aspects of the film. Among other actors considered for the lead were Peter Fonda who objected to having to do his screen test with an impersonation of JFK's voice, [1] Edd Byrnes, Jacqueline Kennedy's choice Warren Beatty, Jeffrey Hunter, and other stars.[2] Kennedy selected Cliff Robertson after viewing their screen tests. Robertson met with President Kennedy who set three conditions on the film; that it be historically accurate, that profits go to the survivors of PT 109 and their families and President Kennedy had the final choice of actor.[3]Kennedy also vetoed Raoul Walsh as the director of the film after screening Walsh's Marines Let's Go and not liking it.[4] Director Lewis Milestone was replaced by Leslie Martinson a prolific experienced Warner Brothers Television director",5,BASED ON A TRUE STORY!,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,3034,"['PT', '109', '1963', 'biographical', 'movie', 'events', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'actions', 'command', 'Motor', 'Torpedo', 'Boat', 'PT-109', 'officer', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'Richard', 'L.', 'Breen', 'Vincent', 'Flaherty', 'Howard', 'Sheehan', 'book', 'PT', '109', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'WWII', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Donovan.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'James', 'Gregory', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'Andrew', 'Duggan', 'uncredited', 'narrator', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'George', 'Takei', 'uncredited', 'helmsman', 'Japanese', 'destroyer', 'best', 'known', 'Sulu', 'Star', 'Trek', 'exteriors', 'movie', 'were', 'filmed', 'Little', 'Palm', 'Island', 'formerly', 'Little', 'Torch', 'Key', 'resort', 'Florida', 'Keys', 'Power', 'fresh', 'water', 'were', 'run', 'out', 'island', 'movie', 'allowing', 'resort', 'be', 'built', 'years', 'later', 'former', 'owner', 'was', 'local', 'Monroe', 'county', 'sheriff.The', 'most', 'dramatic', 'special', 'effect', 'what', 'be', 'full-size', 'set', 'live', 'actors', 'appearing', 'be', 'crushed', 'bow', 'destroyer.In', 'movie', 'PT', '109', 'reported', 'missing', 'search', 'started', 'According', 'National', 'Geographic', 'original', 'book', 'boat', 'explosion', 'was', 'observed', 'other', 'PT', 'boats', 'vicinity', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'lost', 'memorial', 'service', 'was', 'held', 'motor', 'torpedo', 'boat', 'squadron', 'forward', 'operating', 'base', 'Rendova', 'crew', 'was', 'still', 'marooned', 'islands', 'vicinity', 'Japanese-held', 'Kolombagara', 'Island.Solomon', 'Islanders', 'Biuki', 'Gasa', 'Eroni', 'Kumana', 'were', 'portrayed', 'random', 'natives', 'when', 'fact', 'were', 'dispatched', 'coastwatcher', 'Arthur', 'Reginald', 'Evans', 'find', 'movie', 'Donovan', 'book', 'version', 'Kennedy', 'first', 'suggested', 'idea', 'using', 'coconut', 'message', 'using', 'knife', 'carve', 'Gasa', 'was', 'later', 'interviewed', 'suggesting', 'idea', 'sending', 'Eroni', 'pluck', 'fresh', 'coconut', 'actors', 'playing', 'Gasa', 'Kumana', 'were', 'not', 'credited', 'either', 'senior', 'native', 'mentioned', 'name', 'when', 'large', 'canoe', 'arrives.The', 'scene', 'rescuing', 'ambushed', 'Marines', 'actually', 'covered', 'chapter', 'book', 'PT', '59', 'Kennedy', 'commanded', 'PT', '109', 'was', 'older', 'model', 'Elco', 'PT', 'boat', 'was', 'converted', 'gunboat', 'torpedoes', 'removedThe', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'full', 'approval', 'casting', 'aspects', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'considered', 'lead', 'were', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'who', 'objected', 'having', 'do', 'screen', 'test', 'impersonation', 'JFK', 'voice', '1', ']', 'Edd', 'Byrnes', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy', 'choice', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'other', 'stars', '2', ']', 'Kennedy', 'selected', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'viewing', 'screen', 'tests', 'Robertson', 'met', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'set', 'three', 'conditions', 'film', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'profits', 'go', 'survivors', 'PT', '109', 'families', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'final', 'choice', 'actor', '3', ']', 'Kennedy', 'also', 'vetoed', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'director', 'film', 'screening', 'Walsh', 'Marines', 'Let', 'Go', 'not', 'liking', '[', '4', ']', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'was', 'replaced', 'Leslie', 'Martinson', 'prolific', 'experienced', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Television', 'director']",N/A

There are a couple of other reviews that do just that and are probably much more competant to render an opinion than I am.However, I have seen the movie several times and own a VHS copy. I've been waiting for the DVD to make an appeaarance. And it looks like this is about to happen shortly.The film covers JFK in his role as a Naval officer in World War II as the commander of a Patrol/Torpedo boat --- numbered 109. Cliff Robertson was an excellent choice of actors to potray the young Kennedy and played the part admirably. The story starts out with the assignment of Kennedy to a PT boat squadron in the Pacific; only to find that there are no boats available for the new commander. However, there is an old decreped boat (number 109) sitting in dock and covered with debris. The boat needs a lot of work to make it seaworthy and a bit of hunting to find a crew. However, Kennedy tackles the job with enthusiasm and soon has the craft up to snuff to pass the most rigorous inspection the Squadron Commander can give it.The story continues with the first couple of missions on which 109 is a part of. Good war sequences all. This, along with the preparation of the boat comprise the first third to half of the film.Then, as the boat is on patrol, it is rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer; leaving the crew burned and vulnerable in dangerous and occupied waters. The second part of the film concerns itself with Kennedy taking the lead and getting the bulk of his crew to the nearest atoll for survival. Looking for a friendly vessel to rescue them, Kennedy makes the decision to move the group from the atoll they are on to another some miles away, where their chances of rescue will be better.As the story winds up, the crew is finally found and recovered by US Naval forces and Kennedy gets a new boat to command.This is an inspiring story which was well told in the film. I did enjoy the first half of the movie much more as the swim to the atoll and subsequent waiting for rescue dragged for me. But then, that's just me. I'm sure the story is true to the accounts as JFK had the final say in most of the production of this film.All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good naval action/adventure timed in World War II, Pacific area. Although not as action packed as a film such as ""Midway"", this has a place as a tale of the lesser known Torpedo boats and the role they played in the war.I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD as it has not been released yet. But I'm sure it will at least meet the usual standards we all now expect from digital discs. We'll have to wait and see if there are any extras on the DVD or if it's just going to be the film itself. I would vote for an interview with Robertson and one with John Kennedy (I'm sure that there is an interview in the archives available, made before the untimely assassination of the president).Here's hoping.~PJM~",4,An entertaining film ...,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,2998,"['wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'talk', 'offer', 'opinion', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', 'just', 'are', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'competant', 'render', 'opinion', 'am.However', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'own', 'VHS', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'make', 'appeaarance', 'happen', 'shortly.The', 'film', 'JFK', 'role', 'Naval', 'officer', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'commander', 'Patrol/Torpedo', 'boat', 'numbered', '109', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'actors', 'potray', 'young', 'Kennedy', 'played', 'part', 'admirably', 'story', 'out', 'assignment', 'Kennedy', 'PT', 'boat', 'squadron', 'Pacific', 'only', 'find', 'are', 'boats', 'available', 'new', 'commander', 'However', 'old', 'decreped', 'boat', 'number', '109', 'sitting', 'dock', 'covered', 'debris', 'boat', 'lot', 'work', 'make', 'seaworthy', 'bit', 'hunting', 'find', 'crew', 'However', 'Kennedy', 'job', 'enthusiasm', 'soon', 'craft', 'up', 'snuff', 'pass', 'most', 'rigorous', 'inspection', 'Squadron', 'Commander', 'can', 'give', 'it.The', 'story', 'first', 'couple', 'missions', '109', 'part', 'Good', 'war', 'sequences', 'preparation', 'boat', 'comprise', 'first', 'third', 'half', 'film.Then', 'boat', 'patrol', 'rammed', 'sunk', 'Japanese', 'destroyer', 'leaving', 'crew', 'burned', 'vulnerable', 'dangerous', 'occupied', 'waters', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'concerns', 'Kennedy', 'taking', 'lead', 'getting', 'bulk', 'crew', 'nearest', 'atoll', 'survival', 'Looking', 'friendly', 'vessel', 'rescue', 'Kennedy', 'decision', 'move', 'group', 'atoll', 'are', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'chances', 'rescue', 'will', 'be', 'better.As', 'story', 'up', 'crew', 'finally', 'found', 'recovered', 'US', 'Naval', 'forces', 'Kennedy', 'new', 'boat', 'command.This', 'inspiring', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'told', 'film', 'did', 'enjoy', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'swim', 'atoll', 'subsequent', 'waiting', 'rescue', 'dragged', 'then', 'just', ""'m"", 'sure', 'story', 'true', 'accounts', 'JFK', 'had', 'final', 'say', 'most', 'production', 'film.All', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'naval', 'action/adventure', 'timed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pacific', 'area', 'not', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'such', 'Midway', 'place', 'tale', 'lesser', 'known', 'Torpedo', 'boats', 'role', 'played', 'war.I', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'least', 'meet', 'usual', 'standards', 'now', 'expect', 'digital', 'discs', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'vote', 'interview', 'Robertson', 'one', 'John', 'Kennedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'interview', 'archives', 'available', 'made', 'untimely', 'assassination', 'president', 'hoping.~PJM~']",N/A

He was a war hero by all telling of this story back then, and knight in shining armor of the American Camelot. A leader loved and envied by all the good people's of the Earth. All of us kids then, especially young boys,  were enthralled by the story of his WWII heroism as the commander of PT-109. In that time, most people in the civilized and reading nations on the planet knew his story.If you do not know it, Kennedy's Patrol Torpedo boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer. For the next 12 days, Jack Kennedy led and inspired the eleven survivors until rescue came, which he had a personal part in arranging. That's the story in a sentence or two. That courage, suffering, good and bad fortune played parts in the story cannot be denied. That's what this movie depicts, but in 1962, the story was wrapped in too much patriotism and somewhat cliched roles and some very whitewashed, shortened, and wooden acting by principal characters. This is not entirely the fault of the actors, but more from the fact that the story was produced under the direct guidance of studio owner Jack Warner. Interviews with some cast and crew members in the past fifty years mention rewrites of events and characters to emphasize and perhaps deify the story of a future president, who was in office as the movie was being produced; was a personal friend of Mr. Warner as well; and was Hero of the non- communist world at the height of the Cold War. This is not to lesson the courage of Lt. Kennedy, but lets not all think his were the only heroic acts by the 12 shipwrecked American sailors. It would be interesting to see a remake of this story today, by a Hollywood that has told more accurate, realistic and gritty stories for the screen since the 1960s.As a WWII war film, give it about a six out of ten for action...it's there, but sort of limp, and acted too stiffly, even compared to the earlier 1940s war films and patriotic themes.

What I truly enjoyed about this movie were the boats themselves.  Really great footage of beautifully restored 80 footers running at speed; always a fantastic sight.
