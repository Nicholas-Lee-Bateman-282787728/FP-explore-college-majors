929159,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B000ANVPYW,Alanna Evans,"[2, 2]","My Little Pony - A Very Minty Christmas is a great holiday movie overall.  The songs have that old fashioned holiday spirit charm (with the exception of the fun ""Socks"" song).  The movie is about one clumsy little pony who breaks the beacon of their Christmas celebration, the ""Here Comes Christmas Candy Cane"" which guides Santa to Ponyville every year.  With that broken and the threat of no Santa, Minty decides to go to the North Pole herself and make things right again.  The ponies are all well animated, the movie looks great, and the Christmas theme is all Xmas trees, bright lights and the caring goodwill of seasonal cheer.  Nothing religious, but not every movie should be!  So this should be a great movie to show to any varied groups of youngsters since there's no religious bent, no violence or scary moments (other than some wind whipping a hot air balloon around).Those that thought that there needed to be some evildoers in a Christmas movie need to think again... this is a Holiday flick!  Its supposed to be warm, fluffy and filled with good cheer.

Our daughter who is two has just in the last couple of months shown preference for certain things and she has chosen My Little Pony, Strawberry Shortcake and the Princesses, typical girly things.  This DVD was a great choice for her because it is sweet, colorful, has a good message of friendship and the songs are great!  Plus she loves horses.  Our first daughter didn't care for girly things, preferring instead to watch Star Wars with her brother.  So, ten years later, we finally have a girly girl to share things like MLP and SS with!  You'll love this DVD and I highly recommend it for your holiday collection, along with Berry Merry Christmas.  Our daughter loves it so much that I am going to purchase the holiday Minty for her that is available.  It plays a song from the movie.  That way, she can watch and cuddle Minty too!
