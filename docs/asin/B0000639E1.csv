693957,A32C82POOSR4ZP,B0000639E1,"C. Minnick ""Life is cartoons and sports.  Eve...","[2, 2]","I am really hooked on the whole series.  I don't have cable and took a chance with the first DVD, and am yet to be let down.  This is the best of the series as of it's release.The first episode is typical of the series, which is great sci-fi.  The crew is still being hunted by a rogue Peacekeeper commander, and they receive a distress call.  The plot moves at a good pace, the story flows very well, and the make-up and effects work are all of great quality.The second episode on the DVD can only be called outstanding work.  Typical of every season-ending cliffhanger, I was quite upset that I would have to wait and see how it would end when the next DVD comes out.  Sorry, I am not a spoiler type, but this episode has the overall theme of things coming to a head.  They are still sitting in an asteroid belt, they are still getting slowly dialed in on, and it is only a metter of time before something will happen.  Moya won't leave the baby, the baby can't jump on it's own, they don't have room to get out and things are getting tense.  Then, of course, you are left with the obligatory highly open ending as the season comes to a close.The good news is there IS a next season, unlike Space: Above and Beyond, for those who remember that show.  With luck, they will soon be on DVD in a short amount of time.",5,Outstanding television,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,1315,"['am', 'really', 'hooked', 'whole', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'took', 'chance', 'first', 'DVD', 'am', 'yet', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'best', 'series', 'release.The', 'first', 'episode', 'typical', 'series', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'crew', 'still', 'being', 'hunted', 'rogue', 'Peacekeeper', 'commander', 'receive', 'distress', 'call', 'plot', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'make-up', 'effects', 'work', 'are', 'great', 'quality.The', 'second', 'episode', 'DVD', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'outstanding', 'work', 'Typical', 'season-ending', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'quite', 'upset', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'when', 'next', 'DVD', 'out', 'Sorry', 'am', 'not', 'spoiler', 'type', 'episode', 'overall', 'theme', 'things', 'coming', 'head', 'are', 'still', 'sitting', 'asteroid', 'belt', 'are', 'still', 'getting', 'slowly', 'dialed', 'only', 'metter', 'time', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'Moya', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'baby', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'get', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'tense', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'left', 'obligatory', 'highly', 'open', 'ending', 'season', 'close.The', 'good', 'news', 'next', 'season', 'Space', 'Above', 'Beyond', 'who', 'remember', 'show', 'luck', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'DVD', 'short', 'amount', 'time']",N/A

Hiding out in an asteroid belt, the crew discovers two inhabitants on a verdant asteroid, each claiming that the other is responsible for killing its compatriots.  There are some chilling moments, but it remains a three-star effort.""Family Ties"" raises the bar considerably.  Still hiding in the asteroid belt, Crichton (Ben Browder) and company are forced to take huge risks in order to preserve their own lives and that of Talon, the offspring of their living spacecraft, Moya.  Rygel appears to be defecting, Crais (Lani Tupu) appeals to Crichton and the others after losing his power struggle with Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), and events culminate in a snafu of galactic proportions that would seem to sever contact among our characters forever.  This important episode introduces plot elements that will play out over the course of many episodes and seasons.

693959,A2HKBL4AP6WHEN,B0000639E1,"John Kahane ""book and movie lover""","[4, 4]","And so it ends...  Yes, the first season of FARSCAPE is finally complete on DVD with the release of the eleventh DVD from ADV Films.  The wild ride that FARSCAPE provided to the fans continued into the twenty-first and twenty-second episodes of the series, and when all is said and done, one is just left wanting more!  That's how good these two season finale episodes are, and that's saying a lot given the recent episodes prior to this.The DVD begins with &quot;Bone to Be Wild&quot;, a story that finds Moya and her child at a critical juncture, and Crichton, D'Argo and Zhaan answering a distress call from a nearby asteroid.  There they find M'Lee and Br'Nee, the last of a race of calcivores and an expedition of scientists, respectively, but which is which?  With the characters' lives on the line, Crichton must make the right choice, while back on the ship, Moya's child is causing headaches for the Leviathan herself - and she decides to send Aeryn over to her child to see what's going on, and try and save the situation.  Meanwhile, the relationship (if it can be called that) heats up between Scorpius and Crais, and the comeuppance of the PK we love to hate is upon us.  Overall, &quot;BtBW&quot; is a superb episode, one that deals with the issue of trust, deceitfulness and treachery, and appearances not being what they seem.  The extra footage on the DVD enhances the episode, and certainly makes a few things clearer.  When one adds the commentary version of this episode with Anthony Simcoe (D'Argo), well...let's just say a lot of things about this episode come to light, and present it in a new light!The second episode on the DVD, &quot;Family Ties,&quot; is the season finale...and what a finale it is.  With Scorpius continuing to hunt for Moya and her child, Talyn, Rygel appears to betray the crew of Moya and departs for the Command Carrier, delivering himself into the hands of Crais and Scorpius.  But seeing that Crais has lost control of the situation and that he needs to escape Scorpius's grasp as much as the Hynerian himself, Rygel makes a deal with Crais that delivers Crais into the hands of Moya's crew!  Meanwhile, Crichton and D'Argo come up with a daring plan to deal Scorpius a major blow, while at the same time allowing Moya and Talyn to escape via Starburst - but there's a good chance that one or both of them won't be coming back alive.  And things get somewhat more complicated when Crais has a plan of his own, that involves Moya's child!  A truly fantastic end to the first season of FARSCAPE, this episode has everything in it, with some lovely plot twists and turns, some surprises, and some definitely unexpected elements.  The commentary version of this with Ben Browder and Claudia Black is worth the price of the DVD alone, but it's the extra footage in this episode that makes it special.Not only does one get the two episodes and their commentary versions, but there are also two Profiles - one of David Kemper, one of Rockne S. O'Bannon - as well as the Creature Shop, so there's some useful stuff here.  Now that it appears the deal has been worked out with Henson and company, there will be extras on all the DVDs from this one forward.  Add to this all the usual extras, and this DVD is one of the better ones that has come down the pike.  My only annoyance with this was the terrifying ad at the beginning for ANDROMEDA, indicating that ADV is going to be doing them on video and DVD soon.When all is said and done, well... With the cliffhanger presented at the end of the final episode, one just wants to scream, and go on to the next DVD - but one can't, since ADV is taking their sweet time getting the next season started on DVD.  ADV has done a good job putting out quality DVDs for the FARSCAPE first season, and there's no reason to think that they'll not live up to the same when they do the second season stuff...  In the meantime, patience, patience... :)",4,Grandiose SF at its Best Wraps up FS Season One,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,3929,"['Yes', 'first', 'season', 'FARSCAPE', 'finally', 'complete', 'DVD', 'release', 'eleventh', 'DVD', 'ADV', 'Films', 'wild', 'ride', 'FARSCAPE', 'provided', 'fans', 'continued', 'twenty-first', 'twenty-second', 'episodes', 'series', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'one', 'just', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'how', 'good', 'two', 'season', 'finale', 'episodes', 'are', 'saying', 'lot', 'given', 'recent', 'episodes', 'prior', 'this.The', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Bone', 'Be', 'Wild', 'quot', 'story', 'Moya', 'child', 'critical', 'juncture', 'Crichton', ""D'Argo"", 'Zhaan', 'answering', 'distress', 'call', 'nearby', 'asteroid', 'find', ""M'Lee"", ""Br'Nee"", 'last', 'race', 'calcivores', 'expedition', 'scientists', 'respectively', 'characters', 'lives', 'line', 'Crichton', 'must', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'back', 'ship', 'Moya', 'child', 'causing', 'headaches', 'Leviathan', 'send', 'Aeryn', 'child', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'try', 'save', 'situation', 'Meanwhile', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'up', 'Scorpius', 'Crais', 'comeuppance', 'PK', 'love', 'hate', 'Overall', 'quot', 'BtBW', 'quot', 'superb', 'episode', 'one', 'issue', 'trust', 'deceitfulness', 'treachery', 'not', 'being', 'what', 'seem', 'extra', 'footage', 'DVD', 'episode', 'certainly', 'few', 'things', 'clearer', 'When', 'one', 'commentary', 'version', 'episode', 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', ""D'Argo"", 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'lot', 'things', 'episode', 'come', 'light', 'present', 'new', 'light', 'second', 'episode', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Family', 'Ties', 'quot', 'season', 'finale', 'what', 'finale', 'Scorpius', 'continuing', 'hunt', 'Moya', 'child', 'Talyn', 'Rygel', 'betray', 'crew', 'Moya', 'departs', 'Command', 'Carrier', 'delivering', 'hands', 'Crais', 'Scorpius', 'seeing', 'Crais', 'lost', 'control', 'situation', 'escape', 'Scorpius', 'grasp', 'as', 'much', 'Hynerian', 'Rygel', 'deal', 'Crais', 'Crais', 'hands', 'Moya', 'crew', 'Meanwhile', 'Crichton', ""D'Argo"", 'come', 'up', 'daring', 'plan', 'deal', 'Scorpius', 'major', 'blow', 'same', 'time', 'allowing', 'Moya', 'Talyn', 'escape', 'Starburst', 'good', 'chance', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'alive', 'things', 'get', 'somewhat', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Crais', 'plan', 'own', 'Moya', 'child', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'FARSCAPE', 'episode', 'everything', 'lovely', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'definitely', 'unexpected', 'elements', 'commentary', 'version', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'extra', 'footage', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'get', 'two', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'versions', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'Profiles', 'one', 'David', 'Kemper', 'one', 'Rockne', 'S.', ""O'Bannon"", 'as', 'well', 'Creature', 'Shop', 'useful', 'stuff', 'here', 'Now', 'deal', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'Henson', 'company', 'will', 'be', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'one', 'forward', 'Add', 'usual', 'extras', 'DVD', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'only', 'annoyance', 'was', 'terrifying', 'ad', 'beginning', 'ANDROMEDA', 'indicating', 'ADV', 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'video', 'DVD', 'soon.When', 'said', 'done', 'well', 'cliffhanger', 'presented', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'one', 'just', 'scream', 'go', 'next', 'DVD', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ADV', 'taking', 'sweet', 'time', 'getting', 'next', 'season', 'started', 'DVD', 'ADV', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'out', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'FARSCAPE', 'first', 'season', 'reason', 'think', ""'ll"", 'not', 'live', 'up', 'same', 'when', 'do', 'second', 'season', 'stuff', 'meantime', 'patience', 'patience']",N/A
