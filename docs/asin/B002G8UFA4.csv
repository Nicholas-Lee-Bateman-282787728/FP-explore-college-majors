My only disappointment was that the episodes ended and I was hoping for more. I was able to pre order season six and am looking forward to more of the predicaments of Judge Deed, his daughter, and his on again-off again relationships. I was disappointed that there were not more episodes in the series (5). If they were withheld for political reasons, censorship, or copyrights issues, than it is a disappointment. In any case, the episodes that are available with the series are first rate !",4,Very Entertaining !,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,606,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'episodes', 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'episodes', 'ended', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'was', 'able', 'pre', 'order', 'season', 'six', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'predicaments', 'Judge', 'Deed', 'daughter', 'again-off', 'again', 'relationships', 'was', 'disappointed', 'were', 'not', 'more', 'episodes', 'series', '5', 'were', 'withheld', 'political', 'reasons', 'censorship', 'copyrights', 'issues', 'disappointment', 'case', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'series', 'are', 'first', 'rate']",N/A

Too bad they didn't get a chance to correct some of the errors and still come up with an intelligent continuing drama.  It would have been interesting to see the judge wrestle with decisions based on erroneous data.  (The missing episodes can be found on YouTube so that the continuity isn't totally lost.)  Otherwise this is such good, intelligent drama offering considerable insight into the workings of the British legal system, with of course the spice of the humans' lives.  Okay so the &#34;snogging&#34; is getting a little bit more unbelievable maybe, but Martin Shaw...., he's still got it, and the depicted relationships are really well written and portrayed by this excellent cast.",4,Not All There,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,807,"['series', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'meaty', 'then', 'network', 'had', 'buckle', 'censors', 'science', 'was', 'flawed', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'correct', 'errors', 'still', 'come', 'up', 'intelligent', 'continuing', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'judge', 'wrestle', 'decisions', 'based', 'erroneous', 'data', 'missing', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'YouTube', 'continuity', ""n't"", 'totally', 'lost', 'Otherwise', 'such', 'good', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'offering', 'considerable', 'insight', 'workings', 'British', 'legal', 'system', 'course', 'spice', 'humans', 'lives', 'Okay', '34', 'snogging', '34', 'getting', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'maybe', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'still', 'got', 'depicted', 'relationships', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'cast']",N/A

They  are apparently available if you Google long enough (see comments attached to these reviews)--we are trying with difficulty to get them now--But Amazon could get them more easily than individuals, if it would only make the effort.  However,Amazon NEVER responds to customer comment or complaints (I tried their ""arbitration""  process, in a different context, and it's ludicrous).  The easy is something they do very well.  But don't expect them to take one step beyond that. They don't listen, and their system of customer feedback is a fraud, EXCEPT that customers do get to talk to each other.

I've watched him in two different roles - Judge Deed and George Gently.  Very different scripts but Mr. Shaw carries his roles in an excellent, very well played manner.  One compliment I give to most English actors is their talent for the right expression. The raise of an eyebrow tells volumes.  In this series of John Deed, while very good,  my criticisms are, I find too many subplots.  Also Judge Deed and his lady are getting tiresome with their on again off again relationship.  Maybe more sessions with an analyst will help the judge.

1267474,A1VPZBI9YA8ZDC,B002G8UFA4,Moving Pictures Gen,"[19, 22]","The witless wonders at the BBC have outdone themselves this time by preventing the viewers of the ""Judge John Deed Season Five"" DVD from going directly to the ""Root Menu"" contained in the DVD.The viewers will find at the beginning of the DVD that all ""Fast Forward"" ""Next Chapter"" and ""Root Menu"" controls on their DVD players to be DEACTIVATED while all the Previews contained in the DVD are played.  A viewer is forced to watch all the previews on the DVD before being given back control of their DVD player, and allowing the viewer to choose which episode they want to watch.Control of the John Deed Season five DVD is only given back to the viewer after all the previews are first played.So get ready to play the previews at least four times unless you watch all the episodes in one sitting.  (I don't think the BBC makes you go back to the previews again under those circumstances but...hmm... I never did check that.)I previously suspected that the BBC had at first put the idiots in charge of DVD production when ""John Deed's Season One"" came out with three DVDs disks jammed into a single disk case manufactured for one DVD disk.  Seasons two and three improved somewhat with the second and third season's three disks being separated with plastic inserts.  The BBC however again fell into their bad habits, with all three of season four's disks being jammed into a single disk case designed for one disk and with no plastic separators.And then, alas, with Season Five we find again more idiots in charge of DVD production, finding that some witless wonder is afraid that the viewing public might not want to view the previews over and over again, each time a different episode is played.  While bathroom breaks and the mute button are nice workarounds to the foregoing, wouldn't it be nice if we could bring these tort doers before Judge Deed, and charge them perhaps with not ""High Treason"", but with ""High Stupidity""?",1,A Very UN Inter Active DVD,1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,1927,"['witless', 'wonders', 'BBC', 'have', 'outdone', 'time', 'preventing', 'viewers', 'Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'Season', 'Five', 'DVD', 'going', 'directly', 'Root', 'Menu', 'contained', 'DVD.The', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'Next', 'Chapter', 'Root', 'Menu', 'controls', 'DVD', 'players', 'be', 'DEACTIVATED', 'Previews', 'contained', 'DVD', 'are', 'played', 'viewer', 'forced', 'watch', 'previews', 'DVD', 'being', 'given', 'back', 'control', 'DVD', 'player', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'choose', 'episode', 'want', 'watch.Control', 'John', 'Deed', 'Season', 'five', 'DVD', 'only', 'given', 'back', 'viewer', 'previews', 'are', 'first', 'played.So', 'get', 'ready', 'play', 'previews', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'watch', 'episodes', 'one', 'sitting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'BBC', 'go', 'back', 'previews', 'again', 'circumstances', 'hmm', 'never', 'did', 'check', 'previously', 'suspected', 'BBC', 'had', 'first', 'put', 'idiots', 'charge', 'DVD', 'production', 'when', 'John', 'Deed', 'Season', 'One', 'came', 'out', 'three', 'DVDs', 'disks', 'jammed', 'single', 'disk', 'case', 'manufactured', 'one', 'DVD', 'disk', 'Seasons', 'two', 'three', 'improved', 'somewhat', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'three', 'disks', 'being', 'separated', 'plastic', 'inserts', 'BBC', 'however', 'again', 'fell', 'bad', 'habits', 'three', 'season', 'four', 'disks', 'being', 'jammed', 'single', 'disk', 'case', 'designed', 'one', 'disk', 'plastic', 'separators.And', 'then', 'alas', 'Season', 'Five', 'find', 'again', 'more', 'idiots', 'charge', 'DVD', 'production', 'finding', 'witless', 'wonder', 'afraid', 'viewing', 'public', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'view', 'previews', 'over', 'again', 'time', 'different', 'episode', 'played', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'mute', 'button', 'are', 'nice', 'workarounds', 'foregoing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'could', 'bring', 'tort', 'doers', 'Judge', 'Deed', 'charge', 'perhaps', 'not', 'High', 'Treason', 'High', 'Stupidity']",N/A
