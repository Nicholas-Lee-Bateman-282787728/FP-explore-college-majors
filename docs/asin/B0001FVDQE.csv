He really is fantastic in the way he interacts with the mule and makes it quite believable.  The first movie gives us the setting.  Donald O'Connor is in the army in Burma, when all of a sudden he hears a mule talking to him.  Incredulous at first, the mule helps him over seven miles to safety.  And they become steadfast friends.  The mule is quite gruff and proud and always boasts about the fact that his Great-Aunt Regret won the Derby.  But the mule won't talk to just anyone, which makes for very funny scenes with Donald O'Connor as ""Peter Sterling""  trying to convince people that the mule really can talk.

Ala Cyrano de Bergerac, Francis helps Peter to win the girl of his dreams, a shapely nurse named Patricia (Maureen Gelder). Unfortunately, the stubborn mule thinks mum's the word whenever Peter tries to tell others of the critter's gift of gab: This sends Peter to the psych ward more than once, where he becomes an expert basket-weaver.
