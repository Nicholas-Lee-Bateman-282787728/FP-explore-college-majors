When this is referred to as the ""season of the show"", as it would be when it airs on tv, this IS SEASON 13.  However, if you have been buying sets of the shows in America, it is referred to as SET 20.The picture on the box is also confusing. The figure on the left is John Nettles who has starred in all 13 seasons. He stopped at the end of the season 13 and the actor on the right took over the Barnaby role as his cousin. This actor is shown in this season but it is Ben who remains Barnaby's partner and who should really be shown on the box.  The actor on the right has played the lead in the rest of the series which has already aired in the UK as season 14 and two episodes of season 15.  These numbers have nothing to do with the sets of dvds numbering as they are being released in the USA.You may find this useful as it can be very confusing if you are following this show in more than one viewing resource.This concluding season for John Nettles is every bit as good as the prior seasons.  The high camp humor continues throughout. The concluding one is rather poignant as we learn then that John Nettles is retiring as Chief Inspector Barnaby. The show as a whole has cast a satiric gaze on the UK murder mystery which features the grisliest murders in the most bucolic and idyllic village settings. Throughout their polite, purpose filled days in leading proper lives, these people are capable of quite compelling bits of violence and the detectives find them out with their own inventive and amusing ways.",5,"Be Careful, sets and series numbered differently",1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1655,"['have', 'been', 'very', 'confused', 'listing', 'dvd', 'finally', 'read', 'review', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'answered', 'questions', 'When', 'referred', 'season', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'tv', 'IS', 'SEASON', '13', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'sets', 'shows', 'America', 'referred', 'SET', '20.The', 'picture', 'box', 'also', 'confusing', 'figure', 'left', 'John', 'Nettles', 'who', 'starred', '13', 'seasons', 'stopped', 'end', 'season', '13', 'actor', 'right', 'took', 'over', 'Barnaby', 'role', 'cousin', 'actor', 'shown', 'season', 'Ben', 'who', 'Barnaby', 'partner', 'who', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'shown', 'box', 'actor', 'right', 'played', 'lead', 'rest', 'series', 'already', 'aired', 'UK', 'season', '14', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', '15', 'numbers', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'sets', 'dvds', 'numbering', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'USA.You', 'may', 'find', 'useful', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'are', 'following', 'show', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'resource.This', 'concluding', 'season', 'John', 'Nettles', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'prior', 'seasons', 'high', 'camp', 'humor', 'concluding', 'one', 'rather', 'poignant', 'learn', 'then', 'John', 'Nettles', 'retiring', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'show', 'whole', 'cast', 'satiric', 'gaze', 'UK', 'murder', 'mystery', 'grisliest', 'murders', 'most', 'bucolic', 'idyllic', 'village', 'settings', 'polite', 'purpose', 'filled', 'days', 'leading', 'proper', 'lives', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'quite', 'compelling', 'bits', 'violence', 'detectives', 'find', 'out', 'own', 'inventive', 'amusing', 'ways']",Midsomer Murders: Set 20 (Master Class / The Noble Art / Not in My Backyard / Fit for Murder)

1522552,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B006X202AM,FYI,"[67, 71]","Good news: the excellent actor Neil Dudgeon, featured in earlier episodes of Midsomer, andThe Mrs. Bradley Mysteries, among many other roles, will lead as John Barnaby, a relative of irascible, inimitable Tom Barnaby/John Nettles. He doesn't enter until the last episode, when his visit to Tom's home is interrupted by yet another murder in that particularly dangerous corner of Midsomer, Badger's Drift, when a vicar is found hanging by a bell-rope. And now we all anticipate ""Set 21,"" the wait will be worth it. As always, the intrepid Jason Hughes is a wonderful foil as Detective Sergeant Ben Jones, his wry humor adds another level of complexity to the series. The U.K. boasts so many fine, often underrated actors. Jane Wymark as Joyce Barnaby is perfection (catch this gifted actress in an early, tragic role in the second series of Poldark), as is Laura Howard as their understanding daughter.Midsomer County is oddly rife with uncanny mysteries, so it's good that John Barnaby is gifted with the same powers of keen observation and memory as his cousin Tom. A ""similar-looking"" man was a gifted gardener in an early Midsomer mystery; DCI John Barnaby is likely as good with plants as his look-alike. This is a Midsomer family after all, they often feature peculiar, recurring family resemblances (recall the duo in first Midsomer Mystery, ""The Killings of Badger's Drift""). Sharp dialogue makes this collection a real treat. Don't assume this is lace doily stuff, no indeed! We even love the weird and unique music. Note the badger emblem on the police cars. The Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens.This series is a virtual escape to the beautiful but dangerous environs of Midsomer county. We're happy to fall through the cracks of normal reality, into Midsomer, whose denizens inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises. The cleverness of this series is addictive.Master Class: Lydia Wilson is superb as Zoe Stock, a gifted pianist, haunted by strange visions. Competition is deadly for positions in Sir Michael Fielding's master class. Long buried secrets are unearthed, several denizens seem to have issues with bright lights, and the dead contact the living. The theme of eugenics is shown in all it's ugliness.The Noble Art: Who knew that with boxing and gambling, we'd get a chance to see Jackie Tyler again, Rose's mom from Doctor Who?! Camille Coduri does a luscious turn, with one of the best Midsomer lines ever, to an odious prig: ""Is that a smile, or your lips just sliding off your teeth?""Not in My Backyard: Oh, those dratted contemporary designs besmirching our villages. Some of the best, most improbable innovative Midsomer murders take place here, via sliding doors and cement. But what do you expect when Jekyll/Tom Jackman's mama makes a guest appearance.Fit for Murder: Poor Joyce, she just wants to take her Tom to a retreat, to calm him down. But murder and mayhem ensue, because when Joyce arrives on the scene, Midsomer's citizens meet untimely, gruesome ends. Tom Barnaby finds himself confronting his birthday and visions of his difficult father. Appearances by Cully and DCI John Barnaby enrich this delightful episode. Surprise: guest-star appearance of excellent actor Shaun Dingwall, who perfectly played Pete Tyler, errant husband of Jackie (above, in ""The Noble Art""), father of Doctor Who's Rose.

He' crime tough, humorous, softly romantic, but makes every episode always suspenseful murders in the plural. Never one murder mystery in Midsomer County, a quaint picturesquely filmed area of village sets.If you are new to Midsomer Murders and CI Barnaby there are years of award winning episodes to view. My favorite is ALWAYS the one I just viewed.Wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), daughter Cully (Laura Howard) & DC Stephens (Kirsty Dillon) all make this set their exit from this long-running British TV show, as does Nettles. Cast regulars DS Jones (Jason Hughes) and Dr. Bullard (Barry Jackson) will remain for future episodes with DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) leading those investigations. John Barnaby is involved in this set's last episode. A smashing series but there will be those upset and downplaying the future once Nettles is gone. He does leave large shoes to fill, as does the departing cast that exits behind him. But that's set 21, not 20, so why worry now, and the shows will yet be based on Caroline Graham novels, and the writing has been a huge factor in the longevity which started in 1997.SUBTITLES available in all 4 longer-than-feature-length episodesGuest stars (too numerous to mention them all) are as characteristic of Midsomer Murders as the multiple murders and multiple plots mixing humor, crime, and relationships, and beautiful scenes. I've heard on bonus materials in the past that stars beg to kill or be murdered in Midsomer.Episodes:~~~~MASTER CLASS -a Barnaby d&eacute;j&agrave; vu mystery suicide-drowning and baby abandonment with a musical twist.~~~~THE NOBLE ART -does the title refer to boxing or all of the local adulterous activity, gender mix, in the small community? Whatever, it results in numerous murders.~~~~NOT IN MY BACK YARD -new development plans have supporters, participants, opposition, everything but apathy, and that's a recipe for community strife not to mention murder.~~~~FIT FOR MURDER -a death in a health and fitness spa may be murder, Barnaby at the scene, and the episode will best be known as the final episode with John Nettles.6 2/3 HOURS of time-tested British Mystery Drama entertainment acclaimed around the world. Multiple murders but usually not violently shown nor graphically filmed. The emphasis is on the plots, not shocking blood and violence.

1522560,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B006X202AM,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","The danger with long-running series like MIDSOMER MURDERS is complacency on the part of the producers. Scripts become less imaginative, production values suffer, actors get bored and start &#8220;phoning in&#8221; performances. Aided by the steady hand of producer Brian True-May, MIDSOMER has maintained a standard of excellence throughout its long run that puts many other, newer series to shame. While the show (and its producer) has its critics&#8212;and any show that is on for well over a decade is bound to run the risk of repetition&#8212;MIDSOMER MURDERS, in my opinion, is just as engaging as it was at the beginning.The production values of these four episodes, the uniformly outstanding acting, the plot twists and the obvious care that goes into each mystery, pays dividends in terms of solid entertainment value. It also speaks highly for True-May, who could easily coast along with this successful formula and its loyal audience, but to his credit, he is clearly dedicated to maintaining the integrity of the series.Admittedly, the scenery, the quaintness of village life, the architecture, the customs, the characters &#8211; all of these attributes are fundamental to its charm and success. But the real fun lies in the complexity of the stories. Let&#8217;s review exactly what the series formula is, for those of you who are reading about MIDSOMER MURDERS for the first time.Midsomer County in England is dotted with sunny (obviously a nod to the fantasy aspect of the show), cozy, idyllic, picturesque villages. But what lurks in the shadows? Apparently, a very high percentage of the population harbor murder, mayhem and various sexual perversions in their black little hearts. The show is basically an extended metaphor for the darkness that lies within every member of &#8220;civilized&#8221; society. Fortunately for the sake of society, most of us manage to keep our villainous fantasies in check. Fortunately for the sake of entertainment, a lot of people in Midsomer have lost their inhibitions and their neighbours are dropping like flies. Death comes dressed in the most colourful fashions in MIDSOMER MURDERS. Where else can one find a body bludgeoned into oblivion by vintage wine bottles launched from a catapult? Or a rock star electrocuted on stage by a viciously mis-wired microphone? Macabre humour and dark irony are a staple of every MIDSOMER fan&#8217;s diet.The series remains engaging, top-notch entertainment. The mystery is always solvable, but loaded with twists and turns to keep you guessing. It never fails to be fun and interesting, and never indulges itself by intentionally frustrating the viewer with unsolvable plots. This is quality entertainment, not &#8220;gritty realism&#8221; (which is just a euphemism for unnecessarily graphic violence and sickening language). Thank heavens MIDSOMER MURDERS is not afraid to buck that ugly trend and continue to offer up this truly lovable crime series.MIDSOMER MURDERS is inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham, modern master of the English village mystery. Scripts are based on her main characters, most notably Tom Barnaby, a likable, hardworking family man and astute detective. John Nettles&#8217; intelligent eyes sparkle with an obvious sense of humour in this character. His overall demeanor is one of reliability and kindness. The fact is, series star John Nettles is exceptional. His characterization avoids monotony because he as an actor is just so darn interesting. In some ways, watching Nettles as Tom Barnaby is like putting on a John Wayne movie. You know you&#8217;re going to get a variation on a theme&#8212;but what a theme! Barnaby is an exceptional character in terms of television crime fighters in that he is a normal family man with a loving wife and daughter. He is also a believable age for a senior detective. The drama is in the mystery, not in the man.This is perhaps going to be the saving grace for MIDSOMER MURDERS, as the episode &#8220;Fit for Murder&#8221; marks John Nettles&#8217; departure from the wild and wooly world of policing in Midsomer. It&#8217;s a nervous time for hardcore fans. Tom Barnaby is an old friend by now and will be missed. His replacement, Tom&#8217;s cousin DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon), was introduced in &#8220;The Sword of Guillaume&#8221;, an episode released in SET 19. Jason Hughes will carry on with the series as DS Ben Jones. Fingers crossed that the twisted story lines, excellent dialogue and inspired performances will continue unabated in SET 21. As always, we excitedly await the next murderous plot to crawl out of the dark corners in the lovely villages of Midsomer.",4,Still a marvel.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4646,"['danger',

In 2010 , the lead actor finally decided to call it quits and these are the last four episodes with him. In spite of that the last two seasons have done quite well. That doesn't mean that we the devoted viewers of this show wont miss Inspector Barnaby. This set features four more stories of murder. Each one follows the formula of three murders a show. And the writers always seem to come up with new ideas to frame the murders around. This time there's the disturbing musical murder case, master class. Then one about boxing and gambling , then one that has been covered before , a case about people building on land  a village wants to keep pristine, and the last one taking place in a spa. These episodes deliver good stories and well oiled acting from the lead actors, after all this show has it all down pat. But it's never boring! It's just a fun romp in the beautiful countryside of Southern England. After all we all know this isn't based on reality , it's based on novels and through it all we keep watching. At this stage , some people will start to grow tired of the shows formula, but not MOST of the shows fans. That's why there's hardly any bad reviews. The dvd's have a few extra features on one of them, and the picture is sharp as this was shot on high grade film. In the  uk I believe this set is on blu ray.
