1264563,A1KB2VS9JTCTHQ,B002DYYGO2,Bug DeLug,"[2, 4]","Being a big fan of Rourke, Walken and Polito, I bought this dvd in hopes that it would be a gritty and interesting watch. Unfortunately I was less than impressed with this low-budget affair. First off, the audio and picture transfer are woeful on this dvd. The quality is equal to that of a VHS recording- the presentation is cheap in every respect. But how was the actual movie?Well, it becomes pretty apparent early on that this is a film content with moving only through the low gears. Mickey Rourke does a very odd thing here... He pulls a face throughout the movie that is very strange indeed. He actually looks like a stroke victim, and the effect on the viewer is a little disconcerting. My wife kept laughing throughout, saying, ""What the hell is he doing with his face?"" I was asking the same thing.Mickey Rourke plays Johnny Walker- a washed-up, punchdrunk fighter nearing the end of his career. He doesn't say much, but when he does he comes across more like Mickey Dork than Mickey Rourke... ""What are Granny Smith's? What does Jewish mean?"" He is so simple it is laughable- a case of the writer laying it on a little thick (Excuse the pun).Christopher Walken plays it mostly for laughs, like he knows he is in a terrible movie and is just happy to be getting paid. His little cabaret act really needs to be seen to be believed. It surely must be the nadir of Walken's patchy career.The love-interest is so bland and wooden as to be completely forgettable. Polito is criminally underused. The score by Eric Clapton is cheesy and unexciting.The fight scenes are a lot more realistic than Rocky but the blocking is so bad that you can see that no punch ever really lands. Also, the fights are very unexciting.If you want to see Rourke play a washed-up sportsman then go and watch The Wrestler. I hate to be predictable and say that, but at least that film is well-written and brilliant directed by Aranofsky. This in comparison is just a lumpen mess- a bit like Rourke's once beautiful face.",2,Raging Dull,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,2001,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'Rourke', 'Walken', 'Polito', 'bought', 'dvd', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'gritty', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'low-budget', 'affair', 'First', 'audio', 'picture', 'transfer', 'are', 'woeful', 'dvd', 'quality', 'equal', 'VHS', 'recording-', 'presentation', 'cheap', 'respect', 'how', 'was', 'actual', 'movie', 'Well', 'pretty', 'apparent', 'early', 'film', 'content', 'moving', 'only', 'low', 'gears', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'very', 'odd', 'thing', 'here', 'face', 'movie', 'very', 'strange', 'indeed', 'actually', 'stroke', 'victim', 'effect', 'viewer', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'wife', 'kept', 'laughing', 'saying', 'What', 'hell', 'doing', 'face', 'was', 'asking', 'same', 'thing.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Johnny', 'Walker-', 'washed-up', 'punchdrunk', 'fighter', 'nearing', 'end', 'career', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'when', 'more', 'Mickey', 'Dork', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'What', 'are', 'Granny', 'Smith', 'What', 'Jewish', 'mean', 'so', 'simple', 'laughable-', 'case', 'writer', 'laying', 'little', 'thick', 'pun', '.Christopher', 'Walken', 'mostly', 'laughs', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'happy', 'be', 'getting', 'paid', 'little', 'cabaret', 'act', 'really', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'nadir', 'Walken', 'patchy', 'career.The', 'love-interest', 'so', 'bland', 'wooden', 'be', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Polito', 'criminally', 'underused', 'score', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'cheesy', 'unexciting.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'Rocky', 'blocking', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'see', 'punch', 'ever', 'really', 'Also', 'fights', 'are', 'very', 'unexciting.If', 'want', 'see', 'Rourke', 'play', 'washed-up', 'sportsman', 'then', 'go', 'watch', 'Wrestler', 'hate', 'be', 'predictable', 'say', 'least', 'film', 'well-written', 'brilliant', 'directed', 'Aranofsky', 'comparison', 'just', 'lumpen', 'mess-', 'bit', 'Rourke', 'once', 'beautiful', 'face']",N/A
1264564,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002DYYGO2,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Other reviewers have referred to this as a boxing movie. Though boxing is a large part of it, I would consider it more of a character study.Here's the scoop. Mickey Rourke is Johnny Walker, a punch drunk club boxer who heads to Atlantic City to pick up a couple of fights. Chris Walken, a small time hood on parole, takes an interest in Johnny and thinks they can do good things together. Johnny takes a liking to a young lady who owns a broken down carnival. Can these people find what they're looking for?These are some interesting characters. One could consider Rourke an innocent. He can't talk to women. He doesn't know what a Jew is. He acts out impulsively. He's like a little kid, but he hopes to win a big fight. Walken thinks he's bigger than he is. He dresses garishly. Has a crappy singing act he performs in a strip club. But he wants bigger and better things and wants to make a big score. The young girl just wants to return the carnival to it's former glory and see it as she remembered it as a kid. This is a bleak existence set in an ugly town. It shows the boxing game as brutal and uncaring. Most of the people involved are bottom feeders using humans as ash trays.It's directed and acted well. Rourke is very good and has very few lines. It's all in his look and body language. This was not an easy role to pull off. Walken is....well....Walken. I like him but you've seen this before. The other characters do a stand-up job. Many have noted the music score by Eric Clapton and Mark Kamen. It is outstanding. It just fits right in. Some might question the ending. There's much to question, but I can't say I didn't like it.I don't want to say this is a great movie. It's a very singular vision.

I fall into the latter category, and for me this was just another piece of Mickey Rourke drivel. From the description of the film we find out that Rourke plays a washed-up boxer, but who knew until about midway through the film, when a doctor says that if he were younger he'd tell him to find another job? There's no telling his age from his looks and manners, and since we are given no background about the character, we have no idea what part of his life we are being thrust into, why he's got this attitude (punching his opponents after the bell or after what is supposed to be a clean break), so it's awfully difficult to sympathized or connect with the character in any way. The subplot with Christopher Walken is totally irrelevant, which is too bad, since Walken is the only one on screen who shows any signs of energy and acting ability (though his club routine is very painful to watch). There is no chemistry between Rourke and his ""romantic interest""...hell, there's no chemistry at all between Rourke and ANYONE on screen; he acts throughout as though he were the only one on camera (not atypical for Rourke movies in general when he is the lead). There are so many better boxing films out there (Raging Bull, Champion, Body And Soul, just to name a few), so don't waste your time on this one unless you are a Mickey Rourke fan.",1,So How Do You Feel About Mickey Rourke?,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1413,"['guess', 'love', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'acting', 'dislike', 'intensely', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'was', 'just', 'piece', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'drivel', 'description', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'Rourke', 'washed-up', 'boxer', 'who', 'knew', 'midway', 'film', 'when', 'doctor', 'were', 'younger', ""'d"", 'tell', 'find', 'job', 'telling', 'age', 'looks', 'manners', 'are', 'given', 'background', 'character', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'part', 'life', 'are', 'being', 'thrust', 'why', 'got', 'attitude', 'punching', 'opponents', 'bell', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'clean', 'break', 'awfully', 'difficult', 'sympathized', 'connect', 'character', 'way', 'subplot', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'too', 'bad', 'Walken', 'only', 'one', 'screen', 'who', 'signs', 'energy', 'acting', 'ability', 'club', 'routine', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'chemistry', 'Rourke', 'romantic', 'interest', 'hell', 'chemistry', 'Rourke', 'ANYONE', 'screen', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'camera', 'not', 'atypical', 'Rourke', 'movies', 'general', 'when', 'lead', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'boxing', 'films', 'there', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Champion', 'Body', 'Soul', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'one', 'are', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fan']",N/A

1264571,A33SESUPEK3PGS,B002DYYGO2,Joel S. Schneider,"[7, 7]","This film may not be everyone's cup-of-tea, but I highly reccomend it.  Sure, its dark and painful but it also shows a moment of light coming to a broken soul. Mickey Rourke's performance is incredibly risky and unusual. He plays an aging alcoholic, possibly brain damaged boxer who's practically mute.  Rourke wrote the screen play (under the name, Eddie Cook) but the lead character he portrays has probably no more than a page of dialogue - he's able to deliver a heartbreaking perfomance almost solely through his incredible physical presence. This is the performance that Bob Dylan raved about in his book ""Chronicles"" and although it ended up being nothing like what I imagined, it is so profoundly moving and poetic that its continued to haunt me. I found it even better on the second viewing.  Like, ""The Wrestler"" it draws certain elements from Rourke's life (in this case, his childhood) but its also quite different in how it achieves its effect.  If one expects to see the Rourke charm as displayed in ""The Pope Of Greenwich Village"" or even in ""The Wrestler"" one may be disappointed. ""Homeboy"" is about a character almost totally cut off from the world. I've heard people say its filled with boxing cliches but the reality is that it takes those cliches and turns them on their head. There's no struggle for respect or redemption with cheering crowds and triumphant music.  This film is like a blues and thats one reason that Eric Clapton's soulful score works so well.
