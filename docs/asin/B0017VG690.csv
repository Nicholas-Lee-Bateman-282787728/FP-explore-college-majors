I truly enjoyed every season, the acting was always on top and the storylines always dealth with real issues. Season four is stellar, we are introduced to Ellen who tutors Alex and they fall in love and in real life too. My favorite episodes include: Mr. Wrong, My Tutor, A World to the Wise Part I and II, Teacher's Pet, and Once in Love with Elyse. I highly recommend purchasing season 4, only three seasons left!",5,Could be the best season.,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,494,"['Family', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'acting', 'was', 'always', 'top', 'storylines', 'always', 'dealth', 'real', 'issues', 'Season', 'four', 'stellar', 'are', 'introduced', 'Ellen', 'who', 'tutors', 'Alex', 'fall', 'love', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'include', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'My', 'Tutor', 'A', 'World', 'Wise', 'Part', 'II', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'Once', 'Love', 'Elyse', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'season', '4', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'left']",Family Ties: Season 4

1158045,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B0017VG690,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is absolutely phenomenal, although it is technically preceded by a misguided TV movie called ""Family Ties Vacation,"" where the Keaton family goes to England.  Even this has its good points, as the snobbish nature of Alex is severely tested and the script treats Mallory as an intelligent character.  This is also the one episode of the series shot on film.  As the season opens its basic run, the two-part proper season premiere is one of the best episodes of the series.""The Real Thing"" sneaks up on the viewer with its power, at first seeming like an average episode in its opening act.  As the show unfolds, the natural chemistry of Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton and Tracy Pollan's Ellen Reed makes for an engrossing half-hour.  The show also humanizes Alex over its two parts, as in Part I, he callously picks a potential girlfriend out of a directory and in Part II things don't seem so simple anymore.  Michael J. Fox often turned in some of his best work on ""Family Ties"" when he had to find the emotion in a character that was frequently written to be comically emotionless.  This is exactly the tone of ""The Real Thing,"" and the realistic undertone of the Alex Keaton-Ellen Reed relationship in this episode help make it my personal favorite show of the entire series.This season also introduces Scott Valentine as Nick Moore in the episode ""Mr. Wrong.""  The boyfriend that would stay with Mallory Keaton until the end of the series, Nick is the classic nightmare boyfriend for parents.  The storyline also provides hypocritical conflict, as ex-hippies Steven and Elyse are now united against the kind of person they once were.  Some of Michael Gross' best moments of humor on the series came within the context of his rivalry with Scott Valentine's Nick Moore.Also featuring a young River Phoenix in the episode ""My Tutor,"" the fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is very special.",5,"Tracy Pollan and Scott Valentine combine to help make the fourth season of ""Family Ties"" one of the series' best",1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,1934,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'fourth', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'technically', 'preceded', 'misguided', 'TV', 'movie', 'called', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Vacation', 'where', 'Keaton', 'family', 'England', 'Even', 'good', 'points', 'snobbish', 'nature', 'Alex', 'severely', 'tested', 'script', 'Mallory', 'intelligent', 'character', 'also', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'shot', 'film', 'season', 'basic', 'run', 'two-part', 'proper', 'season', 'premiere', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'Real', 'Thing', 'up', 'viewer', 'power', 'first', 'seeming', 'average', 'episode', 'opening', 'act', 'show', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Alex', 'Keaton', 'Tracy', 'Pollan', 'Ellen', 'Reed', 'engrossing', 'half-hour', 'show', 'also', 'Alex', 'two', 'parts', 'Part', 'callously', 'potential', 'girlfriend', 'directory', 'Part', 'II', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'simple', 'anymore', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'often', 'turned', 'best', 'work', 'Family', 'Ties', 'when', 'had', 'find', 'emotion', 'character', 'was', 'frequently', 'written', 'be', 'comically', 'emotionless', 'exactly', 'tone', 'Real', 'Thing', 'realistic', 'undertone', 'Alex', 'Keaton-Ellen', 'Reed', 'relationship', 'episode', 'help', 'make', 'personal', 'favorite', 'show', 'entire', 'series.This', 'season', 'also', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'Nick', 'Moore', 'episode', 'Mr', 'Wrong', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'stay', 'Mallory', 'Keaton', 'end', 'series', 'Nick', 'classic', 'nightmare', 'boyfriend', 'parents', 'storyline', 'also', 'hypocritical', 'conflict', 'ex-hippies', 'Steven', 'Elyse', 'are', 'now', 'united', 'kind', 'person', 'once', 'were', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'best', 'moments', 'humor', 'series', 'came', 'context', 'rivalry', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'Nick', 'Moore.Also', 'featuring', 'young', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'episode', 'My', 'Tutor', 'fourth', 'season', 'Family', 'Ties', 'very', 'special']",Family Ties: Season 4

It delivers more of the same from the Keatons; harmless humor and situations that go down very pleasently and without much drama.Here there's a new Keaton in town, Andy, and the crowded household finds itself having to sort through various problems that arise. There are new additions as well as Scott Valentine joins the gang as Mallory's not-so-desirable boyfriend Nick and Tracy Pollan (the real Mrs. Michael J. Fox) enters as...you guessed it; Alex's girlfriend Ellen.The standout episode here is the one where Alex can't get any sleep and gradually drives everyone insane in the process. As for the whole season; every cast member has perfected his character and they work really well together. Scott Valentine is a very welcome addition to the show as Nick proves to have a bit more layers than you might have expected and he provides many solid laughs.Overall; if you liked the previous three seasons than this is a no-brainer. Quite often it's a treat to pop one episode in before you dose off and see a happy family sorting things out...and on that note; Sha la la la.",3,Another enjoyable season with the Keatons,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1175,"['Well', 'really', 'need', 'not', 'bother', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'show', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'more', 'same', 'Keatons', 'harmless', 'humor', 'situations', 'go', 'down', 'very', 'pleasently', 'much', 'new', 'Keaton', 'town', 'Andy', 'crowded', 'household', 'having', 'sort', 'various', 'problems', 'arise', 'are', 'new', 'additions', 'as', 'well', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'gang', 'Mallory', 'not-so-desirable', 'boyfriend', 'Nick', 'Tracy', 'Pollan', 'real', 'Mrs.', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'enters', 'guessed', 'Alex', 'girlfriend', 'Ellen.The', 'standout', 'episode', 'here', 'one', 'where', 'Alex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleep', 'gradually', 'everyone', 'insane', 'process', 'whole', 'season', 'cast', 'member', 'perfected', 'character', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'Scott', 'Valentine', 'very', 'welcome', 'addition', 'show', 'Nick', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'layers', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'many', 'solid', 'laughs.Overall', 'liked', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'no-brainer', 'Quite', 'often', 'treat', 'pop', 'one', 'episode', 'dose', 'see', 'happy', 'family', 'sorting', 'things', 'out', 'note', 'Sha', 'la', 'la', 'la']",Family Ties: Season 4

Fox), materialistic Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboy Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross).Additionally; FAMILY TIES was an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and even won various awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.FAMILY TIES 4th Season is also the season when Scott Valentine joins the cast & crew as Mallory's boyfriend(Nick).This 1985-86 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in 7th grade and when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.The original air-dates and titles to each of these 1985-1986 Season episodes9/23/85-FAMILY TIES VACATION9/26/85-THE REAL THING(Part 1)10/3/85-THE REAL THING(Part 2)10/17/85-MR.
