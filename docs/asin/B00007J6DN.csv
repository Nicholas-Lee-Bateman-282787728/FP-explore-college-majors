It was also a big topic of discussion and play on the playground during recess.  Robert the Robot was a favorite.  While it may seem lame by today's standards (with computer graphics and animation), it was great in its day and though it is rarely given any credit, it influenced science fiction series that followed. Another great way to jog the memories of baby boomers!I just wish they would sell individual DVD's of the show or at least do a ""Best of"" DVD with some of the better shows, like they did for ""The Best of Thunderbirds"".

729377,A1TUUSQODOPXOE,B00007J6DN,"Frank Forrest ""Quasar""","[1, 1]","The things I remember most about this program from reruns is the music. I really loved the beginning theme and the ending theme. Other than that, the rest is a blur--except that I seem to recall that I enjoyed some of the shows because they were cool.Enter the 21st century and the Fireball XL5 DVDs are released and I picked up the set from the subliminal memories I had of the show. I still don't remember a thing about any of the episodes but what a great surprise and fun it was to view the first DVD and get totally floored by the scripts, the production values, and the characters in this series.Ok, the silly strings always show in the episodes, but the actors take their parts so seriously that you start to imagine that the marionettes are actually live. The shows exhibit quite a lot of sophistication in the stories as the XL5 crew visits different planets, meet up with space aliens, and interact with each other.The ensemble cast of Steve Zodiac, Matt, and Venus form a tight bond that predates the threesome in the original Star Trek series. There are some scientific goofs in the series such as the crew going out into space without space suits (what, they breath in a vacuum?) but I suppose if they are 100 years into the future, perhaps they had a force-field around them. ;)In any event, each episode is truly enjoyable for me and I am totally in awe with the ""special effects"" the great writing, and voice acting. I'm only up to the second DVD so far, but I'm totally looking forward to view the rest of the set.If you want to see how it was done before CG, pick this set up and marvel (and laugh) at how it was done in the past. In any event, the character actors believed in what they were doing and this totally shows through in the episodes. Hardly a bit of camp or cheese. If it did, it would have made me a ""tootie"" for buying it. :D",5,A Remarkable Surprise,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1858,"['things', 'remember', 'most', 'program', 'reruns', 'music', 'really', 'loved', 'beginning', 'theme', 'ending', 'theme', 'Other', 'rest', 'blur', 'seem', 'recall', 'enjoyed', 'shows', 'were', 'cool.Enter', '21st', 'century', 'Fireball', 'XL5', 'DVDs', 'are', 'released', 'picked', 'up', 'set', 'subliminal', 'memories', 'had', 'show', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thing', 'episodes', 'what', 'great', 'surprise', 'fun', 'was', 'view', 'first', 'DVD', 'get', 'totally', 'floored', 'scripts', 'production', 'values', 'characters', 'series.Ok', 'silly', 'strings', 'always', 'show', 'episodes', 'actors', 'take', 'parts', 'so', 'seriously', 'start', 'imagine', 'marionettes', 'are', 'actually', 'live', 'shows', 'exhibit', 'quite', 'lot', 'sophistication', 'stories', 'XL5', 'crew', 'visits', 'different', 'planets', 'meet', 'up', 'space', 'aliens', 'interact', 'other.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Zodiac', 'Matt', 'Venus', 'form', 'tight', 'bond', 'threesome', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'are', 'scientific', 'goofs', 'series', 'such', 'crew', 'going', 'out', 'space', 'space', 'suits', 'what', 'breath', 'vacuum', 'suppose', 'are', '100', 'years', 'future', 'perhaps', 'had', 'force-field', 'event', 'episode', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'am', 'totally', 'awe', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', ""'m"", 'only', 'up', 'second', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'totally', 'looking', 'forward', 'view', 'rest', 'set.If', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'CG', 'pick', 'set', 'up', 'marvel', 'laugh', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'past', 'event', 'character', 'actors', 'believed', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'totally', 'episodes', 'Hardly', 'bit', 'camp', 'cheese', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'tootie', 'buying', 'D']",Fireball XL5 - The Complete Series

729380,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00007J6DN,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[17, 19]","Fireball XL5 was the second fully-developed Supermarionation series, Supercar being the first. But it was the first Gerry Anderson show to air on a major network (NBC) in the United States. The exploits of Colonel Steve Zodiac, space doctor Venus, professor Matt Matic and Robert the Robot made a big bang in their Saturday morning time slot, and ran for three years. The puppet strings are not as visible as in Supercar, but Fireball XL5 was slow in getting off the ground, and in many ways Supercar was a better show. Unlike Supercar's dynamic opening theme, Fireball opened with moody instrumental music and dramatic shots of the rocket. Professor Matic sounded too much like Supercar's Professor Beaker, but voiceovers make or break a puppet show, and Beaker was the better character. Supercar's casting was better also, with Jimmy and Mitch the monkey for comic relief. The obvious exception was the addition of Venus in Fireball XL5. By the fourth show Fireball had hit its stride, introducing an alien mascot character in the role of Mitch, and a few sparks between Steve and Venus, as hinted at in Barry Gray's clever closing song, smoothly sung by Don Spencer: ""My heart would be a fireball, and you would be my Venus of the stars.""

729381,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00007J6DN,Graves,"[1, 3]","I am a big fan of Gerry Anderson's work. I remember seeing Thunderbirds and Joe 90 and Captain scarlet as a kid and still enjoy watching Thunderbirds today, if only for their nostalga so I was delighted to give Fireball a try. So what if it was in black and white, It's still going to have that wonderful nostalgia feel right? RIGHT? Well no. At least not the nostalgia I was hoping for.The feel of Fireball was less the early 60's, like you get in Thunderbirds than the 1930's Buck Rogers series. The pacing lots f/x all screamed `Buster Keaton.' The other element was the look. I kid you not, after watching just a couple of episodes all I could think was that this was the real seed from which sprung Jim Henson's ""Pigs in Space."" I know that was the `swine trek' but for the look and the crew it was here. The dashing hero/captain, lovely blond lady and old scientist. The scientist on the ship looked like a human version of Strangepork right down to the glasses and eyebrows.There is also a shocking level of sexism on this. ""Venus"" the blond is supposed to be the expert on ""space medicine"" but she is limited in roles to serving coffee, fetching sandwiches, reminding people to take the oxygen pills and serving more coffeeIt isn't all bad. There is some fun here, mostly based on  gee-whiz mind set and the vision of how they thought the world would be in the future. Furniture clothes, cars are all clearly `mod' with a twist. Some things are just too loopy for words. The ""Space Control Center"" is an office block and instead of having rotating antennae on the roof, the entire building rotates! I can't look at it without thinking of how hard it would be to get into work in the morning, jumping as the doors swing by and those poor souls who did get in clinging, desperately to their workstations as they tried to keep lunch down and not lose coffee.In the end I'm glad I saw this.

Having already encountered Supercar on television in the early 1960s, I was thrilled to learn that a newer series was slated to be aired by NBC.

The Andersons' production techniques had improved from Supercar, but some shortcomings were still evident. Still, the character interactions were a joy if a bit trite, and to watch the stories play out in space was a dream come true.

729386,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,B00007J6DN,Keith_Joseph,"[11, 12]","It is 2062, and the World Space Patrol, set at Space City, watches the skies with its fleet of XL spacecraft. The hero of the half hour, Colonel Steve Zodiac, is the pilot of Fireball XL5, the interplanetary rocketship protecting Sector 25 beyond the Solar System from alien invasion. With Steve Zodiac in command, his crew consisted of Venus, a doctor of space medicine, Professor Matic, the science officer, Venus's pet Zoonie the Lazoon, and Robbie the Robot, the rocket's mechanical co-pilot. I was 6 when Fireball XL5 aired and ever since I've been a SciFi and realSci fan, going on from XL5 to the likes Dr Who, Lost in space, the moon landings and a PhD in astrophysics. However despite the oddities of the witty 60's script, the spaceship Fireball XL5, and its accessories like the hover scooters, are a fantastic iconic design (particularly in the colour stills). The storylines are quite strong for a kids series, and the aliens are quite convincing - although we seem to see many of them again quite soon as the fishpeople in Stingray. In many ways Fireball XL5 is has a younger feel to it than later Anderson projects, so I expect boys nearer 5 to 7 would appreciate it most (or those now around 50 who first saw it at this age). I quickly bought this DVD set when it was going particularly cheaply on Amazon.My son at 6 really took to the two XL5 videos I had, and like me he really really loved the Steve Zodiac song sung by Don Spencer at the end of each of episode, and we often used to have sing-alongs with it in the car. Although it was nice and thoroughly `modern' to let Venus (voiced by Sylvia Anderson) leave the nappies and washing behind and come along as part of the crew, it's not long before the good Dr of Space medicine is making the coffee or tripping over and screaming for male assistance. Typical Dr Venus quote `Oh I am a Tootie' - which I presume must be some sort of 2060's space bimbo. So Venus provides the backup for the two batchelor men, like doing the ironing, cooking, cleaning up after them, while also juggling a highly succesful career. Typical Professor Matic quote 'Now now, Venus, none of your feminine intuition. Let's stick to the facts' - I expect they had to cut what happened next.My only regret is that the XL5 series hasn't been colourised in the same manner as the early B&W; Bewitched episodes, as the XL5 spacehip would look great in colour. My son (now 9) hasn't taken to the whole XL5 series as he now can't tolerate the black and white TV - however he absolutely loves the B&W; AP Films co-production `Torchy the battery boy' from 1958 so perhaps he is actually both too young and too old at 9 for this level of SciFi sophistication.

The STINGRAY and CAPTAIN SCARLET sets were perfect....didn't like buying THUNDERBIRDS in the seperate sets BUT I bought them all.I disagree with the first review left here...When ANDERSON did SUPERCAR, this series and STINGRAY... GERRY ANDERSON was hitting his peak, in my opinion.  These are the shows that were much more interesting to watch because they were character driven and had very colorful secondary characters and villians.  I also like the more 'CARTOONY' designs used.  The later series became more about special effects and vehicles.  Not to say THUNDERBIRDS and CAPTAIN SCARLET are not GREAT shows...they are.  I just prefer the earlier work like FIREBALL XL-5.Also, a clip from this series most recently appeared in the TOM HANK'S film 'THAT THING YOU DO' and everyone knows about his admiration of space series, etc., which this falls into nicely.This is a GREAT series!

I would make sure to watch the episodes each Saturday on our round-tubed RCA Victor black and white television, and wouldn't give a hoot if there were puppet wires showing, or the effects were ""cheesy"" according to the great technology of today.  My school lunchbox, and a toy that I played with until it totally fell apart were both Fireball XL5.  I had an actual model of the ship which fired plastic rockets, and included the minature hover craft and our two heroes.  The vehicle would separate into two pieces making it even more ""neato.""  When the DVD box set came out, I was totally surprised.  I had no idea that this show was even still in existence, as well as remastered into some fine memorabilia.  I made sure to add it to my collection.  The memories that it brought back were incredible, and my younger relatives have enjoyed watching such a vintage show.  My brother came to visit and as a surprise I pulled out a disc of the show, and it was like the old Saturday mornings once again.

The theme song made me smile from ear to ear to the extent that I thought my face would break (I always thought the song was at the beginning of each episode, but it is not.... it is at the conclusion of each show).  I was amazed at the quality of the DVD's and the packaging.  This is an A&E product.  I think it was made in Britain originally.  The special features have a narrative by one of the gentlemen that did the puppet's voices.  I agree with the comment someone else offered.... as good as this is I didn't need the entire series.  After watching just a few episodes my nostalgia was more than satisfied.  Too bad they do not offer just a single DVD of episodes (but again the price is very fair for this mega set).  I highly recommend Fireball XL5.
