This highly original screenplay covers new ground in a refreshing, off-beat way, and the actors are up to the challenge.Yes, the behaviour of the characters will seem inappropriate from the beginning. And the people who aleays walk out of the theater BEFORE the credits start rolling will not understand anything they just witnessed, because the characters motivations and secrets are not revealed until during the final credits. The movie ""Wild Things"" which also starred Matt Dillon, resolved all of the surprising plot twists in this manner, during the end credits. This is a far more valuable use of space than the usual ""blooper"" reel of ham actors laughing hysterically at eachother for forgetting their lines.

Employee of the Month, a film that borders along the outskirt territories of film noir and the lowlands of dark comedy, resting somewhere between and finding a new niche as a classic example of why independent films are often the sweetest things since Raquel Welch's thighs.Our plot seems pretty simple: we have a fast-rising banker named David Walsh (Matt Dillon) losing his job at the hands of an arrogant, bottom-line bank manager who cares little-to-nothing for those who work under him. Walsh then begins a hybrid plan of enacting revenge, but soon it becomes clear to the viewer that nothing is as it seems, wherein all parties are capable of betrayal and murderous ambition.A very clever film that is funny enough to keep you watching, and intriguing enough to keep you guessing.4.5 out of 5",4,This 16 seeded movie just made the Elight Eight.,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,907,"['Sorry', 'corny', 'sports', 'metaphor', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'underrated', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Employee', 'Month', 'film', 'outskirt', 'territories', 'film', 'noir', 'lowlands', 'dark', 'comedy', 'resting', 'somewhere', 'finding', 'new', 'niche', 'classic', 'example', 'why', 'independent', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'sweetest', 'things', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'thighs.Our', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'have', 'fast-rising', 'banker', 'named', 'David', 'Walsh', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'losing', 'job', 'hands', 'arrogant', 'bottom-line', 'bank', 'manager', 'who', 'little-to-nothing', 'who', 'work', 'Walsh', 'then', 'hybrid', 'plan', 'enacting', 'revenge', 'soon', 'clear', 'viewer', 'nothing', 'wherein', 'parties', 'are', 'capable', 'betrayal', 'murderous', 'ambition.A', 'very', 'clever', 'film', 'funny', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing.4.5', '5']",N/A

Despite a pretty popular cast, it was overlooked by many people. After watching it, I have to say...There's one-or-two plot holes, the ending and credit sequence is very reminiscent of another Matt Dillon film called ""Wild Things"", but this movie happens to be entertaining, hilarious, and surprising. Oscar Nominee Dillon (Best Supporting Actor, 'Crash') plays David Walsh, who's life seems to be perfect. Well, it was. We actually meet David when he's on a bus sitting next to a man who just soiled himself. We then go back in time to 36 hours later, where David is at his engagement party. David has a big house, a beautiful fiancee named Sarah (Christina Applegate, 'Married...With Children'), and a idiotic con man friend named Jack (Steve Zahn, 'Daddy Day Care') who shows up and ruins the party. Jack is the worse kind of con man; We watch him, in one scene, as he poses as a coroner to steal money and jewelry from freshly deceased corpses. He later gives some of the jewelry away to young strippers. Anyway, we see David go to work at a big bank in his nice car. It's obvious, his life is pretty nice. He's nice to all his co-workers, but we learn it's review day. Then everything crumbles as David is subsequently fired. Oh, and Sarah has found David's co-workers thong in his jacket. The movie, in the last 20 minutes, takes a completely ddifferent turn; But, this is still one of the best dark comedies I've seen recently. While Steve Zahn is responsible for most of the humor (anything that's funny anyway), this is a funny and entertaining movie. If you like dark comedies like ""The Ice Harvest"" and have laughed at anything Steve Zahn has done before...You should like this.GRADE: A-",5,Very Funny,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1869,"['Employee', 'Month', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'forever', 'confused', 'upcoming', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'debuted', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'back', '2004', 'pretty', 'popular', 'cast', 'was', 'overlooked', 'many', 'people', 'watching', 'have', 'say', 'one-or-two', 'plot', 'holes', 'ending', 'credit', 'sequence', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'film', 'called', 'Wild', 'Things', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'surprising', 'Oscar', 'Nominee', 'Dillon', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', ""'Crash"", 'David', 'Walsh', 'who', 'life', 'be', 'perfect', 'Well', 'was', 'actually', 'meet', 'David', 'when', 'bus', 'sitting', 'next', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'soiled', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'time', '36', 'hours', 'later', 'where', 'David', 'engagement', 'party', 'David', 'big', 'house', 'beautiful', 'fiancee', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Christina', 'Applegate', ""'Married"", 'Children', 'idiotic', 'con', 'man', 'friend', 'named', 'Jack', 'Steve', 'Zahn', ""'Daddy"", 'Day', 'Care', 'who', 'up', 'party', 'Jack', 'worse', 'kind', 'con', 'man', 'watch', 'one', 'scene', 'coroner', 'steal', 'money', 'jewelry', 'freshly', 'deceased', 'corpses', 'later', 'jewelry', 'away', 'young', 'strippers', 'Anyway', 'see', 'David', 'go', 'work', 'big', 'bank', 'nice', 'car', 'obvious', 'life', 'pretty', 'nice', 'nice', 'co-workers', 'learn', 'review', 'day', 'Then', 'everything', 'crumbles', 'David', 'subsequently', 'fired', 'Oh', 'Sarah', 'found', 'David', 'co-workers', 'thong', 'jacket', 'movie', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'completely', 'ddifferent', 'turn', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'dark', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'responsible', 'most', 'humor', 'anything', 'funny', 'anyway', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'like', 'dark', 'comedies', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'have', 'laughed', 'anything', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'done', 'should', 'like', 'this.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

This movie is a dark ""in your face"" comedy with well defined yet way out there characters.  I know other reviewers have provided a synopsis but here's mine: basically it's a story of a man, David Walsh, on the fringe of society who attempts to live the American Dream (good job, nice house, beautiful wife, etc.) and manages to actually live it for a while until a corporate weasel steps in and subsequent decisions made by David seal his fate.  For me, this quirky film is one that defines the appeal of the independent genre.  No quarter was given on ANY issue and Lions Gate Entertainment studio deserves credit for having guts to put this movie out there.  No politically correct jokes found here......or situations for that matter.  There is so much offensive behavior to be found that it would take up too much space to list it all and yet that is kind of one of the points of this movie.  You almost feel guilty for laughing out loud at certain spots.  I can certainly see why this film did not do well at the box office, no on would want to admit in public that certain dialogues or scenes while being offensive were also funny.  Yes, there are gay, anti-woman and other the comments made but nothing is relayed with malice, just realism with a twist of dark comedy.  Yet to say that this movie is just a dark comedy is to miss the underlying seriousness of the script, which is intelligent by the way.  Social commentary is brilliantly interwoven in some very disturbing ways.  The themes of the American Dream being just that, a dream and not realistic; people being really worse then what you think (we see David's friend while pretending to be a Coroner, steal from the recently departed at an accident scene and then we learn that the real Coroner is not only a party to this offensive behavior but invades peoples privacy at their death bed by taking photos of them and holding gambling death pools, and I won't even go into the further atrocities committed); past behavior/karma has a way of catching up to you; Corporate America is not something to aspire to; and, that you can change before its too late are all there.  Any now a word about violent content - HIGH.  In certain scenes violence is expected but delivered in unexpected ways.  To sum up, if you are easily offended or violence upsets you, this is a movie you need to pass on.  If you are tired of watching the same old movies and want to try something different then ""Employee of the Month"" is the one to grab. The director and co-writer (Mitch Rouse) presents a highly polished gem of a movie that breaks barriers with its own unique style.  Yes, this movie did remind one of the Coen Brothers but it never imitated just paid homage.

Christina has shown remarkable maturity from early roles and I predict one day may get an Oscar. This dark comedy starts out with our Bank manager or former bank manager riding a bus. After a boring monologue, and sorry attempt at crude humor, the story flashes back 36 hours. David (Matt Dillon) is engaged to Christina. She is clearly out of his league. Steve Zahn is best buddy, a coroner who robs people and hates the establishment. At times he is our voice of reason in this dark comedy. After losing his job and girlfriend in the same day, David is depressed. Steve takes him to a strip club and tells him he needs to start enjoying life. David responds (paraphrase), ""You are going to give a bracket that you stole off a corpse to an 18 year old stripper and have sex in the parking lot while snorting crank off a Bowie knife."" To which Steve responds, ""And your point is?""The most comical scene is at a restaurant where Christina is breaking up with Matt. Her parents (Dad is a preacher) are there. She reads a letter about the break-up and discusses in some detail, their sex life while mom and dad listen.The movie ends up with multiple twists at the end which appears eerily similar the opening bank robbery scene in the ""The Dark Knight.""
