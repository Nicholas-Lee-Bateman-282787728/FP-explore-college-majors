I reacted to it like I did to Eating Out where the straight guy has phone sex with the fag hag...and he enjoys it.  It is not likely but ok.  Todd goes on a blind date with Kelly, thinking it is a girl.  It isn't, his brother put his profile on the 'men seeking men' page...juvenille doesn't begin to describe the brother who grates like stale cheese by the way.  Now this would only work if the guy's name was like Kelly, could be male could be female...ok could happen.  They meet, work out the issue but like each other.  Kelly likes Todd like a gay man likes a yummy man...believable?  Not so much when you see Todd, but ok.  Todd likes Kelly like a friend he isn't sure he is safe with...  I like that they form a really good friendship.  What annoys the crap out of me is, despite his protestations and his life up until now being not gay, it takes a modicum of encouragement for all to think he is gay and welcome him as a big gay icon. One woman even asks for 'back door' advice...say what now?  The mother ought to be put out of my misery, with the brother...pains in the a**.  The most unlikely scenario of the lot?  Todd now questions whether he is gay, he knows he isn't but everyone else says he is so maybe he is??? Yeah right.  What is Kelly's solution?  If you sleep with a gay man and don't hate it you are gay, if you hate it you are straight.  What??  Is that the only test??  And Todd does it, but doesn't seem to hate it...but isn't gay.  Could have told him that.  There are some interesting bits in the Deleted Scenes feature, you get to hear a bit more about this session.  Then the brother gets in on the act, if the mother is accepting Todd is gay and is getting lots of attention then...he is gay.  But no-one believes him, except Todd.  The brother is a big pain in the rear...so why, when Todd is not available because he is straight, does the big pussy pain in the rear seem attractive???  Most implausible part and really grots me.

1087437,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000SQJ28C,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[44, 47]","At the urging of his brother, Barry (Jonathan Silverman), Todd (Jonathan Bray) makes a blind date with someone he had been chatting with online, courtesy of an ad placed by Barry.  Once it has been established that they had not exchanged photos during their chats, most viewers can guess the first punchline of the movie ... that his date, Kelly, is actually a man (played by Wilson Cruz), since Barry had placed the ad for his romance-starved, straight brother in the ""M4M"" message board.But ""Coffee Date"" (2006) ... whichw as based on a short film released at some gay film festivals in 2001 ... handles this seemingly simplistic slapstick-worthy plot with realism, warmth and humor, allowing Todd and Kelly to get to know each other, and find out that they have a lot of interests in common, before either one realizes that their elusive ""date"" is actually with each other.  It also turns the joke around on the brother, when Todd brings Kelly home (and then he sneaks out the window, so Barry believes Todd spent the night with a man), which works too well, since Barry won't believe that Todd isn't really gay, and moves out of Todd's apartment.  Barry also calls their mother, played to the hilt by veteran actress Sally Kirkland, who arrives for an extended visit with her ""just out"" son, proudly wearing a PFLAG t-shirt, and also refusing to give credence to Todd's claim that he is really straight.  Meanwhile, Todd continues to go with Kelly (and occasionally his friends) to see a movie, have a drink or coffee, and when the office blabbermouth (Jason Stuart) sees Todd with a group of gay men, he ""outs"" him to everyone else at work, who accept and embrace the revelation.  It gets to the point where Todd begins to doubt his own belief that he's not gay, but is afraid that the one way of finding out for sure could jeopardize his friendship with Kelly.Excellent treatment of the ""labels"" people put on themselves (and have put upon them), which also makes good natured fun of some of the stereotypes straight people have about gays (and vice versa.)  Ultimately, this is a light romantic comedy about friendship and defining ""love"" on different levels, with life lessons for people hung up on worrying about how they ""should"" feel in a situation.  DVD extras include many deleted scenes, gag reel and a ""making of"" featurette. I give it a full 5 stars out of 5.",5,"Sweet, well written, light comedy looks at friendship and ""love""",1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,2375,"['urging', 'brother', 'Barry', 'Jonathan', 'Silverman', 'Todd', 'Jonathan', 'Bray', 'blind', 'date', 'someone', 'had', 'been', 'chatting', 'online', 'courtesy', 'ad', 'placed', 'Barry', 'been', 'established', 'had', 'not', 'exchanged', 'photos', 'chats', 'most', 'viewers', 'can', 'guess', 'first', 'punchline', 'movie', 'date', 'Kelly', 'actually', 'man', 'played', 'Wilson', 'Cruz', 'Barry', 'had', 'placed', 'ad', 'romance-starved', 'straight', 'brother', 'M4M', 'message', 'board.But', 'Coffee', 'Date', '2006', 'whichw', 'based', 'short', 'film', 'released', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', '2001', 'seemingly', 'simplistic', 'slapstick-worthy', 'plot', 'realism', 'warmth', 'humor', 'allowing', 'Todd', 'Kelly', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'find', 'out', 'have', 'lot', 'interests', 'common', 'one', 'elusive', 'date', 'actually', 'other', 'also', 'joke', 'brother', 'when', 'Todd', 'Kelly', 'home', 'then', 'out', 'window', 'Barry', 'Todd', 'spent', 'night', 'man', 'too', 'well', 'Barry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Todd', ""n't"", 'really', 'gay', 'Todd', 'apartment', 'Barry', 'also', 'mother', 'played', 'hilt', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Sally', 'Kirkland', 'who', 'extended', 'visit', 'just', 'out', 'son', 'proudly', 'wearing', 'PFLAG', 't-shirt', 'also', 'refusing', 'give', 'credence', 'Todd', 'claim', 'really', 'straight', 'Meanwhile', 'Todd', 'go', 'Kelly', 'occasionally', 'friends', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'drink', 'coffee', 'when', 'office', 'blabbermouth', 'Jason', 'Stuart', 'Todd', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'outs', 'everyone', 'else', 'work', 'who', 'accept', 'embrace', 'revelation', 'point', 'where', 'Todd', 'doubt', 'own', 'belief', 'not', 'gay', 'afraid', 'one', 'way', 'finding', 'out', 'sure', 'could', 'jeopardize', 'friendship', 'Kelly.Excellent', 'treatment', 'labels', 'people', 'put', 'have', 'put', 'also', 'good', 'natured', 'fun', 'stereotypes', 'straight', 'people', 'have', 'gays', 'vice', 'versa', 'Ultimately', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'friendship', 'defining', 'love', 'different', 'levels', 'life', 'lessons', 'people', 'hung', 'up', 'worrying', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'situation', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'making', 'featurette', 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', '5']",Coffee Date

Yes, it is light, fun and at times a little lacking in pacing. But, when it does catch fire it becomes a madcap comedy reminiscent of the Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart comedies of the forties. ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Harvey"" immediately comes to mind. It's definitely romantic - but not in the way one usually thinks of romantic films. You would never think of this film as low-budget. Not with the quality of writing, directing and acting. Love that Sally Kirkland! She's always perfect. The two male leads are perfectly cast and project a real caring for each other that goes beyond the usual sexual stereotypes. A believable connection between two human beings It really was wonderful to see this on the screen. I don't know how the director was able to snag the remaining cast as they also were absolutely perfect in their roles. SEE IT! See it for the fun of it. See it because it does not cop out and make fairy tale endings. And it does this with a very sensitive, realistic, and light comic touch. It can also make you feel a little wistful and sad but, at the same time, happy to see a dose of realism in what could have been a fairy tale ending.

I'll just give a few thoughts on what works about it and what doesn't.  It definitely has its sporadic charm in more than a few scenes.  The actors are quite good, possibly with the exception of Jonathan Silverman, who just wasn't all that credible as the homophobic brother turned full fledged homo.  Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Bray were perfectly cast as the gay and straight men caught in a relationship that's misunderstood by everyone around them - the chemistry between them is great!  Sally Kirkland is fantastic!  It's nice to see her again.  She's always had a penchant for playing slightly loopy, clueless characters and doesn't disappoint here.  The problem with the film it that halfway through it begins to feel like a broken record.  I felt as if I was seeing the same gag over and over again and it got a little tiring.

The premise is that Todd's brother, who is staying with him temporarily, posts a singles ad for Todd onto an online dating site. Todd gets a response, and is quite interested in meeting what he thinks to be a very nice woman. It turns out that the brother played a joke on Todd by posting the ad on a same-sex dating website, and the date (Kelly) is a man. Since one good joke deserves another, Todd and Kelly play a joke on the brother and lead him to believe that Todd is now gay and seeing Kelly. This explodes in Todds face as the brother then notifies the mom. Todd is outed to everyone, and is even outed at work, and can't convince anyone he's straight. Over time, he begins to question it himself.The problem is that Todd is not a very likable person. He starts out as very homophobic and is terrified about being mistaken for gay or being hit on by another man. Yet the homophobia seems to ebb and flow as the situation dictates. He seems stereotypically homophobic (portrayed very over the top) one moment, and the next is very comfortable pretending to be gay and holding another man's hand as he's trying to fool his brother. The rest of the movie is basically the same scene in different settings: Todd trying to convince people he's straight. Early in the movie, he states ""I know how dramatic you people are"", but is a pure drama queen himself throughout the movie. There's nothing in the writing, leaving nothing for the actor to work upon, that shows any reason why someone would be attracted to Todd. Yet people are attracted to him. I couldn't begin to understand why. While Kelly is quite the catch, Todd is one that should definitely be tossed back into the water.The writing is ambitious, but lacks the necessarily skill to pull off believable scenarios and performances, and the bare-bones direction and cinematography simply amplify that lack of writing skill.I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that there is one scene in the movie that is genuinely entertaining. When Todd and Kelly turn the tables on the brother and play the joke on him, it's executed very well and is extremely funny. Unfortunately, that moment stands alone.While it's not a terrible movie, I feel it does fall just short of being ""OK"".

1087457,A224BKBLXVA859,B000SQJ28C,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","The movie could have gone wrong in so many ways right from the start. They could have made Todd homophobic. They could have opted for him to fool his brother by also acting in a highly stereotypical manner. But they didn't go into a lot of these tropes and managed to keep things fair and realistic enough, which is a good thing.I have to admit, I kinda of laughed at how easily people accepted that Todd was gay. It was definitely a funny scenario to put out there since we all have those straight friends who do a lot of things that make us wonder. We totally know they're straight, but we continue to have our doubts. And Todd nicely captured this conundrum and how we watch his family, friends and work colleagues all get in on wanting to show how accepting they are of gay people was key.I don't know if we needed to take things to the level of Todd going through a bit of an identity crises in terms of his sexuality. Just because everyone believes you're gay doesn't mean you need to start to think about. And to go as far as considering having sex with another guy was really pushing it. That's when things sort of when into the realm of gay wish fulfillment in terms of exploring that particular scenario, but I suppose we should forgive them that little thing.Bray was a pretty interesting actor and I think he has a lot more potential for comedy should he push tings further. Cruz was quite the darling though and he really carried the movie more with his scenes. I didn't think I'd like him at first, but in the end I did. He needs more movies!On the whole, Coffee Date is pretty light entertainment fare and nothing to change the game as it were in terms of LGBT representation in movies.

This is a story which came out a prank by two brothers. Barry (Jonathan Silvers) places an Internet ad for his brother Todd (Jonathan Bray) on a gay website. When Todd goes to meet his date at a gay coffee shop he had no idea it was a man, Kelly (Wilson Cruz.) They both have a lot of things in common and a friendship develops. But everybody in Todd's world, including his co-workers, starts believing that he is gay. His mother (Sally Kirkland) arrives into town to see the news and tries to be the newly understanding mother of a gay son.Kelly and Todd finally have sex as an experiment but proves what Todd has been saying all along, he is not gay. The movie ends with a reversal where Barry claims that he is gay (his mother thinks that he is doing it to get attention.) Todd and Kelly remain friends and even discuss about having a family.This movie is in the same style of Eating Out, with a similar dumb scheme. Even though Coffee Date is a pleasant comedy, the idea of gay men even considering to convert straight guys is preposterous. It is not in the genes and it will never happen.

They are usually low budgeted, poorly written, horribly acted and filled with unnecessary sex scenes.  ""Coffee Date"", however, overcame all of the afflictions that usually plague these types of films.  What saves this film, besides an excellent script, is the fact that some of the actors here are seasoned actors and not just want-to-be models who lucked up on an acting role.  The lead character is played by Jonathan Bray, who has acting experience in both movies and TV.  His gay friend is played by Wilson Cruz, who I have seen in other gay-related films.  Not only is he great looking but he's also a darn-good actor, coming off as more believeable than many of his counterparts.  The mother is played by veteran actress Sally Kirkland, who's legacy speaks for itself.The story line is a simple one.  Bray's brother plays a joke on him by putting an ad in the Personals  but instead of putting the ad under Male Seeking Female, he puts the ad under Male Seeking Male.  The other male's name is Kelly so, of course, Bray's character doesn't realize Kelly is actually a man until they end up meeting for a coffee date.  Upon finding out they were both tricked, they find out they have several of the same interests (both are movie buffs)and they form an unexpected friendship. In ordert to get back at his brother, Bray takes Cruz home, walks past his brother, takes Cruz into his bedroom and proceeds to pretend like they are having sex. His brother, in turn, starts to believe the Brady is really gay and then calls their mother, Sally Kirkland, to break the news to her.  Sally then immediately flies in to try to accept and support Bray in his new ""lifestyle"".  Bray spends the rest of the movie denying to his mother and his friends and co-workers that, despite having a gay friend(s), he is not gay.  Bray starts to have doubts about his sexuality when he meets a woman at the bar, takes her home but is not able to perform in bed. The movie takes an unexpected twist when, in order to prove that he is not gay, Bray shares a very passionate kiss with Cruz and they end up having sex together. Bray is now convinced that he is not gay and actually ends up with Cruz's straight female roomate.This movie could have easily been a disaster but again was saved by great actors and a very well-written, funny script.  I found myself laughing out loud on several ocassions. I really didn't feel as if I were watching a ""gay film"" at all.

It was extremely well written and very funny, but with a definite but subtly delivered message.  The characters were engaging, attractive, and believeable.  The actors were uniformly fine without that self-conscious and amateurish ""I am acting"" behavior that marks so many gay indies.

This man was highly educated, as the main character in this film, andhe was constantly inundated with all sorts of comments for having gay friends.I enjoyed the funny dialog and that it also lacked in  un- needed profanities.Well, he was not gay, just single, loving, trusting, and he was my boss.
