1690761,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B00HNGZHDE,ajsteele,"[1, 2]","Did ""Robocop"" need a remake? Who knows. This current incarnation does however show that the concept of a cyborg enforcing the law has much less appeal than it's predecessor. Joel Kinnaman plays Alex Murphy, the beleaguered and mangled cop given a superpowered overhaul with mega blandness to the point where all humanity is continually missing. These dual natures of machine and man were sparse and gave us a machine man too hard to root for. The bad guys are typical carboard cutouts delivering below B movie utterences. The police station of the future is pretty low tech considering the high tech weaponry depicted that's thrown in your face from the onset. Speaking of that, the beginning of the film is a waste as it shows the Middle East under wraps with  America's Terminator style war machines for no other purpose but action, because otherwise there is no strong connectedness to the plot. These beginning scenes project a different film entirely. I suppose it's minor purpose is to say,"" policing robots exist"". Nothing exciting in the visual realm here in connection to the robots. It's also revealing that almost 15 years into the future cell phones haven't changed.Michael Keaton as the one man conglomerate pushing for the ultimate law robot is decent , but it's a tiring routine and whatever happens to him is predictable enough. The best part of this film is watching Gary Oldman as the doctor in charge of the Robocop monstrosity. It's too bad the film was missing others capable of solid acting. Many bit characters such as Oldman's female lab assistant and the ""marketing guy"" defined atrocious.Samuel Jackson hosting a Fox News ripoff TV show aimed at giving a feeling of realism was distractively boring. You have to be on target doing fake news shows in films.The original film had at the least sentimentality and pure brute force effectively mixed. ""Robocop"" (2 0 14) is unable to retread the interesting cyborg films that came before it. In addition,the action sequences are shockingly dull and the story limps along. You likely know what's coming next due to the premise of the film, and it's disappointing when what is played out in your mind fails to satisfy the way it should.",2,Robotic.,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,2204,"['Did', 'Robocop', 'need', 'remake', 'Who', 'current', 'incarnation', 'however', 'show', 'concept', 'cyborg', 'enforcing', 'law', 'much', 'less', 'appeal', 'predecessor', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'beleaguered', 'mangled', 'cop', 'given', 'superpowered', 'overhaul', 'mega', 'blandness', 'point', 'where', 'humanity', 'continually', 'missing', 'dual', 'natures', 'machine', 'man', 'were', 'sparse', 'gave', 'machine', 'man', 'too', 'hard', 'root', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'typical', 'carboard', 'cutouts', 'delivering', 'B', 'movie', 'utterences', 'police', 'station', 'future', 'pretty', 'low', 'tech', 'considering', 'high', 'tech', 'weaponry', 'depicted', 'thrown', 'face', 'onset', 'Speaking', 'beginning', 'film', 'waste', 'Middle', 'East', 'wraps', 'America', 'Terminator', 'style', 'war', 'machines', 'other', 'purpose', 'action', 'otherwise', 'strong', 'connectedness', 'plot', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'project', 'different', 'film', 'entirely', 'suppose', 'minor', 'purpose', 'say', 'policing', 'robots', 'exist', 'Nothing', 'exciting', 'visual', 'realm', 'here', 'connection', 'robots', 'also', 'revealing', 'almost', '15', 'years', 'future', 'cell', 'phones', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed.Michael', 'Keaton', 'one', 'man', 'conglomerate', 'pushing', 'ultimate', 'law', 'robot', 'decent', 'tiring', 'routine', 'happens', 'predictable', 'enough', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'watching', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'doctor', 'charge', 'Robocop', 'monstrosity', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'missing', 'others', 'capable', 'solid', 'acting', 'Many', 'bit', 'characters', 'such', 'Oldman', 'female', 'lab', 'assistant', 'marketing', 'guy', 'defined', 'Jackson', 'hosting', 'Fox', 'News', 'ripoff', 'TV', 'show', 'aimed', 'giving', 'feeling', 'realism', 'was', 'distractively', 'boring', 'have', 'be', 'target', 'doing', 'fake', 'news', 'shows', 'films.The', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'least', 'sentimentality', 'pure', 'brute', 'force', 'effectively', 'mixed', 'Robocop', '2', '0', '14', 'unable', 'retread', 'interesting', 'cyborg', 'films', 'came', 'addition', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'shockingly', 'dull', 'story', 'along', 'likely', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'due', 'premise', 'film', 'disappointing', 'when', 'what', 'played', 'out', 'mind', 'satisfy', 'way', 'should']",N/A

1690772,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00HNGZHDE,Argyle Ronin,"[7, 11]","The original Robocop (1987) is one film that begged for a remake using today's technology. Yes, it's still pretty fresh, but for fan's of the character (me), the rest of the original trilogy was a unanimous fail. A new director picked up the mediocre sequel and Peter Weller reprized his role. The 3rd was significantly downsized in budget, and featured a new director, lead, and PG-13 rating.Fast-forward to 2014. Jos&eacute; Padilha (Elite Squad) directs the first Robocop film to hit theaters in over 20 years. Joel Kinnaman plays our favorite cyborg cop, along with a star-studded cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Jackie Earle Haley. The first red flag came before it's actual release: the MPAA slapped this movie with a PG-13 rating. Paul Verhoeven, who directed the original, needed to work within the confines of a hard R rating in order to bring B-movie classics like Robocop, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers to the big screen. All three of these flicks are violent, satirical, and campy to the extreme. They were also known for their parody of the media (mainly the news), that added Verhoeven's signature humor.The new Robocop features some incredible Special FX, especially with the reconstructed version of Alex Murphy. The updated ""tactical"" black armor is a welcome change, and looks sleeker, lighter, and more agile than the original. This Robocop can run as fast as a cheetah and hop around like John Carter. He also gets to swap his restrictive squad car with a mean-looking crotch rocket. Robocop's helmet is built into his bodysuit, with a see-through visor that drops over his face whenever he's ready for action. A red uni-beam acts as his field of view. Not including spoilers, Joel Kinnaman's Robocop is also ""less"" of a man than Peter Weller.Unfortunately, the updated Special FX is where the remake's strong points end. There isn't nearly as much action as in the original. Much of the movie focuses on fine-tuning Robocop's technology and his inner-battle with those who attempted to murder him. Alex Murphy's wife and young son play a greater part as Robocop wakes up with all of his memories, emotions, and human intellect intact. The dumbed-down action (when it does come), pales in comparison to the original. People are shot, but there is no blood. There is no toxic waste to melt the bad guys' faces off. Robocop sustains minimal damage and we don't get to see him as a smashed, short-circuited torso.The satire is not here. There are no campy one-liners or iconic board room shoot-outs. The best that the remake delivers is a goofy-looking Samuel L. Jackson as a newscaster who fails at being ironic. Both Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton look bored, and drag their feet through scenes. Jackie Earle Haley is nothing special. The crime boss that orchestrated the attempt on Alex Murphy's life is so forgettable that him and his cronies slip my mind the day after watching this movie. They were that bland.In 1987, the main criminal element in all action movies was punks. Kids with giant fluorescent mo-hawks, leather motorcycle jackets covered with hardware, and finger-less gloves. Rioting, looting, and throwing Molotov cocktails wherever they felt like it. The first Robocop featured a world infested with these types, as did many other 80's movies: Escape From New York, Terminator, and Mad Max come to mind. The remake takes place in Detroit, circa 2028. Gone are the colorful villains of yesteryear. America has been overrun by the Joneses.Overall, Robocop is a decent flick. It's greatest value is the Special FX. The rest of the movie is a disappointment. Entertainment-wise, Robocop is about the same as last year's Total Recall remake. Solid three star flick.

1690775,AYD5PNH0ED0JW,B00HNGZHDE,"Art Chick ""Art Chick""","[0, 0]","This movie was just OK for me. I'd seen the original ages ago and didn't really remember much about that one except that I'd liked it. I liked this one too, but I couldn't really get into it much. I didn't connect with the characters much at all and when that happens I really can't enjoy a movie all that much--especially the wife character, as I thought she was rather robotic (LOL). It was rather slow for me as a result, and I was just glad I streamed it, rather than having paid movie theater prices for it. I do think the special effects were very good, and I like Gary Oldman so I was always a bit more into it when he was on screen--but he was underutilized in this film. It was also nice to see Michael Keaton, though I don't like it when he's the bad guy (in any film)--but he was good in this. And I entertained myself during slow spots by inserting Batman jokes into the script to make it more fun.In the end I'm not a Sci-Fi chick, so I really only watched this for the Hubs.

I grew up watching a taped recording on VHS and remember being terrified by the ED 209. Watching Robocop now, I find it to be somewhat cheesy but one of those films you'd still watch over and over again, especially if you saw it was coming on TV. When I learned they were doing an updated version, I was ecstatic. After the success of the Dredd reboot, I thought 'yes, another reboot that I will love to watch over and over again!'Special effects are at a level to be expected. In this time of technology, you expect cool explosions and action sequences. So it had that going for it. But as far as paying homage to the original? It fell so short that I actually felt aggression when I left the movie theaters. They took a good story and added so much unnecessary filler with very little 'easter eggs' to reference the original.It's a reboot and I understand that no one wants a redundant copy. However, there's a line where it becomes a totally different film with the premise of exceeding the original it's based on. If this had been an original concept with no 1987 Robocop to overshadow it, it would have stood fine on it's own. Still overly long, but a decent film.My review is probably not very eloquent and while I would like to name specific gripes, I'll bite my tongue so not to spoil it for anyone else. So if I could sum this up neatly, don't go see this movie with the hopes that it will live up to the original.

The cast in this film is decent, lots of big names and everyone does a great job, Gary Oldman is great as usually, you can basically put him in any film and I'll watch it.This reboot lacks much of what made the original movie so iconic, which is too bad. The original Robocop focused on the character Murphy, had great villains and too many memorable quotes to mention.  This remake could easily be forgotten about. It's not a bad movie, it's good, everything is really well done, special effects are decent, pacing is right, everything is shot well, all of the character's give good performances, it's just missing the &#34;spark&#34; of the original.What is the spark?  I wish I could say for sure, I'm going to speculate that it's the current trend in cinematography the framing of the shot. In 4:3 the focus was the characters. Now the name of the game has changed, the shots are framed for 16:9 or wider, farther away with more filler added to fill the extra space.  It's the new normal, makes for a great experience in a theater but doesn't translate well to dvd / streaming. So in the end you get another - &#34;meh&#34; - reboot.

For example, the fighting scene between Robocop and other giant robots in the last 20 minutes is terrific.

However, the shooting practice scene between Robocop and his colleagues look like a video game. I mean it looks absolutely fake.The acting is acceptable.

It stars Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Abbie Cornish, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael K. Williams, Jay Baruchel, & Samuel L. Jackson. Set in the near future of Detroit. Detective Alex Murphy gets critically injured & the corporation, OmniCorp turns him into a half man/half machine police officer as a opportunity in bringing robotic law enforcement in the U.S. As some of may know, I am a huge fan of the original Paul Verhoeven film. One of my all time favorites & for having a reboot coming out, I was very skeptical. My expectations were very low, especially after seeing the TOTAL RECALL remake. I've been dreading, but at the same time giving it the benefit of the doubt. When it comes a remakes, I usually give it a chance before judging. Now the real shocker, ROBOCOP is actually good, it was a lot better than excepted. Is it better than the original? No, of course not. To be frank, it's the best ROBOCOP in a long time. It's by no means perfect, it does have it's flaws here & there. This could have been easily a cookie cutter/paint by numbers cash-in. But there is actually thought & effort put here. It does bring something new to the table & not a rehash of the original. The satire is very well alive here as before. This is very much a origin story, a ROBOCOP for a new generation. I also don't mind the new suit for ROBO. The CGI is top notch. The acting is good here, especially Gary Oldman being the best performance. As for the flaws, well it's never groundbreaking here & can be bit slow at times. It does lack the charm & the edge of the original, so it plays out safe. Feels very clean & sanitize here. You can say the PG-13 hurts the film, but this was always been a PG-13 from the very beginning. The film does lack a great villain & having one of the main characters turning evil completely out of nowhere feels random. It like it's so focus on ROBOCOP's origin & establishing or utilizing the bad guys becomes an afterthought. Overall, ROBOCOP is not a failure as we all though it was going to be. It's not great, but it's a good sci-fi/action flick throughout. It's one of the better remakes lately. Much better than TOTAL RECALL & CARRIE. This is clearly made by people who understood & respected the original.

1690808,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00HNGZHDE,Chris Kennison,"[1, 2]","Paul Verhoeven may not have always been on top of his game (Showgirls), but he had something that many directors back then and now don't have and can never have; the ability to entertain with unabashed disregard for anything but entertainment (Flesh + Blood, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers & Robocop 1987). His disregard for everything Hollywood was his secret weapon. He knew exactly what audiences wanted; they wanted violence, sex and they wanted to be involved in the characters. He had no agenda up his sleeve and he never wasted a single second with a useless conversation, only good ones. The reboot Robo DOES have an agenda, wastes countless minutes with useless conversation and lecture, and took for granted the reason why the 80s Robo was a hit in the first place; it dripped with inappropriateness.The reboot of ""Robocop"", directed by Jose Padiha, has its qualities and it has its problems. The 1987 ""Robocop"" was missing two things in my opinion: technology and a connection between Alex Murphy aka Robocop and his wife and child. The reboot ""Robo"" brings both of those in spades, although absent is Verhoeven's fun. In place of the 80s no-holes barred delivery was an agenda that couldn't be made clearer than having Samuel L. Jackson angrily speaking it to you. In place of the original movies fun was an overabundance of politics and relentless talk about the business end of Robocop/Omnicorp. Exactly what people these days don't want to have in their movies.""Robo"" 2014 is similar to the ""Iron Man"" movies in my opinion and not because of the metal suit, but because what you get is a whole lot of talk and a few short scenes of Robo being Robo. When the action is going, it is well done. Robo is actually very cool and the upgrade in technology is commendable but upgrades in technology mean nothing if the story isn't engrossing. Take the original for example; the technology was weak. The Ed-209 robot was nearly laughable; yet we didn't care, the story had us.I was pleased to see them bring the heart and soul of Alex Murphy to light by integrating his wife and child into the storyline, but this was almost overdone as well.

Growing up I loved its gritty R-rated violence and crude humor. I saw it so many times I lost count. With that in mind I went into this movie skeptical as I am with many remakes. And I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. Now one thing I had to do while watching this movie was to keep telling myself to forget the original. There were times I was comparing what I was seeing onscreen to the original and I was disappointed. Because the original is such a masterpiece this remake Does not stand up to it. But when I could disconnect and make myself not do that comparison this was an okay movie.The one thing I had a real problem with in comparison to the original is the way RoboCop talks. The mechanical/robotic talking of the original in my opinion gave RoboCop the Robo feel. This one still gives you the just the man in a suit feeling and not that is a true cyborg.So if you're a fan of the original as you watch it try not to compare them and you'll see that there's a decent sci-fi movie. I miss the R-rated version and a no Hollywood doesn't cash in his big on R-rated movies because the kids can go see them. But the R rating is what helped make the original Robocop that much more exceptional.Thanks for reading dead or alive you're coming with me.PS the setting of the original in old Detroit is just so much better than this modern day type of Detroit that we get in this version.,3,A fun action flick...

Holmes,"[2, 3]","In the end, after at least a year of online rage and suspicion borne of nostalgia for the 1980s, this big-budget update of RoboCop, the part-man-part-machine law-enforcement cult favorite, proves to be a damn fine film by any measure:  exciting, smart, shot with energetic style, and acted to perfection by an admirable ensemble cast, even if a few of its members are a shade underutilized.  Rather than abandon the satiric political and social observations which turned the original into a frequent topic of academic conversation, this film wisely ushers them into a new, more grim era in which the clout wielded by private corporations and the role of technology in warfare are even more pertinent.  Never does it become a rote action picture.  Instead, the chase-and-gunfire spectacle is always shaded with, inspired by, or leading to questions of identity and morality.There are imperfections, of course:  parts of the script require more development and focus (including a storyline involving compromised policemen and their dangerous connection to an arms dealer), and the squandering of the always riveting Michael K. Williams (in the role of the partner analogous to, but nowhere near as prominent as the one previously played by Nancy Allen) is criminal.  Still, though, this registers as a major surprise.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","In my youth, a new ROBOCOP movie is exactly the kind of release I would rush to on the first night it was available to the public-at-large.  I just knew it had the kind of big-budget goodness that was best preserved in my memory by viewing it with a crowd: big laughs always mean more when shared with an audience; exciting, frenetic action sequences usually draw collective astonishment from the crowd; and who doesn&#8217;t love applauding the hero when others are present and listening?  Now that I&#8217;m a bit older (if not a bit more jaded or cynical), I tend to take a week or two before watching such theatrical releases, and I try to get to a showing that&#8217;s fairly light on people.  Why?  I&#8217;d rather not risk any undue influence in order to serve up what I feel is a much more honest and more clinical valuation of the film, definitely one not inspired by what the yuckster sitting next to me thought.I guess I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; old, fans.  But if I can age as nicely as the ROBOCOP franchise can, then I&#8217;m in good company.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)In the city of Detroit circa 2028 (seriously?  Detroit is still around after its financial collapse?), police detective Alex Murphy (played with conviction by Joel Kinnaman) uncovers a criminal conspiracy that looks to implicate some high-ranking officers on his squad.  At the same time, the multinational, war-mongering conglomerate OmniCorp is seeking the right candidate to put inside one of their latest creations &#8211; an urban combat suit &#8211; in order to expand their domestic sales and corner the market on profits.  When those in Detroit decide Murphy needs to go, billionaire businessman Raymond Sellars (a greedy Michael Keaton) seizes the opportunity to put a part-man, part-robot police officer on the streets.  But what happens when the former cop turned machine decides to investigate his own attempted murder?Where the original ROBOCOP (1987) was smart, smart, and smart, this new version is dumb, dumb, anddumb.  It comes compliments of director Jose Padilha, relatively still fresh from acclaim rightful earned from his ELITE SQUAD 2: THE ENEMY WITHIN (which, incidentally, is a vastly better film than this is).  1987&#8217;s script &#8211; penned by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner &#8211; was crafted almost with a winking acknowledgement to the audience: don&#8217;t take any of this any more seriously as you need to, and you&#8217;re likely to have great fun with it.  The violence was gory and (I&#8217;ll admit it) gloriously gratuitous because that kind of visual flair lent itself nicely to their intended message.  Structurally, it had similarities to the great American Western &#8211; a lone gunman seeks to clean up a corrupt town &#8211; though there were some obvious swipes at capitalism, the ultimate &#8216;bad guy&#8217; in anything churned out by Hollyweird in the past half century.While still being vastly superior to the ROBOCOP sequels that followed in the footsteps of the original, this 2014 reboot suffers largely from the singular distinction of being completely unnecessary.  It echoes back most of the major points of the original &#8211; OmniCorp&#8217;s suits are still the villains, though with vastly bloated emphasis on corporate villainy, while Murphy&#8217;s family (Abbie Cornish as Clara Murphy, along with young John Paul Ruttan as son David) get real screen time in order to ground the film in stronger &#8216;humanity.&#8217;  However, gone is that constantly winking eye; in its place is some forced histrionics dished out by everyone&#8217;s favorite foul-mouthed screamer Samuel Jackson as some futuristic Fox News wannabe talking head who rarely makes logical arguments.  (He does get a great laugh, though, by casting the U.S. Senate as &#8220;pro-crime.&#8221;)  I&#8217;m guessing filmmakers thought they were aping Bill O&#8217;Reilly, but Jackson comes off more like watered down and occasionally cocaine-fueled Stephen Colbert.Also, the first ROBOCOP distinguished itself with clever moments of newsroom satire, peppering the screen with visually exciting news stories and interviews that helped lampoon the crime-ridden world of tomorrow.  Unfortunately, scripter Joshua Zetumer&#8217;s story never quite figured out how to contemporize that aspect; instead, Zetumer begins throwing things at the wall hoping something might strike the same cord with audiences.  At one point, he even crafts a narrator describing the action taking place on the screen (a device that goes on for far too long and desperately needed a better sound mix than the one provided if producers wanted it to be understood); instead of complementing the film, it ends up creating probably one of the most alarming &#8216;WTF?&#8217; moments in recent film memory.The new ROBOCOP isn&#8217;t a failure.  Rather, I see it as a reboot missing more than a few upgrades.RECOMMENDED.  Like most critics, I suspect the overwhelming question &#8211; &#8220;Was ROBOCOP really in need of such a flavorless reboot?&#8221; &#8211; truly kept me from enjoying this version as a legitimate sci-fi offering when director Jose Padilha served up only a competent, CGI-laden action film, one largely intended for our video-game-friendly culture.  Performances work only so far as they&#8217;re needed for a video game (doting wife, loyal partner, crooked cop, corporate sleaze, etc.), and the real weakness here was a deeply flawed script that could&#8217;ve quite figure out what it wanted to be when it grew up.",3,ROBOCOP Reboot Missing A Few Upgrades,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,5910,"['youth', 'new', 'ROBOCOP', 'movie', 'exactly',

1690847,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00HNGZHDE,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[0, 0]","The original ""Robocop,"" made by Paul Verhoeven back in 1987, was a product of its era. This was a period that I wasn't alive during, but from my understanding, was filled to the brim with violent action films that oozed testosterone and viscera in equal amounts. While some of these films have aged quite well, such as ""Commando"" and ""Die Hard,"" many of them were exercises in mind-numbing repetition. But ""Robocop"" was the antithesis to this. It worked on several different levels. As a satire, it laid bare the societal fascination with hyper-violent entertainment. As an analogy, it told a biblical tale as filtered through a cynical, post-modern lens. And as a sci-fi action movie, it managed to excited and thrill with memorable sequences and set pieces galore. At the time of its release, the world needed it. It felt urgent.Which is partially why this update feels so passe. The new ""Robocop"" is a film that can't decide what it wants to be, and frantically tries on far too many hats for its own good. One moment, the audience is given a rollicking action sequence with a pumping soundtrack, and the next, a futuristic news program hosted by Samuel L. Jackson as a far-right political pundit. This is not a film that is ""one part X, one part Y""; instead, it is a film that wants to be ""parts A-Z,"" but lacks the writing and directing chops to pull it off. The result? A film that is a frantic mixture of various things that, ultimately, feels superfluous and unnecessary in today's cinematic landscape.Why, for example, do we really need a sob story about the lukewarm protagonist and his family? The original film left the titular robotic do-gooder, Alex Murphy, abandoned by his wife and son, the memories of his past life a cruel facade that gave him drive but could never be recreated. But here, we have an underdeveloped family who are supposed to act as the catalysts to him finding his humanity again, after an explosive attack on him leaves with only a head, a hand, and a robotic body. While this could be an okay plot device in a better movie, handled by capable writers, the fact remains that it is botched here. Watching these scenes that were so obviously attempting to be ""emotional,"" I wished that the film would stop its cloying attempts to tug at the heartstrings and get back to the central conflict of the movie.Which is when I remembered that there is no central conflict, yet another reason why this is a far inferior film to its predecessor. In the original, we had the menacing Clarence Boddicker, a psychotic mobster who shot up the protagonist for fun, blowing him apart limb by limb until barely anything resembling a corpse remained. To top that off, we had an entire gang of equally depraved individuals who engaged Robocop in an array of dazzling and violent action sequences. Here? We have a bloated cast of cliches parroted about like they're important or interesting. They're far from it. The bland criminal who killed Alex is barely there, and only gets brought up again in the ancillary revenge plot. There's a robot specialist cum weapons expert who also wants Alex off the streets because... he hates the idea of androids or something. And last but not least, there's Michael Keaton as the head of OmniCorp, whose character fluctuates wildly between ""rogue,"" ""greedy suit"" and ""sociopathic murderer,"" with no sense of development or rational progression of actions. There are also several sub-plots that come and go, which left me wondering which one I was supposed to really be caring about. The answer? Not many of them.It's become a common sentiment, I feel, to lash out at critics who compare the old film and the new one. I call shenanigans with that sentiment, because ""Robocop"" so desperately tries to ape the original while adding completely jarring and unnecessary flourishes that do nothing but fill the story with bloated nonsense. There are little nods and references that feel wholly out of place here, and quite honestly, undermine what could have been a good film. And make no mistake, there are flashes of compelling stuff here. Gary Oldman's tortured scientist character, in particular, is fascinating. His struggle between his humanity and his desire for technological innovation is surprisingly interesting, and provides a compelling anchor to some of the more stupid bits. On top of that, the film raises some very stimulating questions about US foreign policy, and the morality of drone warfare, not to mention the caustic nature of American imperialism and unfettered patriotism. Indeed, when this movie isn't trying to focus on sappy family bits, phoned-in action, or a perfunctory revenge plot, it actually starts to work and become compelling science fiction.That, coupled with some strong performances from Oldman, Jackson, Keaton and (shockingly) Jay Baruchel, prevent ""Robocop"" from becoming a truly bad movie. But while that may be the case, there's no denying that it's a mediocre one which lacks direction or a compelling central conflict. If you come in expecting a cohesive plot and exciting action, well, you're going to be disappointed. But if you can overlook these faults and take away some of the interesting things the writers are trying to accomplish, you may be pleasantly surprised by the genuinely engaging politics in this movie.""Robocop"" lacks the bite of the original, yes, but it's an entertaining little morsel that will make you think about some cool stuff, if only for five minutes or so. With some more polish, it could have been something special, but as it stands, it's simply worth a rent and a casual viewing. Nothing more, nothing less.Grade: C+",3,Technical Difficulties,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,5645,"['original', 'Robocop', 'made', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'back', '1987', 'was', 'product', 'era', 'was',

But, being a big fan of the original, was enough to urge me on to the local cinema to see it. It was a mixed bag.Here's the scoop. Omnicorpe wants to put robotic security on American streets but a politically driven law precludes it. They figure to skirt said law by putting a robotically enhanced human in the position. Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) fits the bill when he's nearly killed in an explosion. He gets enhanced and is set loose on the streets but all is not rosy.I watch the original every now and again and it's still a nifty ride. It's a seminal storyline that is well realized and produced. The story is clean and efficient. It all makes sense in its context. In this version they try too hard to plumb greater depths in the philosophy of what constitutes being a man. It slows things down. And there isn't a clear path from the case that lead to the explosion and Murphy's near demise to his tracking down the perps. This was all very well integrated in the original. And here, even with the more generous budget, the action scenes aren't as well realized. The big shootout in the finale just isn't that good.On the up side are some of the performances. Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman are outstanding. Abbie Cornish and Jackie Earl Haley also do standup jobs. The rest, Even Jay Baruchel, step up to the plate. I like Joel Kinnaman but he struggles in the scenes where he's confined to the suit. He needs more room to move in his own body.This is an Okay movie. It's good popcorn fare. It won't change your life and it isn't quite as good as the 4 stars I gave it, but it's worth seeing if only to match it up to the original.",4,Sometimes Less is More,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1726,"['Advanced', 'reviews', 'pretty', 'much', 'off', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'was', 'enough', 'urge', 'local', 'cinema', 'see', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag.Here', 'scoop', 'put', 'robotic', 'security', 'American', 'streets', 'politically', 'driven', 'law', 'figure', 'skirt', 'said', 'law', 'putting', 'robotically', 'enhanced', 'human', 'position', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'bill', 'when', 'nearly', 'killed', 'explosion', 'enhanced', 'set', 'loose', 'streets', 'not', 'rosy.I', 'watch', 'original', 'now', 'again', 'still', 'nifty', 'ride', 'seminal', 'storyline', 'well', 'realized', 'produced', 'story', 'clean', 'efficient', 'sense', 'context', 'version', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'plumb', 'greater', 'depths', 'philosophy', 'what', 'being', 'man', 'things', 'down', ""n't"", 'clear', 'path', 'case', 'lead', 'explosion', 'Murphy', 'near', 'demise', 'tracking', 'down', 'perps', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'integrated', 'original', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'generous', 'budget', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'realized', 'big', 'shootout', 'finale', 'just', ""n't"", 'good.On', 'up', 'side', 'are', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'also', 'do', 'standup', 'jobs', 'rest', 'Even', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'like', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'scenes', 'where', 'confined', 'suit', 'more', 'room', 'move', 'own', 'body.This', 'Okay', 'movie', 'good', 'popcorn', 'fare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'life', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', '4', 'stars', 'gave', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'match', 'up', 'original']",N/A

1690858,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HNGZHDE,FNDNreview,"[9, 16]","In the summer of 1987, audiences got their first look at the futuristic, cybernetic police officer &#8211; Robocop.  The premise of the story was simple:  the lives of police offices are too precious to lose and the time had come for robots to take their place &#8211; led by a half man/ half machine creation.  The idea went over well with audiences and the original Robocop went on to gross $53.4 million (that was quite a bit in the 80s).  Naturally, with the success of the original film, sequels followed &#8211; all of which can easily be considered massive failures.  The franchise would then turn to the small screen during the mid-1990s (and again in 2001) for revitalization &#8211; but with little success.  Now, 13 years since the last time we saw the character, Robocop has been re-imagined and rebooted for the big screen in the plainly titled, Robocop.Jos&eacute; Padilha makes his major directorial debut with the reboot of Robocop, starring Joel Kinnaman as Detroit police detective Alex Murphy/Robocop.  Murphy, working with his partner, Jack Lewis (Michael K. Williams), is able to make a connection between a local crime boss and dirty cops.  However, he has no proof to fully make his case &#8211; prompting the crime organization to put a &#8220;hit&#8221; on Murphy, using a strategically placed car bomb.The year is 2028 and overseas, the world is a very different place &#8211; policed by a series of military robots, also created by OmniCorp.  However, the United States is far more skeptical about having their streets policed by robots and the use of cyborgs has been deemed illegal by lawmakers.  OmniCorp CEO, Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), aims to change public opinion, and in order to do so he believes putting a man in a machine is the best way to go about it.  And, it just so happens Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) is capable of doing such a thing.While the attempt on Alex Murphy&#8217;s life is successful, he is still alive and his critically damaged body makes him the perfect candidate for Sellars&#8217; new program.  Once awake and fully embedded in a state-of-the-art mechanically enhanced suit, Alex Murphy is no longer the man his wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish) remembers.  Murphy has the memories of his past, but he&#8217;s more machine than man.  As he hits the streets with the intent to rid Detroit of crime, he finds his emotions are getting the best of him &#8211; prompting OmniCorp to rethink its use of the machine known as Robocop.Peter Weller, the original Robocop, was a relatively unknown actor &#8211; so the fact that the reboot follows that path is satisfying.  Joel Kinnaman, whom Swedish moviegoers will likely recognize, is basically an unknown face in the United States (having briefly starred in AMC&#8217;s recently canceled drama, The Killing).  In any event, Kinnaman is surprisingly enjoyable as Robocop &#8211; giving a splendid performance.  It certainly couldn&#8217;t have been fun having to be cooped-up in that clunky-looking tin can, but he pulls it off with sheer on-screen ease &#8211; and even resembles Peter Weller to a degree.The supporting cast is full of familiar faces, starting with Gary Oldman &#8211; whom you can never go wrong with regardless of the role.  Michael Keaton is just as eccentric as ever, taking on a role similar to Ronny Cox in the original.  Samuel L. Jackson plays an over-the-top talk show host that (if he were real) would be in primetime on Fox News.  And, Abbie Cornish plays Murphy&#8217;s wife, who basically takes over the main female presence of Nancy Allen (who played Anna Lewis, Murphy&#8217;s partner, in the original).  Speaking of Murphy&#8217;s partner, the reboot severely reduces the meaningfulness of Lewis, turning her into a he &#8211; portrayed by Michael K. Williams (who would have been an excellent henchman in this flick, although Jackie Earle Haley did a fine job).The name of this film and main character are the same is the original, but there&#8217;s very little else that connects one to the other.  For starters, the new Robocop storyline seems to almost progress in the exact opposite manner of the original.  In the original, Alex Murphy is gunned down in horrific, extremely violent fashion, only to reappear as Robocop without emotion, memories, and with little urge to reconnect with his family.  In the reboot, Alex wakes up essentially as himself &#8211; only minus nearly his entire body.  Instantly, he dreams and yearns to see his wife and son.  With that being said, the emotions run extremely deep and overpower the plot.  The reboot has him dealing with his feelings so much that he would be better off in couple&#8217;s therapy than crime fighting.  In essence, this new Robocop is a sissy &#8211; even in black.Even though the new Robocop reboot should be able to stand on its own merit, the original was such an outstanding film for its time that it&#8217;s nearly impossible not to make comparisons.  The original was so violent at one point that it couldn&#8217;t even secure an R-rating (although it eventually did), so for this new version to be PG-13 is a big, big mistake.  Sure, more people might see this film with the family-friendly PG-13 rating, but the story is about crime and punishment (not to mention more political, corporate issues that we have time to discuss).Overall, Robocop is obviously an attempt to update the character with an edgier, more futurist look &#8211; at least in comparison to the original counterpart.  Unfortunately, even though the cast is far better than anyone could have hoped, this reboot took a simple story and managed to over think it.  There isn&#8217;t enough action, far too many emotional lapses on the part of the main character, and the plot is constantly progressing without a clear goal in mind.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the original film, you will see some familiarities, but for the most part, you can put this film in the same club as Man of Steel &#8211; which misused its main character.  This reboot couldn&#8217;t even use the main theme song in the proper context &#8211; it just throws it in any ol&#8217; spot.  If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Robocop, you are more likely to appreciate this film, but if you grew up with the original as I did, you&#8217;re better off popping the 1987 version in your DVD player and saving yourself some major disappointment.GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,For the 'Robocop' remake - black doesn't equal better.,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,6408,"['summer', '1987', 'audiences',

I first saw Robocop 1 and 2 when I was 9, and thought both were amazing. This new Robocop was more up-to-date with special effects, and made good use of it. If you saw the two old Robocop movies, you'll agree with me that this new one tries to mesh them together. What you get is a rushed movie, underdeveloped, and hard to justify if the story made sense. I won't go into to details because it will spool the movie. They went into good detail when Robocop was trying to deal with being Robocop, the human vs. machine dilemma. Then the other part of the movie was taken from the older Robocop, drugs, corrupt cops, corrupt corporation, corrupt city were all jammed and quickly played out in this new Robocop movie. Anyways, if you like the old Robocop, you will check this one out anyways, but buying it for ownership.. NO NO NO! Speaking of a rushed movie, the new blacksuit, ahh, just looks black. There are actually 3 suit designs, the small gray suit that was first shown, non-battle mode I assume. The combat mode suit, which looks like the old classic Robocop suit; it was only shown once and never really used again in combat. The tactical suit or the fully black suit, which is just a completely black spray painted version of the first suit. The black suit was used throughout the whole movie! I didn't think much effort was put into designing the new Robocop suit, that's my take on it. In my opinion, I thought Robocop 2 was the best one.

At nearly two hours long this should have had a lot more action in it and been cut by about 25 minutes. Instead it's nearly all build-up and origin. There's no real villain in it. What action there is is very tame, thus the PG-13 rating. This should have been an R-rated movie! Samuel L. Jackson was chosen for the wrong role in this film. Instead of being the newsman he should have been the main bad guy. Also, I still can't get my head around the armor being black, but they may be because I grew up watching the original Robocop movies. This remake is a pale imitation of those originals. The acting was surprisingly good, especially from the guy that played Robocop. I don't think I had ever seen him in anything prior to this before.If they are going to do a sequel they need to up the violence and action and have a better overall story with a REAL villain. The potential is there but this remake just didn't fire on all the right cylinders for me. I like that they used a motorcycle instead for just using a police car. I know this an origin story since it is a remake, but they spent way too much time on build-up of the Robocop character. It's not a terrible movie, but I say if you're pining for a Robocop movie that brings back fond memories of the ones from the 1980's, then you should skip this one and wait for a sequel that is hopefully done correctly.

1690883,A294HSVTOCR5L4,B00HNGZHDE,Jeffrey C. Meade,"[0, 0]","Robocop 2014 is another example of a re-make that should never have been re-made. These days there is a fascination with trying to re-do every popular movie from the past when in most cases those movies should just be left alone, and Robocop is a good example of why.In all fairness, the new Robocop has a different enough story to be its own, but falls flat in too many ways. I did enjoy seeing more of a focus on Alex Murphy's family, which was an afterthought in the original, and I liked Gary Oldmans moral dilemma as the doctor that created Robocop. Unfortunately just about every other aspect of this version does not live up to the original.I was just a kid when the old Robocop came out in 1987. I still remember the feeling of horror watching Alex Murphy get s*** up in the scene that causes him to become Robocop. The movie set the story in a believable way. Detroit, a city falling apart with a horrible crime problem and not enough finances to have a police force capable of stopping the bad guys (though who knew back then that nearly 20 years later Detroit would be almost like the movie!)The new Robocop is not a bad movie. It just doesnt quite do what it needs to, especially in comparison with the original. The premise, or setting, of the modern film is believable, but doesn't give the same feeling of the originals dystopian Detroit therefore the viewer does not care as much about what is going on.In the original Alex Murphy had a female partner with a larger role in the movie. In this one the partner is an afterthought. Part of the problem may be the casting choice of Joel Kinnaman. He did ok, but Gary Oldman as the doctor stole the show and that's really not how it should have been. OCP was also not the big bad guys like in the original movie. You learned to hate them and their CEO Dick Jones, played by Ronny Cox, while in this version I didn't care at all about Michael Keaton. He wasn't evil so much as ambitious and greedy.Ultimately the theme that keeps running through my head after watching this movie is I just didn't care. The premise, story, and in some cases the cast itself, made it so that it is difficult to have any emotional connection to the movie as the viewer. The story as it was set up in the re-make felt rushed and just left something to be desired. It also needed more action. I liked seeing Robocop take on crime in the original. For the most part that was non-existent in this movie, or at best talked about, but you never see it in action.The original Robocop had its own issues at times, but the new re-make just does not do it justice. Its a movie worth renting when you are bored and want to watch something that you will mostly forget about once its over. Having this movie use a different story, while commendable for not being a carbon copy of the original, is also its downfall because the story and the setting are this movies weakest points.Those that have never seen the original movie will probably like this one more, but many of us that were around when the original came out will not be satisfied by this new version.",3,Robocop Review,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3089,"['Robocop', '2014', 'example', 're-make', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 're-made', 'days', 'fascination', 'trying', 're-do', 'popular', 'movie', 'past', 'when', 'most', 'cases', 'movies', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Robocop', 'good', 'example', 'why.In', 'fairness', 'new', 'Robocop', 'different', 'enough', 'story', 'be', 'own', 'flat', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'more', 'focus', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'family', 'was', 'afterthought', 'original', 'liked', 'Gary', 'Oldmans', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'doctor', 'created', 'Robocop', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'other', 'aspect', 'version', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'original.I', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'when', 'old', 'Robocop', 'came', 'out', '1987', 'still', 'remember', 'feeling', 'horror', 'watching', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'get', 's***', 'up', 'scene', 'become', 'Robocop', 'movie', 'set', 'story', 'believable', 'way', 'Detroit', 'city', 'falling', 'apart', 'horrible', 'crime', 'problem', 'not', 'enough', 'finances', 'have', 'police', 'force', 'capable', 'stopping', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'knew', 'back', 'then', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'Detroit', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'movie', 'new', 'Robocop', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'doesnt', 'quite', 'do', 'what', 'especially', 'comparison', 'original', 'premise', 'setting', 'modern', 'film', 'believable', ""n't"", 'give', 'same', 'feeling', 'originals', 'dystopian', 'Detroit', 'therefore', 'viewer', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'original', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'had', 'female', 'partner', 'larger', 'role', 'movie', 'one', 'partner', 'afterthought', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'casting', 'choice', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'did', 'ok', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'doctor', 'stole', 'show', 'really', 'not', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'OCP', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'big', 'bad', 'guys', 'original', 'movie', 'learned', 'hate', 'CEO', 'Dick', 'Jones', 'played', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', ""n't"", 'evil', 'so', 'much', 'ambitious', 'greedy.Ultimately', 'theme', 'running', 'head', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'premise', 'story', 'cases', 'cast', 'made', 'difficult', 'have', 'emotional', 'connection', 'movie', 'viewer', 'story', 'was', 'set', 'up', 're-make', 'felt', 'rushed', 'just', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'also', 'needed', 'more', 'action', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Robocop', 'take', 'crime', 'original', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'non-existent', 'movie', 'best', 'talked', 'never', 'see', 'action.The', 'original', 'Robocop', 'had', 'own', 'issues', 'times', 'new', 're-make', 'just', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting', 'when', 'are', 'bored', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'will', 'mostly', 'forget', 'about', 'once', 'over', 'Having', 'movie', 'use', 'different', 'story', 'commendable', 'not', 'being', 'carbon', 'copy', 'original', 'also', 'downfall', 'story', 'setting', 'are', 'movies', 'weakest', 'points.Those', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'many', 'were', 'around', 'when', 'original', 'came', 'out', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'satisfied', 'new', 'version']",N/A

For every success like &#34;Carrie&#34; there are more than a few &#34;Red Dawns&#34;.This re-imagining of the 80s classic Robocop falls into the latter category.While the original was over-the-top and highly satirical. This version is melancholic, dull, and takes itself WAY too seriously.I went into it fully aware that there would be unavoidable comparisons, as with all remakes. However, I did expect to be entertained at least. This drab and pathos ridden snoozefest provided nothing of the kind. The Murphy character was somewhat unlikable from the moment he's introduced. Even before he's thrust into the suit, he's cold and poker faced. The early moments with his wife and son are joyless and, by the time the inevitable explosion occurs, I had no empathy whatsoever for this character. Kinneman's Murphy is the sterotypical &#34;renegade cop&#34; who plays by his own rules, and is angry when taken to task for doing so. He's like Dirty Harry without the charisma and appeal.There is far too much exposition here. Despite some interesting CGI Robocop moments, the pacing is sluggish and takes WAY too long to get anywhere. By the time it does get anywhere...you're too bored to care.We live in an age that lends itself to LOADS of satire and humor. Technology, politics, media, corporate domination...all could have been ripped apart with a tongue firmly planted in cheek. Unfortunately, while the film touches subtly on those subjects, several opportunities are either missed or ignored all together. The end result leaves little laughs to be had. It's a film about a cyborg cop, ladies and gentlemen. As Heath Ledger's Joker famously says...&#34;Why so serious???&#34;.If I came out of this with anything positive to say, it would have to be with regards to Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman. Then again...who doesn't like those guys anyhow???All in all, as dated and as &#34;of its time&#34; as the 1987 original is, Veerhoven's Robocop is still socially relevant on many levels.

1690896,AJZ3AUIUF71O7,B00HNGZHDE,Johnny O,"[1, 2]","I will start off by saying that the idea of a Robocop remake didn't sound too appealing when I first heard that this movie was in production. Then I started to see the trailers and my excitement started to build. When my brother and I watched this movie in the theater we were impressed. I would say I was excited going into the movie but not expecting a whole lot and I walked away anxious to share this movie with people I know. I have watched it twice since buying it, both times with small groups and received agreement that the movie was well done. Here are some specifics.I recognize that there is really no way to please certain hard-core fans of the original except not to make this movie at all... seeing as it has been created, I will not try to appeal to those individuals as I know that it would be fruitless. For the rest of us...This retelling of Robocop's story is really a new creature in and of itself. At just under 2 hours, the story does not drag on but feels like it concludes efficiently. This is how Robocop operates, For the sake of avoiding spoilers I'll just say that, once Murphy really starts to take control, he doesn't waste time in getting to his man. On that note, I can understand why some felt that there was no real antagonist in the film. Though I disagree with some, that this makes the film inadequate, I do recognize how important it can be to a film (what would the Dark Knight be without the Joker?).There are a few slower moments in the movie but these are by design. There is a much greater effort in this film to depict the emotional and psychological journey that Murphy goes through in becoming Robocop. I really felt for Murphy when his wife told him &#34;we'll make it like it was&#34; just a scene after we watch Murphy's horror when his suit is opened up to show what little there is left of his body- he knew that was impossible and he ends the conversation abruptly when he can't take it anymore. One nice touch is that they kept one of his hands so that he could make some genuine physical contact with his family aside from just his face.Gary Oldman is spot on in portraying the well-intended scientist who slowly starts to crumble under increasing pressures from Keaton's character (the CEO of Omnicorp) to blur the lines of ethics and legality in order to deliver a polished product to the public. There is a lot to think about in this film as there are clashing ideals all over the place. Ethics, politics, foreign policy, corruption, humanity and the cold-hard efficiency of machines all play a part.I will agree that the soundtrack could have been better as it does nothing special aside from the nod to the original Robocop's theme. The filming seemed to be well-done with nothing glaring to say for or against it. The real strengths of this movie lie in the depth of the story, the human element throughout, and the superb acting on behalf of a well-chosen cast.

Paul ""John doe""","[6, 30]","1st things 1st if you leave a comment telling me why you think this movie is great be respectful about it if leave some little rude comment then I will respond in kind but not kindly. So IF YOU LOVE THIS MOVIE BE MY GUEST! WHENEVER I HATE ON A MOVIE IT'S NOT AGAINST ANY FANS OF SAID MOVIE WE ALL HAVE OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. 2nd don't tell me that I didn't like it cause it was different cause while I am not the biggest fan of Robocop 3 I like The Gun Arm & Jet Pack that's different. I love Batman 89 but I also enjoy The Dark Knight & those are 2 totally different ideas of Gotham, Batman & The Joker. This Robocop movie even as it's own movie The Robocop remake is still bad as it's own movie I'd give it a 3 out of 10. I don't hate cause it's PG 13 cause I like The Rundown that's PG 13, Taken was PG 13 Skyline a movie that is hated I liked & it was PG 13 every James Bond movie from Licence To Kill to now is PG 13. Black Dog with Patrick Swayze was PG 13. I will admit you can tell a stronger story with an R rating like the 1st Robocop had it had an R rating which helped it tell a more impactful story.Story time for years MGM wanted to a Robocop remake then MGM got into bankruptcy then they were bought out. Time goes by The Robocop remake is still on they hire some director named Jose Padilla who I have never heard of I hear all his fans put over Elite Squad I don't care about The Spirit Squad I care about if you have made movies in The US & if you have drawn money he shouldn't be directing a big name movie like Robocop. Then I find out 2 years ago they have casted Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman as Robocop who looks like some hipster trendy douche bag pos is going to be Robocop he said in an interview how he is a fan of the original Robocop he said I saw it 15 or 20 times well buddy I guarantee you that I have saw more. Cause ever since I saw Robocop 2 when I was 8 I was a fan & yeah I know it's a movie I shouldn't have been watching at that age. I finally saw the original around the 10th anniversary & was blown away with it. I reviewed Robocop 1 , 2 & 3 & The Prime Directives on my newer account back in 2012 you can go read them if you want. Anyway this Kinnaman guy says ""The new 1 will not be jaw action. The visor will be see through. There's not going to be any twitchy robot in out version it's going to be about a robot in 2046."" What's wrong with the original design of Robocop. He said ""Walking around & moving your jaw it's not so interesting. So this is going to be an opportunity to bring a full performance."" The screen play was leaked it pretty much disrespected the original also hey Full Performance Boy PETER WELLER ALREADY GAVE IT A FULL PERFORMANCE! Then when the pictures were released my reaction was like Hob's in Robocop 2 when Robocop 2 came into the drug lab to kill everybody in there & Hob said ""What the h  e  l  l is that!"" Thatw was my reaction to this costume that looked like someone stole a prototype costume from a Christopher Nolan Batman movie & ripped off the costume from Judge Dredd. Joel Kinnaman reminds me of Troy Dyer from Reality Bites a great movie I just saw I do plan on reviewing for my 20 years ago series. Anyway he reminds me of that character who has a comment for everybody thinks he's better than everyone else but he's not perfect either he's a douche bag & needs to get his life in order. My reaction to the trailer was""Holy C  h  r  is  t HolyC  h  r  is  t this movie is going to be bad!"" But fanboys & fangirls of Joel Kinnaman tell me oh he's in The Killing I don't give a s  **  t about The Killing & nor does most of the public cause it was canceled twice & is going to finish up on Netflix. That shows how valuable Mr Full Performance is. You know what he said oh I am a fan of the original & he says that all the original movie was jaw action twitchy robot movement he doesn't sound like a fan. That would be like if I was making a remake of The Terminator & said I am a fan of the original but Arnold Schwarzenegger acted robotic or Michael Biehn just cussed yelled & ran around & Linda Hamiltion just cried & ran around. See what I mean it's like if I said I love The Terminator but then I put it down doesn't sound like I am a fan of the original. If there was a country named Douchebagistan Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman would be The President.  Anyway I getting to this review I have been rambling on long enough Rubberman aka The Robocop remake was made on a budget of $130 only made $100 million I know that sounds like a lot of cash but it needs to make $30 to even try to make it's budget back it needs to make $300 million to break even. Robocop 1, 2 & & 3 combined doesn't have that kind of budget even when you add in The TV Series & Prime Directives it doesn't add up to $130 million. It was directed by Jose Padilla as I said I don't care about The Spirit Squad movies. Stars Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman with the worst by far portrayal of Alex Murphy & Robocop. Michael Keaton as Raymond Sellers, Abbie Cornish as Clara Murphy, Samuel L Jackson as Pat Novak, Gary Oldman as Dr Norton, Michael K Williams as Jack Lewis, Patrick Garrow as Antoine Vallon, John Paul Ruttan as David Murphy, Zach Grenier as Senator Dreyfus, Marianne Jean Baptiste as Chief Karen Dean, & Jackie Earle Hayley as Rick Mattox that should have been a red flag he was in another pos remake NOES. The story is well starting off at The MGM Logo it doesn't have the roar it starts off with BLULL BLULL BLULL I thought Sam Jackson was ready to sing The Rockabilly theme "" BLULL Rockabilly all night long, Rockabilly sing that song tonight."" Really then Sam Jackson goes ""MAWAH MAWAH!"" Seriously that's your opening BLULL MAWAH. & MAWAH like he was getting his vocal ready like Tootie in The Facts Of Life. Well yes cause were introduced into these segments called The Novak Element which I guess this the only show this Cable News Network runs I know it's a replacement for The Media Break Segments but those were actually cool. He wants this law called The Dreyfus Act Repealed a law that won't let robots patrol the streets in any American City. You also have that cringe worthy line from the trailer where Sam Jackson says why is America So Robophobic. Oh there's more cringe inducing lines & scenes to come. So it's main focus is being a cliche crime drama with corrupt cops & dealing with politics. The Cops are in with this Drug Dealer Gun Runner named Vallon the most forgettable villain in this franchise & you could put him in any cliche direct to video action movie. They show ED 209's in Iran along with these Robo Terminators some Suicide Bombers take them 1 of has a Son that runs out with knife & is gunned down by a ED 209. You do have the original Robocop theme when Robocop flashes on screen. The you're introduced to Alex Murphy who all The Kinnaman fans were bringing him up as the 2nd coming of George Clooney & all he does as Murphy is try his hardest to sound like a Wahlburg. I'd rather see Donny Wahlburg from Blue Bloods play this role & I know for a fact Page Fletcher from The Prime Directives could acts circles around Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman. He's talking to The Chief & this lady Marianne Jean Baptiste who plays Chief Dean I'm sorry she's a really bad actress. He tells her about this failed attempt to Vallon as I said could be the bad guy in any run of the mill action movie. Vallon has nothing on Clerance Boddicker you loved to hate this guy he scum so was his gang they had rememberable characters. Cain from Robocop 2 was atleast creepy did a good job portraying scum but that's cause Tom Noonan is an underrated actor. you didn't want to mess with them or even Hob even Geriant Wyn Davies in Prime Directives was a better villain. Anyway Murphy & Lewis who is a black guy they try to go after Vallon he knows something is up with leads to a terrible action scenes with quick cuts & shaky cam. I know it's a technique but it's tired old over done technique. Lewis is shot also in this action scene Murphy & Lewis can't shoot the broad side of a barn. He goes to the hospital to see Lewis while he's there 1 of Vallon's men put a bomb on Murphy's car like The Pelican Brief. Murphy goes home where were force fed this family drama & I didn't buy the love between Mr Full Performance & Abbie Cornish. While he's holding his Son he's going to kiss his Mom but Full Performance kisses her & he says ""Too slow boy."" Again am I suppose to care about this character cause he comes off as a trendy hipster douche bag. Anyway were force fed the fact Alex & Clara are in love so they have 1 of the most dulliest love scenes in a movie I have ever seen. The Car Alarm goes off he goes outside the bomb goes off which to me had no impact cause I saw a guy killed with a car bomb in The Pelican Brief I saw that in The Punisher 89 when Frank Castle's Wife & Kids are killed in a car explosion that was meant for Frank Castle. Plus that's no joke a better movie it had like an $11 million budget with well shot action scenes & characters I cared about it didn't need $130 budget. Anyway Omni Corp they're looking for donors they're talking with Clara Murphy they tell her Alex will be paralyzed so she signs him off & to me Murphy's Wife & Son knowing he's Robocop is what killed this movie for me from the get go I'm not sorry about this it's hard not to compare it to the original anytime they do sequels remakes or prequels. The fact that Alex Murphy can't go back to that life in order to protect his Wife & Son is the tragedy they respected that in Robocop 2 even when Murphy had to lie to Ellen his Wife that her Husband is dead I don't know you. That's 1 of the reasons I cared about this character. That & Peter Weller gave a ""full performance."" They force feed us more of this garbage where Murphy has a dream about his about dancing with his Wife with Fly Me To The Moon cause we have to force feed the fact they're in love. I do agree with a reviewer on YT that this is very heavy handed in the original it was more impactful when they just showed a few scenes of Murphy & his Wife. Murphy finds out he's a machine which the grey suit looks cheap & why didn't they clear his memory cause they should know that he's going to go out for revenge after the people who tried to kill him I say tried cause in all honesty he was still alive. He starts to run off The Scientists try to stop him Dr Norton let's him go oh & they took Robocop to China to build him he runs outside there's people in pink suits there's ED 209's which The ED 209's are the only thing I liked in this movie & I thought Gary Oldman was decent in it but I have never saw him give a bad performance. Robocop can run & jump walls or I'll just call him Rubberman so he's running in these Rice Paddies he was doing The Forest Gump run like Thomas Dekker in The NOES remake which I actually like Thomas Dekker in Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles I'd rather watch that show cause it's actually got drama that I buy & characters I care about. Anyway Rubberman is shut down & the way he falls down I was LMAO in fact I played that scene again 3 or 4 times with Herb Alpert's Spanish Flea. Then Rubberman sees what's left of him CGI Lungs face brain & a rod with a hand attached to it which looks so stupid I had no words for it. Oh & I will keep saying this why does he have a human hand it made sense in the original where Bob Morton says he wants full body prosthesis now lose the arm. I know this isn't the original but you know maybe Robocop didn't need a remake. Full Performance yells H  O  L  Y C  H  R  I  ST just horrible job of emoting. Rubberman has a video chat with his Wife which is not much really 1 not acting by a guy whose fans were bringing him up to be George Clooney. Rubberman gets some guns where this Military Tactican named Rick Mattox he tells Rubberman ""You can't buy this for a dollar."" Which is nothing more than a throwaway line. Then you get these training scenes where Mattox calls Rubberman Tin Man he says I like music while I work so guess what he plays "" If I Only Had A Heart"" From The Wizard Of Oz ""IF I ONLY HAD A HEART"" IN A ROBOCOP MOVIE WTF! That reminds me of The Halloween remake where Rob Zombie used ""Love Hurts"" another song that is out of place & if it was suppose to be funny or mean something they both failed although this remake is worse than The Halloween remake. You have this marketing guy talking to Raymond Sellers this guy is suppose to be the comic relief but he's about as funny as Carrot Top he shows Sellers Rubberman's Combat Mode which he says it put The Fear OfG  o  d in these prisoners which is an image of the original suit Sellers doesn't care for it the original line was suppose to be ""It looks like a toy from the 80's."" But it was cause of us real Robocop fans when the script was leaked & our anger at such disrespect that they changed that line. Then you have that rather dumb line that's in the trailer where Michael Keaton says ""Make it tactical let's make it black."" Don't you mean stealth cause blacks not tactical. Then Rubberman really becomes Rubberman with his black suit with looks like garbage. You have another training scene where Rubberman takes on Mattox & some Robo Terminator in another shaky cam quick cut scene you have this song played by Focus called Hocus Pocus the guitar riffs are great but you have yodeling in it that's right yodeling wtf. Then he shoots Mattox with his taser gun which is what he does throughout the movie other times it's shaky cam shoot outs. Anyway he shoots Mattox with his taser gun which is suppose to be funny but the humor in this movie is about as funny as combined show of Rob Schneider & Carrot Top. Then he gets back to Detroit where were force fed more of this family drama he talks to his Son & it's the exact opposite of emotional the acting by Page Fletcher & Anthony Lemke in The Prime Directives where Robocop talks his Son out of killing him & they reunite is far more emotional & drew me in. Rubberman & Lewis talk about going after Vallon Lewis says ""At least you're the right color now."" They're going to have a public introduction of Rubberman everyone in Detroit knows he's Alex Murphy which I'm thinking gee why doesn't Vallon go after Clara & David to mess around with Murphy. Rubberman is so excited that he has a seizure. What a joke this Robocop is. They get him back online they lower his dopamine levels where he has no emotions like Joel Kinnaman did in 1st place I mean he just sounds like he's constipated as Robocop. He catches some guy escaped criminal shoots him with a taser. You have another really lame Novak Element Segment. You have have him look for bad guys he goes & shoots 2 gang members with his taser then he has this 3rd guy his Robo Vision says totally stoned like you know we couldn't figure that out. He finds out Cops are in with Vallon so I have seen that in 50 other Police Drama's. He pulls this Corrupt Cop out of a car finds out more stuff on Vallon he goes after this fat drug dealer I'm sorry if I am not telling this in the correct order this movie is forgettable. He goes after these gang members in a Drug Lab with more shaky cam & quick cuts you don't know what's going on Jose Padilla HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A STEADY CAM OR A TRI POD. During these action scenes it doesn't help they cut to a control room where you have this assistant to Dr Norton doing some exposition BS. Honestly I have seen better action scenes in Direct To DVD Movies made on $5 to $15 million with Dolph Lundgren & Jean Claude Van Damme. You have scene where Rubberman is stopped by Clara who tells him he needs to see his Son he's scared & having nightmares he tells her he has to go look for bad guys so I'm not going to say he regains his humanity cause he doesn't earn that from me. On his Robo Vision it says David Murphy emotional status scared uh didn't his Wife just tell us that. He goes to his house where sees fragments from the explosion on the ground wouldn't that be in evidence you know. He has flashbacks to 1 of the least impactful car explosions ever. You have another awful action scene where Rubberman goes after Vallon & his gang btw the gang members are wearing Welding Glasses the entire action scene is in thermal vision when people are shot you don't see much he kills Vallon Cain & his Nuke Cult would take Vallon & his men out at the snap of a finger imagine what Clerance & his Gang could do to Vallons group. The villains are forgettable if I had a hero I could root for & care about I could forgive it for it's flaws but I have no hero to root for or care about cause the actor is awful. Rubberman goes to The Police Station you get another cringe worthy line that was in the trailer when they go after these 2 Corrupt Cops 1 of them says ""You wanna play good cop bad cop!?"" Lewis: ""Bad cop Robocop!' He finds out Chief Dean's behind all of it he goes to her office he yells for her to confess in a Christian Bale Batman voice. Mattox presses a button that shuts him down cue Spanish Flea by Herb Alpert again. Clara that Omni Corp won't let her & David see Rubberman she's going to file a lawsuit against Omni Corp Raymond Sellers tells her Rubberman is dead. Sellers tells Dr Norton he was just using Rubberman to repeal The Dreyfus Act so he wants Rubberman dead. Then we get a finish that's the definition of anti climatic where Dr Norton brings Rubberman back online removes the chip that shuts him down then Dr Norton get Lewis Rubberman goes to Omni Corp he shoots a guard with a taser the rest of them run off he goes around jumps like Spiderman destroy's some ED 209's the last ED 209 about 15 feet maybe less down with him Mr Full Performances see through visor he wanted so bad cracks his arm is stuck under an ED 209 he shoots his arm off but I'm wondering why has he broken his human hand yet. In Robocop 2 Robocop took himself & Robocop 2 off a 60 or more story skyscraper they crashed through a street into a sewer where they continued fighting. Sellers takes Clara & David hostage on the roof can't get more cliche than that. Rubberman is attacked by Mattox with a taser so he finds out he can't attack a red asset which is this movies directive 4 this movie is a red a  *  * Hat. He's getting pwnd until Lewis comes in shoots Mattox & Lewis is shot too. Rubberman tells gets to the roof where he tries to arrest Sellers cause Joshua Zetumer tells us that Michael Keaton's the bad guy even though I was like yeah whatever. Rubberman says ""Dead or alive you're coming with me."" In a constipated voice he's shutting down even though all them other times he is shut down he falls down like a dunce. He's in pain he shoots Seller but Seller manages to shoot Rubberman. Rubberman's WIfe & Son are like don't die the camera pans up which is just another cliche. Dr Nortan has put Rubberman in his cheap grey suit his family comes to see him doors shut another cliche we end with another 1 of those mind numbing Novak Element Segments. Then at the end credits they played ""I Fought The Law & The Law Won"" by The Clash I just face palmed & shook my head like The Old Man in Robocop 2 really ""I Fought The Law & The Law Won"" is great tune but it makes no sense & if it was meant to be funny then again it's about as funny as watching a combined show of Rob Schneider & Carrot Top & that's  Rubberman aka Robocop remake as it's own movie it's a cliche run of the mill movie with your typical corrupt cop crime drama mixed with a dull political plot point added with a super hero type origins story that I am sick of seeing. Action scenes that have shaky cam quick cuts you don't know wtf is going on & it didn't look like there was $130 million on screen. The people responsible for this movie & Joshua Zeturmer  should go Bowling with John Hyams who directed Universal Soldier Regeneration & Day Of Reckoning 2 movies that also have no respect for the original also. Joes Padilla did a really bad job directing I'm sorry but he wasn't the 2nd coming of James Cameron like his fans made him out to be. Joel ""Full Performance"" Kinnaman 2 years ago you said the original Robocop was nothing but jaw action you said this is chance to bring it a full performance. I saw your full performance I thought it was nothing but jaw action as Alex Murphy it was you acting like a hipster trendy douche bag & you trying to talk like a Wahlburg while I'm not the biggest Mark Wahlburg fan he could do a better job than Mr Full Performance. With Kinnaman it's like they got a guy off the street I could probably do about as good as Kinnaman. So I thought you gave the worst performance as Robocop  you couldn't get a cup of coffee for Peter Weller. Your not worth the smell of Robert John Burke'st  u  r  ds. Richard Eden didn't think much of this movie I heard & Page Fletcher could act circles around Joel Kinnaman. So go back to The Killing oh wait it got canceled twice TWICE! Go buy a copy of Robocop 1 & 2 & see how it's done. Gary Oldman was the only decent thing in this movie. Samuel L Jackson gave terrible performance sadly cause I like him. Michael Keaton was there but he did about as good as Rip Torn in Robocop 3. Michael K Williams was 1 note. Abbie Cornish was 1 note. Jackie Earle Hayley was alright but nothing good. Marianne Jean Baptiste was really bad. Zach Grenier was nothing. Patrick Garrow was dull. John Paul Rutton wasn't any good. Ending this very very very long rant was this was a product Hollywood the original wasn't in today's Hollywood system of what makes a quick buck let's say the original movie was never made & someone today in Hollywood was pitched they would be turned down cause it wouldn't have a name or make them a quick buck they don't want to take a chance. If today's Hollywood system was around 30 or 35 years ago guys like Wes Craven in his prime wouldn't be hired to direct. John Carpenter would never have been allowed to do Halloween or his version of The Thing. James Cameron say what you will about Avatar the guy was an awesome director in the 80's & 90's. Guys like Stallone with Rocky, Paul Verhoeven & Michael Mann would never get a shot in Hollywood. Cause they wouldn't take a chance instead go with some tool director & whatever gets them opening weekend. To end this here's a quote from Peter Weller ""There should be a list of 25 movies that shouldn't ever be touched. I'm done with Robocop but watching twice I watched it twice it is anthropological you can watch it in a 100 years from now & you can harken back to say what was the political, social & economic dynamic. What was the idea of commercialism what was the beginning of the age information ripping off identity what was the story of identity theft. All that stuff is pressure to written in 1981 to be filmed in 1985 or 86 & still live not to mention Phil Tippett's stop motion animation & Verhoeven's infusion of Mid Evil cause he's got a Degree in Mid Evil History all of the mythic images of resurrection were all there."" He added ""There's only 1 thing that's changed technology's changed storytelling movie making is still the same it doesn't matter if we use a Mitchell Camera a Panaflex Camera a Red Cam or a Auralex. It's the same deal. if you've got a good story interpersonal relationships & you can beef it up with some effects. That's the gift of Robocop is it's humor & it's poignant story of resurrection & redemption & it's particular political message for everyone sees it. The only distinction now is you can throw $80 million & CGI at the screen.""SO LEAVE ROBOCOP ALONE & STOP REMAKING PERFECT MOVIES!",1,Rubberman aka Robocop a full performance rant 0/10,1392681600,"02

But there were things about this RoboCop remake that I just couldn't get over. First of all, taking the rating down to a PG-13 when remaking an R-rated film is usually a mistake. How could you possibly emulate the essence of the original film, known for it's particular brand of violence, by dropping the rating? On top of that not release an unrated cut?I was a fan of the tech in the 'not-too-distant-future', especially the Omnicorp machines, RoboCop's bike and all the hologram interfaces (even though they didn't do much for the cars but throw hubcaps on em). I was not really a fan of the over-emotional tone throughout the movie, there wasn't really enough run and gun action/violence to balance out all the &#34;I'm a monster&#34; scenes. When I first heard Joel Kinnaman from AMC's 'The Killing' was going to be the new Alex Murphy, I didn't know how I felt about it. After watching the movie and seeing that he basically plays a similar character, I still don't know how I feel about it.Samuel L Jackson's &#34;The Novak Element&#34; bit served as something of a right winged Greek chorus for the film and was mildly amusing. Finally at the end of the movie there is a big action scene, but the CG seemed a little too flimsy for it to feel authentic.

Alex Murphy , a cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit - is critically injured and OmniCorp grabs their chance to build a part-man, part-robot police officer.Although the basic premise of the original and this version are the same, there are some differences that makes this Robocop different, some not necessarily better.  The original was a bit more gritty and this version tones that down a lot and seems to focus more on the struggles of developing Robocop more.  In fact, I thought that this version took way too long to get going and focused way too much on his development in the lab.  And while this version tries to tackle some of today's issues, the scenes with Novak (Jackson) seem out of place and too preachy at times, a waste to me of Jackson's talents as an actor as he would have made a better villain for the movie than a social commentator.  Additionally, I liked the way the family issues were handled better in the original with Murphy struggling with the memories of his family and humanity versus the way it was done here with maybe too much focused on that especially early on, slowing the movie to me to a crawl at times.  To me, I also prefer the way the original Robocop's memory was handled in which his memory was wiped and he struggles to remember versus just drugging him in this version.  I also agree with some reviewers that say the acting was uneven, the chemistry ofthe actors who played Murphy and his wife seemed a bit stiff at best.The special effects qualities of the movie are definitely better especially with a 25 plus year difference but for those that remember the original, overall the total product unfortunately doesn't rise above it.

As &#34;Cyborg Policeman,&#34; maybe this movie's a decent 3 stars. But depending on how much you are outraged/puzzled by this being called &#34;Robocop,&#34; you will like the product that much less in the end.The &#34;injured cop becomes crime-fighting machine&#34; premise is left barely intact. But everything else has been upgraded(?) to resemble one of today's many blockbuster PG-13 superhero movies. What's sorely lacking from this film is the interesting philosophy and black comedy that made the original an instant classic. The absence of the original's violence and carnage only adds to the feeling that this is an inferior, watered-down product.One strange problem is the shift in focus from the hero to the world surrounding him. This new Robocop is not the hero of the story; Gary Oldman's scientist is. And instead of the man wrestling with being the robot, the would-be deep musings of this plot are spent mildly debating the modern drone/intelligence/police state of society. There are no villains in this film either, until they make some for a flashy ending.Whenever Robocop does go to work, he does not resemble his old self. Version 2.0 is a spry ninja, racing, rolling and leaping around as the exact opposite of the original's lumbering tank. He's got a sweet new motorcycle that kids will love this Christmas too.Being different from the original does not necessarily make this movie bad. But the movie itself is only sporadically entertaining, as very few of its action scenes, tender character moments or discussions on politics/technology are ever really gripping. What redeems the movie slightly is one-and-a-half cool CGI action scenes, and its fantastic supporting cast giving their all despite their limited roles.The movie is played in a very straightforward and familiar manner, while taking very little risks. Producers were obviously hoping to spawn a franchise of Robocop happy meals the whole family can enjoy, reinventing Robocop as the newest superhero.But if you saw and enjoyed the zany original, it won't help you enjoy this mild movie any more.",2,Robotic remake has no soul,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,2174,"['remake', 'going', 'stray', 'so', 'far', 'original', 'why', 'bother', 'stealing', 'name', '34', 'Cyborg', 'Policeman', '34', 'maybe', 'movie', 'decent', '3', 'stars', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'outraged/puzzled', 'being', 'called', '34', 'Robocop', '34', 'will', 'like', 'product', 'much', 'less', 'end.The', '34', 'injured', 'cop', 'crime-fighting', 'machine', '34', 'premise', 'left', 'barely', 'intact', 'everything', 'else', 'been', 'upgraded', 'resemble', 'one', 'today', 'many', 'blockbuster', 'PG-13', 'superhero', 'movies', 'What', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'film', 'interesting', 'philosophy', 'black', 'comedy', 'made', 'original', 'instant', 'classic', 'absence', 'original', 'violence', 'carnage', 'only', 'feeling', 'inferior', 'watered-down', 'product.One', 'strange', 'problem', 'shift', 'focus', 'hero', 'world', 'surrounding', 'new', 'Robocop', 'not', 'hero', 'story', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'scientist', 'instead', 'man', 'wrestling', 'being', 'robot', 'would-be', 'deep', 'musings', 'plot', 'are', 'spent', 'mildly', 'debating', 'modern', 'drone/intelligence/police', 'state', 'society', 'are', 'villains', 'film', 'make', 'flashy', 'ending.Whenever', 'Robocop', 'go', 'work', 'not', 'resemble', 'old', 'self', 'Version', '2.0', 'spry', 'ninja', 'racing', 'rolling', 'leaping', 'around', 'exact', 'opposite', 'original', 'lumbering', 'tank', 'got', 'sweet', 'new', 'motorcycle', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'Christmas', 'too.Being', 'different', 'original', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'movie', 'only', 'sporadically', 'entertaining', 'very', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'tender', 'character', 'moments', 'discussions', 'politics/technology', 'are', 'ever', 'really', 'gripping', 'What', 'movie', 'slightly', 'one-and-a-half', 'cool', 'CGI', 'action', 'scenes', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'cast', 'giving', 'limited', 'roles.The', 'movie', 'played', 'very', 'straightforward', 'familiar', 'manner', 'taking', 'very', 'little', 'risks', 'Producers', 'were', 'obviously', 'hoping', 'spawn', 'franchise', 'Robocop', 'happy', 'meals', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'reinventing', 'Robocop', 'newest', 'superhero.But', 'saw', 'enjoyed', 'zany', 'original', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'mild', 'movie', 'more']",N/A

Mostly delivers what its supposed to in the right amounts and appropriate places.But 'adequate' is hardly the goal is it?In truth, I'm not a fan of the original movies. The over-the-top violence and snarky humor that was Robocop left something to be desired in terms of a story. And yet I appreciated them for what they were - live action cartoons with a dash of playground politics.This filmmakers behind this reboot did what makes sense - going for realism was the only creative option left. Especially given that the original series had maxed out the half-baked social commentary, dark comedy, and pure gore. i.e. Fun.In some ways this reminds me of the rebooted 'Total Recall'By subtracting the cartoon - they left nothing but a shell of its former self.Now, had they gone really dark, this might've been interesting. But in striking a balance between action and drama - the premise got muddied.However, I give credit to the actors. In particular Michael Keaton, the always enjoyable Jackie Earle Haley, and lead actor Joel Kinnaman - who, collectively, gave the production very solid performances. The best scene in the entire film came as Officer Murphy is shown a mirror. The special effects blending perfectly with the drama, the horror of seeing that there was nothing left of who he was, and that there was no return to physical humanity. Kinnaman played the scene with heart-rending conviction when he begs for someone to kill him.I wish the entire movie was like that.But ultimately, this was never going to work. There are too many fans of the original; comparisons were inevitable and 30 years of cult-hardened positions were unlikely to accept a pedestrian re-envisioned tale of their beloved classic.Finally, having read the criticisms by the hardcore fans - I find myself in rare agreement. I too prefer the massive old hardware that made up Murphy's original body chassis. There was substance in that original suit. Watching that cyborg monstrosity clanking itself through the movies, there was a real sense of The Machine - something soulless and unstoppable.An excellent analogy would be comparing a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta to an M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. The former is sleek and beautiful. But the latter is something that will make people pee their pants. One might get ooos and ahhs from a race car, but you'll get a heavy dose of fearsome respect when a sixty-ton combat machine grinds itself down a civilian roadway.The production should have been thinking ""tank"" - not ""race car"". And when they switched to tactical black, the entire franchise's worth of shock & awe went out the door. He looked like any tactical SWAT officer in any big city police department. Sad and wasteful.

Anyways, that being said I had not seen the movie previous to buying it(I have seen it now). Now the review of the movie! Ok first off I did not find the main character very likeable. Joel Kinnaman was a bad choice for this movie in my opinion. He is not a bad actor by any means but this role was just bland for him. The plot of the movie is not bad, it is a little too complex for an action movie which is why I think it was not that appealing to me. I love a good story and good action but there did not seem to be enough action as much as there was talking scenes. The camera work is really shoddy at times and it really turned me off.

1690941,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00HNGZHDE,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[61, 83]","I've always been a big fan of ""Robocop,"" which is to say that I've been a fan long enough to watch the titular character transform from a post-modernist take on violent pop culture into a franchise that spawned a cartoon for kids.  Or to put it another way, ""Robocop"" went full meta, coming full circle to be the embodiment of violence Paul Verhoeven was ferociously satirizing.  And then we have Jose Padilha's version.Oh, we've got all the beats: suburban dad and honest cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is ground up by the corruption of Detroit's criminal machinations and the ruthless corporate overlord of Omnicorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton); he's then spit out as a cyborg, the creation of the Dr. Frankenstein-like Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman).  If there's one thing this new iteration of ""Robocop"" gets right, it's that this film is as much Dr. Norton's story as it is Murphy's.  He's led down a golden path paved with promises to help the population at large by sacrificing, bit by bloody bit, pieces of Murphy's life.The other thing that ""Robocop"" does differently from the original is thrust the family Murphy leaves behind front and center: wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan).  It took the sequel in the original franchise to get around to even addressing this, but it's a major plot point in the reboot, and that's a good thing.  There's lots of modern twists that make this reboot timely, from the question of drones used on American soil to an always-on television culture that dissects everything and anything.  There's just one problem: it's not funny.The original ""Robocop"" was a relentlessly violent, gleefully cynical take on modern life in the 80s, fulfilling every jingoistic ambition for America in one glorious blender of murder, rape, late-night television commercials, and awful reality show slogans.  Verhoeven never let us forget that there was a craptacular world on the periphery of the events of ""Robocop,"" and that burden falls to blowhard talk show host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) in the new version.  For the first few seconds, when Novak's vocal exercises are dubbed over the MGM lion's roar, there's the promise that he can pull it off...and then he simply doesn't.""Robocop"" is suffused with enough modern touches to make things occasionally uncomfortable, like when a kid with a knife gets gunned down by an ED-209. But most of the time it's too busy ping-ponging between Murphy's internal struggle with his new body -- or lack thereof -- and his attempt to solve his own murder, with occasional asides by marketing execs marveling at how the plot is unspooling on the stage of American television.The problem is that there are no clear villains here. The original neatly connected all the dots so that Murphy wasn't just killing the men who killed him, he was truly cutting the head off a corporate snake. In the remake, nobody's really at fault -- they just take stupid risks in pursuit of greed.  This robs the film of the catharsis of the original .This version covers the same story of ""Robocop,"" but it simply can't live up -- or stoop low enough -- to top the original.",3,Not stooping low enough to top the original,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,3154,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Robocop', 'say', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'titular', 'character', 'transform', 'post-modernist', 'take', 'violent', 'pop', 'culture', 'franchise', 'spawned', 'cartoon', 'kids', 'put', 'way', 'Robocop', 'went', 'full', 'meta', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'be', 'embodiment', 'violence', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'was', 'ferociously', 'satirizing', 'then', 'have', 'Jose', 'Padilha', 'version.Oh', ""'ve"", 'got', 'beats', 'suburban', 'dad', 'honest', 'cop', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'ground', 'up', 'corruption', 'Detroit', 'criminal', 'machinations', 'ruthless', 'corporate', 'overlord', 'Omnicorp', 'CEO', 'Raymond', 'Sellars', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'then', 'spit', 'out', 'cyborg', 'creation', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein-like', 'Dr.', 'Dennett', 'Norton', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'one', 'thing', 'new', 'iteration', 'Robocop', 'right', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Dr.', 'Norton', 'story', 'Murphy', 'led', 'down', 'golden', 'path', 'paved', 'promises', 'help', 'population', 'large', 'sacrificing', 'bit', 'bloody', 'bit', 'pieces', 'Murphy', 'life.The', 'other', 'thing', 'Robocop', 'differently', 'original', 'thrust', 'family', 'Murphy', 'front', 'center', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'son', 'David', 'John', 'Paul', 'Ruttan', 'took', 'sequel', 'original', 'franchise', 'get', 'even', 'addressing', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'reboot', 'good', 'thing', 'lots', 'modern', 'twists', 'make', 'reboot', 'timely', 'question', 'drones', 'used', 'American', 'soil', 'always-on', 'television', 'culture', 'everything', 'anything', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'not', 'funny.The', 'original', 'Robocop', 'was', 'relentlessly', 'violent', 'gleefully', 'cynical', 'take', 'modern', 'life', '80s', 'fulfilling', 'jingoistic', 'ambition', 'America', 'one', 'glorious', 'blender', 'murder', 'rape', 'late-night', 'television', 'commercials', 'awful', 'reality', 'show', 'slogans', 'Verhoeven', 'never', 'let', 'forget', 'was', 'craptacular', 'world', 'periphery', 'events', 'Robocop', 'burden', 'blowhard', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Pat', 'Novak', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'new', 'version', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'when', 'Novak', 'vocal', 'exercises', 'are', 'dubbed', 'MGM', 'lion', 'roar', 'promise', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'then', 'simply', ""n't"", 'Robocop', 'suffused', 'enough', 'modern', 'touches', 'make', 'things', 'occasionally', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'kid', 'knife', 'gunned', 'down', 'ED-209', 'most', 'time', 'too', 'busy', 'ping-ponging', 'Murphy', 'internal', 'struggle', 'new', 'body', 'lack', 'thereof', 'attempt', 'solve', 'own', 'murder', 'occasional', 'asides', 'marketing', 'execs', 'marveling', 'how', 'plot', 'unspooling', 'stage', 'American', 'television.The', 'problem', 'are', 'clear', 'villains', 'here', 'original', 'neatly', 'connected', 'dots', 'Murphy', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'killing', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'was', 'truly', 'cutting', 'head', 'corporate', 'snake', 'remake', 'nobody', 'really', 'fault', 'just', 'take', 'stupid', 'risks', 'pursuit', 'greed', 'film', 'catharsis', 'original', '.This', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'Robocop', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'stoop', 'low', 'enough', 'top', 'original']",N/A

This remake/reboot/recriminating version of Robocop had people wondering if it was going to flop from the moment they first saw the trailer's for this thing... I think most of us thought, &#34;Well, the suit looks crap, and the plot isn't looking too good, but it has Micheal Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman, so maybe it might be better than it is previewing it to be?&#34; ... but the result is simply, it's not.What Jos&eacute; Padilha has done to Paul Verhoeven original masterpeice should be incriminating. For over 20 years now Robocop fans have loved the story of an officer who became a machine, but his heart and soul could not be deleted and the human side shone through the machine in the end. Where as this 2014 remake is the complete opposite, changing every aspect of what made the original Robocop likeable and making it a stupid attempt to have Iron Man part of the suit, not just wearing it.Everything that made Robocop Robocop, is now gone. There is probably 3 references in this entire remake to the original.Now you're probably thinking I'm just being nostalgic and sticking to what I know? Wrong, I went into this movie expecting it to be different, but somewhat cool, re-imagined in a new way... which, I did get... but not in an enjoyable way. By the time this thing was over, I wanted to throw my drink at the screen for it intending there will be a sequel, and flick my boogers at Samuel L. Jackson & Micheal Keaton for delivering a next to nothing performance. They did not make their roles anything that any other actor could not have done and come across the same way. Joel Kinnaman played the part of Robocop/Alex Murphy too human like. Maybe that is nitpicking because I preferred it that way in the originals and so on, but you can't knock it either seeing as how it's been done the same way for 20 years and now all of a sudden Robocop is just a living man being kept alive by the suit.The only one who did play a decent role was Gary Oldman. But, hey, it's Gary Oldman, ya know? Does he ever play anything bad? No, but it's a shame he gave his usual 110% to the role, but everyone else and the plot around him let everything else down.It's a no wonder none of the actors involved in the original wanted anything to do with this one (as cameos) you just have to see this one once and figure out why!

1690944,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B00HNGZHDE,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 2]","Personally, I am enjoying the current trend of reboots, in other words the remakes of old music, television and movies. Lately every episode of Grey's Anatomy has had a remake of a hit song from the 80's or 90's. I easily recognize the tunes and lyrics, but there definitely a little something different about the beat or rhythm. I have noticed the same for movies. About Last Night, Star Trek, Terminator, Predator, Total Recall, Fright Night, Steel Magnolias, Batman, Spiderman, Superman, and even Endless Love (ok I haven't really seen that one but since I was on a roll, I added that one too). Even TV shows, like V and Rosemary's Baby are getting facelifts. Regardless I have found these reboots to be entertaining and somewhat refreshing. With that in mind, I did not hesitate to watch Robocop, another take on a movie classic (ok, calling this one a classic might be a stretch, but you get the picture.  And while some would argue that none of the movies I named were really original, but simply remakes, I beg to differ. While you can recognize the original story, there is enough new stuff added to the storyline to make it feel different and refreshing. I mean the graphics alone elevate each new version. The graphics of 2014 are a lot better than those in the late 80s and 90s.Now a brief synopsis: Devoted husband, father and Detroit Detective Murphy (played by the talented and brooding, Joel Kinnaman) is injured and his wife makes the decision to save his life at all costs, which in this case means his actual body (he is more machine than flesh and blood). Donating his remains (well, he really wasn't dead, just not a lot of him left) to Omnicorp, a company that is creating cyborgs in hopes of one day reducing the number of human casualties on the street (cops) and in the military (soldiers) . Murphy is a prototype of what is to come. The problem, he has memories of his former life, being human, having feelings, and longs for what he knows he can no longer have. With only the help of a dedicated scientist/doctor, Dr. Norton (played by Gary Oldman) who is trying to help him transition into his new world, he has to learn how to do the job by remove emotion from the picture. He is in essence going to be a robot, not just look like one. Meanwhile, we see a greedy, corrupt, heartless CEO (Mr. Sellers of Omnicorp), who is only interested in one thing, the bottom line...making money. And whomever he has to sacrifice to do that and make the program successful, so be it. His success rides on Murphy's ability to carry out his duties. And finally, while growing to live with his new situation and cleaning up a city riddled with corruption and crime, Murphy must also deal with treachery in his own department. What is a man of honor to do but stop them.Personally I thought that Robocop was decent and definitely worth a try if you enjoyed the original(s).

1690947,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00HNGZHDE,M. Oleson,"[0, 3]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.We've all gotten used to reboots by now, so I guess there's nothing particularly wrong with updating Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original.  I really liked that movie, but my only complaint was Nancy Allen's performance as Murphy/Robocop's partner.  Here, he has a male partner named Jack played by ""Boardwalk Empire's"" Michael K. Williams.  The primary female role here is played by Abbie Cornish as Clara, the wife of Alex Murphy (TV's ""The Killing"" Joel Kinnaman) a gung-ho cop taking action a bit out of his reach.Set in a futuristic Detroit, a multi-national corporation known as OmniCorp has essentially pacified most of the world using robotic soldiers.  The U. S. is the lone holdout.  Stymied by politics, the corporate CEO, Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) tasks his chief scientist, Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to come up with robotics that would work well on a physically deficient man.  When Murphy is the victim of a car bomb, he becomes the perfect specimen.Successful as he is, Robocop is still part human and that becomes a problem for Sellers and the primary mobster who tried to kill Murphy.  Murphy suspects corruption in the police department, but he isn't sure where it leads or ends.  Directed by Brazillian Jose Padilha (""Elite Squad""), the film moves along briskly.  While there are scenes of violence, it is mostly Robocop and his allies against machines.  Like its predecessor, the story is about the human emotion and how it can influence actions.

Perhaps that is why  have come away feeling pleasantly surprised.  For sure, the raw satirical edge which was in truth enhanced by the gory Verhoeven touch, is missing in this sanitized version.  What we do get is a slick retelling of the story, surprisingly more human at its core.  There is more questioning here on what it is to be human &#8211; and a little less on the dehumanizing of culture.  That said, the Samuel Jackson character that replaces the witty adverts of the earlier version, personified here as a right wing political editorial show, is amusing and occasionally pointed, but over-egged.What adds class to the proceedings is the surrounding players &#8211; following this journey from human cop to Robocop and then trying to find his way back, is a bunch of fine actors.  Gary Oldman is hardly stretching his acting talents here, but he makes his sympathetic  scientist who has angst about crossing moral boundaries, but can be tempted to do so, genuinely believable.  Michael Keaton plays a more conventional character who is just what he seems to be &#8211; a manipulative CEO who is only interested in the bottom line&#8230; but he manages to bring a few of his acting tics to give a little quirkiness to the role.  Kudos too to Abbie Cornish as the wife with tough decisions to make.The balance of this movie is really much more about a man&#8217;s coming to terms with his injuries and how these have changed his life.  Doctors have saved him, but have they allowed him the chance to really live?  There is much less focus on any storyline giving a focal bad guy to boo at and give the audience a sense of excitement as the movie builds to a climax.  The climax here does have action, but is ultimately much more about one man&#8217;s journey to find meaning in his new circumstances.  As such, overall, Jose Padilha has made a more believable movie than the first one, both in terms of character and in terms of science.  What it arguably lacks though, is the sense of fun that came with the first one &#8211; Verhoeven knew how to sweeten his satire with an over the top sensibility ladened with black humor.  Here the director has opted instead to make things palatable by simply dialing back the satire and making a more conventional film.  It works, as that, and better than I for one had hoped for &#8211; but fans of the original are bound to feel somewhat shortchanged.6/10",4,"Sturdy remake, a little too sanitised",1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,2610,"['remake', 'Robocop', 'movie', 'biting', 'satire', 'merged', '80', '8217', 's', 'style', 'exploitation', 'violence', 'seemed', 'idea', 'doomed', 'failure..', 'went', 'movie', 'correspondingly', 'low', 'expectations', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'have', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sure', 'raw', 'satirical', 'edge', 'was', 'truth', 'enhanced', 'gory', 'Verhoeven', 'touch', 'missing', 'sanitized', 'version', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'slick', 'retelling', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'human', 'core', 'more', 'questioning', 'here', 'what', 'be', 'human', '8211', 'little', 'less', 'dehumanizing', 'culture', 'said', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'character', 'witty', 'adverts', 'earlier', 'version', 'personified', 'here', 'right', 'wing', 'political', 'editorial', 'show', 'amusing', 'occasionally', 'pointed', 'over-egged.What', 'class', 'proceedings', 'surrounding', 'players', '8211', 'following', 'journey', 'human', 'cop', 'Robocop', 'then', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'bunch', 'fine', 'actors', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'hardly', 'stretching', 'acting', 'talents', 'here', 'sympathetic', 'scientist', 'who', 'angst', 'crossing', 'moral', 'boundaries', 'can', 'be', 'tempted', 'do', 'so', 'genuinely', 'believable', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'more', 'conventional', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'what', 'be', '8211', 'manipulative', 'CEO', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'bottom', 'line', '8230', 'bring', 'few', 'acting', 'tics', 'give', 'little', 'quirkiness', 'role', 'Kudos', 'too', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'wife', 'tough', 'decisions', 'make.The', 'balance', 'movie', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'man', '8217', 'coming', 'terms', 'injuries', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'life', 'Doctors', 'have', 'saved', 'have', 'allowed', 'chance', 'really', 'live', 'much', 'less', 'focus', 'storyline', 'giving', 'focal', 'bad', 'guy', 'boo', 'give', 'audience', 'sense', 'excitement', 'movie', 'climax', 'climax', 'here', 'have', 'action', 'ultimately', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'journey', 'find', 'meaning', 'new', 'circumstances', 'such', 'overall', 'Jose', 'Padilha', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'movie', 'first', 'one', 'terms', 'character', 'terms', 'science', 'What', 'arguably', 'sense', 'fun', 'came', 'first', 'one', '8211', 'Verhoeven', 'knew', 'how', 'sweeten', 'satire', 'top', 'sensibility', 'ladened', 'black', 'humor', 'Here', 'director', 'opted', 'instead', 'make', 'things', 'palatable', 'simply', 'dialing', 'back', 'satire', 'making', 'more', 'conventional', 'film', 'better', 'one', 'had', 'hoped', '8211', 'fans', 'original', 'are', 'bound', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'shortchanged.6/10']",N/A

A HUGE point of the original Robo was that he is initially put on-line as a cyborg, &#34;super cop&#34;. Then, he begins to have glitches, dreams and images of his death and former life. This sets him off to go out and uncover the corruption that brought him down as a man, to discover who or what he is, expose OCP and go directly to the bad guys - Clarence Bonnicker and crew. It represents a world in the near future, fittingly taking place in Detroit and is a statement about our society - especially when the news clips and commercial are shown. Once again, satirical in the right places.This new one has NONE of that.

It centers around the horror someone must experience when their body has only a few parts left and the rest is cybernetic. Family relationships and social skills necessarily take a real hit. Is the result human, or as described by the lead scientist, after adjusting Robocop's brain, Alex Murphy, or a machine that just thinks it is Murphy? Will he get his real brain back? I'm not telling.Action sequences are well done, but there are some anachronisms. .50 cal bullets and above are supposed to penetrate Robocop's armor, but don't seem to. Hits to the head don't seem to register either. etc. He just bowls dozens over like paper props. This verges on boring. The plot is somewhat disjointed, but the performances by Joel Kinnaman and Abby Cornish are good though hobbled by the plot. (Evil businessman wants to make zillions on robot crime enforcement, but is opposed by a senator. Uses Robocop to showcase his views to sway public opinion) Gary Oldman, is as always, spot on character playing the nuanced semi-villain scientist.If you liked the original Robocop, See this version though I think you'll find it not as good. Maybe because &#34;it's been done, It's been done!&#34; Or perhaps the rather depressing mess that remains of the the real Murphy.

In the original movie Robocop redevelop his humanity remembering bits and pieces of his past. He had to put what limited information together to reconstruct the life he once had. This offers a very touching approach to acknowledging all that he has lost. In the original, Robocop had no humanity, but you could sense the good in him, while in this newer version his humanity had to be turn off due to the overwhelming emotion, which seems to take away a lot.

Murphy gets a bit too close and  is taken out..in this version murphy wasnt tourtured and gunned down (and sadly theres NO clarence boddicker in this one)  in  this one  he was wounded by a car bomb(yawn)...nothing too original with that one..but  to keep it pg-13  i see why they went that route,, in the 87 film murphy was  well,  lets be honest. the guy was crucified!  and you really felt for him when he was brought back.the  plot change in this one...is that Murphy's wife was the one that made the  choice of what would happen to him.. ..i wasnt  fond of that..but with this version  it works.  in  Robocop 2  it  was briefly touched upon  that murphy's wife finally knows what happened..but they didnt  really go on with that and for that fim it was smart that they didnt...  in this film they make the wife and son more prominent in murphys life...which adds a  plot layer  that wasnt really needed..but like i said before in this version is helps because it helps keep murphy grounded...what i liked about this film  is that they went  more hands on..showing how murphy was re constructed into robocop..  how  would he be emotionally after the surgery and the like...the whole illusion of being in control  scheme  i found facinating.  gary oldman  was excellent as the doctor who was tasked with  creating robocop...he had sort of a Dr frankenstein quality to the role  which works perfectly...we also see how Robocop is put together...and what is really left of Murphy inside the armor... the one thing that  i wasnt crazy about  is that in this story (also in the original) there was  this HUGE made in america..mentality...and where was Robo assembled?..  you got it...the  task  was outsourced to CHINA... sure i guess it makes sense...but cmon!  you mean to say  we  cant build anything in america anymore  ??  that scene where Robo  jumps the fence to escape the factory  and  for a quick sec  to me  he was like  where am i?  why am i in China?The Robocop suits used in this film were well done...the original 87 look  was referenced  which was a great touch..the  first model  was a streamlined version of the 87 suit  ..and it looks perfect...later in the film they wanted him to look more  military  so they went  with black ...  but later on  im glad they reverted to the classic colors ..and yep, murphy still has the gun/holster in his  leg...Murphy  still has a shootout  in a drug factory..although its NOT as violent..theres  an ED-209 battle...lots of action all the social commentary /satire  is still there  its ROBOCOP after allmurphy solves his  murder..gets his revenge....  says that famous line..if you  love the robocop films..youll enjoy this...  sit back and enjoy  its worth checking this one out... Joel kinnaman makes a great murphy..but is NO peter weller  but then again  Both actors  are top notch in the role...who do you prefer ? well thats up to youthe blu ray is beautiful and the sound is top notch!  same with the dvd  cool crisp picture...i have the combo pack so i watched both..the bonus features are a bit skimpy  but the documentary was good....if they do a sequel to this..,and i

It sounds boring but I actually found it intriguing and nicely laid out. This is very different from the original. No viscious gang, no gore, no cult status feel like the 1987 version. But, as a stand alone movie it surpassed my expectations. The family dynamic was actually touching and needed, I really felt for this guy. In a way, I guess this is better than having a cheesy camp fest like other remakes where they breeze over those moments. This Robo gets deep into the politics of the man/machine idea and if it's morally right. In that sense, the movie is very restrained which some may find flat. Where Murphy was Robocop in about 20 minutes in the orignal, this seems to take about an hour until he's in the suit. And he doesn't immediately head out to chase bad guys either. Again, I enjoyed what they did with the remake though it takes no risks like the original. I'd like to see a sequel since he's back in his silver suit at the end and the origin tale is now done.

1690970,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00HNGZHDE,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[164, 181]","Nine Things about the Movie ""Robocop"" (2014)1.  This is a ""remake"" of the classic 1987 film. But while the name and basic plot is the same, this is a very different movie.2. It's set in the year 2028 where the Omnicorp company sells robot police to the U.S. military for use in countries overseas. But they are not allowed in the U.S. because Americans are paranoid about robots running law enforcement.3. When police officer Alex Murphy gets blown up in front of his house, Omnicorp gets the idea to take what's left of him and make him a robot. This is done in the hopes that by retaining a basic human identity, Americans will accept robotic police. But Murphy's human ethics conflict with his robotic programming, and it causes problems.4. Both versions of the movie are making social commentaries on their times. The 1987 version was a satire on 80's American consumer culture and excess. The 2014 version is more of a commentary on national security, and the boundaries of technology and humanity.5. The 1987 version was rated R and was very violent and bloody for its time. This version does have a lot of shootouts and killing, but there is almost no blood. It is rated PG-13.6. In the 1987 version Murphy is actually killed and resurrected, but his human memories are all wiped. In this version, Murphy isn't actually killed; leaving his humanity intact is a key plot element.7. This version is much more philosophical than the original. It's partly an existential meditation on identity, free will, and what makes us human.8. One of the more interesting changes is the character of Murphy's partner, Lewis. In the 1987 original, Lewis was a white woman. In this version, Lewis is a black man.9. If you are expecting a direct remake of the 1987 cult classic, you will be disappointed. But the director wisely left the original alone and basically made a new movie. If you like movies that mix action with intellect, this is worth seeing.",4,"not really a remake, but a new movie",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,1946,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', 'Robocop', '2014', '1', 'remake', 'classic', '1987', 'film', 'name', 'basic', 'plot', 'same', 'very', 'different', 'movie.2', 'set', 'year', '2028', 'where', 'Omnicorp', 'company', 'robot', 'police', 'U.S.', 'military', 'use', 'countries', 'overseas', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'U.S.', 'Americans', 'are', 'paranoid', 'robots', 'running', 'law', 'enforcement.3', 'When', 'police', 'officer', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'blown', 'up', 'front', 'house', 'Omnicorp', 'idea', 'take', 'what', 'left', 'make', 'robot', 'done', 'hopes', 'retaining', 'basic', 'human', 'identity', 'Americans', 'will', 'accept', 'robotic', 'police', 'Murphy', 'human', 'ethics', 'conflict', 'robotic', 'programming', 'problems.4', 'versions', 'movie', 'are', 'making', 'social', 'commentaries', 'times', '1987', 'version', 'was', 'satire', '80', 'American', 'consumer', 'culture', 'excess', '2014', 'version', 'more', 'commentary', 'national', 'security', 'boundaries', 'technology', 'humanity.5', '1987', 'version', 'was', 'rated', 'R', 'was', 'very', 'violent', 'bloody', 'time', 'version', 'have', 'lot', 'shootouts', 'killing', 'almost', 'blood', 'rated', 'PG-13.6', '1987', 'version', 'Murphy', 'actually', 'killed', 'resurrected', 'human', 'memories', 'are', 'wiped', 'version', 'Murphy', ""n't"", 'actually', 'killed', 'leaving', 'humanity', 'intact', 'key', 'plot', 'element.7', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'philosophical', 'original', 'partly', 'existential', 'meditation', 'identity', 'free', 'will', 'what', 'human.8', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'changes', 'character', 'Murphy', 'partner', 'Lewis', '1987', 'original', 'Lewis', 'was', 'white', 'woman', 'version', 'Lewis', 'black', 'man.9', 'are', 'expecting', 'direct', 'remake', '1987', 'cult', 'classic', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'director', 'wisely', 'left', 'original', 'alone', 'basically', 'made', 'new', 'movie', 'like', 'movies', 'mix', 'action', 'intellect', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

I was a bit nervous about this film because Hollywood tends to butcher movies these days in the hopes of making movies that everyone can enjoy, rather than sticking with the source material and making something really great. This movie really is great in it's ability to take a concept from back in the day, and make it a product of it's own time. I liked how they addressed how the American public feels about certain aspects of these futuristic concepts, since that is what we currently are dealing with today with drones and the NSA.My only 2 complaints about the movie are that there just isn't enough action scenes, I can recall about 4 off the top of my head, and only 2 of them were really cool. As well as it not feeling as charged emotionally as the original in a lot of ways. Like in the first Robocop, once Robocop remembered who he was, it was like you knew it was on, and it was portrayed very well. Not as much in this film. Also I prefer the silver Robocop suit to the black, Robocops supposed to be silver =P lolI'd say for those on the fence to check it out, I wouldn't call it a remake, but more of a re-imagining. Which in my opinion is a smarter move, since you don't feel like your trying to nitpick at the plot based on the original Robocop. Is it better than the originals?

In fact I waited in a huge line after reserving Robocop 2014 at my local county library. I figure it would not be that good so why rent it to see it right away. However I do find myself time to time surprised by watching a movie that is much better than I expected and this Robocop is one of those movies.Spoiler alert.  To its credit it does not try to replace the original as it is really a different movie. Yet it is Robocop. Like the original it is not a kids movie and the story line is even a little darker than the original. While the original is bloodier and the reason for the R rating, do not be fooled there is plenty of gun play and action in this movie as well. One of my favorite surprises is Gary Oldman's performance as the kind doctor who must decide between right and wrong and keeping his job. He becomes ashamed with his choices and finely does the right thing. Gary Oldman had a reputation for playing bad guys but has done a great job of changing that image and he does that very well in this movie. However, the real bad guys in this movie are not the main force like they are in the original. In fact that is my only disappointment in this movie was how easy it was for Robocop to take down the one bad guy that is the drug lord. Michael Keaton is the other bad guy and you find yourself asking, was he really that bad? Did he deserve to die? You see that is what makes this movie different and good as well. The story in this movie has a much stronger human element as there is a much more human to this Robocop than the almost Robotic original.Can you take your kids to see this? Yes but the story might be a little over their head and remember like I said earlier there is lots of gun use. This is not a family movie and can be graphic but Robocop 2014 is a must see as long as you respect it as it's own movie. Highly recommended.",4,"Four and a half stars.

It wasnt just for cash,theres traces of genuine passion for the project. However...*It was in development hell for a few years. That should be a clue right there. The best passion projects are not handed over like a hot potato.*Its PG-13. yes..let that sink in. Remember the last ROBOCOP movie that was PG-13? Ok then. Seriously though,say what you want about ROBOCOP 2,at least they forged ahead in gruesome fashion while telling the story. They didnt care about Moms protesting toys in Happy Meals (for instance,Batman Returns). Verhoeven didnt care about the gore in the original. The goal was to show how brutal the streets were and how dire the city's circumstances were. Robocop's response's were almost a gleeful satire of how violence begats violence.*Lets not forget the best part of the film,its somewhat subtle allegory. Murphy is Christ,or more accurately a Christ-like figure. Hes put to death , resurrected and banishes the devil (Ronny Cox's Dick Jones) to hell. Or..(spoiler alert)...at least to the sidewalk below. Just to add to that,the revenge was much more palpable and human in the original. You HATED Clarence and his gang for what they did (despite actually really liking the characters for how rich they were. You dont usually get to know bad guys so well)its a simple shame that the machismo of the original was filtered for a glossy hollywood product. Not to mention that damn black robo ninja suit thing. With a focus of remakes,reboots and re-imaginings...were sure to see more favorites updated and ruined in the coming years. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy just ended in 2012,yet were revving up the next Batman project. Its bad enough that the genre most famous for retreading familiar ground,horror,has disgraced original classics like Halloween,Psycho,Black Christmas,The Fog,The Omen,A Nightmare On Elm Street etc. At least the new Friday The 13th and Prom Night were decent. The film industry is so desperate, they even are remaking films like Silent Night,Deadly Night and The Town That Dreaded Sundown.How many times will they try to reboot Jack Ryan,or the Hulk? SighPersonally id rather see Halloween part 9 than another awful installment of the reboot. No more remakes. Give me sequels,at least then i wont be disappointed if im..disappointed.

This updated version is based on same principle, but that is where the similarities end. This is a completely different movie. I had this in my cart and the price came down to 12.99, now it is double that. I had purchased elsewhere as the price was good, and Amazon did not have it ready to ship. Back to the review....In comparing the two movies, they have different story lines, and I can say that I enjoyed both. This movie explores robocop's humanity differently. Unlike the original, he is more human here and has all his memories from the beginning. His wife and son have a bigger role as well, although this does not, in my opinion, affect the overall movie. The villains are different, as are Robocops's motivations, here being to solve his attempts murder. The new version, like the original, have the omnicorp CEO as a protagonist , and there is a secondary villain, but not like Clarence was. The original was done in a more satirical manner, and seems comedy was purposely added, unlike the me version.To me these are totally different movies with totally different stories being told. Some have compared the social situations at the time the movies were made , and while both take place in Detroit, the setting could have been anywhere . There are certainly references to the political and world climate today, as with the original. There are also shuttle,references to the original , and found that refreshing, as it somewhat honors the first movie. As with the original, the ending most certainly leaves open room for more sequels and I would welcome them.This is not an academy award caliber movie, and made for profit of the studio, and for our enjoyment. I don't treat this like an epic, it is pure fun and enjoyment, and for that met my 5 star criteria. I enjoyed the original, and also gave that 5 stars. If I had to compare the two movies, I'd give the edge to the original, but that notwithstanding, feel,this new version is a 5 star on its own merits.",5,Amazon prices sure fluctuate wildly!

1690985,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00HNGZHDE,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","While it is fair to compare it to the 1987 original, each of them is able to stand on their own because they have different angles and way of approaching the core concepts. The story has stayed basically the same. Alex Murphy is a cop who is nearly killed, but is brought back as a human/cyborg hybrid. Whereas the original dealt with issues of corporate corruption in an over-the-top satirical way, this &#34;remix&#34; (as I'll call it) raises more philosophical and ethical questions than it does at trying to shock the viewer with graphic violence. Granted, there is violence, but it's mostly clean and tactical. Director Jose Padilha, famous in his native Brazil for ELITE SQUAD and its sequel, has dealt with issues like urban warfare before and he brings that sensibility to this film as well. This particular approach lends a sort-of authenticity and realism to what was presented a cartoonish (but still sophisticated) fashion in the original. Each of them have their strengths, and the advantage that this one has over the previous installments is this heightened reality which has become the fashion with today's action pictures, post-DARK KNIGHT. There are also vastly improved special effects. Still, the narrative has issues and these include a protracted third act which over-complicates things by trying to use misdirection as to who the real villains are. In the original, there is no question as to who the &#34;bad guys&#34; are intended to be. And while having things in black and white isn't necessarily a good thing, the way in which they reveal things through twists isn't handled as good as it could have been. Still, I got almost as much as enjoyment out of this new version as I did the old one, just for different reasons. Another area that definitely improved was the caliber of acting involved. Joel Kinnaman is serviceable as the title character, but it's Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton who stand out from the rest, as a scientist and the CEO of Omnicorp, respectively. Overall, I think this was a decent movie, and somewhat unfairly maligned by people who desperately cling to the past. Even if you hold the Verhoeven original close to your heart, it wouldn't hurt to give this a shot. And just as a side, there are nods to the original peppered throughout.",4,"My review of ""Robocop (2014)""",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,2288,"['fair', 'compare', '1987', 'original', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'have', 'different', 'angles', 'way', 'approaching', 'core', 'concepts', 'story', 'stayed', 'basically', 'same', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'cop', 'who', 'nearly', 'killed', 'brought', 'back', 'human/cyborg', 'hybrid', 'original', 'dealt', 'issues', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'over-the-top', 'satirical', 'way', '34', 'remix', '34', ""'ll"", 'call', 'more', 'philosophical', 'ethical', 'questions', 'trying', 'shock', 'viewer', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Granted', 'violence', 'mostly', 'clean', 'tactical', 'Director', 'Jose', 'Padilha', 'famous', 'native', 'Brazil', 'ELITE', 'SQUAD', 'sequel', 'dealt', 'issues', 'urban', 'warfare', 'sensibility', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'particular', 'approach', 'sort-of', 'authenticity', 'realism', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'cartoonish', 'still', 'sophisticated', 'fashion', 'original', 'have', 'strengths', 'advantage', 'one', 'previous', 'installments', 'heightened', 'reality', 'become', 'fashion', 'today', 'action', 'pictures', 'post-DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'are', 'also', 'vastly', 'improved', 'special', 'effects', 'Still', 'narrative', 'issues', 'include', 'protracted', 'third', 'act', 'over-complicates', 'things', 'trying', 'use', 'misdirection', 'who', 'real', 'villains', 'are', 'original', 'question', 'who', '34', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'having', 'things', 'black', 'white', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'way', 'reveal', 'things', 'twists', ""n't"", 'handled', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Still', 'got', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'new', 'version', 'did', 'old', 'one', 'just', 'different', 'reasons', 'area', 'definitely', 'improved', 'was', 'caliber', 'acting', 'involved', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'serviceable', 'title', 'character', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'who', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'scientist', 'CEO', 'Omnicorp', 'respectively', 'Overall', 'think', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'people', 'who', 'desperately', 'cling', 'past', 'Even', 'hold', 'Verhoeven', 'original', 'close', 'heart', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'give', 'shot', 'just', 'side', 'are', 'nods', 'original', 'peppered']",N/A
1690986,AY76Q07AI4MBW,B00HNGZHDE,Robert Wallace,"[2, 6]","I've seen the original Robocop, and while it hasn't aged well, it had some interesting ideas.  So I was interested in the prospect of the franchise getting a reboot.  Some people have expressed concern that this reboot wasn't full of R rated content.  This review is for those who aren't automatically turned off by the PG-13 rating.This movie -- like the original -- had a lot of potential and squandered most of it.  There are fantastically fun themes about robotics, somatic psychology, politics, crime, and other great things that science fiction loves to delve into -- but they're only surface thoughts.  A film with a better story might have gotten away with it, but at the core of this film is a generic crime procedural (boosted by some slick visuals).The film is also hindered severely by Samuel L. Jackson as a cable news pundit.  I read a few reviews before seeing this in theaters, and professional critics seemed to agree that this movie was ""serious.""  Perhaps, even TOO serious.  I have no clue what those critics were talking about, as this movie is a giggle-fest.  Sometimes intentional, sometimes not.  My wife walked out of the theater saying, ""I have no idea how they wanted me to feel at the end of that.""  This unsurety bleeds through to the movie's very essence -- its themes about technology and what it means to be human.  I'm fine with open-ended questions, I even prefer them, but this was a very muddled experience.The soundtrack was disappointingly lame too, but there were a lot of elements of this movie that worked: the cinematography, the special effects, Gary Oldman, Abbie Cornish, and much of the writing.I really wanted to like this movie.  Even as I was watching, I tried to enjoy it more than I did.  It's not a bad film, but I can't say it tops the original.  As a film on its own, it was underwhelming.If you're like me, and you have a compulsive need to see this movie, I'd recommend a watch.  But it's not worth a buy, unless you're a collector.

1690990,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00HNGZHDE,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","***1/2Paul Verhoeven&#8217;s &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; was one of the crown jewels of &#8216;80s action cinema, a cautionary tale about the role of technology in our society presented in the form of a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure tale made up of equal parts black comedy and social commentary. Since the movie&#8216;s release, technology has only become an ever more intrusive part of American life, so it would seem fitting for someone to mount a remake of &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; for the early 21st Century.Well, that reboot is here, in the form of a movie written by Joshua Zetumer and directed by Jose Padilha. There are many devotees of the original who will likely balk at this update, but I think it works pretty well, at least before it goes off the rails somewhat in the second half.The time is 2028. Technology has advanced to the point where policemen can essentially be replaced by giant robots capable of taking out the bad guys with minimal risk to human officers and innocent bystanders. Problem is many Americans remain skeptical about leaving such a task to mechanical instruments that feel no human emotion and thus might make the wrong, and potentially disastrous, calls at critical moments. Enter OmniCorp, a high-tech multinational corporation whose CEO (Michael Keaton) comes up with the plan to make such a robot out of an actual person, thereby combining the best of both worlds in a single entity. Alex Murphy, an undercover Detroit cop who has been severely wounded in the line of duty and hovers on the brink of death, is chosen from among many candidates to become the first human/robot hybrid in history. Voila, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you RoboCop.As with the original, &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; is concerned with far more than the average action movie shoot-&#8216;em-up. It explores the issue of just how far, as a society, we are willing to go in sacrificing our civil liberties in exchange for enhanced security. It also questions just how much of a person&#8217;s physical attributes can be replaced by technological ones before he or she ceases to be truly human. In the movie&#8217;s best scene, a newly-activated &#8220;mechanical&#8221; Alex learns just how little of his original body remains to him. It is a haunting and heartbreaking moment beautifully realized by both the special effects department and Joel Kinnaman (who made his mark in TV&#8217;s &#8220;The Killing&#8221;) who makes us actually care about the man in the machine. Without him, all the CGI in the world couldn&#8217;t have made the scene work this effectively.The movie also looks at how readily public opinion on controversial topics can be molded and shaped through carefully honed messages, much in the same way as products are marketed to easily manipulated and persuadable consumers.This &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; is definitely at its best in the first half, as Alex and those around him adjust to his new and unprecedented condition. Unfortunately, as with even the best action movies, the second half is less satisfying, as the plot tries to do too much for the time allotted to it and the story becomes muddled and confused as a result. For instance, a subplot involving corruption on the force is so poorly executed that it&#8216;s resolved almost before we know it&#8216;s going on.Kinnaman receives some excellent support from Gary Oldman, who portrays that rare movie scientist who isn&#8217;t either a madman or an evil genius but rather a compassionate man who really wants to do good in the world, even if the technology he&#8217;s using threatens to spiral out of his control from time to time.At times, &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; seems to be playing both sides of the fence on this issue of the role of technology in society. It clearly warns against allowing technology to override our humanity while at the same time seemingly endorsing Alex and the role that&#8217;s been thrust upon him by those with the wherewithal and capabilities to do so. And maybe it&#8217;s that very ambiguity - one that clearly reflects the world we all now live in - that makes &#8220;RoboCop&#8221; a movie with something of importance to say to our times.",3,Strong first half dominates over weak second,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,4169,"['***1/2Paul', 'Verhoeven', '8217', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'was', 'one', 'crown', 'jewels', '8216', '80s', 'action', 'cinema', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'role', 'technology', 'society', 'presented', 'form', 'rip-roaring', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'tale', 'made', 'equal', 'parts', 'black', 'comedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', '8216', 's', 'release', 'technology', 'only', 'become', 'ever', 'more', 'intrusive', 'part', 'American', 'life', 'would', 'seem', 'fitting', 'someone', 'mount', 'remake', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'early', '21st', 'Century.Well', 'reboot', 'here', 'form', 'movie', 'written', 'Joshua', 'Zetumer', 'directed', 'Jose', 'Padilha', 'are', 'many', 'devotees', 'original', 'who', 'will', 'likely', 'balk', 'update', 'think', 'pretty', 'well', 'least', 'rails', 'somewhat', 'second', 'half.The', 'time', '2028', 'Technology', 'advanced', 'point', 'where', 'policemen', 'can', 'essentially', 'be', 'replaced', 'giant', 'robots', 'capable', 'taking', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'minimal', 'risk', 'human', 'officers', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'Problem', 'many', 'Americans', 'remain', 'skeptical', 'leaving', 'such', 'task', 'mechanical', 'instruments', 'feel', 'human', 'emotion', 'thus', 'might', 'make', 'wrong', 'potentially', 'disastrous', 'critical', 'moments', 'Enter', 'OmniCorp', 'high-tech', 'multinational', 'corporation', 'CEO', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'up', 'plan', 'make', 'such', 'robot', 'actual', 'person', 'thereby', 'combining', 'best', 'worlds', 'single', 'entity', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'undercover', 'Detroit', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'severely', 'wounded', 'line', 'duty', 'hovers', 'brink', 'death', 'chosen', 'many', 'candidates', 'become', 'first', 'human/robot', 'hybrid', 'history', 'Voila', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'allow', 'present', 'RoboCop.As', 'original', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'concerned', 'far', 'more', 'average', 'action', 'movie', 'shoot-', '8216', 'em-up', 'issue', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'society', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'sacrificing', 'civil', 'liberties', 'exchange', 'enhanced', 'security', 'also', 'questions', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'person', '8217', 'physical', 'attributes', 'can', 'be', 'replaced', 'technological', 'ones', 'be', 'truly', 'human', 'movie', '8217', 'best', 'scene', 'newly-activated', '8220', 'mechanical', '8221', 'Alex', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'original', 'body', 'haunting', 'heartbreaking', 'moment', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'who', 'made', 'mark', 'TV', '8217', '8220', 'Killing', '8221', 'who', 'actually', 'care', 'man', 'machine', 'CGI', 'world', 'couldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'made', 'scene', 'work', 'effectively.The', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'readily', 'public', 'opinion', 'controversial', 'topics', 'can', 'be', 'molded', 'shaped', 'carefully', 'honed', 'messages', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'products', 'are', 'marketed', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'persuadable', 'consumers.This', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'definitely', 'best', 'first', 'half', 'Alex', 'adjust', 'new', 'unprecedented', 'condition', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'second', 'half', 'less', 'satisfying', 'plot', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'allotted', 'story', 'muddled', 'confused', 'result', 'instance', 'subplot', 'involving', 'corruption', 'force', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', '8216', 'resolved', 'almost', 'know', '8216', 'going', 'on.Kinnaman', 'excellent', 'support', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'rare', 'movie', 'scientist', 'who', 'isn', '8217', 'madman', 'evil', 'genius', 'rather', 'compassionate', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'even', 'technology', '8217', 'using', 'threatens', 'spiral', 'control', 'time', 'time.At', 'times', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'be', 'playing', 'sides', 'fence', 'issue', 'role', 'technology', 'society', 'clearly', 'allowing', 'technology', 'override', 'humanity', 'same', 'time', 'seemingly', 'endorsing', 'Alex', 'role', '8217', 'been', 'thrust', 'wherewithal', 'capabilities', 'do', 'so', 'maybe', '8217', 'very', 'ambiguity', 'one', 'clearly', 'world', 'now', 'live', '8220', 'RoboCop', '8221', 'movie', 'something', 'importance', 'say', 'times']",N/A

All that keeps him alive is technology and the machinations of a sinister corporation that created it: OCP.&#8220;I thought we agreed on total body prosthesis, now lose the arm okay!&#8221;I&#8217;m going to cut to the chase and say what&#8217;s on the minds of many &#8211; yes the reboot doesn&#8217;t live up to the original.  I hated the &#8216;80&#8217;s but 25 years of CGI has yet to give Hollywood a remake or sequel that actually succeeds the originals of that horrid, big-haired era.  The original movie was funny, daring and subversive.  The minds behind this movie are witless, shy of risk and conformist.  The original movie was a prescient attack on the 24 hours news cycle and the dumbing down of media-dependent Americans.  The new movie posits a police-friendly, right-wing America that gets its sense of right and wrong from a demagogic TV host played Samuel Jackson.  (&#8220;Pat Novak&#8221; suggests a mix of conservative media pundits Pat Buchanan and Bob Novak, but the character is so cardboard thin and dependent on Jackson&#8217;s delivery, it&#8217;s hard to believe any imagination went into his script.)  The script tries so hard to capture the NPR crowd that it opens with a liberal&#8217;s wet dream: in the near future, an imperialist America pacifies the world with robot soldiers, forcing conquered enemies into a humiliating submission.  The only problem is that Americans won&#8217;t stand for having their own streets policed by the same robot enforcers they&#8217;ve propagated in places like Tehran.  As a loophole they replace a fully-mechanical robot with a cyborg.  You know what they forgot?  A story.&#8220;Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law.&#8221;The original movie had cartoonish but unforgettable characters populating a terminally crime-ridden city that only a cyborg would fight for.  The joke of the story was that Robo actually bothered to fight crime in a city built on crime, ironically making the introduction of mechanical police a natural development.  The new movie doesn&#8217;t bother with that route &#8211; the corporation that creates Robocop turns to half-human cyborgs when the law blocks America as a market for their robots.  Unfortunately, the new idea didn&#8217;t come with anything for Robo to do other than hosing down other criminals.  There&#8217;s some intrigue regarding dirty cops and also OCP (unfortunately no intrigue BETWEEN those 2 groups) but the story simply machine-guns past obstacles, unlike the first movie which found nifty and entertaining ways to navigate them.  After the movie has gone through much of its running time, it realizes that for a movie about cops it needs a real villain.  For a movie about robotic cops, &#8220;Robocop&#8221;&#8217;s villains are similarly synthetic.  Like the poor exec accidentally hosed down by ED-209 in the first movie, OCP&#8217;s officers pick up the gun&#8230;because somebody had to.&#8220;Dick, I&#8217;m very disappointed!&#8221;For a movie about nothing in particular, &#8220;Robocop&#8221; squanders some real talent.

The last thing I want to see is a PG movie and I think a lot of adults would agree with me.  There is something about R rated movies. When creating a movie like this you need real eye catching adult scenes.  Not scenes that you have to imagine what happened.  A PG movie is a h-ll of a lot easier to make than an R because an R rated movie you have to show it all and it cost a lot more money. Are adults not worth the investment.  Again- we are the one's footing the bill for the little monkeys to go to the flicks in the first place.  Better think twice next time you take a great movie and turn it into a kiddie flick.  Leave that to lame DISNEY who rather than pay real actors create crappy china characters for Americans to glee over.  LAME-O-RAMA!!! SO CHINA 1990.

1690995,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B00HNGZHDE,R. Sardrena,"[3, 4]","The original Robocop (1986) was a strange stew of extreme graphic violence, razor wit about the sad state of American society, and pathos.  Director Paul Verhoeven and the Robocop writers tried to revisit that formula with Starship Troopers (1999), but even they couldn't recapture the magic.  The 2014 remake is a fairly-thoughtful criticism of drone warfare and the loss of privacy, but it lacks the savage humor and insight of the original film.There are some predictable carry-overs from the original: yes, TV/Web news is mocked again, and (thankfully) Basil Palidouris' original score from '86 is slipped into the opening of the remake... but it's just not enough.  Unlike the mock-media from the original (and recent fare like ""The Jon Stewart Show"" and ""The Colbert Report""), this faux-news is neither funny nor clever.  Samuel L. Jackson simply gives his typical bombastic shtick, glowering at the camera.  After the opening riff, the new music isn't very effective; during a combat-simulation scene it lapses into the form of some music pulled from a long-gone video game.Some viewers have said that this remake ""lacks real villains.""  Actually, it has quite a few.  Michael Keaton plays the main heavy, the smooth-talking CEO Raymond Sellars, but neither he nor his minions generate much excitement.  There certainly are no modern counterparts to the original's vicious Dick Jones or Clarence Boddecker.At times, the earnest writers seem too ill-informed (or dumb) to handle their material well.  Like many people, they confuse robots with drones.  They actually seem to make a case for the villains by making their robots exponentially more effective than modern drones ever were.  They've crafted embarrassing dialogue-clunkers too; the kindly cyberneticist played by Gary Oldman occasionally says ""scientifically,"" or ""scientifically-speaking"" before delivering his worst howlers.  The all-American protagonist, Alec Murphy, drops U.K.isms like ""bracelets"" instead of the American ""handcuffs.""  An American general lets slip a few Canadian ""oots"" too, eh?  A mega-million dollar film should have cleaned up those flaws easily.The pathos that the original achieved seamlessly through a combination of music and flashbacks as Robocop walked through his deserted house can't be matched here either.  The modern Murphy radiates a kind of macho-jerk vibe - especially with his family - that his predecessor never had.  His character and performance are quite believable - just not likeable.  Mrs. Murphy has a prominent part in the remake, but the actress is too pretty and lightweight to carry her part.All in all, the remake deserves one viewing... after which you'll wonder where you put your copy of the original.",3,"Nice Try, But...",1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2725,"['original', 'Robocop', '1986', 'was', 'strange', 'stew', 'extreme', 'graphic', 'violence', 'razor', 'wit', 'sad', 'state', 'American', 'society', 'pathos', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'Robocop', 'writers', 'tried', 'revisit', 'formula', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '1999', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'recapture', 'magic', '2014', 'remake', 'fairly-thoughtful', 'criticism', 'drone', 'warfare', 'loss', 'privacy', 'savage', 'humor', 'insight', 'original', 'film.There', 'are', 'predictable', 'carry-overs', 'original', 'yes', 'TV/Web', 'news', 'mocked', 'again', 'thankfully', 'Basil', 'Palidouris', 'original', 'score', ""'86"", 'slipped', 'opening', 'remake', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'mock-media', 'original', 'recent', 'fare', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'Show', 'Colbert', 'Report', 'faux-news', 'funny', 'clever', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'simply', 'typical', 'bombastic', 'shtick', 'glowering', 'camera', 'opening', 'riff', 'new', 'music', ""n't"", 'very', 'effective', 'combat-simulation', 'scene', 'form', 'music', 'pulled', 'long-gone', 'video', 'game.Some', 'viewers', 'have', 'said', 'remake', 'lacks', 'real', 'villains', 'Actually', 'quite', 'few', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'main', 'heavy', 'smooth-talking', 'CEO', 'Raymond', 'Sellars', 'minions', 'generate', 'much', 'excitement', 'certainly', 'are', 'modern', 'counterparts', 'original', 'vicious', 'Dick', 'Jones', 'Clarence', 'Boddecker.At', 'times', 'earnest', 'writers', 'seem', 'too', 'ill-informed', 'dumb', 'handle', 'material', 'well', 'many', 'people', 'confuse', 'robots', 'drones', 'actually', 'seem', 'make', 'case', 'villains', 'making', 'robots', 'exponentially', 'more', 'effective', 'modern', 'drones', 'ever', 'were', ""'ve"", 'crafted', 'embarrassing', 'dialogue-clunkers', 'too', 'kindly', 'cyberneticist', 'played', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'occasionally', 'scientifically', 'scientifically-speaking', 'delivering', 'worst', 'howlers', 'all-American', 'protagonist', 'Alec', 'Murphy', 'U.K.isms', 'bracelets', 'instead', 'American', 'handcuffs', 'American', 'general', 'lets', 'slip', 'few', 'Canadian', 'oots', 'too', 'eh', 'mega-million', 'dollar', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'cleaned', 'up', 'flaws', 'easily.The', 'pathos', 'original', 'achieved', 'seamlessly', 'combination', 'music', 'flashbacks', 'Robocop', 'walked', 'deserted', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'matched', 'here', 'either', 'modern', 'Murphy', 'kind', 'macho-jerk', 'vibe', 'especially', 'family', 'predecessor', 'never', 'had', 'character', 'performance', 'are', 'quite', 'believable', 'just', 'not', 'likeable', 'Mrs.', 'Murphy', 'prominent', 'part', 'remake', 'actress', 'too', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'carry', 'part.All', 'remake', 'one', 'viewing', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'where', 'put', 'copy', 'original']",N/A

It focuses much more on the human angle. It's got the same premise as the original, but instead of focusing on how the robot is affected by the brain, it's about the human trying to break out of the programming. Some pretty good action scenes but the major part of the movie is Alex Murphy, the cop inside the machine. It's not a bad story, mind you. The journey is well made and interesting, but it's not expected by those who enjoyed the original. Did away with a lot of the blood and gore of the original, which is a good thing IMO.

Thus, I thought this one would be worse. But they did a good job of sticking to the story without the over-the-top characters that made the original unbearable at times.Granted, those who love violent movies don't watch this type of film for its cinematic touches and character development, but for it's genre, it's a closer-to-sane treatment than the Robocop of the 80's.Bolstered by the casting of Gary Oldman, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Kinnamann as the main character Alex Murphy/Robocop, we are asked to believe in a world similar to the one in which we exist today thatisn't too far off in the future.Even for a violent movie, it wasn't gratuitous in that respect. Instead, I felt it was a plot- and character-driven movie with graphic (yet, tempered) violence. The special effects were top-notch and thestunts weren't outrageously unbelievable. It wasn't perfect, I could pick it apart, but I am difficult to please entirely by Hollywood fare. But, it's certainly worth the rental.The remainder of this review contains spoilers.The only casting I didn't agree with was that of Michael Keaton. I can see how others would say he was perfect for the role with his brand of physical gesturing, but I felt he was too light for the role.Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for his parody of Bill O'Reilly with a touch of balance. He didn't come off sounding too left or too right. And if anyone can turn a smart-bleeped remark and make it sound likeit, Sam is the man.Jennifer Ehle delivered a solid characterization of Keaton's right-hand woman with a cold, unfeeling embodiment of efficiency. Almost a robot herself.Gary Oldman is always dependable (which may be a detriment in a weird sort of way) as the scientist who brings Murphy back to life and struggles with the moral balance of keeping his job, keeping himselfalive and keeping Robocop from being scrapped.Finally, Joel Kinnamann delivered his lines well but his role was lost in the balance of the development of the main characters.",4,Better than expected,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,2121,"['was', 'bit', 'biased', 'when', 'rented', 'remake', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'thought', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'barely', 'good', 'second', 'viewing', 'Thus', 'thought', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'worse', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'sticking', 'story', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'made', 'original', 'unbearable', 'times.Granted', 'who', 'love', 'violent', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'type', 'film', 'cinematic', 'touches', 'character', 'development', 'genre', 'closer-to-sane', 'treatment', 'Robocop', ""80's.Bolstered"", 'casting', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Joel', 'Kinnamann', 'main', 'character', 'Alex', 'Murphy/Robocop', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'world', 'similar', 'one', 'exist', 'today', 'thatis', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'off', 'future.Even', 'violent', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'respect', 'Instead', 'felt', 'was', 'plot-', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'graphic', 'yet', 'tempered', 'violence', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'top-notch', 'thestunts', 'were', ""n't"", 'outrageously', 'unbelievable', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'could', 'pick', 'apart', 'am', 'difficult', 'please', 'entirely', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental.The', 'remainder', 'review', 'spoilers.The', 'only', 'casting', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'was', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'others', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'brand', 'physical', 'gesturing', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'light', 'role.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'perfect', 'parody', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'touch', 'balance', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'sounding', 'too', 'left', 'too', 'right', 'anyone', 'can', 'turn', 'smart-bleeped', 'remark', 'make', 'sound', 'likeit', 'Sam', 'man.Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'delivered', 'solid', 'characterization', 'Keaton', 'right-hand', 'woman', 'cold', 'unfeeling', 'embodiment', 'efficiency', 'Almost', 'robot', 'herself.Gary', 'Oldman', 'always', 'dependable', 'may', 'be', 'detriment', 'weird', 'sort', 'way', 'scientist', 'who', 'Murphy', 'back', 'life', 'moral', 'balance', 'keeping', 'job', 'keeping', 'himselfalive', 'keeping', 'Robocop', 'being', 'scrapped.Finally', 'Joel', 'Kinnamann', 'delivered', 'lines', 'well', 'role', 'was', 'lost', 'balance', 'development', 'main', 'characters']",N/A

1691027,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00HNGZHDE,The People's Critic,"[4, 6]","The murder of Alex Murphy in Paul Verhoeven&#8217;s ultra-violent 1987 Robocop still ranks as one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen.  This time around, the studio handcuffed director Jose Padiha to a PG-13 rating in hopes of recouping the $120 million dollar budget even though Padiha and star, Joel Kinnaman fought for an R rating.  The result is a film with an entirely different tone that goes for a strong punch in the arm rather than the jugular.The premise is mostly the same as the original.  Set in a dystopian Detroit in the year 2028, Alex Murphy (Kinnaman) and his partner Jack (Michael K. Williams) get too close to drug kingpin Antoine Vallon&#8217;s (Patrick Garrow) operation.  After a car bomb detonates, Murphy is critically injured giving mega-corporation OmniCorp a chance to unveil its capacity to create a part man, part machine police officer.  OmniCorp has had success with similar ambitions by planting robotic &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; in military hot-zones throughout the world.  These giant, armed intimidation machines wander the streets bellowing phrases like &#8220;May peace be upon you&#8221; as they continuously scan the area for threats.US citizens are happy to have these things keeping peace in other parts of the world, but they have not warmed up to the idea of having them within their own boarders.  With much hesitation, Murphy&#8217;s wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish) agrees to allow OmniCorp to go ahead with their plans to use Murphy as a way to sway public opinion towards a robotic police force.&#8220;Dead or alive, you&#8217;re coming with me.&#8221;  Screenwriter Joshua Zetumer takes these words to heart by writing a screenplay that has too many ambitions but still manages to take the audience for a ride.  While the original film had two feet firmly planted in satire, this sci-fi, action, satire, political drama, morality play, crime story doesn&#8217;t quite know what it is.  Regardless, it has sufficient doses of each of those to summon enough enjoyment for the movie to come across as surprisingly fun.The film also looks very good and it&#8217;s a credit to director Jose Padiha since his heightened budget is certainly on full display.  While occasionally delving into video game style action, most of the &#8220;futuristic&#8221; touches are done with seamless realism that do not force the audience to zone out.  This has been the case with too many action films of recent years, most notably, another 80&#8217;s retread (and coincidentally also a February release) A Good Day to Die Hard from last year.  Another credit to Padiha is that this film is far better acted than it has any right to be.  Kinnaman is a great Robocop and supporting roles from Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Jackie Earle Haley are strong, energetic, and believable.  However, the most surprising and enjoyable performance comes from Samuel L. Jackson channeling Bill O&#8217;Reilly as reality news anchor and personality, Pat Novak.  Novak spews absurdly biased opinions on his show, The Novak Element, and Jackson sinks his teeth in and does not let go.

I am tired of all the remakes lately but I was kind of looking forward to watching this. It started off OK but quickly lost interest. The movie combines the plots of the original 2 movies which makes for a jumbled movie. The most interesting part of the original was watching him try and solve his own murder. This one focuses on his attitude and feeling toward being in the suit and how they get him to go with it. The action seems secondary. When Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman are on screen the movie is interesting and makes you want to watch. When they aren't though the movie slows to a crawl and makes it feel well over 2 hours.

1691034,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00HNGZHDE,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[67, 84]","Note: I will eventually update and replace this review when I acquire the Blu-ray.Had a chance to go see this the other day after a fresher, more recent viewing of the remastered original on Blu-ray (my first time seeing that one since I was a kid). And I have to say I was pretty surprised by how much I liked this remake. When I first saw the trailer, I honestly thought it would turn out to be some kind of shallow action movie that would only be hindered by its PG-13 rating. But what I got was a very well-written film with sleek production values, a good dose of action, and a lot of soul in the story.For those who might've been stuck under the proverbial ""movie rock"" and don't know the basic premise of RoboCop, the story follows Detroit police officer (or detective, in this remake) Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) who is so badly injured in the line of duty, that his body is donated and remade into a prototype police cyborg by the conglomerate company, OmniCorp. In becoming cyberized, the contrasting entities of both man and machine are causing Murphy to question his directives and values as both the person he was and the product he has become. But as with any corporation, there's more to this ""product"" than meets the eye.Firstly, I have to say that as much as I liked the original movie growing up, after seeing it again, it shows its age. It's an '80s movie and feels every bit like one, mostly in the dialogue and characterizations, but especially the effects. And I still do like it a lot, but probably not as much. As a whole, I see it as an action movie with subtle hints of moral/ethical quandaries about the treatment of human test subjects and as an allegory to corporate corruption for the sake of profit. I get that. I like it. And it feels very ambitious for a movie in '87. But after watching the movie I saw yesterday, it was like a complete 180-flip on the story emphasis. Instead of being an action flick with hints of story, I'm delighted to say it was a very human story with hints of action.The new RoboCop essentially takes everything the original didn't overtly talk about and puts it in the open. It spends less time showing the ingenuity of the technology itself and, in my opinion, tells a much more humanizing story for the moral/ethical issues that only had its surface scratched in the original. You can see this pretty easily from the moment Murphy wakes up in his new form and as the film progresses with OmniCorp gradually trying to make him more and more of a machine. Whereas the original had him wake up as a machine that gradually became more human.Also much more pronounced in this remake is the allegory of the all-powerful corporate conglomerate superpower. Instead of being a widely-known American brand, a la the the original, they upped the ante, here, by having OmniCorp also dipping into the military scene. For video game fans, I saw this is as basically being a reference to the Metal Gear universe and the concept of PMCs (Private Military Companies) and that the movie's aesthetic is a dead ringer for Metal Gear Rising (the film's opening scene, in particular, and the fact that the protagonist is a cyborg). Not sure if either are influences for one another, but it's a pretty damn cool coincidence.That being said, this new RoboCop is pretty entertaining. It re-invents the original concept very well and even manages to throw in some references and one-liners from the old '87 flick. The characterizations are much more fleshed-out, the story much more symbolic, the special effects obviously more updated, the action well-choreographed, and the cinematography is still surprisingly gritty, despite the movie being shot digitally. I know it's cheesy to make one-liner references in a movie review, but.. (grr..) I'd buy *that* for a dollar!If you're a fan of the original and are hesitant by the mere fact that this is a ""remake,"" please put aside any prejudice or stereotypes you think you know about remakes and give this one a chance.

However, the President and CEO of OmniCorp, Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) is convinced that the tide of public opinion and the votes of Congress will shift in the favor of repealing the bill if OmniCorp can somehow combine a man and a machine together.Enter police officer, Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman). Murphy is a good cop sick of some of the corruption he knows is going around him. He and his partner Jack (Michael K. Williams) have gained some intel on a local crime lord and try to bring him down. The attempted sting operation ends in a gunfight because of a mole in the police and Jack is severely wounded. Murphy escapes, but later a car bomb goes off and Murphy becomes mortally wounded and OmniCorp sees their big chance. Murphy's life is spared as he is transformed into a cyborg that becomes known as Robocop.Solely on a cinematic level without any association with the original entries of the RoboCop franchise, ROBOCOP isn't a bad movie. There are parts that are a bit slow and it takes a while for the action to pick up. Also, the final act of the movie, while the most exciting part of the picture, feels a bit rushed. There isn't enough buildup and action during the second part of the story.With that said, ROBOCOP is a reboot of a franchise and although it's a decent movie, it can't be talked about without discussing elements from the original movie. Although the original ROBOCOP became a hit, it was considered an ultraviolent movie when it was released. This violence (mostly tame by today's standards) was somewhat tempered by the themes and issues the movie raised: the decline of American manufacturing, the corruption of big business, and the search for a person's identity. Elements were over-the-top and purposely so; the original ROBOCOP was in many ways a comic book brought to life.Besides the overall plot, the ROBOCOP reboot shares some of the similar elements: particularly the search for identity and the corruption of big business. However, the world is a much different place than the world of the 1980s. Big business can still be corrupt, but in a different way (highly influential people still have contact with criminals, but the real criminals are the politicians they influence). The search for identity remains, but it is different. The 1980s RoboCop didn't know who he was, whereas the new version knows exactly who he is and where he came from (all of his memories are intact), but he has to deal with who and what he has now been transformed into. Like the original movie, media is all around, but it is the marketing that has changed.On a purely superficial level, the new ROBOCOP isn't as violent as the original. This is mostly because of studio interference. However, the less violence seems to augment the type of a movie it is: instead of an action shoot-em-up, the new ROBOCOP is more of an action-detective story.Overall, although the new ROBOCOP is a fairly entertaining movie. It does lack some of the visual gusto of the original movie, but it does share some of the same elements and themes as the original movie, although those issues are addressed in a much different way. In short, I'd buy that for a dollar.",4,Reinventing a Classic,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3946,"['remake', '1997', 'movie', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'ROBOCOP', 'set', 'year', '2028', 'United', 'States', 'remained', 'superpower', 'peace', 'world', 'affairs', 'largely', 'mechanized', 'armed', 'force', 'large', 'robots', 'machines', 'are', 'manufactured', 'Detroit', 'OmniCorp', 'However', 'people', 'seem', 'like', 'pacifying', 'effect', 'machines', 'have', 'overseas', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'home', 'part', 'law', 'enforcement', 'personnel', 'tv', 'commentarian', 'Pat', 'Novak', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'tv', 'show', 'Why', 'America', 'so', 'robophobic', 'answer', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'government', 'big', 'business.The', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'stages', 'passing', 'law', 'would', 'prohibit', 'machines', 'being', 'used', 'streets', 'sort', 'law', 'enforcement', 'However', 'President', 'CEO', 'OmniCorp', 'Raymond', 'Sellars', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'convinced', 'tide', 'public', 'opinion', 'votes', 'Congress', 'will', 'shift', 'favor', 'repealing', 'bill', 'OmniCorp', 'can', 'somehow', 'combine', 'man', 'machine', 'together.Enter', 'police', 'officer', 'Alex', 'Murphy', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'Murphy', 'good', 'cop', 'sick', 'corruption', 'going', 'partner', 'Jack', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'have', 'gained', 'intel', 'local', 'crime', 'lord', 'try', 'bring', 'down', 'attempted', 'sting', 'operation', 'gunfight', 'mole', 'police', 'Jack', 'severely', 'wounded', 'Murphy', 'later', 'car', 'bomb', 'off', 'Murphy', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'OmniCorp', 'big', 'chance', 'Murphy', 'life', 'spared', 'transformed', 'cyborg', 'known', 'Robocop.Solely', 'cinematic', 'level', 'association', 'original', 'entries', 'RoboCop', 'franchise', 'ROBOCOP', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'while', 'action', 'pick', 'up', 'Also', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'picture', 'bit', 'rushed', ""n't"", 'enough', 'buildup', 'action', 'second', 'part', 'story.With', 'said', 'ROBOCOP', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'decent', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'talked', 'discussing', 'elements', 'original', 'movie', 'original', 'ROBOCOP', 'became', 'hit', 'was', 'considered', 'ultraviolent', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'violence', 'mostly', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'somewhat', 'tempered', 'themes', 'issues', 'movie', 'raised', 'decline', 'American', 'manufacturing', 'corruption', 'big', 'business', 'search', 'person', 'identity', 'Elements', 'were', 'over-the-top', 'purposely', 'so', 'original', 'ROBOCOP', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'comic', 'book', 'brought', 'life.Besides', 'overall', 'plot', 'ROBOCOP', 'reboot', 'shares', 'similar', 'elements', 'particularly', 'search', 'identity', 'corruption', 'big', 'business', 'However', 'world', 'much', 'different', 'place', 'world', '1980s', 'Big', 'business', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'corrupt', 'different', 'way', 'highly', 'influential', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'contact', 'criminals', 'real', 'criminals', 'are', 'politicians', 'influence', 'search', 'identity', 'different', '1980s', 'RoboCop', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'new', 'version', 'exactly', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'memories', 'are', 'intact', 'deal', 'who', 'what', 'now', 'been', 'transformed', 'original', 'movie', 'media', 'around', 'marketing', 'changed.On', 'purely', 'superficial', 'level', 'new', 'ROBOCOP', ""n't"", 'as', 'violent', 'original', 'mostly', 'studio', 'interference', 'However', 'less', 'violence', 'augment', 'type', 'movie', 'instead', 'action', 'shoot-em-up', 'new', 'ROBOCOP', 'more', 'action-detective', 'story.Overall', 'new', 'ROBOCOP', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'lack', 'visual', 'gusto', 'original', 'movie', 'share', 'same', 'elements', 'themes', 'original', 'movie', 'issues', 'are', 'addressed', 'much', 'different', 'way', 'short', ""'d"", 'buy', 'dollar']",N/A

In fact, the story is better in many ways.The effects are incredible and fun to watch.  The statements this movie makes indirectly about America's current foreign affairs are worth thinking about--kind of scary, actually.  With the advent of drones, how far are we from humanoid robots?The action is fun, well-done.  The transformation of Murphy is heart-wrenching and more realistic than the first film.  I really enjoyed much of this movie.  The writers were very creative in explaining how Murphy is put together, enhanced, controlled, etc.  It makes Murphy's human element more poignant when it has to override the robotics.So what's wrong with Robocop?1) The soundtrack is horrible.  It is distracting and corny.  It ruins some of the action scenes.  You have awesome action accompanied by CORNY LOUD music.  It feels like you are trying to watch a cool movie while your neighbors are blasting videogame tunes.2) The acting is uneven.  I'm sorry, but this lead was not ready to handle a role as important to Americans as Alex Murphy.  He is robotic before he even gets a new body!3) Sam Jackson.  Why the heck is he even in this film?  He represents a corrupt, corporate media--like the media we are stuck with right now in America.  Ok, I get it.  But he yells the news and annoys movie-goers like some maniacal Bill O'Reilly--without having any interesting or useful connection to the main storyline.4) The ending is bad.  Or should I say, BOTH endings are bad.  There is a quiet, rushed ending with Alex Murphy--during which he smiles like a stuffed panda.  Then there is the final ending in which Sam Jackson rants at us until the screen blacks out.This movie will have you teetering back and forth between genuine interest and eye-rolling nausea.DO NOT BUY.
