110160,A34VV92TSLC37R,0790742446,Adam Craig,"[2, 3]","It happens every time that a novel is turned into a mainstream film.  Fans of the book just go crazy if the screenplay and execution of the film aren't an exact replica of the written novel.  I've never made or written a film in my lifetime, but I am guessing that it would be tough to fit a 600 page book into a 2-hour film without taking some shortcuts.  Even I fall into this category sometimes, and I can understand that if you really loved a book, you would hate to see the film version turn out to be a complete horror-show.  But even I have come to realize that to enjoy the film version of a novel, you must go into the movie with absolutely no preconceived notions of what to expect.  Film and literature are just too different from each other to make a smooth transition.Having said that, almost everyone knows the plot of the book/movie.  Sherman McCoy and his mistress, Maria, are lost in the Bronx one night.  Avoiding details, Sherman and Maria get caught up in a sticky situation with a couple of youths, and in the scuffle, one of them gets hit by the car while Maria is driving.  This incident turns into a city-wide scandal.  Al Sharpton-inspired Reverend Bacon starts appealing to the black community.  District Attorney and mayorial candidate Weiss decides to use the incident for political advantage.  Journalist Peter Fallow sees an opportunity to remove his career from the gutter by having ""exclusive rights"" to the story.  From there, the story revolves around Sherman's battle with the courts, media, and community.The film's pacing is a little off at some points, but the acting ensemble pulls the film through all the moments that feel like they might be getting boring.  Morgan Freeman stands out in an unfortunately small role as the judge presiding over Sherman's case.  His speech at the end of the movie is one of the best acting moments in his career, in my opinion.  Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis don't exactly give the best performances of their career, but they do an adequate job of presenting the characters for what they are.  A lot of the fans of the book criticize the film because they think that the movie's characters aren't as selfish, greedy, and manipulative as they are in the book.  I simply believe that the filmmakers didn't think that the movie's humor would come across as much if the viewer was inclined to absolutely despise each and every character of interest.If you haven't read the novel, I would highly recommend this film to any movie fan.  It's funny, interesting, and has some very good social commentary along the way.  If you've read the book, however, stay away unless you have an open mind and an understanding of what the words ""film adaptation"" mean when you put them together...",4,Unjustly criticized by insane fans of the novel,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2746,"['time', 'novel', 'turned', 'mainstream', 'film', 'Fans', 'book', 'just', 'go', 'crazy', 'screenplay', 'execution', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'exact', 'replica', 'written', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'made', 'written', 'film', 'lifetime', 'am', 'guessing', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'fit', '600', 'page', 'book', '2-hour', 'film', 'taking', 'shortcuts', 'Even', 'fall', 'category', 'sometimes', 'can', 'understand', 'really', 'loved', 'book', 'would', 'hate', 'see', 'film', 'version', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'complete', 'horror-show', 'even', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'enjoy', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'must', 'go', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'expect', 'Film', 'literature', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'different', 'other', 'make', 'smooth', 'transition.Having', 'said', 'almost', 'everyone', 'plot', 'book/movie', 'Sherman', 'McCoy', 'mistress', 'Maria', 'are', 'lost', 'Bronx', 'one', 'night', 'Avoiding', 'details', 'Sherman', 'Maria', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'sticky', 'situation', 'couple', 'youths', 'scuffle', 'one', 'hit', 'car', 'Maria', 'driving', 'incident', 'city-wide', 'scandal', 'Al', 'Sharpton-inspired', 'Reverend', 'Bacon', 'appealing', 'black', 'community', 'District', 'Attorney', 'mayorial', 'candidate', 'Weiss', 'use', 'incident', 'political', 'advantage', 'Journalist', 'Peter', 'Fallow', 'opportunity', 'remove', 'career', 'gutter', 'having', 'exclusive', 'rights', 'story', 'there', 'story', 'Sherman', 'battle', 'courts', 'media', 'community.The', 'film', 'pacing', 'little', 'off', 'points', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'pulls', 'film', 'moments', 'feel', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'boring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'small', 'role', 'judge', 'presiding', 'Sherman', 'case', 'speech', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'moments', 'career', 'opinion', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'do', 'adequate', 'job', 'presenting', 'characters', 'what', 'are', 'lot', 'fans', 'book', 'criticize', 'film', 'think', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'selfish', 'greedy', 'manipulative', 'are', 'book', 'simply', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'humor', 'would', 'come', 'as', 'much', 'viewer', 'was', 'inclined', 'absolutely', 'despise', 'character', 'interest.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'movie', 'fan', 'funny', 'interesting', 'very', 'good', 'social', 'commentary', 'way', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'however', 'stay', 'away', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'understanding', 'what', 'words', 'film', 'adaptation', 'mean', 'when', 'put', 'together']",N/A

This shortfall in quality is by no means a reflection on the quality of acting or script but a glaring manifestation of the fact that it is next to impossible to communicate in cinematic form the details that a book can capture. The audience that has not read the book is likely to find the movie more engrossing but the overwhelming reaction is of less than fulfilled expectations.Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis play their parts with candor but their characterization does not attain glory because of the limitations implicit in the attempt to convert a masterpiece into a movie.  The protagonist of The Bonfire of the Vanities is a hero and a mere mortal and a villain in curious measures, a character so contrived that even an actor of Tom Hank's caliber fails to portray the complexity in an effective manner. Bruce Willis though has an easier task of enacting a drunkard, sometimes incompetent but finally lucky journalist and he plays his part with usual flair but no distinction.The script has been modified from the novel to provide an ending more becoming of a Hollywood production, with the hero not ending in the predicament where he found himself in the book. However while the novel had the readers dulled into realization of the death of the vanities, the movie lets the audience feel flattered by a Hollywood finish. The book's ending is too hard hitting, the movie's merely filmy.

And their problem was--they didn't like either the truth or the political incorrectness of this film.  I've lived in New York and the truth of the depiction in this movie rang all too true.  I was also shocked that any moviemaker would have the courage to present some of these truths, because they are blatantly politically incorrect.  I doubt whether such a movie could me made nowadays.  If it could, only the most independent of indies could make it.  So, if you want to enjoy what may be one of your last chances to see politically incorrect truths on film, this is it.Besides, it's a good movie.

Uh-uh, not true.  Before watching it this past weekend, I noticed that almost all of the reviewers who hated it had read the book first and were upset it was so different.  Well, I haven't read the book yet, and watched the movie this past weekend.  It was just great - a very witty comedy/drama/social commentary of the '80s, not unlike one of my other faves, ""Six Degrees of Separation"".  Melanie Griffith is the best one in this and yes, her southern accent does come and go, but maybe it was intentional - to show her character was a fake @$$ b!tch who couldn't even keep her accent going?  Also great to see Kim Cattrall, who has obviously had a boob job since this was made. Charming also is ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch""'s Beth Broderick.I'm going to explain my book/movie difference theory using my all-time favorite movie ""Valley of the Dolls"" (VOTD) as an example. Yes, I know it (and the book for that matter) is considered trash, but it still proves the point.  I saw the VOTD movie first and adored it instantly, so I then rushed out and read the book, which was SO different and had so many more subplots, additional characters, attributed different dialogue to different characters, etc.  However, this still ADDED to my movie-going experience by giving me ""bonus"" footage/scenes to enjoy and supplemet the movie.  Had I read the book FIRST, upon seeing the movie, I would've probably been disappointed because I already had preconceived expectations.  I think the same rule applies to ""Bonfire"".  It just isn't possible to get all of a full-length novel into a 2 hour movie and unfortunately they have to cast within the Hollywood system (who's hot, who's available, wtc.)...

110170,A313OU4NOWZDBY,0790742446,David R. Allen,"[3, 3]","""Bonfire Of The Vanities"" (1990) is a brilliant movie well directed with great acting and killer set decoration...and great music, too!Three Best Actor Academy Award winners have major roles in the movie (F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hanks, and Morgan Freeman) and all three give breathtaking actor performances.....anyone who cares for fine movie actor work cannot afford to miss this great movie.The direction by Brian DiPalma is brilliant, starting with the camera panorama sweeping across nighttime Manhattan from the top of the Chrysler Building with closeups of it's gargoyles, and ending with great elegant tuxedo and gowns for the ladies crowd scene of astonishing elegance and pomp made even greater by the background music (the music in this film is one of it's many great assets).DiPalma's used of ""fish eye"" lenses for closeups of three of the movie's lovable villains (the best movies always have lovable villains, at least the best comedies do) in the final courtroom scene is inspired.....Brian DiPalma is one of the great directors of the 20th century in USA major movies.The set decoration is especially notable.The late Lillian Gish (1893 - 1993, an iconic movie star who lived to her 100th year, was the star of D. W Griffiths's ""Birth Of A Nation"" 1915 classic and later, at age 94, the star of ""The Whales Of August"" 1987 along with Bette Davis) opined during an interview seen in the documentary she was part of about the history of USA silent era movies (titled ""Hollywood: The Silent Era"" 1980 written and directed by Kevin Brownlow) that:""The movies of the silent era during the 1920's 'age of motion picture palaces on Broadway NYC and elsewhere' taught people good manners, elegance and good taste....those movies did a world of good, socially.""People who want to see what good taste looks like, and how well mannered people trained and disciplined in good etiquette behave under pressure should see ""Bonfire Of The Vanities"" (1990) again and again and again.The set decorations tell the ""good taste"" story in wonderful (and expensive) detail, and the script showing well educated, well mannered people speaking up and speaking out tells the ""good taste"" story verbally.The irony is that this brilliant movie was widely accounted a failure by many associated with it.Academy Award Winner actor F. Murray Abraham gives a brilliant performance worth seeing over and over again....certainly one of his best ever in any movie he ever appeared in.

On one hand, it allows me to judge the film as exactly that - a film, with no other conflicting point of reference to cloud my opinions. On the other, it means I'm pretty much ignorant as to whether or not the screen version succeeds or fails in living up to its story's potential. 'The Bonfire Of The Vanities' is a good film: nothing more, nothing less. So why, then, was it so universally slated by critics at the time of its big screen release? The answer, it would seem, is the overwhelming popularity of the piece of literature it was based on, Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name.This movie is played on the borderline ""tragedy and comic"" the result, in my opinion, is a very interesting mix of ironic situations. Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is on top of his game and is the top dog in one of the top financial firms in the city. He has money in spades, a socialite wife, a Park Avenue apartment, a mistress and a very nice car. While out with that same mistress Maria (Griffith) in that same expensive car, Sherman takes a wrong turn and ends up in the Bronx where, in a moment of panic at being confronted by crowds of African Americans, Maria suddenly hits a black man and they drive off back to normal white society. Sadly for Sherman, this minor incident escalates when the boy goes into a coma and his car is identified as the one involved, Add to this a DA who desperately needs to win the ethnic vote by prosecuting a rich white person and a journalist who, desperate to get off skid row, talks up the story with a series of sensationalist headlines that twist the truth. As these factors all come into play, Sherman's tidy, rich, world starts to crumble.Griffith is great along with Tom even though he didn't win anything his performance is good. Bruce Willis is very funny as an alcoholic reporter who follows this New York scandal, I know we all like Bruce in action movies but he does well on this job. Morgan Freeman really catches your attention as an no-nonsense judge, seem suited to their roles. Really the plot in this movie is odd but watch it you see how it develops and relates to the lifestyles of the characters. I know that Brian DePalma has done better than this but remember many times a novel doesn't do well on the big screen. Again, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" was an '80s story based on a Tom Wolfe bestseller so don't blame Brian he done as good a job possible the cast had plenty of talent and that's why this movie is great and out of the ordinary.",4,De Palma doesn't do straight satire.,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,2601,"['Personally', 'watched', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'hand', 'judge', 'film', 'exactly', 'film', 'other', 'conflicting', 'point', 'reference', 'cloud', 'opinions', 'other', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'ignorant', 'not', 'screen', 'version', 'living', 'up', 'story', 'potential', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'good', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'So', 'why', 'then', 'was', 'so', 'universally', 'slated', 'critics', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'release', 'answer', 'would', 'seem', 'overwhelming', 'popularity', 'piece', 'literature', 'was', 'based', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'novel', 'same', 'name.This', 'movie', 'played', 'borderline', 'tragedy', 'comic', 'result', 'opinion', 'very', 'interesting', 'mix', 'ironic', 'situations', 'Sherman', 'McCoy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'top', 'game', 'top', 'dog', 'one', 'top', 'financial', 'firms', 'city', 'money', 'spades', 'socialite', 'wife', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'apartment', 'mistress', 'very', 'nice', 'car', 'out', 'same', 'mistress', 'Maria', 'Griffith', 'same', 'expensive', 'car', 'Sherman', 'wrong', 'turn', 'up', 'Bronx', 'where', 'moment', 'panic', 'being', 'confronted', 'crowds', 'African', 'Americans', 'Maria', 'suddenly', 'black', 'man', 'drive', 'off', 'back', 'normal', 'white', 'society', 'Sadly', 'Sherman', 'minor', 'incident', 'when', 'boy', 'coma', 'car', 'identified', 'one', 'involved', 'Add', 'DA', 'who', 'desperately', 'win', 'ethnic', 'vote', 'prosecuting', 'rich', 'white', 'person', 'journalist', 'who', 'desperate', 'get', 'off', 'skid', 'row', 'up', 'story', 'series', 'sensationalist', 'headlines', 'twist', 'truth', 'factors', 'come', 'play', 'Sherman', 'tidy', 'rich', 'world', 'crumble.Griffith', 'great', 'Tom', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'anything', 'performance', 'good', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'very', 'funny', 'alcoholic', 'reporter', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'scandal', 'know', 'like', 'Bruce', 'action', 'movies', 'well', 'job', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'really', 'attention', 'no-nonsense', 'judge', 'seem', 'suited', 'roles', 'Really', 'plot', 'movie', 'odd', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'lifestyles', 'characters', 'know', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'done', 'better', 'remember', 'many', 'times', 'novel', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Again', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'was', ""'80s"", 'story', 'based', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'bestseller', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Brian', 'done', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'possible', 'cast', 'had', 'plenty', 'talent', 'why', 'movie', 'great', 'ordinary']",N/A

I for one loved this funny, insightful film, and if there was any justice in the world, it would've won Brian DePalma a Best Director Oscar instead of being an albatross around his neck.  In case you hadn't noticed, critics are (being human) subject to peer pressure, so when this movie was released in 1990, they acted like a herd of lemmings, all agreeing that it wasn't faithful to Tom Wolfe's novel (as if they had all read it), that it was miscast, etc.  Well, I did read the novel, and in fact it is very faithful to the novel, though it improves on it in some ways (the final scene in court is much more satisfying in the movie than in the novel).  Aside from that, any movie has to take a few liberties with its source novel (Gone with the Wind eliminated dozens of minor characters and incidents that were in the book, for example).  As for miscasting, Hanks probably wasn't the ideal person to play wheeler-dealer Sherman McCoy, but he does well enough, and maybe his schoolboy vulnerability was needed for this character who would be easy to hate.  Melanie Griffith does fine as the rich, dopey, randy mistress Maria, though she could've used a little more coaching on her Southern accent.  The casting of Bruce Willis as the slimy writer Peter Fallow more than compensates for Hanks, as Willis perfectly captures Wolfe's presentation of this boozy, failed journalist who makes his name as a ""compassionate"" writer by giving the public the story if wants: heartless rich white guy McCoy injures a poor black kid from the South Bronx.The truth is, the critics hated this movie because it is so un-PC.  Journalists are depicted not as saintly do-gooders out to expose evil, but as selfish, lazy hacks who will gladly twist the facts to give readers a story they like.  A black preacher character who is obviously modeled on Al Sharpton must've caused critics to groan, as did several other black characters who are depicted in a bad light.  Rather than admit they hated the movie because it offended liberal sensibilities, critics claimed to base their distaste on the movie being unfaithful to the novel and to having some bad casting.Timing is everything.  This movie was released in 1990, a time when the public in general still had a lot of respect for journalists. Between then and now we've had years of talk radio and the Internet to teach us that journalists aren't nearly as objective and righteous as they appear.

As the director who got handed  this vast steaming pile of a script, Brian De Palma does everything in his  considerable power to keep himself and us amused, and you're grateful for  his efforts. But it doesn't amount to much. Even the opening tracking shot  works against the movie; it's there for its sheer De Palma-ness, and it  steals the movie's thunder.The leads were picked not because of their  rightness for the roles but because of star power. This isn't a movie, it's  a package. It might seem insane to cast Tom Hanks as Sherman McCoy, the  arrogant trader who accidentally runs over a black kid and sparks a media  war, but Hanks isn't actually all that bad. But Melanie Griffith (with her  now-you-hear-it, now-you-don't Southern accent) and Bruce Willis (playing  an alcoholic journalist who was British in the novel) are very much all  that bad. De Palma's idea of avoiding charges of racism is to turn everyone  into a cartoon regardless of race. Towards the end, when the judge played  by Morgan Freeman makes his big, insufferable brotherhood speech, De Palma  just seems to give up in disgust; he points the camera at Freeman and lets  him drone on and on.As was brilliantly reported in Julie Salomon's book  &quot;The Devil's Candy,&quot; the movie might as well have been pronounced  dead the moment Michael Cristofer was hired to perpetrate the screenplay.  Fortunately, most of the people involved went on to better things, so that  nobody really holds this movie against them anymore; released in late 1990,  it has come to be seen as the last gasp of shallow '80s commentary on  shallow '80s values.

Bruce Willis took a lot of heat for a supposedly poor performance, mainly because in the book, his character was supposed to be British.  Who cares whether his character is British or American?  His main job was to serve as a somewhat sporadic narrator, and he did that as well as anyone.Melanie Griffith gives an excellent performance as Maria, pushing right up to the edge without becoming a caricature.

The movie is a satire of course, a simultaneously embellished and understated account of New York racial politics.  Yet the inanity of its characters and situations lent the movie an air of bemused detachment.  There's no immediacy to any of the calamity that befalls the main character.  I'm left trying to root for him over his would-be oppressors, but I just can't really feel it.  Sherman McCoy is supposed to be a sort of wayward son character, yet Hanks portrayal of him comes off as plastic and insincere from beginning to end.  The two high points come in his heart to heart with his father, in which his father's sincerity is a piercing and heartbreaking gesture, and the judge's speech at the very end of the film.  The final scene in particular is a sermon, but a very worthwhile one, on the need for people to behave decently toward one another or risk eroding the foundations of civil society.  It's preachy, but since I agree with the moral of this story so much, it has a certain charm to it.  To be honest, if not for those two scenes this movie would have faired worse than 3 stars.In short, this film is interesting, sometimes even witty, but it's basic message is hampered by a strange sort of alien quality of the film.

110190,A3HGLP26MPOK92,0790742446,"R. A. Bean ""filmfanatical""","[17, 20]","Having read the novel by Tom Wolfe right before the movie came out, I tossed the da*n thing across the room when I finished the last page, for the ending was horrendous! There was no ending! It just stopped, leaving loose ends dangling everywhere, and the reader in a mess of mass confusion with no resolution of any kind. Don't get me wrong, there were parts of the novel that I adored, it was definetly a masterpiece of modern literature, no doubt! Especially the old, Jewish judge who should have been played by Ray Walston, or the guy that played the judge in the horrible ""Presumed Innocent"". The character of the judge was the funniest character in the story. However, I have come to accept Morgan Freeman in that role, for his version of The Judge ranks among his best, like that of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"". There are moments that he is extremely hilarious in a vicious way, to bringing the house down with his brilliantly acted ""speech scene"" at the film's climax.Now, about the film: This movie was killed by critics before it ever hit theaters. Things like ""Bad casting"", ""Not faithful to the novel"", etc, etc. kept popping up in article after article, and/or mentioned on talk shows before the film was even completed. So, you tell me who killed this film at the box office?! It sure as heck wasn't director Brian DePalma's fault! He served up a super satire that was very faithful to the book (except for the already mentioned judge character, and not detailing a lot of description about some of the character's backgrounds and/or motives, especially that of assistant DA Jed Krandall, perfectly played by comedic actor Saul Rubinec, who was last seen in a recurring role on tv's ""Frasier"" as Daphne's jilted fiance, and attorney -wonder where the idea for casting him as an attorney in a comedy came from???), and turning Peter Fallow from a Brit into an American, which I had no problem with what so ever. As a matter of fact, if you'll notice, that works perfectly since there are so many other British characters in the story, like Fallow's publishing boss, and especially the brilliant Beth Broderick as a bitter socialite whose Italian lover has been stolen away from her by the Devilshly femme fatale cunning b**ch Maria Ruskin, who is obviously a socialite wannabe phony, sleeping her way among the idle rich (think A.N.S.), whose accent is supposed to change back and forth  because she's such a phony person, who doesn't have any problem being a ""black widow"", or setting up Sherman for a crime he never committed, so wonderfully played by Melanie Griffith; her best work next to that of DePalma's 1984 classic thriller ""Body Double"" and Mike Nicholl's excellent 1987 film ""Working Girl"". And, DePalma gave it a very nice ending that wrapped everything up. (Not that I feel that every story has to tie itself up all neat and tidy, but this is one of those stories that needed that kind of closure.)And about the casting of Tom Hanks, well, I, too had my reservations about that since the only decent film he had made was Penny Marshall's ""Big"", which was still somewhat of a juvenile film, but still one that I love. This is THE film that started Tom Hanks onto the Award winning actor trail (and I'm so surprised, even all these years later, especially looking back on how his career evolved after this film that he didn't recieve better accolades for his performance), because the next roles Tom got offered, which I'm sure was due in large part to his awesome job in this film, were films like Jonathan Demme's ""Philadelphia"", Robert Szmeckis' ""Forrest Gump"", Speilberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"", and Frank Darabont's ""The Green Mile"", all GREAT films, roles that I don't think that he would have been offered had it not been for this film giving him the chance to showcase what a mature, talented actor that he really was and still is. His films before this were duds like ""The Burbs"", ""Bachelor Party"", ""Volunteers"", ""Turner & Hooch"", ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", and the godawful ""Dragnet"". And let's not forget Kim Catrall's performance of Sherman's socialite b**ch of a wife, who until then was among the ranks of Tom Hanks' earlier work (except her great work in John Carpenter's comic classic ""Big Trouble In Little China""), but went on from this to success in several great films and onto HBO's ""Sex And The City"". And a seven year old Kirsten Dunst who comes off like a modern day Shirley Temple in her scenes (she showed signs of her awesome talent for acting in this film), who went on to stealing the scenes in a lot of great movies, be it ""Interview With The Vampire"" or ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" (an AWESOME film!). And Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife) had a great small part in the awesome tracking shop openening of the film, purposely playing a nerve-shattering socialite who comes across as meek and stuttery, shy and jiterry, naive and unnerving all in a 5 minute scene. Plus, the opening steadicam shot and the unnerving feeling that's created is on purpose because DePalma is bringing us into a world of chaos that's just smoltering away, just like today's eroding communities.And the list of cameo's by ""top"" name people is endless: George Plimpton, comedic genius Alan King as Maria Ruskin's MUCH older husband, Arthur Ruskin, Geraldo Rivera (playing a fictional version of himself, which was dead on perfect since Rivera was the ultimate media sl*t - and I mean that in deep respect to Geraldo, for he in and of himself helped expose what trash the media can sink to - during the entire 1980's, as well as the '90's). And for Bruce Willis, well, it's a shame that a lot of people can't except him unless he's in a ""Die Hard"" movie, but has shown such extreme degree's to acting, whether it be on the TV or on The Big Screen, Willis has done some awesome acting, as in Terry Gilliam's brilliant ""12 Monkey's"", Rob Reiner's criminally bashed ""North"", and ""The Sixth Sense"". His interpretation of Peter Fallow is pitch perfect, looking like a modern day Cary Grant.As other reviewers on here who like this film and know the story, are so right, this film was killed by critics for political reasons. And, that's a da*n shame, for this is one of the funniest satires to ever come out of Hollywood, and also because DePalma has sworn that he'll never make another comedy because people don't get his sense of humor. And, for anyone who's seen ""Greetings"", ""Hi, Mom!"", ""The Wedding Party"", ""Phantom of the Paradise"", ""Home Movies"", or ""Wise Guys"" will also agree that that's just flat out tragic, for his comedies are side-splitting hilarious! As for the rest of the cast, everyone did an awesome job bringing such loathsome characters to life in celluloid.Everyone I knew back in 1990 agreed that this was an awesome movie, and they too had read the book. As for Tom Hanks' Sherman McCoy, I couldn't picture anyone else in this role. He offers the depth and pathos to make you feel for his plight as the man who's falsely accussed, whose life is shattered by one simple little accident and will never be the same again, a common theme often used in Hitchcock films. Another ploy often used in Hitchcock classics was to use star power instead of unknown actors. And, I think this ploy serves to benefit both directors for the films that they choose to use it for. This was definetly a film ahead of its time (remember the race riots in L.A. in 1995?), for it still stands out as a masterpiece of cinema even today. Even Kubrick's masterpiece ""The Shining"" didn't take such a beating for ""not being faithful to the source novel"", and I can't think of a better example of a film that stripped the source material down to the bare bones to be rebuilt into the classic it is today. And, ""The Shining"" was a far superior best selling novel than Tom Wolfe's one hit wonder ever was! So, again, it begs to question, why did critics, even before they even saw a single print of this masterpiece, decide to trash it, calling it a bomb BEFORE it was even released?!?!That has always puzzled me. Either way, it hurt the film's box office performance (which I was lucky enough to see it in the theater within the two weeks that it played, and I remember a huge audience roaring with laughter throughout the entire film). I was hoping that word of mouth would help people overcome the prejudices set by the critics, but that just never happened, at least during its theatrical run. Who knows, it may have actually been a box office hit, but the media won't ever allow that to be known; because anyone I've ever known and/or encountered that has seen the film all agree that it was great. But, either way, it's nice to see on amazon that it has gained a growing audience of viewers like myself over the years. Just think, Hitchcock's final film, the hilarious classic ""Family Plot"" flopped upon release, but is now concidered one of his best films ever. Hopefully time will be as kind to DePalma's adaptation of Wolfe's novel, which was just as great as his adaptations of ""Carrie"", ""The Fury"", ""Casualties Of War"", ""Carlito's Way"", and ""The Black Dahlia"".Either way, I will continue to enjoy it every time I get the chance, for I feel it ranks up there with some of the best comic classics ever made, along with Hitch's best classic comedies, like ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"", ""The Trouble With Harry"", and ""Family Plot"". And for those that do like the film, always think of Beth Broderick's character on that zerox machine, saying to Peter Fallow ""And when you find them, tell them this is from the tw*t that turned them in"" whenever you need a laugh. If you haven't seen it, then it's worth viewing for that scene alone.

110191,A4DTOO95QUGQT,0790742446,"Randall Brooks ""Author""","[1, 2]","From the very outset of his career, De Palma has been a 'starspinner' ever since he started making films. Everyone from Robert DeNiro, William Finley, Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt, Dennis Franz, Nancy Allen, and Amy Irving to John C. Reilly, John Leguizamo, and Kirsten Dunst has him to thank for discovering them; and that's just to name a small few!I just re-watched this again last night, and I must say it's even better now than it was last year when I last viewed it. It just keeps getting better, like a fine wine. Very well done, crafted, acted, written, directed. I highly recommend people give this another viewing! You will truly need to sit yourself back and glance at this cinema de 'misdisasterpiece' un classik again to TRULY find its funny bone, ha-ha! Seriously, there is a lot to be got from this, especially the 'ebony & ivory' theme.Having read the novel by Tom Wolfe right before the movie came out, I tossed the damn thing across the room when I finished the last page, for the ending was horrendous! There was no ending! It just stopped, leaving loose ends dangling everywhere, and the reader in a mess of mass confusion with no resolution of any kind. Don't get me wrong, there were parts of the novel that I adored, it was definitely a masterpiece of modern literature, no doubt! Especially the old, Jewish judge who should have been played by Ray Walston, or the guy that played the judge in the horrible ""Presumed Innocent"". The character of the judge was the funniest character in the story. However, I have come to accept Morgan Freeman in that role, for his version of The Judge ranks among his best, like that of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"". There are moments that he is extremely hilarious in a vicious way, to bringing the house down with his brilliantly acted ""Be decent"" speech scene at the film's climax.As for the book of this, I read some really cool reviews the other night (mainly the 2 and 3 star one's), and a LOT said basically the same thing I did about the book's horrible (non) ending. I have seen films from books come out a LOT worse (""Flowers In The Attic"" anyone???) and get treated a lot less aggressively; and, when you think about it, it was all for naught. Very little was changed. There was a LOT to cover in that book, and I think the film did it just fine. The only 3 bestsellers turned into film that took such a beating and being so viciously ravished upon adaptation: Stanley Kubrick's classic version of Stephen King's ""The Shining"", and Clint Eastwood's criminally bashed classic ""Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil"" based on the novel by John Berendt. All great films.""Gone With The Wind"" and/or ""The Wizard Of Oz"" never caused such a stir, and we all know there were MAJOR things changed in those when translated from book to screen.It's a good book, but the only reason I read it was because I read that De Palma was gonna be filming it, so I read it real quick, and the film came out about 2 weeks after I finished it. I need to read the book again whenever I get the chance. There were some great characters in it with names that were hilarious (I can't remember any off-hand) that didn't make it into the film, and I still struggle with the change made in the Judge's character (in the book he's an old Jewish man, and in the film he's Morgan Freeman), even though I have come to accept it over the years. And, as much as I like the ""Be decent"" speech, I do remember a LOT of people start groaning and moaning (and I was one of them). It just seemed SO corny and out of line with the rest of the film. But, after a couple of viewings, not only have I learned to accept it, I 'get' it, and actually like it now. The 'punch line' is after the Judge is done, and the crowd starts back into their 'mob mentality', letting us know they obviously missed the entire point of what he was trying to teach them. Very realistic, now that I think about it.Now, about the film: This movie was killed by critics before it ever hit theaters. Things like ""Bad casting"", ""Not faithful to the novel"", etc, etc. kept popping up in article after article, and/or mentioned on talk shows before the film was even completed. So, you tell me who killed this film at the box office?! It sure as heck wasn't director Brian De Palma's fault! He served up a super satire that was very faithful to the book (except for the already mentioned judge character, and not detailing a lot of description about some of the character's backgrounds and/or motives, especially that of assistant DA Jed Krandall, perfectly played by comedic actor Saul Rubinek, and turning Peter Fallow from a Brit into an American, which I had no problem with what-so-ever. As a matter of fact, if you'll notice, that works perfectly since there are so many other British characters in the story, like Fallow's publishing boss, and especially the brilliant Beth Broderick as a bitter socialite whose Italian lover has been stolen away from her by the Devilshly femme fatale cunning b**ch Maria Ruskin, who is obviously a socialite wannabe phony, sleeping her way among the idle rich, whose accent changes back and forth because she's such a phony person, who doesn't have any problem being a ""black widow"", or setting up Sherman for a crime he never committed, so wonderfully played by Melanie Griffith; her best work next to that of De Palma's 1984 classic thriller ""Body Double"" and Mike Nicholls' excellent 1987 film ""Working Girl"". And, De Palma gave it a very nice ending that wrapped everything up. (Not that I feel that every story has to tie itself up all neat and tidy, but this is one of those stories that needed that kind of closure.)And about the casting of Tom Hanks, well, I, too had my reservations about that since the only decent film he had made was Penny Marshall's ""Big"", which was still somewhat of a juvenile film, but still one that I love. This is THE film that started Tom Hanks onto the Award winning actor trail (and I'm so surprised, even all these years later, especially looking back on how his career evolved after this film that he didn't receive better accolades for his performance), because the next roles Tom got offered, which I'm sure was due in large part to his awesome job in this film, were films like Jonathan Demme's ""Philadelphia"", Robert Szmeckis' ""Forrest Gump"", Speilberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"", and Frank Darabont's ""The Green Mile"", all GREAT films, roles that I don't think that he would have been offered had it not been for this film giving him the chance to showcase what a mature, talented actor that he really was and still is. His films before this were duds like ""The Burbs"", ""Bachelor Party"", ""Volunteers"", ""Turner & Hooch"", ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", and the godawful ""Dragnet"".And let's not forget Kim Catrall's performance of Sherman's socialite b**ch of a wife, who until then was among the ranks of Tom Hanks' earlier work (except her great work in John Carpenter's comic classic ""Big Trouble In Little China""), but went on from this to success in several great films and onto HBO's ""Sex And The City"". I loved Kim Cattrall in this. I thought this was one her best roles ever: Mizzzz Judy (""Sherman, we're at a dinner party, a married couple standing together talking to each other in the middle of the room, you just don't do that, now mingle!"") McCoy. What an icy b**ch!And a seven year old Kirsten Dunst who comes off like a modern day Shirley Temple in her scenes as Sherman and Judy`s daughter Campbell, who went on to stealing the scenes in a lot of great movies, be it ""Interview With The Vampire"" or ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" (an AWESOME film!). Even at such a young age she showed signs of her awesome talent for acting in this film.And Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife) had a great small part in the awesome tracking shop opening of the film, purposely playing a nerve-shattering socialite who comes across as meek and stuttery, shy and jittery, naive and unnerving all in a 5 minute scene. Plus, the opening steadicam shot and the unnerving feeling that's created is on purpose because De Palma is bringing us into a world of chaos that's just smoltering away, just like today's eroding communities.And the list of cameo's by ""top"" name people is endless: George Plimpton, comedic genius Alan King as Maria Ruskin's MUCH older husband, Arthur Ruskin, Geraldo Rivera (playing a fictional version of himself, which was dead on perfect since Rivera was the ultimate media slut - and I mean that in deep respect to Geraldo, for he in and of himself helped expose what trash the media can sink to - during the entire 1980's, as well as the '90's). As for Geraldo, well, I found that, even though he's not an actor, he was PERFECT for his role in this. A TRUE media sl*t!And for Bruce Willis, well, it's a shame that a lot of people can't except him unless he's in a ""Die Hard"" movie, but has shown such extreme degree's to acting. Whether it be on the TV or on The Big Screen, Willis has done some awesome acting, as in Terry Gilliam's brilliant ""12 Monkey's"", Rob Reiner's criminally bashed ""North"", and ""The Sixth Sense"". His interpretation of Peter Fallow is pitch perfect, looking like a modern day Cary Grant.As other reviewers on here who like this film and know the story, are so right, this film was killed by critics for political reasons. And, that's a damn shame, for this is one of the funniest satires to ever come out of Hollywood, and also because De Palma has sworn that he'll never make another comedy because people don't get his sense of humor. And, for anyone who's seen ""Greetings"", ""Hi, Mom!"", ""The Wedding Party"", ""Get To Know Your Rabbit"", ""Phantom of the Paradise"", ""Home Movies"", or ""Wise Guys"" will also agree that that's just flat out tragic, for his comedies are side-splitting hilarious! As for the rest of the cast, everyone did an awesome job bringing such loathsome characters to life in celluloid.Everyone I knew back in 1990 agreed that this was an awesome movie, and they too had read the book. As for Tom Hanks' Sherman McCoy, I couldn't picture anyone else in this role. He offers the depth and pathos to make you feel for his plight as the man who's falsely accused, whose life is shattered by one simple little accident and will never be the same again, a common theme often used in Hitchcock films. Another ploy often used in Hitchcock classics was to use star power instead of unknown actors. And, I think this ploy serves to benefit both directors for the films that they choose to use it for.This was definitely a film ahead of its time (remember the race riots in L.A. in 1995?), for it still stands out as a masterpiece of cinema even today. Even Kubrick's masterpiece ""The Shining"" didn't take such a beating for ""not being faithful to the source novel"", and I can't think of a better example of a film that stripped the source material down to the bare bones to be rebuilt into the classic it is today. And, ""The Shining"" was a far superior best selling novel than Tom Wolfe's one hit wonder ever was!So, again, it begs to question, why did critics, even before they even saw a single print of this masterpiece, decide to trash it, calling it a bomb BEFORE it was even released?!?! Could it be because it was so daring? So `politically incorrect' at a time when half the world was crying for political correctness? Oh, did I forget to mention how politically incorrect this film is. THAT'S what got a lot of critics in a panty-wad! When this came out, PC was overtaking this country like a new plague, and here this was just spitting it in the face. I mean what other film came out at that time, or since, where a white character says ""We're in the jungle!"" when seeing black characters? Or, ""Natives!""??? Or, the Park Avenue dinner/opera scenes where the latest fads are a man with AIDS and Sherman's arrest.?.?.Could it be because of the way it so realistically portrayed the different social and racial classes in our society? The way it so effectively tackled the ego's and vanities of people, laying them wide open, exposing the very jugular of modern society's ugly ass greed and selfishness? (I believe the answer is ""Yes, Yes, Yes, and Yes"".)That has always puzzled me. Either way, it hurt the film's box office performance (which I was lucky enough to see it in the theater within the two weeks that it played, and I remember a huge audience roaring with laughter throughout the entire film). I was hoping that word of mouth would help people overcome the prejudices set by the critics, but that just never happened, at least during its theatrical run. Who knows, it may have actually been a box office hit, but the media won't ever allow that to be known; because anyone I've ever known and/or encountered that has seen the film all agree that it was great.But, either way, it's nice to see on Amazon that it has gained a growing audience of viewers like myself over the years. Just think, Hitchcock's final film, the hilarious classic ""Family Plot"" flopped upon release, but is now considered one of his best films ever. Hopefully time will be as kind to De Palma's adaptation of Wolfe's novel, which was just as great as his adaptations of ""Carrie"", ""The Fury"", ""Casualties Of War"", ""Carlito's Way"", and ""The Black Dahlia"".Either way, I will continue to enjoy it every time I get the chance, for I feel it ranks up there with some of the best comic classics ever made, along with Hitch's best classic comedies, like ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"", ""The Trouble With Harry"", and ""Family Plot""; or as comparable to Altman`s ""The Player"". And for those that do like the film, always think of Beth Broderick's character on that zerox machine, saying to Peter Fallow ""And when you find them, tell them this is from the tw*t that turned them in"" whenever you need a laugh. If you haven't seen it, then it's worth viewing for that scene alone. Just remember this is a satire, NOT slapstick.Thank you! :>)",5,De Palma's Smoltering Satire...,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,13993,"['very', 'outset', 'career', 'De', 'Palma', 'been',

I think Melanie Griffith is.  She is terrible, and her accent hurts the ears.  Bruce Willis isn't bad.  Saul Rubinek's Kramer is made to be a clown--as is Bacon (who comes across as a low rent Al Sharpeton).  Even if you don't compare it to the book, the movie is beyond bad. It only works if you enjoy set designs.  The narrative makes very little sense.  The tone is wrong. The story doesn't really fit together.  Morgan Freeman, as always rises above the matieral, but his climatic scene is so over the top it is funny.  The ending...well, don't even bother. The best moment of the film is Geraldo Rivera as Robert Corso, the slimy TV reporter...that is great. DePalma again demostrates his inability to understand his material.  The screenplay was even worse, but a good director can make do.  DePalma remains the most overrated director of our time...everything is overwrought, overcooked, and underdeveloped.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[12, 14]","The Bonfire Of The Vanities is an underrated gem directed by Brian DePalma (Scarface), and featuring an all-star cast including Academy Award winners Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump), Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby, Driving Miss Daisy), F Murray Abraham (Amadeus), and a supporting cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Melanie Griffith (Shining Through), and Kim Cattrall (Turk 182).The story depicts a decaying society infested with racism, greed, hypocrisy, and corruption. The particular society in focus here is New York City, where an incident that signifies a major clash between the white upper class and the black lower class becomes media dinner. Hanks plays Sherman McCoy, a wealthy businessman who cheats on his wife, played by Cattrall, with another rich man's wife Maria Ruskin, played by Griffith.On one of their nights on the town, McCoy and Ruskin find themselves in the slums of New York, where they are jumped by two black youths, and end up committing a hit and run as they run over one of the kids as they flee in McCoy's car. This goes straight to headline news. The African American community are not pleased, the mayor of the city, played hysterically by Abraham, wants to gain Black support by taking a rich 'white' turkey to court and reprimending him; in this case, the turkey is McCoy, a religious man who's only after money, and a drunken down-on-his-luck reporter Peter Fallow, played by Willis, who's hot on McCoy's tracks for this could be the story that will bring him to the top of his game, and in the longer run, make him a star of the moment.Everybody's in for a surprise, however, to find out that Ruskin was the one driving the car, not McCoy, but the entire city wants McCoy's neck anyways. McCoy, on the other hand, must play a dirty game to clear his name even if it means that he should break the law.The Bonfire Of the Vanities has no heroes. All the characters in the movie symbolize very dirty and corrupt people. The only voice of wisdom in the film is the judge, played by Freeman, hot off his Oscar nominated performance in Driving Miss Daisy, who gives a convincing speech at the end of the movie.Even though the movie flopped in 1990 when it was released and today is considered one of the worst films ever made, I find Bonfire a truly unappreciated social commentary take on a dysfunctional system with ordinary people working as organizers of the system. It's a bittersweet slice of American realism that many people tend to walk away from.RecommendedB",4,...a truly unappreciated social commentary take on a dysfunctional system,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2509,"['Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'underrated', 'gem', 'directed', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'Scarface', 'featuring', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Big', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Amadeus', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Shining', 'Through', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Turk', '182', '.The', 'story', 'decaying', 'society', 'infested', 'racism', 'greed', 'hypocrisy', 'corruption', 'particular', 'society', 'focus', 'here', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'incident', 'major', 'clash', 'white', 'upper', 'class', 'black', 'lower', 'class', 'media', 'dinner', 'Hanks', 'Sherman', 'McCoy', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'who', 'wife', 'played', 'Cattrall', 'rich', 'man', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Ruskin', 'played', 'Griffith.On', 'one', 'nights', 'town', 'McCoy', 'Ruskin', 'find', 'slums', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'are', 'jumped', 'two', 'black', 'youths', 'end', 'up', 'committing', 'hit', 'run', 'run', 'one', 'kids', 'flee', 'McCoy', 'car', 'straight', 'headline', 'news', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'mayor', 'city', 'played', 'hysterically', 'Abraham', 'gain', 'Black', 'support', 'taking', 'rich', ""'white"", 'turkey', 'court', 'reprimending', 'case', 'turkey', 'McCoy', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'money', 'drunken', 'down-on-his-luck', 'reporter', 'Peter', 'Fallow', 'played', 'Willis', 'who', 'hot', 'McCoy', 'tracks', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'will', 'bring', 'top', 'game', 'longer', 'run', 'make', 'star', 'moment.Everybody', 'surprise', 'however', 'find', 'out', 'Ruskin', 'was', 'one', 'driving', 'car', 'not', 'McCoy', 'entire', 'city', 'McCoy', 'neck', 'anyways', 'McCoy', 'other', 'hand', 'must', 'play', 'dirty', 'game', 'clear', 'name', 'even', 'should', 'break', 'law.The', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'heroes', 'characters', 'movie', 'symbolize', 'very', 'dirty', 'corrupt', 'people', 'only', 'voice', 'wisdom', 'film', 'judge', 'played', 'Freeman', 'hot', 'off', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'who', 'convincing', 'speech', 'end', 'movie.Even', 'movie', 'flopped', '1990', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'today', 'considered', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'find', 'Bonfire', 'truly', 'unappreciated', 'social', 'commentary', 'take', 'dysfunctional', 'system', 'ordinary', 'people', 'working', 'organizers', 'system', 'bittersweet', 'slice', 'American', 'realism', 'many', 'people', 'tend', 'walk', 'away', 'from.RecommendedB']",N/A

110199,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,0790742446,the masked reviewer,"[3, 3]","This is a really good movie!Brian De Palma's film version of THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES was savaged by the critics with a vitriol that still seems remarkable. Remarkable because it is one of De Palma's tamer movies, no doubt eviscerated for not living up to the same image critics held in their heads when they read Tom Wolfe's enormously popular novel three years earlier. The movie's nastiest pans came from journalists comparing it to the book--one called it a ""fascinating calamity"" and another, more frighteningly, commanded readers to ""destroy this film.""Watered-down as it may be, Bonfire of the Vanities politically and artistically is a challenge -- a visceral wake-up call to the mind and the senses. To watch De Palma lampoon the self-indulgence of the '80s, as Wolfe did much more straightforwardly in his book, is to be forced to confront a long list of off-kilter images and incongruous tones -- embodied here by the innately good-natured Tom Hanks's performance as Sherman McCoy, a slimy, adulterous investment banker; Melanie Griffith's gleefully absurd vixen mistress Maria Ruskin; and, most important of all, the sudden and jarring shift from farce to straight-faced moral declaration that is Morgan Freeman's masterful courtroom speech.""I don't do satire,"" De Palma reportedly said in an interview. And so it's true. De Palma prefers to wear his parody with a big, dumb grin--or with his fangs fully protracted. Tom Wolfe's novel was satire; the movie is broad comedy, playing up its characters' vices and follies to viciously cartoonish levels, rendering them more laughable than contemptible. This is why it was ultimately necessary that the movie's corporate sleaze bucket be played by Hanks, who up to that point had been tied to light comedies. And why, naturally, Melanie Griffith chose to make her character more daffy than sexy; likeable or detestable, De Palma's protagonists fumble at everything they do. And it's worth noting that both actors punctuate their billboard-size representations of greed, racism, and infidelity with some of the more gut-busting moments in movie history, such as when Griffith squeals at the ominous sight of two approaching black men in the Bronx, ""Oh my God, natives!""De Palma's characterizations may not have the subtle tongue-in-cheek wit of Tom Wolfe, but his version of the story is both more comic and angrier for it. His sinuous camerawork, (expertly captured by master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond), suggests a fiery examination of New York's racial and economic head-butts -- if critics were searching for the film's muscle, this is where it is. A glorious time-lapse shot opens the film, observing 24 hours in the city's vibrant goings-on from atop the Chrysler's building's high perch. On one hand ecstatically unifying all New Yorkers under one sky, the image is also strangely foreboding, as a peering eagle statue looking down on the landscape insinuates the precarious social imbalances that exist among different neighborhoods. Never since has there been such a brilliantly singular distillation of a city's cultural strife.For all its polish, Bonfire of the Vanities can become stunningly hot-tempered, a quality most journalists are too quick to ignore. A cutting sorrowfulness underlies slapstick humor that can quickly turn violent. When guests at a cocktail party condescend to his downfall, McCoy runs them out by blowing shotgun pellets into the ceiling. Here Hanks's point of view is the camera's, and so his character's frustration is the audience's, and that of every one of New York's underdogs, rich and poor, who struggle to find genuine human feeling within the city's partisan theatrics (signified here by a crooked Mayor, a savage media, and a pretentious intelligentsia, one of whom hysterically fawns over a gay poet by saying, ""He's on the shortlist for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS."").But not hopelessly, as Morgan Freeman articulates in his genius climactic speech -- absent from the novel -- playing the only good-natured character, a judge who presides over McCoy's case. With a gavel in his hand to symbolize De Palma's own measured plea for common sense, and approaching the camera directly as if to lecture the audience, Freeman turns various groups' self-righteousness back on them, exposing each one's duplicity and crying out for ""decency."" ""It's what your mother taught you,"" he explains, in a down-home vernacular that reverses, radically, the movie's giddy parody into earnest speechifying. It's still self-aware, of course, but the sentiment is meant sincerely.De Palma doesn't do straight satire, and as such his coda puts everything prior into a clarifying moral focus while simultaneously challenging the way we watch movies: In an unjust world, law is our ""feeble attempt"" to make things right.Bonfire of the Vanities is De Palma's.",5,LET'S SET THE RECORD
