It has to be the worst movie that has ever been made.  Why would anyone do this movie.  Are these actors that broke!  They would get more respect flipping burgers than being attached to this movie.  Lynn Whitfield?!!!!!! Clifton Powell?!!!!! Whoever directed this movie must have been blackmailing them to do it.

This utter dog of a movie isn't held back by the acting, it's the dreadful script, low budget & lackluster direction that really hold it back. Of course, it could have surmounted even these obstacles if it at least presented copious amounts of gratuitous T&A; as might be expected from the title, but regrettably, even that minor sop to the viewer was completely denied.Run, do not walk, RUN away from this pitiful waste of time & money! Free is too high a price to pay for this dog, because you'll never get back the time wasted on watching this cinematic excrement!& BTW, the ending not only doesn't make much sense, it sux on multiple levels. So you sit thru an excruciatingly bad flick hoping for a good wrapup, and are left staring at the screen when it's over, watching the credits wondering ""WHY? WHY WOULD ANYONE LET THEIR NAME BE ATTACHED TO THIS?""In short, I dislike this film intensely.
