1050210,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000MRA592,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[22, 27]","`Curse of the Flower' is a gorgeous masterpiece.  Filled with the uniform pageantry of The Tang Dynasty (A.D. 928), the layers of beauty are unfolded to reveal the household of the Emperor (Yun Fat) whose dramatic crisis is intimately revealed amidst the busy hive of his kingdom.  Treason, incest, and treachery against kin are concretely provided for a drama of Shakespearean proportions.  The queen (Empress) of the hive is ailing with what the Emperor believes to be anemia.  After ten years of ancient herbal medicine, she is no means closer to a cure.  More hemorrhaging is the rivalry amongst the two sons who spar for succession like Cain and Abel.  Jai (Jay Chou), the elder, appears like the humble, reluctant successor; while his bitter young rival, Wan (Liu Ye) has a sword to grind with his past and a manipulative lover who has no little influence over him.  The poor Emperor, revealed with no clothes, is wise to the point of tempering his judgment amongst poisonous ingratitude.  Heavy wears the crown for a man who resiliently defies the Shakespearean line, ""Death hath murdered sleep.""  Suspenseful, the plot lines head for a climax during the Chrysanthemum Festival for which the Empress intricately prepares.Stylish on every score, 'Curse of the Flower' could have been an overwrought melodrama with not enough substance, but story and d&eacute;cor only bring out the best of one another.  Never did I feel like this offering was tainted by trivialities.  I neglected this cinematic offering on the suspicion I was going to get an ancient and foreign offering of 'Kill Bill, No. 1' with tiresome martial arts scenes.  Judiciously, the dramatic and combat scenes are gorgeously choreographed and timed to meticulous precision without draining the attention span of the audience.  The battle scenes are innovative in a way reminiscent of , 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' except with more stunning results.  If nothing else, it contrasts new horizons of technical achievement that make 'Matrix' borrowing seem stale.Intense but expert acting and meticulous craftsmanship combine to make a magnificent epic adventure.

1050211,A20XFUO582WJZ3,B000MRA592,"A. Breitweg ""wuxia84""","[9, 19]","""The Curse of the Golden Flower"" while offering striking scenes of epic proportion akin to any multi-million dollar venture offers little more than conspicuous consumption. There are dramatic scenes illuminated in gold, flowers and such...seemingly like an olympic prelude. This movie lacks sufficient character development, such as Yimou's other ventures such as ""the road home,"" ""hero"" ""house of flying daggers"" ""raise the red lantern"" and ""to live."" Those movies captivating in both cinematography, character and emotion. It strikes a chord in the soul upon watching these films. However, I was highly disappointed in this venture because the characters were not drawn out. Gong Li's character, Chow Yun's character and such were not really full people that I cared about. Jay Chou's character is probably the most believable, however none of the plot seems to amount to much even with all the shimmering glam and low cut europeanized outfits the women wear. It does not appear to even be the Tang Dynasty, the culturally rich dynasty in Chinese history. The costuming, including the armor looks alien, appearing to be more Victorian era than Tang Dynasty and detracts from the film. Though it was effective in highlighting the extent of corruption, it fell so far short of Zhang Yimou's ability. I felt as if that hour and 45 minutes lay wasted before me in the strange decadence of the film. There is no particular dialoug or scene that sticks out in my conscious and I was not moved by any aspect of this vastly empty film. Maybe I expect to much from such a brilliant filmmaker and writer, but I cannot understand why such a film was even made, why so much money was wasted and why Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, Chow Yun Fat or Jay Chou would attach their names to such a waste of time.",1,The Curse sets in,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,1787,"['Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'offering', 'striking', 'scenes', 'epic', 'proportion', 'akin', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'venture', 'little', 'more', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'are', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'illuminated', 'gold', 'flowers', 'such', 'seemingly', 'olympic', 'prelude', 'movie', 'sufficient', 'character', 'development', 'such', 'Yimou', 'other', 'ventures', 'such', 'road', 'home', 'hero', 'house', 'flying', 'daggers', 'raise', 'red', 'lantern', 'live', 'movies', 'captivating', 'cinematography', 'character', 'emotion', 'chord', 'soul', 'watching', 'films', 'However', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'venture', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'Gong', 'Li', 'character', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'character', 'such', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'full', 'people', 'cared', 'about', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'character', 'probably', 'most', 'believable', 'however', 'none', 'plot', 'amount', 'much', 'even', 'shimmering', 'glam', 'low', 'cut', 'europeanized', 'women', 'wear', 'not', 'appear', 'even', 'be', 'Tang', 'Dynasty', 'culturally', 'rich', 'dynasty', 'Chinese', 'history', 'costuming', 'including', 'armor', 'alien', 'appearing', 'be', 'more', 'Victorian', 'era', 'Tang', 'Dynasty', 'detracts', 'film', 'was', 'effective', 'highlighting', 'extent', 'corruption', 'fell', 'so', 'far', 'short', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'ability', 'felt', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'lay', 'wasted', 'strange', 'decadence', 'film', 'particular', 'dialoug', 'scene', 'out', 'conscious', 'was', 'not', 'moved', 'aspect', 'vastly', 'empty', 'film', 'Maybe', 'expect', 'much', 'such', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'writer', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'was', 'wasted', 'why', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'would', 'attach', 'names', 'such', 'waste', 'time']",Curse of the Golden Flower

1050215,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000MRA592,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Truly one of the most beautiful films of 2006, `Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia' is a truly magnificent film indeed, with an inner beauty that transcends its glorious set pieces and costume design.  With tragic performances by the entire cast, not to mention the central beating heart that is Gong Li, as well as a heartbreaking story that includes deception, betrayal and murder, this Chinese epic is definitely a film you do not want to miss.Taking place during China's Tang dynasty, the film focuses on Empress Phoenix and her struggle with her husband, Emperor Ping.  Having bore him two sons, and raised his eldest from a previous marriage, it appears as if Emperor Ping has no further use for his wife and so he has her slowly poisoned with a black fungi that will gradually render her insane.  Once Phoenix uncovers her husbands dastardly plot she sets her own plan in motion to dethrone him and place the kingdom in the hands of her son, Prince Jai.  The Empress's relationship with the Emperor's son Crown Prince Wan may jeopardize her plans, as he turns on his stepmother in order to protect his father.But there is a twist, for the festival in honor of the Emperor's late wife may be in vain after all.The film also delves into the politics revolving around the Emperor's rule and the cruelty for which he safeguards his power.  His relationship with his own children is placed on edge as he forces them to cower to his every command.  The film fleshes out very well how the reign of his man was aided by his own ruthlessness and also exposes the lasting affects that it has on those acquainted with him.So, the film received an Oscar nomination for its costume design, but failed to garner any other major awards traction, which is sad because the film is astonishing from really every angle.  The set design and cinematography is flawless and should have also been rewarded with nominations, but more importantly, the film itself really should have been short listed alongside `Pan's Labyrinth' and `The Lives of Others' as one of the best foreign language films of the year.And then there is the brilliant performance given by Gong Li.  Now I know that this year was a really tough one for the Best Actress category, and I can't really complain because the Academy did nominate five very deserving leading ladies, but in my humble opinion Gong Li was better than them all.  As Empress Phoenix, Li truly had the toughest performance to sell for she had to make her characters every tick and quiver seem authentic and believable, especially as her poisoned condition worsened.  She also had to incorporate those ticks into her emotional response to her surroundings without allowing them to take over completely and she did so marvelously.  But her performance is so much more than just a slew of technical accomplishments, her performance is a very grounded emotional journey of a woman betrayed and scorned and determined to take what she is owed.Chow Yun-Fat is also brilliant as the evil Emperor Ping, delivering a very commanding performance, and Jay Chou and Ye Liu also deliver nicely as the couple's two eldest children.A story of love and loss and despair, `Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia' is a film that is sure to astonish you visually and touch your emotionally.  Sure, the films initial plot is not as original as I would have liked it to be (at least not when you consider most Asian cinema today) but the actors and the director (a marvelous Yimou Zhang) elevate the material and create a must see spectacle that is designed to take your breath away.",4,A golden triumph...,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,3578,"['Truly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', '2006', 'Man', 'Cheng', 'Jin', 'Dai', 'Huang', 'Jin', 'Jia', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'film', 'indeed', 'inner', 'beauty', 'glorious', 'set', 'pieces', 'costume', 'design', 'tragic', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'not', 'mention', 'central', 'beating', 'heart', 'Gong', 'Li', 'as', 'well', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'Chinese', 'epic', 'definitely', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'miss.Taking', 'place', 'China', 'Tang', 'dynasty', 'film', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'struggle', 'husband', 'Emperor', 'Ping', 'Having', 'two', 'sons', 'raised', 'eldest', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Emperor', 'Ping', 'further', 'use', 'wife', 'so', 'slowly', 'poisoned', 'black', 'fungi', 'will', 'gradually', 'render', 'insane', 'Once', 'Phoenix', 'uncovers', 'husbands', 'dastardly', 'own', 'plan', 'motion', 'dethrone', 'place', 'kingdom', 'hands', 'son', 'Prince', 'Jai', 'Empress', 'relationship', 'Emperor', 'son', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Wan', 'may', 'jeopardize', 'plans', 'stepmother', 'order', 'protect', 'father.But', 'twist', 'festival', 'honor', 'Emperor', 'late', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'vain', 'all.The', 'film', 'also', 'politics', 'revolving', 'Emperor', 'rule', 'cruelty', 'safeguards', 'power', 'relationship', 'own', 'children', 'placed', 'edge', 'cower', 'command', 'film', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'reign', 'man', 'was', 'aided', 'own', 'ruthlessness', 'also', 'lasting', 'affects', 'acquainted', 'him.So', 'film', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'costume', 'design', 'failed', 'garner', 'other', 'major', 'awards', 'traction', 'sad', 'film', 'astonishing', 'really', 'angle', 'set', 'design', 'cinematography', 'flawless', 'should', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'rewarded', 'nominations', 'more', 'importantly', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'short', 'listed', 'alongside', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Lives', 'Others', 'one', 'best', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'year.And', 'then', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'given', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Now', 'know', 'year', 'was', 'really', 'tough', 'one', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'Academy', 'did', 'nominate', 'five', 'very', 'deserving', 'leading', 'ladies', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Gong', 'Li', 'was', 'better', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'Li', 'truly', 'had', 'toughest', 'performance', 'sell', 'had', 'make', 'characters', 'tick', 'quiver', 'seem', 'authentic', 'believable', 'especially', 'poisoned', 'condition', 'worsened', 'also', 'had', 'incorporate', 'ticks', 'emotional', 'response', 'surroundings', 'allowing', 'take', 'over', 'completely', 'did', 'so', 'marvelously', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'slew', 'technical', 'accomplishments', 'performance', 'very', 'grounded', 'emotional', 'journey', 'woman', 'betrayed', 'scorned', 'determined', 'take', 'what', 'owed.Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'also', 'brilliant', 'evil', 'Emperor', 'Ping', 'delivering', 'very', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'Ye', 'Liu', 'also', 'deliver', 'nicely', 'couple', 'two', 'eldest', 'children.A', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'despair', 'Man', 'Cheng', 'Jin', 'Dai', 'Huang', 'Jin', 'Jia', 'film', 'sure', 'astonish', 'visually', 'touch', 'emotionally', 'Sure', 'films', 'initial', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'least', 'not', 'when', 'consider', 'most', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'today', 'actors', 'director', 'marvelous', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'elevate', 'material', 'create', 'must', 'see', 'spectacle', 'designed', 'take', 'breath', 'away']",Curse of the Golden Flower
1050216,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B000MRA592,Annie Feng,"[4, 16]","to give this movie an A+, this movie was the worst movie of the year! dreadfully to sit through, not to mention extremely predictable, half way through the movie I already know what the ending is, and I was VERY right.This movie is an adaptation of the famous Chinese novel Lei Yu (title best translated into ""Thunder Storm"").the story is simple enough: in the beginning we see the empress who looks like she's about to pass out from an anxiety attack, then we found out that she was SLOWLY being poisoned by the EVIL emperor, along with that we also found out that she's having a secret affair with the eldest prince (who obviously isn't her biological son but still---- EWWWW); eventually the real mother of the eldest prince came up and she works for the empress trying to bring the emperor down ('cause DUH, he cheated on her) but that didn't work out well 'cause the emperor then tried to assassinate her whole family. Anyways the empress has had enough and is planning to rebel the emperor on the eve of the Chrysanthemum Festival, she told her eldest real son about it (but not for some reason the younger son) but in the end nothing happened and everybody died, the End. and oh, there's also this really annoying girl who is really the eldest prince's half sister yada yada yada.Is it really a surprise I could summarize everything of the whole 2-hour movie within a paragraph? So what did all the wasting, dragging-time scene show you? basically each character going like ""OMG I'm going insane!"" for 30 minutes each. Can you say ""sleep time""?And don't tell me that I don't get it, I happens to know the story of Lei Yu pretty damn well, and I also enjoyed watching several soap opera and movies of it. This movie, with all its glamour, did not reflect well of its meaning as Lei Yu did, which is about a corruping upper-class family during the early 1900s. That story reflected the corrupting that revolved in a COMMON upper-class family and so reflected the corruption in the society during that period of time. But The Curse is about the royal family in ancient China; um just HOW MANY stories weren't written about how terrible monarchy is? I could count them in one hand, come to think of it I can't think of any.And I can bet I see more in the movie than most of you. Yeah, I get the contrast between the riches and glamour and the coldness and terror within the palace, and the irony that the emperor appears to be a ""rules person"" but in truth he's as corrupted and twisted as they come. Also I get the heavy gold costume mirror the weight each character carries---- more money, more power, more weight more corruption, savvy?And of course there is the chilling aftermath of the blood bath battle on the golden flowers---basically the flowers and bodies and blood were quickly and silently replaced, the festival went on as if nothing happened.

At least Zhang really tries to empathize the whole ""the Absurb ends with death"" thing, but unfortunately because of the Chinese culture of the honor system suicide is actually seen as heroic so it would totally collide with Camus *sigh*So if you REALLY love the color gold, and aren't sick of Zhang Yi Mo movies like I do (common admit it, they're all pretty much the same thing), you might enjoy it better than I did.",1,Gosh these people must all be insane,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,4003,"['give', 'movie', 'A+', 'movie', 'was', 'worst', 'movie', 'year', 'dreadfully', 'sit', 'not', 'mention', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'VERY', 'right.This', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'famous', 'Chinese', 'novel', 'Lei', 'Yu', 'title', 'best', 'translated', 'Thunder', 'Storm', '.the', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'beginning', 'see', 'empress', 'who', 'pass', 'out', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'then', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'SLOWLY', 'being', 'poisoned', 'EVIL', 'emperor', 'also', 'found', 'out', 'having', 'secret', 'affair', 'eldest', 'prince', 'who', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'biological', 'son', 'still', 'EWWWW', 'eventually', 'real', 'mother', 'eldest', 'prince', 'came', 'up', 'empress', 'trying', 'bring', 'emperor', 'down', 'DUH', 'cheated', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'well', 'emperor', 'then', 'tried', 'assassinate', 'whole', 'family', 'empress', 'had', 'enough', 'planning', 'rebel', 'emperor', 'eve', 'Chrysanthemum', 'Festival', 'told', 'eldest', 'real', 'son', 'not', 'reason', 'younger', 'son', 'end', 'nothing', 'happened', 'everybody', 'died', 'End', 'oh', 'also', 'really', 'annoying', 'girl', 'who', 'really', 'eldest', 'prince', 'half', 'sister', 'yada', 'yada', 'really', 'surprise', 'could', 'summarize', 'everything', 'whole', '2-hour', 'movie', 'paragraph', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'wasting', 'dragging-time', 'scene', 'show', 'basically', 'character', 'going', 'OMG', ""'m"", 'going', 'insane', '30', 'minutes', 'Can', 'say', 'sleep', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'happens', 'know', 'story', 'Lei', 'Yu', 'pretty', 'damn', 'well', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'several', 'soap', 'opera', 'movies', 'movie', 'glamour', 'did', 'not', 'reflect', 'well', 'meaning', 'Lei', 'Yu', 'did', 'corruping', 'upper-class', 'family', 'early', '1900s', 'story', 'reflected', 'corrupting', 'revolved', 'COMMON', 'upper-class', 'family', 'so', 'reflected', 'corruption', 'society', 'period', 'time', 'Curse', 'royal', 'family', 'ancient', 'China', 'um', 'just', 'HOW', 'MANY', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'written', 'how', 'terrible', 'monarchy', 'could', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'come', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'any.And', 'can', 'bet', 'see', 'more', 'movie', 'most', 'Yeah', 'get', 'contrast', 'riches', 'glamour', 'coldness', 'terror', 'palace', 'irony', 'emperor', 'be', 'rules', 'person', 'truth', 'as', 'corrupted', 'twisted', 'come', 'Also', 'get', 'heavy', 'gold', 'costume', 'mirror', 'weight', 'character', 'more', 'money', 'more', 'power', 'more', 'weight', 'more', 'corruption', 'savvy', 'course', 'chilling', 'aftermath', 'blood', 'bath', 'battle', 'golden', 'flowers', '-basically', 'flowers', 'bodies', 'blood', 'were', 'quickly', 'silently', 'replaced', 'festival', 'went', 'nothing', 'happened', 'OOOOOOOOOHHHAnd', 'course', 'end', 'emperor', 'always', 'matter', 'what', 'even', 'historically', 'speaking', 'royal', 'families', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'women', 'who', 'weild', 'most', 'power', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'sterotyping.so', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'have', 'NEVER', 'seen', 'single', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mo', 'movie', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'just', 'add', 'LOTS', 'gold', ""'ve"", 'got', 'whole', 'thing', 'people', 'tell', 'only', 'Zhang', 'can', 'do', 'cinemotography', 'DUH', 'got', 'moneyAnd', 'common', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'typical', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mo', 'nothing', 'happened', 'everybody', 'died', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'moron', 'not', 'figuring', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'least', 'Zhang', 'really', 'empathize', 'whole', 'Absurb', 'death', 'thing', 'unfortunately', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'honor', 'system', 'suicide', 'actually', 'seen', 'heroic', 'would', 'totally', 'collide', 'Camus', '*sigh*So', 'REALLY', 'love', 'color', 'gold', 'are', ""n't"", 'sick', 'Zhang', 'Yi', 'Mo', 'movies', 'do', 'common', 'admit', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'might', 'enjoy', 'better', 'did']",Curse of the Golden Flower

The Curse of the Golden Flower, despite an inappropriate title because it does not or barely describes what the movie is about, is one of them. The movie is a sobering demonstration of the devastating effects of deceit, malice, lust, envy, personal ambitions combined, yet on the other hand, humility, affection and simplicity swallowed up and ruined by the depravity of men displayed in betrayal, murder and blood-baths, within the backdrop of complex relationships in an imperial family. In few words, I would describe it as a serious, honestly humane, and painfully realistic colossal drama with surprising intrigues.

The direction and editing of course are solid.Yet there seems to lack substance in the midst of all this beauty. The story is simple with no real twists or turns, the costumes, beautiful as they may be, are not very realistic, and there's a definite lingering feeling that a lot of the scenes in the movie are only there because they can be, eg massive (MASSIVE) armies, HUGE amounts of servants etc.Basically it follows the current Chinese formula for a grand picture: stunning scenery, beautiful costumes, gorgeous women, and impressive numbers of organized people.

1050223,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000MRA592,Brian E. Erland,"[24, 44]","Note: Chinese with English subtitles (optional feature with audio in English and Mandarin).`Curse of the Golden Flower' released in `07  is a strange, confusing mixture of genres that leaves one to wonder what was the original intent behind making this film. Is it a period piece, an exotic romance, a tale of political intrigue, an opulent soap opera, or a violent and bloody martial arts epic? Well, it's all of the above and I guess that's ok if the formula works. Unfortunately for the majority of the film it doesn't.The movie begins slowly with the Emperor and his royal family doing partaking in long sequences of introductions and posturing. The English subtitles are stiff and lacks substance, too bad I don't speak Chinese. The film does gain some momentum midway through but then a lot of what it gains is lost in an endless torrent of blood and death at the end. As for the overall message of the film, I would surmise it's something much like that of `Hero.' The Emperor is always right no matter how wrong he really is.While `Curse of the Golden Flower' does supply the magnificent visuals we've come to expect from Chinese epics in recent years the film lacks the artistic style and poetic depth of such classics as `Hero' and the romantic, emotional impact of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'Another area where this film falls short of expectations is the dismal soundtrack that is reminiscent of a never-ending funeral dirge. It's slow, monotonous, boring and pompous. Definitely not something you would listen to on its own.On a positive note, the cast is excellent with such well known stars as Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li and lesser known but fine performances by Chou Jay, Liu Ye and the very lovely Li Man as Chan.If you watch it just for the visuals you won't be disappointed.

It's so beautifully designed and filmed that words can't describe, even on my low-end HDTV.

Nope. those days are gone since he started Hollywoodizing his movies.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[5, 7]","The success of foreign martial arts films has given rise to beautifully executed movies such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"". Now, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" adds it's weight to the ranks, and upholds this particular style of film perfectly.Due to the style of the film, and the general language barrier (as a language, Chinese and Japanese can sometimes be difficult to translate into English), the plot can get a little confusing at times, but it eventually irons itself out later on. The main gist of the plot is that the Empress of China has discovered that her husband, the Emperor, has been slowly poisoning her with a type of fungi that will cause her to lose all mental capacity if it is taken in small doses over a period of a few months. Upon learning this, she decides to stage a coupe with her most trusted son in an attempt to overthrow the Emperor. There are several side plots, but they mostly serve to create character depth.As expected, this film is breathtakingly beautiful, from it's set and costumes, to the artistic cinematography. It was nominated at the 2007 Academy Awards for costume design, and it was well deserving of the nomination. Because it is a foreign film, it is of course subtitled, but the viewer also has an option to change the subtitles to English dubbing instead. However, I always prefer to use the subtitles because I feel that there is something lost when altering the voice inflection with someone speaking English who is *not* the original actor.

His films have this larger than life scope that are simply breathtaking to behold in terms of set designs and choreography, whether it's martial arts or battles and this film is no exception to the rule.  Zhang's ability to coordinate a myriad of events into one seamless scene after another is remarkable, but this time around his directorial blessing is cursed by his inferior script.'Curse of the Golden Flower's story suffered from lack of character development and mostly unsympathetic participants, then there is the issue of significant plot holes as well.  Some of the fight scenes were incongruous as well as superfluous both in execution as well as relevance, and various characters' motivations were far from explained sufficiently, particularly towards the end.The first half of the film dragged plot wise and then all of a sudden there was a rush during the final chapter to expose various characters' dark secrets and desires, some that literally came out of nowhere which added almost nothing worthwhile to the overall story.Aesthetically pleasing to be sure, with amazing locations, beautiful costumes, effective makeup and captivating cinematography, but despite those strong elements as well as decent acting, it really does not work all that well without an equally powerful plot to support their weight.  Chow Yun Fat is a highly capable actor but unfortunately he does not have enough material to truly showcase his talent, as seen in the superior film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  Gong Li was the strongest performer of the cast, but even her effort was not enough to save this film since the script does not fully explain her motivation and as such it made it difficult to relate to her, and the same was true for the rest of the actors.The real story behind this piece of ancient Chinese history is interesting, but the script does not really reflect it that well, primarily because it assumes too much prior knowledge from the audience, and essentially jumps into the middle of the story with little to no introduction of all the circumstances regarding events and characters.  For a film that lasts nearly two hours there is an awful small amount of plot development and it's not enough to justify its length.Zhang Yimou wrote the script, but clearly he is a more talented director than writer.  This film's script suffers from some of the same problems as another movie he wrote and directed, 'House of Flying Daggers', although it had a little more cohesive storyline than his latest creation.I would recommend renting this film to any fan of Zhang's prior work as well as newcomers, but it's not the kind of film worth watching more than once, unless one mostly watches films for their aesthetic value.  For those expecting a captivating and in depth storyline, skip this tragic yet empty tale.",3,"This Movie Was Cursed, But Not By the Golden Flower",1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3164,"[""'Curse"", 'Golden', 'Flower', 'starts', 'intriguingly', 'enough', 'more', 'less', 'where', 'allure', 'never', 'really', 'grandiose', 'ambitions', 'mostly', 'visual', 'basis.First', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'then', 'again', 'be', 'expected', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'given', 'already', 'impressive', 'filmography', 'films', 'have', 'larger', 'life', 'scope', 'are', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'behold', 'terms', 'set', 'designs', 'choreography', 'martial', 'arts', 'battles', 'film', 'exception', 'rule', 'Zhang', 'ability', 'coordinate', 'myriad', 'events', 'one', 'seamless', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'time', 'directorial', 'blessing', 'cursed', 'inferior', 'script', ""'Curse"", 'Golden', 'Flower', 'story', 'suffered', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'mostly', 'unsympathetic', 'participants', 'then', 'issue', 'significant', 'plot', 'holes', 'as', 'well', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'incongruous', 'as', 'well', 'superfluous', 'execution', 'as', 'well', 'relevance', 'various', 'characters', 'motivations', 'were', 'far', 'explained', 'sufficiently', 'particularly', 'end.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'dragged', 'plot', 'wise', 'then', 'sudden', 'was', 'rush', 'final', 'chapter', 'expose', 'various', 'characters', 'dark', 'secrets', 'desires', 'literally', 'came', 'nowhere', 'added', 'almost', 'nothing', 'worthwhile', 'overall', 'story.Aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'be', 'sure', 'amazing', 'locations', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'effective', 'makeup', 'captivating', 'cinematography', 'strong', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'decent', 'acting', 'really', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'equally', 'powerful', 'plot', 'support', 'weight', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'highly', 'capable', 'actor', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'material', 'truly', 'showcase', 'talent', 'seen', 'superior', 'film', ""'Crouching"", 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Gong', 'Li', 'was', 'strongest', 'performer', 'cast', 'even', 'effort', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'script', 'not', 'fully', 'explain', 'motivation', 'such', 'made', 'difficult', 'relate', 'same', 'was', 'true', 'rest', 'actors.The', 'real', 'story', 'piece', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'history', 'interesting', 'script', 'not', 'really', 'reflect', 'well', 'primarily', 'too', 'much', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'essentially', 'jumps', 'middle', 'story', 'little', 'introduction', 'circumstances', 'regarding', 'events', 'characters', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'awful', 'small', 'amount', 'plot', 'development', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'length.Zhang', 'Yimou', 'wrote', 'script', 'clearly', 'more', 'talented', 'director', 'writer', 'film', 'script', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'movie', 'wrote', 'directed', ""'House"", 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'cohesive', 'storyline', 'latest', 'creation.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'film', 'fan', 'Zhang', 'prior', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'newcomers', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'one', 'mostly', 'films', 'aesthetic', 'value', 'expecting', 'captivating', 'depth', 'storyline', 'skip', 'tragic', 'yet', 'empty', 'tale']",Curse of the Golden Flower
1050232,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000MRA592,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","Many have commented on the epic scale of this production.  Some claim it is the most expensive movie ever made in China and that the set was the largest ever constructed for a movie there.  Whatever the claims, the visuals in this movie are amazing.  Frankly, I have never seen colors and opulence depicted in such luxurious tones before.  The word dazzling seems somewhat understated.I don't know classical Chinese history or mythology, but this is supposedly based on a historical tale from about a thousand years ago.  Emperor Ping was a mere soldier who used a marriage to a royal daughter to claim his throne.  He is ruthless beyond measure in keeping it.  His wife, Empress Phoenix feels she is being poisoned by the medicine he forces her to take each day.  The Emperor's sons all struggle for position and there are secrets galore that contribute to their antagonism and ferocity.  The children are used and manipulated as needed by each parent.  I will let you work out the details as you watch the movie.Is the acting great?  Well, the story doesn't demand terrible complexity in the characters.  Also, remember that Western style emoting may not be what the Chinese acting ethos is all about.  For me, the acting was sufficient.  It was clear to me what was happening and the emotions rang true.  The combat sequences are quite spectacular.  Ninjas are all over the place doing all kinds of strange and almost magical things for the Emperor with a lot of it going on in the air (with ropes).  The various ground armies are also amazing in scope.So, is this a great movie?  No.  Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Is it a classic?  I doubt it, but you will sure remember the brilliance of the colors and the army sequences.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",4,Amazing visuals,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,1766,"['Many', 'have', 'commented', 'epic', 'scale', 'production', 'claim', 'most', 'expensive', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'China', 'set', 'was', 'largest', 'ever', 'constructed', 'movie', 'there', 'Whatever', 'claims', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'Frankly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'colors', 'opulence', 'depicted', 'such', 'luxurious', 'tones', 'word', 'dazzling', 'somewhat', 'understated.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'classical', 'Chinese', 'history', 'mythology', 'supposedly', 'based', 'historical', 'tale', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'Emperor', 'Ping', 'was', 'mere', 'soldier', 'who', 'used', 'marriage', 'royal', 'daughter', 'claim', 'throne', 'ruthless', 'measure', 'keeping', 'wife', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'feels', 'being', 'poisoned', 'medicine', 'take', 'day', 'Emperor', 'sons', 'struggle', 'position', 'are', 'secrets', 'galore', 'contribute', 'antagonism', 'ferocity', 'children', 'are', 'used', 'manipulated', 'needed', 'parent', 'will', 'let', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'watch', 'movie.Is', 'acting', 'great', 'Well', 'story', ""n't"", 'demand', 'terrible', 'complexity', 'characters', 'Also', 'remember', 'Western', 'style', 'emoting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'Chinese', 'acting', 'ethos', 'acting', 'was', 'sufficient', 'was', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'emotions', 'rang', 'true', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'are', 'place', 'doing', 'kinds', 'strange', 'almost', 'magical', 'things', 'Emperor', 'lot', 'going', 'air', 'ropes', 'various', 'ground', 'armies', 'are', 'also', 'amazing', 'scope.So', 'great', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Yes', 'classic', 'doubt', 'will', 'sure', 'remember', 'brilliance', 'colors', 'army', 'sequences.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",Curse of the Golden Flower

1050234,A1COAX8KHFQHE3,B000MRA592,David Roth,"[5, 7]","Curse of the Golden Flower is a brutal and beautiful look at the inner court of a Chinese Dynasty. When distrust and ill-intent creep in, the stage is set for a powerful and gripping masterpiece.Anyone familiar with past works of Zhang Yimou knows they are in for a visual masterpiece. Curse is no exception. The use of color that Yimou is so well known for is apparent throughtout with vibrant and awe inspiring locals, backdrops, and costumes. Truely one of his greatest visual works.The story is not quite as convoluted and twisting as those of Yimou's past works (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) and lays itself out relatively early. That isn't to say it doesn't have its share of twists. It is more about the personification of what the knowledge of the situation does to the members of the royal family. Why they act as they do. And how they plan to resolve everything, each in their own way. An amazing work of characterization capped off with solid performances from the main cast of characters.Chow Yun Fat plays the Emperor to perfection. He is cold and calculating, while remaining a sense of majesty and humanity despite some of his actions. The three princes are portrayed wonderfully by some very competent actors. Especially the roles of Prince Jai and Crown Prince Wan. As the movie progresses the roles of the princes begin to become far more than you could ever imagine and family lines are drawn as sides are taken.But out of all the wonderful astetics and performances, nothing outshines Gong Li. Her portrayal of the Empress is absolutely breathtaking. Gong Li is known more for her dramatic roles than those she has in action movies and I was worried initially, but she really doesn't take part in any of the action and her full abilities as a dramatic actress are on display to be seen. Harnessing various emotions ranging from pain, suffering, loss, heartache, and anger, Gong Li crafts a character that is to be admired and adored by all. This truely is one of her greatest works ever.Overall, Curse of the Golden Flower is another amazing movie by Zhang Yimou. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I personally expected more story. While the story that is here is wonderful and really draws you in, I think maybe I may just be jaded by Yimou's other masterpieces of the last few years.

There are a few twists and turns in the story line but they were pretty much predictable especially when it involved Wan's biological mother and his secret love interest Chan. Nevertheless I enjoyed the story much more so than in ""Hero"" and it was less confusing than ""House of Flying Daggers"". I loved the vibrant colors in the costumes and scenery.

1050241,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B000MRA592,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[1, 1]","Any film by Zhang Yimou is sure to leave the viewer with enormous expectations for a meaningful plot, sensational scenes, a sense of wonder at the creativity and artistic expression of this media and satisfaction and fulfillment at the end. This film met some of the criteria mentioned but for me it fell short in the most important aspect which is ""satisfaction and fulfillment."" I was appalled at the bloody scenes and carnage which was the aftermath of an unsuccessful revolt. Having viewed the film twice, my overall impression remains it was not worth the great cost and amount of research it took to try to create authenticity and special effects to impress the viewer. The film is an epic tragedy about an Imperial family from the Tang Dynasty whose hidden lives behind the walls of the Forbidden City were filled with secrets, deception and tragedy. The plot is complex, filled with subterfuge and subplots making this a highly suspenseful interesting film despite its drawbacks. The Emperor lived during an era when male domination was total. For reasons which were later made  clear, he was slowly poisoning his wife. His word was law, he seemed formidable and unapproachable. The Empress and his sons were expected to be obedient to his will and intentions. This naturally created tension in his marriage and jealousy among his sons. Gradually, the film reveals the multilayered subplots within the story. It seems every important member of the Imperial family has a hidden agenda: the Emperor, the Empress, and each of the Princes. There are secret love affairs, one of which is very shocking in scope, although the  parties involved engage innocently in the relationship, not knowing the eventual consequences. It leads to a tragic ending.The Emperor had been a general in the Imperial Army before he staged a coup many years ago in order to achieve the highest position of authority and power in the realm: to become Emperor. He committed some murders to quiet any opposition. Therefore, he had great reason for paranoia and distrust. One of the most unique aspects of this film is how it depicts the gradual unraveling of secrets which destroys the family bonds beyond repair. This DVD provides a great special feature: an outstanding interview with the Zhang Yimou, the director. He provides unique insights about the film's contents and his intentions. He and his staff did painstaking research for several months to provide the lavish designs and colorful d&eacute;cor to recreate the Imperial palace as it would have been decorated during the Tang Dynasty. This is the first Chinese film which staged such a large battle scene, using so many soldiers on screen. I give 5 stars for the story and the complex interrelationships of the characters. Zhang Yimou deserves high accolades for selecting outstanding actors to play the major roles. The director's explanation of the Chinese virtue called ""xiao"" which means filial duty to one's parents, clarifies why the eldest son of the Empress chose to lead the revolt against his father regardless of the limited chance for success. The Prince chose to act only after learning the Emperor was poisoning his mother ...For me, there is an overpowering sense of suffocation due to the large scope of this epic. Even the dazzling mega stars who play the leading roles to perfection, Chow Yun Fat (Emperor) and Gong Li (Empress) can not eliminate this feeling. The film begins with highly dramatic orchestral music accompanying the anticipation of the arrival of the Emperor. There are literally thousands of female servants, male workers and soldiers many of whom are dressed alike, presumably those in the same class, who serve the needs of the Imperial family, all of them are dressed in the finest silk costumes of the Tang Dynasty era, awaiting his arrival, ready to serve his every need or desire. It is so very overwhelmng and this sense of ""too much"" continues throughout the film which is why I give an overall rating of 3 stars. Even when the Empress, her entourage, the Princes or the Emperor walk down the corridors, everything is too bright and too colorful. The d&eacute;cor is way over the top. The displays of so much wealth and riches, detracts from the plot. For me, the final insult to the senses occurs during the revolt in the Imperial courtyard, where a wall to wall field of yellow chrysanthemums are trampled and destroyed. When it is all over, the clean up crew wash the courtyard of all the blood and replace the dead chrysanthemums with live ones, as if nothing out of the ordinairy happened. The servants wash the bloody corridors, roll up the soiled carpet and replace it with a new, all in a day's work at the palace. In the end, the film is one bloody mess and I heave sigh of relief when it is over! Amazingly, it is exactly the creative efforts which Zhang Yimou describes that he adds to this film which I find annoying: too many servants and too much opulence. He explained the film is based on a famous Chinese play, which I totally understand because on stage it would be impossible to create the special effects which are overpowering on film. This is one Shakespearean tragedy that went totally awry. In my opinion, it is NOT Yimou's best work.

His ability to capture an intricate story historically based in a setting of splendor is up there with the great filmmakers.  CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is no exception.The time of the story is the Tang Dynasty, one of the more corrupt and cruel periods in Chinese history.  Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) has married a princess from the neighboring province, becoming Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) and in addition to becoming stepmother to the Emperor's firs-born son (Ye Liu), she bears him two additional sons (Jay Chou and Junjie Qin). Attending the palace is a doctor (Dahong Nim) and his wife (Jin Chen) who figure significantly in the family's destiny.  Each of these dysfunctional family members has secrets that could destroy an empire. The Empress is clearly the titular head of the kingdom and her wily manipulations and incestuous relationships are controlled only by her doses of a medicine that is supposed to make her insane.  The boils on the body of the ruling family fester until great wars break out and the royal family is revealed to be the strangely bizarre group they are.The story works (though admittedly it is often difficult to follow) because of a brilliant cast and a pacing from the director that almost matches the glory of the visual production that seems to keep growing on the screen, like a huge garden bearing more color and moods as the story progresses.

The setting, the palace, the costumes, all the elements that build the image we see on the screen are marvellous and admirable, even if the falling weapons sound like table forks and if it all looks like an illusionary illusion of beaming gold and silver. The intrigue, the plot, the action is nothing at all except some wide and hefty internal fight in the imperial family that is reduced to a pack of rats in a big pot. They eat one another alive and their mouths are dripping with blood, human blood mind you, more than the mouth of Anne Rice's vampires. So we jump from father killing to mother killing to brother killing to neighbour killing to whatever you may think of killing, and of course the boss will save his skin with a little help from some ninja turtle warriors and from some soft Kung Fu fighters.

Here he plays a scheming, ruthless, sadistic emperor to perfection. I'm not sure why people would call this a martial arts movie. The focus is on the intrigue and the drama. The plot is convoluted. Seeing the movie multiple times would probably help. Zhang use of color and spectacle is impressive.The problem with the movie is the battle scenes. They are too fantastic. All the palace intrigue works. It is a little over the top, but it is like Shakespeare: bigger-than-life people screw up their lives in bigger than life ways. The fight scenes just didn't do it for me. Too many fights are just too gravity defying. Another problem is that everybody knows martial arts in the movie. The final battle seem too grand. On the plus side, it is cool how they removed all traces of a very bloody battle for the festival the next day. One of the main themes of the movie is how the emperor holds the country together while his family is disintegrating. I have a another minor qualm: there is a lot of cleavage. At one point there were thousands of women dressed in low cut dresses in a court room. My friend from China told me that no Chinese woman would dress in such revealing clothing. The Chinese press took the director to task for the costumes.The movie worked on several levels; however, it never really pulled me in. In some ways it was too over the top. It was too dramatic.

Unfortunately, for me, that's ALL this film is. It's like a beautiful sunset or a wonderful aroma. It is what it is, and offers little more.Once you have watched this film you will automatically notice the lack of character development through out this story. You simply cannot tell such an intriguing story without letting the audience in and having them care deeply for your players. The only character, who I really felt had any depth here, was Prince Jai; and even that could've been much deeper. The color palette of this film is not the only thing I have problem with this film. The costumes in the movie seem like somebody mixed up the woman's Chinese imperial costumes with the woman's European royal costumes of the 15th century. I have never seen so much cleavage in a Chinese film!  As gorgeous as they are they did seem a little too force.I love Zhang. I think he's a genius and his body of work proves this, so maybe that added to my disappointment. I had very high expectations...Chow Yun Fat...Gong Li...How can it miss? Well it missed. It almost felt rushed...Like it should've been a 4-hour epic. I think that's what it would've taken to really tell this as it should've been told. It's hard to explain; and the film is so gorgeous that its even hard to think that it would need that much added to it, but in my opinion it did.The story, from what I understand, comes from old Chinese text. It is a brilliant tale of an empire, and its first family. I really cannot get into detail anymore than that without spoiling anything. Jist? The emperor is coming home to his palace, and so is Jai, one of his sons. Living there with their mother, are his other two sons, the crown Prince (the oldest of the three??) and Prince Cheng; the youngest of the three. Emperor Ping is a ruthless leader, and leads his family in the same fashion. Backstabbing, plotting, love and hate are all present here. It could've been so much more.

1050260,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B000MRA592,JLind555,"[1, 1]","The year is 928 and the evil Tang emperor is slowly but inexorably poisoning his beautiful, unfaithful wife, after learning that she has been having an affair with her stepson, his eldest son.  He can't kill her outright, because bringing her adultery into the open would discredit both himself and his son, so he takes an insidious revenge.  He's added a new ingredient to her daily potion, a black fungus from Persia that, taken in small doses over a few months, will turn her into a cretin.  But the empress isn't about to go down without a fight; she's onto his schemes and has hatched a scheme of her own: on the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival, when all Chinese celebrate the unity of the family, she'll raise a palace rebellion, force the emperor to abdicate and make her own blood son, Prince Jai, the emperor in his place.So begins ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" a Chinese morality story directed by Zhang Yimou, and it's a visual knockout: our eyes are almost assaulted by the lush interiors and the exterior action scenes.  The emperor's palace looks like an explosion in a Day-Glo factory; a non-stop riot of color everywhere you look.  The imperial family is covered in so much gold from nose to toes that you wonder how they can stand up straight, let alone move about.  Everything about the palace is regimented down to the last detail and we understand it's all to underline the power of the emperor.  When he sneezes, the earth shakes.The actors put in creditable performances.  Chow Yun Fat (I wish Amazon would respect the Chinese rule of putting the surname first and stop calling him Yun Fat Chow) gives a chilling portrayal of the emperor, venal and evil, cruel and insensitive; watching him calmly chowing down at the Chrysanthemum Festival after his world has fallen down around his ears is mind-blowing.  The beautiful Gong Li wins our sympathy as the empress, determined to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, even if it means taking everyone else down with her.  Of the three sons, Liu Ye gives the most impressive performance as the weak Crown Prince Wan, seduced by his stepmother, unable to extricate himself from her machinations, and terrified of his sire; he arouses in us a mixture of pity and contempt.  Qin Junjie is somewhat perplexing as the third son, Yu, who turns out to have had his own agenda all along and totally upsets the apple cart.  The minor characters are interesting and well played, notably Li Man as the imperial doctor's daughter Chan, exquisitely beautiful with a face like a cameo.  But the most intriguing character in this film is the emperor's cast-off first wife, the crown prince's birth mother, who reappears in the lives of the imperial family in a singularly incovenient fashion; Chen Jin's performance in this difficult role is excellent.What keeps ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" from being a great movie, as opposed to a merely good movie, is there's so much of everything, it's all so overblown, that it's more melodrama than true drama.  We watch it, we're blown away by it, but we don't really feel it.  One gets the sense that Zhang Yimou was piling special effect on special effect and the result is a kind of sensory overload.  We're watching an opulent movie and the effects are so over the top that they almost overwhelm the story.""Curse of the Golden Flower"" is meant to be a morality play, but it seems that the person most in need of enlightenment, the emperor himself, has learned exactly nothing.  He knows only one way to be emperor, and he's succeeded both because of his cruelty and in spite of it.  After all the blood is shed, the bodies are carted off, the blood is washed away, new carpets and chrysanthemums laid down, and everything will continue as usual.  It's as if everything that went before was an inconvenient glitch in the proceedings, and it leaves us feeling curiously empty after the final credits.(And to the producers: next time you film a historical movie, check your history book first.

1050261,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B000MRA592,jmpg,"[14, 28]","""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside"". This is the old Chinese proverb director Zhang Yimou quoted when attempting to describe the overall theme of this movie...and well, I could not agree with him more! While Curse of the Golden Flower does look beautiful and lavish on the outside with its flashy exterior, at its core it is almost devoid of just about everything else.Curse of the Golden Flower centers around an imperial family that eventually falls apart. As of this writing, this is the most expensive movie ever made in China and it definitely shows. Everything from the re-imagination of the Forbidden City to the interior of the royal palace illustrates the amount of care and precarious work emphasized on detail. Some of it is not all great, especially those bizarre glowing pillars. The costumes themselves looked remarkably funny, especially since the actors were always struggling to keep such weight on them while appearing awkwardly serious in their performances.The movie delves into the personalities of the characters and each of their own distinct motives. However, it still does little or nothing to add or enrich the story, which frequently borders on being predictable on more than one occasion while at times not even driving any kind of story at all. It uses virtually every single dysfunctional royal family clich&eacute; in the book. There is no real sense of urgency as to what's happening because nothing is truly developed. By the time the so-called ""hidden family secrets"" are finally revealed, it all isn't as cracked up as it was supposed to be. And somehow were expected to be shocked or surprised?As for the starring roles, Chow Yun Fat does nothing convincing as a senile emperor except to stroke his beard while dishing out proverbs. Gong Li's version of drama is to cry and tremble in front of the camera while being careful with her breasts falling out. Jay Chou and Liu Ye as the emperor's sons don't do anything noteworthy. The dialogue in this movie is particularly boring if you know Mandarin, and everything is just overacted and taken too seriously than what it should be. Curse of the Golden Flower also contains some of the most laughable scenes in Chinese cinema history, a few of which made purely for shock factor. This is about a dysfunctional family, yet why should we care?This movie drew inspiration from Thunderstorm, written by Cao Yu. Unfortunately, Zhang Yimou decided to mutilate and transform this wonderful classic story into a bloated big-budget carnival extravaganza, complete with a bombardment of colors, showy breasts, and also found the time to include some martial arts and epic army CGI action while he was at it. He even hired an all-star cast, although their roles did not require any of them to do much with talent except to utilize their celebrity status in order to sell the film. And all this for what? For the sake of just generating box office numbers?It seems as though Zhang Yimou felt like he couldn't win an Academy Award when he reverted back to his old style with Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles, so he comes back to doing Hollywood stuff like this. If Chen Kaige's The Promise was the worst original Chinese movie ever made, then Curse of the Golden Flower has got to be the worst Chinese adaptation ever made. As a lesson to be learned, Zhang should have paid close attention to those very words that inspired him to make this film in the first place: ""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside"".

In CURSE, the story centers around the royal family, and here we find an attempt at Shakespearean drama.The royal family is a mess. The Emperor is poisoning his Consort, the Empress, and she is sleeping with the Crown Prince, the Emperor's son from his first wife - a son who calls the Empress Mother (at least he did in the English translation; I don't know how that would work itself out in Chinese). The Crown Prince, in turn, is sleeping with the daughter of the Imperial Physician, who himself is married to a woman with a mysterious background.It sounds like a great place to start, and perhaps it is, but with all of that suspiciously European Medieval-like court intrigue to be played out, very little happens in the first fifty-five minutes. We see gorgeous costumes, and the inside of a beautiful palace so stunningly colorful that it might give an epileptic a seizure; if the sun were to find its way in just so, it would be the mother of all kaleidoscopes and disco balls. We are inside of said palace for the majority of the film, which may be a problem in itself. Zhang does wonders with open land and panoramic scenes. He did grace us with some in this film, and they were magnificent. Scenes involving would-be assassins using grappling hooks and curved blades were poetically brilliant.But the story, which should start out as a bud and bloom full, chooses instead to shy away from the light. There is resolution, and the threads do play themselves out, but they don't do so in a way that garners intrigue or interest.Others have sung this film's praises, and one must wonder if they are still basking in the afterglow ofHeroandHouse of Flying Daggers. If so, it's understandable. Those were extraordinary films.This serves to prove the axiom that insists beauty is only skin deep. It is true with films as it is with people. There needs to be something below the surface.As this is a review of the DVD, I need to comment on the subtitles and languages. Being hearing impaired, I find this to be important and often overlooked. The DVD offered English as a language, so I selected that - I can hear well enough - and I selected English subtitles - I can't hear *that* well to get by without them. I could, however, hear well enough to know that the spoken word varied greatly from the ""subtitled word"". It was worthy of a few laughs.At least they offered English as a language.

And last but certainly not least the spoilt and unloved Prince Yu, (Junjie Qin) whose hatred of his family is cunningly disguised by his seemingly placid nature and acceptance of his lowly third son status.Add to this mix, an Imperial Physician (Dahong Ni) with a wife (Jin Chen) whose connection to the royal household is a closely guarded secret, her daughter the lovely Chan (Man Li) who is is in love with the Crown Prince and you have the ingredients for a tragedy on a scale that can only be imagined.With breathtaking scenery, the carpet of golden chrysanthemums has to be seen to be believed, fantastic costumes, atmospheric background music, coupled with stunning fight sequences between assassins and royal guards you will be left with your jaw hanging down as you witness the golden warriors go into battle against the Emperor and the twists and turns in a film that is none stop action and intrigue throughout.The overall acting is without doubt perfection on celluloid, its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but sometimes Hollywood gets it wrong, and boy did they get it wrong this time!",5,"Totally stunning, poetry on celluoid!",1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,2295,"['Firstly', 'be', 'clear', 'thing', 'not', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'incredible', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'leave', 'looking', 'stunned', 'wonder.Also', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'fortunately', 'not', 'dubbed', 'subtitles', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'enjoying', 'ever', 'single', 'second', 'opening', 'credits', 'blood', 'splattered', 'ending.The', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'sumptuous', 'tale', 'family', 'secrets', 'revenge', 'lust', 'desire', 'incest', 'adultery', 'power', 'corruption', 'wrapped', 'up', 'beautiful', 'very', 'flawed', 'package', 'Forbidden', 'City', '10th', 'century', 'China.Never', 'before', 'one', 'come', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Tang', 'dynasty', 'exquisite', 'deadly', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Li', 'Gong', 'thoroughly', 'amoral', 'Emperor', 'Ping', 'glorious', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Chow', 'element', 'three', 'sons', 'weak', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Wan', 'Ye', 'Liu', 'who', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'stepmother', 'Empress', 'Prince', 'Jai', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'brilliant', 'solider', 'loyal', 'son', 'mother', 'torn', 'duty', 'love', 'will', 'make', 'fateful', 'decision', 'will', 'herald', 'beginning', 'end', 'family', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'spoilt', 'unloved', 'Prince', 'Yu', 'Junjie', 'Qin', 'hatred', 'family', 'cunningly', 'disguised', 'seemingly', 'placid', 'nature', 'acceptance', 'lowly', 'third', 'son', 'status.Add', 'mix', 'Imperial', 'Physician', 'Dahong', 'Ni', 'wife', 'Jin', 'Chen', 'connection', 'royal', 'household', 'closely', 'guarded', 'secret', 'daughter', 'lovely', 'Chan', 'Man', 'Li', 'who', 'love', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'have', 'ingredients', 'tragedy', 'scale', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'imagined.With', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'carpet', 'golden', 'chrysanthemums', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'atmospheric', 'background', 'music', 'coupled', 'stunning', 'fight', 'sequences', 'assassins', 'royal', 'guards', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'down', 'witness', 'golden', 'warriors', 'go', 'battle', 'Emperor', 'twists', 'turns', 'film', 'none', 'stop', 'action', 'intrigue', 'throughout.The', 'overall', 'acting', 'doubt', 'perfection', 'celluloid', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'sometimes', 'Hollywood', 'wrong', 'boy', 'did', 'get', 'wrong', 'time']",Curse of the Golden Flower

What better way to promote a mediocre movie than exposed cleavage right?Also, it seems as if everyone is living in a giant fun house or something.  Can we say Batman and Robin?  Bright colors like a flashy red and does not make for an epic.  The tone of the movie is so dark and cynical yet the colors are so bright....  The direction is eye rollingly tedious.  Throughout the entire movie, he Zhang has to do sweeping camera pans and slow motion shots of battles that's probably been done in Hollywood 6 years ago and better as well.  Hair becoming disarrayed in slow motion, characters over dramatically taking their robes off before a fight...!  Please stop trying to make a Hollywood movie, Zhang!Jay Chow was very poorly cast.  Chow Yun Fat's mandarin is the epitome of HONG KONG style mandarin.  Gong Li's talents are just wasted portratying a one dimensional character.  Everything is just overly dramatic to the point of nausea.  Everyone is backstabbing each other for no real apparent reason, that's basically the 'plot'.  This might be all right if they weren't a bunch of wooden one dimensional characters.If you want to watch a good Zhang Yimou movie and a great one in general, watch Raise the Red Lantern.

1050270,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000MRA592,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[5, 7]","The hardest thing to do with this film is explaining exactly what it's about. You have an emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) who has been away taking care of business but is now returning home for the chrysanthemum festival. You have an Empress who has been waiting for him to return home for even longer than he's been gone. His wife grew lonely and turned to her stepson for love among other things. Then there's her maternal sons, Prince Jai will be a great emperor and will stand by her side to the end. Prince Yu gets little love from either of his parents but he knows the little secret between his stepbrother and mother. There is so much that happens in the film that I can't tell anymore but most likely you'll put it together before it ends.With so much going on and so many characters there is truly little room for character development. So many other elements cover for the lack of character development that I stopped caring about it by the middle of the movie. One major example is the story, which was predictable but was written so well that I still enjoyed how it was pieced and how it unfolded. As seen in the previews it's obvious that this movie has beautiful settings, maybe the most beautiful and colorful I've ever seen. I'm not the type to really pay attention to costumes but the costumes in this movie were out of this world. The settings and costumes are what you notice first when the film opens.There aren't too many action scenes and this may actually get to some people but the story makes up for that too. The acting was all around great especially the newcomers. Chow Yun-Fat was great and he showed that he is an all around great actor and can play any roll. Of course Li Gong did a great job. I think that the action scenes that were in the movie were excellent but the CGI Zhang Yimou likes to use still gets on my nerves. It makes the fights look more fake than real but it wasn't used as much as it was in ""House of Flying Daggers"".I read some reviews for this film right before I went out to rent it and found them to basically say this film is mediocre. I was tempted to just forget about this film because of those comments but they didn't really make any good points as to why I shouldn't see it. I still had to see this film mostly because of the amazing and colorful preview. After seeing this movie I understand why it might not have reached some peoples expectations. The problem with Curse of the Golden Flower is the previews definitely advertise the film to have a pretty good amount of action or to be action packed. This film being from the same director of ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" I think a lot of action presented evenly throughout the film was expected. Though I understand this problem it was not one that I had with the film. You could say that it relies on its beautiful and I do mean beautiful settings but the story has some life in it as well. This is a great film and very much worth seeing but some people will love it and some will find flaws in it.

1050272,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000MRA592,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","Recalling the critical reviews of ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" upon its release, I seem to remember a pretty split decision. There were those that proclaimed the film a tawdry and violent melodrama while others declared it a beautiful epic. Well, in all fairness, it is a beautiful, yet tawdry, excessively violent melodramatic epic. And I mean that in all the best ways! Chinese director Zhang Yimou has put together an eye-popping spectacle of sets, costumes, and effects--complete with his customary flair for dreamlike action sequences and an astonishing color palette.Telling a soapy tale of dysfunction within Emperor Ping's clan circa The Tang Dynasty (928 A.D.), ""Curse"" has all the lurid ingredients of a modern-day potboiler. There are illicit affairs, murderous schemes, generational secrets, and gruesome acts of violence. Similar to the setup of ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Curse"" brings the Ping family together and lets them attack each other with a refreshingly unhinged viciousness. But while ""Lion's"" carnage was largely verbal, no such claim can be made with this film. With elements of ""King Lear"" firmly in place, the pace of ""Curse"" accelerates so rapidly--you know the characters are headed for disaster.Central to the remarkable cast is the gorgeous Gong Li as the Empress. As the catalyst of most of the film's action, Li is the film's most pivotal performer. The female center of this ""Flower"" (which includes Chow Yun Fat as her husband and their three sons/heirs), Li practically devours the role. Full of passion, rage, lust, and plenty of secrets--she has never been given a showier role and definitely rises to the occasion. The performances are so good, so alive, you want to stick with the tale to the bitter end. And no matter how outrageous this film can get (and the madcap finale certainly pushes conventional sensibilities), it is always grounded with the actors.Forget Shakespeare's most violent tragedies, ""Curse"" sports a body count that even the Bard would surely envy. Not since the wickedly over-the-top killing spree during the finale of DiPalma's ""Scarface"" has a movie devolved into such an unabashed show of bloody lunacy. Ridiculous at every turn, the film succeeds by embracing its excesses. The final showdown left me marveling at the staged choreography and laughing at the inspired, yet insane, debauchery. I won't contend that ""Curse"" is an artistic masterwork that rivals Yimou's previous films ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero""--but I will say that it is massive entertainment. A frantic, blood-soaked opera of lust and vengeance (with no apologies), I loved ""Curse of the Golden Flower.""

His ""Raise the Red Lantern"" was nominated for a Best Foreign Language film Oscar in 1991 as was ""Hero"" in 2002.  ""Curse of the Yellow Flower"" does not have the swashbuckling pyrotechnics of ""House of Flying Daggers,"" but it does have a domestic intimacy surrounded by the grandeur of the Chinese royal court.  Chow Yun-Fat from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" plays the ruthless emperor who kills his youngest son to protect his throne.  We watched the racing DVD ""Initial D"" with Chinese pop singer Jay Chou recently.  It is a real shift to watch him almost back-to-back with this film where he goes from heartbroken teen race car driver to martial arts prince in a period film.  What a stretch!  As Prince Jai who sides with the Empress, he does a great job of leading hordes of golden-uniformed soldiers into battle.  The battle sequences with the various armies color coded in gold, blue, red or silver is visually stunning.  Gong Li is one of the world's most accomplished actresses.  From ""Zhou Yu's Train"" to ""The Story of Qui Ju"" for which she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 1992 Venice Film Festival to ""Memoirs of Geisha"" for which she won Best Supporting Actress from the National Board of Review, she plays an array of characters.  As the Empress, her performance is subtle, nuanced and varied as she experiences madness and then the bitterness of discovery that she is being poisoned.  The odd note for the character is her love affair with her stepson, which seems a bit unusual by today's Western standards.  Liu Ye played the violinist Ma in his first film ""Balzac & the Little Chinese Seamstress.""  Here, as the middle son and crown prince, he plays a character not sure of himself & not desirous of power.  It proves a lethal dose as he tries to commit suicide before being run through by his younger sibling, Prince Yu played by Qin Junjie in his first film.  The supporting players are all fabulous including Ni Dahong as the doctor & Li Man as his daughter Chan.  While I didn't get her name, the woman who plays the doctor's wife turns in a superb performance.  The costume design is exquisite as reflected in the film's lone Oscar nomination for Yee Chung-man's Best Costumes.  Zhou Xiaoding's cinematography is also exquisite as reflected by awards from both the Boston & New York Film Critics Societies.  American films today rarely have a sense of classical tragedy such as Yimon's films can reflect.  Gong Li is worth the price of admission, but there is so much more.

This is one film that almost requires a repeat viewing due to many twists and turns of the story. Its a movie about a corrupt imperial family doing their utmost to backstabbed each other. There is really no ""good guys"" in this movie. If the son was dutiful to his mother, he was a traitor to his father. If the wife was being poisoned by her husband, she also committed incestous acts with her own stepson. Just one totally dyfunctional family heading toward ruins. But due to the complex nature of the plot, Chinese language with English subtitles as well as some poor editing done for the American released, this movie need to be seen twice before everything fall into place.Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li are two of the most recongizable Chinese actors out there and they both gave a strong performance that complemented each other. They were well supported by their supporting cast and production values of this movie proves to be strong. Directed by Ghang Yimou who did Hero and House of the Flying Daggers, the usages of colors and costumes in this movie make it visual feast for the eyes.I found the movie to be interesting and entertaining. The major weakness of this movie appears to be that its over edited. It pretty clear that the American version cut out few scenes here and there. The running time of 114 minutes appears to be too short. The only feature that come with this DVD, the making of this movie, it pretty clear that some parts of this movie have been cut for reasons unknown. But that does make the movie flow more jerky-like then smooth. It also short changed the story and the script, perhaps thinking that American audience may not have the patience to sit through a good story before the action.The DVD of this movie proves to be in an excellent shape. The images and colors proves to be vivid and shape. The 5.1 DD is pretty aggressive and clear. The only major featuratte of this DVD is the ""Making of"" feature that proves to be mildly interesting.Overall, a pretty spectacular film with a real meat of a story that got short changed by poor editing.

Without question the most visually ecstatic film since Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring.. Curse of the Golden Flower is more intoxicating than the empress' hourly medicine! What an actor Li Gong is, and gorgeous to look at. Yun Fat Chow is the first eminence of the whole piece, as he is in virtually every film he makes. I submit that in the end it isnt the camera's magnificence that triumphs, but a story of human destiny told with blood-burning intimacy. Far from being a ""martial arts"" film as it's often said, Curse of the Golden Flower flies from the curse of formula, bemoaning it in almost every scene, with exceeding interior beauty. It's a spiritual film perhaps BECAUSE of its operatic heart, who knows? The scenes are bewitching, riveting; the force of the actors' embodiments lifts the piece to wild heights, which is to say, toward the actual. From beginning to end, Li Gong carries the complete story in her face. Every minor part - the court doctor, his daughter - is spun with consummate finesse. Another treasure is this film's uncommonly beautiful score, subtly integrated as another and equal dimension of character. One of the finest movie scores in years. It's just one helluva movie! If we want 'historical' China and look for it everywhere, entertainment will rarely hand us the pivotal tool to crack the nut.

Visually, it is undeniably beautiful to take in, but unfortunately, it's just not enough to keep you interested. The dysfunction in this family is monumental. The emperor is poisoning his wife, but why?  By his own admission, he knew of her incestuous affair prior to poisoning her.  Why didn't he start poisoning her from the get go? He kills off his first wife (were they ever really married?) and her family but there isn't a plausible explanation as to why. Supposedly, because of his lust for power, he convinces Gong Li's father (a king no less) to give him her hand in marriage, but how?  He was a lowly captain. Why would a KING marry off his daughter to a captain.  How did he become emperor?  We find out later that his first wife did in fact survive and went on to marry the imperial doctor who showed kindness to her, unbeknownst to the emperor. How is that the emperor didn't know his own private physician's wife? It makes no sense.In the end, all the unaswered questions were too distracting.

1050286,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B000MRA592,Margaux Paschke,"[6, 7]","This film is a visual masterpiece.  This movie does not jump straight into battle between the Emperor and Empress (although when it does, the battle is amazing) but instead, slowly gathers momentum until it becomes an overwhelming force.  Be prepared to wait for the payoff but the waiting is well worth it.Sure the royal family is a soap opera dream with it's incest, murder, betrayal and greed.  But what stays with you long after the movie ends is the question - do the means justify the ends?  Did the Emperor really have to be that cold and calculating to secure and maintain his power to rule during the Tang Dynasty?  For me, the film had so many symbolic layers and nuances that it took me another viewing to fully appreciate every little detail the director placed just so.  Some were obvious like the name of the Empress (Phoenix) and some were more low key, like the hour ceremony, representing each phase of the moon (hour of the rabbit, dragon, etc.) and what follows.  Visually, this movie is just amazing with its color imagery and fluidity.  Each scene spoke volumes just through the direction alone, ignoring what was actually being said (or read).  The palace was obscene with luxury, especially compared to the Royal Inn and the constant juxaposition were another effective tool used in this movie with the most prominent being between the Emperor and Empress.The one problem I had with the movie - why did the Emperor want to destroy the Empress from the beginning of their personal bitter cold war?  Everything else was explained.  The Emperor wanted to destroy his first wife even though he loved her because she could not provide him the power he sought and stood in his way; he married Empress Phoenix to gain power (she was the neighboring king's daughter); he poisoned her slowly over a period of time because she was having an affair with his oldest son (her stepson) and public knowledge of this would ensure the death of his favorite son.  As a woman scorned the Empress wanted to hurt him in every way possible, even if it meant her own death.But the Empress was not counting on just how cruel and heartless the Emperor could be when his authority was challenged, for he was willing to facilitate the death of his surviving son.  Checkmate in his chilling game with the Empress.  Which brings me back to my earlier question - maybe the means do justify the ends.  Maybe the Emperor did have to be cruel to maintain rule (the seamless replacement of chrysanthemums and cleaning of the vast palace grounds after the massacre is testament to this - continuity of the dynasty no matter what) and his commitment to being Emperor was resolute even in the face of great personal loss.  Maybe the Empress did have to be so cruel in order to hurt the Emperor.  She had to use innocent people in order to get to the Emperor because he, himself was invulnerable.  But the lengths to which she was willing to go left me wondering.I believe the answer lies in the Chrysanthemum, the real main character of this movie.  In China, this golden flower symbolizes the sun (ruler) and also pleasure, social interaction and entertainment.  The Emperor and Empress enjoyed their cruel games and it had nothing to do with loftier ideals.  The Empress and Emperor smile with great satisfaction whenever they score a point.  Watch when the Empress sways one son to her side with her healthy tea medicine scene or pauses to air a dirty little secret of the Emperor's first wife that will kill two birds with one stone.  Watch the Emperor smirk as he sits back to watch his careful and oh so cutting machinations at the end.  That is unjustifiable.  My husband tells me I'm reading too much into it since all great rulers needed to exert absolute power by any means necessary to govern well.  This movie sparked a lot of discussion and everyone had an opinion.  I love it when movies manage to engage an audience to such a degree and I stand by my five stars.",5,truly amazing film that demands discussion,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,3963,"['film', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'not', 'jump', 'straight', 'battle', 'Emperor', 'Empress', 'when', 'battle', 'amazing', 'instead', 'slowly', 'gathers', 'momentum', 'overwhelming', 'force', 'Be', 'prepared', 'wait', 'payoff', 'waiting', 'well', 'worth', 'it.Sure', 'royal', 'family', 'soap', 'opera', 'dream', 'incest', 'murder', 'betrayal', 'greed', 'what', 'long', 'movie', 'question', 'do', 'means', 'justify', 'ends', 'Did', 'Emperor', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'cold', 'calculating', 'secure', 'maintain', 'power', 'rule', 'Tang', 'Dynasty', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'symbolic', 'layers', 'nuances', 'took', 'viewing', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'little', 'detail', 'director', 'placed', 'just', 'so', 'were', 'obvious', 'name', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'were', 'more', 'low', 'key', 'hour', 'ceremony', 'representing', 'phase', 'moon', 'hour', 'rabbit', 'dragon', 'etc', 'what', 'Visually', 'movie', 'just', 'amazing', 'color', 'imagery', 'fluidity', 'scene', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'just', 'direction', 'alone', 'ignoring', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'being', 'said', 'read', 'palace', 'was', 'obscene', 'luxury', 'especially', 'compared', 'Royal', 'Inn', 'constant', 'juxaposition', 'were', 'effective', 'tool', 'used', 'movie', 'most', 'prominent', 'being', 'Emperor', 'Empress.The', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'why', 'did', 'Emperor', 'want', 'destroy', 'Empress', 'beginning', 'personal', 'bitter', 'cold', 'war', 'Everything', 'else', 'was', 'explained', 'Emperor', 'wanted', 'destroy', 'first', 'wife', 'even', 'loved', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'power', 'sought', 'stood', 'way', 'married', 'Empress', 'Phoenix', 'gain', 'power', 'was', 'neighboring', 'king', 'daughter', 'poisoned', 'slowly', 'period', 'time', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'oldest', 'son', 'stepson', 'public', 'knowledge', 'would', 'ensure', 'death', 'favorite', 'son', 'woman', 'scorned', 'Empress', 'wanted', 'hurt', 'way', 'possible', 'even', 'meant', 'own', 'death.But', 'Empress', 'was', 'not', 'counting', 'just', 'how', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'Emperor', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'authority', 'was', 'challenged', 'was', 'willing', 'facilitate', 'death', 'surviving', 'son', 'Checkmate', 'chilling', 'game', 'Empress', 'Which', 'back', 'earlier', 'question', 'maybe', 'means', 'do', 'justify', 'ends', 'Maybe', 'Emperor', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'cruel', 'maintain', 'rule', 'seamless', 'replacement', 'chrysanthemums', 'cleaning', 'vast', 'palace', 'grounds', 'massacre', 'testament', 'continuity', 'dynasty', 'matter', 'what', 'commitment', 'being', 'Emperor', 'was', 'resolute', 'even', 'face', 'great', 'personal', 'loss', 'Maybe', 'Empress', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'cruel', 'order', 'hurt', 'Emperor', 'had', 'use', 'innocent', 'people', 'order', 'get', 'Emperor', 'was', 'invulnerable', 'lengths', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'left', 'believe', 'answer', 'Chrysanthemum', 'real', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'China', 'golden', 'flower', 'sun', 'ruler', 'also', 'pleasure', 'social', 'interaction', 'entertainment', 'Emperor', 'Empress', 'enjoyed', 'cruel', 'games', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'loftier', 'ideals', 'Empress', 'Emperor', 'smile', 'great', 'satisfaction', 'whenever', 'score', 'point', 'Watch', 'when', 'Empress', 'one', 'son', 'side', 'healthy', 'tea', 'medicine', 'scene', 'air', 'dirty', 'little', 'secret', 'Emperor', 'first', 'wife', 'will', 'kill', 'two', 'birds', 'one', 'stone', 'Watch', 'Emperor', 'smirk', 'back', 'watch', 'careful', 'oh', 'so', 'cutting', 'machinations', 'end', 'unjustifiable', 'husband', ""'m"", 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'great', 'rulers', 'needed', 'exert', 'absolute', 'power', 'means', 'necessary', 'govern', 'well', 'movie', 'sparked', 'lot', 'discussion', 'everyone', 'had', 'opinion', 'love', 'when', 'movies', 'manage', 'engage', 'audience', 'degree', 'stand', 'five', 'stars']",Curse of the Golden Flower

Lohrke,"[2, 3]","'curse of the golden flower' is a movie i anxiously waited to see.  after the great 'hero,' and excellent 'house of flying daggers,' i was very excited to at the prospect of a new zhang yimou film.a lot of the criticism aimed of 'curse' isn't unfounded. the plot is barely there, but 'curse' is more a study of family dynamics, loyalty, betrayal, dishonesty, hidden secrets, quasi-incestuous relationships, maternal love and paternal hatred than a grand and epic film.  most of the scenes are confined to the empress' quarters and surrounding palace. only one sequence that i can remember takes place outside the palace--and it's a great sequence (and the only one which really showcases the trademark wuxia acrobatics).chow yun-fat and gong li are both excellent in their roles of emperor and empress. chow yun-fat is almost frigtening in his cruelty (and i have to say that his salt-n-pepper goatee really works for him. he's an incredibly handsome man--which makes the emperor's cruelty all the more effective) and the ever-lovely gong li is terrific as the slowly-going-mad empress.  since it is more a character study, the burden of making the film watchable falls squarely on the the leads and they rise to the occassion, particularly gong li.  she does a nice job of evoking the viewer's empathy.zhang yimou is peerless when it comes to visual artisty. i suspect he blows 1/2 his budget on scenery. he crams so much into each you practically need to hit pause every 10 seconds just to take a look at the feasts that are his backgrounds.  as the title suggests, yellow is the color of choice in this film, and he always uses it effectively, even though it sometimes comes close to overwhelming the film.if there's a problem with 'curse,' it's that does drift a bit into the melodramatic, particularly as all the secrets are 'revealed' and each character's motivations become clear. since it is a tragedy, few people make it to the film's ending, and those deaths are bloody and, for the most part, graphic--particularly the emperor's flogging of his own son. which leads me to believe that the moral of 'curse of the golden flower' is this: don't, under any circumstance, mess with chow yun-fat. he'll knock you into the next decade and not lose a blink of sleep over it. i also found the ending a bit problematic and too vague. it's not that i need all the answers or a tidy bow around it, but the denoument is perplexing at best; and not to mention the score, which at a moment of supreme tragedy, sounds like the ending to an animated disney film. the music is fine on its own, but seems very inappropriate and distracts from the emotional bloodletting you've just experienced.in short, i enjoyed 'the curse of the golden flower,' but if you're not already a fan of zhang yimou and/or chinese cinema, you could probably just skip this one and go back to 'hero' or 'house of flying daggers.'(about the R rating -- it seems a bit on the severe side.  sure, it's bloody and violent during the last 40 minutes, but no more so than the average episode of '24,' so if you can handle that, you can handle this).",3,"not essential, but fine viewing all the same",1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,3113,"[""'curse"", 'golden', 'flower', 'movie', 'i', 'anxiously', 'waited', 'see', 'great', ""'hero"", 'excellent', ""'house"", 'flying', 'daggers', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'prospect', 'new', 'zhang', 'yimou', 'film.a', 'lot', 'criticism', 'aimed', ""'curse"", ""n't"", 'unfounded', 'plot', 'barely', 'there', 'more', 'study', 'family', 'dynamics', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'dishonesty', 'hidden', 'secrets', 'quasi-incestuous', 'relationships', 'maternal', 'love', 'paternal', 'hatred', 'grand', 'epic', 'film', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'confined', 'empress', 'quarters', 'surrounding', 'palace', 'only', 'one', 'sequence', 'i', 'can', 'remember', 'place', 'palace', 'great', 'sequence', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'trademark', 'wuxia', 'acrobatics', '.chow', 'yun-fat', 'gong', 'li', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'emperor', 'empress', 'chow', 'yun-fat', 'almost', 'frigtening', 'cruelty', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'salt-n-pepper', 'goatee', 'really', 'incredibly', 'handsome', 'man', 'emperor', 'cruelty', 'more', 'effective', 'ever-lovely', 'gong', 'li', 'terrific', 'slowly-going-mad', 'empress', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'burden', 'making', 'film', 'watchable', 'squarely', 'leads', 'rise', 'occassion', 'particularly', 'gong', 'li', 'nice', 'job', 'evoking', 'viewer', 'empathy.zhang', 'yimou', 'peerless', 'when', 'visual', 'artisty', 'i', 'suspect', '1/2', 'budget', 'scenery', 'so', 'much', 'practically', 'need', 'hit', 'pause', '10', 'seconds', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'feasts', 'are', 'backgrounds', 'title', 'color', 'choice', 'film', 'always', 'effectively', 'even', 'sometimes', 'close', 'overwhelming', 'film.if', 'problem', ""'curse"", 'drift', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'particularly', 'secrets', 'are', ""'revealed"", 'character', 'motivations', 'become', 'clear', 'tragedy', 'few', 'people', 'make', 'film', 'ending', 'deaths', 'are', 'bloody', 'most', 'part', 'graphic', 'particularly', 'emperor', 'flogging', 'own', 'son', 'believe', 'moral', ""'curse"", 'golden', 'flower', 'do', ""n't"", 'circumstance', 'mess', 'chow', 'yun-fat', ""'ll"", 'knock', 'next', 'decade', 'not', 'lose', 'blink', 'sleep', 'i', 'also', 'found', 'ending', 'bit', 'problematic', 'too', 'vague', 'not', 'i', 'need', 'answers', 'tidy', 'bow', 'denoument', 'perplexing', 'best', 'not', 'mention', 'score', 'moment', 'supreme', 'tragedy', 'ending', 'animated', 'disney', 'film', 'music', 'fine', 'own', 'very', 'inappropriate', 'distracts', 'emotional', 'bloodletting', ""'ve"", 'just', 'experienced.in', 'short', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'curse', 'golden', 'flower', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'zhang', 'yimou', 'chinese', 'cinema', 'could', 'probably', 'just', 'skip', 'one', 'go', 'back', ""'hero"", ""'house"", 'flying', 'daggers', 'R', 'rating', 'bit', 'severe', 'side', 'sure', 'bloody', 'violent', 'last', '40', 'minutes', 'more', 'so', 'average', 'episode', ""'24"", 'so', 'can', 'handle', 'can', 'handle']",Curse of the Golden Flower

Chow Yun Fat playing the Emperor is seriously Oscar worthy.  Best acting performance I have seen in a few years.  His presence is downright scary.  The story is about the Emperor's sons, one of which is having an affair with the Emperor's wife.  The movie flows along nicely, has great acting, and great music.  The music is not as good as 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers', but it is a much different score.  While there is plenty of engaging drama, the action really bugged me.  There is at least 20 minutes of action, but they obviously didn't put enough time into it.  The first action scene is absolutely mesmerizing, and I could have used at least 1 more good fight.  When the final battle sequence comes, it is just plain ugly.  Yimou was clearly just trying to outdo himself, but the last battle has way too much CGI and not enough real fighting.  I think the movie would have been a lot better if we didn't actually see the action.I am a huge fan of Shaw Brothers movies and having a great love for their intricate sets, I found Curse to be a visual feast.

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[6, 10]","Allusions to _The Lion in Winter_ while discussing _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are well-earned, because in the beginning there do seem to be some similarities--the current emperor (Chow Yun Fat), relatively late in his years as ruler, has some disagreement when it comes to naming the successor among his three sons.  His wife (Gong Li) of course has her own plans.But what is the essence of royal family drama if it is NOT the squabbles that go on in regards to succession?  This has been the stuff of Shakespeare and even before, so while some parallels to _The Lion in Winter_ may seem obvious, _Winter_ explores a bit more of the powerful connection and disparity between love and power, while _Curse of the Golden Flower_ seems to dwell mostly on the essence of family secrets themselves.  While the secrets aren't all that much of a surprise (and I tend to think shouldn't be, for the film's focus seems to be out to present the intricacies of secrets among royal family members and the anguish they cause), they do combine to create a web of deceit that this family seems to tread upon each day, knowing of each other's deceit and yet co-existing (to an extent) at the same time......until, of course, those secrets come full circle at the Festival of Chrysanthemums, where all will be revealed...Of course, since this is directed by Yimou Zhang, there are spectacular and thickly casted sequences to be expected, and Zhang does not disappoint.  With this film and _Hero_, Zhang presents the awe and spectacle and the power of the emperial days in a way that _300_ could only put as a backdrop, but the sheer walls of humanity that are used in some of the stunning fight sequences of _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are amazing to behold.  Ancient warfare has finally been dealt with cinematically the way historians have known about it for decades--as an organized force of awesome power.  But Zhang also keeps the awesome visuals to moments even as small as the announcing of the hour in the hallways of the palace, or in sneak attacks on the Emperor's enemies.The battles and visuals of _Curse of the Golden Flower_ are a wonder to behold, especially in the second hour, but the flow of this movie falls victim to the slower moments of _Hero_, when the storyline circulates too much in one spot in a way that doesn't really forward the story, but muddles itself in a fascination for the distrust the royals hold for each other.  Since this has been a theme for centuries, it might have been more productive to have let that web of secrets tell us something further about humanity, rather than look simply at who might be a little better at this secrets game than others.",3,The awe of _300_ with more intrigue behind it,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,2678,"['Allusions', '_The', 'Lion', 'Winter_', 'discussing', '_Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower_', 'are', 'well-earned', 'beginning', 'there', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'similarities', 'current', 'emperor', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'relatively', 'late', 'years', 'ruler', 'disagreement', 'when', 'naming', 'successor', 'three', 'sons', 'wife', 'Gong', 'Li', 'course', 'own', 'plans.But', 'what', 'essence', 'royal', 'family', 'drama', 'NOT', 'squabbles', 'go', 'regards', 'succession', 'been', 'stuff', 'Shakespeare', 'even', 'before', 'parallels', '_The', 'Lion', 'Winter_', 'may', 'seem', 'obvious', '_Winter_', 'bit', 'more', 'powerful', 'connection', 'disparity', 'love', 'power', '_Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower_', 'dwell', 'mostly', 'essence', 'family', 'secrets', 'secrets', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'that', 'much', 'surprise', 'tend', 'think', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'focus', 'be', 'out', 'present', 'intricacies', 'secrets', 'royal', 'family', 'members', 'anguish', 'cause', 'do', 'combine', 'create', 'web', 'deceit', 'family', 'tread', 'day', 'knowing', 'other', 'deceit', 'yet', 'co-existing', 'extent', 'same', 'time', 'course', 'secrets', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'Festival', 'Chrysanthemums', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'course', 'directed', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'are', 'spectacular', 'thickly', 'casted', 'sequences', 'be', 'expected', 'Zhang', 'not', 'disappoint', 'film', '_Hero_', 'Zhang', 'awe', 'spectacle', 'power', 'emperial', 'days', 'way', '_300_', 'could', 'only', 'put', 'backdrop', 'sheer', 'walls', 'humanity', 'are', 'used', 'stunning', 'fight', 'sequences', '_Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower_', 'are', 'amazing', 'behold', 'Ancient', 'warfare', 'finally', 'been', 'dealt', 'cinematically', 'way', 'historians', 'have', 'known', 'decades', 'organized', 'force', 'awesome', 'power', 'Zhang', 'also', 'awesome', 'visuals', 'moments', 'even', 'as', 'small', 'announcing', 'hour', 'hallways', 'palace', 'sneak', 'attacks', 'Emperor', 'enemies.The', 'battles', 'visuals', '_Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower_', 'are', 'wonder', 'behold', 'especially', 'second', 'hour', 'flow', 'movie', 'victim', 'slower', 'moments', '_Hero_', 'when', 'storyline', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'spot', 'way', ""n't"", 'really', 'forward', 'story', 'fascination', 'distrust', 'royals', 'hold', 'other', 'been', 'theme', 'centuries', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'productive', 'have', 'let', 'web', 'secrets', 'tell', 'something', 'further', 'humanity', 'rather', 'look', 'simply', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'secrets', 'game', 'others']",Curse of the Golden Flower

The film is incredibly beautiful: the Chinese landscapes, the sets, the costumes, the music, and all of the details.

But there is one failing often left out of political science texts, but which is central to this movie.  That is, in a dictatorship, there is no safe, established, and sanctioned way for those near the center of power to air their grievances against others at similar or higher positions of power.  Instead, the court of power becomes a perpetual soap opera full of betrayal, backstabbing, hidden schemes and hollowed rituals.This movie is about the imperial family of China, set sometime in the Tang dynasty.  The Empress is sleeping with her adopted son, but the Emperor risks public shame if this is revealed.  He is slowly poisoning her, but she cannot refuse the poison without disobeying his royal command.  The adopted son is unknowingly having sex with his half-sister.  The royal family's oldest natural son has too many expectations placed on his shoulder, while the youngest son is not given the respect and responsibilities he desires.  All these conflicts become public and get settled via sharp weapons in the movie's climax and conclusion.  The result is a bloodbath in the Imperial Palace and the surrounding countryside.Unlike other recent Chinese action imports to America, this movie takes place mainly indoors, and in brightly lit rooms.  The martial-arts action is kept to a minimum as most of the violence occurs with metal weapons in grand war scenes.  Hence there is no walking on water, or running up the sides of walls a la Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  There are also no magic weapons or mythology; only family feuding that makes King Lear's family look like the Brady Bunch.The DVD plays the movie with either Chinese or English speech, which is a nice plus.  I suggest watching the movie in Chinese, with English subtitles, as the English voice-overs are really cheesy.  The violence is graphic, hence the R rating.  However, the pushed-up busoms are as risque as the movie gets; so no sex or nudity whatsoever.  All in all, a good, but very depressing movie.",3,Curse of the screwed-up family,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,2215,"['Historians', 'give', 'many', 'reasons', 'failings', 'dictatorship', 'style', 'government', 'such', 'suppression', 'freedom', 'lack', 'open', 'communication', 'centralized', 'decision-making', 'bureaucratic', 'inertia', 'violent', 'succession', 'etc', 'one', 'failing', 'often', 'left', 'out', 'political', 'science', 'texts', 'central', 'movie', 'dictatorship', 'safe', 'established', 'sanctioned', 'way', 'center', 'power', 'air', 'grievances', 'others', 'similar', 'higher', 'positions', 'power', 'Instead', 'court', 'power', 'perpetual', 'soap', 'full', 'betrayal', 'backstabbing', 'hidden', 'schemes', 'hollowed', 'rituals.This', 'movie', 'imperial', 'family', 'China', 'set', 'sometime', 'Tang', 'dynasty', 'Empress', 'sleeping', 'adopted', 'son', 'Emperor', 'public', 'shame', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'poisoning', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'poison', 'disobeying', 'royal', 'command', 'adopted', 'son', 'unknowingly', 'having', 'sex', 'half-sister', 'royal', 'family', 'oldest', 'natural', 'son', 'too', 'many', 'expectations', 'placed', 'shoulder', 'youngest', 'son', 'not', 'given', 'respect', 'responsibilities', 'conflicts', 'become', 'public', 'get', 'settled', 'sharp', 'weapons', 'movie', 'climax', 'conclusion', 'result', 'bloodbath', 'Imperial', 'Palace', 'surrounding', 'countryside.Unlike', 'other', 'recent', 'Chinese', 'action', 'imports', 'America', 'movie', 'place', 'mainly', 'indoors', 'brightly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'martial-arts', 'action', 'kept', 'minimum', 'most', 'violence', 'metal', 'weapons', 'grand', 'war', 'scenes', 'Hence', 'walking', 'water', 'running', 'up', 'sides', 'walls', 'la', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'are', 'also', 'magic', 'weapons', 'mythology', 'only', 'family', 'feuding', 'King', 'Lear', 'family', 'look', 'Brady', 'Bunch.The', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Chinese', 'English', 'speech', 'nice', 'plus', 'suggest', 'watching', 'movie', 'Chinese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'English', 'voice-overs', 'are', 'really', 'cheesy', 'violence', 'graphic', 'hence', 'R', 'rating', 'However', 'pushed-up', 'busoms', 'are', 'as', 'risque', 'movie', 'so', 'sex', 'nudity', 'whatsoever', 'good', 'very', 'depressing', 'movie']",Curse of the Golden Flower

His best films like ""Huozhe"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" are most certainly classics of modern Cinema.""Curse Of The Golden Flower"" is not.In fact the star of this film is the Production Design. Normally that distinction goes to an actor.My first problem with the film was with the musical score. It was an overly bombastic choral score that detracted from the visuals and performances. Simple dialogue scenes were pervaded by this histrionic music as if commanding the desired emotions at the desired moment. It failed on all counts.The film is essentially an old fashioned melodrama. Some of the performances take us back to the acting style of the early silent picture days. The Martial Arts also strike a false note. They seem out of place in what is essentially a family melodrama.The Battle scenes also have the aspect of a computer game. Ranks of CGI soldiers fill every inch of the screen and charge in a very controlled non-human way. This computer manipulation of great armies may make the directors life easy but it strips away any sense of human nature.Li Gong holds the bare threads of this film together with another strong performance.Yimou Zhang is resting on his technique as a Director. There are also an extra-ordinary amount of close-ups in this film as if he was making a drama for television. He makes no attempt to try something new. He uses motifs we have seen before.

The Empress Phoenix, his wife, is far from happy to see his return. Ping has ordered his imperial doctor to slowly poison the empress. And, in retaliation, the Empress conspires to overthrow her husband. As hatreds fester and secret passions come to light, no one will remain untouched by the Curse of the Golden Flower.The Director Yimou Zhang follows up House of Flying Daggers and Hero with his most lavish epic yet. Curse of the Golden Flower is an extraordinary film. It is a big-budget extravaganza that is reminiscent of some of the Hollywood epics of the fifties and sixties. As with all Zhang's western exports, his use of colour is incredible. The palace of Emperor Ping is brought to the screen in a blaze of arresting colour. Every costume and set create a world of sumptuous majesty a world that you will be immediately drawn into.Of course, like all Asian Cinema, this film has the usual martial arts set pieces throughout, but it does not seem to rely on them to keep the audience interested. Instead, the film uses a complex plot involving the power struggle between the two leads. Chow Yun Fat, as Ping, presents a character who is ruthless and dogmatic, and Gong Li's Empress Phoenix is vulnerable and defiant. Both stars' perfomances are beyond reproach, and all of these qualities come together to create a gloriously opulent saga.The Curse of the Golden Flower is an epic filled with intrigue and breathtakingly-bloody battle scenes, all set against a backdrop of radiantly decadent colour.

The sheer beauty of every scene can lead the viever perhaps to discount the power of the acting and the story. It is a study of power and evil.

Gong Li is an icy beauty and she's dressed up here in clothes that befit the empress she plays. She has an entourage of scantily-clad beauties; the sets are gorgeous; the acting is good; the story is Shakespearean in its intensity and melodrama.There's a lot of ""Lady MacBeth"" and Aescylus in this tale of a dysfunctional -- that's putting it mildly -- royal family in China one thousand years ago.

1050330,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000MRA592,Steve,"[2, 4]","Like most reviewers, I agree that this is a visually stunning movie. The plot is heavy on the Shakespeare and as such it leaves much up to the viewer to seek answers to the questions that arise. The acting is well done throughout, especially Gong Li and Jay Chou who portrays the natural son of Gong Li's Phoenix character. According to the special features he is a newcomer to the screen, having made his mark as a pop star. I'm impressed, especially given the high rate of failure in such a career move. Chow Yun-Fat is good but was a bit over-the-top to me, flaring his nostrils and popping his eyes to convey emotion. Still, there is a scene late in the movie that was as hard to watch as I'm sure it was hard to act. You'll know it when you see it and it shows much more accurately why he (along with Gong Li) are such widely acclaimed cinematic actors.The movie packs a lot in, from the excessively opulent sets and eye candy to the Greek tragedy levels of bloodshed that come at the climax of the film. When it's all said and done, however, I felt a bit letdown at the lack of substance that I took away from the film. The action sequences leaned heavily on huge battles scenes rife with CGI trickery instead of one-on-one duals. Yes, both are jaw-dropping, but I simply prefer the latter. This movie might be your cup of tea and there is much to enjoy from a purely sensory level, but it wasn't as emotionally gratifying as I'd hoped.",3,Wow!

1050332,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000MRA592,trashcanman,"[8, 11]","""Curse of the Golden Flower"" is a fantastic film with the most eye-poppingly gorgeous sets I've ever seen and a plot worthy of the Bard himself, yet it somehow falls short of the perfection of Zhang Yimou's previous films, ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"".  The acting is brilliant; Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li give the kind of nuanced performances that you seldom see in American films and if you are still raving about ""Wild Hogs"" or ""Night at the Museum"" be assured that you will miss almost everything that makes this film great.  The plot revolves around the members of a royal family, a stiff and formal bunch even by imperial dynastic standards.  You see, the emperor is an eccentric fellow, absolutely unshakeable in his belief that all things have their place and each must serve their purpose to a T.  Watching the family interact is uncomfortable to begin with, and as the film progresses we see what lies beneath the layers of this family's veil of propriety.  Believe me, it ain't pretty.  Each member of the family plays their role as they are expected too, but the end result is far from the order that their patriarch craves so much; what eventually comes out of this perfect family is utter and complete chaos. While the story slowly unfolds and builds toward the momentous climaxes, we are treated to the wonderful sights of the imperial palace, which is like a character unto itself in the movie, so beautiful that it even forced mine eyes to veer away from the always-enchanting Gong Li on several occasions.  The first few acts will no doubt bore your average movie-goer looking for the superb action scenes that we've come to expect from these high-profile Chinese period pieces, and that's where this film loses a star.  The film takes so long building up that the feast for the eyes that is the palace almost takes it over.  Besides the lavish sets and extravagant costumes, there isn't much to do but wait for something to happen.  The actors are forced to remain perfectly neutral and formal as their characters command and, while Gong Li can speak volumes with just her eyes, it's not something most folks are going to want to watch for an hour and a half before the ninja attack.  Oh yes, there are ninjas. It's no secret that Zhang Yimou has an eye for exceptional action shots and he upholds this mantle in several scenes as well as a large-scale battle that sees the beautiful palace's surrounding field of golden flowers trampled and replaced with a pile of corpses.  There are some things I'd love to give away in order to illustrate the brilliance of the character development, but I'm afraid it would spoil the ending.  If you look at film as a true art form, are in the mood for a subtle-yet-epic Shakepearian tale, or enjoy the films of Akira Kurosawa, your prayers have been answered;  buy this film.  But if you just saw the commercial on tv and thought everybody'd be kung-fu fighting then give ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" a pass and have a look at ""Hero"" instead; a slightly superior film to this one that manages to give you all the action, drama, romance, and visual poetry one can fit into one film.",4,Beautiful and nuanced filmmaking,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,3145,"['Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'fantastic', 'film', 'most', 'eye-poppingly', 'gorgeous', 'sets', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plot', 'worthy', 'Bard', 'yet', 'short', 'perfection', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'previous', 'films', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'Gong', 'Li', 'give', 'kind', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'seldom', 'see', 'American', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'raving', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'Night', 'Museum', 'be', 'assured', 'will', 'miss', 'almost', 'everything', 'film', 'great', 'plot', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'stiff', 'formal', 'bunch', 'even', 'imperial', 'dynastic', 'standards', 'see', 'emperor', 'eccentric', 'fellow', 'absolutely', 'unshakeable', 'belief', 'things', 'have', 'place', 'must', 'serve', 'purpose', 'T.', 'Watching', 'family', 'interact', 'uncomfortable', 'begin', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'beneath', 'layers', 'family', 'veil', 'propriety', 'Believe', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'member', 'family', 'role', 'are', 'expected', 'too', 'end', 'result', 'far', 'order', 'patriarch', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'eventually', 'perfect', 'family', 'utter', 'complete', 'chaos', 'story', 'slowly', 'unfolds', 'momentous', 'climaxes', 'are', 'treated', 'wonderful', 'sights', 'imperial', 'palace', 'character', 'unto', 'movie', 'so', 'beautiful', 'even', 'forced', 'mine', 'eyes', 'veer', 'away', 'always-enchanting', 'Gong', 'Li', 'several', 'occasions', 'first', 'few', 'acts', 'will', 'doubt', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'looking', 'superb', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'high-profile', 'Chinese', 'period', 'pieces', 'where', 'film', 'star', 'film', 'so', 'long', 'building', 'up', 'feast', 'eyes', 'palace', 'almost', 'over', 'lavish', 'sets', 'extravagant', 'costumes', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', 'wait', 'something', 'happen', 'actors', 'are', 'forced', 'remain', 'perfectly', 'neutral', 'formal', 'characters', 'command', 'Gong', 'Li', 'can', 'speak', 'volumes', 'just', 'eyes', 'not', 'something', 'most', 'folks', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'hour', 'half', 'ninja', 'attack', 'Oh', 'yes', 'are', 'ninjas', 'secret', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'eye', 'exceptional', 'action', 'shots', 'mantle', 'several', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'large-scale', 'battle', 'beautiful', 'palace', 'surrounding', 'field', 'golden', 'flowers', 'trampled', 'replaced', 'pile', 'corpses', 'are', 'things', ""'d"", 'love', 'give', 'away', 'order', 'illustrate', 'brilliance', 'character', 'development', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'would', 'spoil', 'ending', 'look', 'film', 'true', 'art', 'form', 'are', 'mood', 'subtle-yet-epic', 'Shakepearian', 'tale', 'enjoy', 'films', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'prayers', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'buy', 'film', 'just', 'saw', 'commercial', 'tv', 'thought', 'everybody', ""'d"", 'be', 'kung-fu', 'fighting', 'then', 'give', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'pass', 'have', 'look', 'Hero', 'instead', 'slightly', 'superior', 'film', 'one', 'give', 'action', 'drama', 'romance', 'visual', 'poetry', 'one', 'can', 'fit', 'one', 'film']",Curse of the Golden Flower
1050333,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000MRA592,Trevor Willsmer,"[6, 6]","Curse of the Golden Flower is a step up in budget from Zhang Yimou's Hero and House of Flying Daggers, but it's a step back in terms of drama: much that glitters, little that's gold. Set in a palace where everything is a spectacular and highly regimented ritual done on an epic scale, whether it is servants dressing by the hundreds or preparing food and medicine, it focuses on the kind of royal family who make the Plantageneats in The Lion in Winter look like the Waltons. He's poisoning her, she's planning a coup against him and the Crown Prince has gone from an affair with his stepmom to one with his half-sister... Yet for all the poisoning and plotting the problem is that it's rather dull. It never descends into outright boredom, but it doesn't particularly engage for most of the first two thirds.As usual with Yimou, the moral of the tale is ambiguous: on one level it could be don't go against the natural order, no matter how unfair it seems (father knows best, even if he is poisoning mum), on another it could be know your place no matter how inexplicably cruel you may find the ruling regime. Or it could just be a good old-fashioned tragedy with unhappy endings all round. On a more dramatically successful film maybe the ambiguity wouldn't be so niggling, but with such huge resources thrown at it to such little effect, you feel that it should all add up to SOMETHING.True, a lot of money has been visibly lavished on the film, but it rarely feels wisely spent. That the corridors of the palace look like they've been designed by a Bombay stallholder with unlimited funds, more garish than opulent, make many of the interiors look more a monument to bad taste than a glittering faade to hide the corruption within. The wonderfully conceived use of colour and design of Hero and House of Flying Daggers here gives way to visual overkill. Forget the golden flower, this definitely suffers from the curse of too much CGi in the final battle as the addition of an increasingly unfeasible number of perfectly synchronized digital extras completely swamp the human element the scene needs to succeed. When the CGi golden army attacks the palace it doesn't really impress as much as it should - the CGi is good enough, but it's also too controlled and uniform, lacking the feeling of spontaneity you get with real extras. Maybe it's just that the look is so overexposed that digital extras seem too much of a cheat to impress the way that going to all the trouble of using the real thing did. After all, when so much is done in the computer, what physical human effort is left to admire?Nor does the individual fight choreography impress as much as in Yimou's previous films. There is even some surprisingly clumsy editing of mismatched shots in the `smaller' scenes that make you wonder whether Yimou wants to draw attention to them or simply doesn't care enough to finesse them. Perhaps it's telling that the film's most visually effective moment is the massive co-ordinated cleanup operation after the battle as the bodies are dragged away and the palace is quickly restored to normality and that only the film's final scene has the kind of real emotional power that the rest of the film could have done with.It seems oddly significant that despite the epic scale, only 8 of the cast are credited while the crew, designers, costumers and computer technicians are billed at great length: people really don't seem to be the film's priority. That's sadly reflected in some of the performances. Perhaps it's because the once prolific Chow Yun Fat has worked so little this century that it's genuinely surprising to see how much he's visibly aged as the Emperor. While this is used to some effect, we rarely see why he does what he does, which tends to render him more of a shallow villain when the circumstances really merit. It's certainly hard to see him as the wronged party when his revenge is so ruthless and calculated. But sadly most of the performances are decidedly one-note while the cast wait for their big scenes, with only the female cast making much impression (the film is good on the submissive role women were forced to accept). Yet as good as Jin Chen is as the Emperor's wronged first wife, it's Gong Li who really impresses, and how. As the Empress trying to hold onto her sanity long enough to depose her husband before his poisoned medicine turns her into a living ghost she's remarkably powerful without ever overstating: it's the small details rather than the grand gestures that really count with her. Unfortunately as her stepson and lover, Ye Liu overacts the sensitive angst almost enough to make Nicholas Tse look subtle, yet somehow in their scenes together Gong Li still manages to keep them from sliding away into pure melodrama. Sadly, her efforts are never quite enough to make up for the film's shortcomings.",2,"Much that glitters, little that's gold",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,4856,"['Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'step', 'up', 'budget', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'step', 'back', 'terms', 'drama', 'much', 'glitters', 'little', 'gold', 'Set', 'palace', 'where', 'everything', 'spectacular', 'highly', 'regimented', 'ritual', 'done', 'epic', 'scale', 'servants', 'dressing', 'hundreds', 'preparing', 'food', 'medicine', 'kind', 'royal', 'family', 'who', 'make', 'Plantageneats', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'look', 'Waltons', 'poisoning', 'planning', 'coup', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'gone', 'affair', 'stepmom', 'one', 'half-sister', 'poisoning', 'plotting', 'problem', 'rather', 'dull', 'never', 'outright', 'boredom', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'engage', 'most', 'first', 'two', 'thirds.As', 'usual', 'Yimou', 'moral', 'tale', 'ambiguous', 'one', 'level', 'could', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'natural', 'order', 'matter', 'how', 'unfair', 'father', 'best', 'even', 'poisoning', 'mum', 'could', 'be', 'know', 'place', 'matter', 'how', 'inexplicably', 'cruel', 'may', 'find', 'ruling', 'regime', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'tragedy', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'round', 'more', 'dramatically', 'successful', 'film', 'maybe', 'ambiguity', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'niggling', 'such', 'huge', 'resources', 'thrown', 'such', 'little', 'effect', 'feel', 'should', 'add', 'up', 'SOMETHING.True', 'lot', 'money', 'been', 'visibly', 'lavished', 'film', 'rarely', 'wisely', 'spent', 'corridors', 'palace', 'look', ""'ve"", 'been', 'designed', 'Bombay', 'stallholder', 'unlimited', 'funds', 'more', 'garish', 'opulent', 'make', 'many', 'interiors', 'look', 'more', 'monument', 'bad', 'taste', 'glittering', 'faade', 'hide', 'corruption', 'wonderfully', 'conceived', 'use', 'colour', 'design', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'here', 'way', 'visual', 'overkill', 'Forget', 'golden', 'flower', 'definitely', 'suffers', 'curse', 'too', 'much', 'CGi', 'final', 'battle', 'addition', 'increasingly', 'unfeasible', 'number', 'perfectly', 'synchronized', 'digital', 'extras', 'completely', 'swamp', 'human', 'element', 'scene', 'succeed', 'When', 'CGi', 'golden', 'army', 'palace', ""n't"", 'really', 'impress', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'CGi', 'good', 'enough', 'also', 'too', 'controlled', 'uniform', 'lacking', 'feeling', 'spontaneity', 'get', 'real', 'extras', 'Maybe', 'just', 'look', 'so', 'overexposed', 'digital', 'extras', 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'cheat', 'impress', 'way', 'going', 'trouble', 'using', 'real', 'thing', 'did', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'done', 'computer', 'what', 'physical', 'human', 'effort', 'left', 'admire', 'individual', 'fight', 'choreography', 'impress', 'as', 'much', 'Yimou', 'previous', 'films', 'even', 'surprisingly', 'clumsy', 'editing', 'mismatched', 'shots', 'smaller', 'scenes', 'make', 'wonder', 'Yimou', 'draw', 'attention', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'finesse', 'Perhaps', 'telling', 'film', 'most', 'visually', 'effective', 'moment', 'massive', 'co-ordinated', 'cleanup', 'operation', 'battle', 'bodies', 'are', 'dragged', 'away', 'palace', 'quickly', 'restored', 'normality', 'only', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'kind', 'real', 'emotional', 'power', 'rest', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'with.It', 'oddly', 'significant', 'epic', 'scale', 'only', '8', 'cast', 'are', 'credited', 'crew', 'designers', 'costumers', 'computer', 'technicians', 'are', 'billed', 'great', 'length', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'film', 'priority', 'sadly', 'reflected', 'performances', 'Perhaps', 'once', 'prolific', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'worked', 'so', 'little', 'century', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'visibly', 'aged', 'Emperor', 'used', 'effect', 'rarely', 'see', 'why', 'what', 'render', 'more', 'shallow', 'villain', 'when', 'circumstances', 'really', 'merit', 'certainly', 'hard', 'see', 'wronged', 'party', 'when', 'revenge', 'so', 'ruthless', 'calculated', 'sadly', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'decidedly', 'one-note', 'cast', 'wait', 'big', 'scenes', 'only', 'female', 'cast', 'making', 'much', 'impression', 'film', 'good', 'submissive', 'role', 'women', 'were', 'forced', 'accept', 'as', 'good', 'Jin', 'Chen', 'Emperor', 'wronged', 'first', 'wife', 'Gong', 'Li', 'who', 'really', 'how', 'Empress', 'trying', 'hold', 'sanity', 'long', 'enough', 'depose', 'husband', 'poisoned', 'medicine', 'living', 'ghost', 'remarkably', 'powerful', 'ever', 'overstating', 'small', 'details', 'rather', 'grand', 'gestures', 'really', 'count', 'Unfortunately', 'stepson', 'lover', 'Ye', 'Liu', 'sensitive', 'angst', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'Nicholas', 'Tse', 'look', 'subtle', 'yet', 'somehow', 'scenes', 'together', 'Gong', 'Li', 'still', 'keep', 'sliding', 'away', 'pure', 'melodrama', 'Sadly', 'efforts', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'shortcomings']",Curse of the Golden Flower

The cinematography and special effects were great. The Behind-the-Scenes feature captured a lot of the mystery involved in the special effects, and the interviews with the cast were enlightening and humorous, giving us a peak inside thier true personalities.  Chow Yun-Fat provides an awesome performance.  It's not Gong Li's best, but she is, as usual, believable.  I'm a new fan!The idea for the story is good, but the delivery lacks - no fault of the actors, it's the script.  There are some areas where the lines are not believable and the best of actors might have a hard time pulling that off.  The movie also felt a bit rushed.

Everything indoors is gold or brilliant color. Ritual, costume, jewelry, even golden makeup all contribute to color that almost screams off the screen. Then, towards the end, the sheer mass of humanity involved (even if CGI) made the ""cast of thousands"" cliche seem paltry. China has had many things in its history, but first has always been the overwhelming numbers of its populace. For all that, this isn't a movie about its appearance.It's about revenge, intrigue, honor, and the appearance of honor - sometimes the opposite of honor itself. Year after year, layer after layer of subterfuge accretes, until every loyalty and most disloyaties are torn in multiple directions.

The royal family has many terrible secrets. That's the basic plot. Although the semblance of a full story is attempted, it never really develops entirely, which leaves the viewer with many questions and much confusion when the credits finally roll.Also, there's not much action although the preview consisted almost entirely of action. So, a misleading preview is another downfall of this film. The problem is that at its core Curse of the Golden Flower is an intimate family portrait of a royal family that is falling apart. But the characters aren't developed enough (or likeable enough) to keep the viewer's attention, or to pull any heartstrings.The lavish costumes and sets are beautiful to look at, but they start to blend into each other when everything is the same goldish color.

Zhang Yimou is renowned for sumptuous dramas like Raise the Red Lantern, and epics such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. In Curse of the Golden Flower, we are given an intimate look at the dysfunctional Imperial Family of China, headed by the Emperor [played with consummate skill by Chow Yun Fatt], the Empress Phoenix [Gong Li, as lustrous as always], and his three sons, the Crown Prince [who was borne by an earlier wife], Prince Jai [whose loyalty to his mother is without equal], and young Prince Cheng. Dark secrets and evil machinations dominate throughout the film, and we see the gradual destruction of the Imperial Family due to lies, internal strife and treachery from within the ranks. The acting is good, especially Gong Li's, as she speaks eloquently with a glance or gesture, making her meaning plain without dialogue.
