972446,A2PXDVKKE8TFZV,B000EGDN6S,BAGS,"[6, 6]","I'm an intermediate who prefers basic choreography. The choreography in Go is the most basic of any I have tried. Even the workout that came with my step was more complex than this one. I really would recommend this to the true beginner, but as an intermediate I still enjoyed it and got a good workout. Kari Anderson tends not to cue which leg leads, and this workout is no exception. However, these routines are so simple that it's not really a problem. She does a move on the right leg first, then does the same move on the left. It's not hard to figure out. Any reviewer who thinks this choreography is too complicated for a true beginner, I wonder if they have done any other step workouts. I don't think you'll get any simpler than this, unless all you want to do is basic stepping up and down. If you want to learn moves that you will use in future workouts, like ""around the world"" or ""corner to corner,"" I would recommend this video for some good instruction.What's good about this workout for the beginner is:1. The combos aren't long, there aren't a lot of different moves to remember at the same time.2. Once you do a combo you ""throw it away"" so you don't have to remember it for later.3. She has you do a basic step or march while she previews harder moves, so you get to see it and hear the explaination before you attempt the move.4. Different modifications are shown so you can make the moves more intense as you get better at stepping.5. The camera stays in place, either straight on Kari or gives a shot from in front and a little above. The angle shot is great because you can see the entire cast, and you can see the entire top of all their steps, to fully see what they are doing.6. There's a lot of repetition of each move.",5,Great for beginner or intermediate!,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1746,"[""'m"", 'intermediate', 'who', 'basic', 'choreography', 'choreography', 'Go', 'most', 'basic', 'have', 'tried', 'Even', 'workout', 'came', 'step', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'one', 'really', 'would', 'recommend', 'true', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'not', 'cue', 'leg', 'workout', 'exception', 'However', 'routines', 'are', 'so', 'simple', 'not', 'really', 'problem', 'move', 'right', 'leg', 'first', 'then', 'same', 'move', 'left', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'reviewer', 'who', 'choreography', 'too', 'complicated', 'true', 'beginner', 'wonder', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'step', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'get', 'simpler', 'want', 'do', 'basic', 'stepping', 'up', 'down', 'want', 'learn', 'moves', 'will', 'use', 'future', 'workouts', 'world', 'corner', 'corner', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'good', 'instruction.What', 'good', 'workout', 'beginner', 'is:1', 'combos', 'are', ""n't"", 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'different', 'moves', 'remember', 'same', 'time.2', 'Once', 'do', 'combo', 'throw', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'remember', 'later.3', 'do', 'basic', 'step', 'march', 'harder', 'moves', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'explaination', 'attempt', 'move.4', 'Different', 'modifications', 'are', 'shown', 'can', 'make', 'moves', 'more', 'intense', 'get', 'better', 'stepping.5', 'camera', 'place', 'either', 'straight', 'Kari', 'shot', 'front', 'little', 'above', 'angle', 'shot', 'great', 'can', 'see', 'entire', 'cast', 'can', 'see', 'entire', 'top', 'steps', 'fully', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing.6', 'lot', 'repetition', 'move']",Kari Anderson: Go - Step Workout for Beginners
972447,A1ZUK82SVPB3MX,B000EGDN6S,Candice Michelle,"[18, 18]","This workout is formatted pretty simplistically. A 5-minute warmup that goes right into the first 15-minute workout, which is then followed by another 15-minute workout and then a cool down.I persisted through the whole 45-minutes and found that it was exactly what I needed. At right about the time that I started to become tired and feel a cramp in my side, the instructor began the cool down, which was perfect timing for me. While it's true that this workout could frustrate a true step beginner, with some practice it isn't nearly as difficult to learn as one might initially think. I watched the video the first time, then decided to try it and screwed up and got confused a lot thoughout. A couple of days later I did the workout again and only got a little flustered during the second workout. But by the third time I pretty much had it down. I can now appreciate the fact that it wasn't too easy to learn, or else the workout itself might not be as effective or challenging as it is. My heart-rate stayed up the whole time in spite of the fact this this is low-impact and dubbed ""for beginners."" I certainly can't think of any low-impact floor aerobic workouts that elevate my heart rate and actually cause me to break a sweat. But this step workout most definitely did!Kari Anderson is a great instructor, and once you memorize which of her queues are associated with what moves, it's pretty easy to follow along. Her personality is fun and outgoing, but not over-the-top, and I enjoyed the accompanying, mostly techno/electronic music throughout, which suited the moves just perfectly. Kari is accompanied by several other steppers - including one modifier who does many of the moves on the floor - set against a dark blue backdrop.Although ""Go: Step for Beginners"" is titled as such, this workout will certainly keep even an intermediate exerciser feeling challenged throughout.

I had tried step classes at my local gym, but was completely unprepared for the quick and difficult choreography.  Not a problem here!The steps are easy to learn and Kari is personable and fun.  It took me a few weeks to make it all the way through the workout - but now I do it once a week.  She has a few women and one man in the background.  One of the women is overweight - she often does the lower-impact versions of the moves, which I also did at the beginning.  It was very reassuring to see an overweight woman in an exercise video - it kept my motivated like, ""if she can do this, so can I.""I recommend this one for any one new to step or for anyone who just doesn't like complicated choreography - I for one, find comfort in repetition.",5,Wow - fun & challenging.,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,803,"['really', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'yes', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'had', 'tried', 'step', 'classes', 'local', 'gym', 'was', 'completely', 'unprepared', 'quick', 'difficult', 'choreography', 'Not', 'problem', 'here', 'steps', 'are', 'easy', 'learn', 'Kari', 'personable', 'fun', 'took', 'few', 'weeks', 'make', 'way', 'workout', 'now', 'do', 'once', 'week', 'few', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'background', 'One', 'women', 'overweight', 'often', 'lower-impact', 'versions', 'moves', 'also', 'did', 'beginning', 'was', 'very', 'reassuring', 'see', 'overweight', 'woman', 'exercise', 'video', 'kept', 'motivated', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'recommend', 'one', 'one', 'new', 'step', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'like', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'one', 'find', 'comfort', 'repetition']",Kari Anderson: Go - Step Workout for Beginners

972450,A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B000EGDN6S,"J.S. Knapp ""ViperMan""","[0, 0]","I like this step video.  I don't love it.Kari Anderson is an EXTREMELY energetic person.  She frequently adds additional spirited moves into her exercises just... ...because.  This can have a polar effect on you - either you're in the mood to really push it a notch and match Kari's efforts, or you've had a rough day and feel like telling her to kiss your rump!Kari's DVD is divided into a Warm-up session of five minutes, a general workout of 15 minutes, a secondary, more challenging work out of 15 minutes, and a 10-minute cooldown.  The warm-up is effective and comfortable.  The first workout is a little boring and repetitive.  You basically do a few exercises over and over again, while throwing in some of Kari's energetic moves.  The second workout is FAR more challenging - so much so I've only attempted it once so far!  The cooldown is one of the most frustrating parts in my opinion - using a very ricky rock-step that always seems to trip me up at a time that I'm already pretty winded.  But her stretches are very thorough and I definitely feel an improvement in the past two months of using this DVD.Lastly, Kari is a playful person surrounded by other playful participants.  I think some of her jokes and quips and replies from the other participants ""cheese"" down the video and seem to add a level of unprofessionalism.  Some people however may enjoy the relaxed atmosphere this creates.  I however prefer a more neutral environment - I don't like people trying to make me laugh when I'm covered in sweat.I still give the video four stars because it's definitely effective.  I started with a Cathe video that reacclimated me to STEP exercise, and by following other reviews for this video, used it as my next level.  I can't really refer to this as a beginner's video, though she does still try to explain some of the basics.  Unfortunately, she explains them after you're already doing them.  You'll have to go through the DVD a few times before it becomes comfortable.  I don't think that I'll rely on Kari very long before upgrading to yet another more challenging video - it just tends to irritate me more than I'd prefer.I think women will enjoy this video because it will make them comfortable.  Even I appreciate the fact that one of her backup ""Steppers"" is a man (though rather dorky looking) and I think some women would also be glad to see a rather heavyset woman exercising on the far right.  It's a good contrast to videos employing nothing but scantily-clad models.As a man, the only real perspective I can add is that, if Kari Anderson has a husband, he's a very, VERY lucky man.

Groh,"[3, 3]","I say old fashioned because there are so many new workout routines that are just beyond my physical abilities -- filled with lots of dance steps, bouncing and jumping. I'm not in a position to add any more bounce to my already bouncy body. So I was looking for a basic step routine that would get my heart rate up but be 'easy' enough to keep me going and not give me a reason to walk away due to difficulty.I like this routine. It is standard in that Kari teaches a step and builds on the routine each time. She gives easy directions and all of the steps are enough to get your heart rate up but not so difficult to discourage the average beginner. There is a warm-up and then 20 minute beginning routine.

972454,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B000EGDN6S,Teedums,"[109, 109]","This is only the second workout I have tried by Kari Anderson, who is known for more complex and dancy choreography.  She has come up with a great step workout for beginners and intermediates.  I would consider myself a solid intermediate in step who simply prefers easier choreography, doesn't want to have to think too hard and just wants to step and burn fat.  While the choreography is simple, I wouldn't call it super basic, therefore it is enough to keep beginners/intermediate steppers interested and not bored once their fitness levels increase.  Kari is joined by 6 of her students, 2 of them on the right side of the room show easier modifications, whether it be performing some moves on the floor or leaving some of the trickier moves out.There are 4 segments to the workout, a 5 minute warmup performed mostly on the floor but the step is utilized a little bit.  Then you move into the first segment which is 15 minutes, some of the moves you will see here are corner to corner kicks and knee lifts, basic steps, walking around the step, repeaters, hamstring curls, straddles, side leg lifts and stomps.Segment 2 is also 15 minutes long and slightly more complex, but still easy to pick up.  Here you will see more basic steps, alternating knees, T squats w/side leg lifts, V steps, around the world, mambos, corner knees, inner thigh lifts, front back front repeaters, turn steps, turn shuffles, over the tops and rocking horses.  Then it's on to the 10 minute cooldown and stretch again which uses the step a little bit.Kari does a great job choreographing these routines, they are simple and easy to follow thanks to her great cueing.  The music selected is very good and fits the workout well.  Kari is an excellent instructor, she is encouraging, offers options to increase or decrease the intensity and is good about interacting with her students to make the workout fun for them too.  I get the impression that her live classes are a lot of fun, she seems like a very caring and personable individual.I would recommend this to anyone looking for step workouts with simpler choreography.  While it's labeled for beginners and it is fairly simple I still get a great workout from it.
