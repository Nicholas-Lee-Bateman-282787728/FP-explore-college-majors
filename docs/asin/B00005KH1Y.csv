It is a concert strung together with glimpses of a tyranical father and scenes with a controlling boyfriend.  After 30 minutes of having these scenes repeated, we have got the idea.

Based on a song of the same title Dolly wrote for her underrated ""Hugry Again"" album in 1998 ""Blue Valley Songbird"" originally aired on the ""Lifetime"" network to huge ratings. Dolly plays a lounge country and western singer who is trying to make it big in Nashville and to land a major record deal. She is involved in a triangle between two men as well, one played by then hot Billy Dean who duets with Dolly on ""We Might Be In Love"", one of Dolly's most beautifully-penned love songs. The script is strong, the acting honors belong to Dolly of course and the film is very involving and features Dolly singing many songs throughout including her sensitive ""Wildflowers"", originally appearing on her ""Trio"" album from 1987 with Emmylou Harris and Linda Rondstant, ""I Hope Your Never Happy"" from 1985's ""Real Love LP and ""Runaway Feelin' from 1991's ""Eagle When She Flies"". All these songs are newly arranged and recorded just for the film. Unfortunately, there was never a soundtrack release from ""Blue Valley Songbird"" although there was and still is a great demand for it from Dolly's fan base.The movie was shot entirely on location in Nashville and is the only time in Dolly's career that she wore a red wig for the role.",5,"""Wonderful Dolly Movie""",1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1366,"['late', '1990', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'was', 'not', 'receiving', 'good', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'scripts', 'one', 'called', 'Blue', 'Valley', 'Songbird', 'came', 'way', 'Based', 'song', 'same', 'title', 'Dolly', 'wrote', 'underrated', 'Hugry', 'Again', 'album', '1998', 'Blue', 'Valley', 'Songbird', 'originally', 'aired', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'huge', 'ratings', 'Dolly', 'lounge', 'country', 'western', 'singer', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'Nashville', 'land', 'major', 'record', 'deal', 'involved', 'triangle', 'two', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'played', 'then', 'hot', 'Billy', 'Dean', 'who', 'Dolly', 'Might', 'Be', 'Love', 'one', 'Dolly', 'most', 'beautifully-penned', 'love', 'songs', 'script', 'strong', 'acting', 'honors', 'belong', 'Dolly', 'course', 'film', 'very', 'involving', 'features', 'Dolly', 'singing', 'many', 'songs', 'including', 'sensitive', 'Wildflowers', 'originally', 'appearing', 'Trio', 'album', '1987', 'Emmylou', 'Harris', 'Linda', 'Rondstant', 'Hope', 'Never', 'Happy', '1985', 'Real', 'Love', 'LP', 'Runaway', 'Feelin', '1991', 'Eagle', 'When', 'Flies', 'songs', 'are', 'newly', 'arranged', 'recorded', 'just', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'never', 'soundtrack', 'release', 'Blue', 'Valley', 'Songbird', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'demand', 'Dolly', 'fan', 'base.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'Nashville', 'only', 'time', 'Dolly', 'career', 'wore', 'red', 'wig', 'role']",N/A
