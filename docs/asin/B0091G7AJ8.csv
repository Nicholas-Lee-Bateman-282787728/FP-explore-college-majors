This DVD collection is perfect for us because it features 15 whole episodes of those loveable bears.  Each episode features a lesson that only the Berenstain Bears can make both fun and educational!  My kids thought it was great to watch the episodes and then go read The Berenstain Bears books that we have - yeah for encouraging reading.  You get three DVDs in this collection, each with five episodes on it, and don't worry the episodes are short enough for kids to understand.  Whether we watch just one or a whole DVD, it is perfect for my boys and they ask to watch them again and again.

Yes, they are old fashion, but you know when purchasing them that they aren't today's animation. We love these dvd's because of the values and life lessons that they teach to our daughter. She doesn't get to watch much TV at all so these are a real treat for her when she does. If you are looking for wholesome cartoons that teach your young people some morals and values then these dvd's are a great investment, especially for the fantastic price they are listed for here on Amazon.",5,Fantastic Purchase,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,590,"['daughter', 'received', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'delighted', 'set', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'are', 'old', 'fashion', 'know', 'when', 'purchasing', 'are', ""n't"", 'today', 'animation', 'love', 'dvd', 'values', 'life', 'lessons', 'teach', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'much', 'TV', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'wholesome', 'cartoons', 'teach', 'young', 'people', 'morals', 'values', 'then', 'dvd', 'are', 'great', 'investment', 'especially', 'fantastic', 'price', 'are', 'listed', 'here', 'Amazon']",Berenstain Bears

I love the theme song too.,5,love it,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,568,"['love', 'Berenstain', 'bears', 'kid', 'was', 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'kids', 'love', 'lessons', 'are', 'really', 'perfect', 'are', 'not', 'sappy', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'how', 'parents', 'children', 'would', 'feel', 'respond', 'different', 'situations', 'often', 'types', 'lesson-oriented', 'tales', 'are', 'super', 'idealized', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'mother', 'would', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'child', 'made', 'huge', 'mess', 'destroyed', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'big', 'brother', 'would', 'stick', 'up', 'little', 'sister', 'get', 'back', 'something', 'bully', 'love', 'theme', 'song', 'too']",Berenstain Bears

1583888,APZ811HJE5S0U,B0091G7AJ8,"Sue ""librarian1""","[0, 0]","These are the DVDs of the Berenstain Bear stories, which are great in themselves.  The books about these bears number in the dozens (maybe even over 100).  Each has a message for children with a moral, or how to rectify a troublesome situation.  The Bear family is Mama, Papa, Sister (who is about 7 years old) and Brother (who is about 9 years old).  Together they overcome such problems as &#34;the in crowd,&#34; keeping up with homework, not helping around the house, accepting people for who they are, dealing with peer pressure, wanting too many toys, etc.  These cartoons are not dumbed down, and really not too &#34;cartoonish&#34; but they are not preachy, either.  The bear children (and their parents) aren't perfect, but they usually work out some solution.  There are other bear characters in some of the stories, such as friends, grandparents and neighbors (all bears of course).  The animation is really quite good.  Your kids will learn something from each one, but will have fun too.",5,"Excellent, fun DVDs, with a good message",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1000,"['are', 'DVDs', 'Berenstain', 'Bear', 'stories', 'are', 'great', 'books', 'bears', 'number', 'dozens', 'maybe', 'even', '100', 'message', 'children', 'moral', 'how', 'rectify', 'troublesome', 'situation', 'Bear', 'family', 'Mama', 'Papa', 'Sister', 'who', '7', 'years', 'old', 'Brother', 'who', '9', 'years', 'old', 'Together', 'overcome', 'such', 'problems', '34', 'crowd', '34', 'keeping', 'up', 'homework', 'not', 'helping', 'house', 'accepting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'peer', 'pressure', 'wanting', 'too', 'many', 'toys', 'etc', 'cartoons', 'are', 'not', 'dumbed', 'down', 'really', 'not', 'too', '34', 'cartoonish', '34', 'are', 'not', 'preachy', 'either', 'bear', 'children', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'usually', 'work', 'out', 'solution', 'are', 'other', 'bear', 'characters', 'stories', 'such', 'friends', 'grandparents', 'neighbors', 'bears', 'course', 'animation', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'something', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'too']",Berenstain Bears
