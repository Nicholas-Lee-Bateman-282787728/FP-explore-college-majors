Mary is a midwife, a single mom with two teenage boys. They meet through a dating service, have a couple of disastrous encounters but fall in love. I don't want to say any more except to restate that this was a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting series.

This is a series that make you feel good without being sappy, sugar coated, and insulting your intelligence. There is a lot of quality in its production. (There were occasional exception of `loose-ends' being tied more smoothly than they would in real life, but to have them not would have been a disappointment.)I was not able to get Season 3, however.

The William character played by Martin Clunes is sympathetic and one feels a concern for his happiness; the Mary character played by Julie Graham is also an interesting and sympathetic character.Both my wife and I had a problem with the contemporary life styles being portrayed in this series and felt it to be more depressing that uplifting or entertaining. As a results we do not expect to watch any more of the series.

However, lest you get the wrong idea, this is not a British version of The Brady Bunch, thank God. It is a well-written, funny, poignant and fast-moving saga of people trying to get together and make a go of their relationship.  In the process they have to deal with, among others, a wacked-out and really irritating mother (the bride's), a decent but rather clueless ex-boyfriend, a not-so-decent and intrusive ex-husband (maybe), four teenagers of varying irritation quotients and their own professional problems.  My only criticism of the series is that there are a seemingly endless number of childbirth scenes (the heroine being a midwife and all) which get a bit repetitive after a  while.

The third season, which is not in this set, was by far the worst. For some reason by season 2 the writers and/or cast decided that each episode must feature a funeral juxtaposed with a screaming birth accompanied by the not so dulcet tones of Martin Clunes and &#34;the boys in the band&#34;. Then there were the prerequisite semi nude, demi sex scenes featuring everyone in the cast at some time or other.The most unappealing aspect of this series for me was the sullen, judgmental, unforgiving character of Mary who always found fault with others from William, to her children, to her mother, to every doctor who dared question her decisions as a midwife.",2,Self Indulgent,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,797,"['series', 'started', 'out', 'promising', 'story', 'mature', 'relationship', 'blended', 'families', 'progressed', 'self', 'indulgent', 'soap', 'opera', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'set', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'reason', 'season', '2', 'writers', 'and/or', 'cast', 'decided', 'episode', 'must', 'feature', 'funeral', 'juxtaposed', 'screaming', 'birth', 'accompanied', 'not', 'so', 'dulcet', 'tones', 'Martin', 'Clunes', '34', 'boys', 'band', '34', 'Then', 'were', 'prerequisite', 'semi', 'nude', 'demi', 'sex', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'everyone', 'cast', 'time', 'other.The', 'most', 'unappealing', 'aspect', 'series', 'was', 'sullen', 'judgmental', 'unforgiving', 'character', 'Mary', 'who', 'always', 'found', 'fault', 'others', 'William', 'children', 'mother', 'doctor', 'who', 'dared', 'question', 'decisions', 'midwife']",William and Mary: Seasons 1 & 2
