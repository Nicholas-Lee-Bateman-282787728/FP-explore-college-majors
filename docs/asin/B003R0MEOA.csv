The second season was a good balance of the original family stuff with Urkel.  Around the fourth season I think the balance began to shift much more towards Urkel taking over, but at this early point it manages to use his character without losing the other good elements.  Most shows hit some sort of creative high point the second season and this one is probably no exception-after a first season to experiment, the writers are usually able to perfect the format.  So, in summary, I hope this is released, as I know lots of us love to re-live our lost youth and there's no way better than putting out the complete Miller-Boyett TGIF lineup from ABC on DVD.",5,Great Show,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,762,"['good', 'fun', 'show', 'hope', 'continue', 'release', 'more', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Step', 'Step', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'balance', 'original', 'family', 'stuff', 'Urkel', 'fourth', 'season', 'think', 'balance', 'began', 'shift', 'much', 'more', 'towards', 'Urkel', 'taking', 'over', 'early', 'point', 'use', 'character', 'losing', 'other', 'good', 'elements', 'Most', 'shows', 'hit', 'sort', 'creative', 'high', 'point', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'probably', 'exception-after', 'first', 'season', 'experiment', 'writers', 'are', 'usually', 'able', 'perfect', 'format', 'So', 'summary', 'hope', 'released', 'know', 'lots', 'love', 're-live', 'lost', 'youth', 'way', 'better', 'putting', 'out', 'complete', 'Miller-Boyett', 'TGIF', 'lineup', 'ABC', 'DVD']",Family Matters: Season 2

1359387,A1R75W42LUUPO9,B003R0MEOA,K.,"[1, 3]","After having crossed both my fingers and toes, Warner Home Video has finally trotted out season 2 of ""Family Matters"" on DVD. This was the only season (1990-91) for which the show was in the Top 20 Nielsen ratings, and ""Urklemania"" surrounding Jaleel White's Steve Urkel character was in full-swing (remember Urkel-O's brand cereal?). This set includes all 25 episodes of season 2, including a few of my favorites such as ""The Science Projects"" (where Laura dreams that Urkel has built her an atom bomb for the school science fair), ""Cousin Urkel"" (the introduction of Steve Urkel's cousin Myrtle - played by Jaleel White in drag), ""Requiem for an Urkel"" (where Urkel and his bully Willie - a young Larenz Tate - duke it out in the boxing ring, after Urkel slaps him with a mitten accompanied by one of the funniest sound effects in sitcom history), and ""Life of the Party"" (where Urkel teaches everyone ""The Urkel Dance"").Unfortunately for the rest of the cast, this is also where Jaleel White permanently broke out as ""Family Matters'"" biggest draw, and by season's end the Winslow family has permanently taken a back seat to the nerd next door (as can be seen from the DVD artwork). There are, however, a few Winslow family highlights, such as ""Finding the Words"", a touching episode where Paul Winfield plays Harriette and Rachel's long lost father, who ran out on them thirty years ago.All of the episodes are the original ABC broadcast versions with the full theme song and no edits, except for ""Ice Station Winslow"", which is the syndicated version. The quality of the video varies from episode to episode - the season opener, ""Rachel's Place"", is marred by ghosting - but the video is always at least watchable. There is the possibility that I'm comparing what I'm seeing (original tape masters) to newer transfers of SD material - I feel most audiences won't really care about the picture quality, but it is noticeable on the affected issues.There are no bonus features on the set, which, while par for the course for DVD TV season sets these days, is still a bit disappointing for this show, given its popularity at the time of its broadcast. If it were at all possible, it would be nice there were gag reels or vintage promo pieces for the show in the WB vaults that could be tossed out as supplemental features.",4,"Picture quality is a bit off, but overall satisfied",1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,2323,"['having', 'crossed', 'fingers', 'toes', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'finally', 'trotted', 'out', 'season', '2', 'Family', 'Matters', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'season', '1990-91', 'show', 'was', 'Top', '20', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'Urklemania', 'surrounding', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'character', 'was', 'full-swing', 'remember', 'Urkel-O', 'brand', 'cereal', 'set', '25', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'including', 'few', 'favorites', 'such', 'Science', 'Projects', 'where', 'Laura', 'Urkel', 'built', 'atom', 'bomb', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'Cousin', 'Urkel', 'introduction', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'cousin', 'Myrtle', 'played', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'drag', 'Requiem', 'Urkel', 'where', 'Urkel', 'bully', 'Willie', 'young', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'duke', 'out', 'boxing', 'ring', 'Urkel', 'slaps', 'mitten', 'accompanied', 'one', 'funniest', 'sound', 'effects', 'sitcom', 'history', 'Life', 'Party', 'where', 'Urkel', 'everyone', 'Urkel', 'Dance', '.Unfortunately', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'where', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'permanently', 'broke', 'out', 'Family', 'Matters', 'biggest', 'draw', 'season', 'end', 'Winslow', 'family', 'permanently', 'taken', 'back', 'seat', 'nerd', 'next', 'door', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'are', 'however', 'few', 'Winslow', 'family', 'highlights', 'such', 'Finding', 'Words', 'touching', 'episode', 'where', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'Harriette', 'Rachel', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'who', 'ran', 'out', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago.All', 'episodes', 'are', 'original', 'ABC', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'full', 'theme', 'song', 'edits', 'Ice', 'Station', 'Winslow', 'syndicated', 'version', 'quality', 'video', 'varies', 'episode', 'episode', 'season', 'opener', 'Rachel', 'Place', 'marred', 'ghosting', 'video', 'always', 'least', 'watchable', 'possibility', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'what', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'original', 'tape', 'masters', 'newer', 'transfers', 'SD', 'material', 'feel', 'most', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'picture', 'quality', 'noticeable', 'affected', 'are', 'bonus', 'set', 'par', 'course', 'DVD', 'TV', 'season', 'days', 'still', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'show', 'given', 'popularity', 'time', 'broadcast', 'were', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'were', 'gag', 'reels', 'vintage', 'promo', 'pieces', 'show', 'WB', 'vaults', 'could', 'be', 'tossed', 'out', 'supplemental', 'features']",Family Matters: Season 2

Okay, maybe that's a little too far, since I've seen very few other sitcoms, but Family Matters is just that great. You see, when watching this show, there isn't really a need to go watch any other sitcom because you've got all the amazing and clever humor right here.The characters in the show have personalities that are well structured, but the real star of the show happens to be Steve Urkel (played by Jaleel White), who is the nerd on the cover. His lovable dorkiness really adds to the show. When I watched the episodes of Family Matters that didn't have Steve (you know, the earlier ones), I thought they were funny. But when Steve came, this show's appeal suddenly grew to massive heights.Whatever you do, do NOT miss out on this hilarious sitcom!
