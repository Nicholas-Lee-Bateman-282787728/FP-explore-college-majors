Frankly, I would rather listen to the word &#8220;N&#8220; 100 times&#8230;. than explicit sex jokes.This was my first look at Eddie Griffin, and I was surprised at how hilarious he can be. Here, as inbetween the concert snippets, he has taken the viewers back home where he visits and interviews family and his old school where the &#8220;dream&#8221; started.This guy has an ability to reenact scenes with family with such clarity; he is loud, boistrous, animated, and hysterical.  Watch, as he reenacts how his uncle shoots up heroine.  And, listen, how truly hilarious he describes the &#34;discipline&#34; his mother gave.  He can impersonate celebrities, in a different light.  . Griffin's act is with non-stop humor as he takes over the stage.Yes, we get to know several family members. But please, you can do without Porn Uncle and his album of explicit images and his porn collection.  Some family members are in the audience. But, don&#8217;t embarrass your mama, please. Some of that explicit sex talk can be eliminated&#8230;&#8230;. If anything while your mama is in the audience, blushing.Yes, I believe there are 100 uses of that dreaded &#34;N&#34;  word which no one, absolutely no one,  is allowed to say, but African Americans.

One has to hand it to Eddie for revealing such dysfunctional family behaviour that would usually be kept secret. He has really aired the dirty laundry on this show. The good thng about it is that ALL families have a degree of dysfunctionality about them.There are several sidesplitting jokes to be enjoyed by all. The jokes are indeed quite funny, but I have to say that I have heard very similar jokes told by Richard Pryor. In fact, the similarities extend into Eddie's physical humour. Perhaps it evidence of Pryor's influence on comedians that came after him that there should be such striking similarities.As is customary with Griffin performances, it's all about the jokes. There is precious little socio-plitical commentary. that is okay though, because the jokes are good enough to keep you interested. I for one, prefer to watch satirists and socio-political commentators of high calibre (eg Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Michael Colyar). Eddie is the funniest guy I know who does little commentary.I would strictly rate this dvd at 70%, but our 5 star rating system does not permit.

616047,A2GSWZ9A228V9V,B00005JMAS,Emmanuel,"[4, 26]","This movie, first and foremost, is somewhat funny. Its content, however, is very questionable and highly controversial. Eddie's frequent and bothersome use of the N-word is outrageous. In the beginning of this Documentary, he rationalizes this as follows: the more I use the N-word, the lesser power it has. To me, this is quite infantile. The more you say any word, the greater power it has. This is a fact. Advertisers, for example, are fully aware of this; and that's why they bombard us with their brand names every day through billboards, frequent TV-ads, etc.The last, but not least, controversial and bothersome issue is failure to realize the futility of physical punishment of kids by their respective parents. Eddie somewhat, believe it or not, subtly encourages parents to be tough on their kids in punishing them severely. Punishment accomplishes nothing but encourages rebellion even more. It's a proven research. Eddie himself, as well, appraises his mom for beating him inhumanely when he was a kid; and he gives her and her punishment the credit for his success. This, however, is questionable since Eddie himself mentions he was just released from prison for double-homicide. Physical punishment doesn't work. Early childhood discipline through love-colored advise and admonition is the key to bring forth fruitful young people. I am not, someway or another, one of those parents who abuse this style of discipline and end up being friends to their children and not parents. Discipline is the key word to be noticed here. These are only some of the controversial issues the movie is packed with. It's recommendable to note, if you buy the DVD, the controversial nature these issues to avoid systematic brainwashing through entertainment.

616053,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMAS,mirasreviews,"[3, 6]","""DysFunKtional Family"" is a stand-up comedy film with a documentary twist.  Most of the film is footage from Eddie Griffin's live onstage appearance in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. In his hour-and-half-long performance, Eddie Griffin cracks jokes about race relations, household pets, women, men, and a whole lot of sex. But his commentary on his family is arguably the comic's funniest material. Interspersed with jokes about Griffin's Uncle Curtis who wants to be a porn star and has a video collection to prove it, his Uncle Buckey, an ex-con and ex-junkie, and Griffin's overbearing but loving mother are snippets of interviews with the family members themselves. -Proof that Griffin is not exaggerating when he describes his dysfunctional and farcical family. Those are ""DysFunKtional Family""'s good qualities. In truth, I found Eddie Griffin's family to be funnier than Eddie Griffin. Most of Griffin's performance struck me as someone acting as if he is funny as opposed to actually being funny. That may go far with a live audience that is caught up in the moment, but it falls flat for viewers watching the movie at home. And Griffin uses two particular words a few times per sentence in his stand-up routine. One word is a racial slur; and the other is a four-syllable vulgarity. Griffin claims that using inflammatory language repeatedly robs it of its meaning. Using this sort of language casually might do that, but hearing these two words several hundred times like a broken record within the space of 90 minutes is trying, boring, and gives the impression that Eddie Griffin is unable to get the audience's attention with his humor alone. Fans of Eddie Griffin obviously like his style. If you're a fan, you might appreciate ""DysFunKtional Family""'s concert material more than I did, and you will likely enjoy the additional footage of Griffin's family.

616058,A15MLF38WROSWU,B00005JMAS,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[2, 7]","This was okay.  I felt Eddie Griffin would have been a lot funnier with less use of the N word.  That is utter nonsense what he said, ""The more you say a word the less power it has"".  He can believe that if he wants, but if someone non-black were to utter that word in his face, he would be upset just like many black people who use the word, and claim the same thing he does get.  When he said if Michael Jackson lightens himself one more time he will be clear I could not agree with him more!!  When he talked about the spankings he got from his mother I laughed so hard.  That is something just about anyone can relate to if you have a mother who won't take any mess.  ""Pain will give you a memory of what not to do.""  That is the truth.  Sometimes you need to spank.  There is a difference between abuse and spankings. Eddie is saying get tough on children because let's face it, sometimes time outs do not work.Talking about his family, is when he is the most funniest.  You get to meet some of Eddie G's family during the DVD.  We get to see his mother, and two of his Uncles.  His Uncle Curtis wanting to be a porn star was funny.  His Uncle Buckey was an ex-con and recovering drug addict.  He talks about meeting his father for the first time as a teenager.  He talks about how one time his mother tried to run over him with her El Dorado.Some of my favorite lines was when he said his mother ""Beat him to a professor"".  When he talks about Micheal Jackson looking like the female version of the Planet of the apes, I could not help but laugh.Eddie uses some lots of vulgar language and if you are easily insulted by profanity and sexual content, this DVD is not for you.  I enjoyed watching this for certain parts because Eddie is talented. I just wish our black comics would stop using the N word.  It's not funny.",3,Dysfunctional Family had its moments,1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,1825,"['was', 'okay', 'felt', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'funnier', 'less', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'what', 'said', 'more', 'say', 'word', 'less', 'power', 'can', 'believe', 'someone', 'non-black', 'were', 'utter', 'word', 'face', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'just', 'many', 'black', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'word', 'claim', 'same', 'thing', 'get', 'When', 'said', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'could', 'not', 'agree', 'more', 'When', 'talked', 'spankings', 'got', 'mother', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'something', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'mess', 'Pain', 'will', 'give', 'memory', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'truth', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'spank', 'difference', 'abuse', 'spankings', 'Eddie', 'saying', 'get', 'tough', 'children', 'let', 'face', 'sometimes', 'time', 'outs', 'do', 'not', 'work.Talking', 'family', 'when', 'most', 'funniest', 'get', 'meet', 'Eddie', 'G', 'family', 'DVD', 'get', 'see', 'mother', 'two', 'Uncles', 'Uncle', 'Curtis', 'wanting', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'was', 'funny', 'Uncle', 'Buckey', 'was', 'ex-con', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'meeting', 'father', 'first', 'time', 'teenager', 'how', 'one', 'time', 'mother', 'tried', 'run', 'over', 'El', 'Dorado.Some', 'favorite', 'lines', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'mother', 'Beat', 'professor', 'When', 'Micheal', 'Jackson', 'looking', 'female', 'version', 'Planet', 'apes', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'laugh.Eddie', 'lots', 'vulgar', 'language', 'are', 'easily', 'insulted', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'content', 'DVD', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'certain', 'parts', 'Eddie', 'talented', 'just', 'wish', 'black', 'comics', 'would', 'stop', 'using', 'N', 'word', 'not', 'funny']",Dysfunktional Family
