He becomes sort of a raving spoiled maniac, totally neglecting his long-suffering wife (Julie Andrews) who really IS dying and knows it but keeps it to herself. (Kind of; the ending is a bit of a surprise.) Lemmon's antics seem to go on too long and become tiring, and Andrews's stoicism is a bit too strong to believe.

Gotta love it! Harvey wants to be in control, but never really feels the authority. Their children were terrific, making this a truly 'family' film for them. So many human experiences are so candidly expressed and the Mancini soundtrack is, of course, perfect throughout. Julie Andrews is the stability in all the uproar around her; thank goodness for 'mental' Holly, who's awareness lends the strong shoulder much needed by her friend. It was lovely to watch Lemmon's wife, Felicia Farr, gently flirt and get to him as fortune teller.

230913,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300263401,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 5]","I gather Blake Edwards set out to make a &quot;small movie&quot; here.  He enlisted his real-life wife, daughter and step-daughter, brought old buddy (and star of his classic &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;) Jack Lemmon aboard and provided parts for Lemmon's wife (Felicia Farr) and son.  Farr, it may be said, lucks out if anyone does--she doesn't play one of the neurotic family members--although it appears that she has a several little problems of her own.Does it work at all?  Well, the first time I saw this movie, I HATED it.  Since Lemmon's death last summer, I have been sort of running my own little &quot;Jack Lemmon film festival&quot; whenver I think of it, and upon re-view, it's not half bad.  Seeing Lemmon's character wrestle with his mortality strikes me as poignant now after the actor's actual death.  Equally eerie in its way, is seeing Julie Andrews character, a professional singer, struggling with potentially devestating vocal problems--and in her own stoic way, her own mortality.The improvisational storyline is the real problem with this film, however. It's rather undeveloped. Lemmon typically needs a broader canvas than Edwards provides him here.  He is intense here as in &quot;Days...&quot; but to  lesser effect.  He's all wound up with no place special to go.  We've seen Lemmon do this kind of shtick before (&quot;Tribute&quot; comes to mind), and like Julie Andrews' Gillian in this movie, we feel like telling him to snap out of it--or we're leaving!",3,Is that REALLY life?,1007942400,"12 10, 2001",2001,1492,"['gather', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'quot', 'small', 'movie', 'quot', 'here', 'enlisted', 'real-life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'step-daughter', 'brought', 'old', 'buddy', 'star', 'classic', 'quot', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'aboard', 'provided', 'parts', 'Lemmon', 'wife', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'son', 'Farr', 'may', 'be', 'said', 'out', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'play', 'one', 'neurotic', 'family', 'members', 'several', 'little', 'problems', 'own.Does', 'work', 'Well', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'HATED', 'Lemmon', 'death', 'last', 'summer', 'have', 'been', 'sort', 'running', 'own', 'little', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'film', 'festival', 'quot', 'think', 're-view', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'Seeing', 'Lemmon', 'character', 'wrestle', 'mortality', 'poignant', 'now', 'actor', 'actual', 'death', 'Equally', 'way', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'character', 'professional', 'singer', 'struggling', 'potentially', 'devestating', 'vocal', 'problems', 'own', 'stoic', 'way', 'own', 'mortality.The', 'improvisational', 'storyline', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'rather', 'undeveloped', 'Lemmon', 'typically', 'broader', 'canvas', 'Edwards', 'here', 'intense', 'here', 'quot', 'Days', 'quot', 'lesser', 'effect', 'wound', 'up', 'place', 'special', 'go', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Lemmon', 'do', 'kind', 'shtick', 'quot', 'Tribute', 'quot', 'mind', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Gillian', 'movie', 'feel', 'telling', 'snap', ""'re"", 'leaving']",N/A

I just read a review of this film, and wondered if we had seen the same film. Hard to follow, uncohesive were implied. As is well known,this is the only semi-autobiographical film of Mr. Edwards. It's about a man turning 60 and having a difficult time coming to terms with this transition. His wife is  played by the beautiful and talented (and his real-life wife) Julie Andrews. At the same time she is planning her husband's big day, she is finding out from her doctor if the vocal polyps he has discovered are cancerous. As Dame Andrews did go through a similar experience, and basically had to stop singing, this is as real as it gets. The film is helped, as if it needed it, by having their offspring, including Jack Lemmon's son Chris Lemmon, play the pair's offspring. Of course, it has a happy ending. And there are some very funny and touching parts. It's a must see. Come on, Julie Andrews and Jack Lemmon in a Blake Edward's film.

230917,A364G1J5EEQURI,6300263401,"William J. Finn ""wjf88""","[4, 5]","...Blake Edwards had been experimenting with ad-lib scenes for many years, ever since his early films with Peter Sellers. The famous watch synchonization scene in ""A Shot In The Dark"" for example - not in the script.But this was booked as an improvised movie. Kind of. The scenes were discussed by all involved. Between Edwards, Andrews and Lemmon there were some 100 years of film experience brought to bear. The story is very believable, even if the characters are in another world from our own, we can still identify.  Gil's patient, suffering, worrying about a real health problem while her husband takes the center stage (""That's the worse case I've ever seen""). The only neurosis here is in Lemmon's character, and contrasted with Gil's real life problem, is the nexus of the story.So just watch it. If you liked any of Edwards's earlier films like ""10"" or ""The Party"", you really will not notice anything unusual. It has all of his hallmarks, very funny and sad at the same time. Sally Kellerman and Robert Loggia are very effective in ther supporting roles and Tony Bennett's vocal of ""Life In A Looking Glass"" (Mancini/Bricusse) is heart-breaking at the end.",4,"Funny, sad, theraputic and definitely not a stunt!",1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,1167,"['Blake', 'Edwards', 'had', 'been', 'experimenting', 'ad-lib', 'scenes', 'many', 'years', 'ever', 'early', 'films', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'famous', 'watch', 'synchonization', 'scene', 'A', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'example', 'not', 'script.But', 'was', 'booked', 'improvised', 'movie', 'Kind', 'scenes', 'were', 'discussed', 'involved', 'Between', 'Edwards', 'Andrews', 'Lemmon', 'were', '100', 'years', 'film', 'experience', 'brought', 'bear', 'story', 'very', 'believable', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'world', 'own', 'can', 'still', 'identify', 'Gil', 'patient', 'suffering', 'worrying', 'real', 'health', 'problem', 'husband', 'center', 'stage', 'worse', 'case', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'neurosis', 'here', 'Lemmon', 'character', 'contrasted', 'Gil', 'real', 'life', 'problem', 'nexus', 'story.So', 'just', 'watch', 'liked', 'Edwards', 'earlier', 'films', '10', 'Party', 'really', 'will', 'not', 'notice', 'anything', 'unusual', 'hallmarks', 'very', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'ther', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'vocal', 'Life', 'A', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'Mancini/Bricusse', 'heart-breaking', 'end']",N/A
