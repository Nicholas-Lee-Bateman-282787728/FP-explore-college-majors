Already from the first joke with the magician and the male cheerleader, Steve Byrne had me laughing. And the laughing lasted 'till the end. I think Steve Byrne is going to be huge once the rest of the world opens up their eyes. Dane Cook better watch out, because Steve is already far better in my opinion. Everone can relate to his comedy. Guys, who haven't woken up from their own farts at night?

And I would say Steve Byrne has a sobered version of Dane Cook style about him (he even talks in a lisp like Dane Cook sometimes does). By sobered, I dont mean Steve Byrne is incredibly less funny than Cook just less spastic. The bulk of Steve Byrne's act concerns being Asian, dating girls, having sex with girls, and not being sexually attractive enough to girls so he can have sex with them",4,Surprisingly good!,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,477,"['Steve', 'Byrne', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'times', 'Well', 'watch', 'would', 'say', 'Steve', 'Byrne', 'sobered', 'version', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'style', 'even', 'talks', 'lisp', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'sometimes', 'sobered', 'dont', 'mean', 'Steve', 'Byrne', 'incredibly', 'less', 'funny', 'Cook', 'just', 'less', 'spastic', 'bulk', 'Steve', 'Byrne', 'act', 'concerns', 'being', 'Asian', 'dating', 'girls', 'having', 'sex', 'girls', 'not', 'being', 'sexually', 'attractive', 'enough', 'girls', 'can', 'have', 'sex']",Steve Byrne's: Happy Hour

Whenever he comes to LA to perform I am always there. So when I heard Byrne was filming his hour long special in Southern California I just had to be there. Of all his live performances that I have seen, this is Steve Byrne at his best. For comedy buffs and people who just want to pop in something and laugh for an hour this is it.
