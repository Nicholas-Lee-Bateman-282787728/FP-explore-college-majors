Dent ""Aragorn""","[4, 5]","I am happy with the Blu-ray version of the 25th Anniversary Edition because it's probably the best we're likely to get for this old Stephen King classic. Anyone who already owns the DVD, should consider the following when deciding whether to upgrade to the Blu.The Blu specific enhancements include:- 1080p resolution with 'wide screen' (9x16) presentation- dual sound tracks: the original 'mono' in Dolby Digital and a remastered 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio- support for bookmarks- ""Dog Days: The Making of Cujo"" featurette (about 42 minutes, 1080p resolution)In addition, you get:- English and Spanish subtitles- Audio commentary by director Lewis TeagueTo me, at this price, this was a very good buy. I've never owned the DVD and I've only watched Cujo in as a cropped 'narrow screen' on TV so, getting it as a wide-screen, hi-res, surround sound, commercial free show was a great experience.The 'making of' featurette is, surprisingly, presented in HD and it's actually worth watching. Besides the director Lewis Teague's take - he considers Cujos as his greatest career accomplishment so he is very passionate about it - we get to see and hear from Dee Wallace (Donna) and the grownup Danny Pintauro (Tad) as well as the producer and others involved in the making of the movie. Among the more interesting pieces of trivia we get to learn: Stephen King's own movie adaptation script was rejected and someone else got to write it, no one knows exactly how many Cujos (dogs) were used - anywhere between 6 and 10, Cujo is a name the Stephen King made up and... a lot more.Anyone who is into Stephen King or horror movies should buy Cujo unless they already have the DVD version. If they have one, I've listed what's on the Blu edition so an informed decision can be made. Blu Cujo gets 5 stars for being a classic and, at this price, for having enough Blu enhancements to justify the purchase.",5,"A King classic, done right in Blu",1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,1891,"['am', 'happy', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'probably', 'best', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'old', 'Stephen', 'King', 'classic', 'Anyone', 'who', 'already', 'DVD', 'should', 'consider', 'following', 'when', 'deciding', 'upgrade', 'Blu.The', 'Blu', 'specific', 'enhancements', 'include', '1080p', 'resolution', ""'wide"", 'screen', '9x16', 'presentation-', 'dual', 'sound', 'tracks', 'original', ""'mono"", 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'remastered', '5.1', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'Audio-', 'support', 'bookmarks-', 'Dog', 'Making', 'Cujo', 'featurette', '42', 'minutes', '1080p', 'resolution', 'addition', 'get', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles-', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Lewis', 'TeagueTo', 'price', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'buy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'owned', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'Cujo', 'cropped', 'screen', 'TV', 'so', 'getting', 'wide-screen', 'hi-res', 'surround', 'sound', 'commercial', 'free', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'experience.The', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'surprisingly', 'presented', 'HD', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'director', 'Lewis', 'Teague', 'take', 'Cujos', 'greatest', 'career', 'accomplishment', 'very', 'passionate', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Donna', 'grownup', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'Tad', 'as', 'well', 'producer', 'others', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'pieces', 'trivia', 'get', 'learn', 'Stephen', 'King', 'own', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'script', 'was', 'rejected', 'someone', 'else', 'got', 'write', 'one', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'Cujos', 'dogs', 'were', 'used', 'anywhere', '6', '10', 'Cujo', 'name', 'Stephen', 'King', 'made', 'up', 'lot', 'more.Anyone', 'who', 'Stephen', 'King', 'horror', 'movies', 'should', 'buy', 'Cujo', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'one', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'what', 'Blu', 'edition', 'so', 'informed', 'decision', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Blu', 'Cujo', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'classic', 'price', 'having', 'enough', 'Blu', 'enhancements', 'justify', 'purchase']",N/A

Still, I sat through it, loving every minute, as THAT had been the first time since I went as a teen to see it...so I was proud to make the 25th Anniversary edition of ""Cujo"" one of my very first Blu-Ray purchases.As you all likely know, ""Cujo"" is the story of an affable Saint Bernard that becomes infected with rabies, and through a course of events terrorizes a woman and her young son trapped in an incapacitated car.Now, on the surface, that just doesn't sound like the formula for a great horror film...but if you stop there, you rob the film of it's ""bite"", and rob YOURSELF of a great film experience. While some belabor the 'soap-opera' qualities of the first half of the film, my opinion is that if we aren't led to care about the characters, we are kind of indifferent to their plight in the second half.  Character development is SO important, and in this case, it's used to show us how this woman pays for her sins, yet redeems herself.First off, you have the brilliant portrayal of the woman in question by the talented Dee Wallace (this woman SHOULD have won some Oscars down the line).  During the first half of the flick, we see her darker side as an unfaithful but repentant wife; whereas the dialogue does not play upon the matter much, her performance exudes a woman who has made a mistake, and is paying for it with the guilt she is saddled with.  When we reach the climax, Wallace takes the role to a new level, giving us first an undeniable portrait of a woman taxed emotionally to the breaking point, then of a mother hell-bent to protect her child.Danny Pintauro, only six at the time, delivers a tour-de-force portrayal of the young boy, bringing us physical and emotional acting chops that we don't often see in actors six times his age.  The scenes in the car are claustrophobic and chilling, and the camera work was a marvel to behold (watch for the ""spinning"" scene at a particular high-tension point...sheer genius).  The special effects make the friendly, jovial dog into a menacing and terrifying monster, his red eyes and slavering jowls a glimpse into the gates of Hell itself.Add together the confined feeling, the explosive and unpredictable rages of the dog, and the stellar acting and cinematography, and you have one of the most realistic, most relatable, and most personal horror flicks of the 80's.Watching it again was a marvelous experience:  the transfer is the best it's ever looked, and the 5.1 audio mix was astounding...you really feel as if you're in that car...the bonus behind the scenes feature was informative and fun to watch, loaded with little facts and trivia that make the overall experience that much better.For eleven bucks, you really shouldn't miss out on this tense, intimate classic.",5,"""It's not a monster, baby...it's just a doggie...""",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2904,"['been', 'least', 'fifteen', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'movie', 'then', 'was', 'cable', 'channel', 'cropped', 'edited', 'full', 'commercial', 'interruption', 'Still', 'sat', 'loving', 'minute', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'teen', 'see', 'so', 'was', 'proud', 'make', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'Cujo', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'Blu-Ray', 'purchases.As', 'likely', 'know', 'Cujo', 'story', 'affable', 'Saint', 'Bernard', 'infected', 'rabies', 'course', 'events', 'woman', 'young', 'son', 'trapped', 'incapacitated', 'car.Now', 'surface', 'just', ""n't"", 'sound', 'formula', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'stop', 'there', 'rob', 'film', 'bite', 'rob', 'YOURSELF', 'great', 'film', 'experience', 'belabor', ""'soap-opera"", 'qualities', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'opinion', 'are', ""n't"", 'led', 'care', 'characters', 'are', 'kind', 'indifferent', 'plight', 'second', 'half', 'Character', 'development', 'SO', 'important', 'case', 'used', 'show', 'how', 'woman', 'sins', 'yet', 'redeems', 'off', 'have', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'question', 'talented', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'woman', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'won', 'Oscars', 'line', 'first', 'half', 'flick', 'see', 'darker', 'side', 'unfaithful', 'repentant', 'wife', 'dialogue', 'not', 'play', 'matter', 'much', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'paying', 'guilt', 'saddled', 'When', 'reach', 'climax', 'Wallace', 'role', 'new', 'level', 'giving', 'first', 'undeniable', 'portrait', 'woman', 'taxed', 'emotionally', 'breaking', 'point', 'then', 'mother', 'hell-bent', 'protect', 'child.Danny', 'Pintauro', 'only', 'six', 'time', 'tour-de-force', 'portrayal', 'young', 'boy', 'bringing', 'physical', 'emotional', 'acting', 'chops', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'actors', 'six', 'times', 'age', 'scenes', 'car', 'are', 'claustrophobic', 'chilling', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'marvel', 'behold', 'watch', 'spinning', 'scene', 'particular', 'high-tension', 'point', 'sheer', 'genius', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'friendly', 'jovial', 'dog', 'menacing', 'terrifying', 'monster', 'red', 'eyes', 'slavering', 'jowls', 'glimpse', 'gates', 'Hell', 'itself.Add', 'together', 'confined', 'feeling', 'explosive', 'unpredictable', 'rages', 'dog', 'stellar', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'most', 'relatable', 'most', 'personal', 'horror', 'flicks', ""80's.Watching"", 'again', 'was', 'marvelous', 'experience', 'transfer', 'best', 'ever', 'looked', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix', 'was', 'astounding', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'car', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'feature', 'was', 'informative', 'fun', 'watch', 'loaded', 'little', 'facts', 'trivia', 'make', 'overall', 'experience', 'much', 'better.For', 'eleven', 'bucks', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'tense', 'intimate', 'classic']",N/A

With an exception of very few writing pieces, Stephen King's stories hardly translate to movie success probably because either the production values are abysmal or basically the idea is absurdly stupid. This time, Cujo falls in the latter category. When I saw the dog, I was looking at St. Bernard and I said to myself, ""Okay, it's a St. Bernard."" Before I picked up Cujo, I had an idea of a Doberman or a Rotweiler, but a St. Bernard? Now, I don't know about you, but to me, when it comes to identifying the real villain of Cujo, it was a toss-up between the crappy Ford Pinto and Danny Pintauro. Having just said that, Cujo should have been called Getting Stuck in a Crappy Ford Pinto with Cry-baby Danny Pintauro While Being Terrorized by a Rabid Dog. Really, the movie is about the Ford Pinto, probably the worst car ever made in the history of automobiles. I was sort of surprised when the dog tried to break into the windows, they didn't actually break that easily enough. Honestly, I felt bad for Cujo, not the others. Really, his family should have apparently seen the bleeding that was coming off Cujo's nose and went ahead seeking medical treatment for him. Any sensible family would have done that. Looking at Cujo and how badly he looked, I wonder if there was actual animal abuse by the makers. Back to the film, it was a tale of two halves. First forty-minutes showed an extremely boring, soap-operatic tale that was needlessly necessary for the set-up of the second half. Before I knew it, the director had lost my interest forever because I was forced to wait for the film to begin. By the time Cujo started, it was basically about being stuck in a car until finally the woman wised up and got out of the situation in a predictable fashion. By the time the movie ended, I couldn't believe how bad the movie was. I wouldn't be surprised if Danny Pintauro confessed that he became homosexual after suffering a horrifying, traumatizing experience when he saw the abused-looking dog seeking for revenge. As for Cujo, I wouldn't go as far to call it a horror picture but a semi-drama involving an unfortunate situation. One redeeming value about Cujo is how well the characters appear to look like they suffered. The sad truth is that, at times, I was laughing a lot during some of the scenes in Cujo. All in all, although I am not a fan of films involving animal abuse and whatnots, Cujo is one crappy flick. See it only if you want to remember what was a Ford Pinto like these days, but don't see it if you hate Danny Pintauro.",1,It Was a Saint's Bernard for Chrissakes.,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2703,"['Viewed', '4/08Rate', '24/08', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'veteran', 'horror', 'films', 'back', 'stab', 'film', 'called', 'Cujo', 'originated', 'hand', 'Stephen', 'King', 'exception', 'very', 'few', 'writing', 'pieces', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'hardly', 'translate', 'movie', 'success', 'probably', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'abysmal', 'basically', 'idea', 'absurdly', 'stupid', 'time', 'Cujo', 'latter', 'category', 'When', 'saw', 'dog', 'was', 'looking', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'said', 'myself', 'Okay', 'St', 'Bernard', 'picked', 'up', 'Cujo', 'had', 'idea', 'Doberman', 'Rotweiler', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'identifying', 'real', 'villain', 'Cujo', 'was', 'toss-up', 'crappy', 'Ford', 'Pinto', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'Having', 'just', 'said', 'Cujo', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Getting', 'Stuck', 'Crappy', 'Ford', 'Pinto', 'Cry-baby', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'Being', 'Terrorized', 'Rabid', 'Dog', 'Really', 'movie', 'Ford', 'Pinto', 'probably', 'worst', 'car', 'ever', 'made', 'history', 'automobiles', 'was', 'sort', 'surprised', 'when', 'dog', 'tried', 'break', 'windows', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'break', 'easily', 'enough', 'Honestly', 'felt', 'bad', 'Cujo', 'not', 'others', 'Really', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'apparently', 'seen', 'bleeding', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'Cujo', 'nose', 'went', 'ahead', 'seeking', 'medical', 'treatment', 'sensible', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Looking', 'Cujo', 'how', 'badly', 'looked', 'wonder', 'was', 'actual', 'animal', 'abuse', 'makers', 'Back', 'film', 'was', 'tale', 'two', 'halves', 'First', 'forty-minutes', 'showed', 'extremely', 'boring', 'soap-operatic', 'tale', 'was', 'needlessly', 'necessary', 'set-up', 'second', 'half', 'knew', 'director', 'had', 'lost', 'interest', 'forever', 'was', 'forced', 'wait', 'film', 'begin', 'time', 'Cujo', 'started', 'was', 'basically', 'being', 'stuck', 'car', 'finally', 'woman', 'wised', 'up', 'got', 'situation', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'time', 'movie', 'ended', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'confessed', 'became', 'homosexual', 'suffering', 'horrifying', 'traumatizing', 'experience', 'when', 'saw', 'abused-looking', 'dog', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Cujo', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'horror', 'picture', 'semi-drama', 'involving', 'unfortunate', 'situation', 'One', 'redeeming', 'value', 'Cujo', 'how', 'well', 'characters', 'appear', 'look', 'suffered', 'sad', 'truth', 'times', 'was', 'laughing', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Cujo', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'films', 'involving', 'animal', 'abuse', 'whatnots', 'Cujo', 'one', 'crappy', 'flick', 'See', 'only', 'want', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'Ford', 'Pinto', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hate', 'Danny', 'Pintauro']",N/A

I love dogs and have never once met one I was scared of, but after seeing this film I have my reservations.  Taking a St. Bernard, a loyal and jovial dog and making it the prime baddy in this film was pure genius.  I feel that it was that fact that makes the film all the more terrifying.  If the dog had been a mere Pit Bull, something that many view as mean, it wouldn't have been so terrifying, but taking a dog that many view as a sweet and lovable animal made all the difference.  The film is about a dog that's biten by a rabid bat and goes pretty much insane.  I've never seen a rabid animal like this.  Most rabid animals are scared of humans and only attack after being provoked, wereas Cujo went out to stalk his prey.  A woman and her son are his latest targets and the center of this film revolves around these two stuck in their brokedown station wagon as Cujo tries to break in for a few days.  The acting is pretty good, and even though the boy was somewhat annoying, he was convincing in his terror.

361083,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303159966,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 12]","In 1983, director Lewis Teague unleashed a force more horrifying than anything that ever came from the mind of Stephen King.  Its name was: Danny Pintauro.  This sissified young actor would go on to almost completely nullify the obvious appeal of Alyssa Milano through all those years of Who's the Boss? before finally disappearing from the scene (hopefully for good).  It need never have happened.  Had Cujo never ""introduced"" Pintauro to the acting scene, I might never have been forced to come to terms with the fact that Will Wheaton was only the second most annoying child actor in the world.In terms of this film, let me say that, while there have been a number of less successful and ill-conceived adaptations of Stephen King's work, Cujo is my least favorite of all the Stephen King films.  Let's start with the fact that the novel is not conducive to a film adaptation in the first place - the idea of Cujo is a good one, but the characters and atmosphere of the story are as unappealing as meatloaf left out in the hot sun for about three months.  Vic Trenton (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is the only half-way sympathetic character to be found here, but he, unfortunately, looks like a reject from The Brady Bunch.  Then you have his wife Donna (Dee Wallace); not only is she unattractive, she is having an affair with one of her husband's friends.  And young Tad (Danny Pintauro) - I know he's a little kid, and we were all scared of the dark at that age, and all of us would have squawked incessantly if we were trapped in a car by a giant rabid hellhound, but he is just so incredibly annoying.  Less important characters, such as Donna's illicit boy toy and the dysfunctional Camber family, suck what little air is left over out of the room.  The town itself looks like it should have been abandoned ten years ago.  And the lighting - a sunny day has never been as depressing as what you see here.  I don't like the music, either, but I guess I've complained enough already.And what of Cujo himself?  Normally, as an animal lover, I would fall in love with any animal in a film.  Not Cujo.  Sure, he didn't go out and get rabies on purpose, but he had no business chasing that cute little bunny rabbit in to the bat-occupied hole in the ground in the first place.  On top of that, he proved unable to finish the job when he had the film's two least likable characters trapped.  I've got to give the canine actor his props, though, as he gave everything he had to this film.  He had to endure all kinds of miseries to take on the look of a rabid gigantic killer, and he held nothing back when told to attack people, cars, doors, windows - whatever.  He also, I am quite sure, did all of his own stunts.  Sadly, in yet another slap in the mug to canine actors everywhere, he was left entirely out of the credits.  He was the only actor in this production who deserved to have his name in lights, yet he didn't even rate the same dignity as the film's best boy and assistant cooks.Finally, I must say I was disheartened to find that the director lacked the courage to end the film the way Stephen King ended the novel.  A lot of people complained about King's ending, but it was the right one and should have carried over to the film adaptation.  Obviously, I pretty much hated watching Cujo, but I must admit that, by and large, it was a pretty good adaptation of King's novel (except for the ending, of course).

361084,A3GP4UPSW1OYXL,6303159966,"""Dark tower fan"" ""Aaron""","[0, 0]","I have seen this film quite a few times and have come to the conclusion that it is one of my favourtie horror films. It is gritty, raw and claustraphobic. A far more primal, gutteral Panic Room. All of the acting is convincing, especially Wallace Stone and the child. I also have never seen a child actor look quite as scared as this one does; to the extent that it makes me uncomfortable, its almost expolitative... i really feel that child was convinced that dog was going to eat him. It is slow building, which is such a releif after a decade of post Scream imitations that insist in shocking me into numbness within the first five minutes. The score is also well suited and Jan De Bont's cinematography is excellent; as what could have come across as fake and or cheesy, actually comes off as utterly convincing and really, really, really scary. Another thing that works well, is the use of colour. The yellows and browns that fill the movie make me feel like i'm there- sweating away inside that car and when the attacks are happening, i feel like the dirty quality of the image is the feel of Cujo's fur brushing against my skin. Scary.Essentially, it's a simple story- but a really good one. And unlike many Stephen King adaptations which deviate from the novel, the major changes are justified when you look at the film as it is. Had they wanted to make the film an extra half an hour longer, then perhaps Tad could have died... that's the only way it could have been done, in keeping with the pace of what preceeded. A wise, intelligent move. I wish there were more horror films like this.

361085,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,6303159966,David J. Brown,"[5, 6]","This film's story is simplicity itself.  It's the same as any old monster movie or Night Of The Living Dead.  Characters are stuck somewhere and the impending terror wants in, and they have to figure a way out.  Totally simple.  What this film does that makes it horror royalty and one of the good adaptions of King's work is that it keeps the main theme of irrational fears confronted with real fears from the novel.  Yes, we actually get to know the characters and understand them before they're thrust into the horror scenario.The film focus on a family of three, a father, mother and son.  All three are set up to have irrational fears as the film starts.  Monther is afraid of becoming old and cheats on her husband, who is a decent man, because she is bored with her new and more rural life.  Husband fears not being able to properly provide for his family, and that he'll lose his job.  Son fears the things that go bump in the night, living in his closet and under his bed.  It's not until mother and son are faced with a rabid dog by the name of Cujo does life fully come into perspective for them.  The killer dog is like a personification of all their fears shoving itself in their faces to wake them up into reality.  Of course to appreciate this new revelation they will have to survive....The acting in this film is all top notch.  Dee Wallace has always been one of my favorite actors.  She is really good at amping up the emotions and even making them big without becoming melodramatic.  Despite her adultery, adultery for no good reason(if there could be such a thing), you like her.  You understand her.  You appreciate her maternal instincts when it comes to protecting her son.  That is if you're not narrow minded or judgemental about fictional people that don't really exist or travel in your social circles.  I've always smiled when seeing other people judge those around them from a high horse, but I laugh violently when I see them judge fictional characters.The new special edition DVD is superb in picture quality and sound.  Finally, we get a widescreen transfer of this beautifully and horrifyingly shot film.  The last crappy editon was, for reasons unknown to me(does anyone in this day in age still actually prefer fullscreen?)a full frame release and was loaded with grain and a horrible audio track.  This new edition goes even further beyond upgrading the picture by providing new and interesting special features.  The making of Doc runs about an hour long and covers all the bases from everyone's perspective, from the actors, director, cinenatographer, and Stephen king himself.  There's also an audio commentary by the director, Lewis Teague(Alligator, Jewel of the Nile, Cat's Eye).  He doesn't just stick to going over what's playing on the screen but also goes into anecdotes and the history of the project in Hollyweird.  The only problem I have with this track is that Teague does repeat some info that was covered in the documentary, but it's sparse.Besides Teague's swift direction, some accolades must go to Jan De Bont, the director of photography for this movie.  I wish he had stayed a D.P. because he was much more interesting and talented in that field then he is as a director(The Haunting 1999,Tomb Raider:Cradle of Life, Speed 1&2).  But we have a bunch of old Verhoeven films and various other movies from the 70's and 80's that brandish his name as their D.P.  The camera moves are all natural, stylish and effective in further telling this story without blowhard expouses from the characters.Teague was and probably is still a wonderful filmmaker.  I'm not sure what he's done since the 80's, but I haven't heard from him in a while.  I would LOVE, if I had the power, to get this man back in the director's chair of a modern big budget film.  He's a lost talent.The only gripe I have with this addition is the cover artwork. I'm a real movie nerd and I love cool poster artwork.  The original poster for Cujo's theatrical run was really cool.  It was almost a sepia toned image of the old delapitated house with the picket fence and mailbox in the foreground.  The blood red lettered 'Cujo' appeared over this simple and basic image.  It was creepy and intriguing.  It gave no hints that this was about a killer dog.  The new DVD artwork is an improvement over the abomination that was the last DVD, but still isn't that good.  It's just an extreme close up of snarling, drool-encrusted dog death with a name tage reading the film's title.SIDENOTE:  A lot of King fans complained about the ending of this film.  ###MILD BOOK SPOILER###  In the book Tad dies.  His death leads the mother to take out her rage for survival against the infected dog.  It works in the book, but is kind of a downer.  It punishes the mother for her adultery in a very major way.  You end up sympathizing with her and even liking her towards the end of the story, so when Tad bites it, it's a real downer.  The film changed that by letting Tad live.  Many were upset.  There's actually folks who don't like this film just because of that.  On the documentary for the new DVD Stephen King declares the film's ending better and if he could, he would rewrite the ending to have Tad live. Even the King himself thought it was too much.  Interesting.

The story is simple; anyone of us could have written this plot.  If you live in the county there often are stories of rabid animals.  This one just took a slim occurrence and exaggerated it.  Although the story is basic and the acting at best is fair, the directing and editing are good; in fact they save this ""B"" film.  Maybe I've gotten numb to suspense and thrillers.  Maybe this was scary at the time it was produced in 1983; either way, unless you are collecting Stephen King works, this film is an occasional rental.

With all do respect we are not reviewing the book we are reviewing the movie. Cujo is a classic horror film in every sense of the word.  Terrifying, intelligent, realistic and ultimately unforgettable.  I wont go into the plot of the movie due to the fact that others already have quite well.  I would like to write about how I feel that Cujo is an underrated movie that does not get the credit it deserves.  I have noticed that a lot of individuals have complained about it being to slow and how it takes to long before the horror sets in.  This is called build up folks.  this is called character development.  The characters in this film are very believable.  There is not a bad performance to be found.  King himself said that Dee Wallace gave the best performance of any character he has ever written adapted to the screen.  That is a pretty huge statement considering how many memorable performances different actors have given in his movies, (Kathy Bates in Misery anyone).  Cujo himself is one of the all time movie villains.  An enormous mangy, slobbering, growling force of nature that would keep any sane human being locked in thier car until help came.  The special effects are top notch, especially considering the time it was made.  Cujo is a heavily atmospheric film as well.  The misty landscapes, setting suns and moody score really contribute to its overall tone.  There is such a palpable sense of helplessness you feel for the victims.  The movie never sales itself short or succumbs to over sentimentality.  It is a pretty gritty rollercoaster ride of a movie that manages to be genuinaly suspenseful.  When the credits role the viewer feels both drained and hyper do to the intense situation they were forced to view.  Anyone for a penchant for smart scary movies would be well advised to see this unforgettable 80's classic.",5,Nothing short of a Terrifying classic!,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,1924,"['Ok', 'have', 'read', 'lot', 'griping', 'how', 'book', 'was', 'soooo', 'much', 'better', 'do', 'respect', 'are', 'not', 'reviewing', 'book', 'are', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'Cujo', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'sense', 'word', 'Terrifying', 'intelligent', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'unforgettable', 'wont', 'go', 'plot', 'movie', 'due', 'fact', 'others', 'already', 'have', 'quite', 'well', 'would', 'like', 'write', 'how', 'feel', 'Cujo', 'underrated', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'credit', 'have', 'noticed', 'lot', 'individuals', 'have', 'complained', 'being', 'slow', 'how', 'long', 'horror', 'called', 'build', 'up', 'folks', 'called', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 'be', 'found', 'King', 'said', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'character', 'ever', 'written', 'adapted', 'screen', 'pretty', 'huge', 'statement', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'memorable', 'performances', 'different', 'actors', 'have', 'given', 'movies', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Misery', 'anyone', 'Cujo', 'one', 'time', 'movie', 'villains', 'enormous', 'mangy', 'slobbering', 'growling', 'force', 'nature', 'would', 'keep', 'sane', 'human', 'being', 'locked', 'thier', 'car', 'help', 'came', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'considering', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'Cujo', 'heavily', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'misty', 'landscapes', 'setting', 'suns', 'moody', 'score', 'really', 'contribute', 'overall', 'tone', 'such', 'palpable', 'sense', 'helplessness', 'feel', 'victims', 'movie', 'never', 'sales', 'short', 'succumbs', 'sentimentality', 'pretty', 'gritty', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'movie', 'be', 'genuinaly', 'suspenseful', 'When', 'credits', 'role', 'viewer', 'drained', 'hyper', 'do', 'intense', 'situation', 'were', 'forced', 'view', 'Anyone', 'penchant', 'smart', 'scary', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'advised', 'see', 'unforgettable', '80', 'classic']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","While watching CUJO, a grand film adaptation of one of Stephen King's best horror yarns, I cannot help but muse (or, in my case, bemuse):  Had the story taken place today, whereby a mother and her young son become trapped inside a rundown hatchback by a rabid St. Bernard, all mom would have to do is grab her cell, call 911, and in minutes Animal Control would be there to promptly dispatch the animal to Doggy Heaven.The lesson here is, technology negates a modern remake.  But I digress.So many of King's novels adapted to the big screen are startlingly mediocre, but CUJO is a delightful exception.  This movie is grand, hair-bristling fun, because we don't have some monster, or other metaphysical manifestation--we have a big dog that contracts rabies and as a result develops a serious attitude.  I don't care how much of a dog lover anyone professes to be, all of us are intimidated by a large, snarling, vicious dog; that's what makes CUJO so utterly and terrifyingly believable.  To enhance said believability, Dee Wallace is very convincing as the overwrought mother, and Danny Pintauro acts like all 6-year-old boys would act in such a dire situation (he screams and cries and complains a lot).  The pacing and suspense are keen, with just a tad discomfort for the Bad Momma moment at the end, but if heart-pounding suspense fits your bill, then take CUJO off his leash and enjoy.--D.

Seems stupid, right, telling the author of the work that is being produced as a major motion picture to sod off? Well, sticks and stones and glass houses and whatnot, 'cause this adaptation was creepy, endearing, and just a bit tragic.The film goes without the supernatural elements of the novel, but it does a great job insinuating that it is still present. Cujo's actors (the cast and crew seem unable to provide an actual count of the Saint Bernards in the film) presented a somewhat Hulk-ish mentality to annoyance v. destruction mode: loud noises, crying, etc pains Cujo, and he attacks. And we feel sympathy for the devil-dog.The BD presentation is great; I couldn't not believe the restored visual elements (a bit too restored, as I could easily see that Cujo was played by multiple dogs). It is a scenic, almost idyllic vista for the film... until the horror actually gets started, of course. I must too admit, I forgot how great the jarring soundtrack shocked you from tame to fangs. The 5.1 track is great, especially during the pivotal scene where Cujo attacks the car for what became a three-day siege. We are treated to a series of featurettes focusing on various elements of the film (called appropriately Dog Days) which recall the cast and crew's favourite moments during the arduous filming process.Fans of King's work probably already know all the praises of this, one of his better loved stories. And of course, who DOESN'T know who King is in the first place. If you don't, grab this BD (which a quite affordable upgrade from the standard DVD), and get to watching this seminal horror film.

361094,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,6303159966,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[5, 5]","When you think of successful early ""adapted from a Stephen King novel"" films, a few come to mind. From the greatest:Carrie, The Shining, Pet Sematary to the not-so-bad:Salem's Lot, Children of the Corn, Christine. But nessled right in the middle should be Cujo. For my generation, after this film was released anytime you saw a large strange dog in the near distance, your mind raced with the thoughts of this film.While still pretty effective, this film about a mother and son trapped inside their broken down Ford Pinto while a rabies-infected Saint Bernard terrorizes them from the outside in, still has plenty of scares even 25 years later. While not as classic as other Horror films of it's time, it did forever become the grandaddy of all maniac dog movies. So on that level alone, it comes from me to any Horror fan very suggested.However, it does have a few faults. Even though it was shot and released in 1983, this movie looks and feels like it was actually done in say 1976, down to it's starring car and ABC-Movie Of The Week musical score. Another is the 30 minutes of set-up at it's beginning showing the trials and downfalls of suburban marriage and family life at the time. Not that those 30 minutes hurt the movie, it actually sets up the characters for concern quite nicely, but to new fans of the movie they might wonder what drama film got accidently put in this Horror DVD's case.But once Cujo gets things a foamin' about 40 minutes in, all Hell breaks loose and let the intense claustrophobia begin. As for extras, there's a nice 50 minute documentary called ""Dog Days:The Making Of Cujo"" from 2007 that has crew and actors telling about how things were done quite informatively. Seeing a now 30 year old Danny Pintauro talking about his role when he was just six is nice to see a former child actor who can still remember the work much less live to tell about it. Also a directors commentary & an anamorphic picture with a high bit-rate, this is a worthy addition to any classic Horror collection.

Aside from its silly cover art, this is a hands-down classy flick with a complex story adding psychological strain to an already overbearing calamity.  It's true most movies don't live up to the book, and I read Cujo, the novel, long before I saw the film.  But I'd have to say the movie is better, much better in fact.  The novel isn't actually one of my favorite King stories..  So what makes this film better than the book?  The acting.  The 1983 cinematography is nice as well.  But it's the acting building over a suspensful, intelligent and fast moving plot, that leaves the deepest impression.Dee Wallace, who plays the mother in this one (she also starred in ""The Howling"") is just excellent.  Never have I seen a woman portray such fierce devotion to a child as her performance in this movie.  She should have won an Oscar. Kudos also go to the boy who plays her son.  His performance is on par with the little boy Danny in ""The Shining"", his terror at once utterly convincing and heartbreaking, to go along with his mother's.  Don't be surprised if you shed a tear.  The two of them JUST steal the show.  Oh, did I forget the dog?  He did a great job too!  One of the things that's so scary about this film is that nothing about it is based on the supernatural (as was also the case in Dolores Claiborne).  The dire situation that the characters find themselves in are without logic loopholes, adding to the overall beleivablity of the scenario.If you haven't seen Cujo, do it!

Cujo is a classic 80's-style horror movie about a grimly realistic scenario.  Up to that point, the King brand was known mainly for Carrie, Salem's Lot, and The Shining, stories about special powers and evil, paranormal creatures.  In Cujo, we get a story about two people trapped in a car with a huge, vicious, rabid dog outside and no way to get help.  The movie does a perfect job of making the viewer feel the claustrophobic terror that Donna and her young son Tad experience while trapped in mechanic  Joe Camber's driveway in a broken-down car out in the middle of nowhere.  Camber's been killed by the dog, mail service has been put on hold since Camber was supposed to have gone out of town, Donna's husband is on a business trip, and the one cop who comes to check if she's there gets killed by the dog.  Donna and Tad slowly dehydrate from the lack of water and sweltering temperature, and the dog just won't give up on its goal of having them both for dinner.  Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro deliver amazing performances as the lead characters, making the terrible situation much more believable with their portrayal of terror and hopeless frustration.  The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD has some great documentaries about the making of the movie, including how they got the dogs (yes, plural) to do all of the attacking, which offers some insight into the ""movie magic"" behind those terrifying scenes.  Overall, Cujo is one of the strongest adaptations of Stephen King's work and one of my favorite movies based on his writing.",5,One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1661,"['Cujo', 'one', 'movies', 'established', 'Stephen', 'King', 'name', 'not', 'only', 'writer', 'force', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'Cujo', 'classic', ""80's-style"", 'horror', 'movie', 'grimly', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'Up', 'point', 'King', 'brand', 'was', 'known', 'mainly', 'Carrie', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Shining', 'stories', 'special', 'powers', 'evil', 'paranormal', 'creatures', 'Cujo', 'get', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'trapped', 'car', 'huge', 'vicious', 'rabid', 'dog', 'way', 'get', 'help', 'movie', 'perfect', 'job', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'claustrophobic', 'terror', 'Donna', 'young', 'son', 'Tad', 'experience', 'trapped', 'mechanic', 'Joe', 'Camber', 'driveway', 'broken-down', 'car', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Camber', 'been', 'killed', 'dog', 'mail', 'service', 'been', 'put', 'hold', 'Camber', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'gone', 'town', 'Donna', 'husband', 'business', 'trip', 'one', 'cop', 'who', 'check', 'killed', 'dog', 'Donna', 'Tad', 'slowly', 'dehydrate', 'lack', 'water', 'sweltering', 'temperature', 'dog', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'goal', 'having', 'dinner', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Danny', 'Pintauro', 'deliver', 'amazing', 'performances', 'lead', 'characters', 'making', 'terrible', 'situation', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'terror', 'hopeless', 'frustration', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'great', 'documentaries', 'making', 'movie', 'including', 'how', 'got', 'dogs', 'yes', 'plural', 'do', 'attacking', 'insight', 'movie', 'magic', 'terrifying', 'scenes', 'Overall', 'Cujo', 'one', 'strongest', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'based', 'writing']",N/A

She knew I was into horror but I couldn't find the movie in the store. I bought the book which I thought was great and very well-written, percieving the story from the eyes of each character, including the dog during his change from mild-mannered and housebroken to rabid and terrifying.Well, the movie was a rather large letdown. The movie itself is a great example of the old saying ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" On the cover is a very sinister looking dog with blood red eyes. The dog in the movie doesn't look like that at all. The dog looks just messy and wet, with bloodstained fur and foaming at the mouth. It's not really as scary as it may sound (except when the dog jumps at the window. That freaked me out a little bit). The blood effects were pretty good but the mess with the affair wasn't as well done as in the book. The ending was perhaps the biggest disappointment, though, because it doesn't have the shocker the book did.Final Word: Decent, but definitely could've been better.

For years, the only way I had to view this classic horror treat was on an old DVD release with cropped edges, horrible picture, and NO special features at all.....not to mention the ugliest DVD artwork ever for a Stephen King release.Lionsgate has now given us Cujo as it has never been seen on home video.  I was blown away by how clear the picture is, and how vibrant the colors are.  The old transfer just seemed washed out and faded.  I watched this on my PS3, which upscales it to hi-def, and I never dreamed this film could ever look this good.  I'm also glad that there was no effort to try to create a surround sound track for this film, since most of it takes place inside a car.  You have the choice of watching it in the original mono, or a 2 channel stereo mix.  While this is not a film I would choose to show off my surround system, it is very effective for what is happening on screen.  Not only do we get treated to a remastered copy of the film, but Cujo also has some really good special features.  The 3-part documentary runs about 45 min. total, and is very informative about the way the film was made.  Both Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro take part in the documentary.  The director, Lewis Teague, also provides a good commentary track.  I only have two minor complaints:  1st, there is no trailer for Cujo and 2nd, with it being the 25th anniversary edition, I would rather have seen the artwork from the original movie poster as the cover.  I'm not complaining too much about the artwork since it is a huge improvement over the previous version, I just think the poster with the white picket fence and the word ""Cujo"" in blood was a great poster.Bottom line:  If you own the original DVD version of Cujo, put it in the doghouse.  You will be glad you upgraded to this fantastic version of what I think is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work on film.2013 Blu ray UPDATE:I just got my new copy of Cujo in the mail, and thought I would add this to my previous DVD review.Of course, the one thing you want to know; is this worthy of a double dip??  Well, that depends on how much you like this movie.  I'll break it down into a list of pros and cons, then you can make your own decision.PROS*  FINALLY, we get cover art from the original movie poster.  This packaging is AWESOME!!!  Original artwork is also reflected on the disc itself.*  New commentary from director Lewis Teague.  This is a really entertaining track.*  Sound seems to be remastered.*  When I saw the video of the 25th anniv. of Cujo, I thought it couldn't get better.  I have to admit that I was wrong.  This is the best Cujo has ever looked!!!  The HD transfer has obviously been remasteredsince the 25th anniv. edition.

Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this.

Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic.

The story is pretty thin, as was the book, but the suspense and the reality of the situation elevates the material. The events are not supernatural at all.

I saw this film in 1983, and everything in the movie was as I pictured it in the book.  Very good job with that.  The slow moving plot was necessary I think to get you to care about what happens to the characters.  It's hard to enjoy a movie if you don't feel some emotional attachment to the characters.  Overall, the story was very well done and when Cujo came on the scene, it kept you on the edge of your seat.  Now, for the bad news.  (Spoiler alert)  THEY LET THE TADDER LIVE.  ARRGGHHH!!!!  The way it ended spoiled the whole thing.  One thing I admired about this story was that it was one of King's most uncompromisingly honest.  He even mentions this in effect, saying, ""Sorry, folks.  Bad things do happen to children sometimes.  It's a fact of life.""  No, I don't enjoy seeing bad things happen to kids, but when Donna broke open the rear window of her car (using the butt of a policeman's gun of all things.  By the way, I'm surprised all that glass didn't get on Tad and cut him to pieces.) went into the house and resuscitaed Tad, this story lost all credibility.

What is distinguishable about those previous four films is the impressive reputations of the four directors attached to them; Brian De Palma, Tobe Hooper, Stanley Kubrick and George A. Romero respectively. Sadly with ""Cujo"" Lewis Teague fails to make the high grade these directors had established with their films. Teague was no doubt utilised due to his 1980 revolt of nature B movie ""Alligator"". With ""Cujo"" he would be treading similar but less fantastical territory. It is unfair to entirely blame Teague for the shortcomings of the film. The novel itself places great weight on a child and a dog, and one gets the impression Teague was on a hiding to nothing (creatively rather than commercially.). Even so the film is quite charming in the sequences prior to the titular St. Bernard's encounter with an angry rabies infested bat. But Teague fails to make convincing the tale of adultery and familial breakdown that is really at the heart of the story. The novel seeks to punish adultery, and the film still contains these echoes, but Teague is very much aware that this is a film about a killer dog. The result is a poorly scripted and poorly acted (Dee Wallace aside) film that seems slow and laboured. Nevertheless by the standards of the decade, ""Cujo"" has to be considered a reasonable effort, but Teague ultimately is unable to overcome the complexities and texture of the novel, which would have been more suited to the TV movie format.",2,A Dull Dog Day Afternoon.,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,1639,"['four', 'notable', 'largely', 'successful', 'adaptations', 'Carrie', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Shining', 'Creepshow', 'bubble', 'inevitably', 'had', 'burst', 'Stephen', 'King', 'translation', 'screen', 'What', 'distinguishable', 'previous', 'four', 'films', 'impressive', 'reputations', 'four', 'directors', 'attached', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'respectively', 'Sadly', 'Cujo', 'Lewis', 'Teague', 'make', 'high', 'grade', 'directors', 'had', 'established', 'films', 'Teague', 'was', 'doubt', 'utilised', 'due', '1980', 'revolt', 'nature', 'B', 'movie', 'Alligator', 'Cujo', 'would', 'be', 'treading', 'similar', 'less', 'fantastical', 'territory', 'unfair', 'entirely', 'blame', 'Teague', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'novel', 'great', 'weight', 'child', 'dog', 'one', 'impression', 'Teague', 'was', 'hiding', 'nothing', 'creatively', 'rather', 'commercially.', 'Even', 'film', 'quite', 'charming', 'sequences', 'prior', 'titular', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'encounter', 'angry', 'rabies', 'infested', 'bat', 'Teague', 'make', 'convincing', 'tale', 'adultery', 'familial', 'breakdown', 'really', 'heart', 'story', 'novel', 'seeks', 'punish', 'adultery', 'film', 'still', 'echoes', 'Teague', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'film', 'killer', 'dog', 'result', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'poorly', 'acted', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'aside', 'film', 'slow', 'laboured', 'Nevertheless', 'standards', 'decade', 'Cujo', 'be', 'considered', 'reasonable', 'effort', 'Teague', 'ultimately', 'unable', 'overcome', 'complexities', 'texture', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited', 'TV', 'movie', 'format']",N/A

But from then on, you just want to fast foward it to the good parts where Cujo starts killin', much like the book went when you might've scanned it, looking for the best parts. The movie wasn't lame, just a little moving as if you actually feel pity for that killer dog. And the DVD features no trailer.

In the first half, there's no humor or personality in the characters at all, so when the last half begins you start rooting for the dog to kill the annoying son and neurotic mother. Which brings me to the acting. This movie has got maybe the most annoying kid ever in a horror film, Tad Trenton. Even when the dog attacks don't occur, he whines like a baby. Such poor acting, huh! I was kinda waiting for Michael Myers to come knive him to death. He was THAT bad! He was not likable, humorous, or real; just a whiny baby that his mommy should have spanked HARD!

361163,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,6303159966,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[2, 3]","Most people know the basic plot of Stephen King's CUJO.  The title character, a gentle but huge St. Bernard is bitten by a rabid bat, contracts rabies and becomes a frothing maniacal monster that terrorizes some people most famously a mother and her young son stuck in a stalled yellow Pinto at a remote farm house.  The mother, Donna, played by Dee Wallace is not particularly sympathetic.  She's got a nice good looking husband who is apparently a good provider, a lovely waterfront house, a cute son and apparently nothing to do but run errands and have an affair with a not particularly attractive handyman.  Maybe her gripe with her husband is he runs around in a cute red convertible while she's stuck with this lemon of a Pinto?  Anyway the first half of the movie sets up Donna and her husband's family life and more briefly we get a look at Cujo's family - a mean car mechanic, his downtrodden wife and their son who seems like a nice enough kid.  Oh and we get to see poor Cujo bitten on the nose by the bat while he is chasing a rabbit.Events conspire so that Donna is caught by her husband with her boyfriend just as she is breaking the affair off.  Her husband is called away on business to Boston and goes off in a bit of a huff things being as they are.  The wife and cute son are left with the always breaking down Pinto and she with the little boy in tow drive it out to the remote farm where  Cujo's owner, the mechanic, lives and the terror begins.I read King's novel years ago and I thought I remembered quite a different ending from the one the movie depicts.  After reading some of the reviews on Amazon I see I remembered correctly.  One annoyance I had with the film it is supposed to be set in Maine but it is rather obviously filmed in Northern California.  And of course though I realize rabid animals are very dangerous would a dying dog really become a single minded killing machine like Cujo?  This is a decent movie that does have some really gripping scenes though I'd call it more of a thriller or suspense film than real horror and there really isn't anything overtly supernatural.
