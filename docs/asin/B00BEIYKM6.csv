I like dirt bikes, and the main character in the trailer (Gosling) rode one to get away from the cops. I was pleasantly surprised to find a very original and interesting story. Gosling's performance was really impressive, as were both of the teenage boys whose names escape me. Bradley Cooper's performance was a bit off, but it is possible that is because his character was kind of shallow. Ray Liotta played the same part he's played in half a dozen other pictures, and did it well, but I am not sure why his character was even necessary. All in all it was a very entertaining movie, but like many indies, could have been 45 minutes shorter without losing much.

1629012,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00BEIYKM6,Andre Dursin,"[2, 4]","Derek Cianfrance's second picture is an impressively shot, absorbing character study of two individuals: a struggling young man (Ryan Gosling) who makes several poor decisions in order to support his girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and their young son - even though she's already moved on with another man - and the cop (Bradley Cooper) whose life crosses paths with him and is irrevocably altered as a result.Although the picture runs nearly two-and-a-half hours, Cianfrance, Ben Coccio and Darius Marder's original screenplay can be summed up over the course of just a few sentences. For some viewers that may be an issue as ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (named for the film's Schenectady, New York setting) is definitely leisurely paced, though other viewers may find the picture's straight, uncluttered narrative to be refreshing. What's unquestionably remarkable is Cianfrance's spectacular use of widescreen - the angles and dimension of the movie's visual scope give the material dramatic heft, and with Sean Bobbit handling the cinematography, I'd go so far as to say this is one of the more memorably shot crime-dramas I've ever seen.""The Place Beyond the Pines"" doesn't have a powerhouse conclusion, and the movie's female leads don't have much to do (Rose Byrne's role is especially thankless), but this is nevertheless an ambitious and occasionally spellbinding dramatic work that signals great things may lie ahead for its director.Universal's Blu-Ray includes deleted/extended scenes, a Making Of featurette, commentary with Cianfrance, a DVD and digital copy.

1629014,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BEIYKM6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Ryan Gosling was in high demand this year from directors who had already used him to great effect.  You had Nicolas Winding Refn botch his second chance with the actor in the abominable &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217;, but Derek Cianfrance (who almost directed Gosling to an Oscar nomination in &#8216;Blue Valentine&#8217;) made the most of his second experience with the actor to give us a very strong character, performance, film&#8230;whatever you want to call it.  While &#8216;The Place Beyond the Pines&#8217; has its faults (and we&#8217;ll get to those in a minute), the film has a presence that is FELT, and both director and actor(s) do their best to create, maintain and sustain that presence.&#8216;The Place Beyond the Pines&#8217; is essentially a three-part story; a tapestry piece of sorts that has stronger ties than your average &#8216;interwoven&#8217; storyline.  You have the first half, which focuses on a young and reckless motorcycle stunt rider who has becomes aware of his young son only to walk into a sticky situation when he realizes that his baby&#8217;s mother has moved on.  Determined to provide for his child and win back his baby-mamma, he turns to a life of crime.This is where the film&#8217;s second act picks up, where we have a newly promoted police officer dealing with the consequences (both moral and legal) of a shootout that caused the death of the aforementioned motorcycle driver.  Plagued with a sharply ambiguous guilt (is it real guilt over his actions or more remorse over the consequences?), this cop finds himself being taken advantage of by cops on the force, a punching bag and maneuverable pawn piece until he takes matters into his own hands and carves out his future with the press of a &#8216;record&#8217; button.And then we are shot forward over a decade to a school cafeteria where this cop and this deceased motorcycle rider are reunited in part due to their sons, who happen to strike up an unlikely friendship.Each part has its strengths, but the film does undergo a gradual decline with each passing section.  The first part is by far the most inspired and it sets up the film for a real nice progression of character development, which DOES carry through into the second section (and, surprise-surprise, Bradley Cooper gives the best performance in the film) in a great way as we watch this cop deal with his current predicament (and honestly, the character of Avery Cross is such an interesting one), and despite the clich&eacute;d &#8216;dirty cop&#8217; angle, the second act survives on the strength of Cooper&#8217;s portrayal of EVERY crevice of this man&#8217;s identity.  Still, the film is almost uprooted completely by the third act, which feels like such a lazy tack-on in so many ways.  First, the idea that the two sons would meet by pure coincidence feels very uninspired, but the primary idea of this film (the whole &#8216;sins of the father&#8217; mantra) is force fed in a rather ridiculous manner (especially that final scene) that it feels sadly dishonest.  Derek Cianfrance had a great opportunity to build a marvelous character study (which is &#8216;almost&#8217; did) wrapped in a truly inspired prose, but his prose suffers from lack of originality when it comes to &#8216;making it all work&#8217;.  As individual parts, maybe (although outside of Dane DeHaan&#8217;s performance, I really see no redemption for that third act), but as a whole the film starts to feel drug out and uneven; scattered even.And still, the impact is felt and that presence lingers from frame to frame thanks to breathtaking cinematography and visual scope, and those tailored and uniform (so cohesive) performances.  Gosling, Cooper and DeHaan really connect from act to act, anchoring their segments in a real grasp of identity.  Even DeHaan, who has to muddle through some really trite character developments (the fight scene, the kidnapping and the final scene all reek of &#8216;obvious&#8217;), finds ways to FEEL through each moment in a way that earns our trust.  You believe him, even if his story makes little sense.But I don&#8217;t think I can praise Bradley Cooper enough, and I really didn&#8217;t expect to EVER say that.  I still remember being baffled throughout most of last year&#8217;s awards season and being in complete denial about Cooper&#8217;s Oscar chances.  Like, how is this guy suddenly a good actor?  Seriously, he&#8217;s brilliant here.  He understands the small things, the slight details that color in a complete character.  The best thing about the character of Avery is that he is a complete and total fake; a self-promoting jerk who NEEDS to be loved and respected, yet Cooper never shies away from making him human and exposing his frailty in a very honest progression of emotions and reactions.",4,The sins of the father&#8230;,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,4806,"['Ryan', 'Gosling', 'was', 'high', 'demand', 'year',

Granted this film doesnt have the humourous or bizarre Lynch elements but then Cianfrance who has been working on film since the age of 13 (argh so jealous ...I made a few films at 14 but had no luck..and slowly gave up). And has studied film seriously since then. I havent seen his other movies yet but TPBTP makes me want to see what else he has done.Some have said the movie is too slow moving and the third part is like a long drawn out epilogue.  It is slow moving but also has some rattling energetic chase scenes and at least three or four very tense confrontations. In other words it doesnt put you to sleep.I thought it did get a bit to reflective/instrospective and all that.  Characters wallowing (for years) over an event (one his child he can't be with and the other a violent act he almost was forced to commit).  Sure tough stuff but as a film it can only carry a film so far.  I for one like films where there is a transition a change etc in a characters predicament.That said though four stars for the atmospher the film creates.  Again very Lynch like: a world with dark places and light shining through the dark where its unexpected.  This is a grim film but it has hints of hope unlike many other grim dark films where things just get worse and worse .Finally I really got to admit the scene with the three motorcycles in the Iron ball was great.

He had the materials: fine actors; compelling premise; a visually interesting approach.  Still, it stalled.  Two fathers, criminal and cop, intersect in the criminal's death, both leaving infant sons in the terrified care of their mothers. The cop, conflicted over the killing, nevertheless rides his &#34;hero&#34; hype into a political career, neglecting his son along the way.  Fifteen years pass, and who'd a thunk it, the sons meet up and appear to be the victims of their DNA....one exhibiting his cop father's careless arrogance and the other riding off to an uncertain but violent future.  It just dragged and dragged on.  There is the nature versus nurture issue sloooooooowly emerging.  The criminal's kid (an infant when his dad died) his raised in a good family with a loving stepfather yet seems to have his father's innate angst stamped on his soul.  The cop's kid, initially a punk, gets a little starstruck seeing his father elected Atty General. Speaking of history repeating, Ryan Gosling is &#34;James Dean&#34; hot with a cig hanging out of his tattooed face and doing that steely-eyed stare and deadpan delivery that he is becoming typecast for.

There&#8217;s a poeticism to Cianfrance&#8217;s images, like in Blue Valentine, but unlike many skilled auteurs, Cianfrance imagines his new film with a whole new visual palette, in terms of blocking, movement and color, and it&#8217;s equally stunning. The Place Beyond the Pines is haunting. Sometimes hauntingly sad and other times hauntingly beautiful. There's a moment of forgiveness and mercy in this film, which shines as a beacon of light bursting through the overwhelming hopelessness of the rest.

Quickly he found out she had a son as a result and he pursued after her and her baby despite she already had a manwho took care of her and her family.This first part of the film already looked contrived and indifferent for the viewer towards this unsympathetic character.To make the matter/film worst, he became a bank robber attempting to lure the woman and baby back.During one of his failed robbery, he was chased by a young rookie cop played by Bradley Cooper who shot and killed him.(Exit Ryan Gosling who quickly becoming a boring actor to watch and entering Bradley Cooper who managed to shine at leastduring his rookie cop years.)The story then switched to this rookie cop involving stolen money, drugs, police corruption and set ups.Luckily this cop's father was a prominent judge who mentored and supported him.All of this is so cliche.The screenwriters seemed to run out of storyline to tell, so they came up with the ""Fifteen Years Later"" Act 3,about this rookie cop becoming a lawyer running for district attorney and the relationships between his son and his high school classmate whohappened to be the son of the robber that his father killed.After the robber's son found out who's the killer of his father, he tried to gun down his father's killer.So, what's the place beyond the pines?

1629042,A1PHUCTJ9X9EHJ,B00BEIYKM6,Christ's Soldier,"[0, 0]","I am going to give this movie 4 stars because it wasn't fo lack of effort that it fell short. This film sort of reminded me of a film by Quentin tarrantino because it was like a bunch of small stories made into 1 long movie. I almost gave it 3 stars because my heart aches and hurts a little because they only *spoiler alert* had ryan goslin in the film for less than the first half. I think the film would have been 5 stars if they could have somehow given ryan g. a bigger part. Even though iknow the whole heartwrenching plot was because of what happened to him. Still I can't help but think some good rewriters good have spruced this film up from a 3 star film into a 5 star film. I really do think this film had a lot of potential  and personally I would give it a 3 because I don't like sad films or when they write out a main character unless it's only to come back later (sort of like Sherlock holmes, or recently like michelle rod in fast n furious). I like action adventure , happy endings, romance, but most importantly the good guy winnind and bad guy losing with a happy ending like I said. But here it's almost like a half a$$'d attempt at turning real life into a happy ending. Real life sucks and we watch movies to live if only for a short while in a land that we wish we were apart of. For those who love this film I simply adored the complexity of tying everyone's lives together. It was simple, predicatable but yet entertaining. I think that ryan goslin by far made this movie what it is. My point is just that it's ashame that they could not have allowed him somehow to be in the entire film * Spoiler( But I get it. His memory lives on through his son and that the ""happy ending"" we are all so magically supposed to arrive at by watching him ride off into the sunset. Be a little more creative. Show his son come back on the same road 10 years later like all ninja on a bike meet a girl like eva mendes his own age, they go on a bank robbing spree, get away with it, get the da to confess to a wrongful death (bradly cooper) and then ride off into the sunset. It also just seemed the movie was a little incomplete  thus falling short of a Hollywood blockbuster. But like I said good try and nice effort therefore I give you a 4 instead of a 3. I mean the title says it all. They try to make an action packed motorbike movie into a romantic tragic tale of what probably happens in real life.My final thought is that they could have made the first half of the film into 1 separate film and developed it where ryan g gets the girl, or ryan g. goes into coma comes back years later, exposes eveyrthinga nd kicks butt and gets the girl, or son grows up and takes control of everything. I don't know I just think it was too sad for me but for those who don't mind sad films this was you will definitely like!

1629051,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYKM6,C. Sawin,"[54, 66]","Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) has a good thing going with a traveling carnival. He's got a pocketful of fame thanks to his motorcycle stuntman status and makes just enough money to get by. He meets up with Romina (Eva Mendes), an old fling, in Schenectady, New York and finds out that their one night together resulted in a little one year old boy named Jason. Luke quits the carnival and intends to provide for his son, but Romina has moved on and is currently in a relationship with Kofi (Mahershala Ali). Luke crosses paths with a mechanic named Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) who talks Luke into robbing a few banks to get some quick cash to support his newfound fatherhood. But Luke gets addicted to the thrill of the hunt and the money and gets overzealous, which attracts the New York police department and rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) in particular.Director Derek Cianfrance last worked with Ryan Gosling in ""Blue Valentine"" from 2010, which got a noticeable amount of attention due to its original NC-17 rating. Upon realizing that it really wasn't all that graphic, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating upon review. None of that controversy is attached to ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" but it certainly earns its R-rating with its constant use of vulgarity, a few really violent sequences, and the use of drugs and alcohol with an underage crowd.The film opens with the camera following a tattooed from head to toe Ryan Gosling in a red and black bomber jacket at a carnival before he enters a steel cage ball along with his motorcycle on full throttle and his two ""heartthrobs."" Take note of this sequence along with how similar a sequence near the end of the film is shot as it follows another character. The crime drama is sandwiched between trailing two specific characters and countless establishing shots of beautiful pine forests and meandering roads.Ryan Gosling seems to wear nothing but a series of tattered T-shirts, which attracts a braless Eva Mendes. You can practically feel the open air as Luke rides his bike through the woods and even when it seems like he's wandering aimlessly out in the middle of nowhere. The film is this constant juggle of intensity and raw human emotion. The bank robberies are aggressive and energetic. Gosling's squeaky threats only seem to heighten the situation. The moments where Luke is trying to spend time with his son are tender and powerful. While Luke may have traveled down the wrong path, his intentions were good. So it's this ""all the wrong things for all the right reasons"" kind of deal.Everything becomes really unpredictable around the time Bradley Cooper enters the picture. Every time you begin to think that you have the film figured out it strays down a different path. Ben Mendelsohn seems to have been everywhere since ""The Dark Knight Rises."" His on-screen chemistry with Gosling is fascinating because it's difficult to determine whether they're bonding as friends or if it's one man taking advantage of another. You are literally entranced with Mendelsohn's deep blue eyes on more than one occasion. Ray Liotta also grabs your attention despite having minimal screen time. The Deluca character is so crooked that you can't help but enjoy his despicable nature. It was also enjoyable to see Dane DeHaan have a sizable role. Dehaan is making quite the name for himself for characters on the verge of adulthood.Some may label ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" as slow and boring, but it's actually intense, methodical, and easily one of the most captivating films of the first part of the year. Not knowing where the film is going to go is a huge luxury. It strings you along this intriguing path of corruption that also touches on the price of being a good cop that is currently caught in the spotlight. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is both unique and satisfying in the way it comes full circle and is so engrossing thanks to how lugubrious it is in nature.",5,The first exceptional film of 2013,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3927,"['Luke', 'Glanton', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'got', 'pocketful', 'fame', 'thanks', 'motorcycle', 'stuntman', 'status', 'just', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'up', 'Romina', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'old', 'fling', 'Schenectady', 'New', 'York', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'together', 'resulted', 'little', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Jason', 'Luke', 'carnival', 'provide', 'son', 'Romina', 'moved', 'currently', 'relationship', 'Kofi', 'Mahershala', 'Ali', 'Luke', 'paths', 'mechanic', 'named', 'Robin', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'who', 'talks', 'Luke', 'robbing', 'few', 'banks', 'get', 'quick', 'cash', 'support', 'newfound', 'fatherhood', 'Luke', 'addicted', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'money', 'overzealous', 'New', 'York', 'police', 'department', 'rookie', 'cop', 'Avery', 'Cross', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'particular.Director', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'last', 'worked', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Blue', 'Valentine', '2010', 'got', 'noticeable', 'amount', 'attention', 'due', 'original', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'realizing', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'MPAA', 'gave', 'film', 'R-rating', 'upon', 'review', 'None', 'controversy', 'attached', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'certainly', 'R-rating', 'constant', 'use', 'vulgarity', 'few', 'really', 'violent', 'sequences', 'use', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'underage', 'crowd.The', 'film', 'camera', 'following', 'tattooed', 'head', 'toe', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'red', 'black', 'bomber', 'jacket', 'carnival', 'steel', 'cage', 'ball', 'motorcycle', 'full', 'throttle', 'two', 'heartthrobs', 'Take', 'note', 'sequence', 'how', 'similar', 'sequence', 'end', 'film', 'shot', 'character', 'crime', 'drama', 'sandwiched', 'trailing', 'two', 'specific', 'characters', 'countless', 'establishing', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'pine', 'forests', 'meandering', 'roads.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'wear', 'nothing', 'series', 'tattered', 'T-shirts', 'braless', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'can', 'practically', 'feel', 'open', 'air', 'Luke', 'bike', 'woods', 'even', 'when', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'film', 'constant', 'juggle', 'intensity', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion', 'bank', 'robberies', 'are', 'aggressive', 'energetic', 'Gosling', 'squeaky', 'threats', 'only', 'seem', 'heighten', 'situation', 'moments', 'where', 'Luke', 'trying', 'spend', 'time', 'son', 'are', 'tender', 'powerful', 'Luke', 'may', 'have', 'traveled', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'intentions', 'were', 'good', 'wrong', 'things', 'right', 'reasons', 'kind', 'deal.Everything', 'becomes', 'really', 'unpredictable', 'time', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'picture', 'time', 'begin', 'think', 'have', 'film', 'figured', 'down', 'different', 'path', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'have', 'been', 'everywhere', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Gosling', 'fascinating', 'difficult', 'determine', ""'re"", 'bonding', 'friends', 'one', 'man', 'taking', 'advantage', 'are', 'literally', 'entranced', 'Mendelsohn', 'deep', 'blue', 'eyes', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'also', 'grabs', 'attention', 'having', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'Deluca', 'character', 'so', 'crooked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'despicable', 'nature', 'was', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'have', 'sizable', 'role', 'Dehaan', 'making', 'quite', 'name', 'characters', 'verge', 'adulthood.Some', 'may', 'label', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'slow', 'boring', 'actually', 'intense', 'methodical', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'films', 'first', 'part', 'year', 'Not', 'knowing', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'go', 'huge', 'luxury', 'intriguing', 'path', 'corruption', 'also', 'price', 'being', 'good', 'cop', 'currently', 'caught', 'spotlight', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'unique', 'satisfying', 'way', 'full', 'circle', 'so', 'engrossing', 'thanks', 'how', 'lugubrious', 'nature']",N/A

This is not a bad story just one stretched past its natural length.  Its themes are obvious and its outcome is apparent way before the film is over.  Credit Cianfrance for making watchable relatively thin material and even making it somewhat interesting.  The primary theme of the film is that events in life come full circle.  Luke(Ryan Gosling) is a stunt cyclist on the carnival circuit when he finds out he has a child from a past tryst.  Without two dimes to rub together he is encouraged to take up bank robbing.  The first few jobs go smashingly but Luke doesn't know when to stop.  Because his first few capers went down easily he gets sloppy on his next one.  The bank is ready for him and the result is a high speed chase with the police in pursuit.  His main pursuer is a rookie patrolman on a corrupt police force, Avery(Bradley Cooper), who has a wife and newborn.  Ultimately it comes down to a faceoff between Luke and Avery in a house where Luke is holed up.  I try to avoid spoilers but I think you can read between the lines as to where this film is going.

It's too bad the story doesn't deserve such a terrific performance. Yes, Ray Liotta is a good bad guy, and that guy from Alias is a good nervous cop with a bad bad shoot, and on and on.

1629064,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00BEIYKM6,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","I've mainly seen Bradley Cooper do comedy (and do it very well), while the few movies I've seen featuring Ryan Gosling have all been mostly forgettable.  But crikey, can these two actors do drama, as evidenced by THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES, a gripping, highly poignant tale about guilt, angst, rebellion, and redemption.  And as this film comes full circle, we watch as a second generation of sons slowly connects the dots to the actions of their fathers.  And actions very much have consequences.Ryan Gosling plays Luke, a daredevil motorcycle stuntman who turns to crime once he learns he's fathered a son via a brief interlude with a groupie (Eva Mendes).  He robs banks to support the child, which brings him into contact with law enforcement, in particular, an officer named Avery (Bradley Cooper).  As the first act of this film concludes, Avery confronts Luke during a violent shootout.  (*Spoiler alert!*)  Luke subsequently is killed, while Avery is consumed by guilt that he's killed the father of a toddler the same age as his own son.  Avery's police force is ruthlessly corrupt; in fact, they've stolen all the money Luke has taken and hidden under his son's crib.  The second portion of the film concerns Avery's exposing the corrupt force, putting fellow officers in jail, and moving on to the District Attorney's office.  The story fast forwards around fifteen years later, with Luke's son, Jason (Dane DeHaan), a brooding loner, while Avery's son, AJ (Emory Cohen), is a rebellious teen.  With both teens unaware of the connection between their fathers, they become dysfunctional friends.  And finally, once Jason learns the truth about Avery's involvement in his father's death, there is an attempt at revenge which moves towards begrudging redemption.The supporting cast is stellar, including Mahershala Ali, Rose Byrne, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ray Liotta.  One star off due to the film's needless length, with its subsequent meandering.  Yet overall, THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a compelling drama headlined by two actors who definitely need to take on more of these darker roles.  Gosling and Cooper demonstrate remarkable range.--D.

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[1, 2]","One of the better movies of 2013, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" tells a tragic tale of family, honor, dishonor, loyalty, and karma.  The movie opens with Ryan Gosling trying to reconnect with his previous girlfriend (very well played by Eva Mendez).  Trouble is, she's already ""connected"" with someone else, even though she still probably loves him.  Gosling finds out--almost by accident--that he fathered a child, and decides to quit his local job on the carnival circuit as a motorcycle daredevil to provide for his child.  Out of work, out of money, and pretty desperate, he hooks up with his father (I think) who convinces him it is his destiny to help him rob banks.  They have their plan pretty well oiled out, until (naturally) there's a chink in the armour, and things begin to unfold in a way I never saw coming.That is all I'm going to give away as far as the plot, because to give anymore away would be ruinous to the film.  I will say, however, that this film proves that it isn't always the good guys who win.  In life, you'll find more than likely, the bad guys seem to win.  Karma may bite some people on the a $ $, but it isn't always the right people.

1629068,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00BEIYKM6,Doug Anderson,"[1, 3]","Spoilers: (Some plot summary/details revealed along with film analysis).The film is set in a small New York town in the mid 1980's. Our first image of Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a scary one. He's a shirtless tattooed bleached blonde daredevil warming up for his performance by playing with two switchblade knives. The camera follows him from his trailer to a circus tent where he climbs onto a motorcycle before an awaiting crowd and into a ball of death with two other riders. His life is a performance. A series of poses. Each pose is an evocation of cool. And cool only has two faces: not-quite-of-this-world detached and tired-of-this-life weary. And the crowds love it. Especially the kids. He wears a Metallica t-shirt. He's the smalltown carnival equivalent of a rock star. He signs autographs after each show. But he only has those two poses/attitudes and they pretty much define this character who seems to look right through this world as if there's nothing in it for him. He's a mesmerizing presence. Every second he's onscreen in his eighties bleached hair and jeans and torn t-shirts and knife-with-tear tattoo is electric. But thats all the world sees. And maybe thats all he sees too until he finds out he has a child by a local girl named Romina (Eva Mendez). Only then do we get a glimpse of what's beyond the image. When he sees his child we realize that this daredevil can be man-angel sweet and charmingly funny. But we also realize that this daredevil charmer can also be an ice cold sociopath when he feels threatened or when things do not go his way and they almost never do. Romina is a realist, she works in a diner, and she figures out pretty quick that Glanton as hard as he might want to believe he can make this work is not daddy material. Regardless of her perception, he seems to think he is and so he quits the carnival gig and decides to stick around and convince her that they can be a family. Unfortunately for Glanton, his skill set is limited, all he really knows how to do is ride his motorcycle and it is while trail riding that a local schemer spots his unique talents. Eventually the two begin robbing banks. Glanton in his twisted way thinks this is a way to prove to Romina that he can be a provider. The bank robberies are intense. Especially the mororcycle getaways. They give us a chance to see just how desperate Glanton is to make a normal life for himself. But before that normal life can begin, the law catches up to him. Once he realizes its over he phones Romina and requests that she never tell his son about him. In his final moments it's as if he is willing himself out of existence. The look on his face as the camera pulls away from it for the last time is mysterious: Glanton's expression is not of a guilty man who knows his time is up but one of a proud father. The expression will haunt the cop who killed him for the rest of his life. There was only one place where Luke Glanton was at peace with himself and at home in the world, and that was racing on his motorcycle through a forest of pine trees. The other thing that made him happy was holding his child.Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) is the cop who caught up to and killed Glanton (perhaps needlessly) and he is the center of the second part of this three part film and he too has a young son the same age as Glanton's and he's haunted by what he's done. It certainly doesn't feel heroic. But he's a guy with too much education to be a blue collar cop all his life. And he knows it. So he uses what leverage he has (his hero status and his knowledge of corruption in the department) to wrangle a white collar job that eventually leads to a political career. But because he cannot connect to people (especially not his son) each of these roles are just empty images, surfaces, with nothing beneath. Cross is a man as uncomfortable being human as Glanton was. But he keeps his distance from humanity in a different way--by acquiring power and wealth. The void at the center of his life is simply plastered over with campaign posters. It will take a strange act of revenge that turns into an act of forgiveness to bring him back to life.In the third act (which takes place 15 years after the first) the teenage sons of long dead outlaw Luke Glanton and ex-cop/now politician Avery Cross meet at their high school. Both of the teenagers are social outcasts (with dads who are either dead or absent) but Glanton's kid has a harder time because like his dad (who he never knew) he cannot find a satisfying role to play; Cross's kid has an easier time of it because, like his dad, he knows how to play the social roles that are available to him. The two bond unaware of the way that their lives (through their fathers) are linked. But Glanton's kid soon figures out who both of their fathers were/are and considers seeking revenge. But doesn't. The last image we have of Cross's son is onstage playing the role of politician's son (a sign that he has reconciled with his father). The last image we have of Glanton's son is aboard a motorcycle riding away over hills surrounded by pines (a sign that he too has reconciled or at least has begun the process of reckoning with his father as well).Derek Cianfrance (BLUE VALENTINE) directs but this film (or at least the first third of it) looks and feels exactly like Nicolas Winding Refn's nihilist masterpiece DRIVE. The first act of this three act film deserves 4 stars, the second and third acts work fine but are far less inspired and compelling (playing more like a Lifetime movie than an action thriller)-- without Gosling's superstar presence the film just loses steam and drags (like watching your favorite team without the MVP) so those last two acts are more in the 3 star range. If you are a huge fan of DRIVE (and I am) you will love the first act and find the rest of the film slow but worthwhile. If DRIVE didn't do it for you, this one certainly won't either. The soundtrack (which includes nice uses of Springsteen's ""I'm on Fire"" and Bon Iver's ""Wolves"") is fine but nowhere near as compelling as the DRIVE soundtrack.",4,Fathers and Sons,1366416000,"04

1629069,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00BEIYKM6,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.5 stars}I put off watching THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES because of the mixed reviews here and elsewhere, and quickly learned what a positive sign mixed reviews can be. This film comprises an intelligent, well-acted, and well-filmed story that spans two generations, involving a wild but believable chain of coincidences. It has a number of twists and keeps you guessing what will happen next but is still very lucid in the end. Without being the least bit heavy-handed, it's revealing of all sorts of things about this life, such as how much the results can differ between those on the ""right"" and those on the ""wrong"" sides of the law even when they're  playing basically the same game and aren't much different in their tactics. (Also, how the crime that most often does one in is simply not knowing when to stop and getting caught.)The most common criticisms of THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES seem to be ""too long"" and ""boring."" Granted, it's not an ""action film"" per se; PBP moves at a very natural pace. All the same, plenty happens: I did not find one truly dull stretch throughout its 140 minutes and did not want it to end. While not a happy story in its own right, PBP has its happier moments; while grim and violent in several places, with some mild gore, there's nothing gratuitous in these areas. It's never particularly funny, nor does it try to be, but it's not deliberately grim either. There are a few blank spots here and there, most of which are probably best left blank. One or two details are also a little hard to buy--e.g., the photo and $ kept by Avery. Yet, viewed from any major angle, THE PLACE BEYOND the PINES is a truly fine film.Great performances by Gosling and Cooper, as well as by Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan as sons AJ and Jason. Still, the people-in-general here are all very real and immediate, and no actor or character completely dominates the show.",5,"""Hey, what's the deal with my dad?""",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,1885,"['4.5', 'stars', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'THE', 'PLACE', 'BEYOND', 'PINES', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'quickly', 'learned', 'what', 'positive', 'sign', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'intelligent', 'well-acted', 'well-filmed', 'story', 'two', 'generations', 'involving', 'wild', 'believable', 'chain', 'coincidences', 'number', 'twists', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'still', 'very', 'lucid', 'end', 'being', 'least', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'revealing', 'sorts', 'things', 'life', 'such', 'how', 'much', 'results', 'can', 'differ', 'right', 'wrong', 'sides', 'law', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'basically', 'same', 'game', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'tactics', 'Also', 'how', 'crime', 'most', 'often', 'one', 'simply', 'not', 'knowing', 'when', 'stop', 'getting', 'caught', 'most', 'common', 'criticisms', 'THE', 'PLACE', 'BEYOND', 'PINES', 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'boring', 'Granted', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'se', 'PBP', 'very', 'natural', 'pace', 'same', 'plenty', 'happens', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'one', 'truly', 'dull', 'stretch', '140', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'end', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'PBP', 'happier', 'moments', 'grim', 'violent', 'several', 'places', 'mild', 'gore', 'nothing', 'gratuitous', 'areas', 'never', 'particularly', 'funny', 'try', 'be', 'not', 'deliberately', 'grim', 'either', 'are', 'few', 'blank', 'spots', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'left', 'blank', 'One', 'two', 'details', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'hard', 'buy', 'e.g.', 'photo', 'kept', 'Avery', 'viewed', 'major', 'angle', 'THE', 'PLACE', 'BEYOND', 'PINES', 'truly', 'fine', 'film.Great', 'performances', 'Gosling', 'Cooper', 'as', 'well', 'Emory', 'Cohen', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'sons', 'AJ', 'Jason', 'Still', 'people-in-general', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'immediate', 'actor', 'character', 'completely', 'show']",N/A

But action, like the Mohawks themselves, is nearly extinct from this ambitious film about the multi-generational influence of fathers on sons. Not only is the action sparse, the actors themselves are not on screen as much as you'd expect from the coming attractions or from the poster. Ryan Gosling disappears about 1/3 of the way into the film, just about the same time that Bradley Cooper finally makes his appearance. And Ray Liotta is barely in 3 scenes.But the lack of action and the scarcity of named players are not the main problems with this film. The film suffers from an overly ambitious attempt to be epic. Instead, it is merely long. Boorishly long. Too much time is spent on minor details and too little time is spent on the major plot points. You can tell that there was an excellent story here, and perhaps as a mini-series or in the hands of a more craftful director, we'd have a great film.The director, BTW, is Derek Cianfrance. This is his third film, following ""Blue Valentine"" (2010) that also featured Gosling.  He is clearly without sufficient experience to take on the ambitious agenda that he sets out as a co-writer for the film.Another major problem is the aging of the characters, who go 15+ years during the film and barely age at all. The only exception is Eva Mendes who does a great job moving from late teens to middle age.The film is not without merit. The photography by Sean Bobbitt is excellent. His hand held work following Gosling's motorcycle exploits is breath-taking.And there are contributions by veteran actors like Bruce Greenwood (plays a DA) and Harris Yulin (Cooper's father) who really add to the quality of the film. Two newcomers, Emory Cohen (Coopers's son) and Dane DeHaan (Gosling's son) do a great job, and I can imagine that with a better script or a more focused film, their work would shine.Bottom line - an ambitious but ultimately a failed film.",2,"Ambitious, but unsuccessful",1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2028,"['Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'refers', 'Mohawk', 'name', 'city', 'Schenectady', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'action', 'Mohawks', 'nearly', 'extinct', 'ambitious', 'film', 'multi-generational', 'influence', 'fathers', 'sons', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'sparse', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'screen', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'coming', 'attractions', 'poster', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', '1/3', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'finally', 'appearance', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'barely', '3', 'scenes.But', 'lack', 'action', 'scarcity', 'named', 'players', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'problems', 'film', 'film', 'suffers', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'be', 'epic', 'Instead', 'merely', 'long', 'Boorishly', 'long', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'minor', 'details', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'excellent', 'story', 'here', 'perhaps', 'mini-series', 'hands', 'more', 'craftful', 'director', ""'d"", 'have', 'great', 'film.The', 'director', 'BTW', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'third', 'film', 'following', 'Blue', 'Valentine', '2010', 'also', 'featured', 'Gosling', 'clearly', 'sufficient', 'experience', 'take', 'ambitious', 'agenda', 'out', 'co-writer', 'film.Another', 'major', 'problem', 'aging', 'characters', 'who', 'go', '15+', 'years', 'film', 'barely', 'age', 'only', 'exception', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'moving', 'late', 'teens', 'middle', 'age.The', 'film', 'not', 'merit', 'photography', 'Sean', 'Bobbitt', 'excellent', 'hand', 'held', 'work', 'following', 'Gosling', 'motorcycle', 'breath-taking.And', 'are', 'contributions', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'DA', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Cooper', 'father', 'who', 'really', 'add', 'quality', 'film', 'Two', 'newcomers', 'Emory', 'Cohen', 'Coopers', 'son', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Gosling', 'son', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'can', 'imagine', 'better', 'script', 'more', 'focused', 'film', 'work', 'would', 'shine.Bottom', 'line', 'ambitious', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'film']",N/A

""They"" might as well be talking about ""The Place Beyond The Pines.""This quiet little story revolves around two men joined forever by a single act of violence, and how it affects the people they love. It sometimes feels like it needs severe trimming, but Bradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling both give very powerful, understated performances -- and Derek Cianfrance is able to provoke the audience's thoughts without preaching to them.Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) is a wandering motorcycle stunt driver, with no ties to anyone. Then he discovers that his ex-lover Romina (Eva Mendes) has given birth to his son Jason, but Romina has since gotten involved with a new man named Kofi (Mahershala Ali) and doesn't want him around. Desperate to be in his son's life, Glanton teams up with a mechanic (Ben Mendelsohn) to rob local banks, so he can provide for Jason.But after a fight with Kofi, an increasingly desperate Glanton finds himself robbing a bank alone -- and a tiny delay causes the police to pursue him. Rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) manages to corner Glanton and ends up accidentally killing him.Though he's hailed as a hero, Cross is racked with guilt because he fired the first shot -- and is even more guilt-ridden when he finds out Glanton had a baby son the same age as his own son AJ. His feelings of guilt and his quest for justice will cause ripples in his life through the years, especially when he runs for Attorney General -- and Jason discovers the tragic truth about his father.At its core, ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a story about having good intentions, but doing things that are bad (or at least questionable) to fulfill them -- one man turns to theft to be close to his son, the other shoots a man to uphold the law. It's a tragic story with no easy answers, especially since it shows us the story's middle-climax from two different viewpoints.Derek Cianfrance (the guy who brought us the equally tragic ""Blue Valentine"") films the movie in a gritty, realistic style -- no glamour, no overblown soundtrack, no sweeping visuals, no fakey movie dialogue. It gives a strangely intimate flavor to the story, particularly as the camera tends to focus on Cooper and Gosling's faces. It relies completely on the actors to make you feel and empathize, which is a rare thing in movies.And those actors are more than up to the challenge. Gosling's bleached hair is a bit silly-looking, but he gives a heartrending performance as a man who is changed forever by fatherhood, and who desperately wants to be a better dad than his father was. And Cooper proves he's much more than the ""Hangover"" guy, giving a subtle, tragic performance as a haunted man who discovers that every death is a terrible loss.The one problemo: it needs tighter editing. Some of the scenes ramble on a lot longer than they need to, such as the scene where Cross is being questioned about the shooting.""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a beautiful -- if sometimes overlong -- piece of work, resting on the shoulders of two excellent actors.

Writer/director Derek Cianfrance seems to be involved writing a new dialect.Here's the scoop. This three act outing begins with Ryan Gosling as a motorcycle stunt driver in a traveling carnival. When the show hits Schenectady he finds he has fathered a son. He goes to great and illegal lengths to do what he thinks is right by the child and mother. That puts him in harm's way with policeman cum lawyer Bradley Cooper. The story shifts to Brad and his trying to fight a corrupt police force. The story then shifts to the sons of the two men as their paths cross in high school.I liked Chianfrance's debut piece ""Blue Valentine"" a lot. It was an interesting way to tell a story and contained characters that straddled the fence between likable and unlikable. He does something similar here. Gosling is not a great role model but feels compelled to right a bad situation for which he feels responsible. Likewise, Brad Cooper wants to do good and works with some pretty scummy cops. Yes he heads down the path of the righteous but does great harm to his son and wife in the process. And when the two boys meet, not knowing how their lives are connected, we get to see what they are like in the wake of their fathers.This is filled with great performances (Ray Liotta will make your skin crawl) and is also written and directed well. This has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. But it has a natural feel to it. You feel you are in the frame with these people. About the only 'con' I can find is that, when it was all over, I wasn't certain what Chianfrance was trying to say. Be good to your kids? I don't know.

Gosling is clearly a well-rounded actor, but this could be a suicidal career move, especially since he was just finding his audience, with films like Drive, The Ides of March, and Gangster Squad.  However, these films are far from box office breakout performances for Gosling.  He's right on the cusp of being the next ""big thing"" in Hollywood - but suddenly he needs a break.  Oh well.  What's the saying?  To each his own?  In any event, The Place Beyond the Pines could very well be the last we see of Ryan Gosling for a while.Directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine), The Place Beyond the Pines stars Ryan Gosling as Luke Glanton, a motorcycle stuntman that happens to visit his ex-lover, Romania (Eva Mendes), only to discover he's the father of her child.  Determined to provide for the child, Luke begins robbing banks, but is eventually stopped by a rookie police officer, Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper).  Flashing forward several years, Cross is running for Attorney General, while both Cross' and Glaton's sons wind up becoming friends in high school, unaware of the past between their fathers.  Dane DeHaan, Emory Cohen, Rose Byrne, Bruce Greenwood, and Ray Liotta also star in supporting roles.The Place Beyond the Pines is quite simply one of the most well-written dramatic plots in quite some time.  Pines is an ambitious film, to be sure - and what makes it so dramatically fulfilling and entertaining is the fact that it doesn't try to do more than it should with what it has.  It's a simple story about two men, Glanton and Cross, and how their lives are destined to be intertwined with one another based on the choices that these two men make for themselves.  Like most films should be, Pines clearly differentiates itself over the course of a three-part act.  Gosling, Cooper, and the tandem of DeHaan and Cohen, each tell their own stories in order to bring the film full circle.  One by one, you'll get to know these characters and understand their reasoning behind the choices they make, due in large part to the superior dialogue and prompt direction.  There absolutely isn't enough praise for the direction from Derek Cianfrance, who also co-wrote the script, along with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder.As far as the acting goes, it's not as if there's really one specific actor that steals the show.  Even though Gosling and Cooper both portray their characters to the best of their abilities, you can't help but question some of the choices these characters make.  For instance, Gosling's character instantly gives up his job to help support his child?  How is he supposed to support his child if he gives up his job?  Bradley Cooper's character shoots a perp, yet lies about who shot first (Cooper's character did) - as if a perp pointing a gun at a police officer without firing is not enough justification to shoot first.  We might as well call this the Han Solo/Greedo conundrum redux.  Still, with these issues aside - Pines is really gets its breakout performance from new comer, Dane DeHaan.  His buzz-worthy performance as a loner searching for answers about his father is just the beginning of a soon-to-be busy movie career for young Mr. DeHaan.Overall, the small town setting in The Place Beyond the Pines is beautifully sculpted and perfectly captured to fit the demands of its story and characters.  This is a character driven film with a series of twists, all of which lead up to the climactic grand finale.  Rest assured, Pines is absolutely worth a visit to your local cinema, so if for some reason you're on the fence about seeing this film, you should definitely make it a priority before the summer juggernauts come to town.Overall Film Grade:  B+FNDNreview.com",4,"Gosling, Cooper shine in The Place Beyond the Pines",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,4216,"['Just', 'when', 'were', 'really', 'getting', 'know', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'left', 'building', 'right', 'folks', 'Mr.', 'Gosling', 'decided', 'take', 'break', 'acting', 'Much', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'recently', 'caught', 'film-goers', 'been', 'subject', 'heartthrob', 'mania', 'mainly', 'graced', 'big', 'screen', 'lead', '2004', 'Notebook', 'right', 'move', 'Gosling', 'Has', 'already', 'been', 'overexposed', 'general', 'public', 'anything', 'even', 'broken', 'barrier', 'stardom', 'Gosling', 'clearly', 'well-rounded', 'actor', 'could', 'be', 'suicidal', 'career', 'move', 'especially', 'was', 'just', 'finding', 'audience', 'films', 'Drive', 'Ides', 'March', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'However', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'box', 'office', 'breakout', 'performances', 'Gosling', 'right', 'cusp', 'being', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'suddenly', 'break', 'Oh', 'well', 'What', 'saying', 'own', 'event', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'last', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'while.Directed', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'stars', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Luke', 'Glanton', 'motorcycle', 'stuntman', 'visit', 'ex-lover', 'Romania', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'only', 'discover', 'father', 'child', 'Determined', 'provide', 'child', 'Luke', 'robbing', 'banks', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'rookie', 'police', 'officer', 'Avery', 'Cross', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Flashing', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'Cross', 'running', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Cross', 'Glaton', 'sons', 'wind', 'up', 'becoming', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'unaware', 'past', 'fathers', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Emory', 'Cohen', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'well-written', 'dramatic', 'plots', 'quite', 'time', 'Pines', 'ambitious', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'so', 'dramatically', 'fulfilling', 'entertaining', 'fact', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'more', 'should', 'what', 'simple', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Glanton', 'Cross', 'how', 'lives', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'intertwined', 'one', 'based', 'choices', 'two', 'men', 'make', 'most', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'Pines', 'clearly', 'course', 'three-part', 'act', 'Gosling', 'Cooper', 'tandem', 'DeHaan', 'Cohen', 'tell', 'own', 'stories', 'order', 'bring', 'film', 'full', 'circle', 'One', 'one', ""'ll"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'choices', 'make', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'superior', 'dialogue', 'prompt', 'direction', 'absolutely', ""n't"", 'enough', 'praise', 'direction', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Ben', 'Coccio', 'Darius', 'Marder.As', 'far', 'acting', 'not', 'really', 'one', 'specific', 'actor', 'show', 'Even', 'Gosling', 'Cooper', 'portray', 'characters', 'best', 'abilities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'question', 'choices', 'characters', 'make', 'instance', 'Gosling', 'character', 'instantly', 'up', 'job', 'help', 'support', 'child', 'How', 'supposed', 'support', 'child', 'up', 'job', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'character', 'shoots', 'perp', 'yet', 'who', 'shot', 'first', 'Cooper', 'character', 'did', 'perp', 'pointing', 'gun', 'police', 'officer', 'firing', 'not', 'enough', 'justification', 'shoot', 'first', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'call', 'Han', 'Solo/Greedo', 'conundrum', 'redux', 'Still', 'issues', 'aside', 'Pines', 'really', 'breakout', 'performance', 'new', 'comer', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'buzz-worthy', 'performance', 'loner', 'searching', 'answers', 'father', 'just', 'beginning', 'soon-to-be', 'busy', 'movie', 'career', 'young', 'Mr.', 'DeHaan.Overall', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'beautifully', 'sculpted', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'fit', 'demands', 'story', 'characters', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'series', 'twists', 'lead', 'climactic', 'grand', 'finale', 'Rest', 'assured', 'Pines', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'visit', 'local', 'cinema', 'so', 'reason', ""'re"", 'fence', 'seeing', 'film', 'should', 'definitely', 'make', 'priority', 'summer', 'come', 'town.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'B+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

They created a screenplay with Darius Marder that embraces so many current questions of deciding what is right and wrong and turned the script over to the talented Derek Cianfrance to direct. It is actually three stories in different time frames so that we can study the effects of fathers on sons and how the seeds of the past bloom into bizarre hothouse blooms, rank with malodorous overtones but holding stamens of considered convictions.The film opens in a tacky carnival in Schenectady, NY (the Native American word for `the place beyond the pines') where we meet a mysterious, tattooed and mythical motorcycle racer, Luke, (Ryan Gosling) drives out of a traveling carnival globe of death and whizzes through the backstreets of Schenectady desperately trying to connect with a former lover, Romina, (Eva Mendes) who recently and secretly gave birth to the stunt rider's son Kevin aka Jason but is now living with Kofi (Mahershala Ali). In an attempt to provide for his `new family', Luke quits the carnival life and with the inspiration from a casual mechanic friend Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) commits a series of bank robberies aided by his superior riding ability. The stakes rise as Luke is put on a collision course with an ambitious police officer, Avery Cross, (Bradley Cooper) looking to quickly move up the ranks in a police department riddled with corruption as headed by Deluca (Ray Liotta). Cross is married (Rose Byrne) and has a son, neither of whom stands a chance for affection in Avery's big plan for his future. The sweeping drama unfolds over fifteen years as the sins of the past haunt the present days lives of two high school boys - Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) - wrestling with the legacy they've inherited. The only refuge is found in the place beyond the pines.The cast is uniformly excellent, able to make unlikable characters into three-dimensional people about whom we learn to care and understand.

I keep sifting through films recently but I never know which one to look out for and trailers are very misleading I have found but here's why I was waiting patiently for this film. Lets run a small preview of the people involved in the film.PRE-VIEW (How I felt before watching the film)About the actors and director,Ryan Gosling (last three films) - Ides of March (2011) , Crazy Stupid Love (2011) , Gangster Squad (2013)Brad Cooper - Silver Linings Playbook, The Words, Hangover 2Eva Mendes - *nevermind* but nice mole on lip.Director - Derek Cianfrance -- Blue Valentine (2010 / Romantic Tragedy)With such big names and such a bemusing title, I was expecting a film of hard knocks, yet I didn't dare read the storyline because I like to be surprised when the best actors and the best directors get together.So let me just say that BLUE VALENTINE has been one of the most memorable films of the decade that just left us for me. The transition between characters, the opinions of two lovers in a relationship, the analogy of how it was and how it is, everything about the film was outstanding. I didn't know what hit me when I saw that film and it made me a Ryan Gosling fan.Review :""The Place Beyond The Pines"" is an experience you aren't going to forget easily. Some films dictate the terms and this is one of those rare films that sets itself apart most beautifully. The introduction of characters was subtle. Personalities were juxtaposed to the plot in a very unusual way. There is so much the director conveys without trying to be over the top. The sets were unforgettable, when the SOUNDTRACK played, I didn't know what hit me. The sets seemed to match perfectly with every wonderfully chosen of American music. The first scene will have you wondering what the heck is happening. It is long, powerful and Drive'esque. (PS -  I didn't like Drive that much)Eva Mendes is reborn as an actress with the film. I won't say anything about Cooper or Gosling but the music is so well done, the bass turned to the most delicious level which is very becoming of the film - maker.

1629098,A1THRE1N60I1L5,B00BEIYKM6,"infj_I_am ""alicekinnian5""","[1, 1]","I debated whether to give this film 5 or 4 stars simply because I did not come away uplifted, or even with a feeling of closure from &#34;justice having been served, etc.&#34; However, I've come to conclude that I can't fault the film - as it merely retained its integrity and remained, overall &#34;realistic&#34; in it's gut-wrenching human tragedy.The most appealing part of the film is its representation of men as providers in more than just a superficial sense; it well relays the height of a man's actualization as &#34;being there for his family&#34; (in the case of Ryan, who turns to desperate measures in an attempt to fulfill this underlying good drive) - and, on the flip side, the cost of deviating from a life of integrity (the other pillar of manhood) - in the tormented, falsely successful life of the cop who becomes a hero by bringing Ryan to justice.We see a strange complexity develop, in which it is inescapable that Ryan, though &#34;completely unskilled&#34;, and &#34;with a history of violence&#34; (and an uncontrolled temper as well) - is actually the superior and more admirable man compared to the cop, who has every sanction of society placed upon him after committing murder - and, in one touching scene - robbing the very last inheritance from a mere baby. (On a tangent, I think that scene more than anything else in the movie is what will stay with me; I hate to see children taken advantage of, and the scene was very well done in even in its overt symbolism).The film truly progresses as a tragedy, where we see, by a domino effect, that all of the hope and love that Ryan had for his son is literally robbed from him by the lawyer-cop. Though unbearably depressing and deterministic, it illustrates the importance of a father, and how formative it is to have even the least-accomplished father, as long as that person is loving and well intention ed.Throughout the film, I kept thinking &#34;well, and what could have happened differently so as to prevent Ryan's son from coming to the inescapable demise of 'following in his father's footprints' - ironically exactly what the father did not want him to do&#34;. Honestly, looking at the characters in the film - the one I found most reprehensible was neither the cop, nor the cop's son, nor the surrogate father - but the character of the Mom. I am not sure if she was supposed to come off as an insufferable, irrational, opportunistic - well, let's leave it at that - but, really her character almost defied human sensibility. I mean, to see the father of her only child at the time beg for the opportunity to be given a shot to provide for his son, to be part of his life - a man who was not portrayed as being addicted to anything more serious than cigarettes, and who even took up being a mechanic in an attempt to begin the process of being there for his family - well - that's just the most despicable thing in the whole film. I found it actually extremely offensive as a woman. There are so many single Moms out there whose exhusbands take no interest in them, much less their children - that the thought of a single Mom who would prefer to live with some other guy who is not even the kid's father - and would heartlessly mock him after he quit his job so as to be closer to his son - it just got me really angry.But I guess that's what's so great about the film. It takes you to all the miserable places you never want to go. It takes you into the tortured life of the cop - who - is not 100% slime - and does have remediating guilt - but, who is mostly a deplorable and tortured individual - and who can never make it past the crime he committed to be a father on any level for his own son. It takes you into the resultant weed-like growth of the cop's son - stemming from all the unmet needs for attention. It takes you through the poverty and result of lack of education / skills / jobs in the poorer subdivision. It basically takes you through all forms of hell, but, expertly so.I guess you just have to make the decision whether you want to endure that on a Saturday night or not.

1629103,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00BEIYKM6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Derek Cianfrance, the director that made such a splash with the very powerful open-nerve-painful disintegrating-marriage story that was BLUE VALENTINE, is someone who obviously has a vision. With THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES, I suppose some of my dislike of this film has to do with expectations, but most of it has to do with the storytelling and some of the performances.Almost everyone in this film is typecast as something we've seen them do before, which was upsetting to a degree, but would have been more upsetting if the talented people behind these characters weren't as good as they are. Ryan Gosling plays a BMX-bike riding minor phenom who turns to a life of crime (using his cyclist skills, no less) when he discovers that a fling he had a year prior with Eva Mendes had yielded a son. Fate in the form of cop Bradley Cooper turns up, who also has a year-old son with caring wife Rose Byrne, and as he ascends to hero status in the Schenectady Police Department, he becomes a political animal as he discovers that his job is rife with corruption. In the blink of an eye, the film skips ahead 15 years and now follows the lives of the two sons; Cooper's black-sheep son Emory Cohen and Gosling's loner son Dane DeHaan, who naturally are on a collision course that was determined for them both 15 years prior.Gosling, who is such a great young actor, really pulls his role off well despite the fact that we've seen shadows of this in his career already with his role in the brilliant DRIVE. Dane DeHaan is another young performer that is absolutely electric to watch, but it seems like most of his roles consist of people seeing him in the astonishingly well-done CHRONICLE. Mendes, Byrne, Ray Liotta and Bruce Greenwood, all great performers in their own right, are wholly under-utilized in this film. The first act of this film is amazing, until Cooper's character starts driving the narrative, and like most films with Cooper in them, in my opinion, is when it starts spiraling out of control. Newcomer Cohen performes with swagger, giving a portrayal of one of the most authentic douchebags in recent cinema.And Cianfrance, who clearly has talent behind the camera and composing some beautiful shots, knows the story he wants to tell and desperately wants to give it an epic quality, but it falls too short too fast, and leaves us to wallow in a miserable stew of predictability. He had some real opportunities to turn some of the trappings of this kind of crime drama on its head, but doesn't.THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a film filled to the brim with potential that ends up being squandered throughout most of the film.",2,"Raw performances, but too disjointed, and sadly, talent-wasting.",1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,2636,"['Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'director', 'made', 'splash', 'very', 'powerful', 'open-nerve-painful', 'disintegrating-marriage', 'story', 'was', 'BLUE', 'VALENTINE', 'someone', 'who', 'obviously', 'vision', 'PLACE', 'BEYOND', 'THE', 'PINES', 'suppose', 'dislike', 'film', 'do', 'expectations', 'most', 'do', 'storytelling', 'performances.Almost', 'everyone', 'film', 'typecast', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'was', 'upsetting', 'degree', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'upsetting', 'talented', 'people', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'are', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'BMX-bike', 'riding', 'minor', 'phenom', 'who', 'life', 'crime', 'using', 'cyclist', 'skills', 'less', 'when', 'fling', 'had', 'year', 'prior', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'had', 'yielded', 'son', 'Fate', 'form', 'cop', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'up', 'who', 'also', 'year-old', 'son', 'caring', 'wife', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'hero', 'status', 'Schenectady', 'Police', 'Department', 'political', 'animal', 'job', 'rife', 'corruption', 'blink', 'eye', 'film', 'skips', 'ahead', '15', 'years', 'now', 'lives', 'two', 'sons', 'Cooper', 'black-sheep', 'son', 'Emory', 'Cohen', 'Gosling', 'loner', 'son', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'who', 'naturally', 'are', 'collision', 'course', 'was', 'determined', '15', 'years', 'prior.Gosling', 'who', 'such', 'great', 'young', 'actor', 'really', 'role', 'off', 'well', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'shadows', 'career', 'already', 'role', 'brilliant', 'DRIVE', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'young', 'performer', 'absolutely', 'electric', 'watch', 'most', 'roles', 'consist', 'people', 'seeing', 'astonishingly', 'well-done', 'CHRONICLE', 'Mendes', 'Byrne', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'great', 'performers', 'own', 'right', 'are', 'wholly', 'under-utilized', 'film', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'amazing', 'Cooper', 'character', 'driving', 'narrative', 'most', 'films', 'Cooper', 'opinion', 'when', 'spiraling', 'control', 'Newcomer', 'Cohen', 'swagger', 'giving', 'portrayal', 'one', 'most', 'authentic', 'douchebags', 'recent', 'cinema.And', 'Cianfrance', 'who', 'clearly', 'talent', 'camera', 'composing', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'story', 'tell', 'desperately', 'give', 'epic', 'quality', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'fast', 'wallow', 'miserable', 'stew', 'predictability', 'had', 'real', 'opportunities', 'turn', 'trappings', 'kind', 'crime', 'drama', 'head', ""doesn't.THE"", 'PLACE', 'BEYOND', 'THE', 'PINES', 'film', 'filled', 'brim', 'potential', 'up', 'being', 'squandered', 'most', 'film']",N/A

RyGos can act and I truly loved the first meeting with Eva and later in the church. Great stuff---really, really great! And kudos here to the director because neither scene was overdone. Each was poignant and perfect. The church scene really shows the white trash vs. decent life choice he had. Also, his acting in the diner when he says not to talk down to him---poignant and perfect---both the acting and the direction and the writing.  So, I was intrigued. I thought this guy is motivated to get his life together.I was even sympathetic to the robberies, if he had used that as a launch pad to something, some way of life.And then the movie veered way west of where I thought it was going and moved down deep into white trashville, with no return.There was NO ONE and I mean NO ONE to cheer for, and what do you have then? Eva is a slut living with one man IN HIS HOME with her mother, no less, and her child, and sleeping with this other guy. Again, if they had truly been in love, I could have gone there. But then we have RyGos flip into the mental ward---figuratively.  I turned it off. I didn't even get to the BradCoo part---amazing to me that any storyteller/director/writer would bring a central character in that late---should have been Act 1, IMHO.Me thinks RyGos needs to find himself a great writer and hang on for dear life, because he cannot pick them.

1629114,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00BEIYKM6,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[19, 28]","The Place Beyond the Pines is an ambitious epic about choices and the consequences of those choices, and about the relationship between fathers and sons along with how the father's decisions impact their sons.The film's first act opens with Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) a famous motorcycle rider for a traveling state carnival. The man leads an empty life without any meaning besides his job and bike. That changes when Romina (Eva Mendes) an old fling returns comes to see him after a year. It turns out that Luke has a son, Jason who he had no knowledge of and has no part in his son's life. He's forced to watch as another man raise and be a part of his baptism. Luke wants to be a part of his son's life saying a son needs his father after all Luke didn't have a father and look how badly he turned out, but as it is pointed out to him by a few people he has a limited skill set so if he can barely take care of himself how can he take care of Romina and their son.Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) stars in the second act. Avery a rookie police officer who's been on the job barely a year when he becomes a hero after he successfully takes down Luke Glanton on his own. Avery is a very ambitious man wanting to rise to the highest level of office, and he pays the price for it when he gets involved with officer Deluca (Ray Liotta) and his fellow corrupt cops. Avery already has a guilty conscience about taking Jason's father away from him, so much so that Avery can barely look at his own son, AJ when he is forced to make a moral decision does he continue to help Deluca or does he try and bring them down all the while trying to advance his own career. Avery's and Luke's lives and decisions truly come together in the third act of the film which takes place fifteen years in the future. There Avery is running for Attorney General, AJ (Emory Cohen) is living with his divorced wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne). The troubled AJ moves in with his dad and into a new high school. There he meets a teenager at the same age in Jason (Dane DeHaan), and the impact of the choices their parents made come to light and they are left to deal with the consequences. The film ends just like it began with a young man getting on a bike and riding off into the unknown.Derek Cianfrance's screenplay is elaborate and far reaching in the scope of the characters, but it doesn't always work effectively. In my opinion Avery's story is the most flawed of the three intertwined stories. Avery just isn't that well written of a character or he isn't fleshed out enough, and Bradley Cooper who's proven he's capable of being a great actor from his Oscar nominated performance in Silver Linings Playbook instead seems to be playing the character without any depth. Even his emotional scenes just don't hold up that well. Along with that the supporting actor's roles weren't that good. Whether it be the capable Ray Liotta and Rose Byrne or Bruce Greenwood it just seems like Cianfrance was trying to do too much with the story he had. What holds up the lackluster middle part of the film are the beginning and end of the film. Ryan Gosling has come into his own in his last few films, and outside of Gangster Squad he has given outstanding performances. Ryan delivers beautifully acted performance as he perfectly plays Luke the sadden knew father who finds hope in his son, and all he wants to do is provide for the woman he loves and his son even if it is illegal. Eva Mendes delivers her best acting performance of her career as Romina who feels guilt for not telling Luke about his son as well as conflicted emotions about his father. In a supporting role Ben Mendelsohn does a wonderful job as Robin, Luke's only friend. I think Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen steal the film with their performances as Jason and AJ respectfully. They did a masterful job displaying emotions of these emotionally damaged teenagers. You will fully believe in these characters and the scars they display in their eyes. The script isn't outstanding, but I loved it. It does a wonderful job showing the impact fathers have on their son's and how our decisions in life always have consequences whether we see them right away or not.Derek Cianfrance's script might not be the best, but he makes up for it as a director. Admittedly I haven't seen any of his other films, but this relative new comer does a marvelous job bring to life his vision for The Place Beyond the Pines. Cianfrance nearly perfectly directs his outstanding cast as they almost all give superb performances helping to add depth and character to his film. Beyond the Pines is simply a gorgeous film as it was filmed entirely in New York State and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt captures the essence of the state perfectly from the cities to the great pine forests. I wouldn't call Mike Patton a great or good composer from the list of projects he's worked on, but Patton does an excellent job with the score. The tone, feel and emotion of the music fit perfectly with scenes in the film. The only flaws I found in the production of the film were perhaps in the camera work being jittery and hard to follow on occasion and some of the editing decisions. Beyond the Pines is a pretty long film, and I'm sure there had to be some editing decisions made about what needed to be cut, and in certain scenes I think it shows. In my opinion those are only very small flaws that didn't take much away from the film.Going into A Place Beyond the Pines I had high expectations. I loved the trailer, the cast and the music I heard and though the film is flawed in the middle Beyond the Pines brightens up what has been a very disappointing early 2013 in film being easily the best film of the year so far with a great cast, a really good screenplay, great directing, really good acting mixed in with a great score and beautiful cinematography. If there is one film in the early part of 2013 that I think is a must see it is Beyond the Pines, and I think it will go down as one of the better films of the year.",5,"""If you ride like lightning,

I had been hearing very good things about this movie for a long time and today I finally got to watch it. My oh my what a movie. I have yet to see Man of Steel, American Hustle, or any other movie besides 42 that has really impressed me. But this is already one of the best films of 2013. Ryan Gosling took a big leap from his lackluster performance in Gangster Squad and gave a strong standout performance as Luke Glanton. Supporting cast includes Eva Mendes as Romina, Bradley Cooper(he is getting better with each role as an actor) as Avery Cross, Ray Liotta as Delucca who also did a great job (there has to be a guy everyone loves to hate) and Dane Dehaan (who is also a great actor for his age) as Jason Glanton. The whole cast did a beyond superb job. The Place Beyond the Pines makes you forget that the people in it are just characters; you generally come to care about and understand each and every one of the characters in the movie. I had the same feeling I had watching Cloud Atlas; the connections are there, the story is pretty self explanatory but you have to pay close attention to every detail. The Place Beyond the Pines itself has every emotion a movie like this should have: happiness, tragedy, understanding, etc. You can expect the unexpected with The Place Beyond the Pines.

Proceed with caution.I've seen more than my fare share of films this year, but none have gripped me the way The Place Beyond the Pines did. Beyond just telling a great story, the way that story is executed is both creative and inventive. Instead of following one character throughout the entire film, The Place Beyond the Pines tells three separate stories. It does this to show how everything we do has consequences. You may only have a brief interaction with a stranger, but whether you realize it or not their life is forever altered because of it. Now the repercussions in this film are more drastic than those from an everyday interaction, but the point remains the same.The Place Beyond the Pines is separated into three acts based on the three stories present. Act one follows Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling), a stuntman turned robber who wants to provide for the son he never knew he had; act two follows Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a police officer who's life is changed forever after stopping Luke during a robbery; and the final act starts fifteen years later and follows the sons of these two individuals, Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen). The actions taken by both Luke and Avery echo into the next generation as we see their children cope with the repercussions of their confrontation.As I arrived at the conclusion of act one, I felt this overwhelming sense of being misled. The trailer for the film suggests one thing, but the film itself is something very, very different. However, it didn't take long before those feelings began to disappear. As the story progressed, I became more invested with each passing moment. I didn't just want to see what happened, I needed to. There was something beyond just the general desire to reach the story's conclusion. Moving from one story to the next created an attachment to each character in a way I've never experienced. Seeing these two very different lives collide and create a ripple effect was both entertaining and insanely satisfying.The way the story is structured is unlike anything I've ever seen before and, for the most part, it works extremely well. Unfortunately, this unusual structure also results in the film feeling a bit uneven during certain areas of the narrative. In fact, the further you progress in the story, the more uneven it becomes. Almost as if each transition depletes some of the film's energy. Upon reaching the film's final moments I realized that Luke was the initial domino that started this chain reaction. Because of this, no matter how far you get in the story, his presence is always felt. This makes the remaining characters feel less important in comparison.With that said, though, Avery's life was the only one that seemed underdeveloped. As we transitioned from act two to act three, we missed out on fifteen years of his life and none of it was ever truly explained. The writers bring you up to speed in terms of what exactly is going on, but they never flesh out what happened during this missed time period. Because of this, I was left confused and slightly irritated because I had to make assumptions instead of being told what exactly happened. It made his part of the narrative very underwhelming even though he was a key element in regard to how the story played out.As far as ensemble casts go, it's very rare that you receive one this good. Not only were these actors outstanding from start to finish, but everyone involved felt made for their role. Gosling and Cooper each gave one of the best performances of their respective careers and Dane DeHaan was horrifyingly intense. His gestures and tone of voice went hand-in-hand with those of Gosling, almost to the point where you would assume they were related. Still, it doesn't stop there. Even the minor performers like Eva Mendes and Ben Mendelsohn were equally phenomenal, which helped bring a certain level of importance to every character.Finally, the music present in The Place Beyond the Pines is both gripping and beautiful. Composed by Mike Patton, the score does wonders to bring each and every scene to life. It provides a sense of atmosphere in ways I never knew were possible. It reached a point where I no longer felt like a viewer watching the film, but an innocent bystander in Schenectady witnessing this story take place. It does more than just provide a simple backdrop for the story, it provides that extra kick that truly makes the story come to life.Overall Score: 8.9/ 10 - The Place Beyond the Pines is easily one of the most unique films I've seen in years. Its story is raw and it aims to be something more than just your average drama. While certain aspects of the narrative may be a bit uneven, the story itself doesn't suffer too much because of it. With the help of an amazing cast and an equally wonderful score, this is definitely a tale that will stick with you for years to come. I highly recommend you give it your time if given the opportunity.",4,8.9/10 - Gripping,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,4977,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.I', ""'ve"",

Oedipus tried to escape his fate by taking certain actions, which, ironically, led him directly into the path of his ordained fate. My initial viewing led me to think fate was the controlling factor here, too. But not so. The characters try to change their fates, their futures and some are successful.Why the title? ""The Place Beyond the Pines""-- what's there that gives the film its title? A friend, a grounding, a source of history, some explanations, each an essential element of the story of Luke (Ryan Gosling, a superb actor), a daredevil carnival motorcycle rider, and his son Jason. The story covers about seventeen years in a hop-skip fashion and comes in three distinct acts: Luke the bank robber, Avery the police officer who changes Luke's future, and their two sons who intersect as teenagers.(One note at this point: Gosling always plays the dangerous bad boys, Cooper the wide-eyed heroic types. Wouldn't it be interesting to see a role reversal here? Can Gosling lose his edginess to play the solid, stand-up guy? Can Cooper disguise those innocent eyes to be edgy?)The film comes in three acts: Gosling as an irresponsible man, father, bank robber; Cooper as hero by quirk--or intention--of fate, momentary dirty cop, politician; and the intersection of their two sons 15 years later to move the fates forward.The most interesting point of the film is seeing how Avery Cross's son turns out--and it's not pretty. What the viewer learns in Act Two is that Cross (Cooper) cannot look at his son after Act One (I am deliberately avoiding revealing important information). So he grows up neglected--and wow, what an obnoxious, malicious young man he is. On the other hand, Luke's son is just a typical boy, product of a family that stayed together, although he knows nothing about his birth father.Just as Luke found himself a new mode in ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Jason (his son) learns about his father from the same source. It's a place like the fig tree: safe but full of danger. Luke partook of danger, Jason took a little knowledge.""A Place Beyond the Pines"" is definitely worth seeing, worth the money, but I want to ask more of the actors, the director. Do Cross and his son really change in Act Three. Do people in general really change? And Jason: Why doesn't he keep the photo? Does he divorce himself from his old life and head out into a new future, a new destiny? That photo initiates new potentiality. It's an abrupt but fascinating ending, one of those that make you create your own ending.",4,Does fate order our lives?,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2569,"['Greeks', 'believed', 'fate', 'controlled', 'Oedipus', 'tried', 'escape', 'fate', 'taking', 'certain', 'actions', 'ironically', 'led', 'directly', 'path', 'ordained', 'fate', 'initial', 'viewing', 'led', 'think', 'fate', 'was', 'controlling', 'factor', 'here', 'too', 'not', 'so', 'characters', 'try', 'change', 'fates', 'futures', 'are', 'title', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'what', 'film', 'title', 'friend', 'grounding', 'source', 'history', 'explanations', 'essential', 'element', 'story', 'Luke', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'superb', 'actor', 'daredevil', 'carnival', 'motorcycle', 'rider', 'son', 'Jason', 'story', 'seventeen', 'years', 'hop-skip', 'fashion', 'three', 'distinct', 'acts', 'Luke', 'bank', 'robber', 'Avery', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'Luke', 'future', 'two', 'sons', 'who', 'intersect', 'teenagers', 'One', 'note', 'point', 'Gosling', 'always', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'boys', 'Cooper', 'wide-eyed', 'heroic', 'types', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'role', 'reversal', 'here', 'Can', 'Gosling', 'lose', 'edginess', 'play', 'solid', 'stand-up', 'guy', 'Can', 'Cooper', 'disguise', 'innocent', 'eyes', 'be', 'edgy', 'film', 'three', 'acts', 'Gosling', 'irresponsible', 'man', 'father', 'bank', 'robber', 'Cooper', 'hero', 'quirk', 'intention', 'fate', 'momentary', 'dirty', 'cop', 'politician', 'intersection', 'two', 'sons', '15', 'years', 'later', 'move', 'fates', 'forward.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'point', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'Avery', 'Cross', 'son', 'out', 'not', 'pretty', 'What', 'viewer', 'Act', 'Two', 'Cross', 'Cooper', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'son', 'Act', 'One', 'am', 'deliberately', 'avoiding', 'revealing', 'important', 'information', 'up', 'neglected', 'wow', 'what', 'obnoxious', 'malicious', 'young', 'man', 'other', 'hand', 'Luke', 'son', 'just', 'typical', 'boy', 'product', 'family', 'stayed', 'together', 'nothing', 'birth', 'father.Just', 'Luke', 'found', 'new', 'mode', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'Jason', 'son', 'father', 'same', 'source', 'place', 'fig', 'tree', 'safe', 'full', 'danger', 'Luke', 'partook', 'danger', 'Jason', 'took', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'money', 'want', 'ask', 'more', 'actors', 'director', 'Do', 'Cross', 'son', 'really', 'change', 'Act', 'Three', 'Do', 'people', 'general', 'really', 'change', 'Jason', 'Why', ""n't"", 'keep', 'photo', 'divorce', 'old', 'life', 'head', 'out', 'new', 'future', 'new', 'destiny', 'photo', 'new', 'potentiality', 'abrupt', 'fascinating', 'ending', 'one', 'make', 'create', 'own', 'ending']",N/A

Thrown in for good measure is the corrupt cop in the force played like always Ray Liotta.This story has a lot of potential but I found out as I watched that it seems to get lost in itself and seems to wonder into the forest that it is trying to display.  The story meanders on at times and the character development seems to be a bit flat and unmoving.The story is an intriguing one and has some decent performances from Gosling, Mendez and Liotta but the movie is a bit too long, gets lost and drags on a bit too much, concentrating on some aspects of the film too much and lacking in others and seemingly throwing some other elements in for good measure.  To me, I thought the bike robbing father could have been its own movie without the rest and would have probably stood up better on its on.  I am not so sure why they threw in the corrupt cop thing as it seemingly was a small part of the movie and was just kind of left out there with the passage of time.  And when it came to the teenagers and the movie ending, I didn't really feel any emotion because the development of any sentiment towards them wasn't there for me especially since the initial character was troubled and pretty unlikeable from the very beginning.The movie itself is a decent watch but fell short of what I thought could have been a great overall story that brought you in and made you feel something.

The Place Beyond the Pines is one interpretation based on several perceptions of the interweaving of these often unpredictable and unforgiving threads. We take so much for granted in our self-centered lives; including the impact each of our choices has beyond what we choose to see and accept as the microcosmic scope of our lives. Chance encounters are more than static point-in-time events. In fact, each event places us at the nexus of a series of infinitely forked roads; each option in direction representing a possible circumstance. If we're conscious, paying attention, and thinking, we give ourselves the opportunity to consider scenarios and consequences. But in the full fight of life, we react and embrace regret before we consider the potential of our choices and actions to irrevocably ripple through time. The film's message is not new, but presents a refreshingly optimistic outcome that encourages us to remember that we can change the way the threads interweave. We're not victims of fact, fiction, fate, or chance. We're empowered to weave each thread as loosely or as tightly as we choose, and in doing so present ourselves with positive circumstances that define or redefine our lives, and the lives of those around us.

The consequences of Avery's confrontation with Luke will reverberate into the next generation. It is then that the two sons, Jason and AJ, must face their fateful, shared legacy.The cast led by Ryan Gosling (as Luke), Bradley Cooper (as Avery), Eva Mendes (as Romina) & Ray Liotta (as Deluca) is brilliant. The directing by Derek Cianfrance (who also did the story & screenplay) is brilliant. The story by Cianfrance & Ben Coccio (also did the screenplay) & screenplay by Cianfrance, Coccio & Darius Marder is brilliant.The music by Mike Patton is brilliant. The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is brilliant. The film editing by Jim Helton & Ron Patane is brilliant. The casting by Cindy Tolan is brilliant.

The film is essentially three short stories, one of which focuses on a circus performer turned bank robber (Gosling). His violent encounter with a young cop (Cooper) propels the film's second act into the life of that officer. The final third of of the film reveals how the lives of these two men, already inextricably intertwined, become even further entangled by their teenage sons.The allegory of the film (the sins of the father are passed down to the son) is ponderous almost to distraction. Although told with patient, sumptuous detail, the characters never really seem much more than stereotypes. This may be because everything is done so quietly and subtly. It may also be because the script expects the potency of the situation to be enough to draw the heart. I don't know. All I know is the only person I felt sorry for was Romina (Eva Mendes), the only character to be truly likable and complex (and, of course, the character that gets dumped on more than any other...and that's saying a lot for a film that's as dismal as this one).The rails really come off in the third act, when the film asks the audience to assume quite a bit about the teenage sons of these two flawed fathers. I won't go into too much detail to avoid spoilers, but I will say that Gosling's son appears to make decisions for no real reason. It seems like the movie is trying to say that there is something inescapable, something in the genes that propels him, but his behavior shifts radically and often. You can't even really blame it on puberty, since the shifts are way beyond even the wildest of teenage mood swings. It felt very much to me like the film just needed that thread of melodrama to keep on playing out, and it had no way to do it beyond highly exaggerated teenage angst.I was planning on giving the film a solid three stars -- I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it -- until the final scene. Again, I'm avoiding spoilers here, but it was so gushingly symbolic, and so obviously attempting a kind of desperate palindromic poetry that it just felt like the movie was begging me to cry. Even worse, it didn't make a whole lot of sense in the grand scheme of things, and really all I could think of wasn't how deep and meaningful and powerful it was, but was how it was basically another stab in the side of the only character that provided me with any empathy: Mendes's Romina. The fact that the film relegates this powerful, complicated, long-suffering (much longer suffering than any of the male characters) female character to a footnote in the film in deference to this tired symbolism about fathers and sons was what finally annoyed me enough to drop my rating.",2,Fathers & Sons ...

1629157,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00BEIYKM6,Miles D. Moore,"[1, 2]","Derek Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a hard film to review. I can't help but feel that too many reviewers, both on Amazon and elsewhere, have told too much of the story. This is what I knew going to see the movie: that it starred Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper as antagonistic characters on opposite sides of the law, and that the story took place over a number of years (15, to be exact). I'm glad I didn't know anything more than that, because the surprises Cianfrance had in store for me took my breath away.You already know the story in detail if you've read any other reviews, but here is what I feel safe in telling you:1. Gosling, as a daredevil motorcyclist turned bank robber, dominates the first half of ""The Place Beyond the Pines.""2. Cooper, as a cop turned district attorney, is the main character of the second half, though there are also important plot twists involving Emory Cohen, as Cooper's son, and Dane DeHaan, as Gosling's.3. All four aforementioned actors are wonderful, as are Eva Mendes, as the love of Gosling's life; Ben Mendelsohn, as Gosling's partner in crime; Ray Liotta, as Cooper's corrupt superior in the police department; Rose Byrne, as Cooper's wife; and Harris Yulin, as Cooper's politically savvy father.4. Despite the sprawling structure of ""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" Cianfrance's direction keeps us on the edge of our seats for most of its 140-minute running time. He is helped immeasurably by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt and editors Jim Helton and Ron Patane. The opening sequence, showing a heavily tattooed Gosling swaggering his way through a carnival crowd, is a wow, as is a chase scene in the middle of the movie between Gosling and Cooper.5. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" reminds me of some of the great old TV miniseries, such as ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" and ""Captains and the Kings."" The thrust of its story, however, is as old as the Bible, with the fathers eating sour grapes and the sons' teeth being set on edge. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is messy in its structure, and not every loose end gets tied. But it is powerful and moving, and I think its reputation will grow with the years.",5,"A big, sprawling, moving film.",1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2156,"['Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'hard', 'film', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'too', 'many', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'told', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'what', 'knew', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'starred', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'antagonistic', 'characters', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'number', 'years', '15', 'be', 'exact', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'more', 'surprises', 'Cianfrance', 'had', 'store', 'took', 'breath', 'away.You', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'detail', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'what', 'feel', 'safe', 'telling', 'you:1', 'Gosling', 'daredevil', 'motorcyclist', 'turned', 'bank', 'robber', 'first', 'half', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines.', '2', 'Cooper', 'cop', 'turned', 'district', 'attorney', 'main', 'character', 'second', 'half', 'are', 'also', 'important', 'plot', 'twists', 'involving', 'Emory', 'Cohen', 'Cooper', 'son', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', ""Gosling's.3"", 'four', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'are', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'love', 'Gosling', 'life', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'Gosling', 'partner', 'crime', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Cooper', 'corrupt', 'superior', 'police', 'department', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Cooper', 'wife', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Cooper', 'politically', 'savvy', 'father.4', 'sprawling', 'structure', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'Cianfrance', 'direction', 'edge', 'seats', 'most', '140-minute', 'running', 'time', 'helped', 'immeasurably', 'cinematographer', 'Sean', 'Bobbitt', 'editors', 'Jim', 'Helton', 'Ron', 'Patane', 'opening', 'sequence', 'showing', 'heavily', 'tattooed', 'Gosling', 'swaggering', 'way', 'carnival', 'crowd', 'wow', 'chase', 'scene', 'middle', 'movie', 'Gosling', 'Cooper.5', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'great', 'old', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'such', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Captains', 'Kings', 'thrust', 'story', 'however', 'as', 'old', 'Bible', 'fathers', 'eating', 'sour', 'grapes', 'sons', 'teeth', 'being', 'set', 'edge', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'messy', 'structure', 'not', 'loose', 'end', 'tied', 'powerful', 'moving', 'think', 'reputation', 'will', 'grow', 'years']",N/A
1629158,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYKM6,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Ryan Gosling once again blisters the screen as a loner who works as a motorcycle stunt man in a travelling carnival.  Set in Schenectady in upstate New York, Luke (Gosling) runs into Romina (Eva Mendes) with whom he had a brief fling on his visit a year ago.  As it turns out, she and he also have a baby boy.  Previously unaware, Luke decides to stay, get a job and help out financially.  Gumming up the works however is the fact that Romina has moved on and is living with a new man.Working as a mechanic, Luke is getting little work so he and his boss (Ben Mendelsohn) decide to rob a bank.  They get away with it, but Luke starts getting greedy and decides to go it alone.  He pulls one job too many.  In an unusually authentic chase scene between a couple police cars and Luke on his motorcycle, Luke is finally cornered in a house.  The cop who has found him is a rookie with a law degree (Bradley Cooper).  With another strong performance by Cooper, the film shifts gears as the two men exchange gunfire.  Avery (Cooper), seriously injured is marked as a hero.  But it doesn't sit well with him, especially given that he has a son the same age as Luke and Romina.  Things get more complicated as Avery's police friends harass Romina in an effort to find the cash that Luke had stolen.The film then jumps ahead 15 years.  Avery has become the District Attorney and is running for Attorney General.  His now 17 year old son A.J. (Emory Cohen) comes to live with him again after a long divorce.  He's a druggie and befriends Jason (Dane DeHaan), the son of, you guessed it, Romina and Luke.The movie is beautifully shot and logical in its display of events.  It is too long however clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes.  The final act in particular seemed to tell us what we already know.

1629177,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYKM6,Paul Allaer,"[3, 4]","""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012 release; 140 min.) reunites writer-director Derek Cianfrance with Ryan Gosling after the outstanding and critically acclaimed (but commercially ignored) ""Blue Valentine"" movie of a few years ago.There is no point in even trying to bring short synopsis of the movie's plot, as this would surely ruin your viewing experiencec, so let me give a few comments and observations instead: first, I had seen the preview of this movie on several occasions, and the impression you get from that is that the movie is about Ryan Gosling's character deciding to rob banks so as to support the baby he never knew he had. That is indeed part of the story, but that covers probably 30 min. into the movie, so what about the remaining 100+ minutes? All I will say is that as it turns out you get three connected mini-movies woven into one epic movie, and I will leave it at that. Second, the scenery in the movie in and around Schenectady, New York, is quite beautiful. I've never visited the area, and I know Schenectady primarily as having a large GE facility, and indeed the GE building in downtown is clearly visible in a number of shots. Third, there are several noteworthy performances, starting with Ryan Gosling (he is in my opinion one of the very best actors around today, does he ever give a bad performance?), but other notables include Eva Mendez as his one-time fling, Ray Liotta as a hard-nosed cop, and Rose Byrne as the wife of Bradley Cooper (look out for Rose Byrne in ""I Give It A Year"", which I saw a few months ago on an overseas trip and will be released in the US later this year). Kudos also for the enjoyable soundtrack (check out Bon Iver's outstanding song ""The Wolves (Act I Act II)"" that plays over the ending credits of the movie).This movie has been playing in the theatres here in Cincinnati for several weeks now and I was really on the fence about going. But ultimately I gave in. While it is not the masterpiece that was ""Blue Valentine"", ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" was far more enjoyable than I had expected. Shame on that completely misleading preview/trailer! If you are in the mood for something different or a movie where things don't get blown up every few minutes, I can readily recommend ""The Place Beyond the Pines"".",4,Three for the price of one,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,2280,"['Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', '2012', 'release', '140', 'min', 'writer-director', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'outstanding', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'commercially', 'ignored', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'ago.There', 'point', 'even', 'trying', 'bring', 'short', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'plot', 'would', 'surely', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experiencec', 'so', 'let', 'give', 'few', 'comments', 'observations', 'instead', 'first', 'had', 'seen', 'preview', 'movie', 'several', 'occasions', 'impression', 'get', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'deciding', 'rob', 'banks', 'so', 'support', 'baby', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'indeed', 'part', 'story', 'probably', '30', 'min', 'movie', 'what', 'remaining', '100+', 'minutes', 'will', 'say', 'out', 'get', 'three', 'connected', 'mini-movies', 'woven', 'one', 'epic', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'Second', 'scenery', 'movie', 'Schenectady', 'New', 'York', 'quite', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'never', 'visited', 'area', 'know', 'Schenectady', 'primarily', 'having', 'large', 'GE', 'facility', 'indeed', 'GE', 'building', 'downtown', 'clearly', 'visible', 'number', 'shots', 'Third', 'are', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'starting', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'actors', 'today', 'ever', 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'other', 'notables', 'include', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'one-time', 'fling', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'hard-nosed', 'cop', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'wife', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'look', 'out', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Give', 'Year', 'saw', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'overseas', 'trip', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'US', 'later', 'year', 'Kudos', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'soundtrack', 'check', 'out', 'Bon', 'Iver', 'outstanding', 'song', 'Wolves', 'Act', 'Act', 'II', 'ending', 'credits', 'movie', '.This', 'movie', 'been', 'playing', 'theatres', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'several', 'weeks', 'now', 'was', 'really', 'fence', 'going', 'ultimately', 'gave', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'expected', 'Shame', 'completely', 'misleading', 'preview/trailer', 'are', 'mood', 'something', 'different', 'movie', 'where', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'few', 'minutes', 'can', 'readily', 'recommend', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines']",N/A

This film has three story lines, and it is not until you are in the midst of the film that realization sets in.Ryan Gosling stars as Luke, a motorcycle stunt-rider who returns to town and finds he has a baby son, born after a one-night stand. Eva Mendes is his girlfriend and their chemistry sizzles. She understands he is not the steady man she yearns for. But, Luke wants to try and be the father he always wanted. Unfortunately, things don't always work out like you wish they would.In the second part we meet Bradley Cooper, who plays Avery, a rookie cop. He becomes a hero within his department , and then faces the first real test of his career. He also has a son, but is unable to be the father he wishes. His career advances until he is running for the State Attorney General.The third part occurs fifteen years later, when Luke and Avery's sons become friends at high school. Avery's son is a druggie, and Luke's son seems to be looking for himself. Neither does the right thing.The three cycles of this film are not centered. There seems to be a big hole. The first story with Luke is the most fulfilling, anything after Ryan Gosling is a let down. The second cycle is important but drags, and we can guess the result. The third cycle for me was redundant and not needed. Gosling stole the show, and I can't help but wonder if he had to sit everyday while those tattoos were drawn onto his body.

Each did half a movie.This a very good movie with an interesting story that could be taken from the headlines of many a newspaper.

He is getting scarier by the film. I bet when any film is in the works...the first name that comes up is Ray Liotta.The babies (beautiful) do an excellent job.

1629195,A1RNSJIOGBUYCC,B00BEIYKM6,robhartjr,"[3, 5]","I am a fan of ""The Gos""(Ryan Gosling). I admit I even tried to emulate him in ""Drive"" and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". He is a great actor and he always seems to make great movies whether they are mainstream or independent. He has already received recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"". I was excited to see what character he would bring to life next when I heard about this movie. I saw the running time of 140 minutes and saw the trailer. I wondered how they were gonna make a movie of Gosling and Cooper last that long without dragging. Then I found out that Gosling is only in the first third of the movie despite him being the face of the movie. At first I felt disappointed, but I got over it because I know that isn't a way to judge a movie. So I went in after hearing mostly praise for this gem of a film.If most of you haven't already figured out, the movie is divided into 3 acts. The first follows Luke(Gosling) a motorcyclist from a traveling carnival who quits upon finding out he has a son. He struggles to provide for the son Jason, who's mother Romina(Eva Mendez) is now with another man. He resorts to robbing banks. These actions lead into the Second act which follows Avery(Bradley Cooper) after he has a traumatic run in with Luke. Avery, a cop who also has a son, is struggling with corruption within the police station. Soon he finds a job as the Assistant DA. The third act takes place 15 years later. Now Luke and Averys sons Jason and AJ are teenagers. Soon they become frenemies. All of the actions from the first two acts collide into a dramatic finale. That is just the gist of the plot.The first act was emotionally tense. This was also the best of the three acts in my opinion. Each act was like a mini movie. But this act could have been expanded into a separate movie if possible! It was intense, the dialogue with Ben Mendelsohns character was great. Ben Mendelsohn should really be recognized for Best Supporting Actor here. Gosling gives a great performance as an Outlaw type, but also a caring man who just wants to provide for his son.The second act featured less of the emotion from the first act and more of the crime aspect of the movie. For a second I thought Martin Scorcese had taken over the script. That is a compliment. Cooper also does great acting here! At first you will hate his character, but as you realize what is going on, you will almost forget about the first act and now focus on the story of Avery!The third act seems to be getting the least praise. I am confused with that. Some are saying it was unneeded. I strongly disagree with those opinions! This was the perfect way to end this story! Many people are complaining that it was too clich&eacute; to include this part. It wasn't as good as the first two acts, but it was still great. The fact that the two sons meet and become friends is intriguing. It makes you wonder what will happen scene after scene. Great climatic ending to the movie!The directing is top notch. This movie is beautiful to watch. It did what movies that use an overload of CGI mostly can't do. It told a genuinely good and tension filled story. I do like some movies with some good CGI, but I love movies that don't rely on special effects even more! The acting was stunning from all members of the cast. Its hard to choose a best actor between Gosling and Cooper, but there is no doubt in my mind that Ben Mendelsohn did a magnificent job in his supporting role! The story of this movie is gut wrenching. Its a drama. Its a crime drama. Its a thriller. Its even a R rated High School movie in the final act at times. It is a modern epic tragedy. It is a tale of karma and decisions. I personally think it is much better than Director Derek Cianfrances last film with Gosling ""Blue Valentine"". This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout, especially in the third act. Again regarding the third act, I think most people aren't too keen with it because of the way one of the teens talks throughout. I got used to it within 5 minutes though as I thought it was actually a nice touch. The music of the movie is brilliantly placed too. The musical score was haunting and beautiful. The main theme cuts deep especially the way it was used in the film! Stay with the credits to finalize the experience because the song ""The Wolves"" by Bon Iver that plays is a true emotional masterpiece that goes well with the movie that preceded it!I recommend this movie to anybody that loves a genuinely good original movie. This movie does demand your full attention though. If needed, you might have to put on the subtitles to fully understand some of the less audible dialogue. But that is your personal choice. This is a great movie for men particularly, whether you're a father, a son or both. This movie is great for women too, but men will have a more personal experience with the movie! This movie will stick with you either way!",5,A Tragic Epic of Karma and Decisions.,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,4921,"['am', 'fan', 'Gos', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'admit', 'even', 'tried', 'emulate', 'Drive', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'great', 'actor', 'always', 'make', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'mainstream', 'independent', 'already', 'received', 'recognition', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'character', 'would', 'bring', 'life', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'saw', 'running', 'time', '140', 'minutes', 'saw', 'trailer', 'wondered', 'how', 'were', 'gon', 'make', 'movie', 'Gosling', 'Cooper', 'last', 'long', 'dragging', 'Then', 'found', 'out', 'Gosling', 'only', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'being', 'face', 'movie', 'first', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'got', 'know', ""n't"", 'way', 'judge', 'movie', 'So', 'went', 'hearing', 'mostly', 'praise', 'gem', 'film.If', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'figured', 'out', 'movie', 'divided', '3', 'acts', 'first', 'Luke', 'Gosling', 'motorcyclist', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'who', 'finding', 'out', 'son', 'provide', 'son', 'Jason', 'who', 'mother', 'Romina', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'now', 'man', 'robbing', 'banks', 'actions', 'lead', 'Second', 'act', 'Avery', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'traumatic', 'run', 'Luke', 'Avery', 'cop', 'who', 'also', 'son', 'struggling', 'corruption', 'police', 'station', 'job', 'Assistant', 'DA', 'third', 'act', 'place', '15', 'years', 'later', 'Now', 'Luke', 'Averys', 'sons', 'Jason', 'AJ', 'are', 'teenagers', 'Soon', 'become', 'frenemies', 'actions', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'collide', 'dramatic', 'finale', 'just', 'gist', 'plot.The', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'emotionally', 'tense', 'was', 'also', 'best', 'three', 'acts', 'opinion', 'act', 'was', 'mini', 'movie', 'act', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'separate', 'movie', 'possible', 'was', 'intense', 'dialogue', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohns', 'character', 'was', 'great', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'recognized', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'here', 'Gosling', 'great', 'performance', 'Outlaw', 'type', 'also', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'provide', 'son.The', 'second', 'act', 'featured', 'less', 'emotion', 'first', 'act', 'more', 'crime', 'aspect', 'movie', 'second', 'thought', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'script', 'compliment', 'Cooper', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'here', 'first', 'will', 'hate', 'character', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'will', 'almost', 'forget', 'first', 'act', 'now', 'focus', 'story', 'Avery', 'third', 'act', 'be', 'getting', 'least', 'praise', 'am', 'confused', 'are', 'saying', 'was', 'unneeded', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'opinions', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'end', 'story', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'was', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'include', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'fact', 'two', 'sons', 'meet', 'become', 'friends', 'intriguing', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'scene', 'scene', 'Great', 'climatic', 'ending', 'movie', 'directing', 'top', 'notch', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'did', 'what', 'movies', 'use', 'overload', 'CGI', 'mostly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'told', 'genuinely', 'good', 'tension', 'filled', 'story', 'do', 'movies', 'good', 'CGI', 'love', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'more', 'acting', 'was', 'stunning', 'members', 'cast', 'hard', 'choose', 'best', 'actor', 'Gosling', 'Cooper', 'doubt', 'mind', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'supporting', 'role', 'story', 'movie', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'drama', 'crime', 'drama', 'thriller', 'even', 'R', 'rated', 'High', 'School', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'times', 'modern', 'epic', 'tragedy', 'tale', 'karma', 'decisions', 'personally', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'Director', 'Derek', 'Cianfrances', 'last', 'film', 'Gosling', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'movie', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'especially', 'third', 'act', 'Again', 'regarding', 'third', 'act', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'way', 'one', 'teens', 'talks', 'got', 'used', '5', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'nice', 'touch', 'music', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'placed', 'too', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'main', 'theme', 'cuts', 'deep', 'especially', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'Stay', 'credits', 'finalize', 'experience', 'song', 'Wolves', 'Bon', 'Iver', 'true', 'emotional', 'masterpiece', 'well', 'movie', 'preceded', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anybody', 'genuinely', 'good', 'original', 'movie', 'movie', 'demand', 'full', 'attention', 'needed', 'might', 'have', 'put', 'subtitles', 'fully', 'understand', 'less', 'audible', 'dialogue', 'personal', 'choice', 'great', 'movie', 'men', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'father', 'son', 'movie', 'great', 'women', 'too', 'men', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'personal', 'experience', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'way']",N/A

1629218,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00BEIYKM6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 14]","""The Place Beyond the Pines"", the new film from director Derek Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") is really two and a half films and one of these is much better than the others, resulting in an uneven, unsuccessful work. I don't like faulting someone for trying too hard, but...Luke (Ryan Gosling), a tattooed motorcycle stunt driver, looks up an old girlfriend, Romina (Eva Mendes), when the carnival he rides with is back in her hometown. He learns she had a son, his son, during the year he was away, and decides to stick around, despite the fact she is now living with Kofi (Mahershala Ali), her new boyfriend. The only way he feels he can get the money he needs is to start robbing banks, using his superb motorcycle riding skills to elude the law. He takes the money to Romina, but she rejects it. But her attraction to Luke proves to be very strong. Luke decides to amass as much money as possible and present it to Romina as a nest egg, and buy gifts for the baby, so he decides to rob two banks in one day. After the first robbery, Avery (Bradley Cooper), a rookie on the police force, spots him and pursues him on foot into a family home. Avery is wounded in action and becomes a bit of a celebrity. He uses the celebrity to quickly rise through the ranks of his department and eventually runs for public office. Fifteen years later, Avery's son,  AJ (Emory Cohen), and Luke's son, Jason (Dan DeHaan), meet in high school and become friends, unaware of the history their fathers have.Cianfrance became widely known when his second feature ""Blue Valentine"" began making the circuit. ""Valentine"" features amazing performances from the two leads Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Despite the depressing nature of the story, it is impossible to not watch the actors depict the downward spiral of this couple's relationship. We recognize and identify with various aspects of their lives, but they are living through every bad aspect of a relationship and neither has the ability to make a change, any change, to break this heartbreaking spiral. The film is tragic and riveting, more so because we spend almost the entire film with just these two people. This allows Cianfrance, Gosling and Williams to go to places we don't see a lot and the actors are able to explore the depths of despair in which these two characters live. The narrow scope also allows the director and actors to concentrate on their relationship, to make it as powerful, and interesting as possible.When someone experiences success at something, he or she usually wants to set their sights on something bigger, to expand their skills, knowledge, risk and reward. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is bigger; more characters, a multi-generational storyline, more going on. The film represents quite a leap forward for Cianfrance, maybe too much of a leap. I applaud Cianfrance for pushing forward, for trying something different, but the development of the characters and the narrative both fall short.The first part of the film tells Luke's story, concentrating on his relationship with Romina and his efforts to get some money to care for his child. As you watch Gosling, you become a part of his story and it is hard not to get involved with what everyone knows will not be a happy ending.There is something insanely watchable about Ryan Gosling. It is easy to see why he is so immensely popular; even in his less successful films, you can't take your eyes off him. His charisma just oozes like a young Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford. In ""Gangster Squad"", his recent co-starring role with Josh Brolin was more odd and his Mickey Mouse voice was just distracting from his attempts to act and appear tough. But still, if you decide to spend your time and money to watch the film, you won't take your eyes off the screen when Gosling is present. Better yet, Gosling seems to regularly alternate between big budget studio fare and more challenging independent films, giving him something to do as an actor while making him a household name among two different sets of moviegoers.What I wasn't expecting was the episodic narrative. It is an interesting idea, and has some benefits, but it isn't handled very well here. Near the end of Luke's story, Avery is introduced and we shift our focus to his life for the next portion of the film. This isn't a commonly used narrative device, but when it works, it works because both actors are engaging, maybe for different reasons, but they both hold your attention.I am a big fan of Bradley Cooper and have had a huge crush on him from the beginning. I even went to see ""Hit and Run"", director Dax Shepard's (yes, DIRECTOR Dax Shepard's) car chase film, because of his supporting role. I have to say that's the mark of a true fan. I paid for two of the twenty tickets sold for the screening I attended on opening weekend. But he doesn't rise to the level of Gosling's work in this film, which makes his part of the story less interesting and enjoyable.When the attention shifts again to their two sons, fifteen years later, the story becomes a little more interesting simply because the actors playing their sons are less well-known and there is the feeling we might discover a great new talent, a new star-making performance. I don't think either really gets to that level, but their work seems raw and holds our attention more.This also points to a flaw in the director's work. A more accomplished director would recognize how powerful Gosling's performance is and try to balance Cooper's work more. This isn't always possible - even Scorsese failed to do this on ""Gangs of New York""; Daniel Day-Lewis completely overshadows DiCaprio and everyone else in the movie - but it helps the overall film when the performances are on the same level. When they aren't, it usually isn't as noticeable. But the episodic narrative makes the imbalance more pronounced.""Blue Valentine"" is a remarkably good film. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is more ambitious and more flawed. Cianfrance uses a similar visual a few times in the film, but doesn't use this same framing at the very end of the film, when he could and probable should. It seems like a missed opportunity to really send the message home and provide a moment of impact.Cianfrance clearly has promise and may one day create a beautiful, memorable, haunting film. As the director makes more films, I have no doubt he will continue to add skills and his films will become stronger. He may make some missteps along the way, but he has already established himself as a filmmaker to watch and I will eagerly seek out each new film.",3,An Imperfect Place...,1367366400,"05 1,

1629221,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00BEIYKM6,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","The Place Beyond The Pines is the kind of film that I love. The film is broken up into three stories, starring three different actors, and it all comes together at the end. The film is about two men, one is a criminal, the other is a cop, and both have a decision to make. One makes the right choice, the other makes the wrong one, and fifteen years later, both decisions have a huge impact on their children, who come together in High School. Each part features a different actor, Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Dane DeHann. While they were all terrific, it's Cooper who really stands out. I thought he was good in Limitless, but he blows that performance away, giving an Oscar worthy portrayal. Due to the violent nature of the film, of course the Academy overlooked him, but you will be hard pressed to find a better performance all year. He was magically and is the thread that connects the stories. Without Cooper being at his best, this film probably wouldn't have worked out as well as it did. There are so many supporting stars and the story becomes so much more complex than it appears to be. Watching The Place Beyond The Pines was really like seeing three different short plays, that are loosely tied together, but don't make much of an impact until you see the fourth and final act. Once you see the whole picture, you will be blown away, both by the magnitude of the story and an unexpected conclusion.

Luke (Gosling) is a motorcycle stunt driver who returns to his hometown and reconnects with his former lover. When he finds out that she is raising his child Luke changes his ways. Going from stunt man to bank robber. His life of crime puts him on a course with Avery (Cooper), a police officer trying to do the right thing. The meeting of these two changes two families in ways that no one can see coming. This is a hard movie to review. I must first start by saying that this was nothing at all like what I expected. I will try and do this without trying to give anything away. The movie is almost like three mini movies in one. First 45 min deals with Luke, then switches to Avery and finally their children. I expected this to be more of a type of cat and mouse movie, it isn't. The movie deals with one event that links and defines not only the two involved but also the families of the robber and cop. This is not a movie you can just put in and watch, this is one that makes you think and wonder who is right and wrong. This is not a movie for everyone and if you are looking for a fast paced action thriller this is not it. This is more of an art house type drama that shows how one decision can change your life. Overall, not a bad movie at all and it is worth watching but not at all what I was expecting. I give it a B.",4,A movie that is good & worth watching but nothing at all like I expected.

Director Derek Cianfrance's follow-up to his critically acclaimed ""Blue Valentine"" is more ambitious in scale, with two stars Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper both top-billed. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins with a bang, with an intriguing chapter featuring ever-charismatic Ryan Gosling, but loses momentum in its mid-section where familiarity creeps in.Ryan Gosling plays Luke Glanton, a stunt motorcycle rider of a traveling carnival. When Luke learns that he is a father of a son from his former lover Romina, (Eva Mendes), he quits the job and stays in the town. But Romina just does not want him around. Luke then gets involved with local bank robberies.This is where a police officer Avery Cross enters the story. Now, both Luke and Avery have a son. About fifteen years later, Luke's son Jason (Dane DeHaan) and Avery's son AJ (Emory Cohen) meet each other, not knowing what happened to their fathers in the past.The cast all did a superb job, especially Ryan Gosling who appears only in one-third of the film. The film maintains a slow pace and low-key atmosphere throughout, but when things happen, they tend to be brutal and violent. Also, there is one great chase scene that alone is worth watching. Great bike stunts are not to be missed.""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" a crime (or revenge) drama told with the spirit and scale of Greek tragedy, requires patience on the viewer's part.

1629227,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BEIYKM6,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0The film's title is loosely based on a Native American name for Schenectady, New York, where the story takes place. Director Derek Cianfrance's effort represents an improvement over his prior blue collar soap opera, 'Blue Valentine'. Here, his story is more ambitious, a triptych of sorts, focusing on a group of interconnected characters.In Part 1 of 3, the strongest of the three stories, Ryan Gosling is Luke Blanton, a 'bad boy' motorcycle stuntman who quits his job in order to raise his one year old son who he fathered with a former flame, Romina. Much to his chagrin, she's now involved with another man, Kofi, and wants nothing to do with him.Luke soon befriends Robin, a former bank robber and now owner of a small auto repair business, who suggests that a good way to provide for his son, is to rob banks. Gosling does a fine job in depicting our resident psychopath as he goes about terrorizing bank customers and brutally assaulting Romina's boyfriend with a wrench after he brings a crib over for the baby at the boyfriend's residence (the assault results in Luke's arrest). Everything is rationalized in the name of being a 'good father' and Luke's violent behavior keeps escalating. When Robin wants out of the bank robbery business he dismantles Luke's motorcycle but Luke sticks a gun in his mouth and confiscates the bail money which Robin had laid out.Part 2 (not as good as Part 1) begins when Luke reaches the end of the line after being caught in the act of his final bank robbery. He ends up in a residential home where we're introduced to the new protagonist, PO Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), who shoots Luke before he gets his own shot off, hitting Cross in the knee. Luke then falls out the window and bleeds to death on the pavement below.There seems to be some question as to whether Avery was justified in shooting Luke, especially because he gave him no chance to surrender. At the same time, things happened so fast, that Avery probably had a good case in arguing the shooting was completely justified, since it was quite probable that Luke was armed and could have shot him right away (and as it turned out, Luke indeed was armed and did fire his gun, but only after Avery shot him first). As it turns out, an internal police investigation exonerates Avery but he remains guilt-ridden simply because he killed a fellow human being. Avery even tells a police psychologist that he can't stop thinking about Luke's son when he looks at his own son.It seems odd that Avery would go along with the two crooked fellow officers, Scotty and Deluca, who confiscate Luke's bank robbery stash from underneath Romina's son's crib. They gave him the lion's share and we soon find out why Avery goes along: he offers Romina all of his share back, but she refuses. What happens next didn't seem believable at all. Avery decides to rat out his fellow officers by going to the chief of police. Now why wouldn't Avery realize that the chief of police is just as bad as his fellow officers and would end up telling them about his decision to report their illegal actions? This is borne out when Deluca asks Avery to follow him in his car and he complies, until it suddenly dawns on him (duh!), this is an ambush (wouldn't anyone with any common sense have figured out what was going down?).Avery seemingly has a way out when he records another officer who's trying to steal drugs from the police property room where Avery is now relegated to. Avery uses the tape to blackmail the DA who is forced to prosecute all the corrupt cops. We're asked to flash forward 15 years but wouldn't Avery still be in danger? Yes, all the cops have been jailed but I'm sure they have plenty of friends in town who might want to get back at him (and what about when the cops get out of jail later on?). So again, would any normal person put their trust in a police chief who is suspect from the get-go?Part 3 focuses on Avery's teenage son, AJ who unknowingly befriends Luke's son, Jason, while they're students together in high school. AJ's parents are now divorced and he appears to be severely influenced by gang culture. Unfortunately, there's only one scene which shows the interaction between father and son (Avery confronts AJ after he's arrested for assaulting Jason). So why did AJ turn out the way he did? Not explained. We're asked to assume that Avery's quest to become state attorney keeps him away from acting as a good parent.Even less convincing is Jason's quest to take revenge on Avery. He never had any connection to Luke and only learns about him from talking to Robin and reading old newspaper clippings. Furthermore, Romina and Kofi appear to have been good parents. I can see why he wants to get back at AJ (whose initial assault on him was particularly brutal) but why Avery? Perhaps it's just a teenager's impulsivity but Avery's reaction where he gets down on his knees and begs forgiveness just seems over the top. It goes all the way back to when Avery shot Luke--should he have felt that guilty? To my mind, he was doing his job as a police officer; and had Luke not robbed banks and broken into someone's house, Avery would not have had to shoot Luke in the first place.Director Cianfrance aims high here and manages to keep one's interest throughout. Nonetheless, only the first story, the chronicle of the psychopath Luke, proves compelling. Avery and the two boys are not developed well enough and let's not even discuss the female characters. 'Pines' is no masterpiece but is still worth a look!",2,"Watchable, but Schenectady 'epic' has a few too many false notes",1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,5587,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',
