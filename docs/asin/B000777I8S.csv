877382,A3SH2Z6PZ5XBXR,B000777I8S,A reader,"[2, 2]","Featuring a new line-up, a new sound and a new hit, this concert shows Yes as a revamped, resuscitated band quite unlike its earlier incarnations.  Gone are the elaborate progessive rock tunes like 'Close to the Edge' and 'Awaken'.  Instead, you have shorter, more concise compositions like 'City of Love' and 'Hold On' as well as the fast moving, energetic instrumental 'Cinema'.The new line-up is an interesting one; almost a blend of the old and the new.  Founding member Jon Anderson, of course, is on lead vocals and Chris Squire is on bass.  Tony Kaye, a third founding member, returns to his keyboard duties after a thirteen year absence.  Alan White, a member since 1972, plays drums and newcomer Trevor Rabin is on guitar.  Rabin's influence is everpresent as the writer or co-writer of almost all performed material and this explains the resulting evolution of the band's new sound.Yes also pays tribute to its past by performing Your Move/All Good People and Starship Trooper from The Yes Album, the band's last offering featuring Tony Kaye.The performances are quite good, each tune faithfully reproduced from its studio original.  Rabin does a good job of replicating Steve Howe's work and shows himself to be a guitarist extraordinaire worthy of a band like Yes.The only criticism I have is that the performances are pretty predictable, the members seldom taking any chances or going out on any sort of musical limb.  The only exception, to me, is Tony Kaye's excellent solo during Starship Trooper which was done with much exuberance and flair.Chris Squire definitely seems to be enjoying himself with much bantering and joking with Rabin onstage - something he seldom did when performing with the more serious and cerebrial Steve Howe.  Kaye also mugs the camera and John Anderson laughs when he runs out of breath at one point during Starship Trooper. The members show themselves as being more mature now and comfortable with their legacy and accomplishments and definitely able to take themselves a little less seriously.All in all a good outing, with interesting special effects that don't really interfere with the performances.  Included as a bonus is 'Roundabout' which the band pulls off reasonably well with much stage antics and laughing.9012live shows Yes as a top forty group with a good sprinkling of progressive rock virtuousity.

877383,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B000777I8S,"bass boy ""music fan""","[5, 6]","Hey guys,The video and audio are excellent. Only one ""bonus"" song, though, ""Roundabout,"" which was cut for some reason from the original video version. Equally (or even more so) interesting is director Steven Soderbergh's backstage documentary that follows the members - keyboardist Tony Kaye is a prankster and, at that very moment in time, is ""glad"" he isn't Rick Wakeman because he's the one on the tour. Also interesting is Trevor Rabin complaining about his own ""heavy metal""-like soloing on some songs, saying that one guitar passage is too long. It's an interesting twist for those fans who hate Rabin and love ""classic"" Yes six-stringer Steve Howe. Jon Anderson is his usual, spacey-kind of a person, and then there's the great Chris Squire, who seems to be holding a drinking cup on all Yes vidoes when he isn't clutching a bass guitar or one of his children/grandchildren. Squire is one of the kings of the bass , no questions asked!All of the guys are interviewed by Soderbergh during the tour, and Chris seems to almost zone out here and there, offering serious statements that contrast his humorous, jumping-around persona while under the spotlight.Also, Alan White is solid on the drums, although he doesn't sound as ""on fire"" as he did on their 1980 LP ""Drama."" White also offers his view on the band's ""reunion"" following their underappreciated LP and tour with Buggles members Travor Horn and Geoff Downes. (Is it me, or does White almost have NO british accent at all? Must be all that time spent living in Seattle.)Definitely worth owning if you're a Yes fan, even for us fans who prefer the Steve Howe years, it's still a solid video for a cheap selling price.Enjoy!",4,"I've seen this video - it looks and sounds very, very good",1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1686,"['Hey', 'guys', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'excellent', 'Only', 'one', 'bonus', 'song', 'though', 'Roundabout', 'was', 'cut', 'reason', 'original', 'video', 'version', 'Equally', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'interesting', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'backstage', 'documentary', 'members', 'keyboardist', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'prankster', 'very', 'moment', 'time', 'glad', ""n't"", 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'one', 'tour', 'Also', 'interesting', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'complaining', 'own', 'heavy', 'metal', '-like', 'soloing', 'songs', 'saying', 'one', 'guitar', 'passage', 'too', 'long', 'interesting', 'twist', 'fans', 'who', 'hate', 'Rabin', 'love', 'classic', 'Yes', 'six-stringer', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'usual', 'spacey-kind', 'person', 'then', 'great', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'who', 'be', 'holding', 'drinking', 'cup', 'Yes', 'vidoes', 'when', ""n't"", 'clutching', 'bass', 'guitar', 'one', 'children/grandchildren', 'Squire', 'one', 'kings', 'bass', 'questions', 'asked', 'guys', 'are', 'interviewed', 'Soderbergh', 'tour', 'Chris', 'almost', 'zone', 'out', 'here', 'there', 'offering', 'serious', 'statements', 'contrast', 'humorous', 'jumping-around', 'persona', 'spotlight.Also', 'Alan', 'White', 'solid', 'drums', ""n't"", 'sound', 'fire', 'did', '1980', 'LP', 'Drama', 'White', 'also', 'view', 'band', 'reunion', 'following', 'underappreciated', 'LP', 'tour', 'Buggles', 'members', 'Travor', 'Horn', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'White', 'almost', 'have', 'NO', 'british', 'accent', 'Must', 'be', 'time', 'spent', 'living', 'Seattle', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'owning', ""'re"", 'Yes', 'fan', 'even', 'fans', 'who', 'prefer', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'years', 'still', 'solid', 'video', 'cheap', 'selling', 'price.Enjoy']",N/A

877385,A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,B000777I8S,David Carlin,"[4, 24]","The reality is, the fans that came to know YES formally through 90125, the album, did not stick around much after this period of Yes mainly because it was Pop Rock.  Rabin wrote some simple rock songs during a period when Alan White and Chris Squire were without Wakeman, Anderson and Howe.  Anderson re-joined to sing on top of the Rabin tunes and add very minimal ideas.  It worked for a short time, but those who supported Yes and Know their earlier history see at this time period, a decline of longer thought out material.  More emphasis seemed to be on rhythm rather than intricate melodies. Rabin was not a particularly good guitarist and some of those albums, including the last in the series called ""Talk"" are very very weak and do not hold up to the classic Yes Lineup and the ""Talk"" tour was actually cut short.  Yes Music in the traditional sense represented battles of ideas and riffs, democracy of all musicians in the group.  In saying this, the DVD is well produced and does include a director's cut minus the 50's embellishments.  Also, the documentaries are excellent and you get a chance to hear a pretty in-depth look at how each of the members interpreted how Yes evolved.  Also a very interesting look at Tony Kaye.  He made some interesting comments including when he was originally fired from the band.  Many people don't realize that Brian Lane, Yes's second manager bartered future royalities for a lump sum payment for members who were leaving and this was the case with Tony.  This DVD is good for nostalgia but doesn't go to the soul of the band's fruitful music period.  This DVD captures Yes at the height of the ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" period.When I was a teenager in the 80's, I first heard Yes from the Close to the Edge, and Going for the One Albums.  I slowly went through their catalog up to that point.  Yes music demanded time to listen and if your mind was open, you were taken on a journey of feeling.  When Yes re-appeared back in 1982 with Rabin, I could feel immediately that this was not a band project and I began to feel a longing for Howe and Wakeman to re-appear.",3,DVD Marks the Rabin songwriting era.,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2114,"['reality', 'fans', 'came', 'know', 'YES', 'formally', '90125', 'album', 'did', 'not', 'stick', 'around', 'much', 'period', 'Yes', 'mainly', 'was', 'Pop', 'Rock', 'Rabin', 'wrote', 'simple', 'rock', 'songs', 'period', 'when', 'Alan', 'White', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'were', 'Wakeman', 'Anderson', 'Howe', 'Anderson', 're-joined', 'sing', 'top', 'Rabin', 'tunes', 'add', 'very', 'minimal', 'ideas', 'worked', 'short', 'time', 'who', 'supported', 'Yes', 'Know', 'earlier', 'history', 'see', 'time', 'period', 'decline', 'longer', 'thought', 'out', 'material', 'More', 'emphasis', 'seemed', 'be', 'rhythm', 'rather', 'intricate', 'melodies', 'Rabin', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'guitarist', 'albums', 'including', 'last', 'series', 'called', 'Talk', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'weak', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'classic', 'Yes', 'Lineup', 'Talk', 'tour', 'was', 'actually', 'cut', 'short', 'Yes', 'Music', 'traditional', 'sense', 'represented', 'battles', 'ideas', 'riffs', 'democracy', 'musicians', 'group', 'saying', 'DVD', 'well', 'produced', 'include', 'director', 'cut', 'minus', '50', 'embellishments', 'Also', 'documentaries', 'are', 'excellent', 'get', 'chance', 'hear', 'pretty', 'in-depth', 'look', 'how', 'members', 'interpreted', 'how', 'Yes', 'evolved', 'Also', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'made', 'interesting', 'comments', 'including', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'fired', 'band', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Yes', 'second', 'manager', 'bartered', 'future', 'royalities', 'lump', 'sum', 'payment', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'leaving', 'was', 'case', 'Tony', 'DVD', 'good', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'go', 'soul', 'band', 'fruitful', 'music', 'period', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'height', 'Owner', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'period.When', 'was', 'teenager', '80', 'first', 'heard', 'Yes', 'Close', 'Edge', 'Going', 'One', 'Albums', 'slowly', 'went', 'catalog', 'up', 'point', 'Yes', 'music', 'demanded', 'time', 'listen', 'mind', 'was', 'open', 'were', 'taken', 'journey', 'feeling', 'When', 'Yes', 're-appeared', 'back', '1982', 'Rabin', 'could', 'feel', 'immediately', 'was', 'not', 'band', 'project', 'began', 'feel', 'longing', 'Howe', 'Wakeman', 're-appear']",N/A

This concert was captured during their more pop oriented phase, with Trevor Rabin and much of the original lineup. All of the band is in fine form, and some of the songs, particularly ""Hold On"" and ""Starship Trooper"" really take off.What makes this video special is that is was directed by Steven Soderburgh, before Sex, Lies, and Videotape and all of the big movies he has since become known for. So it is not just a straight on concert video, where there are four or five cameras capturing the action. Instead, there are numerous special effects that add to the repeat viewing of the concert.The video itself has been released numerous times...first on VHS, then on Laserdisc, and finally on a Brazillian DVD, which was adequate.

877389,A35IF873PPAMFZ,B000777I8S,"Jeff Barnaby ""Jeff Barnaby""","[17, 19]","I have to admit a couple of things first.  I am probably one of six or seven YES fans who appreciate both Trevor Rabin and Steve Howe as YES guitarists.  This is primarily because my introduction to YES was backwards compared to most.  As a guitarist myself, I became familiar with YES during the hey day of MTV when this video was originally released.  At the time I thought this was the most incredible music ever produced and Trevor Rabin became an instant guitar hero.  Over the years I became familiar with the Classic YES lineup and I will now confess that I do sort of understand the disapproval of the Howe fans.  Still I defend Trevor Rabin because he did not set out to join YES and replace Steve Howe.  He joined up with Chris Squire and Alan White when is appeared YES was NO more -- a regular event in YES's impressive history.  When Tony Kaye and Jon Anderson joined up the band became a new incarnation of YES, and different or not, they did stay around until the mid 90's and produced some pretty good stuff of their own along the way.  And since they kept throwing in new versions of Classic YES standards, they managed to introduce a whole new generation to the vintage material.So trying to put my personal feelings aside, this DVD holds up pretty well on its own.  While not as crisp as the newer YES shows, the video is still clean and the audio is not bad.  There seems to be a lot of people out there really liking the straight concert footage without the graphics.  To me one's just as good as the other.  I think I prefer the graphics left in.  After all, this was a 1984 concert/movie made back when, as that new song out there says, when there were videos on MTV, so there is nothing wrong with it looking ""so 80's.""The concert is a bit on the short side, especially for a YES concert which can typically run for well over 2 hours.  When this DVD was delayed so many times I was hoping that they were going to add the instrument solo footage from the ""9012-LIVE  The Solos"" album that was released in 1984.  I think that the songs from 90125 come off between pretty well and excellent, except for Leave It.  An earlier reviewer observed that it consists mostly of tracks from the album and that is correct.  Makes for a C- concert song.  Still with all the overdubbing they did on the original song, what else could they have done?""Hold On"", ""Changes"", ""All Good People"", and ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" are probably the best songs of the show.  ""City of Love"" works pretty well.  ""It Can Happen"" is OK, but sounds a little off in a few places.  Again, ""Leave It"" is mostly tracked.  ""Cinema"" gets things off in the beginning and its a pretty good start.  Sadly, ""Starship Trooper"" at the end is probably the weakest songs.  It starts off sounding OK but frequently sounds hollow in places.  While I have always loved Trevor as a guitarist it seems that he is struggling with covering some of Howe's parts.  The solo at the end is way too cluttered and over the top.  I much preferred his playing on ""All Good People"" where, even though he took some liberties, he contained himself within the song and stayed true to its spirit.Finally, the extras -- Quite good and plenty of them.  I very much enjoyed the before and after backstage moments.  Gives one a true since of life out there on the road.  The band member interview were great although they left me a feeling a bit odd.  All the band members then are younger that I am now -- but when I saw this film they were considered to be an ""older band"", ahh!!  The cut of Roundabout is not all that great and answers all questions regarding why it was left off of the final version of the film.So the final vote -- 4 out of 5 stars.  Good clean cut from the 80's, several well done cuts (although they really should have included the solos), and some great memories from the better MTV years.",4,Great moments from Rabin-Era YES,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,3867,"['have', 'admit', 'couple', 'things', 'first', 'am', 'probably', 'one', 'six', 'seven', 'YES', 'fans', 'who', 'appreciate', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'YES', 'primarily', 'introduction', 'YES', 'was', 'backwards', 'compared', 'most', 'guitarist', 'became', 'familiar', 'YES', 'hey', 'day', 'MTV', 'when', 'video', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'incredible', 'music', 'ever', 'produced', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'became', 'instant', 'guitar', 'hero', 'years', 'became', 'familiar', 'Classic', 'YES', 'lineup', 'will', 'now', 'confess', 'do', 'sort', 'understand', 'disapproval', 'Howe', 'fans', 'Still', 'defend', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'did', 'not', 'set', 'out', 'join', 'YES', 'replace', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'joined', 'up', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Alan', 'White', 'when', 'appeared', 'YES', 'was', 'NO', 'more', 'regular', 'event', 'YES', 'impressive', 'history', 'When', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'joined', 'up', 'band', 'became', 'new', 'incarnation', 'YES', 'different', 'not', 'did', 'stay', 'mid', '90', 'produced', 'pretty', 'good', 'stuff', 'own', 'way', 'kept', 'throwing', 'new', 'versions', 'Classic', 'YES', 'standards', 'managed', 'introduce', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'vintage', 'material.So', 'trying', 'put', 'personal', 'feelings', 'aside', 'DVD', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'own', 'not', 'as', 'crisp', 'newer', 'YES', 'shows', 'video', 'still', 'clean', 'audio', 'not', 'bad', 'be', 'lot', 'people', 'there', 'really', 'liking', 'straight', 'concert', 'footage', 'graphics', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'think', 'prefer', 'graphics', 'left', 'was', '1984', 'concert/movie', 'made', 'back', 'when', 'new', 'song', 'there', 'when', 'were', 'videos', 'MTV', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'looking', 'so', '80', 'concert', 'bit', 'short', 'side', 'especially', 'YES', 'concert', 'can', 'typically', 'run', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'When', 'DVD', 'was', 'delayed', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'hoping', 'were', 'going', 'add', 'instrument', 'solo', 'footage', '9012-LIVE', 'Solos', 'album', 'was', 'released', '1984', 'think', 'songs', '90125', 'come', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'excellent', 'Leave', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'observed', 'mostly', 'tracks', 'album', 'correct', 'Makes', 'C-', 'concert', 'song', 'Still', 'overdubbing', 'did', 'original', 'song', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Hold', 'Changes', 'Good', 'People', 'Owner', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'songs', 'show', 'City', 'Love', 'pretty', 'well', 'Can', 'Happen', 'OK', 'little', 'off', 'few', 'places', 'Again', 'Leave', 'mostly', 'tracked', 'Cinema', 'things', 'off', 'beginning', 'pretty', 'good', 'start', 'Sadly', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'end', 'probably', 'weakest', 'songs', 'sounding', 'OK', 'frequently', 'hollow', 'places', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Trevor', 'guitarist', 'struggling', 'covering', 'Howe', 'parts', 'solo', 'end', 'way', 'too', 'cluttered', 'top', 'much', 'preferred', 'playing', 'Good', 'People', 'where', 'even', 'took', 'liberties', 'contained', 'song', 'stayed', 'true', 'spirit.Finally', 'extras', 'Quite', 'good', 'plenty', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'before', 'backstage', 'moments', 'one', 'true', 'life', 'there', 'road', 'band', 'member', 'interview', 'were', 'great', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'odd', 'band', 'members', 'then', 'are', 'younger', 'am', 'now', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'older', 'band', 'ahh', 'cut', 'Roundabout', 'not', 'great', 'answers', 'questions', 'regarding', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'final', 'version', 'film.So', 'final', 'vote', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Good', 'clean', 'cut', '80', 'several', 'well', 'done', 'cuts', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'solos', 'great', 'memories', 'better', 'MTV', 'years']",N/A

The stereo soundtrack is what has made the VHS so enjoyable to watch time and again over the years.Another big problem is that the 5.1 track is much too quiet when compared to the mono alternative - and that's just poor engineering on someone's part. I usually only adjust my PC surround system volume by using the PC's mixer, but for this DVD I had to manually crank up the master volume in order to get enough punch to feel impressed (and then remember to turn it back down to suit any other DVD with an average volume output).An A-B comparison shows that the video quality of the DVD is a distinct improvement on the VHS - and it is good to have the optional version without the Charlex Digital video effects. Somehow, though, I feel that they added a positive kitsch appeal (being state of the art at the time) - and the powerful performance of the band is what shines through in any event.The ""Starship Trooper"" finale is worth the purchase price on it's own - but has the best effect if you've travelled through the preceding tracks.All round though I'd suggest that owners of the HiFi stereo VHS might be better off doing a transfer to DVD-R and saving their pennies for some other Yes DVD offering.",3,Great Yes show - but  DVD has annoying audio shortfalls,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,1432,"['indeed', 'appalling', 'DVD', 'only', 'only', 'choice', 'rather', 'phony', 'sounding', '5.1', 'surround', 'really', 'unimpressive', '2.0', 'least', 'not', '1.0', 'mono', 'was', 'truly', 'superb', 'stereo', 'mix', 'original', 'HiFi', 'VHS', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'made', 'VHS', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'time', 'again', 'years.Another', 'big', 'problem', '5.1', 'track', 'much', 'too', 'quiet', 'when', 'compared', 'mono', 'alternative', 'just', 'poor', 'engineering', 'someone', 'part', 'usually', 'only', 'adjust', 'PC', 'surround', 'system', 'volume', 'using', 'PC', 'mixer', 'DVD', 'had', 'manually', 'crank', 'up', 'master', 'volume', 'order', 'get', 'enough', 'punch', 'feel', 'impressed', 'then', 'remember', 'turn', 'back', 'down', 'suit', 'other', 'DVD', 'average', 'volume', 'output', 'A-B', 'comparison', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'distinct', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'good', 'have', 'optional', 'version', 'Charlex', 'Digital', 'video', 'effects', 'Somehow', 'feel', 'added', 'positive', 'kitsch', 'appeal', 'being', 'state', 'art', 'time', 'powerful', 'performance', 'band', 'what', 'event.The', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'finale', 'purchase', 'price', 'own', 'best', 'effect', ""'ve"", 'travelled', 'preceding', 'tracks.All', 'round', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'owners', 'HiFi', 'stereo', 'VHS', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'doing', 'transfer', 'DVD-R', 'saving', 'pennies', 'other', 'Yes', 'DVD', 'offering']",N/A

877395,A1D1PJTFVNE4EH,B000777I8S,Michael A. Kepler,"[2, 2]","It goes without saying that this is a virtually priceless treasure for any true Yes fan as it is, to my knowledge, the only professional grade video/audio recording from this tour available. The inclusion of the documentary and interview footage makes this all the more valuable. Not to be overlooked is the companion CD ""9012Live The Solos"" (sold separately), which includes solo segments from this tour not included in this video, as well as better-quality reproductions of the same performances of ""Hold On"" and ""Changes"".The following technical complaints about the audio may seem redundant with other reviews, but I have endeavored to provide a little bit more detail and context to try to explain the nature of the problem, and speculate as to how it came to be this way.Just to clear up some possible misunderstanding: the ""5.1 mix"" or ""5.1 upmix"" is simply a stereo mix encoded as 5.1 with audio existing only in the front left and right channels, the four remaining channels containing only silence.  The other audio option is a mono mix encoded as dual stereo, with the same mix in both L and R channels.The ""5.1"" mix doesn't even split off the low end to the subwoofer channel, which would have been an easy thing to do in the reportedly ""careful"" remastering.  As a result, on some home theater systems which have poor low end response in the front mains, this may sound a bit lacking in bass, unless there is some feature in the system to split it off to the subwoofer for you.To make matters worse, the stereo mix is mastered at an extremely low volume level (unbalanced, with L channel peaks below -21db and R channel peaks below -24db), and since ac3 5.1 uses a ""lossy"" compression algorithm you are effectively getting only a fraction of the fidelity possible.  Cranking this up loud enough for enjoyable listening will amplify the inherent noise in every stage of your home theater system, as well as quantization noise and artifacts of the lossy compression inherent to the source encoding.Presumably, the low volume levels found here, as on many multi-channel encoded DVDs, is a hedge against possible clipping in playback situations where the equipment at hand performs a very simple summing of multiple channels when downmixing to stereo or mono.  Clearly, this was not as valid a concern when 4 out of 6 channels contain silence.  This leaves me to suspect that the engineer performing the ""upmix"" and mastering from the available stereo source was lacking in either tools or knowledge, or just didn't care enough to adjust anything from preset defaults.The dual mono ac3 audio track has the lone redeeming characteristic of being mastered at a higher volume level, making better use of the available headroom/resolution of the medium.  Too bad it's mono.I understand the limitations of working from the 2nd generation video master, but little ingenuity or care was expended on giving the available source the best possible presentation on this format.  By far, the best solution would have been to encode this as uncompressed linear stereo PCM, utilizing the full headroom available.  There would probably be ample space on a double-layer disc to include this audio format if the other two formats were excluded, as well as the completely unnecessary 2nd complete copy of the ""Charlex"" version which is inexplicably included on this disc (which I found using ""mplayer"", for a total of three complete copies of the concert on this one disc). As it is, the sound on my original VHS HiFi release (which is FM encoded stereo) is superior to this DVD.  Presumably, the original LD release had even better sound, but this is a very hard item to find.Even with all of these audio complaints, I am thankful that there was no attempt made to fake a full 5.1 mix from the stereo source.Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile purchase for the documentary and interview material alone, as well as the alternate cut, especially if you do not have an older copy on another format with better sound in good condition.Musically, this lineup was best when playing their own material, of course.  If only they had enough of their own material on this tour to fill out the set, as their renditions of ""classic"" yes songs are interesting curiosities, but come off as sub-standard ""cover"" versions, rather than authentic performances of the band.I wish there were a widely commercially available recording of the ""Union"" tour, as this was the only time when music from both major lineups were given true justice, and new life, in a single concert.  Even then, you would still treasure 9012Live for the great Rabin-era songs which were not performed on the Union tour.",4,"Great show, good DVD, poor audio mastering",1244332800,"06 7,

Although some Yes purists prefer Steve Howe to Trevor Rabin, I really liked Rabin -- he shows a lot more enthusiasm & enjoyment in his guitar playing than Howe and he plays all the older Yes numbers with great skill. When Howe plays, he seems very morose and he rarely ever smiles, even though he is a great musician.I really liked the ""Director's Cut"" because it features the entire live concert performance without the annoying visual effects, which really disrupted the flow with its nonsensical imagery of the 50's family in the living room and the other weird effects. My favorite songs that were performed on this DVD are the 90125 numbers, ""Owner of a Lonely Heart,"" ""It Can Happen,"" ""Changes,"" and ""Leave It"".  Trevor Rabin also does a commendable job on the Steve Howe Yes songs ""Roundabout"" (which he plays on electric guitar), ""I've Seen All Good People"" (which is done on a faster tempo than Howe's version) and ""Starship Trooper"". I wished the band could have played more classic Yes pieces.The bonus features include an interesting interview with the band members and the song ""Roundabout"". It is interesting that this DVD was made by Steven Soderbergh before his work on the big screen.  I deleted one star for this DVD because of the annoying visual effects which marred the feature film, and the mediocre sound quality of the DVD.

The original version has many images that more often than not completely hide the band. Some of it is clever but when something cool is happening, solos, the singer singing a good part, band interplay, basically the LIVE CONCERT, well then the original version simply has video images playing over the concert footage and all we hear is the show. This is not much like the 72 Rainbow Theater concert. The images here completely obliterate the show at times. The 72 show had images that were much friendlier. There is simply too much video montage crapola blocking the show in the original version. So, this disc was saved by the SECOND VERSION aka the Director's Cut, which simply shows the concert as it was played.The sound is a bit weak, but at the end of the director's cut we are informed how the original 24 track master tape was lost. So the audio is suppossed to be one generation down from pristine audio. The show is fairly decent but it really made me long for the REAL YES of OLD when they played brighter and happier songs. This lineup really couldn't play Roundabout or Starship Trooper. Trevor Rabin is a skilled guitarist but he is surely no Steve Howe. Steve is sorely missed on this show. And the band sometimes LIP syncs and difficult parts that could not be reproduced well in concert were simply dubbed. So one has to watch for when the guys are lip synching and when they are singing. The same goes for the playing. It's pretty obvious to all though, and the band doesn't really try to hide it. Some of the intros for the songs simply couldn't be done well at a live concert. But about 90% of the show, or more, is the band playing.I couldn't get over some of the outfits the guys wore. I liked Trevor's shirt. Jon had on some pastel outfit. The drummer had on some shiny stretch pants and one could easily see his formidable schlong in his pants as he drummed. Chris Squire looked ridiculous though with his long coat with what looked like veins and on one sleeve two kidneys??? Chris also had a faux hawk, or whatever you call that hairdo.This is a REINVENTED YES. The guys showed they were very brilliant and they could create strong music. The problem for me though is this music is much darker and gets much more tedious over time than the best early Yes cds. I can listen to Yessongs over and over. Sure, I get bored but it's a lot easier on my mind and this 90125 material which isn't even from one the classic early lineups.This album really got my attention when it came out. I thought it was great. But if I have to pick out a Yes album to play I'm going to pick out something from the early days before I fetch 90125.",4,Thanks for the Director's Cut version.,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,2712,"['are', 'two', 'versions', 'concert', 'available', 'viewers', 'original', 'version', 'many', 'images', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'completely', 'hide', 'band', 'clever', 'when', 'something', 'cool', 'happening', 'solos', 'singer', 'singing', 'good', 'part', 'band', 'interplay', 'basically', 'LIVE', 'CONCERT', 'well', 'then', 'original', 'version', 'simply', 'video', 'images', 'playing', 'concert', 'footage', 'hear', 'show', 'not', 'much', '72', 'Rainbow', 'Theater', 'concert', 'images', 'here', 'completely', 'obliterate', 'show', 'times', '72', 'show', 'had', 'images', 'were', 'much', 'friendlier', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'montage', 'crapola', 'blocking', 'show', 'original', 'version', 'So', 'disc', 'was', 'saved', 'SECOND', 'VERSION', 'Director', 'Cut', 'simply', 'concert', 'was', 'played.The', 'sound', 'bit', 'weak', 'end', 'director', 'cut', 'are', 'informed', 'how', 'original', '24', 'track', 'master', 'tape', 'was', 'lost', 'audio', 'suppossed', 'be', 'one', 'generation', 'pristine', 'audio', 'show', 'fairly', 'decent', 'really', 'made', 'long', 'REAL', 'YES', 'OLD', 'when', 'played', 'brighter', 'happier', 'songs', 'lineup', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'Roundabout', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'skilled', 'guitarist', 'surely', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Steve', 'sorely', 'missed', 'show', 'band', 'sometimes', 'LIP', 'syncs', 'difficult', 'parts', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'reproduced', 'well', 'concert', 'were', 'simply', 'dubbed', 'So', 'one', 'watch', 'when', 'guys', 'are', 'lip', 'synching', 'when', 'are', 'singing', 'same', 'playing', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'band', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'hide', 'intros', 'songs', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'well', 'live', 'concert', '90', '%', 'show', 'more', 'band', 'playing.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'outfits', 'guys', 'wore', 'liked', 'Trevor', 'shirt', 'Jon', 'had', 'pastel', 'outfit', 'drummer', 'had', 'shiny', 'stretch', 'pants', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'formidable', 'schlong', 'pants', 'drummed', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'long', 'coat', 'what', 'looked', 'like', 'veins', 'one', 'sleeve', 'two', 'kidneys', 'Chris', 'also', 'had', 'faux', 'hawk', 'call', 'hairdo.This', 'REINVENTED', 'YES', 'guys', 'showed', 'were', 'very', 'brilliant', 'could', 'create', 'strong', 'music', 'problem', 'music', 'much', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'tedious', 'time', 'best', 'early', 'Yes', 'cds', 'can', 'listen', 'Yessongs', 'Sure', 'get', 'bored', 'lot', 'easier', 'mind', '90125', 'material', ""n't"", 'even', 'one', 'classic', 'early', 'lineups.This', 'album', 'really', 'got', 'attention', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'pick', 'out', 'Yes', 'album', 'play', ""'m"", 'going', 'pick', 'out', 'something', 'early', 'days', 'fetch', '90125']",N/A

But it was my introduction to the group at the age of 10 and in hindsight, the elder Yes is far and away the best, but when I purchased this on DVD last fall, I was reminded of how exceptionally good the 90125 era was and Trevor Rabin, obviously, was the man whom was the central figure in the resurgence of them returning to the musical spotlight. Jon Anderson comes along to provide the essential voice of Yes and Tony Kaye returned to the unit to give this reunion a bit of relevancy as well as a renewed sense of musical contribution with newer technologies in electronic keyboard nuances from his earliest days of being the Hammond rocker. Squire and White, as ever, are the rock of foundation for the group and within this combination of players involved, gave the group a renewed sense of purpose as well as having a chance to succeed commercially in a way the Yes of old was somewhat limited to achieve.I recall seeing this on MTV years ago and thoroughly enjoyed what was offered, which consists primarily of the strongest tracks on the then current 90125 release. Older tracks like Starship Trooper and I've Seen All Good People make their appearance and although, as previously mentioned, sometimes the guitar parts Rabin chooses to implement within the songs' performances make me want to hear Steve Howe playing them, its notable that Rabin chose to put his own collective stamp on these early Yes nuggets. My favorite tracks featured are Hold On which is a breathtakingly melodic and powerfully charged number that features heavenly harmonies, impeccable musicianship and the group really ROCKS on this number specifically. Changes is another favorite with its tricky 7/8 time signature intro while later plowing headfirst into a heavier rock with familiar progressive tendencies. Leave it, It Can Happen and of course, Owner of a Lonley Heart are equally as profound and noteworthy within the updated new sound of the band, adding ever more depth and quality to its musical landscape. In the special features section, you have the option of playing the full concert without the interspersing video cuts by the director, which I prefer, and its nice that Roundabout is also included as a bonus track, too.",4,80's Yes captured Alive and Well,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,2264,"[""n't"", 'father', 'Yes', 'know', 'was', 'introduction', 'group', 'age', '10', 'hindsight', 'elder', 'Yes', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'when', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'last', 'fall', 'was', 'reminded', 'how', 'exceptionally', 'good', '90125', 'era', 'was', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'obviously', 'was', 'man', 'whom', 'was', 'central', 'figure', 'resurgence', 'returning', 'musical', 'spotlight', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'along', 'provide', 'essential', 'voice', 'Yes', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'returned', 'unit', 'give', 'reunion', 'bit', 'relevancy', 'as', 'well', 'renewed', 'sense', 'musical', 'contribution', 'newer', 'technologies', 'electronic', 'keyboard', 'nuances', 'earliest', 'days', 'being', 'Hammond', 'rocker', 'Squire', 'White', 'ever', 'are', 'rock', 'foundation', 'group', 'combination', 'players', 'involved', 'gave', 'group', 'renewed', 'sense', 'purpose', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'chance', 'succeed', 'commercially', 'way', 'Yes', 'old', 'was', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'achieve.I', 'recall', 'seeing', 'MTV', 'years', 'ago', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'offered', 'primarily', 'strongest', 'tracks', 'then', 'current', '90125', 'release', 'Older', 'tracks', 'Starship', 'Trooper', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'All', 'Good', 'People', 'make', 'appearance', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'sometimes', 'guitar', 'parts', 'Rabin', 'implement', 'songs', 'performances', 'make', 'want', 'hear', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'playing', 'notable', 'Rabin', 'chose', 'put', 'own', 'collective', 'stamp', 'early', 'Yes', 'nuggets', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'featured', 'are', 'Hold', 'breathtakingly', 'melodic', 'powerfully', 'charged', 'number', 'heavenly', 'harmonies', 'impeccable', 'musicianship', 'group', 'really', 'ROCKS', 'number', 'specifically', 'Changes', 'favorite', 'tricky', '7/8', 'time', 'signature', 'intro', 'later', 'plowing', 'headfirst', 'heavier', 'rock', 'familiar', 'progressive', 'tendencies', 'Leave', 'Can', 'Happen', 'course', 'Owner', 'Lonley', 'Heart', 'are', 'equally', 'profound', 'noteworthy', 'updated', 'new', 'sound', 'band', 'adding', 'ever', 'more', 'depth', 'quality', 'musical', 'landscape', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'have', 'option', 'playing', 'full', 'concert', 'interspersing', 'video', 'cuts', 'director', 'prefer', 'nice', 'Roundabout', 'also', 'included', 'bonus', 'track', 'too']",N/A

There were a number of legal reasons Yes had a difficult time getting this released.  Plus, they wanted to get original director Steven Soderberg involved (no easy task).  Well, we can all rejoice because this has all fallen into place, and ""Yes 9012-LIVE"" is finally on dvd, in a fabulous new version.  According to yesworld.com, here's the skinny on the new dvd:- Special director's cut of the film (non-chalex: no visual effects)- Bonus track: ""Roundabout"" (Cut from the original film)- ""Access All Areas"" documentary: Photographed, Directed and Edited by Steven Soderbergh- Band Interviews: Directed by John B. HouseSo, there you have it.  For all of you who spent way too much on the unofficial release, it's time to upgrade.  For everyone else, you can rejoice because a great concert video is finally available once again. The downside is the short length.  The original film was just barely over an hour (barely half of the set from that tour).  So, this is really mostly a highlights of the 90125 album, with a few classic tracks (All Good People, Startship Trooper and now Roundabout) thrown in.
