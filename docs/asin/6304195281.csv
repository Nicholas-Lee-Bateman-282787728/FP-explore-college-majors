Liv Tyler is, of course, gorgeous and mesmorizing. The Italian and British actors that flank her almost eclipse her, but as her debut film, she does truly shine.There are several scenes that are physically intriguing, but I most enjoyed the entire &quot;party&quot; sequence.... some odd, yet stunning filming.Let's face it, everyone in this film is beautiful to look at (even  Jeremy Irons as a dying man). You begin to lose interest in Lucy's (Tyler) quest at some point, but once the answer is revealed it is  still somewhat satisfying.I can highly reccommend this film to anyone that is into gorgeous scenery, lovely and easy story lines, and has and eye for the pleasing aesthetic so many films lack these days.

406500,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304195281,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 8]","Bernardo Bertolucci is one of those directors you either love or hate.  He can easily rub someone the wrong way with his exploitation and ceaseless explicit content, but when one understands the message behind Bertolucci's apparent sensual frustrations he can be appreciated for much more than he is usually regarded as.  His films are not mere `skin flicks' as some have felt the need to wrongfully accuse them of being.  In fact, some of his films are sheer masterpieces (`Last Tango in Paris' is above and beyond one of the best films ever made) and even those that fall somewhat short of his intellectual reaching (`The Dreamers' was close but yet so far from his potential) are still much more than meets the eye.  `Stealing Beauty' is one of his weaker films, for it doesn't have the emotional or even the political depth of his other work, but it still manages to carry itself rather well and touches upon much more than bare skin.The story is a coming of age tale that revolves around a nineteen year old virgin named Lucy.  After her mother's suicide, Lucy travels to Italy to visit friends of her mothers.  Her mother had journeyed to this artistic retreat twenty years prior and had become pregnant with Lucy, so Lucy's agenda in visiting is to find her real father; and lose her virginity.  There are many different individuals whom she meets and forms friendships with, including Ian, the serious sculptor who is intrigued by Lucy's innocence, as well as Alex, the dying guest who stimulates Lucy intellectually.And then there are a slew of young Italian boys who find her just utterly delicious.While the film centers itself on Lucy's libido and her desire to lose that prized possession known as her virginity (why are we so quick to give away something so precious) it isn't merely about that act.  While staying at this home Lucy is given a glimpse a life very far removed from her own; a life of carefree passions and removed from all scrutiny.  There are scenes where characters parade about in the nude; no one reluctant but everyone comfortable and content.  It appears shocking to some and maybe even repulsive, but the truth of the matter is that Bertolucci is trying to show the contrasting variables of self contentment.  As an American culture we are often guarded, as if we are afraid to expose ourselves to others.  The fact that everyone at this house is that open, even the unfit and or older ones, shows that there is a level of self respect and love that is not found in a lot of individuals today.The acting is all pretty well done, with only a few missteps.  Sinead Cusack and Rachel Weisz stand out amidst all the pretty faces as two very talented and very moving actresses.  Liv Tyler is gorgeous and has a sense of restraint needed to carry her character, but she does at times get lost in the scenes.  A lot has been said over Jeremy Irons performance, but personally I didn't find him nearly as moving as the late Donal McCann who handled Ian with such fervor.  He really understood how to embody his character with the right amount of smoldering sensuality that made him utterly irresistible.  His eyes were just downright piercing.This is no where near as deeply investing as `Last Tango in Paris', but it is much more than some reviewers have made it sound.  This is not a `boring film only good for a shot of Tyler's goods' but a sensible and honest portrait of a young girl finding herself amidst people who truly understand what it means to be free.",4,"A little bare, but nothing short of beautiful...",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3494,"['Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'one', 'directors', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'can', 'easily', 'rub', 'someone', 'wrong', 'way', 'exploitation', 'ceaseless', 'explicit', 'content', 'when', 'one', 'message', 'Bertolucci', 'apparent', 'sensual', 'frustrations', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'much', 'more', 'usually', 'regarded', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'mere', 'skin', 'flicks', 'have', 'felt', 'need', 'wrongfully', 'accuse', 'being', 'fact', 'films', 'are', 'sheer', 'masterpieces', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'fall', 'somewhat', 'short', 'intellectual', 'reaching', 'Dreamers', 'was', 'close', 'yet', 'so', 'far', 'potential', 'are', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'one', 'weaker', 'films', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'even', 'political', 'depth', 'other', 'work', 'still', 'carry', 'rather', 'well', 'upon', 'much', 'more', 'bare', 'skin.The', 'story', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'nineteen', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'named', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'suicide', 'Lucy', 'Italy', 'visit', 'friends', 'mothers', 'mother', 'had', 'journeyed', 'artistic', 'retreat', 'twenty', 'years', 'prior', 'had', 'become', 'pregnant', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'agenda', 'visiting', 'find', 'real', 'father', 'lose', 'virginity', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'individuals', 'whom', 'forms', 'friendships', 'including', 'Ian', 'serious', 'sculptor', 'who', 'intrigued', 'Lucy', 'innocence', 'as', 'well', 'Alex', 'dying', 'guest', 'who', 'Lucy', 'intellectually.And', 'then', 'are', 'slew', 'young', 'Italian', 'boys', 'who', 'find', 'just', 'utterly', 'delicious.While', 'film', 'centers', 'Lucy', 'libido', 'desire', 'lose', 'prized', 'possession', 'known', 'virginity', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'quick', 'give', 'away', 'something', 'so', 'precious', ""n't"", 'merely', 'act', 'staying', 'home', 'Lucy', 'given', 'glimpse', 'life', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'life', 'carefree', 'passions', 'removed', 'scrutiny', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'parade', 'nude', 'one', 'reluctant', 'everyone', 'comfortable', 'content', 'shocking', 'maybe', 'even', 'repulsive', 'truth', 'matter', 'Bertolucci', 'trying', 'show', 'contrasting', 'variables', 'self', 'contentment', 'American', 'culture', 'are', 'often', 'guarded', 'are', 'afraid', 'expose', 'ourselves', 'others', 'fact', 'everyone', 'house', 'open', 'even', 'unfit', 'older', 'ones', 'level', 'self', 'respect', 'love', 'not', 'found', 'lot', 'individuals', 'today.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'few', 'missteps', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'stand', 'out', 'amidst', 'pretty', 'as', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'very', 'moving', 'actresses', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'gorgeous', 'sense', 'restraint', 'needed', 'carry', 'character', 'times', 'get', 'lost', 'scenes', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'performance', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'nearly', 'as', 'moving', 'late', 'Donal', 'McCann', 'who', 'handled', 'Ian', 'such', 'fervor', 'really', 'understood', 'how', 'embody', 'character', 'right', 'amount', 'smoldering', 'sensuality', 'made', 'utterly', 'irresistible', 'eyes', 'were', 'just', 'downright', 'piercing.This', 'where', 'near', 'deeply', 'investing', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'much', 'more', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'sound', 'not', 'boring', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'shot', 'Tyler', 'goods', 'sensible', 'honest', 'portrait', 'young', 'girl', 'finding', 'amidst', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'be', 'free']",Stealing Beauty VHS

No matter how beautiful you are you still have problems and are in need just like men. I like it because that is the side of women we never see..they are so cool, ya know? But this film shows a beautiful woman that wants to have sex badly but just can't find that right guy! And when you look at her you are like man ? I wish I could help out so bad! But anyway, it is beautifully filmed and the setting is beautiful. It makes you feel like you are actually visiting that country. I am not hot on slow movies unless they are weird or mind stretching, but this one is really interesting to watch. Expecially to see a beautiful woman for once struggling with passion and sex!And it has some comic relief in it as well! The tactic's that some of those men used to try to get her in bed, was completley Uproarious! Liv Tyler pertrays such a virginal and Innocent performance. There isn't any huge nudity parts in this film, she only shows her upper torso. But anyway I love this movie alot every sense I rented it I have missed looking at it. Which means this title will be purchased very shortly!The party scene was so beautiful, to see the dance culture and the various personalities at the event. This is definitley a atmosphere movie just as ""Under the Cherry Moon was which was filmed in France. Definitley if you are a cultural person and you like eye candy this is the film to get.

I think after he left his Marxist principles and communist leanings, his films sunk to a new time low. Take for example, &#34;Stealing Beauty&#34;, this must be the most pretentious and bloated of his works.This film is almost unbearable to watch, it is dreadfully painful even. The characters are nothing but a bunch of spoiled, irreverent, upper middle class pseudo-intellectuals and artists who live out in an Italian country side. Liv Tyler plays Lucy, a sheepish, spoiled teen who wants to lose her virginity as if brushing her teeth. The problem is that Tyler can't act, nor can she pass off as an incredulous youth. She simply is annoying to the point of our exhaustion with her.One thing good to say about this ostentatiousness is the film cinematography and color which is in contrast to the dull and ridiculous story, and the revolting acting. In every role Jeremy Irons is in, he castigates us with his foreboding and absurdly patrician methods.

406507,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304195281,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[7, 7]","Stealing Beauty is about Lucy Harmon (Liv Tyler), who goes to Italy to have her portrait done. Actually, a sculpture carved in wood with a chain saw. Do we ever see it? I don't think we ever do, but by then it isn't really so important. The portrait is the film, a portrait of a beautiful but awkward young woman, and the writers, artists, and Italians who come to this beautiful Italian villa for various reasons.Lucy has other reasons for coming here besides sculpture, too. Her mother, Sara Harmon, was a poet who committed suicide. From her mothers notebooks she infers that she may have been conceived here, in an olive grove atop a hill. She wants to find out who her real father is, and the likely candidates are all here as well. Not only does she want to find out who her father is, she would also like to lose her virginity, hoping for the right person and a suitable beautiful setting.It is a beautiful setting, but for some, like English playwright Alex (Jeremy Irons) who is aged and infirm, there is little to do but gossip. Others have affairs of their own to occupy them, but they are not immune to gossip either, and Lucy's virginity becomes a subject of intense interest.Director Bernardo Bertolucci began as a poet, worked for Pier Paolo Pasolini as assistant director, and switched from poetry to films, but approaching film more as poetry. His best film is The Last Tango in Paris (1972), but The Last Emperor (1987) walked away with nine Academy Awards. Stealing Beauty is not up to that caliber, but it isn't as bad as you think it is going to be when you first see Liv.She seems like a dork, and all the men seem like lecherous creeps, especially Irons. You are expecting a big train wreck, that Liv Tyler, as beautiful as she is, won't be able to act, and Bertolucci will be arrested for stealing beauty.For instance, her poetry:The three poems we see Lucy (Liv Tyler) compose while in Italy are:1. I have her secret deep within for years I've had to hide I've bought the clues And now I'm hoping To bring the truth outside2. I wait I wait so patiently I'm as quiet as a cup I hope you'll come and rattle me Quick! Come wake me up.3. The dye is cast The dice are rolled I feel like **** you look like gold.For someone who is supposed to be the daughter of a poet, and a character in a film by a director who began as a poet, this is not very impressive. However, Lucy just seems to express herself that way, and it comes natural to her. She doesn't expect to win the Wurlitzer prize for it, she just tears it out of the newspaper she scribbled it on and uses it for a bookmark.Anyway, Liv Tyler ends up doing a pretty good job of acting in spite of her inexperience, dyslexia, and lack of training. Perhaps she had life experience to draw from. The daughter of Bebe Buell and Steve Tyler, she grew up thinking that Todd Rundgren was her father. Seeing that Tyler's daughter Mia could be her twin, she figured out the puzzle, and had her last name changed to Tyler by age 12.So, while not Bertolucci's best work, Stealing Beauty is not nearly as bad as Ithought it would be. Alex ends up being not such a bad guy after all, and there are plenty of lecherous creeps, and some that are just plain lecherous, but there are also some decent male characters. Not to mention the female characters, besides Liv. Add all that to the beautiful settings, and I was able to steal a bit of beauty from this movie myself.FILMS DIRECTED BY BERTOLUCCIBernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor : Director's Cut [Import, All-region] (Dvd)(1987)Last Tango in Paris(1972)FILMS AND ROLES OF JEREMY IRONSLolita(1997) ....

406508,A2J7B7F2J7V4DM,6304195281,Chosroes III,"[3, 4]","Often this or that work is referred to as ""transitional"" but with ""Stealing Beauty"" this term actually applies.  Moving from the somber, epic melancholy of his Eastern Trilogy films, Bertolucci here breaks off his collaboration with world's greatest cinematographer Vittorio Storraro and begins the reinvention of his cinematic style that would soon find flower in his latest masterpiece ""Besieged"".  With ""Stealing Beauty"" he is first exploring his new, romantic and youthful mood and deconstructing the lilting, adagio-like crane shots that have represented the full glory of his style.  This film never attains the speed and light of ""Besieged"" but you can see the beginnings of it at far-flung moments, like with the montage that is spun from Lucy's notebook and the Tuscan countryside.  For a film whose watchwords were supposedly ""Jean Renoir"" and ""Mozart"", ""Stealing Beauty"" never quite finds the lightness of touch that it seeks (and the alternative music dates the film badly-- even at the time of release it felt a bit incongruous, as though the Old Master were trying on glad rags, a bit like Godard turning Botticelli's Venus into a rollerskateing babe).  But never mind-- Bertolucci on a slouching day beats even some legendary directors at their best.  ""Stealing Beauty"" is graced with gorgeously deep greens and browns, courtesy of the gifted, though in other movies sometimes misguided, Darius Khondji.  Liv Tyler does everything the role of Lucy requires of her-- and no, she doesn't just have to pout and look pretty. Jereme Irons broods with the expected finesse, and Jean Marais scene-steals terrifically. Rachel Weisz earns her place in the Bertolucci Hall of Fame for nude actresses with her scene as an enticing poolside odalisque. The film, if shaky at times, manages to persuade us of Lucy's idealism and the inspiring quality of her beauty.  This is richly apparent in the dreamy sequence where Donal McCann gets her to bare a breast-- admire the interplay of the other characters, Daisy feeling left out and beating a tree, Richard acting predictably aroused beyond belief, etc.  This languor is ultimately the film's strength.  The characters may sometimes be too narrow to be likeable, but the mood lifts them above themselves.  As for Bertolucci, he may be a bit uncomfortable being too sweet and innocent: there's a fine moment late in the film where a woman takes it upon herself to show Lucy what the 'Marquis de Sade' character REALLY likes that feels as though the earthy Bertolucci of the '70s decided to push in and add some perversity to the proceedings.  But it's nice of him to go with Lucy on her journey of awakening (as though I even need mention what the film is ""about""!) and, though for him a ""minor"" work, ""Stealing Beauty"" can be chalked up as some kind of classic.",4,The Maestro at play,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,2813,"['Often', 'work', 'referred', 'transitional', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'term', 'actually', 'Moving', 'somber', 'epic', 'melancholy', 'Eastern', 'Trilogy', 'films', 'Bertolucci', 'here', 'collaboration', 'world', 'greatest', 'cinematographer', 'Vittorio', 'Storraro', 'reinvention', 'cinematic', 'style', 'would', 'soon', 'find', 'flower', 'latest', 'masterpiece', 'Besieged', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'first', 'exploring', 'new', 'romantic', 'youthful', 'mood', 'deconstructing', 'lilting', 'adagio-like', 'crane', 'shots', 'have', 'represented', 'full', 'glory', 'style', 'film', 'never', 'speed', 'light', 'Besieged', 'can', 'see', 'beginnings', 'far-flung', 'moments', 'montage', 'spun', 'Lucy', 'notebook', 'Tuscan', 'countryside', 'film', 'watchwords', 'were', 'supposedly', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'Mozart', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'never', 'quite', 'lightness', 'touch', 'alternative', 'music', 'film', 'badly', 'even', 'time', 'release', 'felt', 'bit', 'incongruous', 'Old', 'Master', 'were', 'trying', 'glad', 'rags', 'bit', 'Godard', 'turning', 'Botticelli', 'Venus', 'rollerskateing', 'babe', 'never', 'mind', 'Bertolucci', 'slouching', 'day', 'beats', 'even', 'legendary', 'directors', 'best', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'graced', 'gorgeously', 'deep', 'greens', 'browns', 'courtesy', 'gifted', 'though', 'other', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'misguided', 'Darius', 'Khondji', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'everything', 'role', 'Lucy', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'pout', 'look', 'pretty', 'Jereme', 'Irons', 'broods', 'expected', 'finesse', 'Jean', 'Marais', 'scene-steals', 'terrifically', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'place', 'Bertolucci', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'nude', 'actresses', 'scene', 'enticing', 'poolside', 'odalisque', 'film', 'shaky', 'times', 'persuade', 'Lucy', 'idealism', 'inspiring', 'quality', 'beauty', 'richly', 'apparent', 'dreamy', 'sequence', 'where', 'Donal', 'McCann', 'bare', 'breast', 'admire', 'interplay', 'other', 'characters', 'Daisy', 'feeling', 'left', 'out', 'beating', 'tree', 'Richard', 'acting', 'predictably', 'aroused', 'belief', 'etc', 'languor', 'ultimately', 'film', 'strength', 'characters', 'may', 'sometimes', 'be', 'too', 'narrow', 'be', 'likeable', 'mood', 'Bertolucci', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'being', 'too', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'fine', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'woman', 'show', 'Lucy', 'what', ""'Marquis"", 'de', 'Sade', 'character', 'REALLY', 'earthy', 'Bertolucci', ""'70s"", 'decided', 'push', 'add', 'perversity', 'proceedings', 'nice', 'go', 'Lucy', 'journey', 'awakening', 'even', 'need', 'mention', 'what', 'film', 'though', 'minor', 'work', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'kind', 'classic']",Stealing Beauty VHS

So how does it only rate 2 stars?Most of the characters in this show are caricatures of old lost prejudices about Italians. It shows the Italian people in the same way a fake French accent is used to indicate Marcel Marceau. If a director wants to show drug use shouldn't he make it as real as the AIDS issue he has included? Their reaction to grass was as if they got it from their lawn clippings or a Kansas ditch.The storyline after the great AIDS relationship is simply locate her unknown father & deal with her virginity issue. Both themes have been done far better many times before. The esteemed director seems to have gone to seed on the thought that if he uses beautiful sets & quirky characters he has fulfilled his job. This movie looks like it was put out by a mill.It is only the efforts of a great cast Cusack, Fiennes, Irons, Weisz, Sorgani, Cecci, Marais & Liv Tyler that gets this a 2 star rating.

In fact, I don't think it would be going too far to call it Bernardo Bertolucci's best movie.The film centers around an American girl (Liv Tyler) who travels over to Italy to visit her relatives.  While there, she gains the friendship of an older writer (Jeremy Irons) who is dying of cancer.  Tyler exudes a youthful, natural and yet mysterious beauty which complements Irons' masculine, distinguished screen-presence quite nicely.  In many sequences, Tyler is photographed so elegantly that she appears to be a model for one of Boticelli's paintings.Juxtaposed with this bonding is the desire for Tyler's character to lose her virginity.  In this rite-of-passage, her dying friend becomes her mentor.  They both want it to be ""special,"" but she is also tempted to just ""do it"" with the efficacy of becoming a complete woman.As the cover of the DVD shows Liv Tyler nude, a lot of guys are probably wondering if this is a movie in which she actually bares anything.  The answer is......yes!  There are a few brief scenes in which she is topless.  To my knowledge, this is the only film in which she appears nude.Filmed on the sun-drenched verdant rolling green countryside of Italy, the movie is colorfully illustrated by vibrant contrasts of red and green.  The cinematography goes a long way towards giving the story a distinctly Italian flavor.So, if you're Italian, like Italian stuff, enjoy aesthetically pleasing films, admire Jeremy Irons or have a crush on Liv Tyler, this movie is for you.  If none of these things appeal to you, this probably is not a DVD for you.",5,Italian beauty,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,1638,"['artistically', 'well-done', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'call', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'best', 'movie.The', 'film', 'centers', 'American', 'girl', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', 'Italy', 'visit', 'relatives', 'there', 'gains', 'friendship', 'older', 'writer', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Tyler', 'youthful', 'natural', 'yet', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'Irons', 'masculine', 'distinguished', 'screen-presence', 'quite', 'nicely', 'many', 'sequences', 'Tyler', 'photographed', 'so', 'elegantly', 'be', 'model', 'one', 'Boticelli', 'paintings.Juxtaposed', 'bonding', 'desire', 'Tyler', 'character', 'lose', 'virginity', 'rite-of-passage', 'dying', 'friend', 'mentor', 'want', 'be', 'special', 'also', 'tempted', 'just', 'do', 'efficacy', 'becoming', 'complete', 'woman.As', 'cover', 'DVD', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'nude', 'lot', 'guys', 'are', 'probably', 'wondering', 'movie', 'actually', 'anything', 'answer', 'yes', 'are', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'topless', 'knowledge', 'only', 'film', 'nude.Filmed', 'sun-drenched', 'verdant', 'rolling', 'green', 'countryside', 'Italy', 'movie', 'colorfully', 'illustrated', 'vibrant', 'contrasts', 'red', 'green', 'cinematography', 'long', 'way', 'giving', 'story', 'distinctly', 'Italian', 'flavor.So', ""'re"", 'Italian', 'Italian', 'stuff', 'enjoy', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'films', 'admire', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'have', 'crush', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'movie', 'none', 'things', 'appeal', 'probably', 'not', 'DVD']",Stealing Beauty VHS

While a passable actress, she just doesn't have much going for her other than nice hair, pouty lips, and flawless skin; her eyes are kind of vacuous and bland for the most part, and there's no primal sexual energy underneath...of course she's playing a 19 year old virgin for most of the film so I suppose that was Bertolucci's intent.  Still, she's the kind of demure, quiescent type which just puts you to sleep even if she does look pretty from a distance and simply does not generate much gut-level desire.Visually, this is indeed a beautiful film, like watching a series of postcards for two hours.  The pacing is very Europeanish-slow of course, and some of the characters rather two-dimensional and predictable.  Lots of artsy fartsy pretentiousness too, which can get a bit tiring, and at times bordered on outright cheesiness.  Some of the cross-cultural bits, like the scene where we are subjected to Liv Tyler bounce and gyrate in her bedroom with her headphones blaring some thrash-type tune, were especially hard to stomach.I was much relieved when it was finally over, frankly.

406515,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,6304195281,"""eurotrashgirl""","[13, 16]","In this 1996 film, Liv Tyler makes her stunning debut. Set to a soundtrack that is a good  mix of quintessentially '90's music (a la Portishead and Liz Phair) and retro classics (like &quot;My Baby Just Cares For Me&quot;  and &quot;I'll Be Seeing You,&quot;), this film takes both Liv's character,  Lucy, as well as the viewer, on a journey into mystery and enchantment.  Lucy embarks on her journey to Italy after the death of her mother, a  famous poet and artist. She travels there in search of greater knowledge  about her mother, who spent a brief few weeks there one summer. But what  Lucy really uncovers in Tuscany are the answers to secrets in her past.  And, as the film goes on, she discovers more and more about herself, and  the woman she is to become. This film is a great, slowly paced meditation  on sex, love, art and self-awareness. When Lucy finds out that she was  &quot;conceived&quot; in the olive groves of the artists' villa there, her  curiosity deepens and the search for her birth father becomes one of the  main goals in her journey. Faced with the loss of a future with her mother,  Lucy is looking towards the past for information about those she loves, for  knowledge about herself and where she came from, and for hints about where  this might lead her as she takes on the life of an adult.The film begins  with shots of Lucy sleeping on the train on her way to Tuscany. There is  even one devilish strategic close-up shot of her jeans which is perhaps  explained later in the film when it is revealed in a comical exchange  between Lucy and Jeremy Irons' character that the beautiful 19 year old  Lucy is a virgin. Unbeknownst to Lucy, she was being taped on her journey  by a fellow passenger on the train. But he gives her &quot;beauty&quot;  back to her in the form of the videotape. Her fate is still in her hands.  From there, the film follows several slow, melodic plot lines, one of which  is the attempt to find the perfect first sexual partner for the young and  much-loved Lucy.Liv plays a perfect beauty here. She is innocent,  touching, bright, curious, and passionate, and as the film goes on, she  takes a cue from the artists at the villa and becomes and more free in her  expression, more comfortable in her own skin. But she is also careful. She  wants her passion to be shared with someone worthy of it, someone who gives  as well as takes. It takes a while for her to find out who that perfect  catch is, but as in life, the story is what happens while she is  waiting  for the &quot;pay-off.&quot;Her curious habit of striking a match to  each finished poem and burning it up seems to say that she is not yet  confident in her artistic abilities, that she wants to keep some things  sacred, private. She is cautiously awaiting sharing herself on a deeper  level with those whom she grows to love.Jeremy Irons' character, a man  struck by illness in the most beautiful of places, is a nice offset to the  virginal beauty of Tyler. Together, they bring the film full circle from  youth and glowing health to the natural course of death and dying. The  attention they pay to one another is mutual. Lucy in this way is wise as  well as youthful.The countryside in this film is magical. The vineyards  of Tuscany, with the glowing sun above, are lovingly captured by  Bertolucci. The film is as much an ode to youth and innocence, and the  inevitable loss of it (which I think Bertolucci is saying can also be  beautiful) as it is to the Italian countryside.Others in the film who  have gone on to receive wide acclaim and appear in such movies as  Shakespeare in Love, Elizabeth, Swept From the Sea, and The Mummy are the  two British actors Joseph Fiennes and Rachael Weisz.",4,A Beautiful Vacation,960336000,"06 7, 2000",2000,3725,"['1996', 'film', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'stunning', 'debut', 'Set', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'mix', 'quintessentially', 'music', 'la', 'Portishead', 'Liz', 'Phair', 'retro', 'classics', 'quot', 'My', 'Baby', 'Just', 'Cares', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Seeing', 'quot', 'film', 'Liv', 'character', 'Lucy', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'journey', 'mystery', 'enchantment', 'Lucy', 'journey', 'Italy', 'death', 'mother', 'famous', 'poet', 'artist', 'there', 'search', 'greater', 'knowledge', 'mother', 'who', 'spent', 'brief', 'few', 'weeks', 'there', 'one', 'summer', 'what', 'Lucy', 'really', 'uncovers', 'Tuscany', 'are', 'answers', 'secrets', 'past', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'woman', 'become', 'film', 'great', 'slowly', 'paced', 'meditation', 'sex', 'love', 'art', 'self-awareness', 'When', 'Lucy', 'out', 'was', 'quot', 'conceived', 'quot', 'olive', 'groves', 'artists', 'villa', 'there', 'curiosity', 'deepens', 'search', 'birth', 'father', 'one', 'main', 'goals', 'journey', 'Faced', 'loss', 'future', 'mother', 'Lucy', 'looking', 'past', 'information', 'knowledge', 'herself', 'where', 'came', 'hints', 'where', 'might', 'lead', 'life', 'adult.The', 'film', 'shots', 'Lucy', 'sleeping', 'train', 'way', 'Tuscany', 'even', 'one', 'devilish', 'strategic', 'close-up', 'shot', 'jeans', 'perhaps', 'explained', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'revealed', 'comical', 'exchange', 'Lucy', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'beautiful', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Lucy', 'virgin', 'Unbeknownst', 'Lucy', 'was', 'being', 'taped', 'journey', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'train', 'quot', 'beauty', 'quot', 'back', 'form', 'videotape', 'fate', 'still', 'hands', 'there', 'film', 'several', 'slow', 'melodic', 'plot', 'lines', 'one', 'attempt', 'find', 'perfect', 'first', 'sexual', 'partner', 'young', 'much-loved', 'Lucy.Liv', 'perfect', 'beauty', 'here', 'innocent', 'touching', 'bright', 'curious', 'passionate', 'film', 'cue', 'artists', 'villa', 'becomes', 'more', 'free', 'expression', 'more', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'also', 'careful', 'passion', 'be', 'shared', 'someone', 'worthy', 'someone', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'while', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'perfect', 'catch', 'life', 'story', 'what', 'waiting', 'quot', 'pay-off.', 'quot', 'curious', 'habit', 'striking', 'match', 'finished', 'poem', 'burning', 'up', 'say', 'not', 'yet', 'confident', 'artistic', 'abilities', 'keep', 'things', 'sacred', 'private', 'cautiously', 'awaiting', 'sharing', 'deeper', 'level', 'whom', 'love.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'man', 'struck', 'illness', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'nice', 'offset', 'virginal', 'beauty', 'Tyler', 'Together', 'bring', 'film', 'full', 'circle', 'youth', 'glowing', 'health', 'natural', 'course', 'death', 'dying', 'attention', 'pay', 'one', 'mutual', 'Lucy', 'way', 'wise', 'as', 'well', 'youthful.The', 'countryside', 'film', 'magical', 'vineyards', 'Tuscany', 'glowing', 'sun', 'are', 'lovingly', 'captured', 'Bertolucci', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'ode', 'youth', 'innocence', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'think', 'Bertolucci', 'saying', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'countryside.Others', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'receive', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'appear', 'such', 'movies', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Elizabeth', 'Swept', 'Sea', 'Mummy', 'are', 'two', 'British', 'actors', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Rachael', 'Weisz']",Stealing Beauty VHS

406518,A2BPDFR58H9575,6304195281,Galina,"[1, 2]","I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie ""Stealing Beauty"" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called ""apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama."" I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them.I rewatched the film recently and I loved it even more than  first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness.This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany.Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word.  Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, ""Enchanting April"" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies  have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and  unabashedly romantic.Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity.  She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it.Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. ""Stealing Beauty"" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.",5,Summer in Tuscany.,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,3121,"['loved', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'movie', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', '1996', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'almost', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'how', 'surprised', 'was', 'rather', 'mixed', 'lukewarm', 'reactions', 'famous', 'respectable', 'critics', 'Many', 'accused', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'what', 'called', 'apparent', 'self-indulgence', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'self-indulgence', 'create', 'beautiful', 'pleasing', 'senses', 'film', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'sadness', 'encountering', 'stealing', 'beauty', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'forever', 'feel', 'sorry', 'them.I', 'rewatched', 'film', 'recently', 'loved', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'healing', 'quality', 'Tuscany', 'sun', 'filled', 'warmth', 'longing', 'bitter-sweetness.This', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'coming', 'age', 'unforgettable', 'moment', 'time', 'life', 'young', 'person', 'forever', 'lives', 'people', 'center', 'film', 'Lucy', '19', 'years', 'old', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'Italy', 'spend', 'summer', 'group', 'artists', 'friends', 'mother', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'mother', 'recent', 'suicide', 'secrets', 'took', 'Lucy', 'will', 'learn', 'more', 'people', 'thought', 'knew', 'well', 'will', 'change', 'forever', 'unforgettable', 'summer', 'Tuscany.Stealing', 'Beauty', 'European', 'film', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'Leisurely', 'paced', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'characters', 'beauty', 'surrounding', 'interest', 'affection', 'lovely', 'film', 'life', 'beauty', 'youth', 'nature', 'Italy', 'Art', 'power', 'memory', 'film', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Enchanting', 'April', '1992', 'Perhaps', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'atmosphere', 'similar', 'scenery', 'sun', 'Tuscany', 'effect', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'delightfully', 'unabashedly', 'romantic.Liv', 'Tyler', 'first', 'big', 'role', 'lit', 'screen', 'beauty', 'charming', 'awkwardness', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'girl', 'hesitating', 'step', 'border', 'adolescence', 'maturity', 'Lyv', 'Tyler', 'obviously', 'was', 'not', 'experienced', 'actress', '19', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'required', 'Lucy', 'was', 'natural', 'charming', 'innocent', 'curious', 'was', 'center', 'film', 'innocence', 'wholesomeness', 'insecurity', 'seriousness', 'touched', 'lives', 'everyone', 'spent', 'summer', 'Tuscany', 'Watching', 'Tyler', 'simply', 'move', 'screen', 'cinematic', 'pleasure', 'One', 'second', 'movements', 'endless', 'legs', 'arms', 'are', 'graceful', 'fluid', 'next', 'angular', 'impetuosity', 'knew', 'effect', 'luminous', 'beauty', 'everyone', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'deal', 'it.Besides', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'performance', 'made', 'star', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'also', 'memorable', 'Alex', 'Parrish', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'was', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'multi-', 'talented', 'famous', 'beloved', 'French', 'actor', 'Jean', 'Marais', 'mostly', 'known', 'collaboration', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'Lucino', 'Visconti', 'many', 'excellent', 'film', 'stage', 'performances']",Stealing Beauty VHS

406526,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6304195281,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","""Stealing Beauty"" is a beautiful film, with beautiful people and beautiful, lush settings. The film is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, the Italian director behind films like ""Last Tango in Paris"" and""The Dreamers."" This film is probably one of his most overlooked. I wanted to get it because I think Liv Tyler is gorgeous and she looks even more beautiful than usual in this film...The movie, judging by reviews I've seen on Netflix, doesn't have a lot of people who like it. One person even remarked that you'd be better off getting a travel video, but this is actually a pretty good film. Tyler plays a virginal 19-year-old girl named Lucy Harmon, whose mother (a poet) has recently passed away and whose father has sent her back to the Tuscan villa inhabited by artists that her mother used to be friends with. The people that own the place are Diane (Sinead Cusack) and Ian (Donal McCann), a sculptor whose sculptures line the yard. Other people are there as well, including Miranda (Rachel Weisz) and her boyfriend Richard (D.W. Moffett)...Also there is Alex (Jeremy Irons), a writer who takes a liking to Lucy. Lucy spends her day writing poetry (that she quickly burns) and looking for insight into her past. She believes that her father is not really HER father and is trying to figure out who is. A lot of people who see this movie will only be seeing it to watch Tyler disrobe...Which she does, but it's not in enough to abundance to be the only reason you see this movie. Even though I liked it, I found myself wondering what was the point? The point of a movie like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is to horrify. The point of ""Pulp Fiction"" is to entertain and electrify. But what is the point of Stealing Beauty? The plot can be summed up in a few words and the movie plays like quiet jazz music. Maybe the 'beauty' in the title sums up this film. It focuses on beauty, but not just exterior beauty. The movie has a lot of beautiful people likeLiv Tyler and Rachel Weisz, but then there's the Jeremy Irons character. He's sick, almost bald, and is always pale but likes to admire the beauty around him. A lot of the characters are into art;Lucy does poetry, Ian sculpts, Richard acts, and Alex writes...""Stealing Beauty"" is not so much about plot as it is about atmosphere and feeling. The way you might like a gray, rainy day because of how you feel not what the day looks like. Another film that plays like this could become dull, but ""Stealing Beauty"" (for me) was never dull...That could be attributed to the spectacular performances, which are all low-key. Tyler is perfectly cast; she looks so innocent and vulnerable in the film. Irons gives one of his best performances. The man can do more with a whisper than most actors can with a flamboyant speech. It's not perfect, but it is a good film that's easy to enjoy. Just kick back, enjoy the scenery, and bask in the beauty of it.GRADE: B+",4,A Beautiful Film,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2908,"['Stealing', 'Beauty', 'beautiful', 'film', 'beautiful', 'people', 'beautiful', 'lush', 'settings', 'film', 'directed', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'Italian', 'director', 'films', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Dreamers', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'wanted', 'get', 'think', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'usual', 'film', 'movie', 'judging', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Netflix', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'One', 'person', 'even', 'remarked', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'travel', 'video', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'Tyler', 'virginal', '19-year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Lucy', 'Harmon', 'mother', 'poet', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'father', 'sent', 'back', 'Tuscan', 'villa', 'inhabited', 'artists', 'mother', 'used', 'be', 'friends', 'people', 'own', 'place', 'are', 'Diane', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'Ian', 'Donal', 'McCann', 'sculptor', 'sculptures', 'line', 'yard', 'Other', 'people', 'are', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Miranda', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'boyfriend', 'Richard', 'D.W.', 'Moffett', 'Also', 'Alex', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'writer', 'who', 'liking', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'day', 'writing', 'poetry', 'quickly', 'burns', 'looking', 'insight', 'past', 'father', 'not', 'really', 'HER', 'father', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'seeing', 'watch', 'Tyler', 'disrobe', 'Which', 'not', 'enough', 'abundance', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'Even', 'liked', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'point', 'movie', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'horrify', 'point', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'entertain', 'electrify', 'what', 'point', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'few', 'words', 'movie', 'quiet', 'jazz', 'music', 'Maybe', ""'beauty"", 'title', 'sums', 'up', 'film', 'beauty', 'not', 'just', 'exterior', 'beauty', 'movie', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'people', 'likeLiv', 'Tyler', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'then', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'sick', 'almost', 'bald', 'always', 'pale', 'admire', 'beauty', 'lot', 'characters', 'are', 'art', 'Lucy', 'poetry', 'Ian', 'Richard', 'Alex', 'writes', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'atmosphere', 'feeling', 'way', 'might', 'like', 'gray', 'rainy', 'day', 'how', 'feel', 'not', 'what', 'day', 'film', 'could', 'become', 'dull', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'could', 'be', 'attributed', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'are', 'low-key', 'Tyler', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'so', 'innocent', 'vulnerable', 'film', 'Irons', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'whisper', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'flamboyant', 'speech', 'not', 'perfect', 'good', 'film', 'easy', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'bask', 'beauty', 'it.GRADE', 'B+']",Stealing Beauty VHS

Unfortunately, as she is stultifyingly dull, inane, superficial, selfish, coy, and vapid, this is impossible.  God only knows why Bertolucci cast her in this role, surrounded by others who can actually act.  Not even consummate pro Jeremy Irons can make his fascination with this simpering whiner sound sincere.The story is as banal as she is:  teenage Lucy (Tyler) returns to Italy to lose her virginity, dreaming of a sexy young Italian she met at 13.  She does not delight in the Tuscan landscape, study art, or learn Italian, which she insists on pronouncing with an excruciating American accent.  Lucy lodges with a fatuous English sculpture and family who live the kind of `bohemian' life only available to the idle rich.  The boys are beautiful (young Joseph Fiennes is stunning) and, their hormones raging, are after just one thing.The only thoughtful  character is a middle-aged man dying of AIDS (Irons).  His inexplicable presence and predicament may have been the director's idea of adding `weight' to this fluff.  He and Lucy become friends, though one cannot grasp why.  Perhaps she admires his ability speak in sentences that parse.  Her utter self-absorbtion is forgotten for a moment as he is whisked away to die in a hospital.  But as soon as the ambulance is out of sight, pretty, perky, pouty Lucy quickly comes to her senses and returns to the task at hand:  giving it up.The only other American in the film is a thoroughly odious entertainment lawyer who, when not on the phone making deals, cheats on his wife at every turn.  Being within earshot, she always catches him.  He follows her around and grovels.But back to Lucy!  She is a relentless tease and remorselessly leads on her paramour.  When the time comes, however, she spurns him with one last shrill whine of consternation, and flounces out of the room leaving him decidedly 'blue'.Bertolucci must have been in love to have been this blind.",2,much ado about nothing,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2075,"['comprehend', 'empty', 'meaningless', 'drivel', 'one', 'must', 'accept', 'do', 'characters', 'premise', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'veritable', 'goddess', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'stultifyingly', 'dull', 'inane', 'superficial', 'selfish', 'coy', 'vapid', 'impossible', 'God', 'only', 'why', 'Bertolucci', 'cast', 'role', 'surrounded', 'others', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'Not', 'even', 'consummate', 'pro', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'can', 'make', 'fascination', 'simpering', 'whiner', 'sound', 'sincere.The', 'story', 'as', 'banal', 'teenage', 'Lucy', 'Tyler', 'Italy', 'lose', 'virginity', 'dreaming', 'sexy', 'young', 'Italian', 'met', '13', 'not', 'delight', 'Tuscan', 'landscape', 'study', 'art', 'learn', 'Italian', 'pronouncing', 'excruciating', 'American', 'accent', 'Lucy', 'fatuous', 'English', 'sculpture', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'kind', 'bohemian', 'life', 'only', 'available', 'idle', 'rich', 'boys', 'are', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'stunning', 'hormones', 'raging', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'thing.The', 'only', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'Irons', 'inexplicable', 'presence', 'predicament', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'director', 'idea', 'adding', 'weight', 'fluff', 'Lucy', 'become', 'friends', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'grasp', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'ability', 'speak', 'sentences', 'parse', 'utter', 'self-absorbtion', 'forgotten', 'moment', 'whisked', 'away', 'die', 'hospital', 'as', 'soon', 'ambulance', 'sight', 'pretty', 'perky', 'pouty', 'Lucy', 'quickly', 'senses', 'returns', 'task', 'hand', 'giving', 'up.The', 'only', 'other', 'American', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'odious', 'entertainment', 'lawyer', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'phone', 'making', 'deals', 'cheats', 'wife', 'turn', 'Being', 'earshot', 'always', 'around', 'grovels.But', 'back', 'Lucy', 'relentless', 'tease', 'remorselessly', 'paramour', 'When', 'time', 'however', 'one', 'last', 'shrill', 'whine', 'consternation', 'room', 'leaving', 'decidedly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'blind']",Stealing Beauty VHS

Lucy, upon going through her late mother's things, finds evidence that the man she thought was her father is not, indeed, her father.

Take for example, ""Stealing Beauty"", this must be the most pretentious and bloated of his works. This film is almost unbearable to watch, it is dreadfully painful even. The characters are nothing but a bunch of spoiled, irreverent, upper middle class pseudo-intellectuals and artists who live out in an Italian country side.

406541,A26WVK274IA7DN,6304195281,Sarah Bellum,"[11, 12]","Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci brings that certain European pacing and feel to his movies, even though the past several have been made in English and often with at least one American actor. This means you can expect a great amount of talking and very little action, which can be wonderful if you are in the right frame of mind. He also brings that European attitude toward sexuality and nudity (and no, I am not equating the two), which is to say his actors are fairly uninhibited. He usually peppers his films with a fair amount of nudity and/or sex, and ""Stealing Beauty"" is no exception. It is no secret the average American is much more inhibited about his or her body than the average European, which provides the filmmaker with an opportunity for commentary. American teen, Lucy, visits her family in Tuscany shortly after her mother's passing in order to find her father. She is taken aback, however, when she heads to the swimming pool one day and finds everyone lounging about naked. She declines to join in. Eventually, however, she loosens up enough to expose a breast while posing for a portrait. ""When in Rome..."" (or in the vicinity, anyway). Bertolucci is providing a view of the Italian way of life, or at least those aspects that interest him most, through the eyes of an American. He compares and contrasts the two cultures with details that seem too obvious to even illuminate. It is interesting that Lucy seems to find more in common with some of the Italians she meets than she does with some of the Americans there. Over the course of the film, beauty takes precedence over deeper levels of meaning, though this is not necessarily to the film's detriment.

Is it really the same Bertolucci who made ""La Commare Secca"", and ""The Conformist"", and ""The Spider's Stratagem"" ?

A bunch of not particularly interesting people stuck in a country house, an American virgin trying to have it - there isn't really much to work with. The characters, with a possible exception of that of Jeremy Irons', are shallow, often annoyingly so.There are too many people, there is no time to explore any of them.

It has been a pleasure to see Jean Marais. The Italian countryside is of course beautiful. What else ? Well, that's about it.It is a grossly overrated, pathetically pretentious low-grate production, in my humble opinion. Those bows to Antonioni's ""The Red Desert"", with paint-games, and to ""Blow Up"", with the pantomime actors who are as extraneous to the film as so many other things, only make the show more woeful.I continue to hope that Bertolucci will come to his senses and remember that he probably still has his genius buried somewhere deep inside.
