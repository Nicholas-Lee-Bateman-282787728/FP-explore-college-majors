1299032,A6QVW3FM7KDAV,B002Y3GZD2,Doyle K.,"[0, 0]",This documentary explores an attempt to prevent gay and lesbian abuse in a small town.  It primarily follows a young gay high school student as he attempts to cope with his coming out resulting harassment.  With his mother&#8217;s assistance he seeks help from a gay prior student of the same school who returns to the community with his partner to provide helpful direction.  The documentary proves that persistence against narrow minded religious bigots can ultimately be rewarded through the legal system.The characters are real and believable.  Much of the action is confrontational and appears to have been recorded live.  This would make an excellent video to be presented in conjunction with a training and discussion group.  If you have a small town background - be prepared to have some buried memories touched.,4,HAS USEFUL EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS - WELL DONE,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,820,"['documentary', 'attempt', 'prevent', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'abuse', 'small', 'town', 'primarily', 'young', 'gay', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'cope', 'coming', 'out', 'resulting', 'harassment', 'mother', '8217', 's', 'assistance', 'help', 'gay', 'prior', 'student', 'same', 'school', 'who', 'community', 'partner', 'provide', 'helpful', 'direction', 'documentary', 'proves', 'persistence', 'narrow', 'minded', 'religious', 'bigots', 'can', 'ultimately', 'be', 'rewarded', 'legal', 'system.The', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'believable', 'Much', 'action', 'confrontational', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'live', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'video', 'be', 'presented', 'conjunction', 'training', 'discussion', 'group', 'have', 'small', 'town', 'background', 'be', 'prepared', 'have', 'buried', 'memories', 'touched']",Out in the Silence

I found the narration a bit stilted though honest and grounded. From receiving a call for help in a letter, to the outcome of a suit against a town's school system that turned a blind eye, through an expose of a kid who's just a kid, and a salt of the earth lesbian couple working to make a mark to revitalize the town, the doc stays grounded and plain spoken. It's a bit uneven certainly and I found myself wanting to see deeper into the spectrum of homophobia in middle America, but the filmmaker wasn't interested in stereotypes or grandstanding. The antagonist isn't demonized, she's a woman using the voice of civil rights against civil rights, she's calm hatred and urgency, a voice veiled in the language of family and morality. She's the feeding trough of homophobic frenzy in the town where the movie makes its focus. She tells people they will loose something, tells them calmly that the world will become dangerous and insane and the afterlife promises to be painful if they allow something different than what keeps her sane. This keeps the doc's focus minimal but if we look deeply enough we can see how dangerous and powerful she is. But the narrow focus keeps the film restrained from being as universal as it could be. We see her, but hardly a glimpse of those feeding from her and what she means. Still, I personally found the doc profound in it's simplicity and relative lightness. An easy and deeply affecting watch.

1299034,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B002Y3GZD2,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[1, 1]","At the beginning of this superb Documentary, I bristled at all of the anti-gay rhetoric being spewed by some of the inhabitants of a small ""rust-belt"" town in Pennsylvania. This documentary is initially about the film maker and producer of this movie ""Out in the Silence"" who has returned to his hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania at the request of a very brave and courageous mother of a super-jock son that has come-out of the closet as a Gay man and is unmercifully being taunted and harassed by members of his community and, most of all, he is being bullied by his high school mates seemingly without any punishment for the inflictors of the abuse or is there seemingly any caring by the adults that were supposed to be looking after the welfare of ALL students.  The mother of this student sought out the film maker Joe Wilson because he had just been the victim of much ridicule and hate from a lot of residence in the aforesaid town because of his announcement, in the local paper, of his marriage to another man.As indicated above, I negatively reacted to the hate that initially was shown in this film.  However, there is so much more to this movie.  It shows the determination of some very heroic women that happen to be gay and have the town's well-being so much at heart that they take on a very imposing and monumental task that benefits the town's hoped for rebirth even though because of being two gay women they are the recipients of loads of negativity.  This ""other side"" of ""Out in the Silence"" also shows people in all walks of life being able to change their attitudes and being able to have some understanding of those considered different than themselves.  This film touched my soul very deeply mainly because it shows so much hope from all.",5,"Bravery, hope, determination and change in small-town America",1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,1764,"['beginning', 'superb', 'Documentary', 'bristled', 'anti-gay', 'rhetoric', 'being', 'spewed', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'rust-belt', 'town', 'Pennsylvania', 'documentary', 'initially', 'film', 'maker', 'producer', 'movie', 'Silence', 'who', 'returned', 'hometown', 'Oil', 'City', 'Pennsylvania', 'request', 'very', 'brave', 'courageous', 'mother', 'super-jock', 'son', 'come-out', 'closet', 'Gay', 'man', 'unmercifully', 'being', 'taunted', 'harassed', 'members', 'community', 'most', 'being', 'bullied', 'high', 'school', 'mates', 'seemingly', 'punishment', 'inflictors', 'abuse', 'there', 'seemingly', 'caring', 'adults', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'welfare', 'students', 'mother', 'student', 'sought', 'out', 'film', 'maker', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'victim', 'much', 'ridicule', 'hate', 'lot', 'residence', 'aforesaid', 'town', 'announcement', 'local', 'paper', 'marriage', 'man.As', 'indicated', 'negatively', 'reacted', 'hate', 'initially', 'was', 'shown', 'film', 'However', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'determination', 'very', 'heroic', 'women', 'happen', 'be', 'gay', 'have', 'town', 'well-being', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'take', 'very', 'imposing', 'monumental', 'task', 'benefits', 'town', 'hoped', 'rebirth', 'even', 'being', 'two', 'gay', 'women', 'are', 'recipients', 'loads', 'negativity', 'other', 'side', 'Out', 'Silence', 'also', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'being', 'able', 'change', 'attitudes', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'understanding', 'considered', 'different', 'film', 'touched', 'soul', 'very', 'deeply', 'mainly', 'so', 'much', 'hope']",Out in the Silence

The movie itself was done well.  It was often tough to see what the main character, the teenager CJ Bills, was going through across the time this was filmed.  As so many millions of us know, his fight for survival and dignity was and unfortunately still is in many places what life is like, despite the great progress that has been made in anti-discriminatory laws and education.There are also some good people appearing in the movie, some such as Reverend Mark and Diana Micklos, who show what it is like to be Christians limited by human shortcomings that can be trancended by God's love.  It's a good documentary which shows a town struggle with different beliefs.  Many citizens nonetheless succeed in fostering a sense of community and inclusion.  There are some brave people in this movie, starting with CJ and his mom, Kathy Springer, Roxanne Hitchcock and her partner Linda Henderson and others, and I thank them for speaking out to fight crimes and injustices against humanity.

1299036,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B002Y3GZD2,J. Martin,"[11, 14]","This is an interesting if mostly predictable movie. The drama of a gay kid in a redneck high school is the predictable part, although the kid in this case is unusually appealing. That is partly because he has an almost Brando-like look and quiet, macho strength about him, but mainly because he seems so perfectly NORMAL. He has a gentle manner, but there is nothing about him that would flag him as gay. So his decision to come out was perhaps especially brave because he is not the sort everybody would already know is gay. That is how he comes across in the movie, anyway: just a normal teenage kid whose main interests seem to be sports and hot rods, not fashion and Madonna.But there is nothing new in his story: gay kid gets abused at school; teachers and school board turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, refusing even to address the issue; Mom is loving and supportive but lacks the confidence and resources to fight the system alone - until the ACLU gets involved.... You know the rest.But what is extraordinary in this movie is a local pastor named Mark Micklos. He is one of the people who wrote to the hometown paper objecting to the Joe Wilson/Dean Hamer wedding announcement that was the catalyst for the whole movie. Wilson begins by interviewing him and his wife, and as he is with most of his interviewees, Wilson starts out pretty defensive. But although they disagree about gay marriage, Micklos refuses to spar with Wilson about the issue. Instead, he insists on keeping a dialog open and on trying to show Wilson the love of Jesus instead of arguing with or attacking him.What is amazing and deeply gratifying is that it works. Almost against his will, Wilson begins to trust him. They never agree, but they become real friends. By the end of the movie, the greatest change is in Joe Wilson himself. He is less defensive and more tolerant of those who are intolerant of him. If all Christians were like Mark Micklos, the world would be a much better place.",4,Interesting; both predictable and surprising,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,1973,"['interesting', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'movie', 'drama', 'gay', 'kid', 'redneck', 'high', 'school', 'predictable', 'part', 'kid', 'case', 'unusually', 'appealing', 'partly', 'almost', 'Brando-like', 'look', 'quiet', 'macho', 'strength', 'mainly', 'so', 'perfectly', 'NORMAL', 'gentle', 'manner', 'nothing', 'would', 'flag', 'gay', 'decision', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'brave', 'not', 'sort', 'everybody', 'would', 'already', 'know', 'gay', 'how', 'movie', 'anyway', 'just', 'normal', 'teenage', 'kid', 'main', 'interests', 'seem', 'be', 'sports', 'hot', 'rods', 'not', 'fashion', 'Madonna.But', 'nothing', 'new', 'story', 'gay', 'kid', 'abused', 'school', 'teachers', 'school', 'board', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'deaf', 'ear', 'refusing', 'even', 'address', 'issue', 'Mom', 'loving', 'supportive', 'confidence', 'resources', 'fight', 'system', 'alone', 'ACLU', 'involved', 'know', 'rest.But', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'local', 'pastor', 'named', 'Mark', 'Micklos', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'hometown', 'paper', 'objecting', 'Joe', 'Wilson/Dean', 'Hamer', 'wedding', 'announcement', 'was', 'catalyst', 'whole', 'movie', 'Wilson', 'interviewing', 'wife', 'most', 'interviewees', 'Wilson', 'out', 'pretty', 'defensive', 'disagree', 'gay', 'marriage', 'Micklos', 'spar', 'Wilson', 'issue', 'Instead', 'keeping', 'dialog', 'open', 'trying', 'show', 'Wilson', 'love', 'Jesus', 'instead', 'arguing', 'attacking', 'him.What', 'amazing', 'deeply', 'gratifying', 'Almost', 'will', 'Wilson', 'trust', 'never', 'agree', 'become', 'real', 'friends', 'end', 'movie', 'greatest', 'change', 'Joe', 'Wilson', 'less', 'defensive', 'more', 'tolerant', 'who', 'are', 'intolerant', 'Christians', 'were', 'like', 'Mark', 'Micklos', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'place']",Out in the Silence

Have you ever wondered why corporations and otherwise sane individuals pander to superstition. Because it creates an ""atmosphere"" of belief and gullibility and therefore control. One of the best examples is the superstition of the ""13th floor"" in buildings. Mathematics, science, actuality, even common sense demands that the floor exists and yet the delusion that it does not is imposed upon the most rational of people. The religious intolerance seen in this film is not surprising since the inherent unprovability and irrationality of religion must FORCE conformity. The word ""heretic"" originates from the Greek hairetikos meaning `able to choose'. Whether by laws or violence religion strips you of the freedom to choose in order to subjugate you to it's control. Belief is a powerful force and fear is another form of belief. For example, if you have a fear of snakes then you must believe in the ability of a snake to harm you or you would not fear it. Prejudice and homophobia are just other forms of irrational belief. People murder daily, and parents allow their children to suffer and die unnecessarily, all because of their beliefs. Imagine the power if you could control what people believe. Cons, politicians, religions, and corporations all desire to control your belief, because people will sacrifice everything to have its manifestation, even if it is imposed upon them and against their personal and common good.",5,Religious hate is an evident token of their own perdition.,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1493,"['Living', 'small', 'superstitious', 'town', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'corporations', 'otherwise', 'sane', 'individuals', 'pander', 'superstition', 'atmosphere', 'belief', 'gullibility', 'therefore', 'control', 'One', 'best', 'examples', 'superstition', '13th', 'floor', 'buildings', 'Mathematics', 'science', 'actuality', 'even', 'common', 'sense', 'floor', 'exists', 'yet', 'delusion', 'not', 'imposed', 'most', 'rational', 'people', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'seen', 'film', 'not', 'surprising', 'inherent', 'unprovability', 'irrationality', 'religion', 'must', 'FORCE', 'conformity', 'word', 'heretic', 'originates', 'Greek', 'hairetikos', 'meaning', 'able', 'choose', 'laws', 'violence', 'religion', 'freedom', 'choose', 'order', 'subjugate', 'control', 'Belief', 'powerful', 'force', 'fear', 'form', 'belief', 'example', 'have', 'fear', 'snakes', 'then', 'must', 'believe', 'ability', 'snake', 'harm', 'would', 'not', 'fear', 'Prejudice', 'homophobia', 'are', 'just', 'other', 'forms', 'irrational', 'belief', 'People', 'murder', 'daily', 'parents', 'allow', 'children', 'suffer', 'die', 'unnecessarily', 'beliefs', 'Imagine', 'power', 'could', 'control', 'what', 'people', 'believe', 'Cons', 'politicians', 'religions', 'corporations', 'desire', 'control', 'belief', 'people', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'have', 'manifestation', 'even', 'imposed', 'personal', 'common', 'good']",Out in the Silence
