Although the direction might seem too deliberate and fastidious, the patience pays off handsomely, as the epiphanies in the film are as sure and profound as the small revelations we get from the real life. This is definitely as un-American a film could get, and I was thankful for it. In the hands of a lesser director, there might have been easy resolutions and gratifications, but there is no tidily summed up denouement here. The ending is resonant and unforced. It's a shame Yi Yi received the slight from the Academy voters.

574871,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B000059TON,Amit Talpade,"[2, 2]","Yi Yi is a hard film to describe, on the surface it may come across as a soap opera about a Taipei family but it is more than that.....It is a movie about family and responsibility, relationships, childhood, adolescence, disappointments, regrets, love, duty and much more.Edward Yang's YIYI at 173 minutes long is a masterpiece. It may be a very lengthy film but time goes by and the viewer tends to get drawn in to the lives of the various individuals on the screen, this is also because the film is narrated in a fly on the wall kind of way. We also begin to identify with these people because so many of these issues have been experienced, or have been familiar to us. The film begins with a wedding and ends with a funeral; there is also a birth midway in the film. The films main character is NJ, who is struggling at work and is also having regrets about losing his true love many years ago. His wife facing a similar midlife crisis has run away to join a monastery. His daughter Ting Ting is in a complicated relationship involving a love triangle. The heart of this family is the mother in-law and when she falls sick, this family starts to implode. The child actors were great, Ting Ting ( Kelly Lee) is superb as the teenager experiencing first love. Jonathan Chang (Yang-Yang) is also great as the younger child, I loved the eulogy that he delivers at the funeral. The scenes with Mr. Ota, just fantastic.Edward Yang's direction deserves a special mention because the city has never been so beautiful in recent memories, he manages to make dreary office buildings, restaurants, cafes, empty parking lots, school yards hauntingly beautiful ( Thank you for the choreography)I feel that this was one of the most satisfying films that I have seen this year, although it was released in the year 2000. Alas, Yang is no longer with us as he has passed on but this movie is an example of his craft. Do yourself a favor, watch it with your loved one or alone.

574872,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000059TON,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","A simple and delicate story about life itself is told magnificently in `Yi Yi'.  Fearing that I'd give away too much, I feel compelled to basically say ""WATCH THIS MOVIE"" and leave it at that, but that is rarely how I do things.The film tells the story of a family in Taipei who endures some serious, life changes events that begin to shape them as a family and, more importantly, individually.  Most notable is Min-Min and N.J., parents to Ting-Ting and Yang-Yang.  When Min-Min's mother suffers a stroke and lies in coma, almost certain to die, Min-Min suffers a serious setback, emotionally.  On the cusp of her breakdown, her husband N.J. bumps into an old flame who apparently has not forgotten him and soon he is arranging business trips to align with her schedule so they can meet and rediscover their love, if it still exists.  Their daughter, Ting-Ting is also trying her hand at love, falling head-over-heals (but in the most delicate of ways) with her best friends ex-boyfriend.  And then there is the precocious little Ting-Ting, who endeavors to rebel all the while discovering his own budding curiosity in ways unnoticed by his busying family.But their extended family makes their presence (and problems) known as well.What I love most about `Yi Yi' is the way is remains nearly silent in texture.  With everything that is going on within it's scope, it would be easy to go to the extreme with things and make everything a boisterous event.  Instead, `Yi Yi' decides, rather ingeniously, to maintain a quiet exterior.  It is delicate and soft, subtle in tone and thus it says so much with a mere whisper.It is one of those films that contains so many small details yet never once feels overwrought.I'll leave it here.  I don't want to give away too many of the films delectable moments.  I'll say that the framing of the film is stunning; perfectly capturing the needed mood and giving small intimacies true prominence.  The big acting triumph here is easily Elaine Jin, who takes Min-Min's situation and gives it such body despite her small amount of screen time.  She haunts with ease.  Edward Yang beautifully directs this masterclass film, a film I highly recommend without any reservations!",5,A one and a two...,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2209,"['simple', 'delicate', 'story', 'life', 'told', 'magnificently', 'Yi', 'Yi', 'Fearing', ""'d"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'compelled', 'basically', 'say', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'leave', 'rarely', 'how', 'do', 'things.The', 'film', 'story', 'family', 'Taipei', 'who', 'serious', 'life', 'changes', 'events', 'begin', 'shape', 'family', 'more', 'importantly', 'individually', 'Most', 'notable', 'Min-Min', 'N.J.', 'parents', 'Ting-Ting', 'Yang-Yang', 'When', 'Min-Min', 'mother', 'stroke', 'coma', 'almost', 'certain', 'die', 'Min-Min', 'serious', 'setback', 'emotionally', 'cusp', 'breakdown', 'husband', 'N.J.', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'apparently', 'not', 'forgotten', 'soon', 'arranging', 'business', 'trips', 'align', 'schedule', 'can', 'meet', 'rediscover', 'love', 'still', 'daughter', 'Ting-Ting', 'also', 'trying', 'hand', 'love', 'falling', 'head-over-heals', 'most', 'delicate', 'ways', 'best', 'friends', 'ex-boyfriend', 'then', 'precocious', 'little', 'Ting-Ting', 'who', 'rebel', 'while', 'discovering', 'own', 'budding', 'curiosity', 'ways', 'unnoticed', 'busying', 'family.But', 'extended', 'family', 'presence', 'problems', 'known', 'well.What', 'love', 'most', 'Yi', 'Yi', 'way', 'nearly', 'silent', 'texture', 'everything', 'going', 'scope', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'go', 'extreme', 'things', 'make', 'everything', 'boisterous', 'event', 'Instead', 'Yi', 'Yi', 'decides', 'rather', 'ingeniously', 'maintain', 'quiet', 'exterior', 'delicate', 'soft', 'subtle', 'tone', 'thus', 'so', 'much', 'mere', 'whisper.It', 'one', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'small', 'details', 'yet', 'never', 'once', 'feels', 'overwrought.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'delectable', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'say', 'framing', 'film', 'stunning', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'needed', 'mood', 'giving', 'small', 'intimacies', 'true', 'prominence', 'big', 'acting', 'triumph', 'here', 'easily', 'Elaine', 'Jin', 'who', 'Min-Min', 'situation', 'such', 'body', 'small', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'ease', 'Edward', 'Yang', 'beautifully', 'masterclass', 'film', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reservations']",Yi Yi: A One and a Two

574874,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000059TON,Anyechka,"[2, 10]","While I did not hate this movie or find it to be boring or worthless, I didn't love it either.  Overall, I found it just okay.  While I usually love foreign films and thus have more patience for them than the average American, this one was underwhelming.  The trailer made it seem like it would be a lot more interesting and emotional, and all of the critical praise also led me to expect something a lot more interesting and riveting.  The main problem with the film seemed to be how it couldn't just pick one main storyline and subplot and stick with them.  Instead it was jumping all over the place, from storyline to storyline, like a Taiwanese soap opera, and never settling down on just one main story and then a subplot.  As a result, I found it hard to connect with the characters and be really emotionally drawn in by any of these goings-on.  It's hard to get into a film when the characters aren't fully fleshed-out and we're constantly going from story to story.  Apart from the adorable Yang-Yang and the Japanese businessman Mr. Ota, none of the characters really came alive or seemed that interesting or sympathetic.  The camera work was also rather static, and didn't even feature any real close-ups, which might have helped the viewer to connect more with the characters and feel pulled into the story.  It's like Edward Yang were trying to tell too many stories at once, all in the same film.  Perhaps it would have helped if he'd cut the film down by at least an hour, so he could concentrate more on just a few characters and their stories, not the stories of the comatose grandma, Yang-Yang's troubles at school, Ting-Ting's love troubles, N.J.'s second chance with his first love Sherry, A-Di's financial troubles with his business partner Piggy, the arrival of A-Di and Xiao Yen's baby, the business deal N.J. is trying to negotiate, Lili's problems at home, and the unwanted presence of Yun-Yun at A-Di and Xiao Yen's wedding and baby shower.  It was hard to keep track of what all was going on at any given moment because there were so many characters and storylines to keep track of!There were a couple of great moments scattered throughout the almost three hours of bopping from character to character and story to story, such as the hilarious fight which breaks out at the baby shower, any scene with Yang-Yang, the scenes between N.J. and Mr. Ota, and the moving final scene, and if Mr. Yang had just focused on wonderful scenes and moments like that, instead of feeling the need to tell an entire family saga in three hours, the film could have had so much more potential.  Most of the acting also seemed a bit restrained, thus never letting the viewer really get a sense of that person's emotions and state of mind, though perhaps this is partly because Asians are supposedly more emotionally reserved than Westerners.  I generally like long films, and understand sometimes the director needs a little time to fully set up the story, but this film seemed to be so long because the director couldn't make up his mind as to what he wanted his focus to be.  Overall I enjoyed it, but it's not something I could see myself watching over and over again.",3,Just okay,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,3178,"['did', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'find', 'be', 'boring', 'worthless', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'either', 'Overall', 'found', 'just', 'okay', 'usually', 'love', 'foreign', 'films', 'thus', 'have', 'more', 'patience', 'average', 'American', 'one', 'was', 'underwhelming', 'trailer', 'made', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'critical', 'praise', 'also', 'led', 'expect', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'riveting', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'main', 'storyline', 'subplot', 'stick', 'Instead', 'was', 'jumping', 'place', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'Taiwanese', 'soap', 'opera', 'never', 'settling', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'main', 'story', 'then', 'subplot', 'result', 'found', 'hard', 'connect', 'characters', 'be', 'really', 'emotionally', 'drawn', 'goings-on', 'hard', 'get', 'film', 'when', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fleshed-out', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'going', 'story', 'story', 'Apart', 'adorable', 'Yang-Yang', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'Mr.', 'Ota', 'none', 'characters', 'really', 'came', 'alive', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'static', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feature', 'real', 'close-ups', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'viewer', 'connect', 'more', 'characters', 'feel', 'pulled', 'story', 'Edward', 'Yang', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'once', 'same', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'helped', ""'d"", 'cut', 'film', 'down', 'least', 'hour', 'could', 'concentrate', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'characters', 'stories', 'not', 'stories', 'comatose', 'grandma', 'Yang-Yang', 'troubles', 'school', 'Ting-Ting', 'love', 'troubles', 'N.J.', 'second', 'chance', 'first', 'love', 'Sherry', 'A-Di', 'financial', 'troubles', 'business', 'partner', 'Piggy', 'arrival', 'A-Di', 'Xiao', 'Yen', 'baby', 'business', 'deal', 'N.J.', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'Lili', 'problems', 'home', 'unwanted', 'presence', 'Yun-Yun', 'A-Di', 'Xiao', 'Yen', 'wedding', 'baby', 'shower', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'given', 'moment', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'storylines', 'keep', 'track', 'were', 'couple', 'great', 'moments', 'scattered', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'bopping', 'character', 'character', 'story', 'story', 'such', 'hilarious', 'fight', 'out', 'baby', 'shower', 'scene', 'Yang-Yang', 'scenes', 'N.J.', 'Mr.', 'Ota', 'moving', 'final', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Yang', 'had', 'just', 'focused', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'moments', 'instead', 'feeling', 'need', 'tell', 'entire', 'family', 'saga', 'three', 'hours', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'Most', 'acting', 'also', 'seemed', 'bit', 'restrained', 'thus', 'never', 'letting', 'viewer', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'person', 'emotions', 'state', 'mind', 'perhaps', 'partly', 'Asians', 'are', 'supposedly', 'more', 'emotionally', 'reserved', 'Westerners', 'generally', 'like', 'long', 'films', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'director', 'little', 'time', 'fully', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'so', 'long', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'wanted', 'focus', 'be', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'something', 'could', 'see', 'watching', 'over', 'again']",Yi Yi: A One and a Two

574876,A1TZSL7WPZRVMB,B000059TON,"cdswatch ""cdswatch""","[1, 1]","Yi Yi is not made in the mold of traditional Hollywood way of filmmaking.  Whereas the narration of most Hollywood movies will try to engage the viewers and break down the barrier between the audience and the movie screen, Yi Yi upholds that barrier and reminds the audience that they are a separate entity altogether.  This is clear from the choice of the long shots and often from outside of the characters' space altogether (such as outside looking in shots through the window of the apartment and the train).  Often the characters are speaking when the camera is not even directed at them.  Close-up shots are few and far in between.  As a result, it produces an aura of voyeurism, that we are illicitly observing other people.  However, the surprising part is that the story we witness is far from the fantastic, instead they could be a story of any Taiwanese family or any family in general.The film basically tells a story about a family in crisis.  The grandmother is lying in a coma.  The mother is going through a mental breakdown that would land her temporarily in an asylum.  The father is having a second thought on the marriage as an old flame suddenly reappears in his life.  The daughter is having an infatuation for her neighbor's boyfriend.  And the list continues.  The problems might look extraordinary as they are packed into a three hour long movie (which a lot of people have complained that it is far too long), however, each individual problem might be one that your average neighbor is currently facing.  The only anomaly is perhaps a murder that takes place in the course of the movie.  The murderer makes a ironic comment before the murder takes place: why is it that although we might have never murdered anybody, we know what it feels like to commit a murder from watching movies.  This comment is consistent with the overall tone of the film that discourages the audience to take an active part in the film.  We are frequently reminded that there is still that partition between the reel and reality.Overall, I am impressed by the visual style employed here.  It is certainly a breath of fresh air in Asian cinema.  If there is any qualm about this film is the onslaught of new problems that surface continously.  In the end, there so many problems abound that the interesting part, how the characters deal with them are not adequately developed.

It captures our world and our humanity brilliantly. All the beauty, tragedy, mistakes, depression, learning, love, tension, everything we have gone through and will experience - it's all here.Still...I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. My favorite character was the young Yang-Yang, an 8 year old boy who likes to learn and is already quite wise for his age, yet he has a sweet innocence about him. The movie seemed to focus on everyone else, leaving him with only a few short scenes...thankfully he steals the final scene and gives the last words, which are heartwarming.Overall it is a slow, boring, fast, exciting, sad, happy movie.

Yang's great achievement is to make a humanist, character driven film without getting soft or soppy, fixing a formal, modernist apparatus on it that makes connections - through incident, character, colour (those startling reds and cool blues), metaphor (doubling, reproductions), location - way beyond the narrow knowledge of his protagonists.

574879,A1P2KRAMSBR1RR,B000059TON,David Alston,"[2, 2]","*NOTE: A Few minor spoilers!*Edward Yang's YI YI is, in my opinion, one of the few solid masterpieces of the new millennia.Yang passed away at the end of June, and his creative presence will be very much missed.  Though it's an unfortunate coincidence, one major quality of this film is it's autumnal feel, which unifies an elaborate narrative of Chekhovian richness.  Throughout the length of this very captivating film, varied characters engage in backward glances through their lives - which primarily takes the form of self-interrogations of regrets and missed opportunities, and the consequences of ill-informed actions, leading up to a certain resignation and forgiveness.  This is perhaps most dramatic in the extremely varied male characters - several of whom (from patriarch N.J., his precocious son Yang-Yang, and his Japanese colleague Ota) are essentially poets or philosophers forced by circumstance into corporate lives they may or may not find entirely satisfying.YI YI begins with a wedding and ends with a funeral, and it feels like a slice of something much more expansive - this film combines a humanism and character detail evocative of Satyajit Ray with the kind of tightly choreographed sprawl one would associate with Robert Altman or Jean Renoir; a large number of the scenes that Yang constructs pose intricate questions, leading to a gradual upward modulation in emotional intensity towards the end of the film.  Yang - wisely I feel - selected several non-actors for major roles here (other filmmakers or writers mostly); it is handled very well here, with a great deal of immediacy, but little or no amateurisness perceptible.  Yang has a penchant for incorporating incidental scene material as symbolic elements - shooting through windows and against mirrors, and using reflections to undescore emotional points within, and this is breathtaking at several points (watch for the heartbeat in one extraordinary, mostly non-verbal scene).  The combination of such a strong sense of visual improvisation within a rather intricate and literary narrative is unusual and quite powerful.Through it all N.J. and Yang-Yang stand as the pivotal characters, with Yang-Yang clarifying the emotional center of what the characters in this film fumble towards (and what Edward Yang, with far more virtuosity, also sought to do):""When I grow up, I want to tell things people don't know, show them stuff they haven't seen.""A great, rich film.-David Alston",5,I Want To Tell People Things They Don't Know...,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,2466,"['*NOTE', 'Few', 'minor', 'spoilers', '*Edward', 'Yang', 'YI', 'YI', 'opinion', 'one', 'few', 'solid', 'masterpieces', 'new', 'millennia.Yang', 'passed', 'away', 'end', 'June', 'creative', 'presence', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'missed', 'unfortunate', 'coincidence', 'one', 'major', 'quality', 'film', 'autumnal', 'feel', 'elaborate', 'narrative', 'Chekhovian', 'richness', 'length', 'very', 'captivating', 'film', 'varied', 'characters', 'engage', 'backward', 'glances', 'lives', 'primarily', 'form', 'self-interrogations', 'regrets', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'consequences', 'ill-informed', 'actions', 'leading', 'up', 'certain', 'resignation', 'forgiveness', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dramatic', 'extremely', 'varied', 'male', 'characters', 'several', 'whom', 'patriarch', 'N.J.', 'precocious', 'son', 'Yang-Yang', 'Japanese', 'colleague', 'Ota', 'are', 'essentially', 'poets', 'philosophers', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'corporate', 'lives', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'entirely', 'satisfying.YI', 'YI', 'wedding', 'funeral', 'slice', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'expansive', 'film', 'humanism', 'character', 'detail', 'evocative', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'kind', 'tightly', 'choreographed', 'sprawl', 'one', 'would', 'associate', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'large', 'number', 'scenes', 'Yang', 'pose', 'intricate', 'questions', 'leading', 'gradual', 'upward', 'modulation', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'end', 'film', 'Yang', 'wisely', 'feel', 'selected', 'several', 'non-actors', 'major', 'roles', 'here', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'writers', 'mostly', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'great', 'deal', 'immediacy', 'little', 'amateurisness', 'perceptible', 'Yang', 'penchant', 'incorporating', 'incidental', 'scene', 'material', 'symbolic', 'elements', 'shooting', 'windows', 'mirrors', 'using', 'reflections', 'undescore', 'emotional', 'points', 'breathtaking', 'several', 'points', 'watch', 'heartbeat', 'one', 'extraordinary', 'mostly', 'non-verbal', 'scene', 'combination', 'such', 'strong', 'sense', 'visual', 'improvisation', 'rather', 'intricate', 'literary', 'narrative', 'unusual', 'quite', 'N.J.', 'Yang-Yang', 'stand', 'pivotal', 'characters', 'Yang-Yang', 'clarifying', 'emotional', 'center', 'what', 'characters', 'film', 'fumble', 'towards', 'what', 'Edward', 'Yang', 'far', 'more', 'virtuosity', 'also', 'sought', 'do', 'When', 'grow', 'up', 'want', 'tell', 'things', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'stuff', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'great', 'rich', 'film.-David', 'Alston']",Yi Yi: A One and a Two
574880,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000059TON,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","In Taiwan, filmmaker Edward Yang is one of the highly revered filmmakers known for his part in the new Taiwan cinema movement and he is also a filmmaker who passed at a young age.  Having created wonderful films such as ""A Brighter Summer Day"", ""Taipei Story"", ""A Confucian Confusion"" and ""Mahjong"", it is his final feature length film ""Yi Yi"" that continues to capture the hearts of cineaste worldwide.The 2000 film earned Yang a ""Best Director"" award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and nominated for a P'alme d'Or and a multi-award winning film worldwide.  Even earning the distinction of British film magazine ""Sight and Sound"" as one of the ""Ten Greatest Films in the Past 25 Years"".""Yi Yi"" is a film that focuses around a Taipei Jian family coming from three perspectives. One from husband and father NJ (played by Nien-Jen Wu), the second from his young son Yang-Yang (played by Jonathan Chang) and the other is his teenage daughter Ting-Ting (played by Kelly Lee).The film begins with a wedding ceremony for NJ's younger brother Ah-Di, a man who was dating a businesswoman but got a young woman pregnant and so he is getting married.  Ah-Di owes his brother NJ money but NJ is in no hurry to collect it, knowing that his brother probably will not pay it off in time.  We see Ah-Di's ex-girlfriend come to pay a visit and apologize to NJ's mother-in-law, an older woman and to show her disatisfaction that Ah-Di got another woman pregnant and is marrying her instead.NJ's mother-in-law is not feeling well, so she is taken back home and later collapses.  For NJ's grandmother, her hospitalization effects the family as NJ's wife realizes how much her mother is important to the family.  As for Ting-Ting, she was always close to her grandmother and is often by her side.  For little Yang-Yang, he doesn't understand quite well of what is going on but he is not a talkative person and rarely communicated with his grandmother.But despite the health of NJ's mother-in-law, the wife Min-Min (played by Elaine Jin) insists in staying at the hospital, meanwhile NJ and his son Yang-Yang attends Ah-Di's wedding at the hotel.  And NJ runs into his ex-girlfriend Sherry (played by Su-Yun Ko), a professional who right off the bat asks what happened to him as he just disappeared from their relationship.  Before they can talk, they are disrupted and life continues the following morning.This is where the story showcases the three family members.  As NJ's wife leaves for a Bhuddist Retreat after having a midlife crisis, she takes off while NJ takes care of the kids.  For NJ, he works at a company in which they are trying to build a partnership for Japanese video game company.  So, his boss, wants him to meet the Japanese employees and build a relationship but he knows that his company, specifically his boss, only cares about the money.  Interesting enough, when NJ meets the Japanese software boss, Ota (played by Issei Ogata), he is surprised that Ota talks to him only in English but he realizes how this man is quite honest and good-natured, very different from the type of people he is used to working with.  Meanwhile, because he has to go to Japan and do business, his ex-girlfriend Sherry is going as well.  So, the trip to Japan will be an intriguing experience for NJ as he resolves the past with his ex, while preparing for the future with his potential new business partner, Ota.For Ting-Ting, she is very close to her grandmother and often visits her.  At the same time, each time she goes out to her apartment balcony, she sees her best friend together with a young man named Fatty.  She is intrigued by their romance but quickly sees it diminish and soon after, seeing her with another guy.  As for Fatty, he uses Ting-Ting as a go-between to send messages to his ex-girlfriend but during the process, both Ting-Ting and Fatty become closer and eventually setting up her first date together with him.  But being inexperienced as she is, can she have a nurturing relationship with her best friend's ex-boyfriend?As for the younger son, Yang-Yang, he is often the boy that tends to be a little mischievous and gets into trouble at school.  He is often seen playing tricks on girls but the truth is, it's because he gets ganged up by them and they play practical jokes on him.  But his father has given him a film camera and told him to take pictures to document mosquitoes exist in the hallways of their house and to also document other things with his camera.  Taking pictures becomes a passion for Yang-Yang, but the problem is that he will leave school during class to pick up film for his camera (not knowing the school has cameras everywhere).  For Yang-Yang, he then starts to develop a passion for taking pictures of the back of people's heads.""Yi Yi"" is a film that begins with a wedding, ends with a funeral but eloquently shows us life changing moments for these three individuals.  In director's Edward Yang's words, ""Yi Yi"" is a film about life, portrayed across a spectrum of its span.  ""Yi Yi"" which means ""one one"" or ""individually"", is a film's portrayal of life through each individual member.VIDEO:""Yi Yi"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  And first let me preface with how much this film's beautiful cinematography has struck a chord within me.  Watching it years ago and then watching it now on Blu-ray, from the tracking shots as NJ is riding in the car and we see the buildings go by, to the shots of NJ eating at burger joint with his song Yang-Yang, the shot of NJ sitting at the corner as you see the city from the windows or scenes where people are walking and there is perfect symmetry with the trees and the people.  By typing this, it may not seem right because ""Yi Yi"" is one of those films that has to be viewed, watched and simply letting the moving images capture you.Wei-han Yang does a wonderful job in capturing the location, the angles that Edward Yang has in his mind.  ""Yi Yi"" is a visual masterpiece as it manages to capture life for a family and its surroundings are presented in great care, great harmony and I was left wanting to watch it again because the film captures life and death so beautifully.With that said, ""Yi Yi"", according to the Criterion Collection, features a digital transfer created from a Spirit 4K Datacine from a 35mm interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.The Blu-ray does look much better than its DVD counterpart as expected, with more detail that can be seen in objects, clarity during outdoor sequences. There was one scene that had some artifacts but it's only a few seconds long.  I asked another fellow reviewer if he saw it and was told that it may be due to the DVNR correction but other than that, picture quality for the film is very good and a solid improvement over the 2006 Criterion Collection DVD release.Considering that around world, there have been some really bad print transfers of the film, this Blu-ray release of ""Yi Yi"" is still a very good release and I saw no other blemishes and for the most part, fans of ""Yi Yi"" should be happy with this release because if you thought the film's cinematography looked incredible, it helps to have in HD to see more of the details of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Yi Yi"" is presented in Mandarin 2.0 Surround.  Dialogue is clear and I actually preferred to watch this film with stereo on all channels and setting that on my receiver for a more immersive soundtrack. as one of my favorite scenes was with NJ being affected when he hears his Japanese associate playing ""Moonlight Sonata"" on the piano.  But overall, dialogue is crystal clear.According to the Criterion Collection, the 2.0 surround soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the original 2-track left and right magnetic master.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Yi Yi - The Criterion Collection #339' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by writer/director Edward Yang and Asian-cinema critic Tony Rayns.  While Tony Rayns talks about the context of the film, Edward Yang explains to viewers certain situations, especially situations that were taking place during that time period that he shot the film.  Also, both discuss certain scenes in which would be uncommon in Taiwanese culture but looked differently from a Western perspective.  A wonderful audio commentary.* Toni Rayns - (15:18) An enjoyable and intriguing featurette in which Asian cinema critic Tony Rayns discusses the New Taiwan cinema movement and talks about the industry, the emergence of Edward Yang and Hsiao-hsien Hou and its similarity and differences from Nouvelle Vague.* Trailer - (1:52) The theatrical trailer for ""Yi Yi"".EXTRAS:Included is a 22-page booklet featuring ""Time and Space"" by Kent Jones (essay was originally on the Criterion Collection 2006 DVD release) and ""Notes from Edward Yang"" on the title and on casting.JUDGMENT CALL:""Yi Yi"" is a film that if you look online to read of what cineaste have posted, you will find those who see the film as a masterpiece and visually magnificent.  You will also read messages from those who feel the 173 was way too much for them and that the film was too mundane.  Needless to say, its a film that depends on the viewer.But if you are a viewer who searches deeply for cinema that is clear from the typical banality of contrived storylines about family issues, then ""Yi Yi"" is a film that you will truly enjoy.  For me, almost similar to how Yasuhiro Ozu has captured me with his oeuvre, Edward Yang's ""Yi Yi"" resonated with me quite strongly because the screenplay felt natural.  As if you knew these characters and know these issues can happen to anyone.  It's also because of casting, where Yang trusted his actor Nien-Jen Wu to play the father/husband NJ, he hired unknowns who don't have an acting background, so they gave a performance that felt natural, nor overacted.While Ting-Ting embodies the teenager discovering romance, Yang-Yang shows us innocent and mischievous behavior, but yet you feel like rooting for him because he is typically a kid that is constantly picked on.Combine this with cinematography from Wei-han Yang and the directorial brain of Edward Yang and this collaboration brings us an artistic style that truly touches your soul.  There is no doubt that Edward Yang has a great eye and his films do exhibit an Antonioni-esque style when it comes to presentation.  But his writing, call it existential cinema, does bring an ethereal quality to it.  But unlike Antonioni films, Yang's ""Yi Yi"" is a bit more accessible to the non-critical viewer.  It is easy to follow but it depends what you are following.As for the Blu-ray release, the same special features that were included on the 2006 DVD release, does make its way back for the Blu-ray release. But as mentioned before, this is the best looking version of ""Yi Yi"" yet.  This release has had not-so-great transfer from Winstar and Starmax and this Blu-ray looks much better than its 2006 Criterion DVD counterpart.  But I also find Criterion Collection's ""Yi Yi"" quite special because of its audio commentary and the fact that it was recorded and released a year before Wang's death.  So, I'm so grateful that we do get this audio commentary featuring Edward Yang.Overall, the efficacy of ""Yi Yi"" is one's ability to understand the story and how Yang is able to capture the beauty, the sadness of life and death through his film.  But to also see what you get out of the film's magnificent cinematography.  Structured shots, Yang's use of balance but yet capturing the feel of Taipei through its various shots and in someways capturing the feel of a growing metropolis and in someways reminding me of Jacques Tati's ""Playtime"" which says goodbye to the old, ushering in the new.  But all one can do is move forward.If you have never watched or owned ""Yi Yi"" before, and if you have and thoroughly enjoyed it, then I highly recommend this film.  It's definitely a must-own Criterion Collection release!",5,"If there is one film that embodies life and death so beautifully, ""Yi Yi"" is that film.  Yi Yi"" is highly recommended!",1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,12367,"['Taiwan', 'filmmaker', 'Edward', 'Yang', 'one', 'highly', 'revered', 'filmmakers', 'known', 'part', 'new', 'Taiwan', 'cinema',

It starts at a wedding and ends at a funeral, and packed in the middle is a story of a Taipei family, each reacting to different crises in their lives.Clocking at almost 3 hours, you may find this movie a bit long and slow at times, but I absolutely loved every minute of this movie, because all the stories are told with such patience and subtlety. Edward Yang (the director/writer) also does a wonderful job with character development, and while you may struggle to figure out who's who in the beginning of the movie, you will no doubt get to know and care about each member of the troubled Jiang family by the end of the movie.&quot;Yi Yi&quot; will make you cry and it will make you laugh.

574882,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000059TON,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This Taiwanese film is fascinating for us westerners because of the vision it gives of love and women in Chinese society. Love has a wider meaning than what we generally comprehend with this word. It is not only love for a woman or a man with a sentimental or sexual intention, but it is the basic human dimension of society. This is very true in the revealing dimension the coma of the grand mother takes in the family circle and the impossibility for everyone to speak to that comatose woman in spite of the love the various members do feel for her. The conclusion of the film, the love declaration of the little son, but after the death of the grandmother, is a real illumination about how love is an exchange of experience, and the little boy can feel old because he exchanges his age with his grandmother's and hence regenerates her in her own death. But this love, within a couple, becomes the revealing element of the frustrations and expectations of the woman who is finding her liberation, hence her possible realization as a free being in this love relation. On the side of the boy or man, there is a fear, the fear to be in a way enslaved, reduced to a state of non-liberty by this very love. And yet the father discovers through the meeting of an old girl-friend of his he ran away from not to become the slave of her willfulness that he did what she wanted him to do which became the reason of his flight. Hence love becomes a mirror in which there is a perfect exchange of motivations and visions : she sees him like this and this becomes his perspective, and vice versa. This leads us to the conclusion that real love is a double mirror in which each lover falls mutually and simultaneously. This double mirror is both fascinating and disturbing. Are we living in a gallery of mirrors where the mirrors are our own neighbors for whom we are one mirror among others ? And this is amplified by the little boy who is obsessed by the fact that we can only see one side of a person at the time and never see the other side at the same time. We are both witnesses and blind people since we can both see and not see at the same time. In, other words seeing something means not seeing something else. This entertwining of vision and blindness, along with mirror ghosts that are what we see brings us to a really Chinese experience : remember the proverb about a finger showing the moon and what an idiot will do : look at the finger and miss the moon. But is the one who sees the moon and misses the finger more intelligent ?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,We only see one side of things and people,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,2553,"['Taiwanese', 'film', 'fascinating', 'westerners', 'vision', 'love', 'women', 'Chinese', 'society', 'Love', 'wider', 'meaning', 'what', 'generally', 'comprehend', 'word', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'woman', 'man', 'sentimental', 'sexual', 'intention', 'basic', 'human', 'dimension', 'society', 'very', 'true', 'revealing', 'dimension', 'coma', 'grand', 'mother', 'family', 'circle', 'impossibility', 'everyone', 'speak', 'comatose', 'woman', 'spite', 'love', 'various', 'members', 'do', 'feel', 'conclusion', 'film', 'love', 'declaration', 'little', 'son', 'death', 'grandmother', 'real', 'illumination', 'how', 'love', 'exchange', 'experience', 'little', 'boy', 'can', 'feel', 'old', 'exchanges', 'age', 'grandmother', 'hence', 'own', 'death', 'love', 'couple', 'revealing', 'element', 'frustrations', 'expectations', 'woman', 'who', 'finding', 'liberation', 'hence', 'possible', 'realization', 'free', 'being', 'love', 'relation', 'side', 'boy', 'man', 'fear', 'fear', 'be', 'way', 'enslaved', 'reduced', 'state', 'non-liberty', 'very', 'love', 'yet', 'father', 'meeting', 'old', 'girl-friend', 'ran', 'away', 'not', 'become', 'slave', 'willfulness', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'became', 'reason', 'flight', 'Hence', 'love', 'mirror', 'perfect', 'exchange', 'motivations', 'visions', 'perspective', 'vice', 'versa', 'conclusion', 'real', 'love', 'double', 'mirror', 'lover', 'mutually', 'simultaneously', 'double', 'mirror', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'Are', 'living', 'gallery', 'mirrors', 'where', 'mirrors', 'are', 'own', 'neighbors', 'whom', 'are', 'one', 'mirror', 'others', 'amplified', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'obsessed', 'fact', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'side', 'person', 'time', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'witnesses', 'blind', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'see', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'seeing', 'something', 'not', 'seeing', 'something', 'else', 'entertwining', 'vision', 'blindness', 'mirror', 'ghosts', 'are', 'what', 'see', 'brings', 'really', 'Chinese', 'experience', 'remember', 'proverb', 'finger', 'showing', 'moon', 'what', 'idiot', 'will', 'do', 'look', 'finger', 'miss', 'moon', 'one', 'who', 'moon', 'finger', 'more', 'intelligent', 'Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Yi Yi: A One and a Two
574883,A2N2S9PPHMW016,B000059TON,JDavid,"[3, 3]","""Yi Yi""  is a brilliant Taiwanese film that chronicles the seeming dissolution but eventual restoration of the Jiang family.  The premise of the story is that the ill health of the grandmother/mother of the family exposes the weakness and strain that each character faces.  Beneath the facade of the intact family, each member strays along a path that is both solitary and unrelated to the rest of family life and that threatens the future integrity of the family itself.The father NJ runs into an old sweetheart Sherry, ostensibly the one great love of his life, and is tempted to not only enter into an affair but possibly even abandon his family.  The mother Min-Min sees her life as meaningless and empty due to the shock of her mother's condition and retreats to a Buddhist monastery for restoration.  Ting-Ting, the lovely teenage daughter, gets involved in a potentially harmful love triangle through her friendship with a troubled next-door neighbor.  Little Yang-Yang, the son, navigates the trials of school life with his new camera.The adult characters are so focused on their own problems and desires that they are either unable to do much for the others around them, principally the grandmother, or are  oblivious to how much their energy and attention are needed elsewhere.  Ting-Ting and Yang-Yang both need their parents' active involvement, protection and guidance, yet the parents are too absorbed in their own needs to be much more than parents in title only.The film depicts how perilously close the Jiangs come to tragedy, but how at the seeming brink of familial disintegration, a strong underlying commitment to family touched by a hint of supernatural intervention (Ting-Ting's last conversation with her grandmother), brings the parents at least back to their senses and commitments.  Life remains painful, mysterious, and unpredictable, but the Jiangs are drawn back to each other in the end.  The film ends with the funeral for the grandmother.  If she was the rock that held the family together prior to her illness, now they will be able to survive her loss.  Little Yang Yang speaks out what is probably the film's deepest message, the longing to understand what happens to our loved ones after death.""Yi Yi"" is a profound film in many respects and it would require several viewings do it justice.  But even after one viewing I came away moved and impressed with its eloquent argument for human responsibility, celebration of family, and its mature and universal moral gravity.  I am puzzled and pleased that the film has been lionized by critics and the international film world, folks who usually are pushing for excuses for us to abandon our families, break our vows, and worship self above all else.  That ""Yi Yi"" moved many to consider another approach is a testimony to its artistry and intelligence.

574884,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,B000059TON,Jeremy Heilman,"[4, 6]","Ed Yang's Yi Yi (A One and a Two) is an excellent family drama (certainly miles ahead of such films as &quot;Tortilla Soup&quot; or &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;) but it's a three hours long, and not quite as profound as it thinks it is. Most of the film's annoying sermonizing comes from a young boy character. He is wise beyond his years to the point that his character is not at all believeable.Once you get past that character (who is only one of about a dozen well-drawn characters in the ensemble) the film has a great deal to offer. The film's pacing is not really that leisurely, and the time spent watching it isn't wasted time. The director opts to direct most scenes with a nearly static camera. Long takes are the norm. This is fine, but it may require an initial stylistic adjustment for some (I am used to watching films by Carl Dreyer and Hou Hsiao-Hsien so I have a temperment for this sort of work).The film will probably surprise you with its accessibility, however. The lives of the people in Taiwan are not very different from the lives of Americans. The humor and drama on display is universal. The film doesn't feel foreign at all. My main reservation would be that the film's transfer to DVD somewhat reduces the film's impact. The still camera and relative lack of closeups means some of the details and emotions of the actors might be difficult to see depending on your television.

To present a work that goes on for almost 3 hours, and never see one truthful moment until the end -- which turned out to be pure cliche, by the way -- was excruciating. Yet the actors did a tremendous job with what they had. And, The film calls to mind Kieslowski as the theme is subtly reflected in the film technique as well as dialogue. Unfortunately the good elements are wasted with all of the over-long scenes where the characters are not allowed to take their actions through to their logical conclusion.

Yi Yi has been bemoaned as Yang's concession to mainstream audiences (after a career of making formally rigorous, &quot;difficult&quot; works), though that assumes that an artist should spend his career in one mode. The softening of Yang's style - which actually began with his two &quot;comedies&quot; in the mid-90s - is not necessarily a bad thing. Yang's formally challenging work reached its apex with the brilliant &quot;A Brighter Summer Day.&quot; &quot;Yi~~ Yi&quot; is an epic-length work of an altogether different kind - not a &quot;selling out&quot; per se, but the work of someone who has perhaps come to see the world in a less despairing light (though &quot;Yi Yi&quot; certainly contains much sadness and disappointment). It is a brilliant film and justly acclaimed, and unlike &quot;Brighter Day,&quot; it's a film I would recommend to those who don't necessarily go in for &quot;demanding&quot; or &quot;arty&quot; fare despite its runtime.The Fox Lorber DVD is a shame, as~~ has been noted several times, though its value lies in the director's commentary (ah, the wonderful thing about laserdiscs and DVDs: the possibility of capturing the words of the artist) rather than the poor presentation. I recommend people who really love this movie to SEEK OUT THE KOREAN DVD, which is easily found on any websites that specialize in Asian imports. It is a far superior transfer to the U.S. release and also, from what I understand, a step up on the Hong Kong disc.~",5,one by ed yang,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,1536,"['~I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'much', 'film', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'Yi', 'Yi', 'been', 'bemoaned', 'Yang', 'concession', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'career', 'making', 'formally', 'rigorous', 'quot', 'difficult', 'quot', 'works', 'artist', 'should', 'spend', 'career', 'one', 'mode', 'softening', 'Yang', 'style', 'actually', 'began', 'two', 'quot', 'comedies', 'quot', 'mid-90s', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Yang', 'formally', 'challenging', 'work', 'reached', 'apex', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'A', 'Brighter', 'Summer', 'Day.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yi~~', 'Yi', 'quot', 'epic-length', 'work', 'altogether', 'different', 'kind', 'not', 'quot', 'selling', 'out', 'quot', 'se', 'work', 'someone', 'who', 'perhaps', 'come', 'see', 'world', 'less', 'despairing', 'light', 'quot', 'Yi', 'Yi', 'quot', 'certainly', 'much', 'sadness', 'disappointment', 'brilliant', 'film', 'justly', 'acclaimed', 'quot', 'Brighter', 'Day', 'quot', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'go', 'quot', 'demanding', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'runtime.The', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'DVD', 'shame', 'as~~', 'been', 'noted', 'several', 'times', 'value', 'director', 'commentary', 'ah', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'laserdiscs', 'DVDs', 'possibility', 'capturing', 'words', 'artist', 'rather', 'poor', 'presentation', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'SEEK', 'OUT', 'THE', 'KOREAN', 'DVD', 'easily', 'found', 'websites', 'specialize', 'Asian', 'imports', 'far', 'superior', 'transfer', 'U.S.', 'release', 'also', 'what', 'understand', 'step', 'up', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'disc.~']",Yi Yi: A One and a Two
574888,A22PBUV0TICYGO,B000059TON,"Kuroneko1 ""kuroneko1""","[5, 6]","Yi yi is a very good family drama which is made in Taiwan.First of all, a Taiwanese film needs a patience. In yi yi however you really need it because it is 3 hours long and it is a drama movie. But by no means it is a boring movie. When you look at it deeply, it is actually very very good and easily competes with films like ""happiness"". Characters are like real, next door people and issues are common things which we always witness in real life. Every character has its own story with sub stories but connected to central story which strangely is not as diverse. Location is Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan and an important city in asian business world. Movie starts with a family wedding as well as the grandmother ending up in coma.Father of the house is troubled with worsening business and dishonest business life. He meets his ex lover after 30 years and starts to questions his life and especially his past. His wife leaves for mountain for asking gods help for her mother in coma.His Causin has financial problems and newly married .His daughter is a lonely teenager who starts to feel her adolesence coming up to her and his son is an intelligent cute boy with the quest of finding the reality. Neighbours, ex lovers , friends, business partners are all parts of this film. Like a huge puzzle they are all fit in and make this movie worth watching.Director questions us with our obsession of loosing  ""past chances"". His characters think about their lifes and past choices but in the end , answer comes as nothing much changes as long as we are the same people.What is gonna happen is gonna happen he says with the camera. He also questions the reality in our lives, how we actually look and how we feel. His criticisms on our modern life is shown in aspects like religion ,sex,education,corrupt dealings in business  etc with excellent but short sequences.Also the lives of the young ones are similar to the past experiences of the elder. Father's first date with his ex lover has many similar things with her daughters first date . Interestingly, Grandma is the central character here since she is in coma and every member of the family comes and talks to her about their troubles,mistakes and everyday life.Stories and incidents are gathered in her. She cant reply but hear, making members of the family to confess and story pieces to come together. ncidents and stories start with her loss of consciessness and finish with her. She acts as a kind of buddha in the house, probably not given enough attention when she was well.Overall Yi yi is a very good film about life,relationships,past and inner feelings. It is definitely not a soap opera. Rather, a very good as well as a realistic family drama without strange unearthly characters and miraculous happenings as well as unnecessary dirty sex which we witness in some indie movies.This is actually our lives on screen.

What a breath of fresh air this movie is by giving us a glimpse of a typical family life in Taipei, Taiwan.  After viewing the movie, you might tell yourself that what characters are going through &amp; have gone through are actually not so different from your day to day predicaments.  This is life as it is, my friends.  Here, NJ, the husband was given a window opportunity to relive his youth &amp; in the end, he discovered that if he were to relive his life again, his life wouldn't change for the better.  His wife felt that she lived a Ground Hog's Day.  There's a sense of emptiness within her but after coming home from her meditation, she discovered that her life was just as before.  The doting daughter lived an idealistic life &amp; she got a rude awakening by befriending her neighbour's daughter &amp; got a reality check by falling in love at a tender age.  The grandmother would be the pivot in the movie.  She suffered stroke early in the story &amp; all the characters took their turns talking to her, just as Catholics went searching for forgiveness &amp; redemption in the confession box.  Then, there was NJ's brother who was a loser, who had relationships all tangled up in loose ends &amp; undoubtedly, causing conflicts between the present wife &amp; the ex.  There was also the business dealing between NJ &amp; a Japanese businessman &amp; software programmer by the name of Ota.  They emphatised for one another immediately.  There were many tender &amp; stolen moments in this movie, where thoughts &amp; emotions were spoken even without usage of words.  As always, we saved the best for last, &amp; NJ's younger son who spoke few words emerged to be the wise one among them all.  His wisdom was displayed in the pictures that he took.  He commented candidly to his dad the reason why he took pictures of people's rear heads was that people weren't able to see half of themselves.  He thought that he was doing people a great favour by revealing to them what they weren't able to see.  The movie was brought to a satisfied conclusion when he read his thoughts aloud to his grandmother in her funeral why he didn't speak to her when she was unconscious.  He reasoned that words needn't be spoken when hearts already knew the answers.  A movie that is so simple &amp; yet, so complicated.  It's so direct &amp; yet, so subtle.  A very well-done movie that's satisfying to watch from beginning till end despite its three hours length.  A must-see &amp; highly recommended.  Life is as it is.

574896,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000059TON,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[0, 1]","If you like the domestic dramas of Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu, you'll love this film about an extended family in Taipei, Taiwan. Like Ozu, the style is almost static, the unmoving camera often far from the action, across the room, outside a window, even across the street. Scenes play out in long takes, sometimes slowly, characters often hanging on in quiet desperation until there is a sudden outburst from one of them. At the center of the story is a middle-aged business man with an absent wife, a teenage daughter, a pint-size son with a camera, and a comatose mother who has suffered a severe stroke. Colleagues at the man's company consider taking on a business partner, a Japanese man given to philosophizing, and on a trip to Tokyo he meets up with an old girlfriend from school days - also married.At home, his daughter has befriended a neighbor girl and her tentative and puzzling boyfriend, while his young son stalks a young girl who likes to go swimming alone and takes pictures of the backs of people's heads. There are other characters on the periphery with problems of their own - including a brother who waits for a lucky day to marry his pregnant girlfriend.

If it wasn't for hilarious dialogues and a few ironic moments i.e. the baby-shower that turns into a fight or the brother-in-law failed suicide attempt, the movie would have been a little boring. The actors which I enjoyed watching most were the brother-in-law and the little boy : perhaps because both never acted before, they were quite funny and spontaneous. I personally wasn't impressed by the other main characters' acting: I thought they lacked charisma on the screen.

574898,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B000059TON,Suzanne,"[10, 10]","OVERVIEW & STORY:This review is intended to be part critical analysis and part celebratory love letter to a film that's a genuine modern masterpiece of cinema. Writer/Director Edward Yang's Yi Yi is as close to a ""perfect"" film as I've seen; warm, funny, humane, poignant, beautiful, evocative, and expertly crafted in every sense of the word.For those who don't know, Edward Yang is a part of the New Wave of Taiwanese Cinema, along with other acclaimed directors like Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-Liang. These directors all share some similarities; One is a consistent use of precise framing and static long takes. This technique might be most famously utilized by legendary Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu. The comparison is even more apt than that as all of these directors applied their technique to subjects dealing with people in changing societies. Their films perfectly capture the zeitgeist and work equally well as social commentary, historical documents, and film-art.At its simplest, Yi Yi is a portrait of a middle-class family in Taipei dealing with (as one reviewer stated) ""romantic, economic and spiritual upheaval."" But if the idea itself is simple and mundane, its execution is complex and incredibly rich. To even attempt a plot summary is difficult, though I will try.The film opens with the marriage of Ah-Di to a pregnant Hsiao-Yen. This is interrupted by Yun-Yun, Ah-Di's ex girlfriend and current business partner. Ah-Di's brother-in-law is NJ, - the central character, if indeed you can apply that title to any here -  a loving father and husband caught in a crossroads in his life; at his work when he is coaxed into befriending a possible business partner in Mr. Ota, and personally when he runs into his first love, Sherry, at Ah-Di's wedding. NJ's wife, Min-Min, is caught up in a spiritual crisis when after the wedding an accident sends her mother to the hospital, and eventually home with the family to take care of. This accident is even more distressing to Ting-Ting - NJ's and Men-Men's teenage daughter - who feels the accident is her fault for forgetting to take out the garbage. Ting-Ting becomes quick friends with the neighbor girl, Li-Li, whose family is having problems of their own, and whose boyfriend, Fatty, becomes a source of contention between the two girls. Finally, there's little Yang-Yang, NJ and Men-Men's young son, who provides a great deal of the humor and profundity throughout the film with his imagination and child-like honesty.REVIEW:If the above plot synopsis sounds convoluted and unwieldy, then place the blame on my summary instead of Yang's film. If I had to choose one aspect of this film which succeeds above the others it would be Yang's handling and crafting of the narrative which is so adept that the film never makes one feel it's as complex as it actually is. Though the film is constantly shifting between characters and storylines, the transitions appear seamless. Part of this can be attributed to the editing,  which is smooth and extremely unobtrusive, and part of it is due to the aesthetic and emotional flow which perfectly connects scenes and characters together like a fine silk.When looking at the narrative and characters as a whole it's difficult to find any negatives. Yi Yi is one of the greatest films I know of about ordinary people. It's not just the fact that Yang refuses to hype the characters or their reality, but it's the breadth and depth that's given to both in all the superficial simplicity. One review of Ozu's legendary Tokyo Story mentioned that it was ""a film that encompasses so much of the viewer's life, that you are convinced that you have been in the presence of someone who you knew very well."" and the same could be applied to Yi Yi. By the end, we get to know these characters almost as real people instead of fictional creations. The same could be said of the narrative which, despite the difference in societies and cultures features characters dealing with problems that plague us all; whether it's NJ's frustration with his failing job, or his nostalgic attempt to recapture a piece of his life that faded long ago, or Men-Men's frustration with her dull, repetitive everyday life that compels her to seek out spiritual fulfillment. Even the children are easy to relate to, with Ting-Ting decision of whether or not to sleep with Fatty for the first time, or Yang Yang's ability to capture a piece of childish imagination and innocence lost to us all. If I had to find a single flaw it might be that the Ah-Di, Hsiao-Yen, Yun-Yun storyline isn't as compelling when compared with the others. It's by no means ""bad"", but its weakness perhaps lies in the fact that they are the least developed characters in the lot.Beyond the narrative and characters Yang's themes are as rich as anything else in the film. On the simplest level Yi Yi works to reveal the effect of society on modern people and families and vice versa. However, Yang is less insistent on the import of his themes compared to the likes of Hou Hsiao-hsien. If Hou's films actively explore the state of Taiwanese society, then Yi Yi seeks only to observe, but not comment too deeply. It's this lack of force that prevents the criticism of pretentiousness from ever applying to the film.Yi Yi is also a film of wonderful moments and scenes. One such scene is of Yang-Yang in AV class, watching the girl he's infatuated with as thunder and lightning play on the screen behind her with the apt subject of ""two opposing forces coming together"". Another is the masterful montage of Ting-Ting's date with Fatty, paralleled by the dialogue and scene of NJ and Sherry's `reunion'. Yet another features NJ and Mr. Ota discussing their love for music. Other moments are so small they might go unnoticed, such as the simple shot of Ting-Ting entering her grandma's bedroom and grasping her hand, or the musical montage of a vision of Tokyo. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Yang-Yang's closing monologue. It's a scene so poignant and so perfect that it has instantly become one of my absolute favorites. In a film full of superb scenes it's a testament to Edward Yang's greatness that he was able to close on the most cathartic of all.The acting is consistently superb. Even though Nien-Jen Wu (NJ) is perhaps the most accomplished, it's hard to find a weak spot in the cast. Issea Ogata (Mr. Ota) steals most every scene he's in with his exuberance. Elaine Jin (Min-Min) has a couple of tough, extended, emotional monologues and without the aid of editing she pulls them off marvelously and believably in a single take. Kelly Lee (Ting-Ting) brings a sense of subdued emotional subtlety that's indicative of skill far beyond her years. Jonathan Chang (Yang-Yang) practically steals the whole film with the straight-forward honesty he brings to the role of Yang-Yang. He's not adorable in the horribly fake, classic ""precocious child"" manner, but in a way that's much more truthful to the spirit and purity of childhood.Yang's direction is masterful and quietly understated. He rarely attempts to draw attention to the camera, and it would be easy for the wealth of incredible shots to go unnoticed. One particularly unique technique is Yang's use of reflective surfaces. This has a remarkable effect of expanding the audience's field of vision, so often we're not only able to follow the story, but get a feel for the environment that's such a crucial aspect of any film. Other times it serves as a source of economy, allowing Yang to capture a scene with as little movement as possible. Beyond the mere shots, the editing is phenomenal. Yang expertly utilizes transitional devices to weave the diverging strands of his complex narrative together. One perfect example is the AV room ""storm"" film with Yang-Yang transitioning to Ting-Ting caught in a real storm. While devices like this may seem banal, it's the fact that they're never pronounced in a pretentious manner that allows them to serve the film and narrative rather than distract from it. One particularly brilliant narrative device is the comatose grandmother, which after being prompted by the doctors to talk to her the family takes turns revealing their innermost secrets and fears to her and the audience as well. Yang also puts a lot of trust in his actors by liberally utilizing long takes, such as NJ and Sherry's hotel meeting. Finally, Yang presents most of the film in a very patient manner. While he doesn't maintain as much narrative perspective distance from events as some of his contemporaries, he does often use a somewhat voyeuristic style that observes but doesn't attempt to actively involve. This often has the effect of capturing the environment which can speak as powerfully about a scene as what's happening in the story. Two obvious examples are Ting-Ting and Fatty's meeting at night near the road, and NJ and Sherry's meeting in the park. Yang's overall visual aesthetic of one of calm, meditative, and patient observance; certainly the opposite aesthetic of the common, modern ADD riddled Hollywood.One final remarkable accomplishment I'll mention is how despite the near 3 hour runtime it almost feels too short. There are very few lengthy films I know of that have ever pulled of that trick; one is Kurosawa's incomparable The Seven Samurai, and that is indeed fine company to be in. As the credits rolled, I kept thinking how nice it would be to have spent more time in this world with these people. It's not that Yang doesn't provide a resolution; it's merely that the film is such a perfectly crafted world you might not want to leave.Sadly, Edward Yang died June 29, 2007 from his long bout with colon cancer. He left behind a handful of masterpieces, including this film, A Brighter Summer Day and Mahjong. In closing I'll reiterate what I said in the opening: Yi Yi: A One and a Two is a genuine masterpiece from one of cinema's greatest and most unsung masters. All I can do is give it my highest recommendation and hope that more people discover one of the strongest candidates for best film of the 21st Century. It's one of those films that celebrates life, and will perhaps make you appreciative of the life you live and the people and places in it. Yi Yi has quickly become one of my absolute favorites and I only wish I could heap enough eloquent superlatives on it to reveal the greatness of this truly brilliant film.DVD REVIEW:As per usual, the Criterion edition is magnificent. After renting and falling in love with the film in the Fox Lorber edition I immediately bought the Criterion Edition and was stunned by the increase in quality. The visual transfer is pristine and perfect, but it's really the extras that should prompt a fan of the film to pick it up. The audio commentary by Yang and Tony Rayns is insightful and adds even more richness to an already gorgeous tapestry. The rest of the extras are equally welcomed, including Rayns's excellent interview where he discusses the New Wave of Taiwanese Cinema and Yang's importance in the movement as well as the extensive booklet essay.",5,"""Maybe We Only See Half of the Truth""",1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,11077,"['OVERVIEW', 'STORY', 'review', 'intended', 'be', 'part', 'critical', 'analysis', 'part', 'celebratory',

The gap between what you are expected to be by the society and what you expect yourself to be being part of the same society, of having a &quot;respectful&quot; life according to social conventions (i.e. having a &quot;respectable&quot; marriage, being a successful therefore repectable businessman, having a respectable consumarist behavior of sorrounding with all those &quot;respactable&quot; goods as advertised on commercials) and what you really are, what you really expect from life.It's a pitty that his two former films, MAHJONG and A CONFUCIAN CONFUSION are not available in the States. Because in many ways, YI-YI is the answer to the questions posed in these two films.Take the women in this film for instance: their &quot;sexuality&quot;--as much as they look so sexy in those China dresses and expensive clothing in vogue-- are also part of the social consumarist conventions: they &quot;sell&quot; their sexuality to obtain what they think they want, like gag of the Taiwanese the copy of the Japanese game programmer (unfortunately untranslatable), and the big boss being a &quot;feminist&quot;. Actually the Japanese guy's name &quot;Ota&quot; means &quot;big rice field&quot;, while the copy (only mentioned by name in the film) call herself &quot;Shao-Dien&quot;, meaning &quot;small rice field&quot; (Chinese and Japanese culture share the same letters so this kind of gag is made possible). It's part of the whole theme of the film which is the gap between representations (images, advetisements, the media, etc.,) and the reality, the truth. Of course, the Chinese language which has letters that does not only represent phonetics but also meanings by themsleves is very effective in that system of represetation , but I don't think these things are particulary Chinese or Asian. It's true in almost all contemporary societies; US, Europe, Japan... and of course Taiwan. Seeing this film, you'll be surprised how many Starbucks Coffee and McDonalds and Cinema complexes there are in Taipei--which makes no difference from LA or NY or Berlin or Paris or Tokyo today.The reflections that you see everywhere in this films, on reflecting surfaces of modern buildings, on windows, on TV screens, etc... are very important (and Edward Yang claims that he became aware of them only after he started shooting this film) because it suggests that the life we see may be a false one.This film is not only the best Chinese-language film ever made in the last decade, but a poignant yet gentle and touching statement about our contemporary consumer society, and how one can find the true meaning of life in it, how one can achieve a true personal freedom inspite of all those things that bind an blind us.
