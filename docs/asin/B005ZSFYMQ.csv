Total running time is right at 1 hour, but that includes several intro and outro title sequences. My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine.If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect.
