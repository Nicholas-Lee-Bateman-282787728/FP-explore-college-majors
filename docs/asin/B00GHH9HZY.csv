It started off nice and smooth, then got a little bumpy and then took one on a rollercoaster in minutes.  I like Leon and he played his part. I enjoyed the twists and turns but at the same time I kind of felt like I knew what I wanted to happen and I was very happy when it did. This is a good movie to watch with your girlfriends so you can talk about the behavior of men and enjoy that that women got it right in the end. Great movie.",5,Nice,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,472,"['Now', 'movie', 'took', 'surprise', 'started', 'off', 'nice', 'smooth', 'then', 'got', 'little', 'bumpy', 'then', 'took', 'one', 'rollercoaster', 'minutes', 'like', 'Leon', 'played', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'twists', 'turns', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'felt', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'happen', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'did', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'girlfriends', 'can', 'talk', 'behavior', 'men', 'enjoy', 'women', 'got', 'right', 'end', 'Great', 'movie']",And Then There Was You

She didn't think about how it would affect her. She didn't think about how it would change her relationships, her life. She's been hiding behind emotional walls for years. Will she ever allow the walls to come down and give true love a chance?As I watched I thought I knew what was going on with some of the characters, but I was wrong. Characters and situations were not as they appeared and that was what made this movie interesting. There were surprises - one, in particular, that I would rather not  have seen. What it showed, though, was that we can't assume just by looking at people that they aren't keeping a dirty secret. Appearances can be deceiving.There is an explicit sex scene - the only part I did not like. It took the movie to a gritty place, and even though it was brief, it was too much for me. There is also a bit of profanity. I had no problem with that.This film gives the viewer a lot to think about.
