On a positive note, the special effects are better than the original. Though 25 years later they should be. I think if this movie wasnt a remake people would like it better. Its not that bad if you put it on its own agains most modern horror films. The acting is decent and that goes a long way.BUT... this isnt its own movie. It is a remake of the classic Fog. And if you compare the two films, this one fails. Why change the story so much? Why change the characters? If you are going to remake a movie try to keep it like the first one. Dont go and change 80% of it.

And really, who better to helm a remake of one of Carpenter's films than Rupert Wainwright, the director of MC Hammer videos and the classic film Blank Check.  Man, Hollywood sure does know what its doing with horror films these days.Here's the basic plot: the town of Antonio Bay, Oregon is a peaceful little town, with Selma Blair as the DJ of the town's only radio station.  I'm immediately interested.  So over the course of a couple nights, a big fog cloud rolls into the town, and with it come spirits of ghosts from sea.  The back story behind the fog isn't all that terrible, but it is executed very poorly.  The main characters are useless tools, that we care nothing about.  In fact, we aren't even told what their relationship really is, just that Elizabeth left 6 months ago, and is ready and willing to sleep with Nick on her first night back in town.  Someone cue the fog cloud of death.I can't live with myself as a human being and recommend this film to anyone.

956131,AKH1QCEMS4ZI3,B000CCBC9E,"Adel Zeller ""grungezombie""","[5, 8]","Wow, I really can't believe how bad the reviews were for this movie. Not only here at Amazon, but at other websites and offline critcs, too! This is actually a fairly decent horror movie, when you consider it's own merits, without expecting it to be a ""carbon copy"" remake of John Carpenter's original. It's got all the horror essentials: suspense, shock, flaming corpses shooting accross the room, spooky goings-on in a small, isolated town... And compared to it's 2005 ""horror"" competition (e.g. ""Boogeyman"", ""The Dark"", ""The Cave"") it certainly belongs in the top ten of 2005 horror movies.The changes that were made to the plot and characters were very appropriate. Just enough to make the movie seem ""new"" and a little bit different than the 1980 original. The change of ""era"" was obvious, I thought, since the original was set in ""present day"" 1980, why shouldn't the remake be set in ""present day"" 2005, popular culture and all?  The story progresses at a good rate throughout the movie, which I like because there are no slow spots where you get no relevent information (basically just ""filler"" to make the movie longer) and no saturated spots where everything spills out all at once.  The ending left a bit to be desired, but it was somewhat unexpected and allowed for a simple conclusion. Also, I'm not a big fan of many of the actors in this version, except, of course, Rade Serbedzija (Boris the Blade!) who is one of my favorites.To be honest, I was never much of a fan of the 1980 original (as far as horror movies go) despite its star-studded cast and brilliant director... still, I believe that this remake was very well designed and executed. I'm glad that I did not let all the negative ratings deter me from renting this movie!  Otherwise, I would have missed out on a good new horror flick, which I will soon be adding to my collection.

956133,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B000CCBC9E,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[10, 13]","If their goal in 2005 was to remake a decent, creepy ghost movie from 1980 and make it incredibly boring and stupid, then they have a huge success here.Granted, John Carpenter's ""The Fog"" (the original) may not be as good as Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" (1963) or Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" (2001)... but I like it. It's a fun film to watch because it works. The story/screenplay, the music, and the performances seem to blend well and create a fun macabre movie.The creators of Halloween (1978) needed to follow up that project with something else, and they chose a more traditional and gothic tale of supernatural horror. They could have gone the 'teens stalked by slasher' route again. It's good that they didn't. (Of course they would do that again in the Halloween sequel. With the success of the first movie who could blame them?)This version of The Fog is not fun like the original, nor is it in any way truly scary... even though it is obvious that the director and screenwriter probably felt that they made a frightening flick. Well, they didn't. They use all the typical, tried-and-false methods that we expect from horror films. Give us something unexpected instead of this nonsense! Life is brief and I am tired of wasting time on shoddy movies that stink.And they altered the story significantly, for the worse. Why tamper with something that was fine?At least the original film had an atmosphere of impending dread and creepiness (and a very effective score by Mr. Carpenter). But Hollywood cannot leave well enough alone. Sometimes I think that there ought to be a law against remakes. Rarely does this concept succeed.So if you have watched every other film ever created, and if have run out of good books to read, and if you have nothing whatsoever else to do, then you might consider watching this dreck that came up from the bottom of the sea. Chances are when it's over you will want to watch the original film and see an enjoyable and chilling ghost tale unfold.",1,"Aaaargh...I roll me eyes in disgust, matey",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,1990,"['goal', '2005', 'was', 'remake', 'decent', 'ghost', 'movie', '1980', 'make', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'stupid', 'then', 'have', 'huge', 'success', 'here.Granted', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fog', 'original', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'Haunting', '1963', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'Others', '2001', 'like', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'story/screenplay', 'music', 'performances', 'seem', 'blend', 'well', 'create', 'fun', 'macabre', 'movie.The', 'creators', 'Halloween', '1978', 'needed', 'follow', 'up', 'project', 'something', 'else', 'chose', 'more', 'traditional', 'gothic', 'tale', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'could', 'have', 'gone', ""'teens"", 'stalked', 'slasher', 'route', 'again', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'course', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'Halloween', 'sequel', 'success', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'could', 'blame', 'version', 'Fog', 'not', 'fun', 'original', 'way', 'truly', 'scary', 'even', 'obvious', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'probably', 'felt', 'made', 'frightening', 'flick', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'typical', 'tried-and-false', 'methods', 'expect', 'horror', 'films', 'Give', 'something', 'unexpected', 'instead', 'nonsense', 'Life', 'brief', 'am', 'tired', 'wasting', 'time', 'shoddy', 'movies', 'stink.And', 'altered', 'story', 'significantly', 'worse', 'Why', 'tamper', 'something', 'was', 'fine', 'least', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'impending', 'dread', 'creepiness', 'very', 'effective', 'score', 'Mr.', 'Carpenter', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'ought', 'be', 'law', 'remakes', 'Rarely', 'concept', 'succeed.So', 'have', 'watched', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'created', 'have', 'run', 'good', 'books', 'read', 'have', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'else', 'do', 'then', 'might', 'consider', 'watching', 'dreck', 'came', 'up', 'bottom', 'sea', 'Chances', 'are', 'when', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'original', 'film', 'see', 'enjoyable', 'chilling', 'ghost', 'tale', 'unfold']",N/A
956134,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000CCBC9E,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 3]","Another week, and another horror re-make. Woops. I'm sorry. I meant to say ""re-imagining"". That seems to be what they are calling these films nowadays. This latest one holds some resemblance to the 1980 John Carpenter classic, but most of it seems to be new and re-worked for the new generation of filmgoers. It doesn't work. Carpenter was on board as producer(as was the late great Debra Hill), and after viewing the film, one would wish that it had been re-done by Carpenter himself. Maybe then the film would of been effective and, well, creepy. Because this one isn't. ""Smallville""'s Tom Welling stars as Nick Castle(ha ha), who is a fisherman in Antonio Bay. His girlfriend Elizabeth(Maggie Grace from ""Lost), blows back into town, and odd things begin to happen. A strange fog begins to set in and then things get really weird. Mysterious figures are seen in the fog and then people start dying. The mystery(and history)is expanded on in this version. A group of people aboard the Elizabeth Dane ship, lepers, are betrayed by local townsfolk and were killed or left to die. Now in the present day, the ghosts of these people are getting their revenge on the descendants of the people who did them wrong. Showing much more of the backstory doesn't work. Sometimes seeing too much and giving too much of an explanation ruins the mystery. It should of been left alone. The characters are all one dimensional and are predictable cardboard cut-out horror victims. Nothing in the way of phenomenal acting either. Director Rupert Wainright does treat us to some nice direction and visuals tho. The movie does look good. The ghosts themselves look like something off of the haunted house ride in Disneyland. The originals were creepy and scary. Then there's the fog. The original might of been cheesy looking nowadays, but it worked better then. It was more simple and more eerie. Here, you know you are looking at a lot of fake fog. It hurts the film. Selma Blair is great, but she can't fill Adrienne Barbeau's shoes. No one can. But she looked great. In fact, the best part of this movie is staring at Selma and Maggie for 100 minutes. And would it of killed them to have someone pop in?. Hal Holbrook?. Barbeau?. Tom Atkins?. Heck, even Nancy Loomis?. I loved the original film. Just love it. Part of me kinda likes this movie, and part of me wants to reject it. This was not the film I wanted exactly. There was enough to work with, but the artists involved musn't of seen it or cared enough. The ending just seemed too abrupt and absurd. The Fog is a ghost story, but this one is just too much of a ghost story. Does that even make sense?. Oh well. I got Maggie and Selma for an 1hr. 40min so all wasn't lost. The late Debra Hill was the one who wanted to get this thing off the ground. If she had lived  maybe it would of been better. Then again Carpenter himself was on board as a producer, so probably not. Jamie Lee should of been cast in the Janet Leigh role from the original. Wouldn't that of been something?. Yes, it would have. But that is something too cool and creative for the people who made this film.",1,"Jamie Lee, Where Are You?!....",1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3119,"['week', 'horror', 're-make', 'Woops', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'meant', 'say', 're-imagining', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'calling', 'films', 'nowadays', 'latest', 'one', 'resemblance', '1980', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'most', 'be', 'new', 're-worked', 'new', 'generation', 'filmgoers', ""n't"", 'work', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'board', 'producer', 'was', 'late', 'great', 'Debra', 'Hill', 'viewing', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 're-done', 'Carpenter', 'Maybe', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'been', 'effective', 'well', 'creepy', 'one', ""n't"", 'Smallville', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'stars', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'ha', 'ha', 'who', 'fisherman', 'Antonio', 'Bay', 'girlfriend', 'Elizabeth', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'back', 'town', 'odd', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'strange', 'fog', 'set', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'weird', 'Mysterious', 'figures', 'are', 'seen', 'fog', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'mystery', 'history', 'expanded', 'version', 'group', 'people', 'Elizabeth', 'Dane', 'ship', 'lepers', 'are', 'betrayed', 'local', 'townsfolk', 'were', 'killed', 'left', 'die', 'Now', 'present', 'day', 'ghosts', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'revenge', 'descendants', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'Showing', 'much', 'more', 'backstory', ""n't"", 'work', 'Sometimes', 'seeing', 'too', 'much', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'explanation', 'mystery', 'should', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'are', 'predictable', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'horror', 'victims', 'Nothing', 'way', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'either', 'Director', 'Rupert', 'Wainright', 'treat', 'nice', 'direction', 'visuals', 'tho', 'movie', 'look', 'good', 'ghosts', 'look', 'something', 'haunted', 'house', 'ride', 'Disneyland', 'originals', 'were', 'creepy', 'scary', 'Then', 'fog', 'original', 'might', 'been', 'cheesy', 'looking', 'nowadays', 'worked', 'better', 'then', 'was', 'more', 'simple', 'more', 'eerie', 'Here', 'know', 'are', 'looking', 'lot', 'fake', 'fog', 'film', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fill', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'shoes', 'one', 'can', 'looked', 'great', 'fact', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'staring', 'Selma', 'Maggie', '100', 'minutes', 'would', 'killed', 'have', 'someone', 'pop', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Barbeau', 'Tom', 'Atkins', 'Heck', 'even', 'Nancy', 'Loomis', 'loved', 'original', 'film', 'Just', 'love', 'Part', 'kinda', 'likes', 'movie', 'part', 'reject', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'wanted', 'exactly', 'was', 'enough', 'work', 'artists', 'involved', 'mus', ""n't"", 'seen', 'cared', 'enough', 'ending', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'abrupt', 'absurd', 'Fog', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'ghost', 'story', 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'Oh', 'well', 'got', 'Maggie', 'Selma', '1hr', '40min', 'was', ""n't"", 'lost', 'late', 'Debra', 'Hill', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'thing', 'off', 'ground', 'had', 'lived', 'maybe', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'Then', 'again', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'board', 'producer', 'so', 'probably', 'not', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'should', 'been', 'cast', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'role', 'original', 'Would', ""n't"", 'been', 'something', 'Yes', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'too', 'cool', 'creative', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film']",N/A
956135,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000CCBC9E,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I've never seen the original so I can only judge this 2006 remake on its own merits.  It is... unfortunately pretty mediocre.  It lacks everything I love about horror films- suspense, atmosphere, killings, choppings, shootings, excitement... the whole kitten kaboodle!  Even worse, the actual FOG (the main drawing point) only occurs in a few brief spots (the final 15 minutes being an exception of course).For the most part, the storyline is based around a young man and his potential girlfriend digging up clues pertaining to the history of the small seaside community they're living in.  Something apparently went wrong in the early 1870's and it's up to them to figure out the facts.  However these moments are usually uninteresting and lacking suspense.  Other characters include an attractive young woman who works in a lighthouse radio station by herself, and her young son.  Oh and the preacher who does nothing but walks around outside drunk all the time, lol.  For the most part, the characters are nothing enticing or special by any stretch of the imagination (and that's the truth- there's hardly any imagination whatsoever taking place throughout the Fog).However the biggest issue by FAR is the pathetic acting.  What's wrong with it exactly?  These young adults are too reminiscent of the ones we've seen in teenage TV dramas such as Beverly Hills 90210 or Melrose Place- even death itself occurring with no explanation isn't enough to make these people seem particularly concerned due to the crappy acting, and that's a major problem in my opinion.  They *still* plod on and on with very little in the way of emotion.  Easily the worst aspect of this remake of the Fog, however...There's a few good moments too!  It's not all bad!  The good would be (assuming you're able to make it beyond the first 45 minutes of horrendous acting and lack of scares, that is) the segment where the one boy was running away from the approaching suspicious fog coming over the ocean and quickly darting back to the house, the man catching on fire and exploding backwards through the air, and the hand coming out of a sink to greet a dish-doing grandmother.  Oh and the woman who's trapped in the ocean water and witnesses a ghost when she tries to free herself from the door... really creepy.  Later on, we see a nice unsettling scenery showing the dead people rise from the graveyard and stand over their graves.Still, despite these obvious flaws, the ending IS a surprise highlight.  Though brief and subtle, it shocked me pretty good when one of the main characters... nah, I'm not spoiling it.  I know I know, I *should* spoil it so you won't have to waste over 90 minutes watching this mediocre film, but people (and especially amazon) frown upon that stuff so I can't.  Sorry!  A memorable ending at any rate.

Horror movies tend to come in trends, similar to music. In the 70's we had psychological horror, 80's we had slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. 90's we get teen slashers like Scream and Urban Legend. Now we have 2 trends: the remakes of old films such as this and Ring or The Grudge and outright gory films like the Saw films and Hostel. So in a way, the horror genre didn't need this remake, it was just more convenient.The film centers around an Oregon community that had a dark past.  The founding fathers are having an anniversary of sorts and people are celebrating birth of their town. Only this immense blanket of fog is right outside their island and wants to creep people out. So people die, people get spooked and plot holes fit for trains fly by all the while we're going ""um, this is a horror movie right?""On an episode of Family Guy, Brian is explaining the plot of Blair Witch Project to a blind guy and saying ""nothing's happening"" a lot and ""something about a map"".  Well there's no map here but you can pretty much say ""nothing's happening....more fog, nothing's happening"". That's kind of the problem with this film: it's kinda boring. There's no sense of dread for the characters so if they're in trouble, we kind of go listless.Another trend happening a lot lately is the reliance on CG effects. While many of these fog shots and such could obviously not be CG, the ever-growing trend of using CG and a bit poor CG at that isn't very appealing. I especially love the special feature on them: ""we wanted to give them personality so you got angry fog, sneaky fog"". It's like guys? It's just fog, it doesn't NEED a personality. Of course it has more personality than the actors but that's not their fault.One hard thing for an actor to shake is when we see them outside a signature role. So when TV's Tom Welling starts driving, we start going ""can't Superman fly? And since when did Shannon from Lost go from one island to another?"" It's not their fault and they try to at least give a performance but it's usually director's fault too. It's kinda sad to say attractive likable stars look so wooden.Here's hoping we go back to films like the Shining, Rosemary's Baby or Night of the Living Dead and freak out people because of remakes like the Grudge, the Fog or outright gory films like Hostel are an indication, we're going to suffer through more crap, and that fogging sucks.",2,What the fog happened to this movie?,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2552,"['Lame', 'pun', 'know', 'valid', 'question', 'one', 'hard', 'answer', 'mentioning', 'bad', 'things', 'Horror', 'movies', 'tend', 'come', 'trends', 'similar', 'music', '70', 'had', 'psychological', 'horror', '80', 'had', 'films', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', '90', 'get', 'teen', 'slashers', 'Scream', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'Now', 'have', '2', 'trends', 'remakes', 'old', 'films', 'such', 'Ring', 'Grudge', 'outright', 'gory', 'films', 'Saw', 'films', 'Hostel', 'So', 'way', 'horror', 'genre', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'remake', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'convenient.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Oregon', 'community', 'had', 'dark', 'past', 'founding', 'fathers', 'are', 'having', 'anniversary', 'sorts', 'people', 'are', 'celebrating', 'birth', 'town', 'Only', 'immense', 'blanket', 'fog', 'right', 'island', 'creep', 'people', 'out', 'So', 'people', 'die', 'people', 'get', 'spooked', 'plot', 'holes', 'fit', 'trains', 'fly', 'while', ""'re"", 'going', 'um', 'horror', 'movie', 'right', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Brian', 'explaining', 'plot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'blind', 'guy', 'saying', 'nothing', 'happening', 'lot', 'something', 'map', 'Well', 'map', 'here', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'nothing', 'happening', '.more', 'fog', 'nothing', 'happening', 'kind', 'problem', 'film', 'kinda', 'boring', 'sense', 'dread', 'characters', 'so', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'kind', 'go', 'listless.Another', 'trend', 'happening', 'lot', 'lately', 'reliance', 'CG', 'effects', 'many', 'fog', 'shots', 'such', 'could', 'obviously', 'not', 'be', 'CG', 'ever-growing', 'trend', 'using', 'CG', 'bit', 'poor', 'CG', ""n't"", 'very', 'appealing', 'especially', 'love', 'special', 'feature', 'wanted', 'give', 'personality', 'so', 'got', 'angry', 'fog', 'sneaky', 'fog', 'guys', 'just', 'fog', ""n't"", 'NEED', 'personality', 'course', 'more', 'personality', 'actors', 'not', 'fault.One', 'hard', 'thing', 'actor', 'shake', 'when', 'see', 'signature', 'role', 'So', 'when', 'TV', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'driving', 'start', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Superman', 'fly', 'when', 'did', 'Shannon', 'Lost', 'go', 'one', 'island', 'not', 'fault', 'try', 'least', 'give', 'performance', 'usually', 'director', 'fault', 'too', 'kinda', 'sad', 'say', 'attractive', 'likable', 'stars', 'look', 'so', 'wooden.Here', 'hoping', 'go', 'back', 'films', 'Shining', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'freak', 'out', 'people', 'remakes', 'Grudge', 'Fog', 'outright', 'gory', 'films', 'Hostel', 'are', 'indication', ""'re"", 'going', 'suffer', 'more', 'crap', 'fogging', 'sucks']",N/A
956148,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000CCBC9E,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[47, 62]","I've since come to accept Hollywood's re-cycling tendencies, whether it's schlepping out remake after stinking remake, or turning any halfway decent 1970s television series in to a big budget flops no one wants to see.  I've consigned myself to the notion that originality really isn't a viable commodity in tinsletown, and hasn't been for a while.  Despite this understanding, I still find myself resentful when someone takes an extremely solid past production, dissembles it,  forgets how to put it back together, slaps  a `hip', MTV spin on it, ultimately turning it into a barely watchable, incoherent exercise of ineptitude as was done with The Fog (2005), a remake of a John Carpenter film release some 25 years earlier.  This new version, written by Cooper Layne (The Core), and directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata), stars Tom Welling (""Smallville""), Maggie Grace (""Lost""), and Selma Blair (Storytelling, Legally Blonde, Hellboy).  Also appearing is DeRay Davis (Barbershop, Scary Movie 4), Kenneth Welsh (The Day After Tomorrow, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), Adrian Hough (In the Land of Women), Sara Botsford (Tremors 4: The Legend Begins), and Rade Serbedzija (The Saint, Mission: Impossible II), whom I best remember as the character Boris 'The Blade', from the film Snatch (2000).As the movie opens we're on an old timey sailing ship (a clipper), and a fire breaks out, as an lamp full of oil is dropped.  Amongst the flaming mayhem, four men escape via a rowboat, but not all make it to shore...fast forward to the present (I'm pretty sure it's the present, given the lousy rock music) and we meet various inhabitants of Antonio Island, which, by the way, is gearing up for some sort of founder's day celebration.  There's hunky charter boat captain Nick Castle (Welling) and his extremely annoying partner Spooner (Davis), local radio DJ Stevie Wayne (Blair), who operates out of the local lighthouse, and Elizabeth Williams (Grace), who's just recently returned to town under the guise of 19th century male street urchin,  which, seems to appeal to Nick as he picks her up hitchhiking and takes her to his place for a little vertical boogie in the shower (apparently the two have a past history, or else she's just really easy).  We're about thirty minutes into the movie now and I'm wondering when the actual story is going to begin...so far we've seen a series of minor events, but nothing really conclusive...we did get to see both female leads in their underwear, for what its worth, Grace sporting an attractive light blue ensemble, while Blair favors black (you know what they say about women and black underwear...I'd be all over that if she didn't have a kid almost as old she is) ...eventually the fog does come rolling in with whatever bad vibes it contains, and we learn the founding fathers, all of whom the main characters are descendants, did something really bad a long time ago, something to which now the ghosts of the past are coming up from their watery graves threatening `Blood for blood', which was odd to me because there was no blood whatsoever in the entire film...oh well.All right, I think it's important for me to preface this by stating I'm a big fan of the original film, so I was a wary, but optimistic, when I heard a remake was in the works.  I didn't think it would be as good as the original, but then also I didn't think it would suck eggs as much or thoroughly as it did...Rupert Wainwright, the director, who got his start making music videos for such artists as M.C. Hammer and N.W.A. and writer Cooper Layne, whose only other main film credit is for the insufferable science fiction disaster film (meaning it was a disaster of a film) The Core (2003), which he wrote and produced (had I known Layne was involved, I would have passed this feature by), show how to take a decent, spooky little film, made a quarter of a century ago, and wrench all the goodness out of it, leaving behind a celluloid husk of flotsam that ran eleven minutes longer than the original, but featured less, actual story.  Seriously, the only thing missing from this non-frightening ghost story was Scooby Doo and the gang.  It's pretty sad when the most interesting character in the movie is the special effects, in this case, the fog, as the real characters were so vacuous, transparent, and without distinction as to barely even register on the screen, much less make me concerned for their well being (I only assumed who the main characters were based on their extensive screen time, and not due to any perception of importance to the story).  The direction, in general, features a lot of strong shots, but in terms of tying them all together, Wainwright didn't do so hot, as the various scenes felt slapped together with little, or no regard, for transition.  As far as the plot goes, there were many holes, some small, some quite large, but none worth mentioning given the overall lack of cohesion in the story.  The one aspect that really made me nuts was the character of Spooner, the homeboy fisherman, who had what I consider to be the absolute worst line in the film as he's talking to Welling's character about women and relationships...'Women have testicle telepathy, man.'  What an idiotic, meaningless statement, obviously written by someone of an older generation thinking he has a handle on how the cool, hipper, younger generation speaks, but doesn't...hey, I don't either, but I don't delude myself into thinking I do...anyway, back to Spooner...why, oh why, was this character allowed to survive?  If anyone warranted a gruesome, miserable, painful death, it was he.  At one point he appeared to have been killed, which wasn't very satisfying as it could have been specifically because we didn't witness his demise (it was inferred), but I was partially satiated given the knowledge we wouldn't have to suffer anymore of his idiotic buffoonery.  But in a cruel licorice, twist of fate  the movie gods, being the fickle lot they are, saw fit to save this tool of a character (in a completely ridiculous manner), perhaps out of pure spite, I do not know, but to be cheated out of the meager satisfaction resultant of the death of this worthless, irritating and completely pointless secondary character was the supreme letdown...or, at least I thought so, until we got to the end of the movie...what in the hell was that about?  I'm not going to give it away, but it just seemed to me not to make much sense, especially given the vengeful nature of the spirits.  The special effects were decent (I prefer the low tech effects from the original film over the CGI work here), along with the original scoring, but neither came remotely close to making up for what was lacking, which was just about everything else.The picture, presented here in widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1), does look sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very clearly.  There are some extras included, the main being a commentary by track Rupert Wainwright, who, I got the impression, didn't care for the finished product very much (join the club).  Also included are three pointless featurettes (I love the one with the cast interviews, as they all gush about each other and talk about how great the others are to work with...I guess sincerity, along with originality, are not popular traits in the movie biz).  Also thrown in are seven deleted scenes, with optional director's commentary, and a whole slew of previews for unrelated films like The Da Vinci Code (2006), Underworld Evolution (2006), The Legend of Zorro (2005), Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), The Pink Panther (2006), Monster House (2006), Rent (2005), Zathura (2005), Underworld Deluxe Edition DVD, The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), and The Cave (2005).Cookieman108By the way, there is a saying which has served me well over the years, one which I think applies here...if it ain't broke, don't fix it...",2,"""What kind of fog goes against the wind?

956149,A2EE7SEM9F9QB2,B000CCBC9E,Cryptic Critic &#34;Kevin&#34;,"[16, 20]","I am a fan of the original version of ""The Fog"" and of John Carpenter's work in general.  When I first learned about this remake back in the fall of 2004, I groaned.  Why would anyone want to redo a film less than thirty years old or a film whose original director is still alive for that matter?  As I read the news snippets that were posted at various websites, I felt there was some hope for this unnecessary update.  The saving grace factor being the late Debra Hill and Carpenter himself were set to produce.  I later found out that Carpenter was  a producer by name only.  Hill would succumb to cancer before production began.  All hope seemed to be lost.  Then casting news started rolling in.  Tom Welling, Maggie Grace and Selma Blair all signed on as the three leads.  Why they felt the need to cut the ages of all the central characters in half is beyond me.  I kept debating on whether or not I should even see the remake when it came out.  Then the trailer debuted on the internet.  I saw it and it looked very good.  Appearances are deceiving.For those of you who have not seen the 1979 original or this 2005 retelling, here is a rundown of the plot:In the late 1800s the four founding fathers of the small Oregon town (originally California) of Antonio Bay made a deal with a group of rich lepers to allow them to purchase half the island as their new home.  The founding fathers double cross them.  The four of them board the clippership the lepers are traveling on in the dead of night and begin robbing them of all their money and possessions.  The ship is set ablaze as the four men escape while every man, woman and child on board perishes.  Flash forward 130 years or so to present day where the local historical society has erected a statue in honor of the men who made it possible for Antonio Bay to grow from a settlement into a prosperous, thriving township.  Apparently the dead lepers have other ideas, because they return from their water grave and start offing all the oldest living descendants (and anyone else who gets in the way) of those responsible for their demise.For the most part, the story is cut and paste from the original.  There are slight changes to the back stories to all the characters.  They were written to be the descendants of the conspirators.  While this was an interesting take on the prologue, it was never really fully explored.  There was also a really ridiculous and ludicrous plot twist which inlvolved one of the leads turning out to be the reincarnated spirit of the head leper's spouse.  What the hell were they thinking?Casting was a problem in and of itself.  Why the filmmakers felt the need to cut the ages of the centrals characters in half is beyond me.  Tom Atkins was perfectly in his element as Nick Castle in the original.  Tom Welling brought nothing to the story in his portrayal of the character (I would have approached Kurt Russel for the part).  At first glance, Maggie Grace seemed like an adequate casting choice for the role of Elizabeth Williams (it was Elizabeth Solley in the original).  After seeing a few episodes of ""Lost"" I wondered why they casted her, because her acting is very flat and mechanical.  She didn't impress me at all in the movie, either (I think Eliza Dushku or Jessica Biel would have been better).  Selma Blair did what she could with what she was given.  I just had a hard time seeing her as the mother of a 12-year-old even though she was 33 when they were shooting the film.  She is very youthful looking...which is exactly what the filmmakers were looking for.  I would have gone with someone who in very least LOOKED old enough to have a child that age.  Charisma Carpenter or Laura Dern, for example.  Blair also didn't have the sultry speaking voice that Adrienne Barbeau does.  In hearing her voice over in the original, I felt like I was listening to a real DJ.  Blair didn't capture that like Barbeau did.  It could have been worse:  Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas was intially cast as Stevie Wayne, but left because the filmmakers would not give her top billing.The supporting cast was slightly better.  Sara Botsford updated the role of Kathy Williams (who was written to be Elizabeth's bitch mother in this version) originally played by the late great Janet Leigh.  She played it well, but her involvement with the other characters was changed drastically from the way she was written in the original.  Botsford did a good job.  I found her diction to be a bit off, though.  In one scene, she is reading the names on the monument, she seems to have a slight British accent.  I thought she was Canadian.  Whatever, go figure.  Adrian Hough did a respectable job as Father Malone, but did not quite surpass the horror Hal Holbrook exuded knowing he is the descendant of a thief and murderer.  Spooner, the new and unneeded token black character was just plain annoying and completely out of place.  I really wish one of the lepers had skewered him with a sicle.The ending of the film was a complete and total insult to my intelligence and everyone else who saw it.  Why did they have to change the story so much?  This remake is nothing more than a prime example of a wasted oppotunity to retell a classic in a fresh way.  The script was horrible, the acting was wooden and the visual effects were garbage.  The only nice thing I can think of to say about ""The Fog"" (2005) is the cinematography is top notch.John Carpenter was approached and asked his opinion of this recycling of his cult classic.  His response: ""No comment.""  He must be kicking himself for allowing this remake to happen.  Debra Hill is probably turning over in her grave.  It would be just desserts if she came back to haunt Carpenter and slap him on the back of his head for not having actively produced this feature.  Had he done so, he might have been able to save this train wreck from occuring.Then again, that's just wishful thinking.",2,A missed opportunity to recreate a classic.,1138579200,"01 30,

I'm still trying to work out why anyone would a) want to remake John Carpenter's 1980 classic and b) more importantly, why they wouldn't try and rework the premise a bit more - ala the excellent 'Dawn Of The Dead' remake, which, in my humble and probably blasphemous opinion, actually surpasses the original. As it stands, what you get are the standard nods to modern tokenism (everyone is young and beautiful, the soundtrack is full of contemporary modern music and there is much more of an accent on CGI) and some decent camerawork. Some fairly decent production values ensure that it's not a terrible film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just not a particularly interesting one either. Its also not remotely scary, which is a major failing in any modern horror film and what small atmosphere it does build up deflates like a limp balloon when the crew of the `Elizabeth Dane' make their definitive appearance and turn out to be less scary than the ghost pirates from those truly dreadful 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movies or a villain from an episode of the original series of 'Scooby Doo'.

956153,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000CCBC9E,Dave. K,"[7, 8]","I went into the remake of The Fog with an open mind and expected a fairly decent movie, I didn't think it would be better than the original or an instant classic, but I was expecting a fairly decent movie. I heard The Fog was terrible, but to be totally honest since right now we are in remake hell I thought maybe people are just being harsh since this is the latest remake. And a remake of a popular movie by John Carpenter, that makes this movie a sitting duck.But I have to agree with the majority. The Fog was indeed a very bad movie. Things go from bad to worse over the course of the movie. I was amazed at how horrible The Fog was. Like I said I wasn't expecting a classic, but a fairly decent movie. The Fog didn't even have the so bad its good vibe going for it. Only the so bad it's well bad.I did like the original John Carpenter version, but I do believe there were some problems with the original. While the original did have a creepy feel to it there were also some slow moments. The Fog is also a bit dated, while it's still a good movie it hasn't aged as well as some of Carpenter's other movies. Overall though I did enjoy the original and I didn't think the remake would be better, but maybe stand proud next to it.The screenplay by Cooper Layne was quite bad. The characters are one dimensional and boring. They aren't fleshed out at all. John Carpenter and Debra Hill's script wasn't perfect, but it was well written. Layne Cooper though, well his script was bad. The concept behind The Fog was a simple story and that is why it worked. Cooper Layne takes a simple concept and creates a total mess.Despite the flaws of the original John Carpenter was able to make up for it with some really great atmosphere. He uses his setting to his total advantage and is able to make a movie that has a lot of suspense and tension even with the flaws. Sadly director Rupert Wainwright is not able to do the same. Ok so he didn't have much of a script, but I have seen many horror movies that weren't all that well written become a lot better cause of the director.Rupert Wainwright never really creates much of an eerie feeling. There were a couple of scenes late in the movie with he showed some flashes of something. But by this time do we even really care? The answer is quite simple. No we don't, not this late in the movie. Wainwright never uses his setting to his advantage his scenes are all poorly paced, he wasn't able to build any suspense or tension.The acting was quite weak as well. Tom Welling is just going through the motions here. Maggie Grace though gives a fairly good performance and is somewhat able to make a poorly written character a bit interesting at times, but barley. Selma Blair though is excellent. She gave a solid performance in my opinion, but it's sadly wasted here. She doesn't have nearly enough scenes and I think she could have made The Fog a bit better had she been given a bigger part. Selma Blair may not be Adrienne Barbeau, but she does manage to bring something to the character and really is the only positive thing about this movie.The Fog really was as bad as the reviews stated; it relies too much on CGI, which was quite bad I must say. A simple ghost story became a complete waste of time. Like I said before I wasn't expecting a great movie, but a fairly decent one. But all I got was a bad movie and not in a good way.",1,It really is as bad as the reviews say,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3379,"['went', 'remake', 'Fog', 'open', 'mind', 'expected', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'instant', 'classic', 'was', 'expecting', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'heard', 'Fog', 'was', 'terrible', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'remake', 'hell', 'thought', 'maybe', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'being', 'harsh', 'latest', 'remake', 'remake', 'popular', 'movie', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'movie', 'sitting', 'duck.But', 'have', 'agree', 'majority', 'Fog', 'was', 'indeed', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'horrible', 'Fog', 'was', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'classic', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'Fog', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'vibe', 'going', 'Only', 'so', 'bad', 'well', 'bad.I', 'did', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'do', 'believe', 'were', 'problems', 'original', 'original', 'did', 'have', 'creepy', 'feel', 'were', 'also', 'slow', 'moments', 'Fog', 'also', 'bit', 'dated', 'still', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'aged', 'as', 'well', 'Carpenter', 'other', 'movies', 'Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'maybe', 'stand', 'proud', 'next', 'it.The', 'screenplay', 'Cooper', 'Layne', 'was', 'quite', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'boring', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Debra', 'Hill', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'Layne', 'Cooper', 'well', 'script', 'was', 'bad', 'concept', 'Fog', 'was', 'simple', 'story', 'why', 'worked', 'Cooper', 'Layne', 'simple', 'concept', 'total', 'mess.Despite', 'flaws', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'up', 'really', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'total', 'advantage', 'able', 'make', 'movie', 'lot', 'suspense', 'tension', 'even', 'flaws', 'Sadly', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'not', 'able', 'do', 'same', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'script', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'well', 'written', 'become', 'lot', 'better', 'cause', 'director.Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'were', 'couple', 'scenes', 'late', 'movie', 'showed', 'flashes', 'something', 'time', 'do', 'even', 'really', 'care', 'answer', 'quite', 'simple', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'late', 'movie', 'Wainwright', 'never', 'setting', 'advantage', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'paced', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'build', 'suspense', 'tension.The', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'well', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'here', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'fairly', 'good', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'able', 'make', 'poorly', 'written', 'character', 'bit', 'interesting', 'times', 'barley', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'excellent', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'opinion', 'sadly', 'wasted', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'scenes', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Fog', 'bit', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'bigger', 'part', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'manage', 'bring', 'something', 'character', 'really', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'movie.The', 'Fog', 'really', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'reviews', 'stated', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'was', 'quite', 'bad', 'must', 'say', 'simple', 'ghost', 'story', 'became', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'great', 'movie', 'fairly', 'decent', 'one', 'got', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'way']",N/A

Without warning, a mysterious, thick fog rolls in carrying the murderous ghosts of lepers who were wrongfully killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. The townspeople need to solve this mystery before days end or they will fall victim to the fog's fury.The original ""Fog"" has always been one of my favourite John Carpenter films behind ""Halloween"" of course. It offers a great cast (Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, John Houseman), built-up tension, an eerie Carpenter score, a great location and a bone-chilling ghost story. Although it's not perfect, it works.The remake offers an attractive, younger cast (Tom Welling, Selma Blair, Maggie Grace) and expensive CGI effects. The story remains the same but somehow the film-makers got rid of the much-needed suspense. There is no sense of threat or tension in the air despite the violent, black, CGI created fog that is constantly on display. They even changed the ghosts form of execution of it's victims which in my opinion, was a huge mistake. In the original film, the wronged ghosts appear as three-dimensional beings. They're covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with every sharp, metallic object you can think of; swords, hooks, knives. It was like watching ""Night Of The Living Dead"" and ""Halloween"" all rolled into one. The idea was original and deeply chilling. The remake tried to make the murders seem more ghostly by not taking the original's approach and there were added embellishments to the story that were not necessary and didn't work. Instead of inspiring fear in the movie theatre I watched this in, it inspired bursts of laughter from the audience.This film is still far superior to some other horror atrocities released from Hollywood in the last couple of years or so (did someone say ""Boogeyman""??) but it's still a major disappointment. Especially when you take the budget and talent into consideration. For those who have not seen the original, I recommend watching it instead. Despite it's low-budget, it's a far more effective and satisfying shocker.

It was a wonderful setting for a horror movie. Someone got pieces of this film correct. Then it just went all wrong. The ending was so silly and funny. It was really ridiculous. It made no sense at all. Just sort of thrown in.The main character, Elizabeth, comes back to the island where she is born, after having fled to NYC for 6 months, leaving her {cheating} boyfriend and coldhearted mother behind. She comes back, coincidentally, during the same weekend that the island is celebrating it's 100th anniversary. Elizabeth reunites with her {cheating} boyfriend who is unfortunately played by Tom Welling. Welling has the expression of a wooden stick and his character is highly unlikable. He carries himself smugly and with arrogance and it makes no sense at all that a beautiful, smart woman like Elizabeth would even waste her time on him.Anyway, the anniversary of the island is celebrating the founding fathers who, it seems, carried a very dark secret with them to the grave for the sake of their families. Their descendants are these young twenty-somethings about to be terrorized for their great-great-grandfather's sins.The concept is not entirely bad. In fact, it was interesting to watch the dark secret unfold and Elizabeth play detective to unravel the story. I really enjoyed that. Also, I enjoyed a lot of the scene shots. The dining table eerily ""washed up"" on the beach was very creepy, beautiful and creative. The fog chasing the little boy was awesome. There really were some haunting and creepy shots and ideas.However. There was plenty that made no sense at all. In the beginning of the movie, Spooner, the friend of the male lead, hides in a freezer on their boat to avoid being killed by the ghosts. That made no sense whatsoever. How did he figure that out? How did he survive a whole night and day in a freezer? If he knew this secret was a way to save lives, why doesn't he share it with other people? When he comes back to life he even says something like ""they can't get you in the freezer"" but then it's never mentioned again. How silly!The attacks by the ghosts are also very random and illogical. At one point they fry grandma to a crispy skeleton through her sink water as she's washing dishes. If they have this sort of power, they could have taken out the entire island's population in about 5 mins. But then I guess we wouldn't have a movie, now would we?I was annoyed that the back story never revealed itself. So Tom Welling just gets all the girls and he never even tells Elizabeth he's been carrying on with the Selma Blair character. Why even have a subplot like that and then just ignore it?Then there was the ending. What happened?!! It made no sense at all. I can't reveal it because I would be a spoiler but really.... it really, really made no sense. It was the silliest, lamest ending ever ever ever.So OK entertainment piece.Good points:1.

956165,ALP5YTSQO6VMD,B000CCBC9E,Gregory Dowling,"[2, 4]","What happened here?  The trailer for this looked great and visually spectacular.  The effects are occasionally impressive (although the CGI fog sounds like a tidal wave on the soundtrack), but what is more impressive is just how poorly, illogically, and unscary this terrible mess is.  Tom Welling, while easy on the eyes, is a poor substitute for Tom Atkins (of the 1980 original).  In fact everyone in the cast, save possibly Selma Blair as the DJ Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau's character in the original), is seriously off the mark and wholly unlikable which is a fatal flaw for a movie like this that depends somewhat on us caring about what happens to these people.  Take for example, the elderly babysitter of Stevie Wayne's young son, Andy.  The woman is borderline catatonic, staring at ""Jeopardy"" of television, not offering a lick of supervision.  Who in their right mind would leave their child in the care of woman who is in the late stages of Alzheimers or perhaps has been beaten about the head, neck, and shoulders?  Compare to the elderly babysitter in the orginal, who was sharp, protective, and at least in control of her faculties.  I may sound like I am nit-picking, but this is what the movie is reduced to.Selma Blair is close to Barbeau's sultry-voiced DJ, and she is wasted in this movie.  I especially loved the moment where her car stalls, the fog creeps in through the heat vents, she is hit head-on by a tractor trailer, yet her car flips sideways over a cliff that was NOT present in the set-up shots, and she survives w. barely a scratch.  She even manages to escape the clutches of one of the ghost underwater by kicking real, real hard to losen the ghost's grip (?!).  Logic?  Who needs it?They have also added a love story as a motivation for the mysterious ghost ship returning to Antonio Bay(in addition to the gold that was stolen from them), and the leader, Blake, furious at losing his lover, who I thought was his daughter given he's like 100 years older than she is in flashback.  This is underdeveloped, unclear, and the pay-off is laughable.  Imagine the final kiss at the end of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" without emotion, poingance, or drama and you'll get an inkling of what lies in store.Father Malone, the sad, soulful, alcoholic conscience of the original filmed, played brilliantly by Hal Holbrook has been replaced by a drunken nutjob.  This, to me, was one of the biggest errors.  He was the sould of the original film.  His torment at knowing his gandfather participated in killing an entire leper colony for money and then celebrating them at the town's anniversary party was the emotional core of the story.  He's a non-presence here.  He's far closer to the crazy guy on the bike in the Friday the 13th movies riding around, telling everyone ""You're all doomed.""  These actor's agents should have given them the same advice.What was once hidden in shadow and implied is now hammered over are head w. all the subtlety of a 2 x 4.  John Carpenter focused on atmosphere, delicate sound, and good acting to create emotion.  Director Rupert Wainwright, director of ""Stigmata"" (a film I greatly enjoyed) has an eye for pretty pictures, special effects and little else.  The fact that John Carpenter produced this dreck is a travesty.  Perhaps this falls under the category of ""anything for a paycheck""?While some recent horror remakes have been successful and effective such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", this one fails miserably.  I did not see it in the theatre so I have no idea what was added to make this the ""Unrated Edition"", but if it was more story, it didn't help.  It should've been called the ""Overrated Edition.""

956168,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000CCBC9E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Terror from the sea strikes a tiny coastal town during its Founding Fathers' festivities. As the denizens of Antonio Bay gather and celebrate, a dense, spooky, meteorologically perverse fog rolls inland, against the wind, and begins to exert a malignant influence. And, within the fog lurks... something - something that craves a reckoning. Sure 'nuff, several Antonio Bay-ans begin to die off, all in gruesome CGI fashion. Elizabeth Williams, a wayward daughter of Antonio Bay recently come home, has been having disturbing dreams; she begins to delve into the mysterious goings-on. She and boyfriend Nick Castle uncover a dark, long-hidden secret that originates back to 1871, a secret which implicates the founding fathers in an act of atrocity. Can she, Nick, sultry radio deejay Stevie Wayne, and crazed Father Malone (who you just know is keeping something to himself) make a successful last stand against the relentless fog and its murderous phantom passengers? Anyways, Happy Founding Fathers' Day.This remake attempts to take advantage of the heat factor brought in by current television ""hot"" stars: Tom Welling (Smallville) and Maggie Grace (Lost). Unfortunately, Tom Welling's opening scene, where the film is suppose to strongly establish his leading character, charter boat owner Nick Castle, by having him deliver a bracing speech to his crew and clientele, flops ignominiously. Instead of sounding self-assured, he comes off as someone trying to sound grown up. I guess, in my mind, he's still young, high-schooler Clark Kent, even with that stubble. From there on, it's downhill for Welling, as he fails to make an impact and, in fact, sets new standards of cardboard cutout acting. Lovely Maggie Grace fares better than Welling, as she comes out the more developed protagonist. As the disaffected Elizabeth saddled with wanderlust, she settles down nicely in her plot-propelling, co-leading lady role. And, compared to Welling, who seems to be forcing it, she seems more comfortable and more natural in her emoting. The movie's saving grace is Selma Blair and her vigorous turn as Stevie Wayne. As I recall, the original Stevie Wayne (as sexily portrayed by Adrienne Barbeau) was also the high point of the original Fog. Adrian Hough as Father Malone, a priest burdened with a disturbing secret, is unsettlingly weird and tortured.What makes one movie palatable and another unsavory? This version retains the same key characters and apes most of the original premise (with some details altered in a fruitless bid for creativity), and yet doesn't come near in entertainment value. I'm not sure. The original Fog, while inherently cheesy, had several endearing moments, which gave it a nice flavor and favored cult film status. Maybe Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis just had that singular ""it"" quality? Maybe Maggie Grace is too generic? Or is it Welling's insipid acting? Or maybe the oh-so-crappy, ""huh?""-inducing ending here? One of the best parts about the original was Stevie Wayne's disembodied, night-owl radio voice stealing away from her lonely lighthouse, lending a sensation of dread isolation to the film. I relished the impending sense of doom and high-tension drama that washed over me as Stevie steadfastly remained in her lighthouse and tried her level best to direct her listeners to safety thru the radio, all the while frantic for her son's safety and knowing she herself might soon fall under attack. Those wondrous chills are missing in this remake, because this version's Stevie deserted her station pretty quickly. I also didn't like the fact that Nick and Stevie have a past relationship here, or that Nick and Elizabeth have a current relationship predating the movie. Part of the allure of the original to me was the concept of strangers initially going about it their separate ways and then finally, desperately banding together in a last stand against the ghosts.In the last generation, there's been such an influx of derivative horror flicks with the same crude shock effects that the audience's level of tolerance has considerably dropped. Nowadays, a film of this genre has to be truly innovative or truly shocking to make an impact. There's a reason this movie wasn't first screened for the critics before it was released. This version of the Fog mind-numbingly plays itself out by the numbers. The changes the writers install doesn't improve a whit on the original. Given, there are some cool special effects (the death of one Antonio Bay citizen involving shards of glass is nifty) and, I guess, some decent ""boo"" sequences, even though you see them coming a fog bank away. But the trite plot and cliched scriptwork take away from what atmospheric ambiance is retained from the original.So, two stars for this one: I originally had it as a one star stinkarama, but reluctantly threw in an extra star for Maggie Grace and Selma Blair's earnest, if ultimately futile, efforts. In terms of quality, this is on the same par as the incompetent, predictable, and unscary Darkness, The Boogeyman, and Cursed. Trust me and most of the reviewers here, go check out the original instead.",2,"""Sean - h-he's dead - his eyes - he's dead!""",1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,5133,"['Terror', 'sea', 'tiny', 'coastal',

Or give it a major make over just to appeal to a new and more younger generation? Well thats one of the big cases when it comes to most movie remakes today. Sure they aren't the most popular topic and I'm sure that there are a lot of people out there who are just sick of seeing and hearing about them. But if you ask me I believe that there have been some pretty acceptable and enjoyable remakes. This movie however, is not one of them. This film is a remake to John Carpenters 1980 horror classic The Fog. The story is pretty much the same as the original film. It takes place in the small town of Antonio Bay. Blind to all the residents the town has a deep and dark past. Before the 100th year anniversary of the towns birth a giant fog bank is approaching and causing mysterious deaths. Sooner or later everyone finds out that ghosts from the past have come back to get revenge on the town and its people.To be completely honest I enjoyed the hell out of the original film but I still felt that there was something missing. So I knew somehow that there was going to be a new version sooner or later. I was actually hoping that this movie would do the original some justice but in the end I started kicking myself for actually thinking that this was going to be as good. Not only is this movie almost completely different from Carpenter's vision but it falls short in both the scares and suspense. I guess you can blame that on screenwriter Cooper Layne and director Rupert Wainwright. Wainwright is somewhat known for directing music videos and to be honest I think he should have stuck to those.The story to this movie is the same as the original film so there should be no mystery when it comes to all the flashbacks which takes place in the movie. So if you've seen the original film then nothing in this remake will surprise you, not even the small jumpy moments. During most of the film we get these flashbacks which took place 100 years in the past and its goal is to try and tell the audience that the spirits are out for revenge and that they were cheated. The funny thing is that the audience picked that up from the very beginning of the film and the flashbacks ended up being pointless and un-suspenseful, slow and dull.One thing for sure is that I enjoyed the music and all the cool sound effects. I also enjoyed the overall look and feel of the movie, but thats pretty much it. The acting in the movie is alright but it seemed like each character in the film was reduced to have such bad attention spans. This movie has ridiculous characters which include an unfunny african american stereotype. Just about everything in this movie is laughable and most of the time it felt like a spoof rather then a serious horror film. It plays around with just about every horror cliche and not to mention its also filled with unspectacular computer effects which killed some of the moments in the film. Its pretty obvious that Wainwright tries to use thrills with CG tricks that Carpenter didn't have back in 1980.Sadly it doesn't work at all and rather then making spooky or creepy looking ghosts they end up looking normal and un-frightful. Rupert Wainwright tried way too hard and completely failed at re-attempting that frightening thrill that John Carpenter and Debra Hill gave audiences 25 years ago. If you're a fan of the original film then I strongly suggest staying away from this new adaption. Compared to Carpenters movie its nothing more then a spoof. Not only is it miles away from being frightening but it falls short with the ridiculous character changes and non threatening CG effects. Not to mention they watered down the violence from the original script just to pitch a lower and more acceptable rating.

956170,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000CCBC9E,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 4]","Perhaps one would not be so critical of the acting in the remake of ""The Fog"" if one has not seen the original ""The Fog"" directed by the great John Carpenter.  However, I have seen the original ""The Fog"" many times, and the remake fails miserably in comparison.  The story behind ""The Fog"" is unique and it takes a certain type of director and actors to pull it off, and John Carpenter and company were able to accomplish this fairly well.  However, the remake just fails to capture the atmosphere and charisma of the original.  I'm sorry, but you are not going to make an effective remake of a horror movie by replacing the actors in the original with actors like you have in this stinker of a remake.  It's just not going to happen.  The result is a movie for the teenagers and that's what this is, and a very poor one a that!  I don't like it!!Much like the remakes of the horror classics ""When A Stranger Calls"" and ""The Omen"", the acting in ""The Fog"" leaves a lot to be desired.  Hence the execution of the movie comes off laughable.  There is no doubt the acting and execution of this remake are both very poor.  The remake of ""The Fog"" is very difficult to get into because of this fact.  To be perfectly frank, the remake is dull, boring, and ultimately comes off like a total joke...at least that was my impression as I caught myself shaking my head in disgust repeatedly while watching this trash.If you're going to do a remake of a classic horror movie (not that the original ""The Fog"" is a classic by any means, but it's pretty good) or any good movie for that matter, you better have something more to offer than this garbage or it's going to fail and get hammered by the critics, and deservingly so.  An example of a great remake would be Martin Scorsese's classic remake of ""Cape Fear"" which has BRILLIANT acting and brings a character and flavor all its own to the table.  Alas, ""The Fog"" completely fails in this regard, not that Hollywood cares because the makers of this movie were quite obviously only interested in cashing in on the success of the original.My advice is to watch the original and skip the remake entirely because you won't be missin' a thing.  Fortunately, I saw this on encore and did not waste one penny buying or renting this garbage.  As eluded to above, it should be noted in any review of this movie that much like the remake of ""When A Stranger Calls"", the remake of ""The Fog"" is rated PG-13 and seems to be catering towards the teeny-bopper crowd and this conclusion is supported by the cast chosen for this movie and the undeniable teenaged or early 20-something theme throughout the movie.  In other words, it's got the teenaged feel to it.Zero star for a truly pathetic attempt to re-tell the story of the original...that's the only thing that kept this trash from garnering my dreaded 0 STARS grade.  The only remake that comes to my mind that is worse than this one is the remake of ""Salem's Lot"" starring Rob Lowe and Rutger Hauer.

The characters were very thinly developed and the story was just plain silly and bad.  The acting by most of the people was very unconvincing.  But what do you expect from a horror flick?  In the end it really wasn't scary at all and opportunities they had to make it truly scary they passed over.  Maybe this was to prevent it from getting an R rating, which finacially is probably a better move in this day and age.But I will give it thumbs up on the special effects.

956180,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000CCBC9E,Jason W. Kaiser,"[5, 6]","As a huge fan of the first Fog and also a huge fan of John Carpenter (I even like his bad movies, I loved Ghosts Of Mars and Vampires, even Prince Of Darkness was cool, sorry) I was a bit worried when I found he was 'retooling' his original, but much to my surprise, it was not that bad. In fact, if I compare the two, this one had a couple of things going for it more then the first one did. The fist thing would be that this one goes much deeper and detailed about the history of Antonio Bay and the lepers and the founding fathers who supposedly 'saved' the town and how they did it. The first one rarely made any references to this, and now that I think about it, didn't have any flashbacks at all, which are not always great for movies, but I think with this story, they were necesary. The flashbacks are rich in detail, very well presented down to the wardrobe and even the lingo. John Carpenter has always had a gift for elaborate sets and visuals and he more then continues that here. The second thing better about this Fog has got to be the special effects, they are very impressive. The fog itself is very creepy, and the ghosts and the ship are very scary and authentic.It does take the movie a while to get going, the first 30 minutes  are kinda slow, but once it gets going, your interest will definitely pick up. There is also some really cool death scenes and some pretty good suspense in some of the deeper fog scenes. I'd also like to give this movie some credit, you'd think with a theme like fog, some of the picture and scenery would be hard to see, the fist movie did have some problems with that, but not this one. You can see every scene shot in the fog clearly, not missing anything due to grain or too much fog.Sounds like I really liked it huh? well, it ain't all perfect people. The acting is pretty average, with a cast nobody would really know except for Selma Blair and if you watched alot of regular TV, which I don't, TV sucks. Tom Welling from WB's or UPN's (whats the difference) Tv show Smallville plays our main character/hero Nick. He is a pretty boy but a rather bland actor, and his girlfriend is played by Maggie Grace, from that show everyone can't live without, Lost. She suffers from the same problem Tom does, pretty to look at until she opens her mouth. Selma Blair does the only decent acting in the movie and though she is a main character, she is completely lost in the shuffle during the climax of the movie. Selma plays Stevie Wayne, the DJ from the lighthouse that Adrienne Barbeau played so perfectly in the first movie.I want to warn all of you, there are alot of details and plot points that are easy to miss, surprisingly, it's a pretty complicated plot that my wife and I had to watch twice because we have one of those roomates who can't shut the hell up during a movie!!! So we missed quite a bit during the last half hour and alot happened, but it all made sense after the second viewing and again I was really impressed with the storytelling.I read alot of your reviews and I think alot of people are tanking this for the wrong reasons. He didn't do this as a remake, or a sequel, he was very strict when he said he wanted to 'retool' it, he felt the first one was too vague and alot of people, even though they loved it, had alot of questions. Another reviewer claims he can't understand why the first one is considered a classic. I think if you look at most avid movie fans top 10 horror movies, The Fog is on 3 out 4, guaranteed!! I own the first one, and I'm pretty sure I will buy this, it's a good horror movie, and even though it also got the stupid 'unrated' tag, I highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one. I also rented Waiting with Ryan Reynolds, so I'll let ya know how that one was soon, I heard it was funny as hell...we'll see, catch ya later!!!acting.......2 stars, Avoided the dreaded 1 star thanks to Blairdirecting......3.5 stars, Stigmata's Wainwright does a faithfull adaptationspecial effects.....3.5 stars, Ghosts and the ship are way cool, the actual fog is something to see as wellhorror

If you are going to change things around when writing a remake of a horror favorite, at least make changes that improve upon the original, NOT make it worse. The motive for the original ghosts return was not only to get their gold, it was for a little something called revenge. There was absolutely no need to add on this whole storyline about the Elizabeth character having a link to Blake. The movie isn't as bad as everyone on here makes it out to be, the updated effects are good, the flashbacks to 1871 are interesting, and I do like the actors. The real let downs are that the characters are so differently played out from the ones in the original movie. No one appreciated seeing the whole lighthouse scene at the end being taken out, nor the beginning scenes when the town goes haywire. The scenes of the attacks on the Seagrass and at Stevie's house when the ghosts come for Andy are just aweful and in no way come close to comparison to the original. The attack at the weather station on Dan is cool though as is the way that they kill the lazy aunt babysitting Andy.

Caeiro ""Mediterranean Freak""","[3, 4]","I give 'The Fog' remake 3 stars based on one star for the acting, which wasn't bad from Welling, Grace, and Blair, one star of great special effects, and one star for being geniunely scary. It lost 2 stars because they don't explain what the Fog is all about in this version, and the other star is for creating that stupid storyline about Grace being one of the lepers incarnated 100 years later, and for the lose of Nancy's character in the original. In the original the story goes like this... the 6 (not 4) founders of Antonio Bay decided to murder all the lepers that particular night because they new that Fog Bank would role in and force the Leper ship to crash, burn, and sink. In the remake there is no explanation for the Fog. Also Jamie Lee Curtis' character is a passerby, not the maincharacter of the film; the remake makes the same character, played by Maggie Grace the central figure. Selma Blair got cheated out of that great sequence where she is trapped in the Lighthouse seeing the FOG rolling in and she has no where to go but up. Instead she gets rammed by a truck...granted it was startly, but not as spooky. Overall it was creepy. I especialy enjoyed seeing the updated methods of death imposed on the vistims...the lil boys aunt, the weather man, and the priest. But i really enjoyed was the scene where the Disk Jockie's lil boy was running franticaly from the FOG!

956183,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000CCBC9E,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 1]","As far as remakes goes, this new rendition of John Carpenter's classic 1980 original falls far short in terms of both acting and plot.The basic plot remains the same. A ship of lepers was betrayed by the town of Antonio Bay's founding fathers 100 years earlier.  Their ship was set afire, dooming everyone on board.  Now, the ghosts of those souls have come to take their revenge against the people of Antonio Bay.  Hidden within the fog, the ghosts begin their search for the descendants of those who killed them a century earlier.In this movie, Tom Welling stars as Nick Carter, the owner of the ""Seagrass"", a small fishing boat that Nick and his friend Spooner (DeRay Davis) use to take fishermen and young girls for trips on the water.  It is during one of these excursions that Spooner and two young girls discover the fog and the secrets that it contains.Maggie Grace stars as Nick's girlfriend Elizabeth Williams.  She's been away for six months, and since returning to Antonio Bay, she's had recurring nightmares about drowning.  Were these just dreams or a premonition of things to come?Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne, Adrienne Barbeau's role in the original film.  Stevie owns a lighthouse with a radio station located inside.  Stevie, along with her young son Andy, will have to draw on their inner strength later in the movie to face the mysterious fog.Finally, Adrian Hough stars as Father Malone, the hard-drinking priest of the local parish who is hiding a mortal secret from everyone; Father Malone's ancestor was one of the ones who burned the ship containing the lepers.Sometimes, remakes turn out to be as good as the original film, while other times, the remake just doesn't measure up.  This is one of the times that the original is far better than the remake.  I found the story in this movie much harder to follow.  Although the general plot remained similiar with the story of the lepers, there were some instances in this movie I had a hard time following, such as Elizabeth's dreams, and her unlikely ending at the end of the movie.

Yes, it was atmospheric and claustrophic, and it did have a couple of genuinely scary moments, but for the most part, I just felt like they could have done so much more with it than they did.  That was why when I heard they were remaking the movie, I was excited to see what they would do with it.Well, it honestly only took about 5 minutes before I heard the first whisperings in front of me and behind me about how poorly the film looked and sounded.  The direction, editing, choreography...  everything just seemed somewhat off and out of place.  The special effects were not an improvement at all, (even the cheesy ""glowing"" fog from the original was better than the horrible CGI Fog of this one).  The acting was stilted and wooden, and the dialogue was laughable.  Very quickly I realized that I was basically watching what should have been a straight-to-video horror movie.  And what's even worse is that as time went on, the movie got tedious, dull, and even preposterous at the end.  (At least the original succeeded in building some sort of tension).I highly recommend staying away from this movie.

As remakes go ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Dawn of the dead"" worked because they homaged their predecessors with a sense of grace, honour and style yet were terrifying in their own unique way. With THE FOG 2006, there is no style or grace only a visually beautiful looking film with no substance or atmosphere and zero scares.The original relied on what we didn't see to scare us and the idea that something could be outside our door was pretty chilling.

956196,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000CCBC9E,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 5]","Tom Welling heads up the cast of the remake of John Carpenter's ""The Fog.""  It takes place in a sleepy Oregon town where the founding fathers are about to be celebrated.  These men are looked upon as heroes for taking a small, uneventful community and miraculously turning it into a thriving Smalltown, USA.  However, the citizens of our sleepy little town have no idea what these men did in order to help the town thrive.  Unfortunately for them, they're about to find out.  When the fog rolls in on the eve of the town's celebration, it brings with it an old score longing to be settled.At first, this sounds like a wonderful tale of vengeance.  It's got the cool, foggy atmosphere and the impending doom that awaits the descendants of the town's founding fathers.  Unfortunately, this is overused and becomes nothing more than a boring, sluggish creepout flick.  Everytime something is about to happen, we see the fog.  The first couple of times I thought to myself, ""Oooh!  Here comes the fog!  Someone's gonna die!""  As the movie rolled along I thought, ""Please fog, kill'em and get it over with.""  When ol' Foggy's passengers finish their killin', we're given an ending worthy of a yawn.  It's a complete letdown.The characters were, for the most part, decent.  Welling and his love interest were a likeable couple, and given what they had to work with I think they did a good job.  The supporting cast was rather miniscule, and we never learn much about them.  Selma Blair is completely unbelieveable as a DJ and as a single mom.  Who's mother loves on their young son with a skimpy little t-shirt and some ""saucy"" black panties?  It was borderline incest.I must say that the extras on the DVD were pretty good.  We learn how the remake came to be.  We get to check out how all of that cool fog and the ghosts that ride it are created.  The best part of these extras is that it whets the appetite of those like myself who haven't viewed the 1980 original.  I've never seen the original ""The Fog,"" but this flick definitely made me want to check it out.If you're a huge fan of John Carpenter, check this flick out.  If you can't handle horror too well but want to say that you've seen a horror flick recently, rent this one.

956198,A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B000CCBC9E,"K. J. Bryant ""peachycream""","[6, 7]","Wow! Where do I begin? Every since the 90s, Hollywood has been on a path of re-making every classic horror film. It began with the ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Psycho"" and has continued on to the ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and now ""The Fog"". However, if ""Dawn of the Dead"" is considered a good remake, then ""The Fog"" must be seen as a disaster and an hopeless failure.The first ""Fog"" deserves to be a cult classic and is a good horror film, but I thought it could have used a couple of improvements. It was not Carpenter's best effort, but it still was an 8 out of 10 movie. This remake had potential because it could have corrected some of the plot holes from the first ""Fog"". Not surprisingly, the new Fog created new loopholes in the story and in addition had a terrible script.The characters here were typical. We have the naive young girl who senses bad things happening before anyone and who reconnects with her former boyfriend. There is even a token black guy who serves as the ""comic relief"" for the film and who unfortunately plays on black male stereotypes. Then there is the new Stevie Wayne, who struts around in panties, acted terribly by Selma Blair.In fact, Selma's acting is so terrible that people actually laughed at her in the movie theater. Her final scene in which she made her speech about 'something came out of the fog' was so bad. I almost choked from laughing. Maggie was only slightly better, but she always has a 'deer caught in headlights' look on her face and she truly got on my nerves. As for the other main and supporting actors, there was zero chemistry between characters, sub-par acting at best, no story continuity, and, most importantly, NO SCARE FACTOR.Overall, this needless remake was just BAD.

956204,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CCBC9E,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","I never thought that much of John Carpenter's original version of ""The Fog,"" but I have to admit that I think better of it now that I have endured this 2005 remake by Rupert Wainwright (""Stigmata"").  At least with that one there are fond memories of John Houseman as an old sea dog with a story to tell and Adrienne Barbeau as the DJ in the lighthouse.  Now we have Tom Welling from ""Smallville"" with a three days growth of beard as fisherman Nick Castle and Maggie Grace from ""Lost"" as his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams who gets back in town just in time for the fun with the fog.  At first she is the requisite damsel in distress, but then that part takes a twist.  Anyhow, they are the ones that things happen to outside the lighthouse as people are dying in horrible ways while Selma Blair as Stevie Wayne is doing her DJ thing while the fog rolls in and frets about what can happen to her son on a night like this.One complaint I want to make right away is that the fog in ""The Fog"" rolls in too quickly, which seems a strange comment to make for a film that seems overlong at 103 minutes (including three that makes this the ""unrated edition,"" a label whose cache value is next to nil given what has been foisted on us to date).  Slower would be more ominous, but apparently that is not what Wainwright wanted in this movie, even in the parts that demand some ominosity (or would it be ""ominousness""?).  Here the fog comes in fast and it comes in against the wind, so it cannot be a good thing.  But if the titular weather condition is not as creepy as you can imagine it being, that is not a good sign, whatever the instrument readings might be.This is one of those films where once upon a time, a long time ago, some people did something bad and now years later the people living there are going to have to pay for what those other people did.  We get a taste of what the founders of Antonio Bay did at the start of the movie, but you have to wait for the climax to get the rest of the story and understand, so to speak, what is now happening.  But I was sort of distracted by the idea of who was the catalyst for all this nonsense since it seemed such a chance occurrence to set everything in motion even with Cooper Layne's screenplay helping things along.I was bored to the point of distraction for most of this film, even as the body count climbed.  When we got to the twist at the end it barely registered (usually I would be thinking of how it could have worked better, but I just did not care).  I would be worried for Welling's film career but I saw the 100th episode of ""Smallville"" last night and ""Reckoning"" will certainly stand out on his resume more than this film.  If everybody else forgets about it, then he can too.  Final thought: This version of ""The Fog"" also made me think more highly of ""La Noche del terror ciego"" and the rest of Amando de Ossorio's ""Blind Dead"" movies.  At least they understood the idea of horror as something slow and creeping. Oh oh.  Now it strikes me that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was a better horror film than this version of ""The Fog.""",2,This fog rolls in and bores you to the point of distraction (if you are lucky),1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,3093,"['never', 'thought', 'much', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'version', 'Fog', 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'better', 'now', 'have', 'endured', '2005', 'remake', 'Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'Stigmata', 'least', 'one', 'are', 'fond', 'memories', 'John', 'Houseman', 'old', 'sea', 'dog', 'story', 'tell', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'DJ', 'lighthouse', 'Now', 'have', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Smallville', 'three', 'days', 'growth', 'beard', 'fisherman', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'girlfriend', 'Elizabeth', 'Williams', 'who', 'back', 'town', 'just', 'time', 'fun', 'fog', 'first', 'requisite', 'damsel', 'distress', 'then', 'part', 'twist', 'Anyhow', 'are', 'ones', 'things', 'happen', 'outside', 'lighthouse', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'horrible', 'ways', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Stevie', 'Wayne', 'doing', 'DJ', 'thing', 'fog', 'rolls', 'frets', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'son', 'night', 'this.One', 'complaint', 'want', 'make', 'right', 'away', 'fog', 'Fog', 'rolls', 'too', 'quickly', 'strange', 'comment', 'make', 'film', 'overlong', '103', 'minutes', 'including', 'three', 'unrated', 'edition', 'label', 'cache', 'value', 'next', 'nil', 'given', 'been', 'foisted', 'date', 'Slower', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'ominous', 'apparently', 'not', 'what', 'Wainwright', 'wanted', 'movie', 'even', 'parts', 'demand', 'ominosity', 'would', 'be', 'ominousness', 'Here', 'fog', 'fast', 'wind', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'titular', 'weather', 'condition', 'not', 'as', 'creepy', 'can', 'imagine', 'being', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'instrument', 'readings', 'might', 'be.This', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'once', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'people', 'did', 'something', 'bad', 'now', 'years', 'later', 'people', 'living', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'pay', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'did', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'founders', 'Antonio', 'Bay', 'did', 'start', 'movie', 'have', 'wait', 'climax', 'get', 'rest', 'story', 'understand', 'so', 'speak', 'what', 'now', 'happening', 'was', 'sort', 'distracted', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'catalyst', 'nonsense', 'seemed', 'such', 'chance', 'occurrence', 'set', 'everything', 'motion', 'even', 'Cooper', 'Layne', 'screenplay', 'helping', 'things', 'along.I', 'was', 'bored', 'point', 'distraction', 'most', 'film', 'even', 'body', 'count', 'climbed', 'When', 'got', 'twist', 'end', 'barely', 'registered', 'usually', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'would', 'be', 'worried', 'Welling', 'film', 'career', 'saw', '100th', 'episode', 'Smallville', 'last', 'night', 'Reckoning', 'will', 'certainly', 'stand', 'out', 'resume', 'more', 'film', 'everybody', 'else', 'then', 'can', 'too', 'Final', 'thought', 'version', 'Fog', 'also', 'made', 'think', 'more', 'highly', 'La', 'Noche', 'del', 'terror', 'ciego', 'rest', 'Amando', 'de', 'Ossorio', 'Blind', 'Dead', 'movies', 'least', 'understood', 'idea', 'horror', 'something', 'slow', 'creeping', 'Oh', 'oh', 'Now', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'was', 'better', 'horror', 'film', 'version', 'Fog']",N/A

They certainly didn't know what they were doing with Elizabeth.If they wanted a Ghost Busters Flick they should have gone differently with the special effects which are the only thing good here. They had the characters.It is a buckets of blood flick. A remake of a dreadful film.It begins with a horrible crime. Then goes to a hundred years later and a fishing day. From there it goes along a confused and sordid path to nowhere believable. The local politicians are having a festiveal to fish for tourists and thier dollars. Eventually they get what many voters dream of doing to thier's. It has a lot of bucket of blood scenes rather not worth getting sick about. Elizabeth has strange flashbacks.

956219,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B000CCBC9E,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","The Fog remake of 2005 might be the worst horror remake out there and that is saying a great deal.  There are dozens of bad horror remakes out there like the remake of Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Prom Night, Psycho, etc., but at least they had some degree of effort put into them.  Those remakes, as bad as they are, at least tried to do something different and to be entertaining, but this film has almost nothing going for it.  The Fog is a classic horror film, as well as one of my favorite horror movies of all time, and I am saddened that they treated it so poorly with the remake.  This movie has almost no good actors, no good performances, no scares, no suspense, no atmosphere, and no entertainment value.The story is pretty much the same as the original.  100 years ago a group of leopards came to the town of Antonio Bay, California to set up a colony.  However, the townspeople tricked them into crashing their ship and drowning.  Now these leopards have returned to get their revenge aided by a supernatural fog.Where do I begin describing what is wrong with this film.  The film has no good characters and hardly any good casting save two.  Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are in this film.  I am a fan of Tom Welling through Smallville and Maggie Grace through Lost, but neither of them is given anything to do and the script does not let them show off their acting talent at all.  All the other characters are basic horror film stereotypes like the token comic-relief black guy.  Most of these characters are just here to be used as cannon fodder.  The original film had interesting characters with great actors playing them, while this has nothing.The worst thing about this film is that it is ungodly boring.  The original film had a great atmosphere, but there is no atmosphere to speak of here.  It is not even remotely scary.  I kept waiting for a scary moment but it never came even at the end.  The score was nothing, while the score in the original is very memorable.  The ghosts are not remotely scary, mainly because they are all bad CGI.  The CG in this film is some of the worst I have seen.  Even the fog is CGI.  In the original the ghosts were all silhouettes and done all practically.  Everything was done with practical effects, while here everything is horrible CGI.The messed up the story really bad as well.  First of all we are told that the leopards were killed in 1880, but in the present time we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay even though the film clearly takes place in 2005.  So the makers of the film cannot even tell time right.  The ghost's motivations are really weird as well.  We assume they came back for revenge like in the original, but it does not seem like it.  At the end of the film the head ghost (spoiler) turns Maggie Grace into a ghost then they all leave (spoiler end).  So the ghosts did not even get their revenge.  The ending makes absolutely no sense.Overall, this film is complete garbage and a spit in the face to the original.  Skip it at all costs and just watch the original.

This remake, directed by Stigmata director Rupert Wainwright, is not only beyond bad, it's abysmal.  The eerie atmosphere and sense of dread are replaced with attractive stars (Smallville's Tom Welling and Lost's Maggie Grace, along with Selma Blair in Barbeau's role) to go with an incomprehensible storyline that has little to do with that of the original, and an ending that isn't just mind boggling and non-sensical, it's just plain ridiculous.

(What's with every girl wearing a bikini or underwear - even when the guys are dressed for winter? Never thought it would, but it really begins to grate! And check out the totally gratuitous thigh shot of Selma Blair when talking to her son in bed.) Newsflash - these alone do not a good horror movie make! And what about the totally pointless love scene slowing down Act 1? Huh? In the original, this works because it tells you about the instant attraction between Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins (who've just met for the first time). In this rubbish - given that the two characters have a prior relationship - it serves no purpose at all. As for scares, good luck finding one! Simply showing gore, ghostly footprints and spectres - normally all good things in a horror movie - doesn't do much if the context is poorly set-up. This is amateurish horror-by-numbers. It assumes that horror fans (and teenagers) are morons.You actually begin to feel sorry for how desperately they want to scare you - and how miserably they fail. And it's arrogant to change the original's brilliant story and characters if all you ca come up with is at the level of a daytime soap. If you can't do it better, why bother?

While he's come up with a couple of surprisingly decent minor flicks (Stigmata, Wolf Lake) in the meantime, The Fog does nothing to supplant itself in the public consciousness as Rupert Wainwright's most notable effort.While it is, to be sure, evidenced in the Hollywood archives that remakes that are too faithful are bombs (look at Gus Van Sant's ill-fated crack at remaking Psycho), it seems that Hollywood has always been fonder of going the other way. The Fog is a good example of this-- a remake that bears little resemblance to the original. It's not far enough away that one can look at it as its own film (which would have likely been a better move, though perhaps a reckless one), but it's nowhere near close enough to placate the rabid fans of the brilliant original (of which I'm one).A good number of subtexts in the original film have fallen by the wayside, most of them with one confusing change: the character of Nick Castle. Tom Atkins, a longtime Carpenter favorite, brought a creepiness to the role that sat uncomfortably with his status as reluctant hero, in no small part because he looked old enough to be Jamie Lee Curtis' father. The role is here reprised by Smallville's Tom Welling in his first big-screen leading role, and Welling's fresh-faced enthusiasm rings about as hollow as Tom Savini's thoroughly hideous decision, in his Night of the Living Dead remake, to turn Barbara from helpless catatonic into one-woman zombie-slaughtering army. As well, Jamie Lee Curtis' character, a hapless hitchhiker who had nothing to do with the town of Antonio Bay in the original, is now Castle's ex-girlfriend, coming back into town because ""something was calling me."" Played by Lost siren Maggie Grace (whom, this reviewer notes with some amusement, had not been born when the original film was released), Elizabeth definitely has a connection here, though there are some oddnesses in the script that make it seem as if her part had been rewritten very close to shooting and not checked properly enough; for example, she recognizes Machen and calls him by name, then a few seconds later, during a conversation with Nick, acts as if she'd never seen him before. There are little oddnesses like this scattered throughout the script, pulling the viewer far away from suspension of disbelief.It might have been a capable film had it stood on its own.

Most of the men are out for some crude T&A; most of the women are cardboard cut-outs.The movie is poorly edited. I wouldn't have fully understood the reason for the haunting in this version of The Fog if I hadn't first read the blurb on the DVD cover. Too many scenes were cut out or spliced into the action too late to make sense. Director Rupert Wainwright does refer to some of the differences between the original cut and the theatrical release of this film. In his commentary, he talks about the concessions that had to be made ""to the Studio"" to satisfy budgetary constraints and to speed up the action of the film to hold audience attention. I hadn't realized that the studios still had so much say in film content. I thought that kind of power went out with Sam Goldwyn. All this information, along with a lot of insights into the problems connected with shooting scenes in roiling waters, does make for a better-than-average DVD Director Commentary.But there remain other problems with the film itself. One of these is logic. A hash of re-animation goes on here. And it's not always clear why one character becomes re-animated, while another stays dead.I almost had decided this movie was a waste of time and was ready to quite it mid-way through, something my penurious nature rarely allows me to do. (I paid for this thing and by golly, I'm going to see everything there is to see!) But I hung in there, and I'm glad I did. The movie gets better as it goes along. It is saved by a number of striking visuals. There is a death-by-splinters-of-glass scene that is almost beautiful by virtue of the choreographing of the glass. There are striking, Wyeth-like tableaus of the old man on the misty beach - the strange setting he sees there - the image of him being drawn inexorably into the water. Then the haunting that ultimately comes fully manifest out of the fog has real virile power. I don't think you will soon forget its final embrace.So this fog bank is worth peering into.

956245,A155KXFRZCA7C,B000CCBC9E,"scherf.com ""scherf.com""","[0, 3]","I thought the ""Fog"" was a good remake and as such it is very predictable for at least the first half or first two thirds of the film. The makers of this new version stuck pretty much to the original storyline, and it were today's special effects and a good shot of creativity that made the movie better in the second half. Neither the acting nor the script is anything to get excited about as it sticks to the routine and it's not the best. In the case of Tom Welling you're hoping that at any moment he will have his ""Clark Kent"" super powers and during the romantic scenes with his girlfriend Elizabeth you're just waiting for Lana from ""Smallville"" to show up and give him a disappointed look. It's hard to shake that image if you're on TV with Smallville twice a night for at least five days a week.Anyway, the ""Fog"" is a nice little spooky ghoststory and the photography and the special effects are good and some people will find it scary. There's a lack of humor, but then the original didn't have that either. I think the storyline comes out in this new one much better than in the 1980 version.

956249,A1HJZ1SBR0ROHH,B000CCBC9E,"Shayne ""- Shayne""","[4, 7]","First off, I dont understand why so many people are being so hostle towards this film and the people who like it. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions. If someone liked this movie, let them, its ok! You are allowed to like it and you are allowed to hate it. Movies are made to entertain and if you were entertained by this, great! If not well, I'm sure there are other films that many other people hate but you like. Not everyone has to have the same thoughts about a film. Im still amazes at some of the *beep* that I read on these boards, the lack of courtesy is mind numbing.Lately I have noticed that far too many Amazon reviewers are just getting extremely harsh on films!! Now that either means they are far too critical or I am becoming far too soft, although I do admit I tend to like certain films or style of films more than others and horror happens to be one of those genres. I hadn't seen the original 1980 John Carpenter's The Fog until very recently and I was pleasantly surprised. It was low budget and had Carpenter's brilliant horror style to it. I anxiously awaited to see this remake with one of my favorite TV Actors in the lead role (Tom Welling.) I wasn't disappointed in the least. After last year's incredible Amityville Horror remake and now The Fog which is at least as good as the original. After all not a whole bunch has changed. Remarkably director Rupert Wainwright, who has mostly music videos to his credit, kept this remake very much on par with it's original. There were scenes that were almost lifted straight from the original...hey if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I like that theory!!!Tom Welling holds his own in his first leading non-teen role as Nick Castle, a charter boat Captain who's lost love shows up out of nowhere and draws him into the mystery surrounding their small town and island. If he continues on this path he just might be able to leave behind his teen image and his ""Clark Kent"" and break into films which I think would be awesome. He's tough and macho and pulls off the protector role quite well. Fellow TV Alumn Maggie Grace from ""Lost"" takes on the lead female role as Elizabeth who returns to their small town with nightmares about a scary past. She does a stellar job in the scream queen role that Jamie Lee Curtis originated. However in this remake her character is far more utilized than Curtis' ever was. Wainwright chose to make Elizabeth the central female character as opposed to Stevie Wayne who was more the central lead in the original. Selma Blair takes the role of radio DJ Stevie Wayne and she doesn't quite have the intensity necessary for the role. Perhaps after seeing the original I expected more from her character but her performance seemed very dry and rather emotionless. Her character was almost pointless and she was so vital to the original story. Welling and Grace have excellent chemistry together, hot in fact, would love to see them team up again.The film delivers some awesome scares and is still filmed in a gritty dark, very claustrophobic setting so it holds what the original did for movie goers. The remake does move at a little faster pace, it seems to have left behind the build up that the original had which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Faster pace, but perhaps leaves something behind in the plot. At times it feels like it's moving at breakneck speed and you're missing something, and it seems like the characters are moving from location to location without any explanation as to where they are which can leave you a little confused. The Ghost Story aspect of it has been changed slightly but it's still there and it's still all about vengeance. Everyone seems to find out about the killer fog, and the mystery behind it far too quickly. There is never much back story to anything. Nonetheless the chills and gore the film delivers make up for that. There are lots of times you'll jump out of your seat and although it's not quite as gory as the original it holds it's own for a PG-13 rated movie!! I think people are being far too harsh on this film, I think it's a decent scary, ghost story, slasher flick with good characters and a great setting. See this and then see Amityville Horror (remake) this Halloween and you'll be pleasantly scared crazy!!",5,Another fantastically made horror remake,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,4294,"['First', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'hostle', 'towards', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'Everyone', 'allowed', 'have', 'own', 'opinions', 'someone', 'liked', 'movie', 'let', 'ok', 'are', 'allowed', 'like', 'are', 'allowed', 'hate', 'Movies', 'are', 'made', 'entertain', 'were', 'entertained', 'great', 'not', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'films', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'hate', 'like', 'Not', 'everyone', 'have', 'same', 'thoughts', 'film', 'Im', 'still', '*beep*', 'read', 'boards', 'lack', 'courtesy', 'mind', 'numbing.Lately', 'have', 'noticed', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'films', 'Now', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'critical', 'am', 'becoming', 'far', 'too', 'soft', 'do', 'admit', 'tend', 'like', 'certain', 'films', 'style', 'films', 'more', 'others', 'horror', 'happens', 'be', 'one', 'genres', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', '1980', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fog', 'very', 'recently', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'had', 'Carpenter', 'brilliant', 'horror', 'style', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'see', 'remake', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'Actors', 'lead', 'role', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'least', 'last', 'year', 'incredible', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'remake', 'now', 'Fog', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'not', 'whole', 'bunch', 'changed', 'Remarkably', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Wainwright', 'who', 'mostly', 'music', 'videos', 'credit', 'kept', 'remake', 'very', 'much', 'par', 'original', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', 'almost', 'lifted', 'straight', 'original', 'hey', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'like', 'theory', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'own', 'first', 'leading', 'non-teen', 'role', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'charter', 'boat', 'Captain', 'who', 'lost', 'love', 'up', 'nowhere', 'draws', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'small', 'town', 'island', 'path', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'teen', 'image', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'break', 'films', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'tough', 'macho', 'protector', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'Fellow', 'TV', 'Alumn', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'nightmares', 'scary', 'past', 'stellar', 'job', 'scream', 'queen', 'role', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'originated', 'However', 'remake', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'utilized', 'Curtis', 'ever', 'was', 'Wainwright', 'chose', 'make', 'Elizabeth', 'central', 'female', 'character', 'opposed', 'Stevie', 'Wayne', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'central', 'lead', 'original', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'role', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Stevie', 'Wayne', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'intensity', 'necessary', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'seeing', 'original', 'expected', 'more', 'character', 'performance', 'seemed', 'very', 'dry', 'rather', 'emotionless', 'character', 'was', 'almost', 'pointless', 'was', 'so', 'vital', 'original', 'story', 'Welling', 'Grace', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'together', 'hot', 'fact', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'team', 'up', 'again.The', 'film', 'delivers', 'awesome', 'scares', 'still', 'filmed', 'gritty', 'dark', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'what', 'original', 'did', 'movie', 'goers', 'remake', 'move', 'little', 'faster', 'pace', 'have', 'left', 'behind', 'build', 'up', 'original', 'had', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'Faster', 'pace', 'perhaps', 'something', 'plot', 'times', 'moving', 'breakneck', 'speed', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something', 'characters', 'are', 'moving', 'location', 'location', 'explanation', 'where', 'are', 'can', 'leave', 'little', 'confused', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'aspect', 'been', 'changed', 'slightly', 'still', 'still', 'vengeance', 'Everyone', 'find', 'out', 'killer', 'fog', 'mystery', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'never', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'anything', 'chills', 'gore', 'film', 'delivers', 'make', 'up', 'are', 'lots', 'times', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'seat', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'gory', 'original', 'own', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'harsh', 'film', 'think', 'decent', 'scary', 'ghost', 'story', 'flick', 'good', 'characters', 'great', 'setting', 'See', 'then', 'see', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'remake', 'Halloween', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'scared', 'crazy']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[10, 18]","Of all the many horror remakes over the last few years, I think 2005's ""The Fog"" may have actually surpassed its source film by the farthest margin.  No disrespect at all to the 1979 original, but this new version is scarier, sexier, made with much higher production values, and in my opinion just plain better.  The characters felt more real to me and more relateable, the tale of the origin of the prescences that are haunting Antonio Bay - which was well-done the first time around - was something I just felt a lot more here and made the whole package more potent.  And the Fog itself, for the first time, actually Looks like what they were apparantly aiming for all along - frightening; a thing that could actually be alive; an actual character in the film instead of just a harbinger of something else.Near the anniversary of the long-ago founding of Antonio Bay, something is rising from the bottom of the sea, or Returning from it.  Something old, powerful, and vengeful, and something that's going to - over the next few days - catch up not just a few people but the entire population of the island in its violent and mysterious path.  The fog effects are incredibly well done, genuinely scary, and the cinematography throughout the whole movie is outstanding.  One of the few flaws of the movie is that a couple of the characters behave in rather unadvisable manners given the circumstances; fortunately the general likability of most of the characters keeps the occasional lack of brightness from being too glaring a shortcoming.  Or chalk it all up to a hitheto unseen aspect of the fog that lulls those who come into contact with it into a subtly dreamlike state where they abandon their wits temporarily.

Everyone else is doin' it!""  Yeah, but that doesn't mean YOU should do it. But, nevertheless, here it is a remake to Carpenter's 1980 classic that sucks like the biggest black hole with no ending in sight (""The Fog"" will land with a thud on DVD January 24th, 2006 in it's original PG-13 format or in an unrated format, either way the film still sucks).The plot is still the same: Antonio Island or Bay (take your pick) is celebrating its 125 years of existence. A new monument to the towns three founding fathers has been erected right out in front of town hall. But, their is an ominous backstory to the town's origins & the citizens of Antonio Island are going to pay for it with their very lives. An unholy fog has rolled onto shore mysteriously killing anyone in its path. Its up to the towns descendents to figure out the mystery of the fog before its too late.Carpenter is without a doubt one of the true masters of suspense & horror. With the 1980 original version to ""The Fog"" he brought a great ghost story to the screen with the right amount of atmosphere, suspense, & with his trademark score ""The Fog"" remains one of his best films.The remake, however, is a different story entirely. Its crap. Every single frame of this film sucks.The characters are two-dimensional & after seeing the original a few times over the years, I couldn't really visualize anyone else in these roles. Tom Welling, Selma Blair & the entire cast are an absolute waste. Blair doesn't have the purr that Adrienne Barbeau had as Stevie Wayne, Welling wasn't believable as Castle let alone a fisherman, & the Father Malone & Old Man Macon characters get little less than 5 minutes of screentime - combined.The tweaking of the original story is really lame. Did we really need to see the whole backstory of the Elizabeth Dane plotline? Hal Holbrook's, Father Malone did a perfect job of reading from his grandfather's diary with out the need of one flashback, or an extra tug from his drinking flask! Has American society become so fu**ing attention defecit disorientated that we need to have everything spelled out for us? Leave a lot to the imagination - it's more creepier that way.The ending is the worst insult to Carpenter fans. What in the hell were they thinking?!

Hunter-Selbrede,"[1, 2]","I didn't see the original, but I believe that at least half of any and all reviews I've read for this remake have been lifted from reviews of the original John Carpenter version.  For instance - 100th year anniversary (let's do the math, 1871 + 100 = not 2005), clippership lured onto the rocks for treasure (didn't see that, did see four guys putting their hands into the middle of the circle and all but yelling ""BREAK"" as they head into the water to score the ultimate touchdown), and 'after the blood of decendents of the four men' (okay, we'll assume that the one guy who got snatched off the boat on the way back from their score already had some kiddies back at home).As you know the quasi-evil fog is going after the descendants of the original four, as soon as I saw the four people out partying on a boat in the present time, I say to my husband, ""I'll bet you that this is the first black character in the history of scary movies to NOT die,"" and he didn't, but only because he locked himself in a freezer that looks impossible to close from the inside, and naturally he is immediately suspected of the murders of the other three in another time consuming subplot that could have been spent on a plot in general.Pretty much everything is expected: kid on the phone with his mother, who tells him NOT to go on the beach because of some freaky phenomenon that flew off something he found on the beach.  The kid promises and whereas he'd shown no intent on going to the beach before, fasterthanthis he's on the beach.  The male lead is chastised by his employee that his girlfriend, who ran 3000 miles away 6 month ago is going to know about him sleeping with somebody else; sure enough, he picks her up as she's hitchhiking (how she hitchhiked across to the island is a curiousity as he meets her on his way leaving port and has to turn around to take her back to the portside town).  This same girlfriend upon entering her mother's home, not only do you, but the semi-ex boyfriend wait around for her to be thrown out within a minute.Then there are the burning questions such as 'there's only about fifteen minutes left on this movie, when is the horror going to start?'  Or, 'why are these people who have grown up there, no doubt been schooled there, etc. only just now noticing all the prominently displayed photos that show that prior to 1871 the island's biggest house was a shed the size of an outhouse, and then in 1871 suddenly looks like a young Seattle'?  Plus, 'who the hell is this beachbum who seems to know something we don't - oops, he's dead?'  And my personal favorite, why does the runaway girlfriend who is having nightmares about the place manage to show up on the day it's going to hell, and why does she look like the wife of the captain of the doomed ship in 1871?'The kid, despite his immediate disobedience, is the only person who sees the unnatural fog coming and has the sense to run like hell and attempt to seal all the cracks in his door so the fog can't slip through.  His mother is the only one with any real bravado, which means she basically makes it back to her kid in one piece, we'll ignore her idiotic attachment to her lighthouse radio-station while leaving her kid forever under the care of his boring aunt, even once she's seen the psychic mojo fireball of doom.  You wonder when she ever had time to give birth anyway - she's always at the lighthouse day and night, flirting with a weatherman while carrying on an affair with the male lead, no clue as to who the kid's father is).  Tom Welling is Tom Welling - you keep wanting to tell him to shave and go use his Clark Kent/Smallville laser vision to save everybody.  Maggie Grace is Lost, and ironically ends up as dead as her Lost character... i.e. she turns into a ghost, joins the dead captain into leading his people back to the sea (so much for revenge), and generally makes no sense at all.My one consolation is I watched this on Pay Per View, which means I'm only out $3.99 rather than the price of a DVD or theater tickets.",2,What the...?,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,4035,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'original', 'believe', 'least', 'half', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'remake', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'reviews', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'instance', '100th', 'year', 'anniversary', 'let', 'do', 'math', '1871', '+', '100', '=', 'not', '2005', 'clippership', 'lured', 'rocks', 'treasure', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'did', 'see', 'four', 'guys', 'putting', 'hands', 'middle', 'circle', 'yelling', 'BREAK', 'head', 'water', 'score', 'ultimate', 'touchdown', 'blood', 'decendents', 'four', 'men', 'okay', ""'ll"", 'assume', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'snatched', 'off', 'boat', 'way', 'back', 'score', 'already', 'had', 'kiddies', 'back', 'home', 'know', 'quasi-evil', 'fog', 'going', 'descendants', 'original', 'four', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'four', 'people', 'out', 'partying', 'boat', 'present', 'time', 'say', 'husband', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'first', 'black', 'character', 'history', 'scary', 'movies', 'NOT', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'locked', 'freezer', 'impossible', 'close', 'inside', 'naturally', 'immediately', 'suspected', 'murders', 'other', 'three', 'time', 'consuming', 'subplot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'plot', 'general.Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'expected', 'kid', 'phone', 'mother', 'who', 'NOT', 'go', 'beach', 'freaky', 'phenomenon', 'flew', 'something', 'found', 'beach', 'kid', 'promises', 'whereas', ""'d"", 'shown', 'intent', 'going', 'beach', 'fasterthanthis', 'beach', 'male', 'lead', 'chastised', 'employee', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'ran', '3000', 'miles', 'away', '6', 'month', 'ago', 'going', 'know', 'sleeping', 'somebody', 'else', 'sure', 'enough', 'up', 'hitchhiking', 'how', 'hitchhiked', 'island', 'curiousity', 'way', 'leaving', 'port', 'turn', 'around', 'take', 'back', 'portside', 'town', 'same', 'girlfriend', 'entering', 'mother', 'home', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'semi-ex', 'boyfriend', 'wait', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'minute.Then', 'are', 'burning', 'questions', 'such', 'only', 'about', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'left', 'movie', 'when', 'horror', 'going', 'start', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'there', 'doubt', 'been', 'schooled', 'there', 'etc', 'only', 'just', 'now', 'noticing', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'photos', 'show', 'prior', '1871', 'island', 'biggest', 'house', 'was', 'shed', 'size', 'outhouse', 'then', '1871', 'suddenly', 'young', 'Seattle', 'hell', 'beachbum', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'oops', 'dead', 'personal', 'favorite', 'why', 'runaway', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'having', 'nightmares', 'place', 'manage', 'show', 'up', 'day', 'going', 'hell', 'why', 'look', 'wife', 'captain', 'doomed', 'ship', '1871', 'kid', 'immediate', 'disobedience', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'unnatural', 'fog', 'coming', 'sense', 'run', 'hell', 'attempt', 'seal', 'cracks', 'door', 'fog', 'ca', ""n't"", 'slip', 'mother', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'bravado', 'basically', 'back', 'kid', 'one', 'piece', ""'ll"", 'ignore', 'idiotic', 'attachment', 'lighthouse', 'radio-station', 'leaving', 'kid', 'forever', 'care', 'boring', 'aunt', 'even', 'seen', 'psychic', 'mojo', 'fireball', 'doom', 'wonder', 'when', 'ever', 'had', 'time', 'give', 'birth', 'anyway', 'always', 'lighthouse', 'day', 'night', 'flirting', 'weatherman', 'carrying', 'affair', 'male', 'lead', 'clue', 'who', 'kid', 'father', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'keep', 'wanting', 'tell', 'shave', 'go', 'use', 'Clark', 'Kent/Smallville', 'laser', 'vision', 'save', 'everybody', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Lost', 'ironically', 'up', 'as', 'dead', 'Lost', 'character', 'i.e', 'ghost', 'dead', 'captain', 'leading', 'people', 'back', 'sea', 'so', 'much', 'revenge', 'generally', 'sense', 'all.My', 'one', 'consolation', 'watched', 'Pay', 'Per', 'View', ""'m"", 'only', 'out', '3.99', 'rather', 'price', 'DVD', 'theater', 'tickets']",N/A

There definitely is a slump in Hollywood, and look no further than this dreadful remake of John Carpenter's 1980 flick, 'The Fog', for proof that Hollywood is on a losing streak.The 1980 original is not a classic that was beggining to be remade, but I guess having the name of John Carpenter attached, and the current trend of horror remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror) made this seem like a can't-lose situation.  Well, the result is one of the worst films of the year.  Twenty minutes into this film, you will know this is a stinker.The basic storyline revolves ghosts exacting revenge on a town via a fog.  It is preposterous but at least Carpenter was able to create some effective chills through spooky atmosphere in his version.  This remake is not scary; just silly.The cast is uniformly bad.  Tom Welling's one good moment involves him taking his shirt off to display his well-toned body.  His co-star Maggie Grace is neither charming or appealing.  They both come off like models on their first film set.The movie even features a drunken priest - who is drunk in every scene.  It's so laughable, although that is not as funny as the  scene where a character finds a man frozen in a freezer - and it's clear this character has been locked up overnight - yet he's still alive.It's obvious this film was made for a quick buck.

I went ahead and saw it as I was curious to say the least. The trailers made it look like there was some suspense to found within the film. Some of the shots AND dialogue is actually lifted straight from Carpenter's version. Unfortunately, the hot young ""actors"" take any reality out of the production. A sea-worthy hot young stud that runs a fishing boat (filled with hot strippers btw). Yeah, right. His hot girlfriend and the sexy young radio dj that the town listens to. Where is this fictional sea town where most of the residents are 25 and great looking? The f/x are really good as is the cinematography. The movie LOOKS really good. No doubt about it. The music is intense and subtle also. The pirates are kept hidden for MOST of the film, but when they are revealed, it's all over. Hello! Pirates Of The Caribbean called. They want their characters back! Had they splashed some gore into this film and left the rest alone, I would have enjoyed it 1000 times more. As it is, it's a sterile, safe family movie with nothing really horrific at all. What happened to the swords and hay hooks from the original picture? These pirates don't even carry forks! Every death is ""supernatural"". Oooooh. Scary stuff. Hopefully with the recent success of Hostel and Underworld Evolution, Hollywood will start producing more hardcore R rated horror movie. PG-13 is a rating for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith movies. Not horror classics! I cannot wait for a REAL remake of The Fog in a few years. Maybe I'll make it myself.

Director Rupert Wainwright did much better with this than Stigmata, plus his ""motive"" for the fog's appearance makes more sense here, but John Carpenter's direction style is hard to beat, but RW comes close here. The acting isn't oscar-worthy, but decent, and like the original, the setting and atmosphere is very creepy when the fog arrives. I feel like a broken record here, when creators re-makeclassics, they aren't always trying to copy the original scene for scene, scary movies are getting very predictable these days, and John Carpenter is probably old enough to retire, Wes Craven is still doing movies and they're fairly decent, yes, this includes the Scream series.

The new one is about the same if you go by my description of my memory of the first one. Selma Blair is just a really bad actress. She is monotone and has no charisma and delivers her lines like she is zonked on prozac or something. The Smallville guy is the main hero and he isn't very good either. The rest of the cast is pretty blah too. This is a straight forward ghost story, no gore and little effects.

956270,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000CCBC9E,William R. Hancock,"[3, 4]","The new (2005) version of John Carpenter's ""The Fog"" is an all-too-common-these-days case of the special effects ""tail"" wagging the ""dog"" (i.e. the movie story). The original film was an entertaining, eerily atmospheric little chiller that, for themost part worked...even if it DIDN'T have the much-ballyhooed(overmuch so, I have began to feel) CGI working for it. Having gone back and watched it again after seeing this new version, I find the ""old school"" effects to be just fine (thank you very much). They work to move the story...NOT to take it over. Thereare times when these CGI people just go nuts in their trying to razzle-dazzle the viewing audience. They go overboard and ruin the pyschological impact of what they are trying to achieve. Strong case in point here is the death of Father Malone (a primary character in the original film , relegated in the re-make to a seconday also-ran). In the original, Hal Holbrook,in a strong performance, wanders back into his church chapel trying to figure out why the Captain Blake character didn't kill him when he had the chance earlier. Suddenly Malone senses he is not alone. He turns and sees Blake's ghostly crew materialized again in the church. Then another quick turn shows Blake, himself, behind Malone, swinging a decapitating cutlass.""Chok"". Great ending.In the new version Malone dies a good bit before the end , in a rather silly manner. With everyone ganged into City Hallinstead of the church, some glass display cases explode aroundthe good Padre and then the slivers and shards do an elaborateaerial circling around him before slicing through his body a shard at a time. Visually INTERESTING (especially if you are anFX geek), but totally lacking the sudden POWER of the Carpenteroriginal.Many changes are here. In the original story the clipperElizabeth Dane carried six people aboard...Blake and five crew.They were paying the townspeople for a small plot of land a mile away. They were done away with in a fog by the building ofa bonfire on the beach to supposedly guide them safely to shore through the treacherous reef. The bonfire, however, was built in a location to run them ON to the reef and did just that. The Dane broke up and the six men died in the pounding surf.The new version goes way beyond six people. It depicts the Dane as carrying an entire leper colony and numbers men, women, and children as its cargo. And it gives Captain Blake a wife.Instead of luring the ship onto the reef in a fog, the newversion has the founding townsmen go out into the bay to rob and murder the newcomers, setting the ship on fire in the process.This gives the producers more body count potential. Six lives for six lives is out the door. Now all bets are off.In the original, Carpenter cast people in character roles who LOOKED like real average people who might live in your town or mine. Tom Atkins was a ""regular guy"" as Nick Castle, and old enough to be believable as a guy who owned a fishing boat. Tom ""Superboy"" Welling is too pretty for words and doesn't fit the character concept one bit. Selma Blair is decent enough asStevie Wayne, the lighthouse DJ, but her character...essentially the lead role in the original ensemble...has been regulated to second-banana level (with Welling's Nick Castle taking the lead from her). Adrienne Barbeau's Stevie was a stronger, more effectively realized character.Jamie Lee Curtis's hitchiker has been been turned into acenterpiece of the new version. Maggie Grace becomes a hometown girl come home, and a former paramour of Welling's to boot. Butshe developes as more than that  and, in flashbacks, she starts being shown as Captain Blake's wife back on the Elizabeth Dane. And in the strange ending sequence, she ""morphs out"" with Blake in the Antonio Bay cemetery. Seems to ""go ghost"" with him. This is a bit weird, since she has been flesh and blood up to then. She was born in the town, grew up in the town, and has been very much ALIVE in the town up till now. Now, perhaps she was the RE-INCARNATION, of Mrs. Blake...I'll grant you that...but in order to ""go ghost"" at the end, she would need to DIE (like Mrs. Muir did in the 1940s)first...maybe leave a BODY in the graveyard, ya THINK? But no, she just goes from flesh to mist in the arms of ol' Cap'n Blake and swirls on outta here with him. A bit too much of a stretch, I think. So why do the ending like that? Why HECK!! Don't you KNOW!!!! So you can do some more COOL CGI just for the hell of it!!! Doesn't matter if it makes any SENSE or not...it just LOOKS ""Baaaaaaad""!In summation, this is a decent enough flick. Fun to watch.It has its moments. But if you REALLY want to see ""The Fog""check out the original.

956272,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000CCBC9E,Wuchak,"[4, 10]","This 2005 remake of John Carpenter's ""The Fog"" (1980) stars Smallville's Tom Welling and Maggie Grace & Selma Blair.THE PLOT: A prosperous island community in the Great Northwest is eerily beset upon by a mysterious fog -- a fog full of leperous ghosts who have come back from the dead to wreak vengeance on the town for honoring the four men who burned them alive and stole their treasure chest over a century past.Man, I don't know what film these negative reviewers here at Amazon have seen, but it certainly wasn't the one I saw. Seriously, these negative reviews are ridiculous! I'm not a John Carpenter afficionado but I did like his original version of ""The Fog."" It was slow and it wasn't gorey, but it had great locations (Point Reyers/Bodega Bay, California) and a palpable eerie MOOD; and I can tell you with zero bias that this 2005 remake is superior on practically every level (unless your an uber-fan of Adrienne Barbeau or Jamie Lee Curtis).-- The fog is more menacing. In fact, the F/X in general are all-around superior, in particular the various leperous ghosts that appear in the fog. I love the visual where the fog forms a creepy face.-- The story isn't fast-paced by any means, but it's not as slow (and boring) as the original.-- The eerie mood is at least on a par with the original.-- The scenic locations are at least as good as well, but I give 'em the edge. It was filmed on Bowen Island and Cowhichan Bay (Vancouver Island), British Columbia, both not far from Vancouver.-- The scenic and mysterious visuals are awe-inspiring.-- The score is on a par with the original with the exeption of the end-credits piece, which was absolutely stellar in Carpenter's film.-- The historic events of the leper ship colony are more fleshed out.-- The brief zombie scene is scarier and just all-around better done.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a fast-paced slasher gorefest, you won't like this movie. If you're anal about Carpenter's original film, you won't like this remake. If, however, you're in the mood for a well-done, atmospheric, spooky and aesthetically pleasing mystery/horror picture, this 2005 version of ""The Fog"" will likely trip your trigger.",4,BETTER than the original,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,2184,"['2005', 'remake', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fog', '1980', 'Smallville', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Maggie', 'Grace', 'Selma', 'Blair.THE', 'PLOT', 'prosperous', 'island', 'community', 'Great', 'Northwest', 'eerily', 'beset', 'upon', 'mysterious', 'fog', 'fog', 'full', 'leperous', 'ghosts', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'wreak', 'vengeance', 'town', 'honoring', 'four', 'men', 'who', 'burned', 'alive', 'stole', 'treasure', 'chest', 'century', 'past.Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'saw', 'Seriously', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'not', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'afficionado', 'did', 'like', 'original', 'version', 'Fog', 'was', 'slow', 'was', ""n't"", 'gorey', 'had', 'great', 'locations', 'Point', 'Reyers/Bodega', 'Bay', 'California', 'palpable', 'eerie', 'MOOD', 'can', 'tell', 'zero', 'bias', '2005', 'remake', 'superior', 'practically', 'level', 'uber-fan', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'fog', 'more', 'menacing', 'fact', 'F/X', 'general', 'are', 'all-around', 'superior', 'particular', 'various', 'leperous', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'fog', 'love', 'visual', 'where', 'fog', 'creepy', 'face.', 'story', ""n't"", 'fast-paced', 'means', 'not', 'slow', 'boring', 'original.', 'eerie', 'mood', 'least', 'par', 'original.', 'scenic', 'locations', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'well', 'give', 'edge', 'was', 'filmed', 'Bowen', 'Island', 'Cowhichan', 'Bay', 'Vancouver', 'Island', 'British', 'Columbia', 'not', 'far', 'Vancouver.', 'scenic', 'mysterious', 'visuals', 'are', 'awe-inspiring.', 'score', 'par', 'original', 'exeption', 'end-credits', 'piece', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'Carpenter', 'film.', 'historic', 'events', 'leper', 'ship', 'colony', 'are', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out.', 'brief', 'zombie', 'scene', 'scarier', 'just', 'all-around', 'better', 'done.BOTTOM', 'LINE', ""'re"", 'mood', 'fast-paced', 'slasher', 'gorefest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', ""'re"", 'anal', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'remake', 'however', ""'re"", 'mood', 'well-done', 'atmospheric', 'spooky', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'mystery/horror', 'picture', '2005', 'version', 'Fog', 'will', 'likely', 'trip', 'trigger']",N/A

Just an overall decent movie to check out. Some parts were kinda cheesy but some were good. The part where the fog busts out Nick's windows, then about an hour later if shows his truck with windows on it, a movie mistake I just found by not trying to find them lol. And its sort of like the main actors are the only people in the whole city, LOL. There is no civilians or anything, sort of weird if you ask me? Had some decent effects in it.

But oh brother, was this BAD.I'm not upset with the fact that this was yet another installment in the endless parade of remakes, or that the story was changed somewhat from John Carpenter's ""The Fog"".  In fact, what's the point of a remake if you aren't going to change anything?  Otherwise, it's more of a redo than a remake.  For those who haven't seen it and still plan to even after reading this review, I won't spoil the story.What made this movie so bad, in my opinion, was simply the fact that the casting was just plain horrible.  None of the ""actors"" in this movie could act their way out of a wet paper bag, and every single actor in the original Fog was far superior to, and much more likeable than, the ones in the remake.  From Stevie Wayne all the way down to Mrs. Kobritz.The effects in this movie were okay, and... well, that's about it.  Not that this movie couldn't have been good, it's just that no effort was really put into getting a solid cast, or to really write a good script for that matter.  The whole movie was just rushed and thrown together.  Fancy special effects just don't cut it for me.  If I don't buy into the actors' performances, a movie just doesn't work for me.  There's not much to say about the movie itself.  It's a remake, so we all know the basic storyline, so there's no real surprises, and the movie was not creepy or convincing at all.Until Hollywood starts putting a respectable effort into their so-called ""modern horror"", meaning that they get good actors instead of just the best looking young people they can scrape up off the streets to play the lead roles, and also inventing some new and fresh ideas instead of just remaking every movie ever made, then Hollywood is not getting any more of my hard earned $$$.  It's no wonder the box office is struggling so mightily.",1,"Until something changes, modern horror isn't getting my $$$",1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,2088,"['Okay', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'shown', 'critics', 'remake', 'Fog', 'hit', 'theatres', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'anyway', 'just', 'original', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movies', 'time', 'oh', 'brother', 'was', 'BAD.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'upset', 'fact', 'was', 'yet', 'installment', 'endless', 'parade', 'remakes', 'story', 'was', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Fog', 'fact', 'what', 'point', 'remake', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'anything', 'Otherwise', 'more', 'redo', 'remake', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'still', 'plan', 'even', 'reading', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story.What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'opinion', 'was', 'simply', 'fact', 'casting', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'horrible', 'None', 'actors', 'movie', 'could', 'act', 'way', 'wet', 'paper', 'bag', 'single', 'actor', 'original', 'Fog', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'ones', 'remake', 'Stevie', 'Wayne', 'way', 'Mrs.', 'Kobritz.The', 'effects', 'movie', 'were', 'okay', 'well', 'Not', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'good', 'just', 'effort', 'was', 'really', 'put', 'getting', 'solid', 'cast', 'really', 'write', 'good', 'script', 'matter', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'rushed', 'thrown', 'together', 'Fancy', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'actors', 'performances', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'movie', 'remake', 'know', 'basic', 'storyline', 'real', 'surprises', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'creepy', 'convincing', 'all.Until', 'Hollywood', 'putting', 'respectable', 'effort', 'so-called', 'modern', 'horror', 'meaning', 'get', 'good', 'actors', 'instead', 'just', 'best', 'looking', 'young', 'people', 'can', 'scrape', 'up', 'streets', 'play', 'lead', 'roles', 'also', 'inventing', 'new', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'instead', 'just', 'remaking', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'getting', 'more', 'hard', 'earned', 'wonder', 'box', 'office', 'struggling', 'so', 'mightily']",N/A

Come on, the girl in the car wreck scene hits her head on the dash, but then in the next scene she's in the middle of the road? What? And she knocks on the door looking for the priest when the door is padlocked on the outside? At least try and make the story coherent.This movie has the worst direction i have seen in years, and the acting is terrible (i mean come on, three dead bodies on a ship and the lead actress shrieked briefly and then goes looking around the ship like she's trying to find a Pepsi). I've seen more convincing acting on reality tv, if ya know what i mean. There is no tension, no feeling of anything tangible at all, and that's what made the original a classic. Only Tom Welling and Selma Blair are worth seeing here. The best quality of the movie is the soundtrack.And of course, they destroyed what made the original so much a cult favorite. It was great because you saw only one scene with anything remotely resembling a ghost in it, other than that it relied on atmosphere and tension, ie. story over effects (what a concept!) There's a reason it was called the Fog and not ""the lame ghost ship"".But this is just another slasher/undead flick that i could barely sit through.
