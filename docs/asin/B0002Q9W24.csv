843671,A3MECYYIZJA8JJ,B0002Q9W24,"Midnight Run ""5000""","[4, 5]","I really wanted to like this one. It gives the refreshing promise of an anime without goofy love triangles, mecha, or crazy fight scenes involving lots of screaming, powerups and little actual fighting. However 707r can't decide wether it is going to be a military drama, a comedy or a suspense thriller. Too many plot devices are introduced without any follow through, and it is over before you know it and you are left feeling empty. The main Bad Guy (TM) is your typical sociopath bent on ridding the sea of violence and war and he goes about this by destroying all other submarines. Makes sense, huh? Plus he has unlimited resources and no explanation for his motives. The Good Guy (R) is out of place because in contrast to all the serious looking characters, he looks like a goofy cartoon character and is seemingly drawn by another anime team. Yet his skills are far more then they seem and outweigh the fact that his sub (even the later improved one) is supposedly not very cutting edge. The fighting scenes between the subs are well animated and gripping and reminded me of my favroite sub movies like Crimson Tide, Hunt for Red October and Das Boot but in the end, too many plot elments are touched upon, but never explored in depth. I have a feeling this was the pilot to a series that was never produced.",2,"Promises much, delivers little.",1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,1316,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'one', 'refreshing', 'promise', 'anime', 'goofy', 'love', 'triangles', 'mecha', 'crazy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'involving', 'lots', 'screaming', 'powerups', 'little', 'actual', 'fighting', 'However', '707r', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'wether', 'going', 'be', 'military', 'drama', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Too', 'many', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'introduced', 'follow', 'know', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'main', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'TM', 'typical', 'sociopath', 'bent', 'ridding', 'sea', 'violence', 'war', 'destroying', 'other', 'submarines', 'Makes', 'sense', 'huh', 'unlimited', 'resources', 'explanation', 'motives', 'Good', 'Guy', 'R', 'place', 'contrast', 'serious', 'looking', 'characters', 'goofy', 'cartoon', 'character', 'seemingly', 'drawn', 'anime', 'team', 'skills', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'then', 'seem', 'outweigh', 'fact', 'sub', 'even', 'later', 'improved', 'one', 'supposedly', 'not', 'very', 'cutting', 'edge', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'subs', 'are', 'well', 'animated', 'gripping', 'reminded', 'favroite', 'sub', 'movies', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Das', 'Boot', 'end', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'elments', 'are', 'touched', 'never', 'explored', 'depth', 'have', 'feeling', 'was', 'pilot', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'produced']",N/A
