I love Curious George, but I thought a Halloween special would be more light hearted- and more about the fun parts of Halloween. (Trick or treating, fall festivals, getting dressed up, etc.) I thought it left much to be desired. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known what it was about. I feel like by the time she is old enough to watch it without getting scared, she'll be out of the Curious George phase.",2,Left much to be desired.,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,460,"['4', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'terrified', 'film', 'love', 'Curious', 'George', 'thought', 'Halloween', 'special', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'light', 'hearted-', 'more', 'fun', 'parts', 'Halloween', 'Trick', 'treating', 'fall', 'festivals', 'getting', 'dressed', 'up', 'etc', 'thought', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'had', 'known', 'what', 'was', 'feel', 'time', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'getting', 'scared', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Curious', 'George', 'phase']",Curious George: A Halloween Boo Fest

Miller III ""Randy Miller III""","[0, 1]","Although our family is new to Curious George (the animated version, at least), this Halloween-themed adventure was a pleasant surprise.  Our daughter is three and that seems to be a pretty good starting age for lightweight Halloween fare like this: it's just a little bit spooky, but it won't scar her for life.  The story of ""No Noggin"" is cute, the songs are reasonably catchy and the animation is crisp, smooth and colorful.Sure, parents might prefer their childhood favorites like ""Garfield's Halloween Adventure"" or ""The Great Pumpkin"", but this charming little tale is fun for kids and won't irritate parents in the process.  My daughter's watched this at least half a dozen times during the last two weeks and, as far as I'm concerned, she can keep watching it until Thanksgiving.The DVD is decent enough, serving up a strong anamorphic widescreen transfer and good audio but nothing in the way of extras.  Luckily, this is a low-priced DVD, so the light about of content (less than an hour) won't feel like a ripoff.  Whether you're new to modern-day Curious George (like I was) or have enjoyed his other animated adventures, you and your kids will probably enjoy this one!",4,"Fun for kids, tolerable for adults",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1181,"['family', 'new', 'Curious', 'George', 'animated', 'version', 'least', 'Halloween-themed', 'adventure', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'daughter', 'three', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'starting', 'age', 'lightweight', 'Halloween', 'fare', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'spooky', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scar', 'life', 'story', 'Noggin', 'cute', 'songs', 'are', 'reasonably', 'catchy', 'animation', 'crisp', 'smooth', 'colorful.Sure', 'parents', 'might', 'prefer', 'childhood', 'favorites', 'Garfield', 'Halloween', 'Adventure', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'charming', 'little', 'tale', 'fun', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'irritate', 'parents', 'process', 'daughter', 'watched', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'can', 'keep', 'watching', 'Thanksgiving.The', 'DVD', 'decent', 'enough', 'serving', 'up', 'strong', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'good', 'audio', 'nothing', 'way', 'extras', 'Luckily', 'low-priced', 'DVD', 'light', 'content', 'less', 'hour', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ripoff', ""'re"", 'new', 'modern-day', 'Curious', 'George', 'was', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'animated', 'adventures', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one']",Curious George: A Halloween Boo Fest
