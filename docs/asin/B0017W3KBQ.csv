When you look at the way things have gone down you realize that terrorism begins at home.  Our government is corrupt so no need in criticizing anyone else.  The rich have made a ton of money faking reasons for having wars.  I never believed that we didn't know exactly where Osama is.  That's why we're not looking for him.  Same reason why OJ didn't look for the real killers.  You don't look for someone when you know where they are.,5,Wow!!,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,533,"['have', 'passed', 'documentary', 'several', 'military', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'amazed', 'what', 'tape', 'When', 'look', 'way', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'realize', 'terrorism', 'home', 'government', 'corrupt', 'so', 'need', 'criticizing', 'anyone', 'else', 'rich', 'have', 'made', 'ton', 'money', 'faking', 'reasons', 'having', 'wars', 'never', 'believed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'Osama', 'why', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'Same', 'reason', 'why', 'OJ', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'killers', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'someone', 'when', 'know', 'where', 'are']",Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut
1158076,AFFOUXPFSRW94,B0017W3KBQ,"Dr. Rob ""Rob""","[2, 4]","I purchased the DVD version of this documentary. I was intrigued by the claims of the three young producers of this film. Their primary purpose was clearly that of raising questions about the tragedies of September 11, 2001.The Pentagon building explosion is the first section. The information presented in the first part is thought provoking and leads to the viewers' wondering if then Sec. Rumsfeld was truthful (he certainly was not on other matters) on the crash and expolsion.The second section detailing descrepencies of the collapse of the Twin Towers (separate events) raises the idea that explosives, placed earlier, brought the buildings down. I thought this section cohered, is unified, and more strongly researched.The section dealing with Flight 93 was weak. The weakness centers around the claim that the passengers were taken off the plane at another airport in Ohio, perhaps a NASA facility adjacent to that airport and Flight 93 sent back into the air to crash in Pennsylvania. The producers do raise the lack of a debris field for the downed jetliner. Only a mere crater is to be seen where the plane is supposed to have crashed.Despite the weakness of the third section, I do strongly recommend that persons buy and view this DVD as an alternative to the official version.",4,Reviewing Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,1291,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'version', 'documentary', 'was', 'intrigued', 'claims', 'three', 'young', 'producers', 'film', 'primary', 'purpose', 'was', 'clearly', 'raising', 'questions', 'tragedies', 'September', '11', '2001.The', 'Pentagon', 'building', 'explosion', 'first', 'section', 'information', 'presented', 'first', 'part', 'thought', 'provoking', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'then', 'Sec', 'Rumsfeld', 'was', 'truthful', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'other', 'matters', 'crash', 'expolsion.The', 'second', 'section', 'detailing', 'descrepencies', 'collapse', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'separate', 'events', 'idea', 'placed', 'earlier', 'brought', 'buildings', 'down', 'thought', 'section', 'cohered', 'unified', 'more', 'strongly', 'researched.The', 'section', 'dealing', 'Flight', '93', 'was', 'weak', 'weakness', 'centers', 'claim', 'passengers', 'were', 'taken', 'off', 'plane', 'airport', 'Ohio', 'perhaps', 'NASA', 'facility', 'adjacent', 'airport', 'Flight', '93', 'sent', 'back', 'air', 'crash', 'Pennsylvania', 'producers', 'do', 'raise', 'lack', 'debris', 'field', 'downed', 'jetliner', 'Only', 'mere', 'crater', 'be', 'seen', 'where', 'plane', 'supposed', 'have', 'crashed.Despite', 'weakness', 'third', 'section', 'do', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'persons', 'buy', 'view', 'DVD', 'alternative', 'official', 'version']",Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut

This is just one of a 'collection' of DVDs I had acquired on the events of 9/11. And all raise questions and doubts of what the American public was told about the so-called truth of those events.I have to recommend not only this title, but the numerous others available on the market that raises unanswered questions of the real truths behind that event.It's so hard to believe so much of the American public still believes what the government had stated about this, when so much of it is so easily discredited.I hope that one day, these truths will come out, and those 'really' responsible will be brought to justice. Then again, we're all still waiting for the truths about the JFK assassination, and the aliens and spacecraft being held at area 51, going back to the 1947 crash at Rosewell NM...I know this, and other similar documentaries will 'never' air on television, and not because of any rights, monentary compensation or other such issues, but because the government still controls the media, and would never allow such documentaries to air for the majority to see.It's only those select few that have purchased, rented, borrowed, or viewed over the Internet, such documentaries that holds to their beliefs that we were 'not' told the truth about what transpired, or who was really responsible for 9/11.If more people watched this, and other similar documentaries, there would be more of a demand among the public for a 'true' investigation of these events.",5,A MUST SEE FOR SURE!,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,1555,"[""'m"", 'believer', 'sure', 'events', '9/11', 'were', ""n't"", 'claimed', 'government', 'just', 'one', ""'collection"", 'DVDs', 'had', 'acquired', 'events', '9/11', 'raise', 'questions', 'doubts', 'what', 'American', 'public', 'was', 'told', 'so-called', 'truth', 'events.I', 'have', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'title', 'numerous', 'others', 'available', 'market', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'real', 'truths', 'event.It', 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'American', 'public', 'still', 'what', 'government', 'had', 'stated', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'easily', 'discredited.I', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'truths', 'will', 'come', 'out', ""'really"", 'responsible', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'justice', 'Then', 'again', ""'re"", 'still', 'waiting', 'truths', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'aliens', 'spacecraft', 'being', 'held', 'area', '51', 'going', 'back', '1947', 'crash', 'Rosewell', 'NM', 'know', 'other', 'similar', 'documentaries', 'will', ""'never"", 'air', 'television', 'not', 'rights', 'monentary', 'compensation', 'other', 'such', 'issues', 'government', 'still', 'media', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'documentaries', 'air', 'majority', 'see.It', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'have', 'purchased', 'rented', 'borrowed', 'viewed', 'Internet', 'such', 'documentaries', 'beliefs', 'were', ""'not"", 'told', 'truth', 'what', 'transpired', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'responsible', '9/11.If', 'more', 'people', 'watched', 'other', 'similar', 'documentaries', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'demand', 'public', ""'true"", 'investigation', 'events']",Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut
