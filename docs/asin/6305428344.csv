464658,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305428344,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[6, 7]","The Associates is a Whoopi Goldberg vehicle about a Black woman on Wall Street. Though she is smart and hard working, no one takes her seriously, so she invents a White male associate, Robert S. Cutty. Though no one ever sees him, he gets the reputation of being a financial genius. The more he hides, the more people want to see him, until finally, Whoopi, with the help of a drag queen, does reverse drag as a White male.The Associates is mildly entertaining, though the rapid rise of Robert S. Cutty is not really plausible. He makes one deal and the next thing you know he is on the cover of Fortune. Still, it is just an excuse for Whoopi to turn the tables and make a statement about racial prejudice and sexism. Oh, yeah, it is a comedy, not a Wall Street Journal primer on finance. The financial stuff is not very realistic, and I guess it isn't trying to be Wall Street(the Oliver Stone film), but Trading Places with Eddie Murphy was a lot more successful in showing how the world of high finance operates, and also in exploring racial prejudice with comedy. The Associates doesn't really aspire to be realistic, as it is only a flimsy premise for the whacky antics of Goldberg & Co.Bebe Neuwirth plays a smart broker who tries to use her gender to her advantage. There is a totally gratuitous scene with her modeling lingerie, which I enjoyed--but felt that it was not integral to the plot; in fact it was more like a non sequitar. Perhaps it was meant to set up a joke later on, and should be judged solely on whether or not you laughed. I did chuckle a bit here and there, and was amused.One other quibble, the whole movie was building towards a climax where Whoopi impersonates Robert S. Cutty, her imaginary White male Associate, and I think they cheated. He is not credited, but I think they just used an actual White male with Whoopi's voice dubbed in. That was kind of a let down. I remember in Little Big Man Dustin Hoffman was made to look very old with make up. As the story begins, Jack Crabb, who is about 100 years old, tells his tale of being raised by Indians and fighting at Little Big Horn. Then the story flashes back and you see it is Jack Crabb, the same person, only much younger. It was a make up tour de force, and most impressive. They may have had something similar in mind with The Associate, but then reality and budget constraints set in. I am not 100% sure it wasn't her under that latex and make up, but I am highly dubious.

464661,A364W6U6YL219D,6305428344,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[0, 0]","The Associate (1996) Whoopi Goldberg, at the time the hardest working woman in show business, pops up in what must have been her 19th movie that year. Unfortunately, it is a criminally overlong comedy that beats its one joke to death early on and has nowhere else to go. Whoopi plays an up-and-coming business financier who keeps running into a brick wall because she is a woman. Undaunted, she sets up her own business, but finds the same trouble. So, in desperation, she invents a non-existent male partner, and soon business is booming. Eventually, Whoopi has to disguise herself as this guy, an old white man, in what was supposed to be the film's big conceit. But this sequence only lasts a few minutes, and that turns out to be good, because Whoopi looks like she's wearing a particularly cheap Halloween mask for a disguise. After the rather convincing getup Robin Williams wore in Mrs. Doubtfire, this thing just looks silly. So, after the biggest set piece in the film fizzles, it somehow manages to drag out for another forty minutes (!), ending up with an astonishing two hour running time. Any goodwill I still had towards this film drained away long before the last credit rolled up the screen. Skip it.

However, all of her ideas are usurped by the man (Frank), who epitomizes the sleazy old boy's network, and who takes credit for all of her ideas and hard work.  When she is passed up for a promotion, that is the last straw, and she quits the firm to start her own.  The clerical assistant (Sally Dugan), wonderfully played by Dianne Wiest, sees the potential in this young woman and encourages her.When Laurel is unable to get anywhere as she attempts to start her own firm, the excuse always being, "" I love the proposal, but my 'associate' would not go for it.""  She is about ready to throw in the towel, when Sally steps in and gets her an appointment with the hot financier in town....Laurel realizes that being a black female is not getting her where she needs to go, so she becomes.....  an elderly white male.....  her  newfound success soon gets her on people's radar screens, read 'Frank', and like so many success stories, if you won't be co-opted by them? They will seek to destroy you! On the verge of throwing in the towel, seeing the rat she once worked with taking credit for her work, she finds her mojo, with spectacular and hilarious results.  The ultra-exclusive, white male only, club will never be the same.  Sometimes the good gals DO indeed finish first!This movie while being totally hilarious, also touches on themes of believing in yourself.  Racism.  Sexism. And how we treat others, as Laurel has to confront her own hypocrisy as how she treats her diamond in hiding secretary.I never get tired of watching this movie, and am always 100% sure that guests to my home 1)  have never seen this movie, and 2)  thoroughly enjoy it when I show it to them.",5,One of Whoopi's best flicks.

That one sentence sums up the Associate, with Whoppi Goldberg playing a woman trying to break the glass ceiling in the world of high-finance.Whoppi does a good job playing Laurel Ayers, a woman who has been passed over too many times.  When she sets out on her own, she can't get clients until she creates a partnership with a fictional male, Mr. Cutty.  While she experiences success, it is bittersweet because her fictional male partner is seen as the brains of the organization.  In the end, she goes to drastic measures to make the world see that she is the one who deserves the credit for her ideas.This movie is a lot of fun to watch.  It's true, you can watch it many times over, especially if you love the world of finance and enjoyed movies like ""Trading Places.""The movie also has a real message, which is the prejudice that prevents women from sometimes getting the credit they deserve.  It's been 10 years since this movie was made.  One would hope that the business world had changed since then, and it has in some ways.  But, some of the painful neglect she suffers in the movie still rings true.While this is a good fun movie, it is not a masterpiece of film.  It's a fun movie to watch if you don't want to think too much and if you like cliche's about the ""old-boys club.""

It reminds me of Baby Boom in that she demonstrates she can succeed without a man's help but gets into a series of sticky predicaments on the way.  I would have given this a 5 except that I felt Dianne Wiest's character was creepy rather than humorous, as she was probably intended to be.  Undoubtedly due to poor direction, as Wiest is a fine actress.  Overall, it's a great movie, and Whoopi once again shows her incredible range, as she did in Jumpin' Jack Flash, which I consider her best film.",4,Whoopi makes this movie fun,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,691,"['clever', 'twist', 'usual', 'feminist-inspired', 'movie', 'Whoopi', 'ride', 'coattails', 'imaginary', 'associate', 'rise', 'meteorically', 'top', 'own', 'organization', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'can', 'succeed', 'man', 'help', 'series', 'sticky', 'predicaments', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'felt', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'character', 'was', 'creepy', 'rather', 'humorous', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'be', 'Undoubtedly', 'due', 'poor', 'direction', 'Wiest', 'fine', 'actress', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'Whoopi', 'once', 'again', 'incredible', 'range', 'did', 'Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'consider', 'best', 'film']",N/A

This is about the glass ceiling.Whoopi works for an investment firm.  She gets the job done through hard work.  Her associate (Tim ""Wings"" Daly) gets the job done through the ""old boy's network.""  When he gets Whoopi's promotion, Whoopi quits.  She finds in the investment world, that a woman is only as good as the man behind her.Therefore, Whoopi creates a man to stand behind.  This works until one of her client's refused to close a deal until he meets the mysterious Mr. Cutty.  So with the help of her drag queen tenant, Whoopi becomes the white Mr. Cutty.  And of course, this spins even more out of control.  This film goes from social satire to complete farce.Whoopi gives a tour de force performance and Dianne Wiest plays the quintessential secretary.  Even Bebe Neuwirth has a great role as a publicist who will do anything to getthe top client.This film works on many levels.

Like a lot of women in high-powered firms, Laurel tries to break through the glass ceiling but runs into roadblocks from the Old Boys' Network. She sets about starting her own investment firm, but nobody will do business with her until she invents a male partner by the name of Robert S. Cutty. Hilarity ensues as Laurel has to make excuses to clients why the mysterious Mr. Cutty never attends meetings, never meets clients, never talks to the press.Dianne Wiest is a great sidekick as Laurel's assistant, a bright woman in her own right who has been kept down in dead-end positions. Timothy Daly is great as the sleazy, no-talent Frank who manages to take credit for Laurel's ideas and steal her promotion right out from under her. As the story progresses, you really end up hating this guy, which shows how good Daly's portrayal was. He never stoops to an extreme caricature of the Bad Guy, and it's quite satisfying he gets his comeuppance in the end.Very funny film, although I thought the scene where they try to kill off Cutty in his car was a bit silly. All in all, this is a great movie to watch over and over again, and one that still rings true even today for women trying to attain high-powered positions in what is traditionally male domain.",5,You'll Love It!,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1412,"['Whoopi', 'great', 'Laurel', 'Ayers', 'talented', 'stockbroker/investment', 'officer', 'who', 'passed', 'promotion', 'male', 'assistant', 'job', 'instead', 'lot', 'women', 'high-powered', 'firms', 'Laurel', 'break', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'roadblocks', 'Old', 'Boys', 'Network', 'starting', 'own', 'investment', 'firm', 'nobody', 'will', 'do', 'business', 'male', 'partner', 'name', 'Robert', 'S.', 'Cutty', 'Hilarity', 'Laurel', 'make', 'excuses', 'clients', 'why', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Cutty', 'never', 'meetings', 'never', 'clients', 'never', 'talks', 'press.Dianne', 'Wiest', 'great', 'sidekick', 'Laurel', 'assistant', 'bright', 'woman', 'own', 'right', 'who', 'been', 'kept', 'down', 'dead-end', 'positions', 'Timothy', 'Daly', 'great', 'sleazy', 'no-talent', 'Frank', 'who', 'take', 'credit', 'Laurel', 'ideas', 'steal', 'promotion', 'right', 'story', 'really', 'end', 'up', 'hating', 'guy', 'how', 'good', 'Daly', 'portrayal', 'was', 'never', 'extreme', 'caricature', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'comeuppance', 'end.Very', 'funny', 'film', 'thought', 'scene', 'where', 'try', 'kill', 'off', 'Cutty', 'car', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'still', 'true', 'even', 'today', 'women', 'trying', 'attain', 'high-powered', 'positions', 'what', 'traditionally', 'male', 'domain']",N/A
