This review, like all others, is based on personal taste and experience--it is very subjective.My main interest in this movie is the subject of agoraphobia (literally a fear of open spaces), which it illustrates fairly well. Some reviewers have labeled this anthrophobia, fear of people.  I dont see an distinction here. My wife suffered from this disease for many years.  When the symptoms first became evident, we had no idea what the cause was and it scared the hell out of us.  No one else seemed to know either which made it worse.  I wish that in 1968-1973 there had been a movie like this.  The disease is debilitating.  It is not, as one reviewer put it, ""a case of nerves.""  Lately some doctors have become aware of this problem and in an attempt to educate the medical professionals I can reach some doctors have been given copies of this disk.If you suffer from this condition, are responsible for the care of someone afflicted, or a loved one has this, please watch this show.  If you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it.  The point is if people understand what the disease is they can be more help to the people involved.As other reviewers ahave complained this movie will not keep you on the edge of your chair but it will open your mind.

Abigail Clayton (Selma Blair) is a recluse who lives across the hall. She wants to rent the apartment to ensure her privacy. The film sets her up as the suspect killer in this murder mystery as she knows the woman better then she lets on, has a motive, and Abigail is not her real name. She is apparently the daughter of wealth who has disappeared but is able to maintain a privileged life while in hiding. Kevin Pollak is the building bumbling concierge who is Abigail's go-fer. Beau Bridges is a friend of the family, her only contact. Giovanni Ribisi plays a detective investigating the death. He has his suspicions about Abigail, the only suspect at this point.Selma plays an excellent recluse with nervous fidgets...perhaps a bit overdone. As the film progresses the murder mystery becomes secondary as there is a far more sinister plot going on. More suspects are introduced but as the body count progresses, we run short of suspects.

Reclusive multi-millionaire heiress Abigail Clayton (Blair) has been living alone in her apartment for almost 20 years. When her neighbor dies she is upset that new tenants have moved in. When an ugly incident introduces Abigal to her new neighbors the lives of all involved begin to change. I have to say that this is normally the kind of movie that I love. A great cast where all their lives are intertwined with each other in some way. A movie that keeps you guessing at the motives of everyone and just when you think you know what's going on a twist is thrown in. This is another type of movie that to talk about it would give away something that would ruin the enjoyment of it so I will just say that this is a must see movie that you will enjoy. I really did.

1518279,A96JD9312DHWC,B006OMMTAW,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[10, 12]","An elderly tenant on the penthouse floor of Columbus Circle is found dead, seemingly a slip and fall. One detective is not certain however and decides to investigate further. While getting statements, the detective discovers the other other resident on the penthouse floor, living across the hall, is somewhat hard to get in contact with. She does not seem at home at first, but rumor has it that she has not been out of her home for 17 years. No one really knows the mystery behind  it. After the incident, she tries to get the penthouse across from her, but someone new moves in, bringing back not only memories but setting a series of events falling, like dominoes.Before reviewing the movie itself, I want to say that the previews I saw of this movie did not do it justice. They looked grainy and had bad sound quality, making me wonder if I should watch it. An obscure distributor added to that, and if it would not have been for the cast involved I might have missed a good film. This is Not reflective of the film itself.As for the movie, Columbus Circle was really good. The plot was not overly complex but was not just there to find. you needed to watch it for a bit to figure out all the pieces, and it made me want to keep up with what was going on. At first, you have a bunch of random items popping up and wonder how they all fit together. Was the woman murdered? Who is the neighbor? Why does she act the way she does? They seem connected by circumstance but the pieces start to slide in place, showing threads that hold everything together.This leads to how other elements fit in and interlock, and it makes something enjoyable. Combine that with some stuff toward the end that played out a bit different than I thought it would, marking that as a pleasant surprise.As far as acting here, it was quite good. I liked Selma Blair quite a bit, enjoying her portrayal as a shut-in with a mysterious fringe to her. There were some details that I might have attributed to the role as well that were not meant to be, from the way she carried herself to the application of make-up that seemed a little too thick. She really seemed to have an issue with the outside world, taking to the shadows and staring at the floor, reminding me of people I have met that are really uncomfortable with people intruding on their surroundings. Giovanni Ribisi was also good in the role of our curious Detective, moving the story along and keeping it on point. He also seems somewhat the same to me in movies, not in a bad way, but I kind of know what to expect from him. The neighbor portrayals, by Jason Lee and Amy Smart, were also well done, and Beau Bridges and Kevin Pollack also played characters that stood out as theirs but did not overshadow what was transpiring.If I were going to attribute a flaw, I might put it on the end. I am NOT going to spoil anything here, but want to note that a series of events in the last few minutes made me think they went against what we knew had learned throughout the film. Still, it was minor and did not take away from the film.I don't want to say a solid 5 stars, but it is not 4 either. 4.5/5 puts it somewhere between like and loving the film, saying it was worth the watch. There is a small amount of violence int he film, but mostly you are dealing with a mystery/suspense playing out.",5,Previews Do Not Reflect Quality,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,3328,"['elderly', 'tenant', 'penthouse', 'floor', 'Columbus', 'Circle', 'found', 'dead', 'seemingly', 'slip', 'fall', 'One', 'detective', 'not', 'certain', 'however', 'investigate', 'further', 'getting', 'statements', 'detective', 'discovers', 'other', 'other', 'resident', 'penthouse', 'floor', 'living', 'hall', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'get', 'contact', 'not', 'seem', 'home', 'first', 'rumor', 'not', 'been', 'home', '17', 'years', 'one', 'really', 'mystery', 'incident', 'get', 'penthouse', 'someone', 'new', 'moves', 'bringing', 'back', 'not', 'only', 'memories', 'setting', 'series', 'events', 'falling', 'dominoes.Before', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'want', 'say', 'previews', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'looked', 'grainy', 'had', 'bad', 'sound', 'quality', 'making', 'wonder', 'should', 'watch', 'obscure', 'distributor', 'added', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'involved', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'good', 'film', 'Not', 'reflective', 'film', 'itself.As', 'movie', 'Columbus', 'Circle', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'complex', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'find', 'needed', 'watch', 'bit', 'figure', 'out', 'pieces', 'made', 'want', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'first', 'have', 'bunch', 'random', 'items', 'popping', 'up', 'wonder', 'how', 'fit', 'together', 'Was', 'woman', 'murdered', 'Who', 'neighbor', 'Why', 'act', 'way', 'seem', 'connected', 'circumstance', 'pieces', 'start', 'slide', 'place', 'showing', 'threads', 'hold', 'everything', 'together.This', 'how', 'other', 'elements', 'fit', 'interlock', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'Combine', 'stuff', 'end', 'played', 'out', 'bit', 'different', 'thought', 'would', 'marking', 'pleasant', 'surprise.As', 'far', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'liked', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'quite', 'bit', 'enjoying', 'portrayal', 'shut-in', 'mysterious', 'fringe', 'were', 'details', 'might', 'have', 'attributed', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'way', 'carried', 'application', 'make-up', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'thick', 'really', 'seemed', 'have', 'issue', 'outside', 'world', 'taking', 'shadows', 'staring', 'floor', 'reminding', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'are', 'really', 'uncomfortable', 'people', 'intruding', 'surroundings', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'curious', 'Detective', 'moving', 'story', 'keeping', 'point', 'also', 'somewhat', 'same', 'movies', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'kind', 'what', 'expect', 'neighbor', 'portrayals', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'also', 'played', 'characters', 'stood', 'out', 'theirs', 'did', 'not', 'overshadow', 'what', 'was', 'transpiring.If', 'were', 'going', 'attribute', 'flaw', 'might', 'put', 'end', 'am', 'NOT', 'going', 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'want', 'note', 'series', 'events', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'made', 'think', 'went', 'what', 'knew', 'had', 'learned', 'film', 'Still', 'was', 'minor', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'not', '4', 'either', '4.5/5', 'somewhere', 'loving', 'film', 'saying', 'was', 'worth', 'watch', 'small', 'amount', 'violence', 'int', 'film', 'mostly', 'are', 'dealing', 'mystery/suspense', 'playing', 'out']",Columbus Circle
