1494287,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B005M2A4CA,Kasey G,"[14, 16]","Ahh the Bradys--so great at the Potato Sack Race, Charleston contents, painstakingly constructing a house of cards. But one thing's for sure--they can't bowl worth a hill of beans and this DVD proves it. Barry Williams comes off best and even the female commentator--herself a professional bowler--praises him a few times. But maybe that was just in hopes he'd take her back to that groovy attic bachelor pad for some ""private lessons"".Seriously though, if you are a fanatic about watching really bad bowlers from the '70s do their thing for 45 minutes, then this DVD is for you. Otherwise, even the most rabid Brady fan will be bored.The disc contains two separate shows: the first one features Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick vs. Chris Knight and Eve Plumb. The second show it's Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen vs. Eric Scott and Mary McDonough from ""The Waltons"". The picture quality isn't the best but it's very watchable. C'mon though--did they really think there was going to be a market for these 40 years down the road? I give 'em a pass on quality. (NOTE--see the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product).Two stars: One because they're the Bradys and the kids make some respectful comments about Robert Reed and Florence Henderson; and two, because it is slightly amusing to hear host Jed Allan constantly screwing up their names as the confused kids are never sure who he's talking to or which lane they're to play. The prizes include some of the ugliest men's pants you've ever seen, an archaic telephone answering machine and of course, the ubiquitous case of Turtle Wax. Perhaps the kids would have practised or tried harder if their precious books of trading stamps were at stake.",2,About As Exciting as Watching Paint Dry,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1719,"['Bradys', 'so', 'great', 'Potato', 'Sack', 'Race', 'Charleston', 'contents', 'painstakingly', 'constructing', 'house', 'cards', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bowl', 'hill', 'beans', 'DVD', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'off', 'best', 'even', 'female', 'commentator', 'professional', 'bowler', 'few', 'times', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'hopes', ""'d"", 'take', 'back', 'groovy', 'attic', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'private', 'lessons', '.Seriously', 'are', 'fanatic', 'watching', 'really', 'bad', 'bowlers', ""'70s"", 'do', 'thing', '45', 'minutes', 'then', 'DVD', 'Otherwise', 'even', 'most', 'rabid', 'Brady', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'bored.The', 'disc', 'contains', 'two', 'separate', 'shows', 'first', 'one', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'vs.', 'Chris', 'Knight', 'Eve', 'Plumb', 'second', 'show', 'Mike', 'Lookinland', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'vs.', 'Eric', 'Scott', 'Mary', 'McDonough', 'Waltons', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'best', 'very', 'watchable', ""C'mon"", 'did', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'market', '40', 'years', 'road', 'give', 'pass', 'quality', 'NOTE', 'see', 'screen', 'grabs', 'posted', 'Images', 'section', 'product', 'stars', 'One', ""'re"", 'Bradys', 'kids', 'make', 'respectful', 'comments', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'two', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'hear', 'host', 'Jed', 'Allan', 'constantly', 'screwing', 'up', 'names', 'confused', 'kids', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'who', 'talking', 'lane', ""'re"", 'play', 'prizes', 'include', 'ugliest', 'men', 'pants', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'archaic', 'telephone', 'answering', 'machine', 'course', 'ubiquitous', 'case', 'Turtle', 'Wax', 'Perhaps', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'practised', 'tried', 'harder', 'precious', 'books', 'trading', 'stamps', 'were', 'stake']",The Bradys Go Bowling
