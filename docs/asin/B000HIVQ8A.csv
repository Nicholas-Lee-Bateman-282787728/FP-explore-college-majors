1014987,AELL37SY6YIYO,B000HIVQ8A,Amazon Customer,"[20, 23]","If you enjoy Amy Grant in concert, then I highly recommend this DVD.  Recorded from two live shows, Amy performs many of her hits and fan favorites at the Bass Hall in Fortworth, TX where she held her first concert 25+ years ago.  The musical instrumentation and vocals are so tight at this concert that I would sometimes forget I was listening to live music.  I highly recommend this DVD.

It *almost*, as Cathy E said, resembles a hard rock concert, except that, in this case, it even lacks the visual rhythm that most hard rock concerts would have. Digital zooms and pans are used, apparently just because someone was enjoying the new editing toy.The sound is nowhere near what DVD is capable of either. And, as compared to the times I've heard Amy live, this performance borders on lifeless. Unless you're a diehard Amy completist, I really think you should try to find a rental to look at before you decide if you want to buy.",3,sub-par,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,666,"['Cathy', 'E', 'only', 'reviewer', 'here', 'who', 'looked', 'objectively', 'editing', 'total', 'disaster', '*almost*', 'Cathy', 'E', 'said', 'hard', 'rock', 'concert', 'case', 'even', 'visual', 'rhythm', 'most', 'hard', 'rock', 'concerts', 'would', 'have', 'Digital', 'zooms', 'pans', 'are', 'used', 'apparently', 'just', 'someone', 'was', 'enjoying', 'new', 'editing', 'toy.The', 'sound', 'nowhere', 'what', 'DVD', 'capable', 'compared', 'times', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Amy', 'live', 'performance', 'borders', 'lifeless', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'Amy', 'completist', 'really', 'think', 'should', 'try', 'find', 'rental', 'look', 'decide', 'want', 'buy']",N/A
1014989,A3RA09USCPG73Z,B000HIVQ8A,David Chiang,"[0, 0]",Amy Grant had two live CDs (reissued as CDs) or LPs in the 70s or rather 1 album but in 2 volumes.  She sounded good live in that CD especially the accoustic moments with her and just her guitar.  The accoustic set on this new live CD does not sound as sincere and as intimate as it did back in the 70s.  Perhaps it was a different era and she was just starting out. Nevertheless it is still good to hear her sing live after all these years.  Her pitching is good live as well as on CD for a female voice.  I was disappointed with her choice of songs for this live set.  The only song I truly enjoy was Simple Things.  But overall not a bad live CD.,4,Good to hear Amy Grant live again after all these years,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,649,"['Amy', 'Grant', 'had', 'two', 'live', 'CDs', 'reissued', 'CDs', 'LPs', '70s', 'rather', '1', 'album', '2', 'volumes', 'sounded', 'good', 'live', 'CD', 'especially', 'accoustic', 'moments', 'just', 'guitar', 'accoustic', 'set', 'new', 'live', 'CD', 'not', 'sound', 'sincere', 'as', 'intimate', 'did', 'back', '70s', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'different', 'era', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'good', 'hear', 'sing', 'live', 'years', 'pitching', 'good', 'live', 'as', 'well', 'CD', 'female', 'voice', 'was', 'disappointed', 'choice', 'songs', 'live', 'set', 'only', 'song', 'truly', 'was', 'Simple', 'Things', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'live', 'CD']",N/A

This DVD is of high quality - especially when you listen to it in 5.1 surround.  As some have said - the editing is a bit much at times as the camera angles jump around too much in some songs.  But - still a worthy addition to any Amy Grant fan's collection.  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is for the video editing.  Everything else from the sound, the concert and song selection is first rate.",4,Stroll down memory lane...,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,484,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'started', 'out', 'teenager', 'DVD', 'high', 'quality', 'especially', 'when', 'listen', '5.1', 'surround', 'have', 'said', 'editing', 'bit', 'much', 'times', 'camera', 'jump', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'songs', 'still', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'fan', 'collection', 'only', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'video', 'editing', 'Everything', 'else', 'sound', 'concert', 'song', 'selection', 'first', 'rate']",N/A
1014991,A2OCXCD2GALADH,B000HIVQ8A,Michael Dalton,"[8, 9]","I have no stones to throw at Amy Grant or those who show what seems like prejudice towards her music.  I've witnessed other Christians turning against her because of her choices.  I have no desire to find fault with them.  I recognize that there is a place for judging the behavior of fellow believers.  But as one Christian leader said, too often we criticize in a way that leaves no room for response or discussion.  Sadly, it seems that too many people (Christians included) have become better at tearing people down rather than building them up.Who am I to judge the servant of another?  My sins and their consequences may be different from Amy Grant's, but am I any less guilty?  Aside from the grace of God in Christ Jesus, I deserve to be forever separated from the presence of God.  I'm in no position to wrongly judge Grant or her critics.Despite any mistakes that Grant may have made in her personal life, there is one thing that I do know about her.  She has never ceased to grow and develop as an artist, and this new release is no exception.  It does not disappoint.Since we don't have a definitive bio of Amy in print--it's a story I would like to read--Time Again serves as the next best thing--a musical bio of a long career.  Most of her biggest and best-loved songs are performed live in front of an enthusiastic audience at Bass Hall in Ft. Worth, Texas.  Ft. Worth was the site of her first ticketed performance 28 years ago.If you have ever seen a PBS Soundstage concert, you know that the sound, lighting and performance are first-rate.  This production and Grant's performance are as good or better than the best in that series.  This is one of the best music DVDs of the year.Grant is relaxed and jokes with the audience in the occasional song introduction.  But in addition to a great overall performance, she deserves credit for assembling an outstanding supporting band.  They are terrific, and almost all of them join in at times on background vocals.  Some songs get slightly new arrangements, and except for a short, quiet acoustic portion in the middle of the set, most of the songs have a rock edge, which puts muscle into mostly pop songs.These live versions sound surprisingly fresh and in most cases, if not all, surpass the original studio recordings.  I never expected to care so much about several songs from Heart in Motion.  They have never sounded so good.  Even though I've heard ""Baby Baby"" many times on the radio, I enjoyed it more than ever.  Grant succeeds big-time in breathing new life and creative energy into her classics.With any collection of past hits, choices have to be made and there's not always room for everything.  There are no songs from Unguarded and her two recent hymns recordings.  It may be that they just didn't fit the mood, which is generally upbeat and celebratory.  She does slow the pace with a mostly solo acoustic set of ""In A Little While,"" which has a new arrangement, ""Thy Word,"" ""My Father's Eyes,"" and ""El Shaddai.""  She performs each of these on her living room couch, which is located in the center of the stage on a large rug.  A scenic painting fills the background area behind it. Seated and playing her guitar with the painting in the background is a nice touch.This is a must for any Amy Grant fan.  It's the definitive Amy Grant video.  Lots of bonus material is included.  It appears that no expense was spared in making this the best it could be.A CD of the performance can be purchased separately.  The track list differs slightly from the DVD.  In addition to the live version, a new studio version of ""In A Little While"" is included on the CD.  There's also a live version of ""Believe,"" the theme song from the Three Wishes TV show that Grant hosted.  This song is not on the DVD.The CD also includes a bonus DVD consisting of four of the songs from the full-length DVD.  If you have to choose between the two, the DVD captures the best performances and includes a few songs not found on the CD, but both the DVD and CD are excellent.",5,One of the best music DVDs of the year,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,4027,"['have', 'stones', 'throw', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'who', 'show', 'what', 'like', 'prejudice', 'music', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'other', 'Christians', 'turning', 'because', 'choices', 'have', 'desire', 'find', 'fault', 'recognize', 'place', 'judging', 'behavior', 'fellow', 'believers', 'one', 'Christian', 'leader', 'said', 'too', 'often', 'criticize', 'way', 'room', 'response', 'discussion', 'Sadly', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'Christians', 'included', 'have', 'become', 'better', 'tearing', 'people', 'down', 'rather', 'building', 'up.Who', 'am', 'judge', 'servant', 'sins', 'consequences', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'am', 'less', 'guilty', 'Aside', 'grace', 'God', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'deserve', 'be', 'forever', 'separated', 'presence', 'God', ""'m"", 'position', 'wrongly', 'judge', 'Grant', 'critics.Despite', 'mistakes', 'Grant', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'personal', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'know', 'never', 'ceased', 'grow', 'develop', 'artist', 'new', 'release', 'exception', 'not', 'disappoint.Since', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'definitive', 'bio', 'Amy', 'print', 'story', 'would', 'like', 'read', 'Time', 'Again', 'serves', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'musical', 'bio', 'long', 'career', 'Most', 'biggest', 'best-loved', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'live', 'front', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'Bass', 'Hall', 'Ft.', 'Worth', 'Texas', 'Ft.', 'Worth', 'was', 'site', 'first', 'ticketed', 'performance', '28', 'years', 'ago.If', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'PBS', 'Soundstage', 'concert', 'know', 'sound', 'lighting', 'performance', 'are', 'first-rate', 'production', 'Grant', 'performance', 'are', 'good', 'better', 'best', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'music', 'DVDs', 'year.Grant', 'relaxed', 'jokes', 'audience', 'occasional', 'song', 'introduction', 'addition', 'great', 'overall', 'performance', 'credit', 'assembling', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'band', 'are', 'terrific', 'almost', 'join', 'times', 'background', 'vocals', 'songs', 'get', 'slightly', 'new', 'arrangements', 'short', 'quiet', 'acoustic', 'portion', 'middle', 'set', 'most', 'songs', 'have', 'rock', 'edge', 'muscle', 'mostly', 'pop', 'songs.These', 'live', 'versions', 'sound', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'most', 'cases', 'not', 'surpass', 'original', 'studio', 'recordings', 'never', 'expected', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'several', 'songs', 'Heart', 'Motion', 'have', 'never', 'sounded', 'so', 'good', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Baby', 'Baby', 'many', 'times', 'radio', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'ever', 'Grant', 'big-time', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'creative', 'energy', 'classics.With', 'collection', 'past', 'hits', 'choices', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'not', 'always', 'room', 'everything', 'are', 'songs', 'Unguarded', 'two', 'recent', 'hymns', 'recordings', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mood', 'generally', 'upbeat', 'celebratory', 'slow', 'pace', 'mostly', 'solo', 'acoustic', 'set', 'Little', 'new', 'arrangement', 'Thy', 'Word', 'Father', 'Eyes', 'El', 'Shaddai', 'living', 'room', 'couch', 'located', 'center', 'stage', 'large', 'rug', 'scenic', 'painting', 'background', 'area', 'Seated', 'playing', 'guitar', 'painting', 'background', 'nice', 'touch.This', 'must', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'fan', 'definitive', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'video', 'Lots', 'bonus', 'material', 'included', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'making', 'best', 'could', 'be.A', 'CD', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'separately', 'track', 'list', 'differs', 'slightly', 'DVD', 'addition', 'live', 'version', 'new', 'studio', 'version', 'Little', 'included', 'CD', 'also', 'live', 'version', 'Believe', 'theme', 'song', 'Three', 'Wishes', 'TV', 'show', 'Grant', 'hosted', 'song', 'not', 'DVD.The', 'CD', 'also', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'consisting', 'four', 'songs', 'full-length', 'DVD', 'have', 'choose', 'two', 'DVD', 'best', 'performances', 'few', 'songs', 'not', 'found', 'CD', 'DVD', 'CD', 'are', 'excellent']",N/A
