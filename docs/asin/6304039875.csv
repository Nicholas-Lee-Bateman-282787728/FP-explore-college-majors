When seeing this on DVD, I snatched it up.  It still holds the warm, friendly feeling in me as it did when I was a little girl.

397808,A39U50ZJPWZ9P3,6304039875,Darrell,"[2, 2]","By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.comTolstoy's own daughter introduces this wonderful, enchanting, animated Christmas Motion Picture. Other 5 star reviewers masterfully tell the story better than I; so I'll just add what Tolstoy himself thought of the story: Many people do not understand the introduction and words of Tolstoy's daughter because of her accent. Her words and the introduction are so important that I will quote the words here, ""When father was asked if 'War and Peace' was his greatest work, he said, 'NO, MY GREATEST WORK WAS 'WHAT AND IF I' AND 'MARTIN THE COBBLER'.""One of the most loved novelists in the history of the world believed this simple short story was his best work! Nothing could better dramatize the words of Jesus, ""Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.""If Tolstoy were alive and could see Will Vinton's magical, claymation version of the story of 'Martin the Cobbler' (with music you will never forget), I believe he would give the film 5 Stars!See all of my Reviews.

397810,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6304039875,microjoe,"[2, 2]","Based on the story by Leo Tolstoy, ""Where Love Is"", this is the story of Martin, a old shoe cobbler in a rural Russian village who is bitter with the world from the loss of his wife. As he tells a priest, me and God do not get along anymore. The priest is asking Martin to make a new cover for a very important holy book, and while Martin does not feel worthy of the job due to his lack of faith, the priest gently prods him to read some of the book and give the job a try. Martin dreams that night about an important message from the Lord, and sees his hand at work the next day. It changes his life as well as others he comes in contact with in a very inspiring way. This is a 27 minute claymation film from 1977, made by Will Vinton. The music, animation, character design, voice acting and script were all well done. A nice surprise was the intro and narration from Tolstoy's own daughter. I have enjoyed other films by Vinton in this series of DVD's, especially the First Christmas DVD that has 3 stories on it.

Martin is a lonely shoe maker who has completely shut out the world around him after the loss of his family. One day a priest asks Martin to repair a Bible for him. Martin does not believe he is worthy but agrees to do the job. When he goes to bed that evening, he has a dream that the Lord will visit him. The next day Martin has some visitors: a poor man who is shoveling snow, a poor woman with her child, and an old woman and young boy fighting with each other. In each situation, Martin is able to help the visitors.
