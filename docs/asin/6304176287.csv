There is most definitely a dark side to the Chocolate Factory, and Wonka doesn't exactly go to great lengths to conceal that from his bratty &quot;guests.&quot;Though it wasn't as much a part of Dahl's book, the TV coverage of the race to find the Golden Tickets is hilarious, too --it kind of foreshadows the obsessive side to which that medium has now reached with 24/7 news channels and reality programming.I think the most powerful moment in the movie, though, comes when Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe from the factory, with their prize null and void. Grandpa Joe is boiling with rage and is ready to take the Gobstopper to Slugworth right then and there, but Charlie stands by his promise and returns the Gobstopper. This whole Slugworth subplot wasn't really part of Dahl's book either, but it suddenly opens up the scope of the story and makes us see just what kind of generous soul Wonka really is.

While Dahl reportedly was unsatisfied with this rendering of his story, audiences agreed with Stuart and have propelled this to one of the all-time greats, a film that is remembered, quoted and beloved by many generations.  With a star performance by Gene Wilder (talk about an iconic role) and some of the most inspired production design of its time (or any, really), &#8216;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&#8217; is one for the ages.We all know the story, so I&#8217;m not going to rehash all that.If you haven&#8217;t seen this film, then waste no more time and snatch it up now (it&#8217;s a steal) and if you have seen it then you know why so many love it.

405330,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,6304176287,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 5]","This movie is certainly a classic by today's standards, delivering us a world of color and candy. Kids are going to naturally love this film, with the fun musical numbers and funny little orange men called Oompa Loompas. Adults will appreciate Wonka's whacked out world, remembering the days when giant gummy bears and a chocolate river would be truly impressing to see.The movie centers around a boy named Charlie, who desperately wants to find one of Willy Wonka's five Golden Tickets so he can get inside the chocolate factory and absorb a bit of magic, laughter, and fun to get away from a world where he's living in poverty with his mother, his two grandfathers and two grandmothers. Of course Charlie does get the Golden Ticket and is whisked away to this magical factory where he takes a tour with four brats and their parents. The remainder of the film is a whirlwind of lickable wallpaper, giant candy bars, golden eggs, and scolding songs sung by the Oompa Loompas.While this is a good movie, it fails to dig into somewhat cynical side of the book written by Roald Dahl. The musical numbers make this movie sappy, campy, and a number of other words similar to those. The book will take you on a true journey, but the movie sputters along delivering the same message throughout the factory-- every kid is a spoiled, selfish brat-- except for Charlie.While many believe the 1971 version to be absolutely perfect, we'll see how well this version of the film stands up against the one to be released in the summer of 2005. Tim Burton (who will direct) promises to follow the book more closely, and he's already signed on the person to play Wonka-- Johnny Depp. Hopefully this pairing will bring something spectacular to the table and create a truly memorable version of this magnificent book.However, this movie, despite the fact that it's unlike the book, is still a movie you should you see, one that you will surely enjoy. While Wilder isn't exactly the way fans of the book pictured him, he certainly delivers as Wonka and brings life to the charactere.

Violet Beauregarde at one point does indeed have her finger up her nose during the boat journey down the chocolate river tunnel.Despite the dated styles in acting, clothes, and music, this musical's appeal has stood up very well (but, hey, look at the 1939 Wizard of Oz for *dated*!).After a recent reading of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, David Seltzer's rework of Dahl's source comes across as not so much an adaptation as an alternate version of the same story. It's tighter and has better dramatic flow than the book.The musical numbers by Bricusse, Newly and Scharf are engaging, not too frequent or cloying, and don't stall the plot. Not Arlen and Harberg, perhaps, but somewhat of a cut above the predominantly wretched pop music of the early 1970s.In an unacknowledged but probably necessary dramatic hiccup, Grandpa Joe sings the important song ""I've got a Golden Ticket"", which by rights should be rendered by Charlie. But as Peter Ostrum admittedly could not hold a tune (a serious casting flaw), Jack Albertson rises to the occasion and rasps it out just fine.I thinks it's very funny that ""Wonka"" was originally pitched to Quaker Oats by the movie's producers as a candy-bar-promotion gimmick to be shot on a shoestring budget. The irony is that the movie is so good but that the currently Nestle-produced Wonka-brand candy is so bad. But the movie rises above its base commercial roots and stands nicely on its own.Buy it & see it, while you wait for the remake...HOWEVER....It is most unfortunate that the only girl role models are such horrid brats!With the book, my 4 year old daughter kept asking about and referring back to Veruca Salt and Violet Beauregarde. But can one say anything positive about those ill-fated characters? At this critical time in her development, when she's looking to women and girls (real and in literature) as role models, the only girls in sight are punished and humiliated for their aggressiveness.I don't begrudge Charlie and his spiritual journey with Grandpa Joe, or his final reward. But there's little in the book or movie of redeeming value for young girls.The underlying message of the movie and the book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show. Mothers are either shrill, hysterical harpies or passive, feckless shadows.",4,"A Classic perhaps, but take care with young girls...",1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2484,"['*widescreen*', 'version', 'scrumptious', 'edition', 'editing', 'flaws', 'apparent', 'cropped/fullscreen', 'DVD', 'one', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'one', 'point', 'indeed', 'have', 'finger', 'up', 'nose', 'boat', 'journey', 'chocolate', 'river', 'tunnel.Despite', 'dated', 'styles', 'acting', 'clothes', 'music', 'musical', 'appeal', 'stood', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'hey', 'look', '1939', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '*dated*', '.After', 'recent', 'reading', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'rework', 'Dahl', 'source', 'across', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'adaptation', 'alternate', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'tighter', 'better', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'book.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Bricusse', 'Newly', 'Scharf', 'are', 'engaging', 'not', 'too', 'frequent', 'cloying', 'do', ""n't"", 'stall', 'plot', 'Not', 'Arlen', 'Harberg', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'cut', 'predominantly', 'wretched', 'pop', 'music', 'early', '1970s.In', 'unacknowledged', 'probably', 'necessary', 'dramatic', 'hiccup', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'important', 'song', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'rights', 'should', 'be', 'rendered', 'Charlie', 'Peter', 'Ostrum', 'admittedly', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'tune', 'serious', 'casting', 'flaw', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'occasion', 'rasps', 'out', 'just', 'fine.I', 'very', 'funny', 'Wonka', 'was', 'originally', 'pitched', 'Quaker', 'Oats', 'movie', 'producers', 'candy-bar-promotion', 'gimmick', 'be', 'shot', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'irony', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'currently', 'Nestle-produced', 'Wonka-brand', 'candy', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'base', 'commercial', 'roots', 'nicely', 'own.Buy', 'see', 'wait', 'remake', 'HOWEVER', '.It', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'girl', 'role', 'models', 'are', 'such', 'horrid', 'brats', 'book', '4', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'kept', 'asking', 'about', 'referring', 'back', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'anything', 'positive', 'ill-fated', 'characters', 'critical', 'time', 'development', 'when', 'looking', 'women', 'girls', 'real', 'literature', 'role', 'models', 'only', 'girls', 'sight', 'are', 'punished', 'humiliated', 'aggressiveness.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'Charlie', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'final', 'reward', 'little', 'book', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'value', 'young', 'girls.The', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie', 'book', 'girls', 'have', 'part', 'larger', 'adventures', 'rewards', 'men', 'boys', 'male', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'run', 'show', 'Mothers', 'are', 'shrill', 'hysterical', 'harpies', 'passive', 'feckless', 'shadows']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

I hadn't seen the film for quite a while, and have to admit I was rather disappointed with the acting, sets and effects, which may have been astonishing in 1971 but which can no longer dazzle people who have seen Star Wars and The Matrix. To be honest, this film does not have much to offer unless you want to relive your fond memories of it. HOWEVER, I've given the film four stars, and base the bump up on the wonderful dvd extras, which include a commentary track with all five of the adults who played the Wonka kids -- this track is really fun to listen to.

So it's nice that Warner Brothers decided to compliment an exceptional Wizard DVD with the re-release of Willy Wonka on it's own well made disc. For awhile there was only the standard and rather lame anniversary release of Willy Wonka on DVD and because of a ""limited"" release it became hard to find and expensive! So finally the brains at WB came to their collective senses to put out a new and much improved edition. The transfer and sound alone are a vast improvement over the original yet it still retains its 1971 ambiance by not over-digitizing unnecessary effects: ala Star Wars. Getting the wide screen version you discover what terrific photography a wide screen lens (if used properly) can do for children's cinema. Instead of getting obnoxious close ups we can get a full view of the terrific art direction which in this case is, well....pure imagination! The extras are simply great. A solid reunion documentary highlights the disc along with other goodies including the original featurette, sing along songs, original trailer and Wonka kids commentary. The doc. is a bit on the sappy side but it does shed some good light as to why, and how the movie was made. If any thing it's a trip to gander at the whole Wonka kid cast grown and hear them reminisce about filming. Although a person can't complain about the edition disc except that it is done too much for kids. Understandable but this ""children's"" film more than any other seemed to have a slight twist to the realm of adult. Especially given it's overt psychedelic moments and presumed dark demise of spoiled kids. Also it generally had ironic moments that played against it's own cutesy childish genre like Charlie Bucket (in the hurried and chaotic boat ride scene) suggesting that the film would make a great TV show. No where is this more evident than with Gene Wilder's on and off the brink performance as Willy Wonka. Arguably his best ever. His inspiring line ""So shines a good deed in a weary world."" can still make the cruelest most jaded heart in the toughest cell block feel like choking up.

Someone who was lucky enough to explore the most amazing, magical, chocolatey-flavored, tastiest, and craziest factory in the whole wide world, haha.Even to this day, when Halloween and Easter come around, I get chills down my spine when I see all these amazing, distinct and colorful candy varities sitting in a bowl looking so tasty and delicious, waiting for someone to come along and eat them.  Since this movie came out so many years ago, imagine how many NEW kinds of sweet candies have been created and released?You see, even though we eventually grow up into adulthood, that does not (and should not) EVER stop us from wanting to live the biggest dream of all- that being given the chance to fully explore Willy Wonka and his Chocolate Factory.

I had many different phases in my life, and the one phase that continues to come back is getting the chance to swim down that river and drink my way to safety after several hours of fun.Imagine a world where everything is covered in chocolate or candy, such as what Willy Wonka's factory included, and that's where I would like to live every single day for the rest of my life.

I was struck by the similarities between the two: The outlook of the factories, the layout of Charlie's home, the appearance of the children other than Charlie who got a golden ticket to visit the factory etc. Sure, we have a much different oompa loompa and much much different Willy Wonka. The songs are differernt too.Without a doubt, the special effects of Tim's film, shot some 30 years later, and aided by the latest technology are somewhat better. It would be easier nowadays to have squirrels without bothering about finding any subsititutes like the geese. Yes, the comical depictions of the 4 children may be more appealing to the younger audience who are well accustomed to cartoons. But to the more seasoned audience, the depictions here are more classical and Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is magical: so much wit, so much warmth and charm that makes things so real...PS: It is also difficult to understand why Tim chose such an old and uninteresting man with such a dull face as THE oompa loompa. What is more, all oompa loompas were literally duplicates of him.  Such a boredom. I prefer the oompa loompas here and I enjoy their songs so much better.

I've read the book by Roald Dahl on which this movie is based, and I have to admit that this is one of the rare occasions in which the movie is actually better than the book.  The movie is far more vivid than what my own imagination is capable of conjuring.This movie is the story of Charlie Bucket, a young well-intentioned boy who comes from a loving but destitute household.  He is one of five children who finds a Golden Ticket inside the wrapper of a Wonka Bar and earns a trip to Willa Wonka's chocolate factory.  The other four children include a glutton, a spoiled brat, a lazy boy who does nothing but watch TV all day, and a girl who incessantly chews gum.  These children and their relatives are taken inside the factory where they are singled out one at a time for their flaws and eliminated from the tour.The real star of the movie is Willa Wonka, who is engeniously played by Gene Wilder.  I don't know if he was ever nominated for an Academy Award for this performance, but he sure deserved to be.  His character is both psychotic and brilliant at the same time.  I've seen this movie many times, but I never tire of Wilder's acting ability.Overall, the plot is not as important as the way in which it is presented.  The viewer will be taken to a wonderous place with chocolate waterfalls and edible flowers and cute Oompa Loompas.  Your senses will be overloaded with colorful things to see and catchy songs to hear.  I don't know what Heaven is like, but I doubt it's much better than Willa Wonka's chocolate factory.

405352,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6304176287,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 1]","Starting with the nice things about this movie, it is a nice story of hope. Charlie is a nice boy (10-12) who has the burden of working after school to bring in some money so to assist his mostly bed ridden family. He loves his mother and both sets of grandparents. But he seems to have a special attachment to his grandfather Joe. Soon afterwards, Charlie and others learn of the Wonka contest where 5 lucky winners will receive a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of the Wonka factory. Naturally, people start buying as many Wonka bars as they can, but seeing that Charlie's family is poor, he is limited to just one now and then. One nice scene is that Charlie is so happy to receive just a scarf and a bar of chocolate for his birthday. (We could probably all learn from this.)Gradually 4 of the 5 tickets are found, and beating the odds, Charlie finds the last. The scene where he inspires his bed ridden grandfather to get out of bed is especially beautiful. The 5 winners meet at the Wonka factory. Gene Wilder wanted his character to be somewhat ambiguous. (Is he truthful or not?) And here is when the sinister elements of the movie kick in. During the tour of the factory, the 4 other winners (Augustus), (Violet), (Veruca), and (Mike) disappear into traps. We don't even see them come out on screen. Even if we argue that Wonka somehow knows they will be alright, he seems to take delight in their disappearance.Even Charlie has a near mishap, and if Wonka had been a bit more altruistic, he may have gone back to the room, and told Charlie and oe how to avoid getting hurt. (Of course Charlie and Joe find a safe way out, but it does make us wonder a bit.)Possibly, the darkest side of Wonka is when he tests Charlie by pretending to deny Charlie the lifetime supply of promised chocolate. He apologizes to be sure, but it does seem that Wonka enjoys playing God. (Though Wilder does bring a gentle side to Wonka as well.)Against the odds, I'm going to give this movie 3 stars for its redeeming elements, and suggest that parents reading this screen it before they give it to children.",3,Elements Both Redeeming and Sinister,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2103,"['Starting', 'nice', 'things', 'movie', 'nice', 'story', 'hope', 'Charlie', 'nice', 'boy', '10-12', 'who', 'burden', 'working', 'school', 'bring', 'money', 'so', 'assist', 'mostly', 'bed', 'ridden', 'family', 'mother', 'sets', 'grandparents', 'have', 'special', 'attachment', 'grandfather', 'Joe', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'Charlie', 'others', 'learn', 'Wonka', 'contest', 'where', '5', 'lucky', 'winners', 'will', 'receive', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'chocolate', 'tour', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'Naturally', 'people', 'start', 'buying', 'many', 'Wonka', 'bars', 'can', 'seeing', 'Charlie', 'family', 'poor', 'limited', 'just', 'one', 'now', 'then', 'One', 'nice', 'scene', 'Charlie', 'so', 'happy', 'receive', 'just', 'scarf', 'bar', 'chocolate', 'birthday', 'could', 'probably', 'learn', 'Gradually', '4', '5', 'tickets', 'are', 'found', 'beating', 'odds', 'Charlie', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'bed', 'grandfather', 'get', 'bed', 'especially', 'beautiful', '5', 'winners', 'meet', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'wanted', 'character', 'be', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', 'truthful', 'not', 'here', 'when', 'sinister', 'elements', 'movie', 'kick', 'tour', 'factory', '4', 'other', 'winners', 'Augustus', 'Violet', 'Veruca', 'Mike', 'disappear', 'traps', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'screen', 'Even', 'argue', 'Wonka', 'somehow', 'will', 'be', 'alright', 'take', 'delight', 'disappearance.Even', 'Charlie', 'near', 'mishap', 'Wonka', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'altruistic', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'room', 'told', 'Charlie', 'oe', 'how', 'avoid', 'getting', 'hurt', 'course', 'Charlie', 'Joe', 'find', 'safe', 'way', 'make', 'wonder', 'bit', 'Possibly', 'darkest', 'side', 'Wonka', 'when', 'Charlie', 'pretending', 'deny', 'Charlie', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'promised', 'chocolate', 'be', 'sure', 'seem', 'Wonka', 'playing', 'God', 'Wilder', 'bring', 'gentle', 'side', 'Wonka', 'as', 'well', 'odds', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'redeeming', 'elements', 'suggest', 'parents', 'reading', 'screen', 'give', 'children']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.Oh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn't despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?I'll have to check it out.

The movie cost 3 million to make and was, in the end, able to squeak out only 4 million domestic. Not bad, but not great. In fact it could have easily been forgotten had it not been for the popular book, written by Roald Dahl, and a rabid fan base.""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", based on the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is the story of a famous but eccentric candy maker, Willy Wonka. Wonka works in obscurity, no one has ever seen inside his factory, in fact, no one has ever really seen Wonka. The movie starts with Wonka announcing that he will open up his factory, but only to 5 lucky people...the ones who find 5 golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars. In the end 5 children find the tickets, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the annoying Violet Beauregard, the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the obsessed Mike Teavee, and the salt of the earth Charlie Bucket. The second half of the film is a tour through the mad but fascinating chocolate factory where Wonka's guests quickly start to disappear one by one.The extras on this set are illuminating a 20-minute or so documentary explores Gene Wilder's (Willy Wonka) motivation and offers up fascinating facts like Quaker Oats being the major funding for this movie. In fact Quaker Oats was hoping to market Wonka Bars in tandem with the movies release but the bars could not maintain their shape on store shelves and quickly melted into obscurity. The commentary is one of those ""You Must Listen To"" features if you're a fan of the film. All the children, now in their 40's, share memories and swap stories from thirty years ago on set. We learn what that chocolate river was really made of, who had crushes on who, and that, at times, all the kids really thought Gene Wilder was insane.Today the movie is still quite dark, but with its quirky and fun soundtrack, it's almost innocent looking sets, and strong moral message few would argue that this movie is not appropriate for even the youngest of children. I would say four and up should appreciate it, though the boat scene still freaks me out.

405367,A2P1C75HUR3P3X,6304176287,Catherine G. Hamilton,"[3, 4]","I grew up watching ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", dazzled by the wondrous characters, brilliant songs and Roald Dahl's unbeatable tale. But looking back on it now I am able to discern more about it than its pure enjoyment. As an adult, I see that the film is probably one of the most moving and moral stories that you could show to your children.I am consistently moved throughout by Charlie's story, one of humility, modesty, innocence and above all, hope. Comparing him to the other ghastly kids makes his qualities all the more apparent. The way that the film emphasizes the desirability of winning a ""Golden Ticket"" appeals to the child in all of us, most poignantly, I think, portrayed by the fact that Grandpa Joe finds meaning in life when restored by youth and excitement. In this film, winning a Golden Ticket becomes a matter of such urgency that it is pure Roald Dahl legacy, remembering his devotion to seeing life through the eyes of a child. This is brought out especially by the song lyrics - pure joy.Seeing the latest Johnny Depp version made me appreciate just what it was about the original that shines. The ""Slugworth"" storyline and the wonderful performance of Gene Wilder will always elevate it above the newer attempt because of its stronger sense of morality. Charlie, untainted by greed or selfishness due to his ""simple"" lifestyle, is a lesson to all of us, and receives the gifts of happiness and abundance he deserves.This movie may come over as amateurish (indeed, it shows its age in this respect) but it is one of the last tributes to a time when films focused inward rather than being overly concerned about special effects or ""humorous"" diversions (see the 2005 version).

It just goes to show if you have a good screenplay and some inspired acting, you can still beat CGI. This film actually has very good effects for the era in which it was produced, including imaginative use of video technology. However, it's the sets, costumes and songs that really make it stand out as a children's musical. About the only aspect of the new version (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, directed by Tim Burton) that is better is a couple of Danny Elfman's songs matched to the 'dispatch' of some of the naughty children. Gene Wilder might not have played Willy Wonka the way Roald Dahl envisioned, but if Johnny Depp did, I can only say Dahl's Wonka is a bit of a bore. Wilder really knew how to engage children with his characterization of Willy Wonka.I saw this film as a child in the theatre, and then got to watch it a lot on TV in the US as part of 'holiday programming'. It, along with 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', was always my favorite children's film. Critical reaction at the time was mixed, with many American critics not knowing what to make of this mostly British film with a mostly American cast.

It is likely that you already know the story is about 5 kids who get to tour a chocolate factory, but only one has the good character to make it through to the end of the tour.  I hadn't seen the movie for some years, and when I just rewatched it, was very impressed with the imagination of the chocolate factory.  I do not know the book, but I am sure that some praise for the movie's imagination should go to Harper Goff, the art director.  Harper Goff also designed Captain Nemo's ship on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and was one of the primary designers of Disneyland.  (Wikipedia says he met Walt Disney in a London model-making shop, when he and Disney both wanted the same model train.)  In addition, I have always been impressed with the battlefield set on Sergeant York, and it turns out Harper Goff was the set designer for that, too!Besides the chocolate factory's breathtaking beauty designed by Goff, I also love the many imaginative ideas and surprises throughout the factory.  Concerning the story, I found it to be nicely structured, and pleasantly predictable AND unpredictable.  Charlie finding a ticket is something you anticipate will happen, but don't know how.  Later, after the first kid gets eliminated from the tour due to gluttony, you anticipate that a different vice will mess up each remaining contestant except for Charlie.  Yet the story moves in a compelling direction toward higher values than just ""Don't overeat, be polite, don't be greedy, don't watch TV too much"", to honesty and the Golden Rule.  It reminds me of the difference between the Old and New Testament in the Bible, a list of rules and regulations vs. the simple Golden Rule, to treat others as you would want to be treated.  I like it that the Willy Wonka movie moves in that direction.  Everyone else fails because they're self-centered, except Charlie.  Their vices are outgrowths of selfishness.In conclusion, while I find some elements/devices within the story to be illogical or out of place, and sometimes puzzle over Wonka's mannerisms, I find the movie rewarding for its imagination and for moving the theme in a morally progressive direction.  The unpredictability of Wonka is a major source of tension in the story, and its sudden resolution at the end is quite rewarding.  Gene Wilder's performance, for the most part, was quite amusing to me, and he is quite good at wry humor, at combining serious and comedic characteristics into the same role.  And the Oompa Loompa song (I think they're supposed to look like carrots to make you want to eat vegetables) is truly unforgettable, whether you like the movie or not!  I can see why this movie has been watched by as many kids as The Wizard of Oz.  The dazzling colors and feeling of wonder at seeing the candy forest/chocolate river for the first time are so much like The Wizard of Oz.

This movie was made before I was even born and even to this day it holds up the test of time very well. It makes you wish that we had more movies like this now a days for kids and people of all ages to enjoy.The story is of a very poor little boy named Charlie who doesn't have much, doesn't want much and helps out the family that all live in a one room shack.  When news spreads of the chance to win a tour into the famous Willy Wonka chocolate factory, pandemonium ensues and everyone starts to buy his chocolate bars to hopefully find one of the 5 golden tickets hidden inside for a chance to tour the famous factory that has been closed for years to the public. Charlie wants nothing more then to win a ticket and when he does, that's when the magic starts.The wonderful part of the movie is the factory itself that we finally get to see after a very long , yet enjoyable build up of all the kids around the world who find the 4 tickets before Charlie and how much you start to really root for Charlie as we find out more about his sad life.  When we get to the factory itself we see who is behind the chocolate, all the inventions that he has come up with and all the trouble the kids get into and what happens due to their actions. It really is a very psychological story that will not only make you think but laugh at the same time when you realize what happens to some of the kids and their parents.I can't stress enough how great this movie truly is. It has songs and colorful sets and great special effects. The actors who are all no names except for Wilder himself all play their parts excellently.  Its almost like the Harry Potter of the 70s in a way.  If anything this movie will make you think and laugh and its a movie you truly will want to watch many times. The DVD doesn't have many special features but it has the commentary from the actual 5 kids who were in this movie, even if they are 20 years older now and some sing along songs and trailers.  Also any age will like this movie. The kids will like the humor while the adults will just like the songs and well written story.If you ever wanted to see a kid go from rags to riches and have all his dreams come true when all seemed lost.. this is the movie for you. Even if you didn't this is still the movie for you. Get it now. You won't be disappointed at the fun and hi jinx that unfold through the eyes of one poor kid and a wacky chocolate maker.",5,An awesome movie that you will  make you a chocolate lover,1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,2460,"['true', 'classic', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'even', 'born', 'even', 'day', 'test', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'movies', 'now', 'days', 'kids', 'people', 'ages', 'enjoy.The', 'story', 'very', 'poor', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Charlie', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'much', 'out', 'family', 'live', 'one', 'room', 'shack', 'When', 'news', 'spreads', 'chance', 'win', 'tour', 'famous', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'pandemonium', 'ensues', 'everyone', 'buy', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'hopefully', 'find', 'one', '5', 'golden', 'tickets', 'hidden', 'inside', 'chance', 'tour', 'famous', 'factory', 'been', 'closed', 'years', 'public', 'Charlie', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'win', 'ticket', 'when', 'when', 'magic', 'starts.The', 'wonderful', 'part', 'movie', 'factory', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'very', 'long', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'build', 'kids', 'world', 'who', 'find', '4', 'tickets', 'Charlie', 'how', 'much', 'start', 'really', 'root', 'Charlie', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'sad', 'life', 'When', 'get', 'factory', 'see', 'who', 'chocolate', 'inventions', 'come', 'up', 'trouble', 'kids', 'get', 'what', 'due', 'actions', 'really', 'very', 'psychological', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'think', 'laugh', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'realize', 'what', 'kids', 'parents.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'truly', 'songs', 'colorful', 'sets', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'names', 'Wilder', 'play', 'parts', 'excellently', 'almost', 'Harry', 'Potter', '70s', 'way', 'anything', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'laugh', 'movie', 'truly', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'actual', '5', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'movie', 'even', 'are', '20', 'years', 'older', 'now', 'sing', 'songs', 'trailers', 'Also', 'age', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'humor', 'adults', 'will', 'just', 'like', 'songs', 'well', 'written', 'story.If', 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'kid', 'go', 'rags', 'riches', 'have', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'when', 'seemed', 'lost..', 'movie', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'movie', 'Get', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'fun', 'hi', 'jinx', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'one', 'poor', 'kid', 'wacky', 'chocolate', 'maker']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405379,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,6304176287,C. L. Messina,"[0, 0]","There are a few things that have to be set aside to understand why anyone would love this film. Or should II say, it does have a few flaws that an adult, even one nostalgic for it, must concede.1. The Oompa-Loompas are not cute or sweet. Not that they should be, but their presence, while interesting is somewhat disturbing. Aside from being the most loyal factory workers Stalin could only dream of, what are they like? We never actually get to know them much more than a group of short men who celebrate each child's exit with song and dance. They present more questions than answers, which might be a good thing, but can disturb.2. The boat ride is needlessly shocking with no explanation for it's inclusion and no seeming reconsideration by the characters in the film. I guess they were too inundated with the onslaught of 'little surprises around every corner'.3. We don't really know exactly what becomes of the children who are ousted. Did they win the lifetime of candy or was WW serious about the contract?4. WW doesn't just make fantastic candy, he breaks the laws of physics with levitating bubbles and a teleporter (wonka-vision). Some magic is necessary, but this?5. The bad kids, aside from Veruca, are after all still children. Is gum chewing THAT bad? What about Augustus's eating problem? Some people have genetic disorders. And if the kid wants to eat, so what? I'm not saying these are model kids but they're not 'garbage' or 'nasty' as WW says.6. WW is sometimes unbearably rude even from the start. He insists his authority not be questioned or else. The way he grabs Veruca's face when she questions his 'Snozberry' remark is pretty crude and somewhat abusive.7. Grandpa Joe's incapacitation... That is until he gets a trip to a factory. Seems the elder's in the Charlie Bucket family could, say... Try. I do sympathize with Charlie and his Mother.So, there's the bad. I can admit to it. Now here's the good, or at least some explanations.Explanations first, or at least the way I understand it.1. The invention room is a ruse. Wonka KNOWS these kids will tell everyone they know everything they can and then some. He doesn't keep his most prized ideas in plain sight, he just wants the kids to have something insane and unbelievable to share when they get home. That way if they do see something important, listeners will dismiss it as nonesense.2. The boat ride is a slight ruse, but more like a Gargoyle to would be snoops. 'Don't go in Wonka's factory looking for secrets... There are passages where they cut off chicken heads!!!'3. Wonka always knew where the bars were hidden, that's how he could get 'Slugworth' nearby so quickly. Perhaps even the Candyman was an insider. 'Try a regular Wonka bar'.4.Wonka tried to help Charlie win. Did anyone notice he didn't offer Charlie a gobstopper until Grandpa Joe asked him for one?Reasons to likePerhaps I'm nostalgic, perhaps I just like to root for the underdog. On the surface this is an underdog story, but underneath it's about magic, surprises and youthful imagination. Wonka is a mad man- genious or hatter is up to the viewer. He's a mystery but one can't argue with his results. The movie is also very quotable. 'We are the music makers... And we are the dreamers of dreams.'  'Good morning... Look at the Sun!' I don't know, but seeing Charlie dance around with his granfather with joy and renewed hope just inspires me. It's a little corny but at the same time it's something you never see these days because it's not 'slick' or 'cool'. And that's a big part of what I like about the film. The setting, outside the factory is a time gone by. It was filmed in Munich, 1970 and it just seems like a storybook kind of land populated with storybook people. If these kids in the story are the worst of the lot then that must be heaven compared with today. Oh, and Veruca. What a name. Her fit/tantrum cracks me up every time. Who hasn't had a kid have an inexplicable meltdown? But that's how kids are- no need to send them to the furnace. And lastly, Charlie. He is about as sweet as they get. Wonka picked the right kid. And that ending line? Brilliant.It's not the glossiest, logical or even perfect film but it is endearing, mysterious, philisophical and disturbing all at once. That's quite a feat for any movie.Anyway, I love the film. I'm sure many others will continue to do so.",5,Hope this helps,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,4365,"['are', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'set', 'aside', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'love', 'film', 'should', 'II', 'say', 'have', 'few', 'flaws', 'adult', 'even', 'one', 'nostalgic', 'must', 'concede.1', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'are', 'not', 'cute', 'sweet', 'Not', 'should', 'be', 'presence', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'Aside', 'being', 'most', 'loyal', 'factory', 'workers', 'Stalin', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'what', 'are', 'never', 'actually', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'group', 'short', 'men', 'who', 'celebrate', 'child', 'exit', 'song', 'dance', 'present', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'disturb.2', 'boat', 'ride', 'needlessly', 'shocking', 'explanation', 'inclusion', 'seeming', 'reconsideration', 'characters', 'film', 'guess', 'were', 'too', 'inundated', 'onslaught', ""'little"", 'surprises', ""corner'.3"", 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'ousted', 'Did', 'win', 'lifetime', 'candy', 'was', 'WW', 'serious', 'contract', '4', 'WW', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'fantastic', 'candy', 'laws', 'physics', 'levitating', 'bubbles', 'teleporter', 'wonka-vision', 'magic', 'necessary', '5', 'bad', 'kids', 'aside', 'Veruca', 'are', 'still', 'children', 'gum', 'chewing', 'bad', 'What', 'Augustus', 'eating', 'problem', 'people', 'have', 'genetic', 'disorders', 'kid', 'eat', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'are', 'model', 'kids', ""'re"", 'not', ""'garbage"", 'WW', 'says.6', 'WW', 'sometimes', 'unbearably', 'rude', 'even', 'start', 'authority', 'not', 'be', 'questioned', 'else', 'way', 'Veruca', 'face', 'when', 'questions', ""'Snozberry"", 'remark', 'pretty', 'crude', 'somewhat', 'abusive.7', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'incapacitation', 'trip', 'factory', 'elder', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'family', 'could', 'say', 'Try', 'do', 'sympathize', 'Charlie', 'Mother.So', 'bad', 'can', 'admit', 'Now', 'here', 'good', 'least', 'explanations.Explanations', 'first', 'least', 'way', 'understand', 'it.1', 'invention', 'room', 'ruse', 'Wonka', 'KNOWS', 'kids', 'will', 'tell', 'everyone', 'know', 'everything', 'can', 'then', ""n't"", 'keep', 'most', 'prized', 'ideas', 'plain', 'sight', 'just', 'kids', 'have', 'something', 'insane', 'unbelievable', 'share', 'when', 'get', 'home', 'way', 'do', 'see', 'something', 'important', 'listeners', 'will', 'dismiss', 'nonesense.2', 'boat', 'ride', 'slight', 'ruse', 'more', 'Gargoyle', 'would', 'be', 'snoops', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'go', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'looking', 'secrets', 'are', 'passages', 'where', 'cut', 'off', 'chicken', 'heads', '3', 'Wonka', 'always', 'knew', 'where', 'bars', 'were', 'hidden', 'how', 'could', 'get', ""'Slugworth"", 'nearby', 'quickly', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'Candyman', 'was', 'insider', ""'Try"", 'regular', 'Wonka', ""bar'.4.Wonka"", 'tried', 'help', 'Charlie', 'win', 'Did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'Charlie', 'gobstopper', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'asked', 'one', 'Reasons', 'likePerhaps', ""'m"", 'nostalgic', 'perhaps', 'just', 'root', 'underdog', 'surface', 'underdog', 'story', 'magic', 'surprises', 'youthful', 'imagination', 'Wonka', 'mad', 'man-', 'genious', 'hatter', 'viewer', 'mystery', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'results', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'quotable', 'are', 'music', 'makers', 'are', 'dreamers', 'dreams', ""'Good"", 'morning', 'Look', 'Sun', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'seeing', 'Charlie', 'dance', 'granfather', 'joy', 'renewed', 'hope', 'just', 'little', 'corny', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'never', 'see', 'days', 'not', ""'slick"", 'big', 'part', 'what', 'like', 'film', 'setting', 'factory', 'time', 'gone', 'was', 'filmed', 'Munich', '1970', 'just', 'storybook', 'kind', 'land', 'populated', 'storybook', 'people', 'kids', 'story', 'are', 'worst', 'lot', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'heaven', 'compared', 'today', 'Oh', 'Veruca', 'What', 'name', 'fit/tantrum', 'cracks', 'time', 'Who', ""n't"", 'had', 'kid', 'have', 'inexplicable', 'meltdown', 'how', 'kids', 'are-', 'need', 'send', 'furnace', 'lastly', 'Charlie', 'about', 'as', 'sweet', 'get', 'Wonka', 'picked', 'right', 'kid', 'ending', 'line', 'Brilliant.It', 'not', 'glossiest', 'logical', 'even', 'perfect', 'film', 'endearing', 'mysterious', 'philisophical', 'disturbing', 'once', 'quite', 'feat', 'movie.Anyway', 'love', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'others', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

I have always loved this movie, and the Blu-Ray makes a good movie even greater! The picture quality is amazing for a 40+ year old film. The special features are not hi-def, and that makes you appreciate the restoration process that more for the actual movie! Speaking of the features, they could have been longer and in more detail, but at least we get something. Interviews with the Wonka Kids, The director, screenwriter, producers, and even vintage footage of behind the scenes material. There's even a segment where the music people are playing and singing at a piano, testing the songs out. I haven't listened to the commentary yet by the 5 Wonka kids, but I'm sure it's informative and a blast to listen to. Besides the features on the discs, we also get a making of booklet, several pages of Wonka production correspondence in a nice envelope, and a retro style tin case holding pencils and an eraser. The pencils are scratch-n-sniff, and the eraser smells somewhat like chocolate. Since they are collectable items, I will never actually use them, of course. The whole package is nice, inside a wonder foil case that is limited. I got 68,400 of 100,000.

I've so far had three disks that have failed, after working perfectly once or twice. It's the only Blu-Ray disk I've ever have any problems with, but I've heard of other people with similar issues. The transfer also was a bit disappointing in that there was little difference between the Blu-Ray release and the upconverted DVD, which I'm now using.At first I thought my Blu-Ray issue was just with my system; but then I tried playing other Blu-Ray disks -- even TERMINATOR T2, which is known to be problematic for some drives -- and they all played without a hitch. I carefully inspected the disc for any signs of smudges, warping or cracking and none was found, so why the Willy Wonka Blu-Rays have a high failure rate I don't know. I've inspected all the ones I've had that have failed and there's not one iota of visible problems with the disks.As for the movie itself, many have asked if it's a kid's movie. I don't think it is. One movie reviewer even praised the film, but added that it had a ""mean streak"" that may make it unsuitable for some. He missed the point that the film itself is more a view of children through the eyes of adults. All of the children, except Charley, are rotten vermicious knids (look it up). They're pushy, arrogant, demanding and they have disgusting habits like overeating and picking their noses. I think it's a great children's movie, especially since it tells children what many adults think of them and their overbearing and over-lenient parents. (If you buy your kid a car when he or she is 18, then look in the mirror!)The Blu-Ray transfer is disappointing probably in that it's a 70s musical, but the DVD is rich in color and had decent resolution when upconverted.

The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal film critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually mocks the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her. (By the way, check out the bonus features and see what these kids look like as adults!)Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy Wonka.  Yes, that character has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of ""Wonka,"" by the way, over the bizarre-but- talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest.

He along with almost half a dozen bratty children and their parents enter the factory finding a strange and bizarre world where candy grows on trees and singing and dancing little creatures named ""Oompa-Loompas"" create a variety of sweets. The film, at many times, boarders on sadistic as Wonka gives each child a taste of their own medicine throughout the tour. The acting is mediocre, the songs and musical numbers are not much better, and about the only bright spot is the little girl playing the role of the spoiled little girl, Varruca, does a  great job in the role.

Tim Burton arrogantly proclaimed that the original film was unnecessarily sappy. I had very fond memories of this film and so my wife and I purchased it hoping to see if Tim Burton was right about this movie needing to be remade to be more ""true to the book"".Thanks to the special features we discovered that Roald Dahl (The author of the book) had been responsible for the screen play, with some help of course, but even so the fact that the very man who wrote the book wrote the screenplay means that only this version of the film can come close to the author's vision of his story.When translating a book to film sacrifices have to be made, and in Willy Wonka's case those sacrifices are more so by way of omission than complete overhauls of the story. While the book is different, the flow, the heart, and soul of Roald Dahl's classic tale remain, as does the over all story. What I realized is that while I love Johnny Depp, and Tim Burton the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory has held its own since the very early 1970s, and is still a much loved family classic now some 35 years later. A remake is not necessary, and although I look forward to Tim Burton's interpretation Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka for my family and I.

I went to it with my parents, who were under the misconception that this was a fun, light-hearted childrens' romp at the local drive-in; I was digging my nails into my mom's headrest about 10 minutes into the thing. By the time the fat chick turned blue & was about to explode, I'd had it. My Ultra-Conservative, Vaguely Pious Little Boy Instincts had had enough.My parents practically had to do a bootlegger reverse in our whale-like family Oldsmobile to get me out of there, skirting the puzzled & the damned on their way back to the Horror with their popcorn and junior mints. Even then, on the verge of escape, my fingers clasped over my eyes, I was terrified at what hellish horrors the flickering blue-hued mountain-sized silver screen might burn into my young brain. Why did I look, you ask? Why look, on the verge of escape?Because I had to watch.That's the grim, ghoulish secret of ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", director Mel Stuart's cinematic Weapon of Mass Destruction & a screed advocating genocide against naughty children.Don't believe me? Yeah, well, they didn't believe the guy who said the alien diplomatic manual ""To Serve Man"" was a cookbook, either.""Wonka"" is nothing less than the incarnation of what every parent wishes, secretly, to inflict on miscreant children: the Torments of Hell. Oh, and brutal, violent, gory death. And then little men in big-hipped pants come and haul your carcass away.For one, there is the Chocolate Factory itself, a kind of gingerbread Auschwitz with looming smokestacks to match. The River of Chocolate is actually blood red: not brown, or caramel, or black, but red. Like blood. In fact, I think it is a river of blood, nourishing by way of strange caverns the vile, fleshy plants that fasten themselves along its unclean banks.Or take the little troglodyte Oompah Loompahs, who shuttle miscreants into the Factory's Death Traps, after which they're never seen again. Where did they go? Wonka glosses this over like the hardened war criminal he obviously is: don't worry, he coos, the Oompahs (the Stasi? the Gestapo? The SS?) are ""helping them"" get better.Even as a child I knew better. The Little Fat Blue Girl, for one? Yeah, sure, they're ""helping her""---helping mop her bright pink guts off the factory walls after she exploded. Or how about the little boy dragged into a chocolate tube & doubtless suffocated, or Charlie & his grampa's brush with whirring steely death in the Decapitator?Or what of the hellish topography of Wonkaland itself, where candy vats bubble like Yellowstone paint pots, bubbling, spitting, hissing, ready to snare and clutch and catch the unfortunate, usually a child, who gets too close & is scalded.This flick doesn't even bother disguising its real agenda: consider its psychedelic tunnel boat sequence, complete with hallucinatory glimpses of a writhing Conqueror Worm, dead birds, ambulatory guts, & the licking fires of Hell, accompanied by a nearly spastic Wonka yammering about Rowers rowing & ""the Fires of Hell a-Blowing (a film addition not found in the book).Or best of all, consider the character of Willy Wonka himself, played by comic genius Gene Wilder. Wonka is obviously deranged. Wilder surpasses himself in bringing a kind of spastic, deranged, dangerous manginess to the persona of the affable old Dickensian eccentric imagined in Roald Dahl's truly childish children's classic (itself a work of pure unbridled whimsy). To a child, Wonka isn't endearing, he's dangerous. He's the Mad Stranger. You don't talk to him.And why would you, when Wonka looks to be, and let's face it, probably is, a drug addict. Just look at the wretch: the ill-modulated voice, rising from sibilant to screech in seconds. Or the unkempt wispy hair jutting out from the moldy top hat, or the yellowish cankered clothes, or the wild, jerky, drug-addled mannerisms.Is it so difficult to imagine this candy-coated Mengele with his syringe full of lethal blueberry custard, his vivisections done for the day, dispatching a troop of Waffen Oompah Loompahs to haul the latest batch of child-sized black bodybags out the back door of his Gingerbread Dachau while he retreats to the privacy of his miserable, woeful office to break out the syringe, the needle, and the spoon?A child, rightly, recoils from such a Monster.If you let your child be influenced by this tomb-rat, be prepared when he proceeds to torturing small dogs with a cheese slicer in the shed, and from there to trolling the seedier night clubs in search of boyfriends to bring home for sedation, dismemberment, and storage in the refrigerator (or perhaps a chemical vat, in a true homage to the original Sick Willy).It is instructive to learn that Dahl, horrified by the cinematic adaption, filed a lawsuit against the producers and director Stuart, thus preventing them from using his characters again, and thereby scuttling sequels---and perhaps stoppering up a gate to the Land of the Damned.Show this infernal concoction of slow death to the impressionable only if you want to literally carry out Christ's injunction: ""Suffer the little Children.""JSG",1,Sick Willy,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,5773,"['Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'not', 'child', 'movie', 'Not', 'even', 'close.It', 'more', 'Express', 'Elevator', 'Hell',

405404,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6304176287,Deborah Earle,"[2, 4]","In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the release of this endearing childhood classic, I pay homage to its well-paced direction by Mel Stuart(who gave his son, Peter, a cameo role as a schoolkid), somewhat psychedelic art direction by Harper Golf, and a delightfully tuneful score by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, featuring the now-classic songs ""The Candy Man"" and ""World of Pure Imagination"".Although Roald Dahl, who wrote the screenplay, took liberties with his original 1964 novel, he and Stuart should be credited with presenting a less warped vision of this tale than Tim Burton's 2004 remake, although that version features certain elements that were more true to the story.Peter Ostrum gives a winsome, but thankfully not cloying performance as young Charlie Bucket, a poor kid living at the edge of an unnamed town, here portrayed by Munich, Germany--which does provide for some great aerial shots-- who delivers newspapers to help feed his family, including his mother, widowed in this film, but married in the story(Diana Sowle,at the time, an American military wife living on a Base in that city) and four bedridden grandparents(Dora Altman, Emel Ziegler, Franziska Liebing, and last, but not least, the lively and irascible Jack Albertson).Not far from the family's hovel is a mysterious candy factory run by an equally enigmatic candymaker named Willy Wonka, who has kept out of the public eye since a rival candymaker trumped him some 20 years earlier.It is interesting to note that Charlie's grandparents have been bedridden for as long as Wonka's factory has been dormant. But soon, Grandpa Joe, who once worked in the factory will come back to life in more ways than one, as will the factory.One day, while on his delivery route, Charlie sees the factory sign light up, and smoke waft out of its stacks. The commentary of a passing tinker(Peter Casell) only adds to the mystery of how the factory is maintained and how candy stores maintain supplies of the delicious Wonka treats when no one is ever seen going in and out of the factory.One day as Charlie is in class, a boy tells his off-kilter and slightly bombastic teacher, Mr. Turkentine(David Battley) of the announcement of Wonka's to open his factory, and class is dismissed.News reporters( Jack Lathain, Stephen Dunne, and Michael Gahr) chronicle the progress of the search for the five golden tickets hidden in any variety of Wonka bars, which will enable their lucky finders to tour the candymaker's factory.As the drudgery of the Bucket's lives continues, Charlie spends his meager earning's on a Wonka bar and is given one for his birthday. Neither yields a golden ticket.The first child to find one is a gluttonous boy from Germany named Augustus Gloop(Michael Bollner), whose mother( Ursula Reit), indulges his overeating.The next to find one is a spoiled rich girl named Veruca Salt(Julie Dawn Cole), whose father(Roy Kinnear) owns a nut factory, but has the women in his factory unwrap Wonka bars until a ticket is found.In the meantime, we see the worldwide mass hysteria over finding the tickets among computer scientists, in candy stores around the globe,at auctions, and even with the overly dramatic wife of a kidnapping victim(Gloria Manon), who is conflicted over turning over her boxes of Wonka bars in exchange for her husband's life.The next recipient is the brassy gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde(Denise Nickerson), whose car-dealer/politician father(Leonard Stone)muzzles in on his daughter's press conference to plug his business. Violet became a candybar muncher in lieu of a champion gum-chewer when learning of the contest.The fourth recipient is Mike Tevee(Paris Themmen), whose mother(Dodo Denney) indulges his sitting before the TV all day long, dressed as a cowboy and firing his toy pistol at the set every so often. It is unclear how he located his rare find.Charlie's discouragement grows in the midst of it all. His mother consoles himThere is further discouraging news that the final ticket is found. But when it turns out to be a fake, Charlie buys one final bar with money found in the street, and soon, the whole world will be his!Appearing to every ticket finder is one  Mr. Slugworth(Gunter Meisner) offering  the children a better deal if they will reveal a secret about their host-to-be.While not quite resembling the title character, Gene Wilder captures his eccentricities as he guides his guests through his factory, complete with an edible landscape, a chocolate river with a chocolate stirring waterfall, and odd little workers called Oompa Loompas who run the factory and sing moralistic songs as various calamities befall the children, when each surrender to their worst vices.Charlie and Grandpa Joe just barely escapes being annihiliated after illicitly sipping fizzy lifting drinks and rising up to a ceiling fan, in yet another departure from the original tale.Despite a day of unusual events, the one who should do so will win the day. It can only be hoped that wisdom will come with age for the others.40 years later, ""Willy Wonka"" still shines as a winning tale of the triumph of virtue for one young boy, happily ending with his fortunes literally on the up and up.",5,A World of Pure Imagination!,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,5206,"['celebration', '40th', 'anniversary', 'release', 'endearing', 'childhood', 'classic', 'pay',

The Johnny Depp version is up to date and complies more with the bood, gaining the squirrel scene in which this version had the oompa-loompas creating golden easter eggs.  I wouldn't say I prefer the Depp version to this one, but who would anyway?  Simply because we're more aquainted to the originals.  And the soundtrack?  Timeless.This film is a real dessert of a treat from the time the chocolately liquid covers the TV screen to the time the Wonkavator vanishes into the lonely sky.  I only wish Dahl would've let Warner Brothers film the sequel so viewers could vision Charlie's life after the Wonkavator ride.  But you still can't go wrong with this timeless classic.This film was created when G-rated films were genuinely G-rated.  I do have a problem with the boat scene.  As a kid, I was always disturbed by the psychadelic atmosphere where the weird creatures emerge in the background, and the chicken has its head cut off.  I happen to find that scene disturbing to children.  The new version has its scary moment with the squirrel scene as well.

Each participant harbors rather rotten personality traits, either insensitivity towards others, Letharginator neurosis, obnoxiousness, excessive gluttony, &/or disobedience. Total self-uncontrol. And the parents were spineless. Basically, they are all brats ----- except for one. The chosen one. He who demostrates deportment & consideration.I Am reminded of Dr. LaVey's sign on the bookshelf in the purple parlour, ""Do not remove books from shelves. Anyone caught removing books from shelves, will have their hands amputated."" This is in fact, the exremely simular way in which Mr. Wonka operates his factory. Unfortunately for them, they did not bother to really read the disclaimer at the beginning of the tour. The question is, would it have mattered anyway?For about the first 45 minutes or so, we become acquainted with the characters' predispositions towards the afore-mentioned traits.There's Varuca Salt, an unsufferable brat devoid of manners. There's a TV-loving cowboy kid whose entire existence seems to be centered around the boob-tube. There's a gum-chewing girl who does not listen to advice when given, & then there's a German boy who can't get enough food ---- whatever it is. In every case, they exhibit irresponsible & just annoying tendencies that need to be abated. Every one of these, after being tested, meets with an appropriate & poetic fate, all commandeered by the resident God, Willy Wonka.The infamous ""Golden Ticket,"" the instrument of their greed, brought them to The Chocolate Factory, but this is natural, for what candy-loving child can resist a trek into the wonderful world of Wonka?Indeed, all of the events leading up to the gates seemed planned.Within the hallowed walls of that chocomantium, there are total environments at every turn, each with their respective rides & attractions. Mr. Wonka makes a wonderful host; animated & witty. We get to see the ""Umpa-Loompahs"" from ""Umpahland"", & become familiar with their lore ----- it seems that kind Mr. Wonka took them in because they were being preyed upon by ""Pernicious Knids"", & other marvellous creatures from Umpahland. The Umpahloompahs provide moralistically compelling questions to the viewer with delightful little dances & songs.Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory is a semi-musical & comical production, providing interesting insights & alternative techniques of moral instruction.",5,"Welcome to The Chocolate Factory, 1 man's total environment",1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,2611,"['iconoclast', 'created', 'own', 'kingdom', 'according', 'precise', 'design', 'same', 'time', 'providing', 'wonderful', 'world', 'reality', '/', 'fantasy', 'crossover', 'children', 'ages.This', 'movie', 'indeed', 'Satanic', 'let', 'Me', 'explain', 'why', 'participant', 'harbors', 'rather', 'rotten', 'personality', 'traits', 'insensitivity', 'others', 'Letharginator', 'neurosis', 'obnoxiousness', 'excessive', 'gluttony', '/or', 'disobedience', 'Total', 'self-uncontrol', 'parents', 'were', 'spineless', 'Basically', 'are', 'brats', 'one', 'chosen', 'one', 'who', 'deportment', 'consideration.I', 'Am', 'reminded', 'Dr.', 'LaVey', 'sign', 'bookshelf', 'purple', 'parlour', 'Do', 'not', 'remove', 'books', 'shelves', 'Anyone', 'caught', 'removing', 'books', 'shelves', 'will', 'have', 'hands', 'amputated', 'fact', 'exremely', 'simular', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'really', 'read', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'tour', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'mattered', 'anyway', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'become', 'acquainted', 'characters', 'predispositions', 'afore-mentioned', 'traits.There', 'Varuca', 'Salt', 'unsufferable', 'brat', 'devoid', 'manners', 'TV-loving', 'cowboy', 'kid', 'entire', 'existence', 'be', 'centered', 'boob-tube', 'gum-chewing', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'listen', 'advice', 'when', 'given', 'then', 'German', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'food', 'case', 'exhibit', 'irresponsible', 'just', 'annoying', 'tendencies', 'need', 'be', 'abated', 'one', 'being', 'tested', 'meets', 'appropriate', 'poetic', 'fate', 'commandeered', 'resident', 'God', 'Willy', 'Wonka.The', 'infamous', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'instrument', 'greed', 'brought', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'natural', 'what', 'candy-loving', 'child', 'can', 'resist', 'trek', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Wonka', 'Indeed', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'gates', 'seemed', 'hallowed', 'walls', 'chocomantium', 'are', 'total', 'environments', 'turn', 'respective', 'rides', 'attractions', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'wonderful', 'host', 'animated', 'witty', 'get', 'see', 'Umpa-Loompahs', 'Umpahland', 'become', 'familiar', 'lore', 'kind', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'took', 'were', 'being', 'preyed', 'Pernicious', 'Knids', 'other', 'marvellous', 'creatures', 'Umpahland', 'Umpahloompahs', 'provide', 'moralistically', 'compelling', 'questions', 'viewer', 'delightful', 'little', 'dances', 'songs.Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'semi-musical', 'comical', 'production', 'providing', 'interesting', 'insights', 'alternative', 'techniques', 'moral', 'instruction']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

And this collection (I happened to get #8501 of the 100,000 that are floating around on Fizzy Lifting Drinks) is incredible. The slipcase pulls away and the first thing you see is the infamous Golden Ticket - which did advertise a contest from when the set was originally released. But it's a perfect copy of the ticket from the film.Delving deeper into this set, we find a slip folder with the 40th anniversary logo. Within are several copies of inter-company notes and letters recognizing the casting, discussing the making of the film, a copy of a hand-written letter from Gene Wilder to the producers, and a cover letter from Wily Wonka explaining the Golden Ticket contest.Further in the box is a high-gloss 130 page full colour paperback book entitled 'Pure Imagination'; its contents cover everything from the casting process to a ""Where are They Now?"". It's very well written and very insightful.THEN, we find two boxes of 'Wonka Bars': the smaller box (6x3"") has a hinged lid that reveals four pencils (with logos for Hair Creme, Banana, Blueberry, and Snozzberry; I have yet to open them, so I cannot tell you if the snozzberries do indeed taste like snozzberries). Also included is a thumb-sized eraser with the Wonka Bar logo.The larger of the boxes (averaged DVD size) contains the BD of the feature, the DVD of the feature and a DVD disc with two featurettes, the first of which is director waxes reminiscent about everything he did in the production and along with the spots with his kids (who both had minor roles in the film) we get to see some of their favourite moments throughout. The second featurette (Pure Imagination) is an original (and very dated) behind the scenes focusing on the writer of the novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. It moves on through the process of coming up with the sets, props and musical numbers.I have yet to listen to any commentary tracks, but I think it's safe to say it fits just as well as everything else WB gave us with this great collection of memorabilia.

405430,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,6304176287,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[4, 5]","I remember watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as a kid and not being able to get those unusual characters and songs out of my head. The story is based on the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", although the key word here is ""based."" Still, the movie is a great children's movie, and one of the movies that you can pick up and watch again later in life and watch with your kids.Really this story can be looked at in various ways. It is a kid's movie but timeless because it is has so many songs, unusual characters, and fantasy elements. The oompa-loompas, who work for Willy Wonka, sing songs, each containing a moral or lesson. There are many songs in the movie, including the famous ""Candy Man"" song as well as a few by Gene Wilder. There are also many visuals, such as colors and gadgets that Willy Wonka controls in his factory. If you haven't seen this film and want to visualize it, think a psychedelic Candyland, with a little of Wizard of Oz thrown in.One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) first comes out as the winners are awaiting the entrance into his factory. He comes out with a cane and slowly ambles to the gate only to do a flip at the end. I thought this was a fitting scene for Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka, because with this character, and in many other instances, what you see is not always what you get. This scene just seemed to typify the unusual oddity of Willy Wonka, and Wilder's ability to capture that essence of eccentricity makes the film a little more than just your average children's movie.In the story, the first five kids to get the golden sealed Willy Wonka Chocolate Bar will get a chance to visit the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory. Charlie, a good-hearted kid who is from a poor bed-ridden family, has hopes of being one of the lucky five. There is a mad dash to get a hold of the winning chocolate bar, and, after one of the supposed winners turns out to be a fraud, Charlie gets the chance to win the final spot. Although it is a kid's movie, there is a message that plays out (this being that goodness will eventually be rewarded), and we see that once the five winners visit the factory. Of all five children, Charlie is the only one that is a truly honest and good-natured child, and, because of this, he is the only one ultimately rewarded. The rest of the children all have their flaws and are punished accordingly because of these. Because this in large part a children's movie, I don't see any problem with the characters, especially the children, being pretty much prototypical and one-dimensional. The bigger emphasis in the film is on Charlie, and his hopes of not only winning this once-in-a-lifetime chance to visit the factory, but also to better the life of his family.While some may view the film as having a few ""dark"" elements (by the various methods the children are dispatched), it really is a fun movie with a good message overall. It really is a one-of-a-kind movie, and highly recommended. Hopefully ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", with Johnny Depp, will also be this fun.",4,"Wilder steals the show, great children's movie with a lesson",1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3102,"['remember', 'watching', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'kid', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'unusual', 'characters', 'songs', 'head', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'key', 'word', 'here', 'based', 'Still', 'movie', 'great', 'children', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'again', 'later', 'life', 'watch', 'kids.Really', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'various', 'ways', 'kid', 'movie', 'timeless', 'so', 'many', 'songs', 'unusual', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'oompa-loompas', 'who', 'work', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'sing', 'songs', 'containing', 'moral', 'lesson', 'are', 'many', 'songs', 'movie', 'including', 'famous', 'Candy', 'Man', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'visuals', 'such', 'colors', 'gadgets', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'want', 'visualize', 'think', 'psychedelic', 'Candyland', 'little', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'in.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'first', 'out', 'winners', 'are', 'awaiting', 'entrance', 'factory', 'out', 'cane', 'slowly', 'ambles', 'gate', 'only', 'do', 'flip', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'fitting', 'scene', 'Wilder', 'portrayal', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'character', 'many', 'other', 'instances', 'what', 'see', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'get', 'scene', 'just', 'seemed', 'typify', 'unusual', 'oddity', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Wilder', 'ability', 'capture', 'essence', 'eccentricity', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'children', 'movie.In', 'story', 'first', 'five', 'kids', 'get', 'golden', 'sealed', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Bar', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'visit', 'mysterious', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Charlie', 'good-hearted', 'kid', 'who', 'poor', 'bed-ridden', 'family', 'hopes', 'being', 'one', 'lucky', 'five', 'mad', 'dash', 'get', 'hold', 'winning', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'one', 'supposed', 'winners', 'out', 'be', 'fraud', 'Charlie', 'chance', 'win', 'final', 'spot', 'kid', 'movie', 'message', 'out', 'being', 'goodness', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'rewarded', 'see', 'once', 'five', 'winners', 'visit', 'factory', 'five', 'children', 'Charlie', 'only', 'one', 'truly', 'honest', 'good-natured', 'child', 'only', 'one', 'ultimately', 'rewarded', 'rest', 'children', 'have', 'flaws', 'are', 'punished', 'accordingly', 'large', 'part', 'children', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'characters', 'especially', 'children', 'being', 'pretty', 'much', 'prototypical', 'one-dimensional', 'bigger', 'emphasis', 'film', 'Charlie', 'hopes', 'not', 'only', 'winning', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'chance', 'visit', 'factory', 'also', 'better', 'life', 'family.While', 'may', 'view', 'film', 'having', 'few', 'dark', 'elements', 'various', 'methods', 'children', 'are', 'dispatched', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'overall', 'really', 'one-of-a-kind', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Hopefully', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'fun']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405433,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6304176287,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[103, 131]","The film is based on a much-loved children's book, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', by Roald Dahl.  Dahl wasn't always happy with the changes made between his book and the film, and wasn't always consulted on them.  Today probably more people are familiar with the film sequence of events than the book.  Charlie is a down-on-his-luck boy who is nonetheless optimistic and happy.  He and his mother work to tend for their bed-ridden family members, all living together in a one-room home.One day there is an annoucement that Wonka is going to open his factory to visitors, to be chosen more or less at random through finding the Golden Tickets, contained in Wonka bars (a brilliant marketing device back then).  Scenes of shoppers' frenzy are shown all around with world, including a Wonka delivery van shown arriving at the White House.The five golden tickets are found all around the world - the first one in Dusselheim, Germany, by the fat boy, Augustus Gloop (played by Michael Boliner, who is now a tax accountant in Munich, and is still rather large).  The second ticket was found in the UK, by spoiled brat, Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole, the only Wonka child still acting), whose father, Roy Kinnear, is a well-known actor in British cinema.  The third ticket was found in the USA, by gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson, now an accountant at a nuclear plant in Colorado), whose used-car-salesman father was played by Leonard Stone (who was selected over Jim Bakus).  The fourth ticket was also won in the USA, by Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen, considered a real brat by most of the cast and crew); his frantic mother was played by Dodo Denny (later Nora Denny), who was one of the few minor characters in the film to consistently act after this film.  The final ticket at first is reported to be won by some shady businessman from Paraguay, but in the end, that is proven to be a forgery.  Of course, Charlie buys a Wonka Bar expecting nothing, and gets the ticket.An ominous figure, Slugworth (the arch-enemy of Wonka - who knew chocolate makers also made arch-enemies?), appears to each of the winners, whispering in their ears.  Charlie is also confronted, and promised a reward should he bring Slugworth an example of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.  One wonders why (a) any candy maker would make a candy that never wears out (thus defeating re-sales), and (b) why Slugworth can't just buy one himself when they are released, analyse it and ruin his own factory the same way?  But I digress...  Gunter Meisner, a very prolific German actor, played the villain, who wasn't in the book (nor was the 'gobstopper plot').The grand day of the event, the winners enter the factory with great fanfare, meeting Wonka (Gene Wilder) for the first time, and get the first taste of his bizarre sense of theatre.  (It is reported not only Wilder's idea for the limping/somersault introduction to the crowd, but also a condition of his accepting the role.)  From that point on, what was truth?  It is ironic that Wonka's entrance doesn't occur until the film is half over.  What we remember of the film comes after this, but over half the film is actually set-up.  This is rather like the Wizard of Oz, where most of the film is done before we see 'the major character', although admittedly Wonka is far more prominent than Oz's balloonist.Wonka, the man of mystery, only ever became even more of a mystery as the tour progressed.  He is constantly switching his words ('we have so much time and so little to do'), and there are surprises at every turn.  Wonka borrows a lot of his key phrases (Ogden Nash, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde) and there are a lot of fantasy-inspired elements (Alice in Wonderland, Lord of the Rings).At each major scene, something ghastly seems to happen, but in epic-fantasy form, it doesn't seem to matter to the majority, who proceed onward with their quest.  In the chocolate room, Augustus Gloop meets his untimely exit from the factory by falling in the chocolate river.  Violet turns into a blueberry by chewing experimental gum, and has to be squeezed (squoozed?).  Veruca, in the room with the geese who lay the golden eggs, turns out to be a bad egg herself, but has a sporting chance of going down a chute with an inactive furnace.  Mike Teevee shrinks in the Wonka version of the Star Trek transporter beam, leaving in the end only Charlie, who is denied his prize of a lifetime of chocolate for a minor infraction.It would seem that Wonka had a sinister side in many ways - the boat that carries the prize winners only seated eight, implying that Wonka knew someone would be missing. The Wonkamobile only had seats for four guests. Of course, the children apparently all had sinister sides, too, including Charlie, until the end.  None of them let Wonka know of their Slugworth contact.In the end, we never know what becomes of the fallen questers - we are led to believe that in this candy factory they got their just desserts.  The Oompa-Loompas put the moral to each downfall in song, with a 1970s karaoke-type presentation of the lyrics as they sing.  In the end, of course, goodness and justice win out, as the factory is given to Charlie after his act of unwarranted kindness toward Wonka.Director Stuart always saw this film as a 'realistic' fantasy film.  Those things that are not over the top are very ordinary.  The people are not superheroes, and the situations, while fantastic, are not beyond the credible.  Stuart also did his best for 'real' reaction - the kids had never seen Gene Wilder before his appearance at the door, the chocolate room in the factory, or the Oompa-Loompas prior to the first scene, either, so their reactions are more natural.A great film for children and adults!",5,Candy is dandy...,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,5772,"['film', 'based', 'much-loved', 'children', 'book',

I'm now in my early 20's, so I grew up watching the original movie, but never have bought it until now and I'm glad I did.The movie is just as fantastic as when I watched it originally, it's just one of those classics that never get old no matter how many times you watch it. From the incredible acting of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, to the oompa loompas to the fantastic scores, this movie really does have it all, even though it doesn't really follow the novel as well as the new movie does.I have to applaud the team who worked on this DVD. When watching the movie, my entire family noticed how the picture was so colorful and clear. In my entire life, never have I see this movie in such color. I'm used to the aged, faded versions that always come on TV, but they have restored the movie perfectly on DVD. It's so colorful; the next best thing is to literally be there in person. Especially when they enter the candy room with the chocolate waterfall, it really is a feast for the eyes.The Menu Screen for both the main page and special features are extravagant, simply amazing detail on both screens.This DVD also has some very good special featuresPure Imagination: The Story of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory- This documentary lasts around thirty minutes long and gives us a look into the making of this timeless film. In it, there are new interviews with the director, Gene Wilder and all five children now grown up. It's interesting to hear how everything was made and hearing they kids', now adults, opinion of the film.  The most interesting part is that the documentary tells where and what Peter Ostrum (Charlie Bucket) and the others have been doing since the end of this film. This also includes footage of Roald Dahl, the author of the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", on the set of the movie but it doesn't have him speaking any.4 Sing-Along Songs: It's what it says, four songs from the movie are shown and the lyrics to the songs are at the bottom of the screen as they sing so you can sing along too. This feature is very interesting; the four songs that are shown are ""I've Got A Golden Ticket"", ""Pure Imagination"", ""I Want It Now"", and Veruca's Oompa Loompa song. It's nice that they give the lyrics so we know what they are saying, but sadly for some reason they don't have lyrics for the last song. I guess they figure that the words that pop up every now and then during the Oompa Loompa song is considered lyrics and none need to be added, but they should have. Even though the last song doesn't have full lyrics, this is still a pleasure to listen too, especially if you like the songs of the film.Vintage 1971 Featurette: This is a shorter and old version of the making of the movie ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". The film is very grainy, which is understandable because it is so old. This short, under ten minute, documentary mainly focuses on the set during the Chocolate room scene. Overall an o.k. addition, but the previous ""Pure Imagination"" documentary is far superior. But it's still nice to have an old documentary included that you can't find anywhere else. The more extras the merrier!Still Gallery: 18 black and white pictures that show scenes from the movie taken on set. It's interesting to see a few behind the scenes pics but the majority of the pictures are just black and white pictures of scenes from the movie.Theatrical Trailer: A longer than expected trailer for the movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". A very good trailer, but once again the film is faded and grainy. It goes to show how far superior the actually movie on this DVD is compared to the original film and what is shown a lot of the times on TV.The movie also has audio commentary with the Wonka kidsOverall it is easy to tell that this DVD was a labor of love. Everything on this is fantastic and wasn't just slapped together for a fast release, but you can tell that the people who worked on this DVD took their time and made this the best it could be, and it is. I was very impressed with how well this DVD came out! It is a must buy for everyone who loves Roald Dahl's incredible story about one kid who had nothing and ended up having it all.

Then there are the ""Ooompa Loompas"" and the tale which is told about them...incredibly sweet.Of course the ending is a little bit of a twist, but it fits in with the ""happily ever after"" agenda which Willy Wonka is hoping for, and he is not disappointed.

Adapted from Roald Dahls famous book, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, this film makes compelling viewing from beginning to end with wild-eyed Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka who ruthlessly sorts out the honest from the two faced when they visit his extravagent chocolate factory. The child performers in this are all excellent with Julie Dawn in particular putting in an amusing and effective performance as spoilt brat, Veruca Salt.

The 70s version of the movie gives us a Wonka who is far more benign than Johnny Depp's current version. Wilder revels in his role as candy magician, and maintains a charming enteraining eccentricity as he shares the wonders of his candy palace.Coming back to the movie after years away, I was amazed by the wittiness of it all. Some of Wilder's turns of phrase remind of books like ""The Phantom Tollbooth"". ""We have so much time and so little to do, wait reverse that."" It's hard to give a sense of how witty it is in the review. The search for the golden tickets is hilarious and cheerfully goes beyond the book with tongue in cheek newsreporting, auctions for boxes of Wonka bars and even a ransom for Wonka bars.The acting is mostly stellar, although I'll prefer the boy of the newer version to the perfection of the Charlie Bucket of this one. He is so innocent that he's just a little syrupy sweet for me. Grandpa Joe is great though, especially in the scene when he gets out of bed out of years of sleep.This is a great movie, that rare children's movie that's an equal pleasure for adults and kids alike.

The adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic is true to form and delivers the goods. Children of any age will relate to candy, chocolates, magic, and mystery; and Willy Wonka has it all. The characters are interesting and each have their faults: Augustus is a glutton, Violet is obsessive compulsive, Mike T.V.'s affliction is fairly obvious and Veruca Salt is the perfect spoiled brat. Charlie seemingly does not have any imperfections except for one that is revealed at the conclusion of the film: he is TOO kindhearted. All of the actors do a great job especially Gene Wilder who Willy Wonka is wry and cynical but a true dreamer. This is a timeless film for people of all ages. The factory itself has aged very well, it still looks like magic everytime Willy opens the door into the chocolate room, and don't deny it every single one of us would love just 5 minutes alone in that room! There is only one questionable scene in the film which comes during the boat ride sequence and really has no place in the film. It depicts animals eating each other, a chicken being decapitated, and a snake running across a woman's face. These images should not have been included and are scary to children. Some of the other musical sequences are quite trite as well. The one in particular is when Charlie's mother is singing as he is walking home(talk about skip or fast forward).

To me, it was a 'high body count' film with kids 'dying' all over the screen. The drowning in the chocolate river was scary and the Umpa-Lumpas looked like monsters. It was almost pervertic because there was this song and dance when kids are 'dying' all over in a beautiful chocolate factory.And for a typical 5, 6 yrs old kid, isn't it a dream to watch a lot of TV while chewing gum, eating candy and nagging your parents to buy more toys ? (you can't teach a dog a lesson by beating him up unless he understands what he did wrong)However, as an adult, I really loved the movie and regreted that I didn't not watch it again at, say, 10 years old. I thought I knew what the movie was all about and because I was turned off big time when I was a kid, I never considered watching it again until quite recently. It should have a disclaimer ""Not for immature kids who do not understand the concept of morality"".Also, it will be helpful if the supervising adult clarifies some of the concepts to the kid afterwards. Because Charlie's character does not stand out in the film as he is not a look-at-me screaming & flashy boy, and kids with short attention span might not understand why Charlie is rewarded in the end.",5,great movie if you understand the moral of the story.

The story revolves around Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum), a lower-class child who longs to find one of the elusive golden tickets. Willy Wonka (played magnificently by Gene Wilder) has hidden 5 golden tickets inside Wonka bars.  The finder of the ticket will be treated to a lifetime supply of chocolate as well as a trip through Wonka's magical factory. Charlie grows more and more distressed as the tickets are found.  Finally, Charlie finds some money lying in the street and purchases 2 Wonka bars.  The second bar contains the elusive 5th golden ticket!  Charlie is allowed to take 1 member of his family along for the trip to the factory.  Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson).  Once inside, the lucky winners are taken on a magical tour of Wonka's factory.  I particularly enjoyed the way the Oompa Loopas gave a moral to each of their stories to help children learn right from wrong.  The numbers dwindle as the tour continues due to misbehaving children.  Finally, only Charlie is left.  At the end, Wonka ""tests"" Charlie by saying that he and Grandpa Joe violated a clause in the agreement they signed, and he uncerimoniously dismisses them.  Charlie gives the gobstopper back to Wonka before leaving.  This was the test; a test of honesty and trustworthiness and Charlie succeeded.  Wonka gives the factory and all of his most precious candy making secrets to Charlie.Morals are taught throughout the film by the actions of the characters. Agustus Gloop falls into the chocolate river and gets stuck in the pipe.  The moral: don't eat too much.  Violet Beauregard turns into a blueberry while chewing a special gum.  The moral: don't eat a lot of sweets.  Veruca Salt falls down a chute while trying to get a golden goose.  The moral: don't whine and continually ask for things. Finally, Mike Teavee gets shrunk by a tv camera.  The moral: don't watch a lot of television.  The Oompa Loompas also teach morals in the puzzles and riddles they share.The special effects in this film are pretty good considering it is 30 years old.  The ""fizzy lifting drinks"" and the ""great glass elevator"" are especially well done.  As a parent, I highly recommend this movie.

The story is wonderful and inspiring, the songs are touching, lighthearted, and fun, and some of the performances are as natural-like and believable as they come.The movie is about kids, and one kid in particular (Charlie Bucket) is the leading character, but Willie Wonka is the star.  Willie Wonka is a famous candy maker and he holds a contest that captures the world's attention.  Mr. Wonka has hidden five ""golden tickets"" in five candy bars (five of the millions of Wonka candy bars sold around the world).  Whoever finds the golden tickets will win a lifetime supply of chocolate PLUS a tour of the fabulous Wonka chocolate factory.The whole world goes Wonka Bar crazy searching for the golden tickets (a lot of fun in the movie) and eventually five children find the tickets.  They and five adults (each kid is allowed to bring one family member) are then given the tour.  The chocolate factory does have its perils, however, and ... one-by-one ... the children are, um, eliminated until only one of them is left.  That kid (Charlie) is then made heir to Willie Wonka's chocolate empire.""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is based on the children's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl.  Roald Dahl also wrote ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Matilda.""  A creative mind if ever there was one.  His stories are always fun, but they usually have a dark side to them ... and ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is no exception.The songs in ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" were written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley.  Anthony Newley was a rare talent.  He was a good song writer, a popular singer, and a fine actor (Dr. Dolittle).  Here in Willie Wonka the songs fit the varying moods of the movie nicely and are always optimistic.Gene Wilder plays Willie Wonka and ... if ever a man was born to play a part, it was Gene Wilder for Willie Wonka.  His quirky perfectionist personality was perfect for the eccentric perfectionist personality of Willie Wonka.  Peter Ostrum plays Charlie Bucket and he is something special.  Innocent, engaging, and full of boyish charm, he gives ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" its heart ... and sort-of holds the movie together.  Diana Sowle plays Charlie's worn out mother Mrs. Bucket and she is excellent ... excellent in an understated way so that you sort-of have to try to notice her good acting ... and she gives the movie strength and authenticity.Julie Dawn Cole, Denise Nickerson, and Paris Themmen play three of the kids (Veruca, Violet, and Mike) and they are wonderful at being obnoxious little brats ... with Miss Nickerson (as Violet) being my favorite.  Roy Kinnear, Leonard Stone, and Nora Denney play three of the parents and they are a lot of fun ... with Mr. Kinnear (as Veruca's dad) being especially funny.The movie ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was originally conceived as a way to promote a new candy bar ... a real life ""Wonka Bar.""  That's why they changed the name of the story from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" to ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  The candy bar failed to make it, but this movie has lived on.I have sort-of wondered why ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has remained popular after all these years.  It wasn't a big budget movie.  There were no real stars in it.  The special effects were not outstanding.  And the movie was sort-of thrown together.  Gene Wilder does a marvelous job ... in a subtle sort-of way ... but I think it's the innocence in the movie that saves the day.  This innocence is brought out by Peter Ostrum (as Charlie) and, to a lesser extent, Diana Sowle (as Charlie's mother).  Honesty.  Hard work.  Caring about others. Giving and sacrifice.  All these things are portrayed in the movie so naturally that they almost escape our notice, but they give ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and enduring charm and appeal ... and I think that is why each new generation of children (and adults) have embraced it.",5,Fun Movie ... that has remained popular,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,4097,"['are', 'lot', 'things', 'make', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'special', 'movie', 'story', 'wonderful', 'inspiring', 'songs', 'are', 'touching', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'performances', 'are', 'natural-like', 'believable', 'come.The', 'movie', 'kids', 'one', 'kid', 'particular', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'leading', 'character', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'star', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'famous', 'candy', 'maker', 'contest', 'world', 'attention', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'hidden', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'five', 'candy', 'bars', 'five', 'millions', 'Wonka', 'candy', 'bars', 'sold', 'world', 'golden', 'tickets', 'will', 'win', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'chocolate', 'PLUS', 'tour', 'fabulous', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'factory.The', 'whole', 'world', 'Wonka', 'Bar', 'crazy', 'searching', 'golden', 'tickets', 'lot', 'fun', 'movie', 'eventually', 'five', 'children', 'find', 'tickets', 'five', 'adults', 'kid', 'allowed', 'bring', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'are', 'then', 'given', 'tour', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'have', 'perils', 'however', 'one-by-one', 'children', 'are', 'um', 'eliminated', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'kid', 'Charlie', 'then', 'made', 'heir', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'empire', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'based', 'children', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'also', 'wrote', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Matilda', 'creative', 'mind', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'usually', 'have', 'dark', 'side', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'exception.The', 'songs', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'were', 'written', 'Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'was', 'rare', 'talent', 'was', 'good', 'song', 'writer', 'popular', 'singer', 'fine', 'actor', 'Dr.', 'Dolittle', 'Here', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'songs', 'fit', 'varying', 'moods', 'movie', 'nicely', 'are', 'always', 'optimistic.Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'ever', 'man', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'part', 'was', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'quirky', 'perfectionist', 'personality', 'was', 'perfect', 'eccentric', 'perfectionist', 'personality', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Peter', 'Ostrum', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'something', 'special', 'Innocent', 'engaging', 'full', 'boyish', 'charm', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'heart', 'sort-of', 'movie', 'together', 'Diana', 'Sowle', 'Charlie', 'worn', 'out', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Bucket', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'understated', 'way', 'sort-of', 'have', 'try', 'notice', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', 'strength', 'authenticity.Julie', 'Dawn', 'Cole', 'Denise', 'Nickerson', 'Paris', 'Themmen', 'play', 'three', 'kids', 'Veruca', 'Violet', 'Mike', 'are', 'wonderful', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'brats', 'Miss', 'Nickerson', 'Violet', 'being', 'favorite', 'Roy', 'Kinnear', 'Leonard', 'Stone', 'Nora', 'Denney', 'play', 'three', 'parents', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'Mr.', 'Kinnear', 'Veruca', 'dad', 'being', 'especially', 'funny.The', 'movie', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', 'way', 'promote', 'new', 'candy', 'bar', 'real', 'life', 'Wonka', 'Bar', 'why', 'changed', 'name', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'candy', 'bar', 'failed', 'make', 'movie', 'lived', 'on.I', 'have', 'sort-of', 'wondered', 'why', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'remained', 'popular', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'were', 'real', 'stars', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'was', 'sort-of', 'together', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'marvelous', 'job', 'subtle', 'sort-of', 'way', 'think', 'innocence', 'movie', 'day', 'innocence', 'brought', 'out', 'Peter', 'Ostrum', 'Charlie', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Diana', 'Sowle', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'Honesty', 'Hard', 'work', 'Caring', 'others', 'Giving', 'sacrifice', 'things', 'are', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'so', 'naturally', 'almost', 'escape', 'notice', 'give', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'enduring', 'charm', 'appeal', 'think', 'why', 'new', 'generation', 'children', 'adults', 'have', 'embraced']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405488,A356HRZZFCEGL1,6304176287,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[2, 2]","***This review may contain spoilers.***There's no need for me to reinvent the movie camera and describe in detail (at least I hope) the delectably subversive ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (hereafter ""Wonka"").  Many of the posters here have satisfactorily seen to that, and anyway most people know the plot.  In this review I will comment upon the primary but latent theme of ""Wonka"": the restoration of faith in human nature, specifically childrens' human nature.""Wonka"" is of course superficially cheery, colorful, and buoyant, even in the shabbier scenes where Charlie interacts with his impoverished mother and four grandparents in their hovel.  However, the movie first deftly skewers humanity's greedy inhumanity to man with Willie Wonka's Golden Ticket contest. The movie accurately depicts the scuffles, deceptions, neglect, and hysterical chaos the world's citizens shamefully show to get that ticket.  One supposed winner is later revealed to be fraudulent.  Furthermore, four of the winners are already generally upper-class louts with various vices who each get the ticket in at least slightly shady ways.  Only poor-but-honest Charlie wins the fifth ticket through determined but legitimate means.You might imagine at this point that the sponsor of this contest Wonka is sighing with justified despair at the antics of the world.  It confirms his conclusion that people are just no good.  Still, he is compelled to test people to see if they'll prove him wrong, or just for the slightly sadistic hell of it.  For starters, remember when the reclusive Wonka first emerges from his mysterious factory pretending to be lame, then does a forward flip?  Then almost immediately afterwards Wonka has the kids and their guardians read the factory tour contract with diminishing type on the wall, spelling out what actions (including espionage) will forfeit his candy empire's transfer.  Gulp!  But each of the kids have met the eerily enigmatic Slugworth, Wonka's ""rival"" before the tour.  Will the kids sell out to Slugworth?  And don't forget the psychedelic paddleboat trip with some unsettling images (including chicken beheadings), with Wonka blithely singing a nonsense tune.Of course you know the rest of the story.  Wonka wearily but hilariously says, ""No, stop, come back"", but he doesn't stop the gluttonous kid, the spoiled brat, the gum-obsessed kid with poor manners, and the TV-addict kid from encountering their horrific but fitting punishments.  Even Charlie and his grandpa don't prove saintly.  Against orders, they sample the ""fizzy-lifting drinks"", float to the ceiling, are nearly filleted by the fan, and have to burp to get back down again.  Furthermore, Charlie has pocketed an everlasting gobstopper to sneak away to Slugworth.But Wonka seems to see all.  At the end of the tour, he is ready to escort Charlie and Grandpa Joe out.  When they ask why, he screams at them that they violated the contract provisions with their drink antics and therefore get NOTHING.  Before leaving, Charlie sadly and silently returns the purloined gobstopper.  Immediately, Wonka becomes jubilant.  Why?  Because Charlie proved himself worthy by not betraying Wonka and giving a candy sample to Slugworth, who was a Wonka employee posing as an industrial spy.  It was all a test, and Charlie passed it.  Human beings can be noble and trustworthy after all.Make no mistake, ""Wonka"" is an entertaining fantasy, but it is also a shadowy moralistic one mercilessly pointing out human sins, but rejoicing when one person rises above their sins.",4,"The Dark Cynicism of ""Willie Wonka...""

I saw this movie with my mother and two sisters' when I was seven years old. I had read the book and I absolutely loved it so I was so excited to see the movie.I was entranced by Gene Wilder. With his crazy hair and his mischievous eyes. Being seven years old, I didn't get all of his sarcastic little comments he makes throughout the movie, but now I fully appreciate his biting wit.The part that got me the most...and still does...is towards the end when the tour is complete and Mr. Wonka just kind of brushes off Charlie and Grandpa Joe. Grandpa Joe and Charlie both look confused about how it all ended so they go into Wonka's office to find out about how they go about getting Charlie's lifetime supply of chocolate.Gene Wilder at this moment was positively frightning the way he came at Grandpa Joe. I remember thinking to myself that he was a crazy man. Then, feeling remorse for what he had done to betray Wonka's trust, Charlie puts the his everlasting gobstopper - a gift from Wonka - on his desk and walks away dejectedly.Wonka was testing Charlie. To see if he really was as good as he appeared to be. He wasn't spoiled, he wasn't a glutton, he didn't have any out of control habits...Charlie was the epitome of an innocent child and Wonka wanted someone innocent and childlike to run his factory after he retires which is why he sent out the golden tickets in the first place.He asks Charlie, ""Do you know what happened to the little boy who wanted it all?""Charlie responds eagerly, ""No, what?""Wonka smiles sweetly, ""He got it...""To this day it chokes me up because that little boy, Charlie, reminded me and still reminds me that being a child is a gift. Adults tend to lose their imaginations. They tend to be easily bought out. They tend to be greedy and competetive and there is no magic in competition, there is no beauty in greed, only with Love and Innocence can True Abundance come forth; the treasures of the Spirit are always ours. This movie is truly a metaphysical gem. The song, 'Pure Imagination' says it best:""If you want to view paradise, simply look around a view it...Anything you want to, do it...Want to change the world?There's nothing to it.There is no place I know that compares to that of my imagination,Living there you'll be freeIf you truly wish to be...""Wow.

405492,AA3EC3LKOBD80,6304176287,Jonathan Cohen,"[9, 10]","Much has been said about ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and much will be said as the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp remake approaches. So here are a few more words about what I think is the greatest children's book-turned-movie of all...* Why ""Willy Wonka"" instead of ""Charlie""? Turns out that the film's financial backer, Quaker, wanted to go into the candy business and introduce a Wonka bar as a movie tie-in. They should have stayed with cereal because the prototype Wonka bar melted on contact. The movie, however, has proven to be as indestructible as an Everlasting Gobstopper.* Gene Wilder was already established as Mel Brooks' favorite leading man, but his work as Willy Wonka is as distinctive as that gaudy purple coat of his. As the avuncular candy czar with the very warped sense of humor, he still lights up the screen and has those kids eating out of his hand in more ways than one.* The five children were culled from playhouse programs in three countries; Peter Ostrum, so cute and likably innocent as Charlie, came from Cleveland and the same company that once had Paul Newman and Debra Winger on their roster. The most adept of them, I think, is Julie Dawn Cole, so perfectly bratty (and with a biting London accent to boot) as Veruca Salt. It's no surprise to learn that she's the only one of the five that remained a full-time actress.* Did you know that Jean Stapleton almost wound up as Mike Teavee's dotty mom? She was initially offered the part, but at the last minute decided to go with a ""new kind of sitcom"". You know the rest, of course, but Nora ""Dodo"" Denney did a great job as my favorite of the parents.There are tons of little tidbits like these, and you can find them on the excellent supplementary features that are part of this DVD: a well-done documentary that interviews most of the surviving principals; a full-length commentary that reunites all five Wonka kids for the first time in 30 years; and a short clip focusing on the Oscar-winning, Disney-trained set designer, Harper Goff. Very telling, for hard-core Dahl fans, are the comments by David Seltzer, the now-veteran screenwriter whose first major assignment was to rewrite Dahl's original script just before filming began. The softer Wonka, the Slugworth subplot, the parts involving TV newscasters are Seltzer's additions, but the sequence of the kids' introductions and most of the factory scenes remain true to Dahl's work.As you can tell, I've been a serious devotee of both book and film ever since I got a copy of the original ""Charlie"" for my seventh birthday (which I still proudly own). That's why I added these comments rather than rehash the movie itself- you probably know it by heart, too!I don't know anyone who doesn't know this story by heart, so I heartily recommend this excellent package for both devoted fan and neophyte alike. No matter what the Burton/Depp version holds- and given Tim's history of deadpan horror comedy, I'm sure it will be a lot eerier than this one, whose gaudy '60s-style colors somehow don't look dated- there will always be a fond place in the hearts of kids of all ages for the original, and still great, ""Willy Wonka"".Oh, yeah- I ate a candy bar a day, every day, for many years after reading this and never did find that Golden Ticket!",5,STILL WORTH A GOLDEN TICKET!,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,3285,"['Much', 'been', 'said', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'said', 'Tim', 'Burton/Johnny', 'Depp', 'remake', 'approaches', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'words', 'what', 'think', 'greatest', 'children', 'book-turned-movie', '*', 'Why', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'instead', 'Charlie', 'out', 'film', 'financial', 'backer', 'Quaker', 'wanted', 'go', 'candy', 'business', 'introduce', 'Wonka', 'bar', 'movie', 'tie-in', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'cereal', 'prototype', 'Wonka', 'bar', 'melted', 'contact', 'movie', 'however', 'proven', 'be', 'as', 'indestructible', 'Everlasting', 'Gobstopper', '*', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'was', 'already', 'established', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'favorite', 'leading', 'man', 'work', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'as', 'distinctive', 'gaudy', 'purple', 'coat', 'avuncular', 'candy', 'czar', 'very', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'still', 'up', 'screen', 'kids', 'eating', 'hand', 'more', 'ways', 'one', '*', 'five', 'children', 'were', 'culled', 'playhouse', 'programs', 'three', 'countries', 'Peter', 'Ostrum', 'cute', 'likably', 'innocent', 'Charlie', 'came', 'Cleveland', 'same', 'company', 'once', 'had', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'roster', 'most', 'adept', 'think', 'Julie', 'Dawn', 'Cole', 'so', 'perfectly', 'bratty', 'biting', 'London', 'accent', 'boot', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'surprise', 'learn', 'only', 'one', 'five', 'remained', 'full-time', 'actress', '*', 'Did', 'know', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'almost', 'wound', 'up', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'dotty', 'mom', 'was', 'initially', 'offered', 'part', 'last', 'minute', 'decided', 'go', 'new', 'kind', 'sitcom', 'know', 'rest', 'course', 'Nora', 'Dodo', 'Denney', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'favorite', 'parents.There', 'are', 'tons', 'little', 'tidbits', 'can', 'find', 'excellent', 'supplementary', 'features', 'are', 'part', 'DVD', 'well-done', 'documentary', 'most', 'surviving', 'principals', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'five', 'Wonka', 'kids', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years', 'short', 'clip', 'focusing', 'Oscar-winning', 'Disney-trained', 'set', 'designer', 'Harper', 'Goff', 'Very', 'telling', 'hard-core', 'Dahl', 'fans', 'are', 'comments', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'now-veteran', 'screenwriter', 'first', 'major', 'assignment', 'was', 'rewrite', 'Dahl', 'original', 'script', 'just', 'filming', 'began', 'softer', 'Wonka', 'Slugworth', 'subplot', 'parts', 'involving', 'TV', 'newscasters', 'are', 'Seltzer', 'additions', 'sequence', 'kids', 'introductions', 'most', 'factory', 'scenes', 'remain', 'true', 'Dahl', 'work.As', 'can', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'serious', 'devotee', 'book', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'copy', 'original', 'Charlie', 'seventh', 'birthday', 'still', 'proudly', 'own', 'why', 'added', 'comments', 'rather', 'rehash', 'movie', 'itself-', 'probably', 'know', 'heart', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'heart', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'package', 'devoted', 'fan', 'neophyte', 'alike', 'matter', 'what', 'Burton/Depp', 'version', 'holds-', 'given', 'Tim', 'history', 'deadpan', 'horror', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'eerier', 'one', 'gaudy', ""'60s-style"", 'colors', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'dated-', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'fond', 'place', 'hearts', 'kids', 'ages', 'original', 'still', 'great', 'Willy', 'Wonka', '.Oh', 'yeah-', 'ate', 'candy', 'bar', 'day', 'day', 'many', 'years', 'reading', 'never', 'did', 'find', 'Golden', 'Ticket']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

I have probably seen this film over 500 times by now, since the 80's and I still am not the least bit bored of it.  At 28 years old, I still totally love this film!!!  The characters, especially Gene Wilder who plays Willy Wonka, who is THE Willy Wonka, who could never be topped EVER (yes I've seen the 2005 film!), the music, the setting, the songs, and especially the Oompa-Loompa's!  Everything in this film is so wonderfully done and everyone who hasn't seen it yet, needs to as soon as possible!!My favorite place or scene in the whole film has to be the big candy and chocolate room where Willy Wonka sings ""Pure Imagination.""  Not only for the song but because I can see how much work the director put into this film.  All the candy and chocolate looks so real and alive and the whole room looks so beautiful the way everything is set up!  I also love that teacher, Charlie's teacher that you see a lot until they go into the chocolate factory, he is so funny!  And it's set in London, an added bonus!!  I just cannot get enough of this film or recommend this film enough!!  It's a masterpiece!!!  It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!!!Who could not love Veruca's ""I Want It Now"" performance?  That whole scene was totally brilliant!The Special Widescreen Edition DVD has tons of extras.  There is commentary by the kids who got to go inside the factory.  You'll also learn that Gene Wilder wouldn't play Willy Wonka unless he was able to do that somersault that he does before letting the kids through the gate.  There is an interview with Gene Wilder from 2001, The Making of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, four sing along songs, a 1971 behind the scenes featurette, and a photo gallery.",5,"Oompa-Loompa, doopity do, I've got another puzzle for you!",1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,1856,"['WOW', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'wonderful', 'even', 'today', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', '1971', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'film', '500', 'times', 'now', '80', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'bored', '28', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'totally', 'love', 'film', 'characters', 'especially', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'who', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'who', 'THE', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'who', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'topped', 'EVER', 'yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2005', 'film', 'music', 'setting', 'songs', 'especially', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'Everything', 'film', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'everyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'favorite', 'place', 'scene', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'big', 'candy', 'chocolate', 'room', 'where', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Pure', 'Imagination', 'Not', 'only', 'song', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'director', 'put', 'film', 'candy', 'chocolate', 'looks', 'so', 'real', 'alive', 'whole', 'room', 'so', 'beautiful', 'way', 'everything', 'set', 'up', 'also', 'love', 'teacher', 'Charlie', 'teacher', 'see', 'lot', 'go', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'so', 'funny', 'set', 'London', 'added', 'bonus', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'film', 'recommend', 'film', 'enough', 'masterpiece', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'Who', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'Veruca', 'Want', 'Now', 'performance', 'whole', 'scene', 'was', 'totally', 'brilliant', 'Special', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extras', 'commentary', 'kids', 'who', 'got', 'go', 'factory', ""'ll"", 'also', 'learn', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'somersault', 'letting', 'kids', 'gate', 'interview', 'Gene', 'Wilder', '2001', 'Making', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'four', 'sing', 'songs', '1971', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'photo', 'gallery']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

The biggest irritation was how Charlies mother worked her fingers to the bone to support her mother, father, in-laws and bastard son all while Grandpa Joe laid in bed ill for twenty years.

If you've been a fan of Willy Wonka with similar circumstances as myself, then you too will find the HD DVD version a bit bigger, a bit sweeter and a bit more marvelous in 1.85:1 than you might remember from its annual 4:3 television presentations. The presentation is enough to make some of it feel new.As for the HD transfer, I'll admit that it's not what I was hoping for, nor am I disappointed - when Charlie looks through the fence at the factory in the distance there's a bit of noise in the sky - though it does look decent for its era. The stitching on Willy Wonka's coat is nice and sharp. When I zoom in to 2x I am able to see a bit of a jagged edge that I don't see while zoomed in on other old films.A second viewing with the Wonka kinds' commentary turned on is definitely worth doing, as it offers some additional historical insight - I found it quite interesting.This is a classic movie enjoying a nice HD transfer, only slightly showing its age.

405514,A2OG7XE23X5UM2,6304176287,"KC ""KC""","[15, 50]","I watched this with my husband (who for some reason enjoys this film) again and I still don't know WHY it is so beloved.  I mean...the film ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (based, like this film, on a classic children's book) is almost forgotten and they're pretty much the same as far as entertainment value, writing, etc.  I guess it must be the fact that Gene Wilder is in this, or maybe it's that LSD trip scene with the B-horror movie stock footage inserted - I have no idea.I actually first saw this on its initial screen release back in the early/mid 70's - ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was one of my favorite books and so of course I was eager to see the film.  What a disappointment it was to me then.  Now it's just distasteful, boring, with shoddy production values.(My husband says ""but it's a FANTASY"" - he never did read the book...)Charlie's family - this is supposed to be taking place in the 1960's/1970's, yet Charlie's mom is supporting the family by taking in washing which she boils in a tub - the way wash was done back in the 19th century.  In fact, the Bucket family lives pretty much in the 19th century - the only respite for Charlie is when he goes to school and into 'modern times'.  In the book, Charlie also has a dad who lost his job at the toothpaste factory.  Grandpa Joe seems to know a lot about Wonka - could he have been one of the workers who lost his job when Wonka closed the factory and brought in the free labor of the Oompa-Loompas, most likely sending the town into unemployment and depression?  Hmm.The Golden Ticket search - doesn't it strike you as funny that ""Slugworth"" and the news film crews were always on the scene the moment the tickets were found?  Sounds like a setup to me.  I think Wonka had his eye on Charlie as a successor from the getgo (I mean he DID live in the same town as the Wonka factory) but thought it would be a good idea to have the contest.  Think of how much money he made in the sale of candy worldwide - Wonka probably needed the extra bucks to finance his crazy schemes such as sending a bar of chocolate through TV.  And speaking of inventions - those Everlasting Gobstoppers that a person could suck on forever - how the heck are you supposed to put those things in your mouth?  I guess the filmmakers thought just making something that resembled a jawbreaker would be too pedestrian...?And the first room - the Chocolate Room.  As another reviewer here has noted, the 'chocolate waterfall' isn't at all like what I'd imagined (based not only on the book, but having toured the Hershey factory as a kid and seeing the 'conching' pools).  Rather than thick, rich, creamy chocolate, Wonka's 'chocolate river' is more reminicent of, say, untreated water from a sewage plant.  (blegh!)The acid trip scene has already been picked apart and discussed so many times that all I'm going to say is it looks as though the producers/directors of this film were trying to cut corners by using stock film footage of decapitating chickens and what have you.  Easily the most tasteless and unnecessary scene in the film.The songs - insipid, uninspired, and most of them are just plain BAD, especially when you compare the Oompa-loompa verses in the book to the lyrics of the songs in the film.  (hopefully the new version coming out next year will use the words that Mr. Dahl used in his book.)  And the Oompa-Loompas - I hesitate to even mention them...just ridiculous and they don't seem to be 'living in happiness' at all.  Of course, in the film they're slave labor living captive in the Wonka factory...What was it about the 70's and kid's films anyway?  This would be suitable on a double bill with the 1969 version of ""Pippi Longstocking"" as both are badly made films purported to be made for children, based on beloved children's books, but turned out to be like train wrecks - you don't WANT to watch but their very badness just compels one to do so.",2,Train wreck of a movie...its popularity puzzles me...?,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,3924,"['watched', 'husband', 'who', 'reason', 'film', 'again', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHY', 'so', 'beloved', 'mean', 'film', 'Chitty', 'Chitty', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'based', 'film', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'almost', 'forgotten', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'as', 'far', 'entertainment', 'value', 'writing', 'etc', 'guess', 'must', 'be', 'fact', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'maybe', 'LSD', 'trip', 'scene', 'B-horror', 'movie', 'stock', 'footage', 'inserted', 'have', 'idea.I', 'actually', 'first', 'saw', 'initial', 'screen', 'release', 'back', 'early/mid', '70', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'so', 'course', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'What', 'disappointment', 'was', 'then', 'Now', 'just', 'distasteful', 'boring', 'shoddy', 'production', 'values', 'husband', 'FANTASY', 'never', 'did', 'read', 'book', 'Charlie', 'family', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'place', ""1960's/1970"", 'Charlie', 'mom', 'supporting', 'family', 'taking', 'washing', 'tub', 'way', 'wash', 'was', 'done', 'back', '19th', 'century', 'fact', 'Bucket', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', '19th', 'century', 'only', 'respite', 'Charlie', 'when', 'school', ""'modern"", 'times', 'book', 'Charlie', 'also', 'dad', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'toothpaste', 'factory', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'know', 'lot', 'Wonka', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'workers', 'who', 'lost', 'job', 'when', 'Wonka', 'closed', 'factory', 'brought', 'free', 'labor', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'most', 'likely', 'sending', 'town', 'unemployment', 'depression', 'Hmm.The', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'search', ""n't"", 'strike', 'funny', 'Slugworth', 'news', 'film', 'crews', 'were', 'always', 'scene', 'moment', 'tickets', 'were', 'found', 'Sounds', 'setup', 'think', 'Wonka', 'had', 'eye', 'Charlie', 'successor', 'getgo', 'mean', 'DID', 'live', 'same', 'town', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'contest', 'Think', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'made', 'sale', 'candy', 'worldwide', 'Wonka', 'probably', 'needed', 'extra', 'bucks', 'finance', 'crazy', 'schemes', 'such', 'sending', 'bar', 'chocolate', 'TV', 'speaking', 'inventions', 'Everlasting', 'Gobstoppers', 'person', 'could', 'suck', 'forever', 'how', 'heck', 'are', 'supposed', 'put', 'things', 'mouth', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'just', 'making', 'something', 'resembled', 'jawbreaker', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'pedestrian', 'first', 'room', 'Chocolate', 'Room', 'reviewer', 'here', 'noted', ""'chocolate"", 'waterfall', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'imagined', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'book', 'having', 'toured', 'Hershey', 'factory', 'kid', 'seeing', ""'conching"", 'pools', 'Rather', 'thick', 'rich', 'creamy', 'chocolate', 'Wonka', ""'chocolate"", 'river', 'more', 'reminicent', 'say', 'untreated', 'water', 'sewage', 'plant', 'blegh', 'acid', 'trip', 'scene', 'already', 'been', 'picked', 'apart', 'discussed', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'producers/directors', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'cut', 'corners', 'using', 'stock', 'film', 'footage', 'decapitating', 'chickens', 'what', 'have', 'Easily', 'most', 'tasteless', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'film.The', 'songs', 'insipid', 'uninspired', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'BAD', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'Oompa-loompa', 'verses', 'book', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'film', 'hopefully', 'new', 'version', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'year', 'will', 'use', 'words', 'Mr.', 'Dahl', 'used', 'book', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'hesitate', 'even', 'mention', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', ""'living"", 'happiness', 'course', 'film', ""'re"", 'slave', 'labor', 'living', 'captive', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'What', 'was', '70', 'kid', 'films', 'anyway', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'double', 'bill', '1969', 'version', 'Pippi', 'Longstocking', 'are', 'badly', 'made', 'films', 'purported', 'be', 'made', 'children', 'based', 'beloved', 'children', 'books', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'train', 'wrecks', 'do', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'watch', 'very', 'badness', 'just', 'compels', 'one', 'do', 'so']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

This film is a magnificent visual treat.  Set in a fantasy parallel universe of Dickensian poverty and Wellsian Sci-Fi the film still entertains today with it's psychedelic visuals, off-the-wall humor and rags-to-riches, American-dream-come-true story.  It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of the hunt for the Golden Tickets, the disappointment felt by Charlie, whose place on the lowest rung of the social ladder means that he is too poor to participate in the madness unless he forsakes the welfare of his own family living 4-in-a-bed in their shack in order to follow his own selfish dreams (a telling and timely indictment of modern day capitalism and the shallowness and selfishness of the modern American teenager), the miraculous healing of Charlie's grandfather by the Golden Ticket, and the empathy inspired in us for the characters is truly the sign of a great film.The futuristic machines and products dazzle, the freakish Oompah-Loompahs are as compelling today as ever (there seems to be a current resurgence of interest in little-people e.g. Elf, Bad Santa, Jackass to name but a few...) and it's hard to shake the feeling that The Chocolate Factory is everything that Disneyland should be but isn't.On a more somber note Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka sent shivers down my spine when I rewatched this. Our view of Wonka's character today is sadly tainted by child abuse scandals, and it's hard not to see something of Michael Jackson in the idea of the man who never grew up, who vigorously eschews and distrusts adult company and who plays dangerous mindgames with the children he lures into his playground.  Call me cynical or overly politically correct, but I just think that side of Wonka could be better dealt with in a new version, and hopefully dealt with differently.That said it still is a great movie for kids, scary in parts (e.g. The boat journey down the chocolate river into the tunnel) but ultimately a rewarding and moral story about the importance of being nice, selfless and earnest and the hope that one day maybe, just maybe, it could happen to you.  This is the savage, beating heart of the American Dream.

I criticize it on slightly different grounds: the story is fine, but this film falls very far short of the book (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl) upon which it is based. Somehow this cheap, watery waterfall of chocolate (not appetizing like the thick one in the book), midgets in brownface, subdued performance by the great Gene Wilder, and pedestrian special effects can't conjure the truly exciting magic that anyone who has read the book (PLEASE read the book) will know about. The story in a nutshell involves a poor boy who learns of a contest to find golden tickets in candy bars. Only five tickets exist, and these allow the lucky winner to go on a tour of Willy Wonka's famous candy factory, the most magical one in the world. Most of the winners are obnoxious brats who get their comeuppance through their own faults. I won't say what becomes of our hero, Charlie. This movie more or less sticks to the plot of the book, but it adds an extra villain, a rival candy-maker. The songs are mostly forgettable, though the Oompa Loompah song is pretty good. Those who complain that the film is ""scary"" are referring to a very odd scene in which Wonka takes kids on a boat ride that inexplicably turns into what can only be described as a nightmarish acid flashback; one wonders what the director was on. Is the overall story a good and engaging one? You bet it is, but the film version just doesn't cut it for me. The book was simply too good. You are cheating yourself if you watch the movie.

405519,A2MH0QDRZFWF2S,6304176287,Kenton Larsen,"[13, 16]","Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, according to director Mel Stuart in his book ""Pure Imagination,"" was bankrolled by Quaker Oats to provide children with ""quality"" entertainment, presumably as long as that quality entertainment sold its upcoming chocolate bar.Director Mel Stuart's film is, indeed, one of the best ""quality"" children's movies ever made, though it's so subversive at times, it's doubtful that this could be what Quaker Oats had in mind when it handed over the money.Don't get me wrong: the movie is a children's film in some of the usual senses of the term. There's an incredible chocolate factory that will have kids wishing they were there, and musical numbers entertain along the way as we learn valuable lessons about the dangers of greed, gluttony, and watching too much TV.But there it is, right in the middle of the film and directly out of left field, the scene that plays like a bad drug trip, in which Willy Wonka (who truly is played to perfection by the brilliantly deadpan Gene Wilder) captains a boat down the chocolate river and an array of multi-colored lights and random images flash on the walls as the boat goes faster...faster...faster...to the horror of everyone onboard. These images include a worm crawling across a person's face and a chicken coming into contact with the business end of a cleaver (no blood, but still...chocolates, anyone?). Then again, it's probably more effective then the ""Just Say No"" campaign ever was.If this sounds all too disturbing, it's debatable, and likely depends on the kid; the darker parts of the film are few and far between and all part of what makes this it so memorable and so unlike any other. Adults will love the sarcastic humor and most children will love the chocolate factory - scary boat ride and all.As for Mel Stuart's book, ""Pure Imagination:"" it's an interesting read with some behind-the-scenes pix and info - but to the die-hard fan it comes off as a little light on details and heavy on hardcover, the better to increase the price.By the way, Stuart says that Quaker Oats never did produce the chocolate bar tie-in it had intended; for some reason, it could never get the recipe right, which I guess makes it the first movie product tie-in that wasn't.",5,"The best, and most subversive, kids' film of all time",1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,2249,"['Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'according', 'director', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'book', 'Pure', 'Imagination', 'was', 'bankrolled', 'Quaker', 'Oats', 'provide', 'children', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'presumably', 'as', 'long', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'sold', 'upcoming', 'chocolate', 'bar.Director', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'film', 'indeed', 'one', 'best', 'quality', 'children', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'so', 'subversive', 'times', 'doubtful', 'could', 'be', 'what', 'Quaker', 'Oats', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'handed', 'over', 'money.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'children', 'film', 'usual', 'senses', 'term', 'incredible', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'will', 'have', 'kids', 'wishing', 'were', 'there', 'musical', 'numbers', 'entertain', 'way', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'dangers', 'greed', 'gluttony', 'watching', 'too', 'much', 'TV.But', 'right', 'middle', 'film', 'directly', 'left', 'field', 'scene', 'bad', 'drug', 'trip', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'who', 'truly', 'played', 'perfection', 'brilliantly', 'deadpan', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'boat', 'down', 'chocolate', 'river', 'array', 'multi-colored', 'lights', 'random', 'images', 'flash', 'walls', 'boat', 'faster', 'faster', 'faster', 'horror', 'everyone', 'onboard', 'images', 'include', 'worm', 'crawling', 'person', 'face', 'chicken', 'coming', 'contact', 'business', 'end', 'cleaver', 'blood', 'still', 'chocolates', 'anyone', 'Then', 'again', 'probably', 'more', 'effective', 'then', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'campaign', 'ever', 'too', 'disturbing', 'debatable', 'likely', 'depends', 'kid', 'darker', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'memorable', 'so', 'other', 'Adults', 'will', 'love', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'most', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'scary', 'boat', 'ride', 'all.As', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'book', 'Pure', 'Imagination', 'interesting', 'read', 'behind-the-scenes', 'pix', 'info', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'off', 'little', 'light', 'details', 'heavy', 'hardcover', 'better', 'increase', 'price.By', 'way', 'Stuart', 'Quaker', 'Oats', 'never', 'did', 'produce', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'tie-in', 'had', 'intended', 'reason', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'recipe', 'right', 'guess', 'first', 'movie', 'product', 'tie-in', 'was', ""n't""]",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405522,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6304176287,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 2]","The fantastic works of Roald Dahl present several amazing stories such as The Vicar of Nibbleswicke, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and James and the Giant Peach.  Many of his works have turned into films including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that received the film title Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.  This year many viewers will also be able to see Tim Burton's adaptation of Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and he should have no problem capturing the dark elements of Dahl's creations, since he has proven himself several times through directing fascinating and captivating fairy tales such as Big Fish (2003) and Edward Scissorhands (1990).  However, this review is not in regards to the upcoming film, but rather the first film about Willy Wonka.The version made by Mel Stuart in 1971 where Gene Wilder performs the role as Willy Wonka offers a fantasy journey through song and music while capturing the ominous atmosphere of Dahl's work.  The story focuses on Charlie (Peter Ostrum), a selfless and thoughtful kid, who would rather share the little he has than keep it for himself.  At home Charlie's mom works hard doing other people's laundry while taking care of his four bedridden grandparents including Grandpa Joe.  Besides attending school Charlie also has a job as a paperboy and he shares his meager income with his poor family members.  It is a hard life for him and his family, but they get by as their kindness to one another makes the hardships tolerable.In Charlie's home town there is a chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka.  People in the town are creating their own mysterious myths in regards to the chocolate factory, but one thing is for sure, these myths base on the fact that no one has ever seen anyone enter or exit the factory including Willy Wonka whose identity is still unknown.  However, it appears that Willy Wonka has decided that he will invite five strangers that get a golden ticket from a chocolate bar that they buy.  This seems like a brilliant marketing ploy, as the mystery around Wonka creates a frenzy for Wonka chocolate bars.The people of the world begin their quest for chocolate bars, as they desire the few available tickets that would lead them into the secrets of the Willy Wonka chocolate factory.  Five children find the tickets, as some of the children display some undesirable traits such as gluttony, sloth, greed, envy, and pride.  Even the names of the characters offer a hint towards what deadly sin they are leaning toward, as their name refers to the action that creates the unwanted train.  For example, for gluttony you have Gloop, Teevee (that should be read: TV) for sloth, and the more interesting Salt for greed as salt once was considered to have much value to all people.Ultimately, all of the five children with an accompanying family member get to meet Willy Wonka who brings them into the magical kingdom of his chocolate factory.  Through the journey the children's negative traits begin to show, and eventually take control of each child to which the audience gets to hear the wonderful Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do song.  Each time the audience hears the song a new lesson is taught in regards to good manners and what impact they can have on the persons life.  This song is truly a highlight of the film, as the Oompa Loompas characters sing and dance.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Facotry is a wonderful film for both children and grown-ups, as both can learn the lessons of a good upbringing.  The story becomes more intriguing through its colorful and fantasy-like mise-en-scene, which Mel Stuart cleverly captures in the well framed film.  Gene Wilder also provides an enigmatic performance with clownish moments that enhance the fun for all viewers.  Also, the script and musical elements push the story into a lighthearted, yet ingeniously thoughtful portrayal.  When it all comes to an end the audience will have laughed, felt suspense, and had something to ponder through the many lessons that the film offers.",4,Thoughtfully Amazing Fantasy Journey...,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,4010,"['fantastic', 'works', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'present', 'several', 'amazing', 'stories', 'such', 'Vicar', 'Nibbleswicke', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Many', 'works', 'have', 'turned', 'films', 'including', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'received', 'film', 'title', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'year', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'adaptation', 'Dahl', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'capturing', 'dark', 'elements', 'Dahl', 'creations', 'proven', 'several', 'times', 'directing', 'fascinating', 'captivating', 'fairy', 'tales', 'such', 'Big', 'Fish', '2003', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', '1990', 'However', 'review', 'not', 'regards', 'upcoming', 'film', 'rather', 'first', 'film', 'Willy', 'Wonka.The', 'version', 'made', 'Mel', 'Stuart', '1971', 'where', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'role', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'fantasy', 'journey', 'song', 'music', 'capturing', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'Dahl', 'work', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Peter', 'Ostrum', 'selfless', 'thoughtful', 'kid', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'share', 'little', 'keep', 'home', 'Charlie', 'mom', 'hard', 'doing', 'other', 'people', 'laundry', 'taking', 'care', 'four', 'bedridden', 'grandparents', 'including', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'attending', 'school', 'Charlie', 'also', 'job', 'paperboy', 'shares', 'meager', 'income', 'poor', 'family', 'members', 'hard', 'life', 'family', 'get', 'kindness', 'one', 'hardships', 'tolerable.In', 'Charlie', 'home', 'town', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'owned', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'People', 'town', 'are', 'creating', 'own', 'mysterious', 'myths', 'regards', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'myths', 'base', 'fact', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'anyone', 'enter', 'exit', 'factory', 'including', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'identity', 'still', 'unknown', 'However', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'decided', 'will', 'invite', 'five', 'strangers', 'get', 'golden', 'ticket', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'buy', 'brilliant', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'mystery', 'Wonka', 'frenzy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'bars.The', 'people', 'world', 'begin', 'quest', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'desire', 'few', 'available', 'tickets', 'would', 'lead', 'secrets', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'Five', 'children', 'find', 'tickets', 'children', 'display', 'undesirable', 'traits', 'such', 'gluttony', 'greed', 'envy', 'pride', 'Even', 'names', 'characters', 'offer', 'hint', 'what', 'deadly', 'sin', 'are', 'leaning', 'name', 'refers', 'action', 'unwanted', 'train', 'example', 'gluttony', 'have', 'Gloop', 'Teevee', 'should', 'be', 'read', 'TV', 'sloth', 'more', 'interesting', 'Salt', 'greed', 'salt', 'once', 'was', 'considered', 'have', 'much', 'value', 'people.Ultimately', 'five', 'children', 'accompanying', 'family', 'member', 'get', 'meet', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'who', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'journey', 'children', 'negative', 'traits', 'begin', 'show', 'eventually', 'take', 'control', 'child', 'audience', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'Doompa', 'Dee', 'Do', 'song', 'time', 'audience', 'song', 'new', 'lesson', 'taught', 'regards', 'good', 'manners', 'what', 'impact', 'can', 'have', 'persons', 'life', 'song', 'truly', 'highlight', 'film', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'characters', 'sing', 'dance.Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Facotry', 'wonderful', 'film', 'children', 'grown-ups', 'can', 'learn', 'lessons', 'good', 'upbringing', 'story', 'more', 'intriguing', 'colorful', 'fantasy-like', 'mise-en-scene', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'cleverly', 'well', 'framed', 'film', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'also', 'enigmatic', 'performance', 'clownish', 'moments', 'enhance', 'fun', 'viewers', 'Also', 'script', 'musical', 'elements', 'push', 'story', 'lighthearted', 'yet', 'ingeniously', 'thoughtful', 'portrayal', 'When', 'end', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'laughed', 'felt', 'suspense', 'had', 'something', 'ponder', 'many', 'lessons', 'film', 'offers']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

Unlike Tim Burton's darker version- Willy Wonka is cherrier with colorful characters and faces... Willy Wonka played by Gene Wilder is SUPERB he gives a delicious performance as the lonely candymaker...everything from his eye movements to his character's lines is Wonka ""I can hardly stand the excitement"" when Augustus is stuck in the pipe. He seems to hate children- yet want to like them. Making you feel like Wonka is a truly conflicted character such as he is in the book. In looks and manners Wilder IS Wonka. His ""Pure Imagination"" song is a song- that I wish the world would listen too... ""If you want to view paradise simply look around and view it... want to change the world... there's nothing too it"" is a true statement that echoes in the movie.Young Charlie is brillant and makes this movie what it is...With a great cast, colorful set, and classic catchy showtunes this movie is a delight for the senses and true treat for old an young.

Ross ""Kristy""","[2, 2]","With the upcoming Tim Burton remake soon to be released, watching the classic 1971 original, I can't help thinking that Johnny Depp has got his work cut out for him, stepping into Gene Wilder's intimidating shoes. This timeless gem of a movie tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a down-on-luck kid who buys a Wonka candy bar with a golden ticket inside that allows him entrance to the fantastical Wonka chocolate factory and the mysterious eccentric, Willy Wonka. Roald Dahl is an author many adults find unsettling. They abhor the idea of their children's elucidation of books in which the grown-ups are so consistently portrayed as stupid, malevolent, and out of touch with the really important things in life. His earlier work is a lot less unsympathetic, but the attitude is basically the same: most people are cruel idiots, and the exceptional few who are not are justified in doing what they like to the many who are. Not a pleasant point of view, but it makes for some remarkable stories, which place the eccentric characters above the ""normal"" ones. The film itself however is a real treat. And thankfully it retains it's magic regardless of age. Those who dismiss it as candy-colored fluff miss the point. This is pure escapism with two large helpings of multi-flavored fun. Just like Wonka says ""A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest of men'. After 20 odd years, this is still one of my all-time favorite movies. Arthur Ibbetson's wonderful cinematography captures the essence of Dahl's best book perfectly. And who could forget the amazing candy land visuals, the ultra- catchy oompa-loompa songs and brilliant storytelling magic?

When my friends ask me about the best films to show their children, I respond with the classics: ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Mac and Me"", ""D.A.R.Y.L."", ""Flight of the Navigator"", ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", ""The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again"" and ""Baby Geniuses"".  All are genuine classics with nothing subversive on their mind, except for fun, which is not subversive.  Inevitably, someone will ask about this film, to which I always reply, ""What?!  Are you kidding??!!""Somewhere along the line, it was decided that this was an ideal children's movie.  I'm not sure why; perhaps it was the presence of children and candy.  Perhaps the character of Willy Wonka reminded us of late Halloween nights munching on Wonka classics like Nerds, Pop Rocks, Gobstoppers and Almond Joys.  But any logical person viewing this film will see it as a cruel, mean-spirited, feature-length advertisement with nothing more on its mind than bumping off kids in progressively gruesome ways.If you're a parent, think twice before screening this film.  Think about what's more vital to show a kid: kids dying and eating lots of sweets (this movie), or robot children finding families that love them (as in ""D.A.R.Y.L."").

Not only was it makes ion the whim of a child and financed by oatmeal company but it survived the most important test of all - time. It has music, warmth and magic.The ensemble of children - including Charlie, was very well cast. The energy and enthusiasm of what their plight is made each one of them funny, obnoxious and charming. Their respective parents can be identified in your everyday life as `real' parents. Even the songs like `The Candy Man', `Cheer Up Charlie' and `I Want It Now' make you smile, cheer and sing along. Who could ever forget the Oompa Lumpa songs too?The sets were fantastic. Colorful and detailed is what everything on the set was made to be. From the moment the title role...to the blasting out of the Wonkavator at the end - you are left with a warm heart, good feelings and the extreme desire to eat chocolate. (Recently the movie `Chocolate' did that to me.) The costumes and location and sets were all timeless and the movie works well even 35 years later.The DVD extras include a clever menu that guides through the various scenes, languages and captions that this film was dubbed in. There is a `making of' documentary that was produced in the 70's and there is one produced last year (2001). They both are insightful and funny and complete with behind the scenes footage of the making of the very unique and detailed sequences that make the Magic of Willie Wonka so wonderful.I've saved the best comment for last. Mr. Gene Wilder is a genius. His acting and performance as Willie Wonka was one that I can even any other actor in history doing. He is so interesting and exciting and unpredictable that watching him makes you laugh, wonder and be amazed. His charm and talents also include my favorite song - Pure Imagination. Mr. Wilder has a very melodic and talent voice that sends shivers down your spine. He is got to be one of the best actors of our century and his Legacy that is Willie Wonka will be loved for generation to come.

Personally I always thought the candy store owner (while an excellent singer of &#34;The Candy-Man Can,&#34; a song you should know) was sort of a jerk to Charlie; when all the other kids are in there he is just throwing candy around like it is free, and then poor Charlie comes in and the owner's clearing his throat to make sure he gets paid. Not cool bro. Also, no one really likes the song &#34;Cheer Up Charlie&#34; (so don't feel like you are alone if you use that interlude to refill your drink or make the sandwich you forgot to make before the movie started). I realize it explains he is poor and unhappy, and that his mother inexplicably thinks they will be able to do something about that, but I sort of got that anyway.Two suggestions: (1) Pay close attention to everything the school teacher says, and (2) feel free to close your eyes during the stuff in the tunnel: you can still hear the song with your eyes closed and you can hear how traumatizing the images are from the reactions of the people in the boat.",5,Pure Imagination...and that stuff in the tunnel.,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1361,"['Gene', 'Wilder', 'incomparable', 'performance', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'everything', 'remember', 'childhood', 'will', 'later', 'are', 'still', 'child', 'are', 'looking', 'naughty', 'children', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'eccentric', 'recluses', 'employing', 'orange-faced', 'little-people', 'furious', 'hunt', 'golden', 'tickets', 'then', 'movie', 'Personally', 'always', 'thought', 'candy', 'store', 'owner', 'excellent', 'singer', '34', 'Candy-Man', 'Can', '34', 'song', 'should', 'know', 'was', 'sort', 'jerk', 'Charlie', 'when', 'other', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'throwing', 'candy', 'free', 'then', 'poor', 'Charlie', 'owner', 'clearing', 'throat', 'make', 'sure', 'paid', 'Not', 'cool', 'bro', 'Also', 'one', 'really', 'song', '34', 'Cheer', 'Up', 'Charlie', '34', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'alone', 'use', 'interlude', 'refill', 'drink', 'make', 'sandwich', 'forgot', 'make', 'movie', 'started', 'realize', 'poor', 'unhappy', 'mother', 'inexplicably', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'sort', 'got', 'anyway.Two', 'suggestions', '1', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'everything', 'school', 'teacher', '2', 'feel', 'free', 'close', 'eyes', 'stuff', 'tunnel', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'song', 'eyes', 'closed', 'can', 'hear', 'how', 'traumatizing', 'images', 'are', 'reactions', 'people', 'boat']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405558,A1BKMYEQ6BP5B5,6304176287,"Maria Beadnell ""gotlips""","[0, 3]","When I first saw this, I was a child who had just finished the book, and disliked the movie for being nothing like it. Well, I'm an adult now, and understand many movies can be excellent when they depart from the book. So my daughter and I saw it, on a big screen even. She loved it. Not me.First of all, as much as I love Gene Wilder, he never for a moment convinces me he's a crazy candy man. He's much too monotone, and too gentle in spirit, even as he lets children come to horrible ends. He should have used some of the energy expended in screaming at Charlie in the beginning in making us think he was the ball of wackiness that would have been necessary for that crazy, wonderful factory.They changed the 70s book depiction of the Oompa Loompas as pygmies (in the original book--illustrations since changed) for little people. It is painful to watch their attempts to dance (dwarfs being physically challenged and it was obvious).The plot changes make no sense. The scene wherein Grandpa Joe and Charlie decide to drink the fizzy lifting drink comes right after one child has met with some horrid fate, and Charlie being an obedient kid in the first place certainly wouldn't disobey after seeing Augustus sucked away or Veruca garbage chuted or whatever just happened.The producers couldn't let the dad be unable to support the family, so they killed him and had the mom do laundry. Laundry? In a tub? Like in the 50s? But the cars are from the 70s, so when does this take place?And--again, as an adult--where the heck does this take place? All the shopkeepers have English accents--OK, they are in England, notice the cobblestones. No, they can't be in England, they are using German coins, and the aerial view is of a German village. And two of the grandparents have German accents. But they can't be in Germany, Charlie and Wonka and Grandpa Joe and Mom and the newscasters have American accents.Some parts are wonderful! I have never seen a crew of child actors so excellent. Yes they are portraying nasty kids, but doing it beautifully. Every one of the kids is delivering the lines as if it really occurred to him or her just that instant. Of the adults, Jack Albertson is also excellent, even if the writing doesn't do the character justice.And the sets were colorful, crazy, believably weird.  But that didn't make up for a story that falls apart and an uninspired lead.That's the adult not liking it, though, and it wasn't made for me. My daughter, who'd never read the book, thought this movie was wonderful and read the book cover-to-cover afterwards in a day, not minding the differences.",3,"Not only is it not like the book, it doesn't work within itself",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2607,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'book', 'disliked', 'movie', 'being', 'nothing', 'Well', ""'m"", 'adult', 'now', 'understand', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'excellent', 'when', 'depart', 'book', 'daughter', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'even', 'loved', 'Not', 'me.First', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'never', 'moment', 'convinces', 'crazy', 'candy', 'man', 'much', 'too', 'monotone', 'too', 'gentle', 'spirit', 'even', 'children', 'come', 'horrible', 'ends', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'energy', 'expended', 'screaming', 'Charlie', 'beginning', 'making', 'think', 'was', 'ball', 'wackiness', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'crazy', 'wonderful', 'factory.They', 'changed', '70s', 'book', 'depiction', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'pygmies', 'original', 'book', 'illustrations', 'changed', 'little', 'people', 'painful', 'watch', 'attempts', 'dance', 'dwarfs', 'being', 'physically', 'challenged', 'was', 'obvious', '.The', 'plot', 'changes', 'make', 'sense', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'Charlie', 'decide', 'drink', 'fizzy', 'lifting', 'drink', 'right', 'one', 'child', 'met', 'horrid', 'fate', 'Charlie', 'being', 'obedient', 'kid', 'first', 'place', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'disobey', 'seeing', 'Augustus', 'sucked', 'away', 'Veruca', 'garbage', 'chuted', 'just', 'happened.The', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'let', 'dad', 'be', 'unable', 'support', 'family', 'killed', 'had', 'mom', 'do', 'laundry', 'Laundry', 'tub', '50s', 'cars', 'are', '70s', 'so', 'when', 'take', 'place', 'again', 'adult', 'where', 'heck', 'take', 'place', 'shopkeepers', 'have', 'English', 'accents', 'OK', 'are', 'England', 'notice', 'cobblestones', 'No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'England', 'are', 'using', 'German', 'coins', 'aerial', 'view', 'German', 'village', 'two', 'grandparents', 'have', 'German', 'accents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Germany', 'Charlie', 'Wonka', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'Mom', 'newscasters', 'have', 'American', 'accents.Some', 'parts', 'are', 'wonderful', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'crew', 'child', 'actors', 'so', 'excellent', 'are', 'portraying', 'nasty', 'kids', 'doing', 'beautifully', 'one', 'kids', 'delivering', 'lines', 'really', 'occurred', 'just', 'instant', 'adults', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'also', 'excellent', 'even', 'writing', ""n't"", 'do', 'character', 'justice.And', 'sets', 'were', 'colorful', 'crazy', 'believably', 'weird', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'story', 'apart', 'uninspired', 'lead.That', 'adult', 'not', 'liking', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'daughter', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'read', 'book', 'cover-to-cover', 'afterwards', 'day', 'not', 'minding', 'differences']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405567,A2VVIT14CE3KGA,6304176287,Mark Twain,"[2, 2]","Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has long been one of my all time favorites when it comes to children movies. The more I think about it, though, the more clear it becomes to think that this movie isn't only for the youngsters, but adults and teenagers alike. The humor that melts off of every single action and event, the zaniness of the story, the setting for which the film takes place in... all of it adds up to a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The book that this movie was based off of, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a favorite of mine, if not because Roald Dahl wrote it. That brings me to one of my biggest reasons why this movie was such a hit success: the man truly behind the story was not necessarily the director, but Dahl, who made up from scratch every nook and cranny you see. He also wrote the screenplay, as a matter of fact. From the almost loony Willy Wonka - - played perfectly by none other than the legendary Gene Wilder - - to the chocolate factory itself, it's hard not to take notice and admit that Mr. Dahl played an important role in the movies glory.So let's get down to the meat of the movie, shall we? The lead character of our story is a young boy by the name of Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Peter Ostrum) who lives in a lower-class neighborhood alongside his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) and several other ailing family members. Sweeping into town comes an announcement from behind the doors of a mysterious chocolate factory: five lucky children will have a chance to get a tour of the also mystical Willy Wonka's factory! The chase is on, and all chocolate factories from one end of the street to another are jam-packed of kids wanting to find the lucky golden ticket that holds the ""key"" to the tour. Before anyone knows what's happened, four kids have got their tickets. Sadly, all of them are spoiled rotten brats. This pattern changes when Charlie finds the final ticket, and he's ecstatic. Bringing along Grandpa Joe, Charlie embarks on the tour with high hopes. What he gets is more than a little unexpected, I'm sure.I can't help but take notice of the amazingly beautiful background that this film is saturated in. Yes, perhaps they are dated, but for a movie that was filmed in the early 1970's, the producers and what not did a superb job of making the whole ""fantasy candy land"" a reality, and I applaud them sincerely. I actually think it's better that this movie is so old, as it gives it a very surreal aura. I also cannot forget the acting! Throughout the movie I found myself honestly intrigued with every character that was thrown my way. Every actor made their persona as believable as possible, especially Gene Wilder who I have to tip my hat to. I first saw the man in Young Frankenstein, and he never ceases to surprise me with his unbelievable top-botch portrayal of zany characters. His job as Willy Wonka is no exception.Willy Wonka is a part of pop culture, it would seem. It's hard not to notice the effect that it's had on the States. Whether it's constant references to people turning into blueberries, the constant jokes about Oompa Loompa's, the memorable Marilyn Manson video where he imitates one of my favorite scenes in the movie... it all gives more reason to check this movie out. As I said before, this is a total family movie. Not just confined to the age-old ""child"" or ""adult"" categories, Willy Wonka crosses the border and becomes a classic that no one will forget any time soon. Check this one out now for good laughs, an intriguingly eccentric story and character line-up, and extraordinary acting to boot.",5,"Caramel. And Cherries. And Peanuts, oh my!

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 4]","In 1971, Mel Stuart directed a hilarious musical fantasy entitled &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, based upon the 1964 children's novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; written by Roald Dahl (1916-1990), who also wrote &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; in 1961.  The story is about a little boy named Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) who works as a paperboy to help his impoverished &amp; widowed mother (Diana Sowle) pay their expenses by working as a paperboy.  Living with Charlie and his mother are all four of his grandparents: Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson, 1907-1981), Grandma Georgina (Dora Altmann, 1881-1971), Grandpa George (Ernst Ziegler, 1895-1980) and Grandma Josephine (Franziska Liebing, 1900-2000); none of which have gotten out of bed for twenty years.  In the same town where Charlie lives is the famous chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder).  One day while Charlie is in school with his strange schoolteacher, Mr. Turkentine (David Battley, 1935-2003), a momentous announcement is made:  Willy Wonka has started a contest to win a lifetime supply of chocolate.  The entire world becomes crazed with finding the five hidden golden tickets that are hidden in five Wonka chocolate bars.  Only the bearer of a golden ticket will have the opportunity to enter the mysterious chocolate factory and obtain the lifetime supply of chocolate.  Various children from around the globe find the golden tickets, including Charlie to the amazement of his family.  The winning children, and their accompanying adults, enter the most fantastic place that any of them have ever seen; but none of them could have imagined what their actions could merit.  The other four children and their accompanying adults include the selfishly whiney Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Mr. Henry Salt (Roy Kinnear), the conceited Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mr. Sam Beauregarde (Leonard Stone), the television-addicted Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen), Mrs. Teevee (Nora 'Dodo' Denney), the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) and Mrs. Gloop (Ursula Reit).Memorable scenes in the film include children enjoying the delights of Bill the Candyman's (Aubrey Woods) candy store, Henry Salt's employees searching for a golden ticket, Willy Wonka's first appearance, the edible fantasy room, the invention room, the soda pop room, the golden geese room, the events in Willy Wonka's office and the amazing Wonka-vator.  Other memorable characters include Arthur Slugworth (G&uuml;nter Meisner, 1926-1994), The Tinker (Peter Capell, 1912-1986, newspaper-stand owner Mr. Jopeck (Werner Heyking) and the many Oompa Loompas played by several actors including George Claydon and Marcus Powell, who respectively played &quot;Strutter&quot; and &quot;Horseflesh&quot; in the 1981 film &quot;Time Bandits&quot;.  The film's very memorable songs were nominated for Best Original Music by the Academy Awards.  Each of the songs, along with with my ranking for each, are listed below:* &quot;The Candyman&quot; (5, performed by Aubrey Woods).* &quot;Cheer-up, Charlie (5, performed by Diane Sowle).* &quot;(I've Got a) Golden Ticket&quot; (5+, performed by Peter Ostrum &amp; Jack Albertson).* &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; (5++, performed by Gene Wilder).* &quot;Oompa Loompa&quot; (5, performed by the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;Wonderous Boat Ride&quot; (5+, performed by Gene Wilder)* &quot;Everlasting Gobstoppers/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (5, performed by the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;I Want It Now/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (5, performed by Julie Dawn Cole and the Oompa Loompas).* &quot;Wonkamobile, Wonkavision/Oompa Loompa&quot;, (4.5, performed by Gene Wilder and the Oompa Loompas).Overall, I rate the classic &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderful film that both children and adults alike can watch many times without becoming tiresome, and the film itself is by no means dated.  Both the dialog and plot were brilliantly executed and each of the many actors in the film did superb jobs in their roles, especially Gene Wilder.  If any producer attempted to film a remake of this film, I couldn't imagine anyone other than Gene Wilder in the role of Willy Wonka.",5,"If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view

While starting out a dreary film of life in the projects, the movie magically comes to live in full technicolor when we enter the magical land of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

First of all, Gene Wilder is genius in the role of Willy Wonka.  Hands down his most memorable performance (that isn't said lightly, either).  Wilder played the part as half madman, half petulant child.  Hysterical in places.  The songs are etched into the memory of two generations.  Lacking the perfection of todays FX wizardry, the overall production value was great at the time of its release.  Is Burton's version better?  Hmmmm.  No.  Closer to the book...yes, but not better.  Depp is classic as usual, but I felt a lot of the new movie was borrowed not from the book but from the Wilder version (even though Burton claimed not to be a fan of the original....sacreligious!).

Yes, its full frame, but I don't know why everyone is so upset about it. If you look on the back of the case of the DVD, it tells you that the movie was filmed in full frame, not widescreen. They had to change it for the theatrical release. You are not missing anything with this DVD, this is how the director intended it! The transfer is very crisp, especially the &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; room, it looks luscious with bright colors. The extras are great. Its a delight with the audio commentary, for the actors, thirty years later, enjoy making fun of each other as they watch the film for the first time ever together. They also tell how about how some of the effects were done. They are so funny, especially Julie Dawn Cole (whole played snobby Veruca Salt). The documentary is intesting to watch.

405595,A33TBHM3O9AY17,6304176287,No one of consequence,"[3, 5]","In an age where it's becoming increasingly difficult to find films that are truly kid-friendly, it's nice to be able to fall back on classic movies like this one.  I watched this over the weekend with my 8-year old son, who saw it for the first time (it was my third or fourth viewing).  He enjoyed it immensely, but I also didn't mind making a little diversion into the world of ""pure imagination"" for a while.For those poor few sheltered souls who have never seen the movie, it's all about young Charlie's dream to break free from his life of poverty in London and experience every kid's fantasy -- winning a tour of the world famous Willy Wonka chocolate factory to meet the mysterious Willy Wonka himself (played by Gene Wilder).  Oh, there's also the matter of a lifetime supply of chocolate.  Charlie is a character of pure, unselfish heart who never lets go of hope even in the face of overwhelming odds.  He stands in stark contrast to the greedy, self-centered children (and their parents) who join Charlie on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure, and who provide wonderful object lessons about how NOT to be.The story is replete with song, color and fantasy as Willy Wonka takes Charlie and the others on a great adventure through his chocolate factory.  Pure imagination is the order of the day, and strange wonders await behind every door.  Willy Wonka can be described as eccentric, to say the least, but his philosophy can be summed up in his simple statement -- ""We are the music makers; we are the dreamers of dreams.""  Gene Wilder does a marvelous job bringing this character vividly to life.If you've never seen this one, by all means do, and make sure your kids are with you.  It's more fun when the grown-up kids and the not-so-grown-up kids share the experience.

This review is simply the mechanics of this special edition set.It is very nice box set and well organized and put together. However, to keep all the items in place are these clear cheap thin plastic pieces which make the whole set look a little cheap. I rather have foam like material to keep the items where they belong. The discs are on the bottom in a candy bar looking cardboard foldout sleeve, so you must dig through all the other items to get to the movie.The box is colorful and fairly solid. It is slightly thicker than the Warner Brothers I am Legend special edition box set. When standing upright the top just slides off, but you need it to be on it's side or all the stuff will fall out. Really nothing of any use. I'll never use the smelly pencils or eraser. I wish the Blu-ray/DVD case was a steelbook or something a little stronger than cardboard. The golden ticket is cool and some of the other stuff is all right.I had the Willy Wonka & Chocolate Factory UK Blu-ray and I can honestly say this disc looks and sounds a lot better. It is probably the same as previous USA Blu versions, though to me it looks the best it ever has.Over-all it is a nice set to have if you are a big fan like me. Each box is labeled as to what limited number you are out of 100,000. This label is actually a silver sticker on the outer cover of the box set. I wish it was on the inside somewhere, but that is ok. If you are hesitant, maybe wait until the price drops a little. I can't see this item selling out or being hard to find as there are 100,000 of them and it's not the best set in the world.

The movie is based on the Roald Dahl book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""  Willy Wonka is an eccentric candy maker who initiates a contest offering a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate to five lucky winners who find a golden ticket in their Wonka bars.  One of them is Charlie Bucket, an impoverished, but good natured,  child who hopes for a better future for himself, his mother and his grandparents.  The other four winners are some of the nastiest, most obnoxious and brattiest children imaginable.  Augustus Gloop is an overeating glutton, Violet Beauregard is a gum chewing fanatic with no manners (picking her nose while talking about how disgusting spitting is), Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat who wants everything she sees and whines until she gets it and Mike Teavee is a television addict with a smart mouth.  One by one, they are eventually done in by their bad habits.  Augustus falls into the chocolate river after drinking from against Wonka's objections and is sucked into a pipe, Violet chews a piece of Wonka's ""meal gum,"" although Wonka warns her not to, and turns purple and blows up into a giant blueberry, Veruca goes on a tantrum when Wonka tells her she can't have one of his giant geese and she falls down a garbage chute and Mike wants to be on television so badly, he willingly gets zapped into the size of an insect by Wonka's TV camera.  Charlie, by being the respectable child that he is and by not compromising his integrity, not only completes the tour, he wins a prize beyond his wildest dreams.The parents make it obvious why their children are so impish.  When the children get into trouble at the factory, the parents blame Wonka instead of the kids' own bratty behavior.  From the moment they step into the factory, they're complaining and finding fault with everything Wonka does and they take things way too seriously (much like the critics of this film)!  I bet if the Oompa Loompas, with their wisdom, raised these little demons, they'd be much better.Don't miss this film.  It is not only a fun to watch diversion from reality, the messages are very timely and it makes you think about the good that still exists in this world.  The critics and nitpickers may not get it but anyone who watches with an open mind and doesn't take it too seriouly will.",5,Timeless classic!,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2562,"['Spoiler', 'following', 'watched', 'movie', 'TV', 'rhe', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'have', ""n't"", 'outgrown', 'wonderful', 'story', 'power', 'imagination', 'how', 'good', 'things', 'eventually', 'come', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'things', 'movie', 'based', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'eccentric', 'candy', 'maker', 'who', 'contest', 'offering', 'factory', 'tour', 'lifetime', 'supply', 'chocolate', 'five', 'lucky', 'winners', 'who', 'find', 'golden', 'ticket', 'Wonka', 'bars', 'One', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'impoverished', 'good', 'natured', 'child', 'who', 'better', 'future', 'mother', 'grandparents', 'other', 'four', 'winners', 'are', 'nastiest', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'brattiest', 'children', 'imaginable', 'Augustus', 'Gloop', 'overeating', 'glutton', 'Violet', 'Beauregard', 'gum', 'chewing', 'fanatic', 'manners', 'picking', 'nose', 'talking', 'how', 'disgusting', 'spitting', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'everything', 'whines', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'television', 'addict', 'smart', 'mouth', 'One', 'one', 'are', 'eventually', 'done', 'bad', 'habits', 'Augustus', 'chocolate', 'river', 'drinking', 'Wonka', 'objections', 'sucked', 'pipe', 'Violet', 'piece', 'Wonka', 'meal', 'gum', 'Wonka', 'not', 'purple', 'up', 'giant', 'blueberry', 'Veruca', 'tantrum', 'when', 'Wonka', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'giant', 'geese', 'down', 'garbage', 'chute', 'Mike', 'be', 'television', 'so', 'badly', 'willingly', 'zapped', 'size', 'insect', 'Wonka', 'TV', 'camera', 'Charlie', 'being', 'respectable', 'child', 'not', 'compromising', 'integrity', 'not', 'only', 'tour', 'prize', 'wildest', 'dreams.The', 'parents', 'make', 'obvious', 'why', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'impish', 'When', 'children', 'get', 'trouble', 'factory', 'parents', 'blame', 'Wonka', 'instead', 'kids', 'own', 'bratty', 'behavior', 'moment', 'step', 'factory', ""'re"", 'complaining', 'finding', 'fault', 'everything', 'Wonka', 'take', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'much', 'critics', 'film', 'bet', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'wisdom', 'raised', 'little', 'demons', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'better.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'watch', 'diversion', 'reality', 'messages', 'are', 'very', 'timely', 'think', 'good', 'still', 'world', 'critics', 'nitpickers', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'mind', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriouly', 'will']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

That is of course because it is good on binary levels; that of a beloved kid's movie and a sentimental disportment for adults. That is why it is not only endearing, but enduring.An entertaining mix of irony, camp and charm, it is made of the stuff that produces dreams in the young and a longing for insouciance for the old. Who could resist this fantasy world within the walls of that enigmatic candy factory where the wallpaper is edible and rivers flow with chocolate? Who could not hum along with the crafty music numbers (mega kudos to songwriters Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley)? And of course who could not love the homunculin Oompa Loompas?The child actors/actresses are great. They serve to provide a certain satisfaction to the audience because in truth there is a reticent schadenfreude in seeing bratty kids get a comeuppance or two. And not enough can be said about Gene Wilder. He is brilliant in this role that has a underlying Oscar Wilde wit to it.

Featuring Rahl Dahl's classic style of dark comedy, and mixing in a little dark chocholate, Willy Wonka delights from begining to end.The movie starts introducing the children, most of whom are gluttonous, vile creatures (they can be called nothing better), and their equally awful parents.  Charlie and his grandfather would be the one exception to this.  Charlie is the son of poor parents and enjoys the few things he has.  He could almost be viewed as a personification of youthful innocence.Willy Wonka, played brilliantly by Gene Wilder, decides to place five 'golden tickets' inside five of his candy bars, and each of the children gets one.  One of the girls has been horribly spoiled by her disgusting father, one is a fat brat, the other two are described slightly less, but one is basically a TV addict, and the other... Well, I can't remember anything except what happens to them in the factory.  Charlie one day runs into a man who gives him a candy bar with one of the golden tickets inside.  Soon Willy Wonka has drawn all the children and their parents into the magical world inside his factory, where anything is possible.The movie follows the book quite well (although the squirrels from the book were replaced by the very entertaining Umpa-Lumpas because they couldn't find a way have giant squirrels working in the factory).  Each of the horrid children find themselves getting what they deserve, not dying, but sent to the inner parts of the factory, such as the furnace (some of the Umpa-Lumpas go to rescue her).I myself don't care that much for the begining parts of the movie, but once Gene Wilder gets on the scene, the movie suddenly glows with his wacky light, and energy which he seems able to put in all his movies.If you're a fan of Gene Wilder, he won't disapoint you, if you're a fan of Rahl Dahl, the movie is wonderfully accurate to his vision, if you're a fan of candy, you'll see lots of it.

Let's Watch!So Mr. Wilder where ever you are (first thanks for all those wonderful performances that lightened our hearts) rest easy.  After having seen both Cindy (the aforementioned Granddaugher) is firmly in your corner and after having laughingly told this story many times to many of my peers I've been pleasantly surprised to hear it repeated many times in return.  To those kids who would die for that Golden Ticket you're the only one who can hand it out!!.  No offence to Mr. Depp who has turned in his share of wonderful performances as well.  But there can be no argument about who the toddlers love (except perhaps in Mr. Depp's house of course) as Willy Wonka.

For reasons that are now mysterious to me, I missed its theatrical release when I was nine despite being a huge fan of the book.  I think it best to blame my mother and move on.  Seeing it for the first time just recently I was delighted that the darkness inherent in the tone of the book was only slightly toned down  which is quite a feat considering how candy colourful the entire movie become once the children enter the factory.  The songs are harmless and, generally, throwaway but charming in their own quiet way and Gene Wilder makes a delightful Willy Wonka.

Miller ""drifter2k""","[18, 21]","Firstly, despite what one reviewer says, the widescreen edition is NOT simply the deceptively named 'full screen' version with the top and bottom chopped off (no, it's not a 'faked' widescreen) it was originally filmed 'open-matte' in a 1.33:1 ratio (same as a 4:3 television), a process which involves covering up (matting out) the top and bottom of the image for presentation in theatres to create a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. I do not like this method of filming as it gives widescreen movies an underserved bad name. The widescreen shape is what the director intended to be seen but ,alas, it does offer less visible image than the open matte version so can make one feel ripped off! However, that said, keep in mind that when movies filmed this way are seen 'full frame' the artistic composition of the shot is often lost and sometimes things that shouldn't be visible such as microphones are seen. Widescreen is easily the way to go if you want to see the most image on the vast majority of releases as 'open-matte' is really not all that common a format.I would not say 'buyer beware' just 'buyer be aware' that there are a myriad of formats. I would encourage anyone who isn't familiar about the different film formats to do a web search for the letterbox and widescreen advocacy page for an excellent visual description of the various formats and matting techniques used in films.Finally, this movie is a lot of fun and I recommend it to children and adults alike. Yes, the boat ride is kind of bizarre and perhaps could be a bit unsettling for some, but it's no more scary (in my opinion) than a lot of scenes in 'The Wizard Of Oz' such as the witches legs curling up after she gets crushed by Dorothy's house. Children can't be so sheltered from life so as to not see a bit of darkness at times. Also, the worm in the 'Willy Wonka' boat ride scene crawls across a living person's face not a dead person...you can see their eyes follow the movement of the worm. One more comment on the boat ride scene...despite what a reviewer said, the widescreen version DOES have violet picking her nose while saying ""spitting is such a dirty habbit"" - my copy certainly does anyhow.I would give it 4.5 stars if I could but will have to round it off at 5.p.s.

405632,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6304176287,RMurray847,"[11, 45]","First of all, I will not try to compare the Gene Wilder version with the book.  Never read the book, so have no preconceived notitions.  I was eight when the movie first came out, and actually went to see it.  Don't remember too much about the experience, except the film seemed ENDLESS and boring.About eight years ago, we rented it for our then 9 year old son.  Didn't make it to the end...boring.Saw it again last night on DVD.  Lovely transfer, decent sound, ridiculous movie.The best part of the film is the terrific performance by Gene Wilder.  His performance was, frankly, ahead of its time.  He's a loon.  At one moment sweet and open, the next frightening with his wide-eyed gaze, the next barely engaged in his surroundings.  He's snide and whispers some really droll insults under his breath.  Just the kind of thing ""heroes"" in kids movies didn't do back in 1971.  His performance makes the film bearable.Everything else is dreadful.  The sets are cheesy beyond belief.  The boat ride through the terrifying tunnel is total out of place (a centipede crawling over a person's slightly open mouth!!  What the..??!!??).  It feels like Luis Bunuel.  The songs are mostly totally forgettable, and even the ones we know (THE CANDYMAN CAN) are horrifically staged.The circumstances under which Charlie lives are not amusing or quirky.  My first thought upon seeing it just recently was ""He needs to be put into a foster family...NOW.)  He appears to be the only breadwinner, while his grandparents sit around in bed all day.  There's probably a good reason for it, but it's not explained.  I guess they're just ""quirky.""  Charlie uses his meager earnings to buy tobacco for Grandpa Joe.  Even in 1971, tobacco shouldn't have been so glorified.The famous OOPAH-LOOMPAS (who DO have a memorable little tune to provide us) are just creepy, in all the worst ways.  Their dancing is terrible and out of synch.The adult actors in the film all overact tremendously.  The young kids who play Charlie's fellow contest winners work really hard at being obnoxious...and they are!!  But there's no nuance to the roles...they just all kinda scream and throw fits and carry on.  Except Augustus, who is so busy stuffing his face you can't even understand his dialogue.  And Veruca Salt isn't just a greedy brat, she's a psychopath of the first order!I realize I'm sounding like a grinch.  The movie is beloved the world over.  Kids movies aren't supposed to be ""realistic.""  But I believe even a totally unrealistic scenario has to have its own reality that we can tune in to.  It's own set of rules.  This film is made so clumsily and unattractively that it's pretty hard to find a way into the world so that we can believe the outrageous characters.  Mostly, I just hate them.I know I'll take a lot ""not helpful"" hits for this, but I feel I must be honest.

The ""wonka kids"" are all grown up and have got together in one room for the first time since making the movie. The commentary track is fun and informative and well worth a listen.

405639,A22IF678HKJEO8,6304176287,Roy Kristiansen,"[1, 2]","It's mostly a matter of preference, relating to the type of screen that's in your home. We've been through this discussion so many times by now and I still can't come to a clear-cut, one-size-fits-all opinion. It's true that some films originally shot in 1.33:1 and then cropped for the theater DO look better in their full-screen version. I'm thinking of films like Koyaanisqatsi. However, in this case I've got to go with widescreen. There are any number of shots that are much more convincing without seeing the tops and bottoms of the sets - the first shot of Charlie's family, all stretched out in the same bed, gives you the visual joke straight off by emphasizing side-to-side, rather than vertical. Likewise, the Candy Room looks (to me, at least) less like a big clunky set on a studio soundstage by allowing you to imagine what's above it, rather than showing you that nothing is. This cropping of films for the ""widescreen"" theater is part of production planning right from the start (the cinematographer has a set of ""lines"" to look through so he can tell which part of the image is actually intended for the screen), and the 4X3 versions that make it to home video are mostly a concession to those folks who simply can't stand those black bars on their analog sets. I predict this will change as more widescreen sets make it into homes.One last note: the widescreen version of Airplane! is similarly cropped.

He is the perfect mix of sweet hearted Gentleman and screwball lunatic.Generally a heart warming film which spares you none of Dahl's trademark moralising.

405661,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6304176287,Silver Screen,"[2, 4]","""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is one of those rare films that bridges the child-adult film gap.  Persons of all ages can watch, eyes wide, and revel in Willy Wonka's eccentricities and Charlie's inate goodness and splendid luck.  The film, more than 30 years old, hardly feels its age.  Made in a time before computerized special effects, the relative cheese quotient only serves to make the film that much more charming.Gene Wilder is superbly cast as the unconvential confectioner, Willy Wonka, who is partial to brightly colored leisure suits, large hats and not averse to breaking into song when the moment requires it.  Rather than being simply odd and borderline unsettling as Johnny Depp would portray him three decades later, Wilder's Wonka is obviously an overgrown kid himself, a person who truly enjoys making candy and making people smile.  There is not a hint of any darkness hiding behind those dancing eyes.The children are all marvelously cast, each one befitting their character's physical description on Roald Dante's classic book.  Despite hating seeing them go, their individual come-uppances are rewarding and indulging.  The parents have very little to do, other than watch their respective children get into trouble, bemoan the fact and watch the Mystic-Tanned Oompa Loompas break into early karaoke about it.Watching this movie reminds me of what is so fun about being a child - - the innocence involved in believing that such a place as the Wonka Factory can exist, and the good kid (Charlie) comes out on top in the end, while the bad kids go home empty-handed and having learned their lesson.""Willy Wonka"" is good, clean fun for the whole family, with catchy lyrics provided by the Oompa Loompas to boot.

Both discs contain some good special features, including a commentary and documentary that reunites all five Wonka kids.

It's miles beyond the motion-sickness-inducing &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or the thighs-in-your-face &quot;Chicago&quot; and has the charm to delight even the least imaginative of us.  The beauty of the film is how well it balances adult cynicism with youthful hope--Dahl's satirical subtexts of European colonialism and slavery (as witnessed by the greed of just about everyone involved and the predicament of the Oopah Loompahs, respectively) are virtually indetectable for children wowed by the colorful production design and memorable songs.  So are the swipes against the Germans, common in British films.  But the core of the story revolves around Charlie Bucket, the poor but kind-hearted boy whose bleak life with his struggling single mother and invalid grandparents is punctuated only by the occasional ray of sunshine.  That he finds the last ticket to compete for a lifetime supply of chocolate is deserved; that he wins against a gaggle of spoiled, obnoxious children that represent the worst of humanity is inevitable.  Peter Ostrum and Jack Albertson are terrific as Charlie and Grandpa Joe, respectively, and Gene Wilder inhabits the wily but world-weary Wonka wonderfully.  Children (and some adults) sometimes becry the darkness of some scenes, as well as Wilder's often biting reactions to them, but they miss the point:  Wonka seeks genuine kindness and decency in a landscape populated mostly by avarice and deceit.  To find an heir that possesses such qualities, he must present both the beautiful and the ugly, and act both the benefactor and the villain.  It is only through witnessing their reactions--and the rotten kids are never put off by the horrible things they see and do--that he can discover which of them deserves to inherit his fortune.

The first appearance with somersault which is the Wilder's own idea, tells the Wilder's sense of humor quite well. Wonka is an old man in the book but Wilder was still in his 30s. Wilder wants to stress that the book and the film is different? Punishments of the naughty kids are done really well and its lesson can be seen a lot more clearly than the 2005 version. And what is impressive is that the invited children as well as adults truly enjoy the fantastic garden compensating for a bit poorly designed sets. Another factor making the storyline quite convincing is that even Charlie shares the mistakes by tasting the body-floating candies. The process by which the Charlie wins the factory is well described and quite impressive.Wilder's Wonka is by no means true to the original book but the appealing one for sure.Verdict: Compromise the sets and outdated F/X and you may feel like being one of the luckiest kids or their accomapanying adults.Rating: 88 out of 100Recommended for: Classic movies fans and fantasy novels fans.",4,"Well-Witted, and Well Performed",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1273,"['saw', 'film', 'seeing', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', '2005', 'really', 'enjoyed', '1971', 'version', 'starring', 'GENE', 'WILDER.Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'really', 'witty', 'performing', 'role', 'legendary', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'factory', 'owner', 'brilliantly', 'first', 'appearance', 'somersault', 'Wilder', 'own', 'idea', 'Wilder', 'sense', 'humor', 'quite', 'well', 'Wonka', 'old', 'man', 'book', 'Wilder', 'was', 'still', '30s', 'Wilder', 'stress', 'book', 'film', 'different', 'Punishments', 'naughty', 'kids', 'are', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'lesson', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'lot', 'more', 'clearly', '2005', 'version', 'what', 'impressive', 'invited', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'garden', 'compensating', 'bit', 'poorly', 'designed', 'sets', 'factor', 'making', 'storyline', 'quite', 'convincing', 'even', 'Charlie', 'shares', 'mistakes', 'tasting', 'body-floating', 'candies', 'process', 'Charlie', 'factory', 'well', 'described', 'quite', 'impressive.Wilder', 'Wonka', 'means', 'true', 'original', 'book', 'appealing', 'one', 'sure.Verdict', 'Compromise', 'sets', 'outdated', 'F/X', 'may', 'feel', 'being', 'one', 'luckiest', 'kids', 'accomapanying', 'adults.Rating', '88', '100Recommended', 'Classic', 'movies', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'fans']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

405686,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,6304176287,The Patriarch,"[1, 3]","Ahh...The good ol' days. The Patriarch remembers fondly the days of his youth when he was forced to watch this film in his local Thought-Control-and-Processing-Center to wit I mean public school.The first strikingly strange thing about this movie is the fact that it takes place in no specific time period. I mean, it was made in `71, it has 60s/70s and slang, modern automobiles, and yet Charlie's family lives like 19th century proletariat laborers. They live in a one room shack where all four grandparents live in a communal bed, the mom works in a sweat-shop laundry, and they all dress like chimney sweeps. It looks like they use the same sets and wardrobe from Oliver, which they probably did.If you're still awake after the somniferous credit sequence then you'll get to witness a frightening 1920s era candyman/soda jerk. These obviously no longer existed in the early seventies, so it only brings up more questions about the era this movie takes place in. The scary bachelor candyman now throws candy at the kids and gives them the run of the place. I fail to see how this will help his profits. He sings the children the first song of the film, the aptly-titled Candyman. Looking in the window in silent reproach is Charlie Bucket. (NOT pronounced `bouquet')Charlie always has this look on his face like he just watched his dog get hit by a truck and dragged down the street. Of course if you lived like Charlie, wouldn't you? An unusual glimmer of hope enters Charlie's life when eccentric, reclusive Candy maker Willy Wonka holds a contest to give five lucky winners a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Don't ask how much a lifetime supply of chocolate is, since chocolate is not needed to support human life it may very well be 0 bars of chocolate. The bigger question is just how winning this contest would help Charlie's miserable life get any better. It seems the logical course of action would be to sell the golden ticket to an eccentric millionaire.Wonka-fever grips the world, the first winner is a family of German stereotypes, the Gloops. The Gloops will eat anything including microphones!!! Oh well, when your country stages a failed world conquest it just goes with the territory. Winner #2 is rich heiress and spoiled brat Veruca Salt. Veruca's father has his whole plant ripping up Wonka bars in order to find the ticket. Just why he has a 1940s era sweatshop is a mystery. Winner #3 is Violet Beauregard and her father used car salesman Sam B. She's a plump loud mouth that is a self-proclaimed gum chewer. Meanwhile Charlie's mother has the nerve to sing this song, Cheer Up Charlie to him. Yeah, cheer up, Charlie, you've got a big bowl of cabbage-water coming to you when you get home. Winner #4 is Mike Teevee who, ironically enough, is obsessed with TV. He's watching a colour TV so I guess this movie takes place in the same time period as it was filmed, it's best just to ignore all the glaring anachronisms.Charlie opens a few Wonka bars only to have what little hope remained in his Pollyanna optimism crushed; but, a little sewer-grate picking scores Charlie an unidentifiable amount of money that he blows on more Wonka bars, even though the contest is supposedly over. Yeah, blow your money on candy Charlie, we don't mind eating cabbage water for another month. He picks up one just for Grandpa Joe, a good deed which is rewarded with the final golden ticket. The factory tour is, conveniently enough, held the next day. So Charlie and Grandpa Joe put on their Sunday best and head out to the factory where they are greeted by Wonka.Wonka is insane.His factory is a sadistic funhouse that is all one inside joke for Wonka's unhealthy amusement. Speaking of inside jokes, nearly everything he says is an inside joke, usually a quote from an obscure piece of literature. After a little psychological torture, Wonka lets them in to this open garden area where everything is `eatable.' Here we're introduced to the Oompa Loompas, an evil race of singing, know-it-all midgets. In this area we have our first causality, Augustus Gloop. He accidentally falls into the chocolate river and only Charlie tries to save him. Wonka is too concerned with the cleanliness of his chocolate river. He must not be too concerned as he sails a boat, the Wonkatania, through it in the next scene!Wonka takes them through a tunnel in the Wonkatania that can somehow emulate the effects of acid. Wonka has the boat go hundreds of miles per hour as he rants on like a madman, all for his own twisted amusement. In the next room Wonka throws a bunch of foreign objects into his candy vats, such as a pair of tennis shoes, a winter coat, and an alarm clock. Here Wonka introduces his chewing gum that tastes like a full course meal. While I don't find the idea of chewing gum that tastes like lamb gravy appetizing, to each his own. Violet, the gum chewer of the bunch takes a piece without permission and is turned into a blueberry. According to the Oompa Loompa's song, her only sin is gum chewing. Is that really that bad a thing?Now Wonka leads the remaining unsuspecting children to a room with geese that lay golden eggs. Veruca decides she has to have one. She's wanted everything she's seen so far, but she just HAS to have one of these. So much so that she goes into song in which she expounds upon her unfettered avarice. And uses some darn interesting words to do so.""I want a feast/I want a bean-feast(?)/Cream buns and donuts and fruitcake with no nuts So good you could go nuts/I want a ball/ I want a party/Pink macaroons and a million balloons And performing baboons(!?)/ and give it to me Now!/I want the world/I want the whole world/I want to lock it all up in my pocket it's my bar of chocolate/Give it to me now!/I want today/I want tomorrow/I want to wear them like braids in my hair(??) And I DON'T WANT TO SHARE THEM!!!*She struggles to regain her composureI want a party with roomfuls of laughter /10,000 tons of ice-cream/And if I don't get the things that I'm after/ I'm going to screeeeeaaaaam!!!""And with that she goes on a rampage mussing up Wonka's factory before finally falling down the garbage shoot. I think Veruca actually had the right idea. She's like Donald Trump only young, a girl, and with good hair. In a world of Paris Hiltons, here is an heiress that wants to make herself more rich instead of just having s e x with everybody and driving drunk. And can you imagine Veruca going on some silly photo-op journey to Africa to help the less fortunate? Of course not!As the movie draws closer to its end, I think now is a good time to contemplate the message of our dear fable...Do not cross Wonka! As a matter of fact if you ever encounter a man in a full length purple coat, top hat, and cane, run! Just run! What he's selling may look good on the outside, but on the inside the sweet candy is rotten and filled with all kinds of sickly critters.

(James and the Giant Peach was the other.) I had high expectations of the film when I saw it in a theater at the age of 12. I was rather disappointed for several reasons.The first flaw is that they changed it too much from the book. As an adult, I can understand using geese instead of squirrels because live geese were probable easier to deal with than live squirrels back before CG. But having Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink the bubbly against the rules is inexcusable. My best guess as to why is that self-indulgent, moral-relativist Hollywood types could not abide a child who would actually behave well all through a visit to a candy factory.The other thing that I really hated though was Gen Wilder's over-the-top screaming temper tantrum over the issue. It really stunned and traumatized me at the age of 11, having read the book at least ten times and knowing that Willy Wonka would never do such a thing.5 stars for production values, 1 star for the egregious intentional flaws = 3 stars overall.",3,I am of 2 Minds on This One...,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1137,"['hence', '3', 'stars.Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'favorite', 'books', 'single-digit', 'kid', 'back', 'late', ""'60s"", 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'was', 'other', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'age', '12', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'several', 'reasons.The', 'first', 'flaw', 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'book', 'adult', 'can', 'understand', 'using', 'geese', 'instead', 'squirrels', 'live', 'geese', 'were', 'probable', 'easier', 'deal', 'live', 'squirrels', 'back', 'CG', 'having', 'Charlie', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'drink', 'bubbly', 'rules', 'inexcusable', 'best', 'guess', 'why', 'self-indulgent', 'moral-relativist', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'could', 'not', 'abide', 'child', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'behave', 'well', 'visit', 'candy', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'hated', 'was', 'Gen', 'Wilder', 'over-the-top', 'screaming', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'issue', 'really', 'stunned', 'traumatized', 'age', '11', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'least', 'ten', 'times', 'knowing', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'thing.5', 'stars', 'production', 'values', '1', 'star', 'egregious', 'intentional', 'flaws', '=', '3', 'stars', 'overall']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

Well, I find it creepy and too modernized.THIS is THE Willy Wonka!  Gene Wilder is unbeatable as the quirky, engaging, singing, hermitic, clinically insane candymaker extraordinaire.  These oompa-loompas with their green hair, orange faces and clotheshanger-in-the-pants uniforms are the only way to go.  And the singing, the routines, it's fantastic!  I personally enjoy the colors and the 70's filming techniques used to make this movie.  Anyone who was a child in the last 30-some years had to have grown up singing ""oompa-loompa, doompa-de-doo, I've got another puzzle for you..."" and delighting in the sounds, sights, colors and over-the-top acting of all the brat children.Everything from the room that gets smaller at one end, to the boatride, even down to the moving-hand coathangers is bright and cheerful even when it's utterly terrifying.  And, there are no CG effects to spoil the atmosphere.  Face it, the CG in the newer movie is STILL not good enough to be convincing.  When you know they were just in front of a greenscreen, the movie is not the same.  This movie is authentically cool and nostalgically cheesy in some parts and all the more endearing because of it.  Willy Wonka belongs to the time of films when most everything was made by hand and children's films were - at heart - sweet, endearing, family-oriented affairs.  Some of my friends and I (we're in our 20's by the way) want to know what happened to such movies as ""Willy Wonka"", ""Hook"", and the wonderful, hand-drawn illustrations from films even as recently as ""The Little Mermaid"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"" - I grew up on these and am sad everything is so CG and driven by extraordinarily cheap, vulgar humor.  And what about fantastically done versions of classic books such as ""Black Beauty"" ""The Secret Garden"" and ""The Little Princess""?  I grew up on those as well and loved them dearly.  Or others, like ""The Sandlot"" and ""Angels in the Outfield"" - where are these movies today?  Why aren't these sorts being made still?Take my advice - classics like ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" are the kind of movies we need to keep showing our kids, and watching ourselves if only to be reminded what a truly classic children's movie ought to be.",5,Childhood Favorite for SURE,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,2404,"['Yeah', 'yeah', 'enormously', 'talented', 'amazingly', 'HOT', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'new', 'version', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'titled', 'CHARLIE', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Well', 'find', 'creepy', 'too', 'modernized.THIS', 'THE', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'unbeatable', 'quirky', 'engaging', 'singing', 'hermitic', 'clinically', 'insane', 'candymaker', 'extraordinaire', 'oompa-loompas', 'green', 'hair', 'orange', 'clotheshanger-in-the-pants', 'uniforms', 'are', 'only', 'way', 'go', 'singing', 'routines', 'fantastic', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'colors', '70', 'filming', 'techniques', 'used', 'make', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'was', 'child', 'last', '30-some', 'years', 'had', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'singing', 'oompa-loompa', 'doompa-de-doo', ""'ve"", 'got', 'puzzle', 'delighting', 'sounds', 'sights', 'colors', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'brat', 'children.Everything', 'room', 'smaller', 'one', 'end', 'boatride', 'even', 'down', 'moving-hand', 'coathangers', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'even', 'when', 'utterly', 'terrifying', 'are', 'CG', 'effects', 'spoil', 'atmosphere', 'Face', 'CG', 'newer', 'movie', 'STILL', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'When', 'know', 'were', 'just', 'front', 'greenscreen', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'movie', 'authentically', 'cool', 'nostalgically', 'cheesy', 'parts', 'more', 'endearing', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'time', 'films', 'when', 'most', 'everything', 'was', 'made', 'hand', 'children', 'films', 'were', 'heart', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'family-oriented', 'affairs', 'friends', ""'re"", '20', 'way', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'such', 'movies', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Hook', 'wonderful', 'hand-drawn', 'illustrations', 'films', 'even', 'as', 'recently', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Lion', 'King', 'Aladdin', 'grew', 'up', 'am', 'sad', 'everything', 'so', 'CG', 'driven', 'extraordinarily', 'cheap', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'what', 'fantastically', 'done', 'versions', 'classic', 'books', 'such', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Little', 'Princess', 'grew', 'up', 'well', 'loved', 'dearly', 'others', 'Sandlot', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'where', 'are', 'movies', 'today', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'sorts', 'being', 'made', 'still', 'Take', 'advice', 'classics', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'are', 'kind', 'movies', 'need', 'keep', 'showing', 'kids', 'watching', 'only', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'truly', 'classic', 'children', 'movie', 'ought', 'be']",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory VHS

It's why I liked it since I was a kid.  I never particularly cared about whether or not Violet or Verruca survived their ordeals; and in fact, I consider it a cop-out that Wonka had to reassure Charlie about the welfare of the other kids.  (But I guess it was necessary to preserve the character of Charlie as a genuinely caring person.)  The psychotic Chocolate River scene is probably my favorite in the movie.Some things I'd like to add.  I love how the film is set in a sort of no-place.  It's not England (Grandpa and Charlie are not English--nor are their families) but it's not America (Charlie's schoolteacher is English, but the students are not--Wonka isn't but the Candy vendor is).  It's set in contemporary no-place according to the cars, but life there is nothing like 1970s urban life.  There seems to be little crime, no bureaucracy (the only gov. worker is the local teacher) and no significant welfare state.  It's the bourgeoisie of the 1970s Anglosphere that never existed.  I love how Wonka is some kind of bizarre candy-making uber-mench who gets to decide the laws of physics in his candy universe and who is not accountable to any authority.  (The Oompah-Loompas are probably brainwashing the parents of the bad kids into confessing the murder of their own children as we speak.) Yet, I love how the film, in spite of all this, believes in truth and meaning.

405705,ASJ89T42CIUHU,6304176287,V. Marshall,"[2, 4]","&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was my favorite book as a child, this movie remains a favorite of mine even to this day.This film was made back in 1971 and is very simple in its style. The special effects are see-through and campy but the story line is a facinating metaphor for life that is forever timeless in its message. Willy Wonka is the creative genius who becomes a recluse in his chocolate factory because of society and its greed and malice. But he never loses his belief that someone in the world exists who can still believe in imagination and dreams. He finds this person in Charlie, a poor child who lives with his mother and four grandparents in a dirty basement home. Charlie has every reason to become dispirited and negative yet he remains a shining light of great positivity regardless of his circumstances. I suspect his attitude comes from the fact that his Grandfather Joe always supports his dreams, the boy never has to hear the word &quot;can't&quot;!The chocolate factory holds a contest and several children, including Charlie, get invited behind the doors with Willy Wonka. While on tour they are tested with fame, fortune, greed and honesty until one by one they succumb to the failure of a human heart. All except Charlie, who keeps a smile on his face and wonder in his eyes while being faced with the simple adversities that cause the other children to fail. Sadly I feel the parents are to blame creating children who thrive on material wealth, constant TV watching, gorging on food, and looking for constant attention. The parents of the children who fail refuse to believe in the dream of Willy Wonka surrounding the atomsphere with doubt and negative beliefs. How could anyone survive under such circumstances?The Chocolate Factory is filled with wonder, color and silly songs. Regardless of your age it will satisfy your sweet tooth and fill even a hardened heart. It certainly brings to life how parent's affect their children with their own actions and attitudes. Telling a child they &quot;can't&quot; accomplish all that they imagine only assists in stopping the world from greatness.

Some here have complained that the widescreen version is simply a matted version of a full screen print, and that the widescreen presentation chops off part of the image at the top and bottom. Well, according to my copy of the DVD, that is only half correct. I own the 25th Anniversary 1996 release of this film on DVD, which has both the widescreen and full screen version on one DVD. I compared numerous scenes in freeze-frame between the widescreen and full screen versions. In widescreen, sure enough, a bit of the top and bottom of the image seems to be cut off when compared to the full screen version. But I also noticed that when viewing the full screen version, an equal bit is missing from the left and right compared to the widescreen version. So no matter which version you watch, you aren't seeing &quot;everything&quot;. But which is proper? After comparing many images, I conclude that the widescreen version is what we are supposed to be seeing. Consider the beginning of chapter six. If you watch the widescreen version, you see a news anchor sitting at a desk. the bottom of the image is framed with his name plate on his desk, and the right side of the screen says &quot;Evening Report&quot; on the back wall. Watch the full screen version, and you will see a bit more blue background on the top, and more of the desk below the name plate on the bottom, but the right side of the image now reads, &quot;Eveni Repo&quot;! Folks, you ARE missing the left and right sides when viewing the full screen version, and from what I saw, the little bit of information that is missing from the top and bottom of the widescreen version generally was inconsequential. Every scene I watched and compared looked better composed when watching the widescreen presentation. Just FYI...",4,Widescreen ... fullscreen ... Guess what?

Sure, I had seen it almost 100 times, even on the big screen when it 1st came out (I was about 4 and terrified by the boat scene!).  I see this video is currently out of stock.  Hopefully, after this past weekend, there'll be more demand for a reissue!Gene Wilder does an excellent job as Willy Wonka, the candy-making genius.  At one moment, he's overly calm and cynical, and the next moment, he's roaring with emotion!  Peter Ostrum plays Charlie Bucket, the friendly, obedient little boy who can barely afford a Wonka bar, and Jack Albertson (Chico and the Man) plays Grandpa Joe, who tells Charlie stories about Willy Wonka's candy factory.  Against impossible odds, Charlie wins the last of the Golden Tickets (which entitles him and Grandpa Joe to a visit to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate).  Charlie is already warned about the evil Mr. Slugworth and resists his lures.  The other 4 children disobey Mr. Wonka and pay the consequences- in unusual and hilarious ways!  There's Augstus Gloop, a little glutton.  Then there's the spoiled, greedy Veruca Salt (there are few things in the world she doesn't want!).  Next, there's the boorish, gumchewing Violet Beauregard.  Finally, there's the junior couch potato Mike Tevee (who spends endless hours watching TV).  And let's not forget the Oompa Loompas who run the factory and sing jingles warning the audience not to get in trouble like Augustus, Violet, Veruca, and Mike.All in all, a cleverly done movie which isn't just for children and teaches lessons about obedience and humility.  Who can resist the candy-coated muchrooms, the fizzy-lift drinks, or the exploding candy to save for your enemies?

405720,AMMEMPM9MPS55,6304176287,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[5, 11]","This is a movie that every child born thirty to forty years ago will remember growing up with. A frequent objection bandied about by critics is that the movie makes no sense to children. On the contrary, I have found that the film's enchantment is almost universal (I have spoken to many who, like me, spent their childhood under Wonka's spell; I also don't recall speaking to a single person who didn't enjoy it). With that in mind, I find it hard to criticize; nevertheless, I'll make a noble attempt.The film has a few differences with the original book by Roald Dahl. The setting now appears to be America, rather than England (though it was filmed on location in an amusingly ill-disguised Bavaria). In the original book, Charlie had both mother and father; in the film his father is deceased before the story begins. This is not an arbitrary change, however. A thread that runs through the film is Charlie's need for a father (a male to fulfil his dreams and fantastical aspirations) and, just as importantly, Wonka's need for a son and heir. Here is an added dimension that builds nicely on Dahl's initial story.The film exhibits a few disturbing inconsistencies at the same time, however. One crucial blunder, that threatens to tear the narrative fabric apart at the seams, is the addition of a scene in which Charlie and Grandpa Joe explicitly disobey Wonka's instructions by tasting the fizzy-lifting drink, which has almost disastrous consequences for the pair. What, then, makes Charlie's actions qualitatively different to the other childrens'? When the entire plot hinges on Charlie's good character, next to the brazenly brattish and ignorant demeanour of his peers, this slip could easily prove fatal. It is not sufficient that Charlie is given the chance to redeem himself later on in the film, for this is an opportunity the other children simply did not have. It makes Charlie's subsequent dismay over the other children's behaviour ('Why don't they listen to Mr Wonka?' he asks his grandfather) a little incredulous. What saves it is the fact that most people will probably not notice this error, since the rest of the film is at pains to set Charlie apart from the other characters, so the incident is more likely to be taken as the result of misguided curiosity, rather than juvenile insolence or malice.Another error, with similar consequences for the story, is in the creation of a new character, Mr Wilson, an assistant to Mr Wonka. Though the character does play a significant part in the story, it is a role that would have been much better being fulfilled by some other plot device, since it is introduced only at great expense to the overall cohesion of the plot. In the creation of a world (Wonka's factory) unpolluted (ostensibly!) by greed, selfishness and worldly cynicism, ie. the influence of grown-ups, we have yet another central element on which the whole narrative hangs, thematically. The new character only serves as a badly-judged novelty that clashes woefully with the tenor of the rest of the picture. (The reason the character of Wonka is no hindrance, incidentally, is that his character is clearly neither child nor grown-up, per se, but belongs to the realm of fantasy, something which Wilson's character does not; indeed, if they had made Wilson's character more fantastical, it probably wouldn't have been convincing).There are a few other potentially worrying holes. For example, the aura of enchantment and magic surrounding the world of candy and chocolate, summed up in the rather hummable Candyman number (one of a few good songs; though there are also one or two real clangers), is offset by the fact that this is an enchantment and magic that only rich kids can afford. Charlie watches on enviously as those who can afford it taste of the delights of Wonka chocolate, whilst the Candyman ('He mixes [candy] with love and makes the world taste good') presumably passes Charlie by on account of his poverty. I won't go so far as to call this capitalist propaganda (!), but it is certainly an example of another glaring inconsistency.So, with all this in mind, what makes this such a great movie? It is imaginative and inventive. The production design certainly has a few technical flaws, but it is fun, original and captivating. The characters (from the mind of one of the 20th century's greatest storytellers) are pitched straight for the child in every one of us, regardless of age. It is funny and exciting, an involving fairytale that appeals to our sense of fantasy, curiosity and adventure. It is a minor classic that has become a part of generations of children and grown-ups. That tells me that, despite its flaws, it works. I heartily recommend it.
