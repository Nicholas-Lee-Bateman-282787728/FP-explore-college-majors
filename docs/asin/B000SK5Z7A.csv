When I saw the photo on The Gypsy Warriors I was intersted and read what little data that was offered... little information and no story line or teaser that told the fact that this was more or less a tv show expanded to a less than satisfying waste of time and money.  I would classify it as a C story and a C+ for acting.  It is one of those cases where: ""if you have never heard of the movie there is a good reason"". My one consolation is that the service to get it was good, and the price was less than going to the theater. Would I recommend it to a friend?
