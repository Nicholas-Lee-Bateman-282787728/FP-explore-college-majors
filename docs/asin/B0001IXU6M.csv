It is appropriately named. You would have to be on speed to watch this demonic monstrocity. The acting was not very good. The story was not well written. The climactic fight scene at the end was not very exciting. There was really no one to root for in this film. I received my copy on dvd yesterday. I watched it today. The garbage man will pick it up tomorrow.  I cannot wait to get this garbage out of my house. It is not worth renting; certainly not worth buying. It does not deserve one star, but tht is the minimum I can submit. Don't buy. Don't rent.  So much of this movie was pointless. Even though the director is gay, what was the point of all the guys going around shirtless? This same gay director made a great movie  with ""FINAL STAB"" and a good movie with ""LEECHES"". ""Shreiker"" was a decent movies as well. ""Voodoo Academy"" was pointless yet a decent story. The write up is the reason I bought this movie. Watching it is the reason I am throwing it away.",1,SHOULD ONLY BE WATCHED AT GUNPOINT,1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,1082,"['Final', 'Stab', 'Leeches', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'same', 'director', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'appropriately', 'named', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'speed', 'watch', 'demonic', 'monstrocity', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'climactic', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'root', 'film', 'received', 'copy', 'dvd', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'today', 'garbage', 'man', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'tomorrow', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'garbage', 'house', 'not', 'worth', 'renting', 'certainly', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'not', 'deserve', 'one', 'star', 'tht', 'minimum', 'can', 'submit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'So', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'pointless', 'Even', 'director', 'gay', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'guys', 'going', 'shirtless', 'same', 'gay', 'director', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'FINAL', 'STAB', 'good', 'movie', 'LEECHES', 'Shreiker', 'was', 'decent', 'movies', 'well', 'Voodoo', 'Academy', 'was', 'pointless', 'yet', 'decent', 'story', 'write', 'up', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'Watching', 'reason', 'am', 'throwing', 'away']",N/A

There's only three women in this film and they wear more clothes than the guys.  The dudes worship an engine block and they like to smear ""motor oil"" on each others chest while they play ring around the roses wearing nothing but jockeys and socks.

The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.

My suggestion is to quit prancing around with no shirts on and work on your car.  The cars in this movie were bone stock '70 Chevelle, '71 Charger (which didn't race and wouldn't have been much anyways since it was also stock), some eighties Camaro, 5.0 Mustang, and another '70 Chevelle that was black and suppose to be one bad machine, though it was cammed it lacked high compression and was obviously not a high performance machine.One race in the movie between a '70 Chevelle (the owner just tuned the Fuel Injection on it by the way) and a stock '85 or so Camaro, that was outfitted with Nitrous, and had the original skinny wheels.  Yawn.The gang in this movie wants the speed demon because they made their car as fast as they could and looking for the next rush.  They don't need a speed demon they need a Summit Racing catalog... and maybe a Barry Grant ""Demon"" carburetor...  The cars in this movie sucked.Don't rent this movie, avoid at all costs.  bad acting, script, etc, the whole thing.  If you're like me you wanted to watch it for the cars.  Don't, rather, drive down the freeway and look at the other cars driving alongside you, you'll get more excitement that way, seriously.If you really want to watch a car movie, try ""The Wraith,"" which was also bad but at least the cars in it resembled hot rods, or, better yet, try ""Two Lane Blacktop"" which begins with a '70 Dodge Daytona, Hemi Cuda, and a 55 Chevy street racing in the first 2 minutes of the movie, 100x more the action in all of ""Speed Demon.""Don't watch ""Speed Demon"" even if you get a kick out of bad acting and bad plots.

Jesse (the good guy) felt stiff and fake. In the beginning of the movie, his brother's car blows up while he is in it, and Jesse, while witnessing this, just looks on for several seconds, casually brushes his hair back, then finally starts screaming for his brother. Come on!Otto, the bad guy, was monotone throughout 99 percent of the movie! Even when he is angry, he keeps the same vocal tone, like when he started yelling at his girlfriend, Natalie. Show some emotion in your voice!And you wouldn't believe the death scenes! One guy gets run over by a car, but he just drops to the ground by the side of the car while it is driving past! It shows him in pain from being run over, but when the killer goes to retrieve him, there isn't any blood, bodily injury, or even tire marks on his body. AND YOU SEE THE GUY BREATHING!The plot was also terrible. Otto keeps on talking about racing and how he has his speed demon (a medallion with a demon head on it) to help him go faster to win races, and throughout the movie, he keeps boasting about how he's the fastest, but there is only the one race scene that Mike, Jesse's brother, races in before he dies, and the race looked terrible. The cars were going 30mph! And there are not any races after that. I'm not a big fan of car and racing movies, but after watching this, I'm starting to think that 'The Fast and the Furious' was a good movie!Do not watch this terrible movie.
