I know sequels are seldom as good as their source material, and thus I didn't really expect much from this one...Hoo-boy, did I underestimate.Take terrible acting (the only exception being the fantastic Christopher Lee, and seeing him in this movie was like watching Ali fight Holmes that last time...and even his skills could not add much to this schlok-fest), bad effects shots (that were re-used and re-used and re-used), ""werewolves"" that looked like rejects from ""Where the Wild Things Are"", a script that was obviously written on the fly, and a soundtrack song that was obviously the pride of the producers for the amount that you heard it, and you get....THIS.I've said before I like bad horror films, and I DO...and I'm certain that this movie will appeal to many...but for this to have ""Howling"" in the title AND feature an icon like Christopher Lee, I gotta admit, I expected a heck of a lot more from it. To me, the film seemed to start off seriously, but as it went on, it seemed that they almost intentionally fell into self-parody, culminating in the closing credits being a montage that would make ""Porky's"" blush (I'm of course referring to the footage of Miss Danning revealing her rather copious assets over and over and over and over again).If you want kitschy cheese in your horror flick, then maybe this one's a good, inexpensive choice for you...but if you're looking for something even close to the original, don't walk, RUN from this one.I give it two stars ONLY because of the presence of Christoper Lee.",2,Some might find a little treasure here; but one's treasure is the majority's trash in this case...,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1759,"['Friends', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'original', 'Howling', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'top', 'list', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'challenged', 'only', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'choice', 'best', 'know', 'sequels', 'are', 'seldom', 'as', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'one', 'Hoo-boy', 'did', 'underestimate.Take', 'terrible', 'acting', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'fantastic', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'Ali', 'fight', 'Holmes', 'last', 'time', 'even', 'skills', 'could', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'schlok-fest', 'bad', 'effects', 'shots', 'were', 're-used', 're-used', 're-used', 'werewolves', 'looked', 'rejects', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'script', 'was', 'obviously', 'written', 'fly', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'was', 'obviously', 'pride', 'producers', 'amount', 'heard', 'get', '.THIS.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'like', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'DO', ""'m"", 'certain', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'have', 'Howling', 'title', 'AND', 'feature', 'icon', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'expected', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'seemed', 'start', 'off', 'seriously', 'went', 'seemed', 'almost', 'intentionally', 'fell', 'self-parody', 'culminating', 'closing', 'credits', 'being', 'montage', 'would', 'make', 'Porky', 'blush', ""'m"", 'course', 'referring', 'footage', 'Miss', 'Danning', 'revealing', 'rather', 'copious', 'assets', 'over', 'again', '.If', 'want', 'kitschy', 'cheese', 'horror', 'flick', 'then', 'maybe', 'one', 'good', 'inexpensive', 'choice', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'even', 'close', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'RUN', 'one.I', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'ONLY', 'presence', 'Christoper', 'Lee']",N/A

Now, we all know that there are good-bad films (such as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"") and bad-bad films (unfortunately too many from which to choose).  These bad-bad films are akin to getting teeth pulled.  In fact, if I were given the choice of watching the entire ""Howling II"" or going to the dentist, I would pay to go to the dentist.  I must admit, however, that it's my own fault, for I had been warned by several sources (including Christopher Lee who stars in it!) that the film is pathetic.  But dunce that I am . . .The movie fails on all levels:  the plot is transparent, the gore unrealistic, the musical score corny, the sex unsexy, the editing incomprehensible, the sound muffled, and the film quality barrel-bottom.

Then supposedly her sister with the help of a guy she meets heads to Transylvania to root out the cause of her sister's trouble.

273436,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,630193296X,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[35, 36]","Wow...I can't remember the last time I saw where a sequel was so much worse than the film it followed...and that's definitely the case with Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf (1986), original titled Howling II: Striba - Werewolf B*tch.  One generally accepts sequels will almost never be as good as from whence it was spawned (i.e. the original), but there's a serious case of devolution here in terms of just about every aspect of this film, which was directed by Philippe Mora (Howling III: The Marsupials, Pterodactyl Woman from Beverly Hills), and features Reb `Captain America' Brown (The Sword and the Sorcerer, Yor, the Hunter from the Future), Annie McEnroe (True Stories, Beetle Juice), Sybil Danning, queen of the heaving cleavage (Malibu Express, Young Lady Chatterley II), whose ego is about the same size as her massive, chestal appendages (she was once quoted as saying, ""What I am is the new dream girl - one who has both body and intelligence.""), and Christopher Lee (The Curse of Frankenstein, Dracula), obviously during a low point in his extensive career.  Also appearing is Judd Omen (Red Dawn, Pee-wee's Big Adventure), and Marsha A. Hunt (Dracula A.D. 1972), who, with big lipped Brit rocker Mick Jagger, produced one of his seven offspring, that of Karis Jagger.The film starts out in L.A. during a funeral for Karen White, a main character from the first film, played by Dee Wallace (Ms. Wallace did not reprise her role for this film, probably due her having read the script).  Among those in attendance is Ben (Brown), brother to the recently deceased, Jenny (McEnroe), who apparently took over Karen's position as a reporter (this aspect was unclear), and Stefan Crosscoe (Lee), an investigator of the occult, among other things.  Stephen chooses this appropriate opportunity to inform Ben that his sister, was in fact, a hairy creature of the night, and orchestrated her own demise in an effort to stave off an existence which she thought too awful to bare.  Ben doesn't buy it, even after Stephen shows him a bootleg of Karen's last broadcast, the one featuring her transformation and subsequent death (the footage used is not from the original film, but a crummy re-enactment using other actors).  I have to admit, even thought I saw the original film, even I had a hard time buying off on Stephen's unconvincing claims...anyway, there's some nonsense about the werewolves wanting to retrieve Karen's body from the cemetery as they couldn't let it rest on consecrated ground, which leads to a skirmish, and results in a vengeful Ben and an inquisitive Jenny (ever the reporter) traveling with the mysterious Stephen to `the dark country', i.e. Transylvania to confront the queen mother of all werewolves, named Striba (Danning), prior to some sort of ceremony in which she'll become all powerful, or some such thing (another aspect never really developed).  The trio arrive in a small, European village populated by rejects from a David Lee Roth video, and soon discover they may be in over their collective heads as Stirba and her mangy mongrels have been busy creating an army of hairy minions, perhaps in an effort to become top of the food chain.Man, this Czechoslovakian production was just one big mish mash mess...the connection to the original film is highly suspect, the plot has gaping holes throughout and seems made up as they went along, the dialog truly insipid, and the acting just plain rotten to the core.  The biggest disappointment for me, in comparison to the original film, was the werewolves themselves.  In the original they were huge, menacing, frightening, vicious, slavering beasts who, if you encountered, would surely cause you to have a serious brown out in your shorts prior to their hacking you up into chunk sized bits.  Here, the werewolves are normal sized people with a lot of hair pasted on...and get a load of the transformations...how many times can one stretch a rubber mask before it breaks (quite a few, according to this film).  The special effects were altogether pathetic, probably due to a lack of funds after paying Christopher Lee's salary (the filmmakers often replay the same transformation effects over and over again).  Director Mora seems to try and tie things together as best he can, but it is a impossible chore as the plot is all over the place.  The dialog is particularly rancid, causing a terminal case of the cringe among viewers.  I think the intent was to infuse some comedy into the story, given the cartoonish transition wipes, but there was enough unintentional material available to preclude this effort.  The smartest thing the makers of this film did was to rope Lee into the cast, as he does bring along a good deal of class, but not nearly enough to elevate the movie out of the boggy morass to which it's firmly entrenched.  Too bad his character was about as effective as a lump of sod.  Reb Brown...his acting here is lame to say the least (watch how quickly he loses his character's western drawl), but I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the guy, ever since he appeared as Captain America in those TV movies of the late 70s.  He may not be a great actor, but he seems to know it, and accept it, rather than come off with a pretentious attitude like many do, including Ms. Danning.  I'm really unsure the point of Ms. McEnroe's character of Jenny in relation to the story, other than to provide a lame, romantic foil to Ben, but she was about the worst performer in this pile...thankfully her lines were kept to a minimum.  Of all the actors in this film, Ms. Danning seemed perfectly at home, playing a hairy, witchy, wolf queen, bringing out the twins on command, and strutting around in a really awkward looking leather outfit complete with reflective strips...and was she wearing blu-blockers?  Seriously, you really have to see her outfit to believe it...some scenes to watch for...Striba in a matted, hairy three-way with two of her minions (now I know why European women are so hairy...they all got a bit of the wolf in them...full body bikini waxes for everyone!)...the massive Bacchanalian orgee with all the wolfie brethren and sisters...a fake, dwarf head complete with exploding eyeballs...it's all here...along with lots and lots of boobage...if Ms. Danning and her titular twosome is your motivation for seeing this movie, you might just want to skip to the credits as they replay her dress popping/mammary revelation scene like twenty times, mixed in with some other footage from the film.  As far as I can tell, this is the uncut, 91-minute version, for what it's worth.  All in all, if you really liked the original and are expecting a decent continuation of the story (which really didn't need any sequels), stay away...if you're a not so discriminating viewer looking for some cheap thrills and lots of milk mounds, you've come to the right place.  Two stars for the film, plus one extra for Christopher Lee and Danning's ample flotation devices.The picture quality, presented in both widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, and fullscreen, looks very clean and sharp, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through very well.  There is a short theatrical trailer included, but that's it.  If you enjoyed this film, then you'd probably dig on the multitude of sequels that followed including Howling III: The Marsupials (1987), Howling IV: The Original Nightmare (1988), Howling V: The Rebirth (1989), Howling VI: The Freaks (1991), and Howling: New Moon Rising (1995) aka Howling VII: Mystery Woman.Cookieman108By the way, why did dum dum Jenny pack a string of garlic cloves in her suitcase prior to coming to Transylvania?

Only one slight problem when it comes to the whole ""rest in piece"" idea, according to occult investigator Christopher Lee: Karen isn't dead! Somebody slipped up and removed the silver bullets from Karen's body during the autopsy, meaning she's still a living, breathing werewolf. Sure, the whole idea seems fantastical to Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown), but you won't be surprised to hear of the eventual proof rising to the surface to change his mind. And that's just the tip of the fang! Did you know some werewolves are immune to silver, to where you have to resort to titanium stakes to the heart as a means of destroying our barber's worst nightmare? And that the queen of the werewolves (Sybil Danning) lives in Transylvania? At least it's familiar territory for Lee to hunt her down in... Those expecting something even romotely similar in style to the first Howling will be very disappointed. Some will flat out hate this movie altogether. Others will possibly find themselves preferring this one over its predecessor. I was somewhere in the middle, liking the faster pace, sex appeal, the often punk rock look and attitude, and some of the almost comic book feel (Brown and Lee did work together before in the TV made ""Captain America II"".

Horrible, brain-melting sequels.The first of these was ""Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolf,"" which is all the more tragic because it actually has some promise as a concept.... and it has Christopher Lee too. Lee turns out to be the only good thing in this messy, incoherent, disgusting mess of bad makeup and bizarre editing, which is scripted more like a vampire movie than a werewolf movie.Just after his sister's funeral, Ben White (Reb Brown) is approached by the mysterious Stefan Crosscoe (Lee), who informs him that his sister Karen was a werewolf. Of course, Ben doesn't believe him, but Stefan shows him and journalist Annie (Jenny (McEnroe) a videotape of Karen's on-air transformation... and later they see Karen's werewolf self trying to break out of a coffin.The two of them join Stefan's crusade against werewolves, and particularly against the evil werewolf queen Stirba. So they travel to Transylvania and soon discover that the place is crawling with evil werewolves, and even Stefan's expertise may not be enough to keep them from getting killed, especially when Annie (like all token annoying love interests) gets captured.""Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolf"" is not just a stinker of a sequel. It's a stinker of a sequel of EPIC PROPORTIONS, taking everything that was intense and powerful in the original ""Howling"" and turning it into a cheap B-movie with (from the look of it) about one-tenth of the budget, minus 95% of the plot, and with about twenty times the naked boobs.For one thing... ""Howling II"" is more like a vampire movie than a werewolf movie. Trips to Transylvania, heart-staking garlic and ""re-killing"" the undead werewolves. Also, werewolves worship the devil and have totally random orgies. Yeah.But even from a technical perspective the whole thing is dodgy. The editing is painfully choppy and often cuts to random shots of... crucifixes, skeletons and other stuff. There are countless weird, sometimes grotesque scenes that don't add anything to the plot, like a disgusting scene late in the movie where a priest is rather, um, graphically murdered by a gross little monster.And the special effects are comically bad. The werewolves look like hirsute humans with bad teeth, and are almost never seen attacking anyone (except for close-ups of a hairy glove or plastic fangs).So what is the ONLY good thing about this movie? Horror legend Christopher Lee, who overshadows the wooden Brown and forgettable McEnroe with his powerful presence, deep voice and air of authority. Sure there's a silly scene where Lee goes undercover at a rave club (wha?), but he also has the one spectacularly awesome scene in the entire film: he kills a werewolf with a holy hand grenade!""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" is a messy, sloppy sequel whose only good point is Christopher Lee.

273440,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,630193296X,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","THE HOWLING 2YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLFI still remember the first time I had seen the first Howling movie, and I was thinking ""wow this is a pretty good werewolf  movie"". I had no idea at the time that this series would take a completely new direction with every film that followed. When the sequel came out as much as I liked the first one I did not go to see this one at the theaters. Don't get me wrong if I would have at the chance and time to so, I probably would have done so. Before viewing this you would think it would surpass the original, just look at the facts. This is the follow up film to a very good predecessor, it actually follows in story line directly after the first, and it stars Christopher Lee. That is a pretty good case for the film, it should not only surpass the first film but it should be a classic. Unfortunately it never lives up to those expectations.I have never been one to condemn a film based on it not living up to expectations, and it is because of that this film is actually an entertaining 80's flick. The story begins with  Karen White's funeral where Stefan Crosscoe approaches her brother and his girl friend to tell them that his sister is a werewolf. From here we have a couple of werewolf kills and chills and we are off to Transylvania. And with no vampires in site we only have to worry about a town full of werewolves, sounds pretty good right. Well the problem lies within the performances of some of the actors. Christopher Lee [who took on the role only because he had never been in a werewolf movie] as usual is great as the werewolf hunter Stefan who is the brother of lead werewolf Stirba played by Sybil Danning [who is good in her role, and great to look at]. The aforementioned problems come from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, and Marsha A. Hunt, how for an 80's b horror movie definitely fit the bill but don't deliver great performances. All of the rest of the cast range from bad to good, which like before is perfect for this type of movie.Blame and or praise can equally go the people behind the camera. Director Philippe Mora who also made the next film in the series either is all to blame or did a good job. In my eyes I think he fell in between those two lines, you can tell he went into it trying to make an entertaining film. Also if you watch the next film you can tell he really does like what he does and if given the chance can make a good movie. Gary Brandner who not only wrote the book series but also co wrote this film could also be put up for blame along side fellow script writer Robert Sarno. I think that the story line was great and the setting was even better, what was wrong with the screenplay was the dialogue in my opinion. If this film would have had a little more time to develop and some characters cast a little better this could have been more like the original, maybe even better.If you [like me] like over the top b movies, bad acting, and even worse costumes for werewolves, this film is for you.

Also some of the special effects such as the magic lightning is phoney looking. These are just like any famous horror series like FRiday the 13th, etc. While meant to be scary they are now really quite laughable as they're dated from the 80s. I didn't laugh at it, but just don't take this too seriously. Sit back, turn out the lights, grab your favorite mind altering substance and enjoy.

273450,A30SEFSHDK5RX,630193296X,Matthew C. Lupoli,"[2, 3]","PLOT: The film begins in Los Angeles, right where the original left off. The funeral for Karen White is being held. Two of the people at her funeral are her brother Ben (Reb Brown) and her reporter friend Jenny Templeton (Annie McEnroe). Standing in the back of the church is a mysterious man (Christopher Lee). Afterwards, Karen's coffin is taken to the cemetery and placed inside a mausoleum. At the cemetery, Ben is confronted by the mysterious man who informs him that his sister is still alive. Ben, naturally upset, tells the man to get lost. The man leaves him his card and walks away. Jenny, overhearing the conversation, asks Ben if she could see the card. The card says, ""Stefan Crosscoe: Occult Investigator. As Stefan is leaving the cemetery, he sees two people who stick out from the rest of the mourners: an attractive black woman (Marsha A. Hunt) and an old man (Ferdinand Mayne). Stefan immediately recognizes them and they also recognize him. Jenny catches up to Stefan and asks him what he knows about Karen's death. He simply replies, ""I know that she is a werewolf,"" and walks away. The next day, Jenny convinces Ben to go with her to visit Stefan. Stefan's home is basically a museum of the macabre and the occult. Stefan shows Ben the kind of bullets which killed Karen. He says that they were removed during her autopsy and because of this she may never rest in peace. Ben notices that they are silver. Stefan informs him that Karen is a werewolf. Ben naturally thinks that Stefan is nuts. Stefan says that werewolves are secretly living among humans everywhere and that Karen discovered this; that's why she became a werewolf. He then plays the tape of Karen's final news broadcast, when she transformed into a werewolf and was shot. Ben thinks the tape is a fake but Jenny recognizes the people in the tape. Stefan then shows both of them pictures of the black woman from Karen's funeral. He identifies her as Mariana, an extremely powerful werewolf. Such werewolves are immune to silver; they can only be killed by titanium. The old man who was with her was her bodyguard, Erle. He then says that the queen of all werewolves is a woman named Stirba. The next full moon will mark the 10th millennium of her birth and at that moment, all werewolves everywhere will transform and take over the Earth. This event must be stopped. Ben gets upset and leaves. Later that night, he fears that Stefan may try to desecrate Karen's body, so he and Jenny go to the cemetery. Stefan is already in the mausoleum performing the last rites on Karen. Unbeknownst to all of them, werewolves are already hiding in the cemetery, waiting for an ambush. Ben and Jenny get attacked by one, but Ben shoots it with his rifle. The two run to the mausoleum and stop Stefan before he can drive a titanium stake through Karen's heart. Suddenly Karen awakes and transforms. Ben shoots her and kills her. Suddenly werewolves come running into the mausoleum and it's an all out shooting massacre. Once they're all dead, Erle (now in wolfen form) attacks Jenny. Ben shoots at him and they all chase him outside. Stefan tells Erle that if he doesn't tell him where Stirba is then he will let him suffer. Erle replies, ""The dark country."" Stefan drives the titanium stake through his heart and he dies peacefully. Stefan identifies the dark country as Transylvania, and that he must go there immediately. Ben and Jenny agree to go with him. Mariana beats them to the village of Vlkava (Romanian for ""the place where the wolves live"".) She is welcomed by Vlad (Judd Omen), the dominant male of the wolf den and Stirba's mate. He brings her to Stirba's castle. That night, a ritual begins at the castle. All of the werewolves (in human form) are chanting around an old hag of a woman; this is Stirba. Vlad comes in with a young girl and places her on a table. Blood is then poured on her. Stirba leans over and sucks out the essence of the young girl. When the light and smoke clears, the young girl is just a skeleton and Stirba looks up to reveal herself as a young, spectacular beauty (Sybil Danning). She removes her robe to show off her large endowments. The other werewolves howl in excitement. Stirba is then accompanied to her private chambers by Vlad and Mariana. She identifies Mariana as a huntress who will bear them many fierce sons and daughters. Mariana rips her clothes off and Stirba orders Vlad to mate with her. Stirba gets excited from watching and decides to rip off her clothes and join in. Stefan, Ben, and Jenny later make it to Vlkava. As soon as they get there they are attacked by two werewolves. Now they realize that they are all on a very dangerous mission.COMMENTS: This is the only other Howling film that has anything to do with the original Howling. It is sometimes called ""Howling II: Stirba, Werewolf Bitch"" in various parts of Europe. The screenplay was written by Robert Sarno and Gary Brandner, based on Brandner's novel ""Return Of The Howling"" (1979). It is a terrible adaptation of the novel though. The three main characters in the sequel novel were Karen, her husband Roy (called Bill in the movie), and Roy's werewolf lover Marsha. However, it's awfully hard to have a faithful adaptation of a sequel novel if the film version of the first novel kills off two of the main characters (Karen and Roy (Bill)). Sarno and Brandner obviously had to go in a different direction. This ""new"" story isn't that bad and quite original, however it's obvious to any horror fan that they borrowed a lot of lore from vampire legends. The makeup and special effects for this film are extremely cheesy and in no way resemble the genius makeup and special effects created by Rob Bottin in the original. In the original Howling, all of the werewolves looked the same (which they should.) In this film, they all look different. Some of them look like guys in rabid gorilla costumes, some resemble Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man makeup, and some have long wolf-like snouts. I wish that they all looked the same. Some of the werewolves are shown in-between transformations and are only half-formed: they have fangs, claws, pointed ears, and are covered in hair. They basically look like extras from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Cats."" One would also expect Stirba, since she is the werewolf queen, to transform into some sort of super bad-ass werewolf. Unfortunately she only changes into one of those half werewolves. One good thing about this film is that it continues the Howling franchise's legacy in introducing us to sexy female werewolves and Marsha A. Hunt as Mariana and Sybil Danning as Stirba are two fine additions. The original Howling introduced us to the first ""werewolf sex scene."" This film introduces us to the first ""werewolf threesome"" in the first half of the film and the first ""werewolf mass orgy"" in the second half of the film. Howling II is by no means a good film. Most people blame this on director Philippe Mora (who later directed Howling III: The Marsupials.) With an o.k. storyline, this film actually had the potential to be a great sequel. However, the producers and the editors screwed around with the final product a little bit too much and ultimately ruined it. The editors should be shot. They use a lot of the same scene clips and angles over and over again, and it's really obvious. Most of the film was filmed in Prague, Czechoslovakia (not Transylvania.) Elisabeth Brooks (who played Marsha in the first film) was also signed on to be a major character in this film, but she later pulled out of the film due to illness and salary negotiations; the Marsha character was ultimately cut out of the script altogether. Unfortunately, Mora couldn't obtain clips from the original Howling. He wanted to use the end footage of Karen White (Dee Wallace Stone) changing into a werewolf on live news. Original Howling director Joe Dante made Karen turn into a cute, Pekinese dog-like werewolf (since she was a good person at heart.) Mora ultimately had to refilm this scene using an actress who looked nothing like Dee Wallace Stone and she turned into an ugly/scary werewolf. The acting in this film is atrocious as well. The only thing that seems to be holding this film together is Christopher Lee's awesome horror acting and Sybil Danning's large endowments. Christopher Lee must have been really hard for cash when he agreed to film this. It's a film that he doesn't even like to talk about. I wouldn't recommend this film to most horror fans and even some werewolf fans. If you have your heart set on seeing a film as good as the original Howling, then stay as far away from this film as you can. However, if you are a horror or werewolf fan who can tolerate or even prefers cheesy `80s horror films then this is definitely a film that you'll like to see. It's so bad that it's hysterical. This new DVD has been remastered and it can be viewed in full screen or the original widescreen theatrical ratio. It also features the theatrical trailer, but that's it for extras; bummer.

273451,A2E9TRM8096BXU,630193296X,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[2, 2]","It is recorded that Sybil Danning ran weeping from the premiere of this film. Granted, it was because she discovered that the editor had repeated the scene where she rips her top off no less than thirteen times during the closing credits; but I can relate. This movie is so freaking bad that it may produce tears.To demonstrate how much THE HOWLING 2 sucks, I example the following scene. A werewolf in a Medieval helmet, holding an Uzi, is guarding a castle. The werewolf is attacked by a midget who uses Medieval weaponry and what looks like kung-fu to defeat it. Do I really need to say any more? Oh well, if you insist...THE HOWLING 2: YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF is a ""sequel"" to THE HOWLING the way HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH is a ""sequel"" to HALLOWEEN 2. In other words, it's not a sequel at all, it's merely a cynical and crass attempt to trade in on the name-recognition of the original. Yes, this movie has werewolves and yes, one of the characters is related to one of the characters in the first film, but there any similarity ends. The original HOWLING was a clever, witty, occasionally scary and highly stylish movie with a solid cast. This flick is like a bucket dipped into a cesspool.It opens in Los Angeles, which credits inform us is ""The City of Angels."" (Thanks for that.) Some punk-types are lured to a warehouse by a woman who turns out to be a werewolf, and slaughtered; this sequence is one of the most unintentionally hilarious I have ever seen in my life - the guys from ""Jackass"" don't hold a candle to these submoronic cretins. After they die, we cut to Ben (the immortal Reb Brown!!!), a shoot-first, ask-questions-never L.A. cop who is attending the funeral of his sister, who died at the end of the last HOWLING film. He is then approached by horror legend Christopher Lee (playing himself, essentially) and told that yes, there are werewolves and yes, his sister was one of them and yes, they all need to be greased posthaste. So he and his shrill-voiced annoying girlfriend go on a quest to Transylvania to hunt down the werewolf queen, played by Sybil Danning. (Now, I interrupt these proceedings to tell you the sole reason I originally watched this film at the age of twelve was because I heard Sybil Danning got naked in it, and yes, she does - thank God, or it would have no redeeming values at all). The rest of the movie features the heroes bumbling around Rumania while the werewolves prepare an unholy conclave in their castle. Is Ben going to get his revenge? Will the mystery around Christopher Lee's character be solved? Will the plot of the werewolves be frustrated by midgets, Medieval weaponry and kung fu? Do you give a @#&%? Of course you don't. Because almost everything about this film is soul-shatteringly horrible. The acting, the music, the direction, the writing, and most especially, the plot. (The producers couldn't even get the mythology right - at one point the heroine pulls out a fistful of garlic to ward off the werewolves. Garlic? Freaking GARLIC?) Many of the takes feel as if someone left a camera on while the actors were rehearsing, especially one close-up of Christopher Lee's exasperated face taken while some utterly inspid dialogue is being uttered by two others; Some of the scenes are pointless, such as watching Danning strut around to bad devil-worshipping music while dressed in a ridiculous (if hot) Ozzy Osbourne getup.  There are a few moments of clever editing, and a decent spot of violence or two, but really, the whole movie is such an appalling waste of time, money, and effort you have to wonder whether the people behind it were not werewolves or vampires, but zombies. I can clearly imagine rotting, brain-dead Romero-style corpses with crayons strapped to their decaying hands, going ""Muuhhhhh!"" as they write the script. I can see them shuffling and shambling about the set, moving the cameras themselves because they ate the production assistants. I can see them furrowing their mummified brows as they vainly try to understand why the film blows. And I can clearly see them invade the studio conference room where this movie was green-lit, looking hungrily for brains and finding only studio suits who thought a movie whose subtitle was YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF was a good idea.In closing, I'd like to add that when Christopher Lee met Joe Dante, the director of the original HOWLING, the first thing he did was apologize to the man for being in this movie.

273455,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,630193296X,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","The original Howling was a success of sorts among many fans starving for a rebirth of lycanthrope films. Joe Dante's now classic movie was dark, witty, tense, yet light and fun. Here...well, I have no idea in hell where they were heading. Nothing makes much sense, nothing's that fun, and it's more reminiscent of a cheap porn than anything else. Read the review (and watch the movie) at your own risk. Just be aware there may not be a cure waiting for you when you get back.The beginning alone tells us this will be a cheap flick. The only thing it has going for it impressive artwork and a pretty decent surrounding scenery, as in a few nice castle shots. Sadly this shows to be the most they could accomplish. It begins in a church at Karen White's funeral in California. A news reporter, Jenny,  is sent to investigate the killings - ""6 bodies found, coroner says marked with canine-like teeth."" An ominous older man ( a cult investigator. played by Chris Lee), is shown at the beginning, as well as Karen's brother, Ben. Lee's Character, Crosscoe, approaches Ben and informs him that his sister is now a werewolf and will awaken. Ben, angry, doesn't believe him at first but inevitably must face the truth.The recap of Karen's death was laughable. It would have been much less painful for them and the viewer if they just took the end footage from the original howling. When the brother says, ""It's fake"", boy he's not kidding! All of this werewolf chasing eventually leads them to Transylvania (!) Here the leader of the werewolves, a woman who loves to go around naked, Sirba, is going to have her birthday. For some reason or another this is big news in the werewolf world, and means that every werewolf 'will be revealed' when this day comes.In the meantime, a servant of Sirba's has come to the castle in Transylvania to warn everyone of the oncoming assassins. A young girl is doused in blood in the castle, and an old woman goes and literally sucks the life right out of her. You guessed right if you're thinking this turns out to be Sirba renewed. Following this we get a werewolf orgy that is out of place, doesn't need to be there, doesn't make sense, and isn't sensual in the least. From here on out it doesn't get much better; the only thing the plot does have going for it is the chuckles one can get from time to time, but even that isn't enough incentive to watch it.Vampire mix ups are prevalent. Besides the obvious Transylvania reference, Crosscoe warns Ben that his sister is 'now one of the undead.' The werewolves are also killed by Lee in the manner of staking them with silver. (?)Questions plead to be asked: How can Karen come back to life? Here they say it's titanium bullets that kill her, not silver, and apparently this is one big reason she is wanted so badly by Stirba. Guess when she was killed with a silver bullet in the first movie, it doesn't apply anymore now that its sequel time. Of course, she's never really seen after the beginning. (!) How is it she plays that important of a plot then?? Also, can they do NO buildup with any of the werewolf attacks??? They're completely ludicrous. And what is with certain things in the plot that are never seen again, such as blood from Christ? If this is included at all, shouldn't it be mentioned again at least once and be important in some way?The acting is less than mediocre. Sybil Danning seems to enjoy her part and have fun toying with it; Christopher Lee isn't at his best here and his delivery is wooden; everyone else isn't worth much researching or mentioning, they're just there to star in a bad movie. The lighting is supposed to be 'artistic', I suppose, but didn't deliver. The score is cheesy and 80s tacky, almost like a bad rock music video mix. The ending has some of the cheesiest effects in the world, and the movie is finished, with credits rolling, by showing Sirba rip off her shirt in slow motion (from an earlier scene) over TEN TIMES!Now, if this isn't enough to scare you off, I don't know what will.

Having liked the original Howling, and yet having read that this was an extremely so-bad-it's-good affair complete with werewolf orgies, an endlessly disrobing Sybil Danning and cheap and ridiculous special effects... all this and Christopher Lee too!

By the time we reach the climax (of the film, that is) and Christopher Lee ""battles"" Sybil Danning, I couldn't care less and kept wishing the whole thing to get over.... maybe I was falling asleep or something because I couldn't tell who was winning the battle since the whole thing was so ridiculous.Now... all I can say is, if you think all the things I wrote above are the type of ""cult item"" you want to own, then better know that all of what I mentioned sounds much better, written, than it looks onscreen.

After last weeks viewing of the original Howling we suppose the expectations were pretty high. With that said, we realized off the bat we were dealing with a film not even close to the same caliber of Wolfman action. But that never stops us and never will. At this point in the year our main focus is to pump out a lot of horror up until the Halloween season has passed. Even if we have to endure a handful of dull flicks. Not to mention this year we've made a dedication to watch as many Werewolf movies as possible, and we already know a lot of them are going to be horrible. This wasn't classified as horrible but was pretty lame and very very weird.Howling II very loosely picks up where the original left off. We open up attending the news anchorwoman's funeral where her bulky headed brother Ben is looking to exact revenge on the wolves that killed his sister. Yeah sounds like a great idea. Almost as good of an idea as when Santa spent 3 bills in the VIP room to get nothing in return. Ben and his lady friend trek into wolf country and come across an experience Werewolf hunter name Stefan. Wonder if you can find someone with that expertise on craigslist? Stefan and his silver dagger advise that they all team up and head to Transylvania on a mission to kill Stirba, the queen of the werewolves. There werewolves they come into contact with seriously look like a bunch of guys dressed up in ape costumes with plastic wolf heads. Yeah it was as awesome as it sounds. There was even a little wolf dwarf that gets his tiny a** tossed out of a third story window. Also as awesome as it sounds. Sid even had to rewind it about 5 times like the old days of Myers tossing the hicks off the flatbed of the pickup. Other then that we had some lame wolf action including some werewolf porn....which nobody should ever have to see.In the end we were left scratching our heads. Not that it was terrible but just needed more of a boost in the creature department. When one pictures a werewolf one hopes to find a huge vicious beat that nobody can stop. Not a bunch of normal guys in wolf costumes. However that does have it's charm in the laugh department. So it was B, but almost too stupid to even be really enjoyed. Outside of a few cool moments and some superior rack action there isn't much to be found here. Also the cover looks like David Bowie poking his fruity head through which left Sid confused. We thought maybe he had watched Alice Cooper in Monster Dog and thought oh I gotta get in on that.

On one hand, it was certainly creative, but I'm guessing that it was more along the lines of creative in the sense that either the writers or the director (or perhaps both) were on some major, major drugs. The storyline can't be saved by Christopher Lee, who gives it his all, but all for naught, unfortunately...I loved Howling. It's seriously one of the best werewolf movies around, even now. But this...Talk about disjointed. The storyline is craaazayy!!! I'm not going to get too deep into what it is, but it involves the second coming of Sybil Danning's werewolf queen character, either a priest or some sort of interloper -couldn't tell (Christopher Lee), the brother of Karen White (the reporter who became a werewolf in the previous film), the Transylvanian setting ---and don't forget the dwarf they threw in for good measure!The special effects aren't really special at all. It seems like they ran out of funds and banked on the soft porn and gorilla costumes to carry them through. Too many close-ups, like when someone is getting stabbed or the ""change"" happens, a knife being plunged in fills the frame or you can see a snout growing or claws popping out of a hand. You don't see the big picture, just snippets of change. And if we do, it's someone who looks like they rolled in lint with bad dentures in a half-transitional stage. It's really, really bad. There's also repeats of close-up changes reused throughout transition scenes that gets tiring.Another weird thing that I noticed was the Powerpoint-like use of transitional effects that are not only really bad but totally unnecessary.Not to say that there aren't any beautiful bodies in this (Sybil Dancing, for instance -too bad they put her in a bizarre leather outfit that looks like one of Grace Jones' seconds), but I didn't think that a werewolf movie would be so dependent on the kinky and bizarre to fill in for the weak storyline and meandering plot. There's a repetitive display of breasts throughout the movie, and loads of lesbian/orgy/werewolf sex. Definitely not a family film.The end credits are a bizarre montage of footage, mostly a clip of Danning ripping her top off that repeats around a dozen or so times.That said, I don't want to really say that it's awful, per se, it's just so bad that it's good in a way.

273466,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,630193296X,The Whatever Dude,"[6, 6]","Apparently, there was something much worse than Hard Rock Zombies, which thanks to this, is now #3 on my worst movies list (It used to be #1 btw. Howling 4 is still the second worse. Read my review on that for more details.) And like I said in my Howling 4 review, just because that was awful didn't mean I would be put off from finishing off the series, but now that I've stumbled upon this abomination, I'm becoming more reluctant. Remember back in the 80s when VHS covers where awesome and imaginative? Yeah. Howling II had a very awesome cover for when it was first released on home video in the 1980s, and to be truthful, for 8 years, I had been wanting to see this movie, especially since the movie's theme song got stuck in my head. Then in 2005, it finally came out on DVD, uncut (The original VHS was cut, from what I understand.) Unfortunately, I was treated to a really crappy cover which slightly mocked the cover of the original and 3 years later, as a well as a very crappy movie. Now that I got that off my mind, let's move onto the movie.The movie revolves around Ben Brown (The brother of Karen from the first Howling. In this one, there's no Dee Wallace Stone, but some extra playing Karen) who's approached by a werewolf hunter, Stefan Crosscoe (Played by the great Christopher Lee, who must have needed the $$$$$), who claims that Karen has in fact, become a werewolf. So then, Ben, Jenny (His Girlfriend, who has the have the 2nd worst acting in this) and Stefan go to Transylvania, where Striba, The Werewolf Queen (Played by Sybil Danning. Okay, I like Sybil Danning, but her acting was horrible in this. The acting she did in those old Adventure Video Segments in the 80s were better than this, and in those, she intentionally acted poorly) resides. And I will also say that I defintely agree with HorrorMan. There were some extremly sick moments in the film, like, obviously, the werewolf sex scenes, the worst of them being this one scene with Sybil in the middle between these 2 other werewolves, apparently trying to kiss each other, yechh. And not only is it sick, it's also pretty ridiculous as well. And a very stupid part in the movie was the midget with the exploding eyes. The movie is also pretty boring, as the film's main song plays over and over and over.Overall, the film is just simply abominable. I also agree with HorrorMan on the factor that it's hard to believe that people could get away with calling this a horror movie, or god forbid, a comedy, as it ain't scary, and it's certainly not funny either. Other people seem to see this as a so-bad-it's-good-film, and that's perfectly fine. I'm pretty much the kind of guy to enjoy a so-bad-it's-good-film, but in the case of Howling II, this movie is so abominable, not even MST3K or RiffTrax would make this movie any better. The biggest WTF moment in this movie had to be the ending. And the worse part, like I previously stated in the Comments Section for HorrorMan's review of this ""movie"", I paid only $3 for this at BigLots...and that's all it's worth. Avoid this movie like the plague, and like Howling IV, I wish I could give this a zero, but it's not a valid rating on either Amazon or IMDB, so a 1 will have to do. It'll probably go to Half Price Books soon.Feel free to comment, and Happy Halloween.",1,The Worst Movie Ever.

Let me put it this way, every Friday the 13th sequel is a masterpiece compared to &#34;Howling II.&#34; What's that tell ya?Still, there are a number of things that make this a worthwhile bad movie, like the priceless title (&#34;Your Sister is a Werewolf&#34;),Christopher Lee trying to keep a straight face, Sybil Danning hamming it up as the sexy werewolf queen in various eccentric outfits, the memorable theme song by Stephen Parsons (including a live lip-syncing), and the Los Angeles/Czech Republic cinematographic (featuring lots of Gothic props, buildings and the like).The film was directed by Philippe Mora who also did the next sequel &#34;The Marsupials: The Howling III,&#34; which is slightly better, but not as memorable or entertaining. As far as I know, &#34;Communion&#34; (1989) is Mora's only real notable film, but then I haven't seen most of his movies and don't recognize the ones in his discography either.The film runs 91 minutes (too long).GRADE: D+ or C- (but C+ or B- for entertainment value)",2,The greatest bad movie of all time?,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,1635,"['somewhere', 'top', 'ten', 'opinion', '1965', '34', 'Village', 'Giants', '34', 'top', 'prize', 'mainly', 'entertaining', 'different', 'levels', 'beginning', 'end', '34', 'Howling', 'II', '34', 'also', 'entertaining', 'multiple', 'levels', 'often', 'just', 'dull', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'top', 'spot.First', 'things', 'first', '34', 'Howling', 'II', '34', '1985', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'spoken', 'same', 'breath', 'original', '1981', '34', 'Howling', '34', 'film', 'werewolf', 'classic', 'one', 'greatest', 'werewolf', 'films', 'ever', '34', 'Howling', 'II', '34', 'just', 'too', 'low-budget', 'low-grade', 'campy', 'compare', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'Friday', '13th', 'sequel', 'masterpiece', 'compared', '34', 'Howling', 'II.', '34', 'What', 'tell', 'ya', 'Still', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'bad', 'movie', 'priceless', 'title', '34', 'Sister', 'Werewolf', '34', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'trying', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'Sybil', 'Danning', 'hamming', 'up', 'sexy', 'werewolf', 'queen', 'various', 'eccentric', 'outfits', 'memorable', 'theme', 'song', 'Stephen', 'Parsons', 'including', 'live', 'lip-syncing', 'Los', 'Angeles/Czech', 'Republic', 'cinematographic', 'featuring', 'lots', 'Gothic', 'props', 'buildings', 'like', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Philippe', 'Mora', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'next', 'sequel', '34', 'Marsupials', 'Howling', 'III', '34', 'slightly', 'better', 'not', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'As', 'far', 'know', '34', 'Communion', '34', '1989', 'Mora', 'only', 'real', 'notable', 'film', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'ones', 'discography', 'either.The', 'film', '91', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', '.GRADE', 'D+', 'C-', 'C+', 'B-', 'entertainment', 'value']",N/A
