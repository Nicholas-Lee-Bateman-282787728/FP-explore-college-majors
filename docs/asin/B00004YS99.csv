Their current anniversary is marred with betrayal and a violent intrusion as the stranger, Silk, (Mekhi Phifer)unloads his fury on the confused pair.

Finally, after several plot twists we discover that Silk is not the only &quot;bad guy&quot;.  The story goes deeper as does the betrayal, leaving us to wonder who is the &quot;good guy&quot;?

560309,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B00004YS99,Ibochild,"[0, 0]","A big winner at both the 1999 Urbanworld and Acapulco Black film festivals, Uninvited Guest (a/k/a An Invited Guest) was released theatrically the following year.  Despite the accolades and the fact that the film is arguably better than the somewhat  similar cult hit, TROIS, the film was a relative failure during it's limited theatrical run.  It made just over $100,000 at the box office (compared to the over $1,000,000 that TROIS made).Judged on its own terms, there is nothing particularly noteworthy about UNINVITED GUEST except for the fact that all of  the characters in it are black.  The &quot;erotic thriller&quot; starts decent enough with Mekhi Phifer invading into the home of an  affluent couple (played by Mel Jackson and Mari Morrow).  From there the story travels a fairly predictable path of terror.  Although not particularly &quot;erotic&quot; or &quot;thrilling,&quot; the director does manage to generate some sexual heat on the screen.  However, the sex rarely goes beyond that found in your typical daytime soap.  The film however does have an attractive cast and possesses a certain camp appeal.In terms of plot, there are plenty of twists and turns, but the story is hampered by a very illogical conclusion.  Without  revealing the details, at the denouement the viewer is left shaking one's head in disbelief.  The film also lacks a clear moral center or genuinely sympathetic characters.Overall, UNINVITED GUEST is a decent &quot;midnight&quot; movie.  If you're not expecting high art or even edge of your seat thrills, this movie is definitely worth a look.  You might even get a few laughs in the process.

But this product by Tri-Mark Pictures is something else!I knew it was a cheap piece and that Tri Mark didn't care much about their product when I opened the DVD case and there wasn't even a chapter page.  Okay.When the movie started, I started seeing English subtitles.  Hah!  I tried to turn them off, but you can't.  So, you have a choice of English, French, or Spanish mandatory subtitles.  Visually it's annoying because sometimes the characters are framed low so the words go right over their faces and lips.  Perhaps Tri Mark thinks that most viewers won't understand middle class African Americans talking; thus, the need for the mandatory subtitles.Actually, sometimes I needed them because of actor mumbling or audio that isn't really clear.I'm not faulting the film at all, but to put out a cheap DVD like this is really outrageous.  When reviewing a DVD I'm more concerned about quality, picture, and sound rather than the content.  I guess if you wanted to, you could just turn the sound down and watch it silent.

560319,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B00004YS99,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[12, 14]","Okay, I read the first few reviews and I must straighten up a couple of things.#1  There was no interracial sex going on, so I don't know what that reviewer was talking about.#2  The subtitles can be turned off. I turned them off two seconds after the movie started.  You have to click on ""English"" twice as though you're actually turning it on, but it works.Now onto the movie: Originally I thought this movie was absolutely stupid and predictable.  A woman being so free to roam her home with a stranger while her husband is more concerned with his script is highly unlikely. Being thrown into a jacuzzi and not experiencing the heat is all but impossible.  A black man letting another black man into his home and not watching him the whole time or asking to see his car that supposedly has problems is flat-out not going to happen.  A friend going to another friend's house, being asked to leave, being so indignant about leaving, and then not having any plans to interrupt why she wanted her to leave seems really far-fetched.  Why someone would have a gun in one hand and use the other one to fight instead is just laughable.  And for a man to be so in love that he's willing to let a woman he loves walk so freely when he's so dangerous is almost embarassing.But the plot thickens! I appreciate the ""no hesitation"" which added a little realism to the plot. And when I started finding out the reasoning behind all of the comments I made above, then I was like ""Ohhhh!  Okay!"" On top of that, honestly, Mekhi Phifer is so damn sexy, I really stopped caring about the plot and just admired him.  It was even more interesting to see his ex-wife act in the film with him and do the two things that they argued about publicly to other people (well, ""act"" like they were doing anyway).  You know how Monique said Denzel died sexy?  Well, the last man in the end who died (I won't say who) died very sexy (minus all the slobber! Gross!)  The ""convicts"" sense of humor cracked me up too. And Wanye? Wow. I would've laughed at someone choosing him as the thug, but he did a great job.This movie is definitely on the low-budget side, but they picked the right actors/actresses to make this movie decent.",4,Laughable but cool...,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2198,"['Okay', 'read', 'first', 'few', 'reviews', 'must', 'straighten', 'up', 'couple', 'things.', '1', 'was', 'interracial', 'sex', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'reviewer', 'was', 'talking', 'about.', '2', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'turned', 'off', 'two', 'seconds', 'movie', 'started', 'have', 'click', 'English', 'twice', ""'re"", 'actually', 'turning', 'movie', 'Originally', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'predictable', 'woman', 'being', 'so', 'free', 'roam', 'home', 'stranger', 'husband', 'more', 'concerned', 'script', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'Being', 'thrown', 'jacuzzi', 'not', 'experiencing', 'heat', 'impossible', 'black', 'man', 'letting', 'black', 'man', 'home', 'not', 'watching', 'whole', 'time', 'asking', 'see', 'car', 'supposedly', 'problems', 'flat-out', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'friend', 'going', 'friend', 'house', 'being', 'asked', 'leave', 'being', 'so', 'indignant', 'leaving', 'then', 'not', 'having', 'plans', 'interrupt', 'why', 'wanted', 'leave', 'really', 'far-fetched', 'Why', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'gun', 'one', 'hand', 'use', 'other', 'one', 'fight', 'instead', 'just', 'laughable', 'man', 'be', 'so', 'love', 'willing', 'let', 'woman', 'walk', 'so', 'freely', 'when', 'so', 'dangerous', 'almost', 'embarassing.But', 'plot', 'appreciate', 'hesitation', 'added', 'little', 'realism', 'plot', 'when', 'started', 'finding', 'out', 'reasoning', 'comments', 'made', 'then', 'was', 'Ohhhh', 'Okay', 'top', 'honestly', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'so', 'damn', 'sexy', 'really', 'stopped', 'caring', 'plot', 'just', 'admired', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'ex-wife', 'act', 'film', 'do', 'two', 'things', 'argued', 'about', 'publicly', 'other', 'people', 'well', 'act', 'were', 'doing', 'anyway', 'know', 'how', 'Monique', 'said', 'Denzel', 'died', 'sexy', 'Well', 'last', 'man', 'end', 'who', 'died', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'died', 'very', 'sexy', 'slobber', 'Gross', 'convicts', 'sense', 'humor', 'cracked', 'up', 'too', 'Wanye', 'Wow', 'would', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'someone', 'choosing', 'thug', 'did', 'great', 'job.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'low-budget', 'side', 'picked', 'right', 'actors/actresses', 'make', 'movie', 'decent']",N/A
