651895,A95HEW0CE173,B00005JPK9,Bryan Lemke,"[1, 1]","The movie has SO much potential, but falls short in so many ways.#1 - The movie seems choppy and poorly edited in some places.  Reading the other reviews, I understand that several scenes were deleted from the DVD and it makes sense why it's choppy.  It still doesn't fix the choppy transitions in some places or unexplained things, but at least we know WHY it doesn't flow smoothly.#2 - If they're going to edit out crucial scenes on the DVD to make it more friendly for children, why do they still leave some things that are just not right for kids (The near-naked bartender, the repeated use of 'Oh my G**!"", etc.).  If they're going to edit it for kids, edit it all the way or not at all.#3 - The story is too contrived (even for a kid movie) and poorly written in too many places.  The dialogue seems forced and fake too often, and the character transition (the stubborn independent heroine suddenly becoming soft and tender for no explicable reason?) is just not believable at all.#4 - It seems like it's trying so hard to be a kid's movie but doesn't understand that the elements to make a good movie for grown-ups still need to be there for kids (believable characters, a consistent plot, no unnecessary scenes that make you scratch your head and ask ""What was the point of that?"").Bottom line: The movie fell short of being truly wonderful.  It was cute enough and could easily have been a top-ten movie for us with a few minor tweaks.  It started out with a great idea and is right on the edge of going from mediocre to masterful...but never does.  Add to that a 5-year-old walking around the house saying ""Oh my G**!"" over and over and your 3-year old taking his pants off to be like the bartender and you get a frustrating 'kids' movie to have purchased with my own kids in mind.

651896,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPK9,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","This film was released in 2006 and I only ever saw it on a whim not expecting it to be anything special. How surprised was I to find that this was an incredibly enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout its entire runtime. Now I have to say something, I'm not a fan of Freddy Highmore and to be honest just find him incredible annoying. However, even I have to admit that he was great in this flick and don't really think this could've been done without him. Not only is this film carried by Highmores main role, but it's also a film that features two of the biggest musical stars of the 20th century of Madonna and David Bowie. This is just a picture with some massive names putting their voices and faces towards it. Snoop Dogg, Mia Farrow and David Suchet come together with music legends and the main antagonist to create this highly enjoyable film experience.Arthur is a ten year old boy living with his grandmother whilst his parents are away looking for work. His eccentric grandfather has been missing for a number of years, and his grandparents house is due to be torn down due to massive debts. Arthur reads a book that tells of the land of the Minimoys and his grandfathers secret treasure hidden somewhere in the land. Arthur decides that this is simply his only chance to save their home, so he manages to get into the land of the Minimoys who are a people no larger than a human tooth who live underground. Upon venturing into their land he meets Princess Selenia (Madonna) and her brother Betameche (Jimmy Fallon) who offer to help Arthur find his grandfathers lost treasure.What's the most surprising aspect of the whole film is it's simply not what you would expect. Although I stumbled across it, I had this dea that it would be a very childish film filled with idiomatic clich&eacute;s and double entendr&eacute;s that only the adults would get. What I got instead was a very clean and ejoyable film, not looking to over impress a particular audience but just looking to entertain. David Bowies voicing of the bad guy Maltazard is one of the coolest parts of the entire thing as I'm sure many will agree that the man himself is quite a scary persona.I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a child or even if you don't have a child, borrow one from next door to give you an excuse to watch it. It's a great film, very clean and just a heartwarming experience but it's one of those that you couldn't watch on your own without appearing a bit creepy.",4,I'm Almost Ashamed To Say It Was Great,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,2484,"['film', 'was', 'released', '2006', 'only', 'ever', 'saw', 'whim', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'anything', 'special', 'How', 'surprised', 'was', 'find', 'was', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'kept', 'attention', 'entire', 'runtime', 'Now', 'have', 'say', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Freddy', 'Highmore', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'find', 'incredible', 'annoying', 'However', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'great', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'carried', 'Highmores', 'main', 'role', 'also', 'film', 'two', 'biggest', 'musical', 'stars', '20th', 'century', 'Madonna', 'David', 'Bowie', 'just', 'picture', 'massive', 'names', 'putting', 'voices', 'towards', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'David', 'Suchet', 'come', 'together', 'music', 'legends', 'main', 'antagonist', 'create', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'experience.Arthur', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'living', 'grandmother', 'whilst', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'looking', 'work', 'eccentric', 'grandfather', 'been', 'missing', 'number', 'years', 'grandparents', 'house', 'due', 'be', 'torn', 'down', 'due', 'massive', 'debts', 'Arthur', 'book', 'land', 'Minimoys', 'grandfathers', 'secret', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'land', 'Arthur', 'simply', 'only', 'chance', 'save', 'home', 'get', 'land', 'Minimoys', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'no', 'larger', 'human', 'tooth', 'who', 'live', 'underground', 'venturing', 'land', 'Princess', 'Selenia', 'Madonna', 'brother', 'Betameche', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'who', 'offer', 'help', 'Arthur', 'find', 'grandfathers', 'lost', 'treasure.What', 'most', 'surprising', 'aspect', 'whole', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'stumbled', 'had', 'dea', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'childish', 'film', 'filled', 'idiomatic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'double', 'entendr', 'eacute', 'only', 'adults', 'would', 'get', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'very', 'clean', 'ejoyable', 'film', 'not', 'looking', 'impress', 'particular', 'audience', 'just', 'looking', 'entertain', 'David', 'Bowies', 'voicing', 'bad', 'guy', 'Maltazard', 'one', 'coolest', 'parts', 'entire', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'agree', 'man', 'quite', 'scary', 'persona.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'child', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'child', 'borrow', 'one', 'next', 'door', 'give', 'excuse', 'watch', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'clean', 'just', 'heartwarming', 'experience', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'own', 'appearing', 'bit', 'creepy']",N/A

651901,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPK9,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 7]","In the cinematic world, there are few things as disappointing as a good-hearted fantasy film that misses the mark. Such a shame: a lot of work went into Luc Besson's ""Arthur and the Invisibles,"" a film of great imagination and style. But something was missing, something that prevented the story from transcending its overtly unrealistic elements. It seemed that the emphasis on creating the right world for these characters was too strong; not enough emphasis was placed on developing the characters themselves, nor was there enough on immersing the audience within this world. This film felt only half complete, as if Besson was in a hurry to get his project finished and released.The world that I'm referring to is that of the Minimoys, miniscule, elfin-like creatures that live underground. The parts of the film featuring these characters are completely computer generated, meaning that the filmmakers had to pay close attention to detail. Sure enough, details are abundant: we see immense dirt caves; we see elaborate contraptions of Minimoy design, such as weaponry and tools; we see finely built structures, such as aqueduct systems; we see grandiose throne rooms. But somehow, it wasn't enough. For one thing, what we were shown went by far too quickly; I never had the chance to fully absorb everything I was watching, which made it a lot harder to feel connected to the story.The Minimoys' underground kingdom is located in a Connecticut garden, one that's on the property of Arthur (Freddie Highmore) and his grandmother (Mia Farrow). These characters are introduced in the live action portion of the film, which I could tell was purposely created to establish plot. In that regard, the story succeeds; everything we need to know is outlined during these scenes, such as the fact that Arthur's parents (Doug Rand and Penny Balfour) are well intentioned but incredibly neglectful. They live in the city, hoping that getting better jobs will help them through hard times. What they don't realize is that they're missing significant portions of their son's life, such as his tenth birthday.We also learn that Arthur's grandfather, Archibald (Ron Crawford), has been missing for quite some time. He was a cultured, adventurous man who had once gone on an African expedition and returned with a small fortune in rubies, supposedly now buried somewhere on the property. While on this trip, he had become friendly with members of an African tribe, who have a harmonious existence with the Minimoys (apparently because of a universal balance; they're a tiny race of people while the Africans are incredibly tall).Because Archibald is missing, a greedy land developer known only as Davido (Adam LeFevre) is ready to pounce on his property, currently occupied by his wife and grandson. Unfortunately, everything was done legally; the right people were present to sign all the right papers. If Arthur and his grandmother intend to stay in their home, Archibald must return with the right sum of money. Of course, Davido is almost certain that he will never come back, which allows for a display of arrogance commonly seen amongst fantasy film villains.For the sake of the story, Arthur was crafted to be of the brave, ambitious type, one who feels that everything will turn out right if he holds out enough hope and shows enough courage. For years, he had been told about the Minimoys, gathering most of his information from a collection of illustrations and notes his grandfather left behind. From these sources, he learns that the treasure is within their world; if he can somehow speak with the Minimoys, then maybe he can convince them to give him the treasure. That way, Davido can be paid off, and Arthur's home will be spared (as well the home of the Minimoys).Apparently, Archibald always intended for his grandson to complete a mission, and he tells him so through a series of cleverly hidden written messages. And according to these messages, Arthur is to enter the world of the Minimoys and find this missing treasure. With the help of a special telescope, the moon, and a group of African warrior types (how they conveniently showed up in Connecticut is anyone's guess), Arthur is shrunk down, pushed into the telescope, and transformed into a computer-generated, elfin-looking character.Thus begins his adventure in the Minimoy kingdom. He meets a number of colorful characters, including: The King (Robert De Niro), who, for whatever reason, alters his appearance by sitting atop a furry monster; his daughter, Princess Selenia (Madonna), who feels she has something to prove; and her younger brother, Betameche (Jimmy Fallon). I would have believed these charactere were it not for the humorous dialogue, none of which seemed appropriate for this kind of film. It was especially prominent in a scene featuring the voice talents of Snoop Dogg and Anthony Anderson; it was obvious these characters were included merely as a way to add comedy relief to the story. But consider the fact that all the Minimoy characters were funny at some point; even the headstrong Selenia will occasionally make some wisecrack about her brother. The entire Minimoy civilization served as comedy relief, which I found bothersome considering they're supposed to be integral to the plot.Arthur and the royal siblings make a perilous journey across the lawn to a necropolis city, which contains both the treasure and the evil Malthazar (David Bowie), leader of a warrior race who have long since been at odds with the Minimoys. His scheme is to unleash a flood upon the opposing clan. Exciting idea? Yes. But it wasn't handled properly in the final film; Malthazar's character was painfully underdeveloped. He's only seen during the last half hour of the movie, meaning his scheme practically comes out of nowhere. It doesn't help that he seems to be the only level headed one of the entire clan; all of his troops--even his own son, Darkos (Jason Bateman)--are nothing more than bumbling fools. Example: early on, a couple of warriors invade the Minimoy city. I distinctly remember this argument: ""I'll count to three ..."" one begins to say. ""Why three?"" the other interrupts. ""That's just the way it's done,"" the first replies. ""Why not five?"" is the other's suggestion. I admit that some of the jokes in this movie were funny. Still, is there no sense of seriousness to this story?Maybe I'm being overly critical. Nonetheless, I can't help but feel that ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" had the potential to be so much more than it was. There are a number of problems I could list: far too much about the Minimoys was left unexplained, leaving what little there was seem completely out of place; some of the fairy tale element are unoriginal, the most notable example being Arthur's ability to pull a sword free from a stone; Freddie Highmore retains his British accent for his character, which doesn't make sense in a film taking place in the United States. But my biggest problem was being forcibly detached from the imaginative settings; the world of the Minimoys is rich and vibrant, and I wanted to experience it fully. When an idea so stunning is willfully pushed aside for the sake of pacing, you can't help but feel greatly disappointed.",3,Miniscule Entertainment,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,7235,"['cinematic',

I saw the uncut version on satellite TV in Japan, and this Weinstein release edited out some of the funnier scenes.  I suppose they were considered a little too racy for a ""G"" rating, but the material cut was very mild and shouldn't have been objectionable even to families with small children.  For example, when Arthur, the Princess, and her little brother are in a small boat about to go over the falls, Arthur needs a bit of rope so he can tie it to his sword, stick the sword into a log over the stream, and climb the rope to safety.  There isn't any rope, and Arthur starts to reach for the cord that ties the Princess's shirt front.  She swats his hand away and says something like ""just because we're about to die doesn't mean you can take liberties!""  He explains what it's for and takes it, so she has to hold her shirt closed with one hand.  Right away they have to climb up the cord, and he tells her to use both hands, but she needs one hand to keep her top on.  There are several cuts like that in this U.S. DVD release.

O'Blenis,"[8, 9]","One of the most enchanting and delightful fables to ever hit the screen, ""Arthur And The Invisibles"" is an odyssey of fun, adventure, magic, and comedy that's sure to delight kids of all ages and awaken the hearts of even the crankiest cinema-goers.A blend of live-action (about a quarter of the film) and high-tech, extremely detailed and beautiful computer animation (the other three quarters), this movie may be, in tone and spirit, the closest thing made outside of Asia to classic Studio Ghibili anime (ex. ""Castle In The Sky"", ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", etc.).  Arthur is a little boy who lives with his grandmother on a rambling old family farm while his parents are off in the city searching for employment during hard financial times.  Arthur is fascinated with the tales of his grandfather, a currently-missing old adventurer who in his younger days travelled Africa befriending and living with various tribes and cultures, and sometimes aiding the continent through, for example, helping local farmers to introduce irrigation to drought-prone lands.  There are many more fantastical adventures the grandfather claims to have had, including meeting a race of African 'wee folk' called the Minimoys.  When the family farm is threatened with foreclosure due to outstanding bills, Arthur decides that he needs to locate a treasure of rubies his grandfather acquired in Africa in order to come to his family's aid, and, convinced that these Minimoys now reside on the same land he, his grandmother, and their dog live on, sets out to find these small creatures and enlist their help on his search.Magically transported into the land of the Minimoys, Arthur finds himself transformed into one of them and, just as he needs help to save his home, finds the Minimoys in need of aid of their own.  For it's a time of great strife in this magical wee land, where races other than the Minimoys live and conflict is escalating.  An alliance of wonderous characters assembles to tackle their collective problems.The Minimoys, their world, and the myriad other creatures they share it with are all exceptionally well rendered, and the voice acting is very well performed. The characters are excellent; the Minimoy King, his feisty daughter, and his accident-prone but earnest younger son are among the most instantly captivating, and there's also a little mole with a much smaller role I found absolutely endearing. There's enough ""Shrek""/""Toy Story"" style humor to appeal greatly to fans of these movies (although in my opinion ""Arthur And The Invisibles"" is a significantly better movie) and fans of ""Spirited Away""-style Japanese anime, ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"", ""E.T."", and ""Lilo & Stitch"" should all see this as soon as posible.  A brilliant movie with room for one or more sequels; few movies have ever debuted which are so ripe for expansion into a full saga.  10/10",5,An Awesome All-Ages Fantasy Adventure,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2884,"['One', 'most', 'enchanting', 'delightful', 'fables', 'ever', 'hit', 'screen', 'Arthur', 'Invisibles', 'odyssey', 'fun', 'adventure', 'magic', 'comedy', 'sure', 'delight', 'kids', 'ages', 'awaken', 'hearts', 'even', 'crankiest', 'cinema-goers.A', 'blend', 'live-action', 'quarter', 'film', 'high-tech', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'beautiful', 'computer', 'animation', 'other', 'three', 'quarters', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'tone', 'spirit', 'closest', 'thing', 'made', 'Asia', 'classic', 'Studio', 'Ghibili', 'anime', 'ex', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'etc.', 'Arthur', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'grandmother', 'rambling', 'old', 'family', 'farm', 'parents', 'are', 'city', 'searching', 'employment', 'hard', 'financial', 'times', 'Arthur', 'fascinated', 'tales', 'grandfather', 'currently-missing', 'old', 'adventurer', 'who', 'younger', 'days', 'travelled', 'Africa', 'befriending', 'living', 'various', 'tribes', 'cultures', 'sometimes', 'aiding', 'continent', 'example', 'helping', 'local', 'farmers', 'introduce', 'irrigation', 'drought-prone', 'lands', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'fantastical', 'grandfather', 'claims', 'have', 'had', 'including', 'meeting', 'race', 'African', ""'wee"", 'folk', 'called', 'Minimoys', 'When', 'family', 'farm', 'threatened', 'foreclosure', 'due', 'outstanding', 'bills', 'Arthur', 'locate', 'treasure', 'rubies', 'grandfather', 'acquired', 'Africa', 'order', 'come', 'family', 'aid', 'convinced', 'Minimoys', 'now', 'reside', 'same', 'land', 'grandmother', 'dog', 'live', 'sets', 'out', 'find', 'small', 'creatures', 'enlist', 'help', 'search.Magically', 'transported', 'land', 'Minimoys', 'Arthur', 'transformed', 'one', 'just', 'help', 'save', 'home', 'Minimoys', 'need', 'aid', 'own', 'time', 'great', 'strife', 'magical', 'wee', 'land', 'where', 'other', 'Minimoys', 'live', 'conflict', 'escalating', 'alliance', 'wonderous', 'characters', 'assembles', 'tackle', 'collective', 'problems.The', 'Minimoys', 'world', 'myriad', 'other', 'creatures', 'share', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'rendered', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'Minimoy', 'King', 'feisty', 'daughter', 'accident-prone', 'earnest', 'younger', 'son', 'are', 'most', 'instantly', 'captivating', 'also', 'little', 'mole', 'much', 'smaller', 'role', 'found', 'absolutely', 'endearing', 'enough', 'Shrek', '/', 'Toy', 'Story', 'style', 'humor', 'appeal', 'greatly', 'fans', 'movies', 'opinion', 'Arthur', 'Invisibles', 'significantly', 'better', 'movie', 'fans', 'Spirited', 'Away', '-style', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'True', 'Story', 'E.T', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'should', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'posible', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'room', 'one', 'more', 'sequels', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'debuted', 'are', 'so', 'ripe', 'expansion', 'full', 'saga', '10/10']",N/A

My favorite scene was the one where Grandma is telling Arthur about Granddad's travels. The lighting is that magical golden-amber and your imagination runs away as she tells the story of the giants, their brothers the little people and the rubies they gave granddad.But let me back up, our hero, Arthur is a little boy who lives with his grandmother (Mia Farrow) in the country. His parents call from the city on his birthday because they are still there trying to find work. He's of course sad because they aren't with him. But grandma had someone bake him a cake, (their oven isn't woring) and she has a wind-up toy car as a gift for him.Granddad disappeared a few years ago, and unfortunately, a bad guy is going to come take the property they live on because they can't pay the bills. This is where Grandma tells Arthur stories of Granddad's travels, and how he made friends with a tribe of very tall people, and another group of very small people. They are sort of two sides of one coin. They call each other brothers. To thank granddad for his help, they give him the rubies, which could be very helpful given their financial problems.Arthur asks his grandmother where the rubies are and she explains that granddad hid them in the back yard, and looked tirelessly for them, but couldn't find them. Then, he disappeared.Through a series of clues, (another of my favorite parts) Arthur discovers how to get to the land of the little people, and this is where the adventure begins. He becomes a Minimoy, which to us means he becomes an animated, and somewhat more hip version of himself. He meets the king (Robert DiNero) and his daughter (Madonna).He finds out that his grandfather has been through their land and went to look for the rubies. A bad guy, with the voice of David Bowie, threatens their land, and has the rubies. Arthur, the princess, and her little brother go off to face the bad guy. On the way, they discover that one of Arthur's inventions is going to be used by the bad guys to hurt the Minimoys.They find Granddad in prison, where they also end up. They of course get out, save the Minimoys and Arthur and his granddad get home with the rubies to save the day.There is also hope for a future relationship, because Arthur is able to go visit every 10 moons.

651934,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPK9,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Yes, I admit it. ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" (""Arthur et les Minimoys""), Luc Besson's first animated film, is far from perfect. Its weak story borrows bits of elements from various fairy tales and legends and its combination of live-action footage with animation does not work as it should be. Still few animated films can attract such talent as Madonna, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg and Robert DeNiro (all providing voices for characters) plus Mia Farrow. And its colorful animation is delight to see.Freddie Highmore (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is Arthur, young brave boy who has only 48 hours to save his grandma's house from being sold to a greedy businessman and demolished. To seek the treasure hidden in the garden, he becomes small (using some device that need no explanation), as small as 2mm, and join forces with the Minimoys, tiny people threatened by evil ""M."" Thus Arthur's adventures with two Minimoys - independent Princess Selenia and fast-talking comic relief Betameche - begins.You will find nothing particularly new in this story. The film's a bit contrived plot unfolds sometimes at hectic speed especially in animation part, which is often interrupted by live-action counterpart. Mia Farrow (who appears only in live-action segment) is not bad as the hero's slightly loopy grandmother, but her segment is rather dull to me mainly because the film comes back to her several times when not many things happen to her except, as you see, her missing grandson whom we know is all right.I said this is Luc Besson film, but the film's original concept came from C&eacute;line Garcia and Patrice Garcia. It must have taken considerable time and efforts for them and Besson to develop the idea into the film's universe as it is, but I think with a simpler story and more round characters the world of the Minimoys would be more attractive. In short, we don't need ""Pulp Fiction"" parody. ""Antz"" already did it. We don't need a greedy businessman. Anyway kids love adventures and without that guy boys and girls would join in the travel with the Minimoys.Instead we want more engaging stories behind the relations between the Princess and the Evil King; we need more adventures before arriving the destination; and most of all, we want to know more about the suggested love (with some sexual nuance) between Arthur and Princess, which is one of the most intriguing part of the film, considering the cast of Freddie Highmore and Madonna. This alone could have given originality with a more developed and attractive form.I hear this is the first chapter of trilogy.

The plot is simple enough: Arthur has an amazing adventure in an enchanted place - he becomes a hero there, then returns to the everyday world and becomes a hero again. That much is great escapist fantasy.The format is a little surprising, though. The movie starts with live actors, switches to some very good animation through the largest part of the movie, then ends with the live actors - but even there, Besson adds some fun fantasy elements.There are lots of familiar pieces here: the curvy-but-chaste princess (this is a kids' movie after all) with an attitude, geeky sidekick, quest for treasure, a little safe romance, and even a sword in a stone. Despite that checklist of standard features, this avoids being completely formulaic. Most adults wouldn't sit through it on their own, but kids need movies too.-- wiredweird",4,"Kid safe, with surprising star power",1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,972,"['Arthur', 'cute', 'bit', 'fluffy', 'adventure', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'director', 'ofThe', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Remastered', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Angel-A', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Arthur', 'amazing', 'adventure', 'enchanted', 'place', 'hero', 'there', 'then', 'everyday', 'world', 'hero', 'again', 'much', 'great', 'escapist', 'fantasy.The', 'format', 'little', 'surprising', 'though', 'movie', 'live', 'actors', 'switches', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'largest', 'part', 'movie', 'then', 'live', 'actors', 'even', 'there', 'Besson', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'are', 'lots', 'familiar', 'pieces', 'here', 'curvy-but-chaste', 'princess', 'kids', 'movie', 'attitude', 'geeky', 'sidekick', 'quest', 'treasure', 'little', 'safe', 'romance', 'even', 'sword', 'stone', 'checklist', 'standard', 'features', 'avoids', 'being', 'completely', 'formulaic', 'Most', 'adults', 'would', ""n't"", 'sit', 'own', 'kids', 'need', 'movies', 'too.', 'wiredweird']",N/A
