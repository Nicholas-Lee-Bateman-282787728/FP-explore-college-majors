He told me that he watch this miserable show on TV. He told me about the atrocities that criminal producer Sam made with Batman.I told him that I have Batman cartoons in my DVD stand and he told me he wanted to watch it. Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching ""Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV"".Do yourself a favor: avoid like the plague this DVD and buy a Scooby Doo cartoon for your kid, instead of this.

919080,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000A2UBHK,Simon,"[11, 15]","This second release of The Batman contains another three episodes: The Man Who Would Be Bat (Man-Bat), The Big Chill (Mr. Freeze), and The Cat and the Bat (Catwoman).I'll be one of the first to say that The Batman as a series won me over in its second season. Canada has already gotten all the episodes, and certain ones like the appearances of Grundy, Hugo Strange, and Riddler really up the fun factor to a stylish and exciting level. However, this dvd still contains episodes from the first season, which means we're getting rather poor stories with bad dialogue offset by strong animation and interesting character designs. It's a shame really, as the new Man-Bat design is far scarier than the old BTAS one, and giving Mr. Freeze mutated ice powers (ala Marvel's Iceman) is a decent twist. But these villains lack characterizations and motivations - having Kirk Langstrom transform into Man-Bat simply to be a ""better bat"" than Batman doesn't do it for me. The Catwoman episode is fairly decent, though it still lacks a certain spark to make it memorable.Also, WHV isn't making anyone happy with its cheap 3 episodes/disc release pattern, with few substantial bonus features. Why every release can't be as good as the Teen Titans discs is a mystery to me.There's really no reason to get this disc. Wait for more episodes or when WB finally puts the Clayface finale on dvd.",1,Still not doing it for me...,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1377,"['second', 'release', 'Batman', 'three', 'episodes', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'Bat', 'Man-Bat', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Cat', 'Bat', 'Catwoman', '.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'first', 'say', 'Batman', 'series', 'won', 'over', 'second', 'season', 'Canada', 'already', 'gotten', 'episodes', 'certain', 'ones', 'appearances', 'Grundy', 'Hugo', 'Strange', 'Riddler', 'really', 'fun', 'factor', 'stylish', 'exciting', 'level', 'However', 'dvd', 'still', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', ""'re"", 'getting', 'rather', 'poor', 'stories', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'offset', 'strong', 'animation', 'interesting', 'character', 'designs', 'shame', 'really', 'new', 'Man-Bat', 'design', 'far', 'scarier', 'old', 'BTAS', 'one', 'giving', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'mutated', 'ice', 'powers', 'Marvel', 'Iceman', 'decent', 'twist', 'villains', 'lack', 'characterizations', 'motivations', 'having', 'Kirk', 'Langstrom', 'transform', 'Man-Bat', 'simply', 'be', 'better', 'bat', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'do', 'Catwoman', 'episode', 'fairly', 'decent', 'still', 'certain', 'spark', 'make', 'WHV', ""n't"", 'making', 'anyone', 'happy', 'cheap', '3', 'episodes/disc', 'release', 'pattern', 'few', 'substantial', 'bonus', 'features', 'Why', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'discs', 'mystery', 'me.There', 'really', 'reason', 'get', 'disc', 'Wait', 'more', 'episodes', 'when', 'WB', 'finally', 'Clayface', 'finale', 'dvd']",The Batman: Season 1 - Volume 2 - The Man Who Would Be Bat
