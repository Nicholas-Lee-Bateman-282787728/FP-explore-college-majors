He was able to do everything to the maximum and really feels he got the best workout possible in areas he hasn't worked before.  We haven't been as successful with Jillian's other DVD's but we keep trying which is why we probably could keep up on the third part of the circuit.  I have trouble doing jumping jacks because I am so heavy in the bust (but wearing one older bra, one with soft wires and then a larger sports bra has helped tremendously - yes, THREE bras but it works!)so I modify the jumping which still allows a good heartrate increase. You could just march in place with knees really high.  I did ALL the push ups with this DVD since trying to do them on Jillian's ""30 Day Shred"" which is a killer.  This one is great for beginners and intermediates.  You can see the progress by former Biggest Losers who demonstrate the exercises.  We love Jillian's dumbbells - easier to hold and hand friendly.  One way or another Jillian will whip us into shape.",5,Slower paced for beginners but packs a great workout!,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1050,"['husband', 'just', 'called', 'work', 'do', 'DVD', 'again', 'day', 'rest', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'everything', 'maximum', 'really', 'feels', 'got', 'best', 'workout', 'possible', 'areas', ""n't"", 'worked', 'before', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'as', 'successful', 'Jillian', 'other', 'DVD', 'keep', 'trying', 'why', 'probably', 'could', 'keep', 'up', 'third', 'part', 'circuit', 'have', 'trouble', 'doing', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'am', 'so', 'heavy', 'bust', 'wearing', 'one', 'older', 'bra', 'one', 'soft', 'wires', 'then', 'larger', 'sports', 'bra', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'yes', 'THREE', 'bras', 'modify', 'jumping', 'still', 'good', 'heartrate', 'increase', 'could', 'just', 'march', 'place', 'knees', 'really', 'high', 'did', 'push', 'ups', 'DVD', 'trying', 'do', 'Jillian', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'killer', 'one', 'great', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'can', 'see', 'progress', 'former', 'Biggest', 'Losers', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'exercises', 'love', 'Jillian', 'dumbbells', 'easier', 'hold', 'hand', 'friendly', 'One', 'way', 'Jillian', 'will', 'whip', 'shape']",N/A

I am an advanced excerciser but because it was Jillian I didn't really expect this to be a real ""begginer"" video. I found the quality of the video to be horrible. It is just Jillian and a contestant from the biggest loser doing 6 curcuits in an all white room, no music, no real enthusiasm. It was just blah. The workout itself delivered as Jillian usually does, it got me sweating but I added hand weights to all of the excercises and went a little faster than they did just to get more out of it. There is a transition break between each curcuit that in my opinion is way too long where she introduces the person with her. This is a real begginer workout so if you are just getting back into excercise I would reccomend this but by no means is this one of Jillian's kick butt workout.",3,Good excercises but too easy,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,917,"['rented', 'video', 'love', 'everything', 'Jillian', 'enjoy', 'challenge', 'always', 'get', 'workouts', 'Not', 'one', 'am', 'advanced', 'excerciser', 'was', 'Jillian', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'be', 'real', 'begginer', 'video', 'found', 'quality', 'video', 'be', 'horrible', 'just', 'Jillian', 'contestant', 'biggest', 'loser', 'doing', '6', 'curcuits', 'white', 'room', 'music', 'real', 'enthusiasm', 'was', 'just', 'blah', 'workout', 'delivered', 'Jillian', 'usually', 'got', 'sweating', 'added', 'hand', 'weights', 'excercises', 'went', 'little', 'faster', 'did', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'transition', 'break', 'curcuit', 'opinion', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'where', 'person', 'real', 'begginer', 'so', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'excercise', 'would', 'reccomend', 'means', 'one', 'Jillian', 'kick', 'butt', 'workout']",N/A

1024156,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000J10KNM,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[40, 41]","If you are amazed by how much weight contestants lost while on the reality show: ""The Biggest Loser,"" this workout gives you an idea of how much effort it takes to see real results in a short amount of time. This workout is perhaps one of the most difficult I've tried due to the circuit-style training. To be honest, this will be enjoyed by anyone who is at least intermediate and it will give beginners lots to look forward to.Jillian Michaels puts Shane through the paces first with the first circuit that consists of a series of exercises that is repeated three times. So, you get three sets of exercises of 10 repetitions each as you work through jumping jacks (I used a small aerobic stepper or you can walk in place), push-ups and squats using a chair.Kim joins Jillian for the second circuit as she enjoys a cardio interval of walking then does ""bench dips,"" which I think are a little easier when you hold on to a kitchen counter instead of a chair at the start and then finishes with squats. If you are doing 5-8 reps at the start that is fine and then you can work to 10.I was seriously not keeping up with the third circuit, which seemed at a faster pace with jump rope, chest exercises and squats. By the time I was on the floor and then back up standing, I was only able to do about 5-8 reps. I didn't think that holding the weights while jumping up and down was a good idea because this puts strain on your wrists. The jumping jacks seem better if you are walking and raising your arms at the start. If the exercises are too ""bouncy"" or ""high impact"" then you have the option of walking, which I gratefully did instead.On the fourth circuit Shane returns for jumping jacks, shoulder exercises and chair squats. I was amazed to make it to circuit five where you march in place and actually get a bit of a break and then do some fun oblique work while working out your legs at the same time.By circuit six, you will literally feel the fat melting off you as you again do jumping and then do some seriously good lateral raises and a plank that tests your endurance. I didn't make it to thirty seconds the first two times, but with Jillian motivational teaching style, I braced for the last one and held it for thirty seconds even by then I was shaking and about to fall over.This workout is seriously geared towards fat burning and will be enjoyed most by intermediate exercisers who want a good cardiovascular challenge while working out arms, legs and abs. My endurance was seriously tested and everything seemed more challenging because of the circuit-style workout. If you are ready for some serious exercising, Jillian will show you the way ""my love,"" as she says. She has a real sassy teaching style which keeps you smiling.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.
