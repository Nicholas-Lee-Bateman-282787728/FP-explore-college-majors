736112,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,B00008978T,Blu Review Obscura,"[42, 45]","An Innocent Man Blu-ray ReviewDistributor: Mill Creek Entertainment (US)Tom Selleck will always be known as Magnum P.I. to anyone who grew up watching classic TV shows throughout the 1980's, however this little known film actually showcased a real talent for playing a very different kind of leading role.The film takes a basic prison drama as the stories middle and adds a character driven beginning and an ending which at times almost borders on an action movie. Tom Selleck plays Jimmie Rainwood, an average ordinary every day guy, wrongly sent to prison by two cops that you will just love to hate and the film follows his characters story as he progresses through his time spent in a harsh prison trying to adjust to a very less than average life style. Usually, the release of the main character from his incarceration would mark the films natural conclusion, however being released from prison is only the start of Rainwood's troubles and the film continues at steady pace until the final climatic showdown which will leave you totally rooting for main character.A very welcome, although somewhat surprising release for Blu-ray treatment, the film is presented in a 1080i 1.78:1 wide-screen transfer which actually looks pretty good. Ultimately, there is nothing here of stand out quality, however the picture looks quite sharp with some nice detail on display as well as showing reasonable colour representation and black levels also appearing natural. With minimal print damage on display apart from the odd slight flicker or speck, this new HD release really marks a vast improvement over previous DVD releases. Thankfully, Mill Creek Entertainment have produced this Blu-ray as a region free disc, so people who need to consider region coding issues need not be concerned.Audio is presented as a DTS 2.0 master and although entirely unremarkable, dialogue is clear without any distortion and the now memorable score obviously sounding better than ever. Admittedly certain action scenes do come across as a little flat, however this is only in comparison to more modern day releases and the soundtrack overall provides a reasonably good listening experience.Sadly there are no extras present on this release, however the main selling point here is the film itself and this being a budget release, you actually get an awful lot of film for your money.If you are looking for an emotion filled yet realistic character driven story, complete with excellent acting from the lead role and supporting cast, then this film is a great way to be thoroughly entertained while also probably left wondering how you would ultimately cope should the same situation occur.Almost a mini classic, for certain it is nice to see these less remembered titles finding their way to Blu-ray and hopefully other lesser known movies will now follow suit.""Two cops on the take just made the biggest mistake of their lives, they framed an innocent man.""BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of those less mainstream Blu-ray releases - find us on Facebook",4,Blu Review 37 - An Innocent Man,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,3031,"['Innocent', 'Man', 'Blu-ray', 'ReviewDistributor', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'US', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'classic', 'TV', 'shows', '1980', 'however', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'actually', 'showcased', 'real', 'talent', 'playing', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'leading', 'role.The', 'film', 'basic', 'prison', 'drama', 'stories', 'middle', 'character', 'driven', 'beginning', 'ending', 'times', 'almost', 'borders', 'action', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Jimmie', 'Rainwood', 'average', 'ordinary', 'day', 'guy', 'wrongly', 'sent', 'prison', 'two', 'cops', 'will', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'characters', 'story', 'time', 'spent', 'harsh', 'prison', 'trying', 'adjust', 'very', 'less', 'average', 'life', 'style', 'Usually', 'release', 'main', 'character', 'incarceration', 'would', 'mark', 'films', 'natural', 'conclusion', 'however', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'only', 'start', 'Rainwood', 'troubles', 'film', 'steady', 'pace', 'final', 'climatic', 'showdown', 'will', 'leave', 'totally', 'rooting', 'main', 'character.A', 'very', 'welcome', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'release', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', 'film', 'presented', '1080i', '1.78:1', 'wide-screen', 'transfer', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Ultimately', 'nothing', 'here', 'stand', 'quality', 'however', 'picture', 'quite', 'sharp', 'nice', 'detail', 'display', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'reasonable', 'colour', 'representation', 'black', 'levels', 'also', 'appearing', 'natural', 'minimal', 'print', 'damage', 'display', 'apart', 'odd', 'slight', 'flicker', 'speck', 'new', 'HD', 'release', 'really', 'vast', 'improvement', 'previous', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Thankfully', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'have', 'produced', 'Blu-ray', 'region', 'free', 'disc', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'consider', 'region', 'coding', 'issues', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'concerned.Audio', 'presented', 'DTS', '2.0', 'master', 'entirely', 'unremarkable', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'distortion', 'now', 'memorable', 'score', 'obviously', 'sounding', 'better', 'ever', 'Admittedly', 'certain', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', 'come', 'little', 'flat', 'however', 'only', 'comparison', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'releases', 'soundtrack', 'overall', 'reasonably', 'good', 'listening', 'experience.Sadly', 'are', 'extras', 'present', 'release', 'however', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'here', 'film', 'being', 'budget', 'release', 'actually', 'get', 'awful', 'lot', 'film', 'money.If', 'are', 'looking', 'emotion', 'filled', 'yet', 'realistic', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'complete', 'excellent', 'acting', 'lead', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'then', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'also', 'probably', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'ultimately', 'cope', 'should', 'same', 'situation', 'occur.Almost', 'mini', 'classic', 'certain', 'nice', 'see', 'less', 'remembered', 'titles', 'finding', 'way', 'Blu-ray', 'hopefully', 'other', 'lesser', 'known', 'movies', 'will', 'now', 'follow', 'suit', 'Two', 'cops', 'take', 'just', 'made', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'lives', 'framed', 'innocent', 'man', 'BLU', 'REVIEW', 'OBSCURA', 'reviews', 'less', 'mainstream', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'find', 'Facebook']",N/A

I wasn't all that thrilled. As others have noted, the story revolves around Tom Selleck, who is an all around good dude who gets framed by a couple of crooked narcs to cover up the fact they screwed up and tried to bust the wrong guy. He goes to prison and his life is changed forever.First off, this looks and sounds like a made for TV kind of flick. The script and dialogue are pedestrian at best. Tom Selleck is likable enough but he isn't the greatest actor in the world and doesn't bring much to the roll. The opening scenes on through the trial are pretty God awful. They just don't hold up by today's sensibilities. Anyone in the audience could have done a better job of defending him in court than did his lawyer. It's just all so lame. Things do pick up a bit when he gets to prison, but again, we all know through any number of movies and TV shows that it's a lot worse in the joint than pictured here. What is cool is to see is David Rasch in one of his earlier performances as well as F. Murray Abraham in his pre-fame part.When he gets out, and feels forced to bring down the bad cops, things get bad again. It is one of the worst sting operations you'll ever see. And while it's always cool to see good triumph over evil, it needed to be way more cool.It moves at a rather brisk pace so, even at 113 minutes, time moves steadily enough.

A good job,  leadership skills, a beautiful wife Kate (Laila Robins) who he loves and who is trying to improve herself.  They are planning for kids.  A little less perfect might make this film more interesting but the start of this movie is making a statement: these two people have done nothing wrong.  Meanwhile two out of control cops are prowling the neighborhood busting drug users, selling and using themselves.  Mike and Danny both slightly over act their parts, especially Danny with his gold chains and bulging eyeballs.  They are a couple of reptiles from a crack in the ground if there ever was a pair.  Hence they misread a tip on a location and arrive at Jimmie's house.  Weapons drawn they drop the door and drop Jimmie who is armed with a hair dryer.  Upon recovery Jimmie discovers he is being tried for possession of cocaine and attempting to shoot a police officer.After a trial Jimmie is convicted, due to  Mike and Danny spitting lies from the witness stand.  This is a rotting example of criminal justice.  Hence Jimmie is guilty and sent to prison for 6 Years.This movie gives a version of prison life as a caldron of anger, contempt, rape, and severe racism.  Jingles seems to be the center of trouble.  Jingles (Bruce Young) plays a very effective hardened felon who is as tough as they come.  He continually mocks and bullies Jimmie.  The movie becomes even more serious as the audience becomes aware someone is going to get killed  Watch and see this very intense section of the film.So Jimmie gets paroled.  I noticed through the remainder of the film Jimmie does not reveal to Kate he has killed someone in prison.  I think this is a flaw in the film.  All he says to Kate is ""you don't know me anymore.""  The movie misses a test of love a potential for some excellent scenes.  I waited the last quarter of the movie for him to tell her.Mike and Danny are on the scene when Jimmie comes home.  These two cops are a couple of clowns and show up at the house insulting Kate and Jimmie due to their fear of being caught which lead to the climax of the movie.  The final scenes are a kind of rat race, but over all I very much enjoyed this film and will watch it often. Go see it!

I saw this film several times in the first few years after it came out and enjoyed it immensely each time.  I bought the Blu-ray because the price was right  (I already owned the DVD but hadn't watched it in perhaps a decade).I guess after years of watching superlative crime dramas like ""The Wire"" and ""The Shield"", ""An Innocent Man"" now seems a bit tame and under-written by comparison.  That should not, however, be too much of a criticism.  For what it is, ""An Innocent Man"" is well done, well acted, and done with earnestness.  I was a much younger and less cynical person when I first watched this movie, and it was perfect for its day.

736145,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00008978T,Joseph Haschka,"[12, 12]","Innocent? Yes, aren't we all? But in AN INNOCENT MAN, Jimmie Rainwood (Tom Selleck) really is, albeit a presumably highly paid one as a senior mechanic on the aircraft maintenance line of American Airlines in Southern California.  Married to Kate (Laila Robins) and living in a hillside house with a view of Los Angeles-San Pedro Harbor, Jimmie has the good life. That is, until he runs afoul of two corrupt drug squad detectives from the local constabulary, Parnell (David Rasche) and Scalise (Richard Young), who supplement their income partnering with a major narcotics supplier, stealing from competing dealers, and selling the goods to their patron. Mistakenly led to believe that a deal is going down at Rainwood's home, they bust in while Jimmie is home alone finishing up a shower. Parnell and Scalise shoot Rainwood thinking the hair dryer he's holding is a weapon. Realizing their mistake, they cover their tracks by planting drugs in the home and a gun in Jimmie's hand, with which he ostensibly took a shot at the officers. Ultimately, Rainwood angrily refuses to plead guilty to lesser charges to get a reduced sentence, and a jury trial results in six years in the state pen.While incarcerated, Jimmie must thrust aside inhibitions and learn how to literally kill to survive. He does this under the tutelage of fellow con and self-admitted criminal, Virgil Cane (F. Murray Abraham), also put away by Parnell and Scalise, though they beat up Cane's girlfriend during the process of the arrest.  Eventually, Rainwood is let out on parole after three years. Returning home, he and Kate continue to be oppressed by the two crooked cops, and Jimmie falls back on his hard-won survival skills to break himself and his wife free.My Mom recommended AN INNOCENT MAN since, in her former capacity as a staff psychiatrist for the Nevada Department of Corrections, she worked out of the men's prison in Carson City, where the exterior shots of Jimmie's lock-up were shot. If you've ever been to Nevada's state capitol, you'll recognize the adjacent Sierra Nevada range in the film. (The interior shots were apparently filmed at a disused prison in Cincinnati, OH - no mountains there.)Now, the corrupt cop Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) in the 2001 filmTraining Daywas one bad dude. Here, the Parnell and Scalise characters, while dangerous, are played as obnoxious wise guys almost to the point of caricature; Rasche and Young rendered them positively annoying by overacting, which is probably why Washington is an ""A List"" performer while the latter two aren't and never will be. At the other end of the spectrum is Detective Fitzgerald (Badja Djola) of Internal Affairs, who sympathizes with Kate's and Jimmie's dilemma and knows Parnell and Scalise are dirty, but can't prove it. Djola's performance is about as animated as a wooden hitching post.Kate Rainwood, played competently by Robins, is believable and sympathetic as Jimmie's loyal wife, but her character is essentially tangential. The best supporting performance is undoubtedly by Abraham as the wily, prison-savvy Cane, whose motive for helping Rainwood is mostly inscrutable until the film's end when the payback Virgil is now enabled to deliver is delicious in the audience's contemplation.Tom Selleck reminds me of John Wayne. The Duke never really acted; any role he played was essentially John Wayne dressed in a different costume. Wayne was, in my opinion a superlative entertainer, but not a great actor. Selleck, I think, falls into this same category. The majority of his movies are class B flicks more suitable for television, but his on-screen characters are so consistently engaging and attractive - perhaps accurately reflecting Tom himself - that I'd rather watch any one of his efforts than a substandard outing by a Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. For Selleck's presence alone, I'm awarding AN INNOCENT MAN four stars.There's one aspect of the film that continues to niggle at my mind. At the conclusion, Jimmie packs a pistol that evolves in the plot as the one placed in his unconscious hand by Parnell and Scalise during the original frame-up three years previous. How did Rainwood come into its possession? Wouldn't it have been confiscated as evidence, and then destroyed by the police after his conviction?",4,Mild-mannered John Q.
