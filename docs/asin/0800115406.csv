He portrays a country singing star who returns to his hometownof Seymour, Indiana, and soon is wronging his wife, played by sexyMariel Hemingway.  Mellencamp's dad and grandpa, played by the wonderful""redneck"" actors, Claude Akins and Dub Taylor, are seriously oversexed,and the curse has descended down to him.  Everyone despises his weakness,himself most of all.  Mellencamp resolves his guilt in the most idioticway imaginable.  Don't try this at home!I like the verisimilitude of this southern Indiana-shot movie.  Youwill savor the porches and kitchens, chicken farm, fishin' creek,roller rink, shot 'n' beer joint, and breakfast diner, where mean ClaudeAkins delivers a big plate o' beat-up.  Look for folksinger John Prineas Mellencamp's brother-in-law.  Some critics have roasted Mellencamp'sperformance; I think he is adequately natural.

Plus, the script came from Larry McMurtry, author of ""Lonesome Dove"", ""The Last Picture Show"", etc.The good stuff first: Mellencamp proves himself to be an adequate director.Surprisingly, for a first time out, it's a perfectly fine directorial debut. Nothing flashy...actually it's anti-flashy, befitting the material. No major screw-ups. Close-up, two-shot, pan...it's fine.He definitely has screen presence, if not real acting chops. He's fine for the role he's in, yet you can see (or feel) the hesitation before lines; he knows when he's supposed to come in...he moves well, but you still get the feeling he's ""reading"" his lines.His grandfather is a hoot, and his father malevolent enough for what happens in the film.Overall though, the movie isn't terribly good. Much of the acting from the other characters seemed forced; the line reading flat. Other characters barely existed at all. There are a lot of characters, by the way. Bud Parks (Mellencamp) has a wife (Mariel Hemingway) and a daughter. He's visiting from Hollywood, as he's a huge country star coming home to visit. He's got a brother, married to Bud's old high school girlfriend (Kay Lenz). They have a passel of kids. He's got a sister, married to some guy, and they have money problems. He's got an illegitimate but widely acknowledged half-brother, who appears to be most close to him. He has a mom, a grandmother, a father and a grandfather...none of whom are divorced, yet spend no time with each other. There's a friend/caretaker/employee or two (or three). Most of the men are clearly scum. Most of the women are saintly, with a few marked exceptions.The Southern Gothic aspect of the script I didn't think worked. The actors didn't make me believe they could do the things they did. Does that make sense?Sometimes in a film, characters do unrealistic things, but because of the craft of acting, screenwriting...of filmmaking...you get so carried away that it doesn't matter.Better yet, those supposedly ""unrealistic"" things become possible, even ""real.""None of this happened here.Here's the thing: I love Mellencamp, and actually think he could really be something on screen. There is that something about him that works. It's just that here there are too many things that don't work here...and by the time the film was over (100 minutes, but due to it's deliberate pacing, felt like twice that) I just didn't give a hoot about any of them.",3,An OK first movie...,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,2506,"['bought', 'film', ""'m"", 'big', 'Mellencamp', 'fan', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'praised', 'highly', 'script', 'came', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'author', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'etc.The', 'good', 'stuff', 'first', 'Mellencamp', 'be', 'adequate', 'director.Surprisingly', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Nothing', 'flashy', 'actually', 'anti-flashy', 'befitting', 'material', 'major', 'screw-ups', 'Close-up', 'two-shot', 'pan', 'fine.He', 'definitely', 'screen', 'presence', 'not', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'fine', 'role', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'hesitation', 'lines', 'when', 'supposed', 'come', 'well', 'still', 'get', 'feeling', 'reading', 'lines.His', 'grandfather', 'hoot', 'father', 'malevolent', 'enough', 'what', 'film.Overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'good', 'Much', 'acting', 'other', 'characters', 'seemed', 'forced', 'line', 'reading', 'flat', 'Other', 'characters', 'barely', 'existed', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'way', 'Bud', 'Parks', 'Mellencamp', 'wife', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'daughter', 'visiting', 'Hollywood', 'huge', 'country', 'star', 'coming', 'home', 'visit', 'got', 'brother', 'married', 'Bud', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'have', 'passel', 'kids', 'got', 'sister', 'married', 'guy', 'have', 'money', 'problems', 'got', 'illegitimate', 'widely', 'acknowledged', 'half-brother', 'who', 'be', 'most', 'close', 'mom', 'grandmother', 'father', 'grandfather', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'divorced', 'yet', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'friend/caretaker/employee', 'two', 'three', 'Most', 'men', 'are', 'clearly', 'scum', 'Most', 'women', 'are', 'saintly', 'few', 'marked', 'exceptions.The', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'aspect', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'believe', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'characters', 'do', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'craft', 'acting', 'screenwriting', 'filmmaking', 'get', 'so', 'carried', 'away', ""n't"", 'matter.Better', 'yet', 'supposedly', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'become', 'possible', 'even', 'real', 'None', 'happened', 'thing', 'love', 'Mellencamp', 'actually', 'think', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'something', 'screen', 'something', 'just', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'time', 'film', 'was', '100', 'minutes', 'due', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'felt', 'twice', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'hoot']",N/A

161937,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0800115406,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","That's what ""Falling from Grace"" (1992) is about. John (Cougar) Mellencamp plays a country star who tries to come home to Indiana, bringing his tall blond wife (Mariel Hemingway) and daughter. Unfortunately, his dad's a total jerk (Claude Akins) and his high school sweetheart (Kay Lenz) is married to his brother and having an affair with someone linked to both. It seems like the star just wants to take a break from the show business and hang with his buds, like the old days, but melancholy settles in and temptation strikes.Wow, after seeing this my wife and I gave thanks for our dysfunctional families -- we never knew we had it so good!This is a solid drama by first-and-only-time director Mellencamp. All the main players noted above do fine in their roles, but some of the side players are flat and unconvincing.The film was shot in Seymour, Indiana, John's hometown, and runs 100 minutes.FINAL WORD: Although I rate the film slighly higher than average, noted critic Roger Ebert gives it his top rating, just to give you some perspective. IMHO the film is dragged down by the country star's mopiness, which is fundamental to the story -- I understand -- but it's still frustrating for the viewer. Yet I like the note it ends on and there are definitely some gems to mine from the proceedings, like ""the sins of the father"" and the negative domino effect of unfaithfulness.GRADE: C+ or B-",3,Your hometown after making it big,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1398,"['what', 'Falling', 'Grace', '1992', 'about', 'John', 'Cougar', 'Mellencamp', 'country', 'star', 'who', 'come', 'home', 'Indiana', 'bringing', 'tall', 'blond', 'wife', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'daughter', 'Unfortunately', 'dad', 'total', 'jerk', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'married', 'brother', 'having', 'affair', 'someone', 'linked', 'star', 'just', 'take', 'break', 'show', 'business', 'hang', 'buds', 'old', 'days', 'melancholy', 'settles', 'temptation', 'strikes.Wow', 'seeing', 'wife', 'gave', 'thanks', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'so', 'good', 'solid', 'drama', 'first-and-only-time', 'director', 'Mellencamp', 'main', 'players', 'noted', 'do', 'fine', 'roles', 'side', 'players', 'are', 'flat', 'unconvincing.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Seymour', 'Indiana', 'John', 'hometown', '100', 'minutes.FINAL', 'WORD', 'rate', 'film', 'slighly', 'higher', 'average', 'noted', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'top', 'rating', 'just', 'give', 'perspective', 'IMHO', 'film', 'dragged', 'down', 'country', 'star', 'mopiness', 'fundamental', 'story', 'understand', 'still', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'like', 'note', 'are', 'definitely', 'gems', 'mine', 'proceedings', 'sins', 'father', 'negative', 'domino', 'effect', 'unfaithfulness.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",N/A
