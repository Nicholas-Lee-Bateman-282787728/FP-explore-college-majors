694316,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0000639H9,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 5]","The 'Juniper Tree' is a slow, somber, methodical film with a weak storyline which at times becomes almost incoherent. However having said that I will also say that the true beauty of this film is not to be found in the story it tells, but in the visuals. Filmed in Iceland, a place where few of us have ever gone or will go, we get a glimpse of this beautiful and challenging island. Hostile, yet enchanting it appears as a world one can easily imagine to be populated by the mythical beings of Norse mythology, making it a perfect location for a tale of mysticism and witchcraft.Katla (Bryndis Petra Bragadottir) and her younger sister Margit (Bjork) have left their village after their Mother (Guorun Gisladottir) has been burned to death by the villagers for practicing witchcraft. As they wander through the countryside they eventually come upon a small dwelling occupied by a recently widowed man and his son. They take refuge in his home and before long Katla begins to work her magic to win the heart of their unsuspecting benefactor.Unquestionably the best moments in the film are young Margit's disturbing visions of her Mother's spirit. Guorun Gisladottir's long, matted dark hair and flowing, faded clothing are the perfect compliment to the frozen tundra surrounding her. As she sits silently amongst the protruding rocks she strikes a chilling pose in harmony with the stark, evocative Icelandic landscape.This is not a film that stands up well to repeated viewings, but it has its moments. Now if you're a big Bjork fan that's a different story.",3,Dark Vision In The Frozen Tundra,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,1559,"[""'Juniper"", 'Tree', 'slow', 'somber', 'methodical', 'film', 'weak', 'storyline', 'times', 'becomes', 'almost', 'incoherent', 'However', 'having', 'said', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'true', 'beauty', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'story', 'visuals', 'Filmed', 'Iceland', 'place', 'where', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'gone', 'will', 'go', 'get', 'glimpse', 'beautiful', 'challenging', 'island', 'Hostile', 'yet', 'enchanting', 'world', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'be', 'populated', 'mythical', 'beings', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'making', 'perfect', 'location', 'tale', 'mysticism', 'witchcraft.Katla', 'Bryndis', 'Petra', 'Bragadottir', 'younger', 'sister', 'Margit', 'Bjork', 'have', 'left', 'village', 'Mother', 'Guorun', 'Gisladottir', 'been', 'burned', 'death', 'villagers', 'practicing', 'witchcraft', 'wander', 'countryside', 'eventually', 'come', 'small', 'dwelling', 'occupied', 'recently', 'widowed', 'man', 'son', 'take', 'refuge', 'home', 'long', 'Katla', 'work', 'magic', 'win', 'heart', 'unsuspecting', 'benefactor.Unquestionably', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'young', 'Margit', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'Mother', 'spirit', 'Guorun', 'Gisladottir', 'long', 'matted', 'dark', 'hair', 'flowing', 'faded', 'clothing', 'are', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'surrounding', 'silently', 'protruding', 'chilling', 'pose', 'harmony', 'stark', 'evocative', 'Icelandic', 'landscape.This', 'not', 'film', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'moments', 'Now', ""'re"", 'big', 'Bjork', 'fan', 'different', 'story']",N/A

I ended up liking this movie for more than Bjork's presence, although I would recommend to anyone who loves her.Filmed in Iceland in black and white, its mood is desolate and somewhat foreboding. Stark, lots of wind. I was horrified by one scene in particular which involved Katla (the older sister) and Jonas (Katla's stepson). A gruesome, loose remake of a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. The music was quite mystical and added to the eerie atmosphere, bright nights and all. Interesting mix of Christianity and Paganism. Bjork's character (Margit) recites the Lord's Prayer and also has creepy visions of her mother. The grave of Jonas' mother is in the shape of a cross; Katla is most disturbing with her calm voice, spells, and collection of magical accessories.**I was interested in learning the significance of the juniper tree, and I found that it has a long history, frequently associated with purity and protection. The opening quotation of the movie is very appropriate: ""Under a juniper-tree the bones sang, scattered and shining..."" (T.S. Eliot).

Bjork is accepted after a trial period by the son, but the sister attempts her own witchcraft on his father, which seems to work.  The son catches on fast, he wants to know where Bjork and her sister come from, Bjork does not give him a straight answer just comments ""somewhere far away, that does not exist anymore"", this film will take your imagination far into the past.

And grim it is.  Bjork is Margit.  When her mother is burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft, she and her older sister Katla flee across Iceland's rugged terrain until they reach the remote farmhouse owned by handsome widower Johann. Katla casts a seductive spell on Johann and bewitches him.  Soon they are wed, much to the dismay of Johann's suspicious young son Jonas who sees clearly what has happened to his dad.  Things get increasingly tense and Margit is forced into the spiritual world to save Jonas from Katla's supernatural wrath.This dark, brooding mystical tale is nicely visualized and Bjork is a natural actress.

Filmed in black and white, this movie tells the story of two witch sisters who flee after their mother is burned for practicing witchcraft. The movie is based on a story by the Grimm Brothers.Even though the movie has a couple of good moments, it is not a dark tale of mysticism as the cover of the DVD tries to sell, in fact it is too slow and the strange way in which it is edited does not help at all. Had it been a shorter film with only the key points it might have been a better film. Bjork's performance is quite decent but nothing more and so are the rest of the actors in this film.The movie is presented in full screen and on a not so good digital transfer, no subtitles are available.
