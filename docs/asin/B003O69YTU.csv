A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 10]","""Spiderman"" + a bit of ""Iron Man"" +a flying car = ""Black Lightning.""That's the basic formula for ""Black Lightning,"" a Russian blockbuster about a boy with a flying car. It follows the same distinct pattern, but has an odd, enthusiastic charm of its own -- the lead actor gives it all he's got, and the whole idea of a superpowered car that can actually FLY just charms the inner child.Teenage Dima (Grigoriy Dobrygin) is given a rather battered Volga for his birthday -- and he soon discovers that it can fly. As he digs up the car's past as part of a failed Soviet experiment, he also uses it to become the highest-paid delivery boy in all of Moscow. But his selfish behavior quickly alienates his crush Nastya (Ekaterina Vilkova), and even leads to the death of a family member.Devastated, Dima decides to use the Volga to help those who can't help themselves. Soon the flying car known as ""Black Lightning"" is the talk of Russia, though Dima stays determinedly anonymous. But unknown to him, a billionaire is determined to get his hands on Black Lightning's power source, since he wants to activate a vast drill that could destroy the entire city...I honestly shouldn't have liked ""Black Lightning"" as much as I did -- the plot is much the same as ""Spider-Man,"" with an ""Iron Man"" twist near the finale. But there's just something very charming about this movie -- maybe it's just the idea of a car that can fly, and the childlike enthusiasm that it seems to have for the idea.And directors Dmitriy Kiselev and Aleksandr Voytinskiy seem to be having fun -- they mingle some exquisitely poetic moments (rose petals raining on Nastya) with high-octane aerial action and wild building-smashing kidnappings. This stuff is pure comic book fun, with no pretenses to be anything more. The flattest part of the movie is the villain's motivation -- he does have one, but it's kind of bland.Dobrygin gives a pitch-perfect performance as Dima -- he runs the gamut from selfish/snotty to guilt-ridden/heroic, and he does a solid job depicting the uncertainty, pride and pitfalls of teenage life. Vilkova does a decent job with her limited ""love interest"" role, and there are a number of nice smaller performances for the elderly scientists, the mad businessman, and Dima's loving dad. But not Dima's sister. She creeps me out.While it's redolent of American blockbusters, ""Black Lightning"" has an earnest charm of its own -- solid acting, solid action, and a flying car.

1356059,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003O69YTU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","BLACK LIGHTNING (""Shornae Molneh"", but inexplicably transliterated as ""Chernaya Molniya"" 2008/2009/2010) is one of the best Russian films I have ever watched. I've seen as much as possible, from IVAN'S CHILDHOOD to DERSU UZALA (vid. my review), to some stuff so recent I can't recall the titles. I also saw a very recent documentary talking about the desperation of Russians - with crime and economy woes, they want the monarchy back.BLACK LIGHTNING is a direct argument against all that; it is a tonic for a sad, weary nation. A 21-year-old college kid named Dmitri (a spectacularly lovely and charismatic young man named Grigory Dobrygin, watch out for this guy in the future) is given a rather ugly car for his birthday: a 1968 Volga GAZ-21. Imagine the shock when Dmitri - nicknamed ""Dima"" in the film - discovers his car is a super-powered flying 'jet car'.At first, Dima wants only to impress with his incredible money-earning skills (flowery delivery boys apparently can get rich pretty quickly in Moscow). Soon he finds that helping others, as his tram-driver father has tried to teach him, is the secret of life. Unfortunately he has a run-in with a supervillain who wants to destroy Moscow's geologic foundations in his greedy search for diamonds.Dima becomes famous as the anonymous superhero ""Black Lightning"" (Shornae Molneh, hence the film's title). Sure, there is homage to the likes of BUCKAROO BANZAI, BATMAN (vid. my reviews), and UNBREAKABLE with some BACK TO THE FUTURE flying car action. That is expected. What is a pleasure and a delight is this film tends toward a specific set of goals, is efficient, incredibly fun and easy on the eyes.There is a spectacular goof in the logic of the events, but I will leave that for you to find - it isn't really obvious.I will leave it there and only add that this family film, Disneyesque though it may be, is incredible. It has excellent action, special effects, the scenery/locations are terrific, and BOY! - can these Russians act! They always did have a thing or two to teach us about cinema. It makes me happy they're coming back onto the silver screen once again.Also, kudos to Universal and Focus Features International for bringing us this gem, which dates from 2009 (but it has a copyright of 2008, was originally released in Kazakhstan in 2009, released in the U.S. in 2010 and the DVD was just issued here). Kudos to directors Dmitri Kiselev (the incredible films DAY WATCH and NIGHT WATCH) and relative newcomer Aleksandr Voytinskiy.This film will drive home the point, as the theme song ""Black Lightning"" says: ""You don't need a car to be a superhero.""",5,"""Just a kid in a flying car?

1356060,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003O69YTU,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","The Russians have a long history in film but I can't say I've ever known them to go for the 'state of the art' populist, mega-movie that Hollywood is so famous for. That seems to have changed recently with the release of such movies as ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch."" ""Black Lightning,"" though not quite as spectacular, continues in that vein.Here's the scoop. Dima, a student, receives an old car as gift from his father. He's not thrilled but finds out the car can fly (among other things). Some turns of events prompt him to use the car to fight evil-doers and maybe win the heart of a fellow student. It turns out the car was an experiment using a great new power source and some bad guys want it back to power drill for diamonds under Moscow, a move that will collapse the city. Can Dima and Black Lightning save the day?This does borrow from better known, comic based films but it has a lot of clever turns of its own in the plot. But as clever as some of these turns might be there are also some plot points that one could easily consider naive. But you do come to like Dima. Here's a guy who is somewhat self absorbed and not very willing to help others. When this selfish trait comes back to bite him in the butt it's nice to see his transformation. He now feels compelled to help others. It's also nice that the flying car allows him to make more flower deliveries and thus earn more money to woo his honey. The effects are as good as they need to be. I'm glad they stayed away from being too spectacular. As much as I liked ""Man of Steel"" and ""Iron Man 3"" these just went on too long with too much. I grew tired and numb by the end. This was much more enjoyable to that end. The performances were decent and fit the tone of the film well. There was one odd side to the story involving three scientists (two men and a woman) who were in on the original project, and there relationship with one another, that seemed odd and unresolved. But, other than that, this pretty tightly written.This is an overall solid and fun effort. For fans of the genre this should go to the top of your list.",4,The Russians are Coming!

Despite this, his father works hard to give him his dream, albeit not quite as extravagantly executed as he had hoped.His dream gift turns out to be an old relic, a crappy 1950's vehicle that's seen it's better days by more than few decades. However, unbeknownst to the kid, the old wreck has a hidden secret - it was fitted with a revolutionary power system designed during the height of the cold war. And said power system allows the car to *fly*. Sort of a non-leathal nuclear version ofFlubber.He then uses the flying car to make extra money for his family by delivering flowers across Moscow (in broad daylight no less!), woo the beautiful girl, and believe it or not - fight the mafia.Not the pitch that will be made into a major film, an inexpensive scifi tv series maybe, but not a film. No way.But in Russia - way. :-)Had a pretty good time with this. I'm not going to say that 'Black Lightning' will become the next installment of a Marvel or DC franchise, but it's definitely not time wasted. The story of Dima and his Russian-made Volga captures the heart of every child - the dream of flying and becoming a superhero.Good clean fun and great for young kids. Well, as long as they can read subtitles or speak Russian. And maybe, given that this is clearly intended for the young, one of the few times I will ever suggest audio dubbing as a means to enjoy a film.",4,"An Unconventional and Refreshing ""Superhero"" Flick",1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1896,"['As', 'silly', 'found', 'superhero', 'flick', 'entertaining.An', 'unconventional', 'refreshing', 'concept', 'more', 'so', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'almost', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'number-crunchers', 'Seriously', 'can', 'imagine', 'trying', 'pitch', 'studio', 'kid', 'Spiderman', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'skinny', 'poor', 'unpopular', 'greatest', 'dream', 'own', 'car', 'mostly', 'impress', 'girl', 'school', 'problem', 'impoverished', 'family', 'girl', 'being', 'wooed', 'very', 'wealthy', 'friend', 'father', 'hard', 'give', 'dream', 'not', 'quite', 'extravagantly', 'executed', 'had', 'hoped.His', 'dream', 'gift', 'out', 'be', 'old', 'relic', 'crappy', '1950', 'vehicle', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'more', 'few', 'decades', 'However', 'unbeknownst', 'kid', 'old', 'wreck', 'hidden', 'secret', 'was', 'fitted', 'revolutionary', 'power', 'system', 'designed', 'height', 'cold', 'war', 'said', 'power', 'system', 'car', '*fly*', 'Sort', 'non-leathal', 'nuclear', 'version', 'ofFlubber.He', 'then', 'flying', 'car', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'family', 'delivering', 'flowers', 'Moscow', 'broad', 'daylight', 'less', 'woo', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'believe', 'not', 'fight', 'mafia.Not', 'pitch', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'major', 'film', 'inexpensive', 'scifi', 'tv', 'series', 'maybe', 'not', 'film', 'way.But', 'Russia', 'way', 'Had', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', ""'Black"", 'Lightning', 'will', 'become', 'next', 'installment', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'franchise', 'definitely', 'not', 'time', 'wasted', 'story', 'Dima', 'Russian-made', 'Volga', 'heart', 'child', 'dream', 'flying', 'becoming', 'superhero.Good', 'clean', 'fun', 'great', 'young', 'kids', 'Well', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'read', 'subtitles', 'speak', 'Russian', 'maybe', 'given', 'clearly', 'intended', 'young', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'will', 'ever', 'suggest', 'audio', 'dubbing', 'means', 'enjoy', 'film']",Black Lightning

Set in Moscow, it is a Russian take on that favorite American movie genre - the teen romance thriller. Our protagonist is a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has his eye on a beautiful young university student - (and she is beautiful, makes you wonder why they can't find young girls this hot for the American versions) who finds himself embroiled in a dangerous mystery when he happens upon an old car that can fly by way of a super secret and now dangerous technology - that our antagonist will do anything - including murder - to get back. Think Russian Mafia meets Peter Parker and all with a PG-13 rating. Shot well, with an interesting back drop if you have never seen modern Moscow, and with a solid cast of proven actors who do a nice job.",4,A Russian Teen Romance Thriller,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,812,"['3.5', 'Stars', 'fun', 'not', 'too', 'serious', 'film', 'Set', 'Moscow', 'Russian', 'take', 'favorite', 'American', 'movie', 'genre', 'teen', 'romance', 'thriller', 'protagonist', 'young', 'man', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'young', 'university', 'student', 'beautiful', 'wonder', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'young', 'girls', 'hot', 'American', 'versions', 'who', 'embroiled', 'dangerous', 'mystery', 'when', 'old', 'car', 'can', 'fly', 'way', 'super', 'secret', 'now', 'dangerous', 'technology', 'antagonist', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'murder', 'get', 'back', 'Think', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'meets', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Shot', 'well', 'interesting', 'back', 'drop', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'modern', 'Moscow', 'solid', 'cast', 'proven', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'nice', 'job']",Black Lightning

Just keep in mind that this movie is basically the Russian spiderman; nothing wrong with that but you'll notice the similarities early on (a lot of the first spiderman movie and a little from the second).  I could sit here mentioning the similarities but I won't, this movie stands well enough that you'll enjoy watching it despite the fact that it feels familiar.  It's unrated but it has a family movie vibe...not a lot of violence and I don't remember anything vulgar.
