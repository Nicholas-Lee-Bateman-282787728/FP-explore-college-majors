550350,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004TJGZ,"""flickjunkie""","[6, 14]","The Cold War is over and two adversarial spies (Bill Pullman and Irene Jacob) fall in love and dream of living a normal life.  There is trouble in paradise, however, since they find themselves on opposite sides of an attempt to pass satellite codes to the Russians encoded into a homemade porno film.  This is a good premise for an international thriller, but the execution does a belly flop.This film was produced in Finland to very low filmmaking standards.  Since I haven't seen many Finnish films, I can't say whether this is typical or atypical, but it was full of bad scene setups, plot inconsistencies and generally poor directing.  The soundtrack was jazzy and nice, but it often didn't fit with the scenes to which it was applied.Director Ilkka Jarvi-Laturi was trying to present this as a lighthearted romantic comedy and international thriller, but it was marginal on the first count and a disaster on the second.  Bill Pullman can carry off the lovable romantic hero role, but as a spy, he is a joke.  Irene Jacob was better at handling the two aspects of the role, but the dialogue was so excruciating that her acting talent and beauty were not enough to save it.Jacob and Pullman had some chemistry in the romantic scenes, but both seemed flummoxed in the comedic espionage scenes.  This was some incredibly bad writing and it must have been very difficult for these actors to say their lines without kecking.This film is a jumbled mess with terrible writing and amateurish direction.  I rated it a 4/10.  Be sure to miss it.",2,A jumbled mess,972000000,"10 20, 2000",2000,1539,"['Cold', 'War', 'two', 'adversarial', 'spies', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'fall', 'love', 'dream', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'trouble', 'paradise', 'however', 'find', 'opposite', 'sides', 'attempt', 'pass', 'satellite', 'codes', 'Russians', 'encoded', 'homemade', 'porno', 'film', 'good', 'premise', 'international', 'thriller', 'execution', 'belly', 'flop.This', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Finland', 'very', 'low', 'filmmaking', 'standards', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'Finnish', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'typical', 'atypical', 'was', 'full', 'bad', 'scene', 'setups', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'generally', 'poor', 'directing', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'jazzy', 'nice', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'scenes', 'was', 'applied.Director', 'Ilkka', 'Jarvi-Laturi', 'was', 'trying', 'present', 'lighthearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'international', 'thriller', 'was', 'marginal', 'first', 'count', 'disaster', 'second', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'can', 'carry', 'off', 'lovable', 'romantic', 'hero', 'role', 'spy', 'joke', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'was', 'better', 'handling', 'two', 'aspects', 'role', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'excruciating', 'acting', 'talent', 'beauty', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'it.Jacob', 'Pullman', 'had', 'chemistry', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'flummoxed', 'comedic', 'espionage', 'scenes', 'was', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'writing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'actors', 'say', 'lines', 'kecking.This', 'film', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'terrible', 'writing', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'rated', '4/10', 'Be', 'sure', 'miss']",Spy Games

This is the type of film that would include a very naked (and very unerotic) porn scene and play it again and again. In fact, this movie does exactly that.There's no suspense. No intellectual content. And there's no chemistry at all -- especially between the two leads, boy-next-door Pullman and delicious Ir&egrave;ne Jacob -- who successfully overlays her French accent with a Russian one. (At least, Irene's nudity is done tastefully...more or less...)This movie aimed high and hit itself in the pebbles.",1,Pebble high,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,590,"[""so-clever-it's-confusing"", 'script', 'good', 'actors', 'locations', 'direction', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'include', 'very', 'naked', 'very', 'unerotic', 'porn', 'scene', 'play', 'again', 'again', 'fact', 'movie', 'exactly', 'suspense', 'intellectual', 'content', 'chemistry', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'boy-next-door', 'Pullman', 'delicious', 'Ir', 'egrave', 'Jacob', 'who', 'successfully', 'French', 'accent', 'Russian', 'one', 'least', 'Irene', 'nudity', 'done', 'tastefully', 'more', 'less', 'movie', 'aimed', 'high', 'hit', 'pebbles']",Spy Games

550353,A2BAO19YDCWUIF,B00004TJGZ,Patty Howell,"[6, 10]","Although I rated the movie 2 stars, I give 5 stars to the soundtrack. The plot of the movie was extremely spastic. The scenarios jumped around so much, without much cohesion, that one feels like they are spending most of  the movie trying to discern what is going on and where it is leading. I  enjoy movies with complicated plots, but somewhere along the line they need  to be tied together. In my opinion, this one did not. I only watch movies  over again when I have really enjoyed them. When this movie was over, I  felt like I needed to watch it again to figure out the whole purpose.  HOWEVER, this movie is worth watching solely for the purpose of listening  to the 5.1 soundtrack. It has one of the best audio musical formats I have  heard in a movie. In fact, sometimes the music overpowered the dialog,  which, in the case of this movie, was just as well.",2,Spy Games,963964800,"07 19, 2000",2000,865,"['rated', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'soundtrack', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'spastic', 'scenarios', 'jumped', 'so', 'much', 'much', 'cohesion', 'one', 'feels', 'are', 'spending', 'most', 'movie', 'trying', 'discern', 'what', 'going', 'where', 'leading', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'complicated', 'plots', 'somewhere', 'line', 'need', 'be', 'tied', 'together', 'opinion', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'watch', 'movies', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'needed', 'watch', 'again', 'figure', 'out', 'whole', 'purpose', 'HOWEVER', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'solely', 'purpose', 'listening', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'best', 'audio', 'musical', 'formats', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'music', 'overpowered', 'dialog', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'well']",Spy Games
