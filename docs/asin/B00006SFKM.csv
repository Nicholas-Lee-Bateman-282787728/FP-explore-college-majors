But having seen it on the Independent Film Channel I subsequently bought a copy online and watched it again with the same delight as the first go around.Vincent D'onofrio plays Sam, a man from the future (Dubuque, Iowa on the Atlantic Coast to be specific) who after some tragic events in the future has broken the time-space continuum and traveled back some 400 years to find his one true love Ruby, whose picture he found in a curio shop. After a &quot;chance encounter&quot; in a park in NYC where they strike up a conversation and Sam entertains her, he seeks to find where she lives to return a book that she has forgotten on the park bench. The love-shy Ruby, who has had her share of &quot;losers&quot; in the past, is aloof when he approaches her but all the same curious of who this strange man is. To skip giving away any of the plot-line and formation, they begin a romantic relationship. But as the eccentric time-traveller starts to display odd and suspicious physical and personality traits, the neurotic Ruby begins to think that he is playing her for a fool. She confides finally in a therapist and after many see-saw episodes between the couple she believes that she must leave him. To keep her love he slowly uncovers the truth about who he really is. From this the main thrust of the movie becomes encapsuled in a simple futuristic ideal: Cheeseman's Emotional Energy Theory, which holds that if you can concentrate enough emotional energy on a particular moment in time you can alter the past and create a new future. Thus Sam has come back to save Ruby and himself from their tragic lots in life.The strange sci-fi aspect of this romantic comedy is what fuels it to excellence and keeps it from becoming the prototypical toothy-actor &quot;loser&quot; meets the Hollywood starlett &quot;princess&quot; which normally plagues the genre. D'onofrio, though sometimes an over-actor, is always believable and sincere in his performances unlike a Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford, who no matter what they do, we are cognizant of the fact that they are mega-stars playing a part. Sam is real and likeable and thus the storyline becomes engrossing and brilliantly devised. Marisa Tomei, who I have never really thought twice about, is equally supportive and performs well and to the extreme which obliterates anything hackneyed or cliched about the film.

The chemistry between the characters is magic and the casting is flawless ,although I never would have thought of these two as a perfect pairing .Always a sucker for time travel , this piqued my interest .

Those two issues aside (which I'll deal with in time, I promise), this was a way better romantic/comedy/drama than I have seen in a long time.  It's formulatic to a point of course, but other than that it is so much better and more entertaining than any of those Roberts/Witherspoon/Ryan escapades.  The idea of lovers meeting via 'supposed' time travel sets an interesting scene, and creates much more interesting obstacles for the two main characters to overcome.

She details the sad story of her love life to her therapist, played by the always good Holland Taylor. Into Ruby's life walks Sam, a strange fellow who seems to just happen into her life (a touch of Serendipity perhaps?).  Sam claims to be from Dubuque Iowa, but Ruby soon learns that he is from Dubuque all right, but Dubuque in the year 2470.  Thinking that Sam is mentally deranged, Ruby plays along and soon the game becomes all too real.  She is torn between wanting to get rid of this nut to the genuine feelings she has for him.  All the while, she reports on the various incidents to her therapist.San's mission is soon made clear (to tell it would ruin the ending).  Suffice to say that there is a reason for him to be in Ruby's life.  He must break the space-time continuum (didn't Doc Brown warn against this in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;?)One of the beauties of this movie is that the writers were able to create a new world that is real to Sam but seems bizarre to the rest of us.  It soon becomes appearent that this world is not so crazy after all and besides, who are we to dsimiss the unknown becuse it doesn't seem real to us.  If you buy the idea of time travel you will enjoy this movie.The writers apparently decided how they wanted the movie to end and seemed to have worked backwards to get there.  You can tell the ending from a mile off.  And it looks as if they made it up as they went along, which is ok because it fits in with Sam's dilemma of trying to sell this fascinating tale to Ruby.As noted, Holland Taylor provides wonderful support and plays a pivotal role in the story.  Also excelling is Nadia Dajani (from various character roles and the TV series Ned and Stacey).  Anthony Micheal Hall also makes a cameo for no apparent reason.  His role could have been played by a thousand different actors.

""Session 9,"" which is about a group of asbestos removers who unravel as they work in the creepy confines of an old insane asylum, is a gripping portrayal of what happens as paranoia sets into the minds of a group of men who once trusted each other. Watch it, it stars David Caruso in his best performance since ""NYPD Blue."" As for film content, the two are not even similar.Anderson stops a scene and turns it into a photograph as the characters tell their stories, and the montages and collages of imagery make you pause and absorb everything that is going on. The scenes where D'Onofrio's eyes glaze over and he watches time go backwards are unique and sometimes moving. This is a film that puts a wholly original twist on two themes we've seen many times before. We have never seen them pulled off like this.

723208,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00006SFKM,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","I actually think this 2001 low-budget, indie film has a quirky charm that's hard to resist, and credit goes to director/writer/editor Brad Andersen's singular filmmaking style. It's ostensibly a contemporary love story between two misfits, but he laces the plot with science fiction elements that seem contrived at first until they start to affect the characters tangibly. The irony is that these far-fetched plot developments are what make the movie resonate emotionally. The two people at the center are Ruby Weaver, a single woman with an unfortunate track record of enabling men to meet her lowest expectations, and Sam Deed, a stranger from Dubuque who may be either mentally ill or a time traveler from the year 2470. Ruby is immediately drawn to Sam's sincerity but when he confesses to coming from the future, she inevitably feels like she is recycling old behavior by trying to save him from his delusions.It reminds me a bit of John Carpenter's 1984 ""Starman"" (where an alien takes the form of a woman's dead husband) and a touch of Hal Ashby's 1979 ""Being There"" (where an insulated gardener tries to make sense of the world around him). However, Anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp on the movie by making Sam's seemingly insane assertions credible and Ruby's attraction alternately frustrating and empathetic. The acting by the two leads helps considerably here. Suffering from premature Oscar ejaculation, Marisa Tomei has slowly recovered her acting credentials, and this performance is among her best as she dexterously brings out all the hesitation and vulnerability in Ruby. As Sam, Vincent D'Onofrio tempers his trademark intensity with a genuine sweetness that makes his child-like wonder believable. Holland Taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona to play Ruby's impervious therapist, while Tovah Feldshuh grounds the film with warmth and sensibility as Ruby's mother. The ending is clever with a nice use of stop-motion photography, even if it felt slightly derivative of the legendary ""Star Trek"" episode where Bones is stopped from saving a peace-loving missionary (played by Joan Collins, of all people) about to be killed.

723209,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00006SFKM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","HAPPY ACCIDENTS (Writ./Dir. Brad Anderson, 2000, 110 minutes) was released in the year that Vincent D'Onofrio's star was rising so fast he made three movies. Here Vincent plays Sam, a time-traveler from the 25th century. Set in 1999, he has returned because of a photo - an image from an accidental-death legal precedent he was researching. Ruby (Marisa Tomei) is the unlucky-in-love NYC girl with whom Sam falls in love. He determines he'll return in time and save her from her death.What struck me as odd about this film is that it could have been made in the 1970s, and seemed to have been deliberately made that way. Something between cheap and corner-cutting happens in this film reminiscent of the dumb films and television of the 1970s. I suppose it was a budget thing, since the year 2000 was unkind to films like this. It has a slow, boring pace, a bit of humor but certainly not enough, and D'Onofrio here selects the one of his two states of being: childishly goofy. (His other state is severely psychotic.)While it boasts a clever argument about time-travel paradox, includes one of my favorite lines about the nature of time and features a lovely scene with Anthony Michael Hall as himself, it is too much like 2007'sI'll Believe You(see my review), a far superior time-travel sleeper film (which may very well have been a remake of this).To be fair, a large part of the intrinsic beauty of this film is the head-on approach to time travel paradoxes, also handled well by I'LL BELIEVE YOU. This film forces us to look at what may be increasingly common questions, such as the effect of a small deviation from routine on our futures, whether or not changes can affect our future in its totality - or whether all of it is impossible because of the loophole paradoxes we typically imagine. The film does not take the usual sophomoric view, and it is this metaphysical firmness that makes the film work.If you enjoyed the accidents, happy or otherwise, of the infinitely more popular12 Monkeys (Special Edition), you'll certainly enjoy this as a sort of early template. There is an important actor you will recognize here who also had a vital role in MONKEYS. I only reviewed HAPPY ACCIDENTS because I make it my business to review all time-travel films I get to see. Sadly, I missed this when it was new and find it worthwhile. What is it with film and the year 2000 anyway??Could it be that the future really isn't what it used to be?Other films of interest you will like compared to this:The Tomorrow Man,Primer, (see my reviews) andThe Butterfly Effect (Infinifilm Edition). All the films I mentioned here are related, and you will like them if you enjoy time travel paradox-solving stories.",3,"""The future isn't what it used to be."" -Paul Val&eacute;ry",1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,2704,"['HAPPY', 'ACCIDENTS', 'Writ./Dir', 'Brad', 'Anderson', '2000', '110', 'minutes', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'star', 'was', 'rising', 'so', 'fast', 'made', 'three', 'movies', 'Here', 'Vincent', 'Sam', 'time-traveler', '25th', 'century', 'Set', '1999', 'returned', 'photo', 'image', 'accidental-death', 'legal', 'precedent', 'was', 'researching', 'Ruby', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'unlucky-in-love', 'NYC', 'girl', 'whom', 'Sam', 'love', ""'ll"", 'return', 'time', 'save', 'death.What', 'struck', 'odd', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', '1970s', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'deliberately', 'made', 'way', 'Something', 'cheap', 'corner-cutting', 'happens', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'dumb', 'films', 'television', '1970s', 'suppose', 'was', 'budget', 'thing', 'year', '2000', 'was', 'unkind', 'films', 'slow', 'boring', 'pace', 'bit', 'humor', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', ""D'Onofrio"", 'here', 'one', 'two', 'states', 'being', 'childishly', 'goofy', 'other', 'state', 'severely', 'psychotic', 'clever', 'argument', 'time-travel', 'paradox', 'one', 'favorite', 'lines', 'nature', 'time', 'lovely', 'scene', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'too', 'much', ""2007'sI"", ""'ll"", 'Believe', 'see', 'review', 'far', 'superior', 'time-travel', 'sleeper', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'remake', '.To', 'be', 'fair', 'large', 'part', 'intrinsic', 'beauty', 'film', 'head-on', 'approach', 'time', 'travel', 'paradoxes', 'also', 'handled', 'well', ""'LL"", 'BELIEVE', 'YOU', 'film', 'look', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'increasingly', 'common', 'questions', 'such', 'effect', 'small', 'deviation', 'routine', 'futures', 'not', 'changes', 'can', 'affect', 'future', 'totality', 'impossible', 'loophole', 'paradoxes', 'typically', 'imagine', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'usual', 'sophomoric', 'view', 'metaphysical', 'firmness', 'film', 'work.If', 'enjoyed', 'accidents', 'happy', 'otherwise', 'infinitely', 'more', 'popular12', 'Monkeys', 'Special', 'Edition', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'early', 'template', 'important', 'actor', 'will', 'recognize', 'here', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'vital', 'role', 'MONKEYS', 'only', 'reviewed', 'HAPPY', 'ACCIDENTS', 'make', 'business', 'review', 'time-travel', 'films', 'get', 'see', 'Sadly', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'find', 'worthwhile', 'What', 'film', 'year', '2000', 'anyway', 'Could', 'be', 'future', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Other', 'films', 'interest', 'will', 'like', 'compared', 'Tomorrow', 'Man', 'Primer', 'see', 'reviews', 'andThe', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Infinifilm', 'Edition', 'films', 'mentioned', 'here', 'are', 'related', 'will', 'like', 'enjoy', 'time', 'travel', 'paradox-solving', 'stories']",N/A

The idea, that a man travels back in time to find love with a woman whose photograph he'd seen in the future, was more romantic in actioner THE TERMINATOR.  Leads MARISA TOMEI and the ever watchable VINCENT D'ONOFRIO are effective and have decent chemistry.  Director BRAD ANDERSON, whose SESSION 9 was an excellently spooky film, shows some skill, however can't jump HAPPY ACCIDENTS hurdles- plotting and pacing.  The story could be told in fifteen minutes and drags big-time in spots.  By the time the final revelation comes, it lasts so long and is so predictable, you've known what it is for an hour.  The big question the film poses is, &quot;is D'ONOFRIO's character from the future or is he just crazy?&quot;  That seems to be the backbone of the script.  I found myself not caring either way due to scenes of seemingly endless kookiness.  Both characters are a little kooky and they were obviously written that way, which is too bad because a lot more could've been done with the idea and the talent involved.

Ruby usually becomes connected to men who have problems.  She is the consumate enabler until she gets to a breaking  point.  Sam is a quirky young man who works in a hospice.  He is always drawing on a large tablet.  Ruby finds Sam gentle and spontaneous.  He will drop everything to buy her flowers even though he didn't know a carnation from a rose.Ruby finds Sam's tablet by accident and it reveals the name Christie DeLancey along with a picture of a pretty woman.  Devastated, Ruby now beleives that Sam is cheating on her.  Instead of the old lies all woman/men have heard, Sam tells her that he is from the year 2470 AD.  He has traveled into the past to find her.  Christie DeLancey is another ""back traveler"" and his contact in 1996.  She gets him his phoney documents and show him how to ""flag"" a cab.  Though I think all ""back traveler"" contacts should enclude a tour of the public library in their tour of the past.  But I suppose that would make the character of Sam less charming.

723242,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006SFKM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","""Happy Accidents"" is a film that creates a delicate balance between one of two alternative explanations for the character of Sam Deed (Vincent D'Onofrio).  He has turned what appears to be a chance encounter with Ruby Weaver (Marisa Tomei) into a relationship.  Sam says he comes from Dubuque, Iowa, and he sticks to that claim throughout the movie, except eventually he reveals that the Dubuque he is from is a coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean because of a couple of ice ages in between now and 2436, which is when Sam traveled back in time.  Now, of course, this guy is crazy.  But Sam is as charming as he is crazy, in a quirky sort of way, and every time Ruby is read to cut bait and run, he finds a way of pulling her back in to his bizarre version of the truth.Most of the story is told in flashback as Ruby describes this strange relationship to her therapist (Holland Taylor), who can tell her exactly what is wrong with Sam.  Clearly a crisis point has been reached and a final, fateful decision needs to be made.  Ruby does not need her therapist to remind her that she has a history of being an enabler.  After all, her mother, Lillian (Tovah Feldshuh) was a co-dependent who endured a marriage to an alcoholic for years before finding the strength to make him go sober, so there is a clearly a pattern to break here.  Then there is Ruby's best friend, Gretchen (Nadia Dajani), who dismisses Sam's actions as just a ""game"" no different from her boyfriend pretending to be someone else in the bedroom.Clearly there are pressures pulling Ruby is different directions, but the strongest of those come from Sam himself as he offers explanations for what the future is like and the rules for time travel every time Ruby pokes a hole in his story.  Supposedly Sam had a sister who drowned and no photographs of her; but there is a photograph of a young girl and a dog in Sam's wallet.  Then there is Sam's notebook with the name of another woman written prominently in it several times.  But Sam offers an incredibly romantic explanation for why he has come back in time and an explanation of the principle of time travel that he demonstrates on Ruby's leg that is quite compelling.""Happy Accidents"" works so well because of the believability of D'Onofrio and Tomei.  His quirkiness bothered me, but despite that I find myself liking the guy; which is exactly the point.  Tomei's character is caught in a web of conflicting thoughts and desires and every time the pendulum swings the arc is getting bigger and bigger.  But every single time we make up our mind as to what is really going on, another substantive seed of doubt is thrown into the mix.  The credit for this goes to writer-director Brad Anderson (""Next Stop, Wonderland"") who constructs the story so that Sam keeps getting the benefit of the doubt.  Eventually we get to the point where we want to believe, even if it is not true.  Sam makes us want to believe even when logic and the holes in his story tells us that we should not.Ultimately the mixture of romantic comedy and science fiction, or at least pseudo-science fiction, may or may not appeal to some viewers, but it does provide pretty good prospects for a date flick.  But I think there will be others who were surprised to find out how much they liked this movie about the power of love.  That might all be changed by the way this one plays out in the end and I can easily see three or four places where you might decide that ""Happy Accidents"" jumps the track and the magic ends for you.  The ending was not totally satisfying to me, but parts of if were and whatever problems the end game might have do not detract away from the stellar performances of D'Onofrio and Tomei.",4,Is Sam crazy or did he really come back in time for Ruby?,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,3707,"['Happy', 'Accidents', 'film', 'delicate', 'balance', 'one', 'two', 'alternative', 'explanations', 'character', 'Sam', 'Deed', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'turned', 'what', 'be', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Ruby', 'Weaver', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Dubuque', 'Iowa', 'claim', 'movie', 'eventually', 'Dubuque', 'coastal', 'city', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'couple', 'ice', 'ages', 'now', '2436', 'when', 'Sam', 'traveled', 'back', 'time', 'Now', 'course', 'guy', 'crazy', 'Sam', 'as', 'charming', 'crazy', 'quirky', 'sort', 'way', 'time', 'Ruby', 'read', 'cut', 'bait', 'run', 'way', 'pulling', 'back', 'bizarre', 'version', 'truth.Most', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Ruby', 'strange', 'relationship', 'therapist', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'Sam', 'Clearly', 'crisis', 'point', 'been', 'reached', 'final', 'fateful', 'decision', 'needs', 'be', 'made', 'Ruby', 'not', 'need', 'therapist', 'remind', 'history', 'being', 'enabler', 'mother', 'Lillian', 'Tovah', 'Feldshuh', 'was', 'co-dependent', 'who', 'endured', 'marriage', 'alcoholic', 'years', 'finding', 'strength', 'make', 'go', 'sober', 'clearly', 'pattern', 'break', 'here', 'Then', 'Ruby', 'best', 'friend', 'Gretchen', 'Nadia', 'Dajani', 'who', 'Sam', 'actions', 'just', 'game', 'different', 'boyfriend', 'pretending', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'bedroom.Clearly', 'are', 'pressures', 'pulling', 'Ruby', 'different', 'directions', 'strongest', 'come', 'Sam', 'explanations', 'what', 'future', 'rules', 'time', 'travel', 'time', 'Ruby', 'hole', 'story', 'Supposedly', 'Sam', 'had', 'sister', 'who', 'drowned', 'photographs', 'photograph', 'young', 'girl', 'dog', 'Sam', 'wallet', 'Then', 'Sam', 'notebook', 'name', 'woman', 'written', 'prominently', 'several', 'times', 'Sam', 'incredibly', 'romantic', 'explanation', 'why', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'explanation', 'principle', 'time', 'travel', 'Ruby', 'leg', 'quite', 'compelling', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'believability', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Tomei', 'quirkiness', 'bothered', 'find', 'liking', 'guy', 'exactly', 'point', 'Tomei', 'character', 'caught', 'web', 'conflicting', 'thoughts', 'desires', 'time', 'pendulum', 'swings', 'arc', 'getting', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'single', 'time', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'substantive', 'seed', 'doubt', 'thrown', 'mix', 'credit', 'writer-director', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'Next', 'Stop', 'Wonderland', 'who', 'story', 'Sam', 'getting', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Eventually', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'believe', 'even', 'not', 'true', 'Sam', 'want', 'believe', 'even', 'when', 'logic', 'holes', 'story', 'should', 'not.Ultimately', 'mixture', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'science', 'fiction', 'least', 'pseudo-science', 'fiction', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'provide', 'pretty', 'good', 'prospects', 'date', 'flick', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'power', 'love', 'might', 'be', 'changed', 'way', 'one', 'out', 'end', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'three', 'four', 'places', 'where', 'might', 'decide', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'track', 'magic', 'ends', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'satisfying', 'parts', 'were', 'problems', 'end', 'game', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'away', 'stellar', 'performances', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Tomei']",N/A
723243,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00006SFKM,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 8]","&quot;Happy Accidents&quot; gives a different twist on the romantic comedy. Part of Sundance's 2000 festival, the film took a while to find distribution. This is because, as much as I like it, it doesn't entirely work. What DOES work is Marisa Tomei. Wow! Is she wonderful, or what! She has one of those rare personas that makes everything she does seem totally believable. After the incredible &quot;In the Bedroom,&quot; I'd go to any film lucky enough to sign her. As Ruby Weaver, she gives an edgy gutsy performance that prods, pushes and pulls, giving the character a tremendous sense of depth. Vincent D'Onofrio who is SO GOOD on TV's &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; gives a quirky performance as Sam Deed. Given the demands of the role, I don't understand how one professional reviewer calls him &quot;too weird.&quot; For me, it fit; and he did it well. We rented this DVD with &quot;Sidewalks of New York&quot; and so had our own Nadia Dajani film festival. As Gretchen, she plays Ruby's #1 girlfriend who has ups and downs with her own love life and keeps a shoe box full of pictures of ex-boyfriends. I didn't get her name, but I also really enjoyed the actress who played Ruby's mother.  Director Brad Anderson had done &quot;Next Stop Wonderland.&quot; If the film had left you wondering whether Sam Deed was indeed from Dubuque, Iowa 400 years in the future, it might have worked better. But when therapist Holland Taylor, who is excellent as usual, turns up to be time looped, then you have to buy the premise that time warp continuum's are real. That's where the picture bogs down a bit for me, trying to make all the pieces fit rather than just enjoying the romance of it all. As a romance time traveler picture, &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; is probably a bit more polished and consistent with pacing. However, Marisa Tomei makes you love it all! A great evening's fun.

The premise sounded intriguing enough, but also like one that could be a pure misfire if not done right. I passed the DVD in the video store so often that I finally decided to give it a chance, and I am so glad I did. The film was a refreshing surprise, given the abundance of recent films completely devoid of originality and substance. It deals with a young woman who falls in love with a guy, who says he's from the future. To say anymore will ruin the film.Happy Accidents is heartfelt, original, and inventive and has two captivating lead performances. The film could have easily been ludicrous or silly given the premise, but it manages to stay believable and sincere by concentrating on the reality of love and relationships, as well as the constantly inventive dialogue.The story is a hard sell, but it works, mainly because of the inventive and intelligent dialogue, in reference to the future (described in great detail by Sam) and the chemistry of the two leads. Vincent D'Onofrio is terrific as always. He portrays Sam with such warmth and conviction that he makes you truly hope everything will work out for him. Marisa Tomei gives one of her best performances, matching her costar scene for scene. The small supporting cast is also quite good, most notable being Nadia Dajani. Brad Anderson, an emerging director in the independent scene, wonderfully directs the film. The ""backwards-time"" scenes are especially effective.The film did unfold a bit slowly, but as soon as things started to come together, it managed to build suspense and led to an intriguing finale. Part romance, part comedy, and part mystery, Happy Accidents is well done, unique, and original.

Was it the fact that the script was a Hoot?

Could it be that Brad Anderson's direction held the fine line between farce and drama as tight as a drum? Well, of course it was all of these things. Anderson is now a talent to be reckoned with as evidenced here and in the deadly serious, scary, other-worldy &quot;Session 9.&quot; On the surface these 2 movies would seem to have nothing in common.

See: ""11 Minutes Ago,"" ""K-PAX,"" ""Timer."" HAPPY SPOILER: They always, always are telling the truth.You can't blame the producers for this really.  If it turned out all along the protagonist really was insane it wouldn't make for much a movie.  Conversely, it also means that whenever someone says they're from the future, they are -- it's just a matter of when someone finally believes them. The romance subgenre of the time travel subgenre hinges on whether the female protagonist believes her boyfriend.  After all, quirky men must all be from another timeline, amiright ladies?And that's about it.  The rest of ""Happy Accidents"" is the opportunity for Marisa Tomei as Ruby Weaver and Vindent D'Onofrio as Sam Deed to showcase their acting talents in a wide range of playful teases, awkward conflicts, and emotional tantrums.  Sam is from the future, so he's not all that good at human interaction.  Ruby has a soft-spot for hard cases and can't resist trying to ""fix"" her boyfriend.  Throughout, Ruby consults with her psychiatrist who provides plausible reasons for Sam's supposed insanity.  Nobody -- not the characters or the audience -- is fooled.It turns out that there's a particular pivotal date that time-traveling Sam has worked so hard for Ruby to avoid. Will he save her?  Won't he? What do you expect from a romantic sci-fi time-traveling movie?There's few surprises in ""Happy Accidents,"" but the fun isn't in the conclusion but how the couple gets there.

We get the idea from very early on that Ruby has had more than her fair share of past boyfriends with these so-called problems, as we see her and her two close girlfriends maintaining and updating a shoebox full of past relationship photos. Ruby just wants to meet the right guy. Is that really asking for too much? So she continues to try and try and try.O.K., so in comes Vincent's character Sam, a sweet and sensitive young man who seems to be instantly drawn towards Ruby from the first time they meet. Before long they are falling in love and Sam has moved into Ruby's apartment.  They're very cute together - a real chemistry.  Initially, and probably because of Ruby's past history with so many strange men, she becomes a bit suspicious about some of Sam's quirks. Almost like a child who is just discovering the world for the first time, Sam seems to be curious and fascinated with almost everything. His wide-eyed amazement over every day things that most people take for granted is unusual, I suppose, but other than that he just seems to be a really sweet guy who is just a bit different. As Ruby begins to notice more and more of these quirks though she becomes a bit more suspicious. We see her consulting with her best friend as well as her therapist on a regular basis, but nothing seems to be too strange so she happily continues her relationship with her new live-in boyfriend.So what about this relationship is so quirky?  Is it the fact that Sam is always so evasive whenever Ruby asks him about his life, his family, his past, etc?  Or is it the fact that there seems to be so much discrepancy in what he tells her versus what she discovers? Sam tells Ruby for example that he doesn't keep photos of his family because he doesn't like to live in the past. At first that seems to suffice until Ruby discovers family photos in Sam's wallet.  Then there is the discovery of Sam's sea sickness pills, the glassy-eyed staring spells that overcome him from time to time and his obsessive drawings of someone named Chrystie Delancey. Eventually Ruby demands an explanation for what she refers to as Sam's idiosyncrasies and Sam reluctantly tells her that he is a back traveller from the year 2470.So is Sam just someone who tells ridiculous stories in an attempt to impress or amuse his girlfriend? Is he just trying to maintain a sort of mystique about himself?  Or, is Sam actually crazy? The only other option would be that Sam is telling the truth about being from the future. So what should Ruby believe?  These are the questions that she finds herself facing as she struggles to either maintain or end her relationship with Sam. The challenge for the viewer of this unusual film is to decide for herself or himself what the real story behind Sam's story is.  You wont find any spoilers in this review though. You have to decide for yourself.I would highly recommend ""Happy Accidents"" for anyone who is looking for a very unusual love story.  There are moments of drama, moments of comedy and an ongoing mystery that may still puzzle you even after the film ends. If you still aren't able to figure out what the deal with Sam really is you can always check out the DVD's audio commentary.  Before returning this movie to the store I watched it a 2nd time.  Then I decided to buy a copy and I never seem to grow tired of watching it. If you're a fan of Vincent or Marisa (or both) then you'll probably love this film.  But even if you aren't a huge Vincent/Marisa fan you'll probably still love it.  Its just a great film and one I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun, quirky, and very unusual love story.",5,Turned out to be quite a Happy Accident for me...,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,4472,"['time', 'discovered', 'gem', 'movie', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'actually', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Now', 'being', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'fan', 'figured', 'very', 'least', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'screen', 'well', 'television', 'even', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'other', 'lead', 'thought', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'couple', 'positive', 'reviews', 'cover', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'idea', 'plot', 'Other', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'first', 'time.In', 'nutshell', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'describe', 'movie', 'very', 'quirky', 'unusual', 'love', 'story', 'Marisa', 'part', 'Ruby', 'young', 'woman', 'history', 'being', 'attracted', 'men', 'lots', 'problems', 'mostly', 'psychological', 'problems', 'get', 'idea', 'very', 'early', 'Ruby', 'had', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'past', 'boyfriends', 'so-called', 'problems', 'see', 'two', 'close', 'girlfriends', 'maintaining', 'updating', 'shoebox', 'full', 'past', 'relationship', 'photos', 'Ruby', 'just', 'meet', 'right', 'guy', 'really', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'try', 'try', 'try.O.K.', 'so', 'Vincent', 'character', 'Sam', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'towards', 'Ruby', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'long', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'Sam', 'moved', 'Ruby', 'apartment', ""'re"", 'very', 'cute', 'together', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Initially', 'probably', 'Ruby', 'past', 'history', 'so', 'many', 'strange', 'men', 'bit', 'suspicious', 'Sam', 'quirks', 'Almost', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'discovering', 'world', 'first', 'time', 'Sam', 'be', 'curious', 'fascinated', 'almost', 'everything', 'wide-eyed', 'amazement', 'day', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'take', 'granted', 'unusual', 'suppose', 'other', 'just', 'be', 'really', 'sweet', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'bit', 'different', 'Ruby', 'notice', 'more', 'more', 'quirks', 'bit', 'more', 'suspicious', 'see', 'consulting', 'best', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'therapist', 'regular', 'basis', 'nothing', 'be', 'too', 'strange', 'happily', 'relationship', 'new', 'live-in', 'boyfriend.So', 'what', 'relationship', 'so', 'quirky', 'fact', 'Sam', 'always', 'so', 'evasive', 'whenever', 'Ruby', 'life', 'family', 'past', 'etc', 'fact', 'there', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'discrepancy', 'what', 'versus', 'what', 'Sam', 'Ruby', 'example', ""n't"", 'keep', 'photos', 'family', ""n't"", 'like', 'live', 'past', 'first', 'suffice', 'Ruby', 'discovers', 'family', 'photos', 'Sam', 'wallet', 'Then', 'discovery', 'Sam', 'sea', 'sickness', 'pills', 'glassy-eyed', 'staring', 'spells', 'overcome', 'time', 'time', 'obsessive', 'drawings', 'someone', 'named', 'Chrystie', 'Delancey', 'Eventually', 'Ruby', 'explanation', 'what', 'Sam', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Sam', 'reluctantly', 'back', 'traveller', 'year', '2470.So', 'Sam', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'ridiculous', 'stories', 'attempt', 'impress', 'amuse', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'trying', 'maintain', 'sort', 'mystique', 'Sam', 'actually', 'crazy', 'only', 'other', 'option', 'would', 'be', 'Sam', 'telling', 'truth', 'being', 'future', 'what', 'should', 'Ruby', 'believe', 'are', 'questions', 'facing', 'maintain', 'end', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'unusual', 'film', 'decide', 'what', 'real', 'story', 'Sam', 'story', 'wont', 'find', 'spoilers', 'review', 'have', 'decide', 'yourself.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'very', 'unusual', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'moments', 'drama', 'moments', 'comedy', 'ongoing', 'mystery', 'may', 'still', 'puzzle', 'even', 'film', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'deal', 'Sam', 'really', 'can', 'always', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'returning', 'movie', 'store', 'watched', '2nd', 'time', 'Then', 'decided', 'buy', 'copy', 'never', 'seem', 'grow', 'tired', 'watching', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Vincent', 'Marisa', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'film', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'huge', 'Vincent/Marisa', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'still', 'love', 'just', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'fun', 'quirky', 'very', 'unusual', 'love', 'story']",N/A

I guess I'd give this film 3 1/2 stars if I could.It's one of those low-budget ""indie"" (independent) films, with lots of fine acting and dialog. I didn't really know what to expect at first (I grabbed this at the video rental store on a whim) but once I got into the groove of it, it was OK. It's supposed to be kind of slow-moving, with dialog and not a lot of action. And that's OK. As long as you know that going in.And it was a funny movie, too. You just have to relax and let it sink in. Don't expect action-packed, because this movie ain't that. So I relaxed. I let it sink in. All the bits of dialog, the funny eccentricities -- I enjoyed them. I didn't want to abandon the movie; it was too interesting. I wanted to find out how it would end. Was Sam a lunatic or was he telling the truth? I *had* to know how it all panned out! But yet -- I still found myself checking the clock.And I wasn't disappointed by the ending, I hasten to add. It had a nice ending. Vincent D'Onofrio and Marisa Tomei were both wonderful throughout the movie. I liked them both, and cared about their fate. The science fiction stuff was highly entertaining -- sure, it borrowed from many different science fiction stories and movies, but that was OK. It was fun and I really enjoyed it when Sam (D'Onofrio) spouted off all his science-fiction techno-babble. Those scenes were especially watchable.It was just that I kept on watching the clock.

This is a wonderfully charming movie and if you like romantic comedies, you'll be sucked into this one right away. Marissa Tomei is terrific and very heartfelt. At the beginning before she's met Sam, there's a particular scene that cracked me up that touched on her former boyfriends, perhaps because I could really relate.
