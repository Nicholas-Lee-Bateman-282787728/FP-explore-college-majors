In creating his silent masterpiece, Flaherty used actors of Inuit extraction, who still knew the traditional ways, and who could reproduce their culture for posterity through film. Though his methods have been criticized as contrived and retrogressive, post-modernist rhetoric has not succeeded in ruining this film in the popular or anthropological circles. &quot;Nanook&quot; remains a warm account of traditional Inuit/Eskimo life, despite their frigid setting.

348048,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302969239,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","""Nanook of the North"" has a place in cinematic history as the first feature-length documentary, shot by Robert J. Flaherty near Inukjuaq on Hudson Bay in the arctic part of Quebec, Canada. A former explorer and prospector in that region, Flaherty decided to document the lifestyle of the Inuit, with funds provided by the French fur company Revillion Freres. The result was an early opportunity for people to see a movie that showed that a distant place and a foreign culture, rather than something staged on a set in a studio. Focusing on the title character and his family, ""Nanook of the North"" showed the traditional Inuit ways of hunting and fishing, building igloos, and other cultural aspects. Consequently, Flaherty's film is considered a prime example of what is called salvage ethnography, which had to do with capturing a record of a culture before it disappeared.There are questions about the degree to which Flaherty manipulated situations and edited his film. We know that Flaherty picked an Inuit named Allakariallak to be his star because he was the most famous hunter in that area, but we also know that Nyla and Cuanyou, the two Inuit women cast as his wives, were not his wives, any more than Allee and Allegoo were his sons, carried around by their ""mothers"" in the hoods of their parkas. Anthropologists agree that the way we see Nanook and the other Inuit hunting seals and whales are traditional practices, but there is reason to believe Flaherty would not let his subjects use guns and made them hunt in the manner of their ancestors. Consequently, what we have here could be the recreation of traditional Inuit ways of hunting, which still has to be of some value. Besides, the life of hunting on the ice that Flaherty shows is indeed as dangerous as it looks, where a seal could prove to be as deadly as a walrus, and Allakariallak would die two years later when he was lost in a storm.We understand that by contemporary standards Flaherty's practices would be considered unethical for someone making a documentary film, but since he was a pioneer in this field he gets the benefit of working at a time when rules did not exist to be broken. Hearing stories of how special igloos had to be constructed so that Flaherty could have his large camera inside to shoot family scenes speaks more to his attempt to show people what it was like than an attempt to just make things up, so overall I am comfortable with the sense of mimesis established here. Only at the end, when we are supposed to believe Nanook's family are desperately searching for shelter, does the documentary really descend into dramatic license that is clearly over the line.All things considered, ""Nanook of the North"" might not be true, but for the most part it comes across as being real, which is ultimately more important. I can see elements that might be considered racist, but I have to wonder if that is because the film has the audacity to suggest that the stereotypical view of the Inuit as happy people is more true than false. Then again, lots of people smile a lot more when they know a camera is on them. The 1922 documentary runs 79 minutes and remains in fairly good condition, with a passable chamber music score. There is also a brief interview with Flaherty's widow from the 1950s and a selection of still photographs from both the ""Nanook of the North"" shoot and some of Flaherty's other trips through the Arctic north. The historic value of ""Nanook of the North"" might outweigh the artistic, but not by much.",5,Robert J.

Considering those rigors, I was impressed by the fact that Nanook and his clan seem to be among the happiest people on earth. (So was filmmaker Robert Flaherty, whose admiration for Nanook is obvious in his comments on the title cards. In the preface, we get a lump in our throats to learn that Flaherty's unlikely ""star"" perished of starvation while on a long hunt the year after Flaherty finished shooting the picture.) The walrus and seal hunt scenes are thrilling, and the scene in which Nanook's entire family - wife, numerous children, and dog - emerge from the tiny kayak in which they have been riding with him, is worthy of the great silent comics! The picture quality of this home video release is exceptional. (Reel seems to have used the same print as the Kino edition.)Nanook's people, the Inuit, are still still there on Hudson's Bay. Today, they are the ""canary in the mine shaft"" where global warming is concerned. The fact that they have recently had to move from the mainland onto Baffin Island in search of game does not bode well for the rest of us.",5,Silent classic at popular price,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,1293,"['Nanook', 'North', 'enduring', 'picture', 'filled', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'presenting', 'unfliching', 'portrait', 'thhe', 'rigors', 'endured', 'Nanook', 'family', 'one', 'most', 'inhospitable', 'physical', 'settings', 'imaginable', 'Considering', 'rigors', 'was', 'impressed', 'fact', 'Nanook', 'clan', 'seem', 'be', 'happiest', 'people', 'earth', 'So', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'Robert', 'Flaherty', 'admiration', 'Nanook', 'obvious', 'comments', 'title', 'cards', 'preface', 'get', 'lump', 'throats', 'learn', 'Flaherty', 'unlikely', 'star', 'perished', 'starvation', 'long', 'hunt', 'year', 'Flaherty', 'finished', 'shooting', 'picture', 'walrus', 'seal', 'hunt', 'scenes', 'are', 'thrilling', 'scene', 'Nanook', 'entire', 'family', 'wife', 'numerous', 'children', 'dog', 'emerge', 'tiny', 'kayak', 'have', 'been', 'riding', 'worthy', 'great', 'silent', 'comics', 'picture', 'quality', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'exceptional', 'Reel', 'have', 'used', 'same', 'print', 'Kino', 'edition', 'Nanook', 'people', 'Inuit', 'are', 'still', 'still', 'Hudson', 'Bay', 'Today', 'are', 'canary', 'mine', 'shaft', 'where', 'global', 'warming', 'concerned', 'fact', 'have', 'recently', 'had', 'move', 'mainland', 'Baffin', 'Island', 'search', 'game', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'rest']",Nanook of the North VHS

When first released it became known worldwide. Although the film was staged it is partially accurate. At the time of the film was being made, Inuit society was beginning to modernize and the film was made to portray traditional life for the Inuits.To this day the film remains one of the most famous documentaries ever made.The film is well photographed and is the first silent film the Criterion Collection has released on DVD. The new musical score is excellent and often appropriate for the particular scenes. This film is generally appropriate for all ages but near the end of the film there is a scene of brief female nudity.The Criterion Collection has resotred the film to its original frame rate and the special features include photographs of the region where the movie was filmed and also inclused a rare interview with the director's widow.",5,a great film about Inuits (Eskimos),1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,988,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film.This', 'film', 'credited', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'documentary', 'films', 'When', 'first', 'released', 'became', 'known', 'worldwide', 'film', 'was', 'staged', 'partially', 'accurate', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Inuit', 'society', 'was', 'beginning', 'modernize', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'portray', 'traditional', 'life', 'Inuits.To', 'day', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made.The', 'film', 'well', 'photographed', 'first', 'silent', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'released', 'DVD', 'new', 'musical', 'score', 'excellent', 'often', 'appropriate', 'particular', 'scenes', 'film', 'generally', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'end', 'film', 'scene', 'brief', 'female', 'nudity.The', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'resotred', 'film', 'original', 'frame', 'rate', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'photographs', 'region', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'also', 'inclused', 'rare', 'interview', 'director', 'widow']",Nanook of the North VHS
