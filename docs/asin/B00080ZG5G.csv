I love the scene when he leaves to find the girl that he deserved to make love to and ask her in the presence of her fiance, if she cared to dance.

So sad.It would be depressing except for the sex and violence.What the film lacks in perspective it makes up in wonderfully high production values: an incongruously radiant score and especially the lovely cast and scenery.",3,So Sad!,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,513,"['idyllic', 'boyhood', 'loving', 'family', 'ramshackle', 'house', 'sea', 'young', 'Finn', 'gradually', 'misled', 'acquaintances', 'dark', 'motives', 'degradation', 'living', 'cynical', 'society', 'dark', 'attic', 'cold', 'congested', 'city', 'drinking', 'wine', 'bottle', 'sidewalk', 'sad.It', 'would', 'be', 'depressing', 'sex', 'film', 'perspective', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'incongruously', 'radiant', 'score', 'especially', 'lovely', 'cast', 'scenery']",N/A

I can't believe what an utterly waste of time this was for the viewers as well as the producers of this movie! This was the most awfully, painstakingly dull movie I have ever had the misfortune of suffering through! I never thought that I would see ANY movie more brain numbingly dull as Princes' Under The Cherry Moon, but Hazzah this movie makes Under The Cherry Moon look like; The Godfather! This movie is a slap in the face of the great Charles Dickens! It's hard to imagine that Gwenneth Paltrow became a star from this movie, her performance seemed as though she was just as bored with her character as I was watching her character!
