The acting is superb and Abishek excels all his previous performances with his sensitive portrayal of Gurukant Desai, proving that he is indeed a talented and a versatile actor. Aishwarya's stellar performance completes the picture as Guru's devoted and loving wife, enriching the plot. It's a classic rag to riches story, intelligently done and true to real life. It's a must see for Bollywood fans.However, there is a major problem with this DVD.  Although it states that it's ""all regions"" on the cover, including ""NTSC"", it does not work on regular DVD players. Only the second disk with ""Special Features"" works. Unless you have a free range, code free DVD Player you're out of luck.  I had to invest into one but to no avail. Picture quality left a lot to be desired and sound was disappointing at best.

1063112,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000OAXL7K,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 5]","Note: Hindi with English subtitles.Synopsis: After a brief working experience in Istanbul young dreamer and visionary Gurukant decides he has worked long enough for the ""white man"" and returns to his native India to star his own business. His initial battle against widespread corruption in his Motherland is at first laudatory and inspiring but as Guru's wealth and power grow he appears to have become as bad, if not worse than the forces that once held him back. When all is finally said and done the question that the viewer is left to ponder is whether it's our responsibility to martyr ourselves in an effort to change an already flawed system or our right to work within the boundaries of that corruption in order to make a better life for ourselves and the ones we love?Critique: Before the opening credits have disappeared from view `Guru' literally explodes on the screen with two amazingly fast paced musical numbers that will have you waiting breathlessly for what is to follow. However you will definitely be surprised to discover the story about to unfold before you is nothing like what you might have expected judging by the exhilarating, upbeat beginning.`Guru' is an intense exploration into third world political and economic corruption as seen and experienced through the eyes of the films star Abhishek Bachchanin the role of Gurukant. Strangely enough, dispite his taking advantage of the system in place and partaking in somewhat dubious activities to succeed he is looked upon as a dreamer and visionary. This is indeed an important film and quite visionary in a manner that might go unnoticed by viewers in the West. This is a film with a message to the rest of the world. If you have any doubt about this listen carefully to Gurukant's final words.India is tired of working for the ""white man"" and watching the West prosper while they continue to languish in poverty. They despise being called a Third World country and are poised to step into the 21st century an equal in every way. `Guru' is like the sounding of a great trumpet awakening its people to respond to the challenges ahead and they are listening. While this is a very good film that can stand on its own merits, I believe this message of hope and liberation has struck a cord with its intended audience and has a lot to do with the success this of film.",4,"""Shall We Tell The World That We Are Coming?"" ~ A Clarion Call From India To The World",1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,2343,"['Note', 'Hindi', 'English', 'subtitles.Synopsis', 'brief', 'working', 'experience', 'Istanbul', 'young', 'dreamer', 'visionary', 'Gurukant', 'worked', 'long', 'enough', 'white', 'man', 'returns', 'native', 'India', 'star', 'own', 'business', 'initial', 'battle', 'widespread', 'corruption', 'Motherland', 'first', 'laudatory', 'inspiring', 'Guru', 'wealth', 'power', 'grow', 'have', 'become', 'bad', 'not', 'worse', 'forces', 'once', 'held', 'back', 'When', 'finally', 'said', 'done', 'question', 'viewer', 'left', 'ponder', 'responsibility', 'martyr', 'effort', 'change', 'already', 'flawed', 'system', 'right', 'work', 'boundaries', 'corruption', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'ourselves', 'ones', 'love', 'Critique', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'disappeared', 'view', 'Guru', 'literally', 'screen', 'two', 'amazingly', 'fast', 'paced', 'musical', 'numbers', 'will', 'have', 'waiting', 'breathlessly', 'what', 'follow', 'However', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'surprised', 'discover', 'story', 'unfold', 'nothing', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'judging', 'exhilarating', 'upbeat', 'beginning.', 'Guru', 'intense', 'exploration', 'third', 'world', 'political', 'economic', 'corruption', 'seen', 'experienced', 'eyes', 'films', 'star', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchanin', 'role', 'Gurukant', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'dispite', 'taking', 'advantage', 'system', 'place', 'partaking', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'activities', 'succeed', 'looked', 'dreamer', 'visionary', 'indeed', 'important', 'film', 'quite', 'visionary', 'manner', 'might', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'viewers', 'West', 'film', 'message', 'rest', 'world', 'have', 'doubt', 'carefully', 'Gurukant', 'final', 'words.India', 'tired', 'working', 'white', 'man', 'watching', 'West', 'prosper', 'continue', 'languish', 'poverty', 'despise', 'being', 'called', 'Third', 'World', 'country', 'are', 'poised', 'step', '21st', 'century', 'equal', 'way', 'Guru', 'sounding', 'great', 'trumpet', 'awakening', 'people', 'respond', 'challenges', 'ahead', 'are', 'listening', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'believe', 'message', 'hope', 'liberation', 'struck', 'cord', 'intended', 'audience', 'lot', 'do', 'success', 'film']",Guru
1063113,A2XB8M3NXW9Q0O,B000OAXL7K,Gen Res,"[1, 2]","Guru starts of with the main character - Gurukanth Desai (Abishek Bachan) informing his father that he will be going abroad. Gurukanth goes to beautiful Istanbul (some portions looked like Istanbul, other parts were a set). Guru becomes successful abroad but he would rather be successful and open up a business in India.  Guru goes back to India and gets married and then the struggle of opening up his business is shown. The movie starts off at 1951 and ends in 1980.  The movie is good in some parts but eventually, it is a major letdown.There are some big name actors like Abishek Bachan, Aishwarya Rai, Mithun, and others. The acting is really good. The songs are ok, I was expected better songs with AR Rehman as the music director. Some characters are completely unnecessary in this movie such as the handicapped female who is a good friend of Gurus. The story is that Guru is very ambitious and will break all sorts of government and customs laws to make more money. There is The Independent newspaper run by Mithun which always reports the truth. One newspaper writer is bent on exposing Abhishek Bachan's cheating ways. Along the way, the newspaper writer also inserts half truths such as drug smuggling against Abishek Bachan. Enmity between Abhishek Bachan and Mithun remains in the movie.  What is the message?? The newspaper reporter was right to expose some information but to exaggerate other information? That breaking government and other laws and making up bologna companies as foreign investors as done by Abhishek Bachan is a good thing? It seems as though the director wanted to make a great movie but along the way the message was lost and the movie pace was just hurried.  The ""all important"" speech given by Abhishek Bachan at the end is disappointing and nothing special. I have definitely seen more heart warming movies that we can all learn from. On the back cover this movie has some great reviews. One reviewer says ""first there was Gandhiji, then Nehru, then Guru"".  What??? How could a person like Guru even be compared to Ganhiji and Nehru? If you watch the movie you will see what I mean.  I would read ""Maximum City"" or ""Freakonomics"".

1063114,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B000OAXL7K,Harkanwar Anand,"[0, 0]","Guru is a story about a man called Gurukant Desai. In his late teens, Gurukant moves back from Turkey to India in hopes of doing business. Despite family/society norms, he maintains a very entrepreneurial instinct at business. He gets married and starts a business with his brother-in-law. Things are not going too well and times are bad just like they always are but Guru knows there's nothing to lose and no looking back. He breaks the laws of the land, his individual grows and in a few years from when he started, he is one of the richest men in the country.The reason Guru was as impacting as it is is simply because of a two word name, Mani Ratnam. The direction is thrilling to say the least. You will not forget Abhishek Bachchan and his performance in a hurry. I struggle to compare his stellar performance with the a few others I have seen over the last decade or so. Aishwarya Rai was decent in this film. Overall, Guru reminded me most of Aviator but the latter is better.Anyhow, watch this film. Easily the best I've seen so far this year. The music will not leave your mind for years to come.

1063115,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000OAXL7K,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","I've seen Abhishek Bachchan in several Bollywood flicks now and, in the viewing of them, have become a fan. His father is the distinguished actor Amitabh Bachchan; his grandfather was a celebrated poet. So, Abhishek definitely has potential and has shown flashes of acting talent in several of his earlier films (Yuva,Kuch Naa Kaho (2 Disc Set),Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke). Really, it was only a matter of time before Abhishek broke thru with a truly memorable performance, and, indeed, GURU proves to be the platform for Abhishek's best work yet.Somewhat based on the lifestory of influential Indian entrepreneur Dhirubhai Ambani (now deceased) who founded India's largest private company, GURU chronicles the decades-long story of Gurukant ""Guru"" Desai (Abhishek Bachchan), a man of humble beginnings, whose unquenchable drive and ambition elevate him to the forefront of India's corporate powers. But, somewhere on his path to success, Guru develops underhanded means for advancing his company. The film's conflict surfaces when Manikdas Gupta (Mithun Chakraborty), Guru's mentor and owner of an independent newspaper, finally decides to expose Guru's shady business dealings. As years pass and his empire begins to crumble from the press's onslaught and he teeters on the brink of an investigation, Guru remains outwardly cocky and defiant, even though his health shockingly declines. But, with the steadfast support of his loving wife Sujata (Aishwarya Rai), Guru perseveres...Abhishek Bachchan powers this film with his multi-layered and most mature performance. This really is the best I've seen him. Bachchan himself admits that Guru is his most challenging role yet. Abhishek is magnetic in his depiction of the bold, ferocious, and unbending Guru. But what I enjoyed most are the intimate moments Guru has with his wife Sujata and his twin daughters. In fact, in his loving and playful interactions with Sujata, Guru is at his most likable.Aishwarya Rai, whose beauty is undeniable even if her acting sometimes raises eyebrows, perfectly complements Bachchan as the willful but loyal Sujata, whom Guru initially weds for her financial dowry (and, oboy, imagine the fireworks when she finds this out). While her scenes as a young woman shows off her looks, Aishwarya seems even more radiant when portraying Sujata as a middle aged woman. The courtroom scenes are great and very moving. I don't just mean Guru's speech, but the scenes leading up to it, wherein Sujata plays a significant role. GURU also gets noteworthy efforts from Mithun Chakraborty and Vidya Balan as the lively but wheelchaired Meenu.The musical numbers are engaging. The first one is a specialty item titled ""Mayya Mayya"" which guest stars the sinuous Mallika Sherawat. The playful ""Barso Re Megha"" introduces Aishwarya Rai's character while the gentle ""Tere Bina"" is a tuneful love ballad and displays more of Rai's captivating dancing. But the most touching musical moment occurs when the twin daughters sing to their bed-ridden father.This 2-disc dvd set comes with a skimpy booklet which has info on the film characters, as well as Guru's mantra. Disc 2 presents 13 minutes of deleted scenes (worth watching, but there's no sub-title option on the menu), a 20-minute-long ""Making of the Movie"" featurette, and the ""Making of the Music"" featurette, which, basically, is a promotional event moderated by Abshishek's famous dad Amitabh and containing brief cast interviews and a live performance by the music contributors.By no means is GURU a perfect film. Characters show up, only to abruptly vanish halfway thru (Guru's disapproving father and Guru's disillusioned best friend). The fictional biographical story, while overall effective, does stumble in spots and, in fact, shines best when focusing, not on Guru's entrepreneurial conquests, but on his and Sujata's relationship. But GURU's biggest flaw may be that it chooses not to show Guru's shady business dealings on screen, making it that much harder for the viewer to emotionally connect to his more despicable side. We detachedly learn of Guru's unscrupulous acts thru the verbal spoutings of the newspaper owner and his editor and via their accusatory headlines. This doesn't work as well as if we'd seen his misdeeds firsthand.Nevertheless, I very much enjoyed GURU. This fictional biopicture of an ambitious, larger-than-life clothing and chemical magnate was a triumph in the Bollywood universe as it was received very well and drew critical acclaims for Bachchan's powerhouse depiction. Director Mani Ratnam figures to infuse an undercurrent of national relevance into his picture by juxtaposing Guru's rapid escalation to success with India's progression as a power in its own right, both of which take place in the same time span (from the 1950s to the '80s and beyond). Guru himself touches on this parallel in his bravura courtroom speech. Make of that what you will; certainly, it'll resonate more with those of Indian heritage. Irregardless, GURU is a wonderful movie experience. With wondrous cinematography, first rate acting, a dramatic score, well executed musical numbers, and a quiet but effective love story as brought to life by two of Bollywood's royalty, there's much to revel in for fans of Bachchan and Rai.",4,"""We are 50% partners.

1063117,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000OAXL7K,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","*some spoliers*Despite its exotic setting and occasionally flashy technique, ""Guru"" is really just the oldie about the rube from the provinces who ventures to the Big Bad City in search of fame and fortune, only to fall under the spell of greed and corruption in his ruthless climb to the top.  The twist here, though, is that the film is also a nationalistic David-and-Goliath tale of a man from the lower classes who takes on the entrenched corporate interests who use their collective power to keep men like him from sharing in the wealth.  This leads to the rather bizarre, ethically dubious contention that it's okay to engage in corruption just as long as the people you are ripping off are demonstrably more corrupt than you are.Ambitious in theme and epic in scope, the story spans a thirty year period, beginning in 1951 when Gurubhai Desai (Abhishek Bachchan) leaves his village to make a success of himself in the outside world, and ending in 1980 when he and his company are facing prosecution for fraud, tax evasion and a whole host of other unscrupulous business practices that are threatening to bring Desai`s corporate empire crashing down around him.Despite their undeniable virtues in other areas, Indian films are not generally noted for either their brevity or their emotional subtlety - and ""Guru"" is no exception in this regard.  It suffers from an exhausting 155-minute running time as well as from a tendency to overstate its major plot and character points ad absurdum.  When the people in the film are happy, they must be shown to be deliriously happy, dancing in the streets and throwing each other into the air to demonstrate their joy; when they are sad, angry, conniving or morally righteous, they behave in similarly emphatic and underlined ways, with A.R. Rahman's pumped-up, ear-pounding musical score wringing every remaining drop of subtlety and restraint out of the picture.Still, I suppose this is all part of the Bollywood appeal, and there are certainly some notable virtues that make the film worth recommending.  First of all, the film is visually stunning, with one beautifully framed image after another unfolding in multi-colored, kaleidoscopic splendor before us.  Second, there is a certain old-fashioned freshness to the utterly unabashed and shameless way in which the movie traffics in purple prose melodrama, wearing its emotions so transparently on its sleeves that it purges the story of all possible archness or coyness.  (Think of it as a Douglas Sirk production with saris).  Finally, as with virtually all commercial Indian films, ""Guru"" is decked out with a generous helping of lively, though admittedly quite corny, song-and-dance numbers that wind up ""stopping the show"" in both the best and worst senses of that phrase.  For fun as these musical sequences are to watch, they do lead one to wonder if all the money that Indian producers so generously lavish on choreographers might not, in fact, be more wisely spent on a few judicious editors instead.",3,a mixed bag,1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,3011,"['*some', 'spoliers*Despite', 'exotic', 'setting', 'occasionally', 'flashy', 'technique', 'Guru', 'really', 'just', 'oldie', 'rube', 'provinces', 'who', 'ventures', 'Big', 'Bad', 'City', 'search', 'fame', 'fortune', 'only', 'fall', 'spell', 'greed', 'corruption', 'ruthless', 'climb', 'top', 'twist', 'here', 'film', 'also', 'nationalistic', 'David-and-Goliath', 'tale', 'man', 'lower', 'classes', 'who', 'entrenched', 'corporate', 'interests', 'who', 'use', 'collective', 'power', 'keep', 'men', 'sharing', 'wealth', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'ethically', 'dubious', 'contention', 'okay', 'engage', 'corruption', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'are', 'ripping', 'off', 'are', 'demonstrably', 'more', 'corrupt', 'are.Ambitious', 'theme', 'epic', 'scope', 'story', 'thirty', 'year', 'period', 'beginning', '1951', 'when', 'Gurubhai', 'Desai', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'village', 'make', 'success', 'outside', 'world', 'ending', '1980', 'when', 'company', 'are', 'facing', 'prosecution', 'fraud', 'tax', 'evasion', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'unscrupulous', 'business', 'practices', 'are', 'threatening', 'bring', 'Desai', 's', 'corporate', 'empire', 'crashing', 'down', 'around', 'him.Despite', 'undeniable', 'virtues', 'other', 'areas', 'Indian', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'generally', 'noted', 'brevity', 'emotional', 'subtlety', 'Guru', 'exception', 'regard', 'exhausting', '155-minute', 'running', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'tendency', 'overstate', 'major', 'plot', 'character', 'points', 'ad', 'absurdum', 'When', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'happy', 'must', 'be', 'shown', 'be', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'dancing', 'streets', 'throwing', 'other', 'air', 'demonstrate', 'joy', 'when', 'are', 'sad', 'angry', 'conniving', 'morally', 'righteous', 'behave', 'similarly', 'emphatic', 'underlined', 'ways', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'pumped-up', 'ear-pounding', 'musical', 'score', 'wringing', 'remaining', 'drop', 'subtlety', 'restraint', 'picture.Still', 'suppose', 'part', 'Bollywood', 'appeal', 'are', 'certainly', 'notable', 'virtues', 'make', 'film', 'recommending', 'First', 'all', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'one', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'image', 'unfolding', 'multi-colored', 'kaleidoscopic', 'splendor', 'Second', 'certain', 'old-fashioned', 'freshness', 'utterly', 'unabashed', 'shameless', 'way', 'movie', 'traffics', 'purple', 'prose', 'melodrama', 'wearing', 'emotions', 'so', 'transparently', 'sleeves', 'story', 'possible', 'archness', 'coyness', 'Think', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'production', 'saris', 'Finally', 'virtually', 'commercial', 'Indian', 'films', 'Guru', 'decked', 'out', 'generous', 'helping', 'lively', 'though', 'admittedly', 'quite', 'corny', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'wind', 'stopping', 'show', 'best', 'worst', 'senses', 'phrase', 'fun', 'musical', 'sequences', 'are', 'watch', 'do', 'lead', 'one', 'wonder', 'money', 'Indian', 'producers', 'so', 'generously', 'lavish', 'choreographers', 'might', 'not', 'fact', 'be', 'more', 'wisely', 'spent', 'few', 'judicious', 'editors', 'instead']",Guru
