There is very little gore and the premise may seem a bit campy. The Illusion-O effects were a novelty in the early sixties at the time by William Castle as this film made use of a special type of glasses that enabled one to see the ghosts in the picture. The story opens with a down on his luck Paleontologist and his family needing a place to stay after he loses everything to his creditors. That evening during a birthday party held for the youngest boy, the boy makes a wish that he could live in a house with furniture that was theirs and wouldn't be taken away. At that moment a telegram arrives that seems to fulfill the boy's wish. A house that once belonged to Cyrus' eccentric and reclusive uncle has been willed to him, along with everything he collected over the years, including 12 rather cantankerous and possibly dangerous ghosts. The lawyer, Benjamin Rush seems to be very helpful in getting them settled in and has developed a romantic interest in Cyrus' eldest daughter-- or has he?While the young boy wastes little time prowling the place in getting to know and like the other supernatural denizens of the house, someone has been sneaking through the house looking for one secret that was neglected to be told, about the treasure that the house also holds. Look for Margaret Hamilton playing the part of the creepy yet helpful housekeeper as in a s&eacute;ance, she reveals a terrifying prophecy about another ghost about to join the array already residing there. It is too bad they didn't include the glasses with the DVD, but the ghosts can be seen in red nonetheless on film, including the mysterious number 13th ghost at the end of the picture.",5,A pleasantly spooky interlude....,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,1758,"['film', 'not', 'one', 'likely', 'frighten', 'anyone', 'days', 'relatively', 'tame', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'premise', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'campy', 'Illusion-O', 'effects', 'were', 'novelty', 'early', 'sixties', 'time', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'made', 'use', 'special', 'type', 'glasses', 'enabled', 'one', 'see', 'ghosts', 'picture', 'story', 'down', 'luck', 'Paleontologist', 'family', 'needing', 'place', 'stay', 'everything', 'creditors', 'evening', 'birthday', 'party', 'held', 'youngest', 'boy', 'boy', 'wish', 'could', 'live', 'house', 'furniture', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'moment', 'telegram', 'fulfill', 'boy', 'wish', 'house', 'once', 'belonged', 'Cyrus', 'eccentric', 'reclusive', 'uncle', 'been', 'willed', 'everything', 'collected', 'years', 'including', '12', 'rather', 'cantankerous', 'possibly', 'dangerous', 'ghosts', 'lawyer', 'Benjamin', 'Rush', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'getting', 'settled', 'developed', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Cyrus', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'young', 'boy', 'little', 'time', 'prowling', 'place', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'supernatural', 'denizens', 'house', 'someone', 'been', 'sneaking', 'house', 'looking', 'one', 'secret', 'was', 'neglected', 'be', 'told', 'treasure', 'house', 'also', 'Look', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'playing', 'part', 'creepy', 'yet', 'helpful', 'housekeeper', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'terrifying', 'prophecy', 'ghost', 'join', 'array', 'already', 'residing', 'there', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'glasses', 'DVD', 'ghosts', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'red', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'including', 'mysterious', 'number', '13th', 'ghost', 'end', 'picture']",N/A
366091,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,6303257364,Blahblahblah,"[2, 4]","William Castle was a master showman.  For a while, every movie he released had its own gimmick.  For example, with the movie The Tingler, several seats in theatres where it was shown would be rigged with mild electric shocks which would be set off during key scenes.  For 13 Ghosts, the gimmick was that scenes with ghosts were filmed with the background tinted blue and the ghosts tinted red (and difficult to see).  People in the audience were given a ghost viewer/remover.  If you looked through the red lense, the ghosts are enhanced and become more visible.  Look through the blue lense and the ghosts become completely invisible.William Castle's films, especially 13 Ghosts, are for the most part highly enjoyable and entertaining even without the gimmicks, but now at last those of us who were unable to watch the original theatrical productions can at least experience the wonders of Illusion-O thanks to this DVD, which comes with one free ghost viewer/remover.  And the effect works amazingly well!  You have the option to watch the film in normal black and white (like in TV broadcasts), but the ghosts look more blobby and contrived. Watching it in Illusion-O makes a huge difference!  The ghosts look more detailed yet more ethereal, like actual ghosts, and the red tinting makes it all the more spooky.  It's also fun switching the viewer back and forth to watch the ghosts appear and disappear.The film itself is fun for the whole family, filled with humour and suspense and great characters, and is a far more effective horror film than the remake.  I haven't had so much fun watching a competently made film in a long time!  And there is a great in-joke with the boy suspecting the housekeeper of being a witch (she is played by the same actress who was the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz).  Also included is a great documentary giving the background of the film.

William Castle artfully blended scares with laughs in this film and the combination works very well. The movie makes heavy use of sound effects along with some innovative visual effects which all add up to a very foreboding atmosphere...just the kind of atmosphere for ghost hunting! I won't spoil it by detailing the action; I'll let you see it for yourself. Too bad there isn't a ghost viewer packaged with each tape (it wouldn't work with TV, but it would be a great piece of nostalgia!) For those who don't know, the theatre gave each attending patron a ghost viewer. The viewer was made out of two layers of cardboard, decorated with drawings of ghosts, with two cellophane lenses (one blue lens and one red lens) sandwiched in between. One lens would make the ghosts show up really well while the other lens would make them pretty much invisible. During the movie, when the ghost alert was given (you were warned, although I don't remember how, when the ghosts were going to appear so that you could be ready with your ghost viewer), I watched through the lens that hid the ghosts so that I wouldn't have to see those horrid creatures (although once or twice I sneaked a peek through the other lens.) I even took my viewer home and checked out my bedroom before going to sleep...just to be sure, you understand. It would also be nice to see the original before-feature footage of William Castle explaining how to use the ghost viewer. Oh well, memories notwithstanding, this is still a very good movie and one worth watching.

Can you possibly think of him with that signature cigar, that teeth-bare smile and that impish twinkle in his eyes without smiling back?Stephan Sondheim proclaimed ""You've Gotta Have a Gimmick"" and he may have learned that from William Castle.Thirteen Ghosts is all good fun.  A family inherits a haunted house that may have a hidden treasure within.  The previous owner invented some glasses that allow the wearer to see the ghosts.  Are the ghosts trying to scare the family into refuting their newly acquired property, or are they trying to help the family thwart an unscrupulous intruder?Good ghosts or bad ghosts?Who cares?  The plot really is inconsequential.  What's important is that we get these really cool glasses with the DVD that allow US, THE AUDIENCE, to see the ghosts!  Well, they don't really allow us to see anything that we couldn't already see.  In fact, the glasses really don't do anything.  In fact, my DVD didn't even include promised glasses, which I had planned to cherish forever.  Or at least cherish for the duration of the movie.So the glasses really don't do much more than the plot.  We do, however, get to see Margaret Hamilton reveling in her (second) role of a which.  Or is she?  Her final wink to the camera seems to indicate that she's having fun; if not with her character, then with us.  After the legacy of ""The Wizard of Oz"", we can't help but wallow with her a bit the way a happy hog might wallow in its favorite mud.And finally, William Castle reverently gives us a tongue-in-cheek warning if we still don't believe in ghosts by the film's end. He advises that we try the glasses on when we get home.  At night.  When you're alone.  ""If you DARE!!!"" It's again just good clean fun.  Or if you prefer, bad clean fun.  Boo.We are reduced to the mindset we had when we believed in Santa Claus.  To me, it's fun to revisit that romantic part of my brain from time to time.William Castle is a comedian who laughs at his own jokes louder than anyone else does.

Such movies as &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; truly are classic films, ones that are remembered with fondness and provide laughs for future generations accustomed to more sophisticated shock tactics.The story is quite simple, really: Cyrus Zorba (Donald Woods) works in a museum, mostly down on his luck, forgetting to pay bills and paying the consequences later. He gets to pull his family out of their impoverished situation when he learns that his rich uncle, a mad scientist who experimented with the supernatural, passed away, leaving him in possession of his large and luxurious estate.His wife, Hilda (Rosemary DeCamp), is not so enticed by the house, and becomes quite uneasy when it is learned that dear old uncle collected ghosts from foreign lands and brought them back to his home, a point the movie explains meticulously, without a care as to how completely and utterly ridiculous this explanation sounds. But that's all part of the movie's nonsensical fun, which escalates once the ghosts start appearing, and the mystery behind the doomed thirteenth ghost begins to unravel.In the days when film was beginning to take off, horror movies began to circulate more and more, and Castle was one of the first great masters in the scary genre. Audiences of today look at films like this and think of them as little more than comedic, campy fun, but those old enough to remember when such films were first released may not have had such a pleasant time. &quot;13 Ghosts,&quot;in all its silliness, stands as a symbol of times gone by, when horror movies were more interested at poking fun rather than poking peoples' insides.Castle was also famous for his theater tricks, and in &quot;13 Ghosts,&quot; he chose a most interesting gimmick, certainly a wonder of filmmaking in its time. Audience members were provided with a viewer, known as the &quot;Illusion-O&quot; viewer, which would allow each spectator the choice of seeing the ghosts on the screen or not with the use of ectoplasmic photography. Certainly a bit of fun, and I'm sure such tricks lessened the scare quotient, making the movie more pleasurable.There's something extremely campy about a movie that includes such tongue-in-cheek dialogue as &quot;Tonight, death walks again in this evil house.&quot; You'll have a good time watching &quot;13 Ghosts,&quot; a movie that isn't anywhere near being scary by today's standards, but stands as a reminder of how much film has changed in the last half-century. It's an agreeably fun movie that gets its kicks from the tricky filmmaking and the laugh-out-loud lines and events.",4,A terrific example of what it is: a campy thriller.,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,2860,"['day', 'age', 'watching', 'oldie', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'amusing', 'especially', 'happen', 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'great', 'B-movies', 'director', 'William', 'Castle', 'innovative', 'gimmicks', 'were', 'highlight', 'theater', 'audiences', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'Such', 'movies', 'quot', '13', 'Ghosts', 'quot', 'are', 'classic', 'films', 'ones', 'are', 'remembered', 'fondness', 'provide', 'laughs', 'future', 'generations', 'accustomed', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'shock', 'tactics.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'really', 'Cyrus', 'Zorba', 'Donald', 'Woods', 'museum', 'mostly', 'down', 'luck', 'forgetting', 'pay', 'bills', 'paying', 'consequences', 'later', 'pull', 'family', 'impoverished', 'situation', 'when', 'rich', 'uncle', 'mad', 'scientist', 'who', 'experimented', 'supernatural', 'passed', 'away', 'leaving', 'possession', 'large', 'luxurious', 'estate.His', 'wife', 'Hilda', 'Rosemary', 'DeCamp', 'not', 'so', 'enticed', 'house', 'quite', 'uneasy', 'when', 'learned', 'dear', 'old', 'uncle', 'collected', 'ghosts', 'foreign', 'lands', 'brought', 'back', 'home', 'point', 'movie', 'meticulously', 'care', 'how', 'completely', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'explanation', 'part', 'movie', 'nonsensical', 'fun', 'ghosts', 'start', 'appearing', 'mystery', 'doomed', 'thirteenth', 'ghost', 'unravel.In', 'days', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'beginning', 'take', 'off', 'horror', 'movies', 'began', 'circulate', 'more', 'more', 'Castle', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'great', 'masters', 'scary', 'genre', 'Audiences', 'today', 'look', 'films', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'comedic', 'campy', 'fun', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'such', 'films', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'pleasant', 'time', 'quot', '13', 'Ghosts', 'quot', 'silliness', 'symbol', 'times', 'gone', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'poking', 'fun', 'rather', 'poking', 'peoples', 'insides.Castle', 'was', 'also', 'famous', 'theater', 'tricks', 'quot', '13', 'Ghosts', 'quot', 'chose', 'most', 'interesting', 'gimmick', 'certainly', 'wonder', 'filmmaking', 'time', 'Audience', 'members', 'were', 'provided', 'viewer', 'known', 'quot', 'Illusion-O', 'quot', 'viewer', 'would', 'allow', 'spectator', 'choice', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'screen', 'not', 'use', 'ectoplasmic', 'photography', 'Certainly', 'bit', 'fun', ""'m"", 'sure', 'such', 'tricks', 'lessened', 'scare', 'quotient', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'something', 'extremely', 'campy', 'movie', 'such', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'Tonight', 'death', 'walks', 'again', 'evil', 'house.', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'quot', '13', 'Ghosts', 'quot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'being', 'scary', 'today', 'standards', 'reminder', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'changed', 'last', 'half-century', 'agreeably', 'fun', 'movie', 'kicks', 'tricky', 'filmmaking', 'laugh-out-loud', 'lines', 'events']",N/A

One of his frothier films was ""13 Ghosts,"" which doesn't come near the caliber of his better films, but is still fun to watch as a sort of supernatural sitcom. It isn't hard to imagine this as a TV series.The Zorba family has just had their furniture repossessed (again) when Cyrus (Donald Woods) receives a letter from young lawyer Ben Rush (Martin Milner). His reclusive uncle just died, leaving the family a mansion and a pair of goggles for ghost-viewing. Grateful for this, Cyrus moves in with his wife and kids, despite Ben's insistence that something evil is lurking in the house.And soon the Zorba family is being plagued by the twelve ghosts, from ghostly lions to a temperamental chef. Now they want out, and fast -- but they don't realize that Ben wants them to leave so he can find the money hidden somewhere in the house. Will Ben find the money and get away with it? And who will be the thirteenth ghost haunting the house?""13 Ghosts"" is a pretty straightforward film, with straightforward characters in a straightforward situation. Basically, it's like a long sitcom episode with ghosts -- we have your basic 1960s nuclear family (working dad, housewife, two kids) encountering a problem, and sort of bumbling into a solution.The movie was made nearly fifty years ago, which means that the ghosts aren't too convincing, especially since Castle used a short-lived visual gimmick called ""Illusion-O"" (which for some reason is still on the DVDs). But Castle makes up for that with some entertaining scenes like the chef-specter flinging knives around the kitchen, and generates some real eeriness in the seance scene.The acting is pretty good on most counts, with Milner, Woods, Jo Morrow and Rosemary DeCamp turning in solid enough performances. Margaret Hamilton is outstanding as a taut, secretive medium. But Charles Herbert plays a very annoying (and rather stupid) little boy. Did Castle think it was cute to have him call his dad's office and announce ""I've got a secret""?Though it's among William Castle's lesser works, ""13 Ghosts"" is a lightweight, amusing ""horror"" movie, with a nice mix of ghosts and treasurehunting.",3,Ghostly sitcom,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2240,"['William', 'Castle', 'made', 'directorial', 'career', 'spooks', 'curses', 'human', 'supernatural', 'One', 'frothier', 'films', 'was', '13', 'Ghosts', ""n't"", 'come', 'caliber', 'better', 'films', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'sitcom', ""n't"", 'hard', 'imagine', 'TV', 'series.The', 'Zorba', 'family', 'just', 'had', 'furniture', 'repossessed', 'again', 'when', 'Cyrus', 'Donald', 'Woods', 'letter', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Ben', 'Rush', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'reclusive', 'uncle', 'just', 'died', 'leaving', 'family', 'mansion', 'pair', 'goggles', 'ghost-viewing', 'Grateful', 'Cyrus', 'wife', 'kids', 'Ben', 'insistence', 'something', 'evil', 'lurking', 'house.And', 'soon', 'Zorba', 'family', 'being', 'plagued', 'twelve', 'ghosts', 'ghostly', 'lions', 'temperamental', 'chef', 'Now', 'want', 'out', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Ben', 'leave', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'money', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'house', 'Will', 'Ben', 'find', 'money', 'get', 'away', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'thirteenth', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'house', '13', 'Ghosts', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'film', 'straightforward', 'characters', 'straightforward', 'situation', 'Basically', 'long', 'sitcom', 'episode', 'ghosts', 'have', 'basic', '1960s', 'nuclear', 'family', 'working', 'dad', 'housewife', 'two', 'kids', 'encountering', 'problem', 'sort', 'bumbling', 'solution.The', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'ghosts', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'convincing', 'especially', 'Castle', 'used', 'short-lived', 'visual', 'gimmick', 'called', 'Illusion-O', 'reason', 'still', 'DVDs', 'Castle', 'up', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'chef-specter', 'flinging', 'knives', 'kitchen', 'real', 'eeriness', 'seance', 'scene.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'counts', 'Milner', 'Woods', 'Jo', 'Morrow', 'Rosemary', 'DeCamp', 'turning', 'solid', 'enough', 'performances', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'outstanding', 'taut', 'secretive', 'medium', 'Charles', 'Herbert', 'very', 'annoying', 'rather', 'stupid', 'little', 'boy', 'Did', 'Castle', 'think', 'was', 'cute', 'have', 'call', 'dad', 'office', 'announce', ""'ve"", 'got', 'secret', 'William', 'Castle', 'lesser', 'works', '13', 'Ghosts', 'lightweight', 'amusing', 'horror', 'movie', 'nice', 'mix', 'ghosts', 'treasurehunting']",N/A

Horror Movie Director William Castle was one of those shrewd Hollywood tricksters who provided his audiences with thrills & chills in the 1950's.3D was semi successful but had limiting effects wearing these very peculiar tinted glasses.  The illusion provided the viewer with the special 3D effect of items coming off the screen right at you.  For a brief moment providing a scare or two.  By 1960 3D had almost come to an end but William Castle had one last trick up his sleeve, ""13 GHOSTS"" and ILLUSION - O.  With this special effect the viewer could choose to see the ghosts through the RED lens or NOT to see them through the BLUE lens.  The Illusion - O viewer (glasses) & the movie hype was a quick success for William Castle.Now for the first time on WideScreen DVD this Black and White cult horror film ""13 Ghosts"" with Illusion - O including the Special Effect Glasses is available for your home entertainment.  The 3D effects are quite successful and with a little imagination proves to be fun stuff!The DVD provides excellent digital picture & sound quality.  The Anamorphic (auto adjust to any tv) WideScreen presentation (16:9 HDTV Home Theatre)increases the enjoyment immensely.Summary: An impoverish family inherits a strange pair of glasses (ILLUSION - O), a large haunted house filled with treasure, scary servants & ""12 Ghosts"".  The gimmick here is they must live in the house and find the ""13th"" to keep it all and be freed of these other ghosts.  They can only see these ghosts with those special glasses.  Do you see where we're going here?  Do you use the Red or the Blue lens?This DVD includes 2 sided prestentation; Side A - with ILLUSION - O & Side B - without Illusion - O.  extras to include - 1 pair of ghost viewer glasses, movie phamplet, featurette movie about 3D, Production Notes and Trailer.This is a rare home 3D movie nostalgic experience.

Taylor ""GFT""","[37, 39]","William Castle was reknowned for showman gimmicks to which he gave cheesy names, such as ""Percept-O,"" ""Fright Break,"" and ""Emerg-O."" Although some of these effects were pretty silly, some were fairly complicated--and most of them relied upon the communial nature of a theatre audience for effect. Consequently, a contemporary viewer sitting in the comfort of the living room simply doesn't have much opportunity to experience a Castle film as it was originally presented. But there is one exception.  The gimmick for Castle's 13 GHOSTS was ""Illusion-O,"" which required the audience to use color filters (available at the box office) similar to 3-D glasses to see the ghosts in the film. Until recently, all available prints of 13 GHOSTS have been shown in simple black and white with the ghosts always visible, but the recent DVD release restores the tint process, and now you too can have the fun of a William Castle film right in your own home.Like most Castle films, the story is very basic. A financially strapped family inherits a house, and unless they actually agree to reside in it the property goes to the state. But the house is also residence to 11 ghosts ""collected"" by the previous owner, and his death raised the number to 12. Now all of them are out to add another to their number. Who will the victim be? The script, the design, the cinematography, and the story are just as hokey as they can be, but the cast--which includes Margaret Hamilton of ""OZ"" fame--plays it very straight and even without the Illusion-O process the film is a cult favorite. But Illusion-O puts the icing on top. Periodically, a caption flashes on the screen instructing you to look through the viewer. Look through the red filter, and Poof! There are ghosts galore. Look through the blue filter, and Poof! Ghosts be Gone! Now, strictly speaking, you don't actually have to look through anything to see the ghosts--they are fairly visible without squinting through that little red lense--but it does add a tremendous amount of fun to the whole thing.But don't go planning that ghost-viewing party just yet. The DVD offers a few extras that are fairly mild but enjoyable--but the darned thing only includes ONE viewer and if you want more you have to order them at an unreasonable price and then wait eight to ten weeks for them to arrive, and although you could probably run up a few extra viewers on your own that seems like a lot of trouble. Still, this may be your only chance to see a William Castle film as it was intended to be seen--and Castle fans won't want to miss that. And those prepared to order the extra viewers (or make them) will find 13 GHOSTS lots of campy, silly fun.",4,The Magic of Illusion-O In Your Own Living Room,1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,2678,"['William', 'Castle', 'was', 'reknowned', 'showman', 'gimmicks', 'gave', 'cheesy', 'names', 'such', 'Percept-O', 'Fright', 'Break', 'Emerg-O', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'silly', 'were', 'fairly', 'complicated', 'most', 'relied', 'communial', 'nature', 'theatre', 'audience', 'effect', 'Consequently', 'contemporary', 'viewer', 'sitting', 'comfort', 'living', 'room', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'Castle', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'presented', 'one', 'exception', 'gimmick', 'Castle', '13', 'GHOSTS', 'was', 'Illusion-O', 'required', 'audience', 'use', 'color', 'filters', 'available', 'box', 'office', 'similar', '3-D', 'glasses', 'see', 'ghosts', 'film', 'recently', 'available', 'prints', '13', 'GHOSTS', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'ghosts', 'always', 'visible', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'tint', 'process', 'now', 'too', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'right', 'own', 'home.Like', 'most', 'Castle', 'films', 'story', 'very', 'basic', 'financially', 'strapped', 'family', 'house', 'actually', 'agree', 'reside', 'property', 'state', 'house', 'also', 'residence', '11', 'ghosts', 'collected', 'previous', 'owner', 'death', 'raised', 'number', '12', 'Now', 'are', 'add', 'number', 'Who', 'will', 'victim', 'be', 'script', 'design', 'cinematography', 'story', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'hokey', 'can', 'be', 'cast', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'OZ', 'fame', 'very', 'straight', 'even', 'Illusion-O', 'process', 'film', 'cult', 'favorite', 'Illusion-O', 'icing', 'top', 'Periodically', 'caption', 'flashes', 'screen', 'instructing', 'look', 'viewer', 'Look', 'red', 'filter', 'Poof', 'are', 'ghosts', 'galore', 'Look', 'blue', 'filter', 'Poof', 'Ghosts', 'be', 'Gone', 'Now', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'look', 'anything', 'see', 'ghosts', 'are', 'fairly', 'visible', 'squinting', 'little', 'red', 'lense', 'add', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'fun', 'whole', 'thing.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'planning', 'ghost-viewing', 'party', 'just', 'yet', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'are', 'fairly', 'mild', 'enjoyable', 'darned', 'thing', 'only', 'ONE', 'viewer', 'want', 'more', 'have', 'order', 'unreasonable', 'price', 'then', 'wait', 'eight', 'ten', 'weeks', 'arrive', 'could', 'probably', 'run', 'up', 'few', 'extra', 'viewers', 'own', 'lot', 'trouble', 'Still', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'chance', 'see', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'Castle', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'prepared', 'order', 'extra', 'viewers', 'make', 'will', 'find', '13', 'GHOSTS', 'lots', 'campy', 'silly', 'fun']",N/A

Best of all, it features the original version that included the ""Illusion O"" gimmick. Movie audiences in 1960 were required to look through the red lens of the viewer to see the ghosts. If you didn't want to see the ghosts, you were instructed to look through the blue viewer. This is the first time the film was presented for home viewing using this process. A caption appears when the time comes to use the viewer, and then another caption appears to tell you to remove the viewer. Side B of the disc provides a version that doesn't require the need for the special viewer. Both versions on the disc are presented in pristine widescreen.

The special effects are of the period, but they do the job nicely.  Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch Of The West in The Wizard Of Oz) co-stars as the creepy housekeeper Elaine Zacharides.  In my opinion, the three creepiest housekeepers in movie history are Mrs. Danvers (from ""Rebecca"" - 1940, played by Judith Anderson), Mrs. Dudley (from ""The Haunting"" - 1963, played by Rosalie Crutchley), and Elaine Zacharides (from ""13 Ghosts"" - 1960, played by Margaret Hamilton).

This was a golden age of cinema when admission was 25 cents and an all-day lollipop was five cents, and the theater industry was employing all sorts of gimmics to draw patrons away from TV.  (A particularly famous gimmic was stationing registered nurses at showings of ""Psycho,"" to be ready for any heart attacks the movie caused.)  And, yes, ""13 Ghosts"" had a gimmic, the little paper-and-cellophone tinted glasses one wore during haunted portions of the film.  If you wanted to see the ghost, you used the red side -- if not, the blue side.  At the end of the movie was a trailer hinting that you should try using the viewer that night, after you got home, in a dark room... there was no telling what sort of ghost you might see.  That caused all the children to want to keep their little viewers, and I amusingly remember the anxious theater manager standing at the door as we crowded out, flailing around as he tried to grab as many of the viewers back from the kids as he could (I hid mine in my shirt, but saw no ghost that night).""13 Ghosts"" is a fun-scary film -- and it features one of the most stunning opening-credit sequences in all of cinema.

So Cyrus moves his family, wife Hilda (Jo Morrow), son Buck (Donald Woods) and daughter Medea (Rosemary DeCamp), into the new digs.  The problem is that Uncle Plato was a student of the occult who invented a nifty little device that captures ghosts.  All of this is explained by Elaine, the old housekeeper, who is played by Margaret Hamilton (remember her, my pretties?).  But the important thing here is that &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; was produced and directed by the inventive William Castle, which means there has to be a gimmick to get you to watch the movie.For &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; the gimmick was the &quot;Ghost Viewer&quot; which worked with &quot;Illusion-o.&quot;  This was actually one of Castle's best bits.  The movie was shot in black-and-white, but the thirteen ghosts (duh) were tinted in red.  The Ghost Viewer had strips of red and blue plastic: watch through the blue, you could see the ghosts really well.  If you freaked, you could look through the red &quot;ghost remover&quot; and they would disppear.  Of course, on the video tape you can forget about all this.  You can always see the ghosts--bodies, body parts and even a lion--although not too clearly.  Talk about killing the fun.  But then there is the &quot;Bed of Death,&quot; so it is not a total loss.  I have to think that &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; is one of the few Castle films where they could duplicate the gimmick, so hopefully one day someone will revive Illusion-o and the Ghost Viewer.

Of course the house looks like something you might see if Lily Munster of Morticia Addams was your decorator....If that sounds familiar then you'll know what follows.The sets all lack the required &#34;creepy&#34; factor and it's mainly down to the incredibly bright studio lighting used throughout.Everything is so brilliantly lit at all times. There are no dark corners or corridors.This removes all atmosphere needed to suggest hauntings, and it really spoils the effect.The collection of ghosts are briefly described but not given any specific roles in the narrative, except the one of the dead uncle.There is quite a bit of &#34;slapstick&#34; with an Italian ghostly chef, but it's not really anything else than playing with the effects, ...such as they are.The spooky appearances are achieved by means of some VERY primitive double-exposure layering of what are obviously some crude puppets and a couple of people in Halloween type costumes. (A REAL lion makes an appearance in one scene, ....with a piece of black velvet tied around his middle. I can only imagine this was an attempt to make him appear as though he'd been cut in two?

The writer, Robb White, also  did Castle's &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, and he seems to have a  knack for the occasional creepy lines (like those from a pre-&quot;Adam  12&quot; Marty Millner describing the death of the previous owner of the  haunted house - no graphic scenes can compete with your imagination, and  that's how Castle gets his best effects.) Recommended for all ages, but the  more sensitive (read intelligent and imaginative) youngsters *may* have a  nightmare.

William Castle, the reigning king of spook movies in the late fifties and early sixties, was in fine form with co-conspirator Robb White in this spooky tale of a family inheriting a house and it's twelve ghosts.  Someone in the house has been marked to be ghost #13.  The ghosts are hard to see without the special 3-D lenses issued in the theaters, but the atmosphere is appropriately frightening.The dialogue is witty, yet wooden, and the acting is only as a film at this time could be---deadpan yet tongue in cheek.  Margaret Hamilton plays the witch housekeeper, and she still looks like the Wicked Witch of the West.  Martin Milner is cast in the role of the family attorney; Jo Morrow (I remember her from the delightful &quot;Three Worlds of Gulliver&quot;) is a very pretty and effective ingenue, and Charles Herbert is a typical little kid, enamored with his ghostly surroundings.  However, Donald Woods and Rosemary DeCamp as the parents are superbly cast.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[4, 4]","13 Ghosts is one of the most fun of the old black and white horror movies, and before Poltergeist, the only ""family"" horror movie, unless you count comedies like The Spirit Is Willing.  Humor, fun gimmicks, and good acting by a great cast make it one of the most memorable haunted house films of the era.Donald Woods is a father, struggling to provide for his family and failing, who inherits an old dark house from his uncle Plato Zorba.  Woods' low-key performance as a mild-mannered, trusting, accepting, and gullible version of Ward Clever provides some of the more amusing aspects of the film.  He decides to move into the old mansion simply because he can't afford to pay the rent in their own house with his salary from a natural history museum.  His son Buck, played by Charles Herbert (Houseboat) is an avid reader of ghost stories and thrilled at the chance to search the house for spirits.  Rounding out the cast is Rosemary De Camp (On Moonlight Bay) as the mother, Margaret Hamilton (the wicked witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz) as the housekeeper / medium / witch(?), and Martin Milner (who had previously appeared opposite Elizabeth Taylor as a juvenile, and later went on to star in Adam 12) as the lawyer handling Zorba's estate.Besides the house, the estate included a box containing a pair of gadgety glasses.  These are the main gimmick of the film - they allow the wearer to see ghosts.

I've always loved the William Castle films, and this is the most delightful of all, loaded with creeps, as well as loads of humor. One special thing is the love of the parents for their kids. The kids are played by (not so kid-like) Jo Morrow, cute as ever, and the terrific Charles Herbert, given top-billing over Donald Woods (the real main character). The charming Rosemary de Camp is on hand, as well as Martin Milner, just before he became a hit on TV in ""Route 66"". ""The Wizard of Oz"" hadn't yet become it's annual TV sensation, and Margaret Hamilton is on hand to provide a wonderfully creepy housekeeper.I just can't say enough about how much I enjoy this film. It has a great script by Robb White, and William Castle directs as if nothing could be more fun.Side 1 of the DVD requires the viewer (provided in theaters in the 60's), side 2 has a version where you don't need the viewer. Castle's gimmick is complete with this DVD, which includes the viewer.When I first saw 13 Ghosts in the theater, when I was 10, I felt so cool that I knew what a Ouija board was...some things you simply don't forget.This is a good film for kids, too, age 10 or older, though kids today are more resilient to the supernatural than I was, back then; a much simpler time.",5,Smart and clever; fun and silly...,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1369,"['When', ""'m"", 'up', 'late', 'night', 'when', 'info-mercials', 'start', 'put', 'favorite', 'guilty', 'pleasure', '13', 'Ghosts', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'William', 'Castle', 'films', 'most', 'delightful', 'loaded', 'creeps', 'as', 'well', 'loads', 'humor', 'One', 'special', 'thing', 'love', 'parents', 'kids', 'kids', 'are', 'played', 'not', 'so', 'kid-like', 'Jo', 'Morrow', 'cute', 'ever', 'terrific', 'Charles', 'Herbert', 'given', 'top-billing', 'Donald', 'Woods', 'real', 'main', 'character', 'charming', 'Rosemary', 'de', 'Camp', 'hand', 'as', 'well', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'just', 'became', 'hit', 'TV', 'Route', '66', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'become', 'annual', 'TV', 'sensation', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'hand', 'provide', 'wonderfully', 'creepy', 'housekeeper.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'great', 'script', 'Robb', 'White', 'William', 'Castle', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'fun.Side', '1', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'provided', 'theaters', '60', 'side', '2', 'version', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'viewer', 'Castle', 'gimmick', 'complete', 'DVD', 'viewer.When', 'first', 'saw', '13', 'Ghosts', 'theater', 'when', 'was', '10', 'felt', 'so', 'cool', 'knew', 'what', 'Ouija', 'board', 'was', 'things', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget.This', 'good', 'film', 'kids', 'too', 'age', '10', 'older', 'kids', 'today', 'are', 'more', 'resilient', 'supernatural', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'much', 'simpler', 'time']",N/A

Ouija board. William Castle shares with Roger Corman the position of Patriarch of the B-film. Not only has Castle made some of the best B-films ever, but he is one of the artists who defined the genre. This is one of his best.The acting in this film is sterling, even though none of the parts is especially demanding (as a B-film is wont), but the child actor in the lead role is exceptional, and the adults guide the audience into taking some of the sillier aspects of the film, such as the ghost-view glasses, seriously.From the opening credits, this film is genuinely creepy. The opening is one of the best moments in B-film, if not in film altogether. If you force yourself to keep a distance, the opening sequence might be difficult to swallow, but why do so? Throw yourself into this film-- it's not hard, and you will have a great time.Some of the film may seem as cheesy as the Jaycee's haunted house to the seasoned horror film-goer, but on the same note, it can delight you and make you feel just like a kid at Halloween.",5,B at its Best,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,1141,"['William', 'Castle', 'film', 'stamp', 'scene', 'minimalist', 'set', 'Parker', 'Bros.', 'Ouija', 'board', 'William', 'Castle', 'shares', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'position', 'Patriarch', 'B-film', 'Not', 'only', 'Castle', 'made', 'best', 'B-films', 'ever', 'one', 'artists', 'who', 'defined', 'genre', 'one', 'best.The', 'acting', 'film', 'sterling', 'even', 'none', 'parts', 'especially', 'demanding', 'B-film', 'wont', 'child', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'exceptional', 'adults', 'guide', 'audience', 'taking', 'sillier', 'aspects', 'film', 'such', 'ghost-view', 'glasses', 'seriously.From', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'opening', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'B-film', 'not', 'film', 'altogether', 'force', 'keep', 'distance', 'opening', 'sequence', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'why', 'do', 'so', 'Throw', 'film', 'not', 'hard', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time.Some', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'as', 'cheesy', 'Jaycee', 'haunted', 'house', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'film-goer', 'same', 'note', 'can', 'delight', 'make', 'feel', 'just', 'kid', 'Halloween']",N/A

366143,A160IOAWSDDQBQ,6303257364,Tom,"[4, 5]","Last night I recaptured a treasured childhood memory when I watched &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; in it's new DVD incarnation. I was pleased to find that the film was entirely restored, including not only trailers but theatrical prologues and epilogues that I haven't seen since I was 6 years old. The &quot;Illusion-O&quot; process worked fully as well as it did in 1960 and overall, I was not merely pleased, but actually blissful at being able to so fully re-create that important (and influential) childhood experience.One small criticism, there is only ONE Ghost Viewer packaged with the DVD, and also, the RED filter is a teensy bit too dark, although the blue filter worked perfectly.Looking at the film again from an adult vantage point I was struck by how much the film has to do with &quot;secrets&quot;. From Buck's Birthday wish right through to Elaine's cryptic line &quot;Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies&quot;, the whole plot of the film seems to be an exploration of secrecy/privacy within the family dynamic. Buck's Birthday Party presents the visual motif of the circle (in this case the family circle) which is threatened by squares and angles (in the form of the book, and the squarish ghost viewers.) The family circle expands to include Ben, a grave mistake, during the Ouija scene, and sets the stage for the frightening scene which follows. Buck's keeping of his secret is accompanied by his exclusion from the circle (of the Seance) and his subsequent endangerment.All three circle scenes have &quot;group communication&quot; as their theme. All the &quot;square&quot; scenes (dealing with the book, the four-poster bed, the secret panel in the staircase and, of course, the glasses) are about priviliged/private, secret communication. Plato Zorba, a man well used to keeping secrets, has been living in Los Angeles since the time of Buck's birth. Buck and Plato are stongly connected,and have a similar attitude toward &quot;spirits&quot; and, of course, secrets. It is Buck's need to differentiate himself from his family, and to trade on his secrets which leads him to confide in the one person unworthy of such confidence.Wonderful movie for kids, wonderful movie for adults, wonderful movie - period!",5,Who Says You Can't Go Home Again,1000252800,"09 12, 2001",2001,2232,"['Last', 'night', 'recaptured', 'treasured', 'childhood', 'memory', 'when', 'watched', 'quot', '13', 'Ghosts', 'quot', 'new', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'film', 'was', 'entirely', 'restored', 'including', 'not', 'only', 'trailers', 'theatrical', 'prologues', 'epilogues', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'quot', 'Illusion-O', 'quot', 'process', 'worked', 'fully', 'as', 'well', 'did', '1960', 'overall', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'pleased', 'actually', 'blissful', 'being', 'able', 'so', 'fully', 're-create', 'important', 'influential', 'childhood', 'experience.One', 'small', 'criticism', 'only', 'ONE', 'Ghost', 'Viewer', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'also', 'RED', 'filter', 'teensy', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'blue', 'filter', 'worked', 'perfectly.Looking', 'film', 'again', 'adult', 'vantage', 'point', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'do', 'quot', 'secrets', 'quot', 'Buck', 'Birthday', 'wish', 'right', 'Elaine', 'cryptic', 'line', 'quot', 'Ask', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'lies', 'quot', 'whole', 'plot', 'film', 'be', 'exploration', 'secrecy/privacy', 'family', 'dynamic', 'Buck', 'Birthday', 'Party', 'visual', 'motif', 'circle', 'case', 'family', 'circle', 'threatened', 'squares', 'angles', 'form', 'book', 'squarish', 'ghost', 'viewers', 'family', 'circle', 'include', 'Ben', 'grave', 'mistake', 'Ouija', 'scene', 'stage', 'frightening', 'scene', 'Buck', 'keeping', 'secret', 'accompanied', 'exclusion', 'circle', 'Seance', 'subsequent', 'endangerment.All', 'three', 'circle', 'scenes', 'have', 'quot', 'group', 'communication', 'quot', 'theme', 'quot', 'quot', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'book', 'four-poster', 'bed', 'secret', 'panel', 'staircase', 'course', 'glasses', 'are', 'priviliged/private', 'secret', 'communication', 'Plato', 'Zorba', 'man', 'well', 'used', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'been', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'Buck', 'birth', 'Buck', 'Plato', 'are', 'stongly', 'connected', 'have', 'similar', 'attitude', 'quot', 'spirits', 'quot', 'course', 'secrets', 'Buck', 'need', 'differentiate', 'family', 'trade', 'secrets', 'confide', 'one', 'person', 'unworthy', 'such', 'confidence.Wonderful', 'movie', 'kids', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'adults', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'period']",N/A

Apparently later pressing of the disc do not contain the cardboard viewers, but still have the ""Illusion-O"" version of the film on the disc.Is the ""Illusion-O"" effect really that great, and does the lack of viewers negate the overall value of the DVD? The answer to both is: NO! In classic William Castle tradition, the ""Illusion-O"" effect is more sizzle than steak.Basically, when the ghosts appear, the film goes to a red/blue color palette. Allegedly, looking through one of the colored filters on your viewer (can't remember if its red or blue) will ""hide"" the ghosts from frightened viewers, while viewing through the alternate side causes them to stand out in contrast, making them visible.The fact is, you can clearly see the ghosts with or without the viewers, (no matter what side you view through). Perhaps this effect was pulled off better in theaters, but I doubt it. It was simply classic Castle ballyhoo.If you are really bent on recreating the ""Illusion-O"" gimmick but lack the official ghost-viewers, just get a standard pair of red/blue 3-D glasses and the effect is the same (remember to look through only one lense at a time).Or do as I do and simply view this lovable campy old flick in beautifully restored standard black and white and enjoy the film on its own merits.",5,The Great Illusion-O Debate,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,1736,"['DVD', '2', 'versions', 'film', 'one', 'straight', 'black-and-white', 'one', 'Illusion-O', 'where', 'film', 'still', 'black-and-white', 'several', 'short', 'sequences', 'where', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'are', 'presented', 'what', 'essentially', 'red/blue', '3-D.First', 'runs', 'DVD', 'contained', 'carboard', 'Illusion-O', 'viewing', 'glasses', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'standard', 'red/blue', '3-D', 'glasses', 'cool', 'vintage', 'ghost', 'graphics', 'border', 'Apparently', 'later', 'pressing', 'disc', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'cardboard', 'viewers', 'still', 'have', 'Illusion-O', 'version', 'film', 'disc.Is', 'Illusion-O', 'effect', 'really', 'great', 'lack', 'viewers', 'negate', 'overall', 'value', 'DVD', 'answer', 'NO', 'classic', 'William', 'Castle', 'tradition', 'Illusion-O', 'effect', 'more', 'sizzle', 'steak.Basically', 'when', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'film', 'red/blue', 'color', 'palette', 'Allegedly', 'looking', 'one', 'colored', 'filters', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'red', 'blue', 'will', 'hide', 'ghosts', 'frightened', 'viewers', 'viewing', 'alternate', 'side', 'stand', 'out', 'contrast', 'making', 'visible.The', 'fact', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'ghosts', 'viewers', 'matter', 'what', 'side', 'view', 'Perhaps', 'effect', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'better', 'theaters', 'doubt', 'was', 'simply', 'classic', 'Castle', 'ballyhoo.If', 'are', 'really', 'bent', 'recreating', 'Illusion-O', 'gimmick', 'lack', 'official', 'ghost-viewers', 'just', 'get', 'standard', 'pair', 'red/blue', '3-D', 'glasses', 'effect', 'same', 'remember', 'look', 'only', 'one', 'lense', 'time', '.Or', 'do', 'do', 'simply', 'view', 'lovable', 'campy', 'old', 'flick', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'standard', 'black', 'white', 'enjoy', 'film', 'own', 'merits']",N/A
