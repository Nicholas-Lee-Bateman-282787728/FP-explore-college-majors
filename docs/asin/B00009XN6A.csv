759516,A2KM1O2P8RA2BJ,B00009XN6A,B. Stockwell,"[3, 4]","It's easy to imagine how this film would be &quot;tamed&quot; in an American remake; the lovers would NOT be in their 50's, they would NOT be classical musicians; the illness that takes over their lives would NOT be irreversible and it would NOT be shown in such breadth.  If you've ever known someone who has wound up as a full-time caregiver - or have been there yourself - this is a VERY harrowing film and maybe TOO chock-full of reality. At first the film looks like it's going to be pretty glamorous; a well-known composer/conductor and a violinist - both with grown familes -have an affair.  They chose to end their marriages, marry each other and set off happily as a musical team.  Now, the DVD info hints that some sort of crisis will test their love, so when the composer has a sort of &quot;episode&quot; while shaving, I thought, &quot;Ahah!  Some sort of stroke thing and she will fight for her man and their love will save the day, wisdom will be gained and Life Lessons learned.&quot;  Wrong. We're in Bergman territory here and the diagnosis is distressingly bad news and there will NOT be a recovery.  And this news comes early in the film!  What follows is a quiet depiction of a man slowly fading into himself and a woman who does everything possible to hold onto him for as long as she can, uncomplainingly and almost matter-of-factly, and to just &quot;be there&quot; for him.  This is a love story, if you can believe that, and without gushy, weepy scenes or many outwardly spectacular displays.  It's not a depressing film because the tragedy is so &quot;conversational&quot; and always held in check.  You never say while watching this, &quot;Man, how does she put up with it?&quot; because, without a single Big Deal Speech, you see that love/devotion/whatever is SUPPOSED to work like this.  Imagine a &quot;Rainman&quot; remake by Ingmar Bergman and you'll get the idea. There's a nonchalant nobility to the lead actress's actions. The film spends little time in hospitals and the lead actors are amazing. This film is not a slow descent into Hell; it's more of a slow stroll through a situation that seems unsurvivable and yet is survived.  Incredible film, but not for the fainthearted.  Still, I now have a clearer idea of why a person wouldn't just hand an incurable/terminal person over to the doctors and how &quot;coping&quot; works out here in the real world.This film - subtitled and with director's commentary - has been released on DVD with the title &quot;A Song for Martin.&quot;",4,"Powerful, Honest, Almost Too Real . . .and A Love Story?",1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,2520,"['easy', 'imagine', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'tamed', 'quot', 'American', 'remake', 'lovers', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', '50', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'classical', 'musicians', 'illness', 'lives', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'irreversible', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'shown', 'such', 'breadth', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'someone', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'full-time', 'caregiver', 'have', 'been', 'VERY', 'harrowing', 'film', 'maybe', 'TOO', 'chock-full', 'reality', 'first', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'glamorous', 'well-known', 'composer/conductor', 'violinist', 'grown', 'familes', '-have', 'affair', 'chose', 'end', 'marriages', 'marry', 'other', 'set', 'off', 'happily', 'musical', 'team', 'Now', 'DVD', 'info', 'hints', 'sort', 'crisis', 'will', 'test', 'love', 'so', 'when', 'composer', 'sort', 'quot', 'quot', 'shaving', 'thought', 'quot', 'Ahah', 'sort', 'stroke', 'thing', 'will', 'fight', 'man', 'love', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'wisdom', 'will', 'be', 'gained', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'learned.', 'quot', 'Wrong', ""'re"", 'Bergman', 'territory', 'here', 'diagnosis', 'distressingly', 'bad', 'news', 'there', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'recovery', 'news', 'early', 'film', 'What', 'quiet', 'depiction', 'man', 'slowly', 'fading', 'woman', 'who', 'everything', 'possible', 'hold', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'uncomplainingly', 'almost', 'matter-of-factly', 'just', 'quot', 'be', 'quot', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'believe', 'gushy', 'weepy', 'scenes', 'many', 'outwardly', 'spectacular', 'displays', 'not', 'depressing', 'film', 'tragedy', 'so', 'quot', 'conversational', 'quot', 'always', 'held', 'check', 'never', 'say', 'watching', 'quot', 'Man', 'how', 'put', 'up', 'quot', 'single', 'Big', 'Deal', 'Speech', 'see', 'love/devotion/whatever', 'SUPPOSED', 'work', 'Imagine', 'quot', 'Rainman', 'quot', 'remake', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'nonchalant', 'nobility', 'lead', 'actress', 'actions', 'film', 'little', 'time', 'hospitals', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'film', 'not', 'slow', 'descent', 'Hell', 'more', 'slow', 'stroll', 'situation', 'unsurvivable', 'yet', 'survived', 'Incredible', 'film', 'not', 'fainthearted', 'Still', 'now', 'have', 'clearer', 'idea', 'why', 'person', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'hand', 'incurable/terminal', 'person', 'doctors', 'how', 'quot', 'coping', 'quot', 'out', 'here', 'real', 'world.This', 'film', 'subtitled', 'director', 'commentary', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'title', 'quot', 'A', 'Song', 'Martin.', 'quot']",N/A

From afar we over simplify profound disability; Alzheimer's and dementia are just memory loss; paralysis is just a mobility issue..This film shows us  plainly, but not brutally, that it involves so much more loss and change that is never talked about and rarely shared or seen outside the intimacy of caregivers.

It is realistic, about a powerful accomplished man who gradually disappears into his own world with Alzheimer's disease, and how this affects the love of his life who becomes his caretaker.  It is poignant, and unusual, as it is rare to see love stories between older people that are portrayed realistically with the couple as having the same desires, passions, and needs  as the young.The story is not told along a physical time line (so you don't know how many months or years intervene in the story) but along an emotional time line, so that you watch as one loss after another occurs, a gradual dying instead of a sudden one.  At the same time the love between the two falters, but recovers, and never dies.  This is why I don't find the movie depressing.  It is about the power of love.If you have ever had losses in a relationship you will enjoy this film.  Or, of course, if you live with someone with Alzheimer's.  Or if you are in a relationship with someone who is mentally ill.  Or if you just want to see a story of ""true love"", but a realistic ""true love"".  It shows the loneliness, the isolation, and too, the triumph of love.  It reminds us of what is truly important.A previous reviewer said that this was a Norwegian movie; I had thought it was Swedish.  At any rate, it is Scandinavian, with English subtitles.  Instead of finding this annoying, the language seemed charming to me.  The director's comments in the version I watched were in English and very interesting.  I watched the whole film once, and then a second time with the director's comments, something I've only done twice before in my life.  This is a film I will treasure forever and I am so glad I own.*****",5,"Incredible love story, realistic",1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,1797,"['other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'depressing', 'said', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'realistic', 'powerful', 'accomplished', 'man', 'who', 'gradually', 'own', 'world', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'how', 'love', 'life', 'who', 'caretaker', 'poignant', 'unusual', 'rare', 'see', 'love', 'stories', 'older', 'people', 'are', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'couple', 'having', 'same', 'desires', 'passions', 'young.The', 'story', 'not', 'told', 'physical', 'time', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'months', 'years', 'intervene', 'story', 'emotional', 'time', 'line', 'watch', 'one', 'loss', 'occurs', 'gradual', 'dying', 'instead', 'sudden', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'two', 'falters', 'recovers', 'never', 'dies', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'depressing', 'power', 'love.If', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'losses', 'relationship', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'course', 'live', 'someone', 'Alzheimer', 'are', 'relationship', 'someone', 'who', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'realistic', 'true', 'love', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'too', 'triumph', 'love', 'what', 'truly', 'important.A', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'Norwegian', 'movie', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'Swedish', 'rate', 'Scandinavian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Instead', 'finding', 'annoying', 'language', 'seemed', 'charming', 'director', 'comments', 'version', 'watched', 'were', 'English', 'very', 'interesting', 'watched', 'whole', 'film', 'once', 'then', 'second', 'time', 'director', 'comments', 'something', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'twice', 'before', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'treasure', 'forever', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'own', '*****']",N/A

759523,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00009XN6A,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 2]","Danish film director Bille August describes this film as a love story, although viewers are more likely to see it as a portrayal of the terrible toll of Alzheimer's disease on a spouse who is a survivor and caregiver. The Martin of the title (Sven Wollter) is a world-class composer and orchestra conductor, who is cut down by AD in the midst of an important project, the composition of a new opera. Also cut down are the expectations of the concertmaster violinist who has left her husband to become his second wife. Barbara (Viveka Seldahl), their idyllic love affair and Mediterranean honeymoon still fresh in her own memory, is left to struggle with his growing affliction, a daunting task that finds her emotionally abandoned as he retreats into a dark world of loss and confusion.The impact on her is one of exhaustion, humiliation, and desperation, and we watch as the love that has bound her to him becomes the reserve of strength she must draw on, and she looks after him until she is finally unable do so. It is unfortunate perhaps that they have both left what seem to be happy families, with grown children, to start a second life together, because what happens to them becomes a kind of judgment for wanting a fuller and more rewarding life. The film's message is that despite adversity as extreme as this, deeply felt love still triumphs in some way, but it's hardly a way we're used to seeing in the movies. The DVD includes a director's commentary, in which August talks chiefly about the plot and character and very little about the making of the film itself.",4,Love story . . .,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1576,"['Danish', 'film', 'director', 'Bille', 'August', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'viewers', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'see', 'portrayal', 'terrible', 'toll', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'spouse', 'who', 'survivor', 'caregiver', 'Martin', 'title', 'Sven', 'Wollter', 'world-class', 'composer', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'who', 'cut', 'down', 'AD', 'midst', 'important', 'project', 'composition', 'new', 'opera', 'Also', 'cut', 'down', 'are', 'expectations', 'concertmaster', 'violinist', 'who', 'left', 'husband', 'become', 'second', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Viveka', 'Seldahl', 'idyllic', 'love', 'affair', 'Mediterranean', 'honeymoon', 'still', 'fresh', 'own', 'memory', 'left', 'struggle', 'growing', 'affliction', 'daunting', 'task', 'emotionally', 'abandoned', 'dark', 'world', 'loss', 'confusion.The', 'impact', 'one', 'exhaustion', 'humiliation', 'desperation', 'watch', 'love', 'bound', 'becomes', 'reserve', 'strength', 'must', 'draw', 'finally', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'unfortunate', 'perhaps', 'have', 'left', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'happy', 'families', 'grown', 'children', 'start', 'second', 'life', 'together', 'what', 'kind', 'judgment', 'wanting', 'fuller', 'more', 'rewarding', 'life', 'film', 'message', 'adversity', 'as', 'extreme', 'deeply', 'felt', 'love', 'still', 'way', 'hardly', 'way', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'movies', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'August', 'talks', 'chiefly', 'plot', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'making', 'film']",N/A

Most of all it is almost a completely real depiction of alzheimers - a sort of relief  for those who have lived through it (you learn others experience the same thing) and very informative for those who have not. I give it three stars for two reasons: the ""reality"" it failed to demonstrate is that a person cannot be a caretaker with no help whatsoever. We never see who watches Martin when the wife goes out or takes a shower or does anything that would lessen her focus on him. In real life the wife would have needed at least some assistance, particularly when Martin was prone to wandering. Those who have been caretakers know, even sleep is sometimes impossible to get when the alzheimer patient does NOT sleep or is not as docile as Martin. For instance, when she goes to see Martin's manager was Martin left alone? And secondly, I think the wife was rather cruel sometimes. By the time the patient is far gone enough to potentially agitate the caregiver, the caregiver also knows, by then, not to expect the patient to ""act normal."" It seemed to me the wife got upset as she repeatedly expected more normal behaviour from someone who was no longer normal. In real life you learn to not expect so much, be glad for the lucid times, ad that yelling abusive things is not the best way to handle the rough times.Three stars because the wife's behaviour and demeanor were a turn off to me and also because the movie was bit slow moving.
