It is packaged as follows:Disc 1: 1-6Disc 2: 7-12Disc 3: 13-18Disc 4: 19-24Discs #s 1,2, & 4 are correct. But disc 3 contains (in this order) episodes 18, 15, 16, 17, 23, & 19. As you can see, not only are they out of order but episodes #13 & #14 are missing. No, they are not on any of the discs in the set. Plus episodes #19 & #23 appear on both discs 3 & 4. And the funny thing is that the description on the back of the packaging specifically talks about an episode featuring special guest star David Spade where ALF dreams he is the world's funniest comedian. This is episode #14. Too bad it isn't in the set.What puzzles me is that some people indicate that their sets are fine. So it appears maybe there was a bad pressing that was later corrected. So I contacted Lionsgate (the manufacturer of the disc). They answered my email quickly and said they would send me a replacement disc. They said to allow 3-4 weeks for delivery. Well the disc arrived today. The bad news is that the replacement is exactly like the defective disc that came with the set. So I still can't see episodes #13 or #14.

1000966,A3DWLI9VIYXI16,B000GB5M4M,Jesse Ross,"[2, 4]","All four seasons of ALF have been released in syndicated form.  Syndication is alright for TV, but is absolutely inexcusable for DVD releases.  Lions Gate claims that the reason is that the uncut versions were poorer quality, and thus decided to release the higher quality cut versions.  I for one would rather see a poor quality complete episode than a high quality edited one.  But I guess I'll just have to take what I'm given.Despite these being cut episodes, this is still a good set.  The episodes run for at least 20 minutes, which is more than I can say for season 3.  (One episode in the third season set only lasted 18 minutes and 40 seconds.  That was absurd.)  And ALF is, as always, very funny.  I loved the episode where ALF catches a cold, and the one where he visits a senior home is very touching.In conclusion, I recommend buying this set.  I think most fans have gotten over the syndication problem by now, and since the show is no longer on the air, I'm sure many fans will still enjoy seeing the episodes some way.

Other reviewers have mentioned the repetition of some season 3 episodes, which annoyed me as well.  But I also just did not like the final handful of episodes with the political commentary (""Stayin' Alive"") and the entire episode devoted to whether or not Lynn will move in with her boyfriend (""I Gotta Be Me"").  Those were just plain stupid.  There are still a few decent episodes overall, but a lot were either boring or mildly offensive to me.  However, the real kick in the teeth is the very last episode (""Consider Me Gone"").  Way to leave viewers hanging, NBC.  They should have at least allowed for one more episode to tie up the loose ends and give viewers some sort of resolution.So, after finishing this season, I just felt cheated and dissatisfied.
