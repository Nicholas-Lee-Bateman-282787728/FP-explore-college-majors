827591,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,B000296E7W,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[0, 0]","The premise of this documentary is simple: One teacher, 12 multi-aged students, which to most would sound like a day in hell, but George Lopez handles it not only with aplomb but the man practically earned sainthood right before my eyes. If you think that I'm spouting hyperbole, read some of the other reviews. If every teacher and father in this world were like Mr. Lopez, the world would be a much, much better place.The documentary captures day-to-day experiences of the teacher, the students and their lives in a small farming village. Experiencing teaching on a small scale (with various grades in one room) was a new and interesting thing. Mr. Lopez was patient and caring to the point of bringing tears to my eyes more than a few times. And the children, like all kids, ranged the gamut from angels to problems, but all seemed equal somehow under his caring force. There was only one ""interview"" of Georges, and it was brief, but still gave an insight to his life's calling. The end of this film was captivataing, watching him struggle in front of the camera to hold back his emotions as the children left for holiday break. I can't say enough positive things about this man's character.I don't think I've ever been so captivated and touched by a documentary. If you aren't at least emotionally moved in some way by this film, you might want to check and see if you have either a heart or a lump of coal where one should be.Stylistically, the movie moves rather slowly, many ""postcard"" shots (camera not moving) of the local environs act as scene-changers but seemed to drag a bit long for my tastes. While the cinematography was good, a bit of panning - even slightly - might have helped move things along a bit better. Even so, the sound and action were produced well with no distortion or off volumes. The look and sound made you feel like you were there.HIGHLY recommend.

Lopez oversees a K-5 schoolhouse in the heart of the Auvergne for 90 hushed  minutes, I was transfixed by the simple grandeur of the setting, the faces of these lovely kids and the quiet power of their teacher. The film sweeps the audience away from the noise and ugliness of this world into a place in which hard work, simplicity and hope prevail.The cinematography and Ravel-like score enrich the thoughtful sequence of events Nicholas Philbert captures during a single school year. He also takes us into the homes, farms and fields of student families. At times, it seems remarkable the film wasn't scripted -- but after my second viewing, I knew it could not have been.It's also noteworthy to compare the methods of M Lopez with the mass-production approach our districts have often taken in U.S. schools. Despite the learning problems, coping deficits or personal trials of his kids, he never views their reactions to struggle as disorders. His only interest is to view children as whole people help them on their way.It's no wonder Lopez became a French national celebrity after the release of this soulful movie. 10/10.",5,Lovable Documentary About Education -- Perfect 10,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,1256,"['How', 'do', 'movies', 'as', 'beautiful', 'pass', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'praise', 'deserve', 'wise', 'soft-spoken', 'M.', 'Lopez', 'K-5', 'schoolhouse', 'heart', 'Auvergne', '90', 'hushed', 'minutes', 'was', 'transfixed', 'simple', 'grandeur', 'setting', 'lovely', 'kids', 'quiet', 'power', 'teacher', 'film', 'audience', 'away', 'noise', 'ugliness', 'world', 'place', 'hard', 'work', 'simplicity', 'hope', 'prevail.The', 'cinematography', 'Ravel-like', 'score', 'enrich', 'thoughtful', 'sequence', 'events', 'Nicholas', 'Philbert', 'single', 'school', 'year', 'also', 'homes', 'farms', 'fields', 'student', 'families', 'times', 'remarkable', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'scripted', 'second', 'viewing', 'knew', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been.It', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'compare', 'methods', 'M', 'Lopez', 'mass-production', 'approach', 'districts', 'have', 'often', 'taken', 'U.S.', 'schools', 'learning', 'problems', 'coping', 'deficits', 'personal', 'trials', 'kids', 'never', 'views', 'reactions', 'struggle', 'disorders', 'only', 'interest', 'view', 'children', 'whole', 'people', 'help', 'way.It', 'wonder', 'Lopez', 'became', 'French', 'national', 'celebrity', 'release', 'soulful', 'movie', '10/10']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

827595,A10XZH78SDOI5M,B000296E7W,C. Matthew Curtin,"[4, 5]","The one-room schoolhouse is widely seen as a thing of the past, a relic that predates the wonders of a modern system of education. Yet thousands of these schools exist in rural France. Director Nicolas Philibert takes us into one, situated in a remote Auvergne farming community in his documentary film tre et avoir.Starring in this documentary is teacher Georges Lopez whose patient yet firm hand guides his students--about a dozen in number, ranging from the age of four to eleven--through some of their most formative years.If Lopez is the star, he is supported by a cast of young people who did an admirable job of being themselves. The youngest of the children struggles to concentrate on a task at hand and then discovers that when it's time to play he hasn't followed through on his end of the agreement made with the teacher. Then comes the lesson: if he had stayed on-task, he would be finished and now able to play, but as it is, he needs to keep at his work while the other children play because failing to finish isn't an option.The older children, in or near their last year in primary school, find themselves struggling to find their places. When the boys fight, Lopez finds himself in the role of mediator, showing not only the nonsense of the physicality, but helping them to see how it came about and how it could have been avoided. Finally he helps them to see that their behavior will guide that of the younger children and he asks them to consider what sort of example they're setting. A girl seems desperately in search of her voice and a means of expression and she seems unable to conquer the numbers that make for the lesson in mathematics. We see Lopez talking to her mother and hear him state his own objective in working with her as he does: he just wants her to be happy.Working for the children's happiness sounds perhaps clich&eacute; but as the film progresses, we find no difficulty believing it. We see him volunteer his time to continue to work with his student struggling with math and to communicate even after she goes off to middle school. We observe a conversation with one of the older boys whose father is ill, recovering at home from one surgery so that he may return to the hospital for another. The boy is clearly and understandably upset, but the school's quiet master patiently listens and helps him to keep his perspective: even pain is a part of life.Observation of the man and his methods that have helped children not just to learn their numbers and grammar but to become whoever they can become is genuinely a joy. Thus the film takes on a bittersweet flavor as we learn that Lopez is close to retirement--and in fact must be retired by now. One only hopes that the next generation of teachers will live up to the example set before them. We're also given cause for reflection, how it is that we interact with children and what sort of influence we have over them.I was saddened to discover during the course of writing this that Lopez has since sued director Philibert, claiming partial authorship of the work. Losing his original suit, he appealed, and lost again. One additional appeal is possible and as far as I can tell, no announcement has been made. That Lopez would make such a claim--no doubt in search of a portion of the proceeds of the film which has turned out to be a surprise commercial success--is deeply disappointing. Being a documentary, the film simply reports what the camera sees, and we presume that Lopez agreed to be part of a documentary. That he would later claim that he was due some additional compensation that was never part of the deal reminds me of his interaction with young JoJo, who failed to live up to his part of the deal to be able to go out and play with the rest of the children. Were someone failing to live up to an agreement there would be some cause for dispute but this civil action looks like it could be greed, wanting to negotiate a different deal after seeing how the project turned out. Perhaps I'm just too much of an enterprising American to identify with Lopez on this front: one would think that a far better course of action would have been for him to use the tremendous amount of free publicity to publish a book on methods for education, to lecture on the development of children, or to do anything that could be a lucrative second career launched by the global exposure offered by the film's success. The episode is perhaps valuable for reminding us that even our greatest teachers are still ultimately human, complete with their own weaknesses. Perhaps the final lesson is that even disappointment is a part of life.",5,A documentary of life,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,4629,"['one-room', 'schoolhouse', 'widely', 'seen', 'thing', 'past', 'relic', 'wonders', 'modern', 'system', 'education', 'thousands', 'schools', 'exist', 'rural', 'France', 'Director', 'Nicolas', 'Philibert', 'one', 'situated', 'remote', 'Auvergne', 'farming', 'community', 'documentary', 'film', 'tre', 'et', 'avoir.Starring', 'documentary', 'teacher', 'Georges', 'Lopez', 'patient', 'yet', 'firm', 'hand', 'guides', 'students', 'dozen', 'number', 'ranging', 'age', 'four', 'eleven', 'most', 'formative', 'years.If', 'Lopez', 'star', 'supported', 'cast', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'being', 'youngest', 'children', 'concentrate', 'task', 'hand', 'then', 'discovers', 'when', 'time', 'play', ""n't"", 'followed', 'end', 'agreement', 'made', 'teacher', 'Then', 'lesson', 'had', 'stayed', 'on-task', 'would', 'be', 'finished', 'now', 'able', 'play', 'keep', 'work', 'other', 'children', 'play', 'failing', 'finish', ""n't"", 'option.The', 'older', 'children', 'last', 'year', 'primary', 'school', 'find', 'struggling', 'find', 'places', 'When', 'boys', 'fight', 'Lopez', 'role', 'mediator', 'showing', 'not', 'only', 'nonsense', 'physicality', 'helping', 'see', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'Finally', 'see', 'behavior', 'will', 'guide', 'younger', 'children', 'consider', 'what', 'sort', 'example', ""'re"", 'setting', 'girl', 'desperately', 'search', 'voice', 'means', 'expression', 'unable', 'conquer', 'numbers', 'make', 'lesson', 'mathematics', 'see', 'Lopez', 'talking', 'mother', 'hear', 'state', 'own', 'objective', 'working', 'just', 'be', 'happy.Working', 'children', 'happiness', 'perhaps', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'find', 'difficulty', 'believing', 'see', 'volunteer', 'time', 'continue', 'work', 'student', 'struggling', 'math', 'communicate', 'even', 'off', 'middle', 'school', 'observe', 'conversation', 'one', 'older', 'boys', 'father', 'ill', 'recovering', 'home', 'one', 'surgery', 'so', 'may', 'return', 'hospital', 'boy', 'clearly', 'understandably', 'upset', 'school', 'quiet', 'master', 'patiently', 'keep', 'perspective', 'even', 'pain', 'part', 'life.Observation', 'man', 'methods', 'have', 'helped', 'children', 'not', 'just', 'learn', 'numbers', 'grammar', 'become', 'can', 'become', 'genuinely', 'joy', 'Thus', 'film', 'bittersweet', 'flavor', 'learn', 'Lopez', 'close', 'retirement', 'fact', 'must', 'be', 'retired', 'now', 'One', 'only', 'next', 'generation', 'teachers', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'example', 'set', ""'re"", 'also', 'given', 'cause', 'reflection', 'how', 'interact', 'children', 'what', 'sort', 'influence', 'have', 'over', 'them.I', 'was', 'saddened', 'discover', 'course', 'writing', 'Lopez', 'sued', 'director', 'Philibert', 'claiming', 'partial', 'authorship', 'work', 'Losing', 'original', 'suit', 'appealed', 'lost', 'again', 'One', 'additional', 'appeal', 'possible', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'announcement', 'been', 'made', 'Lopez', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'claim', 'doubt', 'search', 'portion', 'proceeds', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'surprise', 'commercial', 'success', 'deeply', 'disappointing', 'Being', 'documentary', 'film', 'simply', 'what', 'camera', 'presume', 'Lopez', 'agreed', 'be', 'part', 'documentary', 'would', 'later', 'claim', 'was', 'due', 'additional', 'compensation', 'was', 'never', 'part', 'deal', 'interaction', 'young', 'JoJo', 'who', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'part', 'deal', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'out', 'play', 'rest', 'children', 'Were', 'someone', 'failing', 'live', 'up', 'agreement', 'would', 'be', 'cause', 'dispute', 'civil', 'action', 'could', 'be', 'greed', 'wanting', 'negotiate', 'different', 'deal', 'seeing', 'how', 'project', 'turned', 'out', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'much', 'enterprising', 'American', 'identify', 'Lopez', 'front', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'far', 'better', 'course', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'use', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'free', 'publicity', 'publish', 'book', 'methods', 'education', 'lecture', 'development', 'children', 'do', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'lucrative', 'second', 'career', 'launched', 'global', 'exposure', 'offered', 'film', 'success', 'episode', 'perhaps', 'valuable', 'reminding', 'even', 'greatest', 'teachers', 'are', 'still', 'ultimately', 'human', 'complete', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'Perhaps', 'final', 'lesson', 'even', 'disappointment', 'part', 'life']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

He is nearly in tears, and so are we the viewers. To Be and To Have, France's highest grossing documentary ever, follows Lopez and his class of a dozen elementary kids ages 3-11 in rural France for most of the academic year. The film is entirely without comment or narration, except for a two or three minute segment towards the end when Lopez explains how and why he spent 35 years as a teacher. The reason? Pure love and joy, which goes a long way toward explaining why he was a master teacher, and this otherwise slow-moving film is so powerful and even magic. We see the kids reading and writing, fighting and farming, baking, sledding and celebrating class birthdays. In my favorite scene, Lopez coaches little Jo Jo to discover that he can count to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and even a billion or more. You see his little mind reeling with the unfolding realization that numbers never stop! For the most part the kids are oblivious to the camera. The true story of a life well spent, the spontaneity of children, and spectacular scenery of rural France make this film a visual and emotional delight.

827598,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B000296E7W,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[10, 12]","I chose this DVD before reading the reviews because I usually enjoy documentaries. My expectations were exceeded.At first, as this quiet documentary meandered slowly from scene to scene, I wondered, ""When will we get to the point?"" Then I realized, this IS the point.  We're enjoying a slow-paced, leisurely experience, pacing the school's rhythm and the relaxed French country town.We begin with a bitter winter day, first watching cows being herded home,then two tortoises in an empty room, then children coming on a school van. (The director's commentary explains that the cows and tortoises are metaphors for, respectively, school and the film.) And then we see scenes of Georges Lopez with the students, singly or in groups, never raising his voice, never showing annoyance, never crossing boundaries.  This is a man with a vocation, the kind we rarely see anymore.Lopez isn't a modern teacher. He's strict: students stand every morning to greet him, say ""yes sir"" and perform lessons by memorization. When a very young child doesn't finish a drawing, he misses recess.I don't know if it's the best pedagogy around. But what students learn goes way beyond math, French, drawing and cooking. They learn to work as a second family, respecting one another, obeying the rules.Because the director chose a small school, we get to know each child a little and we see some parents. There's a hilarious scene where an older student grapples with math homework. His entire family -- parents, uncle, older brother -- come to help and end up becoming equally confused.This is the kind of film I could watch many times, seeing new details and nuances each time.  The director allows scenes to unfold with no voiceover. We're forced to create our own interpretations, develop our own understanding.I wish we could learn more about Lopez. Does he have a life beyond the classroom? How does he work with young children all day and remain so calm? In the one scene where he's interviewed, he visibly relaxes, remembering how he got into teaching. His father worked so hard, he says, he knew he wanted another life.  Perhaps the context of his childhood framed his expectations, leaving him remarkably free of burnout.And I wondered about the socioeconomic status of the children. They all seem to come from working farms. One child is shown working -- driving a huge tractor-type machine confidently, feeding animals, mucking out stalls. But all seem well-dressed with good haircuts. The teacher seems to be driving an Audi.  Is this group especially privileged?Finally, we need a sequel!

Maybe for those who are into teaching, who absolutely LOVE kids and for those who do rural sociology (I must be forgetting some other trade).But for most of us, it only shows how difficult it must be to teach VERY young kids. And how vital that role is. As Kim Anehall puts so well in Amazon: ""To Be and to Have offers some true insights on the job as teachers should be regarded as everyday heroes in the last line of defense in a developing society"".I think that the director Philibert never ""scrapes below the surface"" of the teaching process itself, leaving us instead with plain empiria. And the ""lessons"" seems staked, like if Mr. Lopez would like to prove how good he is at teaching, and as a person. But, as a reviewer notes, the camera shows very clearly when the kids have learnt their lesson, and when they don't (which is most of the times).The stark contrast of the ""conditons of life"" in France compared to any underdeveloped country is painful. The teacher drives a big Audi (!), the schools themselves are nice and lofty, and they all have all the necessary equipment. The kind of things people take for granted on the developed world. I'd love to have this system back in my country, Argentina. Specifically, in the ""conurbano bonaerense"", where teachers aren't paid for months, pupils go to school basically to have a meal their parents can't afford back home, and violence is the rule of the game.I laughed with one American reviewer when he said that probaby JoJo would be medicated in the US...If you want to know about different methods of education you could always watch for instance Kiarostami's ""Where Is the Friend's Home?"" to learn how the other half of the world lives.The cinematography is very nice.I agree with another Amazon reviewer Matt Curtin (Columbus, OH USA) on the Lopez'saga of suits: ""That he would later claim that he was due some additional compensation that was never part of the deal reminds me of his interaction with young JoJo (...) even our greatest teachers are still ultimately human, complete with their own weaknesses. Perhaps the final lesson is that even disappointment is a part of life"".Same goes for the great Manohla Dargis on the LA Times: ""Apparently, the French are not so very different, after all"".",1,Yet another boring French documentary on an otherwise interesting topic.,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2376,"['found', 'film', 'simply', 'irritating.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'Maybe', 'who', 'are', 'teaching', 'who', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'kids', 'who', 'do', 'rural', 'sociology', 'must', 'be', 'forgetting', 'other', 'trade', '.But', 'most', 'only', 'how', 'difficult', 'must', 'be', 'teach', 'VERY', 'young', 'kids', 'how', 'vital', 'role', 'Kim', 'Anehall', 'so', 'well', 'Amazon', 'Be', 'Have', 'true', 'insights', 'job', 'teachers', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'everyday', 'heroes', 'last', 'line', 'defense', 'developing', 'society', 'think', 'director', 'Philibert', 'never', 'scrapes', 'surface', 'teaching', 'process', 'leaving', 'instead', 'plain', 'empiria', 'lessons', 'staked', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'would', 'like', 'prove', 'how', 'good', 'teaching', 'person', 'reviewer', 'notes', 'camera', 'very', 'clearly', 'when', 'kids', 'have', 'learnt', 'lesson', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'most', 'times', '.The', 'stark', 'contrast', 'conditons', 'life', 'France', 'compared', 'underdeveloped', 'country', 'painful', 'teacher', 'big', 'Audi', 'schools', 'are', 'nice', 'lofty', 'have', 'necessary', 'equipment', 'kind', 'things', 'people', 'take', 'granted', 'developed', 'world', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'system', 'back', 'country', 'Argentina', 'Specifically', 'conurbano', 'bonaerense', 'where', 'teachers', 'are', ""n't"", 'paid', 'months', 'pupils', 'go', 'school', 'basically', 'have', 'meal', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'back', 'home', 'violence', 'rule', 'game.I', 'laughed', 'one', 'American', 'reviewer', 'when', 'said', 'probaby', 'JoJo', 'would', 'be', 'medicated', 'US', 'want', 'know', 'different', 'methods', 'education', 'could', 'always', 'watch', 'instance', 'Kiarostami', 'Where', 'Friend', 'Home', 'learn', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'world', 'lives.The', 'cinematography', 'very', 'nice.I', 'agree', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'Matt', 'Curtin', 'Columbus', 'OH', 'USA', ""Lopez'saga"", 'suits', 'would', 'later', 'claim', 'was', 'due', 'additional', 'compensation', 'was', 'never', 'part', 'deal', 'interaction', 'young', 'JoJo', 'even', 'greatest', 'teachers', 'are', 'still', 'ultimately', 'human', 'complete', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'Perhaps', 'final', 'lesson', 'even', 'disappointment', 'part', 'life', '.Same', 'great', 'Manohla', 'Dargis', 'LA', 'Times', 'Apparently', 'French', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'different']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

827604,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000296E7W,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[40, 41]","To Be and to Have is a spontaneous documentary depicting the hard work a teacher continuously provides for his students in a rural part of France where mountains loom in the background.  The words 'hard work' are relative as it is manually considered light work while the hours and the emotional patience might be weary on the hardest of men.  In addition, very few teachers are recognized for the work they provide for an emerging generation that will eventually take over from the current generation.  Nonetheless, the teacher's satisfaction is provided through the success of those he teaches, as they will move away and in due time discover what secrets rest behind the mountains.The teacher, Georges Lopez, teaches a combined elementary school where the student's age varies with the youngest at about four years old.  Despite the wide range of ages among the students Mr. Lopez succeeds in teaching them what is needed to advance academically.  The students learn how to draw and write proper letters and numbers and learn what diameter and radius mean.  One of the amusing moments in the film is when the younger students learn how to crack an egg and one student misses the bowl while cracking the egg to which Mr. Lopez simply says, ""It's ok.""  This displays how Mr. Lopez does not miss an opportunity for learning, as the child learns a lesson in how to deal with failure.  There is a serenity surrounding Mr. Lopez to which the students seem to respond well, which is implemented even when he is dealing with bullying and fighting.  It is easy to see that Mr. Lopez has a job that he loves, as he also mentions that he could not imagine having a different job.The students are uncomplicated kids that prefer to play during recess and chat among one another.  However, the students show an immense respect for Mr. Lopez who keeps them in line and on task as he holds them accountable for their work or lack of work.  In one scene there is a student, Jojo, who has not finished his assignment as he wants to go out for recess, but Mr. Lopez keeps him inside and makes it clear that he must finish his assignment now and not later.  These students learn not only academic skills through Mr. Lopez, but also social skills through verbal communication along with work ethic.  These verbal skills are practiced and demonstrated when two students are being reprimanded after a fight, which Mr. Lopez verbally guides the two boys through.It is pure joy to watch Mr. Lopez handle each and every situation in school, outside of school, and during recess as no situation is the same.  Films such as Stand and Deliver (1988), Dead Poets Society (1989), and Emperor's Club (2002) offers insights and the beauty of an enlightening education, but these films do not affect the audience in the way To Be and to Have does as the students truly display a sincere manner in which most children learn.  The difficulty a teacher faces in order to get and continue to maintain their attention focused on educational material can be monumental, but in the fiction films this is merely displayed through one situation and with a wink of the magic wand where all students sit in nice rows and pays attention.Mr. Lopez should have had one more year of teaching when Nicolas Philibert finished shooting the film, which means he has entered retirement by now.  In 30-some years Mr. Lopez worked with numerous students as many other teacher have done before him and teachers will continue to do after his retirement.  The notion of all the hard work that teachers provide for children are seldom appreciated as many even think teachers are overpaid.  However, the audience should consider that without teachers there would not be a progressing civilization, as teachers encourage the young generations inquisitiveness and quests for knowledge, which are a fundamental piece of technological evolution.  In addition, teachers help foster social skills which are essential for society's well-being as people must try to get along whether they like or dislike one another.  Thus, To Be and to Have offers some true insights on the job as teachers should be regarded as everyday heroes in the last line of defense in a developing society.",5,A Close and Warm Documentary - Spontaneously Brilliant!!!,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,4216,"['Be', 'Have', 'spontaneous', 'documentary', 'depicting', 'hard', 'work', 'teacher', 'continuously', 'students', 'rural', 'part', 'France', 'where', 'loom', 'background', 'words', 'work', 'are', 'relative', 'manually', 'considered', 'light', 'work', 'hours', 'emotional', 'patience', 'might', 'be', 'weary', 'hardest', 'men', 'addition', 'very', 'few', 'teachers', 'are', 'recognized', 'work', 'provide', 'emerging', 'generation', 'will', 'eventually', 'take', 'over', 'current', 'generation', 'Nonetheless', 'teacher', 'satisfaction', 'provided', 'success', 'will', 'move', 'away', 'due', 'time', 'discover', 'what', 'rest', 'mountains.The', 'teacher', 'Georges', 'Lopez', 'combined', 'elementary', 'school', 'where', 'student', 'age', 'youngest', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'wide', 'range', 'ages', 'students', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'teaching', 'what', 'needed', 'advance', 'academically', 'students', 'learn', 'how', 'draw', 'write', 'proper', 'letters', 'numbers', 'learn', 'what', 'diameter', 'radius', 'mean', 'One', 'amusing', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'younger', 'students', 'learn', 'how', 'crack', 'egg', 'one', 'student', 'bowl', 'cracking', 'egg', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'simply', 'ok.', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'not', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'learning', 'child', 'lesson', 'how', 'deal', 'failure', 'serenity', 'surrounding', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'students', 'seem', 'respond', 'well', 'implemented', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'bullying', 'fighting', 'easy', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'job', 'also', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'having', 'different', 'job.The', 'students', 'are', 'uncomplicated', 'kids', 'prefer', 'play', 'recess', 'chat', 'one', 'However', 'students', 'show', 'immense', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'who', 'line', 'task', 'accountable', 'work', 'lack', 'work', 'one', 'scene', 'student', 'Jojo', 'who', 'not', 'finished', 'assignment', 'go', 'out', 'recess', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'inside', 'clear', 'must', 'finish', 'assignment', 'now', 'not', 'later', 'students', 'learn', 'not', 'only', 'academic', 'skills', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'also', 'social', 'skills', 'verbal', 'communication', 'work', 'ethic', 'verbal', 'skills', 'are', 'practiced', 'demonstrated', 'when', 'two', 'students', 'are', 'being', 'reprimanded', 'fight', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'verbally', 'two', 'boys', 'through.It', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'situation', 'school', 'school', 'recess', 'situation', 'same', 'Films', 'such', 'Stand', 'Deliver', '1988', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', '1989', 'Emperor', 'Club', '2002', 'insights', 'beauty', 'enlightening', 'education', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'affect', 'audience', 'way', 'Be', 'Have', 'students', 'truly', 'display', 'sincere', 'manner', 'most', 'children', 'learn', 'difficulty', 'teacher', 'order', 'get', 'continue', 'maintain', 'attention', 'focused', 'educational', 'material', 'can', 'be', 'monumental', 'fiction', 'films', 'merely', 'displayed', 'one', 'situation', 'wink', 'magic', 'wand', 'where', 'students', 'sit', 'nice', 'rows', 'pays', 'attention.Mr', 'Lopez', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'year', 'teaching', 'when', 'Nicolas', 'Philibert', 'finished', 'shooting', 'film', 'entered', 'retirement', 'now', '30-some', 'years', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'worked', 'numerous', 'students', 'many', 'other', 'teacher', 'have', 'done', 'teachers', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'retirement', 'notion', 'hard', 'work', 'teachers', 'provide', 'children', 'are', 'seldom', 'appreciated', 'many', 'even', 'think', 'teachers', 'are', 'overpaid', 'However', 'audience', 'should', 'consider', 'teachers', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'progressing', 'civilization', 'teachers', 'encourage', 'young', 'generations', 'inquisitiveness', 'quests', 'knowledge', 'are', 'fundamental', 'piece', 'technological', 'evolution', 'addition', 'teachers', 'help', 'foster', 'social', 'skills', 'are', 'essential', 'society', 'well-being', 'people', 'must', 'try', 'get', 'like', 'dislike', 'one', 'Thus', 'Be', 'Have', 'true', 'insights', 'job', 'teachers', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'everyday', 'heroes', 'last', 'line', 'defense', 'developing', 'society']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

827611,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000296E7W,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[0, 1]","This oddly named, Frederick Wiseman style documentary does a fine job of showing the daily life of a teacher and his students in a rural French school, with a few glimpses of their parents. M. Lopez is a dedicated teacher who rather masterfully manages the 13 students in his one-room school, while displaying no particular brilliance at doing more than keeping them orderly and occupied at not-so-interesting tasks. About to retire, after 35 years in the profession, M. Lopez may represent to conservative French audiences the value of ""old-school"" teaching methods, which produce a kind of regimented acquiescence in the presence of authority. The lack of restlessness among his young charges is remarkable, as is their frequent reticence, and one begins to wonder how much their behavior is influenced by the presence of a camera crew.Having spent my own early years in a 2-room country school, I found it all vaguely familiar and somewhat unsettling, as these students seemed poorly prepared for the modern world. Meanwhile, the librarian at the middle school where they take a field day talks of all the books on the shelves, but there is not a single computer in view anywhere. The students in M. Lopez' school, especially the younger ones, are endearing and sometimes full of life - especially when they are outside of the classroom - but the quietude of the older ones is disturbing. Only one shows a spark of resistance - and is scolded for his ""attitude"" - and he seems likely to grow up a farmer like his parents who run a dairy, where education seems to be and have a low priority. In one scene we see the boy, maybe 10 years old, adroitly operating a tractor, though he's hardly big enough for his feet to reach the foot pedals.As a documentary filmmaker, director Philibert captures much with his camera and edits it all together in a way that seems to catch life as it is lived - at the pace of life itself, often slow. Teachers (as some have already noted here) may well have reservations about it all. The DVD includes an informative interview with the director.",4,cinema verite . . .,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,2079,"['oddly', 'named', 'Frederick', 'Wiseman', 'style', 'documentary', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'daily', 'life', 'teacher', 'students', 'rural', 'French', 'school', 'few', 'glimpses', 'parents', 'M.', 'Lopez', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'who', 'rather', 'masterfully', '13', 'students', 'one-room', 'school', 'displaying', 'particular', 'brilliance', 'doing', 'more', 'keeping', 'orderly', 'occupied', 'not-so-interesting', 'tasks', 'retire', '35', 'years', 'profession', 'M.', 'Lopez', 'may', 'represent', 'conservative', 'French', 'audiences', 'value', 'old-school', 'teaching', 'methods', 'produce', 'kind', 'regimented', 'acquiescence', 'presence', 'authority', 'lack', 'restlessness', 'young', 'charges', 'remarkable', 'frequent', 'reticence', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'behavior', 'influenced', 'presence', 'camera', 'crew.Having', 'spent', 'own', 'early', 'years', '2-room', 'country', 'school', 'found', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'students', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'prepared', 'modern', 'world', 'Meanwhile', 'librarian', 'middle', 'school', 'where', 'take', 'field', 'day', 'talks', 'books', 'shelves', 'not', 'single', 'computer', 'view', 'anywhere', 'students', 'M.', 'Lopez', 'school', 'especially', 'younger', 'ones', 'are', 'endearing', 'sometimes', 'full', 'life', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'classroom', 'quietude', 'older', 'ones', 'disturbing', 'Only', 'one', 'spark', 'resistance', 'scolded', 'attitude', 'likely', 'grow', 'up', 'farmer', 'parents', 'who', 'run', 'dairy', 'where', 'education', 'be', 'have', 'low', 'priority', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'boy', 'maybe', '10', 'years', 'old', 'adroitly', 'operating', 'tractor', 'hardly', 'big', 'enough', 'feet', 'reach', 'foot', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'director', 'Philibert', 'much', 'camera', 'together', 'way', 'catch', 'life', 'lived', 'pace', 'life', 'often', 'slow', 'Teachers', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'here', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'reservations', 'DVD', 'informative', 'interview', 'director']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)

827613,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000296E7W,Westley,"[2, 2]","""To Be and to Have"" is a somewhat unusual documentary, as it has no narration, very few interviews, and no profound message.  Instead, we see the everyday events in a one-room rural French elementary school.  The lone teacher, Monsieur Lopez, oversees all the educational activities of the children (about 12 in total from ages 4 to 12 years), which vary from French dictation to making crepes to a field trip to the bucolic countryside.  He also lives above the school.  The class is his entire life, and he's obviously totally dedicated to the students.The cameras follow this class over the course of a year, which is also the second to last year of Monsieur Lopez's 35 years of teaching.  Nothing earth-shattering happens - just kids being kids.  The film focuses more on some students than others of course, particularly young JoJo who has difficulty paying attention.  Although JoJo often takes up much of his time, Monsieur Lopez doesn't seem to mind, and he'll take extra time in the library to quiz JoJo on his counting and joke around with him as well.  If only all classrooms allowed this kind of one-on-one interaction!  Some of the other interesting students include withdrawn Nathalie, bickering Julien and Olivier, know-it-all Marie, and ghost-fearing Axel.  A few of the students get little coverage, which made me a little sad, but I suspect that they get their fair share of attention in this warm, loving classroom.Director Nicholas Philibert has done a superb job of filming this documentary.  The look of it is unlike any other I've seen.  After watching about 20 minutes, I questioned whether I had misread that it was a documentary, as it was so cinematic.  I think many teachers will love this documentary, although some may find it too far removed from their experiences in crowded classrooms.  Also, one shouldn't view this documentary as a lesson in how to teach - Monsieur Lopez's teaching style seems effective but is clearly not meant for everyone.  Non-teachers who like kids will also greatly enjoy this one-of-a-kind film.",4,Bon education,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",2008,2055,"['Be', 'Have', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'documentary', 'narration', 'very', 'few', 'interviews', 'profound', 'message', 'Instead', 'see', 'everyday', 'events', 'one-room', 'rural', 'French', 'elementary', 'school', 'lone', 'teacher', 'Monsieur', 'Lopez', 'educational', 'activities', 'children', '12', 'total', 'ages', '4', '12', 'years', 'vary', 'French', 'dictation', 'making', 'crepes', 'field', 'trip', 'bucolic', 'countryside', 'also', 'school', 'class', 'entire', 'life', 'obviously', 'totally', 'dedicated', 'students.The', 'cameras', 'follow', 'class', 'course', 'year', 'also', 'second', 'last', 'year', 'Monsieur', 'Lopez', '35', 'years', 'teaching', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'happens', 'just', 'kids', 'being', 'kids', 'film', 'more', 'students', 'others', 'course', 'particularly', 'young', 'JoJo', 'who', 'difficulty', 'paying', 'attention', 'JoJo', 'often', 'up', 'much', 'time', 'Monsieur', 'Lopez', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'take', 'extra', 'time', 'library', 'quiz', 'JoJo', 'counting', 'joke', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'classrooms', 'allowed', 'kind', 'one-on-one', 'interaction', 'other', 'interesting', 'students', 'include', 'withdrawn', 'Nathalie', 'bickering', 'Julien', 'Olivier', 'know-it-all', 'Marie', 'ghost-fearing', 'Axel', 'A', 'few', 'students', 'get', 'little', 'coverage', 'made', 'little', 'sad', 'suspect', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'attention', 'warm', 'loving', 'classroom.Director', 'Nicholas', 'Philibert', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'filming', 'documentary', 'look', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'watching', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'questioned', 'had', 'misread', 'was', 'documentary', 'was', 'so', 'cinematic', 'think', 'many', 'teachers', 'will', 'love', 'documentary', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'experiences', 'crowded', 'classrooms', 'Also', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'view', 'documentary', 'lesson', 'how', 'teach', 'Monsieur', 'Lopez', 'teaching', 'style', 'effective', 'clearly', 'not', 'meant', 'everyone', 'Non-teachers', 'who', 'like', 'kids', 'will', 'also', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film']",Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have (Original French Version with English Subtitles)
