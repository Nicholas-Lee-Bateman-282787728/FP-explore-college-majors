The special effects were all right, as Hallmark always does well in that regard, but everything else was just.... stupid.I first saw this on TV years ago, but I didn't realise just how distorted a movie it was, probably because I had missed the parts with Lot. Though it already struck me as very strange, such as having the ark in a forest setting when, if I am not mistaken, the area where Noah resided was desert. And of course, those pirates or whatever... I thought Noah and his family were the only people alive during the flood?Anyway, I got this in a Hallmark DVD box set which included In The Beginning (a gorgeous film, especially its retelling of Joseph's story), and Ten Commandments (not the Charlton Heston one, the Hallmark one. Very good too, although the second half of it was dragging). When i watched it in its entirety, I was horrified. By then, I had already been hearing strange things about it (NOAH saving LOT from Sodom?!?!?), and it was even stranger than I expected.Yes, it ruined the Bible story in more ways than one - the abovementioned was ONLY the beginning of all the absurdities, apparently. And the actors were all so annoying, most especially Lot's wife and Noah's daughters-in-law. Lot's wife, I REALLY couldn't stand, and am glad she was eliminated early on in the film.Also stupid were those pirates, that trader/peddler guy, and Noah's wife calling that white horse ""Pegasus,"" which was additionally an anachronism.The dialogue was so retarded. And the portrayal of God was... disturbing. Enough has been said on this... but yes, I did not like it. It did not rest well with me. It is..... not what really happened.One of the really bad Biblical movies alongside 'Joseph and His Brethren,' a horrible retelling of Joseph from the 60s (?). And it's just...........

For a made-for-TV movie, from Hallmark, this is the worst thing I have ever seen posing as a Bible story!I don't mind that they tried to incorporate the story of Sodom & Gomorrha to show the wickedness of mankind, and that they made Lot into Noah's best friend. They went too far, though, when they had Lot become a pirate who survived the flood and tries to take over the ark with his own pirate crew. Seriously, that's in this movie!The most offensive thing towards the Bible is when Noah and his wife are reflecting upon God's destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah. Noah says they need to find a scribe to write down the story, to which his dizzy wife says, ""Oh, you can't trust them. Scribbling scribes have the worst reputation--they change things! By the time they get through with it, they'll probably say we weren't even there!""I can't believe that a Bible movie would discredit the reliability of scripture itself!

But, hey, the movie's been made and the damage is already done.  As  a putrid piece of celluloid fluff, this one ranks up there with other bad  movies like &quot;Can't Stop The Music&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot;.  It's  perfect for Bad Movie Night, if you're into that sort of thing. The plot  line is flimsy, the special effects are cheap, and the acting is bad.  The  movie did elicit a few chuckles, but I don't think that was the producers'  intention.  Some scenes are downright ludicrous, such as when Noah and his  wife try to find one good person in Sodom.  They settle on Lot who,  although he participated in a drunken feast and orgy earlier in the movie  (offscreen, thankfully), is chosen ONLY because he's Noah's best friend.  This is how they pick people to be saved from the wrath of God!  Or when  Noah gets help from God after complaining that he'll never get the Ark  finished in time for the flood; he wakes up with what looks like the lumber  yard at Home Depot (didn't know they had 2X4's in those days?...you do  now!).  Or why Noah and his wife have American accents, while their three  sons have British accents, which they still have well into their early  20's!  The inaccuracies go on and on.  One thing that must be mentioned is  that this is a heavily edited version of the original that appeared on TV:  gone are the flood-surviving fireball-throwing pirates (fireballs in a  wooden ship, go figure!), the anti-pre-marital sex gorilla, the obnoxiously  stupid talking puppet made from an orange, and the hysterically yet  unintentionally funny pooping koala blooper scene.

466348,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,6305487871,Danny G.,"[4, 22]","The God from the Old Testament thought more highly of his non-human creation that He commanded Noah to use the vast majority of His ark to save them from the flood. Having been raised a  religious person, it never dawned on me, at least in this Bible story, God was more interested in saving the animal world than in salvaging the human race!It was apparent that there were plenty of worthy people to save other than Noah's family, and his future daughter-in-laws. The film's writers give us fictionalized examples: No one can deny the goodness of Ruth's mother, or the unnamed peddler. God didn't want other worthy people aboard despite how easy it would have been to rescue them! But God did save the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches!I'm not justifying this particular God's obvious brutality. A theme which clearly runs through the Noah's Ark story.  But it is important for all of us to come to terms with the simple fact: God greatly cherishes ALL of his non-human creation!One of my favorite scenes was when a pair of Dodo's, now long extinct by the hands of selfish and foolish men, waddled up the ark's ramp! Another treasured moment was when Noah talks his wife out of throwing the tarantulas and hissing cockroaches out the ark's window, dooming them to extinction! Noah said essentially, ""everything is interrelated, other creatures depend on them, and what gives you the right to doom any species to extinction?!""I'm sure this went over most viewers heads, but Noah's Ark is first, and foremost, about saving God's creation from extinction! All of it! Not just what is intelligent, pretty, or convenient! This pearl of wisdom is the foundation of the United State's majestic Endangered Species Act. Something which would make the God of the Old Testament very proud, indeed!There are plenty of reasons why this film will make fundamentalists, and other religious folks, very unhappy.

466355,APBRAL723MUM4,6305487871,EJon,"[0, 1]","Let's make this clear, I'm rating this highly because it's a very entertaining BAD movie.  If you like that sort of thing (and you know who you are), this may be the movie for you.  If you're looking for a serious Biblical epic or an *intentionally* funny movie, keep looking.I saw some clips on Encore, and assumed it was a parody (think ""Monty Python's Life of Noah"").  Then I googled it, and realized it was meant to be taken seriously.  With that in mind, it's kind of like a horrible car wreck you can't look away from.Where to start...First of all, they combine the stories of Sodom and Gomorra.  Since I don't actually believe either one, this didn't bother me so much.  God warns Noah that He's going to destroy Sodom, and Lot gets saved because he's Noah's friend, rather than the whole ""Please rape my daughters"" thing that's in the Bible.  In fact, Lot's daughters are left out entirely, which also gets them out of the awkward part where he gets drunk and has sex with them after they leave the city (what, you never learned that part in Sunday school?).  The Ark stuff comes later.In order to make appeal to a wider audience, the ""punched it up"" a bit, with action, cheesy special effects, and attempts at humor, some which are funny - although the funniest bits are unintentional.  There's also an incredible amount talent wasted on this film.  Oscar winners (!) Jon Voight and F. Murray Abraham play Noah and Lot, with Mary Steenburgen and Carol Kane playing their wives.  Even James Coburn makes a couple cameos.  Their salaries didn't leave them a lot left over for minor things like decent sets. The battle scenes really do look like Monty Python. In addition to playing Noah, Voight also provides the voice of God, presumably because they couldn't afford James Earl Jones.  Also, what is it about made for TV movies and accents?  Noah and his wife clearly have American accents, while most other people - including their kids -  have strong British accents.The tone is a roller coaster, ranging from sincerely reverent, to bawdy humor (Lot: ""Not staying for the orgy, Noah?"") to actual slapstick (Lot's wife fall head first into a vat of dye at one point).  The music faithfully tracks the tone, transitioning from Cecile B. DeMille to Three Stooges.You may wonder why the flood happens only halfway through the movie.  Without giving any spoilers, I'll just say that there's plenty to come.  Grab your beer and popcorn, because that's when things get *really* weird.So if you like to watch bad movies and give them the Mystery Science 3000 treatment, keep this one in mind.I dinged it one star because as a two part miniseries, it's a bit too long, and when it's not really bad, it's merely boring.

466360,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,6305487871,Joshua Koppel,"[57, 64]","NBC created a two-part epic of the story of Noah's Ark.  It was created by the team that did Merlin and Alice in Wonderland but will probably be remembered as being by the same people who did The Tempest.  It was really bad.Just how bad the show was can probably be summed up by saying that in one scene Noah greeted Lot.  For those a little rusty on their Old Testament, Noah can be found in Genesis chapter 6 while Lot is Genesis chapter 19.  This epic opened with the tale of Lot (minus Abraham) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (also minus Abraham).One thing that really puzzled me about this production was the way the locals kept treating Noah as if he were a fool.  This puzzles me because the locals all knew that Noah had the only farm in the land where anything would grow.  So would frustrated and hungry farmers merely laugh at Noah or would they hate him and raid his farm?  I was also amused when some of the locals began quoting Shakespeare.  At another point a Michael Palin look-alike runs up dressed in rags and with a long scraggly beard and says, &quot;Its.&quot;  A brief moment of humor for Monty Python fans but I don't know why it was in there.But the writers of Noah's Ark did take from one good source, mainly the Broadway musical Two by Two starring Danny Kaye.  Unfortunately the stolen scene was one of Noah's sons claiming the Ark was not finished because it did not have a rudder.  Now if he were right and the Ark needed a rudder then God made a mistake.  But it would also meant that Noah's son would have to be strong enough to operate a rudder on a boat three-hundred cubits in length.  But the ark was built by God and not Noah.  The writers also kept pushing the idea that an ark is a boat.  No, but Noah's Ark took the form of a boat.  An ark is simply a sacred container for the safe storage of something precious.  Any fan of Indiana Jones knows that (or did he dig up a boat in Tannis?).This production is available on video and DVD and my recommendation is that it should be avoided.",1,Let's Rewrite the Bible,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,2034,"['NBC', 'created', 'two-part', 'epic', 'story', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'was', 'created', 'team', 'did', 'Merlin', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'remembered', 'being', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'Tempest', 'was', 'really', 'bad.Just', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'saying', 'one', 'scene', 'Noah', 'greeted', 'Lot', 'little', 'rusty', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Noah', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Genesis', 'chapter', '6', 'Lot', 'Genesis', 'chapter', '19', 'epic', 'opened', 'tale', 'Lot', 'Abraham', 'destruction', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'also', 'minus', 'Abraham', '.One', 'thing', 'really', 'puzzled', 'production', 'was', 'way', 'locals', 'kept', 'treating', 'Noah', 'were', 'fool', 'locals', 'knew', 'Noah', 'had', 'only', 'farm', 'land', 'where', 'anything', 'would', 'grow', 'So', 'would', 'frustrated', 'hungry', 'farmers', 'merely', 'laugh', 'Noah', 'would', 'hate', 'raid', 'farm', 'was', 'also', 'amused', 'when', 'locals', 'began', 'quoting', 'Shakespeare', 'point', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'look-alike', 'up', 'dressed', 'rags', 'long', 'scraggly', 'beard', 'quot', 'Its.', 'quot', 'brief', 'moment', 'humor', 'Monty', 'Python', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'there.But', 'writers', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'did', 'take', 'one', 'good', 'source', 'mainly', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Two', 'Two', 'starring', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Unfortunately', 'stolen', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'Noah', 'sons', 'claiming', 'Ark', 'was', 'not', 'finished', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'rudder', 'Now', 'were', 'right', 'Ark', 'needed', 'rudder', 'then', 'God', 'made', 'mistake', 'would', 'also', 'meant', 'Noah', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'operate', 'rudder', 'boat', 'three-hundred', 'cubits', 'length', 'ark', 'was', 'built', 'God', 'not', 'Noah', 'writers', 'also', 'kept', 'pushing', 'idea', 'ark', 'boat', 'No', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'took', 'form', 'boat', 'ark', 'simply', 'sacred', 'container', 'safe', 'storage', 'something', 'precious', 'fan', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'did', 'dig', 'up', 'boat', 'Tannis', '.This', 'production', 'available', 'video', 'DVD', 'recommendation', 'should', 'be', 'avoided']",Noah's Ark

Bernabo,"[12, 13]","""Noah's Ark"" must inspire everybody in Hollywood who dreams of making a movie because it proves that there is no idea so outrageous that somebody will not ante up several millions of dollars to put it on film.  Granted, the Bible stories found in Genesis are sketched out rather than told as fully developed narratives, but this goes well beyond filling in the gaps.  In a mini-series that is jaw-droppingly bad, what is the part in the script by Peter Barnes where your jaw becomes unhinged: for my money that is when the pirates attack the Ark during the Flood.So do I really have to say anything more than that?I would not take the position that any dramatic license with scripture is by definition wrong.  My favorite scene in ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is when Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son while he is at the house of Matthew the taxcollector and the morally offended Peter is standing in the doorway listening.  It is a brilliant use of the parable mainly because it provides an appropriate spiritual context.  But there is nothing like that in this debacle.  I am sure this was sold on being a Bible Disaster Flick, the Genesis version of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  Instead it ends up being something more akin to an Ed Wood film.To add insult to injury, the film actually does try to deal with the ""big"" question, as to why God created humans but was so troubled by their exercising their free will to be evil.  ""Noah's Ark"" suggests that one of the reasons for the Flood was to give God enough time to think up an answer.  I always knew the story of the Flood was an object lesson for humanity, but apparently it was really just an oral exam for Noah.""Noah's Ark"" does not get a single star for two reasons.  First, no one actually dies in the making of the film, therefore it is a step up from being a snuff film.  Second, the film has to inspire people to read the Bible story of Noah's Ark simply because the vast majority of people who find themselves sitting through this film are going to want to go check out what the Bible really has to say about the Flood.

As other reviews have very well mentioned, this film is not based on the Bible.This movie starts out with a war scene in a violent, sex-crazed society.  I can give it that, I'd imagine the pre-flood society to be something like this.  Then it just goes down hill, we are introduced to Noah's friend ""Lot"", and yes this is apparently the Lot in the bible because they both flee Sodom together, and Lot's wife even turns into a pillar of salt!About an hour into the film, we get to the point of the movie, where Noah starts to build the ark.  Fortunately for Noah, God gets impatient with him and gathers and builds a majority of the ark for him.The animals are gathered, and Noah and family shut the door.  Wait a minute, in the bible, God shuts the door?  Flood happens, everyone dies, oh but wait, there is a traveling salesman who sells Noah alcohol after the flood so he can get drunk, and there are also pirates on the water after the great flood to try and seize the ark (Have you heard enough yet?)And probably worse of all, which is why I'm trashing this film, near the end of this film, ""God"" is viewed as a being who can't make up his mind, first he wants to save Noah, then he wants to destroy him, then he leaves and forsakes him for a time, then he comes back to tell him he's going to die, then after a crazy dance he changes his mind and will save him again.

I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally.The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary ""spice"" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals.
