A summer sitting in the shell at South Shields listening to a colliery band, the shell of the arena protecting us from the bitter, northern wind, is a good memory. This movie has a feel good quality (no not Tara or Tara and Ewan) but the storyline that has worked for so many British films milking the genre of the working class community struggling to make good. But this film has bite. It is not all beer and cornets. A bleak thread runs through this film. Working industries toppling to their knees, families disintegrating, values taken for granted changed and changed beyond repair. There is the perfect antidote to Ronald mcDonald in this film, the clown of despair. It is a film that as well as the schmultz (Tara and Ewan) is about the universal of working communiuties struggling to put food on the table and support famlies. The dysfunction when misogeny and loss of work identity collide and pride is stripped from a man. Of course it has to all end happy like, but what the heck! There is enough in it to make it watchable without needing the brown bag. And last words to Mr Postelthwaite's character ""I used to think music matters, does it bollocks! its people that matter!""

Hopefully, you'll pay little attention to the cover box shot of Ewan MacGregor and Tara Fitzgerald.  Yes, they're excellent here, but their sappy sub-plot represents only a small part of the movie.  It's far from the best part, and their upbeat mugs are not at all representative of the main themes and prevailing mood of the film.This film can be best described as a pre-Full Monty Full Monty.  But it wears its heart on its sleeve far more prominently than The Full Monty does.  You may not agree with the politics espoused here (which are virulently anti-Thatcher), but you have to admire a film with the guts to lay its emotions out so honestly like this one does.  Reminds me of &quot;Three Kings&quot; in that way.Here are four good reasons to pick up this film for a viewing:1. For an American viewer, it's a good primer on the UK coal industry and the &quot;changes&quot; (quotes intended) undertaken to it during Margaret Thatcher's administration.2. Fantastic music.  Even if you don't regard yourself as a brass band fan, the presentations of the songs in this film are quite stirring.3. Tara Fitzgerald.  Certainly better here vs. the bizarre setting that was &quot;Sirens.&quot;  She really looks great in this film.4. Peter Postlethwaite.  The center around which this movie revolves.

Millions of miners and their families were left redundant, that is, no job, no hope, no future.  Into this dismal situation a small group of men manage to bring an iota of dignity and brilliant music to their lives.  Brassed Off is a political comment on Margaret Thatcher's government.  It is a film that hides its political cheek in between the sheets of music played by the real Grimelythorpe Colliary Band. Ewan McGregor plays miner Andy Barrow, a small town boy whose nothing life goes nowhere.  Tara Fitzgerald is the girl who left for school but returns to try and stave off the closing of the town's mine with her well intentioned but useless report.  Veteran character actor Pete Postelwaithe is the band's conductor whose lungs are black, but his head and heart are in the music competition he desperately wants his band to win.

Having been in a british-style brass band here in the United States that went to the ""nationals"" (NABBA), this was a very enjoyable movie to watch.  Ewen McGregor is listed as a supporting actor in the movie, but it is really an ensemble cast.  Pete Postlethwaite runs amuck going from highs to absolute lows throughout the picture.  The brass band is a real band from England and this is a true story that is being told.  The William Tell Overture would never be used as the ""test"" piece for a brass band championship, but it is very recognizeable to a wider audience and makes for a great finale piece as it is used in the movie.

433957,AUHG8KSHI529U,6304707029,Craig Matteson,"[3, 6]","Unfortunately, this movie came out around the time of ""The Full Monty"" and it also deals with the unemployed in dying industries in Britain.  Where ""The Full Monty"" is funny ""Brassed Off"" is serious and wrenching.  No punches pulled here.  It avoids bathos because it keeps it eyes focused on the bewildered pain of the coal miners and their families.  ""Monty"" became a huge hit and ""Brassed Off"" went away largely unwatched.  It deserved better.The story is set in the time of Margaret Thatcher.  Many of the old government owned industries were drowning the government and bleeding taxpayers.  They were privatized or closed.  This caused terribly painful dislocations (as did the much needed recession in the US in the early 1980s).  Through this movie we get to see how these dislocations crushed everyday folks caught in the moving parts of these changes.  I come from a working class background and have seen the pain of recession and dislocation up close and personal.  It hurts and really fine people who work hard and just want to get through life are often damaged severely.The Grimley colliery (a colliery is coal mine and attendant structures) has been in operation for a long time.  One of the traditions of many large working class operations is a brass band whose players are drawn from the workers.  In the United States, community brass bands were quite common until WWII.  The Grimley band (there is a real life Grimethorpe Colliery band that plays the music in the film) has a long and proud tradition and in the movie is led by Danny (played by the fabulous Pete Postlethwaite).  It even has its fans and groupies who dye their hair the same shade of purple as the band uniforms.The music in the film is a wonderful device and only partly because the band music sounds so good.  Art is always an extravagance.  How much do you sacrifice in time and money for it?  That is always the question and the balance.  As I say, my parents worked hard as I was growing up.  However, my Dad sang beautifully and the love he and his friends had for music rubbed off on me.  Heaven knows the price my own wife and children have paid for my devotion to that art.Danny's son, Phil (poignantly done by Stephen Tompkinson), plays trombone and is a bit of a bumbler.  He supplements his income for his family by being a rather inept clown as well.  There is a beautiful but awful side story in the film about Phil's need of a new trombone and his struggle to balance that against the needs of his family and yet what price art?  His wife bears the cost of his devotion in wrenching ways.  Phil is the point on which all the weight of this film bears to crushing effect.A young Ewan McGregor plays Andy.  For me, Andy points to the whole heart of the problem.  Andy is a very bright young man.  He really does understand what is going on.  However, he has always felt like a loser, so he turns himself into one.  When I see the passivity and sense of entitlement in the soon to be redundant miners, I frankly get a bit frustrated.  No power on earth can stop economic dislocations from happening.  Oh, they can be delayed, but a greater cataclysm will follow.  And why should other taxpayers be forever burdened with providing a subsidized living for an inefficient industry?  Yes, the Grimley pit was making money, or so the report showed.However, none of these people had enough of a financial education to put the pit in the broader context to see if it made sense to operate one pit.  This is what bothers me.  We have to do a better job of preparing people to make changes in their lives.  We have to equip them with a better understanding of economics and finance.  Of course, that will make them more expensive, but they will be more expensive because they will be able to create more value.  Being more flexible with the ability to provide more value is a good thing.I won't get into the whole drama of the movie except to say that it is honest and touching.  The politics are quite anti-Thatcherite, which is appropriate for the characters.  However, I think the filmmakers were pushing their own agenda a bit through the voice of the characters and that is a tad bothersome.  Thatcher was no more responsible for the economic dislocations than gravity would be if you fell off a roof.  But I guess you have to blame someone and she was certainly convenient.In any case, a fine movie.  The language is a bit rough and you might (might) have a bit of a trouble with the working class accents.  I encourage you to see it.",5,A serious film whose honest heart makes it worth seeing,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,4530,"['Unfortunately', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'Full', 'Monty', 'also', 'unemployed', 'dying', 'industries', 'Britain', 'Where', 'Full', 'Monty', 'funny', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'serious', 'wrenching', 'punches', 'pulled', 'here', 'bathos', 'focused', 'bewildered', 'pain', 'coal', 'miners', 'families', 'Monty', 'became', 'huge', 'hit', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'went', 'away', 'largely', 'unwatched', 'deserved', 'better.The', 'story', 'set', 'time', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Many', 'old', 'government', 'owned', 'industries', 'were', 'drowning', 'government', 'bleeding', 'taxpayers', 'were', 'privatized', 'closed', 'caused', 'terribly', 'painful', 'dislocations', 'did', 'much', 'needed', 'recession', 'US', 'early', '1980s', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'dislocations', 'crushed', 'everyday', 'folks', 'caught', 'moving', 'parts', 'changes', 'come', 'working', 'class', 'background', 'have', 'seen', 'pain', 'recession', 'dislocation', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'really', 'fine', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'life', 'are', 'often', 'damaged', 'severely.The', 'Grimley', 'colliery', 'colliery', 'coal', 'mine', 'attendant', 'structures', 'been', 'operation', 'long', 'time', 'One', 'traditions', 'many', 'large', 'working', 'class', 'operations', 'brass', 'band', 'players', 'are', 'drawn', 'workers', 'United', 'States', 'community', 'brass', 'bands', 'were', 'quite', 'common', 'WWII', 'Grimley', 'band', 'real', 'life', 'Grimethorpe', 'Colliery', 'band', 'music', 'film', 'long', 'proud', 'tradition', 'movie', 'led', 'Danny', 'played', 'fabulous', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'even', 'fans', 'groupies', 'who', 'dye', 'hair', 'same', 'shade', 'purple', 'band', 'uniforms.The', 'music', 'film', 'wonderful', 'device', 'only', 'partly', 'band', 'music', 'so', 'good', 'Art', 'always', 'extravagance', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'sacrifice', 'time', 'money', 'always', 'question', 'balance', 'say', 'parents', 'worked', 'hard', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'However', 'Dad', 'sang', 'beautifully', 'love', 'friends', 'had', 'music', 'rubbed', 'off', 'Heaven', 'price', 'own', 'wife', 'children', 'have', 'paid', 'devotion', 'art.Danny', 'son', 'Phil', 'poignantly', 'done', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'trombone', 'bit', 'bumbler', 'income', 'family', 'being', 'rather', 'inept', 'clown', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'awful', 'side', 'story', 'film', 'Phil', 'need', 'new', 'trombone', 'struggle', 'balance', 'needs', 'family', 'yet', 'what', 'price', 'art', 'wife', 'cost', 'devotion', 'wrenching', 'ways', 'Phil', 'point', 'weight', 'film', 'crushing', 'effect.A', 'young', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Andy', 'Andy', 'points', 'whole', 'heart', 'problem', 'Andy', 'very', 'bright', 'young', 'man', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'However', 'always', 'felt', 'loser', 'one', 'When', 'see', 'passivity', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'soon', 'be', 'redundant', 'miners', 'frankly', 'get', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'power', 'earth', 'can', 'stop', 'economic', 'dislocations', 'happening', 'Oh', 'can', 'be', 'delayed', 'greater', 'cataclysm', 'will', 'follow', 'why', 'should', 'other', 'taxpayers', 'be', 'forever', 'burdened', 'providing', 'subsidized', 'living', 'inefficient', 'industry', 'Yes', 'Grimley', 'pit', 'was', 'making', 'money', 'so', 'report', 'showed.However', 'none', 'people', 'had', 'enough', 'financial', 'education', 'put', 'pit', 'broader', 'context', 'see', 'made', 'sense', 'operate', 'one', 'pit', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'preparing', 'people', 'make', 'changes', 'lives', 'have', 'equip', 'better', 'understanding', 'economics', 'finance', 'course', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'expensive', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'expensive', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'more', 'value', 'Being', 'more', 'flexible', 'ability', 'provide', 'more', 'value', 'good', 'thing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'drama', 'movie', 'say', 'honest', 'touching', 'politics', 'are', 'quite', 'anti-Thatcherite', 'appropriate', 'characters', 'However', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'pushing', 'own', 'agenda', 'bit', 'voice', 'characters', 'tad', 'bothersome', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'more', 'responsible', 'economic', 'dislocations', 'gravity', 'would', 'be', 'fell', 'off', 'roof', 'guess', 'have', 'blame', 'someone', 'was', 'certainly', 'convenient.In', 'case', 'fine', 'movie', 'language', 'bit', 'rough', 'might', 'might', 'have', 'bit', 'trouble', 'working', 'class', 'accents', 'encourage', 'see']",Brassed Off VHS
433958,APTF9UDVDUPGU,6304707029,"David McEldery ""TV Junkie""","[2, 2]","I've seen this movie twice now on satellite, and haven't tired of it. There's a lot to like. After a heavy dose of Transporter 1 through 25, Fast and Furious, various Star Treks, Star Wars, and gritty spy killing spy flicks, this is a wonderful little dose of reality - gee, I actually can sit through a thoughtful film without car chases, heroes without superpowers, and no one dangling from a helicopter getting shot at by a chain gun. Sounds un-American. That being said, this is a nicely acted, sensibly filmed story with a happy ending sandwiched in an unhappy circumstance. The actors even look like real people, even the lovely Tara Fitzgerald (every town has at least one beauty, right?) It gives the viewer a sense that amidst chaos, something lovely can still be born. The music is great. It makes me wonder why American brass bands can't do what brass bands do best - give you some real toe tapping tunes. The local university has a pretty good band, but what do we hear at half-time? We Will, We Will Rock You. C'mon! Surprise us! Turn our heads! The Grimethorpe Colliery Band is one of the best. They first came to my notice in a Disney film about pit ponys. It was another bittersweet tale about coal mining in the north of Britain when pony's pulled the carts and never saw the light of day, doing their jobs and trudging the tracks back to their subterranean mangers for a bit of sweet hay from a world they'd never see or taste again. Grimethorpe did the track for that one too, and it made me stay to the end of the credits to see who played that great music. A big thumbs up to the Brits for still creating films that make us think and feel without gut-churning special effects, and reminding us that you don't need an electric guitar to make great music, and the world is populated with people like you and I, people who pack trombones and trumpets, not machineguns and grenades.",5,A Lot to Like,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1899,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'now', 'satellite', 'have', ""n't"", 'tired', 'lot', 'like', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Transporter', '1', '25', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'various', 'Star', 'Treks', 'Star', 'Wars', 'gritty', 'spy', 'killing', 'spy', 'flicks', 'wonderful', 'little', 'dose', 'reality', 'gee', 'actually', 'can', 'sit', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'car', 'chases', 'heroes', 'superpowers', 'one', 'dangling', 'helicopter', 'getting', 'shot', 'chain', 'gun', 'un-American', 'being', 'said', 'nicely', 'acted', 'sensibly', 'filmed', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'sandwiched', 'unhappy', 'circumstance', 'actors', 'even', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'even', 'lovely', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'town', 'least', 'one', 'beauty', 'right', 'viewer', 'sense', 'chaos', 'something', 'lovely', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'born', 'music', 'great', 'wonder', 'why', 'American', 'brass', 'bands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'brass', 'bands', 'do', 'best', 'give', 'real', 'toe', 'tapping', 'tunes', 'local', 'university', 'pretty', 'good', 'band', 'what', 'do', 'hear', 'half-time', 'Will', 'Will', 'Rock', ""C'mon"", 'Surprise', 'Turn', 'heads', 'Grimethorpe', 'Colliery', 'Band', 'one', 'best', 'first', 'came', 'notice', 'Disney', 'film', 'pit', 'ponys', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'tale', 'coal', 'mining', 'north', 'Britain', 'when', 'pony', 'pulled', 'carts', 'never', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'doing', 'jobs', 'trudging', 'tracks', 'back', 'subterranean', 'mangers', 'bit', 'sweet', 'hay', 'world', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'taste', 'again', 'Grimethorpe', 'did', 'track', 'one', 'too', 'made', 'stay', 'end', 'credits', 'see', 'who', 'played', 'great', 'music', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Brits', 'still', 'creating', 'films', 'make', 'think', 'feel', 'gut-churning', 'special', 'effects', 'reminding', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'electric', 'guitar', 'make', 'great', 'music', 'world', 'populated', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'pack', 'trombones', 'trumpets', 'not', 'machineguns', 'grenades']",Brassed Off VHS

Pete Postlethwaite shines as the bandleader (more evidence that  the film industry should spend more time on veterans than young stars) and  he's given strong support from the ever-excellent McGregor, Tompkinson and  Fitzgerald. But where as The Full Monty was a feel good tale of workers  overcoming the loss of their jobs, Brassed Off is far more downbeat and  gritty as the miners cling to what remains of their way of life. Director  Mark Herman tells his story convincing with the exception of Tompkinson's  attack on Margaret Thatcher. It has to be said that this was totally  inappropriate in a fictional story and unnecessary, since the film was  already providing an effective comment on the Conservative mining policy of  the 1980s, similar to the way that Ken Loach's Kes commented the state  education of the 1960s.

But the video's cover is just another sign  that the studio just didn't know what to make of this movie or how to  promote it. Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan MacGregor on the cover make it look  like a love story, which is certainly an element of the plot, but one of  many, and certainly not the most important. A British mining town is  threatened with closure of the mines, which will put much of the population  out of work. Unconcerned with this all is Danny (a brilliant Pete  Postlethwaite), the leader of the mine's brass band group, so intent on  winning the national championships that he doesn't see at first the turmoil  as the members of his band face unemployment--including his own son.  There's a triumph at the end, but a bittersweet one, when, at the end,  Danny declares that music doesn't matter...it's people that matter (a sound  bite you probably already recognize--it was sampled at the beginning of  Chumbawamba's hit &quot;Tubthumping&quot;). The most logical comparable to  this film (and one nearly everyone makes) is &quot;The Full Monty,&quot;  but this movie came first, and doesn't sacrifice the realities of the  British unemployment problem at the expense of laughs. And if you think you  don't enjoy brass band music, &quot;Brassed Off&quot; will go a long way  towards changing your mind--this is *not* oompah-pah-pah music of your  high-school marching band. Music dramatically underscores the lives of the  characters and the tone of the movie. As proof, this movie features one of  the most absolutely gorgeous wordless sequences in contemporary British  film: while the brass band plays an exquisite version of &quot;En Aranjuez  Con Tu Amor,&quot; the scene cuts back and forth from their practice to the  breakdown of negotiation talks between the miners and management--a sublime  moment that comes early in the film but sets the scene for many other such  moments.

433969,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,6304707029,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[5, 5]","Released at roughly the same time as ""The Full Monty,"" this gem got a lot less attention here in the states, and remains a little-known treasure for those who love British film.  True, no middle-aged men get naked on screen, but there are a lot more subtle interpersonal dynamics among the members of the ensemble cast.  And the romantic narrative between Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald is perhaps a little pat, but is certainly one of the most realistic and nuanced love stories in recent cinema.The closure of a Yorkshire coal pit threatens to throw a thousand blue-collar men out of work on a community that is ill-equipped to handle them and has no other work waiting.  Families, marriages, and friendships are imperilled when the reality of economic hardship and collapse looms over them.  And through it all the band plays on.This movie is billed as a romantic comedy, and McGregor and Fitzgerald get their mugs slapped on the DVD case.  But that's just because love stories and pretty faces sell.  The story really belongs to Pete Postlethwaite as Danny Ormondroyd.  Danny is inarguably one of the most conflicted characters you're likely to see in a recent movie.  Hollywood likes strict good guy/bad guy divides, but British film trusts you enough to muddy the waters and let you come to your own conclusions.Danny has given his life to two loves: the coal pit where he works, and the brass band he conducts.  The closure of one threatens the future of the other, but he desperately wants to hold the band together long enough to compete at the Royal Albert Hall.  It doesn't quite dawn on him that his zeal for the band, ignoring the threatened pit closure, is alienating him from his community, costing his players their friendships, jeapordizing his son's marriage, and threatening to destroy the very band he loves.Though the production of this film is motivated by naked political slant, there is enough character drama to catch and hold even those who disagree with the film's opinion.  And the music is really, really good.  There are enough layers to reward repeat viewing, and a sufficiently varied ensemble to attract a broad audience.  Though not for small kids, this is a film most of the family can watch and come away from well-rewarded.  And okay, the love story is sweet, so show it to your date.

433970,A2VG8F8TL6AYDR,6304707029,"""lexo-2""","[28, 28]","This excellent movie suffered from some dodgy marketing.  Ewan MacGregor was splashed all over the publicity as a result of his role in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, and while he plays a central role in it very well indeed, he's only one of a superb ensemble of actors.The Yorkshire miners' strike of the mid-80s was, so far, the last great stand of the British working-class against the encroaching forces of capital and &quot;economic efficiency&quot;.  The mines were the source of not just wealth, but the dignity of entire communities.  Coal mining is a back-breaking, filthy, dangerous and ultimately murderous job, and it was the danger and the sweat that gave the communities their pride.  One of the things that this pride fostered was the incredible virtuosity of the brass bands.  I was never a great fan of brass band music until I saw this movie, but the music in it (played by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, one of the most distinguished bands in the country) is not dull marching music but fantastically intricate and moving stuff.  These guys weren't academy-trained musicians, they were mine workers who learned it in their spare time.And yet, one of the central points of the film is that we can all sit back and enjoy the music but little was done by anyone but the miners themselves to stop the destruction and demoralisation of the communities that produced it.  That's what gives the film its tragic force, despite the resilience and good humour displayed along the way.  (This is also a funny film, if a very sad one.)Much of the weight of the tragedy falls on two characters - Danny, the bandmaster, and his son Phil, a trombone player in the band.  Danny is played by Pete Postlethwaite, a stunning actor who seems to able to incarnate an unbelievable range of figures (he was also the sinister Kobayashi in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and the dying father in &quot;In The Name of the Father&quot;).  Postlethwaite's character has been a miner all his life, and his frailty is terribly evident, yet he convinces us with his realisation that the music that he has always loved is, in the end, only the swansong of a whole way of life.Phil is played by Stephen Tompkinson, who had previously been visible as a good light comedy actor.  Here, his red-eyed, desperate performance is a revelation.  Phil moonlights as a children's entertainer, and the sight of him in clown costume being beaten up by the bailiffs emptying his home is fiercely ironic.This is a great movie; the point of it is even greater.  The pits were closed down, not because they weren't profitable (most of them were), but because they represented a threat to the new economic order.  The final irony is that, with the closure of so many pits and the drop in fossil fuel consumption, the UK is going to have to build lots of nuclear power stations over the next twenty years if they want to maintain the national electricity grid at its current level.Having seen the country of my birth (Britain) being systematically despoiled and demoralised over the course of most of my life by a long Conservative administration, I can only cheer a movie like this, which counts the cost of it all.",5,What matters more: music or people?,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,3179,"['excellent', 'movie', 'suffered', 'dodgy', 'marketing', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'was', 'splashed', 'publicity', 'result', 'role', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'central', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'only', 'one', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'actors.The', 'Yorkshire', 'miners', 'strike', 'mid-80s', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'last', 'great', 'stand', 'British', 'working-class', 'encroaching', 'forces', 'capital', 'quot', 'economic', 'efficiency', 'quot', 'mines', 'were', 'source', 'not', 'just', 'wealth', 'dignity', 'entire', 'communities', 'Coal', 'mining', 'back-breaking', 'filthy', 'dangerous', 'ultimately', 'murderous', 'job', 'was', 'danger', 'sweat', 'gave', 'communities', 'pride', 'One', 'things', 'pride', 'fostered', 'was', 'incredible', 'virtuosity', 'brass', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'fan', 'brass', 'band', 'music', 'saw', 'movie', 'music', 'played', 'Grimethorpe', 'Colliery', 'Band', 'one', 'most', 'distinguished', 'bands', 'country', 'not', 'dull', 'marching', 'music', 'fantastically', 'intricate', 'moving', 'stuff', 'guys', 'were', ""n't"", 'academy-trained', 'musicians', 'were', 'mine', 'workers', 'who', 'learned', 'spare', 'time.And', 'yet', 'one', 'central', 'points', 'film', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'music', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'anyone', 'miners', 'stop', 'destruction', 'demoralisation', 'communities', 'produced', 'film', 'tragic', 'force', 'resilience', 'good', 'humour', 'displayed', 'way', 'also', 'funny', 'film', 'very', 'sad', 'one', 'Much', 'weight', 'tragedy', 'two', 'characters', 'Danny', 'bandmaster', 'son', 'Phil', 'trombone', 'player', 'band', 'Danny', 'played', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'stunning', 'actor', 'who', 'able', 'incarnate', 'unbelievable', 'range', 'figures', 'was', 'also', 'sinister', 'Kobayashi', 'quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'dying', 'father', 'quot', 'Name', 'Father', 'quot', 'Postlethwaite', 'character', 'been', 'miner', 'life', 'frailty', 'terribly', 'evident', 'yet', 'realisation', 'music', 'always', 'loved', 'end', 'only', 'swansong', 'whole', 'way', 'life.Phil', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'visible', 'good', 'light', 'comedy', 'actor', 'Here', 'red-eyed', 'desperate', 'performance', 'revelation', 'Phil', 'moonlights', 'children', 'entertainer', 'sight', 'clown', 'costume', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'bailiffs', 'emptying', 'home', 'fiercely', 'ironic.This', 'great', 'movie', 'point', 'even', 'greater', 'pits', 'were', 'closed', 'down', 'not', 'were', ""n't"", 'profitable', 'most', 'were', 'represented', 'threat', 'new', 'economic', 'order', 'final', 'irony', 'closure', 'so', 'many', 'pits', 'drop', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'consumption', 'UK', 'going', 'have', 'build', 'lots', 'nuclear', 'power', 'stations', 'next', 'twenty', 'years', 'want', 'maintain', 'national', 'electricity', 'grid', 'current', 'level.Having', 'seen', 'country', 'birth', 'Britain', 'being', 'systematically', 'despoiled', 'demoralised', 'course', 'most', 'life', 'long', 'Conservative', 'administration', 'can', 'only', 'cheer', 'movie', 'cost']",Brassed Off VHS

When I saw it was going to be on IFC I decided to give it a go, and I did, not once, but TWICE! :DI loved it. It is just as good the second viewing, and the music is mesmerizing. Its amazing. Emotional and beautiful.  The  movie is not in the least bit a cheesy romantic comedy, its not a romantic comedy at all.  One of the story-lines running through contains some romance, but it is not the overarching theme.  It primarily has to do with how these people deal with the closing of a coal mine (which is the town basically) and how it effects their everyday lives. How they keep playing with their brass band(though they keep wanting to or do give up). It is the one thing that seems to keep them somewhat sane in a time of personal and emotional turmoil.  The ones most effected that are in the Brass band, is the bands leader Danny and his son Phil. Both do absolutely fabolous. Bringing humour to this tragedy.A touching and humorous film about living life to the fullest even when times are rough.God Bless ~Amy",5,Very deceptiv cover.........,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,1510,"['cover', 'look', 'light-weight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'more', 'how', 'town', 'effected', 'when', 'large', 'employer', 'shut', 'down', 'how', 'tragedy', 'people', 'must', 'move', 'find', 'joy', 'life.When', 'first', 'came', 'Public', 'Library', 'love', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'dismissed', 'disposable', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'read', 'back', 'description', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'due', 'cover', 'silly', 'yes', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'IFC', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'did', 'not', 'once', 'TWICE', 'DI', 'loved', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'viewing', 'music', 'mesmerizing', 'amazing', 'Emotional', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'One', 'story-lines', 'running', 'contains', 'romance', 'not', 'overarching', 'theme', 'primarily', 'do', 'how', 'people', 'deal', 'closing', 'coal', 'mine', 'town', 'basically', 'how', 'effects', 'everyday', 'lives', 'How', 'keep', 'playing', 'brass', 'band', 'keep', 'wanting', 'do', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'thing', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'time', 'personal', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'ones', 'most', 'effected', 'are', 'Brass', 'band', 'bands', 'leader', 'Danny', 'son', 'Phil', 'do', 'absolutely', 'fabolous', 'Bringing', 'humour', 'tragedy.A', 'touching', 'humorous', 'film', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'even', 'when', 'times', 'are', 'rough.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",Brassed Off VHS

We devote our meager free time to the pursuit of musical excellence, many of us in amateur brass bands, string orchestras, community choirs and the like -- for what purpose?Because we MUST.  No  matter how dismal or depressed the rest of our lives are, there's always an  opportunity to create something beautiful, something truly magnificent, by  combining our talents with those of others.The Grimley Colliery Band is  but one example of this.  Each member, all men but one newcomer, is facing  a crisis -- the closing of the coal mine into which they've poured their  sweat and energy for most of their lives, and the uncertain future to  follow.  Their director, Danny, demanding and hard-headed, has retired from  the mine, and doesn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the matter.  &quot;Music is EVERYTHING!&quot; he proclaims.  The members consider him  daft, as they struggle to balance family, the impending union/management  show-down, and finances.  It's only at a moment of crisis that they realize  the point:  Danny not only understands the situation, but he also knows  that MUSIC is the only thing that will get these proud men through the  storm together, whole and with some shred of self-respect.Pete  Postlethwaite is brilliant as Danny; Tara Fitzgerald's understated  performance as Gloria, the only female member of the band, gives her  character a sense of integrity and honor that could easily have been  overlooked in favor of more &quot;marketable&quot; characteristics.  The  rest of the cast is remarkable.  Particularly notable is Stephen Tompkinson  as Phil, Danny's son, whose descent into abject depression seems to mirror  the daily descent into the black hole of the coal mine -- dark, dirty, and  dangerous.I liked this movie far better than I thought I would when I  saw the cover of the DVD.  This is less a romance than an examination of  many lives made complete -- by music, by the pursuit of beauty and grace,  by focused cooperation.

433973,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6304707029,MadMacs,"[4, 5]","A poignant moving film that is both a showcase of laughter and anguish; a revelation of bitter ignominious defeats and glorious successes - all while facing Death that comes in all forms.Tells the story of the twenty-some-odd members of a Collier Brass Band and their small village. It's a word I was unfamiliar with until this movie, an English term for what we call coal miners. A novel concept to this American - coal miners whose extracurricular activities involve a band that isn't based on guitar, fiddle, or jug.Eighty unbroken years, including two world wars and the Great Depression, destined to go the way of the dinosaur. Why? Their coal mine is scheduled for ""redundancy"" - aka closure. But only, and this is important, only if the community itself votes in favor of ceasing operations and effectively killing the township. And despite the loud brash talk in public quarters and the hammer fists at the union hall, it's clear that the majority of the town's residents are tired of fighting. After a solid decade of defiant strife, they want the money; enough funds to pay off long-standing family debts, move away and start over someplace else.Everyone except the traditionalists of the Collier Band. Led by grand character actor Pete Postlethwaite portraying the band's conductor, this small segment of miners represents some of the last holdouts - the pitiful few stalwarts holding back the tide of populist opinion.If one could mentally transport oneself to those very volatile times, this actually plays less as a romantic-comedy (where it succeeds wonderfully) and more as political statement. Mine closures across the UK were a hot topic when this film was produced in 1996, fully ten years after the government stopped subsidizing the coal industry. The lives of most these hardworking men shuttered, their families scattered to the winds.Unsurprisingly, their story hasn't lessened by the passage of time; this film still carries with it the proud legacy of these people and the fight for their heritage.And although Ewan MacGregor is the headlining artist, and no complaints about his usual excellence, it's actually Stephen Tompkinson, as the conductor's son Phil, who really hit home the message. A terrifically acted and painful performance as he exposes the terrible costs of trying to obey two masters - the one in his pounding heart and the one in his head screaming common sense. The sheer suffering he puts out there for everyone to see is palpable and delivered with such emotional energy that it honestly hurts to watch. His on-screen execution a sincere kick in the gut. Genuinely powerful stuff.A bleeping crime and damnable shame that Tompkinson's portrayal didn't even merit a BAFTA looksee at the time.Scripted with a deep sense of conviction, a screenplay worthy of being told, filmed with acute technical skill, and filled with performances that reflect the very best of the craft. No question a five-star production.Personal Note:- A difficult film to review given my perspective on unions. In my defense, and to be bluntly fair, the modern union is about as close to it's original form as a Britney Spears cover song is to an original done by The Beatles.By freakish happenstance, I also happened to rescreen this film as I was beginning Ken Follet's 'Century' Trilogy. (also having read his similarly based 'A Place Called Freedom') So I really do understand the original impetus for the formation of trade unions. But one would have to be insane or delusional comparing their modern gluttonous and slovenly incarnations to their horribly mistreated and noble progenitors.",5,Collier Pride And Honor,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,3613,"['poignant', 'moving', 'film', 'showcase', 'laughter', 'anguish', 'revelation', 'bitter', 'ignominious', 'defeats', 'glorious', 'successes', 'facing', 'Death', 'forms.Tells', 'story', 'twenty-some-odd', 'members', 'Collier', 'Brass', 'Band', 'small', 'village', 'word', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'movie', 'English', 'term', 'what', 'call', 'coal', 'miners', 'novel', 'concept', 'American', 'coal', 'miners', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'involve', 'band', ""n't"", 'based', 'guitar', 'fiddle', 'jug.Eighty', 'unbroken', 'years', 'including', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'Great', 'Depression', 'destined', 'go', 'way', 'dinosaur', 'Why', 'coal', 'mine', 'scheduled', 'redundancy', 'aka', 'closure', 'only', 'important', 'only', 'community', 'favor', 'ceasing', 'operations', 'effectively', 'killing', 'township', 'loud', 'brash', 'talk', 'public', 'quarters', 'hammer', 'fists', 'union', 'hall', 'clear', 'majority', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'tired', 'fighting', 'solid', 'decade', 'defiant', 'strife', 'want', 'money', 'enough', 'funds', 'pay', 'off', 'long-standing', 'family', 'debts', 'move', 'away', 'start', 'someplace', 'else.Everyone', 'traditionalists', 'Collier', 'Band', 'Led', 'grand', 'character', 'actor', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'portraying', 'band', 'conductor', 'small', 'segment', 'miners', 'last', 'holdouts', 'pitiful', 'few', 'stalwarts', 'holding', 'back', 'tide', 'populist', 'one', 'could', 'mentally', 'transport', 'very', 'volatile', 'times', 'actually', 'less', 'romantic-comedy', 'where', 'wonderfully', 'more', 'political', 'statement', 'Mine', 'UK', 'were', 'hot', 'topic', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'produced', '1996', 'fully', 'ten', 'years', 'government', 'stopped', 'subsidizing', 'coal', 'industry', 'lives', 'most', 'hardworking', 'men', 'shuttered', 'families', 'scattered', 'winds.Unsurprisingly', 'story', ""n't"", 'lessened', 'passage', 'time', 'film', 'still', 'proud', 'legacy', 'people', 'fight', 'heritage.And', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'headlining', 'artist', 'complaints', 'usual', 'excellence', 'actually', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'conductor', 'son', 'Phil', 'who', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'message', 'terrifically', 'acted', 'painful', 'performance', 'terrible', 'costs', 'trying', 'obey', 'two', 'masters', 'one', 'pounding', 'heart', 'one', 'head', 'screaming', 'common', 'sense', 'sheer', 'suffering', 'out', 'there', 'everyone', 'see', 'palpable', 'delivered', 'such', 'emotional', 'energy', 'honestly', 'watch', 'on-screen', 'execution', 'sincere', 'kick', 'gut', 'Genuinely', 'powerful', 'stuff.A', 'bleeping', 'crime', 'damnable', 'shame', 'Tompkinson', 'portrayal', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'merit', 'BAFTA', 'looksee', 'time.Scripted', 'deep', 'sense', 'conviction', 'screenplay', 'worthy', 'being', 'told', 'filmed', 'acute', 'technical', 'skill', 'filled', 'performances', 'reflect', 'very', 'best', 'craft', 'question', 'five-star', 'production.Personal', 'Note', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'given', 'perspective', 'unions', 'defense', 'be', 'bluntly', 'fair', 'modern', 'union', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'original', 'form', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'cover', 'song', 'original', 'done', 'Beatles.By', 'freakish', 'happenstance', 'also', 'happened', 'rescreen', 'film', 'was', 'beginning', 'Ken', 'Follet', ""'Century"", 'Trilogy', 'also', 'having', 'read', 'similarly', 'based', 'Place', 'Called', 'Freedom', 'really', 'do', 'understand', 'original', 'impetus', 'formation', 'trade', 'unions', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'insane', 'delusional', 'comparing', 'modern', 'gluttonous', 'slovenly', 'incarnations', 'horribly', 'mistreated', 'noble', 'progenitors']",Brassed Off VHS

433976,A129YBX5BVNW2,6304707029,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[5, 5]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE ***Set in the fictional mining town of Grimley in North Yorkshire ten years after the calamitous British miner's strike of '84 to '85 - ""Brassed Off"" is about a colliery band with a 100-year history facing dissolution should their coal pit be closed by a determined powers-that-be (the Tory party bent on destroying the Trade Unions and their strangelhold on business). It's a small British movie about big British things and when it was released into cinemas in 1996 - it delivered its laughter and tears with a passion that disarmed many at the time.In fact - re-watching it now on this superlatively clean and crisply rendered 2012 transfer to BLU RAY (the absolute best its ever looked) - I'm once again struck by its huge heart and the great performances from a committed cast - and that mass job losses devastating a community is still painfully relevant to this day.Written and Directed by MARK HERMAN (who went on to do the equally good ""Little Voice"", ""Purely Belter"" and ""The Boy In Stripped Pyjamas"") - this is a working-class world where housewives have a filter-cigarette and a cup of tea on the garden wall while their frayed padded-bras flutter on the clothesline in the morning breeze. People shop in downmarket chains like Spar and Kwik Save and say ""daft"" and ""bugger"" all the time. Life is a struggle and money always a problem - and if the pit closes then there will literally be 'no future' for hundreds of men and women with families to support...A lot of the movie's seething underbelly of anger and frustration is offset by self-deprecating jokes... When Danny the ailing conductor of the brass band (Pete Postlethwaite) gives his sappy son Phil a piggyback on his bicycle to band practice (a truly fantastic Stephen Tompkinson) - demented by four kids, a crippling mortgage and loan sharks - his had-enough wife Sandra (Melanie Hill) chucks plates at him as he leaves. Danny casually remarks as they cycle away - ""...bit clumsy with the crockery your Sandra..."". When local girl Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) returns as a business sophisticate to do a feasibility study on the viability of the pit - she is fondly remembered by the pool-playing Andy (Ewan McGregor) for giving ""top half only"" when she was a teenager. Their rekindled romance is lovely and believably real.But sadness and frustration are never far away from the surface either. A husband and wife cross each other on the footpath in the morning as their shifts intertwine - too tired, too rushed and too beaten to speak (Jim Carter - now the Butler Mister Carson in ""Downton Abbey""). When they do talk the 3rd time it happens she remarks - ""You used to be full of fight..."" He drops his head - it's true. Wives and mothers huddle around kettle-drum fires for warmth and sit in makeshift tents outside the colliery gates where their constant chant goes up as the scabs pass the picket line - ""The miners united - will never be defeated"". When of course they were...Debt Collectors punch out a desperate father in front of his wife and kids - and a few days later coldly remove all their worldly goods from their home. A friend manning the cash register in a local supermarket slips a 10 note behind the receipt to a mortified mum who can't afford 60p Orange Squash for her kids. At least a form of redemption is offered to them by way of their entry into the National Finals held in London - which they proudly attend and win with a rousing performance of ""Charge Of The Light Brigade"". And it all ends with Pete Postlethwaite's rousing speech to the assembled - tearful stuff full of pathos and heartbreak.PICTURE QUALITY/EXTRAS:It opens with miners down a pit finishing their shift in the dimly lit caves - so there is some grain - but once they emerge into the yards from the lifts and from thereon in - this May 2012 Channel 4/Miramax release looks 'so' good it's positively disarming. Its default aspect is 1.85:1 - so it fills the full screen naturally (no bars top or bottom).The extras are disappointing though. The interviews with the principal four are short and enthusiastic - but hardly great and the 'Sub Plot Extra' merely cobbles together scenes you've seen already - pretty pointless and irritating. The Biographies and Photo Galleries offer some info and images - but it's all terribly underwhelming and no real improvement on what went before. Still - there is that picture quality...I honestly hadn't expected to be so 'moved' by ""Brassed Off"" this time around - yet the script got to me on several occasions. Pete Postlethwaite's character lying in a hospital bed with blood in his lungs and sadness in his heart - when the boys gather outside in the dark and begin playing ""Danny Boy"" in a Brass Band style. I'll tell you - it's a hard man indeed who doesn't shed a tear.To sum up - at last ""Brassed Off"" is given the transfer it thoroughly deserves - and if you've any affection at all for this ballsy little film - then you need to own it on BLU RAY. And what a great way to remember Pete Postlethwaite - exuding that everyman humanity that engendered him to a whole nation.Nowt wrong with that ye daft buggers!BLU RAY Specifications:ASPECT: 1.85:1 ratioSUBTITLES: NoneEXTRAS:1.

433977,A270RZKNJS04C1,6304707029,"Mary Kean ""Valkyrie911""","[4, 9]","I'm reviewing the vhs version here because I think more people will see it and I'm not going into any ""extra's"" anyhow.So lets get to the movie. I titled my review as such because when I did a ""Big Fish"" review, someone else called that film the ""Terms of Endearment for men"". Which I didn't get. (If you read my review on that movie (please do and if it is helpful rate me please!) It was more about the adventures of one man, Edward Bloom, than about the relationship dynamic between a father/son. Maybe the lack of a relationship, throw some ""Postcards From the Edge"" in there and really confuse people-but I don't know. That comparison was making a purse out of a pigs ear if you ask me. And if you're reading this, you're asking me, -sorta.I should note that you have to read my ""about me"" section if I tend to wander. It'll mangle your mind.(Reference to another film-Velvet Goldmine, 5 Stars also)So back to ""Brassed Off"" and time to stop being brassed off about the ""Big Fish"" review.It's an older movie but since it's set in one of thoseIreland/Scotland/Wales/North Britain villages that never age it's timeless. It could be happening yesterday for all we know except for a brief reference to Margaret Thatcher as the current Prime Minister at the beginning.  The story is typical and well known. It's been done with great success inmany films, the most popular probably being ""The Full Monty"" which also went on (inexplicably) to be a broadway musical.The ""MANAGEMENT"" (ooh they MUST be evil) are deciding whether the coal mine that supports the town is viable or not. Lines are drawn, we are supposed to root for the litle guys who of course aren't the scabs and all of them just happen to play in the only other viable operation the town has going for it, a brass band.That is after they climb out of the mine shaft covered in soot, swinging their lunch-buckets at the end of the day, and are suitably cleaned up. You can picture it already can't you? Hard working lads who enjoy a pint now and then.Immediately we are introduced to the the character of ""Glorious [...] Gloria""(Tara Fitzgerald) who left the town sometime ago. How happy under the circumstances that not only does she play the fluglehorn brilliantly, she also works for MANAGEMENT; and has a shared past first sexual experience with Andy (Ewan McGregor), a trumpetor himself. She just doesn't feel the need to disclose that bit of information to anyone, not even poor Andy.This fits neatly into what is essentially a sideline to the story.The heart of it is Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), the bands conductor, and Phil(Stephen Tompkinson), his son who got into a lot of financial trouble during the last strike at the mine years ago and is losing everything, including his family and eventually part of his mind now that MANAGEMENT is back in town. It is this story that holds ""Brassed Off"" together, notthe Ewan/Tara subplot that the box cover wants to sell copies from because of Ewan McGregor's fame.I am a giant Ewan McGregor fan, just look at my profile and lists and you'll see that, but this movie is soooo not about him. He is a bit player. If that is what you are shopping for then ok, it's a good part, small but good.Other than that it is the story of how a town can drag itself out of the ashes, how a father and son can have a relationship together that isn't manly or sappy but real. It is a story of how sometimes when you have very little to hold on to it's better to hold tighter when giving up would be the easiest thing to do. Spoiler alert if you read the next paragraph!The ensemble casting was perfect. These were real people. This was a real place.  It has a happy ending -I'll spoil that for you but isn't that what you want? A happy ending?This is a film that depicts people who have reached the very lowest they can go and the very highest they can acheive, and yet there is still room for more hope and happiness at an unfinished ending. I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the Full Monty. I recommend this and add that you wil enjoy it more. I also recommend the soundtrack.

433980,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,6304707029,"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike""","[23, 23]","The heritage of the English coal mines (collieries as they are called) has been a mixed one of industrial production, labor strife and music.  Music?  Indeed, the existence and competition of employee brass bands formed as a diversionary activity for the miners is overlooked by most people born outside of the English coal mining commmunities. What began as a mild diversion has since provided a rich legacy of music that should not be ignored. But musical legacy notwithstanding, there are other factors at play in this wonderful little movie like the Tory policies of Margaret Thatcher's U.K. and the forced closure of many mines over recent years.The idyllic (although certainly not prosperous) existence of one such group of miners is attacked on two fronts; first by threats to close down the colliery, but the addition of a woman (Tara Fitzgerald) to the all male ensemble is even more unsettling.  Her talent as a flugelhornist is as bothersome to the members of the band, as her beauty is to one bandmate in particular (Ewen MacGregor). Ms. Fitzgerald has to be the best kept secret in the British cinema as she combines fantastic ability with an almost sublime beauty.  I'd rent a ""How to Fix a Flat Tire"" movie if it featured Tara's face and lyrical voice.Besides the lovely Ms. Fitzgerald, two other actors stand out. Ewen MacGregor shows more range in this role than both of his Star Wars appearances thus far (he also has a much better script to work with).  And Pete Postlethwaite would have received an Academy Award nomination had more people simply seen this movie. Postlethwaite is something of a British William H. Macy; he's always rock solid in his character and talented enough to give uniqueness to each character he plays.Faced with the extinction of their jobs and way of life, the members of the Grimley Colliery Band rally around their leader (Postlethwaite) as they battle economics, black lung and an evolving world.  Their quest is to win the nationwide band competition at Prince Albert Hall.  Despite a misstep or two along the way, usually aided by an extra pint at the pub, they work their way into the finals.  Beyond that, you'll have to watch the movie.But no discussion about Brassed Off would be complete without mentioning the music.  You could find sufficient enjoyment from the music alone.  The soundtrack, performed by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band will appeal to almost everyone.  It's become one of my family's favorite CD's as well.",5,An absolute gem of a movie!,1055116800,"06 9, 2003",2003,2480,"['heritage', 'English', 'coal', 'mines', 'collieries', 'are', 'called', 'been', 'mixed', 'one', 'industrial', 'production', 'labor', 'strife', 'music', 'Music', 'Indeed', 'existence', 'competition', 'employee', 'brass', 'formed', 'diversionary', 'activity', 'miners', 'overlooked', 'most', 'people', 'born', 'English', 'coal', 'mining', 'commmunities', 'What', 'began', 'mild', 'diversion', 'provided', 'rich', 'legacy', 'music', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'musical', 'legacy', 'notwithstanding', 'are', 'other', 'factors', 'play', 'wonderful', 'little', 'movie', 'Tory', 'policies', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'U.K.', 'forced', 'closure', 'many', 'mines', 'recent', 'years.The', 'idyllic', 'certainly', 'not', 'prosperous', 'existence', 'one', 'such', 'group', 'miners', 'attacked', 'two', 'fronts', 'first', 'threats', 'close', 'down', 'colliery', 'addition', 'woman', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'male', 'ensemble', 'even', 'more', 'unsettling', 'talent', 'flugelhornist', 'as', 'bothersome', 'members', 'band', 'beauty', 'one', 'bandmate', 'particular', 'Ewen', 'MacGregor', 'Ms.', 'Fitzgerald', 'be', 'best', 'kept', 'secret', 'British', 'cinema', 'fantastic', 'ability', 'almost', 'sublime', 'beauty', ""'d"", 'rent', 'How', 'Fix', 'Flat', 'Tire', 'movie', 'featured', 'Tara', 'face', 'lyrical', 'voice.Besides', 'lovely', 'Ms.', 'Fitzgerald', 'two', 'other', 'actors', 'stand', 'out', 'Ewen', 'MacGregor', 'more', 'range', 'role', 'Star', 'Wars', 'thus', 'far', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'work', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'had', 'more', 'people', 'simply', 'seen', 'movie', 'Postlethwaite', 'something', 'British', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'always', 'rock', 'solid', 'character', 'talented', 'enough', 'give', 'uniqueness', 'character', 'plays.Faced', 'extinction', 'jobs', 'way', 'life', 'members', 'Grimley', 'Colliery', 'Band', 'rally', 'leader', 'Postlethwaite', 'battle', 'economics', 'black', 'lung', 'evolving', 'world', 'quest', 'win', 'nationwide', 'band', 'competition', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'misstep', 'two', 'way', 'usually', 'aided', 'extra', 'pint', 'pub', 'work', 'way', 'finals', 'Beyond', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie.But', 'discussion', 'Brassed', 'Off', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'music', 'could', 'find', 'sufficient', 'enjoyment', 'music', 'alone', 'soundtrack', 'performed', 'Grimethorpe', 'Colliery', 'Band', 'will', 'appeal', 'almost', 'everyone', 'become', 'one', 'family', 'favorite', 'CD', 'as', 'well']",Brassed Off VHS

433982,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,6304707029,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[5, 6]","This is one of those movies that they felt had to be dressed up a bit in order for the dumb movie audience to give it a chance.  Or so this is how they film studios see it anyway.  This is certainly a message movie, and its not so sutble message about anti-Thatcherism hits you on the head like a brick! Americans ignorant about Britain today might have a hard time following it.  However, if one disregards the rather dated politics here, the theme of the movie can be seen as a universal one in that long-time workers are now frequently the victims of changing economics.More than anything else this is a movie about music and brass bands. The opening march by R. B. Hall ""Death or Glory"" says it all!  For the players in this band their fight for the mine is a death or glory proposition. Incidently Hall was a little known New England composer of marches, and its interesting that his music should make it back acorss the pond for English brass bands.  My personal tastes runs for Military bands in which the instrumentation is richer and more varied.  Brass bands don't have any woodwinds!  The softer tone they produce is a more mellow sound, compared to the richer, stirring military band.Its nice to see that the working class of the mines in England produced these high quality bands.  No comparison can be fond here in the States with mine workers.  You would sooner find most US blue collar workers in topless bars after their shift rather than going to band practice!  So these bands are a part of England's cultural scene, and the popular band music they played was often a bridge for the common man between the classical concert hall and the out-door band concert.  Their loss would certainly be sad.  The band portrayed here in the film is an actual famous brass band, and it would be interesting to know if it was really disbanded because of the Yorkshire mine closings.The actors do a fine job.  Pete Postlewaite is wonderful.  Anything he does seems to be golden.  Tara Fitsgerald is very appealing and seductive. Shes's also wonderful to see in almost anything. The plot has its usual twists and turns that keeps the interest.  The human dramas behind the music is what is most compelling about this film.A movie should be made about the many fine regimental bands that have been disbanded in the British army in recent years.  Like the civilian band portrayed here, many of these bands had histories that went back for centuries, and their loss to the regiments which had them was keen.  The many fine musicians in them were also forced into redundancy or had to seek non-musical employment in the army.  Certainly what Blair has done here is every bit as bad as what Thatcher did to the mines.  The destruction of these many fine military bands was a loss to communities as well as to the morale of their regiments.  The loss of any band is a cultural loss, whether civilian or military.  With young listeners today increasingly having no exposure to music other than dreadful pop, the loss of such bands is truly a dire situation.  These musical entities with their free open air concerts were a vital link for people to hear different kinds of music.  I can't imagine what the music tastes of people will be in the future.

Why?The storyline and the acting are superb. The production is excellent and the camera-work first rate. Even the coarse - but truthfully and accurately portrayed - language, is acceptable to this reviewer, although it might not be to everyone.So, what was it that so nearly caused this movie to be classed as 'poor' entertainment? It was the strident, over powering, political haranguement the viewer was subjected to throughout the movie. Rarely does a political argument become relevant for long. Time changes all things - including political thought and actions. What was highly relevent in the 80's is, now, utterly irrelevant. This movie was set in the troublesome times of the 80's in Industrial England - in particular, a mining area.If the viewer can view the movie as a movie and enjoy the craftsmanship that went into it from all concerned, it is a most enjoyable experience.

In fact, it is anything but!Set in a coal-mining town in the North of England in the early 90s, this is an enlightening and moving British comedy-drama (with the emphasis on drama) centering around the men from the local colliery, whose lives have been turned upside down and forever changed by the decision to close the mine.  The men, their lives, and their relationships with one another are revealed through an interest they have in common--the colliery's brass band.  Now that the mine is closing, the band is likely to be the next casualty.  For one thing, money's tight and the men cannot afford the dues.  But there is one man, Danny (played magnificently by Pete Postlethwaite--Sharpe's Odediah), for whom the band is more than just a casual interest--it's his life, his raison d'etre.  He simply cannot imagine an existence without the band.This is truly a first-rate film, and as with most British productions, there is not one performance that is anything less than perfect.  The film features Tara Fitzgerald (The Woman in White), a newcomer who joins the band, but unbeknownst to the men is working for management at the mine.  Though the entire cast is wonderful, it is really Postlethwaite, who gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Danny, the band's leader and conductor, that really makes this film sparkle.  And I simply must mention Stephen Tompkinson (Ballykissangel's Father Clifford), who gives an outstanding performance as Phil, Danny's son.The other thing worth mentioning about this film is the music.  The words ""brass band"" tend to conjur up pictures of marching bands.  What we have here, however, is in essence the brass section of a symphony orchestra.  While there is the odd march performed, by and large the selection of music played are among the most familiar and loveliest of classic pieces--Londonderry Air, Land of Hope and Glory, Rossini's William Tell Overture, and most beautiful of all, Rodrigo's En Aranjuez con tu Amor (what Danny calls the ""orange juice concerto""!).  As for the performance (by an actual colliery band)--it is simply breathtaking.In conclusion, I highly, highly recommend this well-written and consummately-acted film to anyone looking for quality entertainment.  Certainly, if you've enjoyed other films dealing with the plight of miners or factory workers in the North of England of the last two decades--films like Billy Elliot or The Full Monty, for example--this one's a must see.",5,An All Around First-Rate British Film!,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,2684,"['first', 'thing', 'say', 'absolutely', 'splendid', '100-minute', 'film', 'completely', 'ignore', 'write-up', 'cover', 'photo', 'give', 'impression', 'sort', 'light', 'half-baked', 'Hollywood-style', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fact', 'anything', 'Set', 'coal-mining', 'town', 'North', 'England', 'early', '90s', 'enlightening', 'moving', 'British', 'comedy-drama', 'emphasis', 'drama', 'centering', 'men', 'local', 'colliery', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'forever', 'changed', 'decision', 'close', 'mine', 'men', 'lives', 'relationships', 'one', 'are', 'revealed', 'interest', 'have', 'common', 'colliery', 'brass', 'band', 'Now', 'mine', 'closing', 'band', 'likely', 'be', 'next', 'casualty', 'one', 'thing', 'money', 'tight', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'dues', 'one', 'man', 'Danny', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Sharpe', 'Odediah', 'whom', 'band', 'more', 'just', 'casual', 'interest', 'life', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'existence', 'band.This', 'truly', 'first-rate', 'film', 'most', 'British', 'productions', 'not', 'one', 'performance', 'anything', 'less', 'perfect', 'film', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Woman', 'White', 'newcomer', 'who', 'band', 'unbeknownst', 'men', 'working', 'management', 'mine', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'really', 'Postlethwaite', 'who', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Danny', 'band', 'leader', 'conductor', 'really', 'film', 'sparkle', 'simply', 'must', 'mention', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'Ballykissangel', 'Father', 'Clifford', 'who', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Phil', 'Danny', 'son.The', 'other', 'thing', 'mentioning', 'film', 'music', 'words', 'brass', 'band', 'tend', 'conjur', 'up', 'pictures', 'marching', 'bands', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'however', 'essence', 'brass', 'section', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'odd', 'march', 'performed', 'large', 'selection', 'music', 'played', 'are', 'most', 'familiar', 'loveliest', 'classic', 'pieces', 'Londonderry', 'Air', 'Land', 'Hope', 'Glory', 'Rossini', 'William', 'Tell', 'Overture', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Rodrigo', 'En', 'Aranjuez', 'con', 'tu', 'Amor', 'what', 'Danny', 'orange', 'juice', 'concerto', 'performance', 'actual', 'colliery', 'band', 'simply', 'breathtaking.In', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'well-written', 'consummately-acted', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'Certainly', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'films', 'dealing', 'plight', 'miners', 'factory', 'workers', 'North', 'England', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'films', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'example', 'one', 'must', 'see']",Brassed Off VHS
