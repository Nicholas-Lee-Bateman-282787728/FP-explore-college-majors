But it is one of those movies with ridiculous and superfluous action sequences that defy physics for no apparent reason. It wasn't even that they were overboard, there was just so much of it that it not only didn't add to the story, it slowed down the movie.I just couldn't get into this at all, and I don't know that the average American would like it.

Same old bad guys chasing our victim and being trounced by the bodyguard. And, in terms of the obligatory dance and song there was nothing memorable or creative in that regard either. In fact the movie seemed to be a little too narcissistic from both the actors and settings. What is more disturbing is that Bollywood seems to be churning out the same fantasy dream to a population that lives in some of the world's worst non-healthy environments (extremely poor air, water, soil and food quality); a population that averages $750 per year and spends over 30% of that income on food whereas in comparison the US income averages $40,000 but only 6% on food.

1460619,A2MHQOBLOUMCX,B005GTMSQY,"Scott L. McMillan ""Scott""","[20, 20]","I like both Salman Khan & Kareena Kapoor a lot, that's the major reason ""Bodyguard"" was mostly enjoyable (which I saw on DVD).He plays the character 'Lovely Singh' - a dedicated Bodyguard, with great strength & fighting skills, who owes his life to a rich/respected man named 'Sartaj Rana'.  She plays the character 'Divya Rana' - the Daughter of 'Sartaj', she attends college and doesn't want a bodyguard but unknown to her she is a target.The information I've seen indicates this movie did well in India (mostly based on the Star power of these 2 main actors and good songs - the background theme music is very good).The first 2/3 of the movie is silly humor, but the 3 songs/dances in that first part are good (contemporary in look/sound) and seem primarily for Salman Khan (the first song includes a 1:25 short cameo by Katrina Kaif).  The several fight scenes are well done even though over-the-top as usual (almost as impressive as 'Dabangg').  The large side-kick guy character didn't click with me, just seemed a little obnoxious.In the last 3rd of the movie, the story/characters get better.  The remaining music video ""Teri Meri"" was really good/powerful, and has a better balance of Kareena Kapoor and Salman Khan (still can't get this song out of my head, Shreya Ghoshal has a really beautiful/pure voice - her singing is also great in movies like ""Vivah"").  The final fight scene is long, skillfully edited with good visual/audio effects, and brutal (but unique enough & well done).The movie's ending (last 10 minutes) can seem a little odd or hard to believe, with the time sequence jumping around, but it worked for me.Over-all the cinematography has good sharpness, lighting, color, & scenes (although no special/exotic locations).  The editing is usually good, especially in the fight scenes.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio is very good, with lots of action in the back speakers.But the DVD quality has slight noticeable compression, because even though 'Reliance Entertainment' did use anamorphic format they unfortunately squeezed it onto a single layer DVD disc(only using 4.2 GB file space, being a shorter than typical Bollywood movie at just over 2 hours long, they crammed in Special Features:""The Making Of 'BODYGUARD' movie"", ""The Making Of 'I Love You' dance"", & ""The Making Of 'Desi Beats' dance"").The END CREDITS have some 'out-take' clips shown on the left side of the screen (and some samples of the 'Teri Meri' REMIX fast tempo song version), and the ""Making Of"" also has a few funny 'out-takes'.The first movie I saw Salman Khan in was ""Marigold (2007)"" with Ali Larter, which is a good Hollywood/Bollywood hybrid movie (98% English dialogue, good music/dances & nice story, it got me hooked on Bollywood).  I first saw Kareena Kapoor in the movie ""Khushi (2003)"", which I liked a lot (very good contemporary music/dances & 'college-time' love story).",4,"First part silly, but enjoyed (great song)",1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,2891,"['like', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'lot', 'major', 'reason', 'Bodyguard', 'was', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'saw', 'DVD', '.He', 'character', ""'Lovely"", 'Singh', 'dedicated', 'Bodyguard', 'great', 'strength', 'fighting', 'skills', 'who', 'life', 'rich/respected', 'man', 'named', ""'Sartaj"", 'Rana', 'character', 'Rana', 'Daughter', ""'Sartaj"", 'college', ""n't"", 'want', 'bodyguard', 'unknown', 'target.The', 'information', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'India', 'mostly', 'based', 'Star', 'power', '2', 'main', 'actors', 'good', 'songs', 'background', 'theme', 'music', 'very', 'good', '.The', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'silly', 'humor', '3', 'songs/dances', 'first', 'part', 'are', 'good', 'contemporary', 'look/sound', 'seem', 'primarily', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'first', 'song', '1:25', 'short', 'cameo', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'several', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'though', 'over-the-top', 'usual', 'almost', 'as', 'impressive', ""'Dabangg"", 'large', 'side-kick', 'guy', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'obnoxious.In', 'last', '3rd', 'movie', 'story/characters', 'get', 'better', 'remaining', 'music', 'video', 'Teri', 'Meri', 'was', 'really', 'good/powerful', 'better', 'balance', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'song', 'head', 'Shreya', 'Ghoshal', 'really', 'beautiful/pure', 'voice', 'singing', 'also', 'great', 'movies', 'Vivah', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'long', 'skillfully', 'edited', 'good', 'visual/audio', 'effects', 'brutal', 'unique', 'enough', 'well', 'done', '.The', 'movie', 'ending', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'can', 'seem', 'little', 'odd', 'hard', 'believe', 'time', 'sequence', 'jumping', 'around', 'worked', 'me.Over-all', 'cinematography', 'good', 'sharpness', 'lighting', 'color', 'scenes', 'special/exotic', 'locations', 'editing', 'usually', 'good', 'especially', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'lots', 'action', 'back', 'DVD', 'quality', 'slight', 'noticeable', 'compression', 'even', ""'Reliance"", 'Entertainment', 'did', 'use', 'anamorphic', 'format', 'unfortunately', 'squeezed', 'single', 'layer', 'DVD', 'disc', 'only', 'using', '4.2', 'GB', 'file', 'space', 'being', 'shorter', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'crammed', 'Special', 'Features', 'Making', ""'BODYGUARD"", 'movie', 'Making', 'Love', 'dance', 'Making', ""'Desi"", 'Beats', 'dance', '.The', 'END', 'CREDITS', 'have', ""'out-take"", 'clips', 'shown', 'left', 'side', 'screen', 'samples', ""'Teri"", 'Meri', 'REMIX', 'fast', 'tempo', 'song', 'version', 'Making', 'also', 'few', 'funny', ""'out-takes'.The"", 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'was', 'Marigold', '2007', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'good', 'Hollywood/Bollywood', 'hybrid', 'movie', '98', '%', 'English', 'dialogue', 'good', 'music/dances', 'nice', 'story', 'got', 'hooked', 'Bollywood', 'first', 'saw', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'movie', 'Khushi', '2003', 'liked', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'contemporary', 'music/dances', ""'college-time"", 'love', 'story']",Bodyguard
