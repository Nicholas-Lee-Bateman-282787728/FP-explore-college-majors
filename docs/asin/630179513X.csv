266275,A18BD98SU49UB7,630179513X,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[0, 0]","Marty ends his adventures, as everybody knows, in this the Western installment of the Back to the future trilogy. From the Giant ice cube machine to the catchy ho-down dance music from ZZ Top, this is the most light hearted in the series. In all of the Back to the Future films, there is are things that happen that we expect. Such as, ""Mom, I had a terrible nightmare,"" and Biff getting coated in Manuer. Thats all in the fun, and we never get tired of it. In fact, after the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series this probably falls under the most loved series ever produced.The only problem may have been the lack of the usual frenzy generated during several trips back and forth between past and future. I didn't mind it in the least. It was kind of nice to see Marty settle down into an adventure in which thing's stay put. Marty must save Doctor Brown. Sounds simple enough, until both a broken delorean (that I have seen in person) and Doc's heart condition causes problems...he's fallen in love with a local school teacher. Ignoring the endless theories of time and space, he follows his heart to an ending that may catch you off guard.Biff can't get much nastier. The suspense couldn't get much better. We say goodbye to Marty, but are his adventures really over? ~S.A.O.S.~",4,The Flea off a Dog's back,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,1280,"['Marty', 'adventures', 'everybody', 'Western', 'installment', 'Back', 'future', 'trilogy', 'Giant', 'ice', 'cube', 'machine', 'catchy', 'ho-down', 'dance', 'music', 'ZZ', 'Top', 'most', 'light', 'hearted', 'series', 'Back', 'Future', 'films', 'are', 'things', 'happen', 'expect', 'Such', 'Mom', 'had', 'terrible', 'nightmare', 'Biff', 'getting', 'coated', 'Manuer', 'Thats', 'fun', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'fact', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', 'probably', 'most', 'loved', 'series', 'ever', 'only', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lack', 'usual', 'frenzy', 'generated', 'several', 'trips', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'future', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'least', 'was', 'kind', 'nice', 'see', 'Marty', 'settle', 'down', 'adventure', 'thing', 'stay', 'put', 'Marty', 'must', 'save', 'Doctor', 'Brown', 'simple', 'enough', 'broken', 'delorean', 'have', 'seen', 'person', 'Doc', 'heart', 'condition', 'problems', 'fallen', 'love', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'Ignoring', 'endless', 'theories', 'time', 'space', 'heart', 'ending', 'may', 'catch', 'off', 'guard.Biff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'nastier', 'suspense', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Marty', 'are', 'adventures', 'really', '~S.A.O.S.~']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

Well, this movie isn't exactly a western, but it's a nice twist in the direction of the series, and a good conclusion to this excellent saga. This time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and our favorite mad scientist Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are stuck in the Old West, and that premise gives a lot of opportunities to play with opposite genres, Western and Sci-Fi.&quot;Back To The Future, Part III&quot; also presents references to classic westerns, specially John Huston's famous camera angles that show desert landscapes, and spaghetti westerns, like Sergio Leone's &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot; and &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; trilogy (or &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy, if you prefer). One funny example of a reference to classic westerns happens when someone asks Marty his name, and he always answers &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;.I can't imagine a different cast in these movies: Michael J. Fox superbly plays the hero of the trilogy, Christopher Lloyd does what he does better: he plays a lunatic, Thomas F. Wilson mastered the role of Tannen (Biff, Griff and Mad Dog Tannen). In few words, every actor seems perfect for every role.&quot;Back To The Future, Part III&quot; is a very amusing movie, it has comedy, action and romance, and the movie closes one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made.",3,THE FUNNIEST WESTERN EVER MADE.,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,1381,"['***', 'stars', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'III', 'quot', 'Well', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'western', 'nice', 'twist', 'direction', 'series', 'good', 'conclusion', 'excellent', 'saga', 'time', 'Marty', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'favorite', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Doc', 'Emmett', 'Brown', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'stuck', 'Old', 'West', 'premise', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'play', 'opposite', 'genres', 'Western', 'Sci-Fi.', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'III', 'quot', 'also', 'references', 'classic', 'westerns', 'specially', 'John', 'Huston', 'famous', 'camera', 'show', 'desert', 'landscapes', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'quot', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'West', 'quot', 'quot', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'quot', 'trilogy', 'quot', 'Dollars', 'quot', 'trilogy', 'prefer', 'One', 'funny', 'example', 'reference', 'classic', 'westerns', 'when', 'someone', 'Marty', 'name', 'always', 'quot', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'quot', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'different', 'cast', 'movies', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'superbly', 'hero', 'trilogy', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'what', 'better', 'lunatic', 'Thomas', 'F.', 'Wilson', 'mastered', 'role', 'Tannen', 'Biff', 'Griff', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Tannen', 'few', 'words', 'actor', 'perfect', 'role.', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'III', 'quot', 'very', 'amusing', 'movie', 'comedy', 'action', 'romance', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'trilogies', 'ever', 'made']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

Okay, dumb question number uno...when Marty McFly flew to the year of 1885 and parked his car in the cave for stashing, how come there wasn't another DeLorean in the cave? Really, I learned a lesson in the second part that if one transported himself to 1955 when he himself was also there, there would be duplicates. Dumb question number two...how about paying eighty dollars to Mad Dog Tannen? That would have solved the problem. Dumb question number three...if Clint Eastwood is a famous name in the Wild West, then would there be no more Dirty Harry? Dumb question number four...the ending, where did the train come from? Dumb question number five...if Doc Brown saved Clara Clayton's life two or three days before his timely death, how is it that Clara's name appears on his tombstone? In other words, if Doc Brown didn't save her, then the ravine would be aptly named Clayton Ravine. Thus Doc Brown would have never met Clara Clayton, and henceforth. Dumb question number six...if Mad Dog got arrested, would that have delayed the generations of Tannen family, or perhaps the family would never exist? Dumb question number seven...where was the marshal the whole time? Dumb question number eight...if Marty McFly transported himself into October 27th of 1985, would he have seen his duplicate also? Dumb question number nine...when Clara Clayton gave birth to two sons with Doc Brown, how come, during the new train scene, she still looks like as if she only met Doc Brown for two seconds? Okay, enough of the dumb questions. Having less Biff helped a lot, how Back to the Future Part III ended left a sour taste on my mouth. It was like what I said in the second part, having cool parents is preferred over dumb ones. I felt that Back to the Future Part III rendered the second part useless because it's like as if 2015 almost never happened.

266281,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,630179513X,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","This 1990 sequel was shot back to back with Back To The Future 2. Again, it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starred Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. In this, the third and final chapter in the series, Marty McFly(Fox)is transported, thanks to the delorean, to the year 1885. The Old West. There, he tries to save Doc Brown(Lloyd)who is to be shot and killed by a mad gunmen. Is it any surprise that the guy who is supposed to kill Doc Brown is a relation to Biff?. No, it isn't. But there are a few other problems as well. On his trip to 1885, the delorean gets a hole punctured in the fuel tank. They are trapped there. The other, is that Doc has fallen in love with a sweet school marm(played by Mary Steenburgen). Doc is conflicted between leaving and saving his life, or staying and being with the woman he truly loves, and face the chance of getting shot. The two find a way to gain enough speed to get the delorean in motion and send them back to 1985. If you haven't seen it, I won't say how. This chapter in the brilliant series is a real fun, crowd pleaser. However, it lacks a lot of the punch the first two had. The effects and everything are mild and tame in this one. Not as exciting as the previous ones. Still, it is a wonderfully made and put together film. It is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. A very satisfying end to the whole saga. Fox and Lloyd are, as always, top notch. Thomas Wilson as Biff's ancestor is, well, he's still Biff. Would we want him any other way?. Probably not. Steenburgen does the best with what she's given. It's too bad that Lea Thompson, who had such an important and prominent role in the first and second, was relegated to almost 'cameo' status in this one. Oh well.

266283,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,630179513X,Ben Milton,"[1, 2]","This movie falls in that in between slot, As one reviewer put it. The Clara character is totally useless in this movie, Since Doc is in his 70's to 80's. While Mary Steenburgen is clearly in her early 40's, Marty is reduced to a side kick in this movie. The movie opens where II left off, Marty watching the Delorean disappear in the sky.And having the postal service guy show up in the rain, giving Marty the letter from Doc in the 1800's. So now, with the help of the 1955 Doc, he finds the buried Delorean. Fixes it, and heads back to the west, to save Doc, since he got shot and killed. And the Tannen ancestor makes an appearance here too in Mad Dog Tannen, but what sets this movie apart from the other two, is the pace. And it's slooooooooow, At first. Because the fuel line on the delorean got cut, they now have to figure out a way to get the car up to 88 miles per hour. And the answer comes in the form of a train, which is plausible. And then the movie derails, it gets lost in a romance between Doc, and Clara.And like I said before, there is no chemistry there. It actually feels forced, yes it leads to Christopher Llyod's first ever on screen kiss. but it just doesn't really go anywhere, yes there's the famous Clint eastwood parody done by Marty during his gunfight with Buford. And clara all of a sudden leaves Doc, the reason never really given. But as the train is leaving, she overhears two men talking about Doc's pining over her. And so she decides to head back to town, only Marty and Doc have already left. She catches up to the train that they've hijacked, Marty already being in the car. Lets Doc stay with Clara as the car goes back to 1985, and the train goes over the unfinished bridge. Marty manages to get out of the car, just as an oncoming train runs over the car, totally destroying it. And really to be quite honest, they should have left the movie at that point, Marty picking up Jennifer and going back to the delorean to pick up the pieces. But Doc and Clara show up their kids, in a new and improved Time machine, a train. While it's a good movie, it's not as good as the other two. The jokes aren't as crisp, and the romance is forced.

266284,A2ELP1ML0GWN3F,630179513X,Ben R,"[1, 3]","The Back to the Future trilogy is a great series, but I think part 3 is the weakest movie of the series. Of course, it has a lot of things incorporated from the other two, but it has some new things, too. Part 3  is, basically, a western because 80% of it is set in Hill Valley 1885.  Originally, Marty was just going to go home in the DeLorean (which is in a  hole underground and has been for 70 years,) but now he must save the Doc  of 1885, because he will die in 7 days. When he goes back there, he finds  out that Doc Brown has a GIRLFRIEND! But he also has crashed the DeLorean  and the fuel leaked so now he can't go back. But Doc of course finds a way-  the train will push the DeLorean until it gets to 88 mph. But first Marty  must save Doc from the western outlaw Biff (another Biff, called Buford,  who is hilarious again) and he must save himself.

266286,AE0E6UII0VSZA,630179513X,Blake Kleiner,"[3, 3]","""Back to the Future Part III"" is, in my opinion, the best of the entire trilogy. Of course, that's just my opinion, but I can't be wrong because it's a point of view, right? That out of the way, let's get to some heavy duty praising for one of our best directors, Robert Zemeckis. There are very few directors who have such a love for the craft of filmmaking that, when you see their work on the screen, you know they were going totally buckwild, just having the time of their lives with all the gadgets at their disposal. Sam Raimi is one, Spielberg, Shyamalan, and Lucas are three more, and definitely our dear Bob Zemeckis. All you have to do is look at his menagerie of films: ""Back to the Future"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""What Lies Beneath"". Even though I didn't like ""What Lies Beneath"", it still had some of the coolest camera moves I've seen in recent years. But come on, ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Forrest Gump"", not to mention said trilogy are classics, filled with remarkable visuals and a wonderful sense of humanity. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is no exception to that rule.This isn't usually revered as the best of the films. In fact, other than a few friends of mine, the only critic I know of to agree is Leonard Maltin. But I believe it to be for a few reasons. First, this is by far the most fast-paced entry in the trilogy. It moves from scene to scene at 88 mph and never stops until the end. Secondly, despite this enormously fast pace, it never ceases to have a beating heart at its center. The love story in the film, which finally revolves around Doc, is very sweet, and the friendship between Doc and Marty continues to grow. Third, the dialogue in this film seems like it went into hyperkinetic overdrive. It zips! That's why, even in a film of mostly character driven scenes, it never loses pace. There's also a very clever reversal of character stereotyping between Doc and Marty that I'm glad they saved for this film. If it had been in the second or even the first one, it wouldn't have come off as well.But anyway, as is the usual with the plot of these films, look at the title. We are in the year 1885, and Marty has torn the fuel line on the DeLorean, which looks really hilarious with white-wall tires from 1955. So, in order to get the time machine up to 88 mph, Doc devises a plan to hijack... oh, sorry... borrow a locomotive, and using some very specially made crystal logs, getting the boiler hot enough to push the time machine back to the future. Meanwhile, we've got the threat of a duel with good old Biff's grandfather, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, and the aforementioned love story between Doc and a teacher named Clara who he managed to save before a grisly fall to her death. All very simple, all very smartly done, using all the cliches from spaghetti westerns to its advantage, and with incredible visual effects for its action-packed, explosive finale.It's really hard not to like this series of films. I don't know anyone who doesn't like them. And I think most of that has to do with the fact that, even with all the wackiness and special effects and one-liners and comedy, what really draws people to these films is that the characters are us: They don't react all that differently from how we would. And we all wonder from time to time what would happen if we could go back and change our past, or if one little different thing happened, how would we turn out? The ""Back to the Future"" films address all of these things with a whole lot of brains, heart, and laughter.",5,"Last, but far from least, with miraculous movie magic",1018396800,"04 10, 2002",2002,3539,"['Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'III', 'opinion', 'best', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'point', 'view', 'right', 'way', 'let', 'get', 'heavy', 'duty', 'praising', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'love', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'when', 'see', 'work', 'screen', 'know', 'were', 'going', 'totally', 'buckwild', 'just', 'having', 'time', 'lives', 'gadgets', 'disposal', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'Shyamalan', 'Lucas', 'are', 'three', 'more', 'definitely', 'dear', 'Bob', 'Zemeckis', 'All', 'have', 'do', 'look', 'menagerie', 'films', 'Back', 'Future', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'What', 'Beneath', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'What', 'Beneath', 'still', 'had', 'coolest', 'camera', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'come', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'not', 'mention', 'said', 'trilogy', 'are', 'classics', 'filled', 'remarkable', 'visuals', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'humanity', 'Back', 'Future', 'Part', 'III', 'exception', 'rule.This', ""n't"", 'usually', 'revered', 'best', 'films', 'fact', 'other', 'few', 'friends', 'mine', 'only', 'critic', 'know', 'agree', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'believe', 'be', 'few', 'reasons', 'First', 'far', 'most', 'fast-paced', 'entry', 'trilogy', 'scene', 'scene', '88', 'mph', 'never', 'stops', 'end', 'Secondly', 'enormously', 'fast', 'pace', 'never', 'have', 'beating', 'heart', 'center', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'finally', 'Doc', 'very', 'sweet', 'friendship', 'Doc', 'Marty', 'grow', 'Third', 'dialogue', 'film', 'went', 'hyperkinetic', 'overdrive', 'why', 'even', 'film', 'mostly', 'character', 'driven', 'scenes', 'never', 'pace', 'also', 'very', 'clever', 'reversal', 'character', 'stereotyping', 'Doc', 'Marty', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saved', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'second', 'even', 'first', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'off', 'well.But', 'anyway', 'usual', 'plot', 'films', 'look', 'title', 'are', 'year', '1885', 'Marty', 'torn', 'fuel', 'line', 'DeLorean', 'really', 'hilarious', 'white-wall', 'tires', '1955', 'So', 'order', 'get', 'time', 'machine', 'up', '88', 'mph', 'Doc', 'plan', 'hijack', 'oh', 'sorry', 'borrow', 'locomotive', 'using', 'very', 'specially', 'made', 'crystal', 'logs', 'getting', 'boiler', 'hot', 'enough', 'push', 'time', 'machine', 'back', 'future', 'Meanwhile', ""'ve"", 'got', 'threat', 'duel', 'good', 'old', 'Biff', 'grandfather', 'Buford', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Tannen', 'aforementioned', 'love', 'story', 'Doc', 'teacher', 'named', 'Clara', 'who', 'managed', 'save', 'grisly', 'fall', 'death', 'very', 'simple', 'very', 'smartly', 'done', 'using', 'cliches', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'advantage', 'incredible', 'visual', 'effects', 'action-packed', 'explosive', 'finale.It', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'series', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'most', 'do', 'fact', 'even', 'wackiness', 'special', 'effects', 'one-liners', 'comedy', 'what', 'really', 'draws', 'people', 'films', 'characters', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'react', 'differently', 'how', 'would', 'wonder', 'time', 'time', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'change', 'past', 'one', 'little', 'different', 'thing', 'happened', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'Back', 'Future', 'films', 'things', 'whole', 'lot', 'brains', 'heart', 'laughter']",Back to the Future Part III VHS
266287,A1YB29BIDULEYE,630179513X,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","Well, here we come to the 3rd and (sniff) final chapter. I bought the trilogy for my mother, and while she did enjoy parts 1 and 2, she felt this 3rd one was the best. And we could easily argue that the 3rd is the best. Going through my mother's TAXI DVDs, it seems that Christopher Lloyd brings the most qualities of his famous character Jim Ignatowski into play here. (Example: reading a letter he wrote and crying: 'I never knew I could write anything so touching.')Marty finds that Doc Brown will be murdered back in 1885 (where he ended up at the end of Part 2 when the lightning struck the time machine). So the 1955 Doc Brown helps Marty get the time machine working again.There is somewhat of a sad winding down as we see that when we first saw the time machine in Part 1, it could only be driven. Then by the end of part 1 the time machine could fly; now in Part 3, it can no longer fly and can only be driven; and soon after Marty arrives in 1885, he has an accident, and it can no longer move and must be pushed or pulled somehow. (SIGH) With some sad symbolism, we know that this is going to be the last chapter.Moving on, Marty runs across his great great grandfather (played also by Michael J. Fox). This is interesting in that he finally has a blood relative 'father figure' on his adventures. And he spends a fair amount of time explaining to Marty that if he keeps jumping everytime someone calls him 'chicken' he's going to eventually plague himself with disastrous and possibly irreversible consequences. (We already heard his parents speak about this in Part 2. So we know something is going to possibly happen because of this.)Without going on too long, Doc Brown realizes that he has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara. So, this of course complicates things. Escaping into the future could mean breaking his own heart as well as hers.In all honesty, this 3rd chapter has the most suspense as well as the most value in the ways of characters growing. Marty (with the help of his great great grandfather and Doc Brown too) realizes that it's stupid to jump everytime someone calls you a name. And after all the time he thought about the future, Doc finds that he is most happy in the past.Lloyd brought REAL comedy to the role when he portrays himself as a depressed drinker talking about the future in the old west. (Another Jim Ignatowski moment.)It's probably also right to take amoment to talk about the antagonist Thomas Wilson. He could be a convincing bully, a tough mafia type, an evil cowboy, and even a nice redeemable guy as we have seen in the end of Part 1, and again in Part 3.Robert Englund was not so likable as the principal in Parts 1 and 2. BUT, he is really likable and admirable as the ancestor of his Prinicpal Strickland  character Marshal Strickland. This is Englund's best moment in the trilogy. He knows he can't just kill Maddog Tannenn, but he isn't blinded by the 'law abiding citizen act' either. ""Maddog, the only party I'll be celebrating is the one that ends with you hanging at the end of a rope.""Overall, it's a great trilogy.

With the help of the Doc of 1955 Marty is able to get to the past and take on an old west thug nammed  ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. Besides taking on that gun slinging criminal , Doc has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara who he has to tell the truth to about where he is from. If things weren't bad enough, the DeLorean has no gas and now they have to figure out a way to get back to the future again by getting the time machine to 88mph. Its a true wild west romp and it ends the trillogy in a decent mannor.This movie sorta slows down the pace a bit , and unfortunatly I think a bit to much, when you look back at the two previous to this installment. It lacks the fun and newness of the first and the action and story of the second and pretty much turns into a second rate western with Back to the Future characters in the roles, with them trying to relive the idea of a kid from the 80s trapped in another time period like in the first film, but it just doesn't work for a 1880's setting. Bottom line, while it is a good movie at points, the fun just isn't here as it wants to be.While not as good as the other two it does have its moments. The fun of seeing Doc's lab at the begining in 1955 which has a lot of the hidden jokes from the first within. Some good western jokes like him taking the name ""Clint Eastwood"" and a very exciting climax with a huge locomotive pushing the DeLorean on traintracks, all make this movie still worth it and a good one to watch.  Just don't expect the fun time traveling and characters that were in the other two. They stay trapped in the west for most of the movie and the amount of things that just seem to not make sense are very high in this movie. A lot of contradictions show up at various points to things that were well established in other movies (IE Not remembering who put Marty in the tacky clothing he winds up wearing). It is still a must have for anyone that is a fan of the Back to the Future series especialy as it just isn't complete without knowing how it ends or even a fan of a good movie to pass the time. Just don't expect to much as it doesn't deliever like the other two did with flying colors. It does end the trillogy on an up note and something that will make you smile and still want more. It will also make you wish they had more going on in 1985 at the end then the quick rushed ending they seem to come up with.

I have a hard time imagining that anyone would dislike the plot. The second of the movie is better. It goes to the future and even gives a nice spin on the original movie.The third one I think is a bit off. I like the idea of the wild west. I believe in several parts of the original, Doc mentioned that his favorite era in time is the wild west. By the end of Back to the Future part 2, Doc went back to his favorite era by a freak lightning accident. Doc wrote Marty a letter that explains the issue and that he stored the car in an abandoned mine with instructions on how to rebuild a missing part of the time machine so he can get back to the year 1985. Marty then finds out that Doc actually dies and Marty decides to travel back to save Doc from being murdered. Marty travels back and the fuel tanks gets a hole which causes the vehicle to be disabled.So with that in mind, this is where the movie begins to fail. While Marty and Doc were discussing ideas, I was actually pounding my head on the table saying, ""If all they need is gas, then couldn't they simply use the gas from the time machine that Doc stored in the mine?"" If Doc stored the time machine, and Marty came back with it, then the time machine that Doc stored would still be in the mine. And he could have easily re-written the letter to include instructions to put in gas. Plus in Back to the Future 2, it is suggested that Doc made some upgrades to the car to include alternative fuel. Some odd reason Doc it also runs on gas. So I'm a bit confused there as well.So this baffled me and instead the entire movie made into a bizarre attempt to get the car up to 88 miles per hour and then a love story. For this, I felt the movie was the weakest and most certainly a bad ending to an otherwise good series.",3,Not as great as the other two movies,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,1915,"['whole', 'Back', 'Future', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'awesome', 'first', 'Back', 'Future', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'created', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'anyone', 'would', 'dislike', 'plot', 'second', 'movie', 'better', 'future', 'even', 'nice', 'spin', 'original', 'movie.The', 'third', 'one', 'think', 'bit', 'like', 'idea', 'wild', 'west', 'believe', 'several', 'parts', 'original', 'Doc', 'mentioned', 'favorite', 'era', 'time', 'wild', 'west', 'end', 'Back', 'Future', 'part', '2', 'Doc', 'went', 'back', 'favorite', 'era', 'freak', 'lightning', 'accident', 'Doc', 'wrote', 'Marty', 'letter', 'issue', 'stored', 'car', 'abandoned', 'mine', 'instructions', 'how', 'rebuild', 'missing', 'part', 'time', 'machine', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'year', '1985', 'Marty', 'then', 'out', 'Doc', 'actually', 'Marty', 'travel', 'back', 'save', 'Doc', 'being', 'murdered', 'Marty', 'back', 'fuel', 'tanks', 'hole', 'vehicle', 'be', 'disabled.So', 'mind', 'where', 'movie', 'fail', 'Marty', 'Doc', 'were', 'discussing', 'ideas', 'was', 'actually', 'pounding', 'head', 'table', 'saying', 'need', 'gas', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'simply', 'use', 'gas', 'time', 'machine', 'Doc', 'stored', 'mine', 'Doc', 'stored', 'time', 'machine', 'Marty', 'came', 'back', 'then', 'time', 'machine', 'Doc', 'stored', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'mine', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 're-written', 'letter', 'include', 'instructions', 'put', 'gas', 'Back', 'Future', '2', 'suggested', 'Doc', 'made', 'upgrades', 'car', 'include', 'alternative', 'fuel', 'odd', 'reason', 'Doc', 'also', 'gas', ""'m"", 'bit', 'confused', 'there', 'well.So', 'baffled', 'instead', 'entire', 'movie', 'made', 'bizarre', 'attempt', 'get', 'car', 'up', '88', 'miles', 'hour', 'then', 'love', 'story', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'weakest', 'most', 'certainly', 'bad', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'good', 'series']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

I thought both were nonsensical (as if a movie about time travel is practical) while superficially trite, but through the years I've mellowed a tad.  After repeated viewings of this third and final installment, while I still find it embarrassingly silly with its relentless shark jumping, I still have fun watching it.The primary focus of my enjoyment is the comedic mayhem of Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown, and Thomas F. Wilson as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.  As the third installment finds the characters in 1885, Lloyd and Wilson have the lion's share of funny scenes, as Doc Brown adapts to his techno-depraved environment, while 'Mad Dog' aptly demonstrates why he is the originator of the Tannen line of bullies.  Both actors are genuinely funny, and make the most of what they have to work with, which periodically is hemmed in by contrivance and plain silliness.Michael J. Fox is fine reprising his role as the determined Marty McFly, yet I was rolling my eyes as he doubled as McFly's great-great-grandfather Seamus McFly, with Lea Thompson playing Seamus's wife (obviously, the filmmakers needed something for Thompson to do).  This thin ploy never really worked.  And Doc Brown's love story with school marm Clara (Mary Steenburgen) is never fully vetted or developed.  The Jules Vernesque ending is another layer over the top, yet despite all these misgivings BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is a fun way to say goodbye to an entertaining franchise.--D.

The special effects take a back seat in the Old West, but the film never loses much steam, as we enjoy seeing Marty adjust to life in a harsh -- but comic -- reality. One of the real and unexpected treats of Back to the Future III is Thomas Wilson -- who played Biff in the first two movies -- as &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen.

Another  significant change from the others lies in the opportunity given to Christopher Lloyd to show, for a few minutes, that The Nutty Professor is only one of the many roles which this cultivated actor is capable of playing. For the most part, Michael Fox remains appealing in the lead; however, it seems to me, he is less credible as a high school adolescent than in the previous two pictures in the series (close in time though they were in their production). To the extent this is an accurate perception, it makes little difference in our accepting him as what he is supposed to be. The supporting players ham it up as they are supposed to do, with the exception of the attractive Mary Steenburgen, who gives the School Marm a suitably luscious presence, if not quite the flavor of Mae West in either of her Western outings.All-in-all, this is an enjoyable Western comedy, and, certainly a family movie (if such still exist).",4,Good Fun to End the Series,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1286,"['Reminiscent', 'spirit', 'not', 'particulars', 'popular', 'Western', 'comedies', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'was', 'making', 'generation', 'film', 'mention', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'numerous', 'predecessors', '.Possibly', 'reason', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'second', 'entry', 'series', 'quite', 'watchable-', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'significant', 'change', 'others', 'opportunity', 'given', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'show', 'few', 'minutes', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'roles', 'cultivated', 'actor', 'capable', 'playing', 'most', 'part', 'Michael', 'Fox', 'appealing', 'lead', 'however', 'less', 'credible', 'high', 'school', 'adolescent', 'previous', 'two', 'pictures', 'series', 'close', 'time', 'were', 'production', 'extent', 'accurate', 'perception', 'little', 'difference', 'accepting', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'supporting', 'players', 'ham', 'up', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'exception', 'attractive', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'who', 'School', 'Marm', 'suitably', 'luscious', 'presence', 'not', 'flavor', 'Mae', 'West', 'Western', 'outings.All-in-all', 'enjoyable', 'Western', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'family', 'movie', 'such', 'still', 'exist']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

266309,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,630179513X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 5]","The three films have to be watched one after the other. They are a whole. They are first of all and above all a marvellous piece of entertainment with two elements that come back as salient characteristics. First Biff and his transformation in time according to various accidents in the time line. A bully remains a bully even when circumstances tame him slightly. The second is a reference to Clint Eastwood in the funniest possible way. It is crucial in the end, but you have to discover the twist. The first film's trip to the past is kind of pulpy because it is an intervention in the parents life, when they are teenagers and the question is how can the son help the parents get together and become the progenitors the son needs to exist. A trip into the past that changes slightly the present, but with no serious consequences. The second film is heftier in that sense that a trip to the future causes a twist in the time line that requires a new trip to the past to correct the twist. Funny because the three time periods are mixing in the most hilarious way. The third film is for pleasure. It is about the retrieving party that is supposed to bring Doc back to the present from his very distant nineteenth century past. He will not come back, except for a visit later on. The time machine will also be destroyed and things will come back to normal, except maybe for Doc Emmet Brown, but he likes the change.This film deals with time, the present, the past and the future and beyond the entertaining aspect it is deeply reflexive. First, time must not be changed in anyway without tremendous consequences. We must not play with time. Second, the travels in the past show how things have changed from one period to the next, from the past, no matter which, to the present. Some of the questions are serious, like the future of black people in 1955. The answer is in 1985. Just as serious is the fate or future of bullies if by any chance they get power, that is to say money. We must stand our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position. Just as serious is also the question about heredity : one generation always reproduces what the previous generation has done. A bully has to be born from a family of bullies even if circumstances can guide the realisation of this bully-ness. Then the position of science in our society is extremely fragile because it may disturb the flux of history with some unforeseen and unforeseeable invention that is the result of some crazy imagination in some mad scientist. We must both trust and question science in our society. The films are optimistic provided science is kept in its place, that is to say the margin of history, otherwise catastrophes can occur. Finally, travelling in time is funny and the stories of such travels have to be hilarious and the films are superb.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Entertaining, funny but hefty",1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,2924,"['three', 'films', 'have', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'other', 'are', 'whole', 'are', 'first', 'marvellous', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'two', 'elements', 'come', 'back', 'salient', 'characteristics', 'First', 'Biff', 'transformation', 'time', 'according', 'various', 'accidents', 'time', 'line', 'bully', 'bully', 'even', 'when', 'circumstances', 'tame', 'slightly', 'second', 'reference', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'funniest', 'possible', 'way', 'crucial', 'end', 'have', 'discover', 'twist', 'first', 'film', 'trip', 'past', 'kind', 'pulpy', 'intervention', 'parents', 'life', 'when', 'are', 'teenagers', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'son', 'help', 'parents', 'get', 'together', 'become', 'progenitors', 'son', 'exist', 'trip', 'past', 'slightly', 'present', 'serious', 'consequences', 'second', 'film', 'heftier', 'sense', 'trip', 'future', 'twist', 'time', 'line', 'new', 'trip', 'past', 'correct', 'twist', 'Funny', 'three', 'time', 'periods', 'are', 'mixing', 'most', 'hilarious', 'way', 'third', 'film', 'pleasure', 'retrieving', 'party', 'supposed', 'bring', 'Doc', 'back', 'present', 'very', 'distant', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'past', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'visit', 'later', 'time', 'machine', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'destroyed', 'things', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'normal', 'maybe', 'Doc', 'Emmet', 'Brown', 'change.This', 'film', 'deals', 'time', 'present', 'past', 'future', 'entertaining', 'aspect', 'deeply', 'reflexive', 'First', 'time', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'changed', 'anyway', 'tremendous', 'consequences', 'must', 'not', 'play', 'time', 'Second', 'travels', 'past', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'one', 'period', 'next', 'past', 'matter', 'present', 'questions', 'are', 'serious', 'future', 'black', 'people', '1955', 'answer', '1985', 'Just', 'serious', 'fate', 'future', 'bullies', 'chance', 'get', 'power', 'say', 'money', 'must', 'stand', 'ground', 'front', 'keep', 'place', 'margins', 'society', 'tolerated', 'existence', 'not', 'dominant', 'position', 'Just', 'serious', 'also', 'question', 'heredity', 'one', 'generation', 'always', 'what', 'previous', 'generation', 'done', 'bully', 'be', 'born', 'family', 'bullies', 'even', 'circumstances', 'can', 'guide', 'realisation', 'bully-ness', 'Then', 'position', 'science', 'society', 'extremely', 'fragile', 'may', 'disturb', 'flux', 'history', 'unforeseen', 'unforeseeable', 'invention', 'result', 'crazy', 'imagination', 'mad', 'scientist', 'must', 'trust', 'question', 'science', 'society', 'films', 'are', 'optimistic', 'provided', 'science', 'kept', 'place', 'say', 'margin', 'history', 'otherwise', 'catastrophes', 'can', 'occur', 'Finally', 'travelling', 'time', 'funny', 'stories', 'such', 'travels', 'have', 'be', 'hilarious', 'films', 'are', 'superb.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

This movie has everything, friendship, romance, homour, action and wonderful Western scences. The Western scences make this movie look epic, the friendship between Marty and Doc is keep growing and the bond between them is so strong. The action is the best of the trilogy, just look at the duel of Marty and his nemesis and the train part. The romance for Doc and a school teacher is charm of this movie. Finally a perfect ending for this classic trilogy. The main character, Marty, also 'grown up' from last two movie, I say grown up that is because he can control his attitude when somebody called him chicken or coward even he knows he doesn't have to fight to. Hence he changes his future from nearly a car accident from Part II. Although this movie is less homour than last two, but it should be the way it is.

For many years this was my least favorite film in the trilogy, but watching it again for the first time in years I have new appreciation for it.  ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a satisfying and worthy end to this trilogy.At the end of the second movie the DeLorean is struck by lightening (which we already know provides the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of energy required for time travel) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is sent somewhen in time.  Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 Hill Valley, but just after Doc and the DeLorean disappears a letter arrives for Marty.  The letter is from Doc and was written in 1885.  It was left as the post office with the instructions to be delivered on that particular date at that particular time.  The letter says that Doc is alive and well in 1885 and under no circumstances is Marty to try to go back and rescue him.Marty returns to the 1955 Doc Brown and enlists his help to recover the DeLorean which was left in a cave for 70 years.  While recovering the DeLorean Marty discovers a tombstone with Doc's name on it...and the date that Doc died was only a week after he wrote the letter!  The tombstone reads ""shot in the back by Buford Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) over a matter of $80"".  There is no way Marty is going to let this happen, so he puts gas in the DeLorean and travels back in time to 1885 to help Doc.  Of course, if it was that simple, we wouldn't have much of a movie, so complications evolve.  The DeLorean ruptures its gas line, so that it leaks gas and can no longer be driven under its own power.  Part of the movie is Doc and Marty trying to get the DeLorean back up to 88 miles per hour, but there is also the matter of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen who still intends to shoot Doc over that matter of eighty dollars...or will history change and will Marty's name on that tombstone?  This final installment also introduces a love interest for Doc Brown in the person of Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), the new school teacher with an interest in science.This movie is much more of a straight forward action/adventure/comedy (whatever) movie.  The time travel serves to get Marty in the past and back to the present, but there isn't as much playing around with time travel as there is in the second movie.  I still think this might be the weakest of the movies, but it is a very fun ride.  While this movie will never reach the ""classic"" status that I feel the first one will, this is a very enjoyable movie and is a fitting end to the trilogy.

Call it what you want, but consider the conceptual continuity of these three movies.  1985 remained the ""present"" for all the films, right?  Even this one and BTTF3, made some years later, preserved 1985 as the fulcrum.  Quick quiz:  of all the eras depicted, which one was the best:  1885, 1955, 1985 or 2015?  Tough question, given that there were at least three distinct 1985s, etc.But look:  even the ""best"" 1985 was, in significant ways, not as good as 2015.  Our predicates, then, are that obstacles can be overcome, the past reinvented as needed, and, most importantly, ""the future is what you make it.""I've found no clearer demonstration of a fundamentally optimistic philosophy in any movie I ever saw.  Even though these films intentionally avoid sentimentality (all right, you could argue that), they express a relentless optimism that enables characters and, derivately, ourselves, to take charge of our situations, invent new solutions and fulfill Doc Brown's mandate.  Make mistakes, learn from them, experiment, and then move forward.  The past does not have to trap you;  it is only a platform for a better future.You cannot leave the movies without feeling more empowered about your own life.

Marty McFly is stuck in 1955 after the DeLorean is struck by lightning. Marty and a younger version of Doc Brown restore the DeLorean after they find it in a cave. When Marty finds out that Doc Brown was killed in 1885, Marty travels to that time period to take Doc home. In 1885, Doc Brown falls in love with a lovely, educated schoolteacher, Clara Clayton(Mary Steenburgen). Marty, Doc Brown, and Clara are bullied by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson). Marty has to stop Buford Tannen from killing Doc and they have to return to 1985. Back to the Future Part III cuts back on technology and puts more of its focus on plot and character. There's an homage to Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as the camera films Hill Valley, California in the year 1885. Back to the Future Part III was filmed in Jamestown, CA and I saw it on a field trip in grade school. The town was destroyed by fire. Alan Silvestri is back and he adds a ""Western"" flavor to the music score. A scene where Buford Tannen kills Marshall Strickland(James Tolkan) in cold blood was deleted from the film. ZZ Top makes a cameo in the film and they perform the theme song. Sexy Mary Steenburgen is quite good as Clara. She also played Clara Clayton on the Back to the Future animated series.

After burning the book Biff used to tamper with time, Doc was struck by lightning and sent back 70 years, 1885. Marty learns this when he receives a letter from him that has been saved that many years. So the Doc of the past once again helps Marty with his problems by finding the DeLorean which has been sitting in a cave for several decades and fixes it up to run again. They look up information learning Doc is killed by Bufford, ancestor of Biff Tannon. So Marty knows he has to stop this by going back in time to the Wild West. Now things are really complicated this time when the car loses fuel and can not run which it must in order to take them back. But they find a solution to their problem by learning a train can push it up to the distance required to time travel. But first they have to prevent Doc's death by conflicting with Bufford Tannon. Not only that, Doc is distracted by a woman named Clara Clayton. All this makes it so difficult for Marty and Doc that they wonder if they will ever get back to the year, 1985- 100 years later.",3,Conclusion using the Wild West,1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,1086,"['Marty', 'McFly', 'now', 'stranded', '1955', 'burning', 'book', 'Biff', 'used', 'tamper', 'time', 'Doc', 'was', 'struck', 'lightning', 'sent', 'back', '70', 'years', '1885', 'Marty', 'when', 'letter', 'been', 'saved', 'many', 'years', 'Doc', 'past', 'once', 'again', 'Marty', 'problems', 'finding', 'DeLorean', 'been', 'sitting', 'cave', 'several', 'decades', 'fixes', 'up', 'run', 'again', 'look', 'up', 'information', 'learning', 'Doc', 'killed', 'Bufford', 'ancestor', 'Biff', 'Tannon', 'So', 'Marty', 'stop', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'Wild', 'West', 'Now', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'complicated', 'time', 'when', 'car', 'fuel', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'must', 'order', 'take', 'back', 'find', 'solution', 'problem', 'learning', 'train', 'can', 'push', 'up', 'distance', 'required', 'time', 'travel', 'first', 'have', 'prevent', 'Doc', 'death', 'conflicting', 'Bufford', 'Tannon', 'Not', 'only', 'Doc', 'distracted', 'woman', 'named', 'Clara', 'Clayton', 'so', 'difficult', 'Marty', 'Doc', 'wonder', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'back', 'year', '1985-', '100', 'years', 'later']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 1]","As soon as Marty and Doc get ready to go back to 1985 from 1955, the Delorean is hit with a lightning bolt and sends Doc somewhere in time. As Marty is standing there in 1955, confused on what to do, a mailman comes up to him, handing him a letter addressed to him, from 1885, from Doc. The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, the relative of Biff.While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like ""Good looking guy"", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future.

But what I have to say is... this movie is definately my least favorite of the trilogy and you know, don't get me wrong it's a good movie but some of it's lacking. The plot involves Marty stuck in 1955 right after the Delorian was struck by lighting with Doc inside, sending him to 1885. So Marty gets the 1955 Doc to find another Delorian that 1885 Doc put in a mining cave in the outskirts of Hill Valley. When they find the Delorian they soon find out that Doc gets shot in 1885 by a bounty hunter. So now Marty has to go to 1885 to save Doc and face off with the bounty hunter himself. When Marty travels to the old west, the Delorian's fuel tank gets damaged so it can't get up to 88 miles by itself, so now he's stuck in 1885 with Doc, who finds true love with a person named Clara. That's one thing I never liked about this movie, its nice he found somebody but it does that thing that I hate, it happens in every romance movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is depressed, boy gets girl in end. It kind of slows the movie down. And there isn't as much time travel or paradox in this movie which is what made the other two movies so great. But there are some funny moments and the interaction scenes with Doc and Marty are nice. And the train scene and the showdown scene are both great, giving nice little tributes to Clint Eastwood, and the music score is still awesome. So overall it's a good movie but it's a big step below the first two.

In  this version, Doc's gotten stuck in the past and tells Marty to leave him  alone - he's content to be inventing things back in the past, though he  must find it frustrating to invent things he can't show anyone - his rule  has always been that when you time-travel, you mustn't do anything to  change the future.Marty ends up back in the wild west in the Delorean,  the very time-machine that needs plutonium to get it moving fast enough to  warp into another time. When he lands, he manages to gouge a hole in the  fuel tank, and eventually he realizes he's not going to find much plutonium  in the Old West.Oh, no!  Are they stuck in the past forever? Not very  likely, as Doc figures out how he can get them back to the future.It is  also frustrating for those of us who enjoy these movies that that some are  in DVD, some in VHS, and the first is in limbo.  However, eventually  they'll all be out in DVD.For now, I ordered all three in VHS format  recently 'somewhere' - the first remains the best and our favorite, but you  really have to have them all if you're going to fully enjoy them.These  movies are GREAT for the whole family to watch - we did these as a marathon  one week-end, and was it fun.  The first one is still the favorite, but  that's because it lays the groundwork for this one and the next.Just a  little heads up for parents of young kids -I was surprised in watching this  for the umpteenth time, but with a mom's eye and ear, to hear several  really unnecessary cusswords scattered throughout all three movies. Oh,  nothing to bad, but they could have been left out entirely.  My 8-year  old's eyes popped open - he knows that swear words are kind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry.For those who don't have  kids and think I'm being too prissy, just wait til ya have kids of your  own!",3,"Not the best of the trio, but you still gotta have it!",960854400,"06 13, 2000",2000,2271,"[""n't"", 'best', 'love', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Steenberger', 'had', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'not', 'enough', 'worry', 'about.The', 'Old', 'West', 'scenes', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'kid', 'who', 'trains', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'version', 'Doc', 'gotten', 'stuck', 'past', 'Marty', 'leave', 'alone', 'content', 'be', 'inventing', 'things', 'back', 'past', 'must', 'find', 'frustrating', 'invent', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'anyone', 'rule', 'always', 'been', 'when', 'time-travel', 'must', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'change', 'future.Marty', 'up', 'back', 'wild', 'west', 'Delorean', 'very', 'time-machine', 'plutonium', 'get', 'moving', 'fast', 'enough', 'warp', 'time', 'When', 'gouge', 'hole', 'fuel', 'tank', 'eventually', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'much', 'plutonium', 'Old', 'West.Oh', 'Are', 'stuck', 'past', 'forever', 'Not', 'very', 'likely', 'Doc', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'future.It', 'also', 'frustrating', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'first', 'limbo', 'However', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'be', 'out', 'DVD.For', 'now', 'ordered', 'three', 'VHS', 'format', 'recently', ""'somewhere"", 'first', 'best', 'favorite', 'really', 'have', 'have', ""'re"", 'going', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'them.These', 'movies', 'are', 'GREAT', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'did', 'marathon', 'one', 'week-end', 'was', 'fun', 'first', 'one', 'still', 'favorite', 'groundwork', 'one', 'next.Just', 'little', 'up', 'parents', 'young', 'kids', '-I', 'was', 'surprised', 'watching', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'mom', 'eye', 'ear', 'hear', 'several', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'cusswords', 'scattered', 'three', 'movies', 'Oh', 'nothing', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', '8-year', 'old', 'eyes', 'popped', 'open', 'swear', 'words', 'are', 'kind', 'lazy', 'person', 'short', 'cut', 'saying', 'what', 'want', 'usually', 'used', 'low', 'vocabulary', 'weak', 'creative', 'expression', 'just', 'frowned', 'little', 'scratched', 'heads', 'decided', 'not', 'worry.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'prissy', 'just', 'wait', 'til', 'ya', 'have', 'kids', 'own']",Back to the Future Part III VHS

The film begins right after the events in the second film which found Marty and Doc Brown travelling from the future, to a sinister 1985, to the wholesome 1955 to save the space time continuum.  Even with this fun and fast paced adventure, &quot;Part II&quot; was essentially a downer.  &quot;Part III&quot; lightens things up considerably.Marty is now stranded (again!) in 1955, and his friend Doc Brown has been stranded in 1885.  Disregarding Doc's warning about any more tampering with the space time continuum, Marty risks yet another time travel trip only this time to 1885 to rescue his friend Doc Brown.The story arc here is almost identical to the first film in that Marty is stranded again, is trying to get home and devises a thrillingly complicated action sequence to get back to 1985.  As the story centers on only one era; the old west, the film has a great deal of fun focusing on eccentric cowboys, gunfights and train wrecks.Also in the spirit of the first film, there is a sweet romance only this time it's with the most unlikely &quot;BTTF&quot; character, Doc Brown himself.  Doc falls in love with a charming school teacher and is torn as he ponders whether he should stay in the old west with is true love or go back to the future.  In the first and even second film, Doc spent a great deal of time telling Marty he shouldn't take chances.  This time it's Marty telling Doc to grow up and make smart decisions but Doc can't help himself because he's in love.  It's a charming development.  &quot;Part III&quot; is funny, sweet and has none of the negative traits of the disappointing &quot;Part II&quot;.  While not as great as the first classic film, &quot;Part III&quot; delivers a grand entertainment full of good cheer and warmth.

266358,AP3B615GM191G,630179513X,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The first two films in the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy explore the concept of time like never before.  Viewers are taken to two different versions of 1985, twice propelled back to 1955, and even catapulted into 2015 for a short time.  The character continuity is incredible, the acting is inspired, and so many different genres are incorporated that the films are nearly rendered perfectly genre-less.  Obviously, it would be tough to beat the energy of those two incredible films, and (while this film gives a valiant effort) it just doesn't quite make it.Basically, the plot of BTTF 3 is set in the Old West (1885, to be exact), where Doc Brown was transported to at the end of the second film.  Ignoring the Doc's instructions, young Marty McFly instead repairs the time machine and goes back to bring Doc back home.  The three obstacles in his way: Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (the most hated gunslinger in the West), Clara (Doc's new love), and an empty tank of gas in the DeLorean.Though this movie won't leave you feeling utterly disappointed or anything like that, as it has its moments of greatness, it just falls a bit short of the magic created by the first two efforts.  Perhaps the biggest culprit is the flatness of the jokes that were funny in parts one and two, like the ""wake up"" scene and the Tannen family ""manure curse"", but became somewhat stale the third time around.Another shortcoming, oddly enough, was the fact that the film has more to do with character-development than its two previous successors.  The Marty-Doc friendship is on center stage, while Doc's new-found infatuation with Clara is a major part of the storyline.  While usually that kind of character-building is essentially in films, it is kind of wasted in this case, as fans knew the end of the trilogy was at hand and thus the relationships would go no further.However, though I have touched on a few of the reasons why this film doesn't match the sheer brilliance of the first two, please do not hesitate to watch it and complete the most inventive film trilogy in history.  It is not a dud by any means, and certain viewers may even find it more enjoyable than ""Part Two"", as it isn't as complicated and the jokes are a bit more obvious.",4,"A Bit Flat, But Still A Good Ending To A Masterpiece Trilogy",1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,2229,"['first', 'two', 'films', 'Back', 'Future', 'trilogy', 'explore', 'concept', 'time', 'never', 'before', 'Viewers', 'are', 'taken', 'two', 'different', 'versions', '1985', 'twice', 'propelled', 'back', '1955', 'even', 'catapulted', '2015', 'short', 'time', 'character', 'continuity', 'incredible', 'acting', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'genres', 'are', 'incorporated', 'films', 'are', 'nearly', 'rendered', 'perfectly', 'genre-less', 'Obviously', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'beat', 'energy', 'two', 'incredible', 'films', 'film', 'valiant', 'effort', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'it.Basically', 'plot', 'BTTF', '3', 'set', 'Old', 'West', '1885', 'be', 'exact', 'where', 'Doc', 'Brown', 'was', 'transported', 'end', 'second', 'film', 'Ignoring', 'Doc', 'instructions', 'young', 'Marty', 'McFly', 'instead', 'time', 'machine', 'back', 'bring', 'Doc', 'back', 'home', 'three', 'obstacles', 'way', 'Buford', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Tannen', 'most', 'hated', 'gunslinger', 'West', 'Clara', 'Doc', 'new', 'love', 'empty', 'tank', 'gas', 'DeLorean.Though', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'anything', 'moments', 'greatness', 'just', 'bit', 'short', 'magic', 'created', 'first', 'two', 'efforts', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'culprit', 'flatness', 'jokes', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'wake', 'up', 'scene', 'Tannen', 'family', 'manure', 'curse', 'became', 'somewhat', 'stale', 'third', 'time', 'shortcoming', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'do', 'character-development', 'two', 'previous', 'successors', 'Marty-Doc', 'friendship', 'center', 'stage', 'Doc', 'new-found', 'infatuation', 'Clara', 'major', 'part', 'storyline', 'usually', 'kind', 'character-building', 'essentially', 'films', 'kind', 'wasted', 'case', 'fans', 'knew', 'end', 'trilogy', 'was', 'hand', 'thus', 'relationships', 'would', 'go', 'further.However', 'have', 'touched', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', ""n't"", 'match', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'first', 'two', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'watch', 'complete', 'most', 'inventive', 'film', 'trilogy', 'history', 'not', 'dud', 'means', 'certain', 'viewers', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Part', 'Two', ""n't"", 'as', 'complicated', 'jokes', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'obvious']",Back to the Future Part III VHS
