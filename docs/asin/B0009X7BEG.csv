It may not have had a long run, but like Buffalo Bill (also coming on DVD soon), the talented cast went on to bigger and better things.  That's My Mama should have had a longer run.  ABC (who doesn't learn from their mistakes) took the show in it's second season, new producers came in and made the show, quite frankly a little depressing.  The fun time in the barber shop was over and the recession was on.  That coupled with cast changes and a weak lead in show, caused this should have been classic to expire on Xmas Eve 1975.  A good show that should have had a four or five year run.  ABC would make similar mistakes with Mork and Mindy a few years later with similar results.  I am glad to see it back again and I have ordered both seasons.

916098,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0009X7BEG,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[1, 1]","Editing aside, I enjoy this set. Would have liked to see some commentary and special features, but that's minor.I recall watching this when I was about 10 years old (1974-75) during it's initial run on ABC-TV. Much of the humor went over my head, as did most adult-oriented shows in those days, but I liked Ted Lange as Junior (OOOO-WEEEE!!!) and the FUNKIEST theme song to do a two-step to this side of the Godfather of Soul.In watching this set today, I see why I didn't get it the first time. Bascially, the show dealt mostly with adult relationships and con schemes. But what makes the show work are a number of factors; clever writing, a pleasant and likeable cast, and good ensemble character-based comedy. Oddly enough, as was the case with WHAT'S HAPPENING a few years later, the cast's race is incidental and rarely mentioned.Theodore Wilson, a familiar face from Black-oriented movies and TV shows of the 70s, plays Earl The Mailman to good effect. He originally appears as a fake lawyer in the pilot episode and another actor (less effectvely, as we see) originally played this character. Clifton Davis has the right amount of charisma and likeability to play Cliff the barber, around whom these episodes revolve, and Theresa Merritt is suberb as the title character whose wisdom (usually) saves the day in these tales. I also liked the guy who played Leonard the Nerd, Cliff's insufferable but amusing brother-in law. Also, Look for Belinda Tolbert (Jenny from the Jeffersons) as one of Cliff's many girlfriends in one story as well as Amanda Randolph & Ernestine Wade (from the Amos & Andy comedies) in some others. BTW, Wildcat is also played by Amos & Andy alum Jester Hairston who in turn would later rejoin Clifton Davis in ""Amen."" (funny how these shows cross-pollinate). He is particularly effective in the suprise ending to the tale of Cliff's father's alleged affair.This show didn't get it's due perhaps because of the glut of Black TV Comeides in those days (Sanford & Son, Good Times, The Jeffersons, the long forgotten Tenafly, Love Thy Neighbor, etc). But the DVD age should rescue this from its undeserved obscurity. This is a good show with a heart.

Now while I have only seen the syndicated episodes I still prefer to have the original episodes as the aired in the first place.
