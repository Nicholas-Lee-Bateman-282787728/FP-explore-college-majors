1463856,A3825QQVSCUZ9A,B005KLOPLO,Greg S,"[0, 0]","This documentary is much better than I expected. The scientific step by step approach is accurate and meaningful, and the blu-ray images of the planets, moons & asteroids is breathtaking.The one item they never address is the importance of a planetary molten core (and therefore magnetic shield). A magnetic shield protects a planet from the solar wind and allows it to maintain an atmosphere along with the protection from cosmic rays that an atmosphere provides. That's an important topic to address when discussing Mars for example (no molten core, no shield).But that can be forgiven as everything else is as top notch as it gets. This is easily one of the best astronomy docs in my collection. Highly recommended for those interested in a truly scientific approach to this subject, and for those who like to see the latest imagery of the space probes.Note: there are no Discovery Channel like speculative representations of extra-terrestrial macrobiotic life forms that look like 'platypus/vacuum cleaner' hybrids. :)",5,Much better than expected,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1022,"['documentary', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'scientific', 'step', 'step', 'approach', 'accurate', 'meaningful', 'blu-ray', 'images', 'planets', 'moons', 'asteroids', 'breathtaking.The', 'one', 'item', 'never', 'address', 'importance', 'planetary', 'molten', 'core', 'therefore', 'magnetic', 'shield', 'magnetic', 'shield', 'planet', 'solar', 'wind', 'maintain', 'atmosphere', 'protection', 'cosmic', 'rays', 'atmosphere', 'important', 'topic', 'address', 'when', 'discussing', 'Mars', 'example', 'molten', 'core', 'shield', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'everything', 'else', 'top', 'notch', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'astronomy', 'docs', 'collection', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'interested', 'truly', 'scientific', 'approach', 'subject', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'latest', 'imagery', 'space', 'probes.Note', 'are', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'speculative', 'representations', 'extra-terrestrial', 'macrobiotic', 'life', 'forms', 'look', ""'platypus/vacuum"", 'cleaner', 'hybrids']",N/A

1463858,ACNUC5ZBYK9OC,B005KLOPLO,Richard Middleton,"[0, 0]","It seems almost inevitable, statistically, that somewhere in the universe there will be conditions that allow organisms to develop which we would recognize as living.  However, the chances of these life forms being able to communicate with us across space and time, or of us discovering their planets at a time when they were are at a stage of evolution when we could interact, seem vanishingly small.  This excellent Nova production makes this clear, and gives us a far better understanding of where we stand in relation to the universe.After watching the programs on PBS, I first bought this as a DVD,  I thought it was a brilliant narrative (with stupendous graphics), and made the mistake of telling a friend about it,;  that was the last I saw of the DVD!
