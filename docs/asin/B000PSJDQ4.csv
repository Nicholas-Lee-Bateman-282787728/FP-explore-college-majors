Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet. I just read a new bio of Ahmet and this makes the perfect supplement.

1072819,A2L36PB05OIX3P,B000PSJDQ4,"C. Barr ""Craig  Barr""","[0, 0]","I actually found this film in the video rack at a dollar store. It sat unopened for a few months while I was busy filming and studying films that I needed to view. I have been aware of Ahmet Ertegun for some time but this documentary is a mind blower. I wish that Capricorn records and Duane Allman's session work were included. The crisis that led to (Atlantic) being sold to Warner Brothers in 1967 is described within this film. Warner Brothers was one of the ""Big Five"" in film since 1915 so Atlantic would have probably gone under if the move was not made. The mission of Atlantic records is described in detail as the bold moves that were made. The film touches on the payola scam which was very open before the 1960's, now it is sublimated within ""New Artist Fee's"". Unfortunately for a small label like Atlantic it had to battle against music labels that were part the Film industry since the inception of motion pictures. Bottom line is that even if this is a promotional propaganda film as some reviewers believe, it stands on it's own legs as an excellent documentary. I also feel that the inclusion of current film footage such as ""Ray"" which is a Universal picture release discredits this being a promo piece. Either way it is an excellent documentation of the history of Atlantic Records.

1072821,ASIEGG17K1UID,B000PSJDQ4,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[0, 0]","I would have given this 5 Stars, as I believe Atlantic Records was that great of a label. Growing up in the 60s, those red and black Atlantic 45 RPM labels made me buy the single without knowing or having heard the single just by the sheer fact if it was on Atlantic, it was bound to be great.  So, one would think, I should give a 5 Star review.  Here is why I did not, it is for what it is missing.  1. This documentary praises Ahmet a bit too much.  While he was essential and the driving force behind the label, it is too much of a love fest.  If I wanted to hear and see a love fest; I would hear Clive Davis talk about himself and spin how he was the greatest thing to music that ever happened. 2. It completely does not talk about Atlantic Jazz.  Atlantic was started as a Jazz label, and launched some major careers in the early 50s...Coltrane, Coleman, Hancock, Davis, etc.  None of this is mentioned or it is glossed over so quickly, you can not even hit pause to find it. 3. The ""dark side"" of Atlantic.  Pure and simple, they screwed Stax Records of all its masters with its distribution deal. Jerry Wexler always claims he and Ahmet knew nothing about it, and that the attorney's did that.  And Jim Stewart (Stax) states he never read the fine print.  Not sure who to blame, but is a sad commentary and a rather dark blemish on what was considered to be one of the GREAT LABELS ever. (Get ""Respect Yourself...the Stax Records Story"" for those details).Based on these three MAJOR omissions to the documentary I must give it 4 Stars.  The remaining is a fascinating tail of a great label and its continued dominance to this day.",4,GREAT...BUT,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,1639,"['would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'Stars', 'believe', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'was', 'great', 'label', 'Growing', 'up', '60s', 'red', 'black', 'Atlantic', '45', 'RPM', 'labels', 'made', 'buy', 'single', 'knowing', 'having', 'heard', 'single', 'just', 'sheer', 'fact', 'was', 'Atlantic', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'great', 'So', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'should', 'give', '5', 'Star', 'review', 'Here', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'what', 'missing', '1', 'documentary', 'praises', 'Ahmet', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'essential', 'driving', 'force', 'label', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'fest', 'wanted', 'hear', 'see', 'love', 'fest', 'would', 'hear', 'Clive', 'Davis', 'talk', 'spin', 'how', 'was', 'greatest', 'thing', 'music', 'ever', 'happened', '2', 'completely', 'not', 'talk', 'Atlantic', 'Jazz', 'Atlantic', 'was', 'started', 'Jazz', 'label', 'launched', 'major', 'careers', 'early', '50s', 'Coltrane', 'Coleman', 'Hancock', 'Davis', 'etc', 'None', 'mentioned', 'glossed', 'so', 'quickly', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'hit', 'pause', 'find', '3', 'dark', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'Pure', 'simple', 'screwed', 'Stax', 'Records', 'masters', 'distribution', 'deal', 'Jerry', 'Wexler', 'always', 'Ahmet', 'knew', 'nothing', 'attorney', 'did', 'Jim', 'Stewart', 'Stax', 'never', 'read', 'fine', 'print', 'Not', 'sure', 'who', 'blame', 'sad', 'commentary', 'rather', 'dark', 'blemish', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'GREAT', 'LABELS', 'ever', 'Get', 'Respect', 'Stax', 'Records', 'Story', 'details', '.Based', 'three', 'MAJOR', 'omissions', 'documentary', 'must', 'give', '4', 'Stars', 'remaining', 'fascinating', 'tail', 'great', 'label', 'continued', 'dominance', 'day']",Atlantic Records: The House That Ahmet Built

In 1947 financed with a $10,000 loan from his dentist, Ahmet Ertegun, an immigrant of Turkish descent, and his friend Herb Abramson founded Atlantic records.  Ahmet's goal was to record the rich variety of black music that was just bubbling to the surface in those halcyon days.  Ahmed Ertegun was a connossuer of this music and he firmly believed that he was the guy to introduce it to general audiences.  ""Atlantic Records 60:  The House That Ahmet Built"" tells the remarkable story of Atlantic Records and the man who founded it and led it for nearly six decades.Now back in the late 1940's there were tons of independent labels operating in the U.S.  Many were fly by night operations that never amounted to much of anything while others managed to produce a few hits before either being bought out or folding altogether  What  the people at Atlantic records were able to achieve was clearly the exception to the rule and the man who made all the difference was Ahmet Ertegun.  Ahmet knew talent when he saw it and consequently over the years he managed to surround himself with an extremely gifted team that helped him to grow the label.  Among those in the inner circle at Atlantic  was Ahmet's brother Nesuhi Ertegun who handled the jazz division in the early days of the label and Jerry Wexler who would play a major role in securing talent for the label for decades.  Talented engineer Tom Dowd also came aboard early on and was responsible for producing some of the greatest jazz and r & b sides ever made.And I would be remiss if I failed to mention the legendary songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who would pen more than 150 hit records over these years, most of them at Atlantic. The roster of artists who recorded for Atlantic over the years reads like a who's who of popular music.  From Ruth Brown, The Clovers and Ray Charles in the label's earliest days to the likes of Bobby Darin, Sonny and Cher, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Phil Collins and Bette Midler, Atlantic records clearly had it's finger on the pulse of what audiences wanted to hear.""Atlantic Records 60:  The House That Ahmet Built"" chronicles the remarkable story of this venerable label.  Unfortunately, we lost Ahmet Ertegun back in 2006.  When you discover how he died you will think it quite appropriate indeed.  For Ahmet Ertegun was able to spend his entire adult life doing what he loved best.  It is a compelling story.

I met Ahmet back in 1976 when he was helping Mic Jagger form his own label and they were recording my friend, bluesman Luther Allison.  I recently saw Ahmet again at the Jazz Musuem of Harlem promoting the music he loved best, jazz.  Even in his last years ,he never stopped tirelessly pushing jazz and black music in general.  He was always headed to somewhere to try to keep the music and the legacy alive.I say part of the real story, because I know many of the artists that were with Atlantic and most were unhappy about the way they were treated there.  Ruth Brown, who helped build Atlantic, had to secure work as a domestic to survive... whereas Mic Jagger has never looked back.This documentary is only deals with the Ready for Prime Time story of what Atlantic did.  There were decisions that affected a lot of people involved with Atlantic, that were unfavorable to them.  Why do you think Ray Charles left? As you watch the movie , you have to read between the lines.Ahmet confronted racism, but sometimes he was also a part of it.  The needs of the business often overshadowed what he knew was right. Still what he did was invaluable to music , as we know it in America.He says in the film that there are only two types of music in America, 'there is black music and then there are those who imitate black music'... a very profound, sad and true statement that most do not want to recognize or accept.So this movie is one slice of the story.  Out of the light of the cameras , you will hear a much different one.. as I have.It is still worth having because it is a major part the history of music in this country.  I also pre-ordered a copy and now I can enjoy it whenever I like.  I can use it to educate kids that are too young to remember it as I did.  I grew up with Atlantic.  One of my first 45-rpm records was Aretha singing ""Respect"".  But I had heard the Alantic artists all thru my childhood.Ahmet Artegun is an American hero.  He gave the world music that we still enjoy today. The music he recorded has influenced every artist since the label was created.  This film should be viewed by any serious student of American music or of American history. The music reflected the times and the changes in our culture.  It shows the good and the bad, if you read between the lines.Who will take up the cause now that Ahmet is gone?  Who will fight to see that Americans greatest and only art form, black music, is not forgotten.

I worked at Atlantic for several years and can attest that this documentary delivers an informative survey of the man and the label (though i could argue about certain artist omissions), which produced so much great music covering every genre.  If you're a serious pop/rock/R&B;/jazz fan, you really owe it to yourself to see this, and if you want to learn more about Mr. Ertegun and Atlantic, i HIGHLY recommend the book he wrote several years ago, ""What'd I Say"", which has hundreds of stunning photos and commentary from him and the others (artists and executives) who made it all happen at Atlantic (the book is pricey, but totally worth the money - product link is below)What'd I Say: The Atlantic Story",5,Great program - read his excellent book too,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,830,"['program', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'tons', 'great', 'footage', 'artists', 'interviews', 'hilarious', 'anecdotes', 'worked', 'Atlantic', 'several', 'years', 'can', 'attest', 'documentary', 'delivers', 'informative', 'survey', 'man', 'label', 'i', 'could', 'argue', 'certain', 'artist', 'omissions', 'produced', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'music', 'covering', 'genre', ""'re"", 'serious', 'pop/rock/R', 'B', '/jazz', 'fan', 'really', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Ertegun', 'Atlantic', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'book', 'wrote', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'What', ""'d"", 'Say', 'hundreds', 'stunning', 'photos', 'commentary', 'others', 'artists', 'executives', 'who', 'made', 'happen', 'Atlantic', 'book', 'pricey', 'totally', 'worth', 'money', 'product', 'link', 'What', ""'d"", 'Say', 'Atlantic', 'Story']",Atlantic Records: The House That Ahmet Built
