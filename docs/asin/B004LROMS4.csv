Dinosaurs don't look too CGI or too animated, and that is though a little but improvement from other movies about these ''reptiles''.This movie shows a good insight on what could happen if we had a time machine to our past.In 2039 humans destroyed Earth's ecology which made it nearly impossible for humans to survive.A time machine was founded that allowed some of the humans to travel 85 millions of years in the past to a place called Terra Nova.A place and time that supposed to be a second chance for humans, was in the end targeted by greedy people.Humans once again endangered our planet and it's inhabitants.What will happen, is for you to find out.Buy these series.As for me, I'm once again left with a feeling that our species should be renamed to Homo Stupendous Sapiens.",4,"No surprises here, we will be one step away from destroying our past in Terra Nova",1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,884,"['are', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'series', 'attention', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'plot', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'Dinosaurs', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'CGI', 'too', 'animated', 'little', 'improvement', 'other', 'movies', 'reptiles', '.This', 'movie', 'good', 'insight', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'had', 'time', 'machine', 'past.In', '2039', 'humans', 'destroyed', 'Earth', 'ecology', 'made', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'humans', 'survive.A', 'time', 'machine', 'was', 'founded', 'allowed', 'humans', 'travel', '85', 'millions', 'years', 'past', 'place', 'called', 'Terra', 'Nova.A', 'place', 'time', 'supposed', 'be', 'second', 'chance', 'humans', 'was', 'end', 'targeted', 'greedy', 'people.Humans', 'once', 'again', 'endangered', 'planet', 'inhabitants.What', 'will', 'happen', 'find', 'out.Buy', 'series.As', ""'m"", 'once', 'again', 'left', 'feeling', 'species', 'should', 'be', 'renamed', 'Homo', 'Stupendous', 'Sapiens']",Terra Nova

1413223,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B004LROMS4,A. Burchfield,"[1, 2]","Since it took a couple of years to even get on TV after it was announced I wasn't very surprised to see Terra Nova fail. The TV critics seemed to hate it, I remember one particularly vicious review in TIME magazine, but I didn't think it was all that bad myself.I loved the general look of the story but always thought the settlement looked like a resort dressed up to look like a small town, never quite worked for me. The plot line in general was weak in that a dying planet sends 100's of people through a tme rift (didn't  get much of an explanation for the discovery of this thing, thought the writers did OK for most of the rest of the ""science"") and there didn't seem to be much of an indication of qualification for making the trip. I would have liked to see some evidence,beyond an apple orchard, of anything to maintain/  build a new civilization ( wasn't it the bar keeper who had the only tech to repair/ replace damaged microchips?), that was about the least plausible part of the storyline.Many of the stories were standard Cop/family plots, a lot of that already on TV so that didn't help Terra Nova. The Dinosaurs mostly looked pretty good, much better than SyFy does- the worst bit of that when the little girl gives the "" baby"" back to it's mother. The casting wasn't too bad, Stephen Lang and Shelly Conn were best, ( the two girls were at least vaguely similar to her in coloring, the son didn't look like anybody).The expense of producing a series like this may have had as much as anything to do with its cancellation. The end of season cliff hanger indicated a storyline that could only get more expensive. With presumably weak ratings Terra Nova had no chance.Like others I would like to see some sort of conclusion but don't see a movie or miniseries in the future due to those expenses. Fan fiction to the rescue?At least one review complained about picture quality, I certainly hope that was their player and not the DVD, as the only way to get the show in HD (I've been told it looked great) is by download from Amazon or Apple, my data plan won't allow for that much online time. At least we appear to get a few extras, A&A; don't offer that.9/23/12 additionI've tried a few episodes out, really clear image, and I've found, for me at least, a bug in the extended version of the season finale. Pausing and/ or using &lt; or > and then play at the point where the suicide bomber blows up at the portal and then again when Taylor tells Maddy Shannon's soldier boyfriend to find that cargo container will cause my 2005 Sony DVD player to lock up. No other episode does that (and that episode is fine if I  don't touch the remote), no other DVD I've ever had does it either. My 2007 Philips has no problems, my brothers XBox is fine too. The only way I've found out of the freeze is just to hit stop and start over, I don't have nerve enough to see just how many spots I have this bug, most of the episode is bug free, I think.",3,"Not surprised to see it go, will miss it anyway",1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,2952,"['took', 'couple', 'years', 'even', 'get', 'TV', 'was', 'announced', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'surprised', 'see', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'fail', 'TV', 'critics', 'seemed', 'hate', 'remember', 'one', 'particularly', 'vicious', 'review', 'TIME', 'magazine', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'myself.I', 'loved', 'general', 'look', 'story', 'always', 'thought', 'settlement', 'looked', 'resort', 'dressed', 'up', 'look', 'small', 'town', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'plot', 'line', 'general', 'was', 'weak', 'dying', 'planet', '100', 'people', 'tme', 'rift', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'explanation', 'discovery', 'thing', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'OK', 'most', 'rest', 'science', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'indication', 'qualification', 'making', 'trip', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'evidence', 'apple', 'orchard', 'anything', 'maintain/', 'build', 'new', 'civilization', 'was', ""n't"", 'bar', 'keeper', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'tech', 'repair/', 'replace', 'damaged', 'microchips', 'was', 'least', 'plausible', 'part', 'storyline.Many', 'stories', 'were', 'standard', 'Cop/family', 'plots', 'lot', 'already', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'Dinosaurs', 'mostly', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'SyFy', 'does-', 'worst', 'bit', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'baby', 'back', 'mother', 'casting', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Shelly', 'Conn', 'were', 'best', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'least', 'vaguely', 'similar', 'coloring', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anybody', 'expense', 'producing', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'do', 'cancellation', 'end', 'season', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'indicated', 'storyline', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'expensive', 'presumably', 'weak', 'ratings', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'had', 'chance.Like', 'others', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'miniseries', 'future', 'due', 'expenses', 'Fan', 'fiction', 'rescue', 'least', 'one', 'review', 'complained', 'picture', 'quality', 'certainly', 'hope', 'was', 'player', 'not', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'show', 'HD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'looked', 'great', 'download', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'data', 'plan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'much', 'online', 'time', 'least', 'appear', 'get', 'few', 'extras', 'A', 'A', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'that.9/23/12', 'additionI', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'few', 'episodes', 'out', 'really', 'clear', 'image', ""'ve"", 'found', 'least', 'bug', 'extended', 'version', 'season', 'finale', 'Pausing', 'and/', 'using', 'lt', '>', 'then', 'play', 'point', 'where', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'up', 'portal', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'Taylor', 'Maddy', 'Shannon', 'soldier', 'boyfriend', 'find', 'cargo', 'container', 'will', 'cause', '2005', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'lock', 'up', 'other', 'episode', 'episode', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'remote', 'other', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'either', '2007', 'Philips', 'problems', 'brothers', 'XBox', 'fine', 'too', 'only', 'way', ""'ve"", 'found', 'freeze', 'just', 'hit', 'stop', 'start', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'nerve', 'enough', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'spots', 'have', 'bug', 'most', 'episode', 'bug', 'free', 'think']",Terra Nova

I came across Terra Nova, and thought, hm...I'll give it a look.The premise is pretty much completely unbelievable...well, partially unbelievable.  That is, by 2149 humanity had pretty much trashed the earth by overexploitation of natural resources - this part is believable enough.  Air quality had bottomed out, most people suffered with a variety of environmental illnesses and dilemmas, but the ultra rich were able to live in domed communities with good air, etc.In order to deal with Earth's overpopulation problem, families were limited to only two children each, and violations resulted in sever consequences.  Unexpectedly, a portal was discovered/opened to Earth of about 84 million years BC.  Yep, dinosaurs and all.Some pioneers/colonists went through the portal and established a colony called ""Terra Nova"" (new earth).  These colonists included military personnel needed to deal with natural threats of the day together with people of special talents and abilities mixed with people who got to go back by winning a lottery to go to terra nova.After watching a couple of episodes I was impressed enough to keep watching.  The most recognizable character is Stephen Lang, who plays a role similar to the one he played in the blockbuster movie ""Avatar"".  He is the leader of Terra Nova.I found some of the episodes to be contrived, but there were enough engaging and creative story lines that I kept watching until I'd finished all 13 episodes that were produced.  I have to say that I am sad that the series was not continued.This show has enough action and plot twists and development to keep my attention.  At the same time, I had no reservations watching this show with the family.  Of course, this kind of story line is not the top pick of everyone, but I enjoyed it.  it is also a family-friendly show that includes occasional interactions with dinosaurs.  Let's face it, just about everyone likes dinosaurs.All in all, I give this show 4 strong stars.",4,"Surprisingly watchable, even good",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2115,"['was', 'poking', 'around', 'one', 'evening', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'something', 'engaging', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'invest', 'lot', 'brain', 'cells', 'came', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'thought', 'hm', ""'ll"", 'give', 'look.The', 'premise', 'pretty', 'much', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'well', 'partially', 'unbelievable', '2149', 'humanity', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'trashed', 'earth', 'overexploitation', 'natural', 'resources', 'part', 'believable', 'enough', 'Air', 'quality', 'had', 'bottomed', 'out', 'most', 'people', 'suffered', 'variety', 'environmental', 'illnesses', 'dilemmas', 'ultra', 'rich', 'were', 'able', 'live', 'domed', 'communities', 'good', 'air', 'etc.In', 'order', 'deal', 'Earth', 'overpopulation', 'problem', 'families', 'were', 'limited', 'only', 'two', 'children', 'violations', 'resulted', 'sever', 'consequences', 'Unexpectedly', 'portal', 'was', 'discovered/opened', 'Earth', 'about', '84', 'million', 'years', 'BC', 'Yep', 'dinosaurs', 'all.Some', 'pioneers/colonists', 'went', 'portal', 'established', 'colony', 'called', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'new', 'earth', 'colonists', 'included', 'military', 'personnel', 'needed', 'deal', 'natural', 'threats', 'day', 'together', 'people', 'special', 'talents', 'abilities', 'mixed', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'go', 'back', 'winning', 'lottery', 'go', 'terra', 'nova.After', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'impressed', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'most', 'recognizable', 'character', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'who', 'role', 'similar', 'one', 'played', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'Avatar', 'leader', 'Terra', 'Nova.I', 'found', 'episodes', 'be', 'contrived', 'were', 'enough', 'engaging', 'creative', 'story', 'lines', 'kept', 'watching', ""'d"", 'finished', '13', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'sad', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'continued.This', 'show', 'enough', 'action', 'plot', 'twists', 'development', 'keep', 'attention', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'reservations', 'watching', 'show', 'family', 'course', 'kind', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'top', 'pick', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'family-friendly', 'show', 'occasional', 'interactions', 'dinosaurs', 'Let', 'face', 'just', 'everyone', 'likes', 'dinosaurs.All', 'give', 'show', '4', 'strong', 'stars']",Terra Nova

They put to much drama in the beginning, and not enough SciFi.  If you are going to produce a SciFi series a word to the wise, don't work the family with issues into the plot to heavily.  This is especially bad if you do it in the beginning of a new series.  It seems to me it got moved around or pre-empted a couple times, but I could be wrong.  But if I'm right that is the death knell of any TV series.  If someone wants to claim they are giving a series a chance, but then pre-empts it or changes the night and time, you know they are liars.  Remember Roar, Threshold, and a hundred other TV series with originality, fair to great writing, interesting characters, and decent to good acting?  This show had that so TV Networks get worried they aren't stupid enough for the public.  Afterall anyone that brings you Honey Boo Boo thinks you have half a brain.

1413233,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B004LROMS4,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[19, 99]","Stop casting models in stead of actors!  SPOILERS IF YOU DID NOT SEE PILOT!!!!!!This could have been a good show. It had the germ of a decent idea that in the future Earth is destroyed and some people many use time travel to escape to a more idealistic past. It instantly had me thinking of all the great and wonderful Jack Finney short stories regarding time travel. The opening shot was an instant let down. Earth looked like a desert but still contained a vast metropolis, advanced transportation, huge population centers, and more...all of it would require vast amounts of power which I highly doubt would still be from oil.OK so I kept watching. We are instantly greeted with bad acting from every direction. A family has an extra kid despite strict population controls. Wouldn't people be sterilized after 2 kids if things were this bad? No one would notice a woman pregnant for the third time? OK. Onward with the show...So the family hides the small third child in the wall and acts as if they do it all the time. The police come in and wreck everything to find a kid they have missed for years including the birth and pregnancy. They find her and the dad gets arrested for beating up the cops. OK, well we still want to get to the meat of this story so I keep watching.Now it's years later and the dad has been in some super max prison for assault. His wife gets him out, rather easily, by giving him a small laser. We never see his actual escape. That would have required some actual writing. So he escapes and puts on some REI or EMS back back filled with foam and pays off some dude to get to the front of the line. Inches from freedom he is spotted coming through one of the seemingly numerous habitrail restricted entrance points. Hehe. OK. Onward.The complete family arrives at earth of the past. Anyone with half a nut for a brain knows this is a paradoxical mess. But we have seen this rule broken before with many films. Terminator 1 & 2 come to mind. There are many others so we move on to find that someone did attempt to work this out. It's a time fracture that leads to an alternate past so our characters can go back and forth without screwing up the future earth and threatening everyone's very existence.Now this is where bad went to worse for me. Our family is oddly unaffectionate, especially after being united into a pottery barn home with hardwood floors that seemed more than a bit out of place. We meet the Jujubees dude from Avatar in the exact same role. And then we meet a new hot white girl who likes to show her great body off to the teen male star after only 10 minutes. It almost approached the absurdity of a skin flick. Now alien/future human hieroglyphs are shown. Hmmmmm... What could that be?Now we meet the deadly dinos with 80s CGI technology. We see a guy eaten. Yay! And we meet the Palestinians. Or the Israelis and Palestinians. It's your call, but there is already another waring Road Warrior faction going on. Is this the future where we are going to get it right? or is this the show where we go to the past with weapons to kill the dinos, destroy the land, and wage war with another group of people over petty squabbles even though we have the entire planet?I gave up at this point. Nothing could make me go back. I'm sure the teen's love will come through the portal soon and set up endless possibilities and implications for his budding hormones.After watching a real show, Breaking Bad, with fantastic acting, amazing writing, and a great yet simple story line I can not watch this Terra Nova garbage. Some day someone will make a new sci-fi show that does what Breaking Bad does. We are obviously not there yet. This show tries to do way too much. It would have been much better were it much smaller, not so vast. If a few families from very rich and powerful people running the show in the future at a small company came through to the past, paradoxes and all, that would have been plot enough to get going with. All these SUVs, RVs, guns, sets, weapons, people. Well it's a bit much. And please, once again, stop casting models in stead of actors!!!!!!!! real people eat and we do not work out 4 hours a day. Enough already. We want realism not mannequins. You'd be better off casting people from any mall in America.********March 16, 2012*******Can not resist coming back to this. Hehe.

Pretty soon, I'm going to stop tuning in to watch these shows if the networks can't even provide some decent closure.  We all got lucky with Firefly (the feature, Serenity, came out to wrap up the story thanks to Joss Whedon) and Jericho (the studio mercifully threw the makers of that one some money to make a half a season's worth of episodes to tie up the proceedings).  But that is the exception, not the norm.  Don't these networks realize how angry some people become when they do this? I have a collection of one-season wonders on disc at home (American Gothic, Surface, The River, Invasion, Nowhere Man, etc.).  Does it aggravate me to own a bunch of stories with no real endings? Yes, but I feel the need to honor these shows because I'm passionate about the entertainment they provide.  Like I said, they're not high art, but they're incredibly worthy.

After watching the first one, the pilot, I was absolutely hooked; after watching the second one, the season ender, I didn't care if I never watched another episode of Terra Nova.  So what went wrong?  What turned Must See TV into Might As Well Miss TV?  What turned the most amazing thing I'd seen on broadcast television in years into an illogical, incomprehensible, infuriating mess?  In a couple of words, bad writing.  The only question I don't know the full answer to is was it always this bad, and it just took a while for the mask to slip?  Or did the writers just wander outside of their area of expertise, which clearly didn't include natural resource extraction?""Genesis"", double length pilot episode: The series was built on a couple of intriguing variations on a couple of well used (overused?) science fiction cliches.  We've all read and seen a number of Escape a Dying Earth stories, but how many have we read or seen in which the escape was into the Mesozoic past?  We've all read and seen a number of Time Travel stories, but how many have we read or seen in which the time travel was known from the beginning to be one way, a journey of no return?  IMHO this had to have been informed by Australia's history as a penal colony, but we moderns with the ability to circumnavigate the globe in a matter of hours tend to forget that in the era of colonization, slower transport and shorter lives meant that colonization was effectively a journey of no return for most colonists whether they were free to do so or not.The question of what makes for a successful colonist is one that has engaged the minds of historians and science fiction writers alike, but both the oppressive government of 2149 and the Mysterious Conspirators think they know what they are looking for in a colonist.  Into this situation comes the Shannon family who fit nobody's pattern for the ideal colonist but just might prove to be the most successful (because the most adaptable, devoted to each other, and bullheadedly determined) colonists of all:Josh Shannon, teenage rebel without a clue or much of an excuse for despising the father he so closely resembles in character and magnetism for trouble.Maddy Shannon, teenage genius and naive girl child.Zoe Shannon, illegal third child.  (We never do learn why a policeman and a medical doctor end up doing something so illegal and so preventable.)Jim Shannon, tough cop willing to do anything (go to prison, break out of prison, rob and kill a criminal in the deleted scenes, etc.) to protect his family and keep them together.Even Dr. Elisabeth Shannon, the only one who was ""chosen"" to go to Terra Nova, finds out that the reason she was chosen was because the head of Terra Nova's science department is an old boyfriend who apparently thought to take advantage of her husband's imprisonment.The deleted scenes make it clear that Dr. Malcom Wallace wasn't the only one trying to manipulate the Shannon family; the Mysterious Conspirators were trying to do so as well, but the Shannons were following their own agenda, and Commander Taylor was monitoring them all in order to prevent interference with HIS plans for Terra Nova.It really ought to have worked better, but it didn't.""Instinct"", first regular episode, third episode broadcast including the two part pilot: a standalone science problem.  Terra Nova was built upon the spawning ground of a very aggressive species of pterosaur that migrates back in enormous numbers every nine years.  The big reveal is the introduction of Elisabeth Shannon's old flame Dr. Malcom Wallace, the man who recruited her for Terra Nova AFTER he heard about Jim's imprisonment.  (The question of ""Malcom, Man or Weasel?"" will occupy the rest of the first season's shows.)""What Remains"", second regular episode, fourth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: another standalone science problem, and the first subpar episode IMHO because it involves that most ludicrously overused of plot complications: amnesia.  The big reveal is Skye introducing Josh Shannon to bartender Tom Boylan in order to get the girl he left behind smuggled into Terra Nova, which he can do because Boylan is secretly working with the Sixers.""The Runaway"", third regular episode, fifth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: largely a mythos advancing episode as a double game is almost successfully played by Mira upon the soft hearted and soft headed Terra Novans.  The big reveal is that Mira and the Sixers are working for some people back in 2149 who accuse Commander Taylor of disobeying orders and misusing Terra Nova, steering it away from its ""true"" purpose, whatever that is.  In particular Mira is revealed to be motivated by getting back together with her daughter and is still trying to win Jim Shannon over to their cause.""Bylaw"", fourth regular episode, sixth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: a standalone crime investigation, as Jim Shannon tries to solve Terra Nova's first murder.  The big reveal is that in order to get Kara sent to Terra Nova, Josh Shannon has to promise to do Mira a favor to be named later.""Nightfall"", fifth regular episode, seventh episode broadcast including the two part pilot: a standalone science problem.  An exploding meteor causes an EMP that destroys every computer chip in Terra Nova.  The big reveal is the introduction of Commander Taylor's Bad Seed son, Lucas, and Mira's mysterious box turns out to be some kind of computer Lucas needs in order to continue his work of destroying his father's work: Terra Nova.  (Question: Why wasn't Lucas' computer also fried by the EMP?)""Proof"", sixth regular episode, eighth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: a mystery and the last of the standalone episodes as events build for the season ender.  Maddy is overjoyed to find one of her scientific heroes in Terra Nova and to be asked to work for him, but she gradually realizes that something is not right.  The big reveal is that Taylor has ordered the murder committing soldier he banished in Bylaw to infiltrate the Sixer camp and Josh Shannon has been caught stealing meds to trade for getting Kara here, which exposes Boylan's dealings with the Sixers and reveals to Taylor that, thanks to Lucas, the Sixers can communicate directly with 2149 between pilgrimages.""VS."", seventh regular episode, ninth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: a mythos advancing crime investigation, as Jim Shannon tries to solve what might really have been Terra Nova's first murder.  The big reveal, which really is a Big Reveal this time, is that Lucas is working on making the time portal work both ways so that the Mysterious Conspirators in 2149 can exploit the natural resources of Terra Nova,...which is supposed to be a bad thing....The sheer staggering stupidity of this is worth reflecting upon at some length.  In order to survive and thrive at anything above the subsistence level, which only looks exciting and romantic to people who've never had to do it, Terra Novans would have to start exploiting the resources of Terra Nova themselves (they are already making use of meteoric iron traded to them by the Sixers), presumably using the hard won lessons of centuries of experience in order to do it in as environmentally safe a way as is practical (because they'll be the ones breathing the air and drinking the water afterwards).  What's more, resources they cannot currently use but which can be made use of in the future could be traded through a two way time portal in return for things they need in Terra Nova; at least three episodes have revolved around colony wide shortages of things easily obtainable in 2149 but impossible to make in Terra Nova.  How much of a lunatic left wing environmentalist wacko do you have to be in order to believe that valuable, exploitable natural resources would be a BAD thing for a colony struggling to become sustainable to have?  (Hint: Mining is not ""raping Mother Earth""; it is digging up the stuff you either need to survive or need to trade for the stuff you need to survive.)  If you actually examine the implications of what they are advocating, it turns out that the biggest proponents of genocide weren't Nazis, Communists, or Islamists, but rather Environmentalists, not the overwhelming majority I hasten to add who simply wish to breathe air without coughing and drink water without getting sick, but rather the extremists, the wackos, whose ideal world cannot begin until upwards of five billion people are poofed out of existence... or at least cut off to die a slow, agonizing, (but well deserved in their opinions) death in a hopelessly polluted 2149.  Remember, to environmentalist wackos, a thousand people would also be a good round number to restart civilization with, so long as they and theirs were all part of that one thousand and all of the people they disagreed with were not.Of course greed and the desire for power can corrupt anything.  To anyone thinking clearly, which the Terra Nova writers were not, the biggest potential threat of a two way time portal is that it could allow the oppressive government of 2149 (You remember; the one that enforces its ""two child policy"" with about the same tender mercies and concern for human rights that the People's Republic of China uses today to enforce its ""one child policy"" and responds to dome secession attempts with storming by the army and imprisonment for the survivors.) to regain control of Terra Nova.  Historically, this is exactly the point where things started to get dicey in colonial times, when the mother country, after more or less ignoring the colonies for years, begins to view them as a revenue source and starts to squeeze, see American Revolution, Causes Of.  But what you or I might perceive as an oppressive government would arguably be viewed as a good thing by environmental extremists, even including the brutal breeding policy (Listen to an environmentalist wacko go off on the subject of bringing kids into this world sometime.), and what political bias that can be identified here is exclusively leftist.  For example in a couple of episodes much is made of the problems with speedy ""frontier justice"".  However, the problem with frontier justice isn't its speed (justice delayed really is justice denied), but rather its small margin for error.  You cannot ""un-hang"" a man, and you can only un-banish a man if you can get to him before the predators do.  Fortunately, as with so many things, our ancestors came up with a pretty good solution that we moderns have proceeded to mess up: life imprisonment.  Life imprisonment was invented as a humane alternative to the death penalty for murder when guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt but not beyond all doubt.  Our ancestors would be absolutely appalled by today's idiocy of insisting that convicted murderers whose guilt IS certain be treated in the same way as convicted murderers where there actually is some doubt or extenuating circumstances.So rather than place the blame on the brutal, presumably left wing Government where it would obviously and logically belong, our left wing writers try to blame it on Capitalist conspirators, as if there was a chance in Hell that a small group of people could take over Hope Plaza and use it to harvest some natural resources in Terra Nova, sell them in the future, and get way with it to enjoy their ill gotten gains under the very noses of the government they had ripped off.  (One of the more infamous examples of previous left wing television writer failure of nerve occurred in the old 1987Amerika (TV miniseries), set ten years in the future in a United States occupied ""nonviolently"" by the Soviet Union; the unofficial tagline was ""a right winger's nightmare as imagined by left wingers"".  Well, the creators just couldn't bring themselves to make Soviet troops the bad guys, so they had all of the atrocities be committed by East German troops wearing UN blue helmets.  The UN actually demanded an apology, though of course without pointing out the obvious that the Soviet troops who had so cheerfully brutalized Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 and were so cheerfully brutalizing Afghanistan at that very moment, would have made entirely plausible villains.)We are not talking about robbing a bank here; we are talking about hijacking a high level government project and setting up a long running (at least six months by their own unrealistically optimistic calculations) industrial operation with government resources and equipment without getting caught....  Try to imagine some conspirators taking over and repurposing NASA for at least six months, DURING a manned space operation,...and getting away with it without the government noticing.""Now You See Me"", eighth regular episode, tenth episode broadcast including the two part pilot: another mythos advancing episode in which Taylor runs into Mira while trying to check on his son's progress in reversing the time portal, and after exchanging prisoner status and fighting off slashers together, they come to something of an understanding.  The big reveal is the identity of the Sixer spy and said spy's reason for doing it.""Within"", ninth regular episode, eleventh episode broadcast including the two part pilot: last regular episode before the season ending two parter.  Lucas has succeeded in figuring out how to reverse the time portal and goes through it back to his bosses in 2149.  Meanwhile, the banished murderer of Bylaw redeems himself by carrying Skye's mother to safety.  The big reveal is that the Mysterious Conspirators are coming and coming soon and that Lucas hates Taylor because he blames him for the death of his mother, Commander Taylor's wife.These are the first two episodes we've seen very much of Lucas Taylor in, and the result is more than a little cringeworthy.  No doubt much of this was the actor's fault, but I think part of it, like everything else wrong with Terra Nova, was the writers' fault.  Though Ashley Zukerman was clearly going for dangerous psychotic, he came across more as sniveling brat.  In a line made fun of by other reviewers, Lucas says of his father, ""The two of us, we suffer from a Shakespearean relationship that borders on Greek tragedy.""  Actually, I see a closer resemblance with the relationship between Dudley Do-Right and Snidely Whiplash, only without the humor...or the logic.""Occupation/Resistance"", double length season ender episode: this is the one that finally killed it for me.  Problems were already apparent before: laughable villain, laughable conspiracy, laughable economics (seriously, writers, crack open a book on economics someday that was NOT either written by a Marxist or being used as a textbook in an economics course taught by one.), laughable Evil Plot (seriously, compared to this, mining asteroids would have been cheaper, easier, and more profitable, not to mention being a lot easier to enjoy the profits from in good health and freedom afterwards.), but the writers actually managed to make things worse.  Let me count the ways:Killing off Kara: I agree that it was time for the ""I promised to get Kara out of 2149, and I'm willing to do anything to keep my promise!"" storyline to come to an end, but why did they have to kill her?  Just to give Josh (Landon Liboiron) Shannon some ""wallowing in it"" acting chops?  Much better IMHO to have brought her through safely and then worked out the love triangle issues in a show (or two) in the next season.Killing off Lt. Washington: The purpose of this was to make Lucas look like a badass (a hopeless cause IMHO because Lucas makes Snidely Whiplash look like a badass), but it cost the show one of its most intriguing underdeveloped characters and a pretty good actress in Simone Kessell.Lucas fooling his father one more time and then, unlike Kara and Wash, apparently surviving by crawling off with a couple of bullets in him: I know that the importance of family is one of the issues repeatedly sledgehammered home in this show, but seriously!  Only days before Commander Taylor had watched this pathetic excuse for a villain murder Lt. Washington in cold blood.  Couldn't we have had the karmic satisfaction of watching a sadder but wiser father see through this pathetic attempt and continue beating his bad seed son to a pulp rather than watching him be suckered by Lucas one more time?Finally, I realize that the writers were busy working out their personal issues with the economic system that allows them to live better than 99% of the world's population while writing stories and screenplays condemning it, but couldn't they have come up with some less moronic villains?  (The only non-crazy, non-stupid villain shown in the entire two part episode outside of the ranks of the Nazi storm troopers is Mira, and she is absolutely wasted here, her considerable wisdom ignored, her presence almost nonexistent.)  Or a less moronic Evil Plan?  Meteoric iron?  THAT is what this idiocy was about?  (My review title?  A direct quote from that barely functional hypochondriacal moron of a bad guy, Weaver, as he is explaining to his equally moronic colleagues just how much richer this Can't Fail plan is going to make them,... which is just before the carnotaur eats them all.  Boy, did he ever unintentionally call it, both about his plan and about the whole darn series!)  Sure, meteoric iron is cool stuff and expensive on Earth because it is so rare, but it is still just iron, not gold and not diamonds.  If anything, it ought to be cheaper in 2149 because one would assume that asteroid mining has begun by then.  In addition it probably would have helped if SOMEBODY on the writing staff had put in a good five or ten minutes of research on mining.  Gathering up iron meteorites and fragments embedded in the ground is going to take a lot more time than these writers seem to realize even with the never shown mining rigs or ""diggers"" referred to so reverently.  As for the idea of quickly clearing the jungle with explosive devices, well, they will certainly knock down the trees and kill any dinos in the blast zone, but their dead bodies will just attract more dinos from outside the blast zone who will be able to hide in the afore mentioned knocked down trees (see Tunguska Blast of 1908) between predatory forays into the mining operation.  Bulldozing and burning will still be required on a very large scale just to clear an adequate killing zone around the mines.  By the way, ten of an explosive charge that will supposedly clear a 20 kilometer diameter circle aren't going to clear half a continent; they'll be lucky if ten are enough to clear this one meteorite impact zone to any degree of adequacy, given the difficulty posed by valleys to straight line explosive forces.  Lastly, since this is still supposed to be a covert operation that must be concealed from the government Before, During, and After, having over a hundred people involved in it, just counting those in Terra Nova, is really bad security practice.  Unless the plan was to pay off most of their coconspirators in lead rather than gold, there is no way this secret can possibly be kept, in which case so much for getting away with it... back in 2149 anyway.But in the end I wonder if it it would even have mattered because as I was rewatching the series, I had an epiphany: Terra Nova was doomed from the start by something other than political bias and bad writing:expense.There was never going to be enough money to do it right, to do a realistic colonization of the past, which must eventually, after Terra Nova had proved the concept, have involved massive numbers of colonists and multiple expanding settlements.  You could do this in writing, certainly in animation, maybe even in a live action movie, but not in a live action TV show where a significant portion of the large but limited budget was tied up in the set where most of the settlement scenes were filmed.On TV Terra Nova never had a chance of continuing UNLESS they altered the story line to lower the costs by having a bunch of actors crawling around in the wilderness trying to solve Lost-style mysteries with only a very tiny amount of expensive futuristic looking new sets and props.  In the end they blew up Hope Plaza and all the expensive time travel colonization plot lines because they couldn't afford not to, but in the process they turned it into something I no longer cared enough about to watch anymore.  The Shannon Family's continuing vacation adventures at Club Dino wouldn't have been enough for me.Note: A limited edition two-CD soundtrack album is availableTerra Novabut the Terra Nova Motion Comic continuation that you may receive an Activation Code for in your DVD box appears to have been taken down.

Stupid FOX should have known this from the beginning hung in there and put this great show in better time slot for a second season. Instead they canceled it. I would also like to add that my wife was a big fan of the dance show but she wanted to see the dinosaurs and she got to really like this show. And watched the dance show from 9 to 10(the second hour).That is how much we loved Terra Nova.The cast was great,also. The story line was very interesting.

1413246,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B004LROMS4,"Hope this helps ""help""","[2, 2]","When the advertisements came up for the show, it intrigued me.  The dinosaur premise was one that was rarely attempted by major studios...and in that rarely successful.  What drew me in to watch that first episode was to see if it would soar above the clouds, or crash and burn like some of the other attempts.  Needless to say, it simply left me in awe.  Not only was the dinosaur premise executed in a very believable manner, they created a tension and struggle that was not dark, grim, and hopeless like many of the shows that season.  But within that struggle resonated hope for a better life, and for nobility & honor.  It may just be me, but the show did leave a mark on me.  I have enjoyed many shows but forgot them after awhile.  Terra Nova, however, was one that stayed with me.FOR PARENTS AND CONCERNED FOLKS:Ok, this show is very much a ""family"" show.  It feels like one (in the best sense of the word).  In fact, the main protagonist really is ""The Shannon Family"".  However, there are some caveats to this.  Language-wise, it's pretty clean (I did like the script, btw) but on occasion (and rarely), the ""D-word"" or ""S-word"" does come up.  There really isn't any innuendos and such...but the violence may be an issue for some.  It's not terribly grotesque...but it may bother some people...after all, not all the deaths and attacks are humans running around with guns.  Some of them are done by ravenous dinosaur predators who are most definitely hungry.  Think Jurassic Park, but slightly more.  All in all, it really is a show that the family can watch together (older children...no need to give young ones nightmares).MOVING ON (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Let me just lay this out there.  It is unfortunate that FOX decided to cancel this show.  I really don't know why, but they did.  That said, I hope someone will realize the untapped potential that the show has and pick it up sometime and finish it.  So what does this do to the plot and story.  Fortunately, the way that the narrative was told actually closes the story arc nicely.  I did feel content and complete...even though I knew that it is incomplete.  They graciously don't leave you with a complete cliff hangar (just an allusion to an unexplored territory that they would have explored if there was a 2nd season).  But anyways, I really loved this show because it feels fresh.  I'm not talking about ""uniqueness"" or ""originality""...but that a hopeful aura exists strongly with this one.  It shows you a family who is not perfect, but struggle together to overcome odds.  It shows you a nobility and heroism that can be found in humanity.  It also shows you that not all choices are black and white...but even with all the gray, there is still a right and wrong.  The importance of community and working together is an often explored theme...as well as a sense of honor.  Frankly, this really was a breath of fresh air.  The show was well paced and definitely was well organized.  While constantly progressing the storyline, you were able to witness different aspects of the Terra Nova village.  Everything was executed in a believable manner, and I was quite impressed with the characters...both main, supporting, and ""extras"".  They really captured a vibrant and beautiful world with this one.SPECIAL FEATURES:Aside from having all the possible available episodes, this set comes with many interesting and intriguing extras.  Deleted Scenes, mini-documentaires about the Dinosaurs and ""making of"" the pilot episode just to name a few.  They are standard extras, but fun to watch nonetheless.All in All, this is a welcome change of pace for television dramas.  It has a decent blend of action and character interaction, and a full and cohesive storyline.  Though unfortunately the show broadcast was cancelled, it still ties up nicely and with a certain amount of satisfaction that it doesn't feel terribly incomplete.  I say do yourself a favor and buy a copy.  There is much to interest you and many wonderful life lessons as well.",5,A Beautiful Series That Reminded Us of the Nobility of Older Days,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,4013,"['When', 'advertisements', 'came', 'up', 'show', 'intrigued', 'dinosaur', 'premise', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'rarely', 'attempted', 'major', 'studios', 'rarely', 'successful', 'What', 'drew', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'see', 'would', 'soar', 'clouds', 'crash', 'burn', 'other', 'attempts', 'Needless', 'say', 'simply', 'left', 'awe', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'dinosaur', 'premise', 'executed', 'very', 'believable', 'manner', 'created', 'tension', 'struggle', 'was', 'not', 'dark', 'grim', 'hopeless', 'many', 'shows', 'season', 'struggle', 'resonated', 'hope', 'better', 'life', 'nobility', 'honor', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'show', 'did', 'leave', 'mark', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'shows', 'forgot', 'awhile', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'however', 'was', 'one', 'stayed', 'me.FOR', 'PARENTS', 'AND', 'CONCERNED', 'FOLKS', 'Ok', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'family', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'fact', 'main', 'protagonist', 'really', 'Shannon', 'Family', 'However', 'are', 'caveats', 'Language-wise', 'pretty', 'clean', 'did', 'script', 'btw', 'occasion', 'rarely', 'D-word', 'S-word', 'come', 'up', 'really', ""n't"", 'innuendos', 'such', 'violence', 'may', 'be', 'issue', 'not', 'terribly', 'grotesque', 'may', 'bother', 'people', 'not', 'deaths', 'attacks', 'are', 'humans', 'running', 'around', 'guns', 'are', 'done', 'ravenous', 'dinosaur', 'predators', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'hungry', 'Think', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'slightly', 'more', 'really', 'show', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'older', 'children', 'need', 'give', 'young', 'ones', 'nightmares', '.MOVING', 'ON', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Let', 'just', 'lay', 'there', 'unfortunate', 'FOX', 'decided', 'cancel', 'show', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', 'said', 'hope', 'someone', 'will', 'realize', 'untapped', 'potential', 'show', 'pick', 'up', 'sometime', 'finish', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'plot', 'story', 'Fortunately', 'way', 'narrative', 'was', 'told', 'actually', 'story', 'arc', 'nicely', 'did', 'feel', 'content', 'complete', 'even', 'knew', 'incomplete', 'graciously', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'complete', 'cliff', 'hangar', 'just', 'allusion', 'unexplored', 'territory', 'would', 'have', 'explored', 'was', '2nd', 'season', 'really', 'loved', 'show', 'fresh', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'uniqueness', 'originality', 'hopeful', 'aura', 'strongly', 'one', 'family', 'who', 'not', 'perfect', 'together', 'overcome', 'odds', 'nobility', 'heroism', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'humanity', 'also', 'not', 'choices', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'even', 'gray', 'still', 'right', 'wrong', 'importance', 'community', 'working', 'together', 'often', 'explored', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'honor', 'Frankly', 'really', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'definitely', 'was', 'well', 'organized', 'constantly', 'progressing', 'storyline', 'were', 'able', 'witness', 'different', 'aspects', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'village', 'Everything', 'was', 'executed', 'believable', 'manner', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'characters', 'main', 'supporting', 'extras', 'really', 'captured', 'vibrant', 'beautiful', 'world', 'one.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Aside', 'having', 'possible', 'available', 'episodes', 'set', 'many', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'extras', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'mini-documentaires', 'Dinosaurs', 'making', 'pilot', 'episode', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'are', 'standard', 'extras', 'fun', 'watch', 'nonetheless.All', 'All', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'television', 'dramas', 'decent', 'blend', 'action', 'character', 'interaction', 'full', 'cohesive', 'storyline', 'unfortunately', 'show', 'broadcast', 'was', 'cancelled', 'still', 'up', 'nicely', 'certain', 'amount', 'satisfaction', ""n't"", 'feel', 'terribly', 'incomplete', 'say', 'do', 'favor', 'buy', 'copy', 'much', 'interest', 'many', 'wonderful', 'life', 'lessons', 'well']",Terra Nova

Plus how can mankind survive and get a new start and not be worried about becoming exintct along with the dinosaurs ?Still finding some flaws in the logic of the plot, among other things, I was hooked from the start since the show was a fun guilty pleasure adventure series and made pretty damn good tv. Fox got good ratings from it but wanted a huge hit that made up for how expensive it was to make, kind of like with Firefly.But to me 12 episodes wasn't time to even capture as many fans as it might have eventually since some shows don't get viewers until mid-season or the second season and....this show had neither! Next time, Fox if a show costs too much to make....don't make it and save us fans the misery when you decide to cancel it! Do us a favor and cancel garbage like American Idol!

FOX has already let fans down by cancelling the show, the least it could do now is make the already-filmed second season available -- if not to a video-download source, then by DVD.FOX had a golden ""Gene Roddenberry"" opportunity to show us a world in which we could be better than we are -- a world of literal fresh starts.  In Star Trek, Roddenberry showed us a future full of equality, justice, and plenty; in the turmoil of the 1960's that was beacon of hope.  Terra Nova had that same kind of chance to entertain us with wonderful characters solving the usual TV problems, like cops and robbers, medical epidemics, and political strife, while at the same time saying something important about ecology:  how to live off the land, and with the Earth, so as to avoid the global warming pitfalls.  AND, not only that, but they had JURASSIC PARK-quality special-effects dinosaurs adding the threat, and the charm, of nature to everything.  Imagine what truths FOX could have taught about the actual living creatures of 80 million years ago; with one palentologist consultant on the writing staff, we might have actually learned something.  FOX could have shown us the distant past that truly was, as well as one possible future that might have been, but they tossed that moment away at the end of the first season.  The real hero of that show was the Shannon family.  ""Family"" was the bond and the strength and the real winner of each episode.  We need to see the second season because we so desire to see the family win.  (And that little Zoey is a living doll; I'll miss watching her grow up.)

1413263,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004LROMS4,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","Short-lived and short-shrifted, I was a fan of this engaging series.It's the year 2149 and our home, Planet Earth, is near the end. Abused, mistreated, and poisoned - most of the world is, for all practical arguments, already dead. Forests no longer exist, the oceans are filled with toxins where all sealife is extinct, the air so noxious and vile that everyone has to wear respirator masks just to survive. Humankind has finally ruined the planet.Having mocked and ignored past global abuses, the whirlwind is going to be paid by mass punishment. With no place to hide or escape, humanity exists on the downward slope of its own extinction. No great armageddon - we die in a whimper. Some would argue deservedly so.Suddenly, by divine intervention or pure stupid luck, a second chance is given.Incredibly, a freakish planetside and stable wormhole has been discovered. A spatial doorway that allows a one-way transit 85 million years into the past, when Earth was still young and vibrantly untouched; where dinosaurs roam the supercontinent of Pangea and the air and water is brilliantly clean. We get a second turn at the wheel. Hopefully not blowing it again.But is everyone hoping for the same goal? Suppose the social elites of the future have very different plans? Suppose the one-percenters are actually attempting to rape the planet again in order to continue their privileged perch atop society and the masses - manipulate and even murder their way to simultaneously control both the past and the future. And was the discovery of the wormhole truly accidental?Into this nexus of history stands the Shannon Family.Dr. Elizabeth Shannon and her two teenage kids have been beaten all the odds by being selected to go thru the looking glass and into a reborn life. This despite having a police officer husband locked away for the crime of defending their unauthorized illegal third child from the state masters. But she absolutely won't leave them behind. A desperate plan is put into place and the Shannons have one shot at freedom.Was Terra Nova spectacular? No. But could it have worked its way there? I believe the answer is a very strong 'yes'. More so given that many longtime viewers understand that the first year of any series is typically the shakedown phase. Few shows start out the gate completely right. It often takes a full season of fine tuning by the writers and cast before they find the proper balance of drama and action; of introducing macro and micro story arcs.In my opinion, what sank the series wasn't that there wasn't enough audience capture. Looking back, one can see the Neilsen Ratings were decently solid for their time slot and there was enough interest to justify a typical Fox sophomore investment. So why didn't they get one?I dismiss the generally accepted belief that the cost of the special effects was the proverbial straw, it wasn't. Rather, I believe it was the initial poor decision by Spielberg & Co to do the entire production in Australia. The typical Spielberg approach to envision 'blockbuster' when he should've been thinking and planning for the small screen. The budget was grossly inflated by filming in another country 11,000 miles from where the business, actors, writers, and many of the creatives actually resided. If they had done the series in North America, fans would even now be enjoying this show. Truly unfortunate.Additionally, complaints from fellow scifi fans that the show was ""too family oriented"" and didn't present enough action - I find a sad testament to the shallow demands of youth.Overall, a very entertaining production that will now never be able to complete its story.",4,Short-Lived And Short-Shrifted Engaging Series,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,3651,"['Short-lived', 'short-shrifted', 'was', 'fan', 'engaging', 'series.It', 'year', '2149', 'home', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'end', 'Abused', 'mistreated', 'poisoned', 'most', 'world', 'practical', 'arguments', 'already', 'dead', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'oceans', 'are', 'filled', 'toxins', 'where', 'sealife', 'extinct', 'air', 'so', 'noxious', 'vile', 'everyone', 'wear', 'respirator', 'masks', 'just', 'survive', 'Humankind', 'finally', 'ruined', 'planet.Having', 'mocked', 'ignored', 'global', 'abuses', 'whirlwind', 'going', 'be', 'paid', 'mass', 'punishment', 'place', 'hide', 'escape', 'humanity', 'exists', 'downward', 'slope', 'own', 'extinction', 'great', 'armageddon', 'die', 'whimper', 'would', 'argue', 'deservedly', 'so.Suddenly', 'divine', 'intervention', 'pure', 'stupid', 'luck', 'second', 'chance', 'given.Incredibly', 'freakish', 'planetside', 'stable', 'wormhole', 'been', 'discovered', 'spatial', 'doorway', 'one-way', 'transit', '85', 'million', 'years', 'past', 'when', 'Earth', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'vibrantly', 'untouched', 'where', 'roam', 'supercontinent', 'Pangea', 'air', 'water', 'brilliantly', 'clean', 'get', 'second', 'turn', 'wheel', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'blowing', 'again.But', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'same', 'goal', 'Suppose', 'social', 'elites', 'future', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'plans', 'Suppose', 'one-percenters', 'are', 'actually', 'attempting', 'rape', 'planet', 'again', 'order', 'continue', 'privileged', 'perch', 'atop', 'society', 'masses', 'manipulate', 'even', 'murder', 'way', 'simultaneously', 'control', 'past', 'future', 'was', 'discovery', 'wormhole', 'truly', 'accidental', 'nexus', 'history', 'Shannon', 'Family.Dr', 'Elizabeth', 'Shannon', 'two', 'teenage', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'beaten', 'odds', 'being', 'selected', 'go', 'thru', 'looking', 'glass', 'reborn', 'life', 'having', 'police', 'officer', 'husband', 'locked', 'away', 'crime', 'defending', 'unauthorized', 'illegal', 'third', 'child', 'state', 'masters', 'absolutely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'behind', 'desperate', 'plan', 'put', 'place', 'Shannons', 'have', 'one', 'shot', 'freedom.Was', 'Terra', 'Nova', 'spectacular', 'No', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'way', 'believe', 'answer', 'very', 'strong', ""'yes"", 'More', 'so', 'given', 'many', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'understand', 'first', 'year', 'series', 'typically', 'shakedown', 'phase', 'Few', 'shows', 'start', 'gate', 'completely', 'right', 'often', 'full', 'season', 'fine', 'tuning', 'writers', 'cast', 'find', 'proper', 'balance', 'drama', 'action', 'introducing', 'macro', 'micro', 'story', 'opinion', 'what', 'sank', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'audience', 'capture', 'Looking', 'back', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Neilsen', 'Ratings', 'were', 'decently', 'solid', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'enough', 'interest', 'justify', 'typical', 'Fox', 'sophomore', 'investment', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'dismiss', 'generally', 'accepted', 'belief', 'cost', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'proverbial', 'straw', 'was', ""n't"", 'Rather', 'believe', 'was', 'initial', 'poor', 'decision', 'Spielberg', 'Co', 'do', 'entire', 'production', 'Australia', 'typical', 'Spielberg', 'approach', 'envision', ""'blockbuster"", 'when', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'planning', 'small', 'screen', 'budget', 'was', 'grossly', 'inflated', 'filming', 'country', '11,000', 'miles', 'where', 'business', 'actors', 'writers', 'many', 'creatives', 'actually', 'resided', 'had', 'done', 'series', 'North', 'America', 'fans', 'would', 'even', 'now', 'be', 'enjoying', 'show', 'Truly', 'unfortunate.Additionally', 'complaints', 'fellow', 'scifi', 'fans', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'family', 'oriented', 'did', ""n't"", 'present', 'enough', 'action', 'find', 'sad', 'testament', 'shallow', 'demands', 'youth.Overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'production', 'will', 'now', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'complete', 'story']",Terra Nova

It seemed so mixed up at the beginning that I doubted how it could ever work. And yet it did. They avoided every trap in the premise and managed to grow stronger throughout their short season. And in particular they managed to avoid almost every bad problem usually associated with family dramas. Each character in the family managed to stand on their own and be part of the family which is rare.Stephen Lang steals the show in terms of acting though. He manages to play a larger than life character without missing a beat. And having that character to the side of the story (rather than the center which is the family) makes it work better.With a couple exceptions, the story builds across the season to an inevitable showdown. Things move along at a quick reasonable pace rather than the obvious stalling that shows up in many other shows. And they bring the story of the season to a very clean ending.They managed in the end to deliver a good miniseries. But I dont know that the concept or the material will support a long run. Especially considering that the budgets will probably be less in a second season. They also have to pick a new direction to go in because they will either end up repeating themselves (how many invasions from the future can there be) or will end up going down a bad road (democracy building or the mixed civilization made of two groups that dont like each other) which has been done before.Usually these shows peak at the pilot and decay from there. This is one of the rare ones that got better the longer it went. And I'm hoping they get another season and blow out my (low) expectations again. This isn't great drama by any means.

Writing was weak, good actors underutilized, pretty faces without actual chops were in practically every scene with no logical reason for them being the focus of the program.I watched most of the first season on tv, and regret the time spent. By episode 3 or 4 it was painfully obvious to me that the producers had no intention of fully utilizing the skills of the few good actors they had, and spent untold and ridiculous amounts of time and effort focusing on unrealistic plastic 2-dimensional characters played by some of the most wooden actors -- quite frankly, the whole blended family issue was played falsely and solely for a PC effect with absolutely no realism.The child/teen actors in this show are some of the weakest characters ... they were obviously picked for looks, most definitely NOT for their acting skills. The entire running substory about the teen angst / puberty / childhood issues is truly DULL and BORING and utterly banal.Aside from a few CGI dinosaurs, the special effects was almost 80's quality (those stupid electric cars and motorcycles were lame) ... the FX were generally stupid, fake, overwraught, pretentious, lame, corny, weak ... etc. etc. etc. ... I so much wanted this show to fulfill the promise of the overall sci-fi fantasy storyline, but instead of focusing on the possibilities, they spent the vast majority of screentime on lame interpersonal ""growing pains"" type stories that you can get in any and every teen drama ever produced. A completely wasted opportunity for something intelligent and interesting, instead just hour after hour of the exact same boring and shallow drivel that is already been done in so many other primitive and shallow shows on tv.I watched almost the entire first season ... I tried to give the show a fair shake ... kept hoping it would smooth out, the actors would settle into the roles, the storylines would make sense ... but it never happened. I don't recall if I saw the season finale or not, but it wouldn't have mattered by then. All in all, NONE of the background / backstories ever made any real sense. There were so many plot holes and mangled details in every storyline that by season end there was just no way to plug them all.

These people had the opportunity to do something different and we get the same old c#*p all over again. In this show, the Creataceous is merely window dressing and has little to do with the same old stories that might as well be placed into today's setting. The few plots that are related to being in the ancient past are so unrealistic and blown out of proportion its like watching a Saturday morning cartoon. I love prehistoric documentaries because of the science and known facts about prehistoric life. This show has almost none of that. You might as well go watch a hospital soap opera.

It had all the elements of success, both in real time and in the expectations of many future seasons, but they pulled the plug prematurely and no substantial reasons.  Each episode was a stand alone adventure in a truly fantastic setting - a world of dinosaurs.  It had a central family to deepen it, teenage love to titilate the core focal group audience, and fascinating future-world/ancient-world possibilities to entice the older viewers.  The over-all arc of the series was still being laid out with each episode of Series One, essentially Terra Nova vs. The Sixers, and what might be the true purpose of this colony in the past, and who really wanted to control it -- all of which would make an incredible Season Two.  But the network execs pulled the plug much too soon, and for superficial reasons that defy common sense.  They could have sold many seasons worth of DVDs, with increasing demand each year.

He made a ton of money on ""Babylon 5"" because he was a visionary and could see the popularity of the series AND the social messages the series showed.In the general concepts, Terra Nova and Babylon 5 are very much like. They both have action, adventure, humor, sub-plots, and serious social situations.Come on Ted! Buy Terra Nova and continue it!!!  It may cost a lot to make but you'd have a growing fan base which would mean you could charge more per sponsor, thus recouping your costs and have a profit.

1413293,ADBT2QYXGQCSJ,B004LROMS4,"TV-Tastic ""Shawn""","[3, 4]","Regular readers of our blog know that as much as we like the concept of Terra Nova, we have been very skeptical about whether or not it would be able to find an audience on a prime-time network (especially FOX) to justify the largest budget in television history, because quite frankly, prime-time audiences don't watch serialized science fiction for the most part.  And, yes, despite what writer/exec. producer Brannon Braga claims, Terra Nova is indeed a science fiction show.And this brings us to what we hate about the show and what we think we may be begrudgingly loving about the show:  Producers/writers Brannon Braga and Ren&eacute; Echeverria, the old guard who wrote and produced much of Star Trek franchise from The Next Generation forward.  For the record, many Trek fans will blame the production team of Rick Berman and Brannon Braga (""B & B"") for the demise of that franchise and while we at The `Tastic do not share in this opinion, we certainly recognize that Braga himself brings a certain generic, vanilla, crisis-of-the-week factor to dramatic television that certainly didn't help that franchise or most of the other things he's worked on since. The `Tastic will send a Tootsie Pop to the first person who can tell us what the plot of season eight of 24 was without going to IMDb  (and, yes, we'll know).This is the thing about Terra Nova: it reeks of 1990's Trek in generic plot which is why we're throwing Echevarria into the same boat as Braga on this one because it can't be a coincidence.  Terra Nova is a good show and it is superficially exciting but for true connoisseurs of drama and genre television, it's not particularly original (the entire idea is stolen from a Star Trek: The Original Series third-season episode, All Our Yesterdays to begin with) and frankly it's been very watered-down for a general audience. One definitely gets the feeling that the original concept was a lot more hardcore than what was actually developed for television.That being said, the difference between Terra Nova and 1990's Trek is that they've actually done a pretty good job of making the show accessible to all audiences which is what may save it in the ratings.  That's right, for as much as the generic story-telling grates us, we're actually glad they went this route because if they had gone balls-out with pushing the Sci-Fi aspect, it wouldn't have a chance.  Instead, though, what they are doing is really making this a character piece, focusing on primarily the Shannons as a family and the pilgrims at Terra Nova and their adventures and less so on the mysteries surrounding Terra Nova and we see where this is going.The producers are claiming that Terra Nova is ""nothing like Lost.""  We call shenanigans on this claim and not because it's set in a mysterious jungle, no, because it's a fish-out-of-water character story of people from different backgrounds trying to adapt and survive in their new environment with adversarial factions and beneath it all is a mystery that is slowly coming to light.  The thing is, for all the high budget used on this show, it's Lost-lite that's more family-friendly (also, like Lost, this show has a chance to be three seasons into it before anyone realizes that they are indeed watching a Sci-Fi show).The show is a lot of fun even though we know exactly what we're watching because we've kind of seen it all before.  They've done an excellent job with character development and casting and the characters if not unique are certainly likable and relatable.  The stories so far aren't bad (the pilot was great, the second episode for us was so-so, but still fun) but they are just vanilla enough to keep the CSI and Law & Order viewer entertained with the weekly story that wraps itself up in 60 minutes.  Speaking of which, that kind of threw us off a bit, as well, because as noted, we got the impression from the publicity surrounding the show and the pilot itself that Terra Nova was going to be a serialized epic. Epic, perhaps, but serialized? Not so much, which (even though we'd prefer a serial) is a good thing for the series if it wants to have any chance at long-term survival - again - especially on FOX.As far as the mysteries are concerned, unlike Lost, they gave away two or three answers to mysteries at the end of the pilot alone which tells us that they are trying to avoid the problems that serialized shows have and that is that if you miss an episode, you wind up... well... lost and don't come back to the series. Yet another a very smart move.  So, in as much as we are a little annoyed by the very simplistic aspects of the plotlines, we appreciate that the producers seem quite cognizant of what they have to do to keep a Sci-Fi show from alienating a general audience.The production values?  Well, really... is it necessary to say that all of the sets, props and visual effects are absolutely amazing when we are talking about the most expensive show in television history? Yeah, we didn't think so, however, we will say that a lot of science for this show seems to be a little screwy, but then again, we are geeks and it's doubtful that the average viewer is going to let that interfere with their enjoyment of the show.So, we definitely recommend Terra Nova.  It's a very good show, albeit, as repeatedly noted, a little vanilla, but it's good television for the whole family.  More than that, though, we think that the show has been produced smartly enough to stave off cancellation for some time which is something that is very not only hit-and-miss for Sci-Fi in general, but something of a minor miracle for Sci-Fi on FOX.UPDATE:  Just finished watching the season one finale and between that and the last half a dozen episodes or so, Terra Nova has turned out to be a lot better than we originally gave it credit for.  It also became more of a serial towards the end, but still, the episodes can stand on their own without the audience really having to have seen the ones that came before them.
