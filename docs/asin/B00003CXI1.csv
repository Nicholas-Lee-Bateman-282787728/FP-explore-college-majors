525988,A19K5DILM15WU3,B00003CXI1,,"[1, 1]","This two and a half hour long fantasy adventure was not only able to get kids to come and sit through it once, but draw them back several more times. The folks at Warner Brothers realised that kids saw it in theaters until they were sick of it. Also, many people purchased or downloaded a bootlegged copy of the film. To get the same results on video that the film had in theaters, Warner Bros. has added several deleted scenes to the film. Also, there is an added disc with more deleted scenes, plus many other special features including a virtual tour of Hogwarts and the making of the film.Harry Potter is eleven years old and lives withe his mean aunt and uncle, and their little son Dudley. Harry has always been told that his parents died in a car accident and that the lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead was from the accident. But on his birthaday, he discovers that he is a wizard and that his parents were murdered by the evil Lord Voldermort. When Voldermort tried to kill Harry, the spell backfired leaving Harry with the scar and reducing Voldermort to almost nothing. Harry is sent to Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards, where he meats Ron and Hermoine, his two best friends, and descovers that the Sorcerer's Stone, wich has the power to bring Lord Voldermort back to full powere, is being kept in the school. Harry also learns that a teacher in the school is helping the Evil Lord get to the stone. Harry must get to the stone before all is lost.The acting was great. Danial Radclieff is perfect as Harry Potter. John Willams does the score. His other works include The ""Star Wars"" saga and ""E.T."" Adults and children will love Harry Potter. And there is no devil worship in it for those of you who don't know what you are talking about trying to bann the movies and books wich are about an innocent little child who lives in a magical world. You will love ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"", the first of seven movies to be made by Warner Bros.",5,Harry Potter's 1st Year at Hogwarts!,1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,1981,"['two', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'able', 'get', 'kids', 'come', 'sit', 'once', 'back', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'folks', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'realised', 'kids', 'saw', 'theaters', 'were', 'sick', 'Also', 'many', 'people', 'purchased', 'downloaded', 'bootlegged', 'copy', 'film', 'get', 'same', 'results', 'video', 'film', 'had', 'theaters', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'added', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'film', 'Also', 'added', 'disc', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'many', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'virtual', 'tour', 'Hogwarts', 'making', 'film.Harry', 'Potter', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'withe', 'mean', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'little', 'son', 'Dudley', 'Harry', 'always', 'been', 'told', 'parents', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'shaped', 'scar', 'forehead', 'was', 'accident', 'birthaday', 'wizard', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldermort', 'When', 'Voldermort', 'tried', 'kill', 'Harry', 'spell', 'backfired', 'leaving', 'Harry', 'scar', 'reducing', 'Voldermort', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Harry', 'sent', 'Hogwarts', 'school', 'witches', 'wizards', 'where', 'Ron', 'Hermoine', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'descovers', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'power', 'bring', 'Lord', 'Voldermort', 'back', 'full', 'powere', 'being', 'kept', 'school', 'Harry', 'also', 'teacher', 'school', 'helping', 'Evil', 'Lord', 'get', 'stone', 'Harry', 'must', 'get', 'stone', 'lost.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Danial', 'Radclieff', 'perfect', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'John', 'Willams', 'score', 'other', 'works', 'include', 'Star', 'Wars', 'saga', 'E.T', 'Adults', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'devil', 'worship', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'trying', 'bann', 'movies', 'books', 'are', 'innocent', 'little', 'child', 'who', 'magical', 'world', 'will', 'love', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorceror', 'Stone', 'first', 'seven', 'movies', 'be', 'made', 'Warner', 'Bros']",N/A
525989,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00003CXI1,,"[3, 4]","Adapting a book for a film necessarily requires some adaptations and changes. These are usually for the worse. This film is an exception. Compromises have been made but it has been splendidly done. Most of the story from the book has been carried over and the work has been done in a creditable fashion. This is particularly nice in that a fantasy film is particularly difficult in this regard.The story is of a young man who is unaware that he was born a wizard. After the death of his parents, he was raised by relatives who detest him and have tried to keep him from learning about his heritage or even knowing that there is any such thing as magic. The magic community has not forgotten him, however. The young man has a past and famous parents. He is also the only person ever to have survived a fight with ""he who must not be named"". He did this at the age of 2. Now, he has been accepted at an academy for wizards. His eyes are opened to numerous possibilities and soon he is involved in solving a mystery. Things are not all as they seem at the Hogwarts Academy. Foul things are happening and young Harry Potter is determined to figure them out. That in itself constitutes an education.This is an extremely entertaining film for kids of all ages.

525992,AM0Q2JUS910ZQ,B00003CXI1,"JEROME W, MARTIN","[1, 1]","Its been while since Harry Potter films graced the movie theaters, but I just had to write something in praise of these masterpieces, especially the first two movies.  These remained probably the most faithful to the excellent books of all the movies, and I thinkall the films were excellent.  Dumbledore was most faithfully played by Richard Harris, who unfortunately passed away before theseries got even half way through.  His successor was OK but weak compared with Harris.  But the wittiness  of the characters suchas Herminine  and Ron and the brilliant special effects kept the series strong especially later on when they became darker.  I willwrite about the other movies later.I only objected to the title which in England was called Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone instead of the Sorcerers Stone.I guess Warner Bros figured people in the US would not know what a Philosophers Stone was.  Some minor changes in the storydid not alter the main story sequence from the book, which were brilliantly written by J. K. Rowling.  She never talked down to thereader even though the books were supposedly written for children.  The text is sophisticated and detailed and  very descriptive.And I loved the train; I have a passion for steam locomotives and though the British ones look kind of odd without the cow catcheron the front, I will still take a dozen.  Beautiful photography and scenery enhanced the visuals.  And flawless special effects.If you haven't seen the films or read the books, I strongly recommend them if you like charming, funny, some sophistication andjust good story telling; these are not fairy tales yet are top notch fantasy movies.  I got all of the movies from AMAZON as wellas the books.  I give this book five stars.
