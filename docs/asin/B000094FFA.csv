751692,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000094FFA,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","Friendship is essential to making a troupe like this work, and from the short clips intermingled between their stand-up it is obvious that these four comedians have been around for a very long time.  They have been telling each other jokes as well as building off each other in hopes to better themselves and provide quality entertainment for their audiences.  This is shown with the last couple of minutes of their performances when they all come out and interact with each other and the audiences.  This provides for some of the funnier moments of the film.  Just to see them talking to each other, laughing at their jokes, and building a continual friendship makes the audience laugh more, Jen and I laugh more, as well as showing us this human side to these soothsayers of day-to-day activities.This was a very entertaining program to watch on a night where comedy was definitely needed to lighten the spirits.  These four guys are masters of their domain, and while Bill Engvall is our least favorite of them (he just delivers too quickly and less redneck), we still find ourselves laughing all together.  We cannot wait to get our hands on more of Larry the Cable Guy's material and see where he finds the humor in our lives.  Speaking of Larry the Cable Guy, my wife and I were talking about how we think his entire act is just an act.  He is not as redneck as he talks, but instead is building his reputation on it.  If this is true, I am very impressed.  Here he is building his bank account using a voice that is not uncommon here in the Mountains of Virginny.  Also, we were very impressed with Ron White, whom we had never heard before.  His humor is sharp and dark at the same time.  He had my wife rolling on the floor with laughter during 95% of his act.  That is very impressive.  I cannot knock Foxworthy, but if you have ever heard any of his stand-up, you have heard his stand-up.  It hasn't changed that much from when I heard him several years ago.  While I still laughed at his jokes, I did think that he may need to revamp some of his material ... especially his ultra-classic ""You Might Be A Redneck If..."" material.Overall, we were very impressed with this program and immediately ran out the next night to get the sequel to hear ourselves laugh again and again.  Whether you are a redneck, hate rednecks, or just need something to laugh at, this is for you.  It was a very impressive outing for these guys, and an enjoyable evening for the house.  We loved it.Grade: **** out of *****",4,"I'm sitting in a bean bag chair, naked and eating Cheetos!",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2510,"['Friendship', 'essential', 'making', 'troupe', 'work', 'short', 'clips', 'intermingled', 'stand-up', 'obvious', 'four', 'comedians', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'telling', 'other', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'building', 'other', 'hopes', 'better', 'provide', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'audiences', 'shown', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'performances', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'interact', 'other', 'audiences', 'funnier', 'moments', 'film', 'Just', 'see', 'talking', 'other', 'laughing', 'jokes', 'building', 'continual', 'friendship', 'audience', 'laugh', 'more', 'Jen', 'laugh', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'human', 'side', 'soothsayers', 'day-to-day', 'activities.This', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'program', 'watch', 'night', 'where', 'comedy', 'was', 'definitely', 'needed', 'lighten', 'spirits', 'four', 'guys', 'are', 'masters', 'domain', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'least', 'favorite', 'just', 'delivers', 'too', 'quickly', 'less', 'redneck', 'still', 'find', 'laughing', 'together', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'more', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'material', 'see', 'where', 'humor', 'lives', 'Speaking', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'wife', 'were', 'talking', 'how', 'think', 'entire', 'act', 'just', 'act', 'not', 'as', 'redneck', 'instead', 'building', 'reputation', 'true', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'Here', 'building', 'bank', 'account', 'using', 'voice', 'not', 'uncommon', 'here', 'Mountains', 'Virginny', 'Also', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'Ron', 'White', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'humor', 'sharp', 'dark', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'wife', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughter', '95', '%', 'act', 'very', 'impressive', 'can', 'not', 'knock', 'Foxworthy', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'stand-up', 'have', 'heard', 'stand-up', ""n't"", 'changed', 'that', 'much', 'when', 'heard', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'laughed', 'jokes', 'did', 'think', 'may', 'need', 'revamp', 'material', 'especially', 'ultra-classic', 'Might', 'Be', 'A', 'Redneck', 'material.Overall', 'were', 'very', 'impressed', 'program', 'immediately', 'ran', 'out', 'next', 'night', 'get', 'sequel', 'hear', 'laugh', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'redneck', 'hate', 'rednecks', 'just', 'need', 'something', 'laugh', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'outing', 'guys', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'house', 'loved', 'it.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A

I only gave this dvd a mildly supportive rating, since the first two comics, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy were really quite funny and easily held up their end of the foursome.  However, the other two were noticeable drop-offs.  Foxworthy was especially disappointing.  He did not do his regular routine of ""Ya know yur a redneck if...""  A few of these jokes were only done by audience members waiting to enter the theatre.  Those redneck jokes told by the audience were funnier than Foxworthy's set.  I also noticed that he was the least funny one of the four when on camera for the improvisational sections of the movie (at a mall, at a health spa, etc.).  I'm guessing that since he has other videos on his redneck jokes, he was not allowed by contract to those other productions to perform the jokes on this movie.

Ron White is just plain down and out funny. His timing is wonderful, and you don't get what you expect. You do laugh a lot, and you need to put down your beer before he starts talking, lest you blow it out your nose!Bill Engval is the funniest comedian in this line up. If you don't know Bill's work, watch the movie. You will become a fan. His 'Here's your Sign' stuff is funny, but has gotten like Foxworthy's 'You might be a redneck...' However, Bill shines in that he can talk about anything at home, and have you rolling on the floor.I've already heard almost all of the jokes in the movie. Ron White and Larry the cable guy basically do the same jokes they did on the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" CD that came out at the end of 2000. Also, almost all of Bill Engvalls jokes were on that CD or his new comedy CD that came out late last year (""Cheap Drunk: An Autobiography""). Most of Jeff Foxworthys jokes are not on a CD, but if you've seen him live sometime during the last couple of years you've heard almost all of them. Actually, you can say that about all 4 guys.However, if you've never heard of the 4 guys before or if you've heard of them but never seen them live or heard any of their CD's, then definitely go see this movie. The jokes are hysterical. Then you can go and pick up the comedy CD's and see them live. They have new jokes when you see them live.These guys, as a group and as individuals, are not stupid. You don't get to where they are by being idiots, only by portraying them. They know what they are doing.This video is about laughing, about laughing really hard because they talk about things that have happened to us, things we have felt.

751706,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B000094FFA,Blake Kleiner,"[7, 8]","""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is like a gathering of your funniest relatives telling you stories. Even if you don't know these relatives from a hole in the ground, you can identify with the stories they tell and the points they make. The goofy cousins from the great Southern United States are Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. While this isn't a typical family reunion (most of those don't take place in Phoenix, Arizona's Celebrity Theater) these guys have such a connection with their audience that they might as well be talking right to you from across a table.Ron White opens the show with his drunken sarcastic musings that range from televangelist Robert Tilton (a.k.a. the Farting Preacher) to a Texan's views on the death penalty, all the while sipping on a glass of scotch and puffing on a Marlboro. This guy is so funny he'll have you in tears within the first five minutes he's on stage. He has a delivery style that thrives on pitch-perfect pauses in speech that increase the anticipation of and the eventual impact of the punch-line. He's the best of the bunch.Larry the Cable Guy, a relative newcomer on the scene within the last three years, strolls on stage looking like the guy who would secretly live in the camping section of Bass Pro Shops. A flannel shirt with cut off sleeves and a camouflage hat adorned with a fish hook are an outfit only upstaged by a thick Southern accent that you could take a chainsaw to. Larry is not topical, nor are his transitions between subjects smooth, but his jumpy personality keeps him one step ahead of his audience, and he's that much funnier as a result. If you've heard his album ""Lord, I Apologize,"" you'd already know that.Bill Engvall is widely known as the ""Here's Your Sign"" guy. If you don't know him by name, you know him by reputation. He pretty much strikes me as your girlfriend's funny dad. Engvall is a father figure on and off stage. The majority of his comedy revolves around his family. Driving on the road with his sixteen year old daughter, hilarious sexual shenanigans with his wife, and having ""the talk"" with his son.... The list goes on. This is one funny guy.Jeff Foxworthy was the headliner for the tour, and watching him here, more than a decade after ""You Might be a Redneck"" became a household phrase, you can see why. This is a guy who, like Bill Cosby, was made a better comedian by becoming a father. His language never steps out of the bounds of PG and he's twice as funny as he was back when he was cursing like a sailor in truck stops. As much as I love George Carlin, he could learn a few things from Fox, who talks to his audience in such a conversationalist way that he gets you truly involved in his comedy. He plays off his audience's reactions to specific points and expands them back into his material. He is a born comedian, a funny family man with a gift for storytelling, sure to be remembered as one of the all-time great comedians.The true heart of this concert DVD lies in the final encore, when all four comedians perch themselves side by side on stools to tell stories that has made each of them laugh through the years. Larry's sister is covered with moles, they call Ron White ""Tater Salad"" (if you can make it through this story without laughing to the point of tears, you have no sense of humor), Bill Engvall's run ins with stupid lost luggage clerks, and Jeff Foxworthy takes no prisoners with redneck jokes inspired by himself and his three colleagues (on all sides, Ron, Larry, and Bill raise their hands to take credit for their redneck heritage).""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" is just a flat out terrific time. It's good-hearted and consistently hilarious comedy that's clean enough to watch with your kids, your grandparents, and your funny Southern cousins you only see once a year.

751709,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000094FFA,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 6]","Among all the comedies available today, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD ranks number one in the ""must see"" category. Few comedians can find an audience among a broad range of demographic groups, and with varying tastes among individuals, it's quite difficult to find universally entertaining people. But Blue Collar Comedy Tour showcases four stand-up comics of such ability. The stand-up routines are filmed in Phoenix with intermittent features on the exploits of each of the men as they travel the country on their popular comedy tour. Opening up with all four men fishing in a lake, amazingly even the conversations between these men are hilarious and entertaining. What then could we expect when they take the stage? Only the best of modern redneck, working man comedy...One of the rising stars of stand-up, Ron White brandishes his liquor and tobacco drenched persona along with a loveable sarcasm to produce one of the better comic routines of the decade. White chronicles his 9-minute plane ride to Phoenix which almost ended in tragedy when the plane was forced to turn around in mid-flight due to equipment trouble. But the event didn't phase the alcohol-induced outlook of White who advises the passenger next to him (a man who has something to live for, unlike White) that if one engine goes out, the other will take them right to the scene of the crash. And to top it off, they'll beat the paramedics by thirty minutes...White's act is well followed by Larry The Cable Guy, a redneck's redneck who lives by the catchphrase ""Get 'r done!"" Speaking in a redneck dialect that borders on another language, Larry The Cable Guy is a barrel of laughs for any American who loves apple pie. Providing unique insight into the world at large, his audience is presented with the great conundrum of the dog dish water purifier (among other things). Why should he buy a water purifier for an animal that eats its own crap? If you're unfamiliar with this guy's routine, you need to pick up a copy of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD just for him alone (or for that matter - any of these comics merit a full-length DVD by themselves).Beginning the second half of the movie is Bill Engvall, a comic who takes a more well-spoken, family man approach to his routine. I first saw Bill on The Tonight Show when I was ten years old. He delivered the best stand-up routine I've ever seen, and I still remember much of it word-for-word to this day... Central to the routine was his trademark tagline ""Here's your sign"" (referring to a ""stupid sign"" handed out to people who make dumb remarks). Just like his colleague Jeff Foxworthy, Engvall has managed to keep that tagline not only going, but while inventing a hilarious treasure trove of new material. This guy is just plain funny...Rounding out the final one-man routine is Jeff Foxworthy, perhaps the most famous of the crowd due to his widely promoted ""you might be a redneck if..."" jokes. Foxworthy starts off with a standard routine that's really funny (this part of his career has been widely overlooked), but then he naturally moves into the part of the routine that people love to hear - the redneck jokes. My favorite of the whole Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is his line ""If a beaver bites off your nipple, you might be a redneck"". Based on a true story, you simply have to watch Blue Collar Comedy Tour in order to understand just how hilarious that one is...But the funniest part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is when all the comics are finished with their individual routines and they gather together on stage to tell personal stories to the audience. Each story keeps the belly laughs rolling, and each comic has his moments, but Ron White steals this part of the show with his ""tater salad"" story. Recounting the story of his recent drunk in public arrest (he was actually drunk in the bar - they threw him into public), White tells the tale of his rise from a small town in Texas to a life replete with criminal aliases such ""tater salad"" and his fathering of a child named ""tater tot"". You just have to it to really enjoy it!With a host of talented funnymen, the Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD is grade-A entertainment.

Bill Engvall's routine is a little more highbrow and is more of an everyman or ""everyfamily"" comedy routine.  And of course Jeff Foxworthy is well known or his redneck jokes.  All four give very funny performances.The best part of the show, however, was when all four sit down together after each has done their stand-up routine and start telling jokes and stories.  Some of the material is clearly improvised on stage and when all four are together I was practically on the floor laughing.This one is definitely worth several laughs.",4,Funny Stand-Up Comedy,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,970,"['one', 'best', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'features', 'well', 'known', 'redneck', 'comedians', 'Ron', 'White', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'headliner', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy.Ron', 'White', 'alcoholic', 'chain', 'smoking', 'routine', 'short', 'funny', 'lot', 'fun', 'drunks', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'great', 'shtick', 'very', 'heavy', 'exaggerated', 'southern', 'drawl', 'really', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'routine', 'little', 'more', 'highbrow', 'more', 'everyman', 'everyfamily', 'comedy', 'routine', 'course', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'well', 'known', 'redneck', 'jokes', 'four', 'give', 'very', 'funny', 'performances.The', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'however', 'was', 'when', 'four', 'sit', 'down', 'together', 'done', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'start', 'telling', 'jokes', 'stories', 'material', 'clearly', 'improvised', 'stage', 'when', 'four', 'are', 'together', 'was', 'practically', 'floor', 'laughing.This', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'several', 'laughs']",N/A

The other 3 comedians ( Ron White included ) along with Jeff Foxworthy also serve up their fair share of comic lines and laughs.

751741,AV6J6ET05AYEM,B000094FFA,lucifer_sam,"[4, 34]","ah, the blue collar comedy tour. barring one performer, this is a zero star stinker for the ages. but, for the clever and surprisingly fresh performance that ron white delivers i guess this criminally moronic piece of junk deserves one star.as i mentioned before, ron white provides the only genuinely funny moments in this entire movie. his stand-up routine, although largely recycled from his other performances, is actually pretty hilarious in some spots. the now infamous ""they call me tater salad"" story of course ends up later in the movie and, as expected, ron white doesn't fail when he kicks his perfect comedic timing into gear. something about mr. white seems surprisingly gritty and authentic when compared to the cardboard-cutout personas of the other headliners. sadly, it only goes downhill from here.as for larry the cable guy, i'd like to make it known that i live in the south, first of all. and i know for a fact that there is no one, NO ONE, as stupid as larry the cable guy living in the united states. period. he is quite possibly the most annoying comedian to have ever lived, and that's not a joke or an exaggeration. the man's act is an overblown, moronic caricature of every single ""redneck"" stereotype that exists. no subtlety or wit, just groaner after groaner after groaner. it's not that i can't deal with dumb or low-brow comedy (i'm a devotee of south park and beavis and butthead), but larry the cable guy's performance in this movie takes gratingly stupid to the outer reaches of the cosmos. since this guy is basically a religious icon here in north carolina it only makes sense that i can't stand him, seeing as to how every waking moment of my life is filled with dimwits infatuated with him. i hated him even before this movie hit comedy central and gave acne-scarred 15 year olds something to quote once they maxed out their extremely grating and terrible lil' jon and rick james imitations. hearing a chorus of cracking, pre-pubescent voices shouting ""git 'er done!"" every fifteen minutes is a veritable performance piece from hell. i just know this man is going to land me in a shrink's office some day.poor old bill engvall is sandwiched somewhere in this carnival of retardation at some point and delivers a relatively lame, lethargic performance detailing his life as a suburban dad with a daughter. *yawn*. he is by far the most ""normal"" of any of the other performers and as such, he is rather boring in this format. given the choice of nodding off on the couch or covering my ears and banging my head on the coffee table (a condition induced by a certain flannel wearing cable technician) i'll take engvall's sleeping pill any day.up next is the definate creme de la crap, jeff foxworthy. honestly i don't understand why this one trick troglodyte is still around but this performance didn't change my mind one bit except that my desire to see this guy give up on the whole comedy thing and take up snake handling is much more embossed on my consciousness. it's just the same typically asinine jeff foxworthy we've all grown to loathe here, folks. he's second only to larry the cable guy in terms of relying on far-overdone exaggerations of southern culture.if you can make it this far without gouging your eyes out then you're ""treated"" to about 20 minutes of the four comedians bouncing bad jokes off each other. the only reason to stick around for this part is the re-telling of ron white's now famous ""they call me tater salad"" story. otherwise, have fun with your new $18 frisbee. this one is only for people who either huff paint fumes or own toby keith cds.",1,ugh,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,3610,"['ah', 'blue', 'collar', 'comedy', 'tour',

Dillard ""Fulleyes""","[1, 1]","&quot;Blue Collar Comedy Tour&quot; is a documentary about four southern comedians who put on a one night show in Phoenix to finish off their four year tour.  I must say, I did not have extremely high expectations of the film.  I was moderately familiar with Foxworthy's stuff, but did not know much about the other three comedians.  I was pleasantly suprised by this film, and found it to be, for the most part, side-splittingly funny.The film stars off with Ron White, who has a cigarette in one hand, and a drink in the other.  White scores big with some jokes on tubing, and the plane he took on the way to the show.What's intresting about the film is that between acts, it shows the guys earlier when they went to a mall.  They go into stores, such as Victoria's Secret, Spencer's Gifts, and a few others.  This footage is humorous, yet it seems to be staged.  For instance, the Victoria's Secret woman looks as if she know's what's goin on, and plays along without ever a second thought.Next, is Larry the Cable Guy, my personal favorite.  There is something about his accent and the way he tells his jokes that are just hard not to laugh at.Then, Bill Engvall comes on stage.  I found him funny, however not as much so as the other three.  He mostly tried to get laughs telling stories about his 16 year old daughter, and I found that to be sort of boring for a little bit.  However, he did pick up the pace towards the end of his act.Then comes the main event, Jeff Foxworthy.  He is most famous for his &quot;You might be a redneck&quot; jokes.  Foxworthy delivers, with jokes about airport security, and an out-of-body experience for a fish.Then at the end, all four come on stage, and tell stories and some more jokes to finish off the show.&quot;Blue Collar Comedy Tour&quot; is a must-see for comedy fans, or just anyone in the mood for a good time.",4,Very Funny Stuff,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,1862,"['quot', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'quot', 'documentary', 'four', 'southern', 'comedians', 'who', 'put', 'one', 'night', 'show', 'Phoenix', 'finish', 'off', 'four', 'year', 'tour', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'extremely', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'was', 'moderately', 'familiar', 'Foxworthy', 'stuff', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'other', 'three', 'comedians', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'side-splittingly', 'funny.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Ron', 'White', 'who', 'cigarette', 'one', 'hand', 'drink', 'other', 'White', 'big', 'jokes', 'tubing', 'plane', 'took', 'way', 'show.What', 'intresting', 'film', 'acts', 'guys', 'earlier', 'when', 'went', 'mall', 'go', 'stores', 'such', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'Spencer', 'Gifts', 'few', 'others', 'footage', 'humorous', 'be', 'staged', 'instance', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'woman', 'know', 'what', 'goin', 'plays', 'ever', 'second', 'thought.Next', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'personal', 'favorite', 'something', 'accent', 'way', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'at.Then', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'stage', 'found', 'funny', 'however', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'three', 'mostly', 'tried', 'get', 'laughs', 'telling', 'stories', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'found', 'be', 'sort', 'boring', 'little', 'bit', 'However', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'end', 'act.Then', 'main', 'event', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'most', 'famous', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'redneck', 'quot', 'jokes', 'Foxworthy', 'delivers', 'jokes', 'airport', 'security', 'out-of-body', 'experience', 'fish.Then', 'end', 'four', 'come', 'stage', 'tell', 'stories', 'more', 'jokes', 'finish', 'off', 'show.', 'quot', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'quot', 'must-see', 'comedy', 'fans', 'just', 'anyone', 'mood', 'good', 'time']",N/A
