The real  value of this film is the message geared towards the younger audience  members in promoting the value of being able to read and write and thus  communicate thoughts and feelings for the ultimate purpose of righting  wrong and doing good.

70218,A2QA095LQPDBJD,0783241399,Ariel Escasa,"[13, 17]","The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title ""hero,"" would you still rate it highly?If your answer is ""yes,"" then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.I'm not counting on that, though.",2,"The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter",1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,3310,"['first', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'Hurricane', 'was', 'based', 'two', 'books', 'one', 'Sixteenth', 'Round', 'was', 'written', 'Rubin', 'Carter.The', 'second', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'not', 'man', 'exemplary', 'honesty.The', 'third', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'other', 'book', 'Lazarus', 'Hurricane', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'Canadians', 'who', 'bought', 'Carter', 'hokum', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'them.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'point-by-point', 'list', 'patently', 'false', 'claims', 'Carter', 'book', 'other', 'posters', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'Instead', ""'d"", 'like', 'offer', 'reactions', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'are', 'divided', 'three', 'groups.The', 'first', 'composed', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'were', 'taken', 'ride', 'belong', 'group', 'do', 'not', 'fault', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'perpetrating', 'very', 'repugnant', 'deceptions', 'unsuspecting', 'public', 'let', 'ask', 'were', 'presented', 'hard', 'evidence', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'lie', 'put', 'forward', 'title', 'hero', 'would', 'still', 'rate', 'highly', 'answer', 'yes', 'then', 'belong', 'second', 'group', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'thumbs-up', 'basis', 'being', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'drama', 'never', 'mind', 'glaring', 'factual', 'inaccuracies', 'group', 'have', 'say', 'filmmaker', 'present', 'true-life', 'story', 'responsibility', 'see', 'facts', 'right', 'called', 'integrity', 'placing', 'truthfulness', 'far', 'profitability', 'say', 'dramatization', 'not', 'documentary', 'Well', 'even', 'dramatization', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'integrity', 'can', 'go', 'along', 'minor', 'embellishments', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'movie', 'based', 'series', 'disgustingly', 'blatant', 'lies', 'tries', 'pass', 'off', 'true', 'story', 'book', 'unforgivable', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'rival', 'studio', 'went', 'way', 'expose', 'movie', 'dishonesty', 'Vested', 'interest', 'not', 'render', 'arguments', 'invalid.Finally', 'third', 'group', 'who', 'actually', 'believe', 'Carter', 'fact', 'martyr-scholar', 'ask', 'please', 'open', 'eyes', 'absolutely', 'documentation', 'support', 'Carter', 'claims', 'defended', 'friend', 'pedophile', 'was', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'was', 'robbed', 'crucial', 'ring', 'victory', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'proclamations', 'aimed', 'propping', 'up', 'hero', 'image', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'reams', 'documents', 'present', 'virtually', 'irrefutable', 'evidence', 'very', 'proclamations', 'are', 'product', 'one', 'man', 'delusional', 'fantasies', 'say', 'Cal', 'Deal', 'man', 'graphicwitness.com', 'racist', 'Please', 'visit', 'graphicwitness.com', '/carter/racism.html', 'Also', 'know', 'Deal', 'went', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'case', 'actually', 'believing', 'Carter', 'was', 'innocent', 'took', 'just', 'one', 'interview', 'Deal', 'see', 'many', 'glaring', 'inconsistencies', 'Carter', 'statements', 'went', 'uncover', 'numerous', 'documents', 'testimonies', 'exposed', 'Carter', 'liar.Many', 'accounts', 'today', 'have', 'Carter', 'changed', 'man', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'real', 'change', 'not', 'just', 'show', 'whatever', 'case', 'fact', 'public', 'admit', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'lot', 'hogwash.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'counting', 'though']",N/A

70222,A369JF703MA2FP,0783241399,Bruno P,"[29, 37]","I actually give this movie two separate ratings. First, solely as a cinematic and artistic story I give the movie a 4, maybe even a 4.5 but as some of the other reviews have pointed out, there are some very large historical inaccuracies. Here is my review on each:Movie:As a movie ""The Hurricane"" is excellent. Denzel Washington does a great job as do the other actors in this film. It is definitely a tear jerker and helps portray racism which WAS very prevalent during the civil rights movement era. The movie is entertaining and enjoyable, the problem lies with the claim that it is a ""true story."" The best part of the movie is that it exposes horrible corruption,but when that corruption is possibly false, the movie loses credibility. If it had a different title and was described simply as a story, none of these issues would exist.The Facts:I am not a lawyer, or a judge, or anything that has to do with crime. I am an officer in the US Army and hopefully someday a business executive. Therefore, I can not give any ""facts"" regarding the case. Having said that, there is much controversy over what actually happened. It is definitely true that the image of Rubin Carter in real life differs from what is depicted in the movie as well as the image of his friend, John Artis. What the movie doesn't say is that Carter WAS in fact a criminal before he ever was accused of committing the triple murder, one of his crimes being the brutal beating of three people. Additionally, Carter was court marshaled 4 times and was kicked out of the Army after serving only approx 21 months.  After released from prison, friend John Artis was arrested again and convicted for dealing drugs (cocaine.)Artis and Carter were never declared innocent of the murders, they were released from prison due to an error in the judicial process. I do not know whether Carter and Artis are guilty or innocent and I encourage anyone who becomes interested to do their own research. Be careful what site you get your info from...""graphic witness"" for example has been accused of being racist. Check the article about Carter on Wikipedia, it seems more reliable and is from a more trust worthy source.Lastly, we need to remember that there in fact was much racism in this country at the time and to some degree there still is. Often people don't like to admit it. The truth is that racism may or may not have played a part in Carter's trial and he may be innocent, but he may also be guilty. Either way the movie definitely has some factual errors but hey, it's Hollywood, I mean, the true story of U571 is that the British stole the Enigma machine, unlike the film, the American's were no where to be found.Take Hollywood with a grain of salt and enjoy the movie as it is a great piece of entertainment and features some excellent actors giving heart touching performances.",3,Unbiased assessment of the Movie,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2850,"['actually', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'separate', 'ratings', 'First', 'solely', 'cinematic', 'artistic', 'story', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'maybe', 'even', '4.5', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'very', 'large', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Here', 'review', 'Movie', 'movie', 'Hurricane', 'excellent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'great', 'job', 'do', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'definitely', 'tear', 'jerker', 'portray', 'racism', 'WAS', 'very', 'prevalent', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'era', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'problem', 'claim', 'true', 'story', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'horrible', 'corruption', 'when', 'corruption', 'possibly', 'false', 'movie', 'credibility', 'had', 'different', 'title', 'was', 'described', 'simply', 'story', 'none', 'issues', 'would', 'exist.The', 'Facts', 'am', 'not', 'lawyer', 'judge', 'anything', 'do', 'crime', 'am', 'officer', 'US', 'Army', 'hopefully', 'someday', 'business', 'executive', 'Therefore', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'facts', 'regarding', 'case', 'Having', 'said', 'much', 'controversy', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'definitely', 'true', 'image', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'real', 'life', 'differs', 'what', 'depicted', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'image', 'friend', 'John', 'Artis', 'What', 'movie', ""n't"", 'say', 'Carter', 'WAS', 'fact', 'criminal', 'ever', 'was', 'accused', 'committing', 'triple', 'murder', 'one', 'crimes', 'being', 'brutal', 'beating', 'three', 'people', 'Additionally', 'Carter', 'was', 'court', 'marshaled', '4', 'times', 'was', 'kicked', 'Army', 'serving', 'only', 'approx', '21', 'months', 'released', 'prison', 'friend', 'John', 'Artis', 'was', 'arrested', 'again', 'convicted', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'cocaine', 'Artis', 'Carter', 'were', 'never', 'declared', 'innocent', 'murders', 'were', 'released', 'prison', 'due', 'error', 'judicial', 'process', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Carter', 'Artis', 'are', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'do', 'own', 'research', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'site', 'get', 'info', 'graphic', 'witness', 'example', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'racist', 'Check', 'article', 'Carter', 'Wikipedia', 'more', 'reliable', 'more', 'trust', 'worthy', 'source.Lastly', 'need', 'remember', 'there', 'fact', 'was', 'much', 'racism', 'country', 'time', 'degree', 'still', 'Often', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'admit', 'truth', 'racism', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'Carter', 'trial', 'may', 'be', 'innocent', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'guilty', 'way', 'movie', 'definitely', 'factual', 'errors', 'hey', 'Hollywood', 'mean', 'true', 'story', 'U571', 'British', 'stole', 'Enigma', 'machine', 'film', 'American', 'were', 'where', 'be', 'found.Take', 'Hollywood', 'grain', 'salt', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'great', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'excellent', 'actors', 'giving', 'heart', 'touching', 'performances']",N/A

Being dealt the wrong hand in life, he spends half of his life (wrongfully  accused) in jail. I didn't like the directing in the first half of the  movie. The director, Norman Jewison, kept jumping from one time frame to  another, sometimes without you knowing. During the second half of the  movie, it started settling down. It focused more on Hurricane and his  relationship with Lesra and his 3 Canadian tutors. Lesra was inspired by  Hurricane's publicized book. Hurricane befriends Lesra and his 3 tutors. In  fact, they devote their entire lives in trying to prove Hurricane's  innocence. Something that activists, famous actors and musicians failed to  do before them.

""Cole""","[2, 2]","The cinematic achievement, The Hurricane, is an inspiring story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter who is allegedly convicted for a triple homicide.  His journey through prison, his relationship with a boy bent on freeing him, and his subsequent exoneration all intertwine to create a powerful film that sheds light on police corruption, rampant racism, and innocent men locked behind prison bars.  Although the movie provides an entertaining story, the factual side of the story is wrongly portrayed.  Whether it was a move to allow the movie to become more gripping or whether it was a move of ignorance, the film's direction completely walks the line between reality and illusion.  Viewers who are subject to the film without previous knowledge of Carter's actual story may take what is given in the film as fact.  However, even though a disclaimer warns viewers of the fictionalized story, I believe that the film should've altered the story to make it its own, avoiding its warranted criticism.  If this move had been done, the movie would've been able to still stand on its own legs, all the while giving homage to Rubin Carter.Fact and fiction aside, the seamless integration of two separate stories works well.  On one hand, Rubin's life in prison and back-story is explored extensively (albeit subjectively).  On the other hand, Lesra Martin, a fifteen-year-old boy, takes an interest in Rubin and progressively works to exonerate him.  Going back to my previous point, the story of Rubin almost seems subjective and forces the viewer to believe what the film would like the viewer to believe.  I found this frustrating as I would prefer to be able to decide on my own what to accept as true and what to accept as false.  The portrayal of the detective, Della Pesca, seemed to be a figurative ""slap-in-the-face"".  I feel as though his true character in real life probably wasn't so bent on locking up Rubin -- I may be wrong about this, but the film never gave me a chance to make my own opinion.All in all, The Hurricane is a fantastic piece of cinematic power.  The film packs a punch with an unrelenting glimpse into the racial prejudice common amongst Americans during that time period.  Denzel Washington's portrayal of Rubin Carter was haunting and as Washington pleaded with his lawyers, explaining that he had been locked up for thirty years, I received a chill, almost believing every single word the man said.

I have always thought that one of the worst things that can happen to a person is to be sent to prision for a crime they did not commit.  Was Rubin Carter innocent of the crimes he was accused?  I do not know.  The movie would have you believe that every crime he was convicted of he was innocent of.  Is that true?  Again, I don't know.  Was there racial injustices in America in the 1960s?  Of course!  Could this be the reason Rubin Carter spent so many years in jail?

I don't think anyone can deny the power in Denzel's brilliant performance, but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned, it's been judged harshly for it.  I personally don't know the truth behind this mans conviction, his innocence and his quilt, only he knows, but the portrait painted by this film portrays Rubin `The Hurricane' Carter as a victim of a corrupt system.  To me it's a very moving film, regardless if it's true or not, and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom.  Denzel delivers his finest performance here; a well deserved Oscar nomination, and proves that he is a very talented actor.  I am a fan of Denzel, although I've made my concern very clear (the fact that Denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters), and I feel he shines here.  Despite the constant criticism, I feel this is a must-see film, if not for the emotional, albeit somewhat fictionalized (or assumed is a better word since no one really knows), story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved.  Dan Hedeya does a great job as the crooked (fictional) detective who makes it his life goal to punish Rubin for a crime he committed as a child (a crime that should never have been considered a crime) and Vicellous Reon Shannon does wonderfully as Lesra, the young man who not only fights for Rubin's freedom but helps Rubin to regain the hope and life he once had.  Like I said, very heartwarming and touching, and regardless of whether or not Rubin was guilty or innocent, the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from Lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see.",4,"Moving and inspiring, not matter what the final verdict was...",1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1801,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'good', 'lot', 'bad', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'deny', 'power', 'Denzel', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'as', 'far', 'accuracy', 'film', 'concerned', 'been', 'judged', 'harshly', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'truth', 'mans', 'conviction', 'innocence', 'quilt', 'only', 'portrait', 'painted', 'film', 'Rubin', 'Hurricane', 'Carter', 'victim', 'corrupt', 'system', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'regardless', 'true', 'not', 'eyes', 'actors', 'involved', 'truly', 'grips', 'draws', 'mans', 'fight', 'freedom', 'Denzel', 'finest', 'performance', 'here', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'am', 'fan', 'Denzel', ""'ve"", 'made', 'concern', 'very', 'clear', 'fact', 'Denzel', 'times', 'only', 'excel', 'when', 'playing', 'types', 'characters', 'feel', 'here', 'constant', 'criticism', 'feel', 'must-see', 'film', 'not', 'emotional', 'somewhat', 'fictionalized', 'assumed', 'better', 'word', 'one', 'really', 'story', 'then', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Dan', 'Hedeya', 'great', 'job', 'crooked', 'fictional', 'detective', 'who', 'life', 'goal', 'punish', 'Rubin', 'crime', 'committed', 'child', 'crime', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'crime', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'wonderfully', 'Lesra', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'fights', 'Rubin', 'freedom', 'Rubin', 'regain', 'hope', 'life', 'once', 'had', 'said', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'touching', 'regardless', 'not', 'Rubin', 'was', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'basic', 'story', 'fight', 'survival', 'love', 'support', 'received', 'Lesra', 'companions', 'true', 'act', 'human', 'love', 'spirit', 'joy', 'see']",N/A
70236,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0783241399,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 8]","Rubin Carter was wrongfully imprisoned before I was even born, and I'm sure I am one of many who first learned of his shocking case through the telling words of Bob Dylan's song ""Hurricane.""  Dylan was one of many who believed in Carter's innocence and helped raise awareness of the gross injustice he suffered at the hands of the justice system in New Jersey.  I do not know all of the facts in the actual case, but I am aware of the fact that this film does not follow the history of events exactly - it's no secret, as a disclaimer of such appears at the beginning of the movie.  This is not a documentary; it's a moving tale of prejudice, corruption, and hatred ultimately defeated by love, truth, and honor; as such, it captures the heart and spirit of Carter's tragic story in the most powerful of ways.You could call what happened to Rubin Carter a travesty of justice, yet even this term barely begins to explain Carter's plight.  He was tried and convicted of the murder of three individuals in a New Jersey bar in 1967 for two reasons: he was black and he was successful.  He and a fan were heading home in a white car when they were pulled over, hauled over to a murder scene they knew nothing about and then to the hospital to see if anyone could identify them as the murderers - which no one did.  This did not stop the lead detective from arresting and trying them for murder - by suppressing evidence and forging documents, not to mention engineering the false testimony of quite impeachable witnesses, the police and prosecutors got their conviction.  Rubin Carter's boxing career was over, and this man - who could have been the middle-weight champion of the world - found himself looking at three life sentences for a crime he did not commit.Much of this film examines Carter's response to the crushing weight of prison and the repeated denials of his appeals over two decades (somewhat strangely, it mentions but does not dramatize the second trial he managed to get - and lose).  Along the way, we flash back to the important events of Carter's childhood and early adulthood - including some of his overpowering victories in the ring.  Another story converges with Carter's as the movie progresses, though.  A young man from Brooklyn, who has been taken under the wing of three working partners in Toronto - who teach him to read and help him prepare for the college education he longs to have - buys Carter's autobiography at a used book sale - it's the first book he has ever bought.  Reading Carter's story, young Lesra Martin feels a close connection to the man and decides to write him a letter.  A friendship emerges between Carter and Martin, and eventually Martin's Toronto friends and teachers all risk their careers if not their very lives to help Carter win his release from prison.  Even though you know how the story turns out, the final scenes are wondrous moments of cinematic art full of raw emotional power.This movie does run a little long, coming in at just under two and a half hours, but you'll be so absorbed by the story you won't even realize how much time passes.  Denzel Washington does a remarkable job as Ruben Carter, and the supporting cast is stellar as well.  Hurricane affects you across the whole range of emotions: hatred for the crooked cops and prosecutors, disgust with those who not only feel racism but use it as a weapon to subvert justice and ruin a man, growing admiration for Carter as he deals with year upon year of incarceration, deep respect for those who risk their own livelihoods in order to open the eyes of Lady Justice, and the moving joy of hope fulfilled and the eventual triumph of good over evil.  The film may not be historically accurate in all its details, but Hurricane is about as real as it gets.

70238,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783241399,D. Litton,"[3, 4]","&quot;The Hurricane&quot; comes along at the end of a year when movies seemed to be dwindling, and basically saves the day for those looking for an excellent film full of insight, vision, and emotion. It tells a harrowing story that seems to get right to the core of our own spirit and enlighten us when it is all over and done with. The length may be a bit of a test on patience for some, but those willing to stick through it will be tremendously satisfied by the powerful lead and supporting performances, which make up for whatever problems you may have with it.The film tells the story of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, who rose to boxing fame in the 1960's and was wrongly convicted of murder in 1967. The film is all told through his point of view, which gives it a much more personal feeling. Most of the beginning section is composed of flashbacks to his childhood and boxing bouts, moving on in years to his encounter with a young woman and their marriage. One night in a local bar, innocent people are killed, and Rubin and his friend are charged with the murders. While he is in prison, Carter, becomes defiant, refusing to wear the clothes given him by the guards, yet he never flinches when he is punished, and takes his sentence like a true hero.All of this is played to stunning and poignant perfection by Denzel Washington, in one of the best performances of his career. By the end of the movie, he has gone through so much, caused so many people to take a stand in their life, given so much life to the character that we are left with nothing but true respect for his work here. He plays the subject matter with astute authenticity, while adding his own charms and charisma to the part as well. I found myself cheering him on in certain moments, and he is one of the characters that I've cared for most in a movie.As the story progresses into its second half, a young boy by the name of Lezra is introduced. He is living with three Canadians in Toronto, yet it is never stated exactly what they are doing. There is a scene that involves Lezra's parents, but even from that, the true motives of the group is never revealed. Not that this is a hindering factor. Lezra comes across Carter's autobiography in a used book sale, and immediately becomes entranced by the story of Carter's life. He shares his feelings with the Canadians, even writes to Carter, and after a period of exchanging letters, Lezra ventures to Trenton State Prison to visit him.There is a father-son motif here, one that keeps the heart of the movie moving for the final third. Lezra does have a father, yes, but seeing him and Rubin Carter together gives the feeling that he could get along and communicate a lot easier with Carter than his own father. In fact, in the prison, Carter and Lezra have their photo taken, and the photographer mistakes them for father and son. This relationship is built strongly because of Lezra's will to find out the truth behind Carter's arrest and imprisonment, and bring that truth to light. The Canadians help him with this quest, moving to New Jersey in eye view of the prison, where they dig deeper into the archives and talk with people, including Carter's lawyers.There is a great deal of emotion and heart in this story, and even though it is fictionalized, it still tells a compelling narrative. You can't expect every nuance of the plot to be absolutely accurate in terms of what happened in history; the movies never work like that. The best that you can hope for is that they capture the true heart and nature of the events, and that is what &quot;The Hurricane&quot; does here. The story is not solely about a man's imprisonment for murder, but more about his will to survive and make it through a gruesome ordeal. It is also about hope, the hope of one person who envisions helping to free another person of his confines. All of this is captured beautifully and with intense emotion.The acting ability leaves nothing to be desired here. Denzel does an excellent job, and matches that of his acting in &quot;Malcom X.&quot; Lezra is played by Vicellous Reon Shannon, who gives a powerhouse performance with his strength and emotion. The role fits him perfectly, and he plays so well the emotions of a growing teenage boy who is trying to learn about a world full of social hatred and racial segregation. John Hannah, Deborah Unger, and Liev Schreiber portray the three Canadians, who each become fascinated by Carter's story in their own way. These characters are meant to act as a source of comfort for Lezra and inspiration for both he and Carter, while Carter acts as an inspiration for everyone, and they play their parts well.It is not everyday that a movie as emotional and fascinating as this comes along, nor is it very often that we get such powerful acting and terrific plot together in the same movie. Norman Jewison's direction of this film is stellar and rich in supplying emotion, feeling, themes of redemption and reality, and human survival. Carter will always be remembered by those who see this movie, not because of his ordeal, but because of his strength and ability to live through it.",5,Moving and inspired!,983491200,"03 2, 2001",2001,5146,"['quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'along', 'end', 'year', 'when', 'movies', 'seemed', 'be', 'dwindling', 'basically', 'day', 'looking', 'excellent', 'film', 'full', 'insight', 'vision', 'emotion', 'harrowing', 'story', 'get', 'right', 'core', 'own', 'spirit', 'enlighten', 'when', 'over', 'done', 'length', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'test', 'patience', 'willing', 'stick', 'will', 'be', 'tremendously', 'satisfied', 'powerful', 'lead', 'supporting', 'performances', 'make', 'up', 'problems', 'may', 'have', 'it.The', 'film', 'story', 'Rubin', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'Carter', 'who', 'rose', 'boxing', 'fame', '1960', 'was', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'murder', '1967', 'film', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'feeling', 'Most', 'beginning', 'section', 'composed', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'boxing', 'bouts', 'moving', 'years', 'encounter', 'young', 'woman', 'marriage', 'One', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'Rubin', 'friend', 'are', 'charged', 'murders', 'prison', 'Carter', 'defiant', 'refusing', 'wear', 'clothes', 'given', 'guards', 'yet', 'never', 'when', 'punished', 'sentence', 'true', 'hero.All', 'played', 'stunning', 'poignant', 'perfection', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'end', 'movie', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'caused', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'take', 'stand', 'life', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'character', 'are', 'left', 'nothing', 'true', 'respect', 'work', 'here', 'subject', 'matter', 'astute', 'authenticity', 'adding', 'own', 'charms', 'charisma', 'part', 'well', 'found', 'cheering', 'certain', 'moments', 'one', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'cared', 'most', 'movie.As', 'story', 'second', 'half', 'young', 'boy', 'name', 'Lezra', 'introduced', 'living', 'three', 'Canadians', 'Toronto', 'yet', 'never', 'stated', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'scene', 'Lezra', 'parents', 'even', 'true', 'motives', 'group', 'never', 'revealed', 'Not', 'hindering', 'factor', 'Lezra', 'Carter', 'autobiography', 'used', 'book', 'sale', 'immediately', 'becomes', 'entranced', 'story', 'Carter', 'life', 'shares', 'feelings', 'Canadians', 'even', 'Carter', 'period', 'exchanging', 'letters', 'Lezra', 'ventures', 'Trenton', 'State', 'Prison', 'visit', 'father-son', 'motif', 'here', 'one', 'heart', 'movie', 'moving', 'final', 'third', 'Lezra', 'have', 'father', 'yes', 'seeing', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'together', 'feeling', 'could', 'get', 'along', 'communicate', 'lot', 'easier', 'Carter', 'own', 'father', 'fact', 'prison', 'Carter', 'Lezra', 'have', 'photo', 'taken', 'photographer', 'father', 'son', 'relationship', 'built', 'strongly', 'Lezra', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'Carter', 'arrest', 'imprisonment', 'bring', 'truth', 'light', 'Canadians', 'help', 'quest', 'moving', 'New', 'Jersey', 'eye', 'view', 'prison', 'where', 'dig', 'deeper', 'archives', 'talk', 'people', 'including', 'Carter', 'lawyers.There', 'great', 'deal', 'emotion', 'heart', 'story', 'even', 'fictionalized', 'still', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'nuance', 'plot', 'be', 'absolutely', 'accurate', 'terms', 'what', 'happened', 'history', 'movies', 'never', 'work', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'capture', 'true', 'heart', 'nature', 'events', 'what', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'here', 'story', 'not', 'solely', 'man', 'imprisonment', 'murder', 'more', 'will', 'survive', 'make', 'gruesome', 'ordeal', 'also', 'hope', 'hope', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'helping', 'free', 'person', 'confines', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'intense', 'emotion.The', 'acting', 'ability', 'nothing', 'be', 'desired', 'here', 'Denzel', 'excellent', 'job', 'matches', 'acting', 'quot', 'Malcom', 'X.', 'quot', 'Lezra', 'played', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'who', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'strength', 'emotion', 'role', 'perfectly', 'so', 'well', 'emotions', 'growing', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'trying', 'learn', 'world', 'full', 'social', 'hatred', 'racial', 'segregation', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Deborah', 'Unger', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'portray', 'three', 'Canadians', 'who', 'become', 'fascinated', 'Carter', 'story', 'own', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'meant', 'act', 'source', 'comfort', 'Lezra', 'inspiration', 'Carter', 'Carter', 'inspiration', 'everyone', 'play', 'parts', 'well.It', 'not', 'everyday', 'movie', 'emotional', 'fascinating', 'along', 'very', 'often', 'get', 'such', 'powerful', 'acting', 'terrific', 'plot', 'together', 'same', 'movie', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'direction', 'film', 'stellar', 'rich', 'supplying', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'themes', 'redemption', 'reality', 'human', 'survival', 'Carter', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'ordeal', 'strength', 'ability', 'live']",N/A

The resulting chaos this causes in his personal and professional life forces him to accept the irony of his circumstance--him, a man, being harassed by a superior woman--and take her to court, or in this case, arbitration, to save his job. So much controversy was engendered by the plot of this movie and its relationship to the serious issue of sexual harassment (then a fairly new one) that most people ranting on either side about DISCLOSURE's true social significance forgot the actual plot of the movie, and as such, missed its real message: Demi Moore's character was brought to the software company Douglas' character worked for for the sole purpose of getting rid of him in the first place, such that a pretty immoral and essentially illegal business transaction could go through, making the principal stockholders rich. The movie actually begins where the famous sexual harassment subplot ends. Like ERIN BROKOVICH or WALL STREET, DISCLOSURE was not about sex and power, but really a window to the architecture and life-destroying immorality of corporate greed in its entirety.I was slightly put off by some of the publicity surrounding the treatment of the subject matter that is the life of boxer Reuben Carter before this movie came out years ago. But I am still perplexed to the point of amused as to why everyone still rants about every aspect of the film's subject matter but not the actual film itself. Just as people still talk about DISCLOSURE as a sexual harassment irony movie, missing the actual point Michael Crichton was making about the business world, dissenting reviewers have missed the fact that it was a rival movie company's publicity staff who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to see to it that all this historical controversy would make it to the news in time to prevent this movie from winning the many Oscars it probably would have won, without the stink surrounding it. The Oscars have so much money at stake for the studios that could win one for their movie they are almost as political as Washington, D.C.  It wasn't the Smithsonian or Cornel West or Mike Wallace or CNN that broke this story, *it was the corporate greed of Hollywood, Inc. itself, doing so as part of a ruthless and pretty immoral business deal against a competing movie studio*. The very debate of Reuben Carter's actual historicity is as much a symbolically absurd morality play on the corporate greed of Hollywood (and the prevailing ignorance of our culture) as the plot of the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit.This whole topic warrants mentioning only because it is, to this day, the secret architect of the opinions Norman Jewison's treatment of Hurricane Carter --above and beyond the overall message and artistic brilliance of the film as a whole--that is reflected in so many people's opinion of the film.  History itself, if we're going to be honest, is a form of elitist narcisstic mythology more often than not (see the work of Howard Zinn [A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES], Noam Chomsky [UNDERSTANDING POWER], Edward Said [ORIENTALISM], Edward Hermann [THE TERRORIST INDUSTRY], Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed [WAR ON FREEDOM], Gore Vidal [BURR; LINCOLN; PERPETUAL WAR], et. al).  The degree to which ALL history is a lie can be debated until the Exedrin is passed around like cocaine at a suburban garden party; it has little to no bearing on the mythic structure and relevant artistry of great filmmaking--striking at the heart of the actual purpose of history in the first place.Regarding the possible racist unconscious underlying Hurricane Carter's quasi-historical portrayal: by the same token, virtually every movie made in Hollywood before 1978 and God knows how many afterwards, from BIRTH OF A NATION to GONE WITH THE WIND to DRIVING MISS DAISY to FRIDAY AFTER NEXT and beyond, shows the African-American community in such an absurdly one-dimensional and offensively inaccurate light that if we commented only on the historical/social inaccuracies inherent in the depicted subject matter we'd never know what the art form of film actually consists of, let alone what represents it well. MISSISSIPPI BURNING (1988), for example, so enraged Chaney's  family members (of the Shwerner, Goodman and Chaney civil rights activists) that they held many a lecture in many a college regarding its blatant historical inaccuracies; historical inaccuracies obviously designed to whitewash history such that the film would be more palatable to the dominant culture of the Reagan Era 80s (as subtle racist apologia usually attracts liberal white audience for civil rights films and did so quite well during his administration). Yet no one, however, not even them, argued that Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe weren't incredible in it, and probably deserved Oscars nominations for their portrayals.What made me see THE HURRICANE is why everyone should see it. Minor flaws notwithstanding (in construction, not research), director Norman Jewison creates a completely magnificent film. And the incomparable Denzel Washington gives what is undoubtedly the greatest performance of his career. From the very first moment the screen is filled with an image of Denzel as the boxer, you have no choice but to believe him and believe in him. Even the downright eerie way Washington completely became Malcolm X in Spike Lee's masterpiece is SURPASSED by the degree to which he took on and magnified the soul of Rueben Carter. I've seen most of Marlon Brando's work; I've seen James Dean's; I've seen the best of de Niro. I have never seen acting like this before, ever.  The Oscar given to Denzel for his essentially phoned-in performance in TRAINING DAY a year later was as a ""Sorry we screwed you over THE HURRICANE"" Oscar.See this film and believe in the nobility of the human spirit again.",5,The defining performance of Mr. Washington's career; brilliant,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,6029,"['movie', 'DISCLOSURE', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'based',

Films like this are infuriating and should be viewed. Even if the movie is overly long and some parts unnecessary, this tells a true story and exposes the truth that justice can be blind and facts conveniently overlooked. As pointed out in the movie Arlington Road, people feel more safe when they think perpetrators of a crime have been apprehended and convicted. No need to worry about that anymore. This film tells the story of Ruben ""the Hurricane"" Carter who was a champion boxer before he was arrested for and convicted of murder. He spent the majority of his adult life in prison, losing appeal after appeal, until finally a group of people in Canada discover his story, visit him, and decide they are not leaving until Carter is acquitted. Eventually their efforts pay off, but you cannot help but feel angry to see how much of his life was spent needlessly behind bars. And it inevitably leads you to think about the justice system and how many people are wrongfully convicted all the time whether because of corruption of the system or simply by mistake. Or how many people are put to death wrongfully?

70244,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783241399,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 5]","This is a powerful and compelling look at the life of Rubin Hurricane Carter (Denzel Washington) and his highly publicized fight for freedom from imprisonment.  Based on a true story, the film is an in-depth character  study including Carter's early life, the murders for which he was  incarcerated, his coping with prison and his court battles.Veteran  director Norman Jewison creates a tight weave of factors affecting Carter's  life; his childhood, the turbulent civil rights movement of the 1960's, and  the people who came to his defense.  It is an impressive panoply of the  forces that swept over his life like a tidal wave. The period props and  costumes were well done and accurate in the 1960's scenes.  I loved the  fact that all the fight fans in the arena were wearing suits and ties.  Strange as it seems, that's the way it really was in the early 1960's.  The  camera work was very good and I particularly liked the use of black and  white for the fight scenes.  Though he plays fast and loose with the facts,  combining and inventing characters for dramatic effect, the changes do not  substantially detract from the authenticity of the story.  Unfortunately,  Jewison made a few choices that bogged the film down in the middle and  detracted from it.The film presents some good historical footage of the  civil rights movement, but gets a little too preachy at times.  The  character development of Carter and Lesra was good, but the film would have  benefited from a little less of Carter's internment angst and more time in  character development of the Canadians.  Jewison also presented Detective  Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) as an evil character of superhuman proportions, an  inconceivable depiction.This was a superb performance by Denzel  Washington, perhaps his best to date.  His portrayal of the internal  struggle to use his seething anger to help him survive was sensational.  He  got himself into tremendous shape for the boxing scenes and handled himself  well in the ring.I was also impressed with Vicellous Reon Shannon who  played Lesra.  He exuded sincerity, toughness and genuine empathy, and had  very good chemistry with Washington.This strong drama grabs you like a  boa and doesn't let up.  I rated it an 8/10.

It was well worth the price. Excellent movie.The story is with regard to boxer Reuben ""The Hurricane"" Carter, and I can remember the story as it unfolded in the news. It was one of those big (actually, huge) sports scandals in a field known for it's crookedness. Supposedly, this is the true story, but modified somewhat to make it suitable for a movie and I have no way to judge the veracity.  I also have no particular interest in boxing, I might add. The story, as presented, certainly makes for a good tense and emotional movie. Cater had risen from nowhere to become a boxing champion and then was suddenly jailed, tried twice with appeals and sentenced to life imprisonment for a couple night-club murders. He adamantly claimed that he was innocent, but ended up serving over 20 years in a dreary prison until he was finally proved innocent and released. Of course, he not only had a miserable and unjustified 20 years of imprisonment, but totally lost the career of a gifted fighter. And for what? For people who were motivated to lie on the witness stand for hate and racial prejudice.""The Hurricane"" is a gripping story and well told. It'll grab and hold your attention and give a few big tugs at your emotional strings. The movie is well done. The acting is excellent. The filming is dreary, but that's as intended and it fits the situation. I had a bit of difficulty keeping up with all the posted dates in the beginning (it was necessary, I might add) but once the story got underway it ran smoothly with no major breaks.

It is important for you to know that because some of the facts and reactions seem excessive, and yet... It all starts with a bunch of rowdy black kids who run across an older white man, a local personality who starts playing with these boys of ten or eleven and these boys decide to fight against it, probably without knowing what they were fighting against, except that it was not correct to let an older white man touch you if you were a little black boy. Local police and justice officials will go along a road that leads the same boy who is arrested for  molesting  the older man to a triple death sentence for a triple murder that he never committed and that will never be investigated properly. The film is absolutely outstanding because it sets the emphasis on this black man, an ex-world champion in boxing, transcending this fate and getting so high in his meditation that he is truly free in prison and truly divine in his mind. This Hurricane thus set as an example and model to anyone whose freedom is endangered, we can move to the 15 year old black boy from Brooklyn who buys and reads Rubin Carter's book in a booksale for 25 cents. His own life is a series of accidental cicumstances that lead him from deprevation among alcoholics to some achievement in a  host family  in Canada. This black boy, Lesra, identifies with Rubin and gets involved in his case. His Canadian guardians get along with this involvement and they will eventually bring the truth out and convince a federal court that the man is innocent and has to be released from prison immediately. What is important here is how these people react and organize their search and how it succeeds thanks to some nearly immaterial circumstances that go their way and not the simple automatic and habitual way. It is such cases that justify people in thinking there is hope in our societies where the poor cannot have any justice at all because they cannot afford good lawyers from the very start, and later on it is too late : the initial damage can rarely be redeemed, and yet some cases are there to prove it could, even if it does not most of the time.

Juxtaposed with Rubin's story is the story of Lesra, a black child taken to Canada by white do-gooders who becomes encaptured with the story of Rubin Carter and bonds with him.  Lesra begins to communicate with and eventually meet Rubin, and along with his foster family dedicates himself to getting Rubin Carter out of prison.  The white Canadians are initially mistrusted by Rubin, but he soon begins to like and respect them and they eventually compose enough evidence to propose a new trial that ultimately frees him.As can be expected, Rubin Carter's image is polished up for the film (in reality he was booted out of the army after 4 court-martials) and no question is made of his innocence.  As mentioned, the film does not pretend to be a documentary, but some aspects of it annoyed me (did a young Rubin Carter really fend off a pedophile from harassing his friend and ultimately stab the pedophile in order to save his own life?), especially the inclusion of the racist cop, Della Pesca, who pesecutes Rubin from the start of the film to the end (he was a fictitious character, so why include such an annoying plot device?), but this was on the whole a solid film.  6.5/10",4,Decent if unspectacular view of Rubin Carter,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1716,"['possessing', 'many', 'factual', 'discrepencies', 'something', 'others', 'have', 'condemned', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'purport', 'be', 'documentary', '2', 'hours', '25', 'minutes', 'tad', 'long', 'was', 'fairly', 'satisfied', 'overall', 'film.The', 'movie', 'complex', 'unconfusing', 'group', 'flashbacks', 'temporal', 'distortions', 'quickly', 'establishes', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'tragic', 'condition', 'wrongfully', 'arrested', 'persecuted', 'life', 'railroaded', 'justice', 'system', 'incarcerated', 'penitentiary', 'remainder', 'life', 'Juxtaposed', 'Rubin', 'story', 'story', 'Lesra', 'black', 'child', 'taken', 'Canada', 'white', 'do-gooders', 'who', 'encaptured', 'story', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'bonds', 'Lesra', 'communicate', 'eventually', 'meet', 'Rubin', 'foster', 'family', 'getting', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'prison', 'white', 'Canadians', 'are', 'initially', 'mistrusted', 'Rubin', 'soon', 'like', 'respect', 'eventually', 'compose', 'enough', 'evidence', 'propose', 'new', 'trial', 'ultimately', 'him.As', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'image', 'polished', 'up', 'film', 'reality', 'was', 'booted', 'army', '4', 'court-martials', 'question', 'made', 'innocence', 'mentioned', 'film', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'documentary', 'aspects', 'annoyed', 'did', 'young', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'really', 'fend', 'off', 'pedophile', 'harassing', 'friend', 'ultimately', 'stab', 'pedophile', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'especially', 'inclusion', 'racist', 'cop', 'Della', 'Pesca', 'who', 'Rubin', 'start', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'fictitious', 'character', 'so', 'why', 'include', 'annoying', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'whole', 'solid', 'film', '6.5/10']",N/A

He was the top ranked middle weight fighter in the world and considered to be on his way to the next champ. His fighting style leads him to earn the nickname Hurricane. The film opens in 1963 as Rubin fights Emile Griffith, the welterweight champion of the world, and Rubin wins in the first round.Rubin is convicted for a three times life sentence for a triple murder where the victims were shot to death. Rubin wasn't even in the club the night of the murders but he and a friend were stopped as the police were looking for two Negroes in a white car. They are taken to the local hospital. A dying man only half conscious was asked if he could identify Rubin and his friend. Rubin knows the police and one of them hates Rubin and wants to pin the charges on him...This is based on a true story about a man who claimed to be innocent. Worse yet it was the testimony of one of the murder suspects that put him into jail. Rubin had a reputation of being a trouble maker even when he was young. He was arrested as a child for stabbing a man who was trying to molest a friend and trying to throw Rubin down into the falls. His record followed him throughout his life. He was sentenced to a boy's home until he was 21 years old.Denzel Washington does a great job in this movie portraying Rubin Carter. It is a story of a possibly innocent man who served 20 years in prison while in the peak of his life and boxing career. It is a good movie and it is one you should watch.

This film is an insult to the victims' families.  Any film made on this bloody, savage crime should focus on THEM.The victims are only named ONCE, in a matter of seconds, in a courtroom scene.  That is their total screen time, and the value of their lives to these filmmakers.  Using the 'Golden Rule':  Is that the film treatment you would want for YOUR murdered brother, sister, father or mother?The violent murder scene itself, in the bar, is extraordinarily short and sanitary by Hollywood standards.  What happened to the graphic, detailed depictions that are the overwhelming standard in other Hollywood films?  But this gang didn't want an audience reaction to the horrible murders, did they?So, we are told, both in the film and liner notes, that ""three Canadian activists"" take up trying to free Carter, after he'd been found guilty of murder by two lawful juries.  Oddly, we are not told:  WHO is funding the ""activists"" and how do they earn their livings, much less pay all these travel and lawyer expenses?  What are their day jobs?  The ""activists"" last names are never given in the film.  How odd!  Are they all Semitic, too, like many of the filmmakers involved?  Bob Dylan in a singing cameo, Ellen Berstyn marching in protest ...and Carter's lawyer?  The federal judge that this group appeared before?  If there is some common thread there, the viewer should be made aware of it, honestly and upfront.This film does not even come close to making a convincing case that Carter was not involved in the murders of three innocent White people.  Having had two White juries does not mean that Carter was not involved in the bar murders.  Even if there was some element of ""racial prejudice"" in the trial process -- even if that's taken as a given or proven -- that still does not mean that Carter was not involved in the murders, nor exonerate him from the evil crime.  Instead, this propaganda film asks the viewer to believe that, somehow, the ""three Canadian activists"" proved that Carter was INNOCENT (sic), without giving any real evidence to make that argument.In a particularly sad injustice for the families of the dead White victims, the film ends with a quick screen message that the murders of their loved-ones are now officially called ""unsolved.""NEGATIVE stars would be be more appropriate for this film, except for what it tells you about the filmmakers.",1,A Film That Disrespects the D-E-A-D,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,2737,"['complete', 'fluff', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'scale', 'best', 'productions', 'Dr.', 'Goebbels', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Jewison', 'Bernstein', 'Abraham', 'Rosenberg', 'Rivkin', 'Azoff', 'others.The', 'film', 'dishonors', 'memory', 'three', 'law-abiding', 'White', 'citizens', 'pursuing', 'happiness', 'peacefully', 'bar', 'who', 'were', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'two', 'black', 'males', 'film', 'insult', 'victims', 'families', 'film', 'made', 'bloody', 'savage', 'crime', 'should', 'focus', 'THEM.The', 'victims', 'are', 'only', 'named', 'ONCE', 'matter', 'seconds', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'total', 'screen', 'time', 'value', 'lives', 'filmmakers', 'Using', ""'Golden"", 'Rule', 'film', 'treatment', 'would', 'want', 'YOUR', 'murdered', 'brother', 'sister', 'father', 'mother', 'violent', 'murder', 'scene', 'bar', 'extraordinarily', 'short', 'sanitary', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'What', 'happened', 'graphic', 'detailed', 'depictions', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'standard', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'gang', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'audience', 'reaction', 'horrible', 'murders', 'did', 'So', 'are', 'told', 'film', 'liner', 'notes', 'three', 'Canadian', 'activists', 'take', 'up', 'trying', 'free', 'Carter', ""'d"", 'been', 'found', 'guilty', 'murder', 'two', 'lawful', 'juries', 'Oddly', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'WHO', 'funding', 'activists', 'how', 'do', 'earn', 'livings', 'much', 'less', 'pay', 'travel', 'lawyer', 'expenses', 'What', 'are', 'day', 'jobs', 'activists', 'last', 'names', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'film', 'How', 'odd', 'Are', 'Semitic', 'too', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'involved', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'singing', 'cameo', 'Ellen', 'Berstyn', 'marching', 'protest', 'Carter', 'lawyer', 'federal', 'judge', 'group', 'appeared', 'common', 'thread', 'there', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'honestly', 'upfront.This', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'making', 'convincing', 'case', 'Carter', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'murders', 'three', 'innocent', 'White', 'people', 'Having', 'had', 'two', 'White', 'juries', 'not', 'mean', 'Carter', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'bar', 'murders', 'Even', 'was', 'element', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'trial', 'process', 'even', 'taken', 'given', 'proven', 'still', 'not', 'mean', 'Carter', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'murders', 'exonerate', 'evil', 'crime', 'Instead', 'propaganda', 'film', 'viewer', 'believe', 'somehow', 'three', 'Canadian', 'activists', 'proved', 'Carter', 'was', 'INNOCENT', 'sic', 'giving', 'real', 'evidence', 'make', 'particularly', 'sad', 'injustice', 'families', 'dead', 'White', 'victims', 'film', 'quick', 'screen', 'message', 'murders', 'loved-ones', 'are', 'now', 'officially', 'called', 'unsolved', 'NEGATIVE', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'film', 'what', 'filmmakers']",N/A

I thought it would be a boring time-waster for me and a couple of friends to sit through just to waste a couple of hours of the day. But, I was wrong. I found myself enthralled in the dramatic events of The Hurricane, and it was a pleasant surprise.The film tells the true story of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter (Denzel Washington), an African-American man who rose above his troubled youth to become a top contender for the middle-weight boxing title. However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy, Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.It may sound boring, but this is an engaging story that is superbly acted by a group of talents; Denzel Washington most notably as Rubin, his performance burns in memory, and is one of the most believable portrayals of a hero in recent memory. The supporters aren't a touch bad either; Vicellous Reon Shannon gives an impressive role as our hero's supporter, while John Hannah and Deborah Kara Unger are both watchable and rightly cast. Director Norman Jewison's view of race and African-American life is quite stunning, and he gives the film a real backbone.An underrated little gem, The Hurricane, if not perfect, remains continuously watchable and should be seen by all who enjoyed Jewison's previous efforts.",4,Believable and nicely captured true story,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1890,"['HurricaneScore', '84/100This', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'time-waster', 'couple', 'friends', 'sit', 'just', 'waste', 'couple', 'hours', 'day', 'was', 'wrong', 'found', 'enthralled', 'dramatic', 'events', 'Hurricane', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise.The', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'Rubin', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'Carter', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'African-American', 'man', 'who', 'rose', 'troubled', 'youth', 'become', 'top', 'contender', 'middle-weight', 'boxing', 'title', 'However', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'when', 'accused', 'triple', 'murder', 'convicted', 'three', 'natural-life', 'terms', 'becoming', 'cause', 'celebre', 'dogged', 'efforts', 'prove', 'innocence', 'autobiography', 'years', 'fruitless', 'efforts', 'have', 'left', 'discouraged', 'when', 'African-American', 'boy', 'Lesra', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'Canadian', 'mentors', 'read', 'book', 'are', 'convinced', 'innocence', 'enough', 'work', 'exoneration', 'However', 'what', 'Hurricane', 'friends', 'learn', 'fight', 'racist', 'establishment', 'profited', 'travesty', 'have', 'intention', 'seeing', 'reversed.It', 'may', 'sound', 'boring', 'engaging', 'story', 'superbly', 'acted', 'group', 'talents', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'most', 'notably', 'Rubin', 'performance', 'burns', 'memory', 'one', 'most', 'believable', 'portrayals', 'hero', 'recent', 'memory', 'supporters', 'are', ""n't"", 'touch', 'bad', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'impressive', 'role', 'hero', 'supporter', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'are', 'watchable', 'rightly', 'cast', 'Director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'view', 'race', 'African-American', 'life', 'quite', 'stunning', 'film', 'real', 'backbone.An', 'underrated', 'little', 'gem', 'Hurricane', 'not', 'perfect', 'continuously', 'watchable', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Jewison', 'previous', 'efforts']",N/A

It is the true story of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, and how he was put in jail for a murder he didn't commit.  The boxer's autobiography, called &quot;The Sixteenth Round&quot;, soon began selling, and it had a strong influence on a young highschooler by the name of Lesra Martin.  Lesra and his caretakers then go through a long, exhausting battle for justice in order to set the boxer free.This film has a nearly perfect script, with some of the best movie quotes ever, like &quot;Hate put me in prison, love's gonna bust me out&quot;, &quot;I have committed no crime, crime's being committed against me&quot;, &quot;I'll always be The Hurricane, and The Hurricane is beautiful&quot;...okay, I'll stop there.Another great aspect: the acting!  Denzel Washington is absolutely stunning in the lead role.  He really knows how to be very emotional during very emotional scenes.

This emotional story pits him at a high ranking for some of the best acting in his career.  The problem with this film is its predictability, regardless of hearing this story before, its false characters, and its overlong plot which could've been shortened up.Another problem with this film is how it flashes back in time, back further, and back, then back to reality.  The beginning is just Denzel getting all ready like he's going out to the ring, (in his prison cell), saying- &quot;Come on.  I'll take you all on... I won't take no sh-t.&quot;  Then we go back to his boxing career, and da da da da.  It bothered me.This drama shifts both to pros and cons uprises and downfalls.  Partly because you feel so bad for this man who's been in prison over half of his life simply because of racism.  Yet, this story is profound and doesn't have any means to leave you with sad boredom.  It's an epic story of friendship and never giving up when the impossibilities seems greater than ever.  It ends in a solid, regardless of how drawn out the film is.There is fire, there is fury, there is a powerhouse performance from Denzel Washington, there is drama- there is nothing to back it up...  The slowness and confusion of where we are in time will detract from this film and you may enjoy it, but you will still have seconds thoughts in the back of your mind.  And for those of you who know the story anyways- there isn't much point in seeing the movie, because the film is very fictionalized.  Try reading Rubin's book, or read biography and/or documentrary.

70275,A10Y596I3SL84S,0783241399,"M Darrow ""therekloose""","[1, 2]","The Hurricane is a gripping cinematic experience and not a historic biopic that uses all of its resources to research and accurately present an event or topic (as a point of fact, films that do the latter are usually devoid  of any real substance - Titanic (obviously not true) is an example of a  film that worries more about meticulously recreating a historic event but  can't tell a story to save its life).That being said, there are many  things about the film that just plain don't work.  The villainous police  lieutenant was an irritatingly shallow character and as a rule, I typically  despise films that have villains who perpetrate evil acts for reasons that  do not benefit themselves.  But, I don't view the Hurricane as a film that  is just about overcoming wrong done against Carter by outside forces.  It  is more about the war that wages within and this perfectly displayed in  Washington's emotionally bruising performance.  The three Canadian figures  were equally shallow except benevolent and I was also concerned with how  the story completely dropped the young man convicted with Carter except for  one minute later in the film.With all these complaints, I can barely  explain why I found The Hurricane so effective and moving.  The best I can  offer is how the film (rather didactically at times) dealt with two  contrasting emotions:  the rage and hatred that had consumed Carter's life  and the simple joy that came from having one single person who offered his  belief.  The complete scene of Lesra's first visit (from the visitor's  lining up, the prisoners being strip searched to the visitors leaving) was  the best of the film.Whatever made The Hurricane effective to me, it  certainly was not the idea that it was a true story.  But I would like to  address the issues that were brought up in earlier reviews.  The fact that  Rubin Carter was not that great a boxer was something I suspiciously felt  upon first viewing the trailer (since I never heard of him) so I never  offered one iota of belief to that notion.  As to whether or not Carter is  a &quot;good&quot; person, I don't know where to begin.  Being court  martialed is in no way a measure of this, especially a black soldier in  those days.  Jackie Robinson was court martialed as was my grandfather and  half his unit.  They routinely held black soldiers up to stricter codes of  behavior for whatever reason.  Failing a lie detector test means nothing  for one important legal reasons.  Someone can't be forced to take one,  meaning that we know if someone takes a polygraph, they must have  volunteered.

I remeber 2  of my answers; one was Harrison Ford and the other Denzel Washington. While  Ford has had a string of mediocore roles of late, Denzel continues to prove  why he's a real &quot;heavyweight&quot; in movies! His performance in the  Hurricane only re-inforces my beleif!Not only does he turn in a performance  that was well worthy of oscar nomination in 99,much like the fury and  passion he showed in Malcom X, but he rose above what I would have to call  the less than superb writing in this film. He gave a truly emotionally  stirring performance, first in his breakdown in his prison cell, to the  hardening of his will in order to serve his sentence, to his reluctant  acceptance of help from outsiders in his bid for freedom.The story itself  seems a bit contrived, although supposedly based on true events. Except for  washington's performance, it would come off as just another &quot;hopeless  cause overcomes&quot; movie ( my apologies to Leiv Schreiber who was also  &amp; always wondeful).What really strikes me, however, is how this film  confirms the old adage of the more this change the more they stay the  same.In our so called enlightened society, we seem to still be plagued by  the same prejudices that pervaded 60's Patterson NJ.One last thing that  bothers me is that I saw Denzel Washington having to defend himself from  outraged viewers while promoting this movie! While I would never condone  the freeing of a guilty man, it is an actors choice to chose any role they  want to portray, regardless of their own feelings and popular opinion.  That's their job. If people didn't beleive in the content of this movie  then they should've banned or boycotted, not bothered the actors.

70283,A1HAL6ZQ8MUJSD,0783241399,mr_bunghole,"[1, 1]","First things first, the most important feature of this movie is Denzel Washington's absolutely magnificent portrayal of Rubin Carter.  Every facial expression wrings true heartfelt emotion that just jumps off the screen.  The supporting performances are good too, particularly Rod Steiger's judge, Dan Hedaya's snarly detective Della Pesca (a fictionalized composite character) and Vicellous Reon Shannon's performance as Lesra Martin.  The movie also has an incredible story to boot, one about love, racial prejudice, incredible misfortune and the elusive dim ray of hope that maybe one day, Carter will return to the normal life he deserves.  Norman Jewison squeezes every single drop of melodrama from the story, and the result is 150 of the most captivating minutes of film you're likely to come across this year.  That said, the makers obviously took some liberties in the making of the movie, often polarizing the characters to make them seem better (Carter) or worse (Della Pesca) than in real life.  The movie never makes mention that Carter was found with a shotgun in the trunk when he was arrested for the triple murder.  It also claims that Carter spent his childhood in juvenile hall for a single stabbing incident, when the reality is that he went in on several occasions for robbery convictions.  These differences are all in the name of pure dramatic bliss, however, and although the movie is a little lacking in the humour department, I can guarantee you'll feel better when the movie is finally done.

As others have hypothesized, Denzel's win for &quot;Training Day&quot; was a reward for Academy oversights for earlier tremendous performances...and his work in &quot;The Hurricane&quot; ranks as one of his best.Besides the work of Washington, the film benefits from marvelous turns from co-star Vicellous Reon Shannon as a young man enamored of the boxer and determined to right the wrong that has befallen Carter. The young man possesses the right amount of &quot;wide-eyed innocence&quot; as he confronts a man that he discovers in a long-forgotten autobiography. Who cannot be moved when man and boy share a tender moment by touching through the bars of the convict's cell???This kid deserved a supporting acting nod, if nothing less.And a film that sports such stellar character performers as Rod Steiger, Debbi Morgan, Dan Hedaya, Harris Yulen, Clancy Brown, and David Paymer is a cut above the others. Liv Shrieber, Deborah Unger, and John Hannah are wonderful as Canadians that assist Shannon's &quot;Lesra&quot; as the lad works to free his friend.While there are a few slow moments, the overall film is worth viewing...and owning.",5,&quot;And the Oscar goes to...&quot;,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1536,"['Well', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Washington', 'breathtaking', 'performance', 'biopic', '2000', 'Washington', 'very', 'essence', 'different', 'modes', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'Carter', 'man', 'wrongly', 'incarcerated', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Washington', 'superbly', 'various', 'sides', 'most', 'complex', 'man', 'anger', 'defiance', 'reflection', 'intelligence', 'humility', 'perseverance', 'others', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'Denzel', 'win', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'was', 'reward', 'Academy', 'oversights', 'earlier', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'work', 'quot', 'Hurricane', 'quot', 'one', 'best.Besides', 'work', 'Washington', 'film', 'benefits', 'marvelous', 'turns', 'co-star', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'young', 'man', 'enamored', 'boxer', 'determined', 'right', 'wrong', 'befallen', 'Carter', 'young', 'man', 'right', 'amount', 'quot', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'quot', 'man', 'long-forgotten', 'autobiography', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'when', 'man', 'boy', 'share', 'tender', 'moment', 'touching', 'bars', 'convict', 'cell', 'kid', 'deserved', 'supporting', 'acting', 'nod', 'nothing', 'film', 'sports', 'such', 'stellar', 'character', 'performers', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Debbi', 'Morgan', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'Harris', 'Yulen', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'David', 'Paymer', 'cut', 'others', 'Liv', 'Shrieber', 'Deborah', 'Unger', 'John', 'Hannah', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Canadians', 'assist', 'Shannon', 'quot', 'Lesra', 'quot', 'lad', 'free', 'friend.While', 'are', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'overall', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'owning']",N/A

70293,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,0783241399,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 7]","I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane.  His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust:  accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career.I thought that Denzel Washington was absolutely brilliant, bringing an entire environment and life story with him in each scene as only great actors can do.  He is perhaps the greatest actor in America today.  This performance is one of his best - you sense his internal struggle to survive, with little of it stated directly.  And he grows throughout the film, from a battered youth into a hyper-disciplined athlete, and then as an inmate seeking deeper meaning in life.  It is truly amazing how well he pulls this off.Then there is the youth who contacts him, a boy from a similar background who is given a chance by a remarkable and unorthodox household.  For some reason, the Hurricane responds to him after ignoring many others, and these two - as well as his foster parents - embark on their own journey of discovery.  As the youth matures, he learns about the political system and feels empowered to change things. That is a profoundly healthy of the American political system.  Eventually, they do change things, which is also a big step of trust and engagement for the Hurricane.  It is really beautiful and uplifting, deeply moving as I identified with both characters.I now want to learn about the protagonists, perhaps in biographies.  The story goes to the heart of an America in transition, when I grew up.  I do not know enough to answer the critiques about his character by other reviewers.While I think that more details should have been included in the film, the drama is taut and well told in my view.  It is a completely successful film experience and I am sure I will introduce this to my children when they are ready to learn about race in America.  FOrtunately, the racial tensions are infinitely less acute than when I grew up, so much of this will be historical for them.Warmly recommended.",5,superb historical drama on redemption and coming of age,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2105,"['watched', 'total', 'absorption', 'plight', 'unusual', 'man', 'Hurricane', 'story', 'others', 'outlined', 'reviews', 'here', 'very', 'sad', 'unjust', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'racist', 'cop', 'odd', 'hatred', 'thrown', 'prison', 'height', 'career.I', 'thought', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'bringing', 'entire', 'environment', 'life', 'story', 'scene', 'only', 'great', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'actor', 'America', 'today', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'sense', 'internal', 'struggle', 'survive', 'little', 'stated', 'directly', 'film', 'battered', 'youth', 'hyper-disciplined', 'athlete', 'then', 'inmate', 'seeking', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'life', 'truly', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'off.Then', 'youth', 'who', 'boy', 'similar', 'background', 'who', 'given', 'chance', 'remarkable', 'unorthodox', 'household', 'reason', 'Hurricane', 'responds', 'ignoring', 'many', 'others', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'foster', 'parents', 'embark', 'own', 'journey', 'discovery', 'youth', 'political', 'system', 'feels', 'empowered', 'change', 'things', 'profoundly', 'healthy', 'American', 'political', 'system', 'Eventually', 'do', 'change', 'things', 'also', 'big', 'step', 'trust', 'engagement', 'Hurricane', 'really', 'beautiful', 'uplifting', 'deeply', 'moving', 'identified', 'characters.I', 'now', 'want', 'learn', 'protagonists', 'perhaps', 'biographies', 'story', 'heart', 'America', 'transition', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'enough', 'answer', 'critiques', 'character', 'other', 'reviewers.While', 'think', 'more', 'details', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'drama', 'taut', 'well', 'told', 'view', 'completely', 'successful', 'film', 'experience', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'introduce', 'children', 'when', 'are', 'ready', 'learn', 'race', 'America', 'FOrtunately', 'racial', 'tensions', 'are', 'infinitely', 'less', 'acute', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'historical', 'them.Warmly', 'recommended']",N/A
70294,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0783241399,Roland E. Zwick,"[31, 34]","The most startling revelation about Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane' is that this true-life account of middleweight champion Ruben `Hurricane' Carter turns out to be more about the glories of writing than of boxing. In  fact, almost no time at all in the film is dedicated to chronicling the  details of Carter's fighting career but rather to the attempts made by him  and others on his behalf to prove his innocence in a murder case that  resulted in his serving a nearly 20-year long prison sentence.The  sympathies of the filmmakers clearly lie with Carter, although a number of  people have, since the release of the film, challenged some of the film's  reliability and veracity. As one completely unacquainted with the facts of  the case as they initially played themselves out, I am certainly in no  position to adjudge the authenticity and accuracy of the film. As a piece  of drama, however, `The Hurricane' generates an impressive amount of  interest in the viewer and even attains emotional greatness in a few  scenes. Because the film is trying to come at the story from so many  different angles, it occasionally feels a bit like a patchwork - part  boxing film, part prison drama, part investigative thriller, part  inspirational feel-good drama - rather than a completely unified work of  art. And, understandably, the film is more successful in some of those  areas than in others.The first half of the film is pretty standard issue  stuff. We get, perhaps, a somewhat overly sketchy portrayal of the events  in Carter's life before the fateful night in Paterson, NJ when he found  himself the prime suspect at a murder scene. We see Carter as an 11-year  old boy getting in trouble with the law for defending himself against a  pedophile who turns out to be a well-respected and highly placed figure in  the local community. This incident introduces him to the Paterson sergeant  (Dan Hedaya) who plays the Javert to Carter's Jean Valjean, dedicating his  life to seeing that Carter never lives his life outside prison, hounding  him out of a misguided sense of self-righteous zeal - an obsession  aggravated by the galling fact that Carter has since gone on to achieve  international notoriety in the ring. As in many of the early sections of  the film, the writers Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon fail to portray the  incidents in Carter's life in a well-rounded, totally believable way. We  find it hard to understand just why this one black child - among a vast  number in Paterson one presumes - would fire up this sergeant's passion so  intensely. We also are rushed along through Carter's early stints in  prison, his time in the military, his rise to fame in the boxing world,  sometimes with little more than voice-over excerpts from Carter's novel to  inform us of how much he has learned and changed from his experiences. The  script is so jumpy at times that we never feel we get to know much about  the young Carter at all.Luckily for us, this is not all there is to `The  Hurricane.' The writers and director wisely enlarge the canvas of their  story to include the teenager, Lesra Martin, whose contact it was with  Carter, languishing almost forgotten in prison, that ultimately set the  wheels of justice rolling that would lead to Carter's eventual release. And  herein lies the real emotional core of the story. Lesra, a near-illiterate  inner city boy from Brooklyn, living with some benevolent white liberals in  Canada, purchases an old copy of the autobiographical best-selling novel  Carter wrote in prison - the first book Lesra has ever read - and becomes  so caught up in the similarities to his own life pouring off the pages that  he decides to write to Carter in prison. A warm relationship develops  between the aging convict and the budding youngster which eventually leads  to Lesra's introducing Carter to his mentors who then take up the cause of  getting Carter's case overturned. The highlight of the film is clearly the  mesmerizing, emotionally riveting first encounter between Lesra and Carter;  we sit spellbound as the two hurting individuals grope tentatively towards  one another, each seeking that connection with (and recognition from) the  other on the common ground of their parallel life experiences that they  need so desperately. As the two discuss the liberating effect their writing  has on both of them, the film becomes a glorious paean to the power and  might of the written word. It is a truly unforgettable  scene.Unfortunately, the film only achieves that gripping emotional  power a few times afterwards and in each occasion it is the connection  between Lesra and Carter that brings it about. The three Canadian activists  who take on the case for Carter's innocence remain underdeveloped as  characters. We wonder how they can afford to leave their jobs in Canada and  dedicate themselves exclusively to Carter's cause. And why are they always  together? Do they have any other relationships in their lives or have they  taken a vow of celibacy to go along with their social crusading? Their  successful attempts to unravel the mystery of what really happened on that  night in 1966 are interesting on the level of historicity but these  sequences weaken the emotional drama at the film's core. Since we do not  get to know these characters as fully fleshed-out human beings, we watch  these scenes with an attitude of detached disinterest rather than intense  emotional involvement Perhaps, the story of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter is too  diverse a one to be successfully encapsulated even in a film that runs an  impressive 146 minutes.I realize, of course, that I have not yet  mentioned Denzel Washington's impressive performance as Carter. He  literally holds the film together since there is virtually no scene in  which he is not present. This tour-de-force role allows him to run the  emotional gambit from sullen rage and explosive fury to warmhearted  tenderness and stoic idealism (and how many 40-something actors could still  convincingly portray a man in his early '20's)? Equally impressive, though,  is young Vicellous Reon Shannon's work as the disadvantaged but ever  idealistic Lesra. Together these two extraordinary actors take `The  Hurricane' to impressive emotional heights. This is their film all the way  and it undoubtedly does `The Hurricane' himself proud.",4,flawed but powerful drama,964742400,"07 28, 2000",2000,6366,"['most', 'startling', 'revelation', 'Norman',

The depitction is another lie.Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder.

As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this.

70300,A1NRHJW5X9COX,0783241399,Scrivener,"[6, 9]","The Evil Cop, played by Dan Hedaya, will remind more literate viewers of Javert, which should place several seeds of suspicion about this movie.  Quite obviously Jewison is familiar with famous French literature, which is  great!  but what works in literature can seem dubious in an enterprise  which purports to be even a RELATIVELY truthful retelling of incidents  which occurred in Real Life.  Hedaya's cop must be one of those  &quot;composite&quot;  characters we're warned about before the picture  starts -- this character seems totally unrealistic, a hack writer's  concoction.  I seriously doubt that a  (presumably)  world-weary Jersey cop  would have the time or energy to carry on such a senseless personal grudge  over one youthful offender -- and the word  &quot;racist&quot;  doesn't  explain it away, either.  As portrayed here, this a totally PERSONAL  antagonism against Carter.  The question is:  why?  Jewison declines to  answer.  In any case, it doesn't make much sense.  Another big problem is  the handling of the Canadians.  These are strange people:  why do two men  and one women live together?  What is this -- &quot;Three's Company&quot;?  How do they live so well, and how did they support themselves while  investigating Carter's case?  Why did they adopt a kid they barely knew?  They're like little white angels from the Great White North, improving the  lives of everyone they meet.  I know there's more to their story than  what's presented here, but Jewison again declines to get into it.  The real  story would've been nice.Having said all that, I must also say that even  though I'm giving this picture only 2 stars, I'm also recommending it  because of the astonishing performance by Denzel Washington.  Never mind  Rubin Carter's story for just a minute:  if you need any more proof that  racism is alive and well in this country, consider Washington's being  passed over for Best Actor in favor of Kevin Spacey in  *American Beauty*.  Spacey larked about quite amusingly in that film, but COME ON.  Rubin  Carter was 30 times the more difficult role, and Washington bravely  succeeded in not only doing it well but doing it unforgettably.  Never has  dignity been better presented on screen.  It's a crime that there isn't an  Oscar gathering dust on his mantle.  Like most guys I pride myself on not  crying in movies that are trying to choke you up, but some of Denzel's  scenes dragged forth more than one tear out of this kid's eyes, I can tell  you.Therefore I suggest that you see this film for an incredibly moving  performance.  But if you want a straighter story about Rubin Carter's case,  read any number of books that have been written about him -- I've not read  them, but I'm hoping they get closer to the truth than what's presented  here.  For that matter, listen to Dylan's tune on the subject -- he makes a  more detailed, compelling case for Carter's innocence than this movie does.",2,Les Miserables?,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2942,"['Evil', 'Cop', 'played', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'will', 'remind', 'more', 'literate', 'viewers', 'Javert', 'should', 'place', 'several', 'seeds', 'suspicion', 'movie', 'Quite', 'obviously', 'Jewison', 'familiar', 'famous', 'French', 'literature', 'great', 'what', 'literature', 'can', 'seem', 'dubious', 'enterprise', 'be', 'even', 'RELATIVELY', 'truthful', 'retelling', 'incidents', 'occurred', 'Real', 'Life', 'Hedaya', 'cop', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'quot', 'composite', 'quot', 'characters', ""'re"", 'warned', 'picture', 'character', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'hack', 'writer', 'concoction', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'presumably', 'world-weary', 'Jersey', 'cop', 'would', 'have', 'time', 'energy', 'carry', 'such', 'senseless', 'personal', 'grudge', 'one', 'youthful', 'offender', 'word', 'quot', 'racist', 'quot', ""n't"", 'explain', 'away', 'either', 'portrayed', 'here', 'totally', 'PERSONAL', 'antagonism', 'Carter', 'question', 'why', 'Jewison', 'answer', 'case', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'big', 'problem', 'handling', 'Canadians', 'are', 'strange', 'people', 'why', 'do', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'women', 'live', 'together', 'What', 'quot', 'Three', 'Company', 'quot', 'How', 'do', 'live', 'so', 'well', 'how', 'did', 'support', 'investigating', 'Carter', 'case', 'Why', 'did', 'adopt', 'kid', 'barely', 'knew', ""'re"", 'like', 'little', 'white', 'angels', 'Great', 'White', 'North', 'improving', 'lives', 'everyone', 'meet', 'know', 'more', 'story', 'what', 'presented', 'here', 'Jewison', 'again', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice.Having', 'said', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'even', ""'m"", 'giving', 'picture', 'only', '2', 'stars', ""'m"", 'also', 'recommending', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Never', 'mind', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'story', 'just', 'minute', 'need', 'more', 'proof', 'racism', 'alive', 'well', 'country', 'consider', 'Washington', 'being', 'passed', 'Best', 'Actor', 'favor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', '*American', 'Beauty*', 'Spacey', 'larked', 'quite', 'amusingly', 'film', 'COME', 'ON', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'was', '30', 'times', 'more', 'difficult', 'role', 'Washington', 'bravely', 'succeeded', 'not', 'only', 'doing', 'well', 'doing', 'unforgettably', 'Never', 'dignity', 'been', 'better', 'presented', 'screen', 'crime', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'gathering', 'dust', 'mantle', 'most', 'guys', 'pride', 'not', 'crying', 'movies', 'are', 'trying', 'choke', 'up', 'Denzel', 'scenes', 'dragged', 'forth', 'more', 'one', 'tear', 'kid', 'eyes', 'can', 'tell', 'you.Therefore', 'suggest', 'see', 'film', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'performance', 'want', 'straighter', 'story', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'case', 'read', 'number', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'written', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'get', 'closer', 'truth', 'what', 'presented', 'here', 'matter', 'Dylan', 'tune', 'subject', 'more', 'detailed', 'compelling', 'case', 'Carter', 'innocence', 'movie']",N/A
70301,ABE14SVILZLNY,0783241399,"SID ""Punk""","[2, 5]","Every once and a while a film comes out that moves you on a deeply emotional and personal level. If you are fortunate, the cinematic experience stays with you beyond the drive home after the credits have roled. ""The Hurricane"" is one of these rare films that manages to inspire, and affect the viewer in a manner far too films fail to do. The cut I saw of Hurricane was missing the final credits and the colour had yet to be corrected, but the film was and is a masterpiece of storytelling by the acclaimed Norman Jewison. Like many of his films there is a deeply personal story to be told that has far reaching moral, political and social implications. ""Hurricane"" is the story of Rueben ""Hurricane"" Carter, a boxer wrongly imprissoned for a crime he didn't committ. The story unfolds from two perspectives, Rueben's and from the perspective a boy named Lazarus, who in Carter, finds a hero in need of salvation. Denzel Washington is memorizing in his role as Hurricane, while the rest of the cast have risen to the occasion. Jewison has made perhaps his best film in decades and maybe his best ever. His committment to telling ""a good story"" (quoting last year's inspiring Oscar speech) is obvious, as his is committment to social consciousness. He uses the camera as a witness to brutality, history and to one man's salvation and redemption as he explores the life and circumstances that brought Carter and Lazarus together. Like movies such as ""Chariots of Fire"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Amistad"", this film manages to involve the viewer on a highly personal level. We see Carter as a human being in circumstances that test him beyond reason. The scene where he tells his wife to leave him because he can't survive prison knowing she is waiting for him on the outside is powerful and moving. This film is worthy of Oscars in every way. As it stands, this film is a credit to the real Hurricane Carter and the journey he took, and to Lazarus who becomes the catalyst in bringing Carter to salvation. With a running time of almost two and a half hours, I suspect it will be a bit shorter when released, but hopefully Jewison and co. will leave most of it as is. Don't let them make you change a thing Norman - you've got a real story here and a fabulous tribute to the power of the human spirit (from two perspectives no less!)

70306,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,0783241399,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[0, 1]","I've read most of the reviews here and either they are unwaveringly convinced of former boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter's guilt, or staunchly believe in his innocence to the point of ad nauseam. Others didn't care for the movie for whatever reason, while you had an audience who loved this story, didn't know it was a fictionalized account of the events and simply didn't care because they feel Denzel Washington can do no wrong. However, the review I found to be most on point about this movie is one that was written by Bruno P on March 2, 2006: ""Unbiased assessment of the Movie"". I found this review of ""The Hurricane"" to be more balanced than most and probably the best summation of this film. Go back and read it, and then reassemble your thoughts about this movie.Is it entirely factual? No, it isn't. Is it biased? Absolutely. It leaves out crucial information that would give the viewer a better understanding as to why these things happened to Rubin Carter. But what film ""based on actual events"" gives you the COMPLETE story? Not very many. This is NOT a documentary - there inwhich you would EXPECT the truth to be profiled. This got the Hollywood treatment, like most so-called ""bio-pics"" do. Certain situations and composite characters are ""created"" for the purpose of making the story watchable. ""The Hurricane"" glosses over events in Carter's life and made him look like a man unfairly victimized by the system since he was a child - which may or may not be true. Was racism a factor? Most likely - those who think otherwise might want to do some brushing up on their American history, specifically about slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. On the other hand, Carter wasn't an angel; he had a volatile temper, problems with authority figures, and had several brushes with the law throughout his life. But this is his side of the story, and it has the right to be told. Whether you agree or disagree with this is of no consequence. This is the way it has ALWAYS been in the movies. For example, ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (1972) is an excellent film about the life of blues legend Billie Holiday, a film where Diana Ross proved that she could definitely act, and she too, was up for the Best Actress Oscar. But it was 90% FICTION! Does that mean it was any less moving and convincing?? No.""Titanic"" was also based on actual events, but the two characters the story was built around NEVER EXISTED. Yet you didn't hear anyone complaining about that - in fact, it won a truckload of Oscars, but again, no one made a stink about how the screenwriters took certain liberties with the script. The same goes for ""The Hurricane"".The story we see here is told from the point of view of Carter (Washington), the three Canadians (played by Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger) and a teenager from Brooklyn, Lesra Martin (a great performance by Vicellous Reon Shannon). The Canadians Sam Chaiton, Terry Swinton and Lisa Peters along with Martin, played key roles in getting both Carter and the young man who was with him that night, John Artis, released from prison in the 1980s. So it is definitely biased. However, as a movie, the acting is superb. The chemistry between Denzel Washington and Shannon is fascinating to watch, and Washington has never been better, especially in the scene where Rubin is in solitary confinement and faces the three aspects of his personality. This was the movie he deserved the Best Actor Academy Award for instead of the ""give me"" he got the following year for the overhyped and obnoxious ""Training Day"", probably the only Denzel movie I never want to see again.With such strong opinions expressed here, you'd think a lot of these reviewers actually witnessed the killings that night and can testify to Carter's guilt, therefore, you can say that this was the reason why Denzel lost out to Kevin Spacey in ""American Beauty"". So much was made about the verity of what we saw on screen from both the families of those killed on that fateful night in 1966 in Paterson, New Jersey, and those in the Hollywood community who doubted Carter's innocence. We will never know what truly happened that night, so why continue to speculate on it? All the debates in the world won't bring those people back.My point is, watch the film for what it is - a powerful, effective dramatic story, and nothing more.",4,"""Based on a true story"" should tell you everything you need to know about this",1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,4341,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'reviews', 'here', 'either', 'are', 'unwaveringly', 'convinced', 'former', 'boxer', 'Rubin', 'Hurricane', 'Carter', 'guilt', 'staunchly', 'believe', 'innocence', 'point', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'Others', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'reason', 'had', 'audience', 'who', 'loved', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'events', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'feel', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'However', 'review', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'point', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'written', 'Bruno', 'P', 'March', '2', '2006', 'Unbiased', 'assessment', 'Movie', 'found', 'review', 'Hurricane', 'be', 'more', 'balanced', 'most', 'probably', 'best', 'summation', 'film', 'Go', 'back', 'read', 'then', 'reassemble', 'thoughts', 'movie.Is', 'entirely', 'factual', 'No', ""n't"", 'Is', 'biased', 'Absolutely', 'out', 'crucial', 'information', 'would', 'give', 'viewer', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'things', 'happened', 'Rubin', 'Carter', 'what', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'COMPLETE', 'story', 'Not', 'very', 'many', 'NOT', 'documentary', 'inwhich', 'would', 'EXPECT', 'truth', 'be', 'profiled', 'got', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'most', 'so-called', 'bio-pics', 'do', 'Certain', 'situations', 'composite', 'characters', 'are', 'created', 'purpose', 'making', 'story', 'watchable', 'Hurricane', 'events', 'Carter', 'life', 'made', 'look', 'man', 'unfairly', 'victimized', 'system', 'was', 'child', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'Was', 'racism', 'factor', 'Most', 'likely', 'who', 'think', 'otherwise', 'might', 'want', 'do', 'brushing', 'up', 'American', 'history', 'specifically', 'slavery', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'other', 'hand', 'Carter', 'was', ""n't"", 'angel', 'had', 'volatile', 'temper', 'problems', 'authority', 'figures', 'had', 'several', 'brushes', 'law', 'life', 'side', 'story', 'right', 'be', 'told', 'agree', 'disagree', 'consequence', 'way', 'ALWAYS', 'been', 'movies', 'example', 'Lady', 'Blues', '1972', 'excellent', 'film', 'life', 'blues', 'legend', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'film', 'where', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'proved', 'could', 'definitely', 'act', 'too', 'was', 'up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'was', '90', '%', 'FICTION', 'mean', 'was', 'less', 'moving', 'convincing', 'No', 'Titanic', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'built', 'NEVER', 'EXISTED', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anyone', 'complaining', 'fact', 'won', 'truckload', 'Oscars', 'again', 'one', 'made', 'stink', 'how', 'screenwriters', 'took', 'certain', 'liberties', 'script', 'same', 'Hurricane', '.The', 'story', 'see', 'here', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Carter', 'Washington', 'three', 'Canadians', 'played', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'teenager', 'Brooklyn', 'Lesra', 'Martin', 'great', 'performance', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'Canadians', 'Sam', 'Chaiton', 'Terry', 'Swinton', 'Lisa', 'Peters', 'Martin', 'played', 'key', 'roles', 'getting', 'Carter', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'night', 'John', 'Artis', 'released', 'prison', '1980s', 'definitely', 'biased', 'However', 'movie', 'acting', 'superb', 'chemistry', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Shannon', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Washington', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Rubin', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'three', 'aspects', 'personality', 'was', 'movie', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'instead', 'give', 'got', 'following', 'year', 'overhyped', 'obnoxious', 'Training', 'Day', 'probably', 'only', 'Denzel', 'movie', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'again.With', 'such', 'strong', 'opinions', 'expressed', 'here', ""'d"", 'think', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'witnessed', 'killings', 'night', 'can', 'testify', 'Carter', 'guilt', 'therefore', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'Denzel', 'lost', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'American', 'Beauty', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'verity', 'what', 'saw', 'screen', 'families', 'killed', 'fateful', 'night', '1966', 'Paterson', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'who', 'doubted', 'Carter', 'innocence', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'truly', 'happened', 'night', 'so', 'why', 'continue', 'speculate', 'debates', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bring', 'people', 'back.My', 'point', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'powerful', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'story', 'nothing', 'more']",N/A

You'll be fighting your way back to the video store to return this ""insightful"" movie.Directed by Norman ""I Can't Direct"" Jewison, this cornball of a picture had dialogue written straight from a comic book.  Okay, so it wasn't about boxing but about the life of a man wrongfully accused of murder and spending years in prison. Let me tell you something about these so-called ""true"" movies. Next time you watch one of these ""factual"" movies, read the disclaimer that is something like ""some events were changed and some characters were added."" Even if it doesn't read that, it'll have something like ""based on a true story."" ""Based"" means anything. My belief on these ""based on"" movies is the person actually existed, but everything in this story could be from slightly altered to fantasy.  Personally, I think this hoodlum did it, but leave it to Hollywood to make a bad guy a good guy.I'm very happy about one thing in watching this kamikaze movie-I didn't have to pay for it, I got it from the library. But still, I did waste valuable gas driving there. Oh why do I do these stupid things. Anyway, back to the movie.According to this movie, Hurricane (Denzel) finally gets his freedom after some Canadian hippies get the evidence to release him. On the DVD, one of the bonuses is Director Jewison giving insight to the movie. Then there are those scenes that didn't make it. Well, both these ""bonuses"" were as worthwhile as brushing your teeth with glue.  Jewison, wherever you are, haven't you caused enough pain?So if you like fight movies, don't watch this. But if you like survival stories, still don't watch this. But if you really need to see a movie, read a book instead of watching this. But there are those Denzel fans who'll watch any movie he's in, but I don't think they'll want to watch this.On a scale of 1 to 5 punching bags, I give it a 0.",1,YOU'D HAVE MORE FUN IN A REAL HURRICANE,970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,1938,"['finish', 'watching', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'punch', 'face', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fighting', 'way', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'return', 'insightful', 'movie.Directed', 'Norman', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Direct', 'Jewison', 'cornball', 'picture', 'had', 'dialogue', 'written', 'straight', 'comic', 'book', 'Okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'boxing', 'life', 'man', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'murder', 'spending', 'years', 'prison', 'Let', 'tell', 'something', 'so-called', 'true', 'movies', 'Next', 'time', 'watch', 'one', 'factual', 'movies', 'read', 'disclaimer', 'something', 'events', 'were', 'changed', 'characters', 'were', 'added', 'Even', ""n't"", 'read', ""'ll"", 'have', 'something', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Based', 'anything', 'belief', 'based', 'movies', 'person', 'actually', 'existed', 'everything', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'slightly', 'altered', 'fantasy', 'Personally', 'think', 'hoodlum', 'did', 'leave', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'one', 'thing', 'watching', 'kamikaze', 'movie-I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'got', 'library', 'still', 'did', 'waste', 'valuable', 'gas', 'driving', 'there', 'Oh', 'why', 'do', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'Anyway', 'back', 'movie.According', 'movie', 'Hurricane', 'Denzel', 'finally', 'freedom', 'Canadian', 'hippies', 'get', 'evidence', 'release', 'DVD', 'one', 'bonuses', 'Director', 'Jewison', 'giving', 'insight', 'movie', 'Then', 'are', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Well', 'bonuses', 'were', 'as', 'worthwhile', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'glue', 'Jewison', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'caused', 'enough', 'pain', 'So', 'like', 'fight', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'like', 'survival', 'stories', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'instead', 'watching', 'are', 'Denzel', 'fans', 'who', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'this.On', 'scale', '1', '5', 'punching', 'bags', 'give', '0']",N/A

Hurricane explores how innocent people can find themselves in American prisons, or even executed, because of hateful law enforcement and complacent district attorney offices. Hurricane also exposes one of the most important lessons for African men in America. That lesson is that when we (black men) find ourselves in unjust situations only other ethnic groups are allowed by the system to free us.

I wanted to be able to rave about it to my friends and  family. Unfortunately the Hurricane while it's a good movie, with a great  performance from Denzel Washington but it isn't the great movie should be.  I am a big Norman Jewison fan. He's made some really great films (in the  heat of the night, A soldiers story, and justice for all among others)  I  went into the Hurricane expecting to see an even handed portrayal of the  struggle of Reuben 'Hurricane' Carter. That being said first off Denzel's  performance as Reuben hurricane carter is one of the best perfoamences of  his career. The fact the he didn't recieve and oscar for his performance is  a absolute travesty. His performance was 100 times more intense , more  involving and outright amazing that Kevin Spaceys in American Beauty. And  I'm a Kevin Spacey fan. Jewison's direction is also very good as well. The  fight scenes are amazing. They're almost as good as the one's in raging  bull. The black and white cinematography adds a real energy to them.My  problem with the hurricane lies in the fact that the producers changed some  facts to make the story a little more pallatable to the masses. I had no  problem with the subplot of Lazarus and the the three freindly canadians  that help in freeing the hurricane. I have no problem with them changing  the facts to make the story more entertaining. I just wished that they had  taken a little more care to tell his story more clearly. For instance, What  happens to the hurricane's wife? after he tels her to divorce him she  completely drops out of sight. What did these Canadians do for a living? I  know they were lawyers but did any of them actually work?  and What about  John Artis? The other man who served 20+ years in prison. The only mention  of him in the hurricane is a less 2  minute stanza where Denzel talks about  him being his hero. I would've liked to hear more about his struggle. Maybe  in the interest of time that these things were glossed over but in watching  the Hurricane again (2nd time) I noticed some of these glaring plot holes  that I'd expect to see in a cheesey Hollywood thriller and not in a  biographical drama. Overall I'd recommend the Hurricane largely because of  Denzels powerhouse performance. You wont see many that are better.

70312,A1WWDFQ8HSKT0,0783241399,Vincent M. Mastronardi,"[0, 0]","""The Hurricane"" is the life story of boxer Rubin ""the Hurricane"".  It tells of his plight in and out of jail for most of his life and his struggle to prove that the accusation against him is an unjust one.  It's a pretty good story with a powerful performance from star Denzel Washington.  Maybe his best to date and considering his resume that's saying something.  But not everything is peaceful in the film, as an ""required for length of over 2 and a half hours in order to get near an Oscar"" puts a ton of filler into the film.The story of the actual Hurricane is a good one, but then when others get into the act, the movie gets a bit dull.  Rubin begins his life roughly on the street and a confrontation with a perverted but respected citizen that tires to seduce a young friend forever lands him in trouble.  Officer turned sheriff, played skillfully by Dan Hedaya sets up Ruben.  He lives most of his childhood in juvie until his return to prison is spent usefully learning to fight.  The Hurricane becomes a very famous boxer for a short time until he is set up for a massive killing of people in a bar.  Again, the Dan Hedaya character is on his back.  Well, Ruben writes a best seller that garners little interest for some time but is resurrected years later by a young black man.  He compares his situation in life with Ruben's.  The young man lives with a Canadian group of friends that offer themselves as tutors to help him continue in education.  This is where the story gets long, as the group of strangers believe that Rubin is innocent.  The story now drags on as these pesky ""Canadians"" try to prove a black man's innocence in a still racial era.The near ending with this ""Scooby""-like gang investigating this crime is dreadfully boring.  It's near humorous that people think these people from ""Toronto"" are treated like a lower life form.  Racism is blind as well as stupid.  This might be a case of a sub par movie with a stellar performance.  You really feel the emotions of Denzel Washington.

In the voiceover commentary, director Norman Jewison points out that the authorities would periodically take John Artis to his home and tell him that all he had to do was sign a piece of paper stating that Ruben Carter commited the murders, and he would be set free.  Artis refused; the simple reason being that neither one of them committed the crime.  As Ruben Carter put it: ""John Artis is my hero.""As much as I like this movie and as much as I would recommend that as many people as possible see it, the movie gives the impression that the railroading of Ruben Carter was rooted in a personal vendetta Patterson detective Vincetn Della had against Ruben Carter.  Not so.  Ruben Carter's case was not rooted in a personal vendetta, a judicial misstep or a ""flaw"" in the political system.  It was, rather a systematic, statewide attempt on the part of a *host* of New Jersey authorities to frame an innocent black man;  and to frame him because of his radical political views.Please Note: The United States was *founded* on radical political views.Ruben Carter was far from the only political prisoner in the United States in the 1960s.  U.S. jails were, and are, full of political prisoners, given that the United States government was and still is rooted in racial and economic injustice.Corrupt police, corrupt judges and corrupt politicians in the 1960s were given all kinds of signals from the ruling class that their fervor in maintaining ""law and order"" would grant them unconstitutional authority in applying and interpreting the law.Put another way: the tone established by those in power -- starting at the top with law and order, unindicted co-conspirator Richard Nixon -- ""enabled"" corrupt, vigilante officials to take the law into their own hands; even if their arbitrary, extralegal exercise of power meant innocents were convicted.Maintaining law and order, preserving ""the system"" were and are all that matter to the ruling elite.Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Huey Newton, Fre Hampton, Medgar Evers, Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Louis Allen, Addie Mae Collins, Viola Gregg Liuzzo, Mack Charles Parker, Emmett Till, the four children who died on a Sunday morning in Birmingham, Alabama, and countless of other unknowns who were either lynched, imprisoned or murdered in cold blood -- these were political imprionments and political ""hits.""-- Consider how ""justice"" was meted out to the men who killed the three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964 (Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman).-- Consider Mayor Richard Daley's ""shot to kill"" order just before the antiwar marchers convened in Chicago in 1968 for the Democratic National Convention.-- Consider the Kerner Commission's characterization of what took place in the streets of Chicago during that 1968 Democratic Convention -- they described it as a ""police riot.""-- Consider the attitude of the chief law enforcement officer, J. Edgar Hoover, toward Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement in general.-- Consider the enabling message of people like *Governor* Orville Faubus, *Sheriff* Bull Conner, *Governor* George Wallace, ""Governor* Lester Maddox, et al to the corrupt sheriffs, judges, police and politicians who went out of their way to punish ""uppity blacks.""So it's not just one corrupt Patterson detective we're talking about; we're talking about the corruption of entire social, political and economic system -- a system that wanted to not just imprison Ruben Carter but to kill his political beliefs and kill the spirit that generated those beliefs.Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter is an extraordinary person; extraordinary to have endured what he endured.  And he is celebrated for his endurance and for his courage.  But how many countless people are there -- unsung, unheard of -- who were killed, railroaded and/or imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit, who *didn't* survive as Ruben Carter survived?Quoting from a review by J. Cooper:""The film implies that the frame-up of Carter and Artis was unique--an aberration of justice.  But as Carter was well aware in 1967, the state was out to crush the rising opposition simmering in the urban ghettos, and he was a prime target.  He was outspoken, bold and had spent much of his youth in a correctional facility. ...""He was also an outspoken critic of racial prejudice, and a supporter of the civil rights movement in the US from the early 1960s. ...""The political issues that agitated him and about which he felt passionate are left out of the film. ...""... the intolerable conditions of ghetto life.  These were the conditions that had formed young Rubin Carter: run-down apartments, unemployment over 20 percent, poor schools and little future for youth. ...""State forces were mobilized against the growing (civil right and antiwar) movement(s) through open police provocations, frame-ups and murders. ... This is the social background to the Carter and Artis case that is barely touched on by the film.  The audience is left to conclude that it was one bad cop and one angry black man locked in battle. ...""... the ""guardian angel"" jailer who helps Carter retain his dignity by bending the rules for him ... reinforces the artificial 'balance' that the filmmakers bring to the story in their attempt to demonstrate that ultimately the American Justice System ""can work.'""",5,Asking First-Order
