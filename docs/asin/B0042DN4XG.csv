Recently I bought The Trial, which I think is a good crime story dramatized by good actors.  Matthew Modine played the defense attorney.  I was not familiar with him, but was favorably impressed by his acting.  Randy Wayne played the defendant, whose role was primarily to look confused and anguished.  I enjoyed him in To Save A Life, a film I own, in which he played a leading role.  Bob Gunton played the prosecutor -- he has appeared in many films, and does a great job whether playing the good guy or the bad guy.  But, please don't imitate his pronunciation of defendant -- in which he stresses the final syllable as ANT (those insects who enjoy picnics).  The letter /a/ in that final syllable is a schwa and sounds like /uh/, as in ago.  I was happily surprised to see Robert Forester in the role of private eye.  Other actors did very well, too.  The crime story is the main plot.  But, the secondary plot has a wonderful message:  when a person is trying to work through the grieving process, it is important to ask the right question.  Don't ask, Why did my loved one/s die?  Instead, ask, Since I am still alive, what can I do to be an instrument-of-righteousness for God, to the benefit others in need?  In this case, a man who had lost his wife and two sons used his passion for the truth, and skills he had perfected in his work as an attorney, to help an innocent young man, who looked very guilty.",4,Well-Crafted Crime Drama,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1489,"['actively', 'look', 'faith/spirituality', 'films', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Recently', 'bought', 'Trial', 'think', 'good', 'crime', 'story', 'dramatized', 'good', 'actors', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'played', 'defense', 'attorney', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'was', 'favorably', 'impressed', 'acting', 'Randy', 'Wayne', 'played', 'defendant', 'role', 'was', 'primarily', 'look', 'confused', 'anguished', 'enjoyed', 'Save', 'A', 'Life', 'film', 'own', 'played', 'leading', 'role', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'played', 'prosecutor', 'appeared', 'many', 'films', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'imitate', 'pronunciation', 'defendant', 'final', 'syllable', 'ANT', 'insects', 'who', 'enjoy', 'picnics', 'letter', '/a/', 'final', 'syllable', 'schwa', 'like', '/uh/', 'was', 'happily', 'surprised', 'see', 'Robert', 'Forester', 'role', 'private', 'eye', 'Other', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'crime', 'story', 'main', 'plot', 'secondary', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'message', 'when', 'person', 'trying', 'work', 'grieving', 'process', 'important', 'ask', 'right', 'question', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Why', 'did', 'loved', 'one/s', 'die', 'Instead', 'ask', 'am', 'still', 'alive', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'be', 'instrument-of-righteousness', 'God', 'benefit', 'others', 'need', 'case', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'wife', 'two', 'sons', 'used', 'passion', 'truth', 'skills', 'had', 'perfected', 'work', 'attorney', 'help', 'innocent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'very', 'guilty']",The Trial

1382857,A1CHM200OEN65X,B0042DN4XG,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[2, 3]","Years ago, I discovered Robert Whitlow's writing through his debut novel, ""The List."" Since then, he's written a string of legal thrillers with a meandering Southern feel. Last year, ""The List"" was released as a movie, but my high hopes for it were dashed by wooden acting, romanticizing lighting, and a fair share of cheesy moments. It felt like an 80s, made-for-TV movie.As a fan of Whitlow's books, I decided to give ""The Trial"" a chance--though with much lower expectations. The story revolves around a young man accused of murder, when his date is found dead with roofies in her system. He claims he didn't do it. His court-appointed lawyer is depressed Mac MacLain, a man who lost his wife and children years earlier in an auto accident. While there's nothing particularly original--even Grisham's storylines have become cliched--it's a definite stride forward from the earlier film. It's amazing the amount of time, energy, and manpower that goes into making a movie, and I have utmost respect for those who undertake this task. Yes, the lighting still has that romanticized feel that went out about fifteen years ago, and yes, the acting is still one notch below, but most of these issues could've been resolved on the directing and editing end. Robert Forster does a nice job in his role, and the female counselor did as well, while others wore furrowed brows in far too many scenes.It's nice to see this film getting distribution through Redbox and Netflix, and I'm glad to see Christian novels being made into films, but I would love to see a more modern artistic mindset applied to such efforts. The average American is a movie buff, and their expectations are high. Sadly, for me, ""The Trial"" never quite lived up. Nevertheless, knowing the quality of Whitlow's novels, I hope we can see another of his books translated to film in a way that captures his storytelling power.",3,"A Stride Forward, But . . .",1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1887,"['Years', 'ago', 'discovered', 'Robert', 'Whitlow', 'writing', 'debut', 'novel', 'List', 'then', 'written', 'string', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'meandering', 'Southern', 'feel', 'Last', 'year', 'List', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'were', 'dashed', 'wooden', 'acting', 'romanticizing', 'lighting', 'fair', 'share', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'felt', '80s', 'made-for-TV', 'movie.As', 'fan', 'Whitlow', 'books', 'decided', 'give', 'Trial', 'chance', 'much', 'lower', 'expectations', 'story', 'around', 'young', 'man', 'accused', 'murder', 'when', 'date', 'found', 'dead', 'roofies', 'system', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'court-appointed', 'lawyer', 'depressed', 'Mac', 'MacLain', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'children', 'years', 'earlier', 'auto', 'accident', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'original', 'even', 'Grisham', 'storylines', 'have', 'become', 'cliched', 'definite', 'stride', 'forward', 'earlier', 'film', 'amazing', 'amount', 'time', 'energy', 'manpower', 'making', 'movie', 'have', 'utmost', 'respect', 'who', 'undertake', 'task', 'Yes', 'lighting', 'still', 'romanticized', 'feel', 'went', 'out', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'yes', 'acting', 'still', 'one', 'notch', 'most', 'issues', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'resolved', 'directing', 'editing', 'end', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'nice', 'job', 'role', 'female', 'counselor', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'wore', 'furrowed', 'brows', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes.It', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'getting', 'distribution', 'Redbox', 'Netflix', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Christian', 'novels', 'being', 'made', 'films', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'modern', 'artistic', 'mindset', 'applied', 'such', 'efforts', 'average', 'American', 'movie', 'buff', 'expectations', 'are', 'high', 'Sadly', 'Trial', 'never', 'quite', 'lived', 'up', 'Nevertheless', 'knowing', 'quality', 'Whitlow', 'novels', 'hope', 'can', 'see', 'books', 'translated', 'film', 'way', 'storytelling', 'power']",The Trial

I thought that every character played their roles well. I did not find the movie a bore as some of the reviews have stated.What I did find interesting is that, when a movie is God centered or faith centered it is a bore, bad acting, waste of time etc.. It is very strange how when a faith based movie is made, no one wants to support the movie or give the movie great reviews.I said this to say that it is a shame that this movie did not receive the exposure it should have. This was a great movie as my family and I just finished watching the movie and I could not wait to write a review about the movie in support of this movie and hopefully many more faith based movies to come.If you are thinking of viewing this movie, you will not be disappointed. We viewed this movie with clear minds. We left the movie touched and filled with the message that this movie sends.. If you want a clean, faith based, mystery then this movie is for you. It is based on a book by a great author who writes great books..The movie was professional quality, touching, clean, great family entertainment and an ending that will knock you off of your feet and leaving you wondering who can you trust.View this movie for yourself and then make your own judgement as to if it is a good movie are not. But before you state your response, ask yourself what do you value, did this movie feed your spirit man? Did you get the message of this movie.Christians can have clean fun and make decent movies without all of the guns, violence, and drugs etc. Remember what you put in your gates, eye, ears, etc is what will come out.

1382860,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0042DN4XG,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","THE TRIAL, adapted from Robert Whitlow's novel of the same name by director Gary Wheeler and Mark Freiburger, is in many ways a reminder of what movies used to be - movies that centered on trials of innocent victims or trials that, like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, surfaced other issues to ponder. This film is a quiet little intimate tale about the justice system in all its elegance and flaws, but it is more: there are human stories that interweave giving the film an aura of caring that is so rare in today's CGI-oriented Hollywood.The film is set in the beauty of Georgia countryside, complete with mists and fields and rivers where we first see attorney Mac MacClain (Matthew Modine), pensive after the accidental death of his wife and two children nine years ago. His practice has fallen, his mental sate has fallen below the flatline state, and he is contemplating suicide when a telephone call from the wise old town judge (Rance Howard) summons him to take on a case of the murder of one Angela Hightower, the young and beautiful daughter of the wealthiest man in the little town, the corrupt Hightower family being part of Mac's sad past encounters. The accused is Angela's boyfriend Pete Thomason (an impressive Randy Wayne) who is now in jail claiming he had total amnesia for the event. Mac feels a sense of responsibility to the boy and agrees to take on the case, hiring back his assistant Mindy (Nikki Deloach) and his investigator Ray (Robert Forster). As they uncover facts Mac seeks advice from psychologist Dr. Anna Wilkes (Clare Carey) who in addition to testing Pete finds time to share her Grieving Group Sessions with Mac.The evidence is gathered and the trial begins after a plea bargain is denied by Pete. The Hightower lawyer is the brilliant, eloquent but ruthless Joe Whetstone (a fine performance by Bob Gunton) and the battle of wits and rights is on. The courtroom drama is well written and the turn of events from the trial to the followup findings and second trial are well molded. If the film ends in a too saccharine mode, the quality of acting in the film before that should make the audience tolerate the preachiness. There are some fine cameos -Larry Bagby, Burgess Jenkins, Brett Rice among them - and there is much to learn about contemporary youth habits and small town tenor. This is not a great film, but it is a refreshing memory of the small and intimate films of yesteryear.

However, the book was so lengthy and detailed (in a good way), that the movie didn't seem long enough or have enough detail to it.  I would have liked to see more of the investigation, following leads, the evidence, etc. Then again, Whitlow's writing generally focuses on the characters and their lives more than the actual investigations and criminal procedings, so in all fairness its probably just me wishing for the details and not that the moviemakers actually left anything significant out.",4,Good movie!

It's about a man who is a lawyer asked to take on a case by an old Judge who wants to make sure the defendant is defended without a hitch.  The state's attorney is pretty ruthless in a bland sort of way when prosecuting the case.  It's a mystery where inner turmoil is explored, sometimes with great anguish.  If you are looking for a thrill a minute, this ain't it.  This is a slow building mystery suspense that makes the viewer actually think about what is going on.

This is a faith-based movie designed for young Christian audiences. This review contains some early plot points, but seriously, nothing can spoil this film. Mac is a lawyer who lost his wife and two sons on Christmas Eve. So he does what all men do when that happens. He quits his job and puts a loaded gun to his head. Mac is suddenly saved by the bell when the phone rings. He is ordered by a judge to take a murder case in a small Georgia town that has 3 black people and 4 people with mixed southern accents. An evil big city prosecutor from Atlanta is coming to town. Mac assembles his crack team to help him. Mindy, a perky waitress, who makes helpful suggestions like getting an answering machine for the office, and his dead wife's brother who is part time woodsman and part time investigator. Together they go and investigate the murder uncovering simple pieces of evidence that should have been revealed in any criminal investigation, such as an eye witness who saw two cars the night of the murder and one of them hit his truck. Mac has the accused murderer meet with a female shrink, who also runs a clinic to help people cope with the grief of a loved one through God. Why? Because she was lost her husband. Her 10 year old son shows Mac that you can go on with life as they play catch. Mom had tried to teach the kid to throw a baseball by reading from a book. If this sounds hokey, it is. The courtroom has a huge copy of the 10 commandments displayed behind the witness stand which the camera occasionally zeros in on.The script was extremely bad. Anyone who has seen one Perry mason episode could not have written such horrific court scenes. First, based upon the real lack of evidence, the case should have never had gone to trial. There was no real investigation into the murder. The evidence presented by the first witness should not had been allowed and even though the defense had a witness list, his testimony was a complete surprise!Watching this film was like watching a train wreak. I kept wanting to turn away, but kept expecting something to happen. No sex, nudity, or bad language, just the proverbial bad uncle who made a pass at his niece.
