1296774,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002WEEYIQ,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","My One and Only stars Renee Zellweger in a movie that's mostly a drama, but contains a few elements of comedy every once in a while.Renee portrays a hoity toity-type woman who loves spending money and living elegantly.  She has an obsession with men too.  She develops relationships, and many times, her past relationships come back to haunt her as the boyfriends from her past make a surprise return and normally only play minor roles in the storyline.The storyline is mainly about Reene and her two teenage sons travelling across the country in search of... well I suppose in search of finding a satisfying lifestyle for the three of them.  At first they start out in the northeast section of the United States such as Boston, New York and Pittsburgh, and eventually they travel west to places in Missouri and eventually make their destination to Los Angeles.Throughout the adventure, they meet people who are either strange, crooked, or depressed (without spoiling too much).I believe My One and Only is an underrated film.  Kevin Bacon doesn't make much of an appearance, except for a couple short spots and that's pretty much it.The comedy usually takes a backseat to the drama segments, because the film is mainly about telling a family story dealing with a mother and her two sons struggling to get by and learn to deal with people.  The two teenage sons have problems of their own but neither character is ever touched upon deeply or creatively.  Instead, the two boys feel like they're only there to fill in as side characters while Renee's storyline receives most of the attention.A quality film worth watching.",5,underrated storytelling,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1621,"['One', 'Only', 'stars', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'movie', 'mostly', 'drama', 'few', 'elements', 'comedy', 'once', 'while.Renee', 'hoity', 'toity-type', 'woman', 'who', 'spending', 'money', 'living', 'elegantly', 'obsession', 'men', 'too', 'relationships', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'relationships', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'boyfriends', 'past', 'make', 'surprise', 'return', 'normally', 'only', 'play', 'minor', 'roles', 'storyline.The', 'storyline', 'mainly', 'Reene', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'travelling', 'country', 'search', 'well', 'suppose', 'search', 'finding', 'satisfying', 'lifestyle', 'three', 'first', 'start', 'out', 'northeast', 'section', 'United', 'States', 'such', 'Boston', 'New', 'York', 'Pittsburgh', 'eventually', 'travel', 'west', 'places', 'Missouri', 'eventually', 'make', 'destination', 'Los', 'Angeles.Throughout', 'adventure', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'strange', 'crooked', 'depressed', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', '.I', 'believe', 'One', 'Only', 'underrated', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'appearance', 'couple', 'short', 'spots', 'pretty', 'much', 'it.The', 'comedy', 'usually', 'backseat', 'drama', 'segments', 'film', 'mainly', 'telling', 'family', 'story', 'dealing', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'struggling', 'get', 'learn', 'deal', 'people', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'have', 'problems', 'own', 'character', 'ever', 'touched', 'upon', 'deeply', 'creatively', 'Instead', 'two', 'boys', 'feel', ""'re"", 'only', 'there', 'fill', 'side', 'characters', 'Renee', 'storyline', 'most', 'attention.A', 'quality', 'film', 'watching']",N/A

And it does fall apart, more than once!  From her cheating husband, to her mentally-warped fiance (and serial bigamist)!  Somehow, she shoots for the sunny-side of the street.  Her two sons, they have their share of issues, also.  Ultimately, mom takes her sons across the country for the trip to Hollywood, to give her oldest son a chance to make it in the movies.

One thing I really like about the movie is that the three main characters keep moving around, injecting new characters and plot twists constantly.

Ren&eacute;e Zellweger plays the often beaten down but nonetheless driven mother of two teenage boys, whose own separation from her husband has her, quite literally, driven to leave him. And drive she and the boys do! From Boston to California, it's one missed opportunity after another as Zellweger runs into a cast of losing suitors...several played by actors of note.The pace is decidedly slow, but that makes ""My One and Only"" all the better. While Zellweger is the glue that holds the family (and the movie) together, a wonderful performance is turned in by Logan Lerman, who plays the older son George.

1296784,A129YBX5BVNW2,B002WEEYIQ,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE (UK and EUROPE) BLU RAY ISSUE ***In some ways ""My One And Only"" is a real throwback to old-fashioned filmmaking. It's a story that deliberately takes its own sweet time to unfold - characters make big mistakes, recover begrudgingly, then grow some and move on. It's about a family that's close-knit but also in turmoil - and all of this is set against a backdrop of beautiful Fifties American small town/big city scenery and socially changing times...Renee Zellweger plays Anne Devereaux - a glamorous New York mum who decides to leave her feckless bandleader husband George after she catches him at home with one too many of his on-the-road affairs (a hugely likeable and capable Kevin Bacon). Besides - the royalties to his National hit ""My One And Only"" have begun to wither - and so with wildly out-of-place optimism - Anne cheerfully bundles her two teenage sons (superb casting of Logan Lerman and Mark Rendall) into her ludicrously flashy Coupe De Ville car (which she's just paid $2,500 for) and hits the road for Pittsburgh - and eventually - the bigger glam of Hollywood. But of course along the way, Anne only manages to flit from one relationship disaster to another - with just her beauty, class and innate belief in herself keeping her head above water and her restless kids out of poverty (and even jail).One of the men she meets and woos is Chris Noth who plays a nice-at-first army-man who is lonely and quickly smitten. But as the relationship unfolds, Harlan increasingly becomes Mister Rules and Regulations - eventually turning into a very nasty piece of work indeed. It's a real departure for Noth from his Mr. Big character in Sex & The City, but man is he good at it (dialogue above).But the film firmly belongs to Zellweger who is absolutely superlative throughout in a way she hasn't been for a long time - ably assisted by a talented supporting cast who are given material that makes everyone shine. Zellweger gives her Anne a beating heart - fun one moment - destroyed the next - digging down deep to find that inner strength to go on. You root for her - bleed for her - and eventually smile at her sheer American tenacity. This movie sees Renee as a great actress rather than just a good one.""My One And Only"" is a proper journey movie - and because it's steeped in Fifties period architecture and clothing - it looks utterly fantastic on BLU RAY. Scene after scene is filled with that old-world grit, glamour and gorgeous detail. And on it goes to a surprising twist at the end that you genuinely don't see coming. The BLU RAY also features a very informative ""Making Of"" and staggeringly candid remarks in the ""Cast & Crew Interviews"" feature (Richard Loncraine the Director and Charlie Peters the Writer) as well as contributions from the army of people who brought the Fifties stuff so evocatively to life.A bit of a 2011 sleeper on the rental and purchase market, I liked ""My One And Only"" a great deal and bought it to own. I'd say give this little gem a chance - I suspect you'll be more than pleasantly surprised.PS: it's only available on BLU RAY in the 'UK' at present - Stateside is DVD only.

The fact that she is in her middle age, has two teenage sons from two different men is not stopping her.It is wonderful film (and story) about one woman's endurance and determiantion and the love that binds her with her two sons.  Her constant upbeat attitude is annoying to her sons at times, but they all stick together no matter what.  I never really knew much about George Hamilton, the actor, other than the fact that one point he was engaged to Elizabeth Taylor and they had broken it off on not so friendly terms.  However, this film portrays George as sensitive, cynical and introverted boy determined to seek his own place in his world on his own terms - kind of like what his mother did when she walked out on his father.I truly enjoyed this movie.

I am watching it the second time and I enjoyed just as much as the first time, maybe more.Just a word of caution, If you are not 60 plus you want understand this movie or probably enjoy it.

1296790,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B002WEEYIQ,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[13, 15]","Once again I was ordering this on the premise similar to what you see on the cover: ""funny"", ""cheerful comedy"" and the cover showing everyone smiling. There were several lines that were laugh-out-loud funny, but this was more of a drama about an angered wife traveling cross country with her two teen boys to hop from sugar daddy to sugar daddy.The performances were adequate, with even Chris Noth having a brief part as a one of the lunatics she briefly picks to marry. David Koechner plays a great little role as another one of the crazies she tried to marry. Renee plays her role quite well, but it is hard to feel for her as she leap frogs from man to man, uprooting the boys each time as they travel to California from New York. Logan Lerman (who I first remember fromMeet Bill) succinctly plays one of her boys, that if you do not read the art or remember the spoiler ads - gives a nice twist at the end of who he becomes.The picture quality is fine, but it could definitely use a Blu treatment. The sound is 5.1, but the strength of making this 3.5 star film a 5 is the two documentaries. Both last just over 30 minutes each and have a plethora of great material about the making of and creation process. Some of the best moments though are how candid everyone is (especially the writer - Peters) with how broken the Hollywood film making/writing process is. I was laughing harder here than in the film at how sadly honest they were in what it takes to sell a film in Southern California now - worth the watch on their own.Overall, not a solid piece for fans of the supporting cast (Bacon, Noth, Koechner, Stahl) as each only have short appearances. The film hinges on Renee who graces the screen in the way she is known for, and the ""twist"" of discovering who her kid becomes - but the emotions feel a little shallow.
