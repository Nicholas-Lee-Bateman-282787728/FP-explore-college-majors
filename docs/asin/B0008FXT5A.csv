899199,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0008FXT5A,bookloversfriend,"[28, 33]","Stunning scenery.  Good music.  A broad sweep of characters and relationships in this three-hour extravaganza.  Viewers who like grand-scale period movies such as ""The Buchaneers"" or ""North and South"" should enjoy this movie, even though the period is the present and the upper-class is Scottish rather than English.  The film is PG-class with no naughty words or bare skin or any of the other things that some people object to.If this movie had not been based on a Rosamunde Pilcher book, it would probably be very popular.  But it invites comparisons with ""The Shell Seekers"" and ""Coming Home"", and unfortunately it comes in second by comparison.  But on its own, it is quite a respectable movie with much to offer.The tension is kept up by two on-going mysteries: who is the dead body shown at the beginning?  and what is Lottie going to do?  When you set up exciting questions like these, you have to have some exciting answers to them.  This film doesn't.  Lottie doesn't do anything.  And the dead body is a disappointment.  There is another disappointment.  We are made to dislike Edmund at the beginning and are longing to see him get clobbered.  He doesn't.Also, even at three hours, with the large number of characters, we don't get a chance to get into the few interesting characters enough.  So, even though we come to know who the characters are, who their relationships are, and what their problems are, we don't really get a chance to feel those problems as we do in ""The Shell Seekers"".There is also a serious casting mistake in the casting of Edmund.  Edmund is a guy with whom the most beautiful and interesting women fall madly in love at first sight.  The actor who plays him has to be a stone fox.  Michael York, to put it mildly, isn't.  This casting mistake makes the main story incredible and also contributes to making the ending less than satisfactory.  The appealing characters are Pandora (Jacqueline Bisset) and the Mariel Hemingway character.  Since they are appealing, we would like to see them do well.

899203,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0008FXT5A,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","September, the film, is not Pilcher's book. The movie is primarily romance with a water death mystery. The film was shot in Ireland, although the story line states it is Scotland, like the book. So if the Rosamunde Pilcher fans want her book transformed into a visual, this is no more that than any novel can be turned into a film in just 3 hours. The basics are there. Henry, age 8, takes less of a focus in the film, although there is some conflict over sending him to boarding school too young. I still give the Lee Langley screenplay story 5 stars, like Pilcher's book.It's the adults that take center stage in the DVD. And you'll never realize it's not Scotland vistas, they chose the Irish filming locations well. Jacqueline Bisset as the major character Pandora is excellent as is THE Hemingway's granddaughter, Mariel Hemingway as Virginia. There are several romantic relationships that make up the group which will eventually meet at the September Ball. Not all are rich, not all old-money. Many secrets will be revealed till the conclusion is reached.Unfortunately the producer of the DVD failed to provide CC or SUBTITLES.Background music is worthy of a CD, often soft and peaceful, romantic, till the bank arrives for the ball. There you may jump up and do a waltz or reel in the living room along with the stunningly formal Scottish-adorned cast. Kilts and plaid is IN.Don't forget to watch out for the frequent scenes with Loony Lottie (Angela Pleasence). She'll keep you caught up with the main plot. Male leads are Edmund (Michael York) and Archie (Edward Fox), the latter who does a great job with faking a wooden leg throughout.The DVD is not rated but is FAMILY FRIENDLY. Of course warn the kids there are no superheros, just romantic escapades, fantastic scenic vistas, clan/family relationship turmoil, and a touch of mystery. Maybe it should be rated S-O, for viewable with a Significant-Other. That's what I did and WE both loved it.And look, now it is so cheap. Worth the price to own, worth multiple watching.5 stars for music, panoramas, & romance.",5,DVD v-good; BOOK v-good; BUT DIFFERENT,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,2074,"['September', 'film', 'not', 'Pilcher', 'book', 'movie', 'primarily', 'romance', 'water', 'death', 'mystery', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Ireland', 'story', 'line', 'states', 'Scotland', 'book', 'So', 'Rosamunde', 'Pilcher', 'fans', 'want', 'book', 'transformed', 'visual', 'more', 'novel', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'film', 'just', '3', 'hours', 'basics', 'are', 'there', 'Henry', 'age', '8', 'less', 'focus', 'film', 'conflict', 'sending', 'boarding', 'school', 'too', 'young', 'still', 'give', 'Lee', 'Langley', 'screenplay', 'story', '5', 'stars', 'Pilcher', 'book.It', 'adults', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'never', 'realize', 'not', 'Scotland', 'vistas', 'chose', 'Irish', 'filming', 'locations', 'well', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'major', 'character', 'Pandora', 'excellent', 'Hemingway', 'granddaughter', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Virginia', 'are', 'several', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'make', 'up', 'group', 'will', 'eventually', 'meet', 'September', 'Ball', 'Not', 'are', 'rich', 'not', 'old-money', 'Many', 'secrets', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'conclusion', 'reached.Unfortunately', 'producer', 'DVD', 'failed', 'provide', 'CC', 'SUBTITLES.Background', 'music', 'worthy', 'CD', 'often', 'soft', 'peaceful', 'romantic', 'till', 'bank', 'ball', 'may', 'jump', 'up', 'do', 'waltz', 'reel', 'living', 'room', 'stunningly', 'formal', 'Scottish-adorned', 'cast', 'Kilts', 'plaid', 'IN.Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'watch', 'out', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'Loony', 'Lottie', 'Angela', 'Pleasence', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'caught', 'up', 'main', 'plot', 'Male', 'leads', 'are', 'Edmund', 'Michael', 'York', 'Archie', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'latter', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'faking', 'wooden', 'leg', 'throughout.The', 'DVD', 'not', 'rated', 'FAMILY', 'FRIENDLY', 'course', 'warn', 'kids', 'are', 'superheros', 'just', 'romantic', 'escapades', 'fantastic', 'scenic', 'vistas', 'clan/family', 'relationship', 'turmoil', 'touch', 'mystery', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'S-O', 'viewable', 'Significant-Other', 'what', 'did', 'WE', 'loved', 'it.And', 'look', 'now', 'so', 'cheap', 'price', 'own', 'worth', 'multiple', 'watching.5', 'stars', 'music', 'panoramas', 'romance']",N/A
