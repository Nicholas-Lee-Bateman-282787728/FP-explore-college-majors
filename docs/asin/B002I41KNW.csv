Well, as original as boy meets girl and falls in love can be.  The plot is shallow and predictable, the singing rates above nails on a chalkboard, and the acting by the protagonist could be done by a corpse only after rigor mortis set in.

1269188,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B002I41KNW,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[11, 14]","If you like Amy Adams, you'll probably like this movie. If you like Jazz, particularly some of the standards, you'll probably quite enjoy this movie.This movie was made in 2006, yet not released till now.  In the meantime, lead actress Amy Adams has rightly become a huge star, getting Academy Award nominations forJunebugandDoubt, and having a huge hit withEnchanted (Full Screen Edition). I just saw Leap Year which is worth a look.Moonlight Serenade has flaws, it's a B movie with an A actress. The music mostly, by Jazz virtuoso, Alex deFrancesco is absolutely excellent, and excellently performed by Amy Adams, who has a recording artist quality voice. Her main costar, Alec Watson resembles a young Sinatra in appearance.  He has looks and charisma. I think he is a promising actor.What I found lacking in the movie was not the acting, but the underdeveloped storyline, and the basic unbelievability of the characters behavior.  Are we supposed to believe that a financial wizard would totally rethink his successful business strategy of selling short, and risk his career because he met a coatcheck girl, and aspiring singer.  Are we supposed to believe that a narcissistic druggie boyfriend would suddenly act in his girlfriend's best interest.  Are we supposed to believe that she, Chloe, would struggle to meet the piano player big Frank for an audition at a different club when they both already work in the same club.  Why not just audition before the club opens?  With some better direction the scenes could have played a little better, and the story could have been improved.About halfway through this movie decides it's a musical, when the non musician played by Harriet Sansom Harris, (you may remember her as the ruthless agent on Frasier), suddenly and for no apparent reason bursts into song. This was disconcerting.Other than that, I did enjoy the movie, in fact I watched it again. Safe to say Amy Adams will not be most remembered for this movie, yet this movie will be most remembered for Amy Adams.  I though the best scene was at the end in the spotlight.  Some people just shine in the spotlight, and belong there.

It WAS really her singing, not someone else, for those who wondered, she has a voice, and she's a talented actress.  I'd probably pay money to watch her paint a fence if she sang old standards while doing it. Harriet Sansom Harris was a nice surprise in her one song.Now, SPOILER ALERT for some of my next comments.Frankly, I found the whole idea of a musical similar to the old ones of the 40's kinda nice and refreshing for a change.  The ""meet cute"" of her singing outside the window was kinda fresh and nice, and the initial antagonism was pretty well done, all right for us old movie buffs.  But, boy, did the movie take a big wrong turn with the ""boy loses girl"" plot device with the weird thing of Alec Newman's relationship with his mother. When he finally unlocked her old bedroom, for the flash of a second I was afraid of a ""Psycho"" moment, and she'd be there, mummified!  :)  And, I hated that whole thing with Chloe's (Adams) co-dependent relationship with her boyfriend, Jessie.  This is the best the writers could do?Another complaint is with Newman's voice.  It was pleasing enough, but just didn't come off strong enough for Adams' more vibrant singing.Last, I understand that the cinematography was probably going for moonlight, but everything was WAY too pale, colorless, and silver.  Did EVERYONE have to dress in white, silver or black?  Thank goodness for Adams' red hair, a bright and beautiful spot of color.  In fact, you can say that about her throughout the entire film.

And I'll admit the singing isn't too far away from regional summer stock, or that college musical you remember from your junior year. But Amy Adams is adorable, and if the actor (Alec Newman) who plays the male lead seems like an android (the scene where he cries is especially awful), the jazz standards made me smile. I saw it free on Netflix streaming, and I really liked Adams, and also Harriet Harris (of Desperate Housewives and Broadway musicals), who gets to sing the blues. Jazz notable Joey DeFrancesco gets to try out his acting chops and play some smoky organ jazz with (I assume) his regular trio.

1269193,A6FIAB28IS79,B002I41KNW,Samuel Chell,"[1, 1]","Don't look for this at your neighborhood cineplex any time soon.  In fact, the film was held back several years before being released to the ""after market"" of DVD and streaming video sales.  One reviewer asks, ""How could they do this to Amy Adams?""  But more than likely it was the latter who saw what is inarguably a ""little"" movie as an opportunity to employ her vocal skills.The ""apparent"" shortcomings of the film--in directing, editing, scripting, acting--make it an easy target for viewers expecting something else: a realistic ""film noir"" with music (like ""Casablanca"" or ""To Have and Have Not"") or an engaging romantic soaper with gripping conflict.  It's neither.  In fact, the film clearly resists any easy categorization.Viewing it a second time, I tried to put myself in the place of the filmmakers, seeing the project from their viewpoint and intentions.  Perhaps, the film is best described as an adult ""fairy tale"" with elements of film noir, Hollywood romance, and the screen musical mixed in.  The plot is really secondary to the memorable moments it manages to capture--for example, Nate, the stock portfolio manager and former jazz pianist, suddenly becoming mesmerized by a siren song that wafts into his apartment from the street, its source (Amy Adams) unknown to him at the time.  The film is about putting dreams and desire ahead of prosaic matters such as making money.  Those things will take care of themselves if you have the imaginative sensibilities to follow your heart's desire.  Personally, I found Nate's secretary, played by Harriet Sansom Harris, one of the most appealing characters in the film, especially when she, too, reveals her true inner feelings with a touching performance of the classic Billie Holiday standard, ""Lover Man.""Everything ends up fine, of course, and everyone ends up happy, as should the viewer who willingly suspends disbelief and allows the film to work its own magic.  Music is above all the expression of emotion, which makes music especially difficult to film (most attempts to film a jazz musician's genius--e.g. ""Bird""--have fallen way short, leaving the average spectator with little more than the picture of a self-destructive junkie).  So I give this movie credit for trying to do what has eluded most other films about music.  And for those for whom this kind of film isn't their cup of tea, there's always the infectious music--alternately bluesy and sublime--of keyboardist extraordinaire Joey DeFranceso.",4,One of a kind,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,2479,"['Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'neighborhood', 'cineplex', 'time', 'soon', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'held', 'back', 'several', 'years', 'being', 'released', 'market', 'DVD', 'streaming', 'video', 'sales', 'One', 'reviewer', 'How', 'could', 'do', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'more', 'likely', 'was', 'latter', 'who', 'saw', 'what', 'inarguably', 'little', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'employ', 'vocal', 'skills.The', 'apparent', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'directing', 'editing', 'scripting', 'acting', 'make', 'easy', 'target', 'viewers', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'realistic', 'film', 'noir', 'music', 'Casablanca', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'soaper', 'gripping', 'conflict', 'fact', 'film', 'clearly', 'easy', 'categorization.Viewing', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'put', 'place', 'filmmakers', 'seeing', 'project', 'viewpoint', 'intentions', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'best', 'described', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'elements', 'film', 'noir', 'Hollywood', 'romance', 'screen', 'musical', 'mixed', 'plot', 'really', 'secondary', 'memorable', 'moments', 'capture', 'example', 'Nate', 'stock', 'portfolio', 'manager', 'former', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'mesmerized', 'siren', 'song', 'apartment', 'street', 'source', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'unknown', 'time', 'film', 'putting', 'dreams', 'desire', 'ahead', 'prosaic', 'matters', 'such', 'making', 'money', 'things', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'have', 'imaginative', 'sensibilities', 'follow', 'heart', 'desire', 'Personally', 'found', 'Nate', 'secretary', 'played', 'Harriet', 'Sansom', 'Harris', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'characters', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'too', 'true', 'inner', 'feelings', 'touching', 'performance', 'classic', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'standard', 'Lover', 'Man', 'Everything', 'up', 'fine', 'course', 'everyone', 'up', 'happy', 'should', 'viewer', 'who', 'willingly', 'disbelief', 'film', 'work', 'own', 'magic', 'Music', 'expression', 'emotion', 'music', 'especially', 'difficult', 'film', 'most', 'attempts', 'film', 'jazz', 'musician', 'genius', 'e.g', 'Bird', 'have', 'fallen', 'way', 'short', 'leaving', 'average', 'spectator', 'little', 'more', 'picture', 'self-destructive', 'junkie', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'eluded', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'music', 'whom', 'kind', 'film', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'always', 'infectious', 'music', 'alternately', 'bluesy', 'sublime', 'keyboardist', 'extraordinaire', 'Joey', 'DeFranceso']",N/A

1269196,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B002I41KNW,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[11, 13]","A quick summary would be to watch this for Amy Adams, but since she does not get a speaking line until 16 minutes in (her first actual scene flashes by with no lines), and then her singing sounds dubbed (yet still beautiful) one could be wary of this title. It played well in the store if I left it on a chapter repeat where she sings, but I lost every single potential rental when anyone else was ""acting"" or some other scene was taking place.The story follows some corporate/financial guy as he grinds through work in the day and plays the piano/sings by night. He happens to come across a beautiful lady who can sing and their paths become entangled - tangled in horrible writing, atrocious supporting acting, bad sets, poor sound, dimly lit interiors, etc. Writing issues: One scene shows our horribly single main guy in a bar getting hit on by Moon Bloodgood (who looked phenomenal as always - a very short role) but he turns her down for no reason - they could not even write one (what guy would ever turn her down??). Any scene that involves his workplace had customers laughing as they watched it - it looked like a stage play with flubbed lines and bad re-takes. Another scene with Amy singing has her hiding in the street shadows and when you can briefly see her the words do not match, and the list goes on.The sound is average to poor, the picture quality is fine to average - but fake when the moon pictures flash by. The story was either trying to fit in as a musical/romance or a bad time at work film, neither worked on their own, but some of her singing was outstanding. No special features so 2 stars for her singing and zero for everything else.",2,"Beautiful singing by Amy Adams, but a painful movie",1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,1664,"['quick', 'summary', 'would', 'be', 'watch', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'not', 'get', 'speaking', 'line', '16', 'minutes', 'first', 'actual', 'scene', 'flashes', 'lines', 'then', 'singing', 'sounds', 'dubbed', 'yet', 'still', 'beautiful', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'wary', 'title', 'played', 'well', 'store', 'left', 'chapter', 'repeat', 'where', 'lost', 'single', 'potential', 'rental', 'when', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'acting', 'other', 'scene', 'was', 'taking', 'place.The', 'story', 'corporate/financial', 'guy', 'work', 'day', 'piano/sings', 'night', 'come', 'beautiful', 'lady', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'paths', 'become', 'entangled', 'tangled', 'horrible', 'writing', 'atrocious', 'supporting', 'acting', 'bad', 'sets', 'poor', 'sound', 'dimly', 'lit', 'interiors', 'etc', 'Writing', 'issues', 'One', 'scene', 'horribly', 'single', 'main', 'guy', 'bar', 'getting', 'hit', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'who', 'looked', 'phenomenal', 'always', 'very', 'short', 'role', 'down', 'reason', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'write', 'one', 'what', 'guy', 'would', 'ever', 'turn', 'down', 'scene', 'workplace', 'had', 'customers', 'laughing', 'watched', 'looked', 'stage', 'play', 'flubbed', 'lines', 'bad', 're-takes', 'scene', 'Amy', 'singing', 'hiding', 'street', 'shadows', 'when', 'can', 'briefly', 'see', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'list', 'on.The', 'sound', 'average', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'fine', 'average', 'fake', 'when', 'moon', 'pictures', 'flash', 'story', 'was', 'either', 'trying', 'fit', 'musical/romance', 'bad', 'time', 'work', 'film', 'worked', 'own', 'singing', 'was', 'outstanding', 'special', 'features', 'so', '2', 'stars', 'singing', 'zero', 'everything', 'else']",N/A
