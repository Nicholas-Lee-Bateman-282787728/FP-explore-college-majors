I Have A Dream, he repeated between refrains of equality and social justice.  From that speech erupted a movement - his dream become their dream and now it's our dream and closer to reality than ever before.I've heard the speech before, and I've read the speech, but seeing it in its setting was a challenge to our basic institutions.  It was a challenge to Lincoln himself.  A challenge in oration, a challenge in tone, and a challenge to change America morePeter Jennings narrates the dvd and it incorporates raw footage from marches and protests and concludes with a tribute to the man, murdered for his beliefs.  Three hundred thousand people stood before Dr. King that Summer day in 1963 but that's only a fraction of a fraction of those who have been touched by his powerful cadence.
