They don't make shows like this anymore and I find that very upsetting. Amber Tamblyn who plays Joan is a revelation, she brings consistent sarcasm and understanding to the role. Jason Ritter's acting finally shines in season two and I just adore the introduction of Joan's ""camp crazy"" friend, Judith. And boy wasn't Joan's boyfriend, Adam just a total jerk that season! Anyway this show is muchly missed and hope Tamblyn makes another show in the future. I highly recommend checking Joan of Arcadia out, seasons 1 and 2.

1017282,A2RIAXGSBP65BJ,B000HWZ4MA,"Amanda Hamm ""writer""","[4, 5]","The second season did not quite live up to the first.  As Amazon's description already tells you, it begins with Joan having decided that God did not talk to her and she tries to ignore his attempts to reach her.  This is an interesting dramatization of the way people really do ignore God in their lives.  But I felt it went on too long.  Also, Adam spends a good deal of time in the first episode trying to convince her that maybe God really has been talking to her, even carrying around books on the subject, and then completely drops it for the rest of the season.  If he really believed this, you'd think it would have come up again.  It is, after all, not something you hear about every day.I also had a problem with the way the plotline later in the season involving Joan's relationship with Adam was handled.  I feel they missed some serious teachable moments here.Most episodes in the first season had a pretty predictable formula.  ""God"" asks Joan to do something she doesn't want to do, she does it, we see little miracles and we learn something without being preached to.  Predictable or not, this formula worked and there was no reason to move away from it.All in all though, this season was still terrific viewing.  The episode with the feral cat was particularly good and it's almost worth buying the whole season just for the one with the zombie musical.

It received a lot of attention and even won awards during its first season, but for whatever reason, was dismissed in its second season. The season/series finale had the show poised for a terrific third season, had the show continued, with Joan now battling her foe, a young man possibly working for Satan, just as she was ""working"" for God. What a shame that this gem was instead cancelled. Joan was one of the most realistic portrayals of a teenager on television, aside from the fact that she often talked to God, and Amber Tamblyn, her portrayer, is a stand-out. I also loved the portrayal of Joan's older brother, played by Jason Ritter, as a former high school jock who seemed to have everything going for him until a car accident left him in a wheel chair and all the implications this tragedy had for Joan's entire family. The concept of this show was very clever and although Joan talked to God, it never felt too religious or preachy. It was also extremely well-written and acted. This is a show that people of all ages can enjoy and that families can actually watch together.

1017285,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000HWZ4MA,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Futurama was 5 seasons in when Fox decided to unfairly cancelled. While it was a great run, it did feel like it was a perfect time for them to go without being repetitive or ""not as good as it was"" like what people say about the Simpsons. Something like say, Firefly, on the other hand, was cancelled long before we knew where the show was going and what the story arc would be. Joan of Arcadia was a show that found its niche, was developing steam but was cancelled. It's one of those shows that you start to get comfortable with until out of nowhere it's gone.Joan Girardi is a normal high school girl: has a nice(if somewhat deadpan) boyfriend, good friend, nice family but then there's the thing that God keeps talking to her making her do stuff. At the end of last season, Joan was sent to what she calls ""crazy camp"" since there was a possibility that talking to God wasn't real but of course he is. The main threads of the season involve a lawsuit, a questionable boss, Joan's other brother's disability and another guy who knows about God but doesn't share the same sense of reverence.Sometimes it's hard to like shows like this when they're so addicting but then you start to notice inherent flaws that keep popping up. One is that the show does have a formula. Smallville it was a kryptonite freak-of-the-week while cop shows are cases, in this case it's God showing up in different forms, giving Joan a ""mission"", Joan does mission but finds problems, halfway God returns, sometimes with a new face and more advice and end of the episode returns and does a big summary of what Joan learned. While it is fun to find all the different versions of God she sees (mine is probably the weird goth kid with the incredibly anime-inspired hair or the overly-sentimental big guy with a love for poetry and noels), it does get a bit repetitive and a bit too convenient since some people who need help never seem to show up again or even versions of God. Cristy Carlson Romano does one version of God...seriously, and she's in 2 scenes and boom. Did they really need that many Gods?Now is this one of those preachy religious shows that basically acts like a 43 minute Catholic recruitment method? Not really. The religious angle never seems forced although God's avatars sometimes push it with the ""I'm so great""-type lines. Ultimately though the human interest stories is what's great as every character goes through something and it seems at times natural and realistic although some things seem to be really stretching. Despite appearances in films like The Grudge 2, Amber Tamblyn is easily the star of the show, showing the same cutesy lovable side while also being vulnerable and emotional. Some of the other roles are likable but at times they almost seem interchangeable or just not as compelling.The cancellation possibly couldn't have come at a worst time. The show introduced the idea that instead of Joan being God's helper, that a new kid is something entirely different, Joan's full purpose is revealed and you're thinking in a giddy tone ""oh boy, now this is gonna be good!""....but then there's nothing. At least Firefly got a resolution with Serenity and Futurama's coming back but we still don't know how this thread would've unfolded. I hope that we at least get some kind of resolution in some way or the show pulls a Family Guy and comes back but I doubt it.It's always hard purchasing season sets like this since there doesn't seem like a lot of room for repeat viewings. Simpsons, X-Files or Smallville have enough stand-alone episodes so you can watch them out of order and Joan does have it but it's also a bit hard to re-watch. It is a worthwhile show to get into but be warned: there's no end to watch since we never got an end so if you feel frustrated at the lack of an ending, get in line.",5,Curses to CBS for cancelling this,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,3817,"['Futurama', 'was', '5', 'seasons', 'when', 'Fox', 'decided', 'unfairly', 'cancelled', 'was', 'great', 'run', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'perfect', 'time', 'go', 'being', 'repetitive', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'Simpsons', 'Something', 'say', 'Firefly', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'cancelled', 'long', 'knew', 'where', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'story', 'arc', 'would', 'be', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'was', 'show', 'found', 'niche', 'was', 'developing', 'steam', 'was', 'cancelled', 'one', 'shows', 'start', 'get', 'comfortable', 'nowhere', 'gone.Joan', 'Girardi', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'nice', 'somewhat', 'boyfriend', 'good', 'friend', 'nice', 'family', 'then', 'thing', 'God', 'talking', 'making', 'do', 'stuff', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'Joan', 'was', 'sent', 'what', 'crazy', 'camp', 'was', 'possibility', 'talking', 'God', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'course', 'main', 'threads', 'season', 'involve', 'lawsuit', 'questionable', 'boss', 'Joan', 'other', 'brother', 'disability', 'guy', 'who', 'God', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'sense', 'reverence.Sometimes', 'hard', 'like', 'shows', 'when', ""'re"", 'so', 'addicting', 'then', 'start', 'notice', 'inherent', 'flaws', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'One', 'show', 'have', 'formula', 'Smallville', 'was', 'kryptonite', 'freak-of-the-week', 'cop', 'shows', 'are', 'cases', 'case', 'God', 'showing', 'up', 'different', 'forms', 'giving', 'Joan', 'mission', 'Joan', 'mission', 'problems', 'halfway', 'God', 'returns', 'sometimes', 'new', 'face', 'more', 'advice', 'end', 'episode', 'returns', 'big', 'summary', 'what', 'Joan', 'learned', 'fun', 'find', 'different', 'versions', 'God', 'mine', 'probably', 'weird', 'goth', 'kid', 'incredibly', 'anime-inspired', 'hair', 'overly-sentimental', 'big', 'guy', 'love', 'poetry', 'noels', 'get', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'bit', 'too', 'convenient', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'help', 'never', 'seem', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'even', 'versions', 'God', 'Cristy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'one', 'version', 'God', 'seriously', '2', 'scenes', 'boom', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'many', 'Gods', 'Now', 'one', 'preachy', 'religious', 'shows', 'basically', '43', 'minute', 'Catholic', 'recruitment', 'method', 'Not', 'really', 'religious', 'angle', 'never', 'forced', 'God', 'avatars', 'sometimes', 'push', ""'m"", 'so', 'great', '-type', 'lines', 'Ultimately', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'what', 'great', 'character', 'something', 'times', 'natural', 'realistic', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'stretching', 'appearances', 'films', 'Grudge', '2', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'easily', 'star', 'show', 'showing', 'same', 'cutesy', 'lovable', 'side', 'also', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'likable', 'times', 'almost', 'seem', 'interchangeable', 'just', 'not', 'compelling.The', 'cancellation', 'possibly', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'worst', 'time', 'show', 'introduced', 'idea', 'instead', 'Joan', 'being', 'God', 'helper', 'new', 'kid', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'Joan', 'full', 'purpose', 'revealed', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'giddy', 'tone', 'oh', 'boy', 'now', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'good', '.but', 'then', 'nothing', 'least', 'Firefly', 'got', 'resolution', 'Serenity', 'Futurama', 'coming', 'back', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'thread', 'would', ""'ve"", 'unfolded', 'hope', 'least', 'get', 'kind', 'resolution', 'way', 'show', 'Family', 'Guy', 'back', 'doubt', 'always', 'hard', 'purchasing', 'season', 'sets', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lot', 'room', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Simpsons', 'X-Files', 'Smallville', 'have', 'enough', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'can', 'watch', 'order', 'Joan', 'have', 'also', 'bit', 'hard', 're-watch', 'worthwhile', 'show', 'get', 'be', 'warned', 'end', 'watch', 'never', 'got', 'end', 'so', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'ending', 'get', 'line']",Joan of Arcadia - The Second Season

By now, she's recovered from her bout with Lime Disease and, as we discover, has spent the summer in a camp dealing with the so-called psychological effects of the disease.More or less season two carries on the same way as the first season. That is, once Joan realizes/accepts again she WASN'T imagining God up. God still appears to Joan through each episode wanting her to do seemingly pointless stuff that ends up having ripple effects for other characters. If you saw season one, you more or less know exactly what to expect from season two.This season, however, we're given several multi-episode story arcs. The main one being Kevin's old friend who was the drunk driver that caused the wreck that left him paralyzed now suing him and the Girardis. This season we were also introduced to what would have been the show's first real antagonist, Ryan Hunter. Ryan Hunter, like Joan, has been getting visits from God for over a decade since he was a teenager himself. Unlike Joan, Ryan is secretly less than a good person and is implied (heavily) to be the one burning down synagogues and churches in the area. Unfortunately we never get to see how his storyline is resolved as he's only introduced at the end of the second to last episode (clearly the show was expecting to come back for a third season which it sadly didn't get).All in all, I thought season two was just as great as the first.

Joan, you GO girl!  If you care genuinely about pondering big issues like the issue of how God interacts with human beings and Creation in furtherance of His plans -- and about how &#34;the smallest change at the foundation can produce radical differences at the frontier&#34; (to paraphrase physicist Stanley Gudder) (meaning that the smallest and most innocuous-seeming acts have far reaching ramifications) -- you owe it to yourself and to everyone else to watch, and reflect upon, the wisdom-laden episodes of Joan of Arcadia.As an aside:  Joan's brother Luke loves chemistry -- indeed, in an early episode of Season One, God induces Joan to quit being an academic slacker and to enroll in AP Chemistry -- and I cannot help but believe that Barbara Hall (creator/writer of Joan of Arcadia) views chemistry (and all of the other awesome science God created as part of our world) the same way Betty Smith's alter-ego protagonist Francie does in 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn':  &#34;Francie came away from her first chemistry lecture in a glow.  In one hour she had found out that everything was made up of atoms which were in continual motion.  She grasped the idea that nothing was ever lost or destroyed.

1017290,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000HWZ4MA,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[6, 6]","""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" is the complete DVD set for the second and final season of this heaven-sent CBS show, featuring 22 episodes of the program.""Joan of Arcadia"" came to viewers on CBS and slowly became a surprise hit. In the second season, Joan found herself recovering from an experience at ""crazy camp,"" only to find that God has not gone away and is still talking to her. Now, God has more assignments for her, all leading up to her biggest challenge yet --- one that will test her in ways she can barely begin to imagine.Unfortunately, ""Joan"" began to flounder to some degree in the second season. The program began to rely more on outside-writers of dubious quality and stunt-casting and many felt that the show lost the sparkle it once had. But then the show recovered brilliantly with a compelling ending. Unfortunately, by then, the ratings had dropped off and CBS canceled it in favor of a program whose name I won't even bother mentioning. Either way, I missed this show, and so it was great to experience it once again on DVD.This DVD includes crew commentary for four episodes of the second season Since it does not say anywhere on the packaging what episodes have commentary (at least, not on the version I got), I will tell you what they are. The episodes are the season premiere ""Only Connect,"" the eighth episode --- ""Friday Night"" and the final two episodes of the season and series --- ""Common Thread"" and ""Something Wicked This Way Comes."" Unlike some DVD commentaries which are boring or lame, these commentaries are insightful, amusing and reveal facts about the show and the episodes you may not have known. Plus, you can still follow along with the events of the episode by turning on close-captioning. In a way, though, it's slightly painful to listen to these commentaries, only because it's obvious they were recorded before anyone was aware that the show that had been canceled. So you hear the crew talk with great enthusiasm about things they're setting up for the next season and feel pity for them in a way because you know that it's been canceled.""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" includes several other great bonus features on the final disc. You get ""A Look at Season 2,"" featuring the cast and crew discussing the season as a whole. You get a look at the making of the episode ""Queen of the Zombies,"" a rare behind-the-scenes look at all of the major components that went into making the show. There's ""A Tour of Joan's High School,"" a short but revealing feature. Finally, you get ""Common Thread:"" A Table Read, which actually features the cast sitting around a table reading out portions of this episode of the show, cutting to scenes from the finished episode sometimes. This one is especially nice because you actually to get hear a bit of deleted material not seen in the final version.""Joan of Arcadia: The Second Season"" is a must-have for fans of this well-crafted series. If you already have the first season, you'll complete your collection, plus get access to some wonderful bonus stuff. If you've only just recently discovered ""Joan of Arcadia"" or want to, then you might want to look into the first season before looking at this. But it doesn't really matter where you start, this is a wonderful show to watch.",5,It Brings Back Memories,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,3278,"['Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Second', 'Season', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'heaven-sent', 'CBS', 'show', 'featuring', '22', 'episodes', 'program', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'came', 'viewers', 'CBS', 'slowly', 'became', 'surprise', 'hit', 'second', 'season', 'Joan', 'found', 'recovering', 'experience', 'crazy', 'camp', 'only', 'find', 'God', 'not', 'gone', 'away', 'still', 'talking', 'Now', 'God', 'more', 'assignments', 'leading', 'up', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'yet', 'one', 'will', 'test', 'ways', 'can', 'barely', 'begin', 'imagine.Unfortunately', 'Joan', 'began', 'flounder', 'degree', 'second', 'season', 'program', 'began', 'rely', 'more', 'outside-writers', 'dubious', 'quality', 'stunt-casting', 'many', 'felt', 'show', 'lost', 'sparkle', 'once', 'had', 'then', 'show', 'recovered', 'brilliantly', 'compelling', 'ending', 'Unfortunately', 'then', 'ratings', 'had', 'dropped', 'off', 'CBS', 'canceled', 'favor', 'program', 'name', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'mentioning', 'way', 'missed', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'once', 'again', 'DVD.This', 'DVD', 'crew', 'commentary', 'four', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'say', 'anywhere', 'packaging', 'what', 'have', 'commentary', 'least', 'not', 'version', 'got', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', 'premiere', 'Only', 'Connect', 'eighth', 'episode', 'Friday', 'Night', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'series', 'Common', 'Thread', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'Way', 'Comes', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'are', 'boring', 'lame', 'commentaries', 'are', 'insightful', 'amusing', 'reveal', 'facts', 'show', 'episodes', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'can', 'still', 'follow', 'along', 'events', 'episode', 'turning', 'close-captioning', 'way', 'slightly', 'painful', 'listen', 'commentaries', 'only', 'obvious', 'were', 'recorded', 'anyone', 'was', 'aware', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'canceled', 'hear', 'crew', 'talk', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'things', ""'re"", 'setting', 'up', 'next', 'season', 'feel', 'pity', 'way', 'know', 'been', 'canceled', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Second', 'Season', 'several', 'other', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'final', 'disc', 'get', 'Look', 'Season', '2', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'discussing', 'season', 'whole', 'get', 'look', 'making', 'episode', 'Queen', 'Zombies', 'rare', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'major', 'components', 'went', 'making', 'show', 'A', 'Tour', 'Joan', 'High', 'School', 'short', 'revealing', 'feature', 'Finally', 'get', 'Common', 'Thread', 'Table', 'Read', 'actually', 'cast', 'sitting', 'table', 'reading', 'out', 'portions', 'episode', 'show', 'cutting', 'scenes', 'finished', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'one', 'especially', 'nice', 'actually', 'get', 'hear', 'bit', 'deleted', 'material', 'not', 'seen', 'final', 'version', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'Second', 'Season', 'must-have', 'fans', 'well-crafted', 'series', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'season', ""'ll"", 'complete', 'collection', 'get', 'access', 'wonderful', 'bonus', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'only', 'just', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'want', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'first', 'season', 'looking', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'where', 'start', 'wonderful', 'show', 'watch']",Joan of Arcadia - The Second Season

1017292,A2BJ9I0BQ1LH5S,B000HWZ4MA,guitarchick24,"[5, 7]","Joan of Arcadia went off the air after only two seasons, due to falling ratings and a poor time slot during the second year.  The second season starts of strong, but ends on a very wierd note.At the beginning of season two, Joan Girardi has just returned from summer ""crazy camp,"" where she went for the ""psychological problems"" she faced as a result of contracting lyme disease at the end of season one.  God's been silent in her life since she went into the hospital and to camp; now, at the beginning of a new school year, she's hoping that the silence is permanent, and she can be a normal girl with her friends and boyfriend, Adam.Overshadowing season two is a lawsuit brought by Kevin Girardi's former best friend, who was driving drunk and caused the accident that paralyzed Kevin.  The lawsuit becomes a catalyst for some of the family members to face their own views on God.Still with the great writing and clever insights about growing up, the situations in Joan of Arcadia become more complex as the plots continue to develop.  At times it feels like the characters go through a little too much (how many people can die? how many bad things can happen to the family in one year?).  Well, it is a drama.The end of the season (and show) introduces Ryan, another person who can see and talk to God as Joan does.  He saves Adam during a rainstorm, and while everyone thinks Ryan's a great guy and can do no wrong, Joan is suspicious of him and quickly learns that he has his own, sinister agenda.While I know they needed a cliff-hanger ending to keep the people hooked, the Joan vs. evil personified thing just seemed a little hokey.  Since the show ended after season two, we'll never know how the impending battle played out.  Given that it seemed a poor way to end the season (I preferred the ""faith tested"" ending of season one - it just seemed more relatable), perhaps it was a good thing that the show ended when it did.",4,"Strong start to the second season, but fizzles at the end",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1933,"['Joan', 'Arcadia', 'went', 'air', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'due', 'falling', 'ratings', 'poor', 'time', 'slot', 'second', 'year', 'second', 'season', 'starts', 'strong', 'very', 'wierd', 'beginning', 'season', 'two', 'Joan', 'Girardi', 'just', 'returned', 'summer', 'crazy', 'camp', 'where', 'went', 'psychological', 'problems', 'faced', 'result', 'contracting', 'lyme', 'disease', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'God', 'been', 'silent', 'life', 'went', 'hospital', 'camp', 'now', 'beginning', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'hoping', 'silence', 'permanent', 'can', 'be', 'normal', 'girl', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'Adam.Overshadowing', 'season', 'two', 'lawsuit', 'brought', 'Kevin', 'Girardi', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'drunk', 'caused', 'accident', 'paralyzed', 'Kevin', 'lawsuit', 'catalyst', 'family', 'members', 'face', 'own', 'views', 'God.Still', 'great', 'writing', 'clever', 'insights', 'growing', 'up', 'situations', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'become', 'more', 'complex', 'plots', 'continue', 'develop', 'times', 'characters', 'go', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'die', 'how', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'family', 'one', 'year', 'Well', 'drama.The', 'end', 'season', 'show', 'Ryan', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'talk', 'God', 'Joan', 'Adam', 'rainstorm', 'everyone', 'Ryan', 'great', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Joan', 'suspicious', 'quickly', 'own', 'sinister', 'agenda.While', 'know', 'needed', 'cliff-hanger', 'ending', 'keep', 'people', 'hooked', 'Joan', 'vs.', 'evil', 'personified', 'thing', 'just', 'seemed', 'little', 'hokey', 'show', 'ended', 'season', 'two', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'how', 'impending', 'battle', 'played', 'out', 'Given', 'seemed', 'poor', 'way', 'end', 'season', 'preferred', 'faith', 'tested', 'ending', 'season', 'one', 'just', 'seemed', 'more', 'relatable', 'perhaps', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'ended', 'when', 'did']",Joan of Arcadia - The Second Season
1017293,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000HWZ4MA,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[1, 1]","I repeat, this 22 episode season is better than season one-which was GREAT. A family life drama which incorporates all age levels, comedy, suspense, mystery, romance, well...everything. The middle child of the family has a recurring encounter with God (never tied to any one religion, for those who care). God appears as a human form, in all ages, genders, occupations, and races. It's a pretty generic god but a very moral one. He directs Joan (of Arcadia) to tackle situations, usually simple, but just not her thing. Her comfort zones are tested.What she discovers, usually sheds some light on a sub plot, an event happening to one or two other members of the family, or friends.It's delightful, and season two gets into much meatier issues than season one had. That's what makes it better. Otherwise, same great cast. Don't expect all episodes to end sweetly, however.Actually you could enjoy this set as is, without the first season, but you'll likely want to see both season, so my recommendation is order both. they are worth it. Read the reviews. I found Joan of Arcadia late, thus my reviews are well after first release. But the show is worthy anytime. Since episodes carry over into the next, often, it's nice to see them on DVD instead of TV, so you can go directly into the next. 16 hours (+ tons of fun extras) makes this a financial value. 16 hrs = over 10 full-length movies.

In my opinion, there are many reasons why this season wasn't good enough to get the show renewed. For one, much of the tension of the previous season due to Joan's relationship with Adam flew out the window. As so many of us know, good shows have a tendency to fall apart when the two star-crossed lovers get together. I feel that this was one of those cases.Joan of Arcadia was a good show, and it's too bad that it didn't get renewed. Maybe the writers could have gotten their acts together. There were many flaws with this season, though, from Kevin's awkward relationship with an old flame, to the drama with Joan's friend Judith, to the teen angst-filled mini saga surrounding the question of whether or not Joan and Adam are going to ""Do It"". Sloppy writing and an excruciating guest stint by Annie Potts brought this promising show down, and it's a shame.All in all, this DVD set is best reserved for the folks who watched the show every week it was on.

In the form of a cute teenage boy on the street, of an elderly woman volunteering at her school, or of someone on television, Joan keeps getting messages from God, telling her what she needs to do.It's about the last thing Joan needs. She's just moved to Arcadia, where her dad Will is the new police chief, and she and her geeky younger brother Luke have to get used to a new school. Meanwhile, Joan's older brother Kevin has his own struggles since becoming a paraplegic in a car wreck just after high school graduation -- struggles which have drastically changed the entire family.More interestingly, Joan's mother Helen also begins to experience dreams and encounters much like her daughter's...unbeknownest to either of them. Geeky Luke falls in love with tough Grace, who is actually softer than she likes to admit; Kevin struggles to find closure regarding the accident; and Joan discovers that just as she has chosen to become God's follower, others may have chosen the alternate path and will fight her til the bitter end.Although Joan doesn't understand the directions that God gives her, she does her best to obey...even when it causes misunderstandings and sometimes arguments between herself and those around her. Ultimately, she tends to see that whatever God tells her to do ends in a positive change reaction, such as when she befriends a classmate named Adam, whose father is a janitor for the police department, and knows of an impounded handicapped accessible car that could help Kevin put his life back together.In Season 2, Joan learns to pay closer attention to the people around her -- including her now-boyfriend Adam, whose family fell apart after his mother's suicide three years earlier; and Grace, the rebel only daughter of a rabbi and an alcoholic mother. She also finds out, the hard way, that she cannot save everyone.This was, quite unexpectedly, one of my all-time favorite television shows.

Now that time has elapsed, upon watching both seasons, I appreciate the second season at least as much as the first.Joan has a crisis of faith, has her faith renewed, and goes through a lot of changes, as adolescents do. Some of those changes were difficult ones, as life's decisions can be for us all.

Happy, sad, touching and always well-acted. The only show in the history of TV to be nominated for best drama in it's first season. Wonderfully moving.God, in various guises, is a character. Joan, like Joan of Arc, has conversations with him. God gives Joan a variety of assignments always with cryptic explanations. Sometimes she questions, sometimes she rebels, eventually she always tries to follow what He says, as best she can. The show demonstates the unexpected interconnectedness of actions.It doesn't offer the pat answers and convenient simplicities which appeal to fundamentalists. God is more complicated. I guess that's what happened to it, a show about Spirit, a show which made people think about religious or spiritual matters in a new and unusual way. Cynics hated it. Materialists didn't care. Fundamentalists were REALLY challenged.It takes a person with some desire for growth to appreciate this show. JofA resonates with People of Spirit.Season two is more uneven than season one.

It was poignant in a way that is difficult to find.  I bought both seasons on DVD recently to watch it again.  I just finished watching the last episode of Season 2.  It is the ultimate disappointment that they didn't do a wrap-up episode for the show.  To end in that way... it discredited the premise of the Joan of Arcadia series.  There are many people on the web that are not happy with the way the show was abruptly canceled.  I hope CBS is paying attention. Perhaps some movie company/cable station would do a reunion show or two.  Most of the cast members are actively working in some capacity and this would be a project that would have a lot of fan support.  Wake up and smell the potential revenue Producers and Investors.

1017304,A1NW04AD2WTUDY,B000HWZ4MA,Rosie,"[2, 2]","When this show first aired, I caught only a few episodes, having been otherwise occupied on the nights it played. I remembered it as being stirring and since I had become a recent devotee of the amazing NBC series Parenthood, another Jason Ritter vehicle, I thought I'd rewatch the entire series of Joan of Arcadia, which comprises just two seasons. (I've been a full-fledged long-time fan of many of the shows the other Parenthood actors were in, including Gilmore Girls, Coach, and Everybody Loves Raymond, so I thought I'd check out Ritter's other work, too.)To my relief, I found Joan of Arcadia to be one of the most--if not the most--thought-provoking, well-acted, well-thought-through series ever. It touched on so many profound topics, such as life and death, disability and ability, good and evil, and, of course, believing and nonbelieving, and it was done in such a way as to always be entertaining and oftentimes funny.It is basically about an ordinary teenage girl, Joan, played by Amber Tamblyn, who has recently moved to the fictional town of Arcadia with her family, dad Joe Mantegna, a police chief/detective; mom Mary Steenburgen, who starts out as a secretary at Joan's school and then becomes the art teacher (she also becomes more spiritual throughout the series, which leads to some interesting revelations); older brother Jason Ritter, a paraplegic who used to be a high school jock; and younger brother Michael Welch, who is a math and science prodigy and to whom Joan often comes for possible scientific explanations for her encounters with God. Throughout the series, Joan never fully reveals her connection to God--when she alludes to it, she quickly dismisses it in order to fit in. I think a full revelation was upcoming in season 3, as Joan was about to do battle with the character portraying evil and as her mother's newfound spiritual connection progressed.Amber Tamblyn is amazing--probably the best young actress of her time (why isn't she in more series or movies?), as are her back-ups, especially Mary Steenburgen. But all the actors portray their characters extremely well and are equally believable. Joan is an average teenager, not one with a special gift, until the God characters approach her to, first, do His work in small ways and then, at the end of season two, to challenge evil.I can't say enough good stuff about this show. It is a travesty that it didn't survive past two seasons. This is definitely one that was killed off before its time. It deserved a third season, which, with the final episode of season two, was ramping up to be incredible. What a godawful shame that that season never came to fruition.
