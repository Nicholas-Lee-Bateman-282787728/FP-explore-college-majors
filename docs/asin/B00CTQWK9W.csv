The acting is wooden and almost comes across like joke. The suppossidly special effects are bad even by today's amatuer computer standards. I felt like it was 1978 all over again and I wasn't even alive then. Please just avoid at all cost if you have to pay more than free for this. This is a very flat & lifeless film experence in every way not a enjoyable moment AT ALL. I feel for the people that were envolved I hope they can redeem themselves in the industry. Danny Trejo only had like 15 mins of screen time in the whole thing. Everything just felt like it was pasted in and feathered from a videogame. The director and writer actually appears in this muddled mess which obviously means he felt pretty positive about it. If you can see this for free and want to laugh please be my guest. This is defintley mystery science theater 3000 worthy at best.

1650884,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00CTQWK9W,Drew from Oregon,"[0, 1]","I was fortunate enough to receive a review copy of this film to review.  My review may contain spoilers.  Here it is:The Cloth is not your typical Horror movie with traditional exorcisms being performed throughout.  It provides a different twist as to how good fights against evil with different levels of weapons depending on the level of demon being fought.Starring Danny Trejo and Eric Roberts, as well as a number of other B-movie actors, The Cloth falls just a bit flat of being an exceptional movie mainly due to the horrible CGI effects within the film; I really wanted to like this movie, but the cheesy graphics throughout the film took my attention away from the actual story line.  At one point, I noticed things completely disappear when they should have still been in the frame.The Cloth starts out with a traditional exorcism being performed by Father Connley (Danny Trejo) and another priest.  There was a lot of promise for this film at this point because some disturbing images, blood, and gore were included in this part of the film, which was appropriate given the scene of the priests exorcising a demon.  As they have a hard time exorcising this demon, Father Connley dies during this struggle.Jason (Kyler Willett) isn't really religious at all, so he really doesn't believe in god.  His family had been killed from an accident, so this was the reason why his faith had eventually waned.  Jason is recruited by the exorcists to help them fight against the demons because his father had been one and wanted him to follow in his footsteps.  Jason is reluctant at first, but he finally decides to join them in the fight.Jason learns from the in-house historian Laurel (Perla Rodriguez) that the 5th Satan appears in human form and his name is Kasdeya (Justin Price).  He seeks people who have turned their back on god.  Once Kasdeya arrives, he has to return to his realm within seven days.  Basically, they don't want Kasdeya to take any lost souls with him.Jason also learns about the weapons from their weapons specialist, Helix (Cameron White).  All the weapons are made from metals that were found in the Ark of the Covenant.  The level of weapon to be used is dependent upon which demon possesses a person as well.  Despite all of these new weapons, Father Diekmen (Lassiter Holmes) reminds Jason that the essential weapons are still holy water and crosses.Jason finally goes out with Father Diekmen to fight some demons that are possessing people.  After a couple days of fighting, Jason decides to give up because he is sick of what he sees and being pushed around.  Laurel, the historian, eventually goes to Jason's place to convince him to come back, which Jason, eventually, agrees to.  Jason actually finds out later that Laurel was possessed at one point in her past and his father was the one who was able to save her.The seventh and final night, Jason and Father Diekmen go out to find Kasdeya to kill him.  Kasdeya finally shows up and they have an exchange of words and a battle ensues; however, after all of this is done, there is a twist at the end of the film that I shall not reveal.Despite the horrible graphics at times, there were actually some pretty promising graphics as well, but it just wasn't consistent enough throughout the whole movie to appreciate.  The music throughout the movie was actually very good and I was able to appreciate that, but I was a bit disappointed in the story line and how they killed the demons.  As the demons had been possessing people, it appears to defeat the demons; they are actually killing the people, or vessels, that the demons have taken over.  That was a hole in the story that I didn't really get, nor was it really explained in the film either.Overall, The Cloth is not the worst movie I've seen, but it still needs a bit of help in order to get a higher rating from me.  It really seems like one of those cheesy SyFy Original movies that you see on TV.  With that being said, the film wasn't a waste of time either as there were some entertaining elements in it as well.  Overall, I give this film an average 3/5 star rating.  It's worth at least one look.Overall rating:  3/5 starsSpecial Features:Making of The ClothWeapons of The ClothDeleted and Alternate Scenes""Hell and Back"" Music Video",3,An Honest Review,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,4283,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'receive', 'review', 'copy', 'film', 'review', 'My', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Here', 'Cloth', 'not', 'typical', 'Horror', 'movie', 'traditional', 'exorcisms', 'being', 'performed', 'different', 'twist', 'how', 'good', 'fights', 'evil', 'different', 'levels', 'weapons', 'depending', 'level', 'demon', 'being', 'fought.Starring', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'other', 'B-movie', 'actors', 'Cloth', 'just', 'bit', 'flat', 'being', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'mainly', 'due', 'horrible', 'CGI', 'effects', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'graphics', 'film', 'took', 'attention', 'away', 'actual', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'point', 'noticed', 'things', 'completely', 'disappear', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'frame.The', 'Cloth', 'out', 'traditional', 'exorcism', 'being', 'performed', 'Father', 'Connley', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'priest', 'was', 'lot', 'promise', 'film', 'point', 'disturbing', 'images', 'blood', 'gore', 'were', 'included', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'appropriate', 'given', 'scene', 'priests', 'exorcising', 'demon', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'exorcising', 'demon', 'Father', 'Connley', 'struggle.Jason', 'Kyler', 'Willett', ""n't"", 'really', 'religious', 'really', ""n't"", 'believe', 'god', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'accident', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'faith', 'had', 'eventually', 'waned', 'Jason', 'recruited', 'exorcists', 'help', 'fight', 'demons', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'wanted', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Jason', 'reluctant', 'first', 'finally', 'join', 'fight.Jason', 'in-house', 'historian', 'Laurel', 'Perla', 'Rodriguez', '5th', 'Satan', 'human', 'form', 'name', 'Kasdeya', 'Justin', 'Price', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'back', 'god', 'Once', 'Kasdeya', 'arrives', 'return', 'realm', 'seven', 'days', 'Basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Kasdeya', 'take', 'lost', 'souls', 'him.Jason', 'also', 'weapons', 'weapons', 'specialist', 'Helix', 'Cameron', 'White', 'weapons', 'are', 'made', 'metals', 'were', 'found', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'level', 'weapon', 'be', 'used', 'dependent', 'demon', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'weapons', 'Father', 'Diekmen', 'Lassiter', 'Holmes', 'Jason', 'essential', 'weapons', 'are', 'still', 'holy', 'water', 'crosses.Jason', 'finally', 'out', 'Father', 'Diekmen', 'fight', 'demons', 'are', 'possessing', 'people', 'couple', 'days', 'fighting', 'Jason', 'give', 'up', 'sick', 'what', 'being', 'pushed', 'Laurel', 'historian', 'eventually', 'Jason', 'place', 'convince', 'come', 'back', 'Jason', 'eventually', 'Jason', 'actually', 'out', 'later', 'Laurel', 'was', 'possessed', 'one', 'point', 'past', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'save', 'her.The', 'seventh', 'final', 'night', 'Jason', 'Father', 'Diekmen', 'go', 'out', 'find', 'Kasdeya', 'kill', 'Kasdeya', 'finally', 'up', 'have', 'exchange', 'words', 'battle', 'however', 'done', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'shall', 'not', 'reveal.Despite', 'horrible', 'graphics', 'times', 'were', 'actually', 'pretty', 'promising', 'graphics', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'enough', 'whole', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'killed', 'demons', 'demons', 'had', 'been', 'possessing', 'people', 'defeat', 'demons', 'are', 'actually', 'killing', 'people', 'vessels', 'demons', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'was', 'hole', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'was', 'really', 'explained', 'film', 'either.Overall', 'Cloth', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'bit', 'help', 'order', 'get', 'higher', 'rating', 'really', 'one', 'cheesy', 'SyFy', 'Original', 'movies', 'see', 'TV', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'were', 'entertaining', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'give', 'film', 'average', '3/5', 'star', 'rating', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'look.Overall', 'rating', '3/5', 'starsSpecial', 'Features', 'Making', 'ClothWeapons', 'ClothDeleted', 'Alternate', 'Scenes', 'Hell', 'Back', 'Music', 'Video']",The Cloth

1650886,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00CTQWK9W,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","I love a good religious horror or demon possession film. My background as a Christian gives me a certain appreciation for what many critics call hokey sensationalist cinema and B-movie trash. I've seen the good ones (""The Exorcist,"" ""Devil"") and I've seen the bad ones (""The Exorcist Tapes,"" ""The Last Exorcism Part II""). Unfortunately, Uncork'd Entertainment's ""The Cloth"" falls well below the threshold of bad and plunges into the abyss of laughably unwatchable.Cases of demonic possessions are on the rise across the country. A faithless young man (Kyler Willett) is recruited by the Catholic Church into a secret organization of demon hunters. He teams up with a priest (Lassiter Holmes) as they track down the forces of evil and strive to put an end to Satan's stronghold on humankind.I can only describe ""The Cloth"" as a horribly made Christian film clumsily fashioned together by mainstream independent movie producers devoid of any real religious slant who own an HD camera and iMovie program. Imagine graduates of Roman Polanski or William Friedkin's school of filmmaking being to blame for those ""Tribulation"" disasters and you get where I'm going with this. Its sexual content makes it pretty clear a Christian audience was not in mind while making the film.Imagine an Asylum film completely devoid of the self-aware humor and wit we've come to expect from films like ""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus"" or the more recent ""Sharknado."" ""The Cloth"" takes itself seriously all the way to the closing credits. This makes scenes of a priest shooting possessed people with a demon-killing gun as they explode into digitally animated pieces even harder to sit through. As hard as it is to believe, the CGI is worse than anything you've seen in any Asylum movie or SyFy Channel original movie.The one character in the film that I found humorous and likable was the guy who provided the holy weapons to the two lead characters. If the movie was focused on him, it would've been a lot more enjoyable. His British accent and punk rock look and sensibilities added a level of fun to his scenes that the rest of the movie is sorely lacking. The guy wears t-shirts with slogans like ""Exorcise Regularly."" Need I go into any more explanation?I will say that the scenes of demonic possession which aren't cluttered with bad CGI look good. Whoever did the makeup and practical effects deserve some applause for the most part. The exorcism scene at the beginning showed promise that the rest of the film couldn't deliver.Danny Trejo is featured on the cover of ""The Cloth"" DVD as if he appears in the entire film. Be aware this is not the case. He is in what amounts to about 5 minutes of the 89-minute running time. Eric Roberts is also named as one of the main actors. He plays a priest and figures into maybe 5 minutes of screen time as well.""The Cloth"" includes a few extra features. I'm not sure anyone will care after watching it. There are two featurettes entitled ""Making of 'The Cloth'"" and ""Weapons of 'The Cloth.'"" Deleted and alternate scenes are also found. We're blessed with a music video for the song ""Hell and Back"" as well.As much as I hate saying this about any movie, ""The Cloth"" has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's a haphazard attempt at combining the elements of much better films like ""Constantine"" and ""End of Days."" I hope Danny Trejo and Eric Roberts were paid well enough to justify them wasting their time and talents on this drivel.",2,"""The Cloth"" Fails to Offer Any Thrills or Chills",1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,3458,"['love', 'good', 'religious', 'horror', 'demon', 'possession', 'film', 'background', 'Christian', 'certain', 'appreciation', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'call', 'hokey', 'sensationalist', 'cinema', 'B-movie', 'trash', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'ones', 'Exorcist', 'Devil', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bad', 'ones', 'Exorcist', 'Tapes', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Part', 'II', 'Unfortunately', 'Uncork', ""'d"", 'Entertainment', 'Cloth', 'well', 'threshold', 'bad', 'abyss', 'laughably', 'unwatchable.Cases', 'demonic', 'possessions', 'are', 'rise', 'country', 'faithless', 'young', 'man', 'Kyler', 'Willett', 'recruited', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'secret', 'organization', 'demon', 'hunters', 'up', 'priest', 'Lassiter', 'Holmes', 'track', 'down', 'forces', 'evil', 'strive', 'put', 'end', 'Satan', 'stronghold', 'humankind.I', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'Cloth', 'horribly', 'made', 'Christian', 'film', 'clumsily', 'fashioned', 'together', 'mainstream', 'independent', 'movie', 'producers', 'devoid', 'real', 'religious', 'slant', 'who', 'own', 'HD', 'camera', 'iMovie', 'program', 'Imagine', 'graduates', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'being', 'blame', 'Tribulation', 'disasters', 'get', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'sexual', 'content', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Christian', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'mind', 'making', 'film.Imagine', 'Asylum', 'film', 'completely', 'devoid', 'self-aware', 'humor', 'wit', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'films', 'Mega', 'Shark', 'vs', 'Giant', 'Octopus', 'more', 'recent', 'Sharknado', 'Cloth', 'seriously', 'way', 'closing', 'credits', 'scenes', 'priest', 'shooting', 'possessed', 'people', 'demon-killing', 'gun', 'explode', 'digitally', 'animated', 'pieces', 'even', 'harder', 'sit', 'through', 'As', 'hard', 'believe', 'CGI', 'worse', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Asylum', 'movie', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'original', 'movie.The', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'found', 'humorous', 'likable', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'provided', 'holy', 'weapons', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'movie', 'was', 'focused', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'British', 'accent', 'punk', 'rock', 'look', 'sensibilities', 'added', 'level', 'fun', 'scenes', 'rest', 'movie', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'guy', 'wears', 't-shirts', 'slogans', 'Exorcise', 'Regularly', 'Need', 'go', 'more', 'explanation', 'will', 'say', 'scenes', 'demonic', 'possession', 'are', ""n't"", 'cluttered', 'bad', 'CGI', 'look', 'good', 'did', 'makeup', 'practical', 'effects', 'deserve', 'applause', 'most', 'part', 'exorcism', 'scene', 'beginning', 'showed', 'promise', 'rest', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'deliver.Danny', 'Trejo', 'featured', 'cover', 'Cloth', 'DVD', 'entire', 'film', 'Be', 'aware', 'not', 'case', 'what', 'amounts', '5', 'minutes', '89-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'also', 'named', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'priest', 'figures', 'maybe', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'well', 'Cloth', 'few', 'extra', 'features', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'will', 'care', 'watching', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Making', ""'The"", 'Cloth', 'Weapons', ""'The"", 'Cloth', 'Deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'found', ""'re"", 'blessed', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Hell', 'Back', 'well.As', 'much', 'hate', 'saying', 'movie', 'Cloth', 'absolutely', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'haphazard', 'attempt', 'combining', 'elements', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'Constantine', 'End', 'Days', 'hope', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'were', 'paid', 'well', 'enough', 'justify', 'wasting', 'time', 'talents', 'drivel']",The Cloth
