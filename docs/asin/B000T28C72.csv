The plot revolves around a couple that murders people to get a thrill in the marrige. You see many character transitions in the film, most notably the way Tanya becomes desensitized and addicted to murder. I would recommend it, its a very very dark comedy. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll enjoy the film.",4,Entertaining.,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,399,"['watched', 'movie', 'FX', 'network', 'one', 'morning', 'found', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'plot', 'around', 'couple', 'murders', 'people', 'get', 'thrill', 'marrige', 'see', 'many', 'character', 'transitions', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'way', 'Tanya', 'desensitized', 'addicted', 'murder', 'would', 'recommend', 'very', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film']",Redrum
