And watch the movie in the language it was made.--SPOILERS--An 'empowered' genius female hacker with a big dragon tattoo teams up with an investigator to solve the mystery of a missing girl. She was abused as girl, then by her case worker handling her rehabilitation. She also gets assaulted by men in public. And it turns out the missing girl was repeatedly raped too and was just one victim among countless others of a murderous serial killer rapist Nazi relative and another rapist, serial killer relative. It isn't surprising when they're revealed. I was intrigued by the parallels between tattoo girl and missing girl. Lots of abuse. And a perfect finish to one villain repeats the fate of another. That's what you get when you mess with... The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo! You get burned, baby. Male pigs. I found out after watching the movie the book was originally titled ""Men Who Hate Women"" but was changed for marketing purposes. Smart move. But it can't be argued the author's chosen title doesn't fit his story.I'm curious to see what David Fincher does with this material because stylistically speaking this film adaptation has the feel of a made-for-TV film.

I greatly enjoyed Larsson's book and I also enjoyed the movie.  They're quite a bit different, but there's no reason why they shouldn't be.

1343198,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B003FBNJ4U,Acute Observer,"[4, 6]","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 2010 filmThis film runs on too long with a story about Swedish society (an aristocracy of big landowners, bankers, and industrialists). It has many repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes ""The Big Sleep"", ""Chinatown"", and ""Roseanna"". It starts with a libel suit then turns into a murder mystery (like many of the ""Perry Mason"" novels). Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population. It does warn you about the Internet and how it was designed to allow governmental agencies and others to hack into your computer. Is there a political agenda via the characters in this story?An old man receives a package from Hong Kong. What does it mean? Mikael Blomkvist is convicted of libel for claiming millionaire Wennerstr&ouml;m was guilty of gun-running and other crimes. [Would an experienced journalist make this mistake?] Micke will pay a 150,000 kroner fine and go to jail for his malicious report. Who is taking photos of Micke? Researcher Salander says Blomkvist was set up with forged documents. [The danger of a sole source.] Dirch Frode calls Micke with a job for client Henrik Vanger (of the Vanger group of companies). Vanger lives on the island of Hederby; a long bridge connects it to the city of Hederstad. Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared in 1965. She was Micke's babysitter then! ""She just disappeared."" Murdered?The computer researcher has a new probation officer; he asks questions about her finances, her piercings, and her sex life. Is she obstinate? After Harriet disappeared Henrik Vanger continued to receive a framed flower every year. He wants to know the truth. [Does he have suspicions?] Salander taps into Micke's laptop to spy on him. We see life in a Swedish subway. [Where is Paul Kersey?] Micke does research into the Vanger family history. What can he find out after forty years? What do those 5-digit telephone numbers mean? He looks at old negatives from the local newspaper. Will he find a clue? [Like ""Blowup""?] He learns how he was set up with forged documents. [No other research?]Salander asks for 20,000 kroner for a new laptop. Her probation officer insists she be nice to him. [An expose of a corrupt probation system?] Micke notices an overlooked clue in those old photos. Who is the man in a blue sweater? Why has ""Wasp"" hacked into his computer? What is in the Book of Leviticus? Micke asks Lisbeth for help. They look into an earlier killing. ""Are you okay?"" [Is there symbolism in the cigarette smoking?] Liv was murdered in 1949, before Harriet was born. [Note the manufacturer of that hired car.] Are they under surveillance? [Ketchup on eggs?] Is that amber necklace a clue? Who shot at Micke? Was it a ""hunting accident""? They learn the identity of ""BJ"". Is there a common pattern?Salander looks up old records and finds a name. Micke learns the shocking truth! ""You can't leave any witnesses."" [Can you believe this revolting discovery?] Will help arrive in time? [Of course.] Will there be poetic justice in a car crash? [Like ""Boomerang""?] Will Salander shed light on her past? Will the crimes of a serial killer be exposed? ""He's not coming back."" ""We don't know anything."" ""You choose who you want to be."" [More irony?] Micke visits Australia, Salander visits her mother. There is a reunion and an exposure of family secrets. Salander brings reading material to imprisoned Micke. Will this expose gun-running and drug trafficking for a happy ending? [The book ""Compromised"" did the same.] Who was the blond woman who embezzled millions from a Cayman Islands bank?Overall, does this story have redeeming social values? Parts of this story seem implausible. It is an average story hyped with some repulsive scenes. A journalist convicted of libel provides ""plausible denial"" for his employer. Lisbeth provides added complications and contrast.

However, I have recently watched the more recent film starring Daniel Craig and produced with American money.  As a result, it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two films.As much as it may pain some people, I found myself enjoying the Craig film much more.  In terms of plot, they are near identical although I cannot comment on how closely they both following the original book.  Indeed, the only difference I noted was that the surviving niece was located in Australia rather than London.  This is just a minor detail and makes no impact upon the overall plot.""The Girl with Dragon Tattoo"" is certainly a dark and menacing film. I was thoroughly taken in by the plot which, although full of various twists and turns, was not difficult to follow.  The screenwriter has done an admirable job.  Too often films can be let down by plot complexities where the viewer is perplexed as to what happened.So, overall this is a good production.  But, as I stated at the outset, the second film is superior to this original.  I might add that this conclusion of mine has nothing to do with sub-titles or dubbing.  It is simply an honest opinion and comparison of the two efforts.  Regardless, I encourage people to see both.  Come to your own conclusions.

1343220,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B003FBNJ4U,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","I'm a fervent and early fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  I would have flown to another city to watch this film if I had to.  Luckily, I live in one of the country's best cities for art house cinema:  Dallas.  Yes, contrary to the expected stereotypes I always have to bat down when I tell out-of-town friends this fact: Dallas has a tremendous art house cinema culture.  And, as testament to that, we got ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" very early.  What a thrill for us.I am not going to claim that the movie is better than the book.  What makes the books so compelling are the monster-deep dives Larsson takes into varied areas like investigative journalism, corruption, hacking, mafia, governmental affairs, mafia-government connections, intelligence agencies, detectives..and a host of others.  What makes the first book spin is its dual axes of investigative journalism and hacking, personified respectively by Larsson's two protagonists, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  In the movie, something's gotta give: there's just no earthly way director Niels Arden Oplev is going to be able to fit all of Larsson's work into a film of slightly less than three hours.So what Oplev does is strip the story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger.  It's this case that serendipitously brings Blomkvist and Salander together.  In the process of the focus, we lose some of the flavor that is the hallmark of the book, most notably much of the investigative journalism as practiced inside the walls of Millennium magazine.  Millennium's editor, Erika Berger, is but a footnote in the movie but a big part of the book.  Likewise, little attention is given to the so-called ""Wennerstr&ouml;m Affair,"" the personal and professional downfall that befalls Mikael at the book's outset.  Indeed, the first third of the book focuses mainly on these two elements of the tale.Similarly, we lose out on some other aspects of Mikael's character.  Mainly, his babe-magnetism.  In the movie, he and Salander develop a sexual relationship.  [Indeed, it's undertones of the memories of this relationship that drives much of books two and three.]  But the movie has removed the sexual aspects from two of the other relationships Mikael has with female characters.Despite all that, this movie lives and dies on one turn: it's ability to 'get it right' with its casting of Lisbeth.  Over and over I would to my wife ""Lisbeth better be good.""  And she'd tell me the same thing repeatedly.  And others I know have the same mantra: don't mess with my ideal vision of Lisbeth.  In that light, Noomi Rapace represents deliverance.  She scored the essence of the character: we want Lisbeth to have that mix of smarts, hardened exterior, quirky beauty, ferocity and manic energy that drives the book.  Ms. Rapace delivers all that in spades.  She's maybe a little less elfin than the character described by Larsson, but other than that, she's the Lisbeth from my head.I urge all fans of the book to see this enjoyable adaptation.  [The producers had the smarts to make all three movies at once, so the other two are headed this way.]  This is a Swedish story through and through.  It deserves to be seen in Swedish.",5,Director Niels Arden Oplev strips Larsson's story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,3208,"[""'m"", 'fervent', 'early', 'fan', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'Millennium', 'Trilogy', 'would', 'have', 'flown', 'city', 'watch', 'film', 'had', 'Luckily', 'live', 'one', 'country', 'best', 'cities', 'art', 'house', 'cinema', 'Dallas', 'Yes', 'contrary', 'expected', 'stereotypes', 'always', 'have', 'bat', 'down', 'when', 'tell', 'out-of-town', 'friends', 'fact', 'Dallas', 'tremendous', 'art', 'house', 'cinema', 'culture', 'testament', 'got', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'very', 'early', 'What', 'thrill', 'us.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'claim', 'movie', 'better', 'book', 'What', 'books', 'compelling', 'are', 'monster-deep', 'dives', 'Larsson', 'varied', 'areas', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'corruption', 'hacking', 'mafia', 'governmental', 'affairs', 'mafia-government', 'connections', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'detectives..and', 'host', 'others', 'What', 'first', 'book', 'spin', 'dual', 'axes', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'hacking', 'personified', 'respectively', 'Larsson', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'movie', 'something', 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'just', 'earthly', 'way', 'director', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'fit', 'Larsson', 'work', 'film', 'slightly', 'less', 'three', 'hours.So', 'what', 'Oplev', 'strip', 'story', 'down', 'core', 'hunt', 'Harriet', 'Vanger', 'case', 'serendipitously', 'Blomkvist', 'Salander', 'together', 'process', 'focus', 'lose', 'flavor', 'hallmark', 'book', 'most', 'notably', 'much', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'practiced', 'walls', 'Millennium', 'magazine', 'Millennium', 'editor', 'Erika', 'Berger', 'footnote', 'movie', 'big', 'part', 'book', 'Likewise', 'little', 'attention', 'given', 'so-called', 'Wennerstr', 'ouml', 'Affair', 'personal', 'professional', 'downfall', 'Mikael', 'book', 'outset', 'Indeed', 'first', 'third', 'book', 'mainly', 'two', 'elements', 'tale.Similarly', 'lose', 'out', 'other', 'aspects', 'Mikael', 'character', 'Mainly', 'babe-magnetism', 'movie', 'Salander', 'develop', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Indeed', 'undertones', 'memories', 'relationship', 'much', 'books', 'two', 'three', ']', 'movie', 'removed', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'two', 'other', 'relationships', 'Mikael', 'female', 'characters.Despite', 'movie', 'one', 'turn', 'ability', ""'get"", 'right', 'casting', 'Lisbeth', 'Over', 'would', 'wife', 'Lisbeth', 'better', 'be', 'good', ""'d"", 'tell', 'same', 'thing', 'repeatedly', 'others', 'know', 'have', 'same', 'mantra', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'ideal', 'vision', 'Lisbeth', 'light', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'deliverance', 'scored', 'essence', 'character', 'want', 'Lisbeth', 'have', 'mix', 'smarts', 'hardened', 'exterior', 'quirky', 'beauty', 'ferocity', 'manic', 'energy', 'book', 'Ms.', 'Rapace', 'spades', 'maybe', 'little', 'less', 'elfin', 'character', 'described', 'Larsson', 'other', 'Lisbeth', 'head.I', 'fans', 'book', 'see', 'enjoyable', 'adaptation', '[', 'producers', 'had', 'smarts', 'make', 'three', 'movies', 'once', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'headed', 'way', ']', 'Swedish', 'story', 'be', 'seen', 'Swedish']",N/A
1343221,A4VH04TA14CPE,B003FBNJ4U,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[49, 96]","Imagine a no-talent hack who wishes to depict an evil villain. Of course, the villain has to be a psychopathic serial killer and rapist, that's the ABCs of the hack's difficult task. But how do you add that extra touch to make the villain totally ultra-evil to the max, completely beyond all civilized norms? Well, if you're whoever is responsible for this film, you make him a Nazi on top of everything else. But the Nazi ideology is only icing on the cake -- sure, the villain rapes and murders women whom he considers to be racially inferior, but he also rapes and tries to murder his own, presumably ideologically pure, sister. He is basically an agglomeration of all movie tropes and bogeymen, and wants to rape and murder just about anything that moves.But hey, he's hardly alone. If you ever thought of Sweden as a well-to-do social democracy, this film offers a different perspective. Outwardly mild-mannered court-appointed guardians of troubled young women also turn out to be sadistic, slathering maniacs who can't wait to horrifically abuse their power. To say nothing of the young women's fathers.Basically The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a lowest-common-denominator interpretation of feminist discourse. I'm not even sure I can say its heart is in the right place. The protagonist, intrepid journalist Mikael Blomkvist, is shown as being an upstanding fellow who is willing to accept the sullen young woman for who she is...and is instantly rewarded with silent, inexplicable sex, even though the young woman's traumatic experience at the hands of ruthless men had previously led her to seek solace with other women. But wait, it's girl-on-top sex, so it shows that Blomkvist is different from those others. Needless to say, his sensitive approach instantly, effortlessly pleases and satisfies the young lady, sending her to heights of erotic ecstasy, despite all her years of suffering and emotional abuse. A bold anti-establishment statement, or one male writer's wish-fulfillment fantasy? We report, you decide.Part of the point in creating outlandishly evil and sadistic, beyond-the-pale villains is so the audience doesn't have to feel bad -- in fact, is surreptitiously encouraged to feel good -- when the protagonists engage in some return sadism of their own. The evil court-appointed guardian gets off relatively easy, being merely forcibly sodomized and disfigured with tattoos, but the nutty Nazi crashes his car and dies a fiery death. The titular girl witnesses this, ignoring his pleas for help. This later elicits a remarkably perfunctory response from Blomkvist, who acknowledges that, in fact, it is indeed generally bad to let someone die helplessly in front of you (just in case anyone was wondering), but it's pretty much okay as long as this someone was a crazed supervillain. This is in line with the past decade's general trend in cinematic moral reasoning, also found in such timeless works asTaken, starring Liam Neeson. The logic goes like this: a) the protagonist suffers or has suffered a lot, and b) he or she is one of the good guys, so therefore c) the protagonist gets carte blanche to do whatever he or she wants.St. Augustine, eat your heart out.There is a bit of fancy footwork going on in this part. Even though the Nazi is such a depraved nutcase, and the story lays all the groundwork for the argument that people like him are better dead than alive, the film is still uncomfortable about putting the cards on the table, showing the protagonists doing away with the killer, and daring the audience to approve. No, the plot carefully sidesteps this potentially thorny issue. Lisbeth watches him die, so it's still kind of transgressive, but technically she doesn't actually kill him, so in a pinch you can still argue that the killer died on his own before he could be brought to justice.Later, Blomkvist uncovers new evidence implicating some tycoon of being an arms smuggler, and the tycoon commits suicide. This is presented as a straightforward vindication of Blomkvist's no-nonsense dedication to the truth. Personally, I think that arms smugglers are very bad people, but it might still be worth giving them a trial, if only to prove their guilt beyond a doubt. Otherwise, you know, there might be a few other reasons why a public figure might want to commit suicide after being publicly accused of heinous crimes.As a detective story, this one is solved by magic rather than logic. That is, the mystery is uncovered by brilliantly hacking into secret databases and finding damning photographs in obscure files, rather than through logical deduction. But that's almost an afterthought: crafting a murder mystery is possibly the film's last priority.I entertain the possibility that thebookis better than the film (I wonder how it could possibly not be), and that, in fact, the blame lies solely with crass, money-hungry movie hacks who pillaged a writer's vision. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a very bad film that relies on extremely crude devices for manipulating the audience. A couple of the views of Sweden in winter sure looked foreboding, though.",1,"Among his many crimes, the killer killed 2 1/2 hours of my time.",1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,5129,"['Imagine',

In fact, it takes Swedish sin to new hights. Sado-masochistic violence, sadistic rape, explicit sex between a middle-aged man and a twenty-something woman, and a serial killer who makes Hannibal Lector look like a joke.Yepp, that's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" alright, based on the best-selling novel by the late Stieg Larsson. In Swedish, both the novel and the film are called ""Men who hate women"". Larsson was a left-wing activist and feminist, and probably believed in various conspiracy theories as well. I never met him, but I've met people who have. (One of them used to write reviews here at Amazon years ago.)The heroine of Larsson's story, Lisbeth Salander, is a young woman with Asperger syndrome and a background of mental illness. Her story isn't fully revealed until the sequels, but we do learn that she's a survivor of sexual abuse, a computer hacker and something of a feminist vigilante. In ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", she teams up with a reporter named Mikael Blomkvist to investigate a cold murder case which turns out to have staggering implications.I don't deny that the acting is superb, and most of the actors are well known in Sweden. I'm not sure how much the dialogue looses in English translation, but believe me, it certainly works in Swedish!Still, I don't like the movie. It's too violent and bizarre, and the character of Lisbeth Salander is simply unbelievable. Of course, feminist vigilantes *are* unbelievable (there are very few of them around!), but Salander is just too much.Unfortunately, however, the dark plot isn't completely unrealistic, not after the Fritzl case in Austria and other cases of children kept in captivity. The two other Larsson movies, with their conspiracy theories, are far less believable than ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".I therefore have very mixed feelings about this one.

The Stieg Larson trilogy is extraordinarily compelling - the reason being the character Lisbeth Salander - she's a mystery that unfolds gradually, startlingly and believable in the three books. Mikael Blomkvist and the others are well written too - and the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth works and builds very well. (they don't meet until well into the story). But still it's the Lisbeth character that draws you in. I read the trilogy over 5 days and how they could make a movie of it I could not foresee. But they did! They were able to find just the right Lisbeth in Noomi Raplace. Michael was a good Mikael also.

Readers form a bond with the characters and are fascinated by the ride that they take with that character throughout the story. Once these books are adapted to the big screen that fascination factor is diluted by what Hollywood thinks the audience wants. The result is that they hire an actor who is a big star to play the lead character instead of the best actor for the character. The story is based in Sweden so what do you want to bet that the people in charge of the american version are trying to figure a way to have the story based in the U.S? I am very pleasantly surprised that, not only did the swedes make a very good adaptation, but that they are still making movies at all. It is very rare that Swedish films are brought to our attention. This one is very good. The actress that plays Lisbeth is very believeable and the story stays pretty much true to the source.

Martin,"[9, 14]","I have not read Stieg Larson's book on which this movie is based, or any of his bestselling trilogy, but I'm guessing that, as is the case with many film adaptations of books, something got lost in the process.  As a movie, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" plays like a fairly standard mystery/thriller.  The one thing that sets it apart from most films in the genre is a violent rape scene and the themes of sadism and misogyny, which I suspect fit in to the novel better than they do here.The plot focuses on Mikael Blomkvist, an idealistic reporter and Lisbeth Salander, an emotionally damaged young hacker who teams up with him to solve a 40 year old cold case.  The missing person is the niece of the head of a wealthy business family and he suspects that she was murdered by someone within the family.And so, Mikeal and Lisbeth work together to unravel the mystery, which leads them into much darker terriroty than they ever expected.  At 2 1/2 hours, the movie moves stretches on far too long and left me bored and distracted.  The main characters are not well developed (although we do know that Lisbeth has a history of mental problems likely stemming from mistreatment by the men in her life) and they lack any real chemistry.  The mystery that they solve is not well plotted out.  The protagonists manage to make connections that are not fully explained.  Again, I suspect the book does a better job of this.Then there's the rape scene.  It's brief but very disturbing.  I know that it is meant to tie into the aforementioned theme of misogyny and help the audience understand where some of Lisbeth's deeply ingrained issues stem from, but it doesn't really work in the movie since her character is not fully fleshed out.Maybe the book is better.  The buzz and excitement that surrounds the trilogy has to mean that it is more that just another run of the mill thriller.

Yes, many will give the filmmakers props for showing some of the brutal scenes they did, but that doesn't make it a good film.  I found the cinematography more compelling than the characters.

Well, author Stieg Larsson knew what he was doing when writing the book this movie is based on by doing that but this is no B movie. This is easily one of the best thrillers onscreen of all time.The story itself is mindblowing and will wipe out any lefty's preconceived notions that Sweden is or was ever a utopia of socialism (if you've ever been to a Swedish soccer match you know they have their own hooligan ""minority,"" too, even in this so-called open and liberal welfare state). The movie itself is mainly a whodunit that is somehow able through flashbacks, creative editing and a powerful soundtrack to make computer hacking and archival research look exciting.Yet there is plenty of violence (and very graphic so if you are squeamish this is your forewarning) and sex (brief in all cases but often cruel, bizarre and frigthening).The real reason you should see this movie is the lead actress, Noomi Rapace, who plays the bisexual punk (she's not Goth, movie critics!) computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. The woman is a revelation. She'll become every sane person's heroine after seeing her meting out real justice to the villains in the story.Throw in the stark Swedish landscape in winter and the juxtaposition of Stockholm with the village hinterland and its' also a hauntingly beautiful movie.

1343247,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B003FBNJ4U,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]",Niels Arden Oplev has crafted one of the finest psychological thrillers in recent memory. The film while a little long keeps its viewers interested for its entire 152 minute length. The film features good acting from its principals and an intellegent script based on the Millenium books by Stieg Larsson.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is a journalist who has just been convicted of libel and is on his way to prison when he is called to investigate the possible forty year old murder of the niece of industrialist Henrik Vanger(Sven-Bertil Taube). In the midst of this investigation he meets the illusive computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who helps him to uncover long buried family secrets. To say anymore would be to destroy the fun of watching this great import.I viewed the BluRay from Music Box which features a great widescreen transfer. The film is mostly dialogue driven and features a good Dolby soundtrack although not the Master Audio I would have expected on so new a film. The only weakness is the lack of extras on the disk. There is a short interview with Noomi Rapace and some trailers:both for this film and its sequel The Girl Who Played With Fire.All in all this was one of the major films of 2009 and it deserves a viewing.

""Funny"" often turned out to be ""cute"" and ""moving dramas"" boring and predictable. Thanks to Director Niels Arden Opley, I spent this afternoon glued to the screen. Opley does two things very, very well. He brings a riveting ""who done it"" book to life and allows the main characters to remain true to themselves rather than turning into pawn who bend and sway with the plot.Set against the narcissism of a corporate family, it is clear from the get go that everyone in this movie has been damaged in some way and yes some of that damage occurs in the form of violence against women. I don't like to see women abused, but here the revenge is sweet. I intend to watch this film again with friends and checkout some of this director's other flicks, as well as those of actress Noomi Rapace, who was riveting as Lisbeth. The film is in Swedish with subtitles, but the the dialog becomes sparse after the first 10 or 15 minutes and they don't intrude on viewing enjoyment at all. There is apparently talk of making an American version of this movie but I wouldn't trade Noomi's performance for English dialog. I would also like to see the sequel ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" but unfortunately it has yet to be released with region 1 encoding.

I reviewed the remake and originally gave it a 4, with some severe caveats.  After watching the original version today, I changed my score on the remake to a 3.  And it surely could have been worse.How is it that the team that made the remake messed up in so many ways?  This story is really good, and it surely should have been used as a template for the remake.  I understand, and sometimes appreciate, remakes in these scenarios.  In general, I prefer to watch films in English because reading the subtitles takes a lot of effort, and ""burns cycles"" while just watching the film.  But here, the story was actually so much more understandable for me, which is absolutely crazy, because I don't speak the language.The remake seemed to drag and drag, and I actually started thinking, ""OK; when will this end?""  Not here.  This is one of those films where you're kind of sad to see it end, as you have such a great time just taking the ride.  And the remake was so dark, as I complained in the other review, while this one has plenty of light.  The director of the remake wanted to overly-stylize things, which was a mistake, while the director of this film just seemed to say, ""We have a good story.  Let's just tell it.""  In the remake, I complained slightly about the torture scenes.  Here, they were necessary to drive the plot and the theme, so kudos.  I felt less sympathy here for the victims of torture who deserved that torture; it wasn't mean spirited, and so it worked here while it failed there.Actually, watching this very fine film was a disappointment, as I am now so disappointed in the remake.  I could almost go five here, but I'll round down.  This is a strong four, and a very strong recommendation.  For the creators of the remake?

A gothic female researcher is running background checks by hacking into a magazine reporter's computer. It seems he has been framed for reporting on a crooked tycoon. Meanwhile he is investigating the forty year old dispearance case of a young girl by the request of a wealthy businessman. The man belongs to an unusual foundation that has several suspicious founders. The reporter has a limited window to investigate while waiting to do his six month sentence for slander. When he uncovers some interesting clues to the case, the researcher decides to help him figure out the meaning of some odd initials and numbers the missing girl left. The tension starts to build as they join forces and find several twists and turns to what happened, and their lives are threatened when they get to close to the truth. Excellent mystery that although not fast paced as some, the story, directing, acting, and camera work make it well worth the patience. This is very much an adult movie with some graphic scenes that may be hard to view by some. They are in fact very well done and in fact clarify the abuse of women rather than detract from the movie.

Blomkvist receives anonymous tips on the case by a beautiful young computer hacker with a shrouded past that has been hired to track him. Together, they will uncover a series of murders spanning over four decades as they unravel the family's dark secrets. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the first feature film to be made based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, the top-selling novels out of Sweden. Niels Arden Oplev's thrilling adaptation combines the shock and suspense of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS with the mystery and intrigue found in THE WICKER MAN. Noomi Rapace plays the street smart Lisbeth Salander, who is repeatedly brutalized by each of the men in her life. Despite Rapace's cold demeanor, she puts forth an electrifying performance as the strong and resourceful researcher with a vendetta against abusive men. She is joined by Michael Nyqvist, whose subtle but calculated maneuvers make him perfect for the role of Mikael Blomkvist. GIRL offers devastating displays of rape and violence that are never sanitized for public consumption. Larsson's contempt for these deplorable acts manifests through Lisbeth's character, who strikes back at her aggressors with a fiery vengeance. The novel is beautifully adapted for the screen, although Oplev is sure to ground the events in reality with his restrained shooting style. Only the ending feels rushed, where many of the unanswered questions are resolved in rapid succession.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor, or The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, as it is known in the U.S., is based on the first of Stieg Larssons three bestselling novels. M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor translates to ""men who hate women."" Larssons had intended a 10 novel series, but the three published novels form a sort of trilogy by themselves. He calls it The Millenium Trilogy. The novels were published posthumously, and he had some notes and other unfinished books, but these three books would seem to be his legacy. The film is in Swedish with English subtitles. I enjoy foreign films and don't mind reading the subtitles. I like hearing the films in their original tongue. Swedish has a mysterious sound, vaguely Germanic--nothing at all like the Swedish cook on The Muppets.I saw this film at the Majestic Fox Theater in Bakersfield, a vintage movie palace restored to its former glory, as the kick off to FLICS, the foreign film club that allows the good folks of Bakersfield the opportunity to see foreign films that they might not otherwise be able to. The huge theater was packed, and I had no idea what a buzz this film had going for it, fueled no doubt by the bestselling books by Stieg Larssons.Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, starring Michael Nyqvist as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, the dragon tattooed girl who is paid to hack into Blomkvist's personal files, but then becomes his ally. It is at once an action packed mystery, a study of abuse victims, a story of female empowerment, and an unlikely romance. Though the film has graphic scenes of sex and violence, you never get the feeling that it is gratuitous, just that it is necessary to tell the story of Lisbeth, and how she came to be the way she is. How she refused to be a victim, and fought back against those who would try to oppress her. In some ways, she is like a punk rock female Charles Bronson in his vigilante/revenge mode. She looks like Lady Gaga, but with piercings, and instead of outrageous dresses made out of meat, she wears the black pants and leather jacket of a biker. She is an abuse victim, but when she fights back, you are with her all the way.In some ways the movie is an unlikely romance, or a wish fulfillment fantasy of older men who'd like to be swept off their feet by some hot young hacker on a motor bike. However, it is handled so delicately, and the character of Blomkvist is so pure of heart--he only wants to get at the truth and expose evil and corruption--so you never feel like he is just some D.O.M. (dirty old man). You don't feel like a voyeur watching the movie, either. Though there are some graphic scenes, they don't dwell on anything more than it would take to tell the story. The audience I saw it with covered a wide range of ages, from young adult to seniors, and everyone seemed to enjoy it immensely. They liked having their cake and eating it, too.As good as Nyquist is at conveying the purity of Blomqvist, the character who you'll be thinking about the most in the days to come is Lisbeth Salander, as excellently portrayed by Noomi Rapace. She already had the holes from piercings in her younger punk rocker days, so they had only to paint on the tattoos to transform her into Lisbeth. Throughout many harrowing scenes, she never broke character. Though she tended to have almost a poker face, you really got the feeling that she was a real person going through all these ordeals, and of course, parts of her thoughts were a mystery, but other feelings could be easily read as if they were written in flaming letters 12 feet high.She inhabits her role so thoroughly that there is talk of a boycott unless they use Noomi to play Lisbeth in the English language version scheduled to begin shooting in 2011 with director David Fincher (Fight Club). I don't know that an English language version is necessary, but if anyone is going to do it, it might as well be David Fincher. I hope they do use Noomi, though The Bottom Line is I would find it hard to boycott, regardless of who played Lisbeth.The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)by Stieg LarssonsThe Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nestby Stieg LarssonsThe Girl with the Dragon Tattooby Stieg LarssonsThe Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest DVD (Luftslottet som sprangdes) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD] (Swedish)(2009)The Girl Who Played With Fire(2009)Worlds Apart(2008) Directed by Niels Arden OplevWe Shall Overcome(2006) Directed by Niels Arden OplevAs It Is in Heaven(2004) Michael Nyqvist was Daniel Dar&eacute;usDownloading Nancy(2008) Michael Nyqvist was StanDaisy Diamond  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import -

1343259,AYWSFRCIMOAYE,B003FBNJ4U,Cestmoi,"[0, 0]","WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!Firstly, I've not read the novel this movie is based on. So my comments are for this film only.Secondly, the most interesting about this picture is Noomi Rapace's engaging acting. She vividly played Lisbeth Salander who was a chain smoker, drinker and skillful computer hacker. What an attitude she had. She did not get mad, she always got even. There was more to her character but I would not reveal them here.Thirdly, the plot was complicated. It dealt with many problems such as police's power abuse, domestic violence, serial killing. These problems were depicted in many extremely disturbing scenes. They made me very angry seeing how much emotionally Lisbeth was suffering.  The plot also involves deep relationship between the  niece and her uncle. The uncle's love for his niece was strongly expressed from the beginning till the end. The last scene touched my heart.Fourthly, the most ridiculous aspect is this movie has at least 4 big logical holes that greatly erode my interest. If it had been a fantasy movie, I'd would have ignored its logic deficiency. However, it's a kind of detective and drama movie. So, logic is one of its foundations! I won't list all of the holes I found but one here. For example, after a member of Vanger family saved Mikael from being killed by the owner of the house he just broke in, he told his savior everything about his investigation. Consequently, he paid dearly later! Before that, the film had always shown most of the Vanger members including his savior just wanted him to go home. Why on earth, suddenly Mikael turned into a man with the brain of a junior high school student? Why many detective/investigative movies have the same problem? Because of this I gave this movie 3 stars.In short, it's worth watching once especially if you want something different from Hollywood stuff.",3,Noomi Rapace's riveting acting + Complicated plot dealing with many problems in life + 4 big logical holes = Worth watching once,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,1857,"['WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'Firstly', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'comments', 'are', 'film', 'only.Secondly', 'most', 'interesting', 'picture', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'engaging', 'acting', 'vividly', 'played', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'who', 'was', 'chain', 'smoker', 'drinker', 'skillful', 'computer', 'hacker', 'What', 'attitude', 'had', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'mad', 'always', 'got', 'even', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'reveal', 'here.Thirdly', 'plot', 'was', 'complicated', 'dealt', 'many', 'problems', 'such', 'police', 'power', 'abuse', 'domestic', 'violence', 'serial', 'killing', 'problems', 'were', 'depicted', 'many', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'made', 'very', 'angry', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'emotionally', 'Lisbeth', 'was', 'suffering', 'plot', 'also', 'deep', 'relationship', 'niece', 'uncle', 'uncle', 'love', 'niece', 'was', 'strongly', 'expressed', 'beginning', 'end', 'last', 'scene', 'touched', 'heart.Fourthly', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'aspect', 'movie', 'least', '4', 'big', 'logical', 'holes', 'greatly', 'erode', 'interest', 'had', 'been', 'fantasy', 'movie', ""'d"", 'would', 'have', 'ignored', 'logic', 'deficiency', 'However', 'kind', 'detective', 'drama', 'movie', 'So', 'logic', 'one', 'foundations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'holes', 'found', 'one', 'here', 'example', 'member', 'Vanger', 'family', 'saved', 'Mikael', 'being', 'killed', 'owner', 'house', 'just', 'broke', 'told', 'savior', 'everything', 'investigation', 'Consequently', 'paid', 'dearly', 'later', 'film', 'had', 'always', 'shown', 'most', 'Vanger', 'members', 'including', 'savior', 'just', 'wanted', 'go', 'home', 'Why', 'earth', 'suddenly', 'Mikael', 'turned', 'man', 'brain', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Why', 'many', 'detective/investigative', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars.In', 'short', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'especially', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'Hollywood', 'stuff']",N/A

The actors are unknown to Americans and that to me is a plus. Unknowns tend to hold an authenticity with acting that major filmstars lose over time. The abuse and consiracy to silence ""Lisbeth"" is real on her expressions and in her fight to survive. The cast is perfect in displaying cruelty and evil, but Lisbeth is tough and smart.

I was going to wait until the American version came out later this year, but my curiosity got the better of me. So I rented the Swedish version.While I can't say the movie was better than the novel, I can say they come pretty close. My one huge complaint about the novel was the huge amount of backstory and mumbo jumbo that I just didn't care about. The movie didn't have that- it jumped right into the story full throttle, caught my attention, and held it to the very end.My one worry was that the movie would be confusing and hard to follow. It turns out that whoever adapted this movie from the book did an excellent job of knowing what to keep and what to discard, and the movie was easy to follow, even for someone who might not have read the book(s). My only complaint about the movie is that Erika Berger didn't play a big enough role. I know there's a lot to put in a short movie, but I feel like she's important enough to get more time on screen.The actress who played Lisbeth was incredible; she was exactly what I pictured her to be. The actor who played Mikael was wonderful as well.Overall: If you're a fan of TGWTDT, don't miss out on the Swedish version.

1343265,ABYOODNVKY9LX,B003FBNJ4U,Chris Mathews,"[0, 1]","My review is rather sparse to avoid spoilers...The book is pretty darn good, despite the lack of editing and the difficulties of Swedish to English translation.The movie, on the other hand, is average at best.  I read the book today, and then watched the movie, so I'm think I'm pretty up to date on the adaptation.  I fully understand that getting a 465 page book condensed into a 2 1/2 hour movie isn't easy, but then again, I think it is possible to preserve the themes and primary character motivations.  _Lord of the Rings_ and _Gone with the Wind_ are great examples.  Sadly, the adapters of _Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_ were more than willing to toss characters and motivations out the window in the expedience of time.  Instead, the movie appears to focus on the wonders (and dangers?) of technology rather than corruption, responsibility, and government power (and the abuse thereof).One of the primary themes of the book is corruption, which sadly, barely makes it into the movie.  Completely gone are the motivations of the protagonist for revenge for his jail sentence.  We lose the pivotal scene where he is forced to lose his ideals to Henrik, which is arguably the entire point of the book.  And of course, we lose the ending scene with Lisbeth becoming disenchanted (I said this was a non-spoiler review!) with Mikael.We completely lose his romantic involvement with his partner, Erika.  Interesting to note that the wikipedia entry for this book excludes her as well; I suspect the primary wikipedia editor is only familiar with the film ""treatment"" of the novel.Also missing is the overall treatment of women; the novel makes a very strong point that sexual abuse of women is almost commonplace in Sweden.

Given the author's history of witnessing rape, it is reasonable to assume that he meant it to be significant.Probably also missing in the reviews we see on Amazon is the Swedish perspective:1. political influence of Stockholm vs. the outlying rural areas (so much for democratic ideals)2. government's role as protector of the common people vs. the reality3. role of the industrial magnates vs. the people (see #1)4. reduced coverage in the movie (difficult to fault this as everything else suffered the same fate ): Swedish Nazi historyOverall, I found the movie to be trivial, compared to the book.

To be fair to Larrson while I loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo the exposition and the plot were a little clunky relying on deepening the mystery through an incredible ammount of coincendence and the book only came alive after Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander finally joined forces. In a way the filmmakers took a typical first novel and improved at least in my opinion.The movie to me is just a well made piece of entertainment with everything just falling into place to make an excellent mystery thriller. Starting with the casting Michael Nyqvist is the right fit for Blomkvist being middle aged, intelligent and reasonably awkward for the situation even when confronting Salander. I didn't want to compare him to the casting of Daniel Craig for the American redux (not going to judge yet) but Craig is now invariably linked to the image of a tough guy while poor Blomkvist kind of stumbles into things accidentally using his brain to try to find a way out of. Its hard to see him winning of the trust of Salander so easily and Nyqvist embodies this.However of course for any fan of the book its the actress who plays Salander herself and of course Nooma Rapace is excellent in physical stature and attitude for the character. Something that impressed me more strangely enough was her voice which could waver between the feminene going to something animalistic especially in the scenes involving her new gaurdian Nils Bjurman.And to end the director does an excellent time in visualizing the novel. Its nothing amazing as most of the mystery involves enhancing photographs and looking at computer screens but I like Roger Ebert's comparisons to Blow-Out or Blow Up as something to liken it to. The action itself is well done including one of the most uncomfortable rape scenes I've seen put to film, and a good conclusion to the mystery resolved between two people talking (sure its the falacy of the talking killer but well acted between the actors). It will be interesting to compare the films vision as the redux is coming from David Fincher. In the mean time Niels Arden Oplev did an excellent job with this adaptation.I could go on and on but this simply put an excellent thriller, well worth seeing before David Fincher helms his adaptation.The Blu-Ray of course has excellent picture and sound though this isn't one to really show off the format. Disappointingly there aren't a lot of features either outside of a Vanger family tree line, an interview with Rapace and a preview of The Girl Who Played with Fire.

A great show I'm fairly certain they won't be able to duplicate in its two sequels. It doesn't matter though as the movie stands alone just fine.It's a what do you want movie unless you want belly laughs. Want super rich people & power mad corporations, corrupt businesses, evil low level gov't employees, sex, deviance, emotional disturbance, terror, torture, child & power abuse, shocking images of horrible & foul crime, deep heart rending love, tender moving moments of remembrance, guilt & forgiveness, unlooked for victory filled with terrible circumstances and short comings, a sense of justice for 3 but abject failure for many others?The movie centers around the disappearance of a 16 year old girl in 1966, a girl that was born to unlimited wealth & privilege. 40 years later the 82 yr. old uncle that adored her hires a disgraced reporter to find the truth before he passes away. The entrance & exit of the girl with the dragon tattoo into this movie I leave out on purpose. She is the center & eye of the effort to make sense of the madness & 40 years of collected data. This is not for people that like sweetness & light or those that want a neat & smile filled ending.If life on the edge of mental endurance is your cup of tea then drink here. Powerful, suspenseful, & captivating, it kept my wife up 2 1/2 hours past her bed time with ease.It is part of a trilogy & is followed by THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE & then THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST but I haven't located them yet. Dragon Tattoo was from Stig Larsson's book Men Who Hate Women.The cast is great throughout on both ends of the story but special note of Noomi Rapace is warranted. You'll know why after watching it. :)***** ***** *****I watched The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo again. A great foreign movie with a tremendous who done it / what happened storyline. I admit there are some holes in the story.I think this movie stands very well all on its own even though it's the first of a trilogy. Parts 2 & 3 do flesh out the story of Lisbeth Salander's unusual & chaotic life. The fact no attempt is made to justify things that occur in this story is very enjoyable to me. You get to take a show of occurrences & place blame or justification as you see fit. It's a sure thing that many will be less than enthusiastic about the subject matter or the people portrayed in this movie. It hits hard, fast & apologizes for nothing. I thought I'd like it a bit less than my first viewing but in fact liked it even better. There may be some weak details in this show but the things that are right are so perfectly right I find myself drawn into the story & the life called Lisbeth.A great job of casting & acting make the show absorbing to watch. The musical score is probably the most perfect thing about it & that is saying a lot considering that Noomi Rapace has defined the role of Lisbeth Salander as well as any actress has defined a role before her.

I am glad to do so because I loved this movie.I originally saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 2010 and I believe that was the film's North American debut. It was the best film at the festival and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I had not heard of the movie and barely was aware of the book until I saw this film.Now, if you are one of those that do not like to ""read"" your movies (this is in Swedish with English subtitles) or you can not sit through about 2 1/2 hours of a mystery, this film may not be for you.  That would be a shame because it is an extraordinary movie and an amazing unraveling story much like peeling back an onion.I have now read the book, and the movie has retained mostly everything (and I mean everything) that was pertinent to the story. Having seen the movie first, it made reading the book a breeze. Even though I had an idea how the story ended, it was fun reading the book because it is a little more detailed and slightly more involved.There is supposed to be an American version in the works which will most likely ""santitize"" much of the story and shorten it down to the acceptable ""105 minute"" movie for the American audience.  That will be inevitable, but a shame. Much will be ""lost in the translation"" and transformation!This is the first of a trilogy by this author who died shortly after submitting the manuscripts for the 3 books and so we will not have any more from him, but we can enjoy another installment which has already been made in Sweden, but not yet available on DVD for Region 1 (USA and Canada) audiences.  As I write this review, I am in the middle of the second book and look forward to the movie either coming to the US in the theaters or on Region 1 DVD.I highly recommend seeing this movie.

1343282,A1JYFCI5TR09O8,B003FBNJ4U,"CR Hawk ""Mr Vic""","[1, 1]","Noomi Rapace's character, Lisbeth Salander, defines Femme Fatale in an entirely unique, bad ass way.  When she first appears on screen, you get the feeling she probably did her facial piercings herself just for fun.  In the beginning, you may wonder why she acts tough enough to spit nails; but when you find out about her background (a little in this movie, more in the sequels), you understand why she acts the way she does.Ms Rapace really worked hard to get into character (you'll enjoy her interview on the DVD).  For most male viewers, and I'm sure some female viewers, Rapace's Swedish version of the Nikita-like Salander not only douses viewers with toughness, but literally oozes a tough sexuality that will leave you perspiring with a subtle arousal you'll want to hide from your significant other, at least until you get home and turn the lights out.The calmer male lead character, Mikael Blomkvist, admirably brought to life by  Michael Nyqvist, provides a well needed balance by keeping Lisbeth grounded while they work both separately and together to solve the 40-year old mystery that lies at the heart of the plot's body.  However, you'll still root on Salander's savage dispositon as she exacts vengeance as part of one of the movies main subplots.  You'll definitely remember how she gets her barbaric revenge for a long time to come.If you're one who doesn't like to read subtitles throughout the movie, you can choose the DVD's dubbed English version, but I highly suggest you go through the movie with the Swedish soundtrack at least once so you can get a better emotional feel for the characters via their voices, tone and inflection.  The dubbed version will then give you a chance to perhaps catch some of the subtle body language and facial expressions you might miss by reading throughout.I won't go over the plot--you can read critical and customer reviews to get the keys themes to the storyline.  But I will say it's a clever whodunit, slow at times, but interesting nevertheless.  And, after watching this, you'll surely want to see the other 2 parts to the trilogy.  Of course Hollywood is jumping on the bandwagon--they know a good thing when they see it--and releasing a trio of English language remakes.  Due to the distribution limitations of foreign films, I'm sure the LA versions of the Swedish bad asses' trio will garner a wider audience and, thus, make more money at the box office; however, I highly doubt whether they can imitate the high quality of the originals.Bottom line: make sure you get Swedish versions of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and 2 sequels on DVD if you miss(ed) them in theaters and get the popcorn ready--you're in for a hard edged treat.And, oh yah, Noomi, will you marry me?!:-)",5,"I Can't Wait to See ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" Play With Fire & Kick the Hornet's Nest!",1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,2748,"['Noomi', 'Rapace', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'entirely', 'unique', 'bad', 'ass', 'way', 'When', 'first', 'screen', 'get', 'feeling', 'probably', 'did', 'facial', 'piercings', 'just', 'fun', 'beginning', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'tough', 'enough', 'spit', 'nails', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'background', 'little', 'movie', 'more', 'sequels', 'understand', 'why', 'way', 'does.Ms', 'Rapace', 'really', 'worked', 'hard', 'get', 'character', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'interview', 'DVD', 'most', 'male', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'female', 'viewers', 'Rapace', 'Swedish', 'version', 'Nikita-like', 'Salander', 'not', 'only', 'viewers', 'toughness', 'literally', 'tough', 'sexuality', 'will', 'leave', 'perspiring', 'subtle', 'arousal', ""'ll"", 'want', 'hide', 'significant', 'other', 'least', 'get', 'home', 'turn', 'lights', 'out.The', 'calmer', 'male', 'lead', 'character', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'admirably', 'brought', 'life', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'well', 'needed', 'balance', 'keeping', 'Lisbeth', 'grounded', 'work', 'separately', 'together', 'solve', '40-year', 'old', 'mystery', 'heart', 'plot', 'body', 'However', ""'ll"", 'still', 'root', 'Salander', 'savage', 'dispositon', 'vengeance', 'part', 'one', 'movies', 'main', 'subplots', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'remember', 'how', 'barbaric', 'revenge', 'long', 'time', 'come.If', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'read', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'can', 'choose', 'DVD', 'dubbed', 'English', 'version', 'highly', 'suggest', 'go', 'movie', 'Swedish', 'soundtrack', 'least', 'once', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'emotional', 'feel', 'characters', 'voices', 'tone', 'inflection', 'dubbed', 'version', 'will', 'then', 'give', 'chance', 'perhaps', 'catch', 'subtle', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'might', 'miss', 'reading', 'throughout.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'can', 'read', 'critical', 'customer', 'reviews', 'get', 'keys', 'themes', 'storyline', 'will', 'say', 'clever', 'whodunit', 'slow', 'times', 'interesting', 'nevertheless', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'want', 'see', 'other', '2', 'parts', 'trilogy', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'jumping', 'bandwagon', 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'see', 'releasing', 'trio', 'English', 'language', 'remakes', 'Due', 'distribution', 'limitations', 'foreign', 'films', ""'m"", 'sure', 'LA', 'versions', 'Swedish', 'bad', 'asses', 'trio', 'will', 'garner', 'wider', 'audience', 'thus', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'however', 'highly', 'doubt', 'can', 'imitate', 'high', 'quality', 'originals.Bottom', 'line', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'Swedish', 'versions', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '2', 'sequels', 'DVD', 'miss', 'ed', 'theaters', 'get', 'popcorn', 'ready', ""'re"", 'hard', 'edged', 'treat.And', 'oh', 'yah', 'Noomi', 'will', 'marry']",N/A

1343284,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B003FBNJ4U,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","Translated as &#8220;Men Who Hate Women&#8221; and known as the English title &#8220;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,&#8221;  M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor is a dark and atmospheric Swedish thriller based on the novel by Stieg Larsson about a journalist and his unlikely encounter with a young female hacker. Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is the journalist who is found guilty of a crime that he did not commit. He&#8217;s soon sought by a wealthy elderly man for his expertise in investigating in hopes to find answers to an old missing person case.A young rebellious hacker named Lisbeth (Noomi Rapace) is a delinquent who works for the security company hired to get information about Mikael. Becoming intrigued, perhaps obsessed to an extent, with Mikael, Lisbeth continues to track him until they eventually meet. The two team up to solve the case only to find themselves caught in a family&#8217;s long line of dark and dirty secrets.The standout character in this film is Lisbeth, who has built quite a hard shell as a result of constantly being abused throughout her life. Noomi Rapace plays this character extraordinarily well, to the point that we feel her pain and experiences. The character of Lisbeth is by far the most fascinating character, be it in a book or movie, that I can recall in quite some time. Her mysterious nature is intriguing, while her tech-savviness is both exciting and relevant in today&#8217;s world. Nyqvist is equally impressive as the zealous investigator. The rest of the cast does outstandingly well also, bringing eerie realism to this drama. The heartlessness of the villains portrayed in the film is sure to leave one with an ill feeling.The picture itself has great direction from Oplev. He really captures a certain feeling of the cold and bleak locale which so hauntingly ads to the film&#8217;s mysteriousness. The film can be graphic and unsettling at times during scenes involving violence and sexual assault (which are far from exploitive) but necessarily so to illustrate the pain and suffering endured by our characters. The dark mood is offset by the developing bond between our main characters and their own personal growth. It&#8217;s longer runtime goes unnoticed by including plenty of clues combined with nicely executed action that only makes one want more.The film is a captivating crime thriller that is brilliantly played out and is sure to have viewers feeling all sorts of emotions throughout. I&#8217;ve not yet read this or any of the other books from Larsson&#8217;s Millenium trilogy, however this film has greatly prompted my interest. The film sheds light on the all too real world of men who hate women, if only there were more people like Mikael and Lisbeth to bring them to justice. On a side note, as I&#8217;ve mentioned in my rant regarding English-language remakes, this film is in talks to be given an American remake in the near future. While if done right the remake could be good, it&#8217;s highly advisable to check out this beautiful Swedish masterpiece in its original form.source: criticnic.com 8 September 2009",5,One of my favorites,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,3098,"['Translated', '8220', 'Men', 'Who', 'Hate', 'Women', '8221', 'known', 'English', 'title', '8220', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '8221', 'M', 'auml', 'som', 'hatar', 'kvinnor', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'Swedish', 'thriller', 'based', 'novel', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'journalist', 'unlikely', 'encounter', 'young', 'female', 'hacker', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'journalist', 'who', 'found', 'guilty', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', '8217', 'soon', 'sought', 'wealthy', 'elderly', 'man', 'expertise', 'investigating', 'hopes', 'find', 'answers', 'old', 'missing', 'person', 'case.A', 'young', 'rebellious', 'hacker', 'named', 'Lisbeth', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'delinquent', 'who', 'security', 'company', 'hired', 'get', 'information', 'Mikael', 'Becoming', 'intrigued', 'perhaps', 'obsessed', 'extent', 'Mikael', 'Lisbeth', 'track', 'eventually', 'meet', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'solve', 'case', 'only', 'find', 'caught', 'family', '8217', 'long', 'line', 'dark', 'dirty', 'secrets.The', 'standout', 'character', 'film', 'Lisbeth', 'who', 'built', 'quite', 'hard', 'shell', 'result', 'constantly', 'being', 'abused', 'life', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'character', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'point', 'feel', 'pain', 'experiences', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'far', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'be', 'book', 'movie', 'can', 'recall', 'quite', 'time', 'mysterious', 'nature', 'intriguing', 'tech-savviness', 'exciting', 'relevant', 'today', '8217', 's', 'world', 'Nyqvist', 'equally', 'impressive', 'zealous', 'investigator', 'rest', 'cast', 'outstandingly', 'well', 'also', 'bringing', 'eerie', 'realism', 'drama', 'heartlessness', 'villains', 'portrayed', 'film', 'sure', 'leave', 'one', 'ill', 'feeling.The', 'picture', 'great', 'direction', 'Oplev', 'really', 'certain', 'feeling', 'cold', 'bleak', 'locale', 'so', 'hauntingly', 'ads', 'film', '8217', 's', 'mysteriousness', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'graphic', 'unsettling', 'times', 'scenes', 'involving', 'violence', 'sexual', 'assault', 'are', 'far', 'exploitive', 'necessarily', 'so', 'illustrate', 'pain', 'suffering', 'endured', 'characters', 'dark', 'mood', 'offset', 'developing', 'bond', 'main', 'characters', 'own', 'personal', 'growth', '8217', 'longer', 'runtime', 'unnoticed', 'including', 'plenty', 'clues', 'combined', 'nicely', 'executed', 'action', 'only', 'one', 'want', 'more.The', 'film', 'captivating', 'crime', 'thriller', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'out', 'sure', 'have', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'sorts', 'emotions', '8217', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'other', 'books', 'Larsson', '8217', 'Millenium', 'trilogy', 'however', 'film', 'greatly', 'prompted', 'interest', 'film', 'sheds', 'light', 'too', 'real', 'world', 'men', 'who', 'hate', 'women', 'only', 'were', 'more', 'people', 'Mikael', 'Lisbeth', 'bring', 'justice', 'side', 'note', '8217', 've', 'mentioned', 'rant', 'regarding', 'English-language', 'remakes', 'film', 'talks', 'be', 'given', 'American', 'remake', 'near', 'future', 'done', 'right', 'remake', 'could', 'be', 'good', '8217', 'highly', 'advisable', 'check', 'out', 'beautiful', 'Swedish', 'masterpiece', 'original', 'form.source', 'criticnic.com', '8', 'September', '2009']",N/A

She went missing about forty years before the novel/film begins, when she was sixteen. Vanger is a super wealthy tycoon, so he can afford to hire the controversial investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, to look into the case. Vanger cared dearly for his grand niece and is still determined to discover her fate.Absolutely nailing the part of Lisbeth Salander is Noomi Rapace. Salander is one of my favorite fictional characters. She has suffered vicious abuse, but still retains a sense of fairness. She is very tough, extremely intelligent, and has a photographic memory.

It's a huge trial to render 500 or so pages into a two-hour movie -- as it could easily have become a ten-hour movie -- and I thought the screenwriter and director did well.  They cut a lot, but that was inevitable, and they left the essence.  They changed a few of the book's plot details, without causing much harm, to make the movie flow more reasonably.  The key was that they captured the nuggets of the characters' personalities.  I think they did an exceptionally good job with Salander.

My wife, who has read the novels, filled in my gaps.  The film grabs and holds your attention from the beginning as the mystery of the forty-year disappearance of Harriet Vanger seems to deepen rather than become resolved.I especially liked the editing where the stories of Mikael Blomkyist and Lisbeth Salander are told, side-by-side, before they become devoted to solving the mystery.  There were parts of the story of Lisbeth - her relationship to her father and mother - that were inexplicable. We see Lisbeth as young girl setting a man on fire in his car without knowing why she is doing this or to whom.  We also don't know why her mother is in a nursing home.  This actually is a critical part of the story for Lisbeth's character and perhaps a few minutes could have been spent relating her troubled past.  For me, this was a small matter compared to the overall excellence of the film.The performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is something to behold. I can't recall a recent performance that was so mesmerizing. Michael Nygvist is excellent as Blomkyist and he plays well off the darker character of Lisbeth.  Together, Lisbeth and Blomkist make an interesting investigative team as they unravel the depraved Nazi past of members of the Vanger family.  The film is very graphic in the scenes of Lisbeth's rape and her revenge on her ""guardian"" and in the murders that Lisbeth and Blomkyist uncover on their way to the truth.  Viewers who are sensitive to violence may want to opt out of viewing the film.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is well acted and filmed.

Once this superb thriller sinks it's claws into you those concerns go out with the bathwater.  This film works on two levels.

As layers of Salander's past are revealed her mystique multiplies.  I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy but after seeing Rapace's account of Salander I'm salivating at the mouth.

I did and could not be happier I did, thanks Amazon reviewers.Having initially been annoyed by the subtitles I persevered and before long wasn't even conscious of reading the subtitles, the movie was such a fluid experience, everything was perfect.

1343298,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003FBNJ4U,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his ""Millennium"" trilogy especially with the novel ""M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)"" aka ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and now a US version based on the novel has been greenlighted and currently, casting for the film is now being done in the US.VIDEO:""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" looks very good on DVD.  The cinematography by Jens Fischer and Eric Kress is well-done.  The various shots throughout Sweden during the various scenes of daylight, night, snow and heavy rain was well-captured.  I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the director and cinematographers really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is presented in Swedish Dolby Digital 5.1 and an English 5.1 Dolby Digital dub.  I watched the film in its original Swedish presentation with English subtitles and the audio is very well-done.  Great use of crowd and hardware ambiance, music and various action scenes that utilize the surround channels.  Audio is clear and understandable and I actually would have love to hear the lossless soundtrack for this film on Blu-ray.  But people who are curious about the Swedish track should know that it is clear.As for the English dub, I prefer not too watch dubs but my wife does and I watched a little bit with the English dialogue and its well done.  The good news is that the dub track is not by American's trying to be Swedish which is good news and that the dub actors due have a slight accent.But for both audio tracks, we vouch for the audio tracks that we listened to.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" comes with the following special features:* Interview with Noomi Rapace - (12:30) An English interview with actress Noomi Rapace (who plays Lisabeth) who talks about playing the role of Lisbeth and enjoying the original novel and what preparation was done to transform to the character of Liabeth and the pressures she felt in playing this major role.* Theatrical Trailer - (1:43) The English dubbed theatrical trailer for ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".* The Vanger Family Tree - A graphic showing the Vanger Family Tree.* TGWPWF Preview - (1:25) An English preview of the second film in the ""Millennium"" trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"".* Previews - Music Box Film TrailersJUDGMENT FILM:My first foray into ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in my reading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.And as I watched ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!So far, a lot of the reviews haven been quite positive for this film.  Those who have read the novel have had positive feelings while some have a hard time with the casting choices.Duane Dudek of the Journal Sentinel writes, ""The lead character, a crusading journalist, looks older and seems duller, and the title character, an anti-social computer hacker wearing a spiked dog collar and black lipstick, seems as if she belongs in a vampire movie. And the story that was so compelling on the page, about the disappearance of a teenage girl 40 years earlier, feels simplified and literal.""Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionare and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  I just don't see this part going to a younger talent.  Considering the US version has hired 007 actor Daniel Craig to play Blomkvist, the more seasoned writer than is very astute, observational and wise made Michael Nyqvist perfect for the role.  And Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth was a wonderful casting choice.  To see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.  I literally can't picture anyone but someone from the underground and also different from the norm in playing the role.Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much detail was left out but for the most part, this is one of the few instances where I felt the longer duration has helped the film (where so many filmmakers abuse the longer duration for a film and sometimes lose sight of what made their film so entertaining with banal scenes).  Personally, I didn't feel the story was simplified but having read a variety of those who felt it was a solid adaptation and others who felt that the book was better, it's all subjective.If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but the interview with Noomi Rapace was quite interesting to watch and see how she dealt with playing the character and seeing how the public had felt about her performance.  Also, it was cool to see the trailer for the second film which I really look forward too. But I wish there was an audio commentary track, featurette and more interviews.Personally, as much as I enjoyed the DVD version, I now want the Blu-ray version.  The cinematography was just great as was the audio that I want to watch this movie in HD and also hear it in lossless audio.  If you are debating between both Blu-ray and DVD, I'll tell you right now, go with the Blu-ray version because a movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  These two were absolutely wonderful.  I know there is a US version coming out soon but personally, the Swedish film was done exceptionally well and both the Blu-ray and the DVD comes with the Swedish and dubbed English soundtrack.  But I just hope that the US version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" doesn't become another film that joins the list of horrible US remakes.Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2010.  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is highly recommended!",4,"DVD: Magnificent film, awesome performance, cinematography.

1343300,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B003FBNJ4U,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[31, 35]","Released just in time to happily mesh with the American publishing advent of the last book in the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson, this film adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" should provide admirers of Lisbeth Salander (hacker extraordinaire and victim of a renegade faction of the Swedish social system) with more than enough fan-tastic material to orbit them into ""Girl"" heaven.Director Niels Arden Oplev depicts a Sweden icy in its efficiency; its cleanliness apparent in its scenes of smooth running undergrounds, bridges and autobahns.  Beneath the crisp perfection of the surroundings, a misogynist undercurrent flares with the overt intensity of a laser as illustrated by the instantaneous hatred displayed by a pack of leather-clad youths subjugating a young woman to physical abuse in the subway, a guardian of mature years attacking his ward and a teenager subjected to repeated rape and beatings.  Director of photography, Eric Kress, intentionally showcases gritty up close and personal full screen faces of the film's protagonists where large pores, warts and all contribute to the feeling of an underlying lack of social airbrushing in spite of all the repressed punctiliousness of both the Scandinavian urban and rural scenes.The film's leads, most notably Noomi Rapace as the unconventional Salander and Michael Nyqvist as crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist, more than adequately do justice to their fictitious counterparts.  Rapace's waiflike appearance, economy of motion and smoldering glares bring the understandably sullen Lisbeth to toxic life.  Nyqvist's vaguely Charleton Heston sensuality and amused sophistication fleshes out the likeable and idealistic Blomkvist but writers Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel omit the character's casual sexual relationships with Millenium editor-in-chief Erika Berger, Cecelia Vanger and former babysitter Harriet.  Grant it, the film, running over two and a half hours, has little time to waste on gratuitous sexual footage and exploring instead Blomkvist's woes as a convicted journalist and Salander's smoldering rage regarding her tempestuous and unforgivable childhood in a more than adequate adaptation of the novel's main plotline: the collaboration of the two to investigate and resolve a forty-year old murder on an isolated island populated by a wealthy industrial family.  Kress again does a more than admirable job of interjecting B&W; stills into key moments of revelation during the investigation.  In particular is the forty year old photo of the missing/murdered Harriet, enigmatically staring out from her photo frame like an avenging Mona Lisa.With never a slow moment, the film whets the appetite for more Salander victory moments--the over fifty art house audience with which I viewed this film was more than familiar with Lisbeth's special skills, dark moods and vindictive motivations; lively conversation before and after the film suggested a group already well-versed through the pages of the novels.  Each time Salander displayed her ample hacking abilities, unselfconsciously took what she wanted and knowingly puzzled out a conundrum of Chinese proportions, the audience burst into appreciative laughter or applause, suggesting that the cult of the underdog as epitomized by the tattooed and pierced eighty-something pound, 24 year old Salander was alive and well admired by the sector of American senior citizens who frequent long foreign speaking films with English subtitles.This reviewer's disappointment came only once with the film's exclusion of the last scene of the novel where Salander, in observing love interest Blomkvist with long-time lover Erika Berger, feels pangs of the ever familiar betrayal, jealousy and resentment of which she has grown accustomed.  Seeing Salander's vulnerability in this context would have segued me right into the next film with no degree of difficulty.  I also wondered if those who had not read the book prior to seeing the film had difficulty keeping all the plot threads tucked neatly into a well-organized ball.Bottom line? Director Niels Arden Oplev's adaptation of journalist Stieg Larsson's 600+ page crime thriller, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" successfully entertains and captivates its audience with a faithful representation of the first in a series of three films based on the Millennium trilogy recounting the trials and tribulations of an abused and misunderstood girl with extraordinary powers of perception and technological skills.  Cinematography by Eric Kress features a lovely and diffused snow-flaked Sweden compared to the harsh depravity of some of it inhabitants as seen baldly under the glare of too bright light that show every crease, wrinkle and enlarged pore.  Noomi Rapace's performance as Lisbeth smarts with an indignation and nonconformity applauded by audiences of all ages and mindsets.  A thoroughly entertaining and compelling storyline underlined by special skills makes this one a must see for all those who love the crime genre.  Filmed in Swedish with English subtitles.  Mature themes and graphic violence not intended for viewing by young children.  Highly Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",5,This Dragon Flies,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,5215,"['Released', 'just', 'time', 'happily', 'mesh', 'American', 'publishing', 'advent',

1343306,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B003FBNJ4U,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","After resisting for quite a while, I finally decided to check this film out to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing it, I get it ... this is an engrossing, smart, suspenseful film. As a thriller and mystery, it works better than at least 90% of the thrillers/mysteries Hollywood puts out, so I can see why even Americans would be drawn to the film.The film first introduces its two main characters, Mikael and Lisbeth, separately, and then gradually ties their stories together. Mikael is a middle-aged journalist about to be wrongfully convicted of libel (which is apparently a crime in Sweden punishable by prison time) who is asked by an aging aristocrat to investigate the 40-year old disappearance/murder of his favorite niece. Lisbeth is a troubled, 24 year old professional hacker with a dark and tragic past and an even darker present. She becomes acquainted with Mikael while first being hired to hack into his files, and then, after gaining an interest herself in solving the 40-year-old murder, is recruited by him to assist in the investigation.Lisbeth is a knockout character (played wonderfully by an actress, Noomi Rapace, who I've never heard of before but will never forget). She's a paradox and an enigma. She's clearly damaged after a lifetime of horrific abuse, but refuses to be a victim, doling out vengeance and violence mercilessly when appropriate. Yet she also clearly has maintained her own sense of morality and humanity. Noomi Rapace gives a subtly magnetic and charismatic performance, and you can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen.Although the film belongs to Lisbeth, her character has a nice chemistry with Mikael. As the two work together to dig through decades of one family's dark secrets in order to solve the mystery, the two develop a subtle, tentative bond. Lisbeth is guarded to say the least, but it's clear that she sees Mikael as one of the very few people in life she might actually be able to trust. When Lisbeth initiates sex with Mikael, it seems odd, for many reasons, but it makes sense in a weird way ... maybe it's Lisbeth's only way of showing affection, or maybe Lisbeth just wants to know what it's like to have sex with a man who isn't going to horribly abuse her.By the end of the film, the central mystery has been solved, and some more of Lisbeth's tragic past has been revealed. And as a viewer, I was left immediately wanting more ... which is why the sequel went immediately to the top of my ""must watch"" list.",5,Charisma,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2497,"['resisting', 'quite', 'while', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'seeing', 'get', 'engrossing', 'smart', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'better', 'least', '90', '%', 'thrillers/mysteries', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'even', 'Americans', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'film.The', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Mikael', 'Lisbeth', 'separately', 'then', 'gradually', 'stories', 'together', 'Mikael', 'middle-aged', 'journalist', 'be', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'libel', 'apparently', 'crime', 'Sweden', 'punishable', 'prison', 'time', 'who', 'asked', 'aging', 'aristocrat', 'investigate', '40-year', 'old', 'disappearance/murder', 'favorite', 'niece', 'Lisbeth', 'troubled', '24', 'year', 'old', 'professional', 'hacker', 'dark', 'tragic', 'past', 'even', 'darker', 'present', 'acquainted', 'Mikael', 'first', 'being', 'hired', 'hack', 'files', 'then', 'gaining', 'interest', 'herself', 'solving', '40-year-old', 'murder', 'recruited', 'assist', 'investigation.Lisbeth', 'knockout', 'character', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'actress', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'paradox', 'enigma', 'clearly', 'damaged', 'lifetime', 'horrific', 'abuse', 'be', 'victim', 'doling', 'out', 'vengeance', 'violence', 'mercilessly', 'when', 'appropriate', 'also', 'clearly', 'maintained', 'own', 'sense', 'morality', 'humanity', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'subtly', 'magnetic', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'when', 'screen.Although', 'film', 'belongs', 'Lisbeth', 'character', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'Mikael', 'two', 'work', 'together', 'dig', 'decades', 'one', 'family', 'dark', 'secrets', 'order', 'solve', 'mystery', 'two', 'develop', 'subtle', 'tentative', 'bond', 'Lisbeth', 'guarded', 'say', 'least', 'clear', 'Mikael', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'life', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'When', 'Lisbeth', 'sex', 'Mikael', 'odd', 'many', 'reasons', 'sense', 'weird', 'way', 'Lisbeth', 'only', 'way', 'showing', 'affection', 'maybe', 'Lisbeth', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'sex', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'going', 'horribly', 'abuse', 'her.By', 'end', 'film', 'central', 'mystery', 'been', 'solved', 'more', 'Lisbeth', 'tragic', 'past', 'been', 'revealed', 'viewer', 'was', 'left', 'immediately', 'wanting', 'more', 'why', 'sequel', 'went', 'immediately', 'top', 'must', 'watch', 'list']",N/A

The book is fantastic, but cerebral. This version reflects that by not relying upon sound effects and other tricks to make the story hit you in the gut. Rather, this one does it simply be catching the creepy nature of the story through acting and how the film is shot. The imagery does a great job of sharing a mood that stresses the loss felt by one character, and that is as clear as the author of the book intended it to be. This is great because it prevents the story from being caught up in over the top imagery and Hollywood tricks.

1343308,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B003FBNJ4U,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[2, 2]","For the last two years or so, there's been a pretty large phenomenon relating to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  I've consistently heard good things about the books and Swedish films, and fairly recently with David Fincher's adaptation of the TGWTDT books, I've had more people talk about it with me more.  Finally, I decided to invest some time in my night tonight to watch the first Swedish film in its extended cut form, since it was free video for Amazon Prime users.  Boy am I glad to have seen this, and I gladly would have paid to see it as well!!STORYA journalist named Mikael Blomkvist loses a libel case involving allegations he published against tycoon Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.  While this happens, a surveillance agent named Lisbeth Salander is contracted to investigate Blomkvist.  After her investigation, Lisbeth sends her findings to lawyer Dirch Frode, who's only client is an 82 year-old man named Henrik Vanger.  Vanger hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of Harriet, his great niece, who vanished in 1966.CHARACTERSOne of the best aspects to this film is that its characters are well-developed, believable, and have great chemistry.  Of course, the stars of this show are Blomkvist and Salander.  The latter is especially engaging since we see her as someone tough yet vulnerable (this makes for a realistic character).  Near the beginning, we see Salander as a girl who's not one to be a pushover when a bunch of drunk male hooligans start scuffling with her and she beats them back.  However, when her guardian has a stroke and is assigned a new guardian that forces her to perform sexual acts on him for her own money, she's forced to take it at first.  Without spoiling much, you'll be glad to see when the tables are turned on her new guardian.  Blomkvist is a good protagonist since you see him as a guy who just trying to do his job as a journalist, but gets shafted by a seedy tycoon and sees Vanger's offer as a way to get himself something good before he has to go to jail.The supporting characters are solid as well.  Henrik Vanger's family is confined to living on an island that's only accessible via bridge and without fitting into any cardboard cutouts, feel and act like people who live in a small place and keep themselves away from the rest of society.  Without spoiling anything, let's just say that like any mystery-thriller worth its salt, some characters are totally unpredictable.  Nils Bjurman, Salander's sexually-sadistic guardian, is excellent as a slimy character.  I can keep going, but I think you get the picture.PLOTTINGDespite that the extended cut of this movie is 186 minutes long, it felt more like it was around 120 minutes because of how engaging the story and characters are.  Also, much like the well-developed characters in a mystery-thriller film, the plotting of the story was so well-written that I was on the edge of my seat, hardly expecting anything that would happen to happenn.  Because of how engaging everything else was, there were some scenes of legitimate tension going on near the end of the film.  Also without spoiling much, I was a little worried around the 80% point of the film that some issues wouldn't be resolved in the end, but much to my surprise, these issues were resolved and done so in a way that didn't feel very rushed or incomplete.ACTINGSince I'm not a native speaker of the Swedish language, I can't really say what constitutes as ""good acting"" in Swedish, but I'll say that the actors did so well with their roles that the last thing on my mind was the acting.  In particular, Michael Nyqvist (Blomkvist), Noomi Rapace (Salander), and Sven-Bertil Taube (Henrik Vanger) delivered some of the best performances in this film.APPEARANCEThe cinematography in this movie is totally stunning.  The shots of the streets in Stockholm and of the island where the Vanger family resides simultaneously drip with beauty and of griminess.  The beauty in that there's lush shots of the Swedish countryside and winter, and the griminess when you learn about the ugly events that occur in some places.SOUNDTRACKThe score for this film is really good.  Like the plotting of the film, the score is slow and creeps up on you for an excellent build-up that dives into an excellent payoff when something truly exciting jumps out at you.  The music perfectly fits the tone of the movie.THEMESThe theme I caught on most to this movie is that of anti-misogyny.  I thought this theme was handled well because at first, I thought this would degenerate into baseless man-bashing, but that's not the case.  The misogynistic male characters in this movie are all portrayed in believable strokes, which really helped the delivery of this theme.  It also helps that the protagonist, Blomkvist, isn't portrayed as an ideal ""neutered"" male that's made to be acceptable among feminists.Also, corruption seems like a big theme since Blomkvist is convicted of libel even though he was on to a factual story for his magazine, Millenium.  The corruption can even tie in a little with the anti-misogyny theme since a sadistic man like Bjurman is allowed to be a guardian on the government payroll, despite how awful he is.MATURE CONTENTThis is NOT a movie for the kids to see.  There's some scenes of strong violence, nudity, sex, and rape.  There's scenes of mutilated corpses, shots of bare female chests and butts (and of male butts, too), and a hard to watch rape scene with Salander handcuffed and gagged while Bjurman rapes her.  There's even a scene where a male gets tied up, gagged, and sodomized.FINAL WORDI honestly can't say if this movie follows the books well since I haven't read any of them, but just judging the movie strictly on its own terms, it's marvelous.  I'll soon be checking out the two sequels, and do yourself a favor and seek out the extended cut of this movie since the extra time seems to be used perfectly.  If you're an Amazon Prime user, there's no excuse to watch this now if you have some free time, since you can watch it for free.  Otherwise, track down a physical or digital copy ASAP.",5,Totally lives up to the hype.  94%,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,6092,"['last', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'been', 'pretty', 'large', 'phenomenon',

1343310,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B003FBNJ4U,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish thriller.  But a Swedish thriller it is.And the film adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's first bestselling novel is a soon-to-be-classic example of a movie that has way more going on than it appears. It's a bit on the slow side at times, but it also has a raw, stark quality that hits you harder than any Hollywood blockbuster could -- and Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are nothing short of awe-inspiring.Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive.Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece, Harriet. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island home, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.  When Mikael agrees to take the case, he's cybershadowed by the abused goth hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).Eventually Lisbeth reveals herself to Mikael by decoding vital information and sending it to him. Intrigued by this strange wounded woman, Mikael asks her to help him in his cold-case investigation, and the two begin unwinding a bizarre string of serial killings from long ago -- all tied to Bible quotes. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the long-missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry ""girl with the dragon tattoo.""And it translates Larsson's novel beautifully -- there's a raw, almost primitive power to the story, under all the snow and icy Swedish landscape. Niels Arden Oplev gives the movie a sort of stark wild beauty, but also weaves in some horribly disturbing scenes (the ghastly, helpless rape of Lisbeth by her corrupt ""guardian"" -- followed by a gleefully horrific scene where she gets her revenge). And the murder mystery is absolutely brilliant, especially when Lisbeth unravels Harriet's code.And Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- Nyquist's journalist is worn and weary of the world, and both the Harriet case and meeting Lisbeth rekindle his interest in the truth. And Rapace is absolutely electric as Lisbeth, who is one of the most devastatingly brilliant characters in modern cinema -- she's a wild, bleeding creature who hides her bruises behind a mask of piercings and jet-dyed hair, and whose torn-up heart begins to heal a little when she meets Mikael.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is blessed with brilliant direction, powerful acting, and a stark look at the way women are treated by cruel men. Not a light movie, but definitely a classic in the making.",5,The girl in the bloody thriller,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3046,"['Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'more', 'kung-fu', 'movie', 'Swedish', 'thriller', 'Swedish', 'thriller', 'film', 'adapted', 'late', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'first', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'soon-to-be-classic', 'example', 'movie', 'way', 'more', 'going', 'bit', 'slow', 'side', 'times', 'also', 'raw', 'stark', 'quality', 'harder', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'could', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'awe-inspiring.Take-no-prisoners', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'just', 'lost', 'reputation', 'savings', 'freedom', 'hello', 'jail', 'sentence', 'nasty', 'libel', 'suit', 'executive.Then', 'unexpectedly', 'contacted', 'aged', 'industrialist', 'Henrik', 'Vanger', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'guy', 'grandniece', 'Harriet', 'vanished', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'family', 'isolated', 'island', 'home', 'body', 'alive', 'dead', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'When', 'Mikael', 'take', 'case', 'cybershadowed', 'abused', 'goth', 'hacker', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', '.Eventually', 'Lisbeth', 'Mikael', 'decoding', 'vital', 'information', 'sending', 'Intrigued', 'strange', 'wounded', 'woman', 'Mikael', 'help', 'cold-case', 'investigation', 'two', 'begin', 'unwinding', 'bizarre', 'string', 'serial', 'killings', 'long', 'ago', 'tied', 'Bible', 'quotes', 'Mikael', 'clues', 'Harriet', 'disappearance', 'also', 'skeletons', 'long', 'kept', 'buried', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'aesthetic', 'locked-room', 'murder', 'dozen', 'suspects', 'ruthless', 'look', 'modern', 'Swedish', 'society', 'study', 'sexual', 'aggression', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'unfair', 'world', 'where', 'truth', 'quashed', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'horribly', 'long-missing', 'Harriet', 'eccentric', 'angry', 'girl', 'dragon', 'tattoo', 'Larsson', 'novel', 'beautifully', 'raw', 'almost', 'primitive', 'power', 'story', 'snow', 'icy', 'Swedish', 'landscape', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'movie', 'sort', 'stark', 'wild', 'beauty', 'also', 'horribly', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'ghastly', 'helpless', 'rape', 'Lisbeth', 'corrupt', 'guardian', 'followed', 'gleefully', 'horrific', 'scene', 'where', 'revenge', 'murder', 'mystery', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'when', 'Lisbeth', 'Harriet', 'code.And', 'Mikael', 'Salander', 'make', 'intriguing', 'odd', 'couple', 'Nyquist', 'journalist', 'worn', 'weary', 'world', 'Harriet', 'case', 'meeting', 'Lisbeth', 'interest', 'truth', 'Rapace', 'absolutely', 'electric', 'Lisbeth', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'devastatingly', 'brilliant', 'characters', 'modern', 'cinema', 'wild', 'bleeding', 'creature', 'who', 'bruises', 'mask', 'piercings', 'jet-dyed', 'hair', 'torn-up', 'heart', 'heal', 'little', 'when', 'Mikael', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'blessed', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'powerful', 'acting', 'stark', 'look', 'way', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'cruel', 'men', 'Not', 'light', 'movie', 'definitely', 'classic', 'making']",N/A

Swedish title 'M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor', from the original novel by Stieg Larsson, 2009, 135 minutes) was quite the wild ride - and not for the faint of heart. This Swedish instant classic is, like all Swedish film, unashamed about showing truth as realistically as possible. Yet I must confess that with all I have seen in life, I wonder whether I'll be able to sleep tonight after seeing this. It is THAT good.An intrepid Goth-girl-computer-hacker, Lizbeth Salander (exquisitely played by No'omi Rapace) becomes far too interested in a prominent journalist, Mikael (Michael Nyqvist), who gets sued for libel and sentenced to 3 months' jail time. He has a while before that sentence is to begin, and in that interim he is contacted by a benevolent old man. This man wants to find out what happened to his 'adopted' daughter (really his niece) - who vanished in the 1960s. The old man wants the journalist to discover what may have happened, and there is an immediately stated suspicion that this girl is dead.That much I leave there, but I have some observations about this. With all the undoubtedly over-hyped fuss regarding the recent British remake of this, and with the original novels, I can say I came blindly into this. Luckily I stumbled onto the DVD after having said ""Pass"" when it was on cable. Americans take, remake and just spoil the heck out of all these excellent films. Especially the Swedish ones. This series should have been left to the Swedes. I don't see any Brit or American dopes trying to remake CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON!This is an important film. The Goth girl, with a dragon tattoo that wreathes her entire body, is a new kind of superhero. She's been a victim but never 'played' the victim. She's gotten her revenge from the time she was a child. She has a photographic memory that is part of her arsenal and a set of cojones that made me green with envy. Her brains and investigative prowess made me greener. You will be stunned at the world's cruelty to her; you will be equally stunned by the strong message in this story: too many people hate women just for being women.There is much more in this rich, exciting film. Swedes are catching us up in America, and soon will be outdoing us on a regular basis. My feeling is they are only stopped by their economic woes. Once their money and political problems blow over, I hope to see hundreds of films as wonderful, chilling and educational as THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I look forward to seeing THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE (""Flickan som lekte med elden""), which holds the rest of Lizbeth's story - and the third film, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST (""Luftslottet som spr&auml;ngdes""), all of which are 2009 Swedish films, shot back-to-back as one film.In the excellent extra on my DVD, No'omi talks about working on these films for over a year, doing nothing else during that time. Sadly, the DVD extras are extremely paltry.The latter two movies are, of course, also slated to be filmed and released in British versions, by way of Columbia Pictures.

So I was in salivating mode when I popped this baby in the DVD player. Everything I'd heard about both the books and the movies was very positive.It was everything I'd hoped for. Just everything about this movie is so right.  The set up of the circumstance with Mikael's loss of the libel suet. Meeting Lisbeth and learning of her capabilities as a researcher. The hiring of Mikael for the investigation all happen the right way. You are into these people from the get go. When they start working with one another and these two seemingly opposites start to click it is something to behold. I won't re-tell the plot as many others have already done so, but this story unfolds like a blossoming flower. All the points are clever and well measured. And when there is the inevitable snowballing of information in the final stages, and you think you have it nailed down, there is still an ace up the sleeve.This is a very professional film. All the aspects of production are top shelf. The sets, cinematography, sound and music meld together in a near seamless fashion. Something else I liked is that nobody in the cast has drool over Hollywood faces. They all look like real people. And though not all of the Hollywood type aspects in the storytelling are avoided, it is still clever enough and fresh enough to please even the most demanding of fans.Myself being a big fan of the mystery-thriller genre I put this right up there with ""Seven"", ""The Secret in Their Eyes"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"".

1343322,A1CHM200OEN65X,B003FBNJ4U,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[1, 2]","I'm a fan of foreign films, and with the runaway success of Stieg Larsson's novels (which I haven't read), I had high hopes going into this film. Perhaps too high.Set in Sweden, the story follows a disgraced investigative reporter who gets hired privately to investigate the disappearance of a teen girl forty years earlier. Young Harriet vanished from an island, leaving behind a diary that is cryptic and leaves some clues for the reporter, Mikael, to follow. Soon, he is joined in his efforts by the girl with the dragon tattoo, a smart, caustic, and embattled woman with her own demons to fight. Together, the two dig deeper into the decades-old secrets of the Vanger family, Nazis, and sexual perversion.The production and acting are first-class, and the music adds nice atmosphere without being too dramatic. Despite these elements, though, the story drags. And drags. Two and a half hours could've been cut by forty-five minutes. It's more mystery than thriller, and a thin mystery at that. My real complaint is the way in which Mikael uncovers clues. His evidence is largely circumstantial. That girl staring off in one direction in an old photo must be staring at her killer? Really? That killer is wearing the same shirt he wore in another photo, just so we could identify him clearly? Really? And there is good reason to go exploring in an old man's house, assuming that he has held onto incriminating tidbits for four decades? For that matter, the mysterious gifts that keep arriving at the family's house seem to point an obvious direction, but that is conveniently overlooked through most of the movie. Lisbeth, the girl with the famed tattoo, does give some insight on one aspect of the case regarding some biblical references, but her alleged photographic memory plays no vital part in the story.Overall, I kept wanting to like this film. The final fifteen minutes gave some payoff--finally!--but I felt the same way I did watching ""The Da Vinci Code"" on the big screen. You mean, that's what all the hype was about?

It wasn't worse, but it was just as bad. The movie experience, being streamlined, was a bit more tolerable.  Nevertheless, it was still a waste of time. This is why:1) Motivation: Neither the author, nor the film-maker, ever explained why Lisbeth got so involved with Mikael's case. She simply had no reason to hack into his computer, much less do any of the other things she did for him.2) Meandering plot line: Larsson couldn't decide what plot most interested him, so he did them all--Nazi sadists, incest victims, murderers, corporate corruption, the journalist in need of redemption, and so on.  Too many plot lines spoil the soup.3) Awful dialogue: Oh, how I miss silent films! The book suffered from terrible stilted dialogue, and so did the movie.  ""I won't ask what happened to you.  You saved my life.  So, I won't ask what happened to you."" ""Thank you."" That was a high point.4) Two-dimensional, undeveloped characters: Now, I'm just being kind. Larrson saddled his book with the most over-used villain of all times: the Nazi sadist. And, to compensate for the fact that the original Nazis are pretty much all dead, he made one of them 16 so he could push them into the late 20th century.  Then he added other sadists, rapists and molesters to round things out. The ""good guys"" were no more developed than the bad guys (even though putting a sympathetic face on Mikael made him somewhat more bearable than he was in the book).5) Logic flaws: If Lisbeth was such a computer genius, why couldn't she just hack into her own bank account (or anybody else's for that matter)? Why would a man who tried to shoot someone decide later on to strangle him slowly and painfully with a winch? Why would a corporate head hire a not particularly savvy journalist to solve a 40-year-old murder? How come nobody noticed a large oar-shaped bruise on the chest of a man who died from ""accidental"" drowning? Why did it take so long for the journalist and the computer wiz to figure out whodunnit if the audience could figure it out right from the start? The errors go on forever--tides that somehow don't wash bodies ashore, police who don't take fingerprints or employ any type of forensics, government agencies that don't monitor state-appointed guardians, and so on.  We are not only asked to suspend disbelief in this movie, we are asked to suspend intelligence.This movie and the book it was based on (original title: Men Who Hate Women) have been touted as a social statement about violence against women.  Nothing of the kind. Getting murdered by sadist Nazi serial killers isn't a serious problem in the world, much less in Sweden, where the murder rate is so low the UN doesn't even register it (less than 1 per 100,000). Real brutality against women--the grinding poverty in which huge numbers of women are forced to raise their children, the lack of legal representation, the utter disdain with which women's health and social issues are treated, and, last but not least, the LEGAL, state-sanctioned abuse, mutilation and murder of women--was not given a mention.

It is interesting that David Fincher who had made""Seven,"" is working on the American re-make of the tattooed girl already, even though the Swedish film was released less than a year ago. The film is good, not great but certainly very watchable and it is the most interesting when Noomi Raspace's Lisbeth Salander takes the screen. This is a character with obviously something so horrifying in her past that had changed her forever and altered her life in many ways. Lisbeth is a a Computer hacker of highest class and she helps to the popular but fallen on the hard times financial journalist Mikael Blomqvist who faces the jail time for the lost libel case against the powerful industrialist to solve the cold case of the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The beautiful and sweet 16 year old girl from a wealthy and influential family disappeared without a trace 40 years ago, and her uncle, 82 year old Henrik Vanger the owner of Vanger Corporation, wants Mikael to take a closer look at the case. The film is long, 152 minutes, but is quite watchable due to good pacing, interesting story, and one of the most fascinating, complex and enigmatic characters that I've seen in the movies in long time. Must warn you that the movie fits its original title Men Who hate The Women and contains several scenes of violence toward women and equally brutal but in my opinion and in the opinion of my 80 years old mother and my husband highly justified but difficult to watch revenge scene. As it is well known, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first book in the phenomenally successful Millennium trilogy by a Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson, published after his sudden and untimely death. Larsson wrote the books for his pleasure, and decided to offer them for publication shortly before his death. Larsen called the first novel Men who hated women, but it was released in English as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.Millennium trilogy is one of the world's best sellers. Three novels were translated to over 40 languages and sold 27 million copies. Larsson stated that the main source of inspiration in create the character of Lisbeth, was Sweden's most beloved heroine of children literature, Pippi Long Stocking by Astrid Lindgren. I would add Pippi the survivor of nightmarish horrible childhood ... I have not read the books yet but I most certainly will and I will be waiting for the rest of the movies' release.

Lawrence,"[6, 6]","This week I watched both this Swedish Blu-Ray and saw the just-released American remake in the theater, and I have read the first two books.I rate both versions at five stars--great films. There is 5.1 Dolby Digital in Swedish with the option of dubbed English dialog. I watched the Swedish language version with English subtitles, although the English dubbing did seem pretty good. The quality of sound and picture on the Blu-Ray is excellent.This Swedish film is closer to the book in detail and in dramatic portrayal. The scenery seemed more stark and cold, and the murders more appalling. Lizbeth's propensity for violence is better portrayed, and as the film progresses we get better insight into why Lizbeth is socially dysfunctional than in the American version. The reporter, Blomkvist, spends three months in jail in the Swedish version, but no jail time in the American version, and his humiliation is therefore all the greater.Noomi Repaces's Lizbeth is harsher than that of Rooney Mara in the American version and therefore more effective. Rooney Mara's amazing beauty inevitably softens her character in the American version even though her acting is excellent. The fate of the dead niece, Harriet, is far closer to the book in the Swedish version and has more dramatic impact.Noomi Repaces's dragon tattoo covers her back and is truly formidable. After all, the tattoo is the point of the title.There are many other gratuitous discrepancies in the American version that detract from the drama that made Larsson's book so powerful.Blomquist is portrayed as the same sharp researcher and unaware babe-magnet in both films. Michael Nyqvist and Daniel Craig both give excellent performances--true to Larsson's character--with Craig having the edge.If you are comfortable with subtitles, then this Swedish version might be your best choice, especially if you have already read the novel. If you prefer a more American style movie with well-known, somewhat better looking, Hollywood actors; especially if you have not read the book; then the American version may be your best choice.

Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....?Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered.The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing.

The challenge of turning something as deeply engrained in the minds of millions into a film is a daunting task, to say the least. But the film stands on it's own remarkably well, echoing the best mysteries mixed with the mood pioneered by The Silence of the Lambs.Mikael Blomkvist, the main character of the film is presented immediately as an avid investigative journalist who has apparently taken a wrong step in his investigation of a business tycoon, who has successfully charged him with libel. The film then gently pushes aside this opening in a way that the book does not, which I believe allows the audience to more thoroughly focus on the entrance of Lisbeth Salander, the true star of the show despite her meager, teen gothic appearance. Salander has been hired by a security firm she freelances for to conduct a background investigation of Blomkvist, and the looks on the actors faces as she presents her wildly extensive report instantly convey the fact that this girl is good at what she does. But she is also considered mentally unstable by the Swedish government, and has been recently placed in the guardianship of a harsh and cold businessman. I have to stop with my summary here because anything beyond what I have already written would begin to spoil the surprises that are, in my opinion, very worth it.Suffice it to say, fate and computer hacking bring Blomkvist and Salander together in a remote part of Sweden as they conduct a search for information relating to the disappearance of a niece of the industrialist Vanger family. The pair are both broken, Lisbeth distraught with her very station in life and Blomkvist dethroned from his position of power within the magazine he owns a stake in, Millenium. The story turns darkly towards the end, and I can personally testify to the fact that the story has a satisfying ending which can chill you, despite the fact that the last frames of the film are, in a way, darkly comic, at least in emu opinion. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo comes in at 2 and a half hours but is a tough film to get bored in thanks to an ominous directorial style coupled with interesting characters and a beautiful backdrop.

This endeavor is different from the start.  The movie adaptation of the first of Stieg Larrson's fabulous trilogy about crimes against women (Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) starts with a mystery-who killed young Harriet Vanger in 1966?  The enquiry travels back to what mystery writers call a ""closed room"" in this case an island which for a twenty-four hour period allowed neither entry nor escape. Compounding the problem is that Harriet's body has never been found. Each year on his birthday, industrialist and family patriarch Henrik Vanger receives an eerie present sent from random spots on the globe. Heinrik who loved his niece as if she were his own child, assumes these gifts to be taunts from her killer. Now elderly he wants the killer caught and punished before his own death.Enter the detective, Mikael Blomkvist. In this case the sleuth is a journalist, disgraced by a criminal conviction in a libel suit brought by a rival industrialist. On leave from his magazine for six months before before beginning his short prison sentence, Blomquist slowly peals back the layers of mystery surrounded by enigma of what is a very intriguing family. The Vanger kin range from the saintly like Heinrik and his missing niece to the grotesque. Blomquist enlists Lisbeth Salander, a quixotic researcher for a Stockholm security firm to assist his search.As a movie, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo succeeds on so many fronts. The screenplay is faithful to the novel, and complex subplots are skillfully explored. The two leads Michael Nyqvist as Blomquist and Noomi Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo (and what a tattoo it is!) are superb. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the fresh cold Swedish winter in a manner reminiscent of the winter dacha scenes inDoctor Zhivago Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray Book). It is a movie whose subtitles do not interfere with one's enjoyment.

It's basically a murder mystery, and there are plenty of twists and turns, as well as a strong sense of suspense which builds as the story unfolds.  Beware that there are some rather dark and disturbing scenes and themes which illustrate the lows to which humans can dip, so you have to brace yourself for that, but this is somewhat balanced by the movie portraying human decency and goodness, plus justice often prevails in the end.  The net result is that, although this certainly isn't a feel-good movie, it's not a horror flick either.Overall, all the elements of the movie are of high quality and they fit together well, so I found it easy to remain engaged for the required 2+ hours.  For me, a big part of the appeal of the movie is that it's set in Sweden (a country I've long wanted to visit), so much of the scenery is beautiful.  The Swedish setting is also important because, if there are attributes of the characters or plot which you would normally find hard to believe, the fact that you're dealing with another culture helps you suspend any disbelief and just go with the flow.

I really enjoyed the movie, although there were parts that were shockingly violent and gratuitous.  However, after being inspired to read the book, I went back and re-watched the movie.  This movie did to its book counterpart the same thing that Ron Howard did to ""Angels and Demons"": The underlying plot was basically the same, but the main characters and supporting points were drastically altered.  To name just a few:1) In the original story, Mikael is supposed to be working for Henrik under the auspice of writing a Vanger family history, so as not to arouse suspicion about his investigation.  In the movie, his investigation into the disappearance/murder of Harriet is plain knowledge to everyone from the moment he is hired.2) In the original story, Mikael discovered Lisbeth's prior hacking into his computer on his own, due to a slip from Dirch Frode and a mistake by Lisbeth in her research report.  In the movie, this got changed to Lisbeth basically revealing herself to Mikael by sending him an unencrypted e-mail that solved the mystery of the ""phone numbers"" (in the original story, this mystery was actually solved by a comment from Mikael's daughter).  This may not seem like a big point, but it completely changed the dynamic of Mikael and Lisbeth's first meeting (it made the scene far less playful on Mikael's part, and far less astounded on Lisbeth's part).3) Mikael is supposed to be an attractive ladies man (having separate affairs with Erika, Cecilia, and Lisbeth over the course of the book) with a good heart.  The way they portrayed him in this movie made him look like a lost puppy pining for Lisbeth after she has sex with him for the first time.4) Lisbeth is supposed to have far more emotional depth than simply being a tough, introverted, slightly imbalanced goth girl.  I feel like Noomi Rapace did a good job with the script she was given, but the script itself didn't allow for much more than a superficial look into Lisbeth's character.5) In the original story, Mikael and Lisbeth end up discovering that Martin is the killer at the same time, but at different locations and from different angles.

I then understood why those scenes were important to the story.  Early on I could see that her character was written to be a hero.  Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nygvist) is a brave journalist who never wavers in bringing corruption to the forefront.  These two characters are the exact opposite of each other which kept me curious as to how they would continue to interact.  I have seen this movie about 10 times and I'm not tired of it yet.

I will say that this movie is one of the more entertaining thrillers to come out in recent years. While most american studios seem to reserve material like this for TV series, 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' along with 2008's 'Tell No One' show that the procedural/thriller genre can still make a strong movie-going experience.'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is about disgraced investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist who's been hired by an old rich industrialist to investigate the 40 year old disappearance of his foster child, who also happened to be someone Mikael knew as a child. Mikael ends up teaming with Lisbeth Salander a security consoltant and hacker and they both end up digging up secrets and a violent family history. The story very much plays out like a mystery novel, first introducing some character backgrounds (Mikael is facing jail time for losing a libel case, Lisbeth is a loner and sexually/physically abused by men in her life) then slowly introduces us to the suspects and then mostly follows Mikael and Lisbeth as they do internet and record searches to slowly uncover decades-long conspiracies as well as a serial killer.What I like most about 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is the seemingly normal charcters and setting. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as Mikael looking exactly how you'd picture a middle-aged, out of shape journalist. Noomi Rapace is equally well chosen as Lisbeth while (even in nude scenes) not looking too sexy but not ugly by any means either. Even when both characters are dealing with larger-than-life situations and their slightly budding attraction to each other neither one loses their credibility nor believability. I also loved that the characters were using real software and search engines like 'Google' to look up information.If I have a complaint with this film it's probably with the background and abuse of the Lisbeth character. While Mikael's personal connection to the case keeps us rooting for him Lisbeth's motivations seem to keep changing on the fly. I realise this makes her a bit more complex (and lets face it she IS the title character) it seems the more we find out about her the less interesting or more confusing she becomes. I felt terrible for what happens to her character (and couldn't help myself rooting for her getting her revenge on her abusive legal guardian) but I also found her hard to like at points to. Maybe I'm just getting sick of stories (usually written by men) that feel the only way to have a strong female character is to put her through the physical/sexual abuse wringer. It makes sense with the story's theme of violence against women but again I found it a bit hard to swallow.While the violence in 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is far from exploitive, it can be hard to take at points. There are a scenes involving rape (though thankfully don't last very long) and instances of body mutilation (post mordem). Like I said none of these scenes are explict but they can be disturbing to watch.Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent suspense film. If you liked thrillers like 'Tell No One' or are just itching for a good 'who-done-it' mystery this movie is a must see.",4,a winning thriller.....,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,3304,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'novel', ""'Girl"", 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'close', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'thrillers', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'most', 'american', 'studios', 'seem', 'reserve', 'material', 'TV', 'series', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '2008', 'One', 'show', 'procedural/thriller', 'genre', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'strong', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'disgraced', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'old', 'rich', 'industrialist', 'investigate', '40', 'year', 'old', 'disappearance', 'foster', 'child', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'someone', 'Mikael', 'knew', 'child', 'Mikael', 'up', 'teaming', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'security', 'consoltant', 'hacker', 'end', 'up', 'digging', 'up', 'secrets', 'violent', 'family', 'history', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'out', 'mystery', 'novel', 'first', 'introducing', 'character', 'backgrounds', 'Mikael', 'facing', 'jail', 'time', 'losing', 'libel', 'case', 'Lisbeth', 'loner', 'sexually/physically', 'abused', 'men', 'life', 'then', 'slowly', 'suspects', 'then', 'mostly', 'Mikael', 'Lisbeth', 'do', 'internet', 'record', 'searches', 'slowly', 'uncover', 'decades-long', 'conspiracies', 'as', 'well', 'serial', 'killer.What', 'like', 'most', ""'Girl"", 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'charcters', 'setting', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'perfect', 'Mikael', 'looking', 'exactly', 'how', ""'d"", 'picture', 'middle-aged', 'shape', 'journalist', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'equally', 'well', 'chosen', 'Lisbeth', 'even', 'nude', 'scenes', 'not', 'looking', 'too', 'sexy', 'not', 'ugly', 'means', 'Even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'dealing', 'larger-than-life', 'situations', 'slightly', 'budding', 'attraction', 'other', 'one', 'credibility', 'believability', 'also', 'loved', 'characters', 'were', 'using', 'real', 'software', 'search', 'engines', ""'Google"", 'look', 'up', 'information.If', 'have', 'complaint', 'film', 'probably', 'background', 'abuse', 'Lisbeth', 'character', 'Mikael', 'personal', 'connection', 'case', 'rooting', 'Lisbeth', 'motivations', 'seem', 'keep', 'changing', 'fly', 'realise', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'face', 'title', 'character', 'more', 'find', 'out', 'less', 'interesting', 'more', 'confusing', 'felt', 'terrible', 'what', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'rooting', 'getting', 'revenge', 'abusive', 'legal', 'guardian', 'also', 'found', 'hard', 'like', 'points', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'sick', 'stories', 'usually', 'written', 'men', 'feel', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'put', 'physical/sexual', 'abuse', 'wringer', 'sense', 'story', 'theme', 'violence', 'women', 'again', 'found', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow.While', 'violence', ""'Girl"", 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'far', 'exploitive', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'take', 'points', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'rape', 'thankfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'instances', 'body', 'mutilation', 'post', 'mordem', 'said', 'none', 'scenes', 'are', 'explict', 'can', 'be', 'disturbing', 'watch.Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'excellent', 'suspense', 'film', 'liked', 'thrillers', ""'Tell"", 'No', 'One', 'are', 'just', 'itching', 'good', ""'who-done-it"", 'mystery', 'movie', 'must', 'see']",N/A

1343378,AK14VIFRSN6KL,B003FBNJ4U,Jim from Virginia,"[0, 0]","Here's an anomaly: Scandinavian noir that mostly takes place in the sunshine or well-lit interiors, Niels Arden Oplev, who directed this version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, gets high marks for his gutsy re-shaping of the genre. The film also provides standout performances by lead actors Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace (for which Opley probably deserves some credit, as well). Stunning cinematography by Eric Kess and Jens Fischer add to the mix.But there's a drawback. The film suffers by adhering much too closely to the Steig Larsson novel. On the screen, the story becomes impossibly sprawling, with so many plot details that the movie chugs along sluggishly, finally clocking in at more than two and half hours. Misdirected efforts to shave a few seconds here and there -- like having witnesses almost instantly find forty-year-old evidence -- cut a little screen time, but at the price of weakening the film's credibility. A crucial mistake was the unfortunate choice by the director and screenwriters Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterbergand to lavish extensive screen time on the most extravagantly violent aspects of the story. By the time we reach the dramatic climax in the killer's lair, this lurid overload practically begs for parody.The film would have been far more effective if the story line had been trimmed, assorted unnecessary subplots dropped, and the violence subdued so that key plot twists could shine through.If you're a fan of Larsson's novels, you may well enjoy this film. If you're coming at it more as a film buff, you'll likely appreciate its acting and cinematography.

Eventually some old corporate owner wants to hire an investigator to find out what happened 40 years ago to his niece.  The movie gets clumsy again and sets up more characters; relatives of the old corporate owner as suspects in the assumed murder of that niece.  From out of nowhere comes a Goth culture early twenties gal, computer hacking her way along a trail of espionage that ultimately places her and the hired investigator together.  The brutality of what the early twenties gal has for an environment includes a corrupt parole officer that makes the viewing audience involved emotionally as she takes revenge (with years of personal abuse and exploitation venting) upon the corrupt parole officer.  I'm not sure if that was to get me to say ""Hurrah"" or be disgusted at watching somebody lower themselves to the same level just to punish a brute.  It is a bit over done in my opinion, which was no doubt fully intended by the producer and director of this film, and it leaves you hanging for a bit.  There is more sickening and grotesque footage coming, and sadistic, masochistic and otherwise dysfunctional practices come to the screen in enough detail to make the viewer nearly ready to push the eject button on the remote, except for wanting to know if the guilty perpetrator is brought to justice; so the DVD spins on.  There is some wonderful sharing of consensual emotional and physical recreation between the Goth culture young woman and the hired investigator, but by the time the movie gets around to it, this 2-1/2 hour long film has exhausted the viewer mentally and emotionally enough that the roller coaster ride doesn't really seem fun that late in the drama; like it otherwise would.  Noomi Rapace is the Goth culture young woman that I would really like to see in a less dark film, or one that isn't as believable into investigating contemporary crime.  Let's say, maybe she could star in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy feature of ancient Vikings, or knights from the Dark Ages or Renaissance, or futuristic space travel adventures on other planets.  Then put the Goth woman's recreation scene into that format without the horrific, torturous, gruesome crimes against women intended to portray real life possibilities.  Then this actress might get the attention she deserves as an entertainer.  I liked the story well enough, but obviously I'm not into gender crimes against women, and think I'd rather watch a documentary on war and crimes against humanity in general, than become witness vicariously (via DVD) to the misogyny of this film.I watched the movie trailer, and read several reviews, also taking into account the publicity given this film by the recent death of the Swedish author of the book this movie is based upon; and like driving by a fatality traffic accident scene being worked by police and emergency rescue workers - I couldn't look away.  If I got anything out of this movie, it is the concrete reassurance that I don't like movies about crimes against women.  But I will have to admit, this movie delivers everything you anticipate it should - which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.",3,"I bought it, & I'll watch it again.

It is a thriller of the most thrilling kind.  There's intrigue, action, mystery, murder, and conspiracy set in an exotic (for Americans) landscape.  It's also two and a half hours of gripping story.  There's nothing cheap, cheesy or glossy Hollywood about this movie.  It's fantastic and why I love European movies.  If you saw the European movie Traffik and then saw the Hollywood version, you know what I mean.I'm a huge fan of the Millenium trilogy and was terrified that the movie(s) wouldn't do it justice.  No fear.  The actors look and speak exactly as I pictured them, and though some changes were made to the plot in the interest of time and drama, nothing essential was lost.  Everything is pitch-perfect, and though it's Noomi Rapace's movie, Michael Nykvist is a wonderful Blomqvist.  The supporting actors ring just as true and there's not one role that's miscast.  The settings are faithful to Steig Larsson's descriptions; for example the Millenium offices and Blomqvist's cabin in Hedestad look just as they should, lived-in and undecorated.I watched half of the movie with subtitles and half with dubbing.  I recommend the subtitle option if you can stand it, though the dubbing is excellent (go into the Setup menu and find English as a Languages option).  As an extra, there's also a fascinating interview with Noomi Rapace on playing Lisbeth Salander to watch before viewing the movie.  It'll make you appreciate what a skilled and talented actress she is.If you're a fan of the books, don't be afraid to see the movie.  If you've not yet read them, you may as well go buy copies now.

1343388,A30UZ7NZ7XQUIZ,B003FBNJ4U,"Joe Bruno Sr. ""Fiction and Non Fiction author""","[3, 4]","Ladies and Gentlemen, do I have a movie for you. It's called ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.""Like Ali used to say, I'm a poet and don't know it.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a Swedish-made movie with English subtitles, but don't think for a moment that ""Made in Sweden"" is the stamp of an inferior movie. This one rivets you from the very start, and not once during the 2 hour and 35 minute movie did I think it was dragging and running much too long. Since being released in Sweden in 2009, and in America in 2010, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is already the highest grossing Swedish movie of all time.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" which was brilliantly directed by Niels Arden Oplev, is based on the first of a trilogy of novels by Stieg Larsson novel entitled ""Men Who Hate Woman."" That fact is horribly evident, as in this movie, woman are brutalized and killed, and in one scene, horribly raped. Most of the murders, and there were a sting of them spanning 55 years, are discovered after the fact, and it isn't until the movie's surprise ending that we fully realize the scope of the atrocities.The movie starts with the trial of Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), a journalist who works for the powerhouse magazine Millennium. Blomkvist is falsely convicted of libel against a corrupt Swedish industrialist, and he and the magazine are ordered to pay damages, while Blomkvist is ordered to serve 6-9 months in prison. While waiting to serve his sentence, Blomkvist is approached by Henrik Vanger, the eighty-something member of the wealthy Vanger Group, to find the murder of his niece Harriet some forty years earlier, when she was only 16. What makes things more spicy, is that her body was never found, and we're left with the impression in the back of our minds that maybe she isn't really dead after all.After he begins his investigation, Blomkvist realizes he's being followed, photographed and his computer hacked by punk rocker (complete with dual nose rings) Lisbeth Salander, played by Swedish/Spanish actress Noomi Raspeth, in one of the most memorable female performances of the past 25 years. Lisbeth is an expert hacker, who has a troubled past and who may have even set her own father on fire, to stop his sexual advances.During the course of the movie, she gets beaten up by a gang of punks, has a lesbian scene with her lover and is forced to perform oral sex on her evil probation guardian. Then on her next visit to him, he brutally rapes her, in a scene that made my hair stand straight on end. But good triumphs over evil (well, sort of) when Lisbeth exacts her revenge in a scene so deliciously brutal and visually satisfying, a rousing round of applause was in order and was gladly given.As the plot begins to unfold, Lisbeth sends Blomkvist anonymous clues to help him find the truth about the disappearance of Vander's niece, and soon they are both working together, sleeping together (there's one great sex scene), and fighting the forces of evil together. He gets brutally beaten, shot at and grazed in the cheek, and finally hung from his neck by a pulley manned by the movie's ultimate bad guy. Lisbeth rides to his rescue, on a motorcycle of course, and saves the day. After getting Blomkvist's neck out of the noose, she chases the bad guy in his car until he crashes. Then she watches him pleaded for help (as she smirks), and his overturned car goes up in flames. Oops and Ka-Boom!The movie doesn't end here and we are treated to another half hour of tension, as the murders of scores of women, dating back to Hitler's days, are uncovered and explained.Already an American version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is in the works, but I can't imagine any other actress playing the part of Lisbeth. Yet Rapace said she has already withdrawn herself from consideration for the American movie.""I lived in Lisbeth's body and mind for 18 months,"" Repace said in a recent interview. ""I want her out of my life so I can get on with my life.""""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was universally lauded, with special kudos given to Repace.Jason Zingale, movie reviewer for the website Bullz-eye.com, said, ""It should come as no surprise that Noomi Repace has become the face of the franchise, because she is nothing short of magnificent in the buzz-worthy role. The gorgeous Swedish actress is virtually unrecognizable as the tortured hacker who looks, as Larsson writes 'as though she has just emerged from a week-long orgy with a gang of hard rockers.' The much talked about rape scene involving Lisbeth (and the events that follow it) pretty much guarantees that every young actress in Hollywood will be campaigning for the part in David Fincher's American remake.""Too bad Angelina Jolie is pushing 40. If she were 10-15 years younger, she'd be perfect for the part. But then again with today's makeup..........""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is such a fabulous movie, that on a one to five star basis, I give it a full five stars. This movie is so outstanding, I can't help but think I'll be disappointed by the soon-to-be-made American version.",5,Great movie!!

Hope I'm not offending anyone, I didn't know anything about the book series or this version before I saw the Daniel Craig/ Rooney Mara film, otherwise I probably would of watched this version first and I regret not doing so because I'm sure I would of been more open minded and less impatient watching it and not constantly comparing it to the other with it's tight pace and excellent shots omitting any and all unnecessary scenes and dialogue.Glad I got a chance to see Noomi Rapace in Prometheus, a excellent science fiction movie I'd highly recommend.

Netflicks is kind low defininition but this download was great.  Watched it on my laptop.  Good job, Amazon.  I wish I had bought your stock when it was $12 a share back in 1997.Anyway, its an interesting sex crime drama film.  I didn't think the movie was all that great, but the acting was pretty good.  It gets into the dark side of Swedish culture which someone once said to me was only ""German wannabes"" or something to that effect.  I understand they are making an American version of the film starring Daniel Craig.  I wonder how they will change it to ""Americanize"" it.

Rooney,"[1, 1]","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", a book by Stieg Larsson, that I greatly enjoyed and reviewed for Amazon, has spawned a movie version that is extremely well done and is a very faithful rendering of the book. It's in Swedish with English subtitles. If you haven't read the book, the film is a standalone, a very clear film which doesn't require a reading of the novel. It's a very intense, gripping movie that, I think, is going to grab and hold you.Magazine owner and investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, has been found guilty of libeling a big industrial magnate and is sentenced to three months in prison. He has to take a leave from his magazine, and while he's waiting to serve his sentence, he is hired by wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger to find out who in his family murdered his niece, Harriet Vanger, forty years before. Some of the Vanger family, a mean and nasty bunch, live on a private island with him.Mikael moves to the island and later joins forces in the investigation with the tattooed girl. The girl of the title, Lisbeth Salender is very strange with piercings on her face, and she wears very severe-looking tight-fitting jeans and jacket. Her make-up is stark, and she seems menacing and creepy as well as beautiful. She's a computer hacker who investigates cases for a security agency. She can get information that few others can dig up. The investigative techniques and the research procedures are handled very well in this movie. It's fascinating to watch her and Mikael delve into family secrets. Some members of the Vanger family were Nazi sympathizers.The violent, torture and s and m scenes in this movie are almost unbearable to watch, so beware. This is definitely not a movie for the kiddies. Mikael gets deeply involved in the investigation and at one point, he gets shot. Serial killings, mutilations, and serious cases of abuse come up during the probing, and devastating family secrets are brought to light. Flashbacks add to the suspense.The acting in the film is excellent, and the cinematography is outstanding with some sweeping views of the austere Swedish landscape.The book and its two sequels have become international bestsellers, and this movie has been a considerable hit in the world market. Two movie sequels are due soon. It's fitting that the original title of this book was ""Men Who Hate Women.""

I know...most people will say that about any movie versus book comparison.  I guess I was hoping for more from the movie which was done by a Swedish cast and crew, which is the home country of the original author.  However, there are many differences in the way the story unfolds and the details of the investigation of both the disappearance of Harriet Vanger and the libel suit against Blomkvist.  Some of the choices made by the director of the movie left me scratching my head.  Why would they change some of the littlest things?  However, the movie is still watchable.I very much liked the casting for Lisbeth Salander.  It was exactly as I imagined her to look.  She was extremely beautiful, in yet very hardcore.  The actress did a great job and was very believable as this computer hacking seductive young girl.  The Mikael Blomkvist portrayal was equally as compelling.  His presence was very commanding throughout.  The setting in Sweden makes the movie authentic, and watching the movie in Swedish and reading subtitles does make the movie experience special...that foreign movie with subtitles feel is sometimes irresistible.Watch the movie either first or second...but do yourself a favor and read the book.

The more things change the more they stay the same. Where Spade was liable to slap around a suspect to get information, Lisbeth just as easily hacks the suspects computer. Lisbeth Salander is a new detective for a new century.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" follows the plot of the Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name. Michael Blomkvist (Michael Nyquist) and Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) search for the killer of Harriet Vanger and in the doing so reveal disturbing family secrets that include Nazi's, incest, murder, and mutilations. The movie trims off the excess of the novel and brings to the screen the core of the story. A fast moving noir thriller that will keep you glued to the screen. Where the movie deviates from the book it is either to omit subplots or information that doesn't add to the solution of who murdered Harriet. There are a couple of instances where they screenwriters (Nikolaj Arcel, Rasmus Heisterberg) have changed minor details but in the end when the puzzle is fit together it all makes sense.Director Niels Oplev does a good job of bringing all the elements together. A lot of the expository scenes come together as montages and the information to know who is who is  disseminated quickly. Noomi Rapace looks hard and feral as Lisbeth, a woman with a dark past that is only briefly seen in flashback, and a dark present that she deals with on her own terms.The eternal debate of the book or the movie being better probably won't be solved because the book and the movie are different experiences.

1343418,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B003FBNJ4U,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 3]","THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO based on the Swedish novel MEN WHO HATE WOMEN is an intensely engaging film. At 2 1/2 hours, it might seem that the film would be impossibly, indigestably long. In Swedish with subtitles (there is an English language track), it might seem impenetrable. None of that is the case. I watched it through, in Swedish, and never once glanced at my watch.This is a dark film, but it avoids the lugubrious plodding of the typical Ingmar Bergman film, and it avoids the gratuitous hyperintellectualized symbolism of a typical art house piece. In pacing and material, this film has much more in common withThe Silence Of The LambsthanThe Hour of the Wolf.Noomi Rapace plays Goth Girl Lisbeth Salander, a gifted hacker but deeply scarred young woman who works as a Private Investigator's researcher. Lisbeth, who has a history of psychiatric disturbance, is on probation. At the film's outset, she is assigned a new Guardian (a State appointed Probation Officer/Conservator), who brutally rapes her when she meets with him to request her stipend. Lisbeth, with the hardness that only the truly injured can have, retaliates against her tormentor in a grimly satisfying exhibition of sadomasochistic glee, after which she betakes herself back to her own world.Rapace's portrayal of the tattooed, pierced, troubled Lisbeth is so compelling and realistic that I received a slight shock to discover how normative Noomi Rapace appears in the DVD's brief ""Special Features"" interview segment.Michael Lindqvist plays Mikael Blomqvist, an investigative reporter convicted of defaming a major government official. Despite the fact that it is quite clear that Blomqvist was set up, he has no option but to serve his sentence, deferred for six months. Unable to work for his paper, he is hired by Henrik Vanger, the paterfamilias of a powerful, clannish, but extremely dysfunctional family of industrialists, most of whom live on a private island. Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, vanished forty years before, and no one has been able to trace her whereabouts. Vanger is convinced that Harriet was murdered, more than likely by a member of the family.Mikael begins to investigate. In the process, he allies himself with Lisbeth. Although most of the Vangers try to dissuade the pair from accomplishing anything substantive, it quickly becomes evident that the Vanger clan is riddled with rot and evil, including membership in the Swedish Nazi Party and a fearful history of domestic abuse and violence, culminating in what appears to be a number of unsolved serial murders.The violence and darkness of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is indisputable and graphic, but it is not gratuitous. This is not a ""slasher"" film, it is a profound psychodrama and pursuit thriller. It is definitely not family fare, not for the young and impressionable, or for the faint of heart nor the easily distraught, but there is nothing dishonest or excessive about its portrayals.Many reviewers have criticized the film's expressed violence toward women, but such violence is an all-too terrible fact of life in many quarters. The women, too, are not simply victims. Lisbeth, as the eponymous Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, is an unconventional but powerful character, portrayed powerfully, and the other female roles in the film are likewise portrayals of strong women. If anything, the men in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO are the weaker, less competent, less emotionally, intellectually and psychologically stable sex.This film is not for everybody. However, if you are a cinemaphile, it is an experience that should not be missed.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***Having since seen the Director's Cut of the trilogy (which adds a full two-and-a-half hours, the equivalent of an entire movie, to the tale of Lisbeth Salander), I will recommend the Director's cut wholeheartedly.

I guess most reviewers here have read the book and would love the movie no matter what, but as one new to the story, I found it laughably implausible and silly: does every family have a Nazi sadist hidden in the attic? It would seem so, along with the ubiquitous corporate villainy and working class hero(es) to thwart them all and save the day.The two leads are good, but the early very sadistic rape scenes were to my mind unnecessary, just another cheesy rape/revenge set-up that so many lazy writers use to create ""suspense"" and ""resolution"" and ""redemption"". We've seen this all before, and in 90 minutes. This girl can just hack into anything? Frankly, the whole thing feels like it was tailor-made to exploit the market of women who've been molested and want vicarious revenge.

It's a very good thriller, but it's not one of my favorite movies that I will watch over and over again. These are the reasons:My first impression after the movie was over was that I don't want to go to Sweden. Perhaps not to be taken literally, the scenes in the movie made me feel that Sweden is filled with perverts and fathers who rape their daughters, and corrupted probation officers. (How can they get away with their crimes so easily that a woman has to resort to her own means for revenge?)Though it was great that Lisbeth was able to get revenge for what her guardian did to her, what she had to go through was hair-raising. I don't understand why, as someone so skilled in technology, she couldn't do something smarter to get her evidence. For example, she can bring some type of beeper, beep a friend when she was in trouble and let the police stop the man mid-action. Wouldn't that be enough? And, what was she thinking going to the man's house after dark? It seems like an invitation for trouble.The relationship between the two protagonists is also strange, and maybe it's because I didn't read the book, but a good movie adaptation should still clearly convey such an important relationship. I really don't get what's going on between them, and it seems like the only reason she liked him is that he was the first decent man she met? Even though he is way older than her, which I don't have a problem with, I just don't see the chemistry between them or a good reason why they liked each other.I also agree with another reviewer that the ending is surprisingly cold.It is a very good movie, overall, otherwise I wouldn't be writing a review for it. It seems to be a cult favorite though but I think my biggest problem with it is that I don't connect with Lisbeth. The movie is not for the faint of heart.

Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are perfectly cast as Lisbeth and Blomkvist. They've had to ditch a lot of detail, and compress a lot of the action, of course, but that takes nothing away from the suspense of the original story. The supporting characters at Millenium, Blomqvist's left wing magazine, are given short shrift, so if you want background info on his life, you'll have to read the book. But Lisbeth is the quintessential victim turned avenger; she's a computer genius who's actually made me wish I could be a hacker half as good as she is. But as for the rest of her young life - it's been a nightmare, and it's no stretch to understand how she got where she is. The theme of this thriller revolves around the violence that men do to women and girls, and the governmental bureaucracy that, inadvertently - or not - allows it. Blomqvist is the archetypal champion of human rights, the journalist dedicated to exposing corruption wherever it rears its head, and he and Lisbeth play off each others' strengths and motivations.This is a film that carries enormous cultural significance, and it's difficult to imagine that American film makers can improve upon the Swedish version.

I was lucky and know it.This older film (not old at all in truth) is so much less like an IKEA ad or music video (which was what I was left with after viewing the newer English language version, as admirable as it was and as good as the casting was).I feel that this first film should have been ENOUGH and did not need to be re-done simply because English-speakers don't like to read or see foreign films.  The rest of the world does it all of the time.  What narcissism.  It's embarassing.  In that vein, the subtitles are concise and easy to follow.  The translations capture the feeling of the book and the film perfectly.  There is not a struggle to follow the plot.  Hearing the original language is a gift, not a punishment.  Language immersion seems uncomfortable for some but it is like tasting foreign food.  The place becomes more real.This is gritty--full of mixes of ice and steel as well as warmth.  Qualities that come to mind are a balanced list: trendy, passionate, frightening, but also mundane, bureaucratic, etc.  Most importantly: the film is far more than the sum of its visuals.  This film isn't as long as the newer version and yet following the various threads & situations in the story is better done (more comprehensible, thorough, and better-paced).  The book which is rather dry (at least in its translation into English) is made more than vivid.

1343432,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B003FBNJ4U,Logan Stewart,"[0, 2]","Unless you've been hiding out under a rock, you've probably heard of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, written by the late Swedish journo-novelist Stieg Larsson.  The conclusion to the book trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, just came out earlier this year.  All three novels are international sensations, and I admit, I bought a copy of the opening number to see what all the fuss was about.  But, as it goes, I never got to read it, and now I'm not sure if I ever will.In 2009, a Swedish version of the movie was released.  Like its source material, the film received excellent reviews.  Performance-wise, Michael Nyqvist (Mikael) and Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth) both acted their characters perfectly, so I've read.  The tone of the movie was on par with the book, and all around it's grossed loads of money, if you want to measure success that way.  Knowing that Hollywood would be releasing a (likely dreaded) adaptation soon, I decided to rent the foreign film and watch it on Friday night.  (The movie is in Swedish, but subtitled in English.)The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a layered story.  Chiefly, journalist Mikael, recently indicted on several accounts of libel, is contacted by the wealthy entrepreneur Henrik Vanger.  Forty years ago, Henrik's niece, Harriet, vanished, and ever since then Henrik's obsessed over her disappearance.  He hires Mikael to try and uncover what happened to her.  Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander, a modern-day punk with a troubled past, has been hired to hack into Mikael's computer and keep track of him.  Eventually the two's paths cross and from there the film evolves.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo 2 This summary is a rough review at best.  There are several things going on throughout the movie, and the disappearance of Harriet Vanger takes the back burner.  The list of suspects is large, and the film takes time to investigate most.  In America, this stuff would largely be overlooked, I think.  Hollywood seems too bent on churning out action and memorable climaxes that not enough time is spent on the rising action.  In Sweden's movie industry, at least with this film, this is not the case.  The plot slowly unravels, inviting the viewer to learn more about the protagonists and their lives.  The whole time I was wondering what happened to Lisbeth in her past?  Is Mikael as ""good"" as he's portrayed?  Characterization is truly the main driving force behind the movie.Lisbeth is a highly fascinating character.  Immediately you can tell she's got something going on with her.  She comes across as cold and uncaring to nearly everyone.  She's obviously smart, being her career choice, but how smart?  She's a character with a past that's strongly affecting her every action, and I was interested to explore her more.  Add Mikael to the mix, who's a bit more open to conversation, and dynamic between the two is amusing.Stylistically, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a dark film.  Part of this comes from Lisbeth's wardrobe.  Part from the cold, deadly grip of Sweden's winter.  Most of it's from the darkness that's becoming more apparent as each minute ticks by.  Incredible acts of violence, some very graphic, and you can't help but feel a pang in your gut.  By the end of the movie, I remarked how sick and disgusting some things were, and Keisha agreed.  Yet, despite this grisly nature, the movie is great.  The real world is not peaches and sunshine.  It's not hard to imagine every dark action taking place outside of the film, and it's a tragedy that such things happen in our world.  The movie is graphic, as I've said, and borderline Realistic, but that culminates in making the film even better.After watching The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I can't help but wonder how the final two books pan out.  What's in store for the two fascinating protagonists?  Furthermore, I wonder now if it's even worth reading the book after watching the film.  What was omitted?  Would a Wikipedia summary suffice?  I'm not sure, and if any of you could tell me, let me know.  Overall, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was an exceptional movie, filled with mystery, tension, and unforgettable characters.  It's dark, but in my opinion there's enough light shining through the shadow to make it worth your while.

It is a Swedish film with subtitles but don't let that put you off.  The film immediately catches your attention when Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) enters the room.  She is a young punk who has been hired to work with Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) a investigative journalist who just lost a libel case against a corrupt Swedish CEO.  Blomkvist was hired by Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) an elderly CEO of a group of the Vanger Corporation.  Henrik wants the murderer of his niece, Harriet Vanger, caught.  She disappeared from a family gathering forty years ago on the island owned and inhabited by the Vanger relatives.  Her body was never found, but her Uncle wants the killer found, and he is sure it is a member of the dysfunctional Vanger family.The odd couple detectives, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander work well together.  Lisbeth is a genius in computers and hacking into sites.  Mikael has good analytical skills and slowly finds new clues that Lisbeth follows up on.  The couple link Harriet's disappearance to a number of gory murders from forty years ago and open a Pandora's box of suspects and torture.This movie is a must see, though be aware it is gory and a bit longer than the average movie - almost three hours.",4,Must See Swedish Thriller -,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1346,"['Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'author', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'Swedish', 'film', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'immediately', 'attention', 'when', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'room', 'young', 'punk', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'work', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'libel', 'case', 'corrupt', 'Swedish', 'CEO', 'Blomkvist', 'was', 'hired', 'Henrik', 'Vanger', 'Sven-Bertil', 'Taube', 'elderly', 'CEO', 'group', 'Vanger', 'Corporation', 'Henrik', 'murderer', 'niece', 'Harriet', 'Vanger', 'caught', 'disappeared', 'family', 'gathering', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'island', 'owned', 'inhabited', 'Vanger', 'relatives', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'Uncle', 'killer', 'found', 'sure', 'member', 'dysfunctional', 'Vanger', 'family.The', 'odd', 'couple', 'detectives', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'Lisbeth', 'genius', 'computers', 'hacking', 'sites', 'Mikael', 'good', 'analytical', 'skills', 'slowly', 'new', 'clues', 'Lisbeth', 'up', 'couple', 'link', 'Harriet', 'disappearance', 'number', 'gory', 'murders', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'open', 'Pandora', 'box', 'suspects', 'torture.This', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'though', 'be', 'aware', 'gory', 'bit', 'longer', 'average', 'movie', 'almost', 'three', 'hours']",N/A

FURTHERMORE, what really bugged me was the utter lack of character depth, there was no real emotional ties to the characters... like ur an indifferent third party, when in the book ur truely cheering for them. also being that im dutch and the nature of european culture is much more open, especially twords sex, i was dissapointed that the brutality of the novel wasnt nearly as upsetting and shocking as it should have been, nore was the violence, it was ALL WATERED DOWN, TOTALLY WATERED DOWN IN ALL ACCOUNTS, A TERRIBLE LETDOWN JUST TERRIBLE. i know they all cant be jack  in one flew over the coo coo's nest, but thats a prime example of character depth and emotional connection that u should get. again there is only one jack, and one coo coo's nest, but this was just a awfull god awfull movie. didnt live up to ANY of the hopes, no character development, no character authenticity, zero vividness to plot and horrid context, establishing the need to victory and emotion, and lastly this movie was way way too long it was BORING unlike the book which u didnt want to put down, i read the book in three days.. and i fell asleep watching this, literally i had to watch it twice and that just annoyed me more, re-visiting my initial assumptions and realizations of failure..............im sure the directors in hollywood currently working on this project will at least get it right in two major ways, 1) casting= characters will have the appeal they had in the novel and 2) they wont drag it out.",1,awfull just awfull,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,2041,"['i', 'read', 'book', 'i', 'was', 'terribly', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'first', 'characters', 'werent', 'depicted', 'right', 'whatsoever', 'reviewed', 'said', 'were', 'are', 'idiots', 'main', 'character', 'sex', 'appeal', 'attempts', 'dilute', 'taboo', 'appearence', 'film', 'honestly', 'hermy', 'almost', 'repulsive', 'blomkvist', 'bond', 'journalist', 'middle', 'aged', 'attractive', 'active', 'very', 'well', 'practiced', 'women', 'movie', 'ugly', 'pit', 'faced', 'where', 'shape', 'physic', 'depicted', 'novel', 'FURTHERMORE', 'what', 'really', 'bugged', 'was', 'utter', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'was', 'real', 'emotional', 'ties', 'characters', 'indifferent', 'third', 'party', 'when', 'book', 'ur', 'truely', 'cheering', 'also', 'being', 'im', 'dutch', 'nature', 'european', 'culture', 'much', 'more', 'open', 'especially', 'twords', 'sex', 'i', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'brutality', 'novel', 'wasnt', 'nearly', 'upsetting', 'shocking', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nore', 'was', 'violence', 'was', 'ALL', 'WATERED', 'DOWN', 'TOTALLY', 'WATERED', 'DOWN', 'IN', 'ALL', 'ACCOUNTS', 'A', 'TERRIBLE', 'LETDOWN', 'JUST', 'TERRIBLE', 'i', 'know', 'cant', 'be', 'jack', 'one', 'flew', 'coo', 'coo', 'nest', 'prime', 'example', 'character', 'depth', 'emotional', 'connection', 'u', 'should', 'get', 'again', 'only', 'one', 'jack', 'one', 'coo', 'coo', 'nest', 'was', 'just', 'awfull', 'god', 'awfull', 'movie', 'didnt', 'live', 'up', 'ANY', 'hopes', 'character', 'development', 'character', 'authenticity', 'zero', 'vividness', 'plot', 'horrid', 'context', 'establishing', 'need', 'victory', 'emotion', 'lastly', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'BORING', 'book', 'u', 'didnt', 'want', 'put', 'down', 'i', 'read', 'book', 'three', 'days..', 'i', 'fell', 'asleep', 'watching', 'literally', 'i', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'just', 'annoyed', 'more', 're-visiting', 'initial', 'assumptions', 'realizations', 'failure', '..im', 'sure', 'directors', 'hollywood', 'currently', 'working', 'project', 'will', 'least', 'get', 'right', 'two', 'major', 'ways', '1', 'casting=', 'characters', 'will', 'have', 'appeal', 'had', 'novel', '2', 'wont', 'drag', 'out']",N/A
1343440,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B003FBNJ4U,Margaux Paschke,"[2, 3]","This movie is the first in the trilogy based on the novels by Stieg Larsson.  It is the original movie, in Swedish with subtitles, directed by Niels Arden Oplev.  It runs 2.5 hours but the film flies by as it keeps you glued to the screen.  This film does not do the book justice but what movie version does?  If you liked the movie, I highly recommend the book with the same titleThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Those who read the book first might be disappointed with the male lead (the US version with Craig Daniels is much closer to the mark) as he is suppose to be a heartthrob but it's a matter of personal taste.The two actors who play the lead characters Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) and Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) remain through the film trilogy which is nice.  All three original Swedish movies are available and although they might be hard to find, are worth it.  There are three versions of this film: (1) 142 minutes (released in the UK); (2) 153 minutes (this film); and the extended version of 180 minutes.  I think the extended version is only available in Swedish and I have no idea what the differences are between them.  The series has become such a hit that an American version is in the works for a 2012 release.Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth exactly as I pictured when reading the novel.  There is no Hollywood casting here and the movie shines brighter for it.  I will not summarize the plot in fear of giving too much away except to note that the original Swedish title ""Men Who Hate Women"" is very fitting.  This movie is emotionally visceral as we are forced to watch Lisbeth being debased by her new parole officer.  Although this movie contains graphic images of brutal murders and adult subject matter, it was necessary in telling this very compelling story.It centers around Blomkvist, a journalist, who is trying to solve a 40 year murder case involving a very rich and influential Swedish family.  Dark family secrets involving ties to the Nazi party were always whispered about but Blomkvist uncovers more then the family bargained for as he searches for the truth with the help of Lisbeth.  The results are edge of your seat moments until the viewer sits back in horror when the truth is discovered.  I had a slight problem with their prime suspect being a young man who was too fuzzy in a photo to identify and when the resulting suspect did not fit the criteria, it took Blomkvist too long to catch on.The true star of this film is the character of Lisbeth.  She is mysterious and intriguing.  This movie contains the perfect intro to the next in the series - The Girl Who Played with Fire.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great thriller.",5,AMAZING FILM,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,2704,"['movie', 'first', 'trilogy', 'based', 'novels', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'original', 'movie', 'Swedish', 'subtitles', 'directed', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', '2.5', 'hours', 'film', 'flies', 'glued', 'screen', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'what', 'movie', 'version', 'liked', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'book', 'same', 'titleThe', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'male', 'lead', 'US', 'version', 'Craig', 'Daniels', 'much', 'closer', 'mark', 'suppose', 'be', 'heartthrob', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste.The', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'lead', 'characters', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'remain', 'film', 'trilogy', 'nice', 'three', 'original', 'Swedish', 'movies', 'are', 'available', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'are', 'worth', 'are', 'three', 'versions', 'film', '1', '142', 'minutes', 'released', 'UK', '2', '153', 'minutes', 'film', 'extended', 'version', '180', 'minutes', 'think', 'extended', 'version', 'only', 'available', 'Swedish', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'differences', 'are', 'series', 'become', 'hit', 'American', 'version', 'works', '2012', 'release.Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Lisbeth', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'when', 'reading', 'novel', 'Hollywood', 'casting', 'here', 'movie', 'shines', 'brighter', 'will', 'not', 'summarize', 'plot', 'fear', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'note', 'original', 'Swedish', 'title', 'Men', 'Who', 'Hate', 'Women', 'very', 'fitting', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'visceral', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'Lisbeth', 'being', 'debased', 'new', 'parole', 'officer', 'movie', 'graphic', 'images', 'brutal', 'murders', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'necessary', 'telling', 'very', 'compelling', 'story.It', 'centers', 'Blomkvist', 'journalist', 'who', 'trying', 'solve', '40', 'year', 'murder', 'case', 'involving', 'very', 'rich', 'influential', 'Swedish', 'family', 'Dark', 'family', 'secrets', 'involving', 'ties', 'Nazi', 'party', 'were', 'always', 'whispered', 'Blomkvist', 'uncovers', 'more', 'then', 'family', 'bargained', 'truth', 'help', 'Lisbeth', 'results', 'are', 'edge', 'seat', 'moments', 'viewer', 'back', 'horror', 'when', 'truth', 'discovered', 'had', 'slight', 'problem', 'prime', 'suspect', 'being', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'fuzzy', 'photo', 'identify', 'when', 'resulting', 'suspect', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'criteria', 'took', 'Blomkvist', 'too', 'long', 'catch', 'on.The', 'true', 'star', 'film', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'mysterious', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'perfect', 'intro', 'next', 'series', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Played', 'Fire', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'thriller']",N/A

1343448,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B003FBNJ4U,Mary Whipple,"[51, 55]","Over 2.5 million people in Scandinavia have seen this film, making it the first film in Scandinavian history ever to break the $100 million mark for European ticket sales, and US fans of Stieg Larsson's bestseller of the same name may propel the film to similar records here.  The R-rated film tells the story of Mikael Blomqvist, a disgraced journalist for Sweden's Millenium magazine who accepts an invitation from an elderly businessman to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet, thirty-seven years ago. No trace of her has ever turned up, and the old man fears that a member of his family may have murdered her.  While Blomquist is gathering information and storing it on his computer, he realizes that someone is hacking into his files.  That person is Lizbeth Salander, a disturbed young woman living under the guardianship of the state, having spent time in a mental institution.  Working together, they discover information about the Vanger family's Nazi connections and their association with extreme religious groups.Danish director Niels Arden Oplev's dark and atmospheric cinematography establishes an ice-cold mood from the outset, with the action taking place in winter on an isolated island where the sun never seems to shine.  Outdoor scenes are mostly black, white, and gray;  interior scenes are full of clutter and of dark wood of almost claustrophobic heaviness.  Michael Nyqvist (as Mikael Blomqvist) conveys the sense of loss, even betrayal, that his character feels after losing a libel case in a miscarriage of justice, and his vulnerability makes him the perfect foil for Noomi Rapace (as Lizbeth Salander).  Rapace conveys not only the toughness and emotional dissociation resulting from abuse Lizbeth has faced, but also, in two memorable scenes, the feeling that behind the seemingly ironclad faade, there beats a real heart.  Her role in the film is bigger than it is in the novel, and when she is on screen, it is impossible to look at anyone else.  Nyqvist seems to recognize this, conveying Blomqvist's support for her through body language, gesture, and facial expressions, and remaining more in the background.  The supporting actors, though their parts are far less developed, are equally committed to the film as a whole.Brilliant pacing keeps the action and its shocks continuing throughout the film, and not a single ""dead spot"" appears, an extraordinary feat for a film that is more than two-and-a-half hours long and depends upon subtitles for dialogue.  Even people familiar with the book will be jolted by the sudden visual shocks as they hit.  Horrifying scenes of physical and sexual violence often make the film very difficult to watch, the sounds of the violence making the visual effects even stronger.  There are some scenes of nudity.Every aspect of this film is integrated into the whole, however, and it is difficult to imagine any adult fan of the book being disappointed in this production.  The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the remaining two books in the trilogy, have already been filmed and released to huge audiences in Europe, and both of these films are projected for release in the US (with subtitles) in the fall of 2010.

Combining the mood of ""Silence of the Lambs"" with the best elements of ""Blow Up"", Director Niels Arden Oprev has fashioned an unforgetable film.Convicted of libel, jounalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist who handles the role brilliantly) is hired by retired CEO Martin Vanger (Peter Haber) to find out the fate of his niece, who went missing 40 years ago, Vanger is convinced his niece was murdered. With his jail sentence looming in six months, Mikael moves to the island where the incident took place and begins his investigation. He is soon joined by a crack computer hacker Lisabeth Salander (Noomi Rapace in a spellbinding, career making performance) and together find a pattern of killings that lead to a brilliant finale.Based on the late Stieg Larsson's first effort of his ""Millenium"" series, this work is not for the faint of heart nor the kiddies as it includes sex, nudity, graphic violence and a devestating rape scene. All the plot lines are wonderfully sewn together and the quick pace makes the two & and half hour film seem far too short.The DVD itself contains a few extras, including an interview with Noomi Rapace. The original theatrical trailer, the Vanger ""family tree"" with print so tiny it would be difficult to read on a small tv screen, and a trailer for the upcoming second film of the trilogy, ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"". All in all, not very impressive.I heartily endorse this film for those who enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"" and films of that ilk.

Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist that was set up for a crime. After being found guilty, he is contacted by the former head of the Vanger family to solve the mystery of his niece's death in the 1960's.Lisbeth is a hacker working for a security company. She was responsible for investigating  Mikael Blomkvist, and doesn't sever her ties to his computer when she is finished.Together, they try to solve the mystery of Harriet's murder and uncover a series of violent murders that may be related to her death.ReviewI attempted to read the novel this movie was based on, however, I found the book to be very slow going and eventually gave up. While at times the pace of the movie echoes the book, the development of the case still keeps you involved. The original name of the book was ""Men Who Hate Women"" which, while less attention grabbing than the current title is certainly accurate. This movie is dark, graphic, and intense. There are scenes of graphic rape and violent crimes. Not to mention, the movie is long.I really liked the character of Lisbeth. She is vibrant, mysterious, and aggressive. Physically, most of her femininity is gone, but she is a Valkyrie at heart. Mikael seems to be more of a foil to Lisbeth than a developed character. He is more of a faceless ""good guy"" than an actual person.Overall, the movie was different than I expected, in a more violent rape kind of way. It actually makes me want to read the rest of the series, if not watch the movies.My RecommendationWhile I'm not entirely sure if I liked the movie, I liked that it made me think. Parts of it certainly made me uncomfortable. I don't recommend this for anyone under 18, even then, I would still think about if you really want to see it.  3/5 - Rent it/ Borrow it",3,An Intense Experience,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1817,"['SynopsisTwo', 'story', 'lines', 'mingle', 'Swedish', 'cold', 'case', 'movie', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'journalist', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'crime', 'being', 'found', 'guilty', 'contacted', 'former', 'head', 'Vanger', 'family', 'solve', 'mystery', 'niece', 'death', ""1960's.Lisbeth"", 'hacker', 'working', 'security', 'company', 'was', 'responsible', 'investigating', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', ""n't"", 'sever', 'ties', 'computer', 'when', 'finished.Together', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Harriet', 'murder', 'uncover', 'series', 'violent', 'murders', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'death.ReviewI', 'attempted', 'read', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'however', 'found', 'book', 'be', 'very', 'slow', 'going', 'eventually', 'gave', 'up', 'times', 'pace', 'movie', 'book', 'development', 'case', 'still', 'involved', 'original', 'name', 'book', 'was', 'Men', 'Who', 'Hate', 'Women', 'less', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'current', 'title', 'certainly', 'accurate', 'movie', 'dark', 'graphic', 'intense', 'are', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'rape', 'violent', 'crimes', 'Not', 'mention', 'movie', 'long.I', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'vibrant', 'mysterious', 'aggressive', 'Physically', 'most', 'femininity', 'gone', 'Valkyrie', 'heart', 'Mikael', 'be', 'more', 'foil', 'Lisbeth', 'developed', 'character', 'more', 'faceless', 'good', 'guy', 'actual', 'person.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'expected', 'more', 'violent', 'rape', 'kind', 'way', 'actually', 'want', 'read', 'rest', 'series', 'not', 'watch', 'movies.My', 'RecommendationWhile', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'liked', 'movie', 'liked', 'made', 'think', 'Parts', 'certainly', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', '18', 'even', 'then', 'would', 'still', 'think', 'really', 'want', 'see', '3/5', 'Rent', 'it/', 'Borrow']",N/A

The casting is perfect, the acting is superb, and although several elements of the book were altered for the film, it really stays true to the heart of the story. None of the disturbing and violent aspects of the book were toned down for the movie, which surprised and pleased me. The only mild complaint I have is that because so much material from the book obviously needed to be cut for the 2.5 hour film, many of the characters barely get any screen time. For example, I think Erika only appears briefly in two scenes, and her relationship with Mikael isn't even acknowledged in the film, which is a huge disappointment. Also, many members of the Vanger family, including Martin and Isabella, only appear very briefly in the film. While I understand the need for it to be that way in order to keep the movie at an average length, it does detract from the whole mystery of the Vanger family and doesn't give the audience much of an opportunity to analyze the suspects in detail.

As well, they perceived a right-wing authoritarian bias in society and in politics.Larsson senses a similar malaise, but he specifically sees the wealthy and the powerful committing whatever crimes they please and pretty well getting away with it.  He is also concerned with what he sees as a vicious misogynistic streak in society - the original Swedish title translates as ""Men Who Hate Women"", and the plot turns around a previously-unrecognised string of sex murders going back to 1949.  There is also a truly despicable government bureaucrat who uses his position to sadistically abuse women over whom he has been given power.Excellent film.

Now after seeing the movie, I've been raving to everyone about how great the movie is.Noomi Rapace almost exactly matches how I saw Lisbeth Salander as I read the book. On the other hand, it took me  awhile to warm up to Michael Nyqvist as the journalist Blomkvist, but he finally won me over with his very subtle performance (watch his eyes).While the movie does change a few of the details, all of the important plot elements are there. If I have any disappointment at all it would be with the last few minutes of the movie which gloss over some really significant (and fascinating) parts of the book related to how Salander uses her hacking skills to help outsmart one of the bad guys (and empty one of his bank accounts). I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the book and would have liked to see more of it in the movie. Some reviewers have complained that the ending went on and on, but I don't agree at all. The ending of this movie sets up the next one which will be out summer 2010 -- ""The Girl Who Played With Fire.""The settings and cinematography of ""Tattoo"" are a little dark and gloomy but fit the story perfectly. In fact, in looking back on the movie, I had to really think to remember if it was filmed in black and white or in color. It's in color but there's not much of it. As a result, when color is used, it's a very effective tool in making something really stand out.Keep in mind when you're deciding whether to see this movie that the title in Sweden is ""Men Who Hate Women"" and so there's some pretty tough to watch scenes. I thought that the director handled these very well -- just enough to get the point across but not so much that he seemed to be exploiting it in order to appeal to people's purient interests.All-in-all it's worth reading the subtitles for 2-1/2 hours.

1343468,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B003FBNJ4U,moviemusicbuff,"[6, 6]","I was blown away by Niel Arden Oplev's film adaptation of Larsson's book, and especially intrigued by the character of Lisbeth Salander.  As Roger Ebert commented in his recent movie review, the character of Lisbeth Salander, is more fascinating & interesting than the story itself.  Salander is an extremely intelligent and resourceful young woman who possesses exceptional capabilities and displays a fierce determination to bring men who abuse women to justice.  As a deeply wounded person who was the victim of rape and violence, she finds it very difficult to express herself in words but she communicates by action.  The partnership that Lisbeth has with Mikael Blomkvist is a very interesting relationship -- both are forced into this relationship, they learn to respect and care for each other but are afraid to express their emotions openly.The story line involves Mikael Blomkvist, the reporter of the Millennium magazine, and Lisbeth Salander, the intelligent & antisocial researcher hired by Milton Security, teaming up to find out what happened to Harriet Vanger, beloved niece of the billionaire Henrik Vanger, who vanished in 1966.  Henrik Vanger hires Blomkvist and later on, Blomkvist enlists the help of Salander, to investigate the large Vanger family and to find out the truth of what happened to Harriet and who or what is responsible for her disappearance.Much of the success of this movie goes to the gifted director Niels Arden Oplev, who initially turned down the project but who was convinced later on by the producer Soren Staermose to do the project on condition that he was given complete artistic control over cast, script, length, editing, etc.  His artistic style shows in every aspect of the movie.  The characters come to life, there is visual poetry as Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkist do the research on the Vanger family tree and the clues begin to emerge.  The pacing of the movie is excellent and the movie builds to a satisfying climax and resolution.Much credit goes to the outstanding actress Noomi Rapace for embodying and bringing the Salander character to life in this excellent first film adaptation.  One of the wonderful special features in this DVD is the extensive interview with Noomi Rapace where she discusses how she was able to transform herself to play and embody the Salander character, how she figured out how to play Lisbeth, what life was like in the 1 1/2 years she spent in playing the role in the Trilogy, and how she felt about playing the character.  The Special Features also provide a preview of The Girl Who Played With Fire, and a diagram of the Vanger Family Tree.As I watched this movie, I felt that it was a Swedish equivalent of the American thriller, ""The Silence of the Lambs"", which came out 11 years ago.  Both films feature a gifted female protagonist with a wounded past who is extremely intelligent and gifted; both of these women solve a complicated  mystery that involves a vicious killer.

This is a Swedish movie, and has subtitles, so if you're not someone who likes them, then you may want to pass this one up, but you'd be missing out on a real great, ""who-done-it"".  Numerous taboo issues are also addressed, often very graphically and violently....such as incest and rape.The movie starts out with a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, in court for writing a story that was later proven false.  He will have to spend time in jail.  A computer hacker, Lisbeth, hired by a company to investigate Mikael, finds that he did no wrong doing and was pretty much set up to fall.  She seems to be fixated / sort of obsessed by Mikael, and hacks into his personal computer to see what he is working on / looking up.  Before his sentencing is to take place, Mikael gets hired by the head of a prominent wealthy family,  to investigate the murder of his beloved niece over 40 years ago.  This same niece used to babysit / take care of Mikael when he was a youngster, so this adds a personal edge to his investigation.Lisbeth has many personal demons, ( childhood rape, murder, Horrible new predator guardian that she eventually mets justice to )  yet because of her skill with figuring out / seeing patterns, and working her way around a computer, she sends a semi anonymous email to Mikael, with a major clue to his investigation of the niece / babysitter.  He eventually tracks her down, and together they solve a mystery that has ties to Hitler, greed, and a warped interpreting  of  the Bible.  Justice is met, and you may find yourself rooting for Lisbeth and her vigilante methods, because you have seen what she has been through, and that she is not going to allow another innocent female to go through the same pain.",5,Enthralling Movie,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,1909,"['having', 'read', 'numerous', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'hype', 'was', 'about', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Swedish', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'so', ""'re"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'one', 'up', ""'d"", 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'real', 'great', 'who-done-it', 'Numerous', 'taboo', 'issues', 'are', 'also', 'addressed', 'often', 'very', 'graphically', 'violently', '.such', 'incest', 'rape.The', 'movie', 'out', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'court', 'writing', 'story', 'was', 'later', 'proven', 'false', 'will', 'have', 'spend', 'time', 'jail', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Lisbeth', 'hired', 'company', 'investigate', 'Mikael', 'did', 'wrong', 'doing', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'set', 'up', 'fall', 'be', 'fixated', '/', 'sort', 'obsessed', 'Mikael', 'hacks', 'personal', 'computer', 'see', 'what', 'working', '/', 'looking', 'up', 'sentencing', 'take', 'place', 'Mikael', 'hired', 'head', 'prominent', 'wealthy', 'family', 'investigate', 'murder', 'beloved', 'niece', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'same', 'niece', 'used', 'babysit', '/', 'take', 'care', 'Mikael', 'when', 'was', 'youngster', 'personal', 'edge', 'investigation.Lisbeth', 'many', 'personal', 'demons', 'childhood', 'rape', 'murder', 'Horrible', 'new', 'predator', 'guardian', 'eventually', 'justice', 'yet', 'skill', 'figuring', 'out', '/', 'seeing', 'patterns', 'working', 'way', 'computer', 'semi', 'anonymous', 'email', 'Mikael', 'major', 'clue', 'investigation', 'niece', '/', 'babysitter', 'eventually', 'down', 'together', 'solve', 'mystery', 'ties', 'Hitler', 'greed', 'warped', 'interpreting', 'Bible', 'Justice', 'met', 'may', 'find', 'rooting', 'Lisbeth', 'vigilante', 'methods', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'been', 'not', 'going', 'allow', 'innocent', 'female', 'go', 'same', 'pain']",N/A

THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, however, is a rare exception as it is a perfect adaptation. Both the cast and the scenery was very close to the imagery the late Stieg Larsson created in my mind while I was reading his masterpiece. And the story follows the book plot with faithful reverence.Having said that, even if one missed on the book this is a powerful and very entertaining movie on its own.The movie is in Swedish (as it should) and if, like me, not fluent in the language, one has to use subtitles. I prefer this kind of translation to dubbing as I find it more respectful of the artists' original vision and craft. German and French (to to mention American) audiences, to name but a few, have been addicted to hearing their own language. This convenience, although it can work for most blockbusters, it rubs off all the subtle details that give rise to a masterpiece.Noomi Rapace simply IS Lisbeth Salander. The body-type, the attitude, the self-assured distrust towards the world. From the way she enters a room to the way she hits her computer keys she is possessed by Lisbeth's spirit.In this first installment of the Millennium Trilogy Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and his investigation form the center of gravity. No matter, the moment Lisbeth enters a scene she steals it away simply because there hasn't been such an original character for a long time. Nobody wants to cross THIS version of Pipi Longstockings!The story revolves around a locked-room/island mystery. An industrialist, Henrik Vanger, has life-long obsession with what really happened to his beloved niece, Harriet. Although  the Vagner family has no..shortage of bad apples, the mystery resisted to 40 years of thorough investigation by both the police and numerous private investigators. Blomkvist is persuaded to give it one last try not only by the substantial paycheck but also by the promise to be able to clear his name, tricked and convicted into libel as he had been.The Millennium Trilogy is Larsson's last gift to the world. And it starts with THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.The movie is strong and potent. It will stay with you for a long time.",5,A PERFECT ADAPTATION.

1343490,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B003FBNJ4U,Peter Baklava,"[0, 1]","""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" builds on the legacy of many previous popular movies.  It could be described as a composite of Agatha Christie mysteries, ""The DaVinci Code"", ""Hard Candy"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the serial killer movies in toto,  ""La Femme Nikita"", and maybe even ""Tank Girl""...but, to give credit where credit is due, it succeeds better than most of those predecessors.I believe the reasons for its success are good direction and a strong female lead performance by Noomi Rapace, who provides a stark counterbalance to the stuffiness of the other characters.  The locale of the movie provides a certain bracing freshness, with the beautiful Swedish countryside illuminated by cool blue hues and decorated with hoarfrost.The title character herself is a waifish, brilliantly paranoid creation--a comic book hero, an avenging female angel who answers any attack with a more ruthless, fierce comeback.

The barren winter landscape of Sweden serves as a metaphor for the cold and barren lives of most of the characters.

Or, more accurately, less bad than the book.  I read the book (actually listened to the unabridged audio version) a year ago while I commuted.  I hated it but kept on till the end just to pass the miles.  I never intended to see either of the two film versions.However, in the past year I saw the lead actor, Michael Nyquist in two other Swedish films and loved him...so when I saw that he was portraying Blomquist I thought I'd take a peek.  In my opinion he helped the film a lot by humanizing the lead character.  In the book, Blomquist was portrayed as a super-stud, who was so irrestable to women that many of them took their clothes off in his presence.  (I chalk this up to fantasizing on behalf of the writer who based Blomquist on himself.)  In the film Nyquist is much warmer, sweeter, more sensitive and actually made me care about him...enough to keep on watching.I liked the woman who played Lizbeth Salander, too, although I didn't relate to her at all in the book.  In the book, she's a one dimensional cartoon but in the film she manages to show some warmth and vulnerability behind the Goth and leather getup.  The original version of the film was Men who Hate Women and I think the change is much better.  This really is Lizbeth's film; she's the one we will remember.Other improvements:  some of Blomquist's sexual encounters with various women are left out, notably that with Berger, his boss at the magazine.  That was a relief!  Somehow the sexual assaults and various other crimes were less horrific here, although the film doesn't spare the sights.  Maybe it was because I knew what was coming, but also I think the book goes into much more details.I liked the relationwhip between Blomquist and Salander; I thought the film got it just right.  In the book it's much more about Berger, which is confusing.The story, itself, has possibilities.  Unfortunately much of it is beyond belief and way over the top in sensational garbage.

It was good for that reason, but there was so much left out that was in the book that I wondered how anyone could follow it.  I watched it with my sister who hadn't read the book and asked her if she could follow the plot and she said she could so I guess it wasn't that bad.  To be fair, there are only a few movies that I've seen that do what I'd consider a good job of sticking close to a book.What I did enjoy was seeing some of the places in Sweden where the action was to have taken place.  I understand that the town of Hedeby Island is a fictitious place but most of the other places mentioned in the book are real.  I thought they did a good job of casting the characters and I liked Noomi Rapace in her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander although she was a lot taller than the 4'11"" as described in the book. Blomkvist, played by Michael Nyqvist looked different than I had imagined him but I thought he did an excellent job of acting the part.  I wish Erika's character would have been more prominent in the movie, but I guess some things have to be left out in the interest of time.The movie is 152 minutes but to me it felt more like about 45 with so much action going on.

It's not a film I would have chosen to view but because it was free I thought I'd try it.  I was unsure if I would like this foreign film as it's distracting having to read sub-titles but the film grabbed me in the first few moments of viewing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the character development of the main characters.  The overall theme of the film was how broken and damaged most people are but how we have the ability to overcome our brokeness by helping someone else.

Before his jail time is to happen, he gets a letter from Henrik Vanger, the head of a wealthy family. A man of 80, his niece had disappeared 40 years ago and was never found. He writes to Mikael asking him to help solve her mystery, and in turn, will help him out with the pickle he's in. So he moves to Hedestad, an island 3 hours away from Stockholm to get started on his work.A tattooed and pierced computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander has been following Mikael's case for quite some time. Lisbeth has Aspergers (or some sort of autism). She's sexy, but she's troubled- she's had a troubled childhood being in and out of behavioural centres. However, fate, or so it seems, leads Mikael to Lisbeth, where they both work together to solve this amazing case.This very film is why we go to the movies. At 152 minutes, your interest is held. It is a long movie, but the length is the last thing on your mind when watching it. Dragon Tattoo manages to keep you entertained, it immerses you in these awesome characters. They become your friends for 2 and a half hours, and the whole time you feel like you're solving the mystery with them.This film is full of suspense, and for its entire duration I was on the edge of my seat. Michael Nyqvist is just GREAT as Mikael, and everyone else is great, but the real highlight is Noomi Rapace. She is one of the most gorgeous and talented actresses out there right now. It struck me how so different she is in real life too- in this movie, she just IS Lisbeth. She is more than just a pretty face, she is an amazing actress, and it's such a shame that there aren't many actresses like her nowadays.In short, do not miss this flick. Even if you don't like foreign movies, do see this film. It is one of the greatest movies I've had the good fortune to see at the cinema, and a film that just improves with repeat viewings.",5,Better than the book!,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,2161,"['Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'once', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'thriller', 'interesting', 'study', 'human', 'nature.A', 'writer', 'Sweden', 'number', 'one', 'magazine', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'Millennium', 'facing', 'hefty', 'fee', '150,000', 'kronor', 'sentence', 'time', 'jail', 'slander', 'libel', 'jail', 'time', 'happen', 'letter', 'Henrik', 'Vanger', 'head', 'wealthy', 'family', 'man', '80', 'niece', 'had', 'disappeared', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'Mikael', 'asking', 'help', 'solve', 'mystery', 'turn', 'will', 'help', 'out', 'pickle', 'Hedestad', 'island', '3', 'hours', 'away', 'Stockholm', 'get', 'started', 'work.A', 'tattooed', 'pierced', 'computer', 'hacker', 'named', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'been', 'following', 'Mikael', 'case', 'quite', 'time', 'Lisbeth', 'Aspergers', 'sort', 'autism', 'sexy', 'troubled-', 'had', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'being', 'behavioural', 'centres', 'However', 'fate', 'so', 'Mikael', 'Lisbeth', 'where', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'amazing', 'case.This', 'very', 'film', 'why', 'go', 'movies', '152', 'minutes', 'interest', 'held', 'long', 'movie', 'length', 'last', 'thing', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'keep', 'entertained', 'awesome', 'characters', 'become', 'friends', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'whole', 'time', 'feel', ""'re"", 'solving', 'mystery', 'them.This', 'film', 'full', 'suspense', 'entire', 'duration', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'just', 'GREAT', 'Mikael', 'everyone', 'else', 'great', 'real', 'highlight', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'actresses', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'struck', 'how', 'so', 'different', 'real', 'life', 'too-', 'movie', 'just', 'IS', 'Lisbeth', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'amazing', 'actress', 'such', 'shame', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'actresses', 'nowadays.In', 'short', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'flick', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'foreign', 'movies', 'do', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'see', 'cinema', 'film', 'just', 'repeat', 'viewings']",N/A

It seemed overlong and overstuffed, and the solutions to its mysteries were tacked on indiscriminately. There was no real mystery, just a series of ""revelations"" only vaguely related to what preceded them.  I thought the movie would be better because the visual element (involving the examination of old photographs) would be more effective in a movie than in a novel.  I also figured that the film would of necessity have to reduce some of the novel's clutter.  Well, I was right on the first count. The examination of photos is more effective here.  Unfortuately, however, the film leaves much too much stuffing in the turkey.  It's still long and cluttered, and the revelations at the end are as tacky as ever.  The big ""surprise"" at the end is as abvious as it was in the novel.  Don't worry: I won't spill the all-too-obvious beans.  In a way, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo"" might have been better without ""The Girl.""  At least then we would have been spared the dreary love story (if that's what it is) and all the irrlevant information about her dismal past.  I also have to say the suspense is old-fashioned and thrice-familiar. This is one of those movies where the villain confesses everything to the hero he is about to kill.

The business man hires Mikael to find out what happened to his niece that mysteriously disappeared forty years prior.

Rapace plays Lisbeth as a far more vulnerable and human character when compared to the cold, ethereal Roony version; she also does not make her the kind of lithesome sex kitten that Roony does, but is simply tough, gender ambiguous, and not all that pretty.  Blomkvist is also less heroic and more human (egoistic, ambitious, not so saintly if cause-driven), indeed he looks like a real person rather than the too-perfect Craig.

It has a couple plot holes, and it is a half hour too long, but it is good. It was made by intelligent adults for intelligent adults. Better than most Hollywood movies, I would say. It's not perfect, but the Lisbeth character is so strong, and the acting is so good, and the story is so compelling that this movie finally becomes unstoppable. I agree with Roger Ebert, for once, that the girl is better than the story. What a character. She's an underdog, and she's a fighter. The story is formulaic, but who cares? Lisbeth is to the year 2010 what Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe was to the 1930s. I saw this one at a theater and liked it so much I bought it from Amazon, and I watched it a second time and liked it even better. What a story. What good filmmaking. (Now I'm watching for the third time, and it isn't holding up so well. The first hour is pretty static, with the characters looking through archives and sitting at computers a lot. But the story is there. The filmmakers did a good job of boiling down an impossibly bloated, tedious novel into a much leaner thriller.

Mother is relegated to locked psychiatric institution, child is ward of the court. The guardian of the child controls her finances, imposing sexual acts on her in return for her living allowance.Lisbeth's photographic memory and computer hacking skills provide work in a detective agency uncovering information for a fee. One man she is asked to investigate is an investigative reporter framed into making false accusations against a powerful businessman.Mikael the journalist is condemned to prison. Lisbeth discovers he is innocent and reveals that to a client seeking an incorruptible investigator into the disappearance of his beloved niece 40 years ago. Henrik Vanger as head of the lucrative family business has no children of his own, and believes his favorite niece was murdered by one of his Nazi brothers or their children.Mikael lost his job as an investigative reporter so accepts the assignment to find the niece Harriet before he reports for his prison sentence. The young girl with the Dragon Tattoo Lisbeth watches Mikael's investigation progress by hacking into his computer files as he discovers the history of the missing niece Harriet.Lisbeth's focused intellect allows her to decipher codes Harriet had written in her Bible and diary, and sends an easily traceable email to Mikael providing him the information. Mikael asks her to join him on the hunt. His tender respectful treatment of traumatized 24 year old Lisbeth is not reciprocated; intercourse yes, information yes, emotional sharing or trust, no.The unraveling history of the Vanger family leads to attempts on Mikael's life, rescue by Lisbeth, and her farewell gift to Mikael in prison: a dossier of incriminating evidence on the businessman who framed him originally.Planting a seed of anger-cruelty in the world grows hatred laterally and down through the generations in the Vanger family. Self generated anger ricochets off others leaving all damaged in unpredictable ways.Mikael cannot imagine not offering compassion to the Nazi Vanger brother who plans to murder then disarticulate him for shark food because Mikael's own childhood was unblemished by horror. Not so Lisbeth who sees past the Bible quoting Vanger father who constantly raped his daughter Harriet and taught her brother to join in brutalizing her.Genuine caring is wanting what is best for the other even if you must sacrifice to ensure that outcome. Both Mikael and Lisbeth hold the other in high esteem and try to protect one another even at personal risk.Compassion is finding the heart to empathize with your own suffering and that of others, and try to find healing and forgiveness for the pain. Mikael begins the journey; Lisbeth is yet unable to move in that direction.Recovery is creating meaning in what is in this moment; not what could have been and is now lost. Mikael accepts what is; Lisbeth continues to manipulate her environment.Highly recommended.

Rather than Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who was the womanizer during his hiring by the Vanger Group to write a bio of the Vanger family as a front and then do the actual work of trying to solve a 40 year old murder case -- the disappearance of Harriet Vanger -- it was quite a different film!It's tough not to compare the book to the film but I'm glad to have watched the film regardless.  Gone is the womanizing, the affair with the married publisher of the magazine Millennium and gone is the cover story to write a bio of the Vanger family.The film is uneven at times.  The whole sexual predator guardian of Lisbeth (the girl with those tattoos) was faithful to the book.  The book though delved deep into her other guardian who helped her out at every turn.  The film skipped all that.Enough fat was cut from the book to make a smooth running mystery film without a lot of back story into the Vanger family, into Lisbeth's life or the sexual antics of Blomkvist.  At the time, the film was uneven and made enough changes to create a mildly disappointing adaptation.Hitchcock could take a mystery book and put his own twist to give an even better adaptation than the book would have fathomed.  On the other end of the scale, the director for Watchmen was too slavish in attempting to film every last panel of the graphic novel rather than cut out anything.In The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I would have liked more back story regarding the Millennium, the media's zealous hunt for a story, the commentary on financial markets and journalists -- and the extreme cleverness of Lisbeth.So much entertainment, but so much missing.

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[1, 1]","There are umpteen reviews of this movie so I won't further discuss  the plot in detail.This is a magnificent, richly detailed and emotionally moving film that offers a tremendous reward for those who stick with it and experience the climax. It's many related stories woven into one. This is not a movie to watch a bit at a time but rather, if you want to enjoy the emotion of the story,  you must be involved throughout the duration of the flickThere's a lot going on here. You have the woes of the title character, Lisbeth who is an abused ward of the State.You have an investigative trail pursued by a publicly defamed journalist, Michael. You have the reputation and exploits of Michael's small, investigative newspaper. You have debilitating secrets exposed of an aristocratic family and you have a fantastic disappearance mystery.The story is told in a slow moving yet highly absorbing manner. As the plot furthers, the mystery and eerie atmosphere steadily develops. The director does a very effective job by creating suspense through the prolonged use of old black and white photographs. During multiple times, there is simply the closeup of 40 year old portrait of the subject of the disappearance which is utilized in an effectively, spooky manner.This is a Swedish film with subtitles. The subtitles actually enhance the mysterious effect of the movie. It makes the viewer pay close attention to the dialog and excises any unwanted, unnecesary chatter. Part of the haunting charm of the movie involves the old world, European aura of many of the characters so the lack of English fosters this aspect perfectly (I cannot imagine this film being remade, which it is, by Hollywood, since I feel that taking away this ""European"" aura will take away what makes the film so interesting).Although there is action in the film, that is not what makes the film so good. The quality in the movie is not so much in the visual but rather in the quality of the story, the character development, and how it all resolves itself.This film gets better with repeated viewing since there is a lot to absorb. This is a fresh alternative to the mainstream.P.S. The other 2 films ""The Girl who played with Fire"" and ""The Girl who kicked the Hornets Nest"" are not merely sequels, they pick up EXACTLY where the preceding films end... although the three films are quite different from each other. To see one of the films before the other would be a mistake since each is predicated upon the earlier one. This film is a mystery, ""Fire"" acts as a ""James Bond"" like, spy piece and ""Hornets Nest"" is a courtroom drama. Each film is good but this first one is by far the best since it is quite an effective mystery.",4,A truly suspenseful and original movie,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2695,"['are', 'umpteen', 'reviews', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'further', 'discuss', 'plot', 'detail.This', 'magnificent', 'richly', 'detailed', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'film', 'tremendous', 'reward', 'who', 'stick', 'experience', 'climax', 'many', 'related', 'stories', 'woven', 'one', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'bit', 'time', 'rather', 'want', 'enjoy', 'emotion', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'involved', 'duration', 'flickThere', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'have', 'woes', 'title', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'who', 'abused', 'ward', 'State.You', 'have', 'investigative', 'trail', 'pursued', 'publicly', 'defamed', 'journalist', 'Michael', 'have', 'reputation', 'exploits', 'Michael', 'small', 'investigative', 'newspaper', 'have', 'debilitating', 'secrets', 'exposed', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'have', 'fantastic', 'disappearance', 'mystery.The', 'story', 'told', 'slow', 'moving', 'yet', 'highly', 'absorbing', 'manner', 'plot', 'furthers', 'mystery', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'steadily', 'director', 'very', 'effective', 'job', 'creating', 'suspense', 'prolonged', 'use', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'multiple', 'times', 'simply', 'closeup', '40', 'year', 'old', 'portrait', 'subject', 'disappearance', 'utilized', 'effectively', 'spooky', 'manner.This', 'Swedish', 'film', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'actually', 'enhance', 'mysterious', 'effect', 'movie', 'viewer', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'dialog', 'unwanted', 'unnecesary', 'chatter', 'Part', 'haunting', 'charm', 'movie', 'old', 'world', 'European', 'aura', 'many', 'characters', 'lack', 'English', 'fosters', 'aspect', 'perfectly', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'film', 'being', 'remade', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'taking', 'away', 'European', 'aura', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'interesting', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'quality', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'visual', 'rather', 'quality', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'how', 'itself.This', 'film', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'lot', 'absorb', 'fresh', 'alternative', 'mainstream.P.S', 'other', '2', 'films', 'Girl', 'who', 'played', 'Fire', 'Girl', 'who', 'kicked', 'Hornets', 'Nest', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'sequels', 'pick', 'up', 'EXACTLY', 'where', 'preceding', 'films', 'end', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'see', 'one', 'films', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'predicated', 'earlier', 'one', 'film', 'mystery', 'Fire', 'James', 'Bond', 'spy', 'piece', 'Hornets', 'Nest', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'film', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'far', 'best', 'quite', 'effective', 'mystery']",N/A

At the same time the lead female character Lisbeth Salander is a hero figure who refuses to play victim and pursues justice in an unjust society.Sometimes it is necessary for films to show graphic violence to make its point and have that emotional impact.  For example the Civil Rights movement was catupulted when Americans watched the news and were greeted with the horrific images of a sheriff grabbing an elderly black woman by the back of the neck and dragging her out of a voters registration line.  In this case the director had to be fictitiously graphic to have the same emotional impact.  Remember, the book in Sweden is called ""Men Who Hate Women""; it would have been a great injustice to the subject matter if the violence was tame; indeed the tameness could very well have come across as condoning this behavior.This film also knew when and where to be graphic; the difference was ""exploring"" an issue versus ""exploiting"" it.  I don't recall any graphic visuals of child molestation or the murder of the women victims.  Instead we were given certain images to suggest these horrors.  Just like in Hitchcock's ""Psyco"" the violence is graphic at the beginning but thereafter violence is ""suggested"" and not displayed graphically.This film has ability to make the audience uncomfortable and entertaining at the same time; not an easy feat.",5,Graphic Violence is Neccessary,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1576,"['response', 'who', 'understandably', 'were', 'distressed', 'films', 'violence', 'film', 'not', 'glorify', 'rape', 'child', 'molestation', 'ugliness', 'commentary', 'victimization', 'women', 'societies', 'same', 'time', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'hero', 'figure', 'who', 'play', 'victim', 'pursues', 'justice', 'unjust', 'society.Sometimes', 'necessary', 'films', 'show', 'graphic', 'violence', 'make', 'point', 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'example', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'was', 'catupulted', 'when', 'Americans', 'watched', 'news', 'were', 'greeted', 'horrific', 'images', 'sheriff', 'grabbing', 'elderly', 'black', 'woman', 'back', 'neck', 'dragging', 'out', 'voters', 'registration', 'line', 'case', 'director', 'had', 'be', 'fictitiously', 'graphic', 'have', 'same', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Remember', 'book', 'Sweden', 'called', 'Men', 'Who', 'Hate', 'Women', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'injustice', 'subject', 'matter', 'violence', 'was', 'tame', 'indeed', 'tameness', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'come', 'condoning', 'behavior.This', 'film', 'also', 'knew', 'when', 'where', 'be', 'graphic', 'difference', 'was', 'exploring', 'issue', 'exploiting', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'graphic', 'visuals', 'child', 'molestation', 'murder', 'women', 'victims', 'Instead', 'were', 'given', 'certain', 'images', 'suggest', 'horrors', 'Just', 'Hitchcock', 'Psyco', 'violence', 'graphic', 'beginning', 'thereafter', 'violence', 'suggested', 'not', 'displayed', 'graphically.This', 'film', 'ability', 'make', 'audience', 'uncomfortable', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'easy', 'feat']",N/A

I personally think this (and the entire trilogy) is one of the best cinematic events that came out of Europe in a long time.I've never read the book so I cannot compare. But as a movie buff, I can tell you that the film is very well-made and delivers some serious suspense. It is a dark thriller about 40 year-old murder of a 16 year-old girl, a family with dark secrets being investigated by a famous journalist. It only gets darker with addition of a troubled young girl with Gothic appearance and a dragon tattoo.The movie combines many various elements successfully, it is dark and very disturbing with elements of sexual abuse and torture creeping throughout the story at different levels - this is not a movie for the faint at heart. It is also a great mystery and has Sherlock Holmes' type of crime puzzle feel to it. It has some Hitchcockian elements, especially towards the end. It is quite suspenseful.There are not many extras on the Blu-ray which is a shame. I wish they included a ""making of"" featurette. The only bonus material is interview with Noomi Rapace which is quite interesting as she answers the questions with openness. If you think Noomi Rapace did a terrific job with her portrayal of this character, wait until you watch the interview - you will be even more impressed. She is absolutely nothing like the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo character. She is just a nice, sweet girl. I guess I've always imagined her to be similar to her character but I haven't seen an ounce of resemblance. This goes to show what a terrific performance she put. She talks about how she exercised for months, did kick-boxing to get in shape and learned to ride motorcycle.This version has original Swedish audio and also English dubbed-in audio.I personally prefer the Swedish film much better.

Larsson wrote them during his spare time, as a form of amusement. However, the novels were not published until after Larsson's untimely death in Nov 2004. The author never had the opportunity to enjoy the critical and the commercial success his books eventually earned. In 2008 Larssen became the second best selling author on the planet.Now, on to the story:Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist, convicted, unjustly he believes, of libel against a powerful industrialist. As Blomkvist awaits the commencement of his sentence, he is hired by a scion of a wealthy family to investigate the disappearance of the man's bellowed niece 40 years earlier. Everyone, initially including Blomkvist, believes the case is hopeless. Unexpectedly though, help comes in form of ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"", Lisbeth Salander. The mysterious woman clearly has a severe past: despite being 24 years old, her person and finances are being managed by a court appointed guardian. She does however, have a brilliant mind and, as we are about to learn, a powerful will... She quickly becomes the driving force of the investigation. We watch transfixed, as the past reaches into the presence, and touches the lives of Blomkvist, Salander, her guardian, the industrialist and the wealthy scion.The story, as written by Larsson, is extremely brutal (consider that the original, and the very apt, Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women""). However, I am inclined to believe the violence serves as another character in the story and as such is necessary. I am therefore glad that the filmmakers did not seek to tamper it, thus neutering the punch the story delivers. Though this Swedish adaptation is scripted and directed to the highest standard, the focus must be on the performance of the actress Noomi Rapace. Her portrayal of Lisbeth is shockingly faithful to the text and the actress manages to take over the film with her very appearance.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the best adaptations I have seen, ever. I encourage you not to miss it; though do see it with friends, as you will afterwards feel strongly compelled to discuss the various explosive plot twists. I hope Hollywood never touches this gem.

And we all know that Director David Fincher will re-release an American version of the film next year with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be more well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that the second film in the trilogy has already been released in Sweeden with less than positive reviews and the third in the trilogy will be released later this year...right?Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was great. Two story lines woven together nicely (albeit with the burden of reading subtitles from start to finish). The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of gun running and other unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger looking for a long lost niece.Enter storyline 2: A Goth lady named Lisbeth works at a security firm that Vanger has hired to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some serious crimes committed in her relatively distant past.As I mentioned earlier, both stories are ultimately connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. Actress Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth with a seriousness that makes you think she's a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. And be warned, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.I don't know why Fincher feels the need to re-do this movie in America, because the Sweedish version couldn't be more well done. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels.

1343553,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B003FBNJ4U,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 5]","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" is a Swedish film based upon the huge international bestselling novel of the same nameThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)by the late Swedish author Steig Larsson.  It is already in the pipeline for an American remake that will undoubtedly struggle to render the material cute and cuddly and good luck to the American filmmakers on that.  It's a mystery thriller about a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomquist (Michael Nyquist) and a troubled young female computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who are hired to investigate the case of an industrialist's favorite niece who disappeared 40 years ago and is presumed dead.Book and movie both boast a substantial amount of frank sexuality, and violence, much of it, misogynistic sadism, as seems to be not uncommon with contemporary Scandinavian authors; but they move fast, and are thoughtful and intelligent.  The movie, which was directed by Niels Arden Oplev, has so far earned an international box office of $90 million.  It has become the highest-grossing European film of 2009 and highest grossing Swedish film ever.The latter fact rather intrigues me, when you consider that means it has grossed higher than any of the many films of the late, great, much-admired, highbrow Swedish director Ingmar Bergman,Ingmar Bergman - Four Masterworks (Criterion Collection), and I can't help wondering whether this box office figure has been adjusted for inflation.  I also can't help thinking that Bergman must be turning over in his grave at this latest product from the Swedish film industry, though some of his films did have an element of violence.  Another interesting thought in regard to this statistic: the 1967 Swedish film,I Am Curious ...  (I Am Curious Yellow/I Am Curious Blue Set) - Criterion Collectionwas the movie that started the international porn trend, and was a pretty major blockbuster for its time: have the sales figures for this film been adjusted for inflation?  And, finally, ""I Am Curious"" was known in some locations as ""Yellow Bird.""  Among the production companies taking credit for ""The Girl"" is one known as Yellow Bird.  Are we then looking at an homage to ""I Am Curious?""I read the book that underlies the movie a while ago, and my memory of it is no longer as sharp as it might be, but I am pretty sure that the book gives us no back story on Lisbeth, which the movie does: possibly this back story appeared in the second or third books Larsson wrote featuring Lisbeth?  I wonder about something else, too, being unable to remember it from the book: at a fraught point in the story, Lisbeth picks up a golf club to use as a weapon.  Who picked up that golf club first, Lisbeth, or Elin Nordegren, the Swedish model who married millionaire golfer Tiger Woods, and was driven to violence by his cheating ways ?  Of course, there were probably a lot of golf clubs lying around Elin's Florida mansion....Larsson, the late author, died suddenly in 2004 as a rather young man.  He left behind three unpublished novels, now known as the ""Millennium"" trilogy: they've become an international publishing sensation.  In 2008, Larsson was the world's second best selling author behind only ""The Kite Runner's"" Khaled Hosseini.  The first of these books was published in Sweden in 2005 as ""Men Who Hate Women:""  it was published in the English speaking world under the title by which we know it; originally published in fall 2008 in the United States, it has gone on to sell nearly two million copies, making it one of the bestselling translated novels ever in the U.S.  Larsson was an investigative journalist and editor in chief of the Swedish muckraking magazine Expo.  He was one of the world's leading experts on anti-democratic, right wing fringe groups and neo-Nazi organizations; he often consulted and lectured on these subjects.  As a result, he reportedly lived for years under death threats from these people.Indeed, both book and movie appear to be the work of people who know what they are talking about - Mikael's and Lizbeth's findings, as they delve into the industrialist's family, have the ring of reality, and truth about them.  Mikael seems a bit of a wuss, but believe me, Lizbeth gives as good as she gets.  You might not want her as your sister or your daughter, but you'd want her on your side.  And you'd want to see her story, in the Swedish version.",4,Lisbeth Gives as Good as She Gets,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,4396,"['Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Swedish', 'film', 'based', 'huge', 'international', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'same', 'nameThe', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Vintage', 'late', 'Swedish', 'author', 'Steig', 'Larsson', 'already', 'pipeline', 'American', 'remake', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'struggle', 'render', 'material', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'good', 'luck', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'disgraced', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomquist', 'Michael', 'Nyquist', 'troubled', 'young', 'female', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'investigate', 'case', 'industrialist', 'favorite', 'niece', 'who', 'disappeared', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'presumed', 'dead.Book', 'movie', 'substantial', 'amount', 'frank', 'sexuality', 'violence', 'much', 'misogynistic', 'sadism', 'be', 'not', 'uncommon', 'contemporary', 'Scandinavian', 'authors', 'move', 'fast', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'so', 'far', 'earned', 'international', 'box', 'office', '90', 'million', 'become', 'highest-grossing', 'European', 'film', '2009', 'highest', 'grossing', 'Swedish', 'film', 'ever.The', 'latter', 'fact', 'rather', 'when', 'consider', 'grossed', 'higher', 'many', 'films', 'late', 'great', 'much-admired', 'highbrow', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Four', 'Masterworks', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'box', 'office', 'figure', 'been', 'adjusted', 'inflation', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Bergman', 'must', 'be', 'turning', 'over', 'grave', 'latest', 'product', 'Swedish', 'film', 'industry', 'films', 'did', 'have', 'element', 'violence', 'interesting', 'thought', 'regard', 'statistic', '1967', 'Swedish', 'film', 'Am', 'Curious', 'Am', 'Curious', 'Yellow/I', 'Am', 'Curious', 'Blue', 'Set', 'Criterion', 'Collectionwas', 'movie', 'started', 'international', 'porn', 'trend', 'was', 'pretty', 'major', 'blockbuster', 'time', 'have', 'sales', 'figures', 'film', 'been', 'adjusted', 'inflation', 'finally', 'Am', 'Curious', 'was', 'known', 'locations', 'Yellow', 'Bird', 'production', 'companies', 'taking', 'credit', 'Girl', 'one', 'known', 'Yellow', 'Bird', 'Are', 'then', 'looking', 'homage', 'Am', 'Curious', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'while', 'ago', 'memory', 'no', 'longer', 'as', 'sharp', 'might', 'be', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'book', 'back', 'story', 'Lisbeth', 'movie', 'possibly', 'back', 'story', 'appeared', 'second', 'third', 'books', 'Larsson', 'wrote', 'featuring', 'Lisbeth', 'wonder', 'something', 'else', 'too', 'being', 'unable', 'remember', 'book', 'fraught', 'point', 'story', 'Lisbeth', 'up', 'golf', 'club', 'use', 'weapon', 'Who', 'picked', 'up', 'golf', 'club', 'first', 'Lisbeth', 'Elin', 'Nordegren', 'Swedish', 'model', 'who', 'married', 'millionaire', 'golfer', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'was', 'driven', 'violence', 'cheating', 'ways', 'course', 'were', 'probably', 'lot', 'golf', 'clubs', 'lying', 'Elin', 'Florida', 'mansion', '.Larsson', 'late', 'author', 'died', 'suddenly', '2004', 'rather', 'young', 'man', 'left', 'behind', 'three', 'unpublished', 'novels', 'now', 'known', 'Millennium', 'trilogy', ""'ve"", 'become', 'international', 'publishing', 'sensation', '2008', 'Larsson', 'was', 'world', 'second', 'best', 'selling', 'author', 'only', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'first', 'books', 'was', 'published', 'Sweden', '2005', 'Men', 'Who', 'Hate', 'Women', 'was', 'published', 'English', 'speaking', 'world', 'title', 'know', 'originally', 'published', 'fall', '2008', 'United', 'States', 'gone', 'sell', 'nearly', 'two', 'million', 'copies', 'making', 'one', 'bestselling', 'translated', 'novels', 'ever', 'U.S.', 'Larsson', 'was', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'editor', 'chief', 'Swedish', 'muckraking', 'magazine', 'Expo', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'leading', 'experts', 'anti-democratic', 'right', 'wing', 'fringe', 'groups', 'neo-Nazi', 'organizations', 'often', 'consulted', 'lectured', 'subjects', 'result', 'reportedly', 'lived', 'years', 'death', 'threats', 'people.Indeed', 'book', 'movie', 'appear', 'be', 'work', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'Mikael', 'Lizbeth', 'findings', 'delve', 'industrialist', 'family', 'have', 'ring', 'reality', 'truth', 'Mikael', 'bit', 'wuss', 'believe', 'Lizbeth', 'as', 'good', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'sister', 'daughter', ""'d"", 'want', 'side', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'story', 'Swedish', 'version']",N/A

1343556,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B003FBNJ4U,Steven A. Peterson,"[7, 8]","How many times have we seen a terrific book eviscerated when adapted for the screen? Well, this is not one of those cases. While the movie does depart from the book at many points, it is faithful to the spirit of Stieg Larsson's dynamic novel.First off, the characters fit what I would expect of the two key protagonists--the journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the quirky Lisbeth Salander. Michael Nyqvist portrays ""Kalle"" Blomkvist in a most satisfying fashion. Indeed, as Salander refers to him in the novels, he is ""Practical Pig"" and an achingly well-meaning person. Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander. If there is one role in this movie that cannot be compromised, it is Salander. The book's depiction of her calls for someone who is asocial, awkward in dealings with others, fully capable of violence, and not communicative. I wonder how Hollywood will depict Salander? However, in this movie version, Rapace is a revelation as the character. The movie (as the book) provides ample insight into how she has come to be not trusting of others (note her relationship to her new ""guardian""). The actors, then, are part of what is critical to the success of this movie.Second, the plot is compelling. Blomkvist is sentenced to prison for libel, when he is duped into publishing erroneous information in an expose of a billionaire published in his magazine, ""Millennium."" Aged Henrik Vanger, after an investigation of Blomkvist by none other than Salander, wants to finally learn the fate of his granddaughter Harriett, who had disappeared/been murdered forty years earlier. Before his prison sentence commences, Vanger hires Blomkvist (in the book, much of this action takes place after the prison sentence, but the difference is a matter of no consequence as the movie is structured) to investigate the mystery. He begins his task, housed in an outbuilding on a gloomy island, populated by other Vangers (who appear to enjoy internecine battles one with another). After having hacked Blomkvist's computer as part of her investigation of him, Salander becomes interested in the murder of five women. After a sequence that, once more, departs from the book without affecting the dynamics of the story, the two partner in trying to solve the crimes and figure out what had happened to Harriett.Third, the cinematography is well done. The winter scenes almost made me shiver!The movie lasts 2 1/2 hours, but it did not seem that long at all. For me, the action rushed ahead, to the point where Blomkvist discovers who the villain of the piece is, to where he is saved from death by Salander, to her tracking the murderer. Again, this scene departs from the book but it might be even more satisfying here in terms of the drama, as Salander is not just witness to the murderer's death, but has some role in that death. We learn of the even more ghastly deeds of the murderer than what the two had originally discovered.While he is finally in prison, Salander sees Blomkvist one last time before she goes off to make her fortune. She gives Blomkvist the evidence he needs (from her ability to hack) to avenge himself against the billionaire who had duped him into actions leading to his stay in prison. Poignant, too, is her awkward kiss, as if she is not sure that she should show any warmth toward Blomkvist. . . . The book ends in the spirit of the novel, with Blomkvist seeing Salander on a video, in the process of her also helping him to destroy the tycoon Wennerstrom (although what she was doing was NOT in collaboration with Blomkvist!).When the story diverges from the book, it still manages to maintain the spirit of the published work. In some cases, in fact, the movie might even outdo the book. In short, a very satisfying movie version of the first work in the trilogy.",5,A satisfying adaptation to the screen,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,3774,"['How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'terrific', 'book', 'eviscerated', 'when', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Well', 'not', 'one', 'cases', 'movie', 'depart', 'book', 'many', 'points', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'Stieg', 'Larsson', 'dynamic', 'novel.First', 'off', 'characters', 'fit', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'two', 'key', 'protagonists', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'quirky', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'Kalle', 'Blomkvist', 'most', 'satisfying', 'fashion', 'Indeed', 'Salander', 'refers', 'novels', 'Practical', 'Pig', 'achingly', 'well-meaning', 'person', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'one', 'role', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compromised', 'Salander', 'book', 'depiction', 'calls', 'someone', 'who', 'asocial', 'awkward', 'dealings', 'others', 'fully', 'capable', 'violence', 'not', 'communicative', 'wonder', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'depict', 'Salander', 'However', 'movie', 'version', 'Rapace', 'revelation', 'character', 'movie', 'book', 'ample', 'insight', 'how', 'come', 'be', 'not', 'trusting', 'others', 'note', 'relationship', 'new', 'guardian', 'actors', 'then', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'critical', 'success', 'movie.Second', 'plot', 'compelling', 'Blomkvist', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'libel', 'when', 'duped', 'publishing', 'erroneous', 'information', 'expose', 'billionaire', 'published', 'magazine', 'Millennium', 'Aged', 'Henrik', 'Vanger', 'investigation', 'Blomkvist', 'none', 'other', 'Salander', 'finally', 'learn', 'fate', 'granddaughter', 'Harriett', 'who', 'had', 'disappeared/been', 'murdered', 'forty', 'years', 'earlier', 'prison', 'sentence', 'commences', 'Vanger', 'Blomkvist', 'book', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'prison', 'sentence', 'difference', 'matter', 'consequence', 'movie', 'structured', 'investigate', 'mystery', 'task', 'housed', 'outbuilding', 'gloomy', 'island', 'populated', 'other', 'Vangers', 'who', 'appear', 'enjoy', 'internecine', 'battles', 'one', 'having', 'hacked', 'Blomkvist', 'computer', 'part', 'investigation', 'Salander', 'interested', 'murder', 'five', 'women', 'sequence', 'once', 'more', 'departs', 'book', 'affecting', 'dynamics', 'story', 'two', 'partner', 'trying', 'solve', 'crimes', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Harriett.Third', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'winter', 'almost', 'made', 'shiver', 'movie', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'long', 'action', 'rushed', 'ahead', 'point', 'where', 'Blomkvist', 'discovers', 'who', 'villain', 'piece', 'where', 'saved', 'death', 'Salander', 'tracking', 'murderer', 'Again', 'scene', 'book', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'satisfying', 'here', 'terms', 'drama', 'Salander', 'not', 'just', 'witness', 'murderer', 'death', 'role', 'death', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'ghastly', 'deeds', 'murderer', 'what', 'two', 'had', 'originally', 'discovered.While', 'finally', 'prison', 'Salander', 'Blomkvist', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'make', 'fortune', 'Blomkvist', 'evidence', 'ability', 'hack', 'avenge', 'billionaire', 'who', 'had', 'duped', 'actions', 'leading', 'stay', 'prison', 'Poignant', 'too', 'awkward', 'kiss', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'show', 'warmth', 'Blomkvist', 'book', 'spirit', 'novel', 'Blomkvist', 'seeing', 'Salander', 'video', 'process', 'also', 'helping', 'destroy', 'tycoon', 'Wennerstrom', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'NOT', 'collaboration', 'Blomkvist', '.When', 'story', 'diverges', 'book', 'still', 'maintain', 'spirit', 'published', 'work', 'cases', 'fact', 'movie', 'might', 'even', 'outdo', 'book', 'short', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'version', 'first', 'work', 'trilogy']",N/A

Of course, it is dubbed, but the dubbing is very well done.SEX AND VIOLENCEDespite the ""R"" rating and comments of some other reviewers, the sex and violence are minimal.  There is a brutal rape scene, but even so, it is brief and minimally explicit---even the rapist's butt is mostly covered, and is the only nudity in the scene. Like most sane individuals, I do not care to view or read about rape scenes.  In this case, the scene is essential to the story.  Otherwise, any sex is mostly implied.  A pair of small very-average boobs make their appearance a few times, but that's it.  No ""bush"", no genitals, male or female.Hollywood directors have made an art of of the pruriently gruesome and disturbing, physically and psychologically---although (at least for network TV, without showing ""interesting"" body parts). This is not a Hollywood product.  A typical episode of ""Bones"" or ""CSI"" is more gruesome.So, chill.  This is a very good, easy to watch, movie.  It closely follows the book, and may be difficult for folks who haven't read the book to follow.  For better or worse, this actualy being a ""foreign"" film, the actors are more like real people than the typical plastic Hollywood drones.DETAILSAgain, I was a little hesitant to read the book because of the Swedish title ""Men Who Hate Women"", and comments by other reviewers about brutal rape scenes. Actually, this is a terrific thriller which revolves around two great characters. There are three women-hating male characters, but they are minor characters who appear briefly and are not significantly developed.CHARACTERSThe ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" (and many other tattoos) is a thin antisocial girl named Lisbeth Salander afflicted with Asperger Syndrome. She works as a free-lance detective, at which she is very successful because of her photographic memory and computer hacking skills.  The other major character is Carl Mikael Blomkvist, a business journalist, who was set up, and convicted of libel against a crooked businessman, who is part of worldwide organized criminal enterprise.  Other significant characters are members of the Vanger family--old money industrialist.STORYLINESThere are three story lines: In the first, Lisbeth seeks vengeance against a social worker who is her legal guardian, and who raped her.In the second storyline, Henrik Vanger hires Blomkvist to investigate the 30-year old disappearance (presumed murder) of his niece. Blomkvist and Lisbeth come together mostly because Henrik (indirectly) hired her to investigate Blomkvist before hiring him.In the third storyline, Blomkvist seeks revenge against the crook who set him up.EXTENDED TRILOGYNote that there is a ""very extended edition"" of the trilogy available, but it is in Swedish only (albeit English subtitles are available)Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended EditionActually, it is the original ca 12-hour 6-part mini-series which was shown on Swedish TV.

than her own.Blomkvist is supposed to be a campaigning journalist-editor of a magazine.I was not convinced by the Nyqvist's playing him in such a mute,low-key way.The only time I was convinced was in the scene where he is constricted,terrified and waiting to be killed by Martin,the psychopath.The subject matter-the abuse and mutilation of women-is not eroticised and depicts Larsson's major preoccupations:fascism and violence against women.The unbelievable horrors Blomkvist unearths are rooted in both and anti-semitism is a motive in the killings.I thought the sex scenes were not overdone and there is a kind of equality between the genders.The focus is always on the victim's experience.I also thought Nyqvist didn't bring out the tensions,the clashes between Blomkvist and Lisbeth as they worked together.From the film we can foretell quite early on what is going to happen with the fascist Vanglers with their many cupboarded skeletons.The graphic photographs of an array of  murdered women in the killer's lair  doesn't leave much to the imagination, may have betrayed some of the book's original subtlety and feminism.This may be necessary to the narrative:Salander will eventually behave in a ruthless and brutal manner as a result of the view of the world her experiences have given her.What I particularly liked about the film was in it's use of photography,the working out of the topography of the disappearance of Harriet,placing many photos side by side,blowing them up,reinvoking the past through imagery.This recalled films like Blow-Up and Tell No One,similarly in its search for a `dead' person.The serial killer/abuse scenarios and the revenge fantasy is dangerously close to the reactionary Hollywood style that will be stepped up with the remake in the American version.I still much prefer this subtitled film with its unknown actors to any concocted by Hollywood.And Rapace is phenomenal.She is a feminist icon.",4,Men who hate

Her portrayal is just spot on, I don't know how anyone can reprise the role in a Western cinema remake any better. You develop a visual image in your mind when you read a book and I was thrilled when this movie perfectly depicted what I saw in my mind as I read the book. Of several interviews I've seen of her speaking about the role, she threw herself into the part as fiercely and vigorously as any Western star who physically transformed themselves into the character rather than just simply play the part. The scenery is absolutlely fantastic, very pretty country and I will have to add it as a destination in the future (if I ever hit the lottery). I hear they already have a walking tour of the movies filming locations!As with all movies, parts of the book must be deleted to make the movie a manageable length (deleted a lot of Blomkvist's sex with every skirt that got within 50 yards of him and a lot of technical stuff relating to her expertise as a hacker, for starters). However, I thought this version stayed quite true to the important points of the storyline. The small bits that were changed from the book were very minor and were barely noticeable (as opposed to The Lord of The Rings. Read that again and you will be aghast at how much Jackson changed from the book). The actors (for the most part) do not express as much visually as you see in American films which I guess is reflective of the European style of filming and does detract a little due to my being used to Hollywood cinematography. Michael Nyqvist does a B+ job as Mikael Blomkvist, but as I said is mostly expressionless throughout the film. Dramatic lines are delivered much the same as casual conversation. I agree that the film is not as smooth as it could have been, but everyone who demands Hollywood format will have to wait for its version. It will surely have far less of the sufferage of Lisbeth than in this film (you get both rapes and sufficient visuals to earn it an NC-17 rating here), and will have bigger explosions and more dramatic confrotations, etc. I enjoyed watching it in the original language which I would recommend if you've read the book which I highly recommend, no, I insist you do first.I give it an A- overall and caution only that it is definitely not for immature viewers.I congratulate the entire production company involved on a job very well done!Bring on the release of the second and third films!",5,Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander!,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,2538,"['walked', 'right', 'book', 'equivalent', 'what', 'Oscar', 'there', 'portrayal', 'just', 'spot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'reprise', 'role', 'Western', 'cinema', 'remake', 'better', 'develop', 'visual', 'image', 'mind', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'depicted', 'what', 'saw', 'mind', 'read', 'book', 'several', 'interviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'speaking', 'role', 'threw', 'part', 'fiercely', 'vigorously', 'Western', 'star', 'who', 'physically', 'transformed', 'character', 'rather', 'just', 'simply', 'play', 'part', 'scenery', 'absolutlely', 'fantastic', 'very', 'pretty', 'country', 'will', 'have', 'add', 'destination', 'future', 'ever', 'hit', 'lottery', 'hear', 'already', 'have', 'walking', 'tour', 'movies', 'filming', 'locations', 'movies', 'parts', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'deleted', 'make', 'movie', 'manageable', 'length', 'deleted', 'lot', 'Blomkvist', 'sex', 'skirt', 'got', '50', 'yards', 'lot', 'technical', 'stuff', 'relating', 'expertise', 'hacker', 'starters', 'However', 'thought', 'version', 'stayed', 'quite', 'true', 'important', 'points', 'storyline', 'small', 'bits', 'were', 'changed', 'book', 'were', 'very', 'minor', 'were', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'opposed', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Read', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'aghast', 'how', 'much', 'Jackson', 'changed', 'book', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'express', 'much', 'visually', 'see', 'American', 'films', 'guess', 'reflective', 'European', 'style', 'filming', 'detract', 'little', 'due', 'being', 'used', 'Hollywood', 'cinematography', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'B+', 'job', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'said', 'mostly', 'expressionless', 'film', 'Dramatic', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'much', 'same', 'casual', 'conversation', 'agree', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'smooth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'everyone', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'format', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'version', 'will', 'surely', 'have', 'far', 'less', 'sufferage', 'Lisbeth', 'film', 'get', 'rapes', 'sufficient', 'visuals', 'earn', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'here', 'will', 'have', 'bigger', 'explosions', 'more', 'dramatic', 'confrotations', 'etc', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'original', 'language', 'would', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'highly', 'recommend', 'insist', 'do', 'first.I', 'give', 'A-', 'overall', 'caution', 'only', 'definitely', 'not', 'immature', 'viewers.I', 'congratulate', 'entire', 'production', 'company', 'involved', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Bring', 'release', 'second', 'third', 'films']",N/A
1343570,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003FBNJ4U,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 13]","I think people who frequent foreign and independent films do so because they are looking for something different and unusual, something to challenge them, make them think, something to encourage discussion. Let's face it. Most of the studio films released can barely elicit more than a quick ""It was okay"". Or perhaps a terse ""It sucked"".I try to go to a fair number of these every year for these very reasons. Because I love to see films so much, I get sucked in by the hype of the big budget Hollywood films on a regular basis. And I frequently get disappointed. I need Foreign and independent films to provide an antidote to the cookie cutter fare usually perpetrated by the studios.But because American films are so popular worldwide, foreign filmmakers are struggling to find a market for their works, even in their own countries. The solution? Many are making their films more 'American'. Recently, the French thriller ""Tell No One"", based on an American bestseller, could easily have been the latest Michael Douglas thriller. In fact, I would be surprised if an American remake is not in the works. I think the film only worked as well as it did because the actors are French and spoke their native language throughout, somehow making it seem more intelligent. But the film is marred by an overly expository ending in which the guilty party explains at length how they committed the crime because there is basically no other way for us to know this happened. The film never gives us the clues we need to connect the dots.Now, the Swedish thriller ""The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo"", based on the international bestseller is a similar, better and more unusual film than ""Tell No One"".Mikael Blomkvist (Mikael Nykvist) is a disgraced journalist; his latest investigative target, a questionable billionaire has sued for liable and won, meaning Mikael must leave the magazine he started in order to save it. To occupy his time, he answers a query from a reclusive old man, Martin Vanger (Peter Haber), once a captain of industry, heading the company his family owned and operated, who now lives more or less as a recluse. Martin wants Mikael to find his niece, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances almost forty years ago. Mikael is reluctant, but a few mysterious photographs serve to pique his interest and he agrees to help.Lisabeth Salander (Noomi Repace) is a street-wise young woman very adept at computer hacking and finding people. She works at a detective agency finding people, making inquiries into their past, digging up dirt. Her inquiries into Mikael lead him to find out about her and he asks her to help him in his inquiries. She must be good to get past all of the firewalls protecting his information. She realizes this may be an opportunity to leave her abusive and violent past behind and agrees to help.As Mikael and Lisabeth begin their investigations, they quickly realize there may be more unexplained mysterious deaths connected and the scope of the investigation increases, becoming more dangerous.Before and during their investigations, they meet some people who are truly frightening. The film doesn't shy away from showing why these people are frightening (especially to Lisabeth) and these moments are a little hard to watch. But these same moments are also one of the aspects that set this film apart. An American film would never depict such brutality, could never depict such brutality and receive a wide release. Don't get me wrong. I think the brutality is necessary to the story, necessary to help us understand the type of character Lisabeth is. If it were simply gratuitous and didn't serve the story, ""Dragon"" would be a different beast altogether. But because it is a part of the story, it is necessary to experience these moments. Without it, the film would seem hollow and very artificial.All of this is good and all of this adds up to precisely what makes independent and foreign films so interesting to me, so vital a part of my movie going regimen.My problem with ""Dragon Tattoo"" comes in the last few moments. Much like a bad American thriller, or a television show, the identity of the people responsible is revealed through lengthy discourse from the guilty party themselves. They tell a story revealing all, who, what, when, where, how. And much of it doesn't make sense or add up because we simply aren't given the details. Any details we are given are so buried within the confusing and multi-layered narrative it almost seems like this dialogue is needed to help tie up the loose ends.When writers resort to this method of discourse, it just seems sloppy. If you are writing the film, you have the license to do whatever you want. Make it believable enough and the reader (and watcher) will go with you. I can't comment on whether the book follows this same road because I haven't read it. Given the success of the book, I have to think the screenwriters who needed to streamline the story a bit did this. They cut out some scenes and as a result had to 'tie everything' up in the end.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is interesting and unusual enough to satisfy the serious cinephile's foreign film bug. I just wish they had been able to come up with a better, more unusual way, tying up the story's loose ends, providing these same viewers with a truly memorable ending. As it stands, it is little better than the ending of an episode of ""Murder She Wrote"".The remaining two books in the trilogy have already been made into films in Sweden. An American remake is already in the works from director David Fincher (""Seven"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""). If anyone is able to retain the violent, unusual nature of the story, Fincher seems a good choice. Brad Pitt is a strong candidate for the male lead. It will be interesting to see how this strange hybrid foreign film translates to an American made film.",4,"Interesting, but Flawed",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,5879,"['think', 'people', 'who',

YES! but you must order the books with the movies.  im now reading the girl who played with fire and its done the same way with the film.  to fully apreciate the movies you MUST read the books.  yes they take a long time to read with all the swedish names and the fact that they are done through the eyes of 2 protagonists. you have to pay attention to the details.  but its soooo worth it.ive seen all three movies.1 and  2 on dvd and 3 i saw at a art house cimena on a planetarium dome  which was awesome.by the way the first is most violent one.  if you got through the violence in the girl with the dragon tattoo, youll be just fine through the girl who played with fire and the girl who kicked the hornets nest.  the second has one violent sex assault in it but its not as drawn out as the first.  all three have flash backs of the bjurman/lisbeth rape but in the 2nd and 3rd they are short. you may not want your kids awake but its not as much mental torture as the first that frankly makes you sick at your stomach.i cant even watch saturday night fever but atleast in these there is revenge and or justice.",4,"almost a five, but im kicking a star for lack of feeling",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2729,"['i', 'absolutly', 'love', 'story', 'im', 'huge', 'fan', 'trilogy', 'are', 'brutal', 'i', 'can', 'respect', 'people', 'walking', 'out', 'violence', 'massive', 'i', 'love', 'book', 'i', 'love', 'movie', 'first', 'ill', 'say', 'noomie', 'rapace', 'did', 'phemominal', 'job', 'portraying', 'lisbeth', 'took', 'step', 'steps', 'american', 'actors', 'wouldnt', 'generally', 'take', 'embody', 'character', 'even', 'got', 'mulitple', 'facial', 'piercings', 'film', 'ceptum', 'ring', 'ill', 'tell', 'dont', 'have', 'one', 'painful', 'piercing', 'i', 'had', '14', 'g.', 'mine', 'having', 'nose', 'broke', 'someones', 'fist', 'did', 'massive', 'exercise', 'get', 'maleish', 'body', 'build', 'lisbeth', 'portrayed', 'scenes', 'i', 'know', 'people', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'do', 'willingly', 'pulled', 'off', 'T.', 'other', 'actors', 'well', 'were', 'amazing.ok', 'nows', 'only', 'downpoint', 'movies', 'are', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'so', 'not', 'was', 'alot', 'choice', 'could', 'have', 'shortened', 'stuff', 'put', 'scenes', 'end', 'lisbeth', 'HAD', 'human', 'emotions', 'did', 'was', 'love', 'mikael', 'stated', 'yes', 'L', 'word', 'book', 'sweet', 'thing', 'elvis', 'mikael', 'knocked', 'out.SPOILERSby', 'knocking', 'out', 'fact', 'was', 'love', 'mikael', 'how', 'worked', 'reason', 'wouldnt', 'speak', 'mikael', 'so', 'much', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'fire', 'left', 'audience', 'blinded', 'made', 'lisbeth', 'look', 'winch', 'emotion', 'didnt', 'trust', 'people', 'wasnt', 'that.no', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'end', 'kicked', 'curb', 'case', 'was', 'closed', 'care.is', 'movie', 'great', 'YES', 'must', 'order', 'books', 'movies', 'im', 'now', 'reading', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'fire', 'done', 'same', 'way', 'film', 'fully', 'apreciate', 'movies', 'MUST', 'read', 'books', 'yes', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'read', 'swedish', 'names', 'fact', 'are', 'done', 'eyes', '2', 'protagonists', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'soooo', 'worth', 'it.ive', 'seen', 'three', 'movies.1', '2', 'dvd', '3', 'i', 'saw', 'art', 'house', 'cimena', 'planetarium', 'dome', 'was', 'way', 'first', 'most', 'violent', 'one', 'got', 'violence', 'girl', 'dragon', 'tattoo', 'youll', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'fire', 'girl', 'who', 'kicked', 'hornets', 'nest', 'second', 'one', 'violent', 'sex', 'assault', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'first', 'three', 'have', 'flash', 'backs', 'bjurman/lisbeth', 'rape', '2nd', '3rd', 'are', 'short', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'kids', 'awake', 'not', 'much', 'mental', 'torture', 'first', 'frankly', 'sick', 'stomach.i', 'cant', 'even', 'watch', 'saturday', 'night', 'fever', 'atleast', 'revenge', 'justice']",N/A

It's a story straight out of an American pulp novel from the 50's or 60's.  So this movie (based on the popular Swedish book) is ""neo-noir"" I guess.  Updated.  Modern.  But still noir.  Disturbing for all its violence against women--but I guess that goes with the pulp territory.

I have yet to see the Daniel Craig version, I hear it's really good, but given the fact that this movie was made in sweden, I would imagine it being more faithful. So this is the first part of the millennium trilogy.STORYForty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering on the island owned and inhabited by the powerful Vanger clan. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder and that the killer is a member of his own tightly knit but dysfunctional family. He employs disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, ruthless computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.I am a big fan of suspense novels and films, and this was the movie that really stunned my visual perspective. The story will keep you engaged wether you have read the book or not. The flow of the film is kept faithful to the book, this is rare when it comes down to book to movie adaptations. One of the best things about this movie was that the story does not drag, it does have anything in it that's not necessary. In fact, you need to pay attention to every little thing, because every little thing does have some connection with the climax of the film, including its chilling twist.ACTINGNoomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was terrific, she was tough, she fit the role perfectly. I can tell Noomi really got into the role. She is by far my favorite book/movie character simply because her character is so intense, we learn about her past until the end. Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist was fantastic, a very thrilling actor. Everyone's acting was great, and I would go on and on about all the great performances that were given, but I'll just leave it at that.FILTERSI really liked the filter used to make the film, it was dark, and it left a tense atmoshpere.FINAL WORDGreat show, great show! They were able to incorporate every detail that the book had, nothing seemed rushed. As I said earlier, I have yet to see the daniel craig version, but I can't imagine hollywood mastering this masterpiece. I will watch that version as well, I also can't wait to see how they did ""The girl who played with fire"" and ""The girl who kicked the hornets nest."" They were all great stories. I highly recommend you to see this movie, fans of the book will be pleased, even if you haven't read the book, you're gonna love this!",5,The suspense of a life time!,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,2733,"['reading', 'book', 'loved', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'version', 'hear', 'really', 'good', 'given', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'sweden', 'would', 'imagine', 'being', 'more', 'faithful', 'first', 'part', 'millennium', 'trilogy.STORYForty', 'years', 'ago', 'Harriet', 'Vanger', 'disappeared', 'family', 'gathering', 'island', 'owned', 'inhabited', 'powerful', 'Vanger', 'clan', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'yet', 'uncle', 'convinced', 'was', 'murder', 'killer', 'member', 'own', 'tightly', 'knit', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'disgraced', 'financial', 'journalist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'tattooed', 'ruthless', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'investigate', 'When', 'pair', 'link', 'Harriet', 'disappearance', 'number', 'grotesque', 'murders', 'almost', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'begin', 'unravel', 'dark', 'appalling', 'family', 'history', 'Vangers', 'are', 'secretive', 'clan', 'Blomkvist', 'Salander', 'are', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'prepared', 'go', 'protect', 'themselves.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'suspense', 'novels', 'films', 'was', 'movie', 'really', 'stunned', 'visual', 'perspective', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'engaged', 'wether', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'flow', 'film', 'kept', 'faithful', 'book', 'rare', 'when', 'down', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'not', 'drag', 'have', 'anything', 'not', 'necessary', 'fact', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'little', 'thing', 'little', 'thing', 'have', 'connection', 'climax', 'film', 'including', 'chilling', 'twist.ACTINGNoomi', 'Rapace', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'was', 'terrific', 'was', 'tough', 'fit', 'role', 'perfectly', 'can', 'tell', 'Noomi', 'really', 'got', 'role', 'far', 'favorite', 'book/movie', 'character', 'simply', 'character', 'so', 'intense', 'learn', 'past', 'end', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'Mikael', 'Blomkvist', 'was', 'fantastic', 'very', 'thrilling', 'actor', 'Everyone', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'would', 'go', 'great', 'performances', 'were', 'given', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'that.FILTERSI', 'really', 'liked', 'filter', 'used', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'dark', 'left', 'tense', 'atmoshpere.FINAL', 'WORDGreat', 'show', 'great', 'show', 'were', 'able', 'incorporate', 'detail', 'book', 'had', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'said', 'earlier', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'daniel', 'craig', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'hollywood', 'mastering', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'watch', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'fire', 'girl', 'who', 'kicked', 'hornets', 'nest', 'were', 'great', 'stories', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie', 'fans', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love']",N/A
