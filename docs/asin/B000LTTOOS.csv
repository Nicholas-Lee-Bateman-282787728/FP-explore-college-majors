Hollywood, who has a tendency to produce sanitized icons of saintly figures, could take note of how realistic Pyotr Mamonov's portrayal is of Fr. Anatoly's life as a merry prankster who possesses special heavenly gifts.  The drama could have been so mundane as not to be special if it weren't for a secret in this monk's life during World War II that makes him vulnerable and truly appreciate the mercy he dispenses to others.Endearing for the human way he demonstrates impatience for pilgrims who arrive at his door and an impetuous desire to play pranks even during holy mass, this saint is as believable for his antics which is God's seeming antidote to the grimness presented in his fellow Russians' lives.

1040607,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000LTTOOS,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","'The Island' is a film that, for me, came out of nowhere.  Not only did I not know about its popularity and success in Russia, I'd never even heard of it.  Now it's not so odd that I'm unaware of a particular film - especially those produced outside the U.S. - but after viewing this remarkable effort, I find it very surprising that it hasn't garnered more critical attention and vocal support here in the States, and I'm absolutely flabbergasted that it's not even in stock at this time (and I don't get flabbergasted easily).All kidding aside, 'The Island' is one of most artistic endeavors I've yet seen dealing with deep-seated questions concerning faith and redemption.  Set primarily in the Soviet years of the 1970's, the story opens though with a flashback to World War II, where Anatoly (Pyotr Mamonov) is captured by the Germans while working on a tug boat full of coal.  In order to save his own life, he is forced to take that of his companion, Tikhon - but salvation is short lived.  The Germans pull a doublecross and blow up the tug.  Somehow, Anatoly survives and is rescued by Russian Orthodox monks from a nearby monastery.Flash forward then thirty years, and Anatoly is still with the monks.  Nominally referred to as Father Anatoly, he is not a member of the order, but over the years, he has gained a reputation as a holy man, and people come to him as they believe he can tell the future, heal the sick, and cast out demons.  That he actually has such powers is accepted within the framework of the film, though Anatoly himself suffers the torments of the damned from his traitorious actions of thirty years earlier.This is a visually arresting movie, set in an unnamed area of wintry Russia, and as the viewer follows the plight of Anatoly as he searches for forgiveness, we are also treated to the stark landscape of the monastery and the distant island Anatoly retreats to in order to send his entreaties heavenward.  The monks of the monastery are still unsure about their mad brother, even after all the time he's spent beside them, and at times are more concerned with his failure to follow their rites correctly than whether or not he truly has powers granted to him by God.  To make matters worse, Anatoly seems to be able to look inside his fellow monks as well, and see their hidden sins.  They do not take it well that he chooses to reveal this knowledge to them in the form of pranks and riddles.I don't think I can recommend this film highly enough - not only to faith-based viewers, but to anyone interested in the universal themes of guilt and redemption.  Patience is required though - sounding these sort of soulful depths is not quick nor easy.  There are no shortcuts, and the tale is told with allegory and metaphor.  Those in search of action and suspense would do well to look elsewhere.This film bears repeated watching.  As a layman, I thought I detected many references to the Christian Gospels, and I'm sure that I missed other clues intrinsic to Russian Orthodox beliefs.  Some other reviewers made mention that this is a good movie to learn more about the rites of the Orthodox, but I'd have to disagree.  What is shown is no more than a glimpse, something that would probably already be familiar to its Russian audience, but not integral to Anatoly's quest for forgiveness.  Truthfully, this film trancends specific religious dogma and portrays one individuals approach to God.  I'm sure there are many other fine places of information on the Orthodox Church, it's just that this film isn't that kind of source.Often, these sorts of stories can be overbearing, almost clubbing the viewer on top of the head with their message.  What is truly endearing about 'The Island' is that it isn't trying to evangelize.  In its stark portrayel of humility, faith and forgiveness, though, it inspires something that can be as rare in religious circles as well as anywhere else -  a feeling of sublime joy in all the challenges of being human while seeking a closeness with the Creator.",5,Sublime and powerful,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,4026,"[""'The"", 'Island', 'film', 'came', 'nowhere', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'popularity', 'success', 'Russia', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Now', 'not', 'so', 'odd', ""'m"", 'unaware', 'particular', 'film', 'especially', 'produced', 'U.S.', 'viewing', 'remarkable', 'effort', 'find', 'very', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'garnered', 'more', 'critical', 'attention', 'vocal', 'support', 'here', 'States', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'flabbergasted', 'not', 'even', 'stock', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'flabbergasted', 'easily', '.All', 'kidding', 'aside', 'Island', 'one', 'most', 'artistic', 'endeavors', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'dealing', 'deep-seated', 'questions', 'concerning', 'faith', 'redemption', 'Set', 'primarily', 'Soviet', 'years', '1970', 'story', 'flashback', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'where', 'Anatoly', 'Pyotr', 'Mamonov', 'captured', 'Germans', 'working', 'tug', 'boat', 'full', 'coal', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'forced', 'take', 'companion', 'Tikhon', 'salvation', 'short', 'lived', 'Germans', 'pull', 'doublecross', 'blow', 'up', 'tug', 'Somehow', 'Anatoly', 'survives', 'rescued', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'monks', 'nearby', 'monastery.Flash', 'forward', 'then', 'thirty', 'years', 'Anatoly', 'still', 'monks', 'Nominally', 'referred', 'Father', 'Anatoly', 'not', 'member', 'order', 'years', 'gained', 'reputation', 'holy', 'man', 'people', 'come', 'believe', 'can', 'tell', 'future', 'heal', 'sick', 'cast', 'out', 'demons', 'actually', 'such', 'powers', 'accepted', 'framework', 'film', 'Anatoly', 'torments', 'damned', 'traitorious', 'actions', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier.This', 'visually', 'arresting', 'movie', 'set', 'unnamed', 'area', 'wintry', 'Russia', 'viewer', 'plight', 'Anatoly', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'stark', 'landscape', 'monastery', 'distant', 'island', 'Anatoly', 'order', 'send', 'entreaties', 'heavenward', 'monks', 'monastery', 'are', 'still', 'unsure', 'mad', 'brother', 'even', 'time', 'spent', 'times', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'failure', 'follow', 'rites', 'correctly', 'not', 'truly', 'powers', 'granted', 'God', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Anatoly', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'fellow', 'monks', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'hidden', 'sins', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'reveal', 'knowledge', 'form', 'pranks', 'riddles.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'enough', 'not', 'only', 'faith-based', 'viewers', 'anyone', 'interested', 'universal', 'themes', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'Patience', 'required', 'sounding', 'sort', 'soulful', 'depths', 'not', 'quick', 'easy', 'are', 'shortcuts', 'tale', 'told', 'allegory', 'metaphor', 'search', 'action', 'suspense', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'look', 'elsewhere.This', 'film', 'bears', 'repeated', 'watching', 'layman', 'thought', 'detected', 'many', 'references', 'Christian', 'Gospels', ""'m"", 'sure', 'missed', 'other', 'clues', 'intrinsic', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'beliefs', 'other', 'reviewers', 'made', 'mention', 'good', 'movie', 'learn', 'more', 'rites', 'Orthodox', ""'d"", 'have', 'disagree', 'What', 'shown', 'more', 'glimpse', 'something', 'would', 'probably', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'Russian', 'audience', 'not', 'integral', 'Anatoly', 'quest', 'forgiveness', 'Truthfully', 'film', 'specific', 'religious', 'dogma', 'one', 'individuals', 'approach', 'God', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'places', 'information', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'just', 'film', ""n't"", 'kind', 'source.Often', 'sorts', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'overbearing', 'almost', 'clubbing', 'viewer', 'top', 'head', 'message', 'What', 'truly', 'endearing', ""'The"", 'Island', ""n't"", 'trying', 'evangelize', 'stark', 'portrayel', 'humility', 'faith', 'forgiveness', 'though', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'rare', 'religious', 'circles', 'as', 'well', 'anywhere', 'else', 'feeling', 'sublime', 'joy', 'challenges', 'being', 'human', 'seeking', 'closeness', 'Creator']","Ostrov (The Island), NTSC version with English subtitles"

1040609,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000LTTOOS,Christopher Culver,"[3, 8]","The 2006 film OSTROV (The Island) is a story of religious faith in the bleak Russian north. As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.But Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.The film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.Nonetheless, I found OSTROV rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's STALKER or the ending of OFFRET).All in all, OSTROV is entertaining but not terribly deep.",3,"Entertaining and a glimpse of a lifestyle mysterious to many outside Russia, but very melodramatic",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,2001,"['2006', 'film', 'OSTROV', 'Island', 'story', 'religious', 'faith', 'bleak', 'Russian', 'north', 'film', '1942', 'young', 'Russian', 'sailor', 'Anatoly', 'forced', 'Germans', 'shoot', 'captain', 'Tikhon', 'Left', 'dead', 'Anatoly', 'up', 'shore', 'island', 'where', 'monastery', 'located', 'next', 'three', 'decades', 'monks', 'trying', 'atone', 'killing', 'friend', 'shipmate', 'Eventually', 'lowest', 'low', 'Anatoly', 'granted', 'clairvoyance', 'ability', 'work', 'miracles', 'steady', 'stream', 'visitors', 'island', 'seek', 'help.But', 'Anatoly', 'certain', 'kind', 'saint', 'specific', 'Russian', 'tradition', 'holy', 'fool', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'fellow', 'monks', 'point', 'think', 'insane', 'eventually', 'everything', 'revealed', 'communicate', 'key', 'spiritual', 'point', 'Between', 'ministering', 'outsiders', 'who', 'visit', 'dealing', 'exasperated', 'brethren', 'Anatoly', 'rest.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'way', 'plot', 'engaging', 'enough', 'audiences', 'outside', 'Russia', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'Russians', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Communism', 'informative', 'presentation', 'realities', 'Orthodox', 'monastic', 'life', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'Pyotr', 'Mamonov', ""n't"", 'look', 'decrepit', 'real-life', 'screen', 'really', 'convincing', 'starets', 'who', 'spent', 'decades', 'unforgiving', 'environment.Nonetheless', 'found', 'OSTROV', 'rather', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'seeming', 'best', 'sappy', 'worst', 'outright', 'propaganda', 'certain', 'kind', 'contemporary', 'Russian', 'Orthodoxy', ""n't"", 'represent', 'faith', 'entirely', 'well', 'When', 'one', 'Russian', 'Orthodoxy', 'cinema', 'one', 'tempted', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'even', 'when', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', ""n't"", 'directly', 'using', 'Orthodox', 'themes', 'still', 'communicated', 'Christian', 'truths', 'more', 'powerfully', 'anything', 'film', 'think', 'climax', 'Tarkovsky', 'STALKER', 'ending', 'OFFRET', '.All', 'OSTROV', 'entertaining', 'not', 'terribly', 'deep']","Ostrov (The Island), NTSC version with English subtitles"

She assured me it had English subtitles as I don't speak Russian. My wife and I watched it a few nights ago. I'd have to regard it as one of the best films I've watched in the last decade. Five Stars!The story involves a cowardly act of one Russian (friend, fellow worker) against another in the presence of German military officers during WWII. Flash forward thirty years to a Russian Orthodox Monastery in the far north Russian tundra where the perpetrator is undergoing life-long exile in repentance for his cowardly act. I suppose you'd have to be well versed in the Russian Orthodox religion to fully appreciate the film and all of it's subtleties. I'm not the least bit religious. Nevertheless, I followed the story somewhat in awe of the harsh self-imposed physical and religious rigors of the lead character. I would regard him as totally insane, but of no harm to anyone but himself. In the end he achieves redemption in a somewhat stunning way.This film is simply outstanding. Probably everyone who sees it will attach different meanings to it. Are you religious, non-religious or anti-religious? You'll all enjoy it, but you may derive deep meanings that are vastly different from one another. The cinematography, in itself is worthy of considerable merit. The photography of the Russian far north presents an awesome backdrop for the story of extreme deprivation and repentance. There is very little complicated dialog in the film and the subtitles were ample for me. My wife tells me that there are subtleties in the Russian language that I could not possibly understand from the brief English subtitles, however. In any case, it's a film of astonishing beauty, but I found it to be crushingly depressing and I felt in awe through the entire viewing. I understand it received five awards about the equivalent of our Academy Awards. Believe me, it earned them!

1040616,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000LTTOOS,Kerry Walters,"[17, 17]","""Ostrov"" ranks alongside Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"" as an exquisite cinematic spiritual text.  Both are two of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen; both are thoughtful and sensitive explorations of spiritual journeys.  Both leave the viewer--or at least this viewer--richer in experience and perhaps just a bit wiser.Brother Anatoli, the protagonist in ""Ostrov,"" lives in a monastery somewhere at the edge of the world on the North Sea.  The colors in the film are nearly monochromatic:  wintry whites, grays, and deep blues, with only an occasional flash of color, that encourage a feeling of stillness, quiet, solitude, and inward-turning.  Anatoli is what is known in the Russian Orthodox tradition as a ""holy fool,"" an individual so focused on God, so out of touch with the customs and conventions of the world, that he or she appears simple, touched, and sometimes downright mad.  Anatoli lives as a hermit in the monastery, bunking down in the furnace house on a bed of hard coal instead of in a monk's cell.  He eats sparingly.  His clothes are ragged, his face is filthy.  He speaks in riddles, sings nonsense songs, and infuriates the more prim and proper of his brother monks.But underneath his foolishness is a deep spirituality born of immersion in the Orthodox Jesus Prayer, a mantra (usually ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner"") that calms the mind and focuses it on God.  Anatoli, without the slightest awareness of it, has over the years become a saint, a holy man.  But he thinks of himself as a great sinner because of something that occurred in his youth.  The lesson here is as obvious as it is scriptural:  God will not reject a contrite and broken heart.A film to be watched, meditated on, and (if one does such things) prayerfully celebrated.

I don't know the Slavic languages but watch Russian & Ukrainian movies without English sub-titles & try to follow along. Knowing the basics of Eastern Orthodox monasticism & the historical influence of the Starets; a monk or lay person who by spiritual struggle united with God's grace can cure human physical & spiritual problems, watching the superb acting & story line, at first one may think that they may not need the English sub-titles to understand this movie. The movie is about the spiritual struggles of Anatoli, who in World War Two was captured by the Nazi navy during a coal barge delivery. Because he worked in the boiler room, his cough gave away his hiding place & with fear turned in his best friend & captain, who he may of mistakenly shot with a gun given by the Nazi captain. The Nazis leave & Anatoli thinks he is free but doesn't know of the TNT that the Nazi's had loaded aboard. The barge blows up & Anatoli is washed ashore by a small remote monastery, where the monks rescue him. 30 years later he is a semi-Staret or Fool for Christ, a person who acts out rather than speaks direct about people's problems. Many come to visit Anatoli because they have heard that God answers his prayers, but each day Anatoli rows out to a small island where he confesses his past sin against his friend & captain. Unknown to Anatoli an Admiral hears of a famous Staret & goes to the monastery to find a cure for his sick daughter. Can the Admiral set Anatoli free? Watch this profound & moving movie with or with-out the sub-titles. The Moscow Patriarch Alexy II said the movie was a ""vivid example of an effort to take a Christian approach to culture.""DVD NTSC Version with English subtitles:The DVD I bought though Amazon.com via the ""options"" which turned out to be a Russian supplier from Norway that shipped the DVD from New York. I got fast service & the DVD came within 3 days. The DVD is written totally in Russian with no written English translation & no inside cover book. I had to guess in the ""Menu"" section where the English sub-title switch was. In the main menu screen, go to the 2nd listing where you will find the audio sections. Enter in your audio section at the top of the screen, they are in English, then go to the bottom of the same screen, the English sub-title switch is the 2nd option.Don't watch the previews which come with the DVD, most are about the Russian Mafia which is totally out of character with the movie.Pro English Sub-Titles:Okay I admit it, I did learn a few things with the English sub-titles. One part is where the main priest walks outside the coal heating room & looks in a big box & finds ropes inside. I now know why he was looking in it. I also didn't know the relationship between Anatoli & the Abbott was so close. A few other issues got cleared up with the English sub-titles. So much for my theory on Universal language :)Con English Sub-Titles:I do know a few Russian words & the English sub-titles were very Americanized. For example the 1st woman shown talking to Anatoli says something like ""you are not a Staret"" but the sub-tiles translate Staret as ""Holy Man"". A ""Staret"" will never think of himself as a ""Holy Man"" but a Sinner under God's grace. A better translation for ""Staret"" would be ""Elder"" or ""Spiritual Director"". Another example of a mis-translation is when the Abbott tells Anatoli he wants to ""tonsure"" him but in the Russian dialog the Abbott adds the word ""Schema"" which is a degree of monastism. You will never know what the Abbott is tonsuring Anatoli to, only that he wants to tonsure, which could mean ""to make a monk"". There are several other areas in the film which the English is not correct or clear.

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[100, 101]","Pavel Lungin's new Russian film OSTROV (""Island"") has taken Russia by storm and made quite an impression at Sundance. Is this film about Orthodox Christian spirituality really worth the hype or is its appeal very limited.Ostrov is worth every second of your time! It is beautiful, touching, and truly profound. The basic plot is about Anatoli, a young Russian boiler-stoker during WWII. Captured by the Nazis, he chooses the coward's route and shoots his Captain to save himself. The Nazis still bow up his barge and he washes ashore on a tiny island monastery in the Barents Sea. Thirty years later, he's Father Anatoli--and is he a madman-boiler stoker, or is a a near-Saint who can heal and who knows things?Father Anatoli is still repenting, despite seeking God's infinite forgiveness, and this is the theological crux of the film: The free grace/cost-of-discipleship paradox. This spiritual conundrum is hardly unique to Orthodox Christianity! Pious Lutherans will recall Nazi-executed Minster/Theologian Deitrich Bonhoeffer's book, 'The Cost of Discipleship,' for instance.Anatoli uses his gifts to be a Fool for Christ, who, through humility, can identify the prideful sins of others-- Father Job's vanity at book learning, Father Filaret's covetousness, etc. Although being a Fool for Christ is more understood in Orthodoxy, the concept exists in the west--witness ""Blasillo el Bobo"" in the classic Spanish novel 'San Manuel Bueno, Martir' by Unamuno.The acting in Ostrov is superb, the casting subtle and sublime. The cinematography (wide-screen monochromatic)is stunning.This is a must see for anyone interested in spirituality or repentance.A final note-- in both message and deliberate pacing, OSTROV is a splendid reproach to our quick-fix society, and the spiritual quick-fix, as Father John the Hieromonk of St. Michael's Skete in Canones, NM points out in a recent article.",5,A spiritual and cinema tic triumph!,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,1889,"['Pavel', 'Lungin', 'new', 'Russian', 'film', 'OSTROV', 'Island', 'taken', 'Russia', 'storm', 'made', 'quite', 'impression', 'Sundance', 'film', 'Orthodox', 'Christian', 'spirituality', 'really', 'hype', 'appeal', 'very', 'limited.Ostrov', 'worth', 'second', 'time', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'truly', 'profound', 'basic', 'plot', 'Anatoli', 'young', 'Russian', 'boiler-stoker', 'WWII', 'Captured', 'Nazis', 'coward', 'route', 'shoots', 'Captain', 'save', 'Nazis', 'still', 'bow', 'up', 'barge', 'ashore', 'tiny', 'island', 'monastery', 'Barents', 'Sea', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'Father', 'Anatoli', 'madman-boiler', 'stoker', 'near-Saint', 'who', 'can', 'heal', 'who', 'things', 'Father', 'Anatoli', 'still', 'repenting', 'seeking', 'God', 'infinite', 'forgiveness', 'theological', 'crux', 'film', 'free', 'grace/cost-of-discipleship', 'paradox', 'spiritual', 'conundrum', 'hardly', 'unique', 'Orthodox', 'Christianity', 'Pious', 'Lutherans', 'will', 'recall', 'Nazi-executed', 'Minster/Theologian', 'Deitrich', 'Bonhoeffer', 'book', 'Cost', 'Discipleship', 'instance.Anatoli', 'uses', 'gifts', 'be', 'Fool', 'Christ', 'who', 'humility', 'can', 'identify', 'prideful', 'sins', 'others', 'Father', 'Job', 'vanity', 'book', 'learning', 'Father', 'Filaret', 'covetousness', 'etc', 'being', 'Fool', 'Christ', 'more', 'understood', 'Orthodoxy', 'concept', 'west', 'witness', 'Blasillo', 'el', 'Bobo', 'classic', 'Spanish', 'novel', 'Manuel', 'Bueno', 'Martir', 'Unamuno.The', 'acting', 'Ostrov', 'superb', 'casting', 'subtle', 'sublime', 'cinematography', 'wide-screen', 'monochromatic', 'stunning.This', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'spirituality', 'repentance.A', 'final', 'note', 'message', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'OSTROV', 'splendid', 'reproach', 'quick-fix', 'society', 'spiritual', 'quick-fix', 'Father', 'John', 'Hieromonk', 'St.', 'Michael', 'Skete', 'Canones', 'NM', 'out', 'recent', 'article']","Ostrov (The Island), NTSC version with English subtitles"

They simply don't get it!  The film is not meant to be a documentary nor a treatise. It just tells the story of one Monk, Anatoly, and his personal struggle/journey and how despite his own pasts and sins he is able to bring God's mercy to others. That's what made me love this film. When I watched Anatoly praying the Jesus Prayer and saw his various reactions and emotions, I totally got it because that's how I feel when I pray the prayer, too! Those who are trying to politicize this film don't get it. I think this movie transcends politics, nations and nationalities. It comes down to maintaining faith regardless of the circumstances or the people surrounding us.  Anyone who has found the richness of Orthodox Christianity will get it...and love it! If anything, this film shows us that despite the attempts of the former Soviet Union to stamp out God and religion in the Russian people, the faith continued and survived, and that's because of monks/""holy fools"" like Antatoly...and the ordinary folks they ministered to who kept the faith in their hearts.",5,An absolutely beautiful video.
