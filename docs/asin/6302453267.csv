On the brink of a nuclear catastrophe, a woman (Solveig Dommartin), disenchanted with her boyfriend (Sam Neill) is involved in a car accident with two bank robbers. Along comes William Hurt, who steals some of the heist money (and her car) from Dommartin, who in turn gets angry enough about it to track Hurt down. This leads to an around-the-world chase, which is the most exciting part of the movie. But then everyone ends up in the Australian outback, and this is where the deadly brick wall sets in. In the desert Hurt's parents, Max von Sydow and Jeanne Moreau, are involved with video technology that allows the blind (Moreau) to see and also for people to see their dreams. What a let down! The action comes to a dead halt and our interest sags, if not dies, with it.

So be it.I was looking for a unique film that I hadn't seen before, and from the glowing 5-star reviews throughout this page I thought this would be such a film.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close.  Long and boring with improbable  (no, impossible...no, incredulous) situations, this mess never made me care  for any of the characters, especially the two lead characters.  Did I  mention that it was loooonnnnnggggg?To say that this isn't my type of  movie would be a gross understatement.  Everything, and I mean everything,  seemed contrived to the point of being ridiculous.  As the title indicates,  this story is based upon everyones' fear of impending doom as a nuclear  platform's orbit decays.  Funny thing is, except for the narrator stating  this on several occasions, no one in the film really seemed to care one way  or another (nor did I, since it wouldn't detonate the nuclear warheads  anyway).  Add to that, the impossible crossing of paths of cardboard  characters, and one is left with nothing but a jumbled mess.  How probable  is the following?:1.  Two cars crash on an empty, open road (going in  the same direction, no less) and immediately the occupants become so  friendly that they trust each other and an oddball woman with millions of  dollars of stolen loot.2.  Two strangers meet at a line of telephones  and there is immediate attraction...to the point that the female follows  this guy all over the world (this is where the travel log comes in).3.  Two of the characters are hunting the protagonist (bounty hunters?), but  both are so comedic that the viewer feels absolutely no threat from either  of them (actually, I was hoping they would kill the protagonist, but  alas...).4.  The future (uh, 1999) looks like 60's plastic  art-deco.5.  The continuous narration was as mindless as the film.I  could go on and on, but this film doesn't merit any more wasted time.  The  only positive note is that some of the locals were quite nice, and Max von  Sydow is always solid.  If you want to see this film because of all the  positive reviews, I suggest that you rent it first.

Of course, my first thought is: ""Man, I've got to watch Until the End of the World. Wim, you're a prophet!""But now I am struck with the dilemma: do I watch the 5-hour version I have on DVD, or do I watch the 2 hour version I have on a scrappy old VHS tape? I didn't need to consider it very long; I much prefer the 2-hour (short) version, and here's why.There is one scene which I consider critical to the mood and poetry of the film. It is possibly the greatest, most emotion-evoking scene I have ever witnessed. And inexplicably, it is missing from the 5-hour (long) version. If you've seen the theatrical (short) version, you know what I'm talking about; it's the climactic ""end of the world scene"" with Peter Gabriel's 'Blood of Eden' playing. I get chills just thinking about it. And this scene exists only on the short version.Wim Wenders has harshly criticized the short version, calling it ""unwatchable"" and ""the Reader's Digest version"". But I believe he is swayed by artists' arrogance. Apparently there was a bitter feud surrounding the cutting of his 5-hour epic, and Wim resents it to this day. But to us, the objective audience, we can see that the short version came out much more lucid, focused and poetic in its simplicity. And, whether by serendipity or unconscious design, certain scenes like the ""end of the world"" scene were ironically augmented by their edits.I could ramble on longer about how brevity is often superior to verbosity, but that would clash with the verbosity of my post which I admit is already too bloated and overinflated with redundant phrases like ""bloated and overinflated."" Heh.I wish someone would edit this post down to a manageable 2 paragraphs, condense it, distill it, focus it and make it more powerful in its simplicity.

313558,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6302453267,Poor Napoleon,"[1, 1]","Wim Wenders established himself as the quintessential art house foreign film director in the 1980s.  He had his critically claimed road movies and the well loved ""Wings of Desire"" under his belt.  His style is hard to pin point, but if there is one word that could be used, it is exploration.  Whether it be in travels or in the human condition, it is something that his characters do.  ""Until the End of the World"" epitomizes exploration, and consequently, begs for repeat viewings.The title itself holds so many meanings.  There are two literal ones.  The first being that the film involves a chase around the world for the elusive William Hurt character.  The second being the fear that the world would end at the turn of the millenium.But that doesn't even begin to scratch the clever layering of meaning within the film.  Wenders loves exploring the depth of the characters, even after the chase is over, he lets us visit with them a little longer.  While we're doing that, the characters are going deeper and deeper in trying explore themselves through the use of devices that allow people to see their dreams.  And we do get to see this in the American 158 minute version.  Although this is regarded by the director as a heavily truncated version of his vision, it's still highly watchable and entertaining.The film is also notable for it's interesting look and concept.  Wenders isn't venturing too far into the future here, but places subtle glimpses of what he felt it might look 9 years from when the film was made in 1991.  He actually does a credible job and shows a genuine curiosity for science in this film.This also boasts one of the best soundtracks period.  Wenders has had some allegiances with some great bands or artists over the years.  Included here are prominent Wenders collaboraters U2 and Nick Cave as well as a number of alternative icons like R.E.M., Elvis Costello, and the wonderful score by the nearly infallible Graeme Revelle.The structure of the film can be very off putting for the regular film goer and I must admit that when I first watched it, it through me for a loop.  Wenders is not satisfied with giving you merely a human drama or action story and is known for shifting gears in his films.  What starts as cat and mouse chase story shifts into an exploration of the human condition through the use of dreams, looking into people's obsession with them.  It makes for an odd watch that if you are pleased with, you might have another go round.This is an excellent movie surely worthy of another look and possibly a DVD release.  It wasn't well understood when it came out and Wenders grand idea probably wasn't ready for the US quite yet.  I'd be willing to give this film another while, be it the 158 minute version or 280 minute trilogy version available in other regions.

313561,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,6302453267,Steffan Piper,"[110, 114]","This film, Until the End of the World (UTTEOTW), has long been called the ultimate road movie or even the greatest road movie ever made. Sometimes when I read stuff like that I cringe and think that this film is far greater than that and calling it a road movie does it a sort of disservice.  I've watched this film probably hundreds of times (hate to admit) and in every different format available and have weighed this film, measured this film and only found myself wanting to see it again.Sure, the film spans 15 cities and 7 different countries and has more story arcs than Los Angeles has McDonalds but the more I watch the film the more I feel that this is less of a road movie and more of a biopic of the fictitious would-be scientist, Sam Faber and his over-bearing family.I feel that UTTEOTW is a much greater contribution to modern film then most are willing to admit and could quite possibly be one of the greatest films ever made. This film has the same kind of public ground swell audience that Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz and Blade Runner have. All these movies preformed badly in the box office but are seen as some of best cinema that man or woman has been able to bring forward.UTTEOTW has been seen by many to be a failure of sorts because of the immense runtime and the resolution set in Australia that is almost an entire third of the film, in all versions. It seems, historically now, that the studio execs thought that it would be inappropriate to subject any audience to five hours of film and that the American audience was too daft and wouldn't buy the whole concept, thus kicking off the mess that the film has gone through for almost twenty years now. Yes, it has been almost that long now.The film in different edits, according to lore, has gone from a 20 hour version, that Wim Wenders had vehemently held position on for almost six months before acquiescing to releasing a `meager' 8 hour version and then later produced a 5 hour version. He was horrified when the studio forced a 151 minute version that he looks back at in complete disdain and refers to as the `Readers Digest version' and has stated that it is `unwatchable'. I don't know about the 8 and 20 hour version and which is better, because I and many others have not seen it, but I have seen the 5 hour version many times and now look at it as vastly superior (in presentation) to the theatrical release, but the theatrical release is far from unwatchable and is actually the version that the majority of the audience is familiar with and enjoy.Wenders suffers from the same ills as Ridley Scott does, as he sees his films his way and not the way the world sees them, and that's perfectly fine. Ridley Scott doesn't like the Harrison Ford `Philip Marlowe' narration while an immense group of the fans loved it, myself included. Wenders doesn't like the theatrical release while most of the world is awed by it.So, when the audience did see this film, it was the beginning of a new decade and Wenders, like Werner Herzog or David Lynch, had built up a core audience of supporters worldwide that appreciated his films for storytelling, the movement and the sheer reverence that seemed to manifest on screen. UTTEOTW came out at probably the very beginning of the emergence of the modern independent film movement that has now firmly taken over the industry. Even though they had budgeted $23 Million dollars for production, a lot of the funds came because of the acclaim given to Wings of Desire again with Solveig Dommartin, but the money didn't necessarily make this film the typical large-budget studio film that others were producing around the same time for the same funds when this came out. A quick search of movies released in 1991 shows an abysmal year aside from Jonathan Demme's masterpiece `Silence of the Lambs'.This movie is undoubtedly Wenders greatest work, and I have watched every film he's put out - before and since. Sometimes I see glimpses of this film in his other works and can tell that this film's reception in the world still weighs heavily on his mind. Like Al Gore, he's traveled the globe giving lectures with his film and has his own ideas about its impact and what more can be done. It seems that some of the legal battles may never go away, specifically the ones that are associated with Warner Brothers.Recently, a Region 2 PAL version was released into the market, and when I watched it I could tell it probably didn't have the stamp of approval from WB. The quality shows it to be almost a straight VHS transfer from a low-end computer system which puts a lot of visual noise on the screen and in the audio. Some people who have purchased this version have complained, but really I don't see anything wrong with it as it's just a full-frame DVD that will suffice for now for those looking for the 158 min on DVD.My recommendation when it comes to versions is to purchase the 3 Disc Director's Cut set from Amazon.co.uk and just live with the fact that the first fifteen minutes of dialogue that's had with Solveig and Chico are in French with no subtitles. If you watch the film you can pretty much get the gist of what's being said anyways, Chico needs more beer, he likes the Beatles, sex and Solveig tells you how much you can buy a goat for in Ethiopia.I had read in January of 2007 that Solveig had died of heart failure and was deeply saddened as I found her to be an incredibly unique talent and hypnotizing to see on the big screen. I would have loved to have seen her star in a few more films and even break back into the American marketplace. What a shame she's now gone, she'll be missed for sure.I've put a list of all the different versions below, that are available and that I own, so you could get an idea of what's going on with this movie and its debacle of a distribution:1991 VHS Tape Theatrical Release 158 mins1991 R2 Samsung Japanese Laserdisc 179 mins2004 PAL R2 Italian 3 Disc Set 280 mins2004 PAL R2 UK 3 Disc Set Director's Cut 280 mins2007 PAL R2 UK 1 Disc VHS Transfer 158 minsRegarding the last release, I recently discovered that the difference in the run-time is due to PAL speed-up adjusting it 4%, from 158 mins to 151 mins.For those in America interested in seeing these films but are worried about the DVD Regions / PAL difference. Don't fret because there are some very easy ways to set your DVD player to Region 0 which will make your player Region free and you can watch all movies from around the world. Videohelp dot com has most players remote codes which will help you easily make the adjustment. I've changed all my players this way and have been happy ever since.",5,My real name is Samuel Farber ...,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,6635,"['film', 'End', 'World', 'UTTEOTW', 'long', 'been',

Those who love film will feel bits and pieces of Once Upon the Time in the West, Claire's Knee (and most other New Wave films), Bergman (Ingrid and Ingmar) and on and on. It would take many viewings to tease out the complex web of annotations. And then, you would have to do it again for the various versions of the film that have been released over the years, each one longer than the last. However, if you are a lover of Rohmer you will be happy. My advice for the first timer is not to watch so seriously, but to just let it play on a lazy Sunday afternoon and relax. Maybe work a jigsaw puzzle while you watch it.

It is a mixture of apocalyptic fears, anti-technology, dream interpretation, and addiction, which involves an international cast of characters and leaps from continent to continent at a dizzying pace. The plot is more than a little confusing, but essentially deals with Solveig Dommartin's character searching for William Hurt, who could (or could not) be an international industrial spy.  Sam Neill plays Dommartin's boyfriend, and to say that their relationship is an open one is an understatement...  The last quarter of the film drags...  I would recommend it, but at over 2 1/2 hours long, it requires concentration and patience.  However, you rarely get an opportunity to view films this creative, so it is worth seeing.",3,"Interesting and Intriguing, But By the End, Will It End?",969926400,"09 26, 2000",2000,834,"['Wim', 'Wenders', 'quot', 'End', 'World', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'mixture', 'apocalyptic', 'fears', 'anti-technology', 'dream', 'interpretation', 'addiction', 'international', 'cast', 'characters', 'leaps', 'continent', 'continent', 'dizzying', 'pace', 'plot', 'more', 'little', 'confusing', 'essentially', 'deals', 'Solveig', 'Dommartin', 'character', 'searching', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'could', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'international', 'industrial', 'spy', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Dommartin', 'boyfriend', 'say', 'relationship', 'open', 'one', 'understatement', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'drags', 'would', 'recommend', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'concentration', 'patience', 'However', 'rarely', 'get', 'opportunity', 'view', 'films', 'creative', 'worth', 'seeing']",Until the End of the World VHS
313564,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302453267,Trevor Willsmer,"[8, 10]","There's a curious symmetry to seeing a film set eight years in a future that's now eight years in the past, but the 279-minute director's cut of Wim Wenders' Continent-hopping sci-fi road movie Until the End of the World feels more like a notebook with the odd doodle in the margin rather than a clearly thought-out film, never getting to grips with any of the themes or ideas it throws up and casually abandons along the way. Words versus images (surprisingly Wenders comes down firmly on the power of the word), art versus technology, impulse versus commitment, the struggle to find meaning in the places you find yourself and people's ability to constantly start over, be it in art, science or life - none get much more than a cursory once-over as it becomes ever clearer that Wenders' destination is more geographical than thematic.Set in a still far-off 1999, when America's plans to shoot an out of control nuclear satellite out of the sky lead to mild economic and social chaos as the possibility of a chain reaction and the end of the world looms, it's something of a shaggy dog story following Solveig Dommartin's bored party girl across four continents. Surviving a car crash, she looks for a mission in the new life she has been given and finds it in the form of William Hurt's fugitive, who steals some stolen money she's holding for Chick Ortega and Eddy Mitchell's robbers. Following him across the globe with the aid of Rudiger Vogler's private eye and followed herself by her ex and the film's narrator (Sam Neill) and Ernie Dingo's bounty hunter, several countries and a couple of aliases later she discovers he's recording images of his family for his blind mother (Jeanne Moreau) with a camera that allows the blind to see that was developed by his father (Max Von Sydow), in hiding from the US government in Australia...As long as the film is moving from city to city, Wenders is able to sustain some semblance of the illusion of forward motion, but the film stops dead in its tracks when it reaches Australia, which is a big problem. Not only is the end of the world still a long way off, but so is the end of the film - with more than two hours to go it's hard to disguise the fact that there's not much to show for all the mileage covered. If anything, it feels a bit like a long business trip to a place you've never been with people from your office only to find that your appointment's been postponed once you finally arrive, but since the hotel room's already paid for you find yourself sticking around for a day or so anyway killing time. The film does get back on track in the last half hour as the characters become addicted to their own dreams and become completely unable to cope with reality, but you can't help feeling it could have got there a lot quicker.While Neill, Vogler and Hurt fare well enough and Von Sydow has one good scene, co-scenarist and leading lady Solveig Dommartin makes a poor focus for such a sprawling endeavour. Another in that long line of muses - Catherine Hessling, Cybill Shepherd, Sondra Locke - luring once great directors onto the rocks with their siren call of mediocrity, she's not much of an actress with little screen presence to compensate, while her English delivery doesn't do her many favours. It's telling that one of her best scenes is a (presumably) deliberately awful but surprisingly charming rendition of Thank You For the Days accompanied by piano, drums and didgeridoo that makes up with enthusiasm what it lacks in ability. Still, compared to Adelle Lutz's horrendously awkward phonetic delivery as her best friend Makiko, she's Sarah Bernhardt.But no film with a hero called Trevor can be all bad, and for all the self-indulgence there are enough good points to keep you watching. Some of Neill's narration is rather good (possibly down to co-writer Peter Carey), there's an eclectic soundtrack that takes in Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Lou Reed, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, R.E.M., Elvis Costello and pompous soft-rockers U2 among many others, Robby Muller's cinematography is typically impressive and the film makes the outskirts of San Francisco look like a Third World shantytown. Some of the predictions were at least in the right ballpark - satnav systems, the Americans shooting a rogue satellite out of the sky and a joke about the Rolling Stones' 'last' concert - and it only gives into outright xenophobia in a horribly misconceived comic scene in a Japanese hotel. Yet the film is definitely less than the sum of its parts, with Wenders all too clearly going all Hearts of Darkness as he constantly seems to rework the slim premise into whatever latest brainwave has just struck him - with an African epilogue unfilmed, if the producers hadn't pulled the plug he'd probably still be shooting to this day. (As it is, the German DVD has another half hour of deleted scenes and outtakes and it wouldn't be entirely surprising if Wenders delivered an even longer cut some time in the future.)
