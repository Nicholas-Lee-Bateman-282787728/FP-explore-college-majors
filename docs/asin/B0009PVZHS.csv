910619,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0009PVZHS,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","Green Graves only dreams of becoming a special make-up effects artist for the movies, but his dreams are shattered by an abusive stepfather and the disenchanting denizens of his small Southern town. Renown special effects artist Robert Hall delivers this powerful fictionalization of his own childhood experiences in the 2004 drama, LIGHTNING BUG. Hall speaks with raw emotion through his heartfelt characters, painting a tragic true-to-life tale that is equally inspiring. This could not be achieved without the help of his incredible cast, led by Bret Harrison and Kevin Gage. Harrison loses himself in his character, bringing his full range to the role of Green. He could only be overshadowed by Kevin Gage as the monstrous Earl Knight, who presses his terrifying strength and oppressive control over Green and his family. Gage is more frightening in all of his drunken rage than any man or monster in the genre. Laura Prepon, Ashley Laurence, Hal Sparks, and Lucas Till provide stunning support as well, and help to sell the realism of the desperate small town condition. A great debt is also owed to Brandon Trost, Joshua Charson, Rob Prior, and the rest of the talented crew, who make Green's reality our own. LIGHTNING BUG has a reach that expands well beyond the genre, but Horror fans in particular will empathize intimately with Green's personal struggle in an unaccepting society. This is Robert Hall's love letter to movie making, and his own personal masterpiece beyond the realm of make-up and special effects.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Lightning Bug,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1555,"['Green', 'only', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'special', 'make-up', 'effects', 'artist', 'movies', 'dreams', 'are', 'shattered', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'disenchanting', 'denizens', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'Renown', 'special', 'effects', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Hall', 'powerful', 'fictionalization', 'own', 'childhood', 'experiences', '2004', 'drama', 'LIGHTNING', 'BUG', 'Hall', 'raw', 'emotion', 'heartfelt', 'characters', 'painting', 'tragic', 'true-to-life', 'tale', 'equally', 'inspiring', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'achieved', 'help', 'incredible', 'cast', 'led', 'Bret', 'Harrison', 'Kevin', 'Gage', 'Harrison', 'character', 'bringing', 'full', 'range', 'role', 'Green', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'Kevin', 'Gage', 'monstrous', 'Earl', 'Knight', 'who', 'terrifying', 'strength', 'oppressive', 'control', 'Green', 'family', 'Gage', 'more', 'frightening', 'drunken', 'rage', 'man', 'monster', 'genre', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Lucas', 'Till', 'provide', 'stunning', 'support', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'sell', 'realism', 'desperate', 'small', 'town', 'condition', 'great', 'debt', 'also', 'owed', 'Brandon', 'Trost', 'Joshua', 'Charson', 'Rob', 'Prior', 'rest', 'talented', 'crew', 'who', 'make', 'Green', 'reality', 'own', 'LIGHTNING', 'BUG', 'reach', 'well', 'genre', 'Horror', 'fans', 'particular', 'will', 'empathize', 'intimately', 'Green', 'personal', 'struggle', 'unaccepting', 'society', 'Robert', 'Hall', 'love', 'letter', 'movie', 'making', 'own', 'personal', 'masterpiece', 'realm', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Lightning Bug
910620,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0009PVZHS,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 5]","Truth doesn't necessarily make for a good movie. This movie has a lot of champions. I'm not one of them.Here's the scoop. Green Graves is moving, with his mom and younger brother, from Detroit to Alabama. Mom wants to start a new life and Green wants to become a special effects artist in Hollywood. That road is more difficult than he would have imagined.I found this a very mean spirited movie. Most of the characters are nasty in any number of ways. And they are written in many of the cliches bandied around about the Southern U.S. They are incestuous, drunk, self righteous, bible thumping, ignorant trailer trash. Mom wants to start a new life, but the first male she hooks up with is a woman beating drunk who holds a mean, iron fist over the household. Green is learning his craft but is considered evil by the local religious folk because of it and it causes him great harm. He falls for a local girl (Laura Prepon) who has her own problems and has a mother who is such a good Christian she'll lie to the authorities to get Green thrown in jail. She is so religious shell bust up his haunted house display with a sledge hammer. This is ugly through and through. There are a couple of good souls in this movie, but not enough to balance out the nastiness.This is a low budget film and it should get some commendation that they even got it made but it hurt for me to watch. Some of the acting was good. Some of it was awful. The music was generally pretty awful and the camerawork was pretty bad as well. The lightning bug metaphor was OK I suppose but not enough to help this mess out.This is based on the true story of the writer director. Maybe he should have let someone else handle it.

910623,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009PVZHS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[10, 14]","A hopeful future often travels together with the notion of dreams and aspirations.  This is often depicted out of the perspective of youth seeking a direction on their journey through life.  Often it is a difficult journey, which can even be harder to commence while parents, friends, and other people of various significance begin to affect the decisions of those who are coming of age.  Lightening Bug touches on this very theme in a remarkably clever manner, as it deals with a young man's desire to leave his small Alabama home for a better life elsewhere.A criminal suggestive opening leads the audience into think of why and who are the people involved in the scene.  The identity and motive of the people involved in the wrongdoings are not revealed, but it leaves the audience wondering and thinking.  These notions will leave audience's with an ominous sense of forthcoming trouble, but when and where remains unknown until the appropriate moment when the audience least expects it.  The audience might have the ability to guess why and who is behind the suggestive opening.  However, the director and writer Robert Hall delivers several situations in the film that continue to cloud the audience's judgment and logic to get a clear idea of who and why.  This displays that Hall has thoughtfully put together an intriguing story for the audience.Shortly after the troubling opening, the audience gets to witness Jenny Graves (Ashley Laurence), who many will recognize from Hellraiser (1987), arrive to Alabama from Detroit with her two sons.  Jenny seems to have fled something, which is never revealed, as they arrive to their new home in rural Alabama.  In addition, her older son Green wonders if they can go trick or treating, but Jenny informs her son that they have missed Halloween.  This might suggest why Green later in his late teens has such a fond attachment to this frightful holiday and to horror.The film quickly moves forward into the late adolescence of Green (Bret Harrison), as he turns 18 and has discovered that he has an artistic talent that he uses to create frightful creatures and other horrific creations.  However, most people in his small town seem to be in complete disconnection with the world while Green has to face this ignorance on a daily basis.  Oppression by an abusive stepfather and Christian persecution are some of the difficulties that Green has to struggle with while also thinking of his little brother and mother's well being.  There are many chains that keep Green from beginning to bloom artistically while the greatest of them is misconception and ignorance of people in his environment.In the woods outside Green's trailer home, he can find small lightening bugs that give him a chance to separate himself from the ignorance of the small town.  It also allows him to play and have fun, which provides a chance for hopes and dreams.  Green desires nothing else than to work in the film industry creating monsters and other horrific beasts to create a fright, or scare within the audience.  However, can he break the chains that keep him in the small Alabamian town in which he grew up?Lightening Bug is a small film that completely missed the theaters, but now is released on DVD.  It is fortunate that some of these independent films get an opportunity to be seen, as this one delivers an amusing and intelligent story that deals with coming of age and the social pressures of being a teen.  It also has a mild dose of existentialism, as it addresses the issue of choosing a direction in life.  In one of the opening shots the audience can see a car chose a direction while approaching a fork in the road.  This very scene could symbolize the importance of choosing the right path for oneself, as the individual will only have the opportunity to live the life of oneself.  Thus, it is essential to seize the day, and live a life to the fullest while staying true to oneself.  Lastly, the ill-omened opening continues to linger throughout the film, which adds another intriguing ingredient to the film.",4,Repressive Small Town Convictions in Good Coming of Age Film...,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,4059,"['hopeful', 'future', 'often', 'together', 'notion', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'often', 'depicted', 'perspective', 'youth', 'seeking', 'direction', 'journey', 'life', 'Often', 'difficult', 'journey', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'harder', 'commence', 'parents', 'friends', 'other', 'people', 'various', 'significance', 'begin', 'affect', 'decisions', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'age', 'Lightening', 'Bug', 'touches', 'very', 'theme', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'manner', 'young', 'man', 'desire', 'leave', 'small', 'Alabama', 'home', 'better', 'life', 'elsewhere.A', 'criminal', 'suggestive', 'opening', 'audience', 'think', 'why', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'involved', 'scene', 'identity', 'motive', 'people', 'involved', 'wrongdoings', 'are', 'not', 'revealed', 'audience', 'wondering', 'thinking', 'notions', 'will', 'leave', 'audience', 'ominous', 'sense', 'forthcoming', 'trouble', 'when', 'where', 'unknown', 'appropriate', 'moment', 'when', 'audience', 'least', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'ability', 'guess', 'why', 'who', 'suggestive', 'opening', 'However', 'director', 'writer', 'Robert', 'Hall', 'several', 'situations', 'film', 'continue', 'cloud', 'audience', 'judgment', 'logic', 'get', 'clear', 'idea', 'who', 'why', 'Hall', 'thoughtfully', 'put', 'together', 'intriguing', 'story', 'audience.Shortly', 'troubling', 'opening', 'audience', 'witness', 'Jenny', 'Graves', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'who', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'Hellraiser', '1987', 'arrive', 'Alabama', 'Detroit', 'two', 'sons', 'Jenny', 'have', 'fled', 'something', 'never', 'revealed', 'arrive', 'new', 'home', 'rural', 'Alabama', 'addition', 'older', 'son', 'Green', 'wonders', 'can', 'go', 'trick', 'treating', 'Jenny', 'son', 'have', 'missed', 'Halloween', 'might', 'suggest', 'why', 'Green', 'later', 'late', 'teens', 'fond', 'attachment', 'frightful', 'holiday', 'horror.The', 'film', 'quickly', 'forward', 'late', 'adolescence', 'Green', 'Bret', 'Harrison', '18', 'discovered', 'artistic', 'talent', 'create', 'frightful', 'creatures', 'other', 'horrific', 'creations', 'However', 'most', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'seem', 'be', 'complete', 'disconnection', 'world', 'Green', 'face', 'ignorance', 'daily', 'basis', 'Oppression', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'Christian', 'persecution', 'are', 'difficulties', 'Green', 'struggle', 'while', 'also', 'thinking', 'little', 'brother', 'mother', 'well', 'being', 'are', 'many', 'chains', 'keep', 'Green', 'beginning', 'bloom', 'artistically', 'greatest', 'misconception', 'ignorance', 'people', 'environment.In', 'woods', 'Green', 'trailer', 'home', 'can', 'find', 'small', 'lightening', 'bugs', 'give', 'chance', 'separate', 'ignorance', 'small', 'town', 'also', 'play', 'have', 'fun', 'chance', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'Green', 'desires', 'nothing', 'else', 'work', 'film', 'industry', 'creating', 'monsters', 'other', 'horrific', 'beasts', 'create', 'fright', 'scare', 'audience', 'However', 'can', 'break', 'chains', 'keep', 'small', 'Alabamian', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'Lightening', 'Bug', 'small', 'film', 'completely', 'missed', 'theaters', 'now', 'released', 'DVD', 'fortunate', 'independent', 'films', 'get', 'opportunity', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'amusing', 'intelligent', 'story', 'deals', 'coming', 'age', 'social', 'pressures', 'being', 'teen', 'also', 'mild', 'dose', 'existentialism', 'issue', 'choosing', 'direction', 'life', 'one', 'opening', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'car', 'chose', 'direction', 'approaching', 'fork', 'road', 'very', 'scene', 'could', 'symbolize', 'importance', 'choosing', 'right', 'path', 'oneself', 'individual', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'opportunity', 'live', 'life', 'oneself', 'Thus', 'essential', 'seize', 'day', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'staying', 'true', 'oneself', 'Lastly', 'ill-omened', 'opening', 'linger', 'film', 'intriguing', 'ingredient', 'film']",Lightning Bug

Her character doesn't come in for almost the first twenty minutes, but then she has a solid role the remaining 1 hour and 10. No full nudity from her, but there are some steamy worthwhile scenes. She gives a GREAT performance as well. Talented young lady.On another note, the film is nice. It is a good story of a talented, kind young man and his struggle with living in poverty and in an abusive home. It is the life story of Robert Hall who has done makeup for Teen Wolf and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is definitely a low-budget feel. There are some heart-tugging moments though. I recommend.

He's very good at making horror masks and scary creatures. You can't help but feel for the guy. His mom is...well...white trash. And the people around him are too. The people around him are so cartoonish it bothered me. But they did make them more real as the movie evolved. They became more real and likable. I could feel for his mother at the end.One person besides the main character who was authentic was his girlfriend (acted by Laura Prepon of That '70s Show fame). At times, it seemed as if there are two normal people surrounded by the strange denizens of the small town they live in. Perhaps that was done intentionally.This movie is a fine effort at being unique. It's a drama with touches of comedy and horror. It comes across as a B movie but again I think that was intended to feel that way.",3,A strange but interesting movie,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,900,"['odd', 'well', 'done', 'little', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'become', 'special', 'effects', 'artist', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'horror', 'masks', 'scary', 'creatures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'guy', 'mom', 'well', 'white', 'trash', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'cartoonish', 'bothered', 'did', 'make', 'more', 'real', 'movie', 'evolved', 'became', 'more', 'real', 'likable', 'could', 'feel', 'mother', 'end.One', 'person', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'authentic', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'acted', 'Laura', 'Prepon', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'fame', 'times', 'seemed', 'are', 'two', 'normal', 'people', 'surrounded', 'strange', 'denizens', 'small', 'town', 'live', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'done', 'intentionally.This', 'movie', 'fine', 'effort', 'being', 'unique', 'drama', 'touches', 'comedy', 'horror', 'B', 'movie', 'again', 'think', 'was', 'intended', 'feel', 'way']",Lightning Bug
910631,A2241A3K492SQ0,B0009PVZHS,William Sibick,"[1, 4]","""Lightning Bug"" is a surprisingly good character drama that exposes domestic violence and the struggle of a loveable gang of Southern rejects against their personal demons.  Green Graves family is poor but, it doesn't stop him from practicing his talent.  Angevine Devit's family is rich but the grass isn't so green in her yard either.  It goes to show you that real friends can transend egos and social class.  Green also represents the ""normal"" horror movie viewers.  Jenny Graves, played by Ashley Laurence, really is trying to understand her son.  Funny how she picks up a Fangoria magazine with Hellraiser II on the cover.  Her character broke my heart it was played so well.  Ashley's acting goes far beyond that of Kirsty Cotten of the Hellraiser series.  Her character and acting were very genuine.  It broke my heart to see get her life in order only to have it destroyed. It's all too real.  All the characters were genuine.  That is what makes this film so good.  The actors were very well chosen and the story was very honest. Who knew Laura Prepon would look so hot dressed all gothy... grrrrr. Ashley laurence is still the hottest.  The film goes beyond a good looking cast of good actors.  It's one of the best independant drama's I've seen in a long time.The forshadowing and backtracking sequences could have been edited in better but the films simple story and filming don't take away from the emotions.I have to say if you like emotional dramas, not to unrealistic and stupid like your teen sisters bitchfests, try this film.  Horror fans will find a kin to Green Graves and his desire to work in horror movies and adore Asheley laurence and see her in a new light.8 out of 10.",3,Not all monsters hide in the closet...,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1697,"['Lightning', 'Bug', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'character', 'drama', 'domestic', 'violence', 'struggle', 'loveable', 'gang', 'Southern', 'rejects', 'personal', 'demons', 'Green', 'Graves', 'family', 'poor', ""n't"", 'stop', 'practicing', 'talent', 'Angevine', 'Devit', 'family', 'rich', 'grass', ""n't"", 'so', 'green', 'yard', 'show', 'real', 'friends', 'can', 'transend', 'egos', 'social', 'class', 'Green', 'also', 'normal', 'horror', 'movie', 'viewers', 'Jenny', 'Graves', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Laurence', 'really', 'trying', 'understand', 'son', 'Funny', 'how', 'up', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'Hellraiser', 'II', 'cover', 'character', 'broke', 'heart', 'was', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Ashley', 'acting', 'far', 'Kirsty', 'Cotten', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'character', 'acting', 'were', 'very', 'genuine', 'broke', 'heart', 'see', 'get', 'life', 'order', 'only', 'have', 'destroyed', 'too', 'real', 'characters', 'were', 'genuine', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'honest', 'Who', 'knew', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'would', 'look', 'so', 'hot', 'dressed', 'gothy', 'grrrrr', 'Ashley', 'laurence', 'still', 'hottest', 'film', 'good', 'looking', 'cast', 'good', 'actors', 'one', 'best', 'independant', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'forshadowing', 'backtracking', 'sequences', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'better', 'films', 'simple', 'story', 'filming', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'emotions.I', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'stupid', 'teen', 'sisters', 'bitchfests', 'try', 'film', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'kin', 'Green', 'Graves', 'desire', 'work', 'horror', 'movies', 'adore', 'Asheley', 'laurence', 'see', 'new', 'light.8', '10']",Lightning Bug
