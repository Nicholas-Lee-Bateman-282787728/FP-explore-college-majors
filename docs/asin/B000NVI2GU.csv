Well, having purchased and watched all 3 DVD sets (Amazon delivered my Season 3 preorder early, thank you!), I was able to catch up very quickly.DEADWOOD is, in my humble estimation, the finest piece of television that I have ever been fortunate enough to experience. Right up there with I CLAUDIUS, if I may be so bold. From top to bottom, the show hits on all cylinders. Simply outstanding in all regards, what else can be said.My only regret is, of course, the show being cancelled. If HBO broadcast just 1 new episode of DEADWOOD each month, and ran Green Acres reruns the rest of the time, I would still subscribe without hesitation.As time marches on, the promise of two 2-hour movies seem to be a pipe dream (sad).Not that I watched that much TV before, but after experiencing DEADWOOD I just won't be able to stomach the mindless drivel that passes for entertainment on the major networks.Let us hope that DEADWOOD blazes new trails for future production endeavors - in the meantime, I am so very grateful to have these 36 episodes.",5,"Captivating, Compelling, Consuming",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1151,"['exhortations', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'nonetheless', 'failed', 'catch', 'DEADWOOD', 'when', 'ran', 'HBO', 'Well', 'having', 'purchased', 'watched', '3', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Amazon', 'delivered', 'Season', '3', 'preorder', 'early', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'very', 'quickly.DEADWOOD', 'humble', 'estimation', 'finest', 'piece', 'television', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'experience', 'Right', 'there', 'CLAUDIUS', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'top', 'bottom', 'show', 'cylinders', 'Simply', 'outstanding', 'regards', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said.My', 'only', 'regret', 'course', 'show', 'being', 'cancelled', 'HBO', 'broadcast', 'just', '1', 'new', 'episode', 'DEADWOOD', 'month', 'ran', 'Green', 'Acres', 'rest', 'time', 'would', 'still', 'subscribe', 'hesitation.As', 'time', 'marches', 'promise', 'two', '2-hour', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'pipe', 'dream', 'sad', '.Not', 'watched', 'much', 'TV', 'experiencing', 'DEADWOOD', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stomach', 'mindless', 'drivel', 'entertainment', 'major', 'networks.Let', 'hope', 'DEADWOOD', 'new', 'trails', 'future', 'production', 'endeavors', 'meantime', 'am', 'so', 'very', 'grateful', 'have', '36', 'episodes']",Deadwood: Season 3

1060639,ARA48345JZPZR,B000NVI2GU,Archmaker,"[22, 23]","David Milch's Deadwood in its final (alas) Season 3 is even more eccentric than its predecessors as it delineates the titanic struggle between the scruffy entrepeneurs of Swearengen, Bullock, Starr and Alma Garrett with the ruthless implacability and arbitrariness of unfettered wealth and power as represented by George Hearst.  The language in this Season is even more baroque, circuitous, arcane and delicious as Milch explores the strange nexus between detached Victorian propriety and the profane, muscular and gritty gutter modernity of the mining camp.Likewise, new characters are introduced that provide side stories of no other purpose other than the fun of exploration of new characters and context, most noticeably the acting troupe of Jack Langrishe (the incomparable Brian Cox) as a sort of Greek chorus while allowing an examination of the role of Art in human community.  No doubt, had the series continued, these were storylines for future exploitation.  There is a nice subplot concerning Hostetler, Fields (nice to see Franklyn Ajaye again) and Drunk Steve, the appearance of the morally ambiguous and lethal Earp brothers, and the onslaught of Hearst's army of Pinkertons and their Captain Barrett.  There is the continuing exploration of the harsh and bitter lot of women and the paradoxical and confused relations between the races and the dominant and minority communities, and much much more, all presented with extremely droll and idiosyncratic humor amid occasional eruptions of violence.Frankly, I could write paragraphs on individual subtext stories and performances but I would be preaching to the choir or waxing eloquent to deaf ears.  So, with a nod to the marvelous leads of Tim Olyphant's intemperate, explosive, rigid yet true Seth Bullock (""His holiness, the maniac sheriff""), Ian McShane's towering and oh so humanly complicated rascality as Al Swearengen, and Molly Parker's beautiful and beset Alma Garrett, and now Gerald McRaney's detestable tyrant George Hearst, with apologies for foregoing naming all the wonderful actors of this brilliant ensemble, we bid farewell to the steadfast and reliable Sol Starr, the loyal and courageous Charlie Utter, the beautiful and sorrowful Joanie Stubbs, the vicious and cruel Cy Tolliver, the resilient and fiery Trixie, the threadbare yet noble Doc Cochran, the fawning and pathetic weaselry of EB Farnum, the drunken yet endearing Calamity Jane, and so on.  I could list virtually every player for fine work in creating the complicated characters of Martha Bullock, Ellsworth, Merrick, Dan Dority, Adams, Wu, Johnny, Tom Nuttall, Jarry, Hostetler, Fields, Drunk Steve, Richardson, Aunt Lou, etc.  All the players, central and supporting, did marvelous work.Congratulations to Milch and his production staff and this fine company of actors who brought the complex language, both elevated and earthy, to vibrant life, with wonderful sets and costumes, writing, photography, direction and editing.  A marvelous imagining of characters and place, with intriguing themes of sex and relationships, race and custom, of friendship and isolation, loneliness and community, of ambition and greed coupled with sacrifice and care, and without and within, an all too human fallibility.  I would have welcomed many more Seasons of this complicated and quirky exploration, but it was not to be.  However, as one fine Amazon reviewer put it ""we were lucky to have it at all"", in all its glorious self-indulgence.  This fine effort will be sorely missed by those of us who loved its daring and unique creativity, but at least we can be grateful for its preservation on DVD.

Martin,"[2, 2]","The only quibble that I have with the remarkable third season of HBO's revisionist western is that the series was not picked up for a fourth season which left the rich saga of the corrupt mining town without a sense of closure.  Perhaps someday fans will be rewarded with a resolution to the series, but until that time arrives Deadwood's three season run will rank among the finest television accomplishments of the past decade and of all time.Season three is an improvement over the strong but somewhat unfocused second season which seemed to suffer from the lack of a dominant storyline to keep things moving at a swift pace.  Instead of offering numerous plot threads that didn't quite seem to completely come together, the 12 episodes of this final season are tied together by a power struggle between Al Swearingen,, the camp's power hungry saloon owner, and George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) a ruthless captain of industry who cares only about what resources he can extract from the town using whatever means necessary.  As Hearst, McRaney is a force to be reckoned with.  He gives an amazing performance effortlessly portraying Hearst as a barely controlled volcano of rage capable of erupting at anytime with the slightest provocation.  It takes quite an actor to overshadow McShane's heart of darkness, but McRaney is up to the task.  The tension that he brings to every scene ratchets up the drama and suspense of season three and his presence even lingers in scenes that he is not in.While Hearst dominates the proceedings, the other plotlines take on a stronger sense of relevance and gravity.  Seth Bullock runs for sheriff, his partner runs for mayor, Joni Stubbs and Calamity Jane work towards happier existences, Trixie is torn between her feelings for Sol and her loyalty to Al, Ellsworth and Alma struggle to keep their marriage together and Alma continues to suppress her feelings for Bullock.  All the while the dialogue is as poetic and pungent as ever and acts of violence erupt at the drop of a hat.  It all makes for an exceptional third season and even though things are left unresolved, there is a certain poignancy in the season finale when Al bemoans the desire of one of his underlings to be ""told something pretty"".  Life in Deadwood is extremely difficult and only those who can accept that will make it out alive.

In a sense, the entire season is about the power play between these two titans, with Cy Tolliver trying to edge himself into the mix somewhere and Seth Bullock trying to figure out what his place is in the whole mess.Amongst the other plot threads explored in this season: Jane's growing friendship with the increasingly troubled Joanie Stubbs; Alma's opening a Deadwood bank; the feud between Steve and Hostetler; the oddly touching relationship between Trixie and Sol; Elsworth's marriage to Alma, which may not prove to be the bed of roses he had hoped for; the appearance in town of the Earp brothers, and of a troupe of actors; and, of course, Seth Bullock's ever-present willingness to be grumpy with the wrong person, Farnum's weasly nature, and Merrick's desire to write about it all.The plots don't matter much, though.  The dialogue and the acting are what make this show great.  ""Deadwood,"" in its three seasons, had so many iconic moments that it makes most other shows look like film-school projects in comparison.In addition to the regular cast standouts -- Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, W. Earl Brown, William Sanderson, Brad Dourif, Molly Parker, Powers Boothe, Robin Weigert, and so on, ALL of whom do Emmy-caliber work -- I think special mention needs to go to Gerald McRaney, who turned up right at the end of season two but becomes an integral character in the third.  His portrayal of Hearst is just awesome.  Not that he's better than anyone else on the show; he just immediately fits in with the tone of the show, so much so that it really feels as if his character had been there all along, lurking in the shadows somewhere.Much has been written about the fact that HBO decided to cancel the series, and pretty unexpectedly; but don't fret too much about the show ending on a cliffhanger.  Not all plot points are resolved, but there is at least a sort of closure; it's like the first two seasons, where it feels as if a chapter has ended, but the novel will continue.  Well, it looks like the novel WON'T be continuing -- HBO has claimed that there will be two two-hour movies to wrap things up, but no filming dates seem to have been set, and it's been months since anyone had anything to say about that project -- but if the series has to end with the close of the third season, I won't feel as if I was cheated too terribly badly.  I'd prefer it had run for ten or twelve years, but hey, we're lucky the doggone thing ever even got made.",5,a third season of ridiculously great TV,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,3087,"['Deadwood', 'cup', 'tea', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'then', 'probably', 'have', 'business', 'even', 'considering', 'prchasing', 'DVDs', 'third', 'season', 'i', ""n't"", 'gon', 'change', 'mind', 'cup', 'tea', ""'re"", 'just', 'wondering', 'not', 'third', 'season', 'high', 'marks', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'allow', 'answer', 'cases', 'even', 'them.The', 'third', 'season', 'camp', 'general', 'tizzy', 'upcoming', 'elections', 'mayor', 'sheriff', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'bit', 'more', 'specific', 'tizzy', 'impact', 'arrival', 'George', 'Hearst', 'had', 'life', 'livelihood', 'sense', 'entire', 'season', 'power', 'play', 'two', 'titans', 'Cy', 'Tolliver', 'trying', 'edge', 'mix', 'somewhere', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'place', 'whole', 'mess.Amongst', 'other', 'plot', 'threads', 'explored', 'season', 'Jane', 'growing', 'friendship', 'increasingly', 'troubled', 'Joanie', 'Stubbs', 'Alma', 'opening', 'Deadwood', 'bank', 'feud', 'Steve', 'Hostetler', 'oddly', 'touching', 'relationship', 'Trixie', 'Sol', 'Elsworth', 'marriage', 'Alma', 'may', 'not', 'prove', 'be', 'bed', 'roses', 'had', 'hoped', 'appearance', 'town', 'Earp', 'brothers', 'troupe', 'actors', 'course', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'ever-present', 'willingness', 'be', 'grumpy', 'wrong', 'person', 'Farnum', 'weasly', 'nature', 'Merrick', 'desire', 'write', 'all.The', 'plots', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'though', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'show', 'great', 'Deadwood', 'three', 'seasons', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'iconic', 'moments', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'look', 'film-school', 'projects', 'comparison.In', 'addition', 'regular', 'cast', 'standouts', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'W.', 'Earl', 'Brown', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Robin', 'Weigert', 'so', 'whom', 'do', 'Emmy-caliber', 'work', 'think', 'special', 'mention', 'needs', 'go', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'who', 'turned', 'up', 'right', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'integral', 'character', 'third', 'portrayal', 'Hearst', 'just', 'awesome', 'Not', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'show', 'just', 'immediately', 'tone', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'somewhere.Much', 'been', 'written', 'fact', 'HBO', 'decided', 'cancel', 'series', 'pretty', 'unexpectedly', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'ending', 'cliffhanger', 'Not', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'resolved', 'least', 'sort', 'closure', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'where', 'chapter', 'ended', 'novel', 'will', 'continue', 'Well', 'novel', 'WO', ""N'T"", 'be', 'continuing', 'HBO', 'claimed', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'two-hour', 'movies', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'filming', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'been', 'months', 'anyone', 'had', 'anything', 'say', 'project', 'series', 'end', 'close', 'third', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'cheated', 'too', 'terribly', 'badly', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'had', 'run', 'ten', 'twelve', 'years', 'hey', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'doggone', 'thing', 'ever', 'even', 'got', 'made']",Deadwood: Season 3

1060656,A3K1JFYC9KOVV5,B000NVI2GU,CB,"[0, 0]","It is unfortunate that this third season of Deadwood had to be its last, but this hard-hitting cowboy drama rides off into the sunset in style in every way.Season three picks up some weeks after the end of the second season. With the First Bank of Deadwood opening under the aegis of local mining magnate Alma Ellsworth, the camp and the surrounding community are preparing for their first elections - with Seth Bullock and Sol Star running for sheriff and mayor, respectively. At the same time, however, the specter of the camp's latest resident, half-mad robber baron George Hearst, looms large, as he stretches out his hands in an effort to take the camp - and its wealth - for himself. As a result, Sweringen and Cy Tolliver play a dangerous game of politics with Hearst and the camp in an effort to keep themselves, their dependents, and their interests afloat in a sea of increasingly brutal intrigue. On other notes: a company of classical players come to town, the camp acquires a new school, and a tragic dispute ensues over ownership of the local livery stable.Ian McShane is as brilliant as ever as Al Sweringen, a darkly sympathetic figure who exhibits harrowing ruthlessness and light pathos in equal measure; he is the character one always counts on, and McShane does not disappoint. Timothy Olyphant's Bullock is as hard-bitten and angry as ever, but seems to mellow in this season, adjusting himself to married life. The real treat of the season, however, is Gerald McRaney's (TV's ""Major Dad"") portrayal of George Hearst. A rough-hewn figure of the Gilded Age, Hearst is a violent, cruel, and brilliant counterpoint (and counterpart) to Sweringen's more backwoods boss figure. Hearst wears gentility and streetsmart bravado in equal measure, barely masking a mad and insatiable lust for power that reveals itself in unsettling subtle, silently explosive ways.As ever, the show is well-acted and brilliantly designed; costumes and sets remain impeccable. While certain of the secondary plots fail or ring hollow, he overall thrust of the season is fast-paced, raw, and scintillating. For fans of the series, this is truly a fitting end.

So we tend to get through an entire season in three or four consecutive nights - the only way to do it. After waiting months for Season Three, we were thrilled to find that it generally lived up to expectations - the same well-written three-dimensional characters brought to life by a first-rate cast, the gritty realism of the sets and costumes, the complex plots, and the realistically vulgar yet almost poetic dialogue. One of the best series we've seen for a very long time.Having said that, Season Three somehow doesn't have quite the bite and edge of the first two seasons. It may be because that level of excellence is so difficult to sustain or it could be the result of too much tinkering. Subplots and new characters are all very well, but only if they add something to the whole. But some of Season Three seems to be just filler. It was very difficult to care about the eventual ownership of the livery stable, or about the son of Hearst's cook arriving from Liberia, or about an elderly dying actor. Things like the theatre troupe seemed an unnecessary distraction from the main characters and their interactions. And, as a result, some of the more interesting characters such as the Doc and the odious Farnum are pushed to the sidelines (Richardson seems to have more to do than his employer). Cy Tolliver might just as well have died of his wounds for all the impact he has. The Joanie/Jane romance seems contrived at best while Trixie and Martha Bullock seem to be mostly marking time while waiting for the finale. Meanwhile, the Chinese have all but disappeared (Wu's pigs are mentioned but not seen), the prostitutes are largely confined to the background, and passion seems to have become a rare commodity.Fortunately, Bullock and Swearengen remain largely unchanged and it is still these two marvellous characters who drive everything and make Deadwood the special experience that it is. Ian McShane's performance in particular is worth the price of the DVD's.

I have to say I was a little disappinted in the ending of the third season.  By the way, do not read further if you have not seen the show yet...  The whole third season is pretty much a build-up to what is going to happen with Hearst.  The suspense builds but in the end, nothing happens.  Hearst comes into camp, disrespects everyone (including people you never thought would be allowed to be treated like that), kills people, makes himself hated by everyone, and then he casually leaves leaves camp with no repercussions.  I guess this is actually the most realistic scenario.  Al, Bullock, etc. are looking toward the future of the camp and their own lives, even if it means suffering some injustices and indignities from Hearst.  Sure they could kill Hearst, but would themselvse and the camp be able to handle the repercussions from that?  It makes sense.  But for a tv show, you wanna see revenge.  I wanted to see Heasrt killed!  It was very anti-climactic.  But all in all, still a great show.I love some of the characters from the show but some are very annoying.  Characters I like are Al, EB Farnham, Sy Toliver, Dan, Richardson, Elsworth, Jule, Wu, Johnny and Bullock (sometimes).  Characters who I didnt care for as much are Sol and Trixie (their relationship is annoying how she is constantly yelling at him), Jane (constantly wasted and screaming and everyone), Doc Cochran (always so stressed out and agitated), Mrs Garret/Elsworth, Mrs Bullock.  I also have to say the character of George Heasrt is a beast, well played as he really makes you hate him.One other thing I would mention is there seem to be unneccesary story-lines that are boring and go nowhere.  For example, the theatre people who come to town.  It seems like it has no importance or purpose in the show, and the scenes regarding this storyline are boring.  There are numerous little storylines that go off in different directions that seem to have no purpose, but I guess it is just simply showing a wider spectrum of different events and happenings of the camp.",4,Deadwood Season 3,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2081,"['liked', 'Deadwood', '3', 'seasons', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'disappinted', 'ending', 'third', 'season', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'further', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'yet', 'whole', 'third', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'build-up', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Hearst', 'suspense', 'builds', 'end', 'nothing', 'happens', 'Hearst', 'camp', 'everyone', 'including', 'people', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'be', 'treated', 'people', 'hated', 'everyone', 'then', 'casually', 'leaves', 'camp', 'repercussions', 'guess', 'actually', 'most', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'Al', 'Bullock', 'etc', 'are', 'looking', 'future', 'camp', 'own', 'lives', 'even', 'suffering', 'injustices', 'indignities', 'Hearst', 'Sure', 'could', 'kill', 'Hearst', 'would', 'themselvse', 'camp', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'repercussions', 'sense', 'tv', 'show', 'wan', 'see', 'revenge', 'wanted', 'see', 'Heasrt', 'killed', 'was', 'very', 'anti-climactic', 'still', 'great', 'show.I', 'love', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'very', 'annoying', 'Characters', 'like', 'are', 'Al', 'EB', 'Farnham', 'Sy', 'Toliver', 'Dan', 'Richardson', 'Elsworth', 'Jule', 'Wu', 'Johnny', 'Bullock', 'sometimes', 'Characters', 'who', 'didnt', 'care', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'Sol', 'Trixie', 'relationship', 'annoying', 'how', 'constantly', 'yelling', 'Jane', 'constantly', 'wasted', 'screaming', 'everyone', 'Doc', 'Cochran', 'always', 'so', 'stressed', 'out', 'agitated', 'Mrs', 'Garret/Elsworth', 'Mrs', 'Bullock', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'character', 'George', 'Heasrt', 'beast', 'well', 'played', 'really', 'hate', 'him.One', 'other', 'thing', 'would', 'mention', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'unneccesary', 'story-lines', 'are', 'boring', 'go', 'nowhere', 'example', 'theatre', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'importance', 'purpose', 'show', 'scenes', 'regarding', 'storyline', 'are', 'boring', 'are', 'numerous', 'little', 'storylines', 'go', 'off', 'different', 'directions', 'seem', 'have', 'purpose', 'guess', 'just', 'simply', 'showing', 'wider', 'spectrum', 'different', 'events', 'happenings', 'camp']",Deadwood: Season 3

This series was great once you got passed the language; both the severe cursing and  the actual way the characters spoke during this series. You had to really concentrate to understand what they were saying. Once you got past that, it was a really interesting take on the wild west. I was really disappointed as this 3rd set was obviously the last as it was patched together in a rather quick format to get everything in as this was it.  One needn't have had to second guess that this was the last season and to listen to the producer tell you so in the out-takes the season was canceled! ...aka added extra's on the DVD. I feel this 3rd set could have been finished off better if the producers had more time and in fact, produced an additional season 4! It's a real shame this was rushed under pressure; you could tell as time was of the essence. The other thing I really didn't care for was the packaging of this DVD set. It came in a book size enclosure which housed the DVD's.  I purchased my first two boxed DVD sets at Walmart and I noticed the first season came in two choices; a book type and a regular slipcase package which housed the actual DVD's. I elected to purchase the regular slipcase packaging for the first 2 boxed sets. Sounds trivial but such was the case (at least from Amazon). Conclusion? You'll purchase the 3rd DVD set regardless, once you get into Deadwood (season 1 or 2), but be prepared for a let down once you get into Season 3 and it's NOT the actual story, but how it's compressed (aka rushed) to complete an actually great series.

By all means watch all 3 seasons (36 episodes) for the sake of completeness, but in my opinion Season 1 is the best, whereas the quality and freshness of the shows drop somewhat in Season 2, and drop precipitously in Season 3.It is obvious that by Season 3 the writers lost interest in the concept, the series, the West, and the town of Deadwood, and ran out of cogent plot ideas. In Season 3 we find extended scenes devoted to a man (Ellsworth) talking to his dog, a theater group and their internal politics, and a  romance between Madame Joanie Stubbs & Calamity Jane. These may or may not be interesting stories in themselves, but detract from the thematic unity of the series. Another flaw of Season 3 is that George Hearst dominates the plot, and everyone is afraid of him, but we never get a real idea of why he is so powerful. Nor is it explained how he can live unmolested in the town when he is threatening everyone and is hated by all--even though, at least in Milch&#8217;s Deadwood, men would sooner kill you than shake your hand.David Milch, the creator (& main writer) of the series, has said that in creating Deadwood his underlying interest was exploring how societal structure forms out of chaos and lawlessness, while also presenting an unvarnished revisionist accurate view of the West. He only marginally accomplishes either goal, because he gets distracted by trivial and contrived scenarios and because his vision of the West is just as inaccurate as the vision he attempts to replace.",3,"Watch it, but don't expect the quality of Season 1 (or even Season 2)",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1694,"['watched', 'entire', 'Deadwood', 'series', 'past', 'month', 'rate', '2', 'episodes/night', 'just', 'saw', 'last', '2', 'episodes', '35', '36', 'last', 'night', 'impression', 'series', 'FRESH', 'means', 'watch', '3', 'seasons', '36', 'episodes', 'sake', 'completeness', 'opinion', 'Season', '1', 'best', 'quality', 'freshness', 'shows', 'drop', 'somewhat', 'Season', '2', 'drop', 'precipitously', 'Season', '3.It', 'obvious', 'Season', '3', 'writers', 'lost', 'interest', 'concept', 'series', 'West', 'town', 'Deadwood', 'ran', 'cogent', 'plot', 'ideas', 'Season', '3', 'find', 'extended', 'scenes', 'devoted', 'man', 'Ellsworth', 'talking', 'dog', 'theater', 'group', 'internal', 'politics', 'romance', 'Madame', 'Joanie', 'Stubbs', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'interesting', 'stories', 'detract', 'thematic', 'unity', 'series', 'flaw', 'Season', '3', 'George', 'Hearst', 'plot', 'everyone', 'afraid', 'never', 'get', 'real', 'idea', 'why', 'so', 'powerful', 'explained', 'how', 'can', 'live', 'unmolested', 'town', 'when', 'threatening', 'everyone', 'hated', 'even', 'least', 'Milch', '8217', 'Deadwood', 'men', 'would', 'sooner', 'kill', 'shake', 'hand.David', 'Milch', 'creator', 'main', 'writer', 'series', 'said', 'creating', 'Deadwood', 'underlying', 'interest', 'was', 'exploring', 'how', 'societal', 'structure', 'chaos', 'lawlessness', 'also', 'presenting', 'unvarnished', 'revisionist', 'accurate', 'view', 'West', 'only', 'marginally', 'goal', 'distracted', 'trivial', 'contrived', 'scenarios', 'vision', 'West', 'just', 'as', 'inaccurate', 'vision', 'replace']",Deadwood: Season 3

1060686,AO6WB3ZN5KG67,B000NVI2GU,"George Robinson ""Bartie1""","[15, 16]","I was hooked on Deadwood from the start and in particular absolutely mesmerised by Ian McShane's performance - acting at its absolute finest, perfect timing and pacing of his lines and expressions. Comedy, violence, anger and angst, all delivered in impeccable and perfect pitch - a complete masterclass in the art. And this from the same man who played Lovejoy!The sets were superb, the supporting ensemble pretty good... but unfortunately, by Season 3, it seemed like things were starting to unravel, probably when the director/producers realised the viewing figures were waning, HBO had lost interest and that the end was nigh.Which probably explains why the massive build-up to a climactic showdown never happened - they ran out of budget. Committed to a set number of shows for the rest of the season, they just stretched it out to fill. A massive anti-climax and disappointment, and an affront to the show's loyal fans.Hearst arrived and everything was building up to some sort of epic confrontation. Hired guns arriving in town, Mr Wu fetching his army of Chinese from San Francisco... I thought we were going to go out in an epic blaze of glory.Instead, we had characters standing around agonising on what to do next, marching around from one building to another, doing the odd Shakespearean-style soliloquoy, indulging in embarrassing lesbian scenes (Calamity Jane must rank as the most irritating and unwatchable character in any TV series) and all manner of other pointless and dull interludes.Meanwhile key characters from Seasons 1 and 2, like Sy Tolliver, became sidelined in Series 3, characters going nowhere and with no real motives or objectives in life.Tolliver spends most of Series 3 standing around ranting and raving, but for reasons which totally escape me. What his purpose was, and what his relationship with Hearst was, all seemed to melt into nothing, so he was reduced to standing on his balcony looking angry and gritting his teeth.All this wouldn't have been so bad, but as the guns massed, the taunts grew, the violence simmered and boiled, the random acts of brutality caused ever more teeth-clenching... what happened? Nothing! Nothing at all! Hearst rode out of town after Bulloch clenched his teeth at him one last time, and that was it! How feeble was that?The whole series just fizzled out, with the election supposed to be some sort of climactic finale. But the significance of the election, or who was standing for what, and why, completely escaped me. It just seemed an irritating, confusing and weakly-scripted diversion in the background, not the major plotline.When the election finally took place, the results were confusingly blurted out in Al's pub by a minor character, nobody seemed bothered by them (including the viewers), or even heard them properly, and the meaning and impact of it had become totally lost, to the point where it hardly seemed to matter.This review gets three stars for Ian McShane's brilliant character acting, for the sets, and for HBO's bravura in putting this ambitious series on in the first place.But it desperately needs some sort of finale, a tying up of loose ends, as some sort of payback for the long hours the loyal fans have put in following it all.Oh, it also gets bonus points for the magnificent horse in the credits (called Bobby, I believe), and for Ellwood's wonderful dog (can anybody supply any more information on him?)",3,Frustrating build-up to absolutely nothing *SPOILER ALERT*,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,3411,"['was', 'hooked', 'Deadwood', 'start', 'particular', 'absolutely', 'mesmerised', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'performance', 'acting', 'absolute', 'finest', 'perfect', 'timing', 'pacing', 'lines', 'expressions', 'Comedy', 'violence', 'anger', 'angst', 'delivered', 'impeccable', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'complete', 'masterclass', 'art', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Lovejoy', 'sets', 'were', 'superb', 'supporting', 'ensemble', 'pretty', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'Season', '3', 'seemed', 'like', 'things', 'were', 'starting', 'unravel', 'probably', 'when', 'director/producers', 'realised', 'viewing', 'figures', 'were', 'waning', 'HBO', 'had', 'lost', 'interest', 'end', 'was', 'nigh.Which', 'probably', 'why', 'massive', 'build-up', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'never', 'happened', 'ran', 'budget', 'Committed', 'set', 'number', 'shows', 'rest', 'season', 'just', 'stretched', 'out', 'fill', 'massive', 'anti-climax', 'disappointment', 'affront', 'show', 'loyal', 'fans.Hearst', 'arrived', 'everything', 'was', 'building', 'up', 'sort', 'epic', 'confrontation', 'Hired', 'arriving', 'town', 'Mr', 'Wu', 'fetching', 'army', 'Chinese', 'San', 'Francisco', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'out', 'epic', 'blaze', 'glory.Instead', 'had', 'characters', 'standing', 'around', 'agonising', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'marching', 'one', 'building', 'doing', 'odd', 'Shakespearean-style', 'soliloquoy', 'indulging', 'embarrassing', 'lesbian', 'scenes', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'must', 'rank', 'most', 'irritating', 'unwatchable', 'character', 'TV', 'series', 'manner', 'other', 'pointless', 'dull', 'interludes.Meanwhile', 'key', 'characters', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Sy', 'Tolliver', 'became', 'sidelined', 'Series', '3', 'characters', 'going', 'nowhere', 'real', 'motives', 'objectives', 'life.Tolliver', 'most', 'Series', '3', 'standing', 'ranting', 'raving', 'reasons', 'totally', 'escape', 'What', 'purpose', 'was', 'what', 'relationship', 'Hearst', 'was', 'seemed', 'melt', 'nothing', 'was', 'reduced', 'standing', 'balcony', 'looking', 'angry', 'gritting', 'teeth.All', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'guns', 'massed', 'taunts', 'grew', 'violence', 'simmered', 'boiled', 'random', 'acts', 'brutality', 'caused', 'ever', 'more', 'teeth-clenching', 'what', 'happened', 'Nothing', 'Nothing', 'Hearst', 'rode', 'town', 'Bulloch', 'clenched', 'teeth', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'How', 'feeble', 'was', 'whole', 'series', 'just', 'fizzled', 'out', 'election', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'climactic', 'finale', 'significance', 'election', 'who', 'was', 'standing', 'what', 'why', 'completely', 'escaped', 'just', 'seemed', 'irritating', 'confusing', 'weakly-scripted', 'diversion', 'background', 'not', 'major', 'plotline.When', 'election', 'finally', 'took', 'place', 'results', 'were', 'confusingly', 'blurted', 'out', 'Al', 'pub', 'minor', 'character', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'bothered', 'including', 'viewers', 'even', 'heard', 'properly', 'meaning', 'impact', 'had', 'become', 'totally', 'lost', 'point', 'where', 'hardly', 'seemed', 'matter.This', 'review', 'three', 'stars', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'brilliant', 'character', 'acting', 'sets', 'HBO', 'bravura', 'putting', 'ambitious', 'series', 'first', 'place.But', 'desperately', 'sort', 'finale', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'sort', 'payback', 'long', 'hours', 'loyal', 'fans', 'have', 'put', 'following', 'all.Oh', 'also', 'bonus', 'points', 'magnificent', 'horse', 'credits', 'called', 'Bobby', 'believe', 'Ellwood', 'wonderful', 'dog', 'can', 'anybody', 'supply', 'more', 'information']",Deadwood: Season 3

Violence - yes, graphic sex - yes, bad language - loads of it, but tremendous acting and a story worth the telling.

Perhaps the greatest picture of this development is the children walking through the muddy street to a new shcoolhouse. Alas, we do not know how the tug of war finished, just as the walk of the children was not finished, but we can hope.

That being said, this series was probably the best television I have ever watched.The writing, story line progression, acting, historical content, sets are all excellently done. Keep in mind this in not the typical ""western"" full of cowboys and such.Set in Goldrush Era South Dakota, Deadwood presents a different picture of the West. The series presents the gritty life of those who came west to seek their fortune. It is best described as muddy.As for the characters, I love the development of ""bad guys"" that are so complex that you end up cheering for them and sympathizing with them. In the same light, the ""good guys"" are so complex that they make you angry and disappointed. There are no clear good guys and bad guys. The secondary characters, such as Jane and Richardson, are captivating and sad and as complex as any of the main characters. In the end they were among my favorites. Jane's story is tragic when you can see her good heart at the same time she is self-destructive and sad. Richardson is sweet and harmless and yet kicked around by nearly everyone. Ellsworth is a man of character and ethics and is [spoiler alert] cut down for his troubles.I am not a scholar but the entire series struck me as a modern day Shakespeare play.The style of dialogue feels like it was written by the bard himself. The soliloquies that are rarely seen in modern drama are a common tool in Deadwood that offer insight to the character's mind. The ""side kick"" characters, in pairs or trios, offer commentary on the passing events and tools for a main character's means. I'm sure that a Shakespearean scholar could offer a better comparison than I.In the end, the ultimate tragedy is that Deadwood was never allowed to finish telling the story. HBO in their judgement of fiscal needs over dramatic integrity chose to cancel the show before it could accomplish a true wrap up to the story. This proves that the entertainment business is solely about money and not about the story. They did a disservice to the fans, the writers, the directors, the creator of the series and everyone else connected to the project. That being said, the 3 available seasons are certainly worth watching.

As the third season opens, sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) makes a run for re-election, which gets side tracked by forging an uneasy alliance with Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) against the vendictive George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) who comes to the camp with some deadly plans for everyone involved.  The lives of newly weds Alma Garret (Molly Parker) and Whitney Ellsworth (Jim Beaver), as well as Sol (John Hawkes) and Trixie (Paula Malcomson) are in jeopardy as Hearst prepares to wreak bloody havoc, which is mainly what this season of the series is focused on.  Also during this season, we witness the recovery of Cy (Powers Boothe), as well as bonding between Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) and Joanie (Kim Dickens), and the debilitating health of Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif).  If you've been a fan of the show for some time, you know what to expect with Deadwood in terms of it's vulgarity and violence, so if you're new to the show, you won't really be won over by anything here.  That being said, the third season of Deadwood is some truly great TV regardless, and the ensemble cast as usual is superb; with Olyphant, McShane, and McRaney being the best of the bunch.  As the previous reviewer stated, if this is indeed the final season of the show with no other kind of resolution, there isn't any real cliffhanger that leaves the viewer cursing at the screen (a la Carnivale).

Crawford,"[1, 1]","This last season ends with everything hanging in the balance:  Hearst appears to be taking everything over, Bullock and Swearengen are allies and perhaps even friends.  Meanwhile, all of the minor characters continue their crises on their own scale, from the doctor becoming a ""lunger"" to the murderous rages of Sy.  The most amazing thing - that climax and resolution are not even contemplated - is explained only by the expectation that a next season was going to get even better.  Well, so much for the best laid plans!  We are left with the best ending there could possibly be:  that things will continue like this, never finding any equilibrium to the struggle for power and dominance, with tradeoffs so unspeakably evil (e.g. the precondition for Trixie's survival) that they can never be justified, and the hope that the moral few will have their day, even though the elections are thrown.The action and acting are as outstanding as ever, the surprises never stop coming.  The only thing that leaves the viewer with is the hunger to learn more through history books and the many novels of the era.  I suppose the series returned me to my childhood fascination with cowboys, but with the modern sensibility and cynicism that we have gained as adults in an AMerica that we can no longer claim innocent.  I will watch this series again and again, I am sure, to savor its subtleties and complete the brief glimpses of character in my own imagination.

A skilled cast of actors, not altogether wasted, is frittered away on a story which is diffused by side plots which seemed more designed to take up air time than contribute to what was going on (the theater guild people for example).The villain gets what he ultimate wants----control of all the local mines---destruction of a fledgling workers union--assassination of a persistent, annoying enemy--killing of person he thought was responsible for the attempt on his lifethen rides away into the sunset.Sure he gets embarrassed a few times, but he wins. He's THE biggest employer in town, now watch wages drop 36%.The series is pseudo -historical meaning there are a few characters that REALLY lived,, but deeds they done vary greatly from their historical counterparts. Rather than the angst of the Theater guild, the plot would have been better spent having that eras President (Grant?) travel in from Washington. Then maybe Bullock and Friends could foil the President's assassination and assumption of that fine office by Hearst the Villain.As hokum as that might be, it certainly would be more satisfying than watching how the good guys posture while signing over the mine and which innocent hoe gets throated to appease Hearst lest he throw a tantrum.I give 3 Stars for+1--good acting+1--unique Western series+1--overall atmosphere effects-1--sluggish plot polluted by irrelevant side plots-1--weaker than the 2 seasons that preceded it",3,"Good acting , EXCITING drags, unsatisfying ending",1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,1519,"['SPOILER', 'ALERTI', 'prefer', 'stronger', 'good', 'BEATING', 'evil', 'especially', 'wrap', 'up', 'skilled', 'cast', 'actors', 'not', 'altogether', 'wasted', 'frittered', 'away', 'story', 'diffused', 'side', 'plots', 'seemed', 'more', 'designed', 'take', 'up', 'air', 'time', 'contribute', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'theater', 'guild', 'people', 'example', 'villain', 'what', 'ultimate', 'control', 'local', 'mines', '-destruction', 'fledgling', 'workers', 'union', 'assassination', 'persistent', 'annoying', 'enemy', 'killing', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'responsible', 'attempt', 'lifethen', 'away', 'sunset.Sure', 'embarrassed', 'few', 'times', 'biggest', 'employer', 'town', 'now', 'watch', 'wages', 'drop', '36', '%', '.The', 'series', 'pseudo', '-historical', 'meaning', 'are', 'few', 'characters', 'REALLY', 'lived', 'done', 'vary', 'greatly', 'historical', 'counterparts', 'Rather', 'angst', 'Theater', 'guild', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'having', 'eras', 'President', 'Grant', 'travel', 'Washington', 'Then', 'maybe', 'Bullock', 'Friends', 'could', 'foil', 'President', 'assassination', 'assumption', 'fine', 'office', 'Hearst', 'Villain.As', 'hokum', 'might', 'be', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'satisfying', 'watching', 'how', 'good', 'guys', 'posture', 'signing', 'mine', 'innocent', 'hoe', 'throated', 'appease', 'Hearst', 'lest', 'throw', 'tantrum.I', 'give', '3', 'Stars', 'for+1', 'good', 'acting+1', 'unique', 'Western', 'series+1', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'effects-1', 'sluggish', 'plot', 'polluted', 'irrelevant', 'side', 'plots-1', 'weaker', '2', 'seasons', 'preceded']",Deadwood: Season 3

Though Timothy Olyphant gets top billing, McShane steals the show.  Although I know a lot of people had a problem with the language, I feel quite the opposite.  It's not that I love swear words, I love the dialogue.  It is Shakespearean.  The language reflects the times.  No, this is not a John Wayne western, it's much more gritty, more realistic.The knock down to 4 stars comes from the last two episodes in season 5.  In episode 11, I kept waiting for something to happen.  A main character had just been murdered and I was expecting a shoot out in response, but instead, what does everyone do but sit around the Gem drinking.  That is the only spot in a 3 season show that I felt that the writing failed.  Similar with the finale.  I kept waiting for a satisfying resolution to the conflict with George Hearst, and none was forthcoming.I read online that that Seth Bullock (Olyphant) served as Deadwood's sheriff for many years and was proud of the fact that he never had to fire his gun.  Can't help but wonder if the writers read this as well, and wanted to keep the show in tune with history.  Normally I would feel the same.

It is like transposing a combination of Dickens and Shakespeare into the Wild West (however bizarre that may sound), and it amazingly always has the sense of a dramatic (staged) production rather than a TV show. The performances are without exception magnificent. Ian McShane gives one of the great performances anywhere, ever, and the rest of the cast are hardly less worthy of praise. If David Milch never does anything again this will go down as a work of genius. Inspiring to see the potential of television glimpsed in this glorious achievement; depressing to acknowledge it is a show that reaches well beyond the carefully and cynically dumbed-down limits allowed by the vested political and commercial interests that run this country.",5,Genius,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,860,"['perhaps', 'only', 'Television', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'could', 'claim', 'be', 'truly', 'great', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'transposing', 'combination', 'Dickens', 'Shakespeare', 'Wild', 'West', 'however', 'bizarre', 'may', 'sound', 'amazingly', 'always', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'staged', 'production', 'rather', 'TV', 'show', 'performances', 'are', 'exception', 'magnificent', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'anywhere', 'ever', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'hardly', 'less', 'worthy', 'praise', 'David', 'Milch', 'never', 'anything', 'again', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'work', 'genius', 'Inspiring', 'see', 'potential', 'television', 'glimpsed', 'glorious', 'achievement', 'depressing', 'acknowledge', 'show', 'well', 'carefully', 'cynically', 'dumbed-down', 'limits', 'allowed', 'vested', 'political', 'commercial', 'interests', 'run', 'country']",Deadwood: Season 3
