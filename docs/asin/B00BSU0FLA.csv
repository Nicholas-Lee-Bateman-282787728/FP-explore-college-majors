1638048,A1FDVT0DLJWV78,B00BSU0FLA,D. A. J.,"[8, 9]","Just saw this movie at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center where a lot of the filming was done. What a GREAT family friendly movie. Okay, the acting is ""okay"" and a couple pieces of the plot are out of order and yes, it is hard to figure out some people's actual job. With all that aside, it is a GREAT movie. What makes it great?1. The entire family can enjoy it. No foul language, no mushy love scenes, and there are parts that are exciting and funny enough that even adults will have a good time.2. The ""mean kid"" isn't so cruel that you hope he falls dead; yes, he is a jerk - but not too big of a bully.3. The movie is fun, even though it's for the kids - I never felt like poking my eyes out just to make it stop, which tends to happen with movies just for kids.4. Finally a movie for average, ordinary kids in the 6 - 12 category. This movie is safer than Space Camp (which has a bit of language), but still has cool up-to-date technology. It's just going to let kid's have a good time.Now, don't get this movie if you are a former Space Camper and want to relive your experience - it will just make you mad. They combine activities from Space and Aviation Camp and throw in things that don't happen in any camp (including the new Robotics Camp). Don't get this movie if you are a space buff that cringes when people get things wrong - there is a LOT that is wrong, not plausible, and ridiculous even to imagine. However, if you just like space and enjoy a fun movie that allows you to defy logic (like NASA picking future astronauts based on how they do as a team at Space Camp) - then this movie is for you.What makes it a 5 is the synergy of all the parts. Every part taken alone ranks 3 1/2 - 4; but put together the parts work just right to make this a 5. Honestly, I left the movie and came right how to pre-order the DVD.",5,Wonderful movie for the entire family!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1832,"['Just', 'saw', 'movie', 'U.S.', 'Space', 'Rocket', 'Center', 'where', 'lot', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'What', 'GREAT', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'Okay', 'acting', 'okay', 'couple', 'pieces', 'plot', 'are', 'order', 'yes', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'people', 'actual', 'job', 'aside', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'What', 'great', '1', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'foul', 'language', 'mushy', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'exciting', 'funny', 'enough', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time.2', 'mean', 'kid', ""n't"", 'so', 'cruel', 'hope', 'dead', 'yes', 'jerk', 'not', 'too', 'big', 'bully.3', 'movie', 'fun', 'even', 'kids', 'never', 'felt', 'poking', 'eyes', 'out', 'just', 'make', 'stop', 'happen', 'movies', 'just', 'kids.4', 'Finally', 'movie', 'average', 'ordinary', 'kids', '6', '12', 'category', 'movie', 'safer', 'Space', 'Camp', 'bit', 'language', 'still', 'cool', 'up-to-date', 'technology', 'just', 'going', 'let', 'have', 'good', 'time.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'are', 'former', 'Space', 'Camper', 'want', 'relive', 'experience', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'mad', 'combine', 'activities', 'Space', 'Aviation', 'Camp', 'throw', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'camp', 'including', 'new', 'Robotics', 'Camp', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'are', 'space', 'buff', 'when', 'people', 'get', 'things', 'wrong', 'LOT', 'wrong', 'not', 'plausible', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'imagine', 'However', 'just', 'space', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'movie', 'defy', 'logic', 'NASA', 'picking', 'future', 'astronauts', 'based', 'how', 'do', 'team', 'Space', 'Camp', 'then', 'movie', 'you.What', '5', 'synergy', 'parts', 'Every', 'part', 'taken', 'alone', '3', '1/2', '4', 'put', 'together', 'parts', 'work', 'just', 'right', 'make', '5', 'Honestly', 'left', 'movie', 'came', 'right', 'how', 'pre-order', 'DVD']",N/A

But with all of its drawbacks, including some pretty abominable acting by the child stars, I still really enjoyed it.  And I think the intended audience--the age and type of child who would be interested in attending the real Space Camp--will forgive everything else about it and just geek out on the cool introduction to what's now going on in our space program.As Glover's character in the movie says, a bit pontifically, at one point, the space program that was formerly so robust, such a source of national pride and accomplishment, is now in danger of fading almost completely away.  This is a mistake on many levels, and while this is a highly imperfect film, the one thing it manages to do very well is capture some of the essential, exciting nature of space exploration.",4,A fun reminder that the space program is cool.,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,1031,"['great', 'movie', 'barely', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'storyline', 'go', 'hope', 'pricing', 'new', 'DVD', 'misprint', '3,897.89', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'shipping', 'free', 'rented', 'Red', 'Box', '1.20', 'new', 'drawbacks', 'including', 'pretty', 'abominable', 'acting', 'child', 'stars', 'still', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'intended', 'audience', 'age', 'type', 'child', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'attending', 'real', 'Space', 'Camp', 'will', 'forgive', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'geek', 'out', 'cool', 'introduction', 'what', 'now', 'going', 'space', 'program.As', 'Glover', 'character', 'movie', 'bit', 'pontifically', 'one', 'point', 'space', 'program', 'was', 'formerly', 'so', 'robust', 'such', 'source', 'national', 'pride', 'accomplishment', 'now', 'danger', 'fading', 'almost', 'completely', 'away', 'mistake', 'many', 'levels', 'highly', 'imperfect', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'capture', 'essential', 'exciting', 'nature', 'space', 'exploration']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the plot was simpler than I imagined. Before I watched the movie, the title made me cringe, suggesting that it was about teenagers battling aliens in a cheesy rampage through outer space. Clearly, I was wrong to judge a movie by its poster. ""Space Warriors"" is a fun and unexpectedly down-to-earth film for all ages.Jimmy Hawkins (Thomas Horn, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close""), the son of a retired NASA astronaut, is a complete astronomy geek. His dream is to go to space, and the opportunity arises in the form of Space Camp, where teams can compete for the chance to go to space. His parents, played by Dermot Mulroney and Mira Sorvino, forbid him to join Space Camp fearing for his safety, but Jimmy joins anyway. At Space Camp he meets the brightest, nerdiest group of astronomy-lovers, called Space Warriors. They have to learn to work together as a team not only to win the competition, but to save the lives of three astronauts along the way as well.Colonel Manley (Josh Lucas), one of the commanders at Space Camp, is one of my favorite characters - he's witty and smart with just a touch of dry humor and sarcasm. Sean McNamara (""Soul Surfer"") is the director of ""Space Warriors."" Along the same lines of ""Soul Surfer,"" this movie has many great themes that include teamwork, leadership, overcoming fear, thinking outside the box, making wise choices and most importantly, it shines a positive light on youth. The Space Warriors don't let anyone look down on them because of their age - they prove to the entire world that age doesn't matter as long as you have passion, a love of discovering, and an open mind.The movie incorporates footage from history in outer space and was shot on-location at the Space Camp in Alabama. For science-lovers, this movie is the ultimate ""Easter egg"" hunt, where geeks will want to shout and announce to other viewers, ""That's the actual footage of landing on the moon!"" or ""I've been on a moon-gravity simulator just like that!"" I found myself thinking that if I could go to a Space Camp that looks even half as fun as the one in the movie, it'd be the best summer of my life.I recommend this movie for all ages, especially for aspiring scientists. I give it four out of five stars. ""Space Warriors"" will inspire viewers to look up and rekindle an excitement for learning about the unknown universe of space.
