DMX played his part so well as &quot;Tommy&quot;, a ruthless big-time drug dealer who's only goal in life was to do whatever it took to get money. So, I'm trying to understand, critics, how did DMX NOT portray this in the movie?? DMX was not only fearless and ruthless, he was pretty damn funny too. NAS plays his buddy and partner &quot;Sincere&quot;. NAS was also great in the movie. He wasn't quite as risk-taking and evil as DMX was in the movie, but he worked really, really great with DMX as his drug-dealing partner. Also, By far, the biggest criminal in the movie was a Jamaican drug kingpin named Lennox. He was Tommy's biggest drug connection and you got chills just looking at him. This movie has some very brutal violence and action scenes, which may have turned some critics off. Jeez......if you don't want to see that stuff, then head over to the comedy section of the video store. Also in the movie, look for &quot;Knowledge&quot;, Tommy and Sincere's partner/connection.

Every tired cliche is  dragged out and splattered across the screen, set to music. The highlight  here is Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which looks great as usual.

But ""Belly"" had enough to keep me watching it over a few dozen times. I've heard several people liken it to an updated ""New Jack City"", but this movie is told in a far different manner. First off, you don't see the movie through the cops' eyes, but rather through those of the criminals. Also, there isn't that annoying undertone of bad karma (don't do drugs and all that), even though it is somewhat thrown in at the end. In fact, the movie can be more likened to ""Goodfellas"" with a modern, urban New York twist, in that it's portraying the main protagonists (or antagonists, depending on how you look at it) in their struggle to rise to the top of the criminal food chain.Now, there were a few negatives to the film....most notably, Nas' character Sincere got on the nerves at times and didn't really come through as a hard gangster. DMX carried that image all by himself, making you wonder how they referred to themselves as ""Butch and Sundance"". The plot was kinda hard to follow at times and could require you to watch the movie a couple of times, but I didn't complain, as just with ""The Matrix"" you pick up new things each time you watch the movie. Method Man was excellent in this film, but he didn't have enough time onscreen and it would have been nice to see a few more members of the Wu in there.

460036,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6305324808,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[7, 20]","The American Dream is an appealing myth, no doubt. The idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in America sounds great. The problem, as George Carlin put it, is that you have to be asleep to believe in it. So instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs. And that is where ""Belly"" comes in, an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it. This urban drama stars DMX (perpetually rapping), Nas, and Method Man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies. The story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs. When the plot does poke its head up I picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from Queens to Omaha. Once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot. One couple tries to escape to Africa, but find it easier said than done. And Tommy (DMX) is sent on a mission to kill a minister. But really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn't even exist. Come on now, I've known drug dealers in my day, and they didn't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do. Rather they live in shacks or their parent's basement.If my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is. The directing by Hype Williams isn't that bad. He is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks. The lighting never seems quite right, but I'm gonna let that one slide. As a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films I can hardly complain about their presence here. There people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions. All that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that I am going to give it. As the most nihilistic person I know I am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost. Any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used. The N and F words are used to comedic proportions. Their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason. And then, on top of it all, we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us. Sorry man, but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn't make you any less slimy than those Wall Street hacks. You're still a businessman. This film is not worth watching. Any social point that is made is made accidentally, and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta. **1/4",2,But Why is it Called Belly?,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,2742,"['American', 'Dream', 'appealing', 'myth', 'doubt', 'idea', 'anybody', 'can', 'come', 'anywhere', 'strike', 'rich', 'America', 'great', 'problem', 'George', 'Carlin', 'put', 'have', 'be', 'asleep', 'believe', 'So', 'instead', 'representing', 'opportunity', 'everybody', 'become', 'code', 'greed', 'costs', 'where', 'Belly', 'ode', 'thug', 'live', 'riches', 'come', 'urban', 'drama', 'stars', 'DMX', 'perpetually', 'rapping', 'Nas', 'Method', 'Man', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'earned', 'cash', 'selling', 'drugs', 'pimping', 'as', 'opposed', 'selling', 'out', 'record', 'companies', 'story', 'barely', 'seemed', 'burden', 'director', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'endless', 'shots', 'people', 'having', 'sex', 'smoking', 'drugs', 'When', 'plot', 'poke', 'head', 'picked', 'up', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'moved', 'shop', 'Queens', 'Omaha', 'Once', 'cops', 'get', 'involved', 'people', 'start', 'getting', 'shot', 'One', 'couple', 'escape', 'Africa', 'find', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'Tommy', 'DMX', 'sent', 'mission', 'kill', 'minister', 'really', 'film', 'selling', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'Come', 'now', ""'ve"", 'known', 'drug', 'dealers', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'large', 'gaudy', 'mansions', 'rap', 'stars', 'do', 'Rather', 'live', 'shacks', 'parent', 'basement.If', 'response', 'film', 'lukewarm', 'directing', 'Hype', 'Williams', ""n't"", 'bad', 'able', 'capture', 'beautiful', 'images', 'few', 'creative', 'camera', 'tricks', 'lighting', 'never', 'quite', 'right', ""'m"", 'gon', 'let', 'one', 'slide', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'called', 'more', 'sex', 'drugs', 'films', 'can', 'hardly', 'complain', 'presence', 'here', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'being', 'weighed', 'down', 'bourgeois', 'conventions', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'fully', 'big', 'vote', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'most', 'nihilistic', 'person', 'know', 'am', 'surprised', 'report', 'one', 'really', 'seemed', 'lost', 'image', 'could', 'flash', 'screen', 'would', 'appeal', 'wannabes', 'audience', 'was', 'used', 'N', 'F', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'comedic', 'proportions', 'palaces', 'represent', 'gluttony', 'are', 'turned', 'war', 'zones', 'destroyed', 'good', 'reason', 'then', 'top', 'have', 'listen', 'characters', 'wax', 'philosophical', 'how', 'leading', 'life', 'somehow', 'higher', 'plain', 'rest', 'Sorry', 'man', 'just', 'sell', 'drugs', 'instead', 'stocks', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'slimy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'hacks', ""'re"", 'still', 'businessman', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'social', 'point', 'made', 'made', 'accidentally', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'are', 'lost', 'love', 'fest', 'things', 'gangsta', '**1/4']",Belly VHS
460037,A352ULL611TIYJ,6305324808,christopher b. banks,"[10, 11]","Hype Williams directorial debut was solid yet confusing. Belly gives you the feel of an overextended music video gone awry. The first few minutes are focused on a glossy holdup of NYC's Tunnel Nightclub. The two main characters, Sincere and Tommy, played by rap stars, Nas and DMX have masterminded a scheme to expand their local empire and popularize a new underground drug. In their efforts, they enlist a Jamaican drug lord (played by Louie Rankin  who's authentic but small part is noted:)to front them the cash for quick profits. This sounds like a simple plot, but unfortunately a terrible editing job has made this story difficult to understand unless you view it more than five times. After some reasonable success, the operation is depleted and Tommy and Sincere go in opposite directions. Sincere, played horribly by NAS, and his wife, (Tionne Watkins)who is equally as bad, agree that Africa is their safe haven, and they decide to make the move. This, in my estimation is another confusing part of the story. Why Africa? What sensible black couple would just pick up and travel to Africa to start another life? It just doesn't make sense. The story takes another weird twist when Tommy (DMX) becomes entangled with the Federal authorities to conspire an assaniation plot on a Louis Farrakhan character they foolishly call &quot;The Minister&quot;. This Minister character is a cameo role for Dr. Benjamin Chavis, who recently embraced the Nation after a heated ordeal as leader of the NAACP. This climax is fitting since the story has us totally bamboozled by now. Your probably wondering why I gave it four stars, but my explanation should be suffice. DMX holds this picture on his back, he literally carries it from start to finish. Watching him is like seeing Tupac for the first time as a crazed &quot;Bishop&quot; in Juice. Critics say that he simply played himself, if that's so it was a hell of an acting performance..........Otherwise this is a silly story filled with several holes....And whoever is responsible for  distribution, should redistribute with the unedited segments.

The dialouge is so filled with street lingo that only people who truly understand the hip-hop culture will be able to really understand what is going on. While this does provide the film with a level of realism that most films never capture, it may take many people numerous viewings to pick up on what is really going on. Critics were quick to blast this film for the fact that the majority of its stars are rappers who have never even acted before but to their credit, DMX and Method Man do well. Nas as Sincere is about as painful a narrator as you can get. He trys to do Liotta in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; but his narration is all over the place. After explaining Tommy's transformation in one scene, he seems to &quot;rewind&quot; himself back and act like he doesn't know what is really going on. In some scenes, he even rambles to the point where it sounds like even he has no idea what he is saying.. Taral Hicks is one of the few actual actors in this rapper-dominated movie. She has a commanding prescene as Tommy's &quot;boo&quot;, Keisha. Louie Rankin's Jamaican drug lord is also presented well. His English isn't great but his performance comes off authentic regardless. He sounds like the real deal, not some bad actor who can't read dialouge but rather someone who understands his character. The closing monolouge by Dr. Benjamin Chavis as &quot;The Minister&quot; is the icing on the cake. While some claimed that the movie seemed to glorify many of the elements that Chavis' speech criticized, many of these critics seem to be missing the point all together.The movie is shot with a lot of dark images as Williams has a little too much fun with the visual end. The fancy imagery seems to overpower the story at times. Aside from the introduction of Method Man's &quot;Ike Love&quot;, there really isn't a lot of humor in this film. Another problem. It could stand to lighten up at times. It's clearly not a comedy but it could benefit from pulling away from its somber overtone at least a little bit. There is no need to bombard the audience in a dark and somber atmosphere for the full two hours. Even when there are some attempts at comedy, they aren't picked up because we're paying too much attention to the aforementioned &quot;imagery&quot; and not enough to the characters.&quot;Belly&quot; is not a terrible movie. In fact, it is pretty good but the roughness of the presentation hurts the appeal of the story. Looking past the negative, this movie does have a lot to offer. If you have the patentience to sit through the gritty images and rugged dialouge then you might be able to appreciate the entertaining aspects of this somewhat uneven film.",3,BELLY Review,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,3640,"['Music', 'video', 'director', 'Hype', 'Williams', 'feature-film', 'debut', 'urban', 'action', 'drama', 'starring', 'rappers', 'Nas', 'DMX', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'take', 'two', 'seperate', 'paths', 'adult', 'lives.Nas', 'who', 'co-scripted', 'story', 'Sincere', 'hustler', 'Queens', 'who', 'partner', 'Tommy', 'quot', 'Buns', 'quot', 'Brown', 'invest', 'big-money', 'scheme', 'invovling', 'new', 'form', 'high-grade', 'heroin', 'Sincere', 'game', 'badly', 'Torn', 'loyalty', 'friend', 'ambitions', 'become', 'family', 'man', 'legitimate', 'lifestyle', 'Sincere', 'knowledge', 'guidance', 'books', 'Tommy', 'however', 'gun-toting', 'madman', 'who', 'only', 'goal', 'life', 'be', 'pursuit', 'money', 'cost', 'decisions', 'two', 'follow', 'lives', 'down', 'seperate', 'paths', 'Sincere', 'plotting', 'escape', 'Africa', 'Tommy', 'caught', 'up', 'plot', 'assasinate', 'religious', 'leader.', 'quot', 'Belly', 'quot', 'more', 'difficult', 'be', 'times', 'dialouge', 'so', 'filled', 'street', 'lingo', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'understand', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'provide', 'film', 'level', 'realism', 'most', 'films', 'never', 'capture', 'may', 'take', 'many', 'people', 'numerous', 'viewings', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Critics', 'were', 'quick', 'blast', 'film', 'fact', 'majority', 'stars', 'are', 'rappers', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'acted', 'before', 'credit', 'DMX', 'Method', 'Man', 'do', 'well', 'Nas', 'Sincere', 'about', 'as', 'painful', 'narrator', 'can', 'get', 'trys', 'do', 'Liotta', 'quot', 'Goodfellas', 'quot', 'narration', 'place', 'explaining', 'Tommy', 'transformation', 'one', 'scene', 'quot', 'rewind', 'quot', 'back', 'act', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'scenes', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'idea', 'what', 'saying..', 'Taral', 'Hicks', 'one', 'few', 'actual', 'actors', 'rapper-dominated', 'movie', 'commanding', 'prescene', 'Tommy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Keisha', 'Louie', 'Rankin', 'Jamaican', 'drug', 'lord', 'also', 'presented', 'well', 'English', ""n't"", 'great', 'performance', 'off', 'authentic', 'regardless', 'real', 'deal', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'dialouge', 'rather', 'someone', 'who', 'character', 'closing', 'monolouge', 'Dr.', 'Benjamin', 'Chavis', 'quot', 'Minister', 'quot', 'icing', 'cake', 'claimed', 'movie', 'seemed', 'glorify', 'many', 'elements', 'Chavis', 'speech', 'criticized', 'many', 'critics', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'together.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'lot', 'dark', 'images', 'Williams', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'visual', 'end', 'fancy', 'imagery', 'overpower', 'story', 'times', 'Aside', 'introduction', 'Method', 'Man', 'quot', 'Ike', 'Love', 'quot', 'really', ""n't"", 'lot', 'humor', 'film', 'problem', 'could', 'stand', 'lighten', 'up', 'times', 'clearly', 'not', 'comedy', 'could', 'benefit', 'pulling', 'away', 'somber', 'overtone', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'need', 'bombard', 'audience', 'dark', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'are', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', ""'re"", 'paying', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'aforementioned', 'quot', 'imagery', 'quot', 'not', 'enough', 'characters.', 'quot', 'Belly', 'quot', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'roughness', 'presentation', 'appeal', 'story', 'Looking', 'negative', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'offer', 'have', 'patentience', 'sit', 'gritty', 'images', 'rugged', 'dialouge', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'entertaining', 'aspects', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'film']",Belly VHS

However, the film's lackluster script, extremely corny dialogue, over the top editing, and poor narrative by Nas was almost unbearable if not stomach-turning. The only acting that seemed plausible was DMX, (Thats not really saying that much). Instead of releasing this movie theatrically, it easily could of been a 93 minute music video on Mtv. On a positive note, I appreciated the vibrant colors and newly remastered dvd transfer; it incorporated bright greens, saturated blue's and washed out reds. (Jamaica scenes manifest this description the best) the editing coincided well with the soundtrack for the first 20 minutes but quickly deteriorated along with the horrific acting. I wanted to see an actual film, not a eternal music video. I understand Hype Williams wanted to incorporate his music editing elements to the table; however, it suffered in the long run. Now to the acting, Nas as a lead role was hurtful and corny to watch on screen. its not like These hip/hop artists are being asked to portray complex characters, more or less themselves. Nas's poor narration just barely ties the rapid paced and unrelated scenes. Dmx, on the other hand, was the only actor who seemed like maybe he actually did some auditioning before the film; Dmx's deep scratchy voice is powerful and coincides well with his volatile demeanor as well as  profession. As far as the incomprehensible-gibberish speaking Jamaican drug lords go, I think  Al Pacino did it best with his Cuban accent. Enough said. For hip/hop aficionado's or fans of any of these artists should view this film, however, it should be taken with a grain of salt.

DMX is sick in this film because he's relating to himself and using it to act. Even Method Man made you feel him and believe his role but there were some weak links. Nas was Ok but he needed some more emotion to make you feel Sincere and T-Boz was the same way but she tried hard. The truth is Belly is almost a perfect movie but some of the actors weren't adding up to this great story. Belly actually teaches you that even when you hit the bottom you don't have to stay there.

DMX and Nas star as Tommy and Sincere(a modern day Butch and Sundance as Sincere puts it).  They are thugs who rob night clubs.  Then Tommy finds out about this new kind of drug, hooks up with his Jamaican druglord friend Lennox(one of the coolest performances), and builds an empire in Nebraska.  Everything's cool until Knowledge(rapper Power) gets locked up and starts screwing Tommy's business up.  He recruits Shameek(Method Man) to hunt them down and kill them.  At the same time, Sincere starts to reconsider his lifestyle.This isn't the greatest crime drama ever, but it is cool.  DMX gives an outstanding performance.  Nas' Sincere seemed a little dreamy at times, but his role still works.  T-Boz outacts Nas because of the scene when Method Man breaks into her house and she freaks him out when she pulls a gun on him.  Method Man gives an alright performance, but his role was too small.  Taral Hicks plays Tommy's girl Kiesha, who in the end symbolizes woman power as she fights off Method Man.As for the movie, there are alot of memorable scenes, the most being the opening nightclub robbery.  Neon lights, glowing eyes, and quick getaways.This is probably the biggest Hip-Hop cult movie.  For these being debut actors and a debut movie director, this movie's amazing.  The best is that most of the same things that we found wrong with this film, Hype(the director) found himself.  It would've been better if it hadn't been edited so much(Hype says in the commentary that the movie was like 3 hours originally).

460066,A26XCS3QLDJJWN,6305324808,"Patrick G. Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha...""","[1, 2]","Look, I don't exactly think Hype Williams was aiming to outdo the 'Godfather' movies when he made 'Belly.' For me, however, it stands up there with 'Menace II Society' and 'New Jersey Drive' as interesting slice-of-life flicks.Both 'Menace' and 'Belly' trip up on their grandiose ambitions of portraying gangsters trying (or being led slowly) to turning a page on their lives, but are certainly entertaining in the process. I prefer to think of 'Belly' as a series of scenes set to music, or a long-form music video. Hype Williams would probably hate this characterization, but I say play to your strengths. He knows how to set a visual to music, and it shows in many of the scenes.True, some of Nas's lines as Sincere - who is just as much a gangster as DMX's buckwild Tommy character, but has a little more room for contemplation, and actually reads books (one of the movie's best and most hilarious exchanges is about Tommy's dislike of books; all I'll quote is ""Shorty can't eat no books, dog."") - are a bit cornball and cringeworthy, but take it in stride.For me, what elevates 'Belly' above the average 'hood' film is the inclusion of Louie Rankin as Jamaican drug kingpin Lenox. His even-toned, gravelly patois gives the character an uneasy edge. You never know if he on the verge of serious violence, and his showdown with about 15 armed guards and a female assassin is a juicy action sequence. This, along with a side trip to the slums of Jamaica gives 'Belly' an international crime flavor that is usually absent from the average gangbanger morality tale.Several supporting characters lend the film humor, including 'Menace's Tyrin Turner as a perm-flattened Nebraska hustler, and Method Man as a hired hitman pretending to be a cornball gangster-wannabe (""They call me Ike Luv, patna!""), and I'm still not sure why some people insist that ""there's no storyline."" Maybe they just get all lost during the Jamaican part 'cause everyone's speaking patois.Is it the best film of 1998? No. Is it a pretty-good, visually-excellent gangster flick?

The almost all Hip-Hop cast(including DMX, Nas, Power, T-Boz, and Method Man) are surprisingly good in their performances, especially DMX as Tommy.  X plays the dark character better than anyone could.  It's obvious that Nas should stick to rapping, but he doesn't do too bad on screen.  Method Man is very surprising as Shameek, a thug who's hired by Knowledge(Power) to go after Tommy.  Meth, who usually acts in  comedy's, is surprisingly convincing as a pipsqueek sort of guy.  An almost unrecognizable Tyrin Turner(Caine from ""Menace II Society"") makes a cameo as Rico, a local Nebraska druglord.Basically, this film is an expose of the drug life.  It goes around the world, from Jamaica to Nebraska, and the characters are diverse and true to life.The only problem is that the film was horribly edited.  Hype even complained that his film was ruined by the editing in his commentary, stating the film was originally 3 hours.But all that aside, ""Belly"" is a great flick.  I would probably put it in the top 20 list of gangsta flicks.  It has great action, drama, and even a little comedy.  It's also very stylish and is shot very smoothly, especially the awesome opening scene, full of green lights and gunfights(LOL).

Becuase when they do a darma turn it's bad. Every thing about this movie is bad and hear is why:Directing - Hype Willams can not direct an 96 mintue movie only 4 mintue music videos. Plus when your actors are not doing what they are supposted to the director is to tell them what they are doing is wrong and how to do it right. Well, I guesse no one told him that. Oh,no wait I got it:He [is bad] as a director.Script - Hype Willams also can not write a movie...!!. The dialgo in this movie is horribel. Also when you make up a script it's ment to about something and tell why the movie is named ""Belly"" neather was inculued it that. You also need a good stroyline to carry the movie, it did not have that. I saw it 3 days ago and still wondering what the plot of it was.Editing - I know there was an editor on this film because all films have them. But what did he do? I don't think he did any thing at all.Cinemtography - I hated the way the movie was shot. Fast,then slow,then fast and back to normal. Also with all those flashy lights. Just bad.Acting/Cast - DMX must have been high the whole time while making this movie. I mean he is a pretty good actor. He made good turns in ""Romeo Must Die"" & ""Exit Wounds"" but in ""Belly"" he was bad. His chactor was dumb. Did someone forget to tell him this was movie? And to talk like a person not like he is rapping. Well I guesse he figured it was music video shoot becuase Hype Willams was the director and Nas, T-Boz & Method Man were in the film also. Yo, Nas stick to rapping you do it better. I know you've only had two good cds (""Illmatic"" & ""Stillmatic"") but you are going on where fast in Hollywood. Nas can not act his way about of paper bag. Method Man needs to stick to comedy because ""How High"" was funny. T-Boz she needs to go back to TLC. I guesse I could say the cast had alot of names but they can not act in darmas.Music - They made a really good soundtrack from this movie. But they didn't include any of it in the film. That was smart! Use a [bad] score. Smart move!So this movie does nothing for any one. I don't see how any would like it unless there higher DMX in the restuant scene. Other things to mention about this movie:It's slow ... The 96 mintues seemed like 10 hours. The extas on the DVD were junkie. What a waste of time. Do not see this movie...1/10",1,One of the all time worst.,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,2464,"['usually', 'movies', 'rappers', 'not', 'Belly', 'Well', 'maybe', 'rappers', 'should', 'stick', 'comedy', 'and/or', 'action', 'films', 'Becuase', 'when', 'do', 'darma', 'turn', 'bad', 'Every', 'thing', 'movie', 'bad', 'hear', 'why', 'Directing', 'Hype', 'Willams', 'can', 'not', 'direct', '96', 'mintue', 'movie', 'only', '4', 'mintue', 'music', 'videos', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'supposted', 'director', 'tell', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'wrong', 'how', 'do', 'right', 'Well', 'guesse', 'one', 'told', 'Oh', 'wait', 'got', 'bad', ']', 'director.Script', 'Hype', 'Willams', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'movie', 'dialgo', 'movie', 'horribel', 'Also', 'when', 'make', 'up', 'script', 'ment', 'something', 'tell', 'why', 'movie', 'named', 'Belly', 'neather', 'was', 'inculued', 'also', 'need', 'good', 'stroyline', 'carry', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'saw', '3', 'days', 'ago', 'still', 'wondering', 'what', 'plot', 'was.Editing', 'know', 'was', 'editor', 'film', 'films', 'have', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'thing', 'all.Cinemtography', 'hated', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Fast', 'then', 'slow', 'then', 'fast', 'back', 'normal', 'Also', 'flashy', 'lights', 'Just', 'bad.Acting/Cast', 'DMX', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'whole', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'mean', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'made', 'good', 'turns', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'Belly', 'was', 'bad', 'chactor', 'was', 'dumb', 'Did', 'someone', 'forget', 'tell', 'was', 'movie', 'talk', 'person', 'not', 'rapping', 'Well', 'guesse', 'figured', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'shoot', 'becuase', 'Hype', 'Willams', 'was', 'director', 'Nas', 'T-Boz', 'Method', 'Man', 'were', 'film', 'also', 'Yo', 'Nas', 'stick', 'rapping', 'do', 'better', 'know', ""'ve"", 'only', 'had', 'two', 'good', 'cds', 'Illmatic', 'Stillmatic', 'are', 'going', 'where', 'fast', 'Hollywood', 'Nas', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'Method', 'Man', 'stick', 'comedy', 'How', 'High', 'was', 'funny', 'T-Boz', 'go', 'back', 'TLC', 'guesse', 'could', 'say', 'cast', 'had', 'alot', 'names', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'darmas.Music', 'made', 'really', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'film', 'was', 'smart', 'Use', '[', 'bad', ']', 'score', 'Smart', 'move', 'So', 'movie', 'nothing', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'would', 'like', 'higher', 'DMX', 'restuant', 'scene', 'Other', 'things', 'mention', 'movie', 'slow', '96', 'mintues', 'seemed', '10', 'hours', 'extas', 'DVD', 'were', 'junkie', 'What', 'waste', 'time', 'Do', 'not', 'see', 'movie', '1/10']",Belly VHS
