He is one of the few auteurs working today, and it's a tragedy that so few of his films are available.The plot of The Raspberry Reich is for the most part irrelevant, should you really want a story its there for you, and its surprisingly entertaining for what it is, even offering a rather touching romantic ending. The art of the movie is the execution and the laugh out loud script that you can quote for days without losing any of the novelty.While as a whole it isn't my favorite Labruce film, it is one of his most original (and that's saying something)Cult in every sense of the word!",5,The Raspberry Reich,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,666,"['Bruce', 'Labruce', 'one', 'most', 'tragically', 'overlooked', 'directors', 'there', 'one', 'few', 'auteurs', 'working', 'today', 'tragedy', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'available.The', 'plot', 'Raspberry', 'Reich', 'most', 'part', 'irrelevant', 'should', 'really', 'want', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'what', 'even', 'offering', 'rather', 'touching', 'romantic', 'ending', 'art', 'movie', 'execution', 'laugh', 'loud', 'script', 'can', 'quote', 'days', 'losing', 'novelty.While', 'whole', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'Labruce', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'saying', 'something', 'Cult', 'sense', 'word']",Raspberry Reich

864045,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00069A6CC,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 3]","The Raspberry Reich is a mess. Written and directed by someone calling himself Bruce LaBruce, the movie is designed to be an-in-your-face send-up of Europe's revolutionary passions by the youth of the Seventies. Here the leader of an inept boy gang is a left-wing, well-built harridan named Gudrun, who shouts, rants and copulates energetically with her hetero (at the start) partner. Gudrun discovers that hetero sex is not all that revolutionary or liberating, so she insists that her gang members have sex with each other. Cue in plenty of gay sex acts.The visual look of the film is vivid and bold. The story is amateurishly written, acted and directed. The sex looks like it was fun. The movie, after the first half hour, wasn't. The ranting was loud. The sex, ultimately, seemed merely a way for the writer/director to provoke all the grannies in New Jersey.",2,"Can sex be dull?

I have seen this three times and each time I see something I did not notice the previous times. There is a lot of nudity and random political, propaganda, and downright hilarious messages that appear out of nowhere across the action. These messages are defiantly my favorite parts of the movie and a down right brilliant idea from the director Bruce La Bruce.I liked this movie because it is far from boring and if you are not gay, you most likely will not take much away from the film. Just remember, THERE IS A LOT OF MALE NUDITY in this film, but I am not complaining. Yes there is a plot as well, so buy it, watch it, and if you are lucky, you will be glad to own this wonderful creative movie.",5,You will either love this movie or hate it.,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,855,"['favorite', 'Bruce', 'La', 'Bruce', 'film.If', 'art', 'house', 'left', 'wing', 'male', 'nudity', 'things', 'political', 'satires', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'see', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'previous', 'times', 'lot', 'nudity', 'random', 'political', 'propaganda', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'messages', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'action', 'messages', 'are', 'defiantly', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'down', 'right', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'director', 'Bruce', 'La', 'Bruce.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'far', 'boring', 'are', 'not', 'gay', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'Just', 'remember', 'LOT', 'OF', 'MALE', 'NUDITY', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'complaining', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'buy', 'watch', 'are', 'lucky', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'own', 'wonderful', 'creative', 'movie']",Raspberry Reich

""Make love, not war"" and ""Sex is revolution war is for imperialists"". I do think that the movie was trying to point out, if there was less sexphobia in the world, there would be less war because this is where hate is stemmed from ""fear"". There is one thing that I do have to say is that the sex that was seen was not ""play sex"" it was real and for that I do commend the writer and director of the movie. For if the sex was ""play"" the whole premise of the movie would have been lost. I did have to laugh in the movie that they were using George Ws face on a dart board.
