1583576,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00915G6UI,Alan Ramirez,"[7, 7]","I will miss 90210 so much! It was my favorite teen drama since it began in 2008 and until May of this year. This show was so dramatic, filled with sex and twists that I'll never forget. The cast worked so great together for five years, and I will miss looking forward every week for a new 90210 episode, but it was a great season overall. Obviously, this season doesn't feel like a final season, because the show was cancelled right before the season finale (now series finale) was supposed to be filmed, so if you haven't seen the last episode, don't expect anything big or fancy, but at least the writers found a way to give everybody a closure. The CW did a really bad decision, they will never find anything like 90210 ever.This season gets closer to the characters' feelings, with Dixon's car accident, Silver trying to have a baby before gettng diagnosed with breast cancer, Naomi breaking up with Max (they were end game! I suffered when they split up), Annie's new writing career (writing about her escort days from season 4), Adrianna dealing with her fame and her dark side (AGAIN); so this show always managed to let the audience see the characters' feelings with a little bit of craziness, but that's what it made it so interesting and addicting, right?I'm planing on watching the complete series again when I get this set! I still feel like I'm not ready to let it go, so it's great to have the seasons on DVD forever. Goodbye 90210!
