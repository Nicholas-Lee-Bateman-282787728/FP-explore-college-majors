1257240,A2Q2V174XSRMYZ,B0029SK2Z4,Duane Linstrom,"[12, 48]","If you're reasonably well versed in economics Dr. Wolf's somewhat biased recitation of economic history is worth listening to, considering that it's only 90 minutes long and what other information/entertainment is available. But his opinion is controversial and not universally held. Unfortunately Wolf's portrayal of business is more than a little disingenuous. He portrays capitalistic businesses as the villain of his narrative and capitalism as the cause of our current economic woes.  He doesn't acknowledge that business people are only after profits and profits are the pony the pulls the economic cart.According to Wolf, consumers are the victims of a conspiracy by businesses in which businesses maximized their profits by paying inadequate wages, then loaned those profits back to their employees at usurious interest rates. Wolf doesn't mention the responsibility consumers have for their own economic well being. One might consider that if consumers for any reason choose to live beyond their means, that is an opportunity for profit from banking and money lending businesses to loan them money, and consumers need to act responsibly in the presence of money they can't afford to borrow. It's too much of a stretch to imagine businesses as a whole conspired to keep wages low so they could lend their surplus profits to their workers.At the end of the lecture Wolf told a story about a group of entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley, where I live, that merrily pooled their resources and started a happy Marxist company where they are all in the process of living happily ever after. The story would be nice except 1) those start-up companies are usually after profit, and are an entrepreneurial throw of the dice with potentially large financial returns, 2) there is not an instance of communism succeeding anywhere at anytime under any circumstances as a long-term viable economic model.Economics, like many other subjects, is highly subjective. Wolf's is just one opinion. Other opinions worth listening to include Alan Greenspan in the second half of his book, The Age of Turbulence, and Walter Russell Mead in God and Gold, Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World. Both Greenspan and Mead require more than the 90 minutes Wolf's lecture took, but are well worth the time spent on them.",2,Some of what he says is true,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2310,"[""'re"", 'reasonably', 'well', 'versed', 'economics', 'Dr.', 'Wolf', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'recitation', 'economic', 'history', 'worth', 'listening', 'considering', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'what', 'other', 'information/entertainment', 'available', 'opinion', 'controversial', 'not', 'universally', 'held', 'Unfortunately', 'Wolf', 'portrayal', 'business', 'more', 'little', 'disingenuous', 'capitalistic', 'businesses', 'villain', 'narrative', 'capitalism', 'cause', 'current', 'economic', 'woes', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'business', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'profits', 'profits', 'are', 'pony', 'pulls', 'economic', 'cart.According', 'Wolf', 'consumers', 'are', 'victims', 'conspiracy', 'businesses', 'businesses', 'maximized', 'profits', 'paying', 'inadequate', 'wages', 'then', 'loaned', 'profits', 'back', 'employees', 'usurious', 'interest', 'rates', 'Wolf', ""n't"", 'mention', 'responsibility', 'consumers', 'have', 'own', 'economic', 'well', 'being', 'One', 'might', 'consider', 'consumers', 'reason', 'choose', 'live', 'means', 'opportunity', 'profit', 'banking', 'money', 'lending', 'businesses', 'loan', 'money', 'consumers', 'need', 'act', 'responsibly', 'presence', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'borrow', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'businesses', 'whole', 'conspired', 'keep', 'wages', 'low', 'could', 'lend', 'surplus', 'profits', 'workers.At', 'end', 'lecture', 'Wolf', 'told', 'story', 'group', 'entrepreneurs', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'where', 'live', 'merrily', 'pooled', 'resources', 'started', 'happy', 'Marxist', 'company', 'where', 'are', 'process', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'nice', '1', 'start-up', 'companies', 'are', 'usually', 'profit', 'are', 'entrepreneurial', 'throw', 'dice', 'potentially', 'large', 'financial', 'returns', '2', 'not', 'instance', 'communism', 'succeeding', 'anywhere', 'anytime', 'circumstances', 'long-term', 'viable', 'economic', 'model.Economics', 'many', 'other', 'subjects', 'highly', 'subjective', 'Wolf', 'just', 'one', 'opinion', 'Other', 'opinions', 'worth', 'listening', 'include', 'Alan', 'Greenspan', 'second', 'half', 'book', 'Age', 'Turbulence', 'Walter', 'Russell', 'Mead', 'God', 'Gold', 'Britain', 'America', 'Making', 'Modern', 'World', 'Greenspan', 'Mead', 'require', 'more', '90', 'minutes', 'Wolf', 'lecture', 'took', 'are', 'well', 'time', 'spent']",Capitalism Hits the Fan: Richard Wolff on the Economic Meltdown

He gives lots of interesting facts and thoughts on the current economic mess. However, he speaks with too much assurance that he KNOWS exactly why the economy is messed up. I don't trust ANYONE who speaks like they have all the facts. He has some good points but no final point. After telling us how wages stalled in the 1970s (which I can believe) and how business' took advantage of that to make higher profits (again I find his statements here plausable), he then tells us how business used the profits to make loans back to the workers (well, maybe). When I thought he was going to make a final concluding profound remark I was all ears but he just peters out and walks away. He came to the end saying some Silicon Valley groups are either Marxist and/or examples of the free market at work. There is no way to tell the difference he states. I disagree because these Silicon Valley business' are not in a bubble. They are working in the US society and can get things our economy provides that Marxist groups would have little or no access to. Then he practically shuffles away muttering that basic changes in our system must occur. Well, duh! Even teabaggers, Glenn Beck, Republicans and Democrats would agree on that. So we are left with an interesting hypothesis how we got to where we are but no suggestions on what to do about it. Therefore, the speech is pointless. All we can take from this speech is the thought it was a fairly good Economics 101 class but the bell rang before he finished. In other words, he speaks like every economist: He can tell us what happened in the past, period, the rest is just guessing. In this case, he didn't even give us a good guess what would work to fix our economy, just vague soapbox infomercial-type proclamations.

He explains it to where the problem is crystal clear and easily understandable by anyone. Our corporate capitalism, as it is currently structured, can not continue much longer. If it does, we will all suffer the lingering depression that Japan has undergone for the last 14 years. There is no way out other than to restructure! You can't buy your way out; you can't borrow your way out; you cannot stimulate your way out. The problem is unsolvable in its current structure. The only way to solve it is to change the structure. Corporate capitalism has done this to itself. We benefited as a nation from fortunate events where for three decades, we were the world's producer. No more. The rest of the world has caught up after a devestating WW-II that destroyed their economies and means of production. The entire world is now in for a lingering depression if we do not change the structure.
