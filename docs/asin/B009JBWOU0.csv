1597115,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B009JBWOU0,,"[0, 0]","As far back as I can recall being a fan of anything related to comic books, the comic book film was a genre that was always wrapped in imperfection. While there were those who gave it praise there were those that felt it was a butchery of all that was pure in their world. I would have to say that excluding a very select few, I was never satisfied when it came to films adapted by comic books.Christopher Nolan, a director whom I had known about, but never truly new back in 2005 finally said it is time for the world of comic books to be take seriously. While X-MEN & Spider-Man had already began going down that path 'Batman Beings' not only perfected the evolution, but it also finally gave us a fantastic scripted, cast & homage to Bob Kanes' icon. Fast forward to 2012 and you have one of the most beautiful comic book franchises in history...yet at a price none the less.Everything about these three films is wonderful, but once again as someone who adores the new Marvel film universe, it is going to be very hard to bring the world of DC comics to the big screen. Superman and Batman seem to be the only ones that any director or writer wants to tackle and now with how real and dark that Nolans 'trilogy is it is going to be even harder to bring heroes like Wonder Woman, The Flash and yes even a good Green Lantern sequel to the big screen. Still, with Zack Snyder tackling the Superman franchise and a Justice League film on the horizon in 2015 I have a feeling that it can be done. The three Dark Knight films of course are wonderful the massive cast that was gathered for these films are perfect, Christian Bale was the perfect Bruce Wayne and it is about time that was done correctly. Heath Ledger (RIP) wowed me as the Joker and as a fan of Anne Hathaway, I adored her as Catwoman. This is a film experience unlike any other and they will be treasured for years to come. I am just so happy that when I have kids of my own and they are old enough to learn about Batman, along side the Animated Series and the Adam West film these will be films I will be excited and proud to share with them.",4,The new age of comic book film.,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,2106,"['far', 'back', 'can', 'recall', 'being', 'fan', 'anything', 'related', 'comic', 'books', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'genre', 'was', 'always', 'wrapped', 'imperfection', 'were', 'who', 'gave', 'praise', 'were', 'felt', 'was', 'butchery', 'was', 'pure', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'excluding', 'very', 'select', 'few', 'was', 'never', 'satisfied', 'when', 'came', 'films', 'adapted', 'comic', 'books.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'director', 'whom', 'had', 'known', 'about', 'never', 'truly', 'new', 'back', '2005', 'finally', 'said', 'time', 'world', 'comic', 'books', 'be', 'take', 'seriously', 'X-MEN', 'Spider-Man', 'had', 'already', 'began', 'going', 'down', 'path', ""'Batman"", 'Beings', ""'"", 'not', 'only', 'perfected', 'evolution', 'also', 'finally', 'gave', 'fantastic', 'scripted', 'cast', 'homage', 'Bob', 'Kanes', 'icon', 'Fast', 'forward', '2012', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'history', 'yet', 'price', 'none', 'less.Everything', 'three', 'films', 'wonderful', 'once', 'again', 'someone', 'who', 'new', 'Marvel', 'film', 'universe', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'bring', 'world', 'DC', 'comics', 'big', 'screen', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'director', 'writer', 'tackle', 'now', 'how', 'real', 'dark', 'Nolans', ""'trilogy"", 'going', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'bring', 'heroes', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Flash', 'yes', 'even', 'good', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'sequel', 'big', 'screen', 'Still', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'tackling', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'Justice', 'League', 'film', 'horizon', '2015', 'have', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'three', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'films', 'course', 'are', 'wonderful', 'massive', 'cast', 'was', 'gathered', 'films', 'are', 'perfect', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'perfect', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'correctly', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'RIP', 'wowed', 'Joker', 'fan', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'adored', 'Catwoman', 'film', 'experience', 'other', 'will', 'be', 'treasured', 'years', 'come', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'have', 'kids', 'own', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'learn', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Adam', 'West', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'excited', 'proud', 'share']",The Dark Knight: Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises)

1597170,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B009JBWOU0,,"[1, 1]","Christopher Nolan had to expertly make a trio of Batman films like no other: truly dark featuring expansive sets, state-of-the-art FX, and, most of all, impressive performances from its stars.The first of the three, ""Batman Begins,"" sports the best performance by star Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  In the movie, Bale delivers his distinctive turn in the role previously assayed by the likes of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and, of course, Adam West on TV. Bale is very good, demonstrating why he was chosen for the role and why he is constantly in demand in Hollywood.Bale takes a backseat to the late Heath Ledger in ""Batman Returns."" In this one, Ledger takes the role of The Joker to a more psychotic level than has ever been presented before.  Ledger's take is more frightening and demented than previously has been presented.  He deserved the posthumous Oscar awarded him.Finally, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" suffers from what befalls many films: it's just too big...too many villains, overuse of special effects and violence at the expense of character, and a hazy plot that appears just thrown together.Although Tom Hardy's ""Bane"" is a worthy menace to Batman and Bane does admirably in the role, the film starts rather lacklusterly and ends on a rather predictable note. The first thirty minutes alone move too slowly.Additional acting kudos should be given to the other regulars common to all films: Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth.Overall rating: 5 stars for films 1 and 2; 3 stars for the conclusion in the trilogy",4,"As Meatloaf's song said, ""Two out of three ain't bad""",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1635,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'had', 'expertly', 'make', 'trio', 'Batman', 'films', 'other', 'truly', 'dark', 'featuring', 'expansive', 'sets', 'state-of-the-art', 'FX', 'most', 'impressive', 'performances', 'stars.The', 'first', 'three', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'sports', 'best', 'performance', 'star', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'movie', 'Bale', 'distinctive', 'turn', 'role', 'previously', 'assayed', 'likes', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'course', 'Adam', 'West', 'TV', 'Bale', 'very', 'good', 'demonstrating', 'why', 'was', 'chosen', 'role', 'why', 'constantly', 'demand', 'Hollywood.Bale', 'backseat', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'one', 'Ledger', 'role', 'Joker', 'more', 'psychotic', 'level', 'ever', 'been', 'presented', 'Ledger', 'take', 'more', 'frightening', 'demented', 'previously', 'been', 'presented', 'deserved', 'posthumous', 'Oscar', 'awarded', 'him.Finally', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'suffers', 'what', 'many', 'films', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'too', 'many', 'villains', 'overuse', 'special', 'effects', 'violence', 'expense', 'character', 'hazy', 'plot', 'just', 'thrown', 'together.Although', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Bane', 'worthy', 'menace', 'Batman', 'Bane', 'admirably', 'role', 'film', 'rather', 'lacklusterly', 'rather', 'predictable', 'note', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'alone', 'move', 'too', 'slowly.Additional', 'acting', 'kudos', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'other', 'regulars', 'common', 'films', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Lucius', 'Fox', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'faithful', 'butler', 'Alfred', 'Pennyworth.Overall', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'films', '1', '2', '3', 'stars', 'conclusion', 'trilogy']",The Dark Knight: Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises)

1597180,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B009JBWOU0,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[31, 44]","We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now. No movies show that as perfectly as Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" -- three movies that explore the formative years of the legendary superhero Batman, from the beginning of his crusade for justice to the explosive climax. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.""Batman Begins"": After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But then Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate Gotham, his home city.Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink. Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.""The Dark Knight"" is feeling pretty good about his battle against crime, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. Even worse, he has the ultimate way of blackmailing Batman into doing what he wants: holding all of Gotham hostage.""The Dark Knight rises picks up eight years later -- crime is almost gone, Batman has vanished, and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But then a terrifying masked man named Bane arrives in Gotham, attacking Batman as revenge for the League's destruction. He will turn Gotham into a living nightmare, unless the Dark Knight can rise again...Most directors would have given these movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers them with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"","" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.The most striking part of these movies is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. He heaps more tragedy and trauma on Batman than just his parents' death, and delicately traces the moral boundaries -- or lack of them -- between Batman and his foes.Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. Michael Caine is awesome as his faithful butler/father figure, and there are solid backing performances by Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman.And the performances of the villain actors are absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows of the late Heath Ledger's spellbindingly chilling performance as the Joker, a casually corrosive creature who believes himself to be the yin to Batman's yang. But Tom Hardy and Liam Neeson are also brilliant as cunning, clever people who are determined to destroy Gotham.The biggest problem is that Nolan isn't very good at casting women. Maggie Gyllenhaal and the pouty Katie Holmes are both hideously miscast as the cruel, manipulative Rachel Dawes, who treats Bruce's heart like a toy. Anne Hathaway is the best of the bunch -- a pretty baffling choice as Catwoman, but she does a decent job.""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.",5,He rises,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,4047,"['are', 'golden', 'age', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'right', 'now', 'movies', 'show', 'as', 'perfectly', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'three', 'movies', 'explore', 'formative', 'years', 'legendary', 'superhero', 'Batman', 'beginning', 'crusade', 'justice', 'explosive', 'climax', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'capes', 'tights', 'can', 'appreciate', 'story', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'parents', 'murderer', 'paroled', 'young', 'bazillionaire', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'vanishes', 'aimless', 'journey', 'world', 'taken', 'wing', 'mysterious', 'Henri', 'Ducard', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'train', 'be', 'member', 'League', 'Shadows', 'then', 'Bruce', 'League', 'annihilate', 'Gotham', 'home', 'city.Gotham', 'become', 'rotten', 'core', 'mobs', 'crooked', 'cops', 'fear-inducing', 'shrink', 'Using', 'company', 'discarded', 'prototypes', 'Bruce', 'armored', 'bodysuit', 'tanklike', 'vehicle', 'fight', 'crime', 'League', 'still', 'plans', 'destroy', 'Gotham', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'good', 'battle', 'crime', 'especially', 'new', 'DA', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'morally-upright', 'good-guy', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'Joker', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'mad', 'clownish', 'psychopath', 'who', 'hired', 'mob', 'destroy', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Even', 'worse', 'ultimate', 'way', 'blackmailing', 'Batman', 'doing', 'what', 'holding', 'Gotham', 'hostage', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'up', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'crime', 'almost', 'gone', 'Batman', 'vanished', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'recluse', 'then', 'terrifying', 'masked', 'man', 'named', 'Bane', 'arrives', 'Gotham', 'attacking', 'Batman', 'revenge', 'League', 'destruction', 'will', 'turn', 'Gotham', 'living', 'nightmare', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'can', 'rise', 'again', 'Most', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'distinctly', 'comic-book', 'slick', 'pop-culture', 'feel', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'search', 'not', 'single', 'hint', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'anything', 'kitschy', 'campy', 'came', 'was', 'originally', 'comic', 'book', 'Instead', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'movie', 'dark', 'tightly-wound', 'intense', 'Batman', 'himself.But', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'Nolan', 'kinetic', 'action', 'high-speed', 'chases', 'massive', 'explosions', 'dialogue', 'drizzled', 'dry', 'humor', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'said', 'wanted', 'inspire', 'people', 'Batman', 'looking', 'bunch', 'impersonators', 'mostly', 'temper', 'overhanging', 'sense', 'horror', 'most', 'striking', 'part', 'movies', 'Nolan', 'delving', 'morality', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'more', 'tragedy', 'trauma', 'Batman', 'just', 'parents', 'death', 'delicately', 'moral', 'boundaries', 'lack', 'Batman', 'foes.Christian', 'Bale', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'sure', 'growly', 'voice', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'silly', 'times', 'perfectly', 'conveys', 'strength', 'pain', 'determination', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'save', 'others', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'awesome', 'faithful', 'butler/father', 'figure', 'are', 'solid', 'backing', 'performances', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Gary', 'Oldman.And', 'performances', 'villain', 'actors', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Everybody', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'spellbindingly', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Joker', 'casually', 'corrosive', 'creature', 'who', 'be', 'yin', 'Batman', 'yang', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'are', 'also', 'brilliant', 'cunning', 'clever', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'destroy', 'Gotham.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'casting', 'women', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'pouty', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'are', 'hideously', 'miscast', 'cruel', 'manipulative', 'Rachel', 'Dawes', 'who', 'Bruce', 'heart', 'toy', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'best', 'bunch', 'pretty', 'baffling', 'choice', 'Catwoman', 'decent', 'job', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'dark', 'gritty', 'richly-imagined', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'quest', 'chaos', 'evil']",The Dark Knight: Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises)

He demanded that the live action shots be filmed as much as possible through actual well executed stunts and avoided an over use of CGI.  This gives the movies a more realistic gritty feel.
