Love for the novel is apparent throughout this intensive drama. However, having read the beautiful novel  by Toni Morrison, I have to say that the movie came short of the impact of  the book.  In the novel, the events building to the climax are subtle, sad,  and even poetic.  Their power is there, but deep and trembling below the  surface.  In the film, however, they are emboldened - a visual and  emotional bombardment. The story itself is a devastating masterpiece.  Those who have never read the novel will very likely love this movie.  It  possesses masterful dramatic performances, cinematography, and musical  scoring. Yet for those who have already read the book, the expectations may  go well beyond even the artistic beauty of this fine film.",3,Very Fine in its Own Right,963532800,"07 14, 2000",2000,868,"['Obviously', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'endeavor', 'heart', 'not', 'only', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Love', 'novel', 'apparent', 'intensive', 'drama', 'However', 'having', 'read', 'beautiful', 'novel', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'came', 'short', 'impact', 'book', 'novel', 'events', 'building', 'climax', 'are', 'subtle', 'sad', 'even', 'poetic', 'power', 'there', 'deep', 'trembling', 'surface', 'film', 'however', 'are', 'emboldened', 'visual', 'emotional', 'bombardment', 'story', 'devastating', 'masterpiece', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'love', 'movie', 'masterful', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'scoring', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'expectations', 'may', 'go', 'well', 'even', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'fine', 'film']",Beloved
81645,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788815474,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Some novels are not meant to be adapted into film form.  That isn't to say that they wouldn't make good films, or that we wouldn't want to see them played out, but it merely means that the content is not formatted in an accessible way.  Sometimes, what we can take in through the printed page can come across gaudy, campy and just plain awkward on the big screen.  I fear that that is what befell `Beloved', a film that is ripe with presence, atmosphere and most importantly emotion;  but it is also a film that just doesn't quite work.In parts, sure; but not as a whole.`Beloved' tells the graphic and disturbing tale of a former slave named Sethe who has rebuilt her life in Ohio.  She has a quiet presence with her daughter Denver and she has basically secluded herself and her daughter from those around her.  Sethe's past is one of tragedy and turmoil, and because of that past her home is currently haunted; not by evil but by sadness.  When a familiar face shows up on her doorstep, Sethe's past begins to unravel before her.  Paul D. is a man who knows her well, but has been absent from her life for eighteen years and thus isn't privy to the atrocities she's seen.  Just as life begins to settle in for Sethe, Paul D. and Denver another young woman enters their lives.  Beloved, cold, wet and manifesting signs of mental retardation or sheer insanity, begins to stake her mark in their home.  Who is this woman and why is Sethe so drawn to her?The film's construction makes it rather difficult to truly immerse yourself in the story.  The fragmented storytelling, with flashbacks and dreams, make it hard to stay focused.  I feel that the way the possession or haunting of Sethe's home was also handled rather awkwardly.  The film had moments were it felt more like a cheap horror film than a legitimate dramatic tale.  I also have a slight issue with Thandie Newton's performance.  It is easy to praise her for her physical distortions and committed theatrics, but she also lost control of herself in a few areas and came across almost comical, which took away from the dramatics of the film.  Her final scene was a mess, and her facial contortions were from believably psychotic to campy and laughable.That said, there are some elements that must be praised.  The cinematography is stellar; the lighting capturing the moody feel of the film flawlessly; and the flashback colorization really elevated those scenes with Beah Richards (who was stellar here).  Oprah and Danny Clover were both very effective in their roles; but it was Kimberly Elise and LisaGay Hamilton who really should receive top mentions with regards to the acting.  Elise in particular was grounded throughout and showed true signs of character development; and Hamilton sold her biggest scene, which would have fallen to pieces had she not conveyed such emotional conviction.  The score and technical merits (like costume design) are all top notch here as well.I just wish that `Beloved' as a whole felt more organic and cohesive.  Instead, it feels strangely disengaged from itself and unsure of the approach it wants to take.  There is a lot of ground to cover, and Jonathan Demme and his team of screenwriters seem lost in their idea of HOW to make this movie.",3,Not the right approach...,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,3246,"['novels', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'adapted', 'film', 'form', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'merely', 'content', 'not', 'formatted', 'accessible', 'way', 'Sometimes', 'what', 'can', 'take', 'printed', 'page', 'can', 'come', 'gaudy', 'campy', 'just', 'plain', 'awkward', 'big', 'screen', 'fear', 'what', 'befell', 'Beloved', 'film', 'ripe', 'presence', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'importantly', 'emotion', 'also', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.In', 'parts', 'sure', 'not', 'whole.', 'Beloved', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'former', 'slave', 'named', 'Sethe', 'who', 'rebuilt', 'life', 'Ohio', 'quiet', 'presence', 'daughter', 'Denver', 'basically', 'secluded', 'herself', 'daughter', 'Sethe', 'past', 'one', 'tragedy', 'turmoil', 'past', 'home', 'currently', 'haunted', 'not', 'evil', 'sadness', 'When', 'familiar', 'face', 'up', 'doorstep', 'Sethe', 'past', 'unravel', 'Paul', 'D.', 'man', 'who', 'well', 'been', 'absent', 'life', 'eighteen', 'years', 'thus', ""n't"", 'privy', 'atrocities', 'seen', 'Just', 'life', 'settle', 'Sethe', 'Paul', 'D.', 'Denver', 'young', 'woman', 'lives', 'Beloved', 'cold', 'wet', 'manifesting', 'signs', 'mental', 'retardation', 'sheer', 'insanity', 'stake', 'mark', 'home', 'Who', 'woman', 'why', 'Sethe', 'so', 'her', 'film', 'construction', 'rather', 'difficult', 'truly', 'immerse', 'story', 'fragmented', 'storytelling', 'flashbacks', 'dreams', 'make', 'hard', 'stay', 'focused', 'feel', 'way', 'possession', 'haunting', 'Sethe', 'home', 'was', 'also', 'handled', 'rather', 'awkwardly', 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'felt', 'more', 'cheap', 'horror', 'film', 'legitimate', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'also', 'have', 'slight', 'issue', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'performance', 'easy', 'praise', 'physical', 'distortions', 'committed', 'theatrics', 'also', 'lost', 'control', 'herself', 'few', 'areas', 'came', 'almost', 'comical', 'took', 'away', 'dramatics', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'mess', 'facial', 'contortions', 'were', 'believably', 'psychotic', 'campy', 'said', 'are', 'elements', 'must', 'be', 'praised', 'cinematography', 'stellar', 'lighting', 'capturing', 'moody', 'feel', 'film', 'flawlessly', 'flashback', 'colorization', 'really', 'elevated', 'scenes', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'who', 'was', 'stellar', 'here', 'Oprah', 'Danny', 'Clover', 'were', 'very', 'effective', 'roles', 'was', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'LisaGay', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'receive', 'top', 'mentions', 'regards', 'acting', 'Elise', 'particular', 'was', 'grounded', 'showed', 'true', 'signs', 'character', 'development', 'Hamilton', 'sold', 'biggest', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'pieces', 'had', 'not', 'conveyed', 'such', 'emotional', 'conviction', 'score', 'technical', 'merits', 'costume', 'design', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'well.I', 'just', 'wish', 'Beloved', 'whole', 'felt', 'more', 'organic', 'cohesive', 'Instead', 'strangely', 'disengaged', 'unsure', 'approach', 'take', 'lot', 'ground', 'cover', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'team', 'screenwriters', 'seem', 'lost', 'idea', 'HOW', 'make', 'movie']",Beloved

Oprah Winfrey (to all of our shock and amazement) is an unbelievably wonderful actress (proof: this film and ""The Color Purple"") who should appear in many more films, but, undoubtedly, is preoccupied elsewhere.  I nearly wish she would stop her talk show and become a full-time actress, she needs to make more feature film appearances.  Danny Glover is able to show an indefinable range of character (proof: this film and the fact that he has also been in the ""Lethal Weapon"" 4some as well as appear in a role as profound as ""The Color Purple"").  Thandie Newton is a rising star that brightens up the screen even with a dark and moody performance, and should be noted as a powerhouse screen presence in the making.

81650,AJI8AE4LR8P5A,0788815474,Brian Niven,"[8, 9]","Beloved is an excellent movie.Beloved was adapted from Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name.Jonathan Demme's strong direction, Tak Fujimoto's stunning photography (especially the yellow tinted flashbacks), the sets, the costumes, the acting, all come together to create a towering achievement in filmmaking.Oprah is very impressive in the role of Sethe a former slave who is haunted by her violent past. So many scenes are noteworthy. The 28 days of freedom scene, the They took my milk scene, her final scene, and others. Oprah deserves much of the credit for this great movie, as she is the one who fought for ten years to get it made.Kimberly Elise gives a greatly sympathetic performance as Denver, Sethe's daughter. There is an undercurrent of strength in her character that comes out when she is in the forefront of the movie. Her character is comparable to Celie in The Color Purple, in terms of the ultimate strength of her character.Thandie Newton is riveting in the title role of Beloved. She gives an intense performance that turned many people off. It is really rare to see an actor give a performance as bold as hers.Danny Glover gives a fine performance as Paul D. also a former slave who has spent his post slave years wondering around the U.S.Special attention has to be paid to Beah Richards as Baby Suggs. She gives the type of performance that should be taught in acting classes. The passion and commitment are astounding. The scenes where she is preaching in the clearing are breathtaking and inspirational. She more than deserved a second Oscar nomination. The first being for Guess Who's coming to Dinner.Rachel Portman's score perfectly compliments the movie. It also stands out by itself as a work of art. She won an Oscar for Emma (1996) and has been nominated several times since, but oddly not for Beloved, which may be her best work.",5,A Great Film,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,1886,"['Beloved', 'excellent', 'movie.Beloved', 'was', 'adapted', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'same', 'name.Jonathan', 'Demme', 'strong', 'direction', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'stunning', 'photography', 'especially', 'yellow', 'tinted', 'flashbacks', 'sets', 'costumes', 'acting', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'towering', 'achievement', 'filmmaking.Oprah', 'very', 'impressive', 'role', 'Sethe', 'former', 'slave', 'who', 'haunted', 'violent', 'past', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'noteworthy', '28', 'days', 'freedom', 'scene', 'took', 'milk', 'scene', 'final', 'scene', 'others', 'Oprah', 'much', 'credit', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'who', 'fought', 'ten', 'years', 'get', 'made.Kimberly', 'Elise', 'greatly', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'Denver', 'Sethe', 'daughter', 'undercurrent', 'strength', 'character', 'out', 'when', 'forefront', 'movie', 'character', 'comparable', 'Celie', 'Color', 'Purple', 'terms', 'ultimate', 'strength', 'character.Thandie', 'Newton', 'riveting', 'title', 'role', 'Beloved', 'intense', 'performance', 'turned', 'many', 'people', 'off', 'really', 'rare', 'see', 'actor', 'give', 'performance', 'as', 'bold', 'hers.Danny', 'Glover', 'fine', 'performance', 'Paul', 'D.', 'also', 'former', 'slave', 'who', 'spent', 'post', 'slave', 'years', 'wondering', 'U.S.Special', 'attention', 'be', 'paid', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'Baby', 'Suggs', 'type', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'acting', 'classes', 'passion', 'commitment', 'are', 'astounding', 'scenes', 'where', 'preaching', 'clearing', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'inspirational', 'more', 'deserved', 'second', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'first', 'being', 'Guess', 'Who', 'coming', 'Dinner.Rachel', 'Portman', 'score', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'also', 'out', 'work', 'art', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Emma', '1996', 'been', 'nominated', 'several', 'times', 'oddly', 'not', 'Beloved', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'work']",Beloved

My favorite character in the movie ""Beloved"" was like a hippie visionary: Miss Amy Denver of Boston told Sethe:You have a chokecherry tree on your back.The religious sequences breathing the air of freedom were quite a contrast to the exploitation for economic reasons that caused so many slaves to run away from Sweet Home. Halle's spirit being broken by seeing the schoolteacher tell how to take Sethe's milk like milking a cow is quite uncanny.

It came on televison a few weeks back, but I purposefully avoided watching it on network TV, since I'm sure some parts would be edited out.I'm quite confused by so many negative reviews here.  So many people use The Color Purple as a reference point, which is entirely plausable.  In fact, I myself draw parallels between Beloved and The Color Purple, even to Their Eyes Were Watching God.  The overall impression I get from the mixed/negative reviews is that, while The Color Purple is heartwarming, Beloved is weird and cold.  It seems that people forget that The Color Purple deals also with disturbing themes, like incest.  It's just that they come to the forefront of Beloved a whole lot more.  Honestly, what do people want, a reprise of The Color Purple?If you read between the lines, many reviewers here have been dumbed down by a stream of Hollywood films.  When Thandie Newton stands stark naked and pregnant on the porch in broad daylight, it is NOT a sexy scene.  Shame on those who equate nudity with titillating sex scenes and nothing else.  I could go on and on... peruse the reviews for yourself.Overall, I was quite satisfied with the film.  Yes, I had questions that weren't answered, such as why Paul D refers to Beloved as ""red heart"" during a pivotal scene.  Still, most of the questions you have will be answered if you pay close attention, and rewind a couple of scenes.If there is one thing I would have liked more, it would have been more of the backstory of the town of Sweet Home.  You only get a small glimpse and understanding through flashback.  While this makes for good cinema, it does leave your curiosity unsatisfied.

81659,A2ZM8EB204V6JG,0788815474,D. Davis,"[1, 4]","Well, I knew what to expect when Oprah spoke so highly of this film to her  dumpy, white, mostly-female Chicago audience--as though she felt she had to  push these mushy images on the American public.  I've been teaching  Morrison's novel for years--but this film, in many ways, outraged me.  Where to start?  With Winfrey's portrayal of Sethe?  She does all right;  when Winfrey played Sophia in &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; she was almost  an unknown.  &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; had not become the cultural  landmark it is today.  Winfrey, as Sethe, just gets in the way--no matter  how much like a former Ohio slave she was made to look, one is still  looking at Oprah as Sethe and not at Morrison's brilliant literary  character.  Bea Richards was okay as Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law--in  terms of what this film allows her to do.  Baby Suggs is a central  character of the novel--a Morrisonian archetype--but the film makes her so  peripheral.  Danny Glover is satisfactory as Morrison's hero, Paul D, but  didn't we get enough of him as Mister in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;?  There are many talented actors today who could've done justice to the role  of Paul D?  Thandie Newton as the child returned as a ghost is okay, but  far too facially angelic to be the Beloved I've pictured.  And who told her  to squak and croak in that voice?  Yes, we get it; she's really two years  old, the age she was when her mother, Sethe, killed her.  The only  redeeming portrayal in this film comes from Kimberly Elise, who plays  Morrison's alive and scorned daughter, Denver.  Elise is everything the  daughter Denver is supposed to be:  wounded, afraid, longing, and,  ultimately, in small small steps (she finally goes out of the yard)  victorious.Richard La Gravanese (creator of the very lovely  &quot;Living Out Loud&quot;--available from amazon.com--with Holly Hunter  and Danny DeVito) had no business writing this adaptation.  Too many of  Morrison's crucial nuanaces were deleted or ignored all together.  And why  Jonathan Demme was given reign over a film that could have been so  important--really a highwater mark of American filmmaking--and so  everlasting is beyond me.  Oprah really blew it big time with that choice.The cinematography is quite stunning and very beautiful.  The Ohio  seasons are captured quite beautifully.  The soundtrack is also dynamic and  stirring--far better than most of the major performances which are bumbling  and idiotic.  The angelic voices of a choir rise up from Africa and post  Civil War America.Overall, the flat and insipid performances create  the opposite of the world Morrison so brilliantly created during that five  year period of writing this masterpiece.  The film is unspiteful, un-loud  and, ultimately, very very quiet.  It may remain with you after your  viewing--but it's not saying anything as profound as Toni Morrison--a  literary genius--did.",2,From Literary Masterpiece to Cinematic Disaster,959904000,"06 2, 2000",2000,2923,"['Well', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'Oprah', 'spoke', 'so', 'highly', 'film', 'dumpy', 'white', 'mostly-female', 'Chicago', 'audience', 'felt', 'had', 'push', 'mushy', 'images', 'American', 'public', ""'ve"", 'been', 'teaching', 'Morrison', 'novel', 'years', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'outraged', 'Where', 'start', 'Winfrey', 'portrayal', 'Sethe', 'all', 'right', 'when', 'Winfrey', 'played', 'Sophia', 'quot', 'Color', 'Purple', 'quot', 'was', 'almost', 'unknown', 'quot', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Show', 'quot', 'had', 'not', 'become', 'cultural', 'landmark', 'today', 'Winfrey', 'Sethe', 'just', 'way', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'former', 'Ohio', 'slave', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'one', 'still', 'looking', 'Oprah', 'Sethe', 'not', 'Morrison', 'brilliant', 'literary', 'character', 'Bea', 'Richards', 'was', 'okay', 'Baby', 'Suggs', 'Sethe', 'mother-in-law', 'terms', 'what', 'film', 'do', 'Baby', 'Suggs', 'central', 'character', 'novel', 'Morrisonian', 'archetype', 'film', 'so', 'peripheral', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'satisfactory', 'Morrison', 'hero', 'Paul', 'D', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Mister', 'quot', 'Color', 'Purple', 'quot', 'are', 'many', 'talented', 'actors', 'today', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'justice', 'role', 'Paul', 'D', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'child', 'returned', 'ghost', 'okay', 'far', 'too', 'facially', 'angelic', 'be', 'Beloved', ""'ve"", 'pictured', 'who', 'told', 'squak', 'croak', 'voice', 'Yes', 'get', 'really', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'age', 'was', 'when', 'mother', 'Sethe', 'killed', 'only', 'redeeming', 'portrayal', 'film', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'who', 'Morrison', 'alive', 'scorned', 'daughter', 'Denver', 'Elise', 'everything', 'daughter', 'Denver', 'supposed', 'be', 'wounded', 'afraid', 'longing', 'ultimately', 'small', 'small', 'steps', 'finally', 'yard', 'victorious.Richard', 'La', 'Gravanese', 'creator', 'very', 'lovely', 'quot', 'Living', 'Out', 'Loud', 'quot', 'available', 'amazon.com', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'had', 'business', 'writing', 'adaptation', 'Too', 'many', 'Morrison', 'crucial', 'nuanaces', 'were', 'deleted', 'ignored', 'together', 'why', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'was', 'given', 'reign', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'important', 'really', 'highwater', 'mark', 'American', 'filmmaking', 'so', 'everlasting', 'Oprah', 'really', 'blew', 'big', 'time', 'choice.The', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'stunning', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Ohio', 'seasons', 'are', 'captured', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'dynamic', 'stirring', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'major', 'performances', 'are', 'bumbling', 'idiotic', 'angelic', 'voices', 'choir', 'rise', 'up', 'Africa', 'post', 'Civil', 'War', 'America.Overall', 'flat', 'insipid', 'performances', 'create', 'opposite', 'world', 'Morrison', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'created', 'five', 'year', 'period', 'writing', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'unspiteful', 'un-loud', 'ultimately', 'very', 'very', 'quiet', 'may', 'remain', 'viewing', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'as', 'profound', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'literary', 'genius', 'did']",Beloved

Like the Color Purple and even Roots, there was some history in the mix, however, the mysticism threw me off a little.

Toni Morrison's award-winning BELOVED is a tough read but a rewarding one.I'm giving the movie version two stars because of the attempt at making this book a film. I know that most movies pale in comparison to their paper inspirations, but this is a book that shouldn't have -- couldn't have -- been made into a quality adaption. Yes, you could make it a good slave/ghost story, but to keep out the beauty of Morrison's language and sentence structuring would be a travesty.  Kudos for Demme to realize this, but by trying to involve the poetry and style of the novel, he's made a mess of a film. And the beautiful and talented Thandie Newton is ... distracting. Her personification of Beloved borders on comical every time she tries to communicate with other characters.

I think this movie is one of the most underappreciated works of cinema.  It should be deemed a major contribution to women's films and black films.  I cried watching the film just because so much of it stirred my emotions.Critics have said that viewers could not relate to the Beloved character.  I usually do not care for Thandie Newton.  She's usually just a pretty face in damsel-in-distress roles.  However, she really pushed the envelope with this role.  It took a lot of strength to play a ghostly woman-baby.  It takes tremendous ability to perform the googly-eyed, infantil manners that she makes.  In the theater, I screamed twice, once at her entrance and once toward her exit.  Additionally, I think Beloved the character may have been a metaphor for us African Americans.  She wanted to know about her past.  She wanted to know why she was separated from her family.  She was one of a kind and shrouded in controversy.Others have said that the movie did not focus enough upon slavery as the book did.  I am quite sure that if more of the horrors of slavery were shown, then people of all races, but especially non-African-Americans, would be scared off and make illogical claims about ""playing the race card.""  This movie does a fantastic job in showing the catch-22 placed upon 19th-century Black American women.  It shows how even working-class communities can punish their own members for not enacting middle-class values.  Further, if the viewer looks carefully the racism of the time is continuously hinted at throughout the film.Oprah plays well against her persona.  She's the only African-American female billionaire, yet she's playing a poor ex-slave.  She is usually seen in glamourous outfits, yet here she and the other characters wear no makeup.  On her show, she's portrayed as in control of the world.  In this film, her mental state is shattered and even her body can't control itself.  Oprah is not a mother, yet she does a wonderful job in showing a mother's unending love for her daughters.  I love all of Kimberly Elise's films, Set It Off, Bojangles, you name it.  This actress has the Midas touch and this film is one more example of that.This film, despite the computer graphics, showed the beauty of Midwestern flora and fauna.  The actresses wore rich indigo dress and ornate hairstyles.  This was a strong period piece.  The script is filled with rich dialogue.  ""Your love is too thick, Sethe.""  ""Love is or it isn't.  Thin love ain't no love at all.""  ""She my best thing."" ""No, you're your best thing.""  ""Sometimes I think she was my sister and sometimes I know she was.""""Beloved"" is becoming one of the most read texts in American English classes.  I think this film will help students understand a rigorous author like Morrison.  However, because this movie only shows a slice of the book, students will still have to do their reading and not just rely on the film.",5,Don't  let box office failure trick you.,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,2997,"['was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'copy', 'Beloved', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'winning', 'film', 'awards', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'works', 'cinema', 'should', 'be', 'deemed', 'major', 'contribution', 'women', 'films', 'black', 'films', 'cried', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'stirred', 'emotions.Critics', 'have', 'said', 'viewers', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'Beloved', 'character', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'usually', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'damsel-in-distress', 'roles', 'However', 'really', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'role', 'took', 'lot', 'strength', 'play', 'ghostly', 'woman-baby', 'tremendous', 'ability', 'perform', 'googly-eyed', 'infantil', 'manners', 'theater', 'screamed', 'twice', 'once', 'entrance', 'once', 'exit', 'Additionally', 'think', 'Beloved', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'metaphor', 'African', 'Americans', 'wanted', 'know', 'past', 'wanted', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'separated', 'family', 'was', 'one', 'kind', 'shrouded', 'controversy.Others', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'enough', 'upon', 'slavery', 'book', 'did', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'more', 'horrors', 'slavery', 'were', 'shown', 'then', 'people', 'races', 'especially', 'non-African-Americans', 'would', 'be', 'scared', 'off', 'make', 'illogical', 'claims', 'playing', 'race', 'card', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'job', 'showing', 'catch-22', 'placed', '19th-century', 'Black', 'American', 'women', 'how', 'even', 'working-class', 'communities', 'can', 'punish', 'own', 'members', 'not', 'enacting', 'middle-class', 'values', 'Further', 'viewer', 'carefully', 'racism', 'time', 'continuously', 'hinted', 'film.Oprah', 'well', 'persona', 'only', 'African-American', 'female', 'billionaire', 'playing', 'poor', 'ex-slave', 'usually', 'seen', 'glamourous', 'outfits', 'yet', 'here', 'other', 'characters', 'wear', 'makeup', 'show', 'portrayed', 'control', 'world', 'film', 'mental', 'state', 'shattered', 'even', 'body', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'Oprah', 'not', 'mother', 'yet', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'mother', 'unending', 'love', 'daughters', 'love', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'films', 'Set', 'Off', 'Bojangles', 'name', 'actress', 'Midas', 'touch', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'that.This', 'film', 'computer', 'graphics', 'showed', 'beauty', 'Midwestern', 'flora', 'fauna', 'actresses', 'wore', 'rich', 'indigo', 'dress', 'ornate', 'hairstyles', 'was', 'strong', 'period', 'piece', 'script', 'filled', 'rich', 'dialogue', 'love', 'too', 'thick', 'Sethe', 'Love', ""n't"", 'Thin', 'love', 'ai', ""n't"", 'love', 'best', 'thing', 'No', ""'re"", 'best', 'thing', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'was', 'sister', 'sometimes', 'know', 'was', 'Beloved', 'becoming', 'one', 'most', 'read', 'texts', 'American', 'English', 'classes', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'students', 'understand', 'rigorous', 'author', 'Morrison', 'However', 'movie', 'only', 'slice', 'book', 'students', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'do', 'reading', 'not', 'just', 'rely', 'film']",Beloved

81681,A2GBQRSI8FPAL,0788815474,K. O. Gibson,"[4, 4]","I saw this film in the theater its opening weekend, October 1998. Oprah devoted her Friday episode of the opening weekend to the cast of 'Beloved' and was in tears about the release of her 'baby' with this film. 'Beloved' is one of my top three favorite books of all time for its poetic, brutal power in relating the human/spiritual tolls and scars of slavery. I went to this movie hopeful, as a book lover hoping that the source-material hadn't been ruined. No film can ever replace the original mind's eye 'movie' of the book it's based on, but Ms. Winfrey, Mr. Demme and the cast absolutely gave their all to this production. It's a worthy, devastating film; the tragedy of slavery and the human reconstruction, not just societal, from such human cruelty is incomprehensible.'Beloved' is not an easy film to watch by the sheer realism of the fear, violence and horror of the protagonist's story, Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey and Lisa Gay Hamilton. As with any film dealing with historic atrocity ('Schindler's List,' 'Playing For Time,' 'Roots,') it is impossible to turn away no matter how harsh the onscreen reality is. Perhaps because we know it was worse in reality, it becomes a matter of honoring their struggle by bearing witness to the recreation. In any case, it's a demanding film but the acting work by Danny Glover, Kimberly Elyse, Thandi Newton, Winfrey and Beah Richards will pull you in with both hands.Over the years I've heard Ms. Winfrey say in interviews how she regrets the failure of this movie at the box-office. I don't find it to be a failure at all. It's an honest, stark mirror of its material, not a popcorn movie, per se. Maybe it would have done better and won Emmys had it been on, say, HBO where the network would have allowed the same depictions as shown in the movie? We'll never know, but I put my money down on it and it's here for people to discover on DVD via purchase, rental or Netflix.

81683,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0788815474,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 8]","This is an important film of Academy Award caliber. The characters are unforgettable and the story, with its haunting surreal quality, will linger long in my mind.  I personally find Toni Morrison difficult and confusing to read.  This was true of the book.  Translated to film, however, the story works, and I found myself intrigued and interested in the tale set in 1873 of former slaves, making a new life for themselves and still living with the horror of the past.Hooray for Danny Glover.  He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress.  Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well known, she was always more Oprah  to me than the character she was playing.  The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I didn't realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton.  She's in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding.At almost three hours the video is too long.  Some of the middle could have been honed down.  Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton,  have many scenes together.  The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points.  While played beautifully by the  two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie better.Beloved is the story of some troubled people told against a historical background that has never been really done well in a film before.  It's a somber story, with not a bit of comic relief to relieve the tension that keeps mounting.  It is also a classic tale of sin and punishment and, finally, a sort of redemption.

81686,A152C8GYY25HAH,0788815474,Matthew Horner,"[6, 9]","Most movies are made for purely commercial reasons. Others are a labor of love. It's easy enough to dissect the former. Those in the latter category, such as Beloved, are more challenging for a thinking critic, especially when the labor does not produce a very good movie.Oprah Winfrey, the undisputed Queen of the TV talk shows, co-produced and starred in the film. It is based on the book by the award-winning writer, Toni Morrison. It has a remarkable cast.Any story revolving around America just before and after The Civil War is probably uncommercial. The period may have seemed glamorous to the general public in Gone With the Wind in 1939, but that remarkable movie was made two decades prior to the Civil Rights Movement. Nowadays, that period of history is one that is painful for either race to dwell on. Slavery was rightfully ended, but equality came much too slowly.Beloved is the story of Sethe [Winfrey], a former slave who escaped to freedom in Ohio during the war. She is forced to leave behind her family and the man she loves. What she cannot escape are the nightmare memories of her former life. Her new world is soon marred by a tragic event which will haunt her [literally] for the rest of her life.Sixteen years after she begins her life in Ohio, another ex-slave from the same plantation shows up. He is Paul D. [Danny Glover], who knew her well then, but knows nothing of her life as a free woman. She takes him in, and he tries to bring some joy to the life of her young daughter, Denver [Kimberly Elise]. Their lives are soon thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a girl with no memory of her past. This is Beloved [Thandie Newton], who may or may not be Sethe's other daughter.Sadly, the picture is marred by several technical flaws. The main problem is with the source material. Some authors write in a manner which is not possible to translate easily to film. Toni Morrison, for example, uses flashbacks, dream sequences and illusions. The movie's writers, as well as director Jonathan Demme, seem lost as to how to handle these important elements. The result disappoints who have read the book and is almost indecipherable to those who have not.While I admire brevity, a quality I do not possess, I rarely care how long a movie runs, as long as it has something to say. Beloved takes nearly three hours to unfold. A more inspired production could have said it all in two hours or less.Still, there are moments that shimmer, thanks largely to the artistic cinematography of Tak Fujimoto. Rachel Portman wrote an evocative musical score. Both Kimberley Elise and Thandie Newton are young actresses of immense talent. Both do what they can with their confining roles. Winfrey and Glover have some other great movies to their credit, and we assume they will have more in the future.",3,Well-intentioned movie doesn't quite work,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2809,"['Most', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'purely', 'commercial', 'reasons', 'Others', 'are', 'labor', 'love', 'easy', 'enough', 'dissect', 'former', 'latter', 'category', 'such', 'Beloved', 'are', 'more', 'challenging', 'thinking', 'critic', 'especially', 'when', 'labor', 'not', 'produce', 'very', 'good', 'movie.Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'undisputed', 'Queen', 'TV', 'talk', 'co-produced', 'starred', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'award-winning', 'writer', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'remarkable', 'cast.Any', 'story', 'revolving', 'America', 'just', 'before', 'Civil', 'War', 'probably', 'uncommercial', 'period', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'glamorous', 'general', 'public', 'Gone', 'Wind', '1939', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'decades', 'prior', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'Nowadays', 'period', 'history', 'one', 'painful', 'race', 'dwell', 'Slavery', 'was', 'rightfully', 'ended', 'equality', 'came', 'much', 'too', 'slowly.Beloved', 'story', 'Sethe', '[', 'Winfrey', ']', 'former', 'slave', 'who', 'escaped', 'freedom', 'Ohio', 'war', 'forced', 'leave', 'family', 'man', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'are', 'nightmare', 'memories', 'former', 'life', 'new', 'world', 'soon', 'marred', 'tragic', 'event', 'will', 'haunt', '[', 'literally', 'rest', 'life.Sixteen', 'years', 'life', 'Ohio', 'ex-slave', 'same', 'plantation', 'up', 'Paul', 'D.', '[', 'Danny', 'Glover', ']', 'who', 'knew', 'well', 'then', 'nothing', 'life', 'free', 'woman', 'bring', 'joy', 'life', 'young', 'daughter', 'Denver', '[', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', ']', 'lives', 'are', 'soon', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'arrival', 'girl', 'memory', 'past', 'Beloved', '[', 'Thandie', 'Newton', ']', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Sethe', 'other', 'daughter.Sadly', 'picture', 'marred', 'several', 'technical', 'flaws', 'main', 'problem', 'source', 'material', 'authors', 'write', 'manner', 'not', 'possible', 'translate', 'easily', 'film', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'example', 'flashbacks', 'dream', 'sequences', 'illusions', 'movie', 'writers', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'seem', 'lost', 'how', 'handle', 'important', 'elements', 'result', 'disappoints', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'almost', 'indecipherable', 'who', 'have', 'not.While', 'admire', 'brevity', 'quality', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'rarely', 'care', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'something', 'say', 'Beloved', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'unfold', 'more', 'inspired', 'production', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'two', 'hours', 'less.Still', 'are', 'moments', 'shimmer', 'thanks', 'largely', 'artistic', 'cinematography', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'wrote', 'evocative', 'musical', 'score', 'Kimberley', 'Elise', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'are', 'young', 'actresses', 'immense', 'talent', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'confining', 'roles', 'Winfrey', 'Glover', 'have', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'credit', 'assume', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'future']",Beloved

Yet, as much as I loved the book, this film comes close to failure for a very simple reason.  The Toni Morrison novel tells a story that works  very well within the art of literature.  The arch of climax of the book is  not a narrative one but a lyrical and literary one.  Demme and Winfrey  chose to tell the story in the exact same order which Morrison chose but in  a film this sequence is very unfulfilling and seems to just drift and stop.  While the performances were fine (except for Newton's bizarre choices for  Beloved) and the film is superbly shot and scored, this problem could have  only been fixed by not adapting this novel or twisting it into a different  order.

Words cannot describe the intense amounts of emotion and dedication the film-makers had when they did this. This movie has all of the beauty, and power that every  great film displays.  The movie is about a former slave named Seth and the  struggles her family has to endure. The ghost of her slain daughter haunts  the house, and her surviving daughter has become a recluse. She breaks down  crying when she tells her mother that she has no friends because of that  house. Seth is determined to hold her ground. She'll never run from  anything as long as she lives. An old friend from Sweet Home named Paul D  finds Seth after years of walking, they begin a romantic relationship and  everything seems to be going the way things should. The ghost leaves, and  Paul D treats Seth right. Enter Beloved, a young woman they find half dead  next to their house. She speaks as though she has never had the strength to  use her voice. Time passes along and Beloved begins to become attatched to  Seth. As if she was looking for a mother figure in her life. This is a  threat to Paul D who feels he doesn't belong anymore. The rest of the film  unfolds bueatifully and the horrible secrets are uncovered to find the  truth. The acting is so superb and authentic, you feel as though the actors  actully embodied these characters from the page.  The directing is  magnificent. Jonathan Demme lets the story take its time, giving the  characters time to become familiar with the audiance.

81694,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0788815474,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[72, 81]","This story holds a deeper meaning. It is about something coming back to haunt us all. It is about sins that we commit that never really go away until we can learn to forgive ourselves and those who have offended us. It is about putting the pieces of the mirror of life together and looking deeply into it to see what is really in our souls.Supernatural evil forces surrounding us can scare us in movies, but what should really frighten us is how we have treated people throughout time. How we have enslaved people in many ways and have treated them as less than human. This story echoes these thoughts.This is a deeply moving film that must be given your full attention to understand the complexities. I was literally captivated: body, soul and spirit. I was glued to the couch, too scared to go anywhere. ;>The opening scenes are very violent and shocking. If you didn't read the reviews you would really be wondering if you wanted to keep watching the movie as I did. However, they cleverly showed you only enough to make you terribly curious. What throws a dog against the wall? That is why I was watching to find out what the heck had just happened. It is like a puzzle and you have to pick up a piece here and there. For the mind that analyzes everything...this is a dream movie.The story does not play out in a sequence of events as some stories do. It slips back into time, dragging out the horrific past and adding bits here and there to make you want to understand the entire story. I thought this was very cleverly done.The basic story running on the first level is about Sethe's life. She is a slave who escapes from a cruel Kentucky plantation called: ""Sweet Home."" Paul D was also a slave and yet he seems to have more inner strength even though he has seen it all. Sethe is obviously very troubled from her experiences and is determined not to let her children experience the horrors of slavery. She and her family are living on a plot outside of Cincinnati, Ohio eight years after the end of the Civil War.When slave hunters threaten to take her children back to the plantation, she kills one of her daughters.She continues to live with her second daughter Denver after her two sons run away. The murdered child then haunts their shack with a red glow until she actually returns in bodily form. Reality and the supernatural are blended together to make this the most creepy movie you will ever see because the creepiness is so subtle it takes you off guard.Oprah is incredible as an actress. Kimberley Elise (Denver) and Thandie Newton are incredible in their roles. I have never been so freaked out by anyone's facial expressions in my life. The things Thandie Newton can do with her face rival the best. Kimberley's eyes were at times almost ethereal. Danny Glover adds a much needed calm to the movie as he seems to be living in reality most of the time.Perhaps this movie did not do well because it is more for those who are very patient and caters to a smaller audience with eclectic tastes. This is not really for the mainstream audience. I thought the movie was quite long. Some movies are best viewed at home when they are of this length. The setting in which you view a movie is often very important to your enjoyment.Rare, vivid, provocative, authentic, intelligent, complex, artistic, scary, emotional, beautiful, sad, delirious, confusing, secretive and overall, great story telling.~The Rebecca Review",4,Home Haunted Home,1001635200,"09 28, 2001",2001,3429,"['story', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'something', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'sins', 'commit', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'away', 'can', 'learn', 'forgive', 'ourselves', 'who', 'have', 'offended', 'putting', 'pieces', 'mirror', 'life', 'together', 'looking', 'deeply', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'souls.Supernatural', 'evil', 'forces', 'surrounding', 'can', 'scare', 'movies', 'what', 'should', 'really', 'frighten', 'how', 'have', 'treated', 'people', 'time', 'How', 'have', 'enslaved', 'people', 'many', 'ways', 'have', 'treated', 'less', 'human', 'story', 'thoughts.This', 'deeply', 'moving', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'full', 'attention', 'understand', 'complexities', 'was', 'literally', 'captivated', 'body', 'soul', 'spirit', 'was', 'glued', 'couch', 'too', 'scared', 'go', 'anywhere', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'violent', 'shocking', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'wondering', 'wanted', 'keep', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', 'However', 'cleverly', 'showed', 'only', 'enough', 'make', 'terribly', 'curious', 'What', 'dog', 'wall', 'why', 'was', 'watching', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'puzzle', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'piece', 'here', 'there', 'mind', 'everything', 'dream', 'movie.The', 'story', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'sequence', 'events', 'stories', 'do', 'back', 'time', 'dragging', 'out', 'horrific', 'past', 'adding', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'make', 'want', 'understand', 'entire', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'cleverly', 'done.The', 'basic', 'story', 'running', 'first', 'level', 'Sethe', 'life', 'slave', 'who', 'cruel', 'Kentucky', 'plantation', 'called', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Paul', 'D', 'was', 'also', 'slave', 'yet', 'have', 'more', 'inner', 'strength', 'even', 'seen', 'Sethe', 'obviously', 'very', 'troubled', 'experiences', 'determined', 'not', 'let', 'children', 'experience', 'horrors', 'slavery', 'family', 'are', 'living', 'plot', 'Cincinnati', 'Ohio', 'eight', 'years', 'end', 'Civil', 'War.When', 'slave', 'hunters', 'threaten', 'take', 'children', 'back', 'plantation', 'one', 'daughters.She', 'live', 'second', 'daughter', 'Denver', 'two', 'sons', 'run', 'away', 'murdered', 'child', 'then', 'shack', 'red', 'glow', 'actually', 'bodily', 'form', 'Reality', 'supernatural', 'are', 'blended', 'together', 'make', 'most', 'creepy', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'creepiness', 'so', 'subtle', 'off', 'guard.Oprah', 'incredible', 'actress', 'Kimberley', 'Elise', 'Denver', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'are', 'incredible', 'roles', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'anyone', 'facial', 'expressions', 'life', 'things', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'can', 'do', 'face', 'rival', 'best', 'Kimberley', 'eyes', 'were', 'times', 'almost', 'ethereal', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'much', 'needed', 'calm', 'movie', 'be', 'living', 'reality', 'most', 'time.Perhaps', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'patient', 'caters', 'smaller', 'audience', 'eclectic', 'tastes', 'not', 'really', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'long', 'movies', 'are', 'best', 'viewed', 'home', 'when', 'are', 'length', 'setting', 'view', 'movie', 'often', 'very', 'important', 'enjoyment.Rare', 'vivid', 'provocative', 'authentic', 'intelligent', 'complex', 'artistic', 'scary', 'emotional', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'delirious', 'confusing', 'secretive', 'overall', 'great', 'story', 'telling.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Beloved

I also couldn't hear the script as recited in some scenes.  The sounded was muffled... maybe not well miked...who knows, so I feel I missed a something.Oddly,  the hard to understand plot was paired with  great acting that makes for a mixed bag of a film.  Maybe it is too painful for some viewers to use their imagination in understanding a movie if it can be interpreted on different levels.  Surreal for me, means interesting, and this film seemed original and intriguing.  The photography and staging of the time was also very good.  Though I feel that Beloved was overlong, with some of the scenes sort of redundant, I would rate it  higher than others have...and well worth a viewing.",3,Inconprehensible but powerful acting vignettes,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,797,"['start', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'Beloved', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'incomprehensible', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'script', 'recited', 'scenes', 'sounded', 'was', 'muffled', 'maybe', 'not', 'well', 'miked', 'who', 'feel', 'missed', 'something.Oddly', 'hard', 'understand', 'plot', 'was', 'paired', 'great', 'acting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'film', 'Maybe', 'too', 'painful', 'viewers', 'use', 'imagination', 'understanding', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'different', 'levels', 'Surreal', 'interesting', 'film', 'seemed', 'original', 'intriguing', 'photography', 'staging', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'feel', 'Beloved', 'was', 'overlong', 'scenes', 'sort', 'redundant', 'would', 'rate', 'higher', 'others', 'have', 'well', 'viewing']",Beloved
