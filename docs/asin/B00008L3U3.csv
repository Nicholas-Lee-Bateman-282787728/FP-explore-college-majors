They have a chemistry that burns the screen, yet a greenness that shows their stage in their careers.  Still, this film, a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film, is carried by the directing team of Jankel and Morton.  Without their stylistic approach, this would have been a forgettable mess, but they layer each scene with a physicality that makes sense and keeps us interested.  The story (of a man poisoned looking for his killer before he dies) is an intriguing one, and one that is pulled off with some serious style.  The film is a tad dated (it feels very 80's) but for the time, it worked.",4,Saved by some style...,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,721,"['D.O.A', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'when', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'were', 'becoming', 'stars', 'becoming', 'lovers', 'screen', 'have', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'greenness', 'stage', 'careers', 'Still', 'film', 'remake', '1949', ""O'Brien"", 'film', 'carried', 'directing', 'team', 'Jankel', 'Morton', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forgettable', 'mess', 'layer', 'scene', 'physicality', 'sense', 'interested', 'story', 'man', 'poisoned', 'looking', 'killer', 'intriguing', 'one', 'one', 'pulled', 'off', 'serious', 'style', 'film', 'tad', 'dated', 'very', '80', 'time', 'worked']",N/A

Not true, it was partly done in San Marcos, Texas, and there was a scene involving that cylindrical bricked building surrounded by a moat. That building is part of Texas State University (formerly Southwest Texas State University). I thought the makers could have filmed more of San Marcos, especially the river. Oh well, back to the film. It just sucked. Meg Ryan proved, again and again, that she can't act. The story was ridiculous. Dennis Quaid could have found a better film to work on. Daniel Stern's presence (or rather the absence) gave the film away for me, and I knew it was going to happen that way because that was probably the only plausible logic possible. Perhaps there was a power struggle between the two directors, resulting in a very chaotic film.

744578,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00008L3U3,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Spoilers may be lurking.  This remake of the 1950 original isn't up to the standard set by that film noir classic, but it does do it justice.  This film has the same central theme (hero mysteriously poisoned) but the setting and the circumstances are much different.Here Dennis Quaid plays Dexter Cornell, an English professor at the University of Texas (I think).  He's struggling to keep his marriage together, having been separated from Gail (Jane Kaczmarek).  It seems she has been unhappy for some time, primarily because Dexter ignores her.  The cause is apparently the fact that Dex abandon a once successful career as a novelist.  What Dex doesn't know is that Gail has been playing kissy face with Nick (Robert Knepper) one of Dexter's students.  Nick had been hounding Dex to read a novel he'd written and offer some advice.  As it turns out Nick is also the beneficiary of a scholarship provided by Mrs. Fitzwaring, a wealthy alum.  Nick was the son of a man who killed Mr. Fitzwaring.  Say what?In any case, Nick is killed falling from the building where Dex teaches.  Daniel Stern plays a good friend of Dex and Gail's, hoping to get a recommendation for tenure at the school.  Dex is drinking heavily and finds himself passed out in the dorm room of a freshman student named Sydney Fuller, played by Meg Ryan who was also Quaid's main squeeze, off camera, at the time.  With more than just a hangover, Dex is ill enough to check into a hospital only to find out that he had been poisoned somewhere along the line and that there is no cure.  He's given enough of a pick-me-up to keep him going but his prognosis is certain death in the next 24-48 hours.He goes to Gail but stumbles in on an intruder and is knocked out.  When he comes to, he finds her murdered and he is now the prime suspect given that the two dead people are now connected.  Eluding the police, Dex drags Sydney along in an effort to find out how he was poisoned and when.  The why and when is what keeps the mystery going.  Even with a few suspects, it is fairly easy to spot the who.The film's directors, Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton give the film a noirish modern day feel.  They even use a black and white opening (and closing) sequence similar to the 1950 original.  Dennis Quaid gives one of his best performances here as well.  While not as good as the original, the film has enough going for it to be recommended.The Blu ray transfer comes with 1080p resolution and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While this isn't a demo grade disc, it is certainly serviceable for a bargain basement purchase.  The film grain remains and is occasionally faulty.  There are a few dull shots and the film does suffer a bit from inconsistency.  Still not a big issue.  The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio 4.0 track with stereo up front and a mono surround track in the rear.  A bit unusual but it works fine.  Like the video it is nothing special but nothing terrible either.  There is a trailer and English subtitles only as far as extras.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for a fine noirish remake,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,3016,"['Spoilers', 'may', 'be', 'lurking', 'remake', '1950', 'original', ""n't"", 'up', 'standard', 'set', 'film', 'noir', 'classic', 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'same', 'central', 'theme', 'hero', 'mysteriously', 'poisoned', 'setting', 'circumstances', 'are', 'much', 'different.Here', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Dexter', 'Cornell', 'English', 'professor', 'University', 'Texas', 'think', 'struggling', 'keep', 'marriage', 'together', 'having', 'been', 'separated', 'Gail', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'been', 'unhappy', 'time', 'primarily', 'Dexter', 'cause', 'apparently', 'fact', 'Dex', 'abandon', 'once', 'successful', 'career', 'novelist', 'What', 'Dex', ""n't"", 'know', 'Gail', 'been', 'playing', 'kissy', 'face', 'Nick', 'Robert', 'Knepper', 'one', 'Dexter', 'students', 'Nick', 'had', 'been', 'hounding', 'Dex', 'read', 'novel', ""'d"", 'written', 'offer', 'advice', 'out', 'Nick', 'also', 'beneficiary', 'scholarship', 'provided', 'Mrs.', 'Fitzwaring', 'wealthy', 'alum', 'Nick', 'was', 'son', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Mr.', 'Fitzwaring', 'Say', 'what', 'case', 'Nick', 'killed', 'falling', 'building', 'where', 'Dex', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'good', 'friend', 'Dex', 'Gail', 'hoping', 'get', 'recommendation', 'tenure', 'school', 'Dex', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'passed', 'out', 'dorm', 'room', 'freshman', 'student', 'named', 'Sydney', 'Fuller', 'played', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Quaid', 'main', 'squeeze', 'off', 'camera', 'time', 'more', 'just', 'hangover', 'Dex', 'ill', 'enough', 'check', 'hospital', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'poisoned', 'somewhere', 'line', 'cure', 'given', 'enough', 'pick-me-up', 'keep', 'going', 'prognosis', 'certain', 'death', 'next', '24-48', 'hours.He', 'Gail', 'stumbles', 'intruder', 'knocked', 'out', 'When', 'murdered', 'now', 'prime', 'suspect', 'given', 'two', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'connected', 'Eluding', 'police', 'Dex', 'Sydney', 'effort', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'was', 'poisoned', 'when', 'why', 'when', 'what', 'mystery', 'going', 'Even', 'few', 'suspects', 'fairly', 'easy', 'spot', 'who.The', 'film', 'directors', 'Annabel', 'Jankel', 'Rocky', 'Morton', 'give', 'film', 'noirish', 'modern', 'day', 'feel', 'even', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'opening', 'closing', 'sequence', 'similar', '1950', 'original', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'film', 'enough', 'going', 'be', 'recommended.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', 'resolution', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', ""n't"", 'demo', 'grade', 'disc', 'certainly', 'serviceable', 'bargain', 'basement', 'purchase', 'film', 'grain', 'remains', 'occasionally', 'faulty', 'are', 'few', 'dull', 'shots', 'film', 'suffer', 'bit', 'inconsistency', 'Still', 'not', 'big', 'issue', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '4.0', 'track', 'stereo', 'up', 'front', 'mono', 'surround', 'track', 'rear', 'bit', 'unusual', 'fine', 'video', 'nothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'either', 'trailer', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'extras']",N/A

It goes for a Hitchcockian style of mystery but the directors are not nearly as skilled.  It does have a fairly fast pace to it which lifts it to a three star rating however.The always likable Dennis Quaid is Dexter Cornell, an English Professor and author who is generally a beaten down wretch of a man.  He's a borderline alcoholic, his wife is leaving him and one of his students apparently commits suicide by jumping from a window.  He drinks himself into a stupor and when he feels especially terrible he learns that somehow he had been poisoned and has only 24 hours(give or take) to live and find out who poisoned him.  He enlists the aid of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan).  Enlists isn't the right word.  He puts superglue on his hand and grabs her wrist, locking them together.  I guess the handcuffs of the original was a bit too mundane.I like Dennis Quaid but found his portrayal just to be way too melodramatic in this film, far moreso than Edmund O'Brien's in the original.  And Meg Ryan just comes off as ditzy and a little too old to be playing a college student.  I know she has that young, fresh face but she was 27 at the time of this film and it strained credibility.  Add to that this film has a very annoying musical score througout that seems wildy inappropriate for this type of film.Some good things are the style in which it was filmed.

744584,A2329GPAT2XIIZ,B00008L3U3,Ultimate Reviewer,"[1, 3]","Given that this is dated, watching it from a 2012 perspective, it starts out like a pretty intriguing film. However, what really lets it down, is the un-believeability of human reactions the characters display. It ruins it. For example, the main protagonist has been poisoned, and is dying, yet he's full of energy, fight, glib remarks and BS. Doesn't ring true. The girl - Meg Ryan - is kidnapped, glued to Quaid, dragged out in a nightdress, shot at with a nailgun, and her reaction is little more than a girl who has broken her nail. Doesn't ring true. Emotion in movies has come a long way since the 80s, but even then movies were done better. If you find the idea of a young Meg Ryan showing a bit of shoulder attractive, you may find something other than the plot to be interested in. I didn't find either worth the time.
