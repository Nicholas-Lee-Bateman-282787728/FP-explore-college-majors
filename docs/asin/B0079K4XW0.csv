It was tastefully done, viewable by a younger audience than many anime series and movies these days, yet intellectual enough for an adult viewer. There were character arcs that I would have like to have been resolved better at the end of the series, but this probably cannot be helped since this is an adaptation of the beginning of a large series of books. The way this series ends has closure but leaves room for more story to be told, and the books probably continue the story. I particularly wanted to know the mysterious origins of the character Guin, but this DVD set does not reveal this. I hope that one day they will continue this series so I can see what happens next, but since it has been a few years since this show has aired, that is not likely. Despite the loose ends left at the end, this series is worth watching and I highly recommend it.",4,Enjoyable fantasy.,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,973,"['one', 'better', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'much', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'viewable', 'younger', 'audience', 'many', 'anime', 'series', 'movies', 'days', 'yet', 'intellectual', 'enough', 'adult', 'viewer', 'were', 'character', 'arcs', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'better', 'end', 'series', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'adaptation', 'beginning', 'large', 'series', 'books', 'way', 'series', 'closure', 'room', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'books', 'probably', 'continue', 'story', 'particularly', 'wanted', 'know', 'mysterious', 'origins', 'character', 'Guin', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'reveal', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'continue', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'aired', 'not', 'likely', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'end', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

There they encounter a strange leopard-headed man named Guin. Guin saves them from Mongaul solders and then continues to travel with and protect them while he searches for his lost memories and the meaning of the only thing he does remember, the word ""Aurra.""I enjoyed this series. I couldn't really care about any of the characters (the twins are especially annoying), but the world was fascinating and the mysteries many. It was interesting just to see where the characters ended up next. The politics were also fun. The plotting, the scheming, the deception!Guin Saga is an epic fantasy story that spanned 130 light novels (short books, but it adds up). The series ran from 1979 to 2009, when the author died before finishing it. Needless to say, the anime doesn't have a complete ending. The immediate problem is solved, but you don't get to learn most of the secrets the series introduces you to (yup, no explanation about Guin).Despite its flaws, Guin Saga is a pretty fun series and it worth watching if you enjoy fantasy.",4,"Entertaining, but...",1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,1234,"['14', 'year', 'old', 'twins', 'Princess', 'Rinda', 'Prince', 'Remus', 'escape', 'home', 'city', 'when', 'attacked', 'Mongaul', 'using', 'strange', 'device', 'hidden', 'palace', 'Forest', 'Rood', 'encounter', 'strange', 'leopard-headed', 'man', 'named', 'Guin', 'Guin', 'Mongaul', 'solders', 'then', 'travel', 'protect', 'lost', 'memories', 'meaning', 'only', 'thing', 'remember', 'word', 'Aurra', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'twins', 'are', 'especially', 'annoying', 'world', 'was', 'fascinating', 'mysteries', 'many', 'was', 'interesting', 'just', 'see', 'where', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'next', 'politics', 'were', 'also', 'fun', 'plotting', 'scheming', 'deception', 'Guin', 'Saga', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'story', 'spanned', '130', 'light', 'novels', 'short', 'books', 'up', 'series', 'ran', '1979', '2009', 'when', 'author', 'died', 'finishing', 'Needless', 'say', 'anime', ""n't"", 'have', 'complete', 'ending', 'immediate', 'problem', 'solved', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'learn', 'most', 'secrets', 'series', 'yup', 'explanation', 'Guin', '.Despite', 'flaws', 'Guin', 'Saga', 'pretty', 'fun', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'fantasy']",N/A
1528632,A1B36M1BIX80G9,B0079K4XW0,Ryan,"[1, 1]","Hear me out! I, sir knight to declare war on land. Well, just kidding! Face it! Guin Saga novel-based TV anime is maybe the best from 2009 that draws you into the very, delightful medieval/fantasy epic you've never known. It all begin during the fall of Parros kingdom where the twin heirs (Rinda and Remus) escapes to Argos, but then accidently teleported to Roodwood where they're ambushed by a cluster of Mongaul soldiers before being saved by a strange leopard-headed warrior(Guin) who has no memory except for the word (Aurra) while confronting a world laden with intrigue, danger, and magic. From episodes 6 to 11, you'll see the tribes (Sem and Lagon). As for episodes 13 to 16, Guin and the two humans travel across the seas where they deal with a handful of pirates, and reached Argos in episode 19. Not only the show progresses through any episodes, but you'll also see the town of Crystal and the kindly and confidently white-skinned figure (Aldo Naris) who should've sensed that the two children are still alive anywhere. The war absolutely goes on until episode 25 when a strange blonde kid (Shito) lures the two people into a trap, but was then thrown off guard by Guin. The last episode is where Remus is crowned the king of Parros and Rinda has a vision about a future while Guin left on his own to find answers about his past while sparring with Istavan in the very end. I may perhaps recommend to anyone or a fan of medieval genre. You gotta give this a shot or forget it.

1528633,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B0079K4XW0,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[0, 1]","When Istavan - rogue, anti-hero and the only charismatic character in the show - appears in the last episode to talk to Guin, he says &#34;it's been awhile&#34; and by this point in the series, it had been awhile, but not for any reasons that make sense. Instead, the character was just shelved for approximately 15 episodes for reasons that seemed like good ideas at the time. Sadly, the &#34;vitality and passion&#34; that Guin is talking about only serves to remind the viewers that Istavan is a boring whiner by this point in the story.This scene highlight a major problem with the show which is the fact that for all the fun parts (especially in the first few episodes) it continually goes back to Guin - the leopard headed noble creature with the impossible strength and amazing superhero powers - and sadly, Guin is a boring scold. The only things that seems to interest the writers are the mystery of how he showed up as a leopard headed protector of royalty and never giving any concrete answers to the question. Instead, he's just a dull talking head who shows up and acts pompous. And unfortunately, he dominates the show.There are some interesting side stories including the one about the assassination plots around the royal wedding, but they fizzle out.Back to that Istavan scene - during the argument with Guin, he says &#34;I don't need your high and mighty sermons&#34; - sadly, I am in complete agreement with Istavan. I think the entire audience is in agreement with Istavan at this point. Sadly, the writers can't get enough of them.This seems like it could have been a great series. It had potential. Sadly, the fact that by the end of the series Istavan is STILL circling the drain with those prophecies of his future kingship and Guin is still giving sermons as he doesn't know who he is - pretty much emphasizes the problem with the show. When all is said and done, it's all about the Illusion of Change instead of about storytelling or character development.One note - not to be an elitist, but if you watch this show in the original Japanese, it will rate a third star. It still has all the same problems but the Japanese actors are much more dramatic and better at their jobs. The American actors sound like a bunch of amateurs who were chosen because they happened to be in town that day. Most of them sound like Midwestern high school students putting on a production of Our Town. In fact, it's much easier to ignore just how pompous and draining Guin is as a character with the Japanese actor.",2,Runs out of steam halfway through,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2523,"['When', 'Istavan', 'rogue', 'anti-hero', 'only', 'charismatic', 'character', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'talk', 'Guin', '34', 'been', 'awhile', '34', 'point', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'awhile', 'not', 'reasons', 'make', 'sense', 'Instead', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'shelved', 'approximately', '15', 'episodes', 'reasons', 'seemed', 'good', 'ideas', 'time', 'Sadly', '34', 'vitality', 'passion', '34', 'Guin', 'talking', 'only', 'remind', 'viewers', 'Istavan', 'boring', 'whiner', 'point', 'story.This', 'scene', 'highlight', 'major', 'problem', 'show', 'fact', 'fun', 'parts', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'continually', 'back', 'Guin', 'leopard', 'headed', 'noble', 'creature', 'impossible', 'strength', 'amazing', 'superhero', 'powers', 'sadly', 'Guin', 'boring', 'scold', 'only', 'things', 'interest', 'writers', 'are', 'mystery', 'how', 'showed', 'up', 'leopard', 'headed', 'protector', 'royalty', 'never', 'giving', 'concrete', 'answers', 'question', 'Instead', 'just', 'dull', 'talking', 'head', 'who', 'up', 'pompous', 'unfortunately', 'show.There', 'are', 'interesting', 'side', 'stories', 'including', 'one', 'assassination', 'plots', 'royal', 'wedding', 'fizzle', 'out.Back', 'Istavan', 'scene', 'argument', 'Guin', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'high', 'mighty', 'sermons', '34', 'sadly', 'am', 'complete', 'agreement', 'Istavan', 'think', 'entire', 'audience', 'agreement', 'Istavan', 'point', 'Sadly', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'them.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'series', 'had', 'potential', 'Sadly', 'fact', 'end', 'series', 'Istavan', 'STILL', 'circling', 'drain', 'prophecies', 'future', 'kingship', 'Guin', 'still', 'giving', 'sermons', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'problem', 'show', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Illusion', 'Change', 'instead', 'storytelling', 'character', 'development.One', 'note', 'not', 'be', 'elitist', 'watch', 'show', 'original', 'Japanese', 'will', 'rate', 'third', 'star', 'still', 'same', 'problems', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'better', 'jobs', 'American', 'actors', 'sound', 'bunch', 'amateurs', 'who', 'were', 'chosen', 'happened', 'be', 'town', 'day', 'Most', 'sound', 'Midwestern', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'putting', 'production', 'Town', 'fact', 'much', 'easier', 'ignore', 'just', 'how', 'pompous', 'draining', 'Guin', 'character', 'Japanese', 'actor']",N/A
