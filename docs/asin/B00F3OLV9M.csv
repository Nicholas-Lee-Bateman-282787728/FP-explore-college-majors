George (Gary Dourdan) and Claudia (Rocsi) are her foster siblings who still live in the same upscale neighborhood. Catherine does horrible things in her sleep that no one can control and everyone covers up.The acting was hit and miss. The supporting cast was downright bad. The script has holes in it.
