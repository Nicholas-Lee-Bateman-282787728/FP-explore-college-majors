Okay, it is bishoujo cute, but in a completely enjoyable, witty way.This DVD has great replay value and will make you laugh and smile every time you watch it.  The characters are wonderful, the music is precious, the animation is bright and playful, and the dubbing is excellent.  I consider the dubbing almost or as good as that of 'Cowboy Bebop,' and I've seen episodes from both series multiple times, so I don't make this comparison lightly.This is one of my favorite series, no question, and I'd encourage any anime fan to check it out.  It takes bishoujo conventions and alters the standard recipe with a dash of this and a pinch of that, and the overall effect is whimsical and thoroughly endearing.Others have described the plot and characters, so I won't repeat what others have said.

Here is what it says on the back:Toru Honda is a cheerful 16 year old girl. She was orphaned when her mother was killed in a car accident. Not wanting to burden anyone, she buys a tent and begins to live in a forest. She is determined to finish school in order to fulfill her mother's last wish. It turns out that the land Toru is living on belongs to the Soma family. She is quickly invited to live in the Soma house (all males), as long as she is willing to cook and clean. One of the Soma's, Yuki, is the most popular boy at Toru's high school. He is swooned by girls constantly and is even referred to as the ""prince"" of the school. His cousins Shigure, Yuki's guardian, and Kyo make up the rest of the household. Toru knows that her living environment is out of the norm, but things turn out to get stranger. The members of the Soma family are possessed by animals and they turn into their true selves when they are embraced by the opposite sex! You can imagine Toru's surprise when she witnesses their secret. She promises not to tell a soul, but the ""cat"" may already be out of the bag.Of course what is the main attraction to dvds compared to vhs are the Special bonuses like:- Character Profiles- Clean Opening and Closing Animation- Trailers- Behind the Scenes FeaturetteThis dvd is the first volume of Fruits Basket containing episodes 1-6 (there are a total of 26 episodes).  I especially loved episode 6 because it was just hilarious!  For more information about this series you can find it at their official English site @ fruits-basket.comToru really is a sweetie, she cares and loves everyone for who they are and not for 'what' they are.

723122,A13RNON4R3QZGF,B00006SFK7,aspen_matthews,"[8, 10]","First of all, let me start off by saying that this dvd blew me away.  I had never heard of the series and kept picking up the box every time I went to my local movie retailer.  After Christmas, I decided to get it.  I was expecting some lame rip off of Ranma 1/2, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.The story is based around the cute and honorable Tohru Honda. A few years before our story starts, her mother dies an early death.  Tohru already had no father, so she was left parentless.  She ends up living with her inviting and loving grandfather.  At the beginning of our story, she happens to walk past the house of the Sohma family (by the way, while her grandfather is doing repairs on the house, she is living alone in a tent in the woods!!).  She meets Shigure, who is painting chinese zodiac characters.  She then finds out ""Prince Yuki"", the cutest and most mysterious guy at school, lives there as well.  They end up becoming friends, and they invite her to live there while her grandfather's renovations are going on.That's where the story really begins.  Tohru finds out, quite by accident, that the Sohma family is cursed!  Every time one of them is embraced by a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their chinese zodiac animal!  Shigure is the dog, Yuki is the rat, and their relative Kyo is the cat?  I won't spoil everything, you'll have to watch it to find out what else happens.  The story focuses a lot on character relationships with plenty of comedy to keep it from getting too serious.On a technical side, the animation for this anime is absolutely superb.  The colors are great, the drawings and character designs are fantastic, and they all flow together quite nicely.  Plus, there are great extras, like character profiles, plus the dvd has 6 episodes.  It's well worth the $... extra for this awesome story.  I recommend this for fans of Ranma 1/2, His and Her Circumstances, and Love Hina.",5,There is room for a rice ball in a fruits basket!!,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,1933,"['First', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'dvd', 'blew', 'away', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'kept', 'picking', 'up', 'box', 'time', 'went', 'local', 'movie', 'retailer', 'Christmas', 'decided', 'get', 'was', 'expecting', 'lame', 'rip', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'truth.The', 'story', 'based', 'cute', 'honorable', 'Tohru', 'Honda', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'story', 'mother', 'early', 'death', 'Tohru', 'already', 'had', 'father', 'was', 'left', 'parentless', 'up', 'living', 'inviting', 'loving', 'grandfather', 'beginning', 'story', 'walk', 'house', 'Sohma', 'family', 'way', 'grandfather', 'doing', 'repairs', 'house', 'living', 'alone', 'tent', 'woods', 'Shigure', 'who', 'painting', 'chinese', 'zodiac', 'characters', 'then', 'out', 'Prince', 'Yuki', 'cutest', 'most', 'mysterious', 'guy', 'school', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'friends', 'invite', 'live', 'there', 'grandfather', 'renovations', 'are', 'going', 'on.That', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'Tohru', 'out', 'quite', 'accident', 'Sohma', 'family', 'cursed', 'time', 'one', 'embraced', 'member', 'opposite', 'sex', 'turn', 'chinese', 'zodiac', 'animal', 'Shigure', 'dog', 'Yuki', 'rat', 'relative', 'Kyo', 'cat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'everything', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'else', 'story', 'lot', 'character', 'relationships', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'keep', 'getting', 'too', 'serious.On', 'technical', 'side', 'animation', 'anime', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'colors', 'are', 'great', 'drawings', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'fantastic', 'flow', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'are', 'great', 'extras', 'character', 'profiles', 'dvd', '6', 'episodes', 'well', 'extra', 'awesome', 'story', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Her', 'Circumstances', 'Love', 'Hina']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?
723123,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00006SFK7,Carl Cheng,"[10, 11]","With so much anime coming out in Japan, it's hard to really be able to watch them all or even a large fraction of them.  Then you also take into consideration the fact that another fraction is taken to come to America.  From all this, a gem comes along and that's exactly what Fruits Basket is.  Fruits Basket is definitely one anime that people should see.Fruits Basket, spanning 26 episodes, is the story of a high school girl, Tohru Honda, who lives by herself in a tent outside now that her mother had passed away in an accident and her grandfather was staying with other relatives.  Tohru is an extremely sincere, naive, compassionate person.  How anyone could portray such depth to these feelings in one person is beyond me.  She gets these from her mother who she loved deeply.  She stayed true to her words and morals and to help others and be herself.  The last thing she ever wanted to be was a burden on others and that is why she doesn't tell her friends about her living situation.  Her whole life changed after being able to stay with the ""Prince"" Yuki Souma and relative, Shigure.  The twist is that the Souma family has the curse of the Juunishi, The Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac.  When hugged by the opposite sex, they will change into their respective animal counterpart.  The Soumas all have problems in their lives that all come down to their curse.  Yet, Tohru has this amazing ability to help all of them with their problems.  It's very heartwearming and definitely a tear-jerker.I must say that it is a little weird that Funimation has picked up this title.  For those who don't know, Funimation specializes in releasing more action-oriented titles like Dragon Ball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, and later on, One Piece.  Picking up a more emotional title was a total surprise.  The problem I have with this DVD is that the packaging does not look pleasing at all.  The logo for Fruits Basket seems too ordinary and does nothing for the cover.  The picture of Tohru just doesn't seem right for a cover art.  I think it would have been better to showcase more cast of characters with at least a contrasting background of trees or something else.This anime is relatively new so the visual quality should be nice.  The theme songs are very nice.  Both the opening and ending fit the story very well.  It relates to the characters and the story and is very mellow and soft which fits with the emotional aspects.Another problem I have with this release is the fact the price goes for a retail of 40 dollars.  It's good that they released 6 episodes on this DVD but 40 dollars is just too much.  Many other companies have released 5-7 episodes with just the normal retail price of 30 dollars.  I guess I could understand if there were extras added with the DVD but I don't think there is.Final Note:  Even through the higher price, this is a show that is really amazing.  If you love emotional and light-hearted anime, then this is for you.  If you just like action or any others, then give it a try.  It really wouldn't hurt.  You might find yourself falling in love with it too.  Words just really can't express the way I feel about this anime and I don't want to spoil anything but in ways, it really is like ""Chicken Soup for your Soul.""",5,One of the Best I've Seen in a While.,1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,3254,"['so', 'much', 'anime', 'coming', 'out', 'Japan', 'hard', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'even', 'large', 'fraction', 'Then', 'also', 'take', 'consideration', 'fact', 'fraction', 'taken', 'come', 'America', 'gem', 'along', 'exactly', 'what', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'definitely', 'one', 'anime', 'people', 'should', 'see.Fruits', 'Basket', 'spanning', '26', 'episodes', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Tohru', 'Honda', 'who', 'tent', 'outside', 'now', 'mother', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'accident', 'grandfather', 'was', 'staying', 'other', 'relatives', 'Tohru', 'extremely', 'sincere', 'naive', 'compassionate', 'person', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'portray', 'such', 'depth', 'feelings', 'one', 'person', 'mother', 'who', 'loved', 'deeply', 'stayed', 'true', 'words', 'morals', 'help', 'others', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'ever', 'wanted', 'be', 'was', 'burden', 'others', 'why', ""n't"", 'tell', 'friends', 'living', 'situation', 'whole', 'life', 'changed', 'being', 'able', 'stay', 'Prince', 'Yuki', 'Souma', 'relative', 'Shigure', 'twist', 'Souma', 'family', 'curse', 'Juunishi', 'Twelve', 'Animals', 'Chinese', 'Zodiac', 'When', 'hugged', 'opposite', 'sex', 'will', 'change', 'respective', 'animal', 'counterpart', 'Soumas', 'have', 'problems', 'lives', 'come', 'curse', 'Tohru', 'amazing', 'ability', 'help', 'problems', 'very', 'heartwearming', 'definitely', 'tear-jerker.I', 'must', 'say', 'little', 'weird', 'Funimation', 'picked', 'up', 'title', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Funimation', 'releasing', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'titles', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'later', 'One', 'Piece', 'Picking', 'up', 'more', 'emotional', 'title', 'was', 'total', 'surprise', 'problem', 'have', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'not', 'look', 'pleasing', 'logo', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'too', 'ordinary', 'nothing', 'cover', 'picture', 'Tohru', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'cover', 'art', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'showcase', 'more', 'cast', 'characters', 'least', 'contrasting', 'background', 'trees', 'something', 'else.This', 'anime', 'relatively', 'new', 'visual', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'nice', 'theme', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'opening', 'ending', 'fit', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'characters', 'story', 'very', 'mellow', 'soft', 'emotional', 'aspects.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'release', 'fact', 'price', 'retail', '40', 'dollars', 'good', 'released', '6', 'episodes', 'DVD', '40', 'dollars', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Many', 'other', 'companies', 'have', 'released', '5-7', 'episodes', 'just', 'normal', 'retail', 'price', '30', 'dollars', 'guess', 'could', 'understand', 'were', 'extras', 'added', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'is.Final', 'Note', 'Even', 'higher', 'price', 'show', 'really', 'amazing', 'love', 'emotional', 'light-hearted', 'anime', 'then', 'just', 'action', 'others', 'then', 'give', 'try', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'might', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'too', 'Words', 'just', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'way', 'feel', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'ways', 'really', 'Chicken', 'Soup', 'Soul']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?

And since it was lisenced, it was very hard for me to find the fansubs of it :-(  I first heard about Fruits Basket on an anime website (the name has since slipped my mind) that listed and described anime that are new in Japan.  I loved the sound of it, and really wanted to download it, but it was hard to find a place to do that because it was already lisenced.  Anyway, a month or so goes by when i finally get kazaa on my computer and get some of the eps that i wanted to badly.  And all i have to say is WOW!I loved it so much!  It is one of the best anime I have seen in a while.  I am still downloading the eps (only on 16, i have a 56k) but i am really enjoying it, and even though it is on my comp, i do plan on buying it on DVD (especially becsue there are 6 eps on one DVD! what a great price for it too!)Anyway, Fruits basket is the story of Tohru Honda, her mother was killed in a car crash a little under a year ago and she resides with her family.  But since there are renovations being done at the house, she has to find somewhere else to go.  Not wanting to be a burden on any of her friends, she ends up living in a tent in the woods.  Little does she know though, that the woods belong to the Souma family, a cursed family, and Yuki Souma is one of the most popular boys in school.  So she stumbles upon the house of Yuki and Shigure Souma, and too make a long story short, she ends up living with them in exchange for doing housework.But the Souma's have the curse of the Juunishi.  Whenever they are hugged by the opposite sex, they turn into their chinese zodiac counterpart.  This makes for a hilarous and touching shojou anime.The one down side is the animation, not my favorite style, but I like the anime so much that it doesn't bother me (the eyes are too big and i thought Yuki was a girl)",5,A wonderful anime!,1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,1994,"['was', 'quite', 'delighted', 'see', 'fruits', 'basket', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'especially', 'funi', 'funimation', 'pioneer', 'have', 'had', 'rights', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'lisenced', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'fansubs', 'first', 'heard', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'anime', 'website', 'name', 'slipped', 'mind', 'listed', 'described', 'anime', 'are', 'new', 'Japan', 'loved', 'sound', 'really', 'wanted', 'download', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'place', 'do', 'was', 'already', 'lisenced', 'Anyway', 'month', 'so', 'when', 'i', 'finally', 'get', 'kazaa', 'computer', 'get', 'eps', 'i', 'wanted', 'badly', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'WOW', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'am', 'still', 'downloading', 'eps', 'only', '16', 'i', 'have', '56k', 'i', 'am', 'really', 'enjoying', 'even', 'comp', 'i', 'do', 'plan', 'buying', 'DVD', 'especially', 'becsue', 'are', '6', 'eps', 'one', 'DVD', 'what', 'great', 'price', 'too', 'Anyway', 'Fruits', 'basket', 'story', 'Tohru', 'Honda', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'little', 'year', 'ago', 'family', 'are', 'renovations', 'being', 'done', 'house', 'find', 'somewhere', 'else', 'go', 'Not', 'wanting', 'be', 'burden', 'friends', 'up', 'living', 'tent', 'woods', 'Little', 'know', 'woods', 'belong', 'Souma', 'family', 'cursed', 'family', 'Yuki', 'Souma', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'boys', 'school', 'house', 'Yuki', 'Shigure', 'Souma', 'too', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'up', 'living', 'exchange', 'doing', 'Souma', 'have', 'curse', 'Juunishi', 'Whenever', 'are', 'hugged', 'opposite', 'sex', 'turn', 'chinese', 'zodiac', 'counterpart', 'hilarous', 'touching', 'shojou', 'one', 'down', 'side', 'animation', 'not', 'favorite', 'style', 'like', 'anime', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'bother', 'eyes', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'i', 'thought', 'Yuki', 'was', 'girl']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?
723125,A22XHZ3MFP6MSV,B00006SFK7,Cranky Reviewer,"[11, 11]","This series is a sweet, tender, introspective story.  While each episode can probably be watched individually, they all build gradually toward the dark and suspenseful ending.  I have laughed and cried watching Fruits Basket, watched the entire series through about six times, and still enjoy it.  There is not a lot of action, but there's lots of verbal comedy and plot development.This particular video serves as an introduction to the characters.  Tohru Honda is a girl orphaned recently by the death of her mother.  She is also temporarily homeless, as her grandfather's house is being renovated.  After attempting to live in a tent, so as not to be a burden to anyone, she is taken in by the Sohma family as a live-in housekeeper.  Soon she discovers the Sohma family curse. (They transform into animals when stressed-out or hugged)  Gradually, over the first four episodes, she gets to know the denizens of Shigure's house, the popular, reserved Yuki, the hostile extrovert Kyo, and the relentless tease (but the closest thing to a responsible adult) Shigure.  Tohru herself, not the brightest bulb in the drawer, but hardworking, kind, and always striving to understand people, soon endears herself to the Sohmas, and begins to help them heal from the emotional wounds their curse--and their somewhat nasty family--have inflicted.  In the fifth episode, when Tohru is able to move out, they all finally realize what they have begin to mean to one another.  (First tear-jerker episode, but hardly the last.) In Episode 6, Tohru brings her friends to meet the Sohmas, resulting in a rather slapstick episode of accidental transformation and coverup.The series only goes on to get better after this: it doesn't fall into any predictable pattern of slapstick or compete-for-the-girl romance.",5,Deeper than it looks at first glance,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,1794,"['series', 'sweet', 'tender', 'introspective', 'story', 'episode', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'watched', 'individually', 'build', 'gradually', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'ending', 'have', 'laughed', 'cried', 'watching', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'six', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'lots', 'verbal', 'comedy', 'plot', 'development.This', 'particular', 'video', 'serves', 'introduction', 'characters', 'Tohru', 'Honda', 'girl', 'orphaned', 'recently', 'death', 'mother', 'also', 'temporarily', 'homeless', 'grandfather', 'house', 'being', 'renovated', 'attempting', 'live', 'tent', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'burden', 'anyone', 'taken', 'Sohma', 'family', 'live-in', 'housekeeper', 'Soon', 'Sohma', 'family', 'curse', 'transform', 'animals', 'when', 'stressed-out', 'hugged', 'Gradually', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'know', 'denizens', 'Shigure', 'house', 'popular', 'reserved', 'Yuki', 'hostile', 'extrovert', 'Kyo', 'relentless', 'tease', 'closest', 'thing', 'responsible', 'adult', 'Shigure', 'Tohru', 'not', 'brightest', 'bulb', 'drawer', 'hardworking', 'kind', 'always', 'striving', 'understand', 'people', 'soon', 'Sohmas', 'help', 'heal', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'curse', 'somewhat', 'nasty', 'family', 'have', 'inflicted', 'fifth', 'episode', 'when', 'Tohru', 'able', 'move', 'out', 'finally', 'realize', 'what', 'have', 'begin', 'mean', 'one', 'First', 'tear-jerker', 'episode', 'hardly', 'last', 'Episode', '6', 'Tohru', 'friends', 'meet', 'Sohmas', 'resulting', 'rather', 'slapstick', 'episode', 'accidental', 'transformation', 'coverup.The', 'series', 'only', 'get', 'better', ""n't"", 'fall', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'slapstick', 'compete-for-the-girl', 'romance']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?
723126,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00006SFK7,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 4]","Tohru Honda is a cute, bubbly orphaned high school sophomore who lost her mother in May, and is secretly living in a tent in the woods.  She pays for her own tuition via her janitorial job.  She's got it rough, but she feels blessed to have two friends, tough talking blonde Arisa Uotani and the goth-like Saki Hanajima, with a soft but low menacing voice who threatens to zap anyone bullying Tohru with harmful vibes.  But as she says, ""one of my virtues is that no matter the times, I will not be discouraged.""Meet the Sohmas.  Tohru does and discovers to her amazement that they are a family cursed with the spirits of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.  Whenever their bodies weaken or they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their totem animal.  Shigure turns into a dog, Yuki into a rat, and Kyo into a cat.  She then becomes greater friends with Yuki, the handsome and androgynous popular ""prince"" of Tohru's high school.  In exchange for keeping their secret, Tohru gets free rent and cooks and cleans for them. The Sohmas become like a new family to her, as she finds somewhere she belongs, bringing to mind the game Fruits Basket, where each child was given the name of a fruit, and when their name was called, they'd join in the center.  Tohru was given the name ""onigiri"" or riceball, as a cruel joke, and hence she was excluded.According to legend, the zodiac animals were invited to a banquet by god, but the mischievous rat told the cat the banquet was the day after.  The cat missed the banquet and was thus excluded from the zodiac.  Thus the cat and rat are at odds against each other, and a large piece of the story involves the short-tempered and embittered Kyo threatening to physically beat Yuki, to become a formal member of the zodiac, but alas, Yuki amazingly kicks Kyo's a** repeatedly, as well as bickering.  As an injoke, Saki and Arisa says the pair's arguing reminds them of that cartoon, ""something and Jerry.""Kyo, though, feels he isn't cut out for socializing, but Shigure tells him that ""unless you interact with people, hurting them and being hurt by them as you learn about them as well as yourself, you'll never be the kind of person who can be concerned about others.""  But Tohru, who wept as a child upon hearing the cat's fate, is someone who loves the cat and despite Kyo's temper, some of it aimed at her, realizes that Kyo is someone ""who is a little more awkward than others, but a good person deep down, a gentle person who knows when he feels sorry.""Both Yuki and Kyo are socially awkward with people, and popular.  Whereas Yuki feels inferior because of his shyness, Kyo doesn't react well to people he doesn't know, but once they get to know him, he tends to attract people like a magnet.  Yuki says that he's nice because he wants to be liked by others, but that makes him hypocritical.But Tohru recalls her mother saying how people weren't born with kindness, and that it's easier to doubt than to believe and better to do the latter.  ""Kindness is something that develops just as our bodies do, and the heart that grows inside is our conscience.  ...Tohru, become a girl who believes in others.  That will surely lend strength to someone.""  And she does, to both Yuki and Kyo.Voicing Tohru has given Yui Horie her most lovable role ever.  Other veterans include Tomokazu Seki (Kyo), who's done work for Chobits (as Shimbo) and more recently, as cosplay costume designer Tanaka in Genshiken.  Pop singer Aya Hisakawa (Yuki) also voiced PE teacher Kurosawa in Azumanga Daioh and Sailor Mercury in Sailor Moon.I was soooooooo enchanted, mainly because of Tohru, who is that rare of people, a romantic, a cooperator, ""someone who understands other people's feelings,"" and someone who wants to be friends with everyone and charms everyone she meets with her personality.  When at first it looks as if her memory might be erased to keep the Sohmas' secret, she fully understands and cheerily asks Yuki, who feels stunned and guilty, ""When my memory is erased, please be my friend again, okay?""  The revelation of her mother's death kind of stirred something in me, as my own mother also died in May.  Small wonder she is my second favourite anime character, after Aoi Sakuraba (Ai Yori Aoshi), and FB my third favourite anime series.",5,An anime that'll leave you warm and fuzzy inside,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,4309,"['Tohru', 'Honda', 'cute', 'bubbly', 'orphaned', 'high', 'school', 'sophomore', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'May', 'secretly', 'living', 'tent', 'woods', 'own', 'tuition', 'janitorial', 'job', 'got', 'rough', 'blessed', 'have', 'two', 'friends', 'tough', 'talking', 'blonde', 'Arisa', 'Uotani', 'goth-like', 'Saki', 'Hanajima', 'soft', 'low', 'menacing', 'voice', 'who', 'zap', 'anyone', 'bullying', 'Tohru', 'harmful', 'vibes', 'one', 'virtues', 'matter', 'times', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'discouraged', 'Meet', 'Sohmas', 'Tohru', 'discovers', 'amazement', 'are', 'family', 'cursed', 'spirits', 'twelve', 'animals', 'Chinese', 'zodiac', 'Whenever', 'bodies', 'weaken', 'are', 'hugged', 'member', 'opposite', 'sex', 'turn', 'totem', 'animal', 'Shigure', 'dog', 'Yuki', 'rat', 'Kyo', 'cat', 'then', 'greater', 'friends', 'Yuki', 'handsome', 'androgynous', 'popular', 'prince', 'Tohru', 'high', 'school', 'exchange', 'keeping', 'secret', 'Tohru', 'free', 'rent', 'cooks', 'cleans', 'Sohmas', 'become', 'new', 'family', 'somewhere', 'bringing', 'mind', 'game', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'where', 'child', 'was', 'given', 'name', 'fruit', 'when', 'name', 'was', 'called', ""'d"", 'join', 'center', 'Tohru', 'was', 'given', 'name', 'onigiri', 'riceball', 'cruel', 'joke', 'hence', 'was', 'excluded.According', 'legend', 'zodiac', 'animals', 'were', 'invited', 'banquet', 'god', 'mischievous', 'rat', 'told', 'cat', 'banquet', 'was', 'day', 'cat', 'missed', 'banquet', 'was', 'thus', 'excluded', 'zodiac', 'Thus', 'cat', 'rat', 'are', 'odds', 'other', 'large', 'piece', 'story', 'short-tempered', 'embittered', 'Kyo', 'threatening', 'physically', 'beat', 'Yuki', 'become', 'formal', 'member', 'zodiac', 'alas', 'Yuki', 'amazingly', 'Kyo', 'a**', 'repeatedly', 'as', 'well', 'bickering', 'injoke', 'Saki', 'Arisa', 'pair', 'arguing', 'cartoon', 'something', 'Jerry', 'Kyo', 'though', 'feels', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'socializing', 'Shigure', 'interact', 'people', 'hurting', 'being', 'hurt', 'learn', 'about', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'concerned', 'others', 'Tohru', 'who', 'wept', 'child', 'hearing', 'cat', 'fate', 'someone', 'who', 'cat', 'Kyo', 'temper', 'aimed', 'Kyo', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'awkward', 'others', 'good', 'person', 'deep', 'down', 'gentle', 'person', 'who', 'when', 'sorry', 'Yuki', 'Kyo', 'are', 'socially', 'awkward', 'people', 'popular', 'Whereas', 'Yuki', 'feels', 'inferior', 'shyness', 'Kyo', ""n't"", 'react', 'well', 'people', ""n't"", 'know', 'once', 'get', 'know', 'attract', 'people', 'magnet', 'Yuki', 'nice', 'be', 'liked', 'others', 'hypocritical.But', 'Tohru', 'mother', 'saying', 'how', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'born', 'kindness', 'easier', 'doubt', 'believe', 'better', 'do', 'latter', 'Kindness', 'something', 'just', 'bodies', 'do', 'heart', 'inside', 'conscience', 'Tohru', 'become', 'girl', 'who', 'others', 'will', 'surely', 'lend', 'strength', 'someone', 'Yuki', 'Kyo.Voicing', 'Tohru', 'given', 'Yui', 'Horie', 'most', 'lovable', 'role', 'ever', 'Other', 'veterans', 'include', 'Tomokazu', 'Seki', 'Kyo', 'who', 'done', 'work', 'Chobits', 'Shimbo', 'more', 'recently', 'cosplay', 'costume', 'designer', 'Tanaka', 'Genshiken', 'Pop', 'singer', 'Aya', 'Hisakawa', 'Yuki', 'also', 'voiced', 'PE', 'teacher', 'Kurosawa', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'Sailor', 'Mercury', 'Sailor', 'Moon.I', 'was', 'soooooooo', 'enchanted', 'mainly', 'Tohru', 'who', 'rare', 'people', 'romantic', 'cooperator', 'someone', 'who', 'other', 'people', 'feelings', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'friends', 'everyone', 'charms', 'everyone', 'personality', 'When', 'first', 'memory', 'might', 'be', 'erased', 'keep', 'Sohmas', 'secret', 'fully', 'cheerily', 'Yuki', 'who', 'stunned', 'guilty', 'When', 'memory', 'erased', 'please', 'be', 'friend', 'again', 'revelation', 'mother', 'death', 'kind', 'stirred', 'something', 'own', 'mother', 'also', 'died', 'May', 'Small', 'wonder', 'second', 'favourite', 'anime', 'character', 'Aoi', 'Sakuraba', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'FB', 'third', 'favourite', 'anime', 'series']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?
723127,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00006SFK7,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.That's the odd situation in the first volume of ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And this anime adapes the material very nicely -- quirky characters, slapsticky action, and a lovably sunshiney heroine who helps her cursed friends, despite her own unhappy past.As the story opens, Tohru Honda is living in the woods in a cheap tent, with only her late mother's photo for company. One day she wanders down to a large house nearby, and encounters the flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper.But Yuki and Shigure are keeping a secret from her. When martial-artist Kyo bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three men end up turning into a dog, a cat, and a rat. Their family is cursed with the thirteen spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and they turn into those animals whenever a member of the opposite sex hugs them.Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays. And soon she starts encountering new problems -- the intermittently crazed Kagura (the boar) invades the house, Yuki and Kyo trash the house, and Tohru's pals Hana and Uo come for a sleepover. But when Tohru's grandfather calls her back to his house, will the Sohmas lose their new friend?The first volume of the ""Fruits Basket"" anime is somewhat weak compared to what comes after it -- the first three episodes are devoted almost exclusively to introducing the main four characters, and setting up the whole idea of the zodiac curse. It just takes the story awhile to get going.And when it does get going, it's genuinely charming -- there's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (Kagura twirling Kyo's body like a lasso), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Since when do we have a rice cooker?"" ""I found it in the trash!""). But there's also a melancholy side to the story, such as Tohru's tragic past and the Sohmas' inability to interact normally with other people.Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the shy, strong ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").It's graced with some solid animation, and an excellent English dub. I should explain that in this case, the Japanese dub isn't quite as good: while most of the voice actors in either language are great, the Japanese ""Yuki"" voice is... a girl. I don't know why they did that, but they did. The English voice actor is definitely better for the role -- smooth, deep and gentle.The first volume of ""Fruits Basket"" starts slowly, but once the storyline gets its footings, it's a quirky, sweet-natured little comedy with lots of lovable characters.

723128,A1YMS2TL8GHA4R,B00006SFK7,Fisket,"[3, 3]","I heard of this series a whlie ago, but put off and put off seeing it, until I read a few reviews and thought I'd give it a go.Now, I only shake my head at myself for not getting it sooner.There are other reviews here with excellent plot summaries, so I won't go into that here.  I'll just try to explain why I think this series is so well worth seeing.The greatest strength of this anime is its ability to put such a variety of emotions into each episode.  On this volume, episode 5 in particular had me both laughing and crying- and at one point, a strange mixture of both.I think that's the overriding appeal of this series- it's fun, it's lighthearted, it's almost ridiculously hilarious in places, but it also has moments that touch you, and make you appreciate how good it feels to belong somewhere.  For that is one of, if not the, main themes- Tohru is a girl fundamentally alone, who discovers a place, and a family, who are willing to take her in and give her a place where she belongs, and without the need to change her own identity and sense of self.  At the same time, the Souma's, whom she stays with, feel that they aren't what a family should be, and while this is kind of true (it's not really 'normal' for a family to be cursed so that they turn into animals, is it? ^_^), Tohru helps them to see that a family is what you make it, it's how you treat and feel about the people you're close to.Okay, now it's sounding sappy, but these ideas are conveyed in 'Fruits Basket' without once feeling obvious or preachy.  It's more like, 'This is how life is, so let's get on with it and enjoy ourselves!'  This anime has a lot of conviction in its characters and in its simple, though valuable, ideals.I can't watch this anime without smiling and feeling good about life.  And isn't that what good anime is about?  I just keep re-watching all the episodes, too, and I still keep bursting out laughing every time.

723129,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,B00006SFK7,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[2, 2]","I picked up the first DVD of this series before reading the manga, and it blew me away. Being an anime fan since the early 80's I am always checking out what's new to the states. Lately, there has been a number of titles coming to the states in droves, and there tends to be more sub-par work than good. Luckily, this is not a terrible series, not at all.The first disc deals with the introduction of the over arching storyline, as well as a number of characters in the story. Tohru Honda is an energetic high school freshman who always tries to look on the bright side. This eternal optimist has had her mettle tested recently, what with the death of her father then mother respectively, topped off by the fact that her grandfather had to move out of his house temporarily so that he could have his house redecorated. This latter bit doesn't seem like it would be that trying, however Tohru is not allowed to go with him and ends up fending for herself in a tent she pitches in a large estate. Little does she know that the property she is staying on turns out to be that of Shigure Sohma  and, more importantly, Yuki Sohma, a young man in Tohru's class. Yuki is the ""prince"" of the high school, handsome, charming, witty, and debonair. When he and Shigure (his older cousin) discover that Tohru has been staying in a tent they invite her into their home to keep house and cook for them in exchange for rent free living.This sounds like your typical anime set up... girl meets boy, girl ends up living with boy, they like each other, blah blah blah... however the story is much more complicated than that.  For starters, in enters Kyo Sohma, Yuki's cousin and arch nemesis. Since they were children they have been at each other's throats, trying to solve an age old grudge that went came far before them. Kyo has vowed to kill Yuki, but Yuki is a far superior martial artist and constantly ends up besting Kyo in combat. It is during one of these frequent sparring matches that Tohru discovers the Sohma family secret. She accidentally embraces Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo and  they turn into a dog, a rat, and a cat. Imagine her surprise that not only can they talk in their animal forms, but when the enchantment wears off the boys reappear in the natural state...utterly natural... with no clothing on.The Sohma family has been cursed for generations that when they are under great duress or when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex (other zodiac members not included) they turn into the animal of the Chinese zodiac of the year they were born. Yuki, born (I figure) in 1984 is the rat. Shigure (again, estimated to be born in 1970) is the Dog. The interesting part comes in with Kyo, who is actually the thirteenth animal in the Chinese zodiac. Actually, there is no such position, as the zodiac renews itself every 12 years. This ties into a folk story told early on in the series, about the rat tricking the cat into not attending a banquet in honor of all of the animals. This is precisely the reason why Kyo and Yuki do not get along, this age old grudge. That, and the fact, that with Kyo's animal comes certain humiliations, and certain things that he hides to himself as much as he can.It is agreed that Tohru can live with them for the time being. This is also approved of by Akito Sohma, the young master in the Sohma clan who's word is gospel as far as this family is concerned. Yuki immediately becomes suspicious of this quick approval, but Shigure encourages him to not worry about it, and just try to accept that things will be ok... And that's all just the first episode.  Later in the disc is an episode that introduces Kagura Sohma, a woman who thinks that Kyo and her are destined to be. Kagura is also a member of the zodiac, the boar or pig, born in 1983.As you can imagine, the series is delightful. The curse allows for some funny and tender moments between the characters, and the fact that there is an ""outsider"" who knows about it comes with it's own baggage.

723130,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00006SFK7,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Fruits Basket is a great anime. It's about an orphaned girl who goes to live with a family of shape shifters. The members of the Sohma family are cursed. When they touch a member of the opposite sex they turn into a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac. The story follows Tohru and her life with this weird family.I had a great time watching this anime and I think it's fantastic. That being said; it lacked something that could have made it a lot better. Emotion. There were some touching moments. Like the story of the family's doctor, and the ending where Kyo turns into his true form. If the relationships between the characters were developed a little more, instead of everyone being so stand offish the whole time those moments could have been more memorable. I'm not bashing this series at all. I actually really like it. My point is that it had way more potential than was actually achieved.The animation in Fruits Basket is high quality. The soundtrack and voice acting are also very good. The anime was produced masterfully. It's a classic, but it's a far cry from being one of the best anime's of all time.

723131,A38MNKGL5TK8XL,B00006SFK7,"lemonzest ""Jenn""","[165, 169]","(As of the time this review was written, no information on this series is posted, so I'll give a brief synopsis of this series.)Fruits Basket (called ""Furuba"" by fans) is the story of Tohru Honda, a high school student who has lost both of her parents. Her mother died only a year before the start of the series, and Touru misses her so much that she always carries her picture around with her. Tohru was living with her paternal grandfather until he began renovations on his home, so he asked her if she'd mind staying with some friends for awhile. Touru didn't want to impose on either of her friends, so she decided to set up a tent in the woods until the house was finished.. until one day she stumbles across the home of her classmate Yuki Sohma, and accidentally discovers his family's BIG secret - when ""huggled"" by someone of the opposite sex, they are cursed to turn into the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Tohru ends up moving in with the Sohma family as a housekeeper/cook in exchange for room and board, and she is introduced one-by-one to the rest of the clan (some of whom are.. VERY.. unusual).Now, you might be telling yourself ""I've seen this before, and it's name was 'Ranma 1/2'.."" - and you have NO IDEA how very wrong you are. Fruits Basket is a one of a kind series that manages to take a premise that could very well have followed the same path as Ranma (namely, relying on perverted jokes and accidental transformations to convey most of the plot and comedy), but instead becomes a chronicle of truly believable characters struggling to belong and dealing with what life has given them, both the good and bad.Over the course of its 26 episodes, Fruits Basket has made me laugh harder than any other anime I've ever seen, and then it goes right ahead and takes me on an emotional rollercoaster ride until I'm bawling along with the characters onscreen. But no matter what happened, it always leaves me with a smile and a feeling that if I could just have an ounce of the inner strength that these characters display, I would be all the better for it.Don't let me mislead you into thinking this is merely a cheesy tearjerker - Fruits Basket has PLENTY of high-energy martial arts battles, slapstick comedy, and wacky plot twists, but underneath all of this lies a deep emotional current that EVERYONE can connect with. If you've ever been jealous or angry with your family, undergone the loss of a close relative, felt completely alone, watch the people you love leave you behind, or have simply been misunderstood, you will regret missing this series. The true power of this series is found not in the comedy, but in the relationships between both family and friends.On a more shallow level, the characters are mostly rather good-looking, the animation is attractive - no amazing special effects, of course, but consistently high quality and well-suited to the story, and the music is very beautiful. Overall, this is a series for everyone to see, from the shoujo (girls') romance fans to comedy lovers to drama affectionados. You will NOT be disappointed - by episode 26, I guarantee you'll find yourself upset that ANOTHER season doesn't exist (yet). ^_^",5,The most heartfelt series I've ever seen.,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,3179,"['time', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'information', 'series', 'posted', ""'ll"", 'give', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'series', 'Basket', 'called', 'Furuba', 'fans', 'story', 'Tohru', 'Honda', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'lost', 'parents', 'mother', 'died', 'only', 'year', 'start', 'series', 'Touru', 'so', 'much', 'always', 'picture', 'Tohru', 'was', 'living', 'paternal', 'grandfather', 'began', 'renovations', 'home', 'asked', ""'d"", 'mind', 'staying', 'friends', 'awhile', 'Touru', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'impose', 'friends', 'decided', 'set', 'up', 'tent', 'woods', 'house', 'was', 'finished..', 'one', 'day', 'home', 'classmate', 'Yuki', 'Sohma', 'accidentally', 'family', 'BIG', 'secret', 'when', 'huggled', 'someone', 'opposite', 'sex', 'are', 'cursed', 'turn', 'animals', 'Chinese', 'zodiac', 'Tohru', 'up', 'moving', 'Sohma', 'family', 'housekeeper/cook', 'exchange', 'room', 'board', 'introduced', 'one-by-one', 'rest', 'clan', 'whom', 'are..', 'VERY..', 'unusual', '.Now', 'might', 'be', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'name', 'was', ""1/2'.."", 'have', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'how', 'very', 'wrong', 'are', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'one', 'kind', 'series', 'take', 'premise', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'followed', 'same', 'path', 'Ranma', 'namely', 'relying', 'perverted', 'jokes', 'accidental', 'transformations', 'convey', 'most', 'plot', 'comedy', 'instead', 'chronicle', 'truly', 'believable', 'characters', 'struggling', 'belong', 'dealing', 'what', 'life', 'given', 'good', 'bad.Over', 'course', '26', 'episodes', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'made', 'harder', 'other', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'right', 'ahead', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', ""'m"", 'bawling', 'along', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'always', 'smile', 'feeling', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'ounce', 'inner', 'strength', 'characters', 'display', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'it.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'merely', 'cheesy', 'tearjerker', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'PLENTY', 'high-energy', 'martial', 'arts', 'battles', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'wacky', 'plot', 'twists', 'deep', 'emotional', 'current', 'EVERYONE', 'can', 'connect', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'jealous', 'angry', 'family', 'undergone', 'loss', 'close', 'relative', 'felt', 'completely', 'alone', 'watch', 'people', 'love', 'leave', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'will', 'regret', 'missing', 'series', 'true', 'power', 'series', 'found', 'not', 'comedy', 'relationships', 'family', 'friends.On', 'more', 'shallow', 'level', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'rather', 'good-looking', 'animation', 'attractive', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'consistently', 'high', 'quality', 'well-suited', 'story', 'music', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Overall', 'series', 'everyone', 'see', 'shoujo', 'girls', 'romance', 'fans', 'comedy', 'lovers', 'drama', 'affectionados', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'disappointed', 'episode', '26', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'find', 'upset', 'ANOTHER', 'season', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', '^_^']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?

723134,AG1ZRMHJLYXEE,B00006SFK7,M. Hammond,"[5, 7]","What I love about anime is many stories are more than what they seem on the surface such as this one which one could throw in the school-girl/magical group, but it's also about the fears which many teens experience in Jr High/High school of fitting in, making friends/opening up to others mixed with an interesting horoscope twist.I was a bit disappointed on the credits(Funimation leans toward listing the actors names without linking them to their character). The English cast is full of the Texas Dragonball Z cast--Laura Bailey(Chi Chi, child Trunks), Eric Vale(Teen Trunks), Meredith McCoy(Android 18),&amp; John Burgmeier &amp; Jerry Jewel(haven't matched them to the characters yet, but I've seen them in the DBZ credits). The Japanese cast is even more familiar-Yuki is Aya Hisakawa(Sailor Moon's Sailor Mercury &amp; Cardcaptor Sakura's Kero), Tomokazu Seki(Escaflowne's Van, Cardcaptor Sakura's Touya, GTO's Kunio &amp; Real Bout's Kusanagi to name a few) is Kyo, &amp; Yuka Imai &amp; Ryotaro Okiayu(Excel Saga's Matsuya &amp; Watanabe &amp; Burn Up Excess's Rio &amp; Yuji) are Arisa &amp; Shigure. Kotono Mitsuishi(Excel, Sailor Moon, Dragon-Half's Mink) is Kagura(poor Kyo!), one of the characters I haven't warmed to, but like Tohru, I love kitties. According to my source Blue Seed's Kusanagi(Kazuhiko Inoue) voices Hatori Soma.The Yuki fan club are frighteningly familiar(shades of the Revolutionary Girl Utena chorus/shadows), but not too intrusive yet. I like Kyo best as he seems to have the most distance to cover to becoming domesticated, but Yuki also has the traces of untamed skitishness in his approach to friendship with those outside the Soma family.

I'm a grrrl and I far prefer the boy's toys. *wicked grin*  My favorite things to watch are sci-fi epics, fantasy and action-adventure type stuff... but... but... this is one of the most heartwarming, heart-wrenching and HUMAN anime I have ever run across...I cried.  At several parts.  You think YOUR family is disfunctional?  HA.  You ain't met the Sohmas yet... *shivers* They are _severely_ messed up - but trying very, very hard to deal anyway.  Other reviewers have given details on plot and situation.  The curse.  The transformations.  But those are just window-dressing to the real human issues; love, friendship, acceptance, compassion, grief, personal strength, loyalty, finding your place in the world, growing up, moving on.  All tough questions.  Few easy answers.  These are just humans trying to get through their lives the best they can, recovering from their problems the best they can and trying to understand life the best they can... until they discover this one girl... Tohru Honda.  She's not the brightest, she doesn't have *all* the answers, and she doesn't always do exactly the right thing every time, but what Tohru does best is simply accept them and love them - despite their rough edges and twisted lives and terrible curses.  And slowly, painfully the Sohmas come to love and accept her in return.I simply can't fully express how wonderful, wrenching and uplifting I found this series.  Not in a silly, sappy way either.

AND 6 episodes per disc, and the disc has 3 regions, any fan of special features would freak out, why the only way they could get any better would be is if it came with a poster or something rather.Overall I suguest Fruits Basket to anyone who is willing to give it a chance, the anime has elements from many genres and is a perfect balance of Comedy and Character devolopment.Buy it today.",5,Anime at its best.,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,1368,"['Fruits', 'Basket', 'quite', 'interesting', 'anime', 'first', 'show', 'top', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'potential', 'viewers', 'giant', 'eyes', 'crazy', 'fan', 'club', 'girls', 'episode', 'two', 'show', 'really', 'off', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'unique', 'different', 'own', 'way', 'devolop', 'quite', 'bit', 'course', 'series', 'show', 'even', 'funnier', 'note', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'amazing', 'dub', 'who', 'like', 'dubs', 'fact', 'most', 'time', 'watch', 'series', 'note', 'consider', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'DVDs', 'be', 'really', 'first', 'truely', 'amazingly', 'done', 'DVDS', 'time', 'least', 'knowledge', 'most', 'Anime', 'discs', 'had', '2-5', 'episodes', 'only', 'features', 'were', 'textless', 'endings', 'Can', 'say', 'crappy', 'boring', 'Fruits', 'basket', 'not', 'only', 'previews', 'other', 'Funimation', 'stuff', 'interviews', 'documentary', 'quot', 'eye', 'catches', 'quot', 'are', 'explained', 'documentry', 'even', 'scenes', 'footage', '6', 'episodes', 'disc', 'disc', '3', 'regions', 'fan', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'freak', 'out', 'why', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'get', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'came', 'poster', 'something', 'rather.Overall', 'suguest', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'anyone', 'who', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'anime', 'elements', 'many', 'genres', 'perfect', 'balance', 'Comedy', 'Character', 'devolopment.Buy', 'today']",Fruits Basket: Volume One - A Great Transformation?
723139,A215QIEKD5O8G7,B00006SFK7,"Reedekullervo ""reedekullervo""","[33, 34]","It's hard to categorize Fruits Basket. It's not very action-oriented. It's probably aimed more at girls than boys, yet I think any number of people, male or female, young and old would enjoy it. The story seems simplistic on the surface. It could be called ""cute."" It could also be called ""sweet"" but I believe that those descriptions short change this rather complex story of how kindness, being true to yourself and trying to find the good points in everyone can be woven into an entertaining and satisfying story. Throw in plenty of drama, a hint of mystery, a little romance, some humor and you'll be hooked. Although it has it's sad moments, more often then not, this series will genuinely make you smile.Fundamentally Fruits Basket is a story about finding your family,  a place where you can ""just be yourself"". When Tohru Honda loses her mother, the only family she has ever had, she is fortunate enough to stumble across the home of ""Prince"" Yuki, the most adored boy in her high school. When he and his older cousin Shigure learn of Tohru's circumstances (she's living in a tent) they offer her a place in their home in exchange for housework and cooking. This girl is possibly the only other person they will meet whose life is filled with as much sadness as theirs. Such bravery in the face of adversity touches their hearts, although you can be sure that Shigure is also happy to have hot, home-cooked meals everyday and clean laundry! Before she can truly appreciate her luck, she soon learns that her new family has a secret curse. When hugged by members of the opposite sex, or when under a great deal of stress, they turn into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Although the transformations sometimes are used playfully, the Sohma's truly are burdened by their curse.  Tohru promises maintain their secret and thereby is allowed to stay with them.  The greatest transformation of them all might be when the one the Sohmas undergo by opening their hearts and home to TohruThis first disc has 6 episodes, all of which are outstanding. They introduce the core characters, set up the tone and direction of the story, and each one builds on the other in a logical and satisfying progression. The main characters are of course, Tohru Honda, an ordinary girl who has known plenty of sadness in her life, but is also able to find happiness. You also meet the Sohmas, Yuki, the charming and emotionally reserved ""prince"" of high school, his goofy but generous older cousin Shigure, whose house they live in, as well Yuki's hated rival, the short-tempered and brash, Kyo. You also catch a glimpse the mysterious and sinister Akito Sohma, head of the family who conditionally allows Tohru to stay. He is a dark and menacing presence that is seldom seen, yet always felt and his promise to have Tohru's memory erased remains a constant threat to fragile happiness of Tohru and the Sohmas. We also meet Tohru's steadfast friends, the weird Hana who senses electrical signals and Uo, a former gang member as well as Tohru's beloved mother, seen only in flashback.As Tohru adjusts to her new life in Shigure's house, she comes to know each of the boys a little better, often seeing their good qualities when they can't see any for themselves. It's such a simple thing, yet it's easy to see how that, coupled with Tohru's willingness to make the best of any situation and her unfailing kindness begin to make a difference in all of the Sohma's lives. Perhaps she can even bring Yuki and Kyo, who loathe each other's guts, if not into friendship, at least to an understanding of each other. The standout episode on this disc is number 5, where Tohru is torn between her new-found family with the Sohmas and returning to her old life with her paternal grandfather, where she just doesn't quite fit in. It nicely encapsulates all of the good qualities of the story so far, and further illustrates the profound effect that her short stay with the Sohmas has already had on them.In addition to the wonderful story, the animation is done beautifully. The lines are crisp, elegant and spare. I really liked the muted colors and pastels that are used and the music is gentle as well. Taken all together it gives the whole series a certain restful quality in keeping with the story that is more about characters and emotions then action.  I applaud FUNamation for putting together such a nice package and for putting 6 episodes on one disc, as well as some nice extras. If you are at all like me, you'll devour the first disc and be ready for the second in no time. I had to go out the next night and buy the rest of the DVDs since I couldn't wait to finish the story. Fruits Basket is a really unique anime that is off the beaten path and well worth your while. It's become my new favorite anime series and hope many people discover it's wonderful qualities and enjoy it as much as I did.",5,My Favorite Anime!,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,4881,"['hard',

Focusing on an old legend based on the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, Tohru is a girl whose mother has recently died and now lives her life in a tent not far from the Sohma family house. One day the Sohmas discover Tohru is living there and decide to invite her to live their home, which is currently inhabited by Shigure Sohma (a writer) and Yuki Sohma (one of Tohru's popular classmates at school).Feeling completely indebted to the Sohma family, Tohru begins her life at their house cooking and cleaning and getting to know Yuki, who she develops feelings for. Soon enough another Sohma family member shows up. He is the hot-headed Kyou Sohma, who is ALWAYS ""playing the game of cat and mouse"" with Yuki. Quite literally.So what's the catch? The Sohma family are the reincarnated members of the 'Juunishi' , or 12 Zodiac animals, and when they hug a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their innate Zodiac animal. Imagine Tohru's surprise when she accidentally finds this out! Up until now, no non-members of the Juunishi have been allowed know about the secret without having their memories erased, but Tohru's warm heart and kindness cause her to become the first exception to this rule.Together Tohru and the Sohma family go through lots of adventures and ordeals that are bound to make any viewer laugh and cry and want to tell their neighbor all about this crazy new show that they've discovered.
