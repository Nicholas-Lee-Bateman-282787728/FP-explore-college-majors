1621362,A1ATAX8H2WITBU,B00B2V65LY,Douglas Kaiser,"[5, 6]","One of the cheapest, most poorly produced movies to ever make it to DVD. The script is full of holes, the production is incredibly cheap (the computer generated shark looks like it was done on somebody's laptop), and the acting is just plain deplorable (with the exception of Angela Parent, the film's human villain, whose talent shines through even this horrid script. It would be nice to see what she can do in a REAL movie). It's so bad, it's not even cheesy. To top it off, the movie lasts 62 minutes, followed by 13 minutes of credits in which everyone involved gets mentioned at least twice. Don't waste your time or money on this turkey.",1,"BAD, AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY",1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,644,"['One', 'cheapest', 'most', 'poorly', 'produced', 'movies', 'ever', 'make', 'DVD', 'script', 'full', 'holes', 'production', 'incredibly', 'cheap', 'computer', 'generated', 'shark', 'looks', 'was', 'done', 'somebody', 'laptop', 'acting', 'just', 'plain', 'deplorable', 'exception', 'Angela', 'Parent', 'film', 'human', 'villain', 'talent', 'even', 'horrid', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'REAL', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'cheesy', 'top', 'off', 'movie', '62', 'minutes', 'followed', '13', 'minutes', 'credits', 'everyone', 'involved', 'mentioned', 'least', 'twice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'turkey']",Attack of the Jurassic Shark

From its laughable special effects to incredibly bad acting and terrible music, ATTACK OF THE JURASSIC SHARK is a prime example of cinematic ineptitude.  SEE the shark swim in six inches of water!  SEE sexy girls run in slow motion boobs bouncing up and down.  SEE the huge shark jump out of the lake to chomp on the bad girl!SEE a movie with more padding than a Maidenform bra!This is often hilarious but ultimately really bad.

An oil company doing illegal drilling has drilled too deep and has opened up a pocket. A Megalodon has been released into the lake. Some college girls looking to expose the illegal drilling get trapped on the island in the middle of the lake along with some other bad actors who are art thieves. The bad guys all wear black.The shark is computer generated and can swim easily in a foot of water and pick off people standing on the beach. The sound track cheaply echoes when they are recording in a hallway. In one scene, one of the bad guys has a girl in front of him in his gun sight when he is hit from behind...and the girl shows up behind him a second later!The special effects had me laughing out loud at this film that would make Ed Wood proud. The acting and editing were equally horrible.Parental Guide: F-Bomb, no sex, no nudity. This is a terrible film that I greatly enjoyed because it was so bad.
