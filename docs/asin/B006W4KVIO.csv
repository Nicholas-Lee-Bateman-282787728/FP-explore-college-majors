Mean step mom likes to talk to her alter self in the mirror. Both stepmom and daughter want to establish a closer relationship with the dad and both see the other as being in the way. Mom talks dad into forcibly sending daughter off to an isolated, month long, wilderness camp for correcting troubling youth behaviors. Campers go missing and then dying (not shown) and of course the camp has some history which one of the campers in the latest information age hook discovered on wiki.Problems:(1.) DVD cover has nothing to do with movie. False advertising. Cheap production cost saving of no subtitles for hearing impaired or to substitute for poor audio.(2.) Way over the top, not believable if not laughable, character portrayal. The military boot camp image of a whistle blowing, hard nose, do push ups and jumping jacks 'til you drop camp commander just doesn't happen except in movies. Wilderness camps actually do a lot of journaling, discussion groups, wilderness hiking with individual camp set up responsibilities. It's highly choreographed, staged and closely monitored.(3.) Half the movie (45 minutes) were just four scenes repeated over and over. The same moon position with the exact same clouds passing it was shown repeatedly throughout the movie. Poor clouds they must have felt like bored actors when asked to repeat a scene over and over again. Then there were all the scenes of totem poles, shot close up, as if they had some significance. Never panned out. Lots of scenes of some lake. Also never meant anything other than a cheap time filler. Finally, were the cheap to produce constant flashbacks.(4.) The supposed night scenes were so cheaply filtered day light scenes that you could clearly see strong shadows.(5.) Overbearing background sounds to create drama when poor script and acting can't get it done. Annoying were the too loud and boring same limited piano notes and other sounds. Just too distracting.(6.) The conclusion that all the participants were part of a dream was cutesy unconvincing cheap ending.",1,Kiosk Rating &lt;1,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2155,"['Classic', 'psychologically', 'weak', 'rich', 'dad', 'mean', 'stepmom', 'perceived', 'angry', 'irresponsible', 'annoying', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Mean', 'step', 'mom', 'talk', 'alter', 'self', 'mirror', 'stepmom', 'daughter', 'want', 'establish', 'closer', 'relationship', 'dad', 'see', 'other', 'being', 'way', 'Mom', 'talks', 'dad', 'forcibly', 'sending', 'daughter', 'isolated', 'month', 'long', 'wilderness', 'camp', 'correcting', 'troubling', 'youth', 'behaviors', 'Campers', 'go', 'missing', 'then', 'dying', 'not', 'shown', 'course', 'camp', 'history', 'one', 'campers', 'latest', 'information', 'age', 'hook', 'discovered', 'wiki.Problems', '1', 'DVD', 'cover', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'False', 'advertising', 'Cheap', 'production', 'cost', 'saving', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'substitute', 'poor', 'audio.', '2', 'Way', 'top', 'not', 'believable', 'not', 'laughable', 'character', 'portrayal', 'military', 'boot', 'camp', 'image', 'whistle', 'blowing', 'hard', 'nose', 'do', 'push', 'ups', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'drop', 'camp', 'commander', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movies', 'Wilderness', 'camps', 'actually', 'do', 'lot', 'journaling', 'discussion', 'groups', 'wilderness', 'hiking', 'individual', 'camp', 'set', 'up', 'responsibilities', 'highly', 'choreographed', 'staged', 'closely', 'monitored.', '3', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'were', 'just', 'four', 'scenes', 'repeated', 'over', 'same', 'moon', 'position', 'exact', 'same', 'clouds', 'passing', 'was', 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'movie', 'Poor', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'bored', 'actors', 'when', 'asked', 'repeat', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'were', 'scenes', 'totem', 'poles', 'shot', 'close', 'up', 'had', 'significance', 'Never', 'panned', 'out', 'Lots', 'scenes', 'lake', 'Also', 'never', 'meant', 'anything', 'other', 'cheap', 'time', 'filler', 'Finally', 'were', 'cheap', 'produce', 'constant', 'flashbacks.', '4', 'supposed', 'night', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'cheaply', 'filtered', 'day', 'light', 'scenes', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'strong', 'shadows.', '5', 'Overbearing', 'background', 'create', 'drama', 'when', 'poor', 'script', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'done', 'Annoying', 'were', 'too', 'loud', 'boring', 'same', 'limited', 'piano', 'notes', 'other', 'sounds', 'Just', 'too', 'distracting.', '6', 'conclusion', 'participants', 'were', 'part', 'dream', 'was', 'cutesy', 'unconvincing', 'cheap', 'ending']",Snow White: A Deadly Summer
1520459,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B006W4KVIO,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[0, 0]","This is a bad low budget movie. So bad that its just bad. Everything from the wooden acting and terrible lighting to the characters with no personality, emotion, charm or flair. You'd expect this is some sort of high school project, but no its just a failed attempt to cash in on the Snow White name. Picking on this movie is just far too easy. Its one of those movies that you'll want to shut it off in the first five minutes and if you withstand it to the end it will slap you in the face with its ending. Even the camera angles seem off and very strange. Sometimes the camera angle doesn't change for a for a few minutes and that just seems lazy.I was expecting this to be some modernization of the classic tale where Snow White is the daughter of a rich businessman or mayor and Snow's new step mother would kill him and she'd go off on a quest to stop her. Alas, this movie is totally different where a rich girl is sent off to a summer camp for troubled youths. Instead of 'sent away' I should have said taken away by force. She wakes up with 2 men that have come for her and take her away kind of against her will to the summer camp. I say kind of against her will, because she doesn't really fight it. When she arrives at the camp and meets the headmaster he tells her the several reasons she's there, one of which was grand theft auto when she didn't actually steal the car, nor did she stick up for herself. She was just okay with it. That's a major problem I have with this movie, everyone is okay with the flawed logic, no one really questions anything. No one tries to escape at least to a telephone to tell someone I've been kidnapped and put in some summer camp!Eventually the other campers start dying. Lamely dying. There's no sense of dread or suspense. People are just found dead or someone says they're dead and you never actually see it. Each of the campers is so dull and uninspiring its just like a placeholder will no longer be on screen.Please avoid this cash in.",1,A terrible movie with flat acting and terrible direction,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1988,"['bad', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'So', 'bad', 'just', 'bad', 'Everything', 'wooden', 'acting', 'terrible', 'lighting', 'characters', 'personality', 'emotion', 'charm', 'flair', ""'d"", 'expect', 'sort', 'high', 'school', 'project', 'just', 'failed', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Snow', 'White', 'name', 'Picking', 'movie', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'want', 'shut', 'off', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'withstand', 'end', 'will', 'slap', 'face', 'ending', 'Even', 'camera', 'seem', 'very', 'strange', 'Sometimes', 'camera', 'angle', ""n't"", 'change', 'few', 'minutes', 'just', 'lazy.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'modernization', 'classic', 'tale', 'where', 'Snow', 'White', 'daughter', 'rich', 'businessman', 'mayor', 'Snow', 'new', 'step', 'mother', 'would', 'kill', ""'d"", 'go', 'off', 'quest', 'stop', 'Alas', 'movie', 'totally', 'different', 'where', 'rich', 'girl', 'sent', 'off', 'summer', 'camp', 'troubled', 'youths', 'Instead', ""'sent"", 'away', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'taken', 'away', 'force', '2', 'men', 'have', 'come', 'take', 'away', 'kind', 'will', 'summer', 'camp', 'say', 'kind', 'will', ""n't"", 'really', 'fight', 'When', 'camp', 'headmaster', 'several', 'reasons', 'there', 'one', 'was', 'grand', 'theft', 'auto', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'steal', 'car', 'did', 'stick', 'up', 'herself', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'everyone', 'okay', 'flawed', 'logic', 'one', 'really', 'questions', 'anything', 'one', 'escape', 'least', 'telephone', 'tell', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kidnapped', 'put', 'summer', 'camp', 'Eventually', 'other', 'campers', 'start', 'dying', 'Lamely', 'dying', 'sense', 'dread', 'suspense', 'People', 'are', 'just', 'found', 'dead', 'someone', ""'re"", 'dead', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'campers', 'so', 'dull', 'uninspiring', 'just', 'placeholder', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'screen.Please', 'avoid', 'cash']",Snow White: A Deadly Summer
1520460,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B006W4KVIO,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","Admittedly this fractured spin of the classic fairy tale is pretty bad but in a campy sort of way.

The script is preposterously crafted leaving no clich&eacute; unturned and the mid-twenties teen cast is lame but there are three performances of dubious note:  Eric Roberts continues to pay for his rehab with another awful turn as the distraught dad; B-movie action star Tim Abell overacts shamelessly as camp director Hunter, but it is BRADY BUNCH alumnus Maureen McCormack as the wicked stepmother who takes hysterics to new levels.

Some of her choices lead her father to wonder what has gotten into her and her stepmother, wanting to get her out of the house, convinces Daddy that the best solution is to send Snow away to camp. The camp is not the type of place you want to go for the summer, its a discipline camp meant to deal with troublesome teens. snow makes the best of it, but begin to think she's being watched. A series of events lead Snow to think something bad is happening here, and the legend of what happened summers ago leads her to think she might know who is picking off her fellow campers, one by one.This was one of the movies I should have watched the previews for. By watching it and reading the editorial, I could have seen just how badly the poorly the movie was produced, how badly the lines were going to be delivered, and how cheaply this was made. The editorial breaks the movie down, delivering not only the idea behind it but what is happening at the campground. (not that it is hard to figure out).The acting in the movie was rigid, even from the seasoned pair hired to play the parents. I really thought that it might be better,considering the actors. Eric Roberts and Maureen McCormick did surprise me a little when I saw them here, it was one of the reasons i rented it in the first place, but they did not help as much as i would have hoped. Their acting seemed stiff and a little rigid and, despite some kind of mean stuff from McCormick, I longed for an Evil Step Mother out of another tale. Shanley Caswell, who I recognized from a few TV roles, did alright in the movie but, like the parents, the lines were delivered poorly and the movie just seemed low quality. The role she had was not good, either, and seemed atypical at best. The campers were even worse, with a montage of people that are hard to root for when the horror starts.The idea behind the movie seemed aimed at a PG-13 audience, trying to coast the line and deliver a fairy tale that was retold a different way. I actually liked that part of it, the idea itself, thinking the way the main characters came together and the way the stepmother planned on getting rid of her was interesting. This type of modernization seemed interesting, actually, but the way it was pieced together kind of tattered the creativity. If it would have been less rigid and would have made better choices, it could have been at least decently entertaining.It surprised me to read this cost an estimated 1 million bucks to make because it really did not look like it.
