1366749,AUIGKUYMTLGDA,B003V6L95U,andiepie17,"[1, 1]","I have a whole shelf of Richard Simmons exercise vcr tapes and dvds.  Why?  Richard Simmons actually makes it fun to exercise.  If you like the old dances like the twist, the monkey, the swim; you will have fun and be amazed that you are exercising, too.  My favorite is Disco Blast-Off; that vcr tape is the one I use when I ""just don't wanna"".  I love the music. (I wish this one would come out in dvd, but so far I've only seen it in vcr tape.)  And Richard Simmons has real sized people in his exercise vcr tapes and dvds...not the impossibly thin people you see in other people's exercise vcr tapes and videos.  So please give Richard Simmons a try; you might actually think exercise can be sort of, maybe, fun!",5,Sweating wtih Richard Simmons,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,716,"['have', 'whole', 'shelf', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'exercise', 'vcr', 'tapes', 'dvds', 'Why', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'actually', 'exercise', 'like', 'old', 'dances', 'twist', 'monkey', 'swim', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'amazed', 'are', 'exercising', 'too', 'favorite', 'Disco', 'Blast-Off', 'vcr', 'tape', 'one', 'use', 'when', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'love', 'music', 'wish', 'one', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'vcr', 'tape', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'real', 'sized', 'people', 'exercise', 'vcr', 'tapes', 'dvds', 'not', 'impossibly', 'thin', 'people', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'exercise', 'vcr', 'tapes', 'videos', 'So', 'please', 'give', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'try', 'might', 'actually', 'think', 'exercise', 'can', 'be', 'sort', 'maybe', 'fun']",N/A
