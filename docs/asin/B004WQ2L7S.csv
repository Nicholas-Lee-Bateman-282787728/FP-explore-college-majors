1430890,AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5,B004WQ2L7S,"Abert ""AMY""","[6, 6]","I confess that I am totally unfamiliar with this work.  I have considerable difficulty following the story with its biolab setting, which otherwise should be in the forest.This is one of the famous Zurich knapsack productions of the 21st century.  No trace of the M&auml;rchenoper, but there are still reminiscents of the Anderson-like folklores, though.In that sense, this production should not count as a failure, however unlike the original setting.Certainly, in its most important sense - music wise, this is a first rate performance.  Ingo Metzmacher orchestrates the folklore materials in a grandiose manner, and the result is very luxurious to the ears.  On top of the rich sounding orchestra, of course we have the 21st century tenor king Jonas Kaufmann performing the title role of the King's son in one of his perfect renditions.  Kaufmann covers himself in total glory here, from singing to acting to stage presence, even though only dorned in everyday modern attire (this is a waste, in a way).  Not since the days of Pavarotti has one seen an operatic tenor singing and performing on stage with such total ease and utter abandon.  He is not singing or acting; he is just communicating via a media called opera - communicating to the audience, with his co-performers, with the conductor's orchestra, even communicating with the composer and librettist.In a similar vein is Isabel Rey as the King's daughter, disguised as the goose girl.I never realised what a great operatic performer Ms. Rey is - I have seen her in many other recordings: with Florez, with Harnoncourt, and others.  Here, she is so completely immersed in the character that you easily forget that she is acting.  The voice is not particularly thrilling, but it has a very warm colour and she modulates it so well that there is complete vocal acting every time she opens her mouth.  This soprano is on par with the excellent Kaufmann and makes a perfect match as the Konigskinder.This performance would have similarly gained outstanding success if issued as a CD, for the rest of the cast is also wonderful.  The witch, the minstrel, even the chorus, there is not one single weaklink.",5,"A great performance, but do get the blu-ray to avoid missing Act III.",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2163,"['confess', 'am', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'have', 'considerable', 'difficulty', 'following', 'story', 'biolab', 'setting', 'otherwise', 'should', 'be', 'forest.This', 'one', 'famous', 'Zurich', 'knapsack', 'productions', '21st', 'century', 'trace', 'M', 'auml', 'rchenoper', 'are', 'still', 'reminiscents', 'Anderson-like', 'folklores', 'though.In', 'sense', 'production', 'should', 'not', 'count', 'failure', 'however', 'original', 'setting.Certainly', 'most', 'important', 'sense', 'music', 'wise', 'first', 'rate', 'performance', 'Ingo', 'Metzmacher', 'folklore', 'materials', 'grandiose', 'manner', 'result', 'very', 'luxurious', 'ears', 'top', 'rich', 'sounding', 'orchestra', 'course', 'have', '21st', 'century', 'tenor', 'king', 'Jonas', 'Kaufmann', 'performing', 'title', 'role', 'King', 'son', 'one', 'perfect', 'renditions', 'Kaufmann', 'total', 'glory', 'here', 'singing', 'acting', 'stage', 'presence', 'even', 'only', 'dorned', 'everyday', 'modern', 'attire', 'waste', 'way', 'Not', 'days', 'Pavarotti', 'one', 'seen', 'operatic', 'tenor', 'singing', 'performing', 'stage', 'such', 'total', 'ease', 'utter', 'abandon', 'not', 'singing', 'acting', 'just', 'communicating', 'media', 'called', 'opera', 'communicating', 'audience', 'co-performers', 'conductor', 'orchestra', 'even', 'communicating', 'composer', 'librettist.In', 'similar', 'vein', 'Isabel', 'Rey', 'King', 'daughter', 'disguised', 'goose', 'girl.I', 'never', 'realised', 'what', 'great', 'operatic', 'performer', 'Ms.', 'Rey', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'recordings', 'Florez', 'Harnoncourt', 'others', 'Here', 'so', 'completely', 'immersed', 'character', 'easily', 'forget', 'acting', 'voice', 'not', 'particularly', 'thrilling', 'very', 'warm', 'colour', 'so', 'well', 'complete', 'vocal', 'acting', 'time', 'mouth', 'soprano', 'par', 'excellent', 'Kaufmann', 'perfect', 'match', 'Konigskinder.This', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'similarly', 'gained', 'outstanding', 'success', 'issued', 'CD', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'wonderful', 'witch', 'minstrel', 'even', 'chorus', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'weaklink']",Kaufmann/Zurich-Humperdinck-Konigskinder

The plot is rather simplistic. It is the music that makes it work. It starts as a fairy tale, but develops into a real life situation, with bad people, the grownups, and good people, the kids that through their innocence recognize the fairy tale.  It is juxtaposition of the fairy tale world and the real one. Regrettably, this production forgot about the fairy tale side, and brings everything to a modern world. It looks awkward and certainly not effective. But... the music is great and makes the separation easy to identify. Kaufmann is the star of this production. His acting compensates for the misplaced production. Rey is also good, but not brilliant.  At some point I was tempted to turn off the image and keep the music only.This opera was a great success when premiered in NY, later to be almost forgotten. Kudos to Zurich Opera for reviving this opera. I wish the staging would have been different. Since it is a seldom produced opera, I strongly recommend you get the Blue-Ray. I also recommend learning more about Ernst Rosmer (pseudonym of Elsa Bernstein-Porges). Her father relation to the composer and Wagner is quite intriguing.",4,Great music,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1255,"['witch', 'young', 'King', 'finding', 'Queen', 'Great', 'ingredients', 'fairy', 'tale', 'one', 'sad', 'ending', 'plot', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'music', 'work', 'fairy', 'tale', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'bad', 'people', 'grownups', 'good', 'people', 'kids', 'innocence', 'recognize', 'fairy', 'tale', 'juxtaposition', 'fairy', 'tale', 'world', 'real', 'one', 'Regrettably', 'production', 'forgot', 'fairy', 'tale', 'side', 'everything', 'modern', 'world', 'awkward', 'certainly', 'not', 'effective', 'music', 'great', 'separation', 'easy', 'identify', 'Kaufmann', 'star', 'production', 'acting', 'compensates', 'misplaced', 'production', 'Rey', 'also', 'good', 'not', 'brilliant', 'point', 'was', 'tempted', 'turn', 'off', 'image', 'keep', 'music', 'only.This', 'opera', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'when', 'premiered', 'NY', 'later', 'be', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'Kudos', 'Zurich', 'Opera', 'reviving', 'opera', 'wish', 'staging', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'seldom', 'produced', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'get', 'Blue-Ray', 'also', 'recommend', 'learning', 'more', 'Ernst', 'Rosmer', 'pseudonym', 'Elsa', 'Bernstein-Porges', 'father', 'relation', 'composer', 'Wagner', 'quite', 'intriguing']",Kaufmann/Zurich-Humperdinck-Konigskinder
1430892,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004WQ2L7S,Grady Harp,"[27, 28]","Yes, everyone has heard and seen Humperdinck's H&auml;nsel und Gretel, and it has become a holiday staple in opera houses around the world.  But few, at least in the US, have heard of another work by Humperdinck - K&ouml;nigskinder - that receives a sterling performance here. The opera dates to 1910 and was hailed as the most important new opera since Parsifal. But in the century since, outside German-speaking countries K&ouml;nigskinder is rarely seen on stage.The story is involved (the opera is 3 hours in length) and flows as follows: Once upon a time a witch cast a spell upon a king's daughter and held her in servitude as a goose-herd. A prince found her in the forest and loved her. She loved him in return, and would gladly have gone away from her sordid surroundings with him, though she had spurned the crown which he had offered her in exchange for her wreath of flowers; but when she escaped from her jailer she found that she could not break the charm which held her imprisoned in the forest. Then the prince left the crown lying at her feet and continued his wanderings. Scarcely had he gone when there came to the hut of the witch a broommaker and a woodchopper, guided by a wandering minstrel. They were ambassadors from the city of Hellabrunn, which had been so long without a king that its boorish burghers themselves felt the need of a ruler in spite of their boorishness. To the wise woman the ambassadors put the questions: Who shall be this ruler and by what sign shall they recognize him? The witch tells them that their sovereign shall be the first person who enters their gates after the bells have rung the noon hour on the morrow, which is the day of the Hella festival. Then the minstrel catches sight of the lovely goose-girl, and through the prophetic gift possessed by poets he recognizes in her a rightly born princess for his people. By the power of his art he is enabled to put aside the threatening spells of the witch and compel the hag to deliver the maiden into his care. He persuades her to break the enchantment that had held her bound hitherto and defy the wicked power.Meanwhile, however, grievous misfortunes have befallen the prince, her lover. He has gone to Hellabrunn, and desiring to learn to serve in order that he might better know how to rule, he had taken service as a swineherd. The daughter of the innkeeper becomes enamored of the shapely body of the prince, whose proud spirit she cannot understand, and who has repulsed her advances. His thoughts go back to the goosegirl whose wreath, with its fresh fragrance, reminds him of his duty. He attempts to teach the burghers their own worth, but the wench whose love he had repulsed accuses him of theft, and he is about to be led off to prison when the bells peal forth the festal hour.Joyfully the watchmen throw open the strong town gates and the multitude and gathered councilors fall back to receive their king. But through the doors enters the gooseherd, proudly wearing her crown and followed by her flock and the minstrel. The lovers fall into each other's arms, but only the poet and a little child recognize them as of royal blood. The boorish citizens, who had fancied that their king would appear in regal splendor, drive the youth and maiden out, burn the witch and cripple the minstrel by breaking one of his legs on the wheel. Seeking his home, the prince and his love lose their way in the forest during a snowstorm and die of a poisoned loaf made by the witch, for which the prince had bartered his broken crown, under the same tree which had sheltered them on their first meeting but the children of Hellabrunn, who had come out in search of them, guided by a bird, find their bodies buried under the snow and give them royal acclaim and burial. And the prescient minstrel hymns their virtues.Ingo Metzmacher conducts the Zurich Opera House Orchestra and Zurich Opera House Chorus and the impeccable cast includes Liliana Nikiteanu (Soprano), Jonas Kaufmann (Tenor), Reinhard Mayr, Isabel Rey (Soprano), Marie-th&eacute;rese Albert, Wiebke Lehmkuhl (Alto), Oliver Widmer (Baritone), Kai Florian Bischoff, and Boguslaw Bidzinski (Tenor).  The most memorable in this fine cast is the extraordinary performance by Jonas Kaufman who continues to prove to the world that he possesses one of the finest tenor voices with a wide range and the physical prowess to create credible characters even when we know little about an opera.  Humperdinck's frequent bows to Wagner's music serves Kaufmann very well.  The entire opera is excellent here but the star is indeed Kaufmann.
