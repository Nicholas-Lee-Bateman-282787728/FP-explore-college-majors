I found myself wanting the Greene's to choke egomaniac, sex fiend, greedy, manipulative, not nearly as good looking as I thought he was in season 1, sanctimonious without accompanying religiosity Bill for at least another full minute, for Barb to wake up out of whatever fogs she's been in and finally inform her husband that she'll no longer tolerate his philandering ... regardless of his supposed testimony to go back to his fundamentalist roots, for Nicki to &#34;shut the H up&#34; with her whining, smirking, manipulative, destructive, falsely pious blather (actually, now that I think about it, she's Bill's female reflection) ... and for Margene to admit that she's bisexual, sexually attracted to Ben, and too naive to actually survive without at least three other people to care for her. I was very glad that Ana ran off.On the other hand, I've obviously become so invested in the show that I'm writing a full length review.Harry Dean Stanton is absolutely superb in his role as The Prophet; not only does he absolutely have that raw-boned appearance ... defines the concept, actually ... but voice inflection, facial expression, and entirety of presentation is award worthy (Hello, again, Kiser Pease. You ain't changed not one little bit in 40 long years. Where the Lilies Bloom made an indelible impression on me; this actor was a large part of that).I'll be watching for other movies/shows that feature Matt Ross, who portrays Alby Grant; he has that charisma that makes him very interesting to watchThe other actors in Big Love play their roles to the hilt as well, as has been discussed by many other viewers.While I know that there are many discrepancies between the actual lives of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints members and this show, from my research ... inspired by the show, it seems that there are clear depictions of rituals, rites and attitudes of both the Fundamentalists and LDS. The show depicts an interesting glimpse behind the veil of the religions, while being entertaining.",4,I'm still watching ...

1132791,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0011UMC72,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[13, 26]","These are outlaw Mormons in this series. I didn't realize this until I had seen enough episodes of BIG LOVE.  I erroneously thought that those Mormons living lawfully, one husband and wife only, are tolerant of polygamous Mormons. No, the lawful Mormons are the first to turn the outlaws in to the authorities and or to shun them upon discovery.  I also did not realize that the outlaw Mormons view their polygamous lifestyles as part of their religious hereafter planning.  They all plan on being reunited in the hereafter and being together in the large family they have built together.  That is why being fruitful and multiplying so many times is important.I keep watching this show every season even though I find these characters infuriating.  Most infuriating is the effect this lifestyle has on their children.  It's not so bad when they are young but when they become teens, any decisions they want to make about their own futures and lifestyles are stomped on because they have to follow in these polygamous footsteps.  Talk about being in a straight jacket for life!Salt Lake City businessman Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton) is our polygamist in chief and he usually drives me absolute bats.  Servicing this guy, in any sense of the word, is a full time job for every other character.  One must be a huge egomaniac to occupy this position.  Anything less than having full egomania and you would be forced to find yourself insufferable. When I am about to hurl something through my tv screen at his his head, I do remember though that he was brought up on an outlaw Mormon compound with a guru head and totally insane parents.  Compared to them he is a model of decorum and the placid lifestyle. His entire business will collapse if he is discovered to be an outlaw polygamous Mormon.  No one who is not one of these will patronize his business. So everyone faces complete financial ruin on a daily basis too.Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is his original wife.  This means all of her children are legitimate but she has two other houses attached to her house with two other wives and their children.  This is not what she signed on for and she has lost her entire family of mother, sister and sister's children as a result of her husband's outlaw election. Nicki (Chlo Sevigny), and Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) are the other two wives.  Their children are illegitimate and can not be seen in public with their father as it would blow their cover.In this third season, Bill, incredibly enough, starts dating a fourth woman whom he wants to make his fourth wife.  Bill doesn't believe in affairs or pre-marital sex.  No, it is marriage or nothing for him.  This fourth recruitment of a wife particularly infuriated me and I was grousing at the set, ""Why can't you go out and have an affair like a normal person?""This ""moralist"" also is trying to get in on the casino gambling business and out of his other consumer products business. Reason?  No one in the gambling business cares how he leads his life and if they discover his lifestyle, nothing bad will happen financially.This is another series, like WEEDS, which I would love to grade down.  However, if I have watched three full seasons, got so engrossed that I felt like throwing something through the tv set, then I suspect I must be enjoying it.  HBO has done it to me again, I'm afraid, hooked me in for the duration with these outlaw Mormons.",4,These Characters Can Be Infuriating--the Lure of the Outlaw Mormons,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,3402,"['are', 'outlaw', 'Mormons', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'seen', 'enough', 'episodes', 'BIG', 'LOVE', 'erroneously', 'thought', 'Mormons', 'living', 'lawfully', 'one', 'husband', 'wife', 'only', 'are', 'tolerant', 'polygamous', 'Mormons', 'No', 'lawful', 'Mormons', 'are', 'first', 'turn', 'outlaws', 'authorities', 'shun', 'upon', 'discovery', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'outlaw', 'Mormons', 'view', 'polygamous', 'lifestyles', 'part', 'religious', 'hereafter', 'planning', 'plan', 'being', 'reunited', 'hereafter', 'being', 'together', 'large', 'family', 'have', 'built', 'together', 'why', 'being', 'fruitful', 'multiplying', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'important.I', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'season', 'even', 'find', 'characters', 'infuriating', 'Most', 'infuriating', 'effect', 'lifestyle', 'children', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'when', 'become', 'teens', 'decisions', 'want', 'make', 'own', 'futures', 'lifestyles', 'are', 'stomped', 'have', 'follow', 'polygamous', 'footsteps', 'Talk', 'being', 'straight', 'jacket', 'life', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'businessman', 'Bill', 'Henrickson', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'polygamist', 'chief', 'usually', 'absolute', 'bats', 'Servicing', 'guy', 'sense', 'word', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'other', 'character', 'One', 'must', 'be', 'huge', 'egomaniac', 'occupy', 'position', 'Anything', 'less', 'having', 'full', 'egomania', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'find', 'insufferable', 'When', 'am', 'hurl', 'something', 'tv', 'screen', 'head', 'do', 'remember', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'outlaw', 'Mormon', 'compound', 'guru', 'head', 'totally', 'insane', 'parents', 'Compared', 'model', 'decorum', 'placid', 'lifestyle', 'entire', 'business', 'will', 'collapse', 'discovered', 'be', 'outlaw', 'polygamous', 'Mormon', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'patronize', 'business', 'So', 'everyone', 'complete', 'financial', 'ruin', 'daily', 'basis', 'too.Barb', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'original', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'legitimate', 'two', 'other', 'houses', 'attached', 'house', 'two', 'other', 'wives', 'children', 'not', 'what', 'signed', 'lost', 'entire', 'family', 'mother', 'sister', 'sister', 'children', 'result', 'husband', 'outlaw', 'election', 'Nicki', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'Margene', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'are', 'other', 'two', 'wives', 'children', 'are', 'illegitimate', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'public', 'father', 'would', 'blow', 'cover.In', 'third', 'season', 'Bill', 'incredibly', 'enough', 'dating', 'fourth', 'woman', 'whom', 'make', 'fourth', 'wife', 'Bill', ""n't"", 'believe', 'affairs', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'No', 'marriage', 'nothing', 'fourth', 'recruitment', 'wife', 'particularly', 'infuriated', 'was', 'grousing', 'set', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'have', 'affair', 'normal', 'person', 'moralist', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'casino', 'gambling', 'business', 'other', 'consumer', 'products', 'business', 'Reason', 'one', 'gambling', 'business', 'how', 'life', 'discover', 'lifestyle', 'nothing', 'bad', 'will', 'happen', 'financially.This', 'series', 'WEEDS', 'would', 'love', 'grade', 'down', 'However', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'full', 'seasons', 'got', 'so', 'engrossed', 'felt', 'throwing', 'something', 'tv', 'set', 'then', 'suspect', 'must', 'be', 'enjoying', 'HBO', 'done', 'again', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'hooked', 'duration', 'outlaw', 'Mormons']",Big Love: Season 3

The three wives and all their assorted children live in side by side homes with connected backyards, all ""married"" to Bill a successful businesman.  We also spend time with the less monied, totally secluded compound dwellers led by Roman Grant the reigning prophet of the church (and also the father of Nikki, one of Bill's three wives.  Oh, did I tell you that Bill and Roman are arch enemies?). It's interesting to see the Hendricksons, the compound dwellers and mainstream Mormons all holding pieces of the truth and sharing a history yet are so different.  Or are they?This show presents so many moral, ethical, religious and legal questions and it's quite entertaining as well as being thought provoking. Before this show, I thought all polygamists were Elizabeth Smart snatching sickos, 16 year old girls who are on their 4th child married to a 50 year old man with 10 other wives, or Warren Jeff power hungry nut jobs who destroy the lives of so many.Yes, this show is a soap opera but it's so much more with well written dialogue and yes, humor.

1132797,AY12DBB0U420B,B0011UMC72,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","My wife and I watched the complete Seasons One and Two of ""Big Love."" It was my wife's idea, and we enjoyed it very much. When Season 3 became available, we picked it up and we're now through with the last episode.The first two seasons sort of acted as an introduction. It took a while to get used to plural marriage and all the interactions between the characters and the cultural setting involved. But the episodes seemed positive, almost bubbly, and it was interesting and amusing visiting the antics of this strangely constructed family and all the interacting people about them.Season 3 took a turn toward the darker side. Everything seemed to start to fall apart and unravel in one way or another. The church, the family, the relatives, friends, the legal system and the business dealings all started to go wrong, sometimes very wrong. Everyone seemed to be unhappy for one reason or another. The teenage children started to have teenage problems. The wives started to have doubts, and one even started dating. A failed attempt was made to add another wife to the group. The relatives went through endless bickering. The church and the legal system became ominous. Now, don't think I'm complaining! I'd say, and my wife agrees, the third season was much more interesting than the first two. This plural marriage and strangely mixed family actually became much more real. The acting was excellent. The Utah setting was wonderful. The problems were heartfelt. Many of the problems seemed much like those of conventional families, but magnified in scope because of the complexity of the mixture. One episode had the entire family going on a journey to their religious roots in a several-thousand-miles auto trip in three cars, no less. It was hilariously funny, but quite touching.We would judge Season 3 to be much better than the previous 2, and we hope this series keeps going. My wife and I enjoyed it as a type of story at first, and a peek at a strange other world, but it gradually turned into a dark comedy and there was not a night when we didn't get some good laughs. Does everyone react that way? We doubt it. I suppose everyone interprets it in their own way.

The show no longer relies on the taboos of polygamy (e.g. sex with a different woman every night), but really focuses on characters and the emotional complexity of the characters involved with such a marriage.  Season 3 also finds some pay offs for loyal viewers.  Certain storylines and hints that were placed as long ago as season 1 begin to reveal themselves.  The show also chooses to find a number of surprise character moves, and plot twists that really keep you glued to the television set. Beyond the rise in plot, the acting advanced as well.  While there was depth to the characters before, we get to see characters take on a number of different issues, including stories from the past, come to fruition, which the actors show in wonderful performances.Needless to say this was an impressive season.

The first season was great, although it  just didn't quite make it to the level of 5 stars for me.  Might have just been that I was having trouble wrapping my head around the subject matter.  I had a certain culturally ingrained bias against polygamy and by extension, anyone who engages in that lifestyle.  Also - I was a little bit shocked by some of the sexual depictions.  I'm of a certain age and (my husband tells me) a little bit prudish.  The second season was still very engaging, but it felt less focused to me, as if the story lines were spinning out of control a little.  Still, having said all that - I was really looking forward to watching one or two episodes each night.This third season, though, is the best of all so far.  The characters are even more sharply defined, and they are growing and deepening with every episode. The women are maturing and beginning to question the paternalistic hierarchy in their family and in their society at large.  They're stirring the waters, so husband Bill is having to re-examine some of his own beliefs, too. The stakes for each situation are so high that I long ago gave up trying to think of this as a ""slice of life"" drama. So instead I'm diving in to a ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  In other words - I've stopped comparing it to any reality that I have personally experienced or even witnessed.  I simply accept at face value that this family lives in a very different world than I do. But (and this is important) their relationships, their pain and their joy is completely familiar and rings very true.  And as I have said in my two previous reviews, watching this series has made me reconsider some of my own beliefs and prejudices while still keeping me engaged and entertained.  And I must mention -  there is humor here, too! -- woven into all the drama and heartache.What more can you ask?",5,Just an amazing series!,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,1992,"['husband', 'have', 'been', 'binge', 'watching', 'Big', 'Love', 'now', 'few', 'weeks', 'have', 'finally', 'bumped', 'five', 'stars', 'four', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'level', '5', 'stars', 'Might', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'wrapping', 'head', 'subject', 'matter', 'had', 'certain', 'culturally', 'ingrained', 'bias', 'polygamy', 'extension', 'anyone', 'who', 'lifestyle', 'Also', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'shocked', 'sexual', 'depictions', ""'m"", 'certain', 'age', 'husband', 'tells', 'little', 'bit', 'prudish', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'engaging', 'felt', 'less', 'focused', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'spinning', 'control', 'little', 'Still', 'having', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'night.This', 'third', 'season', 'though', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'sharply', 'defined', 'are', 'growing', 'deepening', 'episode', 'women', 'are', 'maturing', 'beginning', 'question', 'paternalistic', 'hierarchy', 'family', 'society', 'large', ""'re"", 'stirring', 'waters', 'so', 'husband', 'Bill', 'having', 're-examine', 'own', 'beliefs', 'too', 'stakes', 'situation', 'are', 'so', 'high', 'long', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', 'trying', 'think', 'slice', 'life', 'drama', 'instead', ""'m"", 'diving', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'comparing', 'reality', 'have', 'personally', 'experienced', 'even', 'witnessed', 'simply', 'accept', 'face', 'value', 'family', 'very', 'different', 'world', 'do', 'important', 'relationships', 'pain', 'joy', 'completely', 'familiar', 'rings', 'very', 'true', 'have', 'said', 'two', 'previous', 'reviews', 'watching', 'series', 'made', 'reconsider', 'own', 'beliefs', 'prejudices', 'still', 'keeping', 'engaged', 'entertained', 'must', 'mention', 'humor', 'here', 'too', 'woven', 'drama', 'heartache.What', 'more', 'can', 'ask']",Big Love: Season 3

Smith,"[0, 1]","This series is a humorous and serious look at the lives and stresses of modern polygamists, both those who live in enclaves and those trying to blend into society. I would rate the story highly but for a few really glaring problems. First, the series blurs the distinction between the mainstream LDS (Mormon) Church and the various offshoots which still practice polygamy. The series seems to mock the LDS Church by making its missionaries and members portrayed in the series seem either good-natured fools, or overbearing authoritarians, neither of which is the case. The series also takes inappropriate liberties with sacred LDS ordinances such as those occurring in the Mormon Temples by revealing them in minute detail unnecessary to the story line of the series, which could only be taken as a jab at the church and its members. Otherwise the series raises good questions about a life of polygamy in several different formats, and addresses some of those negative aspects of the polygamist enclaves.Its too bad the writers obviously had an anti-LDS bias, and I am ashamed of Tom Hanks for sponsoring that kind of intolerance.",2,Good Potential but the Anti-Mormon Bias Ruins the Result.,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1130,"['series', 'humorous', 'serious', 'look', 'lives', 'stresses', 'modern', 'polygamists', 'who', 'live', 'enclaves', 'trying', 'blend', 'society', 'would', 'rate', 'story', 'highly', 'few', 'really', 'glaring', 'problems', 'First', 'series', 'distinction', 'mainstream', 'LDS', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'various', 'offshoots', 'still', 'practice', 'polygamy', 'series', 'mock', 'LDS', 'Church', 'making', 'missionaries', 'members', 'portrayed', 'series', 'seem', 'good-natured', 'fools', 'overbearing', 'authoritarians', 'case', 'series', 'also', 'inappropriate', 'liberties', 'sacred', 'LDS', 'ordinances', 'such', 'occurring', 'Mormon', 'Temples', 'revealing', 'minute', 'detail', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'line', 'series', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'jab', 'church', 'members', 'Otherwise', 'series', 'good', 'questions', 'life', 'polygamy', 'several', 'different', 'formats', 'negative', 'aspects', 'polygamist', 'enclaves.Its', 'too', 'bad', 'writers', 'obviously', 'had', 'anti-LDS', 'bias', 'am', 'ashamed', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'sponsoring', 'kind', 'intolerance']",Big Love: Season 3
1132808,A2RAU617VTJMBX,B0011UMC72,Sigrid Macdonald,"[3, 4]","When I first started watching the show, I found it to be a bit confusing.  There were so many characters and the concept seemed so far-fetched that I almost abandoned it after the first episode.  There were two reasons why I didn't.  One, it was produced by Tom Hanks.  Two, he stated very clearly in the first episode that somewhere between 20,000 to 40,000 people in the United States practiced polygamy.  Holy Mama!  I know there are also sects in Canada where I live, and the topic is certainly intriguing.  So I continued to watch and I'm so glad that I did.Big Love traces the life of one man, Bill, who was kicked out of Juniper Creek, a polygamist cult, at a young age so that he did not serve as competition for the older men.  Bill proceeded to establish a fairly ""normal"" life for himself in the community with a wife and several children.  But then he was forced to take on another wife, and suddenly he found himself living a polygamist lifestyle outside of the compound, where it could present all kinds of complicated problems.  First, he and his family, who are trying to live by the ""principle,"" are forced into becoming constant liars.  Second, his wives live in the modern world and consequently, they talk back to him, unlike the more subservient women at the compound.  Third, his children are growing up in mainstream schools.  They have friends and they date.  They are torn about their feelings for their parents and the lifestyle.This is a show that I think about after I flick off the TV, which is rare, because it poses so many interesting ethical issues.  How far should people be allowed to go to practice their religion when it conflicts with social norms and the law?  Does polygamy always exploit women, and child brides, or is there a downside for men too?How long can people lie to others without feeling like hypocrites or have a knot inside their stomach like a cancer?  How many of us can relate in our own way in terms of being or doing something different -- many gays still need to hide their lifestyle.  Those who have affairs do the same.  How well do we know our neighbors?  These are great questions and if it sounds as though the show is just sociologically fascinating, it's not true.

1132812,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0011UMC72,Z Hayes,"[8, 8]","I've been a long-time fan of Big Love, and can't help but be addicted to this story about a polygamist, successful Mormon businessman Bill Henrickson (played credibly by Bill Paxton), and his three wives - Barb (Jeanne Triplehorn) the first wife who was initially (during her battle with cancer)persuaded by husband Bill to embrace ""The Principle"" which basically embraces the concept of polygamy. Through Seasons 1-2, we see Barb struggle with the consequences of living The Principle as reflected in the conflicts between her and her two other sister wives (as the co-wives are called) and also the impact it has on her own relationship not just with Bill and their children, but also Barb's family. Then there's second wife Nicolette (Chloe Sevigny) who is the daughter of Roman Grant, the patriarch and Prophet of Juniper Creek, a Mormon settlement and whose followers all embrace The Principle. Nicki's character is often portrayed as ultra religious and rather extreme in her views, though she is not without flaws - for one, she is a spendthrift and her battles with shopping addiction was well-chronicled in the earlier seasons. The main reason for Nicki's joining Bill's family was initially to provide a mother figure for Bill and Barb's children in case Barb should die. Finally, the third wife is Margene, the new convert to The Principle, and also the youngest amongst the wives. Over the seasons, we see Margene maturing into her role as the third sister wife and no longer as naive as she was in the first season.As Season Three begins, there is plenty of drama to keep long-time fans entertained and to intrigue new fans (though this series does need to be watched from the First Season in order to truly understand all the dynamics of the relationships and the convoluted story arcs). In the first half of this season, the two main story arcs are the trial of Roman Grant as well as Ana (the prospective fourth sister wife). Ana (played by Branka Katic) is a Serbian waitress (with a credible accent to boot) who is being wooed by Bill. Ana is attractive but far from submissive, demonstrating an independent and inquiring mind, and more importantly a strong will that may prove incompatible with Bill and his three wives. So the wives get to know Ana, a collective undertaking initiated by Barb. This first half of the season also sees Bill trying his hardest to get his casino business off the ground. The rest of the third season sees the repercussions of this relationship between Bill and Ana, as well as what happens as a result of Roman's trial. Bill and his family face some serious issues - those of faith, problems faced by Bill's offspring especially daughter Sarah (the brilliant Amanda Seyfried, recently seen in ""Jennifer's Body""), and other shenanigans within the family.The various story arcs are well-plotted, and the ensemble cast does a credible job in making these characters seem like very real people facing life problems - only thing is, the problems are not always the conventional sort which is to be expected given the premise of the series which deals with the issues of plural marriage. The ending of Season 3 was quite satisfactory for me - there's enough left unresolved that I look forward to Season 4 (which is premiering soon on HBO), but there's also enough resolution for some story arcs that one is not left completely hanging.DVD features - well, the aspect ratio is 16:9, there is the option of Spanish, French, English subtitles (and also English closed captioning). There is a total of 10 episodes on 4 discs (each in its own plastic case, the slim version). The picture and audio quality are above average in my opinion, very clear audio and crisp and well-defined picture. The extras are found on Disc 1 - the usual trailer for HBO programming, ""Their Stories So Far"" where Bill and the three sister wives speak to the camera, addressing who they are etc, ""Three Past Midnight"" which consist of 3 enactments involving the main characters. Final verdict - a highly entertaining, original, and engrossing show - a must-have for fans!",5,A stellar third season of Big Love!,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,4090,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'long-time', 'fan', 'Big', 'Love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'addicted', 'story', 'polygamist', 'successful', 'Mormon', 'businessman', 'Bill', 'Henrickson', 'played', 'credibly', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'three', 'wives', 'Barb', 'Jeanne', 'Triplehorn', 'first', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'battle', 'cancer', 'persuaded', 'husband', 'Bill', 'embrace', 'Principle', 'basically', 'concept', 'polygamy', 'Seasons', '1-2', 'see', 'Barb', 'struggle', 'consequences', 'living', 'Principle', 'reflected', 'conflicts', 'two', 'other', 'sister', 'wives', 'co-wives', 'are', 'called', 'also', 'impact', 'own', 'relationship', 'not', 'just', 'Bill', 'children', 'also', 'Barb', 'family', 'Then', 'second', 'wife', 'Nicolette', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'who', 'daughter', 'Roman', 'Grant', 'patriarch', 'Prophet', 'Juniper', 'Creek', 'Mormon', 'settlement', 'followers', 'embrace', 'Principle', 'Nicki', 'character', 'often', 'portrayed', 'ultra', 'religious', 'rather', 'extreme', 'views', 'not', 'flaws', 'one', 'spendthrift', 'battles', 'shopping', 'addiction', 'was', 'well-chronicled', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'main', 'reason', 'Nicki', 'joining', 'Bill', 'family', 'was', 'initially', 'provide', 'mother', 'figure', 'Bill', 'Barb', 'children', 'case', 'Barb', 'should', 'die', 'Finally', 'third', 'wife', 'Margene', 'new', 'convert', 'Principle', 'also', 'youngest', 'wives', 'seasons', 'see', 'Margene', 'maturing', 'role', 'third', 'sister', 'wife', 'no', 'longer', 'as', 'naive', 'was', 'first', 'season.As', 'Season', 'Three', 'plenty', 'drama', 'keep', 'long-time', 'fans', 'entertained', 'intrigue', 'new', 'fans', 'series', 'need', 'be', 'watched', 'First', 'Season', 'order', 'truly', 'understand', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'convoluted', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'two', 'main', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'trial', 'Roman', 'Grant', 'as', 'well', 'Ana', 'prospective', 'fourth', 'sister', 'wife', 'Ana', 'played', 'Branka', 'Katic', 'Serbian', 'waitress', 'credible', 'accent', 'boot', 'who', 'being', 'wooed', 'Bill', 'Ana', 'attractive', 'far', 'submissive', 'demonstrating', 'independent', 'inquiring', 'mind', 'more', 'importantly', 'strong', 'will', 'may', 'prove', 'incompatible', 'Bill', 'three', 'wives', 'wives', 'get', 'know', 'Ana', 'collective', 'undertaking', 'initiated', 'Barb', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'also', 'Bill', 'trying', 'hardest', 'get', 'casino', 'business', 'ground', 'rest', 'third', 'season', 'repercussions', 'relationship', 'Bill', 'Ana', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'result', 'Roman', 'trial', 'Bill', 'family', 'face', 'serious', 'issues', 'faith', 'problems', 'faced', 'Bill', 'offspring', 'especially', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'brilliant', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'recently', 'seen', 'Jennifer', 'Body', 'other', 'shenanigans', 'family.The', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'well-plotted', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'credible', 'job', 'making', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'facing', 'life', 'problems', 'only', 'thing', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'conventional', 'sort', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'premise', 'series', 'issues', 'plural', 'marriage', 'ending', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfactory', 'enough', 'left', 'unresolved', 'look', 'forward', 'Season', '4', 'premiering', 'soon', 'HBO', 'also', 'enough', 'resolution', 'story', 'arcs', 'one', 'not', 'left', 'completely', 'hanging.DVD', 'features', 'well', 'aspect', 'ratio', '16:9', 'option', 'Spanish', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'also', 'English', 'closed', 'captioning', 'total', '10', 'episodes', '4', 'discs', 'own', 'plastic', 'case', 'slim', 'version', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'opinion', 'very', 'clear', 'audio', 'crisp', 'well-defined', 'picture', 'extras', 'are', 'found', 'Disc', '1', 'usual', 'trailer', 'HBO', 'programming', 'Stories', 'So', 'Far', 'where', 'Bill', 'three', 'sister', 'wives', 'speak', 'camera', 'addressing', 'who', 'are', 'etc', 'Three', 'Past', 'Midnight', 'consist', '3', 'enactments', 'involving', 'main', 'characters', 'Final', 'verdict', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'original', 'engrossing', 'show', 'must-have', 'fans']",Big Love: Season 3
