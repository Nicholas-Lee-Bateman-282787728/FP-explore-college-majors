He loves Thomas and I thought he'd like this video. I had read that purist Thomas fans didn't care for it, but since we don't have any of the regular videos, I figured it would be okay. What I didn't realize is that there are relatively few scenes of the trains in this video, and my son found the extended dialog between the ""real"" people to be completely uninteresting. He would actually walk away from the TV, he was so bored.As an adult, I found the plot to be overly complicated with too many sub elements. The boy and girl characters appear to have been shoe-horned in for a little human interest, but are tedious to watch. Alec Baldwin provides a perfomance that is so bad, I couldn't look at the screen.

Better child actors would have improved the movie a lot- seems like they didn't rehearse much and their expressions seem a bit wooden.As an adult, I was a little confused at the absence of people on Sodor, but my daughters haven't commented on it.  I wondered where the rest of the little people like Mr. Conductor and Junior have gone- how will they get their gold dust refill?!  And what was Junior thinking, just frittering it away?  How did Lady disappear?  What the heck was Mr. C doing with the ball and bat?

Second I thought Edward should've been in it. Edward was one of the oringinal engines from the first tape and he could've had a small part.

556808,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B00004XPPF,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","First of all, this was one of the first few movies I saw in theaters so I'll always be thankfull for that. I remember enjoying it as a kid, but not getting all of the plot, and I remember enjoying thomas stuff when I was younger. So I thought I'd watch to actually learn the plot this time.Coming away from it, I though it was a good kids movie, has characters and moments that will make them experience most ranges of emotion (humor, sadness, concernm/slightly scared and joy). The plot was fairly easy to follow and does a good job of making things between towns/universes come together. The human characters surprisingly played there roles pretty well at least for the target audience. Yes the film has moments that make me go &#34;OH JUST DO THIS&#34; reguarding certain parts of the film. Also there were several &#34;WHAT?&#34; moments and &#34;Oh yeah because it has to happen&#34; but, I have to remind myself &#34;This movie is not made for your age group.&#34; The resolution was the best I could expect and I'm satisfied most kids will like this.,Now, as a Thomas movie, this really does not work. First of all the voices, James sounds like a woman and a b&#^# (I know he's made out to be one on show,but really give HIM a guy's voice), Percy sounds really pathetic in here and has no self confidence. From what I remmber about the show, we are supposed to be proud of his struggles and overcoming events in the show, here I have zero faith in him. Thomas appears to have lost his smarts in here, and goes through many accidents. REALLY? He's the main engine the one character that has a good perspective on everything, and here he's a mess at times and accomplishes basically nothing except deliver some laughs.While the shout outs to other characters on the show are nice (the bus, Toby, Henrey and Gordon) the fact they are just there to be there for one or two scenes makes it not worth the effort (and you forgot edward). Henrey, Gordon and the Bus could've easilt been left out and Toby could've been replaced by James, which actually makes sense as when Junior finds the bad guy, James appears out of nowhere when Toby was the one actually nearby.Also size comparisions between the universes are inconsistent, the conductors stay the same size in both universes, but the trains get bigger in the real world and other humans shrink in Sodar. That doesn't make sense. Also Mr. Conductor doesn't strike me as a good leader, advisor yes. The bitt of Shineing town becoming more negative hurts the tone of the movie and doesn't ever appear to be fully resolved with a reason. And finally the tone of the movie feels pretty different from other thomas stuff.So ultimatly as a kids movie I think it works just fine, 4/5. As a thomas movie, I feel it sucks 2/5 (it is funny and the main action happens there), so 3/5 is my rating. I do want to rate it better but don't think I can.",3,"Good kids movie, bad Thomas movie (Read other reviews, both high and low)",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2891,"['First', 'all', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'few', 'movies', 'saw', 'theaters', 'so', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'thankfull', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'kid', 'not', 'getting', 'plot', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'thomas', 'stuff', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'thought', ""'d"", 'watch', 'actually', 'learn', 'plot', 'time.Coming', 'away', 'was', 'good', 'kids', 'movie', 'characters', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'experience', 'most', 'ranges', 'emotion', 'humor', 'sadness', 'concernm/slightly', 'scared', 'joy', 'plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'things', 'towns/universes', 'come', 'together', 'human', 'characters', 'surprisingly', 'played', 'roles', 'pretty', 'well', 'least', 'target', 'audience', 'Yes', 'film', 'moments', 'make', 'go', '34', 'OH', 'JUST', 'DO', 'THIS', '34', 'reguarding', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'Also', 'were', 'several', '34', 'WHAT', '34', 'moments', '34', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'happen', '34', 'have', 'remind', '34', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'age', 'group.', '34', 'resolution', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'expect', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'most', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'this.', 'Now', 'Thomas', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'work', 'First', 'voices', 'James', 'woman', 'b', '^', 'know', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'show', 'really', 'give', 'HIM', 'guy', 'voice', 'Percy', 'really', 'pathetic', 'here', 'self', 'confidence', 'what', 'remmber', 'show', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'proud', 'struggles', 'overcoming', 'events', 'show', 'here', 'have', 'zero', 'faith', 'Thomas', 'have', 'lost', 'smarts', 'here', 'many', 'accidents', 'REALLY', 'main', 'engine', 'one', 'character', 'good', 'perspective', 'everything', 'here', 'mess', 'times', 'accomplishes', 'basically', 'nothing', 'deliver', 'shout', 'outs', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'nice', 'bus', 'Toby', 'Henrey', 'Gordon', 'fact', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'be', 'there', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'not', 'effort', 'forgot', 'edward', 'Henrey', 'Gordon', 'Bus', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easilt', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Toby', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'replaced', 'James', 'actually', 'sense', 'when', 'Junior', 'bad', 'guy', 'James', 'nowhere', 'when', 'Toby', 'was', 'one', 'actually', 'nearby.Also', 'size', 'comparisions', 'universes', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'conductors', 'stay', 'same', 'size', 'universes', 'trains', 'get', 'bigger', 'real', 'world', 'other', 'humans', 'shrink', 'Sodar', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Also', 'Mr', 'Conductor', ""n't"", 'strike', 'good', 'leader', 'advisor', 'yes', 'bitt', 'Shineing', 'town', 'becoming', 'more', 'negative', 'tone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'appear', 'be', 'fully', 'resolved', 'reason', 'finally', 'tone', 'movie', 'pretty', 'different', 'other', 'thomas', 'stuff.So', 'ultimatly', 'kids', 'movie', 'think', 'just', 'fine', '4/5', 'thomas', 'movie', 'feel', '2/5', 'funny', 'main', 'action', 'so', '3/5', 'rating', 'do', 'want', 'rate', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can']",Thomas and the Magic Railroad
