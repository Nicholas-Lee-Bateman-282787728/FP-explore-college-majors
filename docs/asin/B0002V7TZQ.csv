I was sceptical about the O.C. at first because I have really enjoyed going to California and the people I have met there and was worried that the show would glamourise the less savoury parts of California life (which it does, but to great effect). I now have become a self-professed addict to the show and try to get my friends addicted as well. I haven't been entirely successful.Watch this show. Get both seasons.

His lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) takes him home to his hesitant but caring wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowen) and neurotic and hilarious son Seth (Adam Brody) to give him a second chance in life.I love The O.C. I watched the first episode and was hooked. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the characters were interesting and the story kept me entertained. Though the season does stumble a few times (particularly with the whole Oliver scenario), it remains amazing through out.Pros:+ Mostly great acting (from Peter Gallagher, Ben McKenzie, Adam Brody, Kelly Rowan, Rachel Bilson, and Melinda Clarke particularly)+ Great dialogue, very witty and funny (Seth is hilarious)+ Mostly good storylines+ Anna Stern (Semair Armstrong, the best guest star so far)+ Completely amazing music (ie The Killers, Death Cab For Cutie, The Faint, Modest Mouse, U2, etc)+ One of the best season finales everCons:- A few lame storylines/guest characters (ie Oliver)- Some bad acting (Mischa Barton)- Goes through stories a little too fast, rarely slows things down before a new problem arisesAside from the few cons The O.C. Season 1 is quality TV. Definitely pick it up. One Tree Hill pales in comparison.PS. About 10 of the 1-star reviews were written by the same person.

Andico,"[13, 16]","This is definitely a show I had no doubt a DVD release is well-deserved and anticipated.An entertainment magazine quoted The O.C. as ""Dawson's Creek meets Hollywood Wives"". In a way this is true, but I believe there's more to it than that. It appeals to almost everyone...The O.C. is a story about the lives of the rich and the not so rich in the Orange County (hence the title). It focuses on the lives of three teenagers who are coming of age and it delves on how each approach every adventures or misadventures they come upon usually together as friends. To some this might sound cliche and unoriginal but there's a reason why it's one of if not the hottest TV series at present.It appeals to most, especially the teen populace, which I think makes up a big bulk of the show's fan following, because of relateability to the key characters Ryan, Seth, and Marissa. While it may have some similarity to Dawson's Creek (which I'm not familiar with since I never watched any episode of Dawson's Creek), it is unique in a sense that the characters' backgrounds are based on this place for the rich and famous and how they react to changes in their lives. It also appeals to the grown ups, mainly the mothers, because of it's being a pseudo telenovela or soap. But to the general public, it's a TV program worth watching.Good and timely stories. Great soundtrack. The Cast are great and they made their characters believably human and not two-dimensional. All in all, it's a labor of love that really paid off.To those who haven't watched The O.C. before, here's your chance to see what all the fuss is all about and to enjoy it the same way as most people did.",5,Just the right series for all age groups...,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1658,"['definitely', 'show', 'had', 'doubt', 'DVD', 'release', 'well-deserved', 'anticipated.An', 'entertainment', 'magazine', 'quoted', 'O.C', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'meets', 'Hollywood', 'Wives', 'way', 'true', 'believe', 'more', 'appeals', 'almost', 'everyone', 'O.C', 'story', 'lives', 'rich', 'not', 'so', 'rich', 'Orange', 'County', 'hence', 'title', 'lives', 'three', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'age', 'how', 'approach', 'come', 'usually', 'together', 'friends', 'might', 'sound', 'cliche', 'unoriginal', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'not', 'hottest', 'TV', 'series', 'present.It', 'appeals', 'most', 'especially', 'teen', 'populace', 'think', 'up', 'big', 'bulk', 'show', 'fan', 'following', 'relateability', 'key', 'characters', 'Ryan', 'Seth', 'Marissa', 'may', 'have', 'similarity', 'Dawson', 'Creek', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'unique', 'sense', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'based', 'place', 'rich', 'famous', 'how', 'react', 'changes', 'lives', 'also', 'appeals', 'grown', 'ups', 'mainly', 'mothers', 'being', 'pseudo', 'telenovela', 'soap', 'general', 'public', 'TV', 'program', 'worth', 'watching.Good', 'timely', 'stories', 'Great', 'soundtrack', 'Cast', 'are', 'great', 'made', 'characters', 'believably', 'human', 'not', 'two-dimensional', 'labor', 'love', 'really', 'paid', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'O.C', 'here', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'enjoy', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'did']",The O.C.: Season 1
846186,A2G7E3A0YN6XLV,B0002V7TZQ,Blake L.,"[3, 3]","I'll admit, when a friend first told me about The O.C., I was very skeptical. To me, it sounded like a basic soap opera except in the primetime slot. And I was exactly right.As I began to watch the show, I noticed it was a soap opera type program. I realized that I was a guy, and guys don't watch soap operas. But now, I take that back. Yes, this show can be linked as a type of soap opera, but what The O.C. is can't be compared to anything else I've viewed on television before. It is a program that is simply addicting once you watch it. The characters, the drama, the events, the twists, etc. make this show the best show on television in my opinion.Creator, Josh Schwartz has did a magnificant job creating a story that is compelling and filled with drama. The characters are believable, which is the most important aspect in a program. The setting for this series, in Newport Beach, California is probably one of the most beautiful places out there. The O.C. captures the beauty of Newport, as well as some things that go on that make it seem like it's not the perfect place.The main character, Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie), is from Chino. Chino does not have any comparison whatsoever to Newport except that they are in the same state. Ryan survives an arrest and seeks the help of his lawyer, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher). When Sandy invites Ryan into his home, the family realizes that things will not be the same in this town again. But, Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) finds a liking to Ryan, and sees him as a brother he never had. Throughout the season, the bond between Ryan and Seth grows into basically a true friendship. Ryan immediately catches the eye of the girl next door, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and the tension builds throughout the season between the two which sends the viewers for a magnificant dramatic ride.What makes this show amazing is the basic concepts that we as human beings can relate to. When watching the show, you'll be saying ""Hey, that has happened to me before!"" over and over again. Now, it's possible you might not have experienced as much chaos as these families go through, but can relate nonetheless. All in all, this show is aimed at teens, but adults can love it as well. Any fan of dramatic television will love The O.C. .

846190,A35NFVV9QLIPOB,B0002V7TZQ,carnage,"[4, 42]","It's not pleasant to hear, but it's very important, and it's part of telling the truth. Although not without overlap and simplification, I plan to identify three primary positions on The OC's endeavors. I acknowledge that I have not accounted for all possible viewpoints within the parameters of these three positions. Nevertheless, The OC's ploys are not witty satire, as it would have you believe. They're simply the logorrheic ramblings of something that has no idea or appreciation of what it's mocking.I'm not writing this review for your entertainment. I'm not even writing it for your education. I'm writing it for our very survival. The OC intends to create a new social class. Obdurate, self-absorbed boneheads, incontinent, crass paper-pushers, and feckless, balmy pop psychologists will be given aristocratic status. The rest of us will be forced into serving as their janissaries.It is more than a purely historical question to ask, ""How did The OC's reign of terror start?"" or even the more urgent question, ""How might it end?"". No, we must ask, ""Is it really The OC's impression that pharisaism is the key to world peace?"" To rephrase that question, how can something that claims to be so educated and so open-minded dare to fund a vast web of brainless, antihumanist fomenters of revolution, fickle soulless-types, and juvenile blusterers? There aren't enough hours in the day to fully answer that question, but consider this: For those of us who make our living trying to fight to the end for our ideas and ideals, it is important to consider that its crude bruta fulmina brainwash the masses into submission. The OC then blames us for that. Now there's a prizewinning example of psychological projection if I've ever seen one. The OC's self-fulfilling prophecies are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, the last time I told The OC's patsies that I want to burn away social illness, exploitation, and human suffering, they declared in response, ""But honor counts for nothing."" Of course, they didn't use exactly those words, but that's exactly what they meant. I have seen and heard enough.

846191,A30FVTT1PZTVGE,B0002V7TZQ,"Carrie B. ""Carrie""","[2, 5]","I haven't yet purchased any O.C. item available quite yet. But just take this review into your mind. I never was a big OC fan until my brother decided it's time I started watching more shows and not just Gilmore Girls. I then watched one of the episodes airing upon FOX television, I watched it and I was sad to see that episode end. Afterwards I thanked my brother for deciding to tape me The OC and I suggested to set the next two episodes to tape upon our DVR. Thankfully, the next two episodes taped. Unluckily, my sister deleted it away from our DVR, and without getting any pleasure out of seeing the episode. However, another thankful moment occured, by the fact that she only deleted the first episode and not the other one. I watched that one in awe hoping to find something much more interesting in this episode, which I did. I found another interaction with Seth and Summer (love them two together.) the spider-man comment was just adorable and random, and at first, I didn't quite understand why Summer was so angry at Seth, what ever did he do wrong? I then figured out during that episode, they used to be a couple as well, but Seth backed out on the relationship, sadly.I then continued watching this episode as Marissa discovers her best friend turns into her girlfriend, indulging through a relationship, tells her mother, decides to move away from home and live with her girlfriend, then realizes that this may be a mistake, left outside in the rain with her ex-boyfriend, Ryan.Now, surprisingly, I laughed and was in shock as Mischa Barton played a lesbian, well, bisexual, as I've known her from television, and my sister's short obsession.Moving on, I then watched Ryan go through the blood test with his  new girlfriend, and how she discovers who her true father is. That was another great part during this episode.Now, I realize this episode may or may not be in the 1st or 2nd season, however, it made me realize this is a teen soap that certainly never gets boring. It's always amusing.Now, I may skip forward onto the grand finale, THE KISS. Summer and Seth were meant to be. No doubt about that. But when Summer finally realized that, they all played a Spider-Man move. As Summer ran through the storm into Seth's house, calling out his name, as then she discovers Seth is asking for help as he's hanging off of the roof of his house, Summer comes running outside as Seth asked what she is doing here. Summer smerks and answers, ""Why else?"", she softly pulled down the Spider-Man mask off til his lips exposed, it's then she kissed his lips. I couldn't have asked for a better ending for that episode.I think that this DVD will give us more and more pleasure during every episode. I certainly will buy every DVD after I purchase the last two Gilmore Girls DVD.I was just giving you guys an example of a few episodes, I hope you'll all enjoy this DVD as much as I know I will.Purchase it as soon as possible.

It is very well written, the story is not only very entertaining but at times also very poignant. And it has a very real quality to it: it captures late teenage relationships and school life very well.My favorites in the show are Summer and Seth. Seth Cohen is one hilarious character! The actor that plays him is exceptional. And the cahrachetr of Summer is also outstanding. Although I like the whole cast, these two really stand out and are, in my opinion, what makes the show stand out as an original.The adults in the series are also very good. I love the wicked and beautiful Mrs Cooper: this character is so dark, OTT and camp. She is a hoot! And I also love the Kirsten and Sandy Cohen husband and wife team: what a great couple. Sandy Cohen in particular is a great male character, full of warmth, integrity and humor. In fact most of the characters in this show are very interesting and exceptionally well drawn out. I really enjoyed this show.

After getting violently thrown out of his own house, he only has one person to turn to; his DA lawyer, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher).  And thus, he is brought into the lives of the rich and snobby folks of Newport Beach.With this, what kind of a show would you expect?  Typical bad seed troubled boy come to cause tumult among the citizens of a rich town?  NOT!Starring the incredible Benjamin McKenzie in the role of Ryan, follow along many tribes and tribulations dealing with many problems on the inside of an outwardly rich community, such as embezzlement, alcoholism, depression, divorce, greed, theft, pregnancy, and overdose.  And then there are happier themes too, involving love, sex, and success, and it's a healthy bunch of it.  The year isn't surrounded by catastrophe, nor is it some kind of unrealistic rich utopia.It's 27 episodes long...  But you'll wish it was longer.  Pick up the box set to The O.C., especially if you're fans of Dawson's Creek, or even the Gilmore Girls, involving the sappy love stories of DC, and the humor of GG.  This set is worth every penny spent on it.  I hate to say it, but some of you may become an unwilling fan of sappy teen drama...  But VERY GOOD sappy teen drama.",5,Dawson...

Yes, this show's teen characters are involved in a thick plot, but the adult scene is just as scandalous and interesting!  This is not one of those shows like 90210 or any other teen soap opera.  There is plenty of enjoyment waiting for any viewer, regardless of age!This show is centered around a few families in Newport Beach, California (in Orange County).  The primary families are the Cohens, the Coopers, and the Roberts.Sandy Cohen is a very successful attorney with the Public Defender's Office, and his wife Kirsten is a top-level executive in her father's multi-billion dollar real estate corporation The Newport Group.  Their son Seth starts off as basically an outcast at very his prestigous college preparatory school, but that changes quickly!Jimmy Cooper is a financial advisor with a few financial problems of his own, and his wife Julie is a self-centered gold-digger.  Their daughter Marissa is a popular and bright student who attends school with Seth.The Robert's family does not really develop aside from the single daughter, Summer, until the second season.  Summer is popular like Marissa, and they both are spoiled Orange County girls.  Don't be fooled, though, this all changes not so far into the first season.From premier to finale, The O.C. is, surprisingly, an extreme emotional roller coaster ride with the occasional tear jerker climaxes.  Don't be fooled like I was and dismiss this as something that wouldn't interest you.  Give it a shot!  Be warned, though, this show can be very addictive.  If you're thinking about starting to watch this show on Fox, I would suggest buying the first two seasons on DVD before watching the current season.  I would definitely suggest buying the first two seasons together simply because of the extreme cliffhanger presented on the first season's finale.

846203,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B0002V7TZQ,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[3, 3]","This series appeared in my video store and I got hooked after Volume I.  Somewhere along the way, the experience was like eating ice cream...addictive and pleasurable, but ultimately a sugar high.O.C. is, alas, limited by the restrictions of network TV. In one Special Feature, the producers explain that they can't even let the kids smoke.  Meanwhile the ghost of Tony Soprano hovers over each episode.  I keep comparing O.C. to non-network shows like Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Dead Like Me, and Sex and the City.You know you're on network TV because everybody's NICE.  Just about every episode includes (a) at least one heart-felt apology and (b) at least one encounter beginning, ""We need to talk.""  Do teenage boys really talk about feelings?  Does anybody?  In six seasons of Sex and the City, did anyone ever say Let's Talk?  Did we feel something was missing?The series opens with a strong premise.  Good kid ""Ryan Atwood"" gets rescued from tough circumstances. Who wouldn't want to rescue Ben Mackenzie? He's adorable -- that quirky smile and The Look.But for a certified Bad Boy, he doesn't have enough rough edges.  He gets one lesson in tie-tying and now he's a socialite! He speaks smoothly and apologizes for saying words that are allowed on network television.  Okay, he hits people when he gets mad, but so does his nemesis, Luke, a certified Rich Kid.  So does a grown man who just lost his life savings.Ryan faces the classic teenage rivalry -- fighting for his girl against Luke, athletic champ and bully (except in Newport, the tough-guy sport is -- water polo? gimme a break).  Ryan soon discovers a big secret that's almost too appropriate to Luke and his father.  Ah, some edge! Alas, Luke soon joins forces with Ryan to help Marissa and becomes another teddy bear.Kirsten's sister has potential as an edgy character, almost too reminiscent of Janice in The Sopranos and Ruth Fisher's sister in Six Feet Under.  When the boys discover she's working as a stripper (after telling everyone she's got a ""normal"" job teaching yoga for Club Med) -- well, Tony Soprano and the Fishers would say, ""Good for her!""  Here, she's ""rescued.""Meanwhile, the high school kids (who look and act more like twenty-somethings) are left alone to deal with crises that would baffle many over-35 adults.The Cohens invite Ryan, ""Come to us when you're in trouble.""  But on Thanksgiving Day, Ryan announces plans to visit his big brother in a maximum security prison. ""Do you want us to go with you?"" the Cohen parents ask politely.Um...you're letting a troubled high school junior visit an inmate in a max security prison - and you don't insist on going along? And you wonder why Ryan feels he has to fight his own battles?Meanwhile, Seth lies about visiting Mexico and claims the car got vandalized in a movie parking lot.  The only parental expression comes from the mom Kirsten who promises they'll have to Talk.This IS Southern California: isn't everyone supposed to have a therapist on call?  Ryan gets dumped into his new world, after only a short test by the formidable ""Dr. Kim,"" who seems to be the only official at this posh school (and a rather unethical official at that).The day after the teens witness an attempted suicide by gunshot, they're sent back to school as if nothing happened.  Even Claire Fisher (from Six Feet Under) got sent to a school counselor in her public school. Only Marissa sees a shrink - way overdue! - and she balks.  Wouldn't half the school be in therapy and proud of it - not to mention the Ladies at the Club?Some scenes are so unrealistic it's like watching snow In July in South Florida.  In one episode, Kirsten burns toast, setting off a clanging bell.  Doesn't this mansion have an alarm system with monitoring?  When the fire alarm goes off, you stop expressing angst and head for the keypad. Or you face a bunch of firemen, smirking because you'll have to pay a big fat fine for a false alarm.Other mysteries: Who cleans the mansion? We saw one servant in the Pilot - but they need a team.  How does Kirsten have time for grocery shopping (or picking up take-out)? Can't they call to have food delivered or hire a cook?And in the elite Harbor School, nobody seems to have much homework. Don't they compete for grades? Talk about grades? Hang out together in cliques?But...I was hooked! I didn't want to stop watching, even when I started making notes for this review. ""Nauseating."" ""Predictable."" ""Could be an NBC sitcom from twenty years ago.""  I fast-forwarded through some teen romance scenes - but there was always another episode waiting.Is it the show...or am I just experiencing Sopranos withdrawal?  After a few rounds of moist-eyed apologies and ""talk to me,"" I'm ready for someone to get whacked.  Or at least do something wrong and not  apologize.  Ah, what HBO could do with this material...",3,Everyone turns into a teddy bear,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,4850,"['series', 'appeared', 'video', 'store', 'got', 'hooked', 'Volume', 'Somewhere',

846206,AC9B29BXXWJHD,B0002V7TZQ,Ellis Bell,"[2, 2]","The nitty-grittyness of Chino and the monied sleekness of Newport Beach are stark contrasts to one another, but Ryan Atwood becomes the epitome of the fish-out-of water when he is taken in by the Cohens. Sandy Cohen, Seth Cohen, as well as Julie Cooper, thier next-door neighbor, also also ""outsiders."" Family- and-friend relations are much more complicated than they appear, as Seth's liking for Summer finally comes out into the open, as the relationship between Marissa and Ryan blossoms, and as Sandy and Kirsten deal with work and family. The OC is typical soap-opera, but admittedly highly addicting because it is so well-written. I began watching the OC at the very end of the first season (I began at the episode entitled ""The L.A., which has become one of my favorite episodes); then watched a few episodes of Season 2 on TV before I decided to buy Season 1. I am not disappointed with my purchase.The action opens in Chino, when Ryan and his older brother Trey steal a car; Trey ends up in jail, but Ryan is released because he is a minor. Sandy Cohen is his lawyer. His mother kicks Ryan out of the house, and he is forced to move in with the Cohens. Kirsten Cohen, however, is reluctant. Ryan meets the girl next door, Marissa, who is currently dating a complete jerk, Luke Ward. They all go to a party a a beach house owned by a classmate, where Ryan and Luke get into a fight. Then there's a fashion show, in which Marissa and Summer participate; more fighting ensues. Thats only the pilot episode.The next 26 episodes are action-packed and filled with enough scandal and sex to make even the most scandal-hardy cringe. Some of my favorite episodes are: ""The Pilot,"" ""The Escape,"" ""The Countdown,"" ""The L.A.,"" ""The Strip,"" and ""The Ties that Bind.""

Ryan Atwood (played by newcomer Benjamin McKenzie) does not have these luxeries, let alone a home when he is kicked out of his house in his run-down town of Chino. A rebel, lost-hope and placed on probabtion, he is taken in by his lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher from ""American Beauty""), who invites him into his family of his wife, Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) and their geeky, shy, comic-book obsessed son Seth (Adam Brody). A misfit in the world of money, designer outfits and flip-phones, Ryan has trouble fitting in with the spoilt, bratty popular group that give him grief... (to which he fights back by punching them!) But on his immediate arrival, sparks fly between Ryan and the beautiful Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), and thus, ""The OC"" begins! Seth's crush on the feisty brunette Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), dramatic love trapeziums, a crazed phsycopath, a car crash, a house fire, a drug-over dose, a blast from the past, a wedding, a divorce, a bank-ruptsy, a pregnancy, a Paris Hitlon cameo AND believe it or not SCHOOL are just some of the storylines that are visited in this 26-part series!The chemistry between the major love items (Ryan and Marissa and Seth and Summer) is extremely strong, which is important in a show that bases its stories around their relationships. The episodes mix dramatic action with halarious scenes with fantastic one-liners. Seth and Summer are particularly entertaining!The clothes the characters wear are gorgeous, and certainly makes you envious of these stinkin rich 17-year-olds! The music is... WOW!

846209,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B0002V7TZQ,Geneva,"[2, 6]","Now let me start off by saying that I love this show, I really do. I even own all of the DVDs. (Yes, including this season) But I didn't always think so highly of this show, and this season is the reason why.I started watching The OC mid-season one, largely due to my sister because she was the original OC fan in the house. And unfortunately the first episodes that I ever set my eyes on were the Oliver episodes. So now you may understand why I immediately stopped watching it, and nearly gave it up for a lost cause (until I watched it towards the end of season 2. Trey made me a fan again)There are also a few other problems with this season. Summer is highly unlikeable, as she is nothing more than an annoying bimbo. (I love her in the later seasons though) The whole summer-seth-anna love triangle is utterly annoying and so predictable, as you already know that Seth was going to choose Summer all along, even when he was dating Anna. Ryan does nothing but get into fights with people. I mean you would think that after a while Sandy and Kirsten would realize that they really shouldn't have anymore fancy parties because they would only result in ryan fighting.But there are also a few good episodes in this season that do make it worth watching.

I never watched Dawson's Creek when it was on the air, (although I have enjoyed the DVD sets), or Knot's Landing or Dallas, or any of the typical prime time soap operas.Something in the commercials for The O.C. dragged me in and I haven't left. Maybe it was the fact that it was one of a few new shows in a schedule full of reruns in August, but I think there was something more.This show, while geared toward a younger audience, revolves around not only the kids, but the well-developed parental characters. These strong adult characters provide a great backdrop with which to work with and allow for a lot of stories to work around each episode.Adam Brody is absolutely terrific as Seth Cohen. Without a doubt, he is the breakout star of this show, though kudos can also go out to Ben McKenzie for his brooding portrayal of Ryan Atwood. Brody's development over the course of the 27 episodes from geek to 'ladies' man' is quite impressive. He pulls off the whole scared little kid, yet mature young adult thing very, very well. McKenzie is also stellar, stealing many moments in the show with just the eye-piercing looks that he is capable of shooting at anyone at anytime.Equally strong are Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan as Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, complete opposites, who are completely in love with each other. Exploring their complex relationship as both parents and friends gives this show a great angle that is often not found in teen soap operas.Melinda Clarke as Julie Cooper is the perfect soap opera character. She goes from one end of the spectrum to the other in her range of emotions and her feelings. You never know what is going to come next from the mouth of Julie Cooper.Rachel Bilson, Mischa Barton, Chris Carmack and Tate Donovan also add very important pieces to the mix of The O.C. They are the people that help to shape Orange County, contributing in varying ways to the success of the season and to the lives of all those around them.This show thrives for many reasons. Of course there are the parties and the good times that appeal to the younger crowd. But to me, the success of this show hinges a lot on the adult relationships and the adult story lines. Creator Josh Schwartz has done a fantastic job of developing these very important characters that the fantastic actors have brought to life. Without Sandy and Kirsten Cohen and Julie and Jimmy Cooper, the stories that their kids work through would not be the same. It is obvious that the parents have a big impact on their kids' lives and that makes this show unlike many teen soaps that seem to often put the parents on a back burner. These parents get great story lines and really, Julie Cooper is the one person on the show that you love to hate.This set is highly recommended and hopefully the second season, which recently began on FOX, will continue the great story lines and great character development that we saw in the first season.",5,"California, Here We Come",1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2963,"['Soap', 'operas', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'never', 'watched', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'sets', 'Knot', 'Landing', 'Dallas', 'typical', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'operas.Something', 'commercials', 'O.C', 'dragged', 'have', ""n't"", 'left', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'new', 'shows', 'schedule', 'full', 'reruns', 'August', 'think', 'was', 'something', 'more.This', 'show', 'geared', 'younger', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'kids', 'well-developed', 'parental', 'characters', 'strong', 'adult', 'characters', 'provide', 'great', 'backdrop', 'work', 'allow', 'lot', 'stories', 'work', 'around', 'episode.Adam', 'Brody', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'Seth', 'Cohen', 'doubt', 'breakout', 'star', 'show', 'kudos', 'can', 'also', 'go', 'out', 'Ben', 'McKenzie', 'brooding', 'portrayal', 'Ryan', 'Atwood', 'Brody', 'development', 'course', '27', 'episodes', 'geek', ""'ladies"", 'man', 'quite', 'impressive', 'whole', 'scared', 'little', 'kid', 'yet', 'mature', 'young', 'adult', 'thing', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'McKenzie', 'also', 'stellar', 'stealing', 'many', 'moments', 'show', 'just', 'eye-piercing', 'looks', 'capable', 'shooting', 'anyone', 'anytime.Equally', 'strong', 'are', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'Cohen', 'complete', 'opposites', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'love', 'other', 'Exploring', 'complex', 'relationship', 'parents', 'show', 'great', 'angle', 'often', 'not', 'found', 'teen', 'soap', 'operas.Melinda', 'Clarke', 'Julie', 'Cooper', 'perfect', 'soap', 'opera', 'character', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'other', 'range', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'come', 'next', 'mouth', 'Julie', 'Cooper.Rachel', 'Bilson', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Chris', 'Carmack', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'also', 'add', 'very', 'important', 'pieces', 'mix', 'O.C', 'are', 'people', 'help', 'shape', 'Orange', 'County', 'contributing', 'varying', 'ways', 'success', 'season', 'lives', 'them.This', 'show', 'thrives', 'many', 'reasons', 'course', 'are', 'parties', 'good', 'times', 'appeal', 'younger', 'crowd', 'success', 'show', 'lot', 'adult', 'relationships', 'adult', 'story', 'lines', 'Creator', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'developing', 'very', 'important', 'characters', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'have', 'brought', 'life', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'Cohen', 'Julie', 'Jimmy', 'Cooper', 'stories', 'kids', 'work', 'through', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'obvious', 'parents', 'have', 'big', 'impact', 'kids', 'lives', 'show', 'many', 'teen', 'soaps', 'seem', 'often', 'put', 'parents', 'back', 'burner', 'parents', 'get', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'really', 'Julie', 'Cooper', 'one', 'person', 'show', 'love', 'hate.This', 'set', 'highly', 'recommended', 'hopefully', 'second', 'season', 'recently', 'began', 'FOX', 'will', 'continue', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'saw', 'first', 'season']",The O.C.: Season 1

There is the usual prime time soap drama, good men, bad boys, good women and absolutely terrible women. What sets this show apart isn't the plots, which are pretty run of the mill, but rather the smart dialog and excellent acting.The central characters of Sandy Cohen, played by the gorgeous Peter Gallagher, and Seth Cohen, played by the incredibly convincing Adam Brody, are what keep people coming back to the show.

In Australia we love it the first season started off with Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) going to live with the Cohens after he steals a car with his brother Trey. Kindhearted lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher) takes Ryan into his home much to the dismay of his wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan). Ryan quickly forms a bond with Sandy and Kirstens nerdy but sweet son Seth (Adam Brody) and catches the attention of girl next door Marissa (Mischa Barton) Basically Ryan is everyone that Marissa hasnt known and he is different to everything she knows and has been brought up with brought up by her snobby mother Julie (Melinda Clarke) and troubled but good father Jimmy (Tate Donovan). Marissa seems to have it all popularity is best friends with the social butterfly of the school Summer (Rachel Bilson)who Seth has always been in love with and has the boyfriend every girl at school wants Luke (Chris Carmack) who emidetly takes a disliking to Ryan when he realises that Marissa is attracted to him. Ryan wins Kirsten over early in the season when she finds out that he is a nice kid a classic bad boy with a heart of gold. Throughout the series Ryan falls in love with Marissa and vice versa. Summer begins to fall for Seth much to her horror but once she realises Seth is snabbed by Anna (Samaire Armstrong) now Summer realises for the first time in her life she is going to have to fight for the guy she wants.

846223,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B0002V7TZQ,Kona,"[8, 9]","The saga of a delinquent who finds himself living in affluent Newport Beach makes for must-see entertainment. Chino bad boy Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) is rescued from jail by his attorney (Peter Gallagher) and becomes part of his family.  His wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) isn't sure she wants the brooding boy near her son (Adam Brody) who is the quintessential comic book geek.  And then there are the girls:  Moody Marissa (Mischa Barton), Seth's secret crush Summer (Rachel Bilson), and spunky Theresa from Chino. Marissa's troubled parents and Kirsten's powerful father have their share of drama, too.  This season had the most memorable one-liners (who can forget Summer's first ""Ewww!"" or Luke's ""welcome"" to Ryan?) and one of the most poignant season finales ever.Teens enjoy the show's trendy music and fashions, while older viewers  consider it a guilty pleasure; it certainly is deliciously decadent, romantic, funny, shocking, and, of course, beautiful.  The secret lives of the spoiled Newpsies contrast nicely with the outsider's two-fisted approach to life, until he realizes they're not so different after all.  Season One has all the angst of high school junior year, as well as the social and financial machinations of the middle-agers.  The action all revolves around Ryan, sensitively played by McKenzie and the wonderful Peter Gallagher is strong as the noble and wise dad.Extras are few but it's still a terrific DVD set that will satisfy your craving for all things O.C.",5,"""Hey.""",1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1488,"['saga', 'delinquent', 'who', 'living', 'affluent', 'Newport', 'Beach', 'must-see', 'entertainment', 'Chino', 'bad', 'boy', 'Ryan', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'rescued', 'jail', 'attorney', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'part', 'family', 'wife', 'Kirsten', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', ""n't"", 'sure', 'brooding', 'boy', 'son', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'who', 'quintessential', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'then', 'are', 'girls', 'Moody', 'Marissa', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Seth', 'secret', 'crush', 'Summer', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'spunky', 'Theresa', 'Chino', 'Marissa', 'troubled', 'parents', 'Kirsten', 'powerful', 'father', 'have', 'share', 'drama', 'too', 'season', 'had', 'most', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Summer', 'first', 'Ewww', 'Luke', 'welcome', 'Ryan', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'season', 'finales', 'enjoy', 'show', 'trendy', 'music', 'fashions', 'older', 'viewers', 'consider', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'certainly', 'deliciously', 'decadent', 'romantic', 'funny', 'shocking', 'course', 'beautiful', 'secret', 'lives', 'spoiled', 'Newpsies', 'contrast', 'nicely', 'outsider', 'two-fisted', 'approach', 'life', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'different', 'Season', 'angst', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'financial', 'machinations', 'middle-agers', 'action', 'around', 'Ryan', 'sensitively', 'played', 'McKenzie', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'strong', 'noble', 'wise', 'dad.Extras', 'are', 'few', 'still', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'things', 'O.C']",The O.C.: Season 1

846225,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002V7TZQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[127, 143]","The first season of ""The O.C."" was the guilty pleasure of the 2003-2004 television series, although when it popped up in the summer of 2003 that really was more the end of the 2002-2003 television series.  After CBS had its great success with the original ""Survivor"" as a summer series, it took a while for somebody to take the next step, which was what FOX did when they offered up this new soap opera into the wasteland of summer reruns.  Actually, the first seven episodes that aired in August and September constituted a test run for ""The O.C.,"" which came back with another twenty episodes starting at the end of October.The appeal of the show based on the early buzz and media attention was supposed to be on the relationship between Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie), the boy from the wrong side of the track who is given a second chance by a compassionate lawyer, and Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), the spoiled little rich girl who lives next door.  Basically the selling point was that he looked like a young Russell Crowe and she looked like a young Twiggy.  But star-crossed lovers have been down to death, especially with the entire bad boy meets good girl angle, and the real reason we got hooked on this show was the Cohens, Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Seth (Adam Brody).Clearly the sarcasm gene is dominant on the male side of the Cohen family.  When Seth is once again the target of golden boy Luke Ward (Chris Carmack), he goes down with his mouth flapping, noting that at least he does not shave his chest.  As Sandy says where he accuses Seth of being sarcastic and his son denies the charge, ""Well, it's hard to tell sometimes.""  Actually it is just safer to assume the Cohens are being sarcastic.  As the only female Cohen points out about her strange little home, ""It's just a laugh riot around here.""  She, of course, is being ironic (rather than sarcastic), because as Sandy tells Seth, ""I love your mother more than words, but not funny.""  But she's cynical and he's self-righteous, and it appears to be working out fine as long as her father stays out of the picture.This is not to say that the others do not have their moments.  After all, Marissa does listen to the Cramps and Stiff Little Fingers instead of Avril Lavigne, but none of the others are in Sandy and Seth's league.  As for Ryan, as Seth points out he is now a Cohen, which means he has entered ""a world of insecurity and paralyzing self-doubt.""  The problem is that with Ryan around to protect him, Seth fears that he might be getting soft, but he obviously does not need to worry about forgoing the ""Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.""Plus, Seth's love life is much more interesting than what Ryan is going through, where he and Luke just keep punching each other out over Marissa (pay attention and you will notice that only one of the first seven episodes does NOT have a punch thrown in it).  Seth, on the other hand(s), is trying to juggle both Anna (Samaire Armstrong) and Summer (Rachel Bilson).  Of course he makes the wrong choice.  Anna already has a fine appreciation of graphic novels, whereas Summer has to be schooled in the basics of comic books.  Seth still wants Summer because he has been the girl of his dreams (if you know what I mean), and having her fall for him provides a level of validation that Anna can never hope to match, even with her Jenga skills.  She tries hard, but Summer is just not good enough for Seth.I think the standout episode of the first season is ""The Heartbreak,"" where Seth loses his virginity to Summer only to discover that the experience was not all that he thought it would be.  Not only does Seth get a hearty pat on the back from Sandy, but his father also brings up the idea of foreplay, which compels Seth to try, try again.  Yes, there is the joke about Summer declaring they are not having sex again and Seth agreeing that they have had ""enough pain and suffering,"" but the idea that first love could be so disastrous is rather appealing.  If there is a lesson here regarding teenage sex it would be that you should know what you are doing.  None of these kids do and see what happens to them.By the time we get to the first season's cliffhangers the only one I really cared about was Seth heading out to sea.  The relationship between Ryan and Luke ends up being more interesting than the one between Ryan and Marissa, who find a new reason not to have sex pretty much every single week.  Jimmy Cooper (Tate Donovan), Marissa's father, rips off everybody in town and still comes across better than his wife, Julie (Melinda Clarke), who goes after Kirsten's father, Caleb Nichol (Alan Dale) and ends up marrying him in the season finale.  We dislike him the most because Sandy dislikes him the most.  I do not care if Jimmy and Hailey (Amanda Righetti), Kirsten's sister, end up together because I am depressed over what happened with the restaurant and the competing meatloaf recipes.Trash television is an important part of a balanced television diet.  You can watch literate shows like ""The Gilmore Girls,"" enjoy the take of ""The West Wing"" on important political topics, debate the wrong moves of the castaways on ""Survivor,"" wrestle with God's will during ""Joan of Arcadia,"" and enjoy the delightful wickedness of ""Desperate Housewives.""  But sometimes you just need to wallow in a prime time soap opera, and with ""The O.C."" we have one that has the constant collision of characters and plot lines with the sort of wit we usually find only on Tina Fey's half of ""Weekend Update.""",5,"The new guilty pleasure TV show?

It's a classic and I garauntee will be remembered years and years from now. The first season is amazing, like no other TV show. The plots are so interesting and great. The pilot? Best episode that really gets you in the mood for the show. Ever start a show and watch the pilot, thinking, it will hopefully get better? But you won't be thinking ""hopefully it gets better"" because they don't get any better than this.The characters, in my opinion, are the most likeable out of any TV show. With the four main ones, Ryan, Marissa, Seth and Summer, I can't say I don't like one of them. They are all unique, and I think Marissa is the best. She creates drama for the show, really good looking, and believable for teens in this generation. It really is a shame for how her fate turned out, which probably everyone knows what happens to her, but I won't say more. Let's just say I'm devastated TO this day.Maybe that's why this show is so good. Even after it gets cancelled and you don't watch it for a while, the characters stay with you, the tragic events stay with you and they don't leave. It's an unforgettable show.However, after the first season the show started to decrease in its quality. Seasons 2-3 are all amazing, don't get me wrong, but the first season just has that feeling. I don't know what it is. Mostly the feeling of them being rich, living in a wealthy community, ongoing parties and debutantes, the characters being fresh...everything.The first season is the best in my opinion. But if you haven't seen this show and start from this season (which you should), you'll never stop.

Mischa Barton is probably the only casting mistake on the show as she is given the heaviest stories but unfortunately can't act to save her life.The writing is best when dealing with dialogue and has some of the wittiest deliveries on TV though it's clear that most of the O.C. slang was inspired by Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Kudos to Josh Swartchz, and other writers such as Jane Espenson (of Buffy), Erica Messer and Debra Fisher (of Arrested Development).The only  thing about this show is that it's just smart enough to skirt the line between a satirical mocking of sappy teen dramas and becoming a sappy teen drama and as many shows stumble and fall in their sophomore year, I can see that easily happening to the O.C. especially if they continue with more outlandish teen-driven plots and marginalize the ""old people"".Notable episodes:The Goodbye Girl - the final scenes (esp. with Seth and Anna) were probably some of the best in the seasonThe Strip - a bit hokey with the poker game but for some reason Julie's almost disturbing need for male strippers made me laugh out loudThe L.A. - a cute and clever self-parody with the ""soap within a soap""",3,Definitely an above-average teen soap,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,1984,"[""'d"", 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'could', 'funny', 'show', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'bought', 'DVD', 'basically', 'hype', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'critics', '.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'hilarious', 'times', 'found', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'big', 'character', 'Seth', 'put', 'describe', 'someone', 'else', 'show', 'enjoy', 'familial', 'relationships', 'show', 'Seth', 'Ryan', 'Cohens', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'Jimmy', 'well', 'everyone', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'finally', 'got', 'show', 'might', 'actually', 'make', 'Season', '2.Melinda', 'Clarke', 'great', 'Julie', 'classic', 'soap', 'diva', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'show', 'even', 'funnier', 'times', 'on-screen', 'son', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'cute', 'actually', 'believable', 'shallow', 'still', 'down-to-earth', 'Summer', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'probably', 'only', 'casting', 'mistake', 'show', 'given', 'heaviest', 'stories', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'save', 'life.The', 'writing', 'best', 'when', 'dealing', 'dialogue', 'wittiest', 'deliveries', 'TV', 'clear', 'most', 'O.C', 'slang', 'was', 'inspired', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Kudos', 'Josh', 'Swartchz', 'other', 'writers', 'such', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'Buffy', 'Erica', 'Messer', 'Debra', 'Fisher', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'just', 'smart', 'enough', 'skirt', 'line', 'satirical', 'mocking', 'sappy', 'teen', 'dramas', 'becoming', 'sappy', 'teen', 'drama', 'many', 'shows', 'stumble', 'fall', 'sophomore', 'year', 'can', 'see', 'easily', 'happening', 'O.C', 'especially', 'continue', 'more', 'outlandish', 'teen-driven', 'plots', 'marginalize', 'old', 'people', '.Notable', 'episodes', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'final', 'scenes', 'esp', 'Seth', 'Anna', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'seasonThe', 'Strip', 'bit', 'hokey', 'poker', 'game', 'reason', 'Julie', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'need', 'male', 'strippers', 'made', 'loudThe', 'L.A.', 'cute', 'clever', 'self-parody', 'soap', 'soap']",The O.C.: Season 1

I had been hearing so much about this show but was not really that interested in seeing it. I read the reviews here on amazon and saw nothing but positive reviews which of course made me curious to check it out. I ended up purchasing this first season and I have to say I was really pleased with how good the show is. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place.

846239,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002V7TZQ,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","In my opinion, we are living in the new Golden Age of television. The reasons are twofold: a sharp increase in the quality of television writing and improved means of viewing series thanks to both high definition television and DVDs. The quality of writing is not just a result of a new generation of highly talented writers hitting the scene, but a tremendous broadening of what writers are able to achieve in the medium. Before shows like HILL STREET BLUES began breaking down the stand-alone episode format that had dominated television for decades, allowing a degree of character of development and a narrative complexity not previously possible, writers were saddled with concocting stories that had to be contained entirely within a 40 or 20 minute show. But beginning in the late 1980s and especially after shows like THE X-FILES, plots began breaking out of the 40 minute strait-jacket and an individual episode started picking up plot details from earlier shows, more often than not leaving much to be explained in future episodes. Though series like LAW AND ORDER and CSI continue to work with the earlier format, more shows than not now exult in the freedom of story arcs that carry over long stretches of seasons, juggling two or three or more narratives at once.Of all the genres exploiting the new freedom given television writers, my least favorite has always been the teen or adult soap opera. I found all of Aaron Spelling's shows to be fairly unwatchable and was left cold by DAWSON'S CREEK.  Despite this, I find THE O.C. to be a delightful exception to this role. What sets this series apart from its competitors is the sharp intelligence of the writing, a first rate cast that spans a wide range of ages, an unwillingness to pander in cheap pathos, and a mildly self-ironic stance towards the genre to which it belongs. The show manages to be genuinely funny, emotionally involving, and surprisingly moral all at the same time. I'm sometimes suspicious of why some people like it, but if some like it for the wrong reasons, there are plenty of very good reasons to like it.The most immediate reason for liking the show is the absolutely first-rate cast. Benjamin McKenzie made an immediate splash on the show as Ryan Atwood, a good kid from Chino caught in a bad situation. Physically he bears a striking resemblance to Russell Crowe, a fact that received much mention when the show debuted and even commented on in one episode. Ryan and his date have returned from seeing MASTER AND COMMANDER, and looking him full in the eye says that she doesn't understand why anyone thinks that Russell Crowe is handsome. Of course, the audience is in on the joke. Ryan is befriended by the idealistic Sandy Cohen, a New Yorker who in his youth was much like Ryan. He brings Ryan home to his upper class home in a Malibu-like community, and almost by accident he, his wife, and son become Ryan's new foster home. Peter Gallagher, an actor I've rarely liked in the past, is absolutely outstanding as Sandy, and makes him my favorite character on the show. Through the first two seasons Sandy acts as the moral center of the show, so completely driven by his principles that at times even his familial relations are sometimes threatened by them. But his compassion and determination to do what is right are downright inspirational. He is one of the rare truly good characters on television. Kelly Rowan is superb as Sandy's wife Kirsten, and Adam Brody is even better as their son Seth. One of the great cool nerds on TV, Seth also exhibits perhaps the best taste in culture on TV (how often do truly great cultural figures like Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller, the Shins, Modest Mouse, and their ilk get mentioned on prime time?). Together Ryan, Sandy, Kirsten, and Seth make one of the most compelling families on TV. And women! No prime time television show would be complete without gorgeous women, and THE O.C. is no exception. Mischa Barton is not just a pretty face, though she is at least that. Tall, lithe, and blessed with the looks of a beautiful fashion model, she plays Marisa, more or less Ryan's love interest on the show. She is a good enough actress that she manages to make her character more interesting than equivalent characters on other shows, and the writers give her more opportunity to shine by making Marisa an individual who struggle more than most in coping with her problems. In the first two seasons of the show, she has struggled with alcohol, drugs, and sexual experimentation, and managing to be profoundly unhappy through it all. Equally interesting is Rachel Bilson as Summer, a cute but ultra-self-absorbed teen who could have been a one-dimensional character similar to Cordelia Chase in the first three seasons of BUFFY, but instead quickly develops into a more complex and interesting character (much as Cordelia did once she shifted to ANGEL) who has an inexplicable attraction to Seth (again, much as Cordelia was to Xander). To add to the BUFFY connection, the first time I saw Rachel Bilson was in the great Season Seven episode of BUFFY called ""Dirty Girls,"" in which she plays (along with another Potential Slayer) a brief though memorable part as the object of a very funny sexual fantasy on the part of Xander. Summer is a great example of the way that the writers resist turning roles into stock characters. There are also a string of excellent performers in smaller roles, including Samaire Armstrong as Anna Stern, a competitor for Summer for Seth's attentions, and Navi Rowat, Ryan's ex-girlfriend.I'm less thrilled by Melinda Clarke as Julie Cooper-Nichol, Marissa's mother and a character who would seem more at home on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES than THE O.C. This is typical of a larger problem: the show doesn't do nearly as good with unsympathetic characters as with sympathetic ones. If we are supposed to love them, we generally do, but if we are supposed to hate them, we do because they simply aren't likable. Instead of being great bad characters, they only manage to be off putting. Over two seasons I have failed to like Alan Dale as Kirsten's father, and Taylor Handley as the troubled and manipulative and utterly unbelievable Oliver Trask was positively awful. This is all a bit odd because many of the most memorable characters on TV have been evil or at least kind of bad. But THE O.C. has yet to produce a single excellent bad character. Perhaps that will be a project for Season Three.My friend Tracy pointed out one other great virtue of the show to me. She noted that unlike most other series with strong teen elements, the adult story lines are at least as good. Stories involving Sandy or Kirsten or other adults are not mere throw ins, but fully equal to the kid story lines. I think this is in part responsible for the narrative richness of the show. It is not just a show for the kiddies.As much as I have loved this show, there is still the problem with the genre. I mentioned that I don't like teen and adult soap operas, and part of the reason lies in the difficulty such shows have in sustaining narratives. A show like VERONICA MARS or BUFFY or LOST, where large-scale stories provide the framework for all of the narrative elements, have a huge advantage over a show like THE O.C. In these shows there is a sense of a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Veronica Mars in that show's first season was both trying to solve the mystery of the death of her best friend and exonerate her father from a series of false accusations. In Season Five of Buffy our heroine was attempting to confront a hell goddess bent upon killing her sister. In both of these instances the plot gave the series a unity that THE O.C. always lacks. Instead it consists of a host of smaller stories; good stories, but a multiplicity of smaller narratives that are not terribly unified. In the end, that is the only thing that keeps THE O.C. from rivaling my favorite series, the inability to tell a Big Story.Nonetheless, THE O.C. is an exceptionally well-done series with a group of characters that are exceptionally easy to like. The first season was very good, the second season perhaps even better, and this leaves me looking very much forward to the third season.",5,A sharply and wittily written teen and adult

(Fans of the OC are actually quite upset at this and even are making 'Save Marissa' web sites all over- just Google Save Marissa and you'll see!) But the point is- she's gone. Yet after watching last season and realizing the amazing four would only be the amazing three now, I started missing Marissa. She was annoying at times oh yes, but her character was a big part of the show, and she did bring a lot of drama to the show that kept us watching. Without her who knows what will happen now. We'll have to see next time OC comes on, but I bought Season One to remember some of her best moments on the show.That wasn't the only reason though, but it was what finally compelled me to buy the complete first season. I also bought season one because I must say I forgot a lot of what happened back then. The seasons after had so much drama to remember that a lot of season one's scenes I totally forgot. I must admit season one had some of the funniest moments, and some of the most drammatic. I got so hooked on the first season that I had the whole season finished in a week. The OC is just that addictive to me.Is the first season better than the others? Some say so, and I guess on most shows first seasons are the best. I think the OC though has stayed quite strong throughout their whole time, and I cannot wait to see how the next season will unfold, after the death of Marissa. It will take an interesting new turn I feel.I am a big fan of the OC overall, and I think it is a lot better than some of the other drama shows on now. The actors have actual depth, the problems and worries they have are realistic, and the show can get so emotionally charged that you can't help but be at the end of your seat and feel like you're right there with them. That is what a good show does for us, and the OC is very successful at that especially in season one. This is a five- star DVD collection I highly recommend it and the show itself- don't just think that it's just a bunch of whiny rich kids, the show actually is humrous, heartfelt, exciting and honest.",5,Marissa's Gone...But Some of Her Best Moments Will Be Remembered On The First Season,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2165,"['Yes', 'happened', 'Marissa', 'finally', 'attracted', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'boy', 'drama', 'finally', 'ended', 'OC', 'Fans', 'OC', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'upset', 'even', 'are', 'making', ""'Save"", 'Marissa', 'web', 'over-', 'just', 'Google', 'Save', 'Marissa', ""'ll"", 'see', 'point', 'is-', 'gone', 'watching', 'last', 'season', 'realizing', 'amazing', 'four', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'amazing', 'three', 'now', 'started', 'missing', 'Marissa', 'was', 'annoying', 'times', 'oh', 'yes', 'character', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'did', 'bring', 'lot', 'drama', 'show', 'kept', 'watching', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'now', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'next', 'time', 'OC', 'bought', 'Season', 'One', 'remember', 'best', 'moments', 'show.That', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'what', 'finally', 'compelled', 'buy', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'bought', 'season', 'one', 'must', 'say', 'forgot', 'lot', 'what', 'happened', 'back', 'then', 'seasons', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'drama', 'remember', 'lot', 'season', 'one', 'scenes', 'totally', 'forgot', 'must', 'admit', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'funniest', 'moments', 'most', 'drammatic', 'got', 'so', 'hooked', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'whole', 'season', 'finished', 'week', 'OC', 'just', 'that', 'addictive', 'me.Is', 'first', 'season', 'better', 'others', 'say', 'so', 'guess', 'most', 'shows', 'first', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'think', 'OC', 'though', 'stayed', 'quite', 'strong', 'whole', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'next', 'season', 'will', 'unfold', 'death', 'Marissa', 'will', 'take', 'interesting', 'new', 'turn', 'feel.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'OC', 'overall', 'think', 'lot', 'better', 'other', 'drama', 'shows', 'now', 'actors', 'have', 'actual', 'depth', 'problems', 'worries', 'have', 'are', 'realistic', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'end', 'seat', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'what', 'good', 'show', 'OC', 'very', 'successful', 'especially', 'season', 'one', 'five-', 'star', 'DVD', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'itself-', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'think', 'just', 'bunch', 'whiny', 'rich', 'kids', 'show', 'actually', 'humrous', 'heartfelt', 'exciting', 'honest']",The O.C.: Season 1

Naturally, I was skeptical. It looked like another random and predictable teen drama. Once the show debuted, I heard so many good things about it, but it wasn't until the cotillion episode I finally sat down and gave it a chance.This isn't just the smartest teen soap opera in years; it is one of the smartest period. Out of the 27 first season episodes, there is not a weak one in the bunch. This is all due to the excellent writing, but mostly it is because of the ensemble cast. The parents and teens interact rather than never communicate like on some shows, and in some cases the parents have more interesting stories. In fact, Sandy, Kirsten, and Julie Cooper-the show's chief troublemaker-are my favorite characters. All the characters are very well-developed, which is a welcome surprise for a show like this. What also works well is how the show never seems to take itself seriously. This self-deprecation and flair for comedy is most apparent in the Thanksgiving episode, which is my all-time favorite episode simply because it is where the Summer/Seth/Anna triangle turns into classic screwball romantic comedy material. To me, that is the big appeal of the show. Even when most of the characters are screaming, crying, or brooding, you know something funny will happen next to lighten the mood.If you think you won't like this show, you would be surprised. I got this set last week and my family has ended up watching it more than I have! Many people who have made fun of me for watching this show have asked to borrow it when I am finished.

Turns out, the sun-drenched, bikini-clad beaches of Orange County are the place to be. The show is filled with great characters (Seth, Summer, Anna, Sandy), great drama (Julie Cooper sleeping with her daughter's ex-boyfriend!) and a great heart (The Cohens adopting Ryan shows us the importance of family). You can always count on Seth Cohen to make you laugh, even in the dreariest episodes. But really, every episode is entertaining and just plain fun to watch. I mean, sure, we're spending an hour of our day listening to wealthy people complain about their lives, but that's the whole fun of it. I really recommend this season of the O.C. and hope that it is seen as more than a 'Beverly Hills 90210' follow-up. Even if these characters seem from another world, we can still relate to them and care for them. It's so great because I was a senior in high school when the show aired and on Thursday mornings, EVERYONE was talking about 'last night's episode'. This is a show males AND females can both watch and discuss afterwards.

As everyone else I ""fell in love"" with Seth, loved the parents, was curious about Ryan and Marissa....After the Oliver plot, things started to go downhill.  For one thing the actor playing Ryan was reduced to opening his eyes wide everytime he would see Marissa, or rolling his eyes around when he was annoyed, surprised, in love, in hate, whatever with Marissa.  His expression did not change for 4 or 5 episodes.Everyone gets along with each other, even if they start off being enemies.  The girls are especially angelic to each other exchanging dresses and niceties, even when feeling jealous......One of the most interesting characters, Anna, was shipped off, once Seth and Rachel became an item.Anyway, why go on,  the whole thing just became boring.I forced myself to watch it until the end, hoping that it would pick up; again.  They did manage to arouse my curiosity in the last episode.  However when I read the plot lines and twists in Season 2, and all the characters they bring in and out, I am sure it's not worth it.  I will not be buying the second season.And I'm sorry I bought season 1.The reason I gave it 2 stars is because Seth is very funny, the actors playing Sandy and Kirsten are great, and the show tries once in a while to raise its intelligence quotient by mentioning Pulitzer prize winning books like ""The Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"", which I happen to be reading now.On to my next guilty pleasure.........",2,TOTALLY OVERRATED,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,1918,"['live', 'U.S.', 'am', 'always', 'starved', 'good', 'television', 'series.Knowing', 'O.C', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'comparable', 'West', 'Wing', 'still', 'wanted', 'try', 'read', 'many', 'customers', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'nice', 'indulge', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'once', 'while.I', 'have', 'watched', 'loved', 'Felicity', 'Alias', '24', 'Friends', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'O.C', 'try.At', 'beginning', 'season', 'liked', 'premise', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'actors', 'everyone', 'else', 'fell', 'love', 'Seth', 'loved', 'parents', 'was', 'curious', 'Ryan', 'Marissa', '.After', 'Oliver', 'plot', 'things', 'started', 'go', 'downhill', 'one', 'thing', 'actor', 'playing', 'Ryan', 'was', 'reduced', 'opening', 'eyes', 'wide', 'everytime', 'would', 'see', 'Marissa', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'when', 'was', 'annoyed', 'surprised', 'love', 'hate', 'Marissa', 'expression', 'did', 'not', 'change', '4', '5', 'episodes.Everyone', 'along', 'other', 'even', 'start', 'being', 'enemies', 'girls', 'are', 'especially', 'angelic', 'other', 'exchanging', 'dresses', 'niceties', 'even', 'when', 'feeling', 'jealous', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Anna', 'was', 'shipped', 'off', 'once', 'Seth', 'Rachel', 'became', 'item.Anyway', 'why', 'go', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'became', 'boring.I', 'forced', 'watch', 'end', 'hoping', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'did', 'manage', 'arouse', 'curiosity', 'last', 'episode', 'However', 'when', 'read', 'plot', 'lines', 'twists', 'Season', '2', 'characters', 'bring', 'am', 'sure', 'not', 'worth', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'second', 'season.And', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'bought', 'season', '1.The', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'Seth', 'very', 'funny', 'actors', 'playing', 'Sandy', 'Kirsten', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'once', 'while', 'raise', 'intelligence', 'quotient', 'mentioning', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'books', 'Adventures', 'Kavalier', 'Clay', 'happen', 'be', 'reading', 'now.On', 'next', 'guilty', 'pleasure']",The O.C.: Season 1

This show has quickly become one of my favorites.I am glad that Warner Brothers has decided to release this series as quickly as they did (they usually wait until season three to release the first season DVD, like everwood and smallville).If your a fan of Dawson's Creek or One Tree Hill or Dallas, this is a show for you.",5,It's nothing like where you live...,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1314,"['nothing', 'what', 'imagine', 'August', '2003', 'FOX', 'network', 'premired', 'teen', 'soap', 'O.C', 'quickly', 'went', 'be', 'network', 'biggest', 'hit', 'year', 'show', 'Ryan', 'Atwood', 'tought', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'young-man', 'who', 'misfourtune', 'quickly', 'following', 'jail-bate', 'brother', 'fathers', 'footsteps', 'then', 'Sandy', 'Cohen', 'who', 'wife', 'Kristine', 'take', 'Ryan', 'world', 'Introduce', 'world', 'fortune', 'priviledge', 'beauty', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Ryan', 'lives', 'hidden', 'deep', 'sand', 'kids', 'living', 'secret', 'lives', 'parents', 'parents', 'living', 'secret', 'lives', 'kids.Like', 'most', 'favorite', 'show', 'discoved', 'O.C', 'fluk', 'entire', 'summer', 'watched', 'previews', 'thought', 'looked', 'horrible', 'rip-off', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Tivo', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'becuase', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'Tate', 'Donavan', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Tivo', 'recorded', 'pilot', 'THANK', 'GOODNESS', 'show', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorites.I', 'am', 'glad', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'decided', 'release', 'series', 'as', 'quickly', 'did', 'usually', 'wait', 'season', 'three', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'everwood', 'smallville', 'fan', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Dallas', 'show']",The O.C.: Season 1
