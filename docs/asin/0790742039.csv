Good bits.  The Internet Movie Database tends to support this theory, because it lists the running time of ""Divine Madness"" as 95 minutes, while this DVD has a running time of 86 minutes.I can't enumerate precisely what those missing 9 minutes contain, but I do have a strong recollection of Bette Midler on the floor with all three Harlettes, with all of them wearing mermaid tails, and an extended sequence on the exact words to the chorus of the ""Hawaiian War Chant"" (not just the main verse).There are some really outstanding bits here.  The standup segments are great, the mermaid number (even in its apparently curtailed form) is fun, and there are several great musical moments with songs from the 40s and 50s.  There are also a lot of slow bits, however, along with a few musical numbers which border on shrill.Before watching the DVD, I would have given this show a solid 4 out of 5 or better.  Now, though, I feel charitable rating it a 3, and I wonder just how badly my memory is playing tricks on me.",3,Not what I remember...,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,1237,"['saw', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'VHS', 'sometime', 'back', '1984', '1985', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'possible', 'memory', 'playing', 'tricks', 'would', 'swear', 'were', 'scenes', 'old', 'edition', 'are', 'missing', 'here', 'Good', 'bits', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'support', 'theory', 'running', 'time', 'Divine', 'Madness', '95', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', '86', 'minutes.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enumerate', 'precisely', 'what', 'missing', '9', 'minutes', 'contain', 'do', 'have', 'strong', 'recollection', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'floor', 'three', 'Harlettes', 'wearing', 'mermaid', 'tails', 'extended', 'sequence', 'exact', 'words', 'chorus', 'Hawaiian', 'War', 'Chant', 'not', 'just', 'main', 'verse', 'are', 'really', 'outstanding', 'bits', 'here', 'standup', 'segments', 'are', 'great', 'mermaid', 'number', 'even', 'apparently', 'curtailed', 'form', 'fun', 'are', 'several', 'great', 'musical', 'moments', 'songs', '40s', '50s', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'slow', 'bits', 'however', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'border', 'shrill.Before', 'watching', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'show', 'solid', '4', '5', 'better', 'Now', 'feel', 'charitable', 'rating', '3', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'memory', 'playing', 'tricks']",N/A

What a performance, and what a performer!And what a disappointment that ""Shiver Me Timbers"" and ""Rainbow Sleeve"" are not included.

There are points where she had to overrecord on certain songs because they sounded that horrible. The comedy routines work well and so does some of the songs that she sings.
