1510658,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0065IZEE8,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[86, 89]","The affection afforded this British movie by other UK reviewers is absolutely on the money - ""Third Star"" is a superbly realised little film with a huge beating heart. I was very moved...The story goes like this - James' lifelong but hapless pals decide that one last adventure will be a hoot and morale booster for their mate who is dying from an incurable disease. So they drag his three-wheeler chair loaded up with tents, drug suplies and a potted tree they will plant at journey's end - across fields, forest and coastal terrain. Their destination is Barafundle Bay - a stunning, secluded inlet in Wales that James adores. And you can see it in James' face too. He thinks that if he can just get there 'intact' - everything will be all right somehow. But of course nothing goes to plan and despite the odd belly-laugh along the way, the journey tests their friendship and loyalties to the absolute limit...First up - praise has to go to HATTIE DALTON for her warmth and steady Direction in what could have been awfully cheesy material that's been done to bits too many times before. She's given this buddy-buddy story a lightness of touch that feels real and isn't forced. In fact, the constant wit and pranks reflect just how guys are when they're in real emotional turmoil - downright childish even. Kudos should also go to the four male leads who had to gel together convincingly, muck in on the arduous trek and physically brave the coastal weather - none of which can have been easy - or in the case of the freezing Irish sea - deeply unpleasant. And when the reality of their friend's terminal illness slowly begins to kick in and intrude on their 'fun' - they're skills as good actors make you 'feel' the heaviness of what their characters are all trying to block out.Principal lead Benedict Cumberbatch has many fans - and on the strength of his acting chops both here and on ""Sherlock"" (the UK TV series) - it's easy to see why. His James is a demanding lead-role - a frustrated 29-year old who is being eaten-alive by cancer. His longing to live - to have more time - to realise at least some of his dreams - are always at the surface - and you ache for him as he slips in and out of a morphine-induced stupor that is numbing his escalating physical agony. As well as the pain - James has to also contend with his squabbling, tetchy pals - who are trying to be cool about it all but are freaked out inside and increasingly awkward with his now impending loss.His fellow travellers consist of Adam Robertson as the witty and yet dependable Bill, Tom Burke as the needy but sincere Davy and JJ Feild as the handsome devil-may-care Miles (surely a new Jude Law in the making). They will even encounter Hugh Bonneville (of Downton Abbey fame) as a nutty Beachcomber looking for rare Star Wars toys. The dialogue is playful, smart and confrontational when it's needed. And then they're faced with the ultimate true-friendship decision - but can any or all of them - actually go through with it? Even with this much sadness at its core and end, ""Third Star"" remains hopeful - a sign of a great film rather than just a good one.EXTRAS include a brief 'Making Of' and two shorts by Hattie Dalton called ""The Banker"" and ""One Of Those Days"". The only real let down for me is that it's on DVD only - and not BLU RAY - where all that great camera work would surely shine even more.There are moments in ""Third Star"" when you genuinely ache for James' loss - when you hurt at the arbitrary cruelty of life - snubbing out one person, but letting another live.

Thankfully Third Star isn't all overwhelming gloom and sadness. There is a joyous atmosphere sprinkled throughout that leaves you lighthearted and smiling, before the depressing bits come along and ensnare you. This is a simple tale of four good longtime friends, taking one final journey together.James, played by a superb Benedict Cumberbatch is suffering from terminal cancer, but wishes for one last visit to his favorite seaside spot. His friends accompany him, helping him, aiding him and supporting him in any way they can. He is only 29 and there's a bitterness about him that can't be helped, given his situation. But he clearly loves his friends, no matter how many ups and downs they've been through. They are all pranksters at heart and the film really does a fine job balancing their raucous nature with the precarious situation they've found themselves in.The film is shot beautifully and the scenery is lovely to look at, the musical score subtle and fitting. The rest of the small cast does a wonderful job as well and that's really what keeps this film afloat. Their friendship is enduring, no matter what's happened or what will inevitably happen.James' fragility is heartbreaking to witness, his resolve is strong though and when they finally reach their destination, it seems all worth it. The final fifteen minutes of the film is achingly painful, like a fist clenching onto your heart. It left me a weepy mess.This is actually a hard film to review. Does anyone actually LIKE watching someone suffer through an incurable illness for an hour and a half? You can't help but think of everyone you've ever known with a similar situation. It's not fair. It's just like one character says in the film: &#34;It's just really, really, really, really unlucky.&#34;I'm glad I watched Third Star, but I can't picture a repeat viewing. I don't think my heart can take it again...",5,"Subtle, poignant and heartbreaking",1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1949,"['nothing', 'cancer', 'film', 'bring', 'down', 'mood', 'Thankfully', 'Third', 'Star', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'gloom', 'sadness', 'joyous', 'atmosphere', 'sprinkled', 'lighthearted', 'smiling', 'depressing', 'bits', 'come', 'along', 'ensnare', 'simple', 'tale', 'four', 'good', 'longtime', 'friends', 'taking', 'one', 'final', 'journey', 'together.James', 'played', 'superb', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'suffering', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'wishes', 'one', 'last', 'visit', 'favorite', 'seaside', 'spot', 'friends', 'accompany', 'helping', 'aiding', 'supporting', 'way', 'can', 'only', '29', 'bitterness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'given', 'situation', 'clearly', 'friends', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', ""'ve"", 'been', 'are', 'pranksters', 'heart', 'film', 'really', 'fine', 'job', 'balancing', 'raucous', 'nature', 'precarious', 'situation', ""'ve"", 'found', 'in.The', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'look', 'musical', 'score', 'subtle', 'fitting', 'rest', 'small', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'well', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'afloat', 'friendship', 'enduring', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'will', 'inevitably', 'happen.James', 'fragility', 'heartbreaking', 'witness', 'resolve', 'strong', 'though', 'when', 'finally', 'reach', 'destination', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'achingly', 'painful', 'fist', 'clenching', 'heart', 'left', 'weepy', 'mess.This', 'actually', 'hard', 'film', 'review', 'Does', 'anyone', 'actually', 'LIKE', 'watching', 'someone', 'suffer', 'incurable', 'illness', 'hour', 'half', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'similar', 'situation', 'not', 'fair', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'film', '34', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'unlucky.', '34', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'Third', 'Star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'heart', 'can', 'take', 'again']",N/A

Just superb performances and a good, simple story.  If you've ever been ill with a long life-threatening illness, you know that that is when you find out who your real friends are.  This film touches on those friendships that last and stay to the end which many people simply are not lucky enough to have.  It's written very well and I almost believe the the script was written by someone who's experienced this.  A beautiful portrayal of love, brotherhood and the beauty and fragility of life.",5,Beautiful,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,579,"['What', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'titles', 'director', 'Just', 'superb', 'performances', 'good', 'simple', 'story', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'ill', 'long', 'life-threatening', 'illness', 'know', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'real', 'friends', 'are', 'film', 'touches', 'friendships', 'last', 'stay', 'end', 'many', 'people', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'believe', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'beautiful', 'portrayal', 'love', 'brotherhood', 'beauty', 'fragility', 'life']",N/A
