582848,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JAB7,Andy Orrock,"[0, 1]","This powerfully emotional film from director/co-star Jeroen Krabb&eacute; works and sticks with you, despite some fundamental quirks.  You've got to swallow the idea that we're set in Antwerp with the Scottish actress Laura Fraser as the lead, all set in English.  We just sawI've Loved You So Long [Blu-ray] and the filmmakers there take the pains to write an explanation for Kristin Scott Thomas' English accent (the film's in French) into the script.  Here, we get an inexplicable mixture of people and languages in this environment, yet no reason for it.  [I'm reminded ofSmilla's Sense of Snow, where Julia Ormond is supposed to be Danish...and Robert Loggia as her father, no less.]Again, despite those comments, this is a powerful film not to be missed.  It has one particular moment of such overwhelming, perfectly staged, unexpected emotion that I defy any viewer to watch it with a dry eye...just as I defy any viewer not to fall head over heels for Laura Fraser in her portrayal as Chaya.  Her beauty and winsomeness - she's approx. age 21 - 22 when this was released in 1998 - will bowl you over.",4,"Not without its quirks, but a powerful film worth seeing",1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,1108,"['powerfully', 'emotional', 'film', 'director/co-star', 'Jeroen', 'Krabb', 'eacute', 'works', 'sticks', 'fundamental', 'quirks', ""'ve"", 'got', 'swallow', 'idea', ""'re"", 'set', 'Antwerp', 'Scottish', 'actress', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'lead', 'set', 'English', 'just', 'sawI', ""'ve"", 'Loved', 'So', 'Long', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'filmmakers', 'there', 'take', 'pains', 'write', 'explanation', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'English', 'accent', 'film', 'French', 'script', 'Here', 'get', 'inexplicable', 'mixture', 'people', 'languages', 'environment', 'yet', 'reason', '[', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'ofSmilla', 'Sense', 'Snow', 'where', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'supposed', 'be', 'Danish', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'father', 'less', ']', 'Again', 'comments', 'powerful', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'particular', 'moment', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'perfectly', 'staged', 'unexpected', 'emotion', 'defy', 'viewer', 'watch', 'dry', 'eye', 'just', 'defy', 'viewer', 'not', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'portrayal', 'Chaya', 'beauty', 'winsomeness', 'approx', 'age', '21', '22', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'will', 'bowl', 'over']",N/A
582849,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005JAB7,Anyechka,"[21, 21]","This film brings up a number of important issues, issues that one doesn't see often in more mainstream big-budget films.  It's set in Belgium in the early Seventies, and Chaja, the main character, is caught up in the student movements and youth politics of the day.  She's quite detached from the Jewish identity of her parents, who are Shoah survivors, and their friends.  Due to the era in which this film takes place, most of the survivors are only middle-aged, still relatively young, instead of the aging people we picture them as today.  However, after quitting her restaurant job in disgust at the beginning of the film, she, through her family friend Mr. Apfelschnitt, finds employment as a nanny for a Hassidic family, the Kalmans.  It is through this job, which she initially also felt like walking away from, that she develops a reconnection to her faith and to her heritage.  She is also persuaded to keep the job because of one of the Kalmans' children, four year old Simcha, who is autistic and very attached to her.  Both because of her growing affection for the Kalmans and her reconnection to her roots, she is forced to re-examine a number of things in her life, such as the latent anti-Semitism of her roommate and supposed best friend Sofie and the openly anti-Semitic and even downright cruel and abusive landlord and elevator-operator in the Kalmans' apartment.  One wishes that there were more films of this nature being made about the Hassidic community, giving an accurate and fair and balanced portrayal, instead of offensive and untruthful garbage like 'Kadosh' and 'A Price Above Rubies.'  There's also the subplot of Chaja's father's obsessive decades-long search to find the luggage he buried the night before he had to leave his family behind and go into hiding from the Nazis; hence the film's title.  A third, more minor, subplot concerns their neighbors the Goldmans; Mr. Goldman is a prolific philatelist, which really angers and frustrates his wife, who feels that he cares more about his stamps and pays more attention to them than to her and their marriage.  I was also excited to learn that it was based on a novel, which I hope to find a copy of eventually.However, as wonderful and touching as this film is, I just wish it had been somewhat longer.  I felt it ended just when things were really getting involving and full of tension, everything really coming to a head.  There could have easily been another 30 minutes or so of working out the events that were transpiring instead of more or less ending without a great deal of resolution to all of these great subplots that had so much more dramatic potential.  The ending seems more depressing and unresolved than anything else, even though of course not all films are meant to have happy sunshiny endings or to make the viewer feel good.  And I know that Chaja's character is meant to be a thoroughly modern woman of the Seventies, and someone who has no real love for or interest in her religion, but I thought it was a bit unrealistic how at first she was going over to the Kalmans' and taking their kids out to the park dressed in miniskirts and jeans.  Surely Mr. Apfelschnitt (who is religious) would have told her that those just aren't acceptable outfits when in the company of Hassidic people; whether or not one dresses like that in one's own world shouldn't preclude having respect for the conventions of modesty of one's hosts.  She was a guest in their house, and a guest on shaky ground at best at first, not the other way around!  It also seems a bit unrealistic how Sofie has no idea, until Chaja informs her of this fact during the skinny-dipping scene pretty far into the film, that her best friend is Jewish.  How many Belgian women their age would have had such an overtly Hebrew name like that in the Seventies, or even in any era, unless they were Jewish?  And wouldn't she have known from Chaja telling her about her family life anyway?  (As for the skinny-dipping scene itself, yes we see full frontal nudity in both women, but it only lasts for a second or so, and besides, there's absolutely nothing sexual or pornographic about it.  Not all nudity is automatically adult in context or inappropriate for children, unless one is teaching children that all nudity is inherently shameful and dirty, and only exists in a sexual context, which I would consider far more inappropriate than a very brief and innocent scene of full frontal nudity.)Overall, this is a very thought-provoking film, one that doesn't offer any easy answers about complex issues, but rather leaves it up to the different characters to work out their own answers and ideas.  All of these characters have their own ""left luggage,"" and all come to different conclusions as to how to resolve it.  Though it does have obviously strong Jewish content, and therefore some references or terms which might not be fully understood by outsiders to the faith, it's also a film that's easily-accessible to people of all religions.",4,"Wonderful film, but wish it had been longer",1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,5006,"['film', 'up', 'number', 'important', 'issues', 'issues', 'one', ""n't"", 'see', 'often',

People excused JFK's malaprop rather than mock him, because they knew what was in his heart.One needs to look deeper into people, before making quick judgments.This film captures that, using charming Chaya's (Laura Fraser) coming of age journey, as a young Jewish woman living a life with little real meaning or direction, until she happens upon a deeper understanding of who she is, through finding deeper meanings in others. The film shows how people may try to run from who they really are, but sooner or later they must confront it, if they are to mature.The transformation of Chaya begins when accepting a job as a nanny to a Chassidic family.Happiness, tragedy, and imperfect people all serve to find that deeper understanding for Chaya. It are dramatic words from the wonderful Isabella Rossellini, as the Chassidic mom, to Chaya, as a ""daughter of Israel,"" which signals the completion of the transformation.Yes, the film's title, and Chaya's dad's (Maximillian Shell)  search for what was left in the past, has symbolic meaning.

I didn't think so.In Germany the film is audaciously titled ""Kalman's Nanny"";in Argentina, ""For Love"" and rather innocuously ""Research of the Past"" in French Canada! The fact is that LEFT LUGGAGE is a bit of all of these titles,but alas not specifically any one of them.Herein is my rub;for all it's good intentions, this film is neither a great look at Holocaust ""baggage"" nor a film about love for a child, nor about researching the past.You will learn little bits about lots of things, but not specifically about one.If Chassidism is what you are more curious, I suggestThe Chosen.If you are more interested in the Holocaust, there are innumerable films that are far more interesting than LEFT LUGGAGE.The same goes for a girl coming to grips with her heritage from WW2 as in  (An American Rhapsody,The Devil's Arithmetic,orMusic Box.I would have to echo ""Newsday"" critic,Gene Seymour's ""frequently moving"" accenting frequently, but not always.A very cautious 3 stars.",3,"Film with heart,but much predictability and lack of focus",1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,2819,"['LEFT', 'LUGGAGE', 'English', 'speaking', 'Netherlands', 'film', 'was', 'tremendous', 'film', 'festival', 'traveler', 'known', 'worldwide', 'nine', 'very', 'different', 'titles.The', 'U.S.', 'release', 'refers', 'luggage', 'Chaja', 'Father', 'had', 'buried', 'Antwerp', 'Belgium', 'when', 'Nazi', 'onslaught', 'hit', 'Belgium.The', 'film', 'then', 'symbolically', 'refers', 'baggage', 'left', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'endured', 'survived', 'Holocaust', 'legacy', 'put', 'next', 'generation.I', 'have', 'seen', 'script', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'far', 'more', 'effectively', '1972', 'Antwerp', 'Chaja', 'Scotland', 'Laura', 'Fraser-Virtual', 'Sexuality', 'daughter', 'two', 'non-religious', 'Jewish', 'Holocaust', 'survivors.Her', 'Father', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'Mother', 'acknowledge', 'it.Chaja', 'Jewish', 'identity', 'never', 'been', 'real', 'significance', 'her.She', 'job', 'nanny', 'Chassidic', 'household.This', 'type', 'Jew', 'quite', 'different', 'Chaja.The', 'rules', 'are', 'stricter', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'difference', 'explored.The', 'parents', 'three', 'boys', 'Kalman', 'Isabella', 'Rosellini', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'hire', 'Chaja', 'help', 'household', 'Mr.Kalman', 'initially', 'opposed.The', 'youngest', 'son', 'Simcha', 'remained', 'mute', 'reason.Chaja', 'Simcha', 'form', 'bond', 'start', 'blossom', 'people', 'forged', 'new', 'generation.Edwin', 'Vries', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Krabbe', 'film', 'rather', 'directionless-The', 'Discovery', 'Heaven', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'LEFT', 'LUGGAGE', 'fact', 'film', 'released', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'titles', 'lot', 'disconnect', 'uncertainty', 'purpose', 'experienced', 'are', 'many', 'subplots', 'film', 'meandering', 'very', 'unfulfilling', 'sense', 'where', 'heart', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Sweden', 'film', 'title', 'translated', 'Little', 'Simcha', '-so', 'film', 'Simcha', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.In', 'Germany', 'film', 'audaciously', 'titled', 'Kalman', 'Nanny', 'Argentina', 'Love', 'rather', 'innocuously', 'Research', 'Past', 'French', 'Canada', 'fact', 'LEFT', 'LUGGAGE', 'bit', 'titles', 'not', 'specifically', 'one', 'them.Herein', 'rub', 'good', 'intentions', 'film', 'great', 'look', 'Holocaust', 'baggage', 'film', 'love', 'child', 'researching', 'past.You', 'will', 'learn', 'little', 'bits', 'lots', 'things', 'not', 'specifically', 'one.If', 'Chassidism', 'what', 'are', 'more', 'curious', 'suggestThe', 'Chosen.If', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'innumerable', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'LEFT', 'LUGGAGE.The', 'same', 'girl', 'coming', 'grips', 'heritage', 'WW2', 'American', 'Rhapsody', 'Devil', 'Arithmetic', 'orMusic', 'Box.I', 'would', 'have', 'echo', 'Newsday', 'critic', 'Gene', 'Seymour', 'frequently', 'moving', 'accenting', 'frequently', 'not', 'always.A', 'very', 'cautious', '3', 'stars']",N/A

This film gem certainly deserves a wider audience. It is a coming of age film that also pulls back the curtain on Jewish self hate and anti-Semitism. It is also about the power of love to transform and transcend.The film centers around a beautiful, free spirited, young woman in Antwerp, Belgium during the early nineteen seventies. A philosophy student and daughter of holocaust survivors (Maximilian Schell and Marianne Sagebrecht), Chaja (Laura Fraser) is in denial of her Jewish heritage and is totally secular in her approach to life. Her relationship with her parents, for whom she has little understanding, is strained. Struggling on her own, she is in need of a job. A friend of the family (Chaim Topol) hooks her up with a job lead, that of nanny for a Hassidic family, the Kalmans.Desperate for help with her household, Mrs. Kalman (Isabella Rossellini), who is at first hesitant upon meeting the nubile, pants clad Chaja, hires her as nanny for her three boys. Chaja, when confronted with the lifestyle of these ultra orthodox Jews, filled with rules so alien to her own life, hesitates in accepting the position. Her heart is stolen, however, by adorable four year old red head, Simcha Kalman (Adam Monty), whose heartbreaking smile causes her to accept the position. It marks the beginning of changes for both the Kalmans and Chaja.Through her developing affection for the shy Simcha and her relationship with Mrs. Kalman, she becomes accepting of her own Jewish identity and more understanding of her own parents idiosyncrasies, born as a result of being holocaust survivors. Chaja also learns how painful love can be, when tragedy touches her life in a way that she never envisioned. Trust me, when I say that the viewer will feel her pain, so poignant and profoundly moving is the pivotal, tragic event.This is simply a beautiful film. Isabella Rosellini gives a an exquisite and sensitive performance as the ultra orthodox wife and mother, Mrs. Kalman, who is trying to achieve harmony in a household steeped in traditions at odds with the outside world. It is no wonder that she won the Best Actress award at the Berlin Film Festival for her portrayal. Laura Fraser is a sensational and delightful breath of fresh air, luminous as the gorgeous young woman, Chaja, who is struggling with her Jewish identity and her discovery that life is not always a bed of roses.Chaim Topol is engaging as the kindly and wise family friend who quietly leads the way to Chaja's eventual embracement of her Jewish identity. Maximilian Schell and Marianne Sagebrecht are affecting as Chaja's parents and holocaust survivors, who live their lives under the torment of memories of long ago. Double kudos to Jeroen Krabbe for his wonderful direction of this film and for his fine portrayal of the uncompromising Mr. Kalman, whose personal tragedy broadens his understanding of lives not bound by the strictures of his own. Last, but not least, is the very adorable Adam Monty, whose portrayal of Simcha will break the viewer's heart.This is a superlative, internationally acclaimed film that should draw all those interested in other cultures and those who simply love a great film experience.

It also looks at the life of Chaja, a young assimilated Jewish girl, who becomes connected to her people through her connection with a Chassidic family for whom she works as a nanny.Although the film is clearly emotionally moving, particularly at the turning point, it is also intellectually stirring, as viewers are drawn to consider the meaning of virtue, community and survival.It is for that reason that I disagree with reviewers who are opposed to the film because of its nudity.  The filmmaker uses the nudity to juxtapose the values and culture of the general Belgian youth of the time to that of the conservative, religious values of the Kalman family.  The swimming scene appears immediately after a scene in the Kalman home.  It is shocking, both because of the content and because of the use of light (low lighting in the scene in the Kalman home, and a brightly lit day in the succeeding scene).I rented this movie, then bought it, and am considering buying a copy for a friend.

582860,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B00005JAB7,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[45, 46]","This film stayed with me long after the credits rolled.  Other reviewers have already summarized the basic plot, so I'll focus on what I see as some of the underlying themes.The date is 1972, the place is Antwerp, Belgium.  In other words, we are in Central Europe in the middle of the Vietnam era, which is also the post-Holocaust generation.  On the surface, the film is about personal encounters between several different types of Jews.  On a deeper level, it explores the various ways in which the Jewish people of that generation were attempting to cope with the cultural and emotional devastation of the Holocaust.Each character in the film is trying to recover their own ""left luggage"" -- the pieces of their pre-Holocaust past that will make them feel whole again.  For Chaya's father, the luggage is literally  two suitcases of family memorabilia that he buried during the war, and is now obsessed with finding again.  But. as his wife says, the ""left luggage"" is not really the old suitcases -- he is looking for himself.  Chaya's mother, in turn,  is dealing (or not dealing) with her memories of the Holocaust  through denial.  She attempts to live a ""normal"" life of going to the hairdresser, baking cakes, watering her houseplants --  but it comes across as tense and strained.Neither of Chaya's parents understands why their daughter does not come to visit more often.  On her part, Chaya feels totally disconnected from her parents' Jewishness.  She is more concerned with the anti-war movement on campus.Mr. Kalman (the Hasidic father) also lost his family during the Holocaust.  They were shot for refusing to spit on the Torah.  Now, he holds to the religious traditions of Hasidism as his lifeline to the past.  He expects his three sons to be Torah scholars who will carry on the family tradition, and is having difficulty accepting the fact that his four-year-old  son, Simchah, is a slow learner who has not yet begun to talk .  When Simchah  finally does say something (""Quack! Quack!""), Mrs. Kalman is delighted, but Mr. Kalman can only say, ""My son is saying quack-quack when he should be reciting the Four Questions at the seder?""  The father does not know how to love a son who is not a Torah scholar.It is Chaya, the secularized nanny, who finally brings little Simcha out of his shell and gets him to start talking.  Meanwhile, she has to come to grips with her own Jewish self-hate and the issue of antisemitism.  Up to this point, being Jewish has seemed irrelevant to her life, and she has been ""passing"" among her gentile friends.  Now she is confronted daily with an anti-semitic (if pathetic) elevator operator who goes out of his way to be nasty,  Nazi graffiti on the park benches, and a ""best friend"" from college who turns out to be prejudiced against Jews and makes tactless remarks when she finds out that Chaya is Jewish.I won't tell you any more, because that would spoil the film.  I will say is that  that this is a serious dramatic tragedy, not a comedy or an action film.  Come to it with an open, feeling  heart, and you cannot help but be moved.",5,"A hauntingly beautiful, serious tragedy",1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3095,"['film', 'stayed', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'summarized', 'basic', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'what', 'see', 'underlying', 'themes.The', 'date', '1972', 'place', 'Antwerp', 'Belgium', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'Central', 'Europe', 'middle', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'also', 'post-Holocaust', 'generation', 'surface', 'film', 'personal', 'encounters', 'several', 'different', 'types', 'Jews', 'deeper', 'level', 'various', 'ways', 'Jewish', 'people', 'generation', 'were', 'attempting', 'cope', 'cultural', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'Holocaust.Each', 'character', 'film', 'trying', 'recover', 'own', 'left', 'luggage', 'pieces', 'pre-Holocaust', 'past', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'whole', 'again', 'Chaya', 'father', 'luggage', 'literally', 'two', 'suitcases', 'family', 'memorabilia', 'buried', 'war', 'now', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'again', 'wife', 'left', 'luggage', 'not', 'really', 'old', 'suitcases', 'looking', 'Chaya', 'mother', 'turn', 'dealing', 'not', 'dealing', 'memories', 'Holocaust', 'denial', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'going', 'hairdresser', 'baking', 'cakes', 'watering', 'houseplants', 'tense', 'strained.Neither', 'Chaya', 'parents', 'why', 'daughter', 'not', 'come', 'visit', 'more', 'often', 'part', 'Chaya', 'totally', 'disconnected', 'parents', 'Jewishness', 'more', 'concerned', 'anti-war', 'movement', 'campus.Mr', 'Kalman', 'Hasidic', 'father', 'also', 'lost', 'family', 'Holocaust', 'were', 'shot', 'refusing', 'spit', 'Torah', 'Now', 'religious', 'traditions', 'Hasidism', 'lifeline', 'past', 'three', 'sons', 'be', 'Torah', 'scholars', 'who', 'will', 'carry', 'family', 'tradition', 'having', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'fact', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Simchah', 'slow', 'learner', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'begun', 'talk', 'When', 'Simchah', 'finally', 'say', 'something', 'Quack', 'Quack', 'Mrs.', 'Kalman', 'delighted', 'Mr.', 'Kalman', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'son', 'saying', 'quack-quack', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'reciting', 'Four', 'Questions', 'seder', 'father', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'love', 'son', 'who', 'not', 'Torah', 'scholar.It', 'Chaya', 'secularized', 'nanny', 'who', 'finally', 'little', 'Simcha', 'shell', 'start', 'talking', 'Meanwhile', 'come', 'grips', 'own', 'Jewish', 'self-hate', 'issue', 'antisemitism', 'Up', 'point', 'being', 'Jewish', 'seemed', 'irrelevant', 'life', 'been', 'passing', 'gentile', 'friends', 'Now', 'confronted', 'daily', 'anti-semitic', 'pathetic', 'elevator', 'operator', 'who', 'way', 'be', 'nasty', 'Nazi', 'graffiti', 'park', 'benches', 'best', 'friend', 'college', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'prejudiced', 'Jews', 'tactless', 'remarks', 'when', 'out', 'Chaya', 'Jewish.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'tragedy', 'not', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'Come', 'open', 'feeling', 'heart', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'moved']",N/A

It couldn't get any truer than that.It's about a couple of survivors of the camps. The woman is in denial and keeps herself bustling around her kitchen. The man is looking for a suitcase of lost mementos which he buried in the garden but cannot find because, well, things had been ever so meaningfully &quot;changed forever&quot;.Their daughter, Chaja, is an attractive woman in her 20s who wants to forget her bitter Jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations, having a romantic interest in a student rebel leader, and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging and eccentric parents. Turmoil happens when she loses her job, and goes to work as a nanny for a &quot;Hassidic&quot; family which claims to be ultra-orthodox (strict dress codes and all). Sad, sad things ensue.Apart from the wooden supporting cast (Chaja's dazed parents and the janitor villain are staid, one-dimensional characters) the movie is pushingly, gratingly, compellingly tragic. Several jabs at anti-semitism are hammered home continually.Which is my gripe. I left the movie with a feeling not of having watched a moving drama, but that of having sat through a lecture on Heritage and Angst. In a shot towards the end, when the father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage, one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past. That seems strange, since I thought that that was in fact what this film was supposed to be about.The prime aim here seems to have been to make the audience cry. And in that, it succeeds, big time.

This just a crude summary.Chaya is a 20 year-old philosophy student,  in 1972, in Antwerp, Belgium.  Her parents are both holocaust survivors.  Chaya&#65533;s father is obsessed with finding a suitcase that he buried, for safekeeping, over thirty years ago, just before he was interred by the Germans.  He had taken his most prized possessions and buried it in a friend&#65533;s backyard.  Now, he cannot find the location of the house.Chaya herself is not religious.  If anything she finds her Jewishness an annoyance.  Nevertheless, she takes a job working as a nanny for an Hassidic family.  She does not fit in at all, but Chaya bonds with one of the children in the family who happens to be slightly handicapped or learning disabled.The father of the Hassidic family is also a holocaust survivor.  In a very dramatic moment he shows Chaya the picture of the baby brother he lost in the holocaust.  The photo looks exactly like Chaya.Over time, Chaya develops an appreciation for her Jewishness and becomes sensitive to anti-semitism.  She does not become religious and is never accepted by the Hassidim.  I felt the doorman at the apartment building where Chaya worked and one of Chaya&#65533;s girlfriends were designed to illustrate different extremes of anti-semitism.The ending of the film is very literary/symbolic.

582863,A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,B00005JAB7,"Sunday ""SundayAtDusk""","[0, 0]","I had never even heard of this movie until 2005.  I was in the mood to see a Jewish movie, and then did what I always do...I went looking for a movie with Maximilian Schell. Interestingly, Max Schell, who was born Catholic, is in every one of my favorite Jewish movies, with the exception of ""Fiddler on the Roof"".Ah, he once again led me to a wonderful little movie. It is his search that gives the movie its name...he is looking for 2 pieces of luggage he buried in a backyard, before being sent to a concentration camp. His wife was also in a camp. And now in the early 1970s, they deal with their memories in very different ways; he wants to search for his left luggage; she does not want to think about the past at all.The movie, though, is mainly about their daughter, Chaja, who wants no part of Judaism, until she gets a job as a nanny in an Hasidic family. She was desperate for rent money. Isabella Rossellini, the Hasidic mother, was desperate for help with 5 children. It's a wonderful mix of humor and sadness, and the ending was a complete shock to me. I think it was great performances all around--Max Schell, Marianne Sagebrecht, Isabella Rossellini, Chaim Topol, Jeroen Krabbe, and Laura Fraser as Chaja--with her British accent.  (Yes, it's a wild mix of accents!)If your a duck park lover, the movie will seem especially special. And for me, it was also especially haunting when Chaja is staring at the photo of the Hasidic father's own father and little brother...and sees what she sees...because I believe we all have many lifetimes before we return to God. If you are someone who gets frightened or sick by graphic Holocaust memories or by anti-semitism, this movie is safe for you to view; nothing is graphic or truly frightening. It does have two scenes of nudity and some bad language, however, which keeps it from being a family movie, unless edited. So, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, because it would have been the perfect family movie without the profanity and nudity.Afterthoughts:  Maximilian Schell died February 1, 2014.",4,A Little Gem Of A Movie With Maximilian Schell . . . .,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,2058,"['had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'movie', '2005', 'was', 'mood', 'see', 'Jewish', 'movie', 'then', 'did', 'what', 'always', 'do', 'went', 'looking', 'movie', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Interestingly', 'Max', 'Schell', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Catholic', 'one', 'favorite', 'Jewish', 'movies', 'exception', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', '.Ah', 'once', 'again', 'led', 'wonderful', 'little', 'movie', 'search', 'movie', 'name', 'looking', '2', 'pieces', 'luggage', 'buried', 'backyard', 'being', 'sent', 'concentration', 'camp', 'wife', 'was', 'also', 'camp', 'now', 'early', '1970s', 'deal', 'memories', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'search', 'left', 'luggage', 'not', 'want', 'think', 'past', 'all.The', 'movie', 'mainly', 'daughter', 'Chaja', 'who', 'part', 'Judaism', 'job', 'nanny', 'Hasidic', 'family', 'was', 'desperate', 'rent', 'money', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Hasidic', 'mother', 'was', 'desperate', 'help', '5', 'children', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'humor', 'sadness', 'ending', 'was', 'complete', 'shock', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'Max', 'Schell', 'Marianne', 'Sagebrecht', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Chaim', 'Topol', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'Chaja', 'British', 'accent', 'Yes', 'wild', 'mix', 'accents', 'duck', 'park', 'lover', 'movie', 'will', 'seem', 'especially', 'special', 'was', 'also', 'especially', 'haunting', 'when', 'Chaja', 'staring', 'photo', 'Hasidic', 'father', 'own', 'father', 'little', 'brother', 'what', 'believe', 'have', 'many', 'lifetimes', 'return', 'God', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'frightened', 'sick', 'graphic', 'Holocaust', 'memories', 'anti-semitism', 'movie', 'safe', 'view', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'truly', 'frightening', 'have', 'two', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'however', 'being', 'family', 'movie', 'edited', 'So', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'family', 'movie', 'profanity', 'nudity.Afterthoughts', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'died', 'February', '1', '2014']",N/A
