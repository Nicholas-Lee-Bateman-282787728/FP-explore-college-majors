A unique story idea with believable characters that have believable faults and flaws.3. Dark humor.The con's1. Storytelling flaws. Including way out there and unbelievable plot points. Like Bunchy gettin over a million dollars from the Catholic church in 2013 from being molested in his youth. Statute limitations out the window.2. The &#34;fixes&#34; are very convenient.3. Minor spoiler. The priest that molested Bunchy is in the same city as he. The church just sent him a check knowing they're in the same city. Again plot convenient.4. Rays dad talks his way out of situations too frequently and too conveniently.5. Way too much time spent on his daughter's relationship with the kid from next door.6. Not enough time spent telling the stories of the more interesting characters.7. Very bad accents.  They try too hard to sound like there from South Boston.

1668808,A12XZDRL2IGI6X,B00EUI4XHE,"David in Telluride, Colorado","[0, 1]","This is a compelling and offbeat series with the terrific (stage and screen actor) Liev Schreiber in the title role, and Jon Voight as his father who was just released from prison after 20 years.  Breaks many conventions, not nearly as predictable as many feature films, and with rough language, rough action, and we think dialogue more real and believable than in many feature films or TV shows.Voight is perhaps best remembered for Midnight Cowboy in 1969, but actually won the Academy Award for Best Actor not for that, but for Coming Home in 1978 with Jane Fonda and Bruce Dern.  Today, he has considerable notoriety for very conservative politics and as the father of stunningly beautiful actress Angelina Jolie.  In any event, Voight is still a terrific actor.  (In recent years, he was particularly good in the film based on John Grisham's novel, The Rainmaker,"" with Matt Damon.  Worth a look!)Ray Donovan is a ""fixer"" in Hollywood.  He's closely associated here with a character played by Elliott Gould, who is always good.  Ray's wife Abby is played by Paula Malcomson, who is excellent in the role.  Also look for Steven ""Rocky"" Bauer, who played Al Pacino's impossibly handsome sidekick in Brian de Palma's Scarface, over thirty years ago.  Bauer is Ray Donovan's sidekick in this new series.As we don't currently have Showtime, we've been watching this on a modestly priced pay per view on Amazon over the 'net, streaming to our BluRay player, and from there onto an HD TV.

So hooked that binge-watch of entire season is necessary; more excited about watching this than Sunday night's latest episode of Game of Thrones, a dilemma I could not imagine ever occurring.Writing and story sparkle and snap with fresh.  Characters and how they're played are fascinating.  Shouting and clich&eacute;s are simply not necessary and very rarely used.  Audience is rarely made to suffer through over-dramatic acting.  The teenagers can become tedious, but that's true in real life as well.So, what's Ray Donovan about?  Ray Donovan is a fixer with a very small crew so trusted that few words are necessary to get the point across.  He's also a family man with the darkest of demons haunting him and his own siblings.  Was not a fan of Jon Voight, but the ease in which he inhabits the complete lack of conscience simply cannot be denied.  One favorite character is the female member of Donovan's crew; this woman is ridiculously cool and blew my mind; more than once she had me cheering YAY!All manner of killers, crazies, weaklings, predators, bullies and honest people cross Donovan's path; to become a voyeur of this madness is irresistible.

Ray Donovan is who you call if you're a pro basketball player who has woken up in bed with a dead girl or a major Hollywood star who has gotten caught, again, with, a transsexual hooker. Somehow these two problems end up canceling each other out in an outrageous way that actually makes a sick kind of sense. But the complications don't end at Ray's professional life, his personal life and the lives of his extended family are rife with problems. Ray(played by Liev Screiber) his wife are  working class transplants from Boston who play the Hollywood game at cocktail parties at their Calabasas home but they aren't above breaking the fingers of the man who has denied their daughter entrance into an exclusive private school.The major plot point revolves around the release and return of Ray's mobster father from prison back east. He is brilliantly played here by John Voigt and is out for retribution, It's Ray who helped put him away twenty years before. Complicating matters are Ray's three brothers. There's Terry, an ex-boxer with Parkinson's and Bunchy an alcoholic and survivor of sexual abuse. What is most interesting about these characters and series is the mix of the east coast mob/crime drama mixed with the modern world of money and celebrity. For all of Ray's sophistication, he's not above taking a bat to someone. I hate comparisons but it's a bit like Entourage crossed with Goodfellas.

If you are rich, a celebrity and live in LA you have Ray Donovan. He's a 'Fixer', that's his job, which made me wonder, how do you prepare for this kind of profession?Liv Schreiber plays Ray, a dark, brooding man who is called at all hours to fix someone's problems. He s employed by Goldman and Drexter, a law firm. This is a tough job, very physical, often employing guns and the like. Fists fly, threats are made. Often the situations are sexual in nature, and Ray knows how to fix everyone's problems. He has a staff who are the best at their work, and the insurance the law firm must have to cover them is probably in the millions.Ray has a family, wife, Abby,  played by Paula Malcomson, two children, a boy and girl. They are Boston Irish and all came to LA to hide from Ray's father, Mickey, played byJon Voight. The dysfunction in this family is like no other. Mickey is said to be responsible for his daughter's suicide, and has killed a Priest. It sounds like Mickey was part of the Boston Mafia. He went to prison for twenty years, and was let out early, ostensibly to rat on Ray for the FBI.  One happy family, once Mickey journeys to LA to join Ray's brothers at their boxing establishment.Each episode, and there are 12, opens with a client needing Ray's services. Ray and his wife are always on the 'outs', and he often stays in an apartment in LA. Abby, the wife, seems innocent of what kind of person Ray is, which is difficult to swallow. The biggest complaint I have is of Abby's false Boston accent, drives me crazy, it is so noticeable, and she is the only one who fakes the accent.The interaction between Ray and his father is often grim and turns personal at times. Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight are superb as father and son. Great acting and believable situations. Top notch writing makes this series one to watch. A second year was picked up recently, so Ray Donovan will be around.Recommended. prisrob 09-15-13",4,Everyone's Dysfunction,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2008,"['Ever', 'find', 'mess', 'wish', 'had', 'someone', 'help', 'out', 'are', 'rich', 'celebrity', 'live', 'LA', 'have', 'Ray', 'Donovan', ""'Fixer"", 'job', 'made', 'wonder', 'how', 'do', 'prepare', 'kind', 'profession', 'Liv', 'Schreiber', 'Ray', 'dark', 'brooding', 'man', 'who', 'called', 'hours', 'fix', 'someone', 'problems', 's', 'employed', 'Goldman', 'Drexter', 'law', 'firm', 'tough', 'job', 'very', 'physical', 'often', 'employing', 'guns', 'like', 'Fists', 'fly', 'threats', 'are', 'made', 'Often', 'situations', 'are', 'sexual', 'nature', 'Ray', 'how', 'fix', 'everyone', 'problems', 'staff', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'work', 'insurance', 'law', 'firm', 'must', 'have', 'cover', 'probably', 'millions.Ray', 'family', 'wife', 'Abby', 'played', 'Paula', 'Malcomson', 'two', 'children', 'boy', 'girl', 'are', 'Boston', 'Irish', 'came', 'LA', 'hide', 'Ray', 'father', 'Mickey', 'played', 'byJon', 'Voight', 'dysfunction', 'family', 'other', 'Mickey', 'said', 'be', 'responsible', 'daughter', 'suicide', 'killed', 'Priest', 'Mickey', 'was', 'part', 'Boston', 'Mafia', 'went', 'prison', 'twenty', 'years', 'was', 'let', 'out', 'early', 'ostensibly', 'rat', 'Ray', 'FBI', 'One', 'happy', 'family', 'once', 'Mickey', 'journeys', 'LA', 'join', 'Ray', 'brothers', 'boxing', 'establishment.Each', 'episode', 'are', '12', 'client', 'needing', 'Ray', 'services', 'Ray', 'wife', 'are', 'always', ""'outs"", 'often', 'apartment', 'LA', 'Abby', 'wife', 'innocent', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'Ray', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'have', 'Abby', 'false', 'Boston', 'accent', 'crazy', 'so', 'noticeable', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'accent.The', 'interaction', 'Ray', 'father', 'often', 'grim', 'personal', 'times', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'are', 'superb', 'father', 'son', 'Great', 'acting', 'believable', 'situations', 'Top', 'notch', 'writing', 'series', 'one', 'watch', 'second', 'year', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'recently', 'Ray', 'Donovan', 'will', 'be', 'around.Recommended', 'prisrob', '09-15-13']",Ray Donovan: The First Season

Sleaze is the name of the game here, as Liev Schreiber plays a Hollywood fixer (transplanted from the Irish slums of Boston) whose days are given over to brutally intimidating people with threat of violence in order to get celebrity movie stars out of sordid, potentially career-threatening jams.  How this never remotely attracts the attention of the police is never touched upon.  And the ""celebrity"" actors have about as much charisma as a pile of old newspapers.  Inexplicably, Jon Voight, portraying Ray's father, finds himself a participant in this trash.  And Eliot Gould occasionally wanders in and out of the plotline, a glum Jew looking like a deer caught in the headlights. To give you an idea of how debased this series is -- Ray Donovan actually hires someone to kill his own father, and himself kills a priest whom he accuses of having molested his brother when they were growing up in Boston.  The rest of the Donovans are equally low-class sleazy, including his lowlife brothers, who operate out of a seedy gym.  With characters this debauched, repulsive and debased, how are we supposed to care about them?  The series was apparently created by Ann Biderman, who cut her teeth writing for ""NYPD Blue"" back in the day.  The writing is very weak in terms of exposition -- it is impossible to discern Eliot Gould's relation to the Ray Donovan character, even after an entire season of episodes.  This should have been made clear from the get-go.  If you enjoy wallowing in gratuitous sleaze, this series is for you.
