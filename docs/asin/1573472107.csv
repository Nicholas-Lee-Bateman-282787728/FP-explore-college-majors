This version had some acceptable opening graphics and lots of well photographed, sexy girls performing stimulating erotic activities.  Twice, I had an overwhelming urge to go out and get a massage.

189208,A1JXP3E2RK4NXV,1573472107,Donald A. Ford,"[16, 20]",This is a pretty good second effort but I was dissapointed not to have seen more of Kara herself getting down. I also thought that the soundtrack was lacking. The music in the first film is much better. I also felt that even for the unedited directors version there werent enough hot scenes in the film. There was more story than the first one. Softcore usually has some of the best girl-girl scenes and this film dissapoints there. There was only one and it wasnt even very good. I say stick to number one!,3,Not as good as the fisrt one,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,507,"['pretty', 'good', 'second', 'effort', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Kara', 'getting', 'down', 'also', 'thought', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'lacking', 'music', 'first', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'also', 'felt', 'even', 'unedited', 'directors', 'version', 'there', 'werent', 'enough', 'hot', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'first', 'one', 'Softcore', 'usually', 'best', 'girl-girl', 'scenes', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'wasnt', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'say', 'stick', 'number', 'one']",N/A
