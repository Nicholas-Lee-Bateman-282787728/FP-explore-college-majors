761476,A3IVZV4GLD9QL7,B0000A2ZSN,Amanda,"[4, 5]","America's craziest family is back, and this time they're even funnier than the first season! I absolutely am addicted to this show. I can watch it over and over without ever getting sick of it. In an age where funny television shows are a dying breed, this one stands out from the rest of the reality tv/ comedy mush out right now. From Ozzy's battle to catch Moby Dick (um, fish don't like cheese, but whatever), to Kelly freaking out about her newfound fame, to Jack... well, being Jack, and of course Sharon (who at the time this season was taped was still battling cancer) who always just says whatever she wants (yay Sharon); this is a family that never ceases to have an interesting story to tell. They're the Beverly Hillbillies of the millennium (and I mean that in a nice way) - they have this balance of being just like any given American family - just as dysfunctional and crazy - only they have millions of dollars and cameras following their every move. It's basically the story of your family if your dad had been a 70's rock star.The DVD itself is mostly like the first one. It has all 10 episodes of the season plus the option to turn on commentary by Sharon and either Aimee, Kelly, Ozzy, or Sharon's 4th child, Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog. The commentary isn't remarkable, though if you've seen all of the episodes a billion times (like me) you can just switch it on for something different while you watch the episodes. They don't say much (Sharon mostly says ""I haven't seen this"" or ""Oh my g-d, I can't believe they put that in""). I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea to have Aimee do commentary because all she does is say how stupid her family is and criticize whatever she sees. Ozzy will occasionally mutter and say ""testing, testing,"" Kelly offers a few insights, and Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog will occasionally bark. There are a few 'bonus' clips of the family that were cut from the episodes, which are ok. There are a few games which are also mildly entertaining. The slightly amusing Ozzy translator (subtitles that can play during an episode whenever Ozzy speaks) is also back.The bottom line... this is one of the funniest shows on tv and a fun DVD to have around to pop in and watch when you're bored or just sick of watching all of those other 'reality' shows. I got my entire family hooked on it, even though they are about the last people you'd expect to enjoy watching a dysfunctional rock star family on tv... but it's a show that can appeal to all types.",5,"Crazy, but hey, that's how it goes...",1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,2503,"['America', 'craziest', 'family', 'back', 'time', ""'re"", 'even', 'funnier', 'first', 'season', 'absolutely', 'am', 'addicted', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'ever', 'getting', 'sick', 'age', 'where', 'funny', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'dying', 'breed', 'one', 'out', 'rest', 'reality', 'tv/', 'comedy', 'mush', 'right', 'now', 'Ozzy', 'battle', 'catch', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'um', 'fish', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cheese', 'Kelly', 'freaking', 'out', 'newfound', 'fame', 'Jack', 'well', 'being', 'Jack', 'course', 'Sharon', 'who', 'time', 'season', 'was', 'taped', 'was', 'still', 'battling', 'cancer', 'who', 'always', 'just', 'yay', 'Sharon', 'family', 'never', 'have', 'interesting', 'story', 'tell', ""'re"", 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'millennium', 'mean', 'nice', 'way', 'have', 'balance', 'being', 'just', 'given', 'American', 'family', 'just', 'dysfunctional', 'crazy', 'only', 'have', 'millions', 'dollars', 'cameras', 'following', 'move', 'basically', 'story', 'family', 'dad', 'had', 'been', '70', 'rock', 'star.The', 'DVD', 'mostly', 'first', 'one', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'option', 'turn', 'commentary', 'Sharon', 'Aimee', 'Kelly', 'Ozzy', 'Sharon', '4th', 'child', 'Mimi', 'Minnie', 'dog', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'remarkable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'billion', 'times', 'can', 'just', 'switch', 'something', 'different', 'watch', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'Sharon', 'mostly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Oh', 'g-d', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'put', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'Aimee', 'do', 'commentary', 'say', 'how', 'stupid', 'family', 'criticize', 'Ozzy', 'will', 'occasionally', 'mutter', 'say', 'testing', 'testing', 'Kelly', 'few', 'insights', 'Mimi', 'Minnie', 'dog', 'will', 'occasionally', 'bark', 'are', 'few', 'clips', 'family', 'were', 'cut', 'episodes', 'are', 'ok', 'are', 'few', 'games', 'are', 'also', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'Ozzy', 'translator', 'subtitles', 'can', 'play', 'episode', 'whenever', 'Ozzy', 'speaks', 'also', 'back.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'tv', 'fun', 'DVD', 'have', 'around', 'pop', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'bored', 'just', 'sick', 'watching', 'other', ""'reality"", 'shows', 'got', 'entire', 'family', 'hooked', 'even', 'are', 'last', 'people', ""'d"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'dysfunctional', 'rock', 'star', 'family', 'tv', 'show', 'can', 'appeal', 'types']",The Osbournes - The Second Season

It shouldn't be dismissed summarily.Despite the barrage of four-letter words.One of the things that comes across with crystal clarity is that this family really, truly, deeply loves each other. It's unquestionable and freshly without any sort of cynicism you see on pretty much every other reality show save ""Queer Eye"".Next, due to a combination of the magic of editing and the family's natural timing, this stuff is freakin' hysterical. Ozzy's comments on the pandemic dog poo situation, Sharon's frequently lacerating comments on popular culture, and the epic bickering between the two kids is recognized by anyone who has ever been a sibling, or given birth to them.The ability to censor the cursing is kinda fun. The bleeps are funny in their own way, when whole sentences seem to evaporate. But the unrestricted torrent of often-playful vulgarity is oh-so funny. When Ozzy berates the ocean...yes, the ocean...to quit encroaching on the fire he's trying to build in front of his Malibu home to cheer up the ill Sharon, I was giggling madly.He's as serious as a heart attack, which makes it all the funnier. He's not cursing the fact the water is trying to extinguish the fire; he's actually expecting  the waves to respond as he yells ""F off!""His idea to fish from the shore, using cheese as bait had me on the floor, because to Ozzy, it's common knowledge that ""fish love cheese.""Dismiss any prejudice you may have towards this show, and watch these ten episodes (plus outtakes).
