508154,ABQMVCJAKU5,B00000JT95,dannho,"[8, 9]",This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. Eric Roberts is a very goodactor stuck in a super long series of grade B or lower movies. Roberts is almostalways entertaining to watch even in the really bad ones. I can't say that aboutthis one. It's a decent story but every actor in it sleep walks through it. Robertsis too good an actor to be stuck in trash like this. There is very little I canrecommend about this flick.,1,not very good mafia movie,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,431,"['review', 'Amazon', 'VOD', 'rental', 'film', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'very', 'goodactor', 'stuck', 'super', 'long', 'series', 'grade', 'B', 'lower', 'movies', 'Roberts', 'almostalways', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'even', 'really', 'bad', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'aboutthis', 'one', 'decent', 'story', 'actor', 'sleep', 'walks', 'Robertsis', 'too', 'good', 'actor', 'be', 'stuck', 'trash', 'very', 'little', 'canrecommend', 'flick']",N/A

Getting in the right mood, however, will require at least half a bottle of scotch, or something stronger.  I always excuse the actors in a movie like this because I know enough actors to know that they're working people just trying to make a living and doing the best they can with the material they've been given.  It's the material, the writing, that I have no sympathy for in a movie like this. The script here is so poorly written it makes ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" look and sound like high concept cinematic art.  Watch at your own risk.  I'm giving it two stars because I did have some scotch on hand and it - the movie not the scotch - did, unintentionally I'm sure, make me laugh. I'd comment on the directing of the film but there wasn't any. :-)  LOL.

I have nt seen him since that movie. Another guy that should get much more work. Should have been on the Sopranos many times. In fact I cant believe Eric never did any cameos on the Sopranos. Id love to see him and Ralphie or him and Tony get into a beef, as Eric plays the bag man for  the NY  people. Eric carried this whole movie. He didnt over play his part as a lot of guys playing hit men would do. He is still in my opinion in the top 5 actors in Hollywood and in the 10 best of all time. But dont waste your time with this movie unless you really loved Good Fellas, Casino AND Eric Roberts. Its a B movie. In fact, other than sonny red, every mob guy in here had light brown hair. And beatles haircuts with bangs! Who did the casting? You mean they couldnt find 5 or 6 guys with olive skin and black hair?",2,Only Eric Roberts keeps you from falling asleep.,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,966,"['one', 'jewel', 'surprise', 'didnt', 'give', 'good', 'lines', 'work', 'sady', '34', 'Sonny', 'Red', '34', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'villain', 'movie', 'have', 'nt', 'seen', 'movie', 'guy', 'should', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'work', 'Should', 'have', 'been', 'Sopranos', 'many', 'times', 'fact', 'cant', 'believe', 'Eric', 'never', 'did', 'cameos', 'Sopranos', 'Id', 'love', 'see', 'Ralphie', 'Tony', 'get', 'beef', 'Eric', 'bag', 'man', 'NY', 'people', 'Eric', 'carried', 'whole', 'movie', 'over', 'play', 'part', 'lot', 'guys', 'playing', 'hit', 'men', 'would', 'do', 'still', 'opinion', 'top', '5', 'actors', 'Hollywood', '10', 'best', 'time', 'dont', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'really', 'loved', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Casino', 'AND', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'B', 'movie', 'fact', 'other', 'sonny', 'red', 'mob', 'guy', 'here', 'had', 'light', 'brown', 'hair', 'haircuts', 'bangs', 'Who', 'did', 'casting', 'mean', 'couldnt', 'find', '5', '6', 'guys', 'olive', 'skin', 'black', 'hair']",N/A
