996031,A1YHYWSQKVUNOR,B000FUF6XG,Bubbles,"[0, 0]","I read Naomi Judd's biography of the same name years ago and was delighted when they made a tv movie from the book.  I am even more excited that they have released it to DVD.  This story follows Naomi's biography fairly close and it is just a heartwarming story.  Thankfully Naomi and Wynonna did the singing voiceovers because it lent more emotion to the story.  The acting and the lip synching are fairly good, especially Kathleen York, the woman who plays the character of Naomi. She really seemed to have alot of the mannerisms that Naomi has.  Whether you are a Judd fan or not, it is likely that you will enjoy this movie.  It is simply made with not a lot of flash so it allows the story to be at the forefront.  It always makes me want to tell my Mom how much I love her and respect her for putting aside her own ambitions and needs in order to make my life a better one.",5,Good Movie!!,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,879,"['read', 'Naomi', 'Judd', 'biography', 'same', 'name', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'book', 'am', 'even', 'more', 'excited', 'have', 'released', 'DVD', 'story', 'Naomi', 'biography', 'fairly', 'close', 'just', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'Thankfully', 'Naomi', 'Wynonna', 'did', 'singing', 'voiceovers', 'lent', 'more', 'emotion', 'story', 'acting', 'lip', 'synching', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'especially', 'Kathleen', 'York', 'woman', 'who', 'character', 'Naomi', 'really', 'seemed', 'have', 'alot', 'mannerisms', 'Naomi', 'are', 'Judd', 'fan', 'not', 'likely', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'simply', 'made', 'not', 'lot', 'flash', 'story', 'be', 'forefront', 'always', 'want', 'tell', 'Mom', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'respect', 'putting', 'aside', 'own', 'ambitions', 'needs', 'order', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'one']",Love Can Build A Bridge

This movie has the viewer look into the life of the Judds off the stage. They had many problems with each other especially wynonna and Naomi, but it also shows the relationship between these two woman.
