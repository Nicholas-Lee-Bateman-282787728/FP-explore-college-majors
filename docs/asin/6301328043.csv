249907,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301328043,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 8]","Beautifully written, directed and acted, this film is a treasure as a piece of Americana, and though it may be an interpretation of history in parts, has enough truth in it to be relevant, and shows such things as the famous Lincoln-Douglas debate.Robert E. Sherwood wrote the screenplay based on his Pulitzer Prize winning play, and Raymond Massey, Howard Da Silva (Jack Armstrong), and Herbert Rudley (Seth Gale) re-create their stage roles.The direction by John Cromwell is superb, and James Wong Howe's cinematography (which was nominated for an Oscar but lost to ""Rebecca"") makes one forget that we are looking at a sixty-five year old film. Massey was also nominated, but lost to James Stewart in ""The Philadelphia Story""...1940 was certainly a good year for films.Raymond Massey (who was 34 at the time this film was made) has somehow been made to resemble Lincoln from youth to maturity, and the depth he brings to the part is very moving; I love the way his eyes slowly fill up with tears in his final speech as he leaves Illinois for the White House.Though the film presents a harsh portrait of Mary Todd Lincoln (brilliantly played by Ruth Gordon) who acknowledges she is seen as ""bitter and nagging"", there is no doubt that Mary was a huge part of Lincoln becoming who he was meant to be, and like every ""woman behind the man"" must have been a tough character in a petite form, the flint to start Lincoln's flame.Not to be missed by history buffs, and for Massey's marvelous performance, which he felt was his finest.

Wherever you purchase ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", you're getting a remarkable film!Whenever America has faced an inevitable crisis, it has turned to the life and words of Abraham Lincoln for guidance and comfort, as he faced, with courage, the greatest crisis in our nation's history, the Civil War. In 1938, with Japan expanding throughout the Far East, and Nazi Germany poised to conquer all of Europe, we were facing a moral, as well as political crisis; as neither country had threatened America, should we support our endangered allies, or remain a neutral observer? In this climate, playwright Robert Sherwood wrote ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", a three-act Broadway play that examined Lincoln's early life, his doomed love of Ann Rutledge and troubled marriage to Mary Todd, and his growth from a passive, semi-literate backwoodsman to an articulate new President, aware that his election would result in war and the deaths of thousands, perhaps millions, because of his stand against slavery. It was a powerful drama, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and became the signature role of Canadian actor Raymond Massey, who not only looked eerily like the 16th President, but, according to Lincoln's last surviving child, Robert, sounded like Lincoln, as well.As Max Gordon Plays & Pictures Corporation and RKO waited for the play's run to end, to film the screen adaptation, 20th Century Fox and John Ford produced their own film, 1939's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", starring Henry Fonda as a shy, likable Lincoln, and covering the same era, in a far different 'take'. With the RKO production released just eight months later, viewing audiences, bracing for war, had not one, but two Lincoln features to savor!Which version is 'better'? Most would say ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", with it's larger budget, stronger production values, John Ford's brilliant direction (at the peak of his most prolific period), and Fonda's more accessible portrayal. But there's a lot to be said for the RKO film! Director John Cromwell captures the rustic 'feel' of early America quite well, Ruth Gordon is unforgettable as a driven Mary Todd, and the famous Lincoln/Douglas debates are recreated quite accurately. Best of all, the film has Raymond Massey, whose Lincoln is more introspective and contemplative, and whose renowned wit fades into melancholy, as he sees what the future will hold for both his country and himself. With his striking resemblance, it remains, for many, the definitive Lincoln portrayal.I strongly recommend both films, and am pleased that ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" is finally available on DVD. I hope, at some point, a remastered version, with Special Features, will be produced, but at present, this 'no-frills' version will hold a proud spot in my DVD collection!",5,"Overpriced, but Stirring Biopic, with Massey's Unforgettable Portrayal...",1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,2903,"[""'ll"", 'find', 'far', 'less', 'expensive', 'editions', 'film', 'other', 'sites', 'prefer', 'Amazon', 'reliability', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'here', 'Wherever', 'purchase', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', ""'re"", 'getting', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Whenever', 'America', 'faced', 'inevitable', 'crisis', 'turned', 'life', 'words', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'guidance', 'comfort', 'faced', 'courage', 'greatest', 'crisis', 'nation', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', '1938', 'Japan', 'expanding', 'Far', 'East', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'poised', 'conquer', 'Europe', 'were', 'facing', 'moral', 'as', 'well', 'political', 'crisis', 'country', 'had', 'threatened', 'America', 'should', 'support', 'endangered', 'allies', 'remain', 'neutral', 'observer', 'climate', 'playwright', 'Robert', 'Sherwood', 'wrote', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'three-act', 'Broadway', 'play', 'examined', 'Lincoln', 'early', 'life', 'doomed', 'love', 'Ann', 'Rutledge', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'growth', 'passive', 'semi-literate', 'backwoodsman', 'articulate', 'new', 'President', 'aware', 'election', 'would', 'result', 'war', 'deaths', 'thousands', 'perhaps', 'millions', 'stand', 'slavery', 'was', 'powerful', 'drama', 'winning', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Drama', 'became', 'signature', 'role', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'looked', 'eerily', '16th', 'President', 'according', 'Lincoln', 'last', 'surviving', 'child', 'Robert', 'sounded', 'Lincoln', 'well.As', 'Max', 'Gordon', 'Plays', 'Pictures', 'Corporation', 'RKO', 'waited', 'play', 'run', 'end', 'film', 'screen', 'adaptation', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'John', 'Ford', 'produced', 'own', 'film', '1939', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'starring', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'shy', 'likable', 'Lincoln', 'covering', 'same', 'era', 'far', 'different', ""'take"", 'RKO', 'production', 'released', 'just', 'eight', 'months', 'later', 'viewing', 'audiences', 'bracing', 'war', 'had', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'Lincoln', 'features', 'savor', 'Which', 'version', ""'better"", 'Most', 'would', 'say', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'larger', 'budget', 'stronger', 'production', 'values', 'John', 'Ford', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'peak', 'most', 'prolific', 'period', 'Fonda', 'more', 'accessible', 'portrayal', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'RKO', 'film', 'Director', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'rustic', ""'feel"", 'early', 'America', 'quite', 'well', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'unforgettable', 'driven', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'famous', 'Lincoln/Douglas', 'debates', 'are', 'recreated', 'quite', 'accurately', 'Best', 'film', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Lincoln', 'more', 'introspective', 'contemplative', 'renowned', 'wit', 'fades', 'melancholy', 'what', 'future', 'will', 'hold', 'country', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'many', 'definitive', 'Lincoln', 'portrayal.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'films', 'am', 'pleased', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'hope', 'point', 'remastered', 'version', 'Special', 'Features', 'will', 'be', 'produced', 'present', ""'no-frills"", 'version', 'will', 'hold', 'proud', 'spot', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Weddell,"[0, 1]","I grew up at a time when there were separate federal holidays for the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and it seemed as if every year on Lincoln's birthday this film was shown on television.  I still think Raymond Massey's performance is definitive:  Daniel Day-Lewis was wonderful in the new &#34;Lincoln,&#34; but his Clintonesque whine of a voice grated on me.  And while I loved seeing Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, Ruth Gordon's performance in this film is breathtaking - I winced at the emotional power in the climactic scene where she has a confrontation with the husband she loves but nags like an unbearable harpy.  However, just as I hated the factual inaccuracy of the Connecticut vote in the Spielberg film:  Would the crowd in fact have been able to send Lincoln off on that train to the White House while singing &#34;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&#34;?

I found that it had no closed captioning which is one of the first things I look for when judging a film or television show: is it good enough for people to bother to let deaf people understand it?Also, I found many of the scenes and people dull and confusing.

Easy because we all know who he is and we also seem to all know what he has done, though we don't know how he came to that challenge of liberating the black slaves of the United States, because they were the slaves of the United States and not only of some southern planters. The very principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Consitution were at stake and that necessary endeavor concerned all Americans. But it is a lot more difficult than we may think because we must not fall in some trite and insignificant re-hash of all we know. So this film chooses to follow Abe Lincoln from the moment he leaves his family to the moment he leaves his state for Washington DC after having been elected. We thus follow his selfmademan career from the son of a poor settler to a successful lawyer and the President of the US. We follow how he decided to live with his people, with the people that were around him in his small city or town on the frontier of the wilderness. We follow how he became a selfless defender of others and the community. We follow how he wavered in front of the great task of getting involved in the liberation of the slaves because he did not have the ambition to become a leader though he would learn how to assume his responsibility in society, how to become an involved citizen, and that would lead him to accepting a task he did not like at all from the very start. And sure enough he captured the votes of the people and their imagination with his call for a unified American house founded on the basic principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Consitution. He appeared as the one who defended liberty, equality and their concrete everyday texture that is called the freedom and equality of all men beyond their differences, and also the right to strike in order to defend one's living conditions, and the right to fight and even change the constitution if this is in the best interest of the people, at least the way they see it, though this constitution does not have to change because it can be improved any time it is necessary, and if so decide the people.

RKO had to contend with a rather chipper Henry Fonda as Abe the year before so they decided to go with deep depression.

Massey's co-stars Gene Lockhart as Stephen Douglas & Ruth Gordon as Mary are fine. The rest of the cast rather uneven. They deliver lines as if they are in a play. The movie darkens after the great love of Lincoln's life, Anne Rutledge, dies. He climbs into a hole of despair & never crawls out. Mary is also a definite downer. She drives the sometimes unwilling Abe to her goal: the presidency for her husband. When they finally win she becomes very unhappy accusing him of spoiling her victory.

Ruth Gordon was acceptable as Mary Todd, and her shrewish nature boils to the surface towards the end. Howard Da Silva was certainly amusing as Jack Armstrong; the leader of the Clarey Grove boys. Another chuckle comes from Lincoln's attempts to drill the local militia in preparation for the Black Hawk War. Lincoln had forgotten the command to bring the line into file in order to pass through a gate. Lincoln asks Armstrong what to do and Jack replies, ""Don't ask me, I'm only the sergeant"".

Abe says,I'll remember ma,good bye and his mother says good bye dear abe.This is a very endearing scene that provides early on an idea about character,love,and the world that we knew.A very fine film worth many viewings and a permanent place in any video library.",5,Is there a debate?,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,2409,"['dont', 'think', 'reader', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'watch', 'film.The', 'performance', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'definitive', 'portrayal', 'life', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'film', 'provided', 'even', 'inspiration', 'years', 'have', 'known', 'film.It', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'separate', 'what', 'know', 'movie', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'what', 'portrayed', 'film.However', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'reviews', 'are', 'suppose', 'go', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'more', 'importent', 'time', 'last', '500', 'years', 'time', 'when', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'elected', 'president', 'strove', 'provide', 'kind', 'leadership', 'was', 'so', 'endearing', 'hearts', 'people', 'perhaps', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'president', 'was', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln.I', 'sincerely', 'beleive', 'hardly', 'been', 'greater', 'contribution', 'made', 'then', 'service', 'offered', 'country', 'president', 'point', 'time.I', 'think', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'great', 'president', 'perhaps', 'none', 'other', 'knew', 'peril', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'million', 'soldiers', 'faught', 'thousand', 'mile', 'front.This', 'almost', 'perhaps', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'greater', 'abe', 'lincoln', 'dont', 'think', 'better', 'film', 'well.I', 'truly', 'would', 'recommend', 'wishing', 'worthwhile', 'moviegoing', 'experience.This', 'now', 'record', 'such', 'rich', 'fertile', 'territory', 'many', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'information', 'available', 'thru', 'literature', 'videos', 'perhaps', 'most', 'influential', 'institution', 'higher', 'learning', 'college', 'just', 'picture', 'alone', 'even', 'entertaining', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'answers', 'footsteps', 'were', 'they.Abe', 'Lincoln', 'walked', 'midnight', 'even', 'now', 'terrible', 'swift', 'sword', 'way', 'coming', 'Lord.In', 'lovely', 'film', 'early', 'Abe', 'Lincolns', 'mother', 'leave', 'home', 'could', 'not', 'loved', 'anymore', 'then', 'were', 'own', 'son', 'Abe', 'will', 'be', 'thanking', 'always', 'ma', 'great', 'kindness', 'wherever', 'go', 'do', 'remember', 'what', 'good', 'book', 'world', 'away', 'do', 'will', 'God', 'forever', 'Abe', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'ma', 'good', 'bye', 'mother', 'good', 'bye', 'abe.This', 'very', 'endearing', 'scene', 'early', 'idea', 'character', 'love', 'world', 'knew.A', 'very', 'fine', 'film', 'many', 'viewings', 'permanent', 'place', 'video', 'library']",N/A
