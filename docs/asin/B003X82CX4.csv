1370154,A3NI800P6Q6YNS,B003X82CX4,Matthew J. Gallagher,"[14, 14]","""Hand in Hand"" will never be forgotten for those who were fortunate enough to see it during the 1960's and 1970's when it was played often on CBS in several of their children's series. Like others, I've been looking for it for years. Superbly written, beautifully played, most especially by the two children, this story of religous doctrines - and prejudice - separting and dividing people from their true and loving natures has seldom been better rendered in book or film. The only false notes, and they are minor, are struck by the adult actors, who are ""acting,"" while the two lead children are simply ""being."" And the ending, while touching, would have been stronger if the final shot was of the two children, not the adults, but these are minor distractions from a classic story of innocence confronting the harsh, adult world, and trying to make sense of it.  What comes across most strongly is the honestly played love between this boy and girl - both of them talented in singing, in their use of imagination, and in their tender understanding of the world and their willingness to make their love endure, despite the obstacles. Their adventures together, from building a house, hitchhiking to see the Queen (when children could roam free without fear), to sailing to Africa, much of it in thier imagination, are poignantly and honestly rendered. ""Fancy fearing that man,"" the girl says to the boy, remarking on an older man, who they had supposed was nasty, but turns out to be a kind, wise soul. ""Fancy fearing anyone,"" the boy replies.  The lessons of this small masterpiece could not be plainer, but what is ultimately the greatest part of this beautiful film is the tender and strong love of these two special childen.  A five star must!  A classic for the ages!",5,"A beautiful, humane small masterpiece - with two of the greatest performances by children in any film - ever",1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,1774,"['Hand', 'Hand', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'who', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', '1960', '1970', 'when', 'was', 'played', 'often', 'CBS', 'several', 'children', 'series', 'others', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'years', 'Superbly', 'written', 'beautifully', 'played', 'most', 'especially', 'two', 'children', 'story', 'religous', 'doctrines', 'prejudice', 'separting', 'dividing', 'people', 'true', 'loving', 'natures', 'seldom', 'been', 'better', 'rendered', 'book', 'film', 'only', 'false', 'notes', 'are', 'minor', 'are', 'struck', 'adult', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'acting', 'two', 'lead', 'children', 'are', 'simply', 'being', 'ending', 'touching', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'final', 'shot', 'was', 'two', 'children', 'not', 'adults', 'are', 'minor', 'distractions', 'classic', 'story', 'innocence', 'confronting', 'harsh', 'adult', 'world', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'What', 'across', 'most', 'strongly', 'honestly', 'played', 'love', 'boy', 'girl', 'talented', 'singing', 'use', 'imagination', 'tender', 'understanding', 'world', 'willingness', 'make', 'love', 'endure', 'obstacles', 'adventures', 'together', 'building', 'house', 'hitchhiking', 'see', 'Queen', 'when', 'children', 'could', 'roam', 'free', 'fear', 'sailing', 'Africa', 'much', 'thier', 'imagination', 'are', 'poignantly', 'honestly', 'rendered', 'Fancy', 'fearing', 'man', 'girl', 'boy', 'remarking', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'supposed', 'was', 'nasty', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'wise', 'soul', 'Fancy', 'fearing', 'anyone', 'boy', 'replies', 'lessons', 'small', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'plainer', 'what', 'ultimately', 'greatest', 'part', 'beautiful', 'film', 'tender', 'strong', 'love', 'two', 'special', 'childen', 'five', 'star', 'must', 'classic', 'ages']",Hand in Hand
1370155,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,B003X82CX4,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[1, 1]","Isn't it nice to see this little gem released to home video after 50-plus years?  Like most reviewers here I saw ""Hand in Hand"" long ago as part of the children's film festival series on TV (thank you, Kukla, Fran, and Ollie!)  and the memories have never left. It's a charmer, telling a poignant tale sweetly and without pretense, a small masterpiece of British cinema from a simpler age.  The two children carry the film like seasoned pros without any pretension or preaching and the values and message imparted are timeless ones of love, loyalty, and tolerance.  Quality stories like this ought to have a wider distribution and profile (what an ideal school movie), but at least this DVD might rescue it from obscurity for an audience that needs it now more than ever.  The DVD quality is very high despite a lack of bonus features (I'm sorry the grown-up actors weren't given a chance to add a commentary track), glorious sharp black and white photography and a snapshot of a departed time of pre-decimal currency, Latin mass,  and leafy English suburbia.  ""Hand in Hand"" deserves every award it ever received and I advise viewers to buy the DVD  while they can, it looks to be going out of print again very soon.Note: the Amazon editorial review is wrong in implying this is an American movie or an American setting. It is English.Now if only the equally well-remembered and beloved ""Skinny and Fatty"" from the same series would finally see a home video release!

1370157,A315WMPERH1S0Z,B003X82CX4,Tee,"[31, 31]","HAND IN HAND is a charming, moving little British drama from 1960 that enjoyed it's greatest popularity in America several years later for it's multiple runs on THE CBS CHILDREN'S FILM FESTIVAL during the late 60's and 70's.  Few kids who saw it during this era ever forgot the movie even if they forgot the film's name, it's one of the most involving dramas ever made for children.This movie is about Michael, a young Catholic boy, and Rachel, a young Jewish girl, who become the best of friends but whose closeness is threatened by the intolerence of some of the people in their world.  A major breach comes when Michael hears that the Jewish people ""killed Christ"" and both come to believe God Himself is against their friendship but their bond is strong and ultimately each of them dares to visit the other's house of worship.  The duo's adventures include a comic road trip in pursuit of Queen Elizabeth and a harrowing rubber raft ride.The child stars Loretta Parry and Philip Needs are excellent and there's a wonderful cameo by Dame Sybil Thorndyke as a wealthy matron who befriends them.
