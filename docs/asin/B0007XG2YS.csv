893814,A2UALOIFBDOI60,B0007XG2YS,Adam Chen,"[4, 11]","When I first looked at this television series, I had no idea it was an old remake. That's how good it is. To me, it embodies the truth of simple morality without the general feeling of reluctance to mention such 'moral feelings' out loud or in public.This distinction allows it to be safetly kept in the form of a media for inner scrutiny. The inability to speak the truth at the end, and the Control Voice is very appealing and uncertain. I find myself to this day disagreeing wholeheartedly with all that the Outer Limits has to say and being astounded at the same time with my inner recognition: that I am not alone.In my discovery, I find that disagreeing with all of these episodes is better than shunning them entirely. How can you rate the quality of shows based on morality? Isn't it your imagination? For example, the ones on sex cater to women only. If you're a man, you need to learn to think like a woman. Women think almost entirely of sex as power, and to contemplate that in mysterious ways would make you very jealous. Jealousy is a powerful emotion. It is an ingredient to suffering. Can sexual attraction be suffering? The other aspects of these series is that they deal mostly with aliens or technology. If they had more subjects to deal with, that would open your mind, would it not? I borrowed these series from my local video store and have yet to buy them. I must admit, I will still say that even when I own them. It is like pure embarrassment that keeps me closer to the truth! I'd say that's well worth the moral investment.Some episodes are pure fascination, some are mundane, but I've found I cannot stop thinking about these episodes! Even the most stupid ones like the sex ones with Alyssa Milano for instance have kept me captivated. There is a story about a man who invents a machine that once it gets activated will turn him into anything he wishes to be. This story continues forever. That's the synopsis for every Outer Limits episode.

893819,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0007XG2YS,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 10]","I am going to differ with many of my fellow reviewers regarding the format here:  I have long enjoyed the series 'Outer Limits', both the old series and the new series, but was not sure if I would ever find the means to collect all of the seasons.  Perhaps it is because many of my favourite episodes are to be found in this collection that I don't mind the topical selection method, but it does serve to give a good overview of the several years of the new 'Outer Limits' series.There are six discs in this collection, each with six episodes, arranged around a theme - transformation/mutation, time travel, android/robots, aliens in the world, death/afterlife, and sex in science fiction; thus, 36 one-hour episodes in all (well over a whole season's offerings).  My favourite episodes include 'I, Robot', starring Leonard Nimoy (derivative of an Isaac Asimov idea), 'The Grell' (which highlights issues of xenophobia and community inclusion in a unique way), and 'Human Operators' (with the voice of Malcolm McDowell, who gives a stellar performance without ever being on screen).The original series of the 'Outer Limits' was a groundbreaking television production, testing limits and innovating ways of adapting to the still relatively new medium of television.  The new series has much better production values, but apart from the occasional nudity (which is censored for broadcast, but was preserved on the original cable offering and again on DVD format), the series is no longer an innovative one - most of the stories seem at home on the screen, and while they are interesting, they don't break new ground.  Perhaps that is indicative of how much both public awareness and entertainment has progress in the past generation.Each DVD has extras, including featurettes for the episodes and a more general topical feature discussing the origins of the series.  The menu are user friendly and logically oriented.  The one drawback I have seen is that a few of the double-sided DVDs have problems playing on my DVD player some of the time.  There are skips, freezes and a few other glitches that occasionally (but not frequently) manifest; while pausing and repeating usually clears these problems, it is not ideal.  This has only happened on two episodes.There are a few episodes I wish had been included:  'Origin of Species', the part-two episode of 'Double Helix', would have been a welcome inclusion.  My list of what I would also like to have could go on and on, and in the fullness of time I am likely to acquire the complete series (at which time this set of topically arranged DVDs will make a good gift for a friend).  Until that time, I am happy to have so many episodes of the series in this creatively arranged collection.Do not adjust your set...",4,Highlights and insights,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2762,"['am', 'going', 'differ', 'many', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'format', 'here', 'have', 'long', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Limits', 'old', 'series', 'new', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'ever', 'find', 'means', 'collect', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'many', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'topical', 'selection', 'method', 'serve', 'give', 'good', 'overview', 'several', 'years', 'new', 'Limits', 'series.There', 'are', 'six', 'discs', 'collection', 'six', 'episodes', 'arranged', 'theme', 'transformation/mutation', 'time', 'travel', 'android/robots', 'aliens', 'world', 'death/afterlife', 'sex', 'science', 'fiction', 'thus', '36', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'well', 'whole', 'season', 'offerings', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'include', 'Robot', 'starring', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'derivative', 'Isaac', 'Asimov', 'idea', 'Grell', 'issues', 'xenophobia', 'community', 'inclusion', 'unique', 'way', 'Operators', 'voice', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'stellar', 'performance', 'ever', 'being', 'screen', 'original', 'series', ""'Outer"", 'Limits', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'television', 'production', 'testing', 'limits', 'innovating', 'ways', 'adapting', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', 'medium', 'television', 'new', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'values', 'apart', 'occasional', 'nudity', 'censored', 'broadcast', 'was', 'preserved', 'original', 'cable', 'offering', 'again', 'DVD', 'format', 'series', 'no', 'longer', 'innovative', 'one', 'most', 'stories', 'seem', 'home', 'screen', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'Perhaps', 'indicative', 'how', 'much', 'public', 'awareness', 'entertainment', 'progress', 'past', 'generation.Each', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'featurettes', 'episodes', 'more', 'general', 'topical', 'feature', 'discussing', 'origins', 'series', 'menu', 'are', 'user', 'friendly', 'logically', 'oriented', 'one', 'drawback', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'have', 'problems', 'playing', 'DVD', 'player', 'time', 'are', 'skips', 'freezes', 'few', 'other', 'glitches', 'occasionally', 'not', 'frequently', 'manifest', 'pausing', 'repeating', 'usually', 'problems', 'not', 'ideal', 'only', 'happened', 'two', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'included', ""'Origin"", 'Species', 'part-two', 'episode', ""'Double"", 'Helix', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'inclusion', 'list', 'what', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'have', 'could', 'go', 'fullness', 'time', 'am', 'likely', 'acquire', 'complete', 'series', 'time', 'set', 'topically', 'arranged', 'DVDs', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'gift', 'friend', 'time', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'series', 'creatively', 'arranged', 'collection.Do', 'not', 'adjust', 'set']",N/A

893832,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0007XG2YS,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[11, 13]","I've always liked The Outer Limits. The old series, despite its relatively low budget and cheesy special effects, was a gem. The new one had much better special effects, and the stories were, by and large,very good. I realize, this stage in my life, how valuable stories can be.But, first, on each DVD is an introduction. It's a noisy announcement, complete with lightning-fast graphics, that shows that's it's a criminal offense to download films, etc. from the web. If I were inclined to download the same, that announcement wouldn't discourage me from doing so. Since I consider ""high speed internet"" an extravagance, I'm not inclined to do so. So the ""announcement"" is particularly obnoxious.Next, the series, like any, had its ups and downs. But I like most of them. Among the ironies of my giving this series only two stars is that a few of my favorites are in the set. I really like ""Afterlife"" with Clancy Brown. ""Relativity Theory"" is a great political/economic commentary with which I agree. ""Gettysburg"" is excellent. And there are others. But they should have released the series based on the season, like they did with the old one. As it turns out, they did later. So I'm getting duplicates, of some I didn't even like that much!And that leads to one episode that I didn't like. Unfortuntely I can't recall the title now. But I dislike it because all they did is take clips from earlier episodes and try to make a new episode out of it.  That seldom works. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" tried it once or twice and it didn't work for them either.Finally--and this is as much my fault as those who're selling the series--a few of the sets were released before. So I already have ""Sex and Science Fiction"" (see my review here on Amazon.com) and ""Time Travel and Infinity."" They simply should have released the series by the year. By now, I assume I'd already have probably the first three years. And I needn't have purchased duplicates.If you get this set, anticipate the long announcement at the beginnning of each side of each DVD. No fun.If I were you, I'd get the sets based on the seasons.

893835,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0007XG2YS,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 9]","While ""The Outer Limits-The New Series"" had a number of fine moments, the series could be extremely inconsistent. The finest episodes of the new series could compare favorably to the best of the original show. MGM has chosen to release a series of themed DVDs as opposed to the entire seasons. I'm not going to dive into the controversay about the way this is being released but focus on the quality of the episodes, transfer and extras.The weakest set is ""Sex & Science Fiction"" and played to the peeping tom in the audience by combining the science fiction elements of the original show with nudity and four letter words. The best episode on the ""Sex"" set is ""The Human Operators"". That's not to say that the rest of the episodes are particularly bad; they're not they just don't share the ""sense of awe"" of the original series. You do get Alyssa Milano nude though as a compensation for the guys out there.""Aliens Among Us"" features a number of terrific episodes including the classic ""Quality of Mercy"". Robert Patrick plays a soldier taken captive by a race of reptilian aliens that Earth is at war with. He's put in with a cadet (Nicole DeBoer)who is gradually being turned into one of the aliens as part of some sort of bizarre experiment. ""Afterlife"" features Clancy Brown as a man wrongly convicted of murder who is given the choice of death by lethal injection or participation in a biological experiment by the military. He chooses the latter but doesn't know that he's being biologically transformed into something else. ""The Grell"" and ""Realtivity Theory"" both touch on a number of fascinating themes as well.""Death and Beyond"" features a number of strong episodes including Alan Brennart's suspenseful and moving ""The Second Soul"" which has much in common with the best that Joseph Stefano, Leslie Stevens and Harlan Ellison contributed to the series. A dying race contacts Earth asking for help. They don't want technology; they want our dead. The aliens want to reanimate them with their own ""souls"". ""The Second Soul"" asks a lot of complex questions, addresses bigotry without a heavy handed approach and creates much suspense. The performances by Rae Dawn Chong and Mykelti Williamson are strong and Brennart's (who wrote some of the finest episodes of the 80's ""Twilight Zone"" and is a novelist of note)script touches on the spirit of the original show.""A Stitch in Time""by Steven Barnes features Amanda Plummer as a scientist who is linked to a series of murders the oldest of which occurred 30 years ago only she was a child at the time. An FBI agent (Michelle Forbes) finally begins to put the pieces together when she discovers where the research led. ""Tribunal"" and ""Deja Vu"" both are worthwhile episodes as well. In ""Tribunal"" an attorney discovers a way to bring a Nazi war criminal to justice by snatching him from the past. Unfortunately, his decision has some nasty consquences.""Fantastic Robots and Androids"" has a couple of wortwhile episodes as well. I wasn't impressed with the remake of ""I Robot"" from the original series but ""Glitch"" touches on Philip K. Dick territory in a story about a man who discovers he's an android designed to assassinate people. ""The Camp"" where the last humans are herded into concentration camps by andriods left behind from an alien invasion.Each disc has a number of featurettes about the series with interviews featuring original series producer/writer/co-creator Joseph Stefano, producer/writer Pen Densholm who revived the series for MGM and Showtime. There's also documentaries/featurettes about various episodes as well.The drawbacks are few but significant. The transfers here for many of these episodes contain quite a bit of video noise and the transfers aren't always the best either. The quality of the writing and performances make this worthwhile even if MGM has dropped the ball on many of these episodes. The ""Aliens"" set in particular has quite a few flaws in this area. A pet peeve of mine is when studios fail to put chapter stops after the opening logos so you can skip them  and get right to the episode. On the earlier sets MGM did a fine job with this on the later sets (such as ""Aliens"") they put the chapter stops at some of the most bizarre moments.Overall, this is an exceptional series. It may not have been as ground breaking as the original series but many of the finest episodes were the equal of the best from the original series. Like the 80's version of ""The Twilight Zone"" ""The New Outer Limits"" may not have always captured the flare and power of the original but that doesn't diminish the importance of this series.",4,Giving up control of your television set...,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,4615,"['Outer', 'Limits-The', 'New', 'Series', 'had', 'number', 'fine', 'moments', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'extremely', 'inconsistent', 'finest', 'episodes', 'new', 'series', 'could', 'compare', 'favorably', 'best', 'original', 'show', 'MGM', 'chosen', 'release', 'series', 'themed', 'DVDs', 'opposed', 'entire', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'dive', 'controversay', 'way', 'being', 'released', 'focus', 'quality', 'episodes', 'transfer', 'extras.The', 'weakest', 'set', 'Sex', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'played', 'peeping', 'tom', 'audience', 'combining', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements', 'original', 'show', 'nudity', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'best', 'episode', 'Sex', 'set', 'Human', 'Operators', 'not', 'say', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'particularly', 'bad', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'sense', 'awe', 'original', 'series', 'do', 'get', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'nude', 'compensation', 'guys', 'out', 'there', 'Aliens', 'Us', 'number', 'terrific', 'episodes', 'including', 'classic', 'Quality', 'Mercy', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'soldier', 'taken', 'captive', 'race', 'reptilian', 'aliens', 'Earth', 'war', 'put', 'cadet', 'Nicole', 'DeBoer', 'who', 'gradually', 'being', 'turned', 'one', 'aliens', 'part', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'experiment', 'Afterlife', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'man', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'murder', 'who', 'given', 'choice', 'death', 'lethal', 'injection', 'participation', 'biological', 'experiment', 'military', 'latter', ""n't"", 'know', 'being', 'biologically', 'transformed', 'something', 'else', 'Grell', 'Realtivity', 'Theory', 'touch', 'number', 'fascinating', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'Death', 'Beyond', 'number', 'strong', 'episodes', 'including', 'Alan', 'Brennart', 'suspenseful', 'moving', 'Second', 'Soul', 'much', 'common', 'best', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'Leslie', 'Stevens', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'contributed', 'series', 'dying', 'race', 'contacts', 'Earth', 'asking', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'technology', 'want', 'dead', 'aliens', 'want', 'reanimate', 'own', 'souls', 'Second', 'Soul', 'lot', 'complex', 'questions', 'addresses', 'bigotry', 'heavy', 'handed', 'approach', 'much', 'suspense', 'performances', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'are', 'strong', 'Brennart', 'who', 'wrote', 'finest', 'episodes', '80', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'novelist', 'note', 'script', 'touches', 'spirit', 'original', 'show', 'Stitch', 'Time', 'Steven', 'Barnes', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'scientist', 'who', 'linked', 'series', 'murders', 'oldest', 'occurred', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'was', 'child', 'time', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'finally', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'when', 'where', 'research', 'led', 'Tribunal', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'episodes', 'well', 'Tribunal', 'attorney', 'way', 'bring', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'justice', 'snatching', 'past', 'Unfortunately', 'decision', 'nasty', 'consquences', 'Fantastic', 'Robots', 'Androids', 'couple', 'wortwhile', 'episodes', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'remake', 'Robot', 'original', 'series', 'Glitch', 'touches', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'territory', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'android', 'designed', 'assassinate', 'people', 'Camp', 'where', 'last', 'humans', 'are', 'herded', 'concentration', 'camps', 'andriods', 'left', 'behind', 'alien', 'invasion.Each', 'disc', 'number', 'featurettes', 'series', 'interviews', 'featuring', 'original', 'series', 'producer/writer/co-creator', 'Joseph', 'Stefano', 'producer/writer', 'Pen', 'Densholm', 'who', 'revived', 'series', 'MGM', 'Showtime', 'also', 'various', 'episodes', 'well.The', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'few', 'significant', 'transfers', 'here', 'many', 'episodes', 'contain', 'quite', 'bit', 'video', 'noise', 'transfers', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'either', 'quality', 'writing', 'performances', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'MGM', 'dropped', 'ball', 'many', 'episodes', 'Aliens', 'set', 'particular', 'quite', 'few', 'flaws', 'area', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'when', 'studios', 'fail', 'put', 'chapter', 'stops', 'opening', 'so', 'can', 'skip', 'get', 'right', 'episode', 'earlier', 'sets', 'MGM', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'later', 'sets', 'such', 'Aliens', 'put', 'chapter', 'stops', 'most', 'bizarre', 'moments.Overall', 'exceptional', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'ground', 'breaking', 'original', 'series', 'many', 'finest', 'episodes', 'were', 'equal', 'best', 'original', 'series', '80', 'version', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'New', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'always', 'captured', 'flare', 'power', 'original', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'importance', 'series']",N/A
