409861,A1LR6W5Q4U32ZW,6304252137,Alyson Montemagno,"[1, 1]","I realize this isn't actually a 5 star movie, but the acting by both Tim Roth and Julia Ormond was excellent and their chemistry amazing.  The premise didn't make much sense, a female dentist working in a prison and why at the beginning, this job was so important to her.  She was insecure as her husband had cheated on her and Philip Chaney (Roth) was in prison for killing his wife for the same reason.She still continued to love and trust him, even after the truth became known to her.He was lonely, desolate, isolated and yearning for female contact.  Their rapport and connection was immediate and I would like to think his actions were beyond his control and he was seeking redemption.  I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie for the marvelous acting and their relationship.  The way he looked at her at the end, when he said that he'd go to the Governor and protect her, was so moving and sincere.Should he, who was so insecure and yearning for love, be trusted by her, I don't know.  Personally, I'd be very leery as he committed murder out of jealousy.  Could he have changed during those 10 years of isolation.  He appeared so, sweet, kind, empathetic and understanding, but there was a violent side to him.  She felt dreadfully betrayed and violated, losing trust for her husband.  Philip was there attentive, witty, attractive and intelligent and doting on her.  I'd like to think her trust in him wouldn't be an error but I might be as vulnerable as she was.  She was mesmerized by him.",5,Illicit Love,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1513,"['realize', ""n't"", 'actually', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'acting', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'was', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'amazing', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'female', 'dentist', 'working', 'prison', 'why', 'beginning', 'job', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'was', 'insecure', 'husband', 'had', 'cheated', 'Philip', 'Chaney', 'Roth', 'was', 'prison', 'killing', 'wife', 'same', 'reason.She', 'still', 'continued', 'love', 'trust', 'even', 'truth', 'became', 'known', 'her.He', 'was', 'lonely', 'desolate', 'isolated', 'yearning', 'female', 'contact', 'rapport', 'connection', 'was', 'immediate', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'actions', 'were', 'control', 'was', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watched', 'movie', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'relationship', 'way', 'looked', 'end', 'when', 'said', ""'d"", 'go', 'Governor', 'protect', 'was', 'so', 'moving', 'sincere.Should', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'insecure', 'yearning', 'love', 'be', 'trusted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'leery', 'committed', 'murder', 'jealousy', 'Could', 'have', 'changed', '10', 'years', 'isolation', 'appeared', 'so', 'sweet', 'kind', 'empathetic', 'understanding', 'there', 'was', 'violent', 'side', 'felt', 'dreadfully', 'betrayed', 'violated', 'losing', 'trust', 'husband', 'Philip', 'was', 'there', 'attentive', 'witty', 'attractive', 'intelligent', 'doting', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'trust', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'error', 'might', 'be', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'was', 'mesmerized']",Captives VHS

Rachel (Ormond), the dentist and Philip  (Roth), the convict, is absolutely excellent, beautiful to watch and very  convincing. This movie projects such a good feeling in me - it's so tender  and sweet to see the beauty and depth of the love that Rachel and Philip  has for each other, and the extend they're willing to go just so the other  doesn't get hurt.I simply love this movie and highly recommend it. The  ending's a happy one - TRUE LOVE RULES!Oh, check out the beautiful  tattoos on Roth's arm and hand (they're REAL).",5,Highly Entertaining Romantic Thriller!,953856000,"03 24, 2000",2000,778,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'am', 'think', 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'Julia', 'Ormond', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'great', 'romantic', 'not', 'mention', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'then', 'must', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'chemistry', '2', 'leads', 'ie', 'Rachel', 'Ormond', 'dentist', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'convict', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'very', 'convincing', 'movie', 'projects', 'such', 'good', 'feeling', 'so', 'tender', 'sweet', 'see', 'beauty', 'depth', 'love', 'Rachel', 'Philip', 'other', 'extend', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'just', 'so', 'other', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt.I', 'simply', 'love', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ending', 'happy', 'one', 'TRUE', 'LOVE', 'RULES', 'Oh', 'check', 'out', 'beautiful', 'tattoos', 'Roth', 'arm', 'hand', ""'re"", 'REAL']",Captives VHS
409863,ARVIOWMXTTQ50,6304252137,Avocadess,"[6, 15]","I never saw Tim Roth come off so sexy as this -- just loved it (especially the parts nearer the beginning when he is first talking to her across the tables in prison visitors room and then in diners). J.O. is beautiful and captivating on her own --very believable and much too vulnerable. I'm amazed to read other reviews here that saw Roth's character as being so sincere and in love. I did not see him that way. I saw him as short of being truly in love with her -- that he cared for her, probably, but deeply in love? I never got that. He was all too willing to put her in too much danger for one thing. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion a man that really cares for a woman wants to protect her. If that component is missing, give him three bright red flags!It's a good watch though. I found it frightening to see how J.O.'s character kept falling for everything about him, hook line and sinker, ignoring *huge* red flags. Example: She told her best friend early in her romance with Roth's character that she didn't want to ask Roth what he was doing time for, feeling it was invasive. My gosh, whatever happened to the idea of expecting that a man should honor the need for a woman to feel *safe* with him? If he is worth his salt, he won't mind you checking him out and will be glad you did -- because, if he really cares about you, he is going to respect a woman's need to learn important things about him -- especially convicts and people met through personal ads. I mean really! When she finally breaks her resolve and looks it up, she learns he is in for murder -- of his wife.She is quick to notice that court documents say it was a crime of passion because his wife had been cheating on him. Oh good, she seems to think to herself, ""Jusitifiable homicide."" HELLO-OOO-OO? Is anybody out there? I don't care what his wife did, violence and murdering her was NOT okay, and NEVER the answer and does NOT make him out to be a ""deep, soulful, sensitive and passionate"" lover of most women's dreams. It makes him *dangerous*. I'm not saying he can't reform and I'm not saying she can't forgive that about him when he does, but this movie did not touch that. It was as if it was just like OKAY that he murdered his wife.  Pleeeeeez.Now, this does not make it a bad movie. In fact it makes it a very realistic movie, sadly, because a lot of us women keep falling for men who hurt us, and big-time. One shudders to think of how many women in America were beaten by their husbands or lovers this very hour today. To me this is not so much a movie about a tragic love affair as it is about some of the all-too-common vulnerabilities of a lot of women. Women with these vulnerabilities are women-at-risk.Roth was charismatic, sexy and captivating but I did not see him as a truly loving lover. I don't care how sensual and ""deep"" he is, when it's not true love it just ain't a love story. Too many things about the character he played showed that he did not (and was no doubt incapable of) truly loving her. It did not torment him what he was putting her through. I never saw him try to resist his desire for her so that she would not be put at risk. Simple caring was missing.Anyhow, I do think this movie is a fascinating character study -- both watching the film and reading the reviews of it.  I suggest getting ""True Romance"" with Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, who play it like genuine and romantic love in addition to this film so that you can watch a 5-star movie (""True Romance"") even while you are in the mood for this genre of film. And besides, TR is one of my favorite movies of all time and never got the marketing that would have clearly taken it to the top of the heap. It's star-studded with so many ""favorite"" scenes in it that I like to mention it whenever I can and it's on-topic. If you can only get one movie?
