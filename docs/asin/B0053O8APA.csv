1440560,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B0053O8APA,Alan Ramirez,"[20, 21]","I just still can't believe it was cancelled! The first and only season from TSC was amazing since the beginning until the end. Drama, relationships, scary moments and great actors. At the beginning of the show I was concerned because a lot of people thought they were trying to make it another ""Vampire Diaries"" show but with witches but that's not the truth. The Secret Circle shows darker situations and more realism when it comes to the plots. Every episode is enjoyable, the twists are refreshing and sometimes shocking and the performances are great.I just don't understand yet, why The CW keeps making new promising shows if they are going to cancel them anyway and keep the old ones, it happened before and I'm still angry with this decission. It was the third most-watched show from The CW and still got cancelled? I would love the show to be back in another network and I'm still hoping that it will.Or at least Warner Bros. Home Video, we want the DVD release of the complete series!

Smith.It is centered on young Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson) coming of age and her interaction mostly with gifted friends and families. The six main characters are followed as they must work together to uncover a secret or parish together. Trust and friendships are stretched and maybe broken.Each of the only 22 episodes starts with a new problem. We have a contagious underlying plot that gets more convoluted in each episode. Each episode wraps up the immediate problem but leaves a cliffhanger for the next. In the last episode we get a promise of more to come.You may not want to start this series of you are hoping for a wrap-up. Many have speculated on the nature of the series demise. Some suggested a re-write. Others want transferee to another network. The best suggestion is to do what they did with the series ""Firefly"" (2002-2003) and make a complete movie.I came to this series knowing of its demise but was still intrigued in each episode and now plan to read the book series.",5,"""Will the circle be unbroken"" - by Ada R.

They removed all the ""bullying"" which I kinda get why they would do that but if you think of the 80's and how up front movies were about that sort of thing, and now we just hide it all.

I thought that the season finale (AKA the series finale) was pretty good and set things up for the fall.  On May 11, 2012 it was announced that the CW cancelled the series despite it being the network's third highest performer and highest rated freshman series of the season.  Apparently, both production costs were too high and ratings tailed off in the 2nd half of the season.  ABC Family was a contender, though an already full slate and the same high production costs were a concern.Giving myself a little bit of rope.

It seems to center more around teenage idiocy - drinking, partying, sex, than the premise of the story.Cassy - the only character who is worth a s*** and who wants to explore and understand her powers. But every time she does something remotely interesting, her character is being dumbed down to stupid decision making and going back to mingling with the rest of the teeny boppers.Adam - useless, boring and full of himself with his never-ending sanctimonious tripe. On the bright side, he wears more mascara than all of the girls combined.Faye - a teen boper who cares more about alcohol and sex than anything else, and then keeps wondering why her powers are worthless.Diana - another teen boper who spends most of the series chasing after boys and being useless, but then whines about having no life as soon as she has to do anything remotely magical and help her circle which she started in the first place. Seriously?Jake - meh.Melissa - boring, whiny, and clingy.Soon after the show launches, the group of six breaks in half with Diana, Melissa, and Faye doing nothing but partying and drinking while Cassy, Adam and Jake run around saving the day. Nevertheless, Cassy seems to be doing all of the magic and decision making. What is the purpose of the rest of the group? If they barely use any of their powers, why does Cassy even need them? They barely do anything, their powers suck, Faye can't even take on Eva who has a fraction of her ""amazing"" powers. What the hell, writers?The romance part is just ridiculous. At the beginning, Adam seems to develop feelings for Cassy while dating Diana, but still declares his love for Diana after they break up, then 5 minutes later is totally in love with Cassy. Jake is also totally in love with Cassy, but does nothing to win her over, and instead has sexapades with Faye and suddenly develops feelings for her at the end.All of the adults are completely uninvolved in their kids lives and never question anything. All of the teens run around rampant doing whatever they want.NOTHING ever makes sense here.

I couldn't make out if he was evil or good from episode to next episode, and to me, that is a sign of an excellent actor. He blended well with the cast as if he were with them from the start.

These youthful characters [the next generation of witches] come together in alliance to deal with the inevitable challenges and adventures that come their way [witch hunters, demons, adulthood].  Their alliance feels very similar to the group that supported Buffy in last decades BTVSlayer series [friendship, drama, loyalty].Minimal spoiler alert here: Two of the young women [Cassie and Diane] turnout to be half sisters and have an element of ""dark magic"" within them [inherited from their Dad]. Diane is mature and careful, whereas Cassie puts herself out there and follows her instincts [sort of like a Marine - first to fight]. The problem is the more one uses dark magic, the more it changes you. This sister dynamic is fascinating.The CW taketh away: Unbelievably, this show is now on waivers, contingent on fan uproar or another network choosing to pickup. I cannot understand how a show like Vampire Diaries which seems to focus entirely on clothes and hair could survive- while a show with great plot potential is canceled.

1440583,A17G3OBAE4C3DK,B0053O8APA,"Vorris ""12 o'clock scholar""","[0, 1]","TSC made the mistake of another promising show a few years ago: Point Pleasant- very similar. That mistake is revealing too much too soon. Ppl wil accept occult rituals and magic as long as they like the ppl in the show and are interested in them. But here the magical plotlines were introduced even before we knew all the characters. Therefore those plotlines held no interest. The ppl have to be accepted before their magic can be accepted. It doesn't work in reverse. Magical rites have no interest unless they are already part of interesting characters.They got so far ahead of themselves that the show practically ended itself with the last Blackwood revelations. Adults will always be tough to integrate into teen drama- but TSC was way out. the Blackwood eps felt like they were closing an 8-yr run instead of the first season. It resolved every single tension except who Cassie winds up with. The cast members are so cute that they should have had some individual eps to themselves and branched off from the ""binding the circle"" theme.

1440585,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0053O8APA,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I'm a fan of supernatural-themed dramas and my curiosity was piqued when I read about this new show titled ""The Secret Circle"", which centers around a 16-year-old witch named Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson). At the beginning of episode one, viewers watch Cassie's mom get murdered, and this sets off a chain of events - Cassie moves in with her grandmother Jane (Ashley Crow) as her father too is long dead; the town Cassie moves to is New Salem, a tightly-knit community; and before long, Cassie finds out that she is descended from a long line of witches, not just practitioners of a craft, but people possessed of extraordinary powers.As the story moves along, Cassie discovers that her coming to New Salem might have been the work of an outside force but she does not really know why. She does find out that there are other teens in New Salem that are like her, descendants of witches, and who are eager to make her acquaintance and get her to join them as part of a coven, so that they can bind their circle of witches and fully come into their powers. The theory is that practicing in isolation renders them vulnerable to their enemies (later on in the story, viewers learn of the witch hunters, a group dedicated to killing witches), and that by binding themselves into a circle, they are able to protect themselves and also come into their powers.The various characters that make up this circle make it impossible for this group of young teen witches to function effectively - there's the uber-b**** Faye Chamberlain (Phoebe Tonkin) who thinks the world revolves around her; her best friend Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy) who appears like a lost soul for much of the season; serious and intense Adam Conant (Thomas Dekker) who has to take on a lot of responsibilities given that his father is an alcoholic; and Diana (Shelley Dennig) who is Adam's serious girlfriend. It is Diana (who is the nicest of the circle) who convinces Cassie to join the circle and bind their powers.Of course there are complications - Cassie and the others later learn that some of their parents died as a result of practicing witchcraft, and that they still face danger from their enemies. Not all of them possess a Book of Shadows, and only Diana and Cassie have found theirs. Later it becomes apparent that Cassie's Book of Shadows may hold much more powerful knowledge about the practice of witchcraft and that her bloodline may hold the source to some very potent, dark magic.Along the way, romantic complications inevitably ensue - Adam and Cassie are attracted to each other; Faye is jealous of Cassie's popularity and when Faye's old flame returns to New Salem and focuses on Cassie, sparks really fly. The episodes have enough suspense and character development in them to keep viewers engaged, especially for fans of witchcraft-themed stories. The actors were a bit stiff and awkward at the beginning and the adult actors are especially annoying (Natasha Henstridge as one of the wicked adult witches is not very credible) but as the series progressed, I think they have become more comfortable in their roles, and Britt Robertson as Cassie is especially good.As the season has progressed, there has been some interesting developments - Faye meets a voodoo practitioner who may want to use Faye for his own ends; Cassie discovers something that may make her even more of a magnet for witch hunters and darker creatures; there's a startling revelation about Cassie's bloodline; and, many others. The series appears to be growing from strength to strength with good writing, and great character development. Unfortunately, the latest news is that the show will not have a Season Two, due to low ratings.",4,Witches and witch hunters,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,3697,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'supernatural-themed', 'dramas', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued', 'when', 'read', 'new', 'show', 'titled', 'Secret', 'Circle', '16-year-old', 'witch', 'named', 'Cassie', 'Blake', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'beginning', 'episode', 'one', 'viewers', 'watch', 'Cassie', 'mom', 'get', 'murdered', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'Cassie', 'grandmother', 'Jane', 'Ashley', 'Crow', 'father', 'too', 'long', 'dead', 'town', 'Cassie', 'New', 'Salem', 'tightly-knit', 'community', 'long', 'Cassie', 'out', 'descended', 'long', 'line', 'witches', 'not', 'just', 'practitioners', 'craft', 'people', 'possessed', 'extraordinary', 'powers.As', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'Cassie', 'coming', 'New', 'Salem', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'work', 'outside', 'force', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'other', 'teens', 'New', 'Salem', 'are', 'descendants', 'witches', 'who', 'are', 'eager', 'make', 'acquaintance', 'get', 'join', 'part', 'coven', 'can', 'bind', 'circle', 'witches', 'fully', 'come', 'powers', 'theory', 'practicing', 'isolation', 'renders', 'vulnerable', 'enemies', 'later', 'story', 'viewers', 'learn', 'witch', 'hunters', 'group', 'dedicated', 'killing', 'witches', 'binding', 'circle', 'are', 'able', 'protect', 'also', 'come', 'powers.The', 'various', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'circle', 'make', 'impossible', 'group', 'young', 'teen', 'witches', 'function', 'effectively', 'uber-b****', 'Faye', 'Chamberlain', 'Phoebe', 'Tonkin', 'who', 'world', 'best', 'friend', 'Melissa', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'lost', 'soul', 'much', 'season', 'serious', 'intense', 'Adam', 'Conant', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'who', 'take', 'lot', 'responsibilities', 'given', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'Diana', 'Shelley', 'Dennig', 'who', 'Adam', 'serious', 'girlfriend', 'Diana', 'who', 'nicest', 'circle', 'who', 'Cassie', 'join', 'circle', 'bind', 'powers.Of', 'course', 'are', 'complications', 'Cassie', 'others', 'later', 'learn', 'parents', 'died', 'result', 'practicing', 'witchcraft', 'still', 'face', 'danger', 'enemies', 'Not', 'possess', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'only', 'Diana', 'Cassie', 'have', 'found', 'theirs', 'Later', 'apparent', 'Cassie', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'may', 'hold', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'knowledge', 'practice', 'witchcraft', 'bloodline', 'may', 'hold', 'source', 'very', 'potent', 'dark', 'way', 'romantic', 'complications', 'inevitably', 'ensue', 'Adam', 'Cassie', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'Faye', 'jealous', 'Cassie', 'popularity', 'when', 'Faye', 'old', 'flame', 'returns', 'New', 'Salem', 'focuses', 'Cassie', 'really', 'fly', 'episodes', 'have', 'enough', 'suspense', 'character', 'development', 'keep', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'especially', 'fans', 'witchcraft-themed', 'stories', 'actors', 'were', 'bit', 'stiff', 'awkward', 'beginning', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'especially', 'annoying', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'one', 'wicked', 'adult', 'witches', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'series', 'progressed', 'think', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'Cassie', 'especially', 'good.As', 'season', 'progressed', 'been', 'interesting', 'developments', 'Faye', 'voodoo', 'practitioner', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'use', 'Faye', 'own', 'ends', 'Cassie', 'something', 'may', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'magnet', 'witch', 'hunters', 'darker', 'creatures', 'startling', 'revelation', 'Cassie', 'bloodline', 'many', 'others', 'series', 'be', 'growing', 'strength', 'strength', 'good', 'writing', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'Unfortunately', 'latest', 'news', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'Season', 'Two', 'due', 'low', 'ratings']",N/A
