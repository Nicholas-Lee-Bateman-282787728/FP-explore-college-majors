This is another entry and it is a very good one but I can't say it knocks me out like so many of the UK series do. We first saw this setting in RUMPOLE, of the trying of cases by barristers and their all trying to advance themselves in the Inns of Court.  Becoming QC is paramount, called ""wearing silk"" and hence the title. That is exactly what two barristers are trying to do, get the silk being dangled in front of them.  So we watch them try cases while they go about this.  There is no humor, like there was in Rumpole though, which is a big loss.  Also, these cases are not riveting drama like THE ACCUSED, another UK law series which is absolutely fantastic.

1438404,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0053DA162,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Television has been populated by so many legal dramas through the years, it has become increasingly difficult to make the genre seem fresh and exciting. ""Silk"" is just the latest affair from the BBC. Premiering in 2011, the show is ramping up for the debut of its third season later this year in Britain after having its second season nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Program. Unlike comparable American programming, British television tends to be served up in much smaller doses. Therefore, Season One of ""Silk"" is defined by only six hour long episodes. The show is based around a group of ambitious barristers (led by Maxine Peake as Martha Costello) who all seek advancement within the legal field. The next step up the career ladder is to appointed to the Queen's Council (QC) and that honor is referred to as ""taking silk"" due to the gowns worn at that level. As this is a merit based appointment, it is imperative to be noticed as a winner. So ""Silk,"" while episodic in nature, has its protagonists looking toward the future with a particularly competitive edge.""Silk"" is certainly a well made courtroom drama with an appealing cast but, truth be told, I'm not sure it is quite as distinguished or unique as I would have liked. Peake is a solid lead, earnest and steadfast. As a defense barrister, she zealously pursues the truth. Of course, entrenched with strong convictions and the notion that everyone is innocent until proven otherwise, you can imagine that this can lead to certain disillusionment when faced with corrupt clients. Her primary foil is played by the reliable Rupert Penry-Jones as Clive Reader. Not quite as principled as Peake, his charm, pragmatism, and bravado have taken him far. As these two are both contending for the silk in very different ways, they tend to butt heads on occasion. The principles are also surrounded by support personnel including Martha's clerk (Neil Stuke), her ""baby barrister"" (Tom Hughes), and Penry-Jones' counterpart (Natalie Dormer). As only one pupil will be promoted to chambers, there is also a competition between Hughes and Dormer and this adds an element to the primary rivalry between Peake and Penry-Jones. In general, the cast is quite likable. I'd watch Penry-Jones in just about anything and it's interesting to see Dormer in something more contemporary than her memorable turns in ""The Tudors"" and ""Game of Thrones."" Sometimes, though, I wished the show would have devoted more time to developing these peripheral characters in more depth.While I liked the political machinations within the on-going story threads, ""Silk"" really boils down its cases. This is where the show feels a bit too familiar. Going through the courtroom motions, the cases themselves aren't particularly noteworthy, are solved too easily, or lean to being a bit far-fetched. Initially, none of Peake's clients are too disreputable so she always appears to be fighting on the side of right. As she cross examines witnesses, the show can be fun enough. But as is a weakness in shows of this type, Peake seems a little too adept at breaking witnesses down for startling courtroom confessions. Too many Perry Mason moments! While much of the show goes for grittiness, this recurrent plot device doesn't exactly scream realism. At times, therefore, the dialogue and interactions seem more theatrical than probably intended. In the end, I enjoyed ""Silk."" Is it the best legal drama on TV? Certainly not. But if you enjoy the genre, I wouldn't hesitate to give this a try either. If nothing else, Peake deserves a shout out for her work.

I watched it with no expectations and it grew on me.  The characters, though flawed, are endearing.  The series centers around Martha Costello (Maxine Peake) who is trying to get her silk and Q.C. (Queen's Counsel) status along with a colleague Clive (Rupert Penry-James) who hopes to achieve the same.  There's a bit of friendly rivalry there.Their law firm has a boat-load of cases to try and you follow Martha in the court room.  It's fun to note the difference between the British and American system - in one episode there's a jab at the American court protocol when the judge tells a young attorney to quit moving around so much, that it's not an American court of law.You note the wild wigs (and learn where the phrase ""big-wig"" comes from), the lawyers sit, the witnesses stand, and it seems the witnesses don't just answer the question, they are allowed to talk for a bit. And the same law firm can take the prosecution and defense roles with different attorneys.  Not sure they have public prosecutors.  It's fun to see the legal strategy at work.Found this a very delightful series, but I never over-dosed on legal dramas.  Legal dramas still seem fresh and intriguing to me and I liked the warmth of the characters in this series.  Although one recommendation for make-up, they need to tone down the red lipstick on Martha Costello a tad.

Yes, Silk is a ""legal drama,"" but somehow that category seems quite inadequate. Although the characters' ""home lives"" are implied they are virtually never dramatized.  On the other hand the rivalries and tensions of their work lives are vivid, believable and fascinating. And although the courtroom battles are perforce conducted verbally, each one turns out to reveal so much more about the various cases assigned to the barristers that it seems fair to call them both mysteries and thrillers. My husband and I watched these side by side, and at times we were convulsed with laughter, at times in tears, and most of the time we were simply riveted. In fact we found Silk too exciting to watch directly before bedtime. But do be very clear about this: these dramas are for the many reviewers here who hunger for highly intelligent television and bemoan the swift cancelation of excellent shows in favor of ""reality television"" (terrible misnomer) or soap opera schlock. While it is true that we will very soon re-watch both seasons, it is also true that we went back so often to re-watch and clarify or simply to savor scenes that we have very nearly watched it twice already. Excellence like this is the reason we bought an all-region DVD and buy nearly as much from Amazon UK as we do here.

Queen's Counsel wear distinctive full-bottomed wigs and silk gowns when they appear in Court. It is this gown which gives rise to the colloquial reference to Queen's Counsel as &#34;silks&#34; as well as to the phrase &#34;taking silk&#34; referring to their appointment.&#34; WikiSilk is a superb drama from BBC that follows a set of lawyers or barristers as known in the UK. Life for a barrister is a little different than layers in the US. The Chambers or barristers' chambers are the set of professional rooms used by a barrister or an association of barristers. There is a senior clerk who runs the chambers financially and All the legal work. He assigns all the cases that come to his chambers, and it is very competitive. Billy Lamb, played by Neil Stuke leads this chamber.Martha Costello, played by Maxine Peake, is one of the best and most intelligent of the barristers in this chamber. Her ambition, as it is all of the barrristers is to become Queen's Counsel. This chamber also has Clive Reader, played by Rupert Penry-Jones, who is one of the most ruthless and a womanizer of this group. They are both in the running for the Silk, which keeps this series Jumping. There are other barristers, one of whom is trying to get rid of Billy. The chambers also have two interns, very young lawyers, just out of college. One of whom steals his gown and wig which did not seem plausible.I liked this series, Martha Costello is superb as the best of the barristers, not content to let any other barrister do anything but their best. She has high expectations that she expects everyone should meet. Several unexpected complications develop that brings this particular chambers closer.

I will say that I agree with my fellow Top 100 reviewer, K Harris, that with so many similar courtroom dramas being produced by British (and Australian) television, some stand out above the rest. I'd put Silk - at least this first season (six hour-long episodes)  - in the category of ""the rest"". I was interesting to watch but the cases almost telegraphed their outcomes.Readers of the reviews should be aware that when this series was shown in the US, it was trimmed to 50 minutes to allow for ""funding announcements"" and previews of other shows. The DVD (there is, unfortunately, no Bluray release of the show) contains the original 59 minutes per episode BBC series (as des the Amazon streaming version, I am told).The DVD also contains the now -requisite ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette as a ""bonus"". This 13 -minute short consists of interviews with each of the main cast members about their character as well as the series producer and the writer, These comments are integrated with scenes from the show. It's unusual because, while you should probably watch this after you have seen the series (it's on Disc 2 of 2), the comments also explain how the British court system works, which can be helpful to know beforehand.So, in summary, I'm awarding this DVD four stars. Yes, I like it but, as I said, it is not the BBCs most engaging series, in my opinion.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Review of the DVD - The good news is that it's short series - there are better legal dramas though.,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1555,"['are', 'plenty', 'other', 'reviews', 'posted', 'already', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'lots', 'info', 'already', 'provided', 'will', 'say', 'agree', 'fellow', 'Top', '100', 'reviewer', 'K', 'Harris', 'so', 'many', 'similar', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'being', 'produced', 'British', 'Australian', 'television', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', ""'d"", 'put', 'Silk', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'six', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'category', 'rest', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'cases', 'almost', 'telegraphed', 'outcomes.Readers', 'reviews', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'shown', 'US', 'was', 'trimmed', '50', 'minutes', 'allow', 'funding', 'announcements', 'previews', 'other', 'shows', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'Bluray', 'release', 'show', 'original', '59', 'minutes', 'episode', 'BBC', 'series', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'version', 'am', 'told', '.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'now', '-requisite', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'bonus', '13', '-minute', 'short', 'interviews', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'producer', 'writer', 'comments', 'are', 'integrated', 'scenes', 'show', 'unusual', 'should', 'probably', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'Disc', '2', '2', 'comments', 'also', 'explain', 'how', 'British', 'court', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'helpful', 'know', 'beforehand.So', 'summary', ""'m"", 'awarding', 'DVD', 'four', 'stars', 'Yes', 'like', 'said', 'not', 'BBCs', 'most', 'engaging', 'series', 'opinion.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
