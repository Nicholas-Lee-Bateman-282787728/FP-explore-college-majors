By sneaking into the outside world, they eventually teach Rosetta how to live in the real world.This has the feel of an independent low budget film.

""you've got to be kidding me... cloned women who need to eat sperm to live.""  I figured this was a thinly veiled porno that had enough plot to make it to a rental shelf.  Boy was I wrong... so wrong.  It has a plot alright... a droll and ponderously slooooooow plot.  A scientist makes copies of herself, but removes their reproductive ability, which makes them dependent on protein from sperm.  (If you had visions of hot women givin' endless BJs to a horde of guys, look somewhere else) Long story short... the three ""clones"" and the scientist are all played by the same chick, who is not hot, does not get naked and poorly interacts with her other ""blue-screened"" selves.  If you are going to have a sexually based movie, (...) It may be ""low brow"" to say something like this, but the title is called ""TEKNOLUST"".  There was absolutely ZERO lust in this movie, as the clones equated sex with eating vitamins... and had no passion whatsoever when getting their ""protein"".  The clones were color-coded like power rangers which made this movie even more retarded.  I hate being duped by souped up dvd/vhs movie box cover art.

The plot is pretty dumb. The dialogue is way too over-the-top.  Watch, for example, the balcony scene when two of the characters try to explain that the reason no one is happy is because they don't get the chance to find their true ""essence.""  Whatever.  The writer obviously fell into that dangerous trap of thinking that every line has to be dazzlingly profound.  Sometimes simple, everyday dialogue can say as much as existential musings.  While the acting wasn't altogether bad, it did feel very uninspired.  All three of the clones and their creator were played the same way. I realize perhaps that's cause they're clones, but jeez, mix it up a little.  The only way to tell them apart is by physical appearance.  And I completely agree with the reviewer who didn't find Tilda attractive. Depending on which clone she played, she either looked freakish, disturbed, or even a little manly (Ruby looked more like a drag queen than a woman). Only the green clone looked halfway attractive, and I'm pretty sure that's because her hair covered most of her face. Speaking of color schemes, the imagery in this movie is too much Cat-in-the-Hat for my liking. All in all I could find little or no redeeming value in this movie. And I did watch it at 1 in the morning.

Dislikes include low-budget effects and cryptic finales, but maybe that's part of the charm of these movies.The good, of course, comes from Swinton. She plays a geek girl (Rosetta Stone), but plays the role with respect. She's shy, especially shy around men, and fiercely intelligent. Swinton also plays Stone's three clones: Ruby, Olive, and Marinne. It's a bit ham-handed, but the four roles are distinguished by very different wigs, and the clones by color coding: red, green, and ultramarine. Swinton's real achievement is in her physical presence[s] - the body language of each character is distinctly the character's own. Rosetta is especially good in her my-gawd-i'm-a-mother moments, painfully but realistically unsure, and over cautious as a result.The plot device is a bit odd: almost vampiric in an AIDS-era kind of way, but with a computer-y angle and a gentle resolution in the end. Rosetta and Ruby each find romantic resolutions of their own. Olive and Marinne seem to find each other - and something more. ""As easy as baking brownies."" The end is enigmatic, but good enough, and leaves a few questions open.It's a good indy movie.
