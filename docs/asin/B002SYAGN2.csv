1287500,A1X9RGY6D98LHO,B002SYAGN2,"adiadv ""adiadv""","[0, 0]","I read in a news link to some piece of tabloid trash that said Sandra Bullock received a Razzie for this film. I decided to watch it because she was quoted as saying what I considered to be a convincing defense for the film and her performance.A lot of people have been really hard on this movie, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's quirky, goofy and lighthearted, so if you watch it expecting a typical romantic comedy where ""boy meets girl and they fall head over heels in love against all odds"" or you are looking for some kind of life-changing message ... then I'm predicting that you'll be disappointed.All About Steve is a spoof with over the top characters who demonstrate particular personality traits to an extreme. Sandra Bullock was portrayed as a satirical version of a person with an IQ that's off the charts but appears to have very little common sense, can be annoying as hell because their brain is in overdrive most of the time, and they have no clue as to when they should simply keep their mouths shut. It's like their head is so full that they can hardly contain all of the information they have.Her character is so much like some of the total brainiacs I've known: a plethora of information (often seemingly useless until you need it), a tendency to talk incessantly, and they often don't pay much attention to what other people think of them. But those same people can are oftten very compassionate and don't intend to distance, offend or hurt others with their words or actions ... sometimes it seems like they can't help but say exactly what's on their mind regardless of the subject matter, circumstances or the company they're in.Without being too serious or losing the tongue-in-cheek aspect of the plot, the movie touches on the other side of that type of personality and the trouble those individuals might have relating to others - and vise versa. Maybe you need to have known a similar person to appreciate the humor in this movie ... or at the very least be in the mood to watch an off the wall comedy with an underlying theme that might subtly inspire you to at least consider people for who they really are or take a closer look before you casually write them off. It's a COMEDY! It's not intended to be a deep, philosophical drama.My review probably sounds defensive and overly serious for a movie that is intended to be funny and entertaining. Well, I certainly found it to be both. I can only imagine how much it sucks to have people annihilate you while you should be reveling in the victory of winning an Oscar. It just goes to show you that the price you pay for fame is living under a microscope 24/7.Give this movie a chance and hopefully you'll have a few laughs. If it's not your thing, don't write this movie off and make it sound like a failure on the part of those involved simply based on your personal taste in movies or what you typically expect from the actors that were involved.",3,"Be open minded and not too serious, it's a comedy!",1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,2933,"['read', 'news', 'link', 'piece', 'tabloid', 'trash', 'said', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'received', 'Razzie', 'film', 'decided', 'watch', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'convincing', 'defense', 'film', 'performance.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'hard', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'chance', 'quirky', 'goofy', 'lighthearted', 'so', 'watch', 'expecting', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'where', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'odds', 'are', 'looking', 'kind', 'life-changing', 'message', 'then', ""'m"", 'predicting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed.All', 'Steve', 'spoof', 'top', 'characters', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'particular', 'personality', 'traits', 'extreme', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'portrayed', 'satirical', 'version', 'person', 'IQ', 'charts', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'sense', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'hell', 'brain', 'overdrive', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'clue', 'when', 'should', 'simply', 'keep', 'mouths', 'shut', 'head', 'so', 'full', 'can', 'hardly', 'contain', 'information', 'have.Her', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'total', 'brainiacs', ""'ve"", 'known', 'plethora', 'information', 'often', 'seemingly', 'useless', 'need', 'tendency', 'talk', 'incessantly', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'same', 'people', 'can', 'are', 'oftten', 'very', 'compassionate', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'distance', 'offend', 'hurt', 'others', 'words', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'mind', 'regardless', 'subject', 'matter', 'circumstances', 'company', ""'re"", 'being', 'too', 'serious', 'losing', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'aspect', 'plot', 'movie', 'touches', 'other', 'side', 'type', 'personality', 'trouble', 'individuals', 'might', 'have', 'relating', 'others', 'vise', 'versa', 'Maybe', 'need', 'have', 'known', 'similar', 'person', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'mood', 'watch', 'wall', 'comedy', 'underlying', 'theme', 'might', 'subtly', 'inspire', 'least', 'consider', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'casually', 'write', 'off', 'COMEDY', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'drama.My', 'review', 'probably', 'defensive', 'overly', 'serious', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Well', 'certainly', 'found', 'be', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'people', 'annihilate', 'should', 'be', 'reveling', 'victory', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'just', 'show', 'price', 'pay', 'fame', 'living', 'microscope', '24/7.Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'have', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'movie', 'make', 'sound', 'failure', 'part', 'involved', 'simply', 'based', 'personal', 'taste', 'movies', 'what', 'typically', 'expect', 'actors', 'were', 'involved']",All About Steve

Qualls, Keith David, Howard Hesseman, Beth Grant, Katy Mixon and M.C. GaineyWRITTEN BY: Kim BarkerDIRECTED BY: Phil TraillRated: PG - 13Genre: ComedyRelease Date: 04 September 2009Other than the realization of my disappointment in the film, the first thing that came to mind after seeing All about Steve was; `Wow, that movie wasn't about Steve at all.' It could have easily been called `All about Mary', but I suppose that would be mistaken for a cheap knock-off of There's Something about Mary. So they went with just plain not-funny, instead.It's about a frigging psycho, by the name of Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock). Mary is a crossword creator and is temporarily living with her mom and dad while her apartment is being fumigated. While she's in her 40s and is still single, her parents decide to set Mary up with a blind-date. The poor unsuspecting sap is Steve (Bradley Cooper).Steve is a news station cameraman and has no idea what he's getting himself into. He's intrigued with the way Mary looks when he picks her up for their date and Mary is overly satisfied with Steve's appearance. So much in fact, that upon meeting him she runs back upstairs and changes her outfit for him.Mary jumps Steve in his van, while it's still parked outside her parent's house, prior to them going on the date. At first Steve goes with the idea with a smile on his face. But as Mary starts to babble-on like a sex-crazed lunatic, along with Steve, we learn that she may have a screw or two loose.In an attempt to let her down easy, he makes up an excuse of having to go, due to a media related emergency. He tells her he'll be on the road and mutters something about wishing she could come with him. Mary takes this to heart and decides to track him down.She repeatedly shows up at several different locations where breaking news is happening, to surprise Steve. Steve is more than surprised. Of course, Mary doesn't take the hint that Steve is not interested in her. Things get even worse for Steve, when his friend and co-worker Hartman Hughes (Thomas Haden Church), catches on to the fact that Mary is stalking him.Desperate for a good story, Hughes does everything he can do to convince Mary that Steve does want her around; he's just having trouble expressing his feelings for her. Being as gullible as a 5-year-old, Mary falls for this and sticks around to taunt Steve.Mary Horowitz will no doubt annoy many. I found her to be hilarious and adorable. Sandra Bullock is an amazing actress and doesn't play Mary over the top. Mary simply is over the top, and she's a blast because of it; so long as you're not Steve.What doesn't work in the film is everything that happens. There is no plot, no flow, and it tries way too hard to be funny. The people in it are funny, but the movie is not.For some reason the film is advertised as a romantic comedy, but trust me, it's not. Steve isn't even in the film for that long and as far as romance is concerned, the unsettling relationship between Kathy Bates and James Caan's characters in Misery, probably has more for you. And why do we take a complete turn for the worst in the third act, by having Mary spend the last third of the film stuck in a hole in the ground?

She also helped them to see how wrong it is to only look at the surface of a person, but by being herself.A few other reviewers said the jokes in this movie ""just weren't that funny.""  I'd have to disagree on the basis that while they are not over the top or outlandish jokes as in some movies, they were not supposed to be.  Mary was a not-so-social / not-so-normal personality, who really liked herself, but others just couldn't ""get.""  She wasn't trying to BE funny, she was trying to be the person everyone else wanted her to be...until she realized that there really were some people who understood how great she was.  If you're looking for an everyday-funny movie this is it, but if you're looking for outlandish-funny you should choose Ace Ventura.If you like Sandra Bullock, I would also recommend you google her acceptance speech at the Razzies for her performance in this movie...She's accepts it with great humor, while subtly pointing out some of the key elements of Mary's character!

1287519,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B002SYAGN2,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","...your acting wasn't the worst performance I've seen.  It was just underwhelming.Bullock plays the main lead Mary, a quirky trivial chatterbox who became obsessed with a news camera operator named Steve (Bradley Cooper) after a blind date, so she traveled across the nation to follow him.  I didn't find Bullock convincing as a quirky character. Oftentimes, she sounded bored whenever she talks like Daffy Duck.  I thought that such a chatty and extroverted character would be best suited for Kathy Griffin...but in hindsight, having Kathy Griffin playing this character would be an agonizing performance.  Maybe Bullock underplaying her role is actually a blessing.As for her stalkee, Steve, he's rather uninteresting.  He only had a couple of developements in the film: being scared and eventually accepting Mary's odd ways.  But there's nothing inbetween those developments that showed he's changed.  I couldn't find a loving chemistry between those two.  Matter of fact, I see Mary better off paired with Thomas Haden Church's character, an egotistic news reporter who tried to fend from his rivals.  He was enamored with himself at first and he did make things bad for Steve by telling Mary their next destination, but later he thought a little less about himself and he tried to do a brave thing to Mary later in the film, which Steve should've done himself if he cared.  He fleshed out more as a character, so I find him the better choice.Does ""All About Steve"" really deserve the critical lashing and razzie awards it has?""Transformers 2""certainly does, but I think the haters complained about this film for the wrong reasons.  Sure, the movie is very cynical and rather self-absored, and the stalker aspect of the story is a bit unflattering, but it's all deliberate; plus, they're treated rather wholesomely.  Mary is sorta charming as a character.  Sure, she talks way too much, but other people in the film acknowledge her annoying trait so that's the joke; she also had an ugly wig (but then again, so has Bullock's character in ""The Blind Side"").  Otherwise, her bubbly, obsessive eccentricity made her a cross betweenPuccaandMegumi Noda(pardon the anime nerd speak), so that's why I find her amusing.The jokes revolve around her chatty attitude, which got old very fast, but the movie does have moments that made me giggle, like Ken Jeong talking smack on Steve and the news reporter, the part where Steve thought Mary's carrying a machete (his reaction and timing was good), and the part where the deaf kids just felt in a collapsed hole from out of nowhere.  The story got weak later on when people suddenly find Mary to be an inspiration, which lead to a cheesy misplaced conclusion.  But on the whole, ""All About Steve"" is an odd film, but certainly an appealing film.

It's about this nerdy woman falling for this news camera man who could careless about her. She follows him all over the country trying to prove her love when clearly he does not want to be with her. This could have been very funny but most of the jokes fall flat.  With the exception of the always humourous performance of Thomas Hadden Church, nothing in this movie is really funny. Sandra Bullock is a great actress but her character is extremely annoying in this film. You are supposed to feel sorry for her but it's impossible. She is a walking contradiction, If she's suppose to be so intelligent how is that she can't see this guy does not want her. Was she blinded by love? No, because at the end she comes to her senses and walks away from him like he's a complete nobody. I don't think this one is even worth renting.

1287524,A34H90POFYRHGT,B002SYAGN2,dSavannah George-Jones,"[4, 4]","... I'm clearly in the minority, but I adored this story of Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock), a very (freakishly) smart, very socially awkward crossword puzzle constructor, who lives with her parents and has a pet gerbil (I think that's what it was). She's also incredibly happy in general - just a bright-eyed, trusting soul, in love with words and the world around her. (I'm not bright-eyed or all that trusting, but I've been called ""weird"" a time or two in my life, so I can relate.)Her attempt to ""be normal"" involves being set up on a blind date with Steve, a cameraman for a national TV news organization. She literally attacks him in his truck before they even leave the driveway. He of course, thinks ""oh, she's cuckoo"", then makes an excuse and a what he means to be a polite brush-off, but that she takes as an actual invitation.So, when her next crossword puzzle is literally ALL ABOUT STEVE, and she gets fired, she takes his off-hand remark as an invitation and follows him around the country.There are some truly amusing moments in this movie - she gets tricked into getting off a bus, which pulls away, because she talks too much; she then takes a ride with a trucker, and writes his driver's license # on her arm, so he can't murder her and get away with it, and then reads the truck manual; she asks a deaf girl what kind of deafness she has, etc. etc.Her smartness, and curiosity, is refreshing. And the ending is sweet.The only thing I didn't like was Sandy's haircut & color: this character would not have highlighted, fixed hair. She just wouldn't care.However, it's a sweet story about learning to be true to yourself.

1287525,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002SYAGN2,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","The obvious statement to make about this misbegotten 2009 comedy is that the film's star and producer Sandra Bullock completely misjudged the material (written in a slipshod, strangely alienating fashion by Kim Barker) and then added insult to injury by letting first-time director Phil Traill take the helm without much supervision. The result is pretty heinous albeit a minor blip in Bullock's banner year as a box-office draw and respectable actress betweenThe Proposaland The Blind Side. Nonetheless, you can tell there is something more audacious and even humanistic underneath the laborious hi-jinks that Bullock must have seen in the concept, but the execution is so bungled that you really can't tell whether she wanted to make a Monty Python-style absurdist farce or rather a subversive anti-romantic comedy.Bullock plays Mary Magdalene Horowitz, a compulsive crossword puzzle creator for a Sacramento newspaper. Living with her parents, Mary is an encyclopedic chatterbox in red-leather go-go boots. Granted she's pretty (since Bullock is playing her), but she is also interminably annoying and sadly leads a spinster's lonely existence in her circa-1971-decorated bedroom. Mary's concerned parents set her up on a blind date with the titular Steve, a good-looking cable news cameraman whose devilish smile sets her hormones racing. After an aggressive physical romp in his SUV immediately after they meet, he flees the scene with an empty promise of wishing she could come with him. That's enough for Mary to follow Steve to his home base in Tuscon and then to Oklahoma where a story unfolds over a little girl born with a third leg. There she meets a couple of kindred spirits who are ""pro-leg"" and tag along on her pursuit. They pursue Steve to Galveston, Texas, where they get caught in the eye of a tornado.Things come to a head when a group of deaf children fall into a mine shaft in Colorado, and Mary inadvertently becomes the center of the news story. The movie gets a little more serious toward the end as it deals with worthwhile topics like self-acceptance and diversity, but it's just too little, too late. To her credit, Bullock at least appears engaged and unapologetic in presenting a disturbed character that is a challenge to the viewer's sensibilities, but she is left abandoned by the filmmakers in making Mary work as a sympathetic protagonist. Perhaps because he has played too many morally compromised characters in films, Bradley Cooper (The Hangover) cannot seem to offset Bullock's eccentricities with any real conviction and fades noticeably from the central conflict. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) is on familiar ground as pompous, fame-mongering reporter Hartman Hughes, who manipulates Mary's obsession with Steve into his own media circus.In a normal role for a change, Ken Jeong (Knocked Up) is actually subdued as Angus, the third member of the news crew. DJ Qualls (Hustle & Flow) and Katy Mixon do what they can around Bullock as Mary's fellow outcasts. The 2009 DVD offers more extras than the film frankly deserves with Bullock, Cooper, Church, Jeong, Traill, and Barker contributing to an entertaining commentary track that makes me think they made a different movie entirely. Nine deleted scenes and a standard making-of featurette are also included, and so are a montage clip accompanied by Cooper and Jeong singing a strangely unfunny song, and a boring slide show of the film crew with Bullock performing her own rap to it. None of these features make the film any better than it is, but at least Bullock can look back at 2009 as the year she proved that two out of three ain't bad.",2,Bullock Misfires on Almost All Cylinders as an Obsessive Romantic in a Strangely Bungled Farce,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,3635,"['obvious', 'statement', 'make', 'misbegotten', '2009', 'comedy', 'film', 'star', 'producer', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'completely', 'misjudged', 'material', 'written', 'slipshod', 'strangely', 'alienating', 'fashion', 'Kim', 'Barker', 'then', 'added', 'insult', 'injury', 'letting', 'first-time', 'director', 'Phil', 'Traill', 'take', 'helm', 'much', 'supervision', 'result', 'pretty', 'heinous', 'minor', 'blip', 'Bullock', 'banner', 'year', 'box-office', 'draw', 'respectable', 'actress', 'betweenThe', 'Proposaland', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Nonetheless', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'more', 'audacious', 'even', 'humanistic', 'laborious', 'hi-jinks', 'Bullock', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'concept', 'execution', 'so', 'bungled', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'wanted', 'make', 'Monty', 'Python-style', 'absurdist', 'farce', 'rather', 'subversive', 'anti-romantic', 'comedy.Bullock', 'plays', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Horowitz', 'compulsive', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'creator', 'Sacramento', 'newspaper', 'Living', 'parents', 'Mary', 'encyclopedic', 'chatterbox', 'red-leather', 'go-go', 'boots', 'Granted', 'pretty', 'Bullock', 'playing', 'also', 'interminably', 'annoying', 'sadly', 'spinster', 'lonely', 'existence', 'circa-1971-decorated', 'bedroom', 'Mary', 'concerned', 'parents', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'titular', 'Steve', 'good-looking', 'cable', 'news', 'cameraman', 'devilish', 'smile', 'hormones', 'racing', 'aggressive', 'physical', 'romp', 'SUV', 'immediately', 'meet', 'scene', 'empty', 'promise', 'wishing', 'could', 'come', 'enough', 'Mary', 'follow', 'Steve', 'home', 'base', 'Tuscon', 'then', 'Oklahoma', 'where', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'born', 'third', 'leg', 'couple', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'who', 'are', 'pro-leg', 'tag', 'along', 'pursuit', 'pursue', 'Steve', 'Galveston', 'Texas', 'where', 'get', 'caught', 'eye', 'tornado.Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'group', 'deaf', 'children', 'fall', 'mine', 'shaft', 'Colorado', 'Mary', 'inadvertently', 'center', 'news', 'story', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'end', 'worthwhile', 'topics', 'self-acceptance', 'diversity', 'just', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'credit', 'Bullock', 'least', 'engaged', 'unapologetic', 'presenting', 'disturbed', 'character', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'sensibilities', 'left', 'abandoned', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'Mary', 'work', 'sympathetic', 'protagonist', 'Perhaps', 'played', 'too', 'many', 'morally', 'compromised', 'characters', 'films', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Hangover', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'offset', 'Bullock', 'eccentricities', 'real', 'conviction', 'fades', 'noticeably', 'central', 'conflict', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Sideways', 'familiar', 'ground', 'pompous', 'fame-mongering', 'reporter', 'Hartman', 'Hughes', 'who', 'Mary', 'obsession', 'Steve', 'own', 'media', 'circus.In', 'normal', 'role', 'change', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'actually', 'subdued', 'Angus', 'third', 'member', 'news', 'crew', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Katy', 'Mixon', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'around', 'Bullock', 'Mary', 'fellow', 'outcasts', '2009', 'DVD', 'more', 'extras', 'film', 'frankly', 'Bullock', 'Cooper', 'Church', 'Jeong', 'Traill', 'Barker', 'contributing', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'think', 'made', 'different', 'movie', 'entirely', 'Nine', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'standard', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'so', 'are', 'montage', 'clip', 'accompanied', 'Cooper', 'Jeong', 'singing', 'strangely', 'unfunny', 'song', 'boring', 'slide', 'show', 'film', 'crew', 'Bullock', 'performing', 'own', 'rap', 'None', 'features', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'least', 'Bullock', 'can', 'look', 'back', '2009', 'year', 'proved', 'two', 'three', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad']",All About Steve

If I had that tidbit of information, I'm sure I would have steered clear. This movie reeks of inexperience despite a normally charming and charismatic leading lady.The story follows Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock), a crossword puzzle constructor who is a little too smart and talks a bit too much for her own good. She goes on a blind date with Steve (Bradley Cooper) and is so drawn to his good looks and smell that she immediately jumps him in his vehicle like an Axe body spray commercial. At first aroused, Steve quickly becomes disturbed by Mary's enthusiasm and running mouth and invents an excuse to get away from her hoping to never see her again. Mary's infatuation interferes with her work and once jobless, she decides to take a risk and follow Steve on the road. It would be logical after multiple rejections for her to get the idea and go home, but she is prodded onward by Thomas Haden Church's news corespondent who apparently just has a sick sense of humor and likes using her words to sound smarter in his broadcast. All of this should be enough to let you know the story is painful.Sandra Bullock is usually so cute and her snorting laugh so charming. Here, no matter what she does she has so much annoying dialogue that the only endearing quality she retains are those red boots. Bradley Cooper is a very hot guy, but comes off as an absolute moron. For example he attempt to don a disguise while forgetting he is still with the other two very recognizable people he works with in their obvious news van. Ken Jeong completes the news team threesome and never really has any material to be funny with.When I saw Mary fall into the hole in the trailer, I cracked up hysterically. I thought that could be just one of many funny moments in the movie, but no, that is THE main funny moment in the movie that doesn't occur till near the last act and becomes such a desperate rescue mission that it doesn't make it as fun to laugh at anymore. All the jokes in this movie just aren't THAT funny unfortunately and I wanted to like this movie.The saddest part of the movie is where Steve almost rewards Mary's stalker behavior by telling her never to change.

A virtual paragon of knowledge, Mary lives for nothing more than work and her bits of useless trivia, unloading her knowledge to all who will listen. Steve (Bradley Cooper) is a camera man working with television reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Hayden Church) for the local CCN news channel. When Mary's parents and Steve's parents set them up on a blind date, Steve doesn't have a great time and ends the date early while Mary sees him as the one and pursues him across the country.In 2009, Sandra Bullock had a red letter year at the movies. She started off the year with the romantic comedy The Proposal which became the highest grossing movie of her career. Later in the year she starred in The Blind Side which not only passed the $200 million to topple The Proposal as Bullock's highest grossing movie, but also proved that she truly had star power as her name was the sole star name on the marquee and has given the starlet Oscar buzz almost guaranteeing an Oscar nomination for Best Actress which would also be a career first. Bradley Cooper also had a great year that saw him starring in The Hangover which became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time, and getting cast in an upcoming A Team remake. With both stars having career years at the movies, you'd think this pairing would make for thrilling cinema.Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you that you'd be wrong. While I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics would tell you (showing up on many critic's worst of the year lists), I have to admit that the movie is not good. The characters in the movie find themselves in positions that are too absurd as the screenplay takes them to places that just don't really seem to fit. Also, the characters are not well written, being either cardboard cutouts of real people, or being too quirky for their own good. Sandra Bullock comes off the worst. While her acting is not bad, the character is too hapless, too unconvincing with too many quirks that leave you wondering how this woman survived this long in the modern world. The movie also tries to hard to make a statement about following the ""right road,"" being true to yourself, while also being a satire of sensationalist news coverage. The result is a climax that doesn't feel true to the tone of the rest of the movie while also being so sweet and sentimental that you'll find yourself in a diabetic coma by the movie's end.If there is a good point to this movie it's the news crew sent out by CCN to report on occurrences where no one else is available comprised of Steve, Hartman Hughes, and Angus (Ken Jeong). If they would have been played by any other actors they wouldn't have been so fun to watch, but their comedic timing is such that even at their most unlikable they still come across as fun to watch and make you feel that the movie should have revolved around them. They're playful jokey banter with each other, and hapless pranks that essentially drive the plot of the movie accentuates the type of the bromance love that we've been seeing in movies lately. While not the best written material, the actors play it well, and for that I have to give them props.On a certain level I can slightly recommend this movie, but on another level I cannot. It can be fun at times, and at other times it can be beyond ridiculous. If you're looking for a chuckle here or there and mindless entertainment you can probably get over my issues with the film (although Mary might still grate on your nerves a bit), but if you want more than I suggest you look for it elsewhere.2/5",2,All About Steve,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,3643,"['Mary', 'Horowitz', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'constructor', 'local', 'newspaper', 'virtual', 'paragon', 'knowledge', 'Mary', 'nothing', 'more', 'work', 'bits', 'useless', 'trivia', 'unloading', 'knowledge', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'Steve', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'camera', 'man', 'working', 'television', 'reporter', 'Hartman', 'Hughes', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'local', 'CCN', 'news', 'channel', 'When', 'Mary', 'parents', 'Steve', 'parents', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'Steve', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'time', 'date', 'early', 'Mary', 'one', 'country.In', '2009', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'had', 'red', 'letter', 'year', 'movies', 'started', 'off', 'year', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Proposal', 'became', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', 'career', 'Later', 'year', 'starred', 'Blind', 'Side', 'not', 'only', 'passed', '200', 'million', 'topple', 'Proposal', 'Bullock', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', 'also', 'proved', 'truly', 'had', 'star', 'power', 'name', 'was', 'sole', 'star', 'name', 'marquee', 'given', 'starlet', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'almost', 'guaranteeing', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'career', 'first', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'year', 'saw', 'starring', 'Hangover', 'became', 'highest', 'grossing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'time', 'getting', 'cast', 'upcoming', 'A', 'Team', 'remake', 'stars', 'having', 'career', 'years', 'movies', ""'d"", 'think', 'pairing', 'would', 'make', 'thrilling', 'cinema.Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'would', 'tell', 'showing', 'up', 'many', 'critic', 'worst', 'year', 'lists', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'characters', 'movie', 'find', 'positions', 'are', 'too', 'absurd', 'screenplay', 'places', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'fit', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'being', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'real', 'people', 'being', 'too', 'quirky', 'own', 'good', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'worst', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'character', 'too', 'hapless', 'too', 'unconvincing', 'too', 'many', 'quirks', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'woman', 'survived', 'long', 'modern', 'world', 'movie', 'also', 'hard', 'make', 'statement', 'following', 'right', 'road', 'being', 'true', 'also', 'being', 'satire', 'sensationalist', 'news', 'coverage', 'result', 'climax', ""n't"", 'feel', 'true', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'also', 'being', 'so', 'sweet', 'sentimental', ""'ll"", 'find', 'diabetic', 'coma', 'movie', 'end.If', 'good', 'point', 'movie', 'news', 'crew', 'sent', 'out', 'CCN', 'report', 'occurrences', 'where', 'one', 'else', 'available', 'comprised', 'Steve', 'Hartman', 'Hughes', 'Angus', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'other', 'actors', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'comedic', 'timing', 'such', 'even', 'most', 'unlikable', 'still', 'come', 'fun', 'watch', 'make', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'revolved', ""'re"", 'playful', 'jokey', 'banter', 'other', 'hapless', 'pranks', 'essentially', 'drive', 'plot', 'movie', 'type', 'bromance', 'love', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'movies', 'lately', 'not', 'best', 'written', 'material', 'actors', 'play', 'well', 'have', 'give', 'props.On', 'certain', 'level', 'can', 'slightly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'level', 'can', 'not', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'times', 'other', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'looking', 'chuckle', 'here', 'there', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'can', 'probably', 'get', 'issues', 'film', 'Mary', 'might', 'still', 'grate', 'nerves', 'bit', 'want', 'more', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere.2/5']",All About Steve

1287544,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B002SYAGN2,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[5, 5]","I continue to look back at the reviews from some of the main critics on this movie, to make sure I viewed the same film.  The film was just trashed by most people and I admittedly only saw it because it was on my cable premium channel for free.  I figured I had some time to kill; the girlfriend always likes Sandra Bullock movies, so why not give it a shot.  I still had my scotch in hand if things got too bad.  Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the film quite a bit.  I am still unsure what all of the fuss was about.Sandra Bullock holds down a job as a cross word puzzle constructor.  I will say the movie does not paint this occupation in a good light.  Are all the people who hold down this job really that quirky?  She is an extremely intelligent person, and we could call her unique as well.  Damn, if I am straight with you, she reminded me of a couple creepy girls from college.  One girl actually tracked me down at my house after one date.  I still don't know how she found out where I lived.Sandra lives at home with her parents and she talks a lot.  I mean she talks all of the time.  I live in a house with my girlfriend and three daughters and all of them combined do not talk that much.  Well, maybe all of the combined.  Despite all of Sandra's social issues, she has a good heart, but just hasn't found the right guy yet.  Her mother sets her up on a blind date, with Bradley Cooper of all people and she likes him so much she tries to do him in the back of his SUV, right outside of her parent's house.  The sentimental occasion gets broken up by his job calling, but he inadvertently suggests he might enjoy seeing her on the road at his next assignment.  He is the cameraman for a news team.Crazy Sandra takes this to heart and starts stalking, I mean following him like a groupie.  At one point he really starts freaking out about the whole thing.  I loved Thomas Haden Church's character and how he encouraged her to keep up her unnatural pursuits.  Church was absolutely hilarious, even if he played his typical dry sense of humor character he has honed to a science.  As with all good romantic comedies, we find out Sandra might be crazy, but she is a truly good person, and her endearing qualities win over the crowd, if not the boy of her dreams.I should make a note here.  It is getting extremely hard to watch a movie with Bradley Cooper in my house.  If I have to hear how hot he is from my girlfriend one more time. I might jump out of our first floor window.  Hey, I might find it annoying, but I don't want to hurt myself over it.  The girlfriend's friend was over a few nights ago, and we had her watch ""The Hangover"".  She had not seen it.  OMG, it was nonstop drooling over the guy.  Anyway, back to our main story.I enjoyed the movie.  It wasn't a stellar theatrical production, but it holds its own and you have several laughs in the process as well.  I still have no idea what movie some of the major critics were watching.  But from my humble perspective, you could do far worse than sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn watching Sandra Bullock drive Bradley Cooper absolutely bonkers with her hilariously funny, if not sometimes crazy, antics.

1287548,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B002SYAGN2,Kelly Klepfer,"[54, 57]","People Magazine gave this a 1/2 star out of 5. It truly wasn't that bad.Here are my thoughts.Sandra Bullock's character is awkward and that is an understatement. This still-at-home-with-mom-and-dad crossword-puzzle-creator is an unique blend of Cliff Clavin (Cheers) Napoleon Dynamite and Pippi Longstocking. I struggled with whether to like Mary and cheer her on or to just be annoyed and laugh at her when she fell into the big hole. I ended up doing both.Basic plot: Mary, due to outside pressures, thinks she needs to take her one last shot of normalcy by embracing (understatement) a blind date. When he comes to pick her up and turns out to be ""hot"" she does this creepy silent stare thing and runs back upstairs to put some sexy on. A truly awkward scene follows when she jumps Steve (Bradley Cooper), not after an okay date but before they even pull away from her folks' house. At first Steve is dazzled by the skin and enthusiasm but then he begins to think she might be crazy so he invents an excuse...a phone call sending him away. While he's attempting to get her out of the van before she truly goes crazy he mentions wishing she could go with him. More circumstances make that a possibility. Some may call it stalking, Mary calls it many, many other things in long paragraphs and polysyllabic words.Mary is not just a person who talks all the time -- she's a walking encyclopedia of random facts -- and she ends up alienating loads of people on her quest to find Steve. Then she becomes a hero, accidentally, of course. Thomas Haden Church plays the annoying, selfish anchorman wanna-be and he eggs Mary on. Though I wasn't sure what his motivation was exactly his encouragement got Mary to relentlessly pursue Steve. Most of the characters are oddly eccentric, almost cartoonish, from Mary's parents to Haden Church's nemesis. It was almost as if the movie was an attempt to tell a quirky feel good story blended with a parody. It's one of the stranger films I've seen.Content warnings. The groping scene in the beginning 20 minutes of so of the movie goes on too long and it should be screened before child/young teen viewing. That probably won't be an issue though since most children will likely get bored. Several sexual references are scattered throughout the film. One news story that Steve chases down involves a fight over amputating a baby girl's third leg and there are a few obvious body part innuendo/references. Some language. Some skin, mostly cleavage.There are several amusing one-liners and descriptives and a  pretty sweet tornado besides some great physical comedy and pratfalls. A few scenes are laugh-out-loud funny.

When we entered the theater, we were puzzled since we were the only ones there, and when the lights went down we each took a different row just like you might on an unexpectedly empty plane during a night flight.  The movie began with just the two of us, and we weren't even bored yet, when the film ground to a halt, literally.  The screen went dark, the lights went up in the house, and an official of the movie chain approached us in our rows.  Apologetically he said that the showing had been cancelled due to poor attendance and that we would be getting our money back.""When's the next showing?"" asked my wife.""There won't be any more,"" he said apologetically.""But it just opened on Friday.""  (This was Sunday afternoon.)""We won't be showing it again,"" said the manager.  ""Starting at 7:00 p/m we're bringing back Star Trek.""""We saw that,"" we objected.  But as it turned out we saw it a second time, and it was fine.  We saw a lot of things in the movie we'd missed first time around.  Nevertheless we were wondering whatever happened to Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock) after she schlepped to Oklahoma to follow the CCN team covering the little girl with three legs.

Sandra Bullock plays a person with an intellectual IQ at one end of the scale and a social IQ at the other end.

Her shallowness (and concomitant lack of character) makes the whole film ring so false that at the end of the movie one cannot even decipher what the meaning of the film was. Was it that being different is OK? If that is the case, then the film was a horrible failure. Or perhaps it was supposed to be that one should follow one's heart and dreams. Well now, that wouldn't be a bad message if the dream was based upon something *real* rather than the product of some delusion or if the goal was something noble and meaningful.

All About Steve is that film.The film tries to find its footing in the overacting antics of one Mary Horowitz, a walking encyclopedia of knowledge of disrelated facts that goes on and on and on gabbering incessantly without a clue as to how she's affecting others.  Have you seen such people?But the movie does more than show us an eccentricity.  It's a reflective parody on several levels: See how people treat others who are not ""normal.""  It's not ""normal"" to live with your parents at 40, not to have a lover, to take your minor job as a crossword puzzlemaker seriously.  And to chase after a guy you just met in your quest to have a ""normal"" relationship.And Mary meets people who are crazier than she is!  She says, ""How do you do"" to one guy at a rally protesting a baby getting its third leg amputated (long story) and he says, ""I don't know what you mean.""Pretty convoluted story.  Some laugh out moments.  The media/TV news parodies are especially insightful.  The anchors basically making up news as they go along, ""I don't want to speculate but..."" and then do so.  Announcers and cameramen bouncing off each other, driving vans, constantly on the lookout for news.  Predatory.  And a bit scarily close to the truth!All About Steve is really about Mary.  It's a film that is a comedy of sorts, a few insightful moments but not much else.  If anything, in desparate need of a scriptwriter or editor!There was one cute quote, though:  ""If you love a man let him go.  If you have to stalk him, you didn't love him in the first place!""

Was it stupid and outrageous at times? Sure it was! But so was how to lose a guy in ten days, or any of the miss congeniality movies, or wedding singer, or all of those. This is the same thing. So if you liked those I think you'll enjoy this. If anything Thomas Hayden church is hilarious in this! It was as if the part was written specifically with him in mind. So I honestly don't know why people seem to have such a problem with it. I thought it was entertaining. On that note, I streamed it to my Sony TV and it only hesitated once briefly somewhere about half way through, and then it was fine after that. Also, in the very beginning the voices were slightly off with the picture, so I just hit stop and start again and it was fine after that. Couple of quirks but hey could you ever have imagined you could stream an entire movie over the internet? Absolutely amazing and totally convenient. I'd do it all the time if most weren't $3.99...grumble grumble... :)",3,It's what you'd expect,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1140,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'expecting', 'exactly', 'other', 'Sandra', 'bullock', 'movies', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'drew', 'Barrymore', 'kind', 'romantic', 'silly', 'comedies', 'Was', 'stupid', 'outrageous', 'times', 'Sure', 'was', 'so', 'was', 'how', 'lose', 'guy', 'ten', 'days', 'miss', 'congeniality', 'movies', 'wedding', 'singer', 'same', 'thing', 'So', 'liked', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'anything', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'church', 'hilarious', 'was', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'mind', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'note', 'streamed', 'Sony', 'TV', 'only', 'hesitated', 'once', 'briefly', 'somewhere', 'half', 'way', 'then', 'was', 'fine', 'Also', 'very', 'beginning', 'voices', 'were', 'slightly', 'picture', 'just', 'hit', 'stop', 'start', 'again', 'was', 'fine', 'Couple', 'quirks', 'hey', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'could', 'stream', 'entire', 'movie', 'internet', 'Absolutely', 'amazing', 'totally', 'convenient', ""'d"", 'do', 'all', 'time', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", '3.99', 'grumble', 'grumble']",All About Steve
1287591,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002SYAGN2,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","Some may think this is a sweet romantic comedy with difference; others would think this is a miscalculated farce or a screwball comedy gone wrong. Whatever it is, ""All About Steve"" is in a nutshell about Sandra Bullock's love-struck heroine going, ""I love him"" (repeat three times) and ""where he goes I'll follow"" (three times again). Sandra Bullock`s over-the-top comic performance, which brought her a Razzie award for the ""worst actress,"" has given another meaning to the lyrics of ""I Will Follow You,"" a good oldie song by Little Peggy March. I didn't know this famous pop song was about stalking.Sandra Bullock plays a forty-something crossword puzzle constructor Mary Horowitz, who meets a TV cameraman Steve (Bradley Cooper) on a blind date set up by her parents. Within ten minutes of meeting Steve, Mary believes he is her true love and attempts to make love with him in a car. After making an ""inspired"" crossword puzzle no one can solve, she travels around the country to follow Steve, who goes on the road following a story with a reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Haden Church) and Angus (Ken Jeong).""All About Steve,"" presumably a pun on ""All About Eve,"" is a typical example of a messy filmmaking that would make you think, ""What are they thinking?"" We simply don't know what the film is all about. The story is weak. Jokes are not very funny. Its satire doesn't bite. Characters are quirky, maybe a bit too quirky. Sandra Bullock's character, always wearing red knee-high boots, appears as a charming eccentric, and soon gets downright irritating with her endless chattering. Maybe not as irritating as Roberto Benigni in his ""Pinocchio,"" I admit, but still very close.Perhaps the biggest problem about ""All About Steve"" is the heroine herself. For a comedy of this kind to succeed, the central character(s) need to be more likable. They can be eccentric as much as they like, but they have to be someone you want to spend some time with, and Mary is not among them. After all, we need someone to laugh with, not at, but despite its sweet and neat conclusion, it seems the film is tempting us to do the latter.",2,Ocassionally Funny (But Not in the Way Filmmakers Must Have Intended),1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2124,"['may', 'think', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'difference', 'others', 'would', 'think', 'miscalculated', 'farce', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Whatever', 'Steve', 'nutshell', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'love-struck', 'heroine', 'going', 'love', 'repeat', 'three', 'times', 'where', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'three', 'times', 'again', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 's', 'over-the-top', 'comic', 'performance', 'brought', 'Razzie', 'award', 'worst', 'actress', 'given', 'meaning', 'lyrics', 'Will', 'Follow', 'good', 'oldie', 'song', 'Little', 'Peggy', 'March', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'famous', 'pop', 'song', 'was', 'stalking.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'forty-something', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'constructor', 'Mary', 'Horowitz', 'who', 'TV', 'cameraman', 'Steve', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'blind', 'date', 'set', 'up', 'parents', 'Within', 'ten', 'minutes', 'meeting', 'Steve', 'Mary', 'true', 'love', 'attempts', 'make', 'love', 'car', 'making', 'inspired', 'crossword', 'one', 'can', 'solve', 'country', 'follow', 'Steve', 'who', 'road', 'following', 'story', 'reporter', 'Hartman', 'Hughes', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Angus', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'Steve', 'presumably', 'pun', 'Eve', 'typical', 'example', 'messy', 'filmmaking', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'What', 'are', 'thinking', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'story', 'weak', 'Jokes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'satire', ""n't"", 'bite', 'Characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'quirky', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'always', 'wearing', 'red', 'knee-high', 'boots', 'charming', 'eccentric', 'soon', 'downright', 'irritating', 'endless', 'chattering', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'irritating', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Pinocchio', 'admit', 'still', 'very', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Steve', 'heroine', 'herself', 'comedy', 'kind', 'succeed', 'central', 'character', 's', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'likable', 'can', 'be', 'eccentric', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'have', 'be', 'someone', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'Mary', 'not', 'need', 'someone', 'laugh', 'not', 'sweet', 'neat', 'conclusion', 'film', 'tempting', 'do', 'latter']",All About Steve
