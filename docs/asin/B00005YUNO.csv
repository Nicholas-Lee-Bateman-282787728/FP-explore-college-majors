This film was just a great outing for Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland.  Robert Duvall is miscast and underutilized as the victim of a conspiracy to falsely imprison an American in Mexico.  Bronson is hired to get him out.  Oddly enough, this unlikely scenario actually was a true story; odder still is the fact that Mexican law never considered this scenario and, thus, had no law prohibiting someone from rescuing someone from such a jail.If you are a Bronson fan, you will defintely want this disk; it is funny, sexy, and a taut thriller, rolled into one.

Reading from other reviewers that it comes on widescreen DVD certainly is a persuasive argument to pick it up.I recall seeing the film along with Phase IV, the one about intelligent desert ants on the march. That film was somewhat engrossing but a little offbeat. Its biggest problem though was that it was second on the bill after Breakout which ruled the evening with its cool-dude(Bronson)-in-a-loose-mood attack on the viewer's sensibilities. Just a relaxed Bronson doing his thing and then some. Unfortunately, Robert Duvall's talents are wasted with few lines and a blatently bad toupee; Jill Ireland plays Jill Ireland, and Randy Quaid is immediately suspect in the absence of his usual scene stealing antics although he's still excellent here.And as has been mentioned here by a few people, somebody does get it by a propeller, but it's not poorly done (it was perfect for '70s special effects).

690445,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00005YUNO,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","Bronson was never an actor's actor, not in the traditional sense. A squint & smile did for him what a soliloquy did for Olivier.The prototype for the action stars of today, his real asset was his presence - the man had sheer presence. You could feel the raw energy that boiled under all those ripped muscles. If he growled at you to jump - your only recourse would've been to ask, ""How high?"".Bronson was an honest-to-goodness badass, so any of his films can't be judged based on 'acting' per se. Rather you gauge it on how much fun you had in the viewing. And Breakout was pretty fun.A decent action/adventure flick with one of the most outrageous on-screen death scenes you'll ever see.Typically, when someone dies by way of a plane's propeller, you experience the horror in a splash of red on the blades, the plane fuselage, and/or the ground. This is the first time I can recall seeing a complete 'body' take the devastating hit. Absolutely brutal. And, to be honest, actually kind of a relief and humorous - because it's so clearly a stuffed mannequin going thru a man-sized blender. No such thing as CGI back then.In this film Bronson plays private contractor Nick Colton. His specialty is hot extractions. Hired by the wife of a corporate executive wrongly imprisoned in a Mexican penitentiary, forgotten by his so-called friends and abandoned by our government; she won't leave her husband to die in a third-world craphole. His job - get him out. But not everyone is working toward the same goal.As Nick puts together a ragtag team of hired guns and wilily veterans, can they avoid the pitfalls and traps set up by behind-the-scenes forces to prevent the retrieval? And does the contract and his internal sense of honor mean that Nick has to give up the wife of the executive, whom he's fallen for?Decent addition to the action/thriller library.Movie Notes:- One word of caution. And it's a curious caution. There's an off-putting scene where Bronson's character, Nick, finally expresses his love for the other man's wife. Instead of showing that moment of deep emotion by, say, caressing her cheek or touching the back of her neck - he gently grabs her throat. Now, I'm not sure what that means. I know for a fact that Bronson adored his real-life wife Jill Ireland, who plays the wife in this film. So I can only presume that was a very real, very personal interaction that we're witness to via celluloid; something very intimate that they're sharing with the audience. But if you didn't know about their off-camera relationship - the scene is pretty damn bizarre.***I've added a scan to this product listing with a screen capture of the scene, which lasts an incredible minute and a half***Update 4.28.13 - For reasons I'm unclear on, Amazon has eliminated the screen captured scene I mentioned above for the product listing.

After an initial failure, Colton concocts a plan to drop into the prison in a helicopter, and recruits a team that includes Sheree North, and Randy Quaid, to make it happen.The narrative has some rough spots, as various details are missing, but the central story involving Colton is simple, straightforward, and mostly enjoyable, as Bronson is a nice fit in the dusty desert setting.  Based in part on actual events, Breakout was directed by action specialist Tom Gries (The Glass House,100 Rifles), the creator ofThe Rat Patrol.  Experienced in working in arid locations, Gries does a solid job here, delivering some commendable action scenes for the time period.The wide screen presentation on DVD is a little soft, but image quality is decent enough.  A 3.5 star effort, Breakout is a fun time, featuring a Bronson with a slightly lighter demeanor.  The film is also available as part of a two disc, four film collectionby Mill Creek.  If you appreciate Breakout, be sure to check outBreakheart Pass, an adaptation of Alistair MacLean's novel set in the old West, which is also directed by Tom Gries, and stars Bronson, Ireland, and Duvall.",3,Charles Bronson maneuvers through some unfriendly mexican skies...,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1620,"['When', 'wealthy', 'American', 'Jay', 'Wagner', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Killer', 'Elite', 'railroaded', 'Mexican', 'jail', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'Texas', 'based', 'pilot', 'Nick', 'Colton', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Death', 'Wish', 'St', 'Ives', 'affect', 'rescue.One', 'many', 'films', 'featuring', 'husband', 'wife', 'tandem', 'Bronson', 'Ireland', 'Breakout', 'one', 'better', 'collaborations', 'Chuck', 'Bronson', 'right', 'home', 'shifty', 'operator', 'looking', 'make', 'big', 'score', 'sticking', 'neck', 'out', 'too', 'far', 'initial', 'failure', 'Colton', 'plan', 'drop', 'prison', 'helicopter', 'team', 'Sheree', 'North', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'make', 'happen.The', 'narrative', 'rough', 'spots', 'various', 'details', 'are', 'missing', 'central', 'story', 'involving', 'Colton', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'Bronson', 'nice', 'fit', 'dusty', 'desert', 'setting', 'Based', 'part', 'actual', 'events', 'Breakout', 'was', 'directed', 'action', 'specialist', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'Glass', 'House,100', 'Rifles', 'creator', 'ofThe', 'Rat', 'Patrol', 'Experienced', 'working', 'arid', 'locations', 'Gries', 'solid', 'job', 'here', 'delivering', 'commendable', 'action', 'scenes', 'time', 'period.The', 'wide', 'screen', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'little', 'soft', 'image', 'quality', 'decent', 'enough', '3.5', 'star', 'effort', 'Breakout', 'fun', 'time', 'featuring', 'Bronson', 'slightly', 'lighter', 'demeanor', 'film', 'also', 'available', 'part', 'two', 'disc', 'four', 'film', 'collectionby', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'appreciate', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'outBreakheart', 'Pass', 'adaptation', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'novel', 'set', 'old', 'West', 'also', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'stars', 'Bronson', 'Ireland', 'Duvall']",Breakout

My favorite scene in the film is when his character, a licensed pilot is trying to learn how to fly a helicopter. Flying a helo and a plane are completely different, as his character quickly discovers. Interaction between his instructor, his characters disbelief at not never being able to be as good as the instructor are priceless.This is a great film to wile away a rainy day or boring afternoon.
