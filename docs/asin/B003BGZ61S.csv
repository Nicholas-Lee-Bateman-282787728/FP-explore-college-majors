The picture on this review is of the complete set produced by Mill Creek.  There are several problems when defining this set.  The last 4 episodes were never aired and there was a pilot filmed for ""The Greatest American Heroine"" which is not actually part of the Greatest American Hero.  So this complete set is on 9 disks and contains all 43 episodes including the un-aired ones.  However it does not include the Greatest American Heroine.  That has to be purchased separately.The Greatest American Heroine / The Return of Hunter / Jake Lassiter / The Great PretenderAnchor Bay Entertainment company released the complete series in DVD format in Region 1 for the first time during 2005. Additionally, on October 3, 2006, they released a special 13-disc boxed set that includes all 43 episodes of the series as well as other bonus material. However, both the individual DVD sets and the complete boxed set are missing original performances by Mike Post and Joey Scarbury whenever the song concerned originated by another artist. As of 2009, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.On October 14, 2009, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment company had acquired the rights to several Stephen J. Cannell series including The Greatest American Hero. They subsequently re-released the first season as well as a complete series box set on May 18, 2010. Season 2 was re-released on October 12, 2010.On November 10, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment released The Greatest American Heroine TV movie on DVD.The Greatest American HeroineDuring 1986, the original principal cast reunited for a pilot movie for a new NBC series to be named The Greatest American Heroine, which did not result in a new series, and the pilot was never broadcast by NBC. Ultimately, the pilot was reedited as an episode of the original series (complete with original opening credits and theme), and added to syndication sets of the original series, for which it is the final episode. Immediately after the beginning credits, the episode's title card is superimposed over a nighttime view of the Los Angeles skyline, reading ""The Greatest American Hero"" before appending the letters ""i n e"" individually to the sound of the NBC chimes. Once famous, Ralph hosted Saturday Night Live and became a regular guest of The Tonight Show both of which are NBC series.The pilot movie reveals that several years after the final episode, Ralph's secret identity was finally revealed to the public, resulting in his becoming a celebrity. This angers the aliens who gave him the suit, and they charge him with finding a new hero to wear the costume and use its powers for fighting evil. Once the transfer is made, they explain, all memory of Ralph's exploits will be purged from the world's memory and only to be remembered only by Ralph, Pam, and Bill.Bill begins their search by researching people with desired hero qualities, but Ralph finds a young woman named Holly Hathaway (Mary Ellen Stuart), an elementary school teacher who spends her off-hours time looking for lost kittens, raising environmental awareness, and serving as a foster mother. The rest of the episode deals with her learning how to use the suit with Bill Maxwell's guidance, and the pair trying to develop a working relationshipIf your looking for the complete box set with the cape and notebook try here.The Greatest American Hero - The Complete Series (Free Cape and Notebook Included)",4,Lets see if we can sort this out,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,3478,"['are', 'several', 'different', 'releases', 'picture', 'review', 'complete', 'set', 'produced', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'when', 'defining', 'set', 'last', '4', 'episodes', 'were', 'never', 'aired', 'was', 'pilot', 'filmed', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'not', 'actually', 'part', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'So', 'complete', 'set', '9', 'disks', '43', 'episodes', 'including', 'un-aired', 'ones', 'However', 'not', 'include', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'be', 'purchased', 'separately.The', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', '/', 'Return', 'Hunter', '/', 'Jake', 'Lassiter', '/', 'Great', 'PretenderAnchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'company', 'released', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'format', 'Region', '1', 'first', 'time', '2005', 'Additionally', 'October', '3', '2006', 'released', 'special', '13-disc', 'boxed', 'set', '43', 'episodes', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'material', 'However', 'individual', 'DVD', 'sets', 'complete', 'boxed', 'set', 'are', 'missing', 'original', 'performances', 'Mike', 'Post', 'Joey', 'Scarbury', 'whenever', 'song', 'concerned', 'originated', 'artist', '2009', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'discontinued', 'are', 'print.On', 'October', '14', '2009', 'was', 'announced', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'company', 'had', 'acquired', 'rights', 'several', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'series', 'including', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'subsequently', 're-released', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'May', '18', '2010', 'Season', '2', 'was', 're-released', 'October', '12', '2010.On', 'November', '10', '2011', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'released', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'TV', 'movie', 'DVD.The', 'Greatest', 'American', 'HeroineDuring', '1986', 'original', 'principal', 'cast', 'reunited', 'pilot', 'movie', 'new', 'NBC', 'series', 'be', 'named', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'did', 'not', 'result', 'new', 'series', 'pilot', 'was', 'never', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'Ultimately', 'pilot', 'was', 'reedited', 'episode', 'original', 'series', 'complete', 'original', 'opening', 'credits', 'theme', 'added', 'syndication', 'sets', 'original', 'series', 'final', 'episode', 'Immediately', 'beginning', 'credits', 'episode', 'title', 'card', 'superimposed', 'nighttime', 'view', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'skyline', 'reading', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'appending', 'letters', 'i', 'n', 'e', 'individually', 'sound', 'NBC', 'chimes', 'Once', 'famous', 'Ralph', 'hosted', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'became', 'regular', 'guest', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'are', 'NBC', 'series.The', 'pilot', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'final', 'episode', 'Ralph', 'secret', 'identity', 'was', 'finally', 'revealed', 'public', 'resulting', 'becoming', 'celebrity', 'aliens', 'who', 'gave', 'suit', 'charge', 'finding', 'new', 'hero', 'wear', 'costume', 'use', 'powers', 'fighting', 'evil', 'transfer', 'made', 'explain', 'memory', 'Ralph', 'exploits', 'will', 'be', 'purged', 'world', 'memory', 'only', 'be', 'remembered', 'only', 'Ralph', 'Pam', 'Bill.Bill', 'search', 'researching', 'people', 'desired', 'hero', 'qualities', 'Ralph', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Holly', 'Hathaway', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'Stuart', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'off-hours', 'time', 'looking', 'lost', 'kittens', 'raising', 'environmental', 'awareness', 'serving', 'foster', 'mother', 'rest', 'episode', 'deals', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'suit', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'guidance', 'pair', 'trying', 'develop', 'working', 'relationshipIf', 'looking', 'complete', 'box', 'set', 'cape', 'notebook', 'try', 'here.The', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Free', 'Cape', 'Notebook', 'Included']",N/A

1335540,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B003BGZ61S,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This is just a review of the series, not the collectable packaging.The series was created to ride the wave of popularity (and in some ways spoof) the original Superman movie, which came out a few years before this aired.  The premise was a regular guy is given a suit that gives him super powers (by aliens)but he loses the instructions so he has no idea how it really works.  He teams up with an FBI agent and his attorney girlfriend to fight crime.  So, it is really part superhero, part buddy cop, and part comedy.The show aired in the very early 1980s.  As such the special effects were pretty cheesy, and the writing in some areas are hilarious today for different reasons.  For example the kids they were trying to portray as tough or bad were far different then than would be done now.  Also, many of the story lines were cold war themed given the era.  Because of that if you did not at least grow up around that time you probably will not get all of the references.  That said the show was very good, and is one that really stands the test of time.What I personally liked about the show is that it really never tried to take itself too seriously.  And while it did go off on some strange tangents (like the electricity monster episode) it managed to stay entertaining throughout its run.  I think all three of the main actors did great jobs with their characters.  William Katt really did feel ridiculous in the suit, and that came across in his performance.  Robert Culp was great as the chauvinistic my way or the highway FBI agent, and Connie Sellica was more than just eye candy on the show, many times playing the ""straight man"" role.  As different as the characters were, it seemed all the actors had very good chemistry which came across in the performances, and you bought that the characters really cared about each other.  And the relationship between the characters was really what made the series work.Some reviews mention that the music was not the same as when originally aired.  I was too young when the show was actually on TV to remember any of the music other than the main theme, however as is the case with many older shows it likely ran into copyright issues and had to change some of the songs that were played.  Chances are it will not be an issue for a lot of people, but it may be for some.  Personally I would rather have the series available on DVD without the original music than not have it at all.  The only unfortunate thing about the series is that it never had a proper ending.  It only had a 13 episode final season, and the way it ended seems like it was cancelled abruptly halfway through season three.  So the final episode of the series really feels just like any other.",5,A great series,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2717,"['just', 'review', 'series', 'not', 'collectable', 'packaging.The', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'ride', 'wave', 'popularity', 'ways', 'spoof', 'original', 'Superman', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'aired', 'premise', 'was', 'regular', 'guy', 'given', 'suit', 'super', 'powers', 'aliens', 'instructions', 'idea', 'how', 'really', 'up', 'FBI', 'agent', 'attorney', 'girlfriend', 'fight', 'crime', 'So', 'really', 'part', 'superhero', 'part', 'buddy', 'cop', 'part', 'comedy.The', 'show', 'aired', 'very', 'early', '1980s', 'such', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'writing', 'areas', 'are', 'hilarious', 'today', 'different', 'reasons', 'example', 'kids', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'tough', 'bad', 'were', 'far', 'different', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'now', 'Also', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'cold', 'war', 'themed', 'given', 'era', 'did', 'not', 'least', 'grow', 'up', 'time', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'references', 'said', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'test', 'time.What', 'personally', 'liked', 'show', 'really', 'never', 'tried', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'did', 'go', 'off', 'strange', 'tangents', 'electricity', 'monster', 'episode', 'managed', 'stay', 'entertaining', 'run', 'think', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'jobs', 'characters', 'William', 'Katt', 'really', 'did', 'feel', 'ridiculous', 'suit', 'came', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'was', 'great', 'chauvinistic', 'way', 'highway', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Connie', 'Sellica', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'show', 'many', 'times', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'role', 'As', 'different', 'characters', 'were', 'seemed', 'actors', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'came', 'performances', 'bought', 'characters', 'really', 'cared', 'other', 'relationship', 'characters', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'work.Some', 'reviews', 'mention', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'TV', 'remember', 'music', 'other', 'main', 'theme', 'however', 'case', 'many', 'older', 'shows', 'likely', 'ran', 'copyright', 'issues', 'had', 'change', 'songs', 'were', 'played', 'Chances', 'are', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'issue', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'Personally', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'original', 'music', 'not', 'have', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'series', 'never', 'had', 'proper', 'ending', 'only', 'had', '13', 'episode', 'final', 'season', 'way', 'ended', 'was', 'cancelled', 'abruptly', 'halfway', 'season', 'three', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'really', 'feels', 'just', 'other']",N/A

Believe it or not - the series still holds up remarkably well.This box set does not.The Greatest American Hero was previously released by Starz/Anchor Bay on home video in individual seasons. This set comes to us via Mill Creek - a company with a notorious reputation for shoddy DVD authoring. I have the Anchor Bay editions. They're not perfect, but they lack the incredible amount of edge enhancement and troublesome compression issues of this set. Anchor Bay's editions have eye-popping color and a good solid amount of fine detail present. This release lacks virtually all of those virtues. Colors are faded - badly. The compression issues are a disaster - blotchy color, video noise, tiling, background distortions, edge enhancement - virtually any anomaly you can think of is present.

This was a pilot that wasn't picked up but was released as the final episode of the Greatest American Hero Series.  So you'll watch this whole set and miss the final episode.  So I'm knocking off another star.  If I knew it wasn't the complete series, as it claims, I would probably have still bought it for fifteen bucks.  I'll get that much entertainment value of of it.  But it's frustrating to watch a series and not get the final episode.  So know what you're getting, enjoy it, and just realize you'll have to watch the final episode somewhere else.While this video series is on Hulu (as of today, at least), it doesn't have the final episode either.---On the plus side, I loved this show as a kid and this set was cheap.  On the negative side, the packaging reflects the cheap price.  The discs are in black paper sleeves, packed in a single, hokey plastic case.  The plastic outer cover on my DVD box is ripped.

It sounded as if it were a cheap broken box and scratched DVD's. That was not my experience at all. The box was not broken and even tho the DVD's were in paper sleeves, it did not take away from the quality. All DVD's were in good shape and no faults in any of them. I had watched this series faithfully when it was originally on TV. I actually didn't remember the story lines, so I really enjoyed seeing it again. I didn't want to review it until I had watched all the DVD's in the box. All were great. Sorry it had to end. The price went down just as I was going to order, so it was a no-brainer, such a great deal.  I did not buy the set with a cape and instruction book. The DVD's were enough to satisfy me.It wins my recommendation.Amazon is always my favorite online shopping site.
