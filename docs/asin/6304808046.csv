On their way to their honeymoon in Miami Lenny realizes that Linda's various idiosyncrancies are  driving him crazy. In Miami he meets Kelly (Cybill Sheperd) a young-WASP  beauty whose lustful innuendoes he falls under. After 2 days of courting  her he decides to leave Lina and go away with Kelly. He follows her to  Minnesota where he plans to marry her. However, Kelly's rich parents object  to her seeing the undaunted Lenny. But he shamelessly fights for Kelly's  hand in marriage.Critique: Extremely funny, satirical film adapted by  Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. It is Charles Grodin's best outing,  proving that once he could act and have a comic touch (his persona has  become strangely wooden, as if entranced or something). Lenny is the  ultimate, unthinkable 'schmuck' who cons his way into any situation. The  comedy of the film relies on his unnerving pursuit of Kelly, and how his  ridiculous lies and deceit work to his favor. Trying to pass himself as an  honest, likable fella, we are astonished that Kelly even notices him.  Thinking that 'honesty is the best policy', he repeatedly infuriates those  around him with his pathetic stories. Inspite of all this, we can relate to  this guy. Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when  pursuing our lusts. At the end, you really have to admire the guy for  trying. After all, the never say attitude sometimes works.QUOTE: Lenny:  &quot;You were very attracted to me. You were? . . That's cute, that's a  really cute thing.

436003,A3O90G1D7I5EGG,6304808046,dev1,"[13, 15]","On the surface, The Heartbreak Kid is a small movie with a simple plot. Lenny (Charles Grodin) dumps his wife (Lila played by Jeannie Berlin) of five days to pursue a beautiful coed (Kelly played by Cybill Shepherd). Standing between Lenny and Kelly is Kelly's possessive father (Mr. Corcoran). Character portrayal is almost perfect. Charles Grodin is convincing as the self-centered and reckless Lenny. Finding an actress more capable of playing the naive and boy-teasing Kelly (Cybill Shepherd) would have been very difficult. Eddie Albert (Mr. Corcoran) stands like a brick wall between Lenny and his conquest (Kelly).More interesting than the character portrayal and story line are the underlying motives of the characters, and the consequences of their actions. Lenny abandons his wife (Lila), and leaves her brokenhearted. He is headstrong and determined, but also callous and foolish. Kelly's affection for Lenny is quite immature: she see's him as a strong father figure although he is actually egotistical and, quit frankly, short-sighted. The most mature and rational character in the film is Mr. Corcoran. The Heartbreak Kid works as a lighthearted love story; that is, cute boy wins cute girl despite their social, economic and religious differences. Thankfully, The Heartbreak Kid doesn't attempt to promote any moral themes. If it did, the film would fail. The viewer could not be satisfied with the nice cute boy wins nice cute girl conclusion because the boy (Lenny) cares for no one except himself.

436005,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6304808046,Frederick Baptist,"[2, 6]","From the opening scenes accompanied with the opening sound track the similarities with a much better comedy ""The Graduate"" becomes clear.  The Simon and Garfunkel-sounding clone track to the very ""odd"" ending borrow heavily from ""The Graduate"" formula.  Both films cover taboo topics and things that just weren't done in those days designed to shock and entertain the audience at the same time.  Both make heavy use of the popular music soundtrack with Burt Bacharach's doing here what Simon & Garfunkel's did to much better effect on ""The Graduate"".  I sympathise with another reviewer who's just as confused as I was a couple of years back with the choices for AFI best ever comedies and I think the selection criteria had nothing to do with films that necessarily make you laugh until you split your sides but more so films with ""substance"" as well although I am not suggesting that I believe this film should be among the list either.The ""substance"" here is arguably the directing skills of Elaine May although I have to say that the best part of the movie which earns it at least 2 stars is the ""Confession"" scene and Jeannie Berlin thoroughly deserved her Oscar nomination for a fantastic job making you laugh and mostly feel her intense heartbreak when she realises that the man she loved has severely betrayed her.  First class acting!The DVD is disappointing though in that although there are no white spots and other age-related imperfections which ironically means that the master was hardly ever used often enough which speaks volumes for the on-going popularity (or rather lack)of this film but the overall picture quality barely rises above the level of average VHS quality.  The sound quality is Dolby Digital Mono which is okay by Mono standards but nothing to shout about.  There are also no Special Features worth mentioning about.Overall, this is an amusing but mostly chastising and thought-provoking film about people using people for their own selfish desires without considering the consequences to the ""innocents"" that they hurt along the way.  Grodin's character victimises the ""innocent"" Berlin's character just as Shepherd's character victimises Grodin's early on although the telling ending speaks volumes suggesting Grodin's character is still not satisfied and that even more heartbreak is on the cards as he seeks to fulfil his insatiable desires irrespective of the costs on others who have the misfortune to be in his path.Interesting film but poor dvd version that makes you wonder why you should ""upgrade"" from the VHS.

436011,APN6DO7VHDLTN,6304808046,Missing Person,"[1, 6]","This is an intriguing movie with a lot of things going for it, but it ends up falling disappointingly short of greatness. The movie was directed by Elaine May, and the screenplay was written by Neil Simon. Charles Grodin plays Lenny who meets his dream girl Kelly, played by Cybill Shepherd, but unfortunately, he meets her while on his honeymoon with his wife Lila, played by Jeannie Berlin. Certainly, Cybill is great in this movie--funny, charming, and seductive, it's no wonder that Lenny would fall head over heels for her. There are some highly amusing scenes here such as the scene where Grodin gives three of Kelly's classmates a ""drug test"", and the one-on-one scene with Grodin and Eddie Albert. Plus, the movie's oh-so-'70s theme song is amusingly fun.  The ending of the movie is also clever and intriguing.However, the movie is frequently awkward, and although that's probably intentional, the script comes up short in many places, and at times the acting misses the mark as well. There are some really overblown moments between Grodin and Jeannie Berlin where Grodin painfully overacts. For example, there's the part when he unexpectedly screams at her in the scene where she's lying on the bed with an awful sunburn and he informs her he's going to get a beer. Another example is the part where he gets deliriously defensive when she questions if he's telling the truth over a story that he totally made up as an excuse to spend time with Kelly. Grodin is also cringe-worthy in the scene with him by the fire in the cabin with Shepherd, although it's the lame lines of which he's been given that are more at fault than his acting.I also want to point out that I find it rather curious that this movie gets classified as a comedy, because it really leans more towards a drama. I mean, if the drawn out, melodramatic scene with Lenny and Lila at the seafood restaurant is supposed to be particularly funny, I find that disturbing.Overall, still a pretty good movie despite all of its faults--Cybill Shepherd's performance is a must see, and Grodin and Albert have their moments as well, but the movie does leave one feeling frustratingly unsatisfied.",3,"pretty good, but comes up frustratingly short",1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2163,"['intriguing', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'going', 'up', 'falling', 'disappointingly', 'short', 'greatness', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Elaine', 'May', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Lenny', 'who', 'dream', 'girl', 'Kelly', 'played', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'unfortunately', 'honeymoon', 'wife', 'Lila', 'played', 'Jeannie', 'Berlin', 'Certainly', 'Cybill', 'great', 'movie', 'funny', 'charming', 'seductive', 'wonder', 'Lenny', 'would', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'are', 'highly', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'here', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Grodin', 'three', 'Kelly', 'drug', 'test', 'one-on-one', 'scene', 'Grodin', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'movie', ""oh-so-'70s"", 'theme', 'song', 'amusingly', 'fun', 'ending', 'movie', 'also', 'clever', 'intriguing.However', 'movie', 'frequently', 'awkward', 'probably', 'intentional', 'script', 'up', 'short', 'many', 'places', 'times', 'acting', 'mark', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'really', 'overblown', 'moments', 'Grodin', 'Jeannie', 'Berlin', 'where', 'Grodin', 'painfully', 'example', 'part', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'screams', 'scene', 'where', 'lying', 'bed', 'awful', 'sunburn', 'going', 'get', 'beer', 'example', 'part', 'where', 'deliriously', 'defensive', 'when', 'questions', 'telling', 'truth', 'story', 'totally', 'made', 'up', 'excuse', 'spend', 'time', 'Kelly', 'Grodin', 'also', 'cringe-worthy', 'scene', 'fire', 'cabin', 'Shepherd', 'lame', 'lines', 'been', 'given', 'are', 'more', 'fault', 'acting.I', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'find', 'rather', 'curious', 'movie', 'classified', 'comedy', 'really', 'more', 'towards', 'drama', 'mean', 'drawn', 'out', 'melodramatic', 'scene', 'Lenny', 'Lila', 'seafood', 'restaurant', 'supposed', 'be', 'particularly', 'funny', 'find', 'disturbing.Overall', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'faults', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'performance', 'must', 'see', 'Grodin', 'Albert', 'have', 'moments', 'well', 'movie', 'leave', 'one', 'feeling', 'frustratingly', 'unsatisfied']",The Heartbreak Kid VHS

To use a cliche, watching this movie is like watching a car wreck. You cringe, you laugh, you shake your head in disbelief (yet you believe all the same!) as Lenny, played by Charles Grodin, manipulates his bovine wife and sets the stage to marry the Cybil Shepherd character.

Two films released at the start of that decade, both in a sense dark comedies, capture the essence of navel-gazing and the drive for upward mobility that epitomized the era.In ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"", Richard Benjamin stars as a success-at-any-cost husband who rides his wife mercilessly for her unwillingness to play the role of dutiful corporate wife. Two years after ""Housewife"", Charles Grodin assumed the role of Lennie, a malevolently charming newlywed who dumps his bride during a severe attack of libido in Elaine May's ""Heartbreak Kid"".With Benjamin's character, it's all about whipping the wife into line so he can ride the crest of success. Lennie, Grodin's character, only knows that there's some sort of mountain to be conquered - in this case, Cybil Shepherd - but initially fails to grasp the implications of what she can do for him socially and financially. In the end, each of these extended adolescents doesn't quite know what to make of their place in the world - it takes someone half Lennie's age to ask a basic question that he can't quite digest.Both Benjamin and Grodin give stunning performances in their respective vehicles - each pouts pitifully and uses his voice in a wonderfully deprecating way at times - but because of the nature of their respective characters, Grodin is given much freer rein to let it all loose. And that he does, turning in the finest performance of his career through bouts of surface charm, sarcasm, unctuousness and inner loneliness. ""Heartbreak"" is a very funny satire about a man-boy who wants to have it all and does his damnedest to make it happen, half-faking it as he goes. With an inspired script and exceptional acting by all - but most especially by Grodin - it's one for the time capsule.",5,"Great, Funny Treatment of Extended Adolescence",1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,1924,"['Social', 'critic', 'Tom', 'Wolfe', 'once', 'labeled', 'Seventies', 'Me', 'Decade', 'when', 'self-absorption', 'was', 'high', 'fashion', 'especially', 'white', 'males', 'major', 'metropolitan', 'areas', 'Two', 'films', 'released', 'start', 'decade', 'sense', 'dark', 'comedies', 'capture', 'essence', 'navel-gazing', 'drive', 'upward', 'mobility', 'epitomized', 'era.In', 'Diary', 'Mad', 'Housewife', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'success-at-any-cost', 'husband', 'who', 'wife', 'mercilessly', 'unwillingness', 'play', 'role', 'dutiful', 'corporate', 'wife', 'Two', 'years', 'Housewife', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'assumed', 'role', 'Lennie', 'malevolently', 'charming', 'newlywed', 'who', 'bride', 'severe', 'attack', 'libido', 'Elaine', 'May', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', '.With', 'Benjamin', 'character', 'whipping', 'wife', 'line', 'can', 'ride', 'crest', 'success', 'Lennie', 'Grodin', 'character', 'only', 'sort', 'mountain', 'be', 'conquered', 'case', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'initially', 'grasp', 'implications', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'socially', 'financially', 'end', 'extended', 'adolescents', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'place', 'world', 'someone', 'half', 'Lennie', 'age', 'ask', 'basic', 'question', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'digest.Both', 'Benjamin', 'Grodin', 'give', 'stunning', 'performances', 'respective', 'vehicles', 'pouts', 'pitifully', 'voice', 'wonderfully', 'deprecating', 'way', 'times', 'nature', 'respective', 'characters', 'Grodin', 'given', 'much', 'freer', 'rein', 'let', 'loose', 'turning', 'finest', 'performance', 'career', 'bouts', 'surface', 'charm', 'sarcasm', 'unctuousness', 'inner', 'loneliness', 'Heartbreak', 'very', 'funny', 'satire', 'man-boy', 'who', 'have', 'damnedest', 'make', 'happen', 'half-faking', 'inspired', 'script', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'most', 'especially', 'Grodin', 'one', 'time', 'capsule']",The Heartbreak Kid VHS

436016,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,6304808046,Robin Simmons,"[3, 4]","Elaine May first gained faim as one half of the acerbic, droll, brilliant comedy team with partner Mike Nichols.Her comic genius inevitably propelled her into film.  But between 1971 and 2010, she is only credited as writer and director on four films including the financially disastrous but underrated Ishtar - a very funny film that remains essentially unseen.  (Now nice it would be to have a hi-def version with commentary by stars Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman and director May).The Heartbreak Kid is one of those gems that has lost none of it's sheen over time.  Written by Neil Simon at the top of his considerable comic powers, and starring a perfectly cast Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, this film is considered to be May's best work behind the camera.  Sadly, it remains among the least recognized comedies of the 70s.The premise is perfect and the execution is flawless.  Charles Grodin is Lenny.  On his honeymoon, he meets the girl (Shepherd) of his dreams.  Lenny pursues the dream to his inevitable doom - bit remains oblivious of the reality of his madness.This film is a perfectly matched bookend to May's former partner's equally brilliant, now iconic movie The Graduate.  Shepherd's character is flattered and amused at her pursuer's single-minded madness and allows it to continue, hardly encouraging Grodin's character, because she is spoiled, privileged, bored and wonders how it will end.  He's a mere diversion.  That theme is the same thing that movies do best -- divert and amuse.  And that's all Grodin's character offers to Shepherd's aloof wasp goddess.  The movie is a brilliant metaphor of why we love movies.  And that's why I consider this one of those rare, almost perfect films.Writer Simon's clear insight into human foibles and unchecked desires fuels the engine but it's May's intuitive sense of a schmuck's dream for a golden shiksa that drives it.Highly recommended but very hard to find on DVD.This needs to be re-issued in Blu-ray with commentaries by May, Grodin and Shepherd!",5,A SCHMUCKS HONEYMOON DREAM OF A GOLDEN SHIKSA,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2024,"['Elaine', 'May', 'first', 'gained', 'faim', 'one', 'half', 'acerbic', 'droll', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'team', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Nichols.Her', 'comic', 'genius', 'inevitably', 'propelled', 'film', '1971', '2010', 'only', 'credited', 'writer', 'director', 'four', 'films', 'including', 'financially', 'disastrous', 'underrated', 'Ishtar', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'essentially', 'unseen', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'hi-def', 'version', 'commentary', 'stars', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'director', 'May', '.The', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'one', 'gems', 'lost', 'none', 'sheen', 'time', 'Written', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'top', 'considerable', 'comic', 'powers', 'starring', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'film', 'considered', 'be', 'May', 'best', 'work', 'camera', 'Sadly', 'least', 'recognized', 'comedies', '70s.The', 'premise', 'perfect', 'execution', 'flawless', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Lenny', 'honeymoon', 'girl', 'Shepherd', 'dreams', 'Lenny', 'dream', 'inevitable', 'doom', 'bit', 'oblivious', 'reality', 'madness.This', 'film', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'bookend', 'May', 'former', 'partner', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'now', 'iconic', 'movie', 'Graduate', 'Shepherd', 'character', 'flattered', 'amused', 'pursuer', 'single-minded', 'madness', 'continue', 'hardly', 'encouraging', 'Grodin', 'character', 'spoiled', 'privileged', 'bored', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'mere', 'diversion', 'theme', 'same', 'thing', 'movies', 'do', 'best', 'divert', 'amuse', 'Grodin', 'character', 'offers', 'Shepherd', 'aloof', 'wasp', 'goddess', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'metaphor', 'why', 'love', 'movies', 'why', 'consider', 'one', 'rare', 'almost', 'perfect', 'films.Writer', 'Simon', 'clear', 'insight', 'human', 'foibles', 'unchecked', 'desires', 'fuels', 'engine', 'May', 'intuitive', 'sense', 'schmuck', 'dream', 'golden', 'shiksa', 'it.Highly', 'recommended', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'DVD.This', 'be', 're-issued', 'Blu-ray', 'commentaries', 'May', 'Grodin', 'Shepherd']",The Heartbreak Kid VHS
