THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED 'TEMPTATION- THE CONFESSIONS OF A CONNIVING ADULTERER'. BRANDY WAS ALSO EXCELLENT  AS THE WOMAN WHO WORKS AT A PHARMACY STORE, MEETS THE HUSBAND AND WORKS WITH HIM THERE AND LATER CONFIRMS THAT SHE GOT THE AIDS VIRUS FROM THE MAN THE HUSBAND'S WIFE IS CHEATING WITH. I FEEL SORRY 4 THE HUSBAND. HE WAS A GOOD GUY. HE MAY HAVE 4-GOTTEN HIS WIFE'S BIRTHDAY, BUT I CAN FORGIVE HIM 4 THAT. AS FAR AS THE WIFE IS CONCERNED, SHE TRIES 2 END THE AFFAIR, BUT DECIDES 2 KEEP IT GOING. ALL B-CAUSE THIS GUY IS GETTING HER GIFTS AND SHE'S LETTING THAT NO ACCOUNT WITCH KIM KARDASHIAN BRAINWASH HER INTO WEARING MORE EXPENSIVE CLOTHES, TURNING HER INTO A DISRESPECTFUL TYRANT. THIS ULTIMATELY WOULD B HER DOWNFALL AS HER MOTHER TRIES 2 GET HER 2 UNDERSTAND THAT THE GUY SHE'S GOING OUT WITH IS NO GOOD. LATER WE SEE JUST HOW NO GOOD HE IS WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE APARTMENT, AND WE SEE HER MOTHER WITH THESE WOMEN PRAYING. SHE TELLS HER DAUGHTER 2 LEAVE THIS MAN AND TURN BACK TO THE WAYS OF GOD. SUDDENLY, THE BOYFRIEND GRABS THE MOTHER AND THROWS HER 2 THE GROUND AND THE DAUGHTER IS UPSET. HE GRABS HER AND THEY HEAD BACK 2 HIS APARTMENT WHERE THEY HAVE A CONTINUED ARGUMENT. SUDDENLY, HE SLAPS HER. LATER AT BRANDY'S APARTMENT, WHEN EARLIER THE HUSBAND FINDS HIS WIFE AT A CLUB WITH THE BOYFRIEND AND SHE TELLS HIM 2 FIND SOMEONE ELSE, HE'S HAVING A NICE TALK WITH HER WHEN SHE TELLS HIM THAT THE MAN WHO HIS WIFE IS CHEATING WITH WAS HER BOYFRIEND. FINDING THIS OUT, THEY BOTH HEAD 2 HIS PLACE AND HE FINDS HIM IN BED AND FINDS HIS WIFE BEATEN. HE TAKES HER 2 HIS CAR AND GOES BACK IN THE COMPLEX 2 CONFRONT THE BOYFRIEND. YELLING AT HIM 2 GET UP, THE BOYFRIEND DOES. SUDDENLY, HE TACKLES THE BOYFRIEND, THEY CRASH THROUGH A WINDOW, AND THE HUSBAND STARTS BLASTING ON HIM. BRANDY STOPS HIM FROM DOING FURTHER DAMAGE AND THEY LEAVE. SO NOW WE GET 2 WHERE THE WIFE, OR SHOULD I SAY,NOW EX-WIFE,IS A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR, AND SHE TELLS THIS WOMAN THAT SHE GOT THE AIDS VIRUS FROM THE BOYFRIEND. PITY,PITY,PITY. SHE WENT AND COMMITTED SUICIDE JUST 2 HAVE A FLING. AND NOW SHE'S DIVORCED FROM THE MAN WHO WAS VERY GOOD 2 HER, DESPITE HIS SHORTCOMINGS. SEE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN U SUPPORT THE MOTTO, 'WRONG IS RIGHT'. GETS U ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, UNDENIABLY NOWHERE.

I don't go to the actual theater to watch them but to rent or watch on cable, they're entertaining. Some of his work is kind of corny but I understand he wants to go for moral values. I'm not a religious person myself but I understand having values. However, this movie had to be his worst! I don't know what happened. He's done WAY better than this. I'm actually shocked by all these five star reviews. Maybe I'm not the films core Christian fanbase. This movie was low budget and it showed. Where do I begin? First of all:This Harley(the other man) was not that attractive. His lines were extremely cheesy and he came on too strong. How did a well-educated 25 year old woman fall for that nonsense? He reminded me of one of those flashy, arrogant womanizers you see at the club every friday and saturday night like its a side job! Is this what happens when a woman is only with one man her whole life? Sure glad I didn't marry young! At least when I get married I won't be easily swooned by some dummy in a nice suit cause I peeped that game by the time I was 21.I love Vanessa Williams but that french accent was awful. She would've been better off using her regular American dialect and her character would've been fine with me.Kim Kardashians Oscar worthy performance has been pretty much explained in the other reviews so we'll just let sleeping dogs lye.Brandy was running from this guy as if he was chasing her. He wasn't even checking for her not once throughout the whole movie and she's entering her apartment with a bat! Girl, please!Brice(the husband)! Ugh, I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy as if he's this nice sweet husband who was victimized by his whoring wife? What kind of husband forgets his wife's birthday two years in a row? Did he even bother to mark it down on a calender? Did he really tell his wife that she can realize her dream in 10-15 years cause ""ain't nobody thinking about that right now""? The kicker for me was when she came in to the kitchen wanting to have spontaneous sex with him and he turns her down to go eat a sandwich!  He wanted to go in the bedroom and ""do this the right way"". So because they're a nice christian couple, they can't spice up their sex life? It has to be in the bed, missionary style and no way else? How can you be that clueless to your partner's unhappiness? The guy seemed like he was in his own little world and got so comfortable in his simple little marriage with his simple little Christian wife whom he married a virgin that he neglected to keep the spark in his relationship. The guy was boring, had no passion and no backbone!Judith! Oh Judith! What was up with the awful clothes she had on in the beginning of the movie? You mean to tell me that she was so sheltered growing up that she never learned how to put together a conservative AND stylish outfit? The whole affair was so over the top. Why was she always limping out of the car? Was she on drugs? I didn't see any drug use! Was she drunk? I assume she didn't really drink much before. If she was unhappy she should've just separated from her husband and took some time to herself. The affair seemed exciting only because she was practically locked in the house or the church building growing up. She never dated and from the looks of it, had no friends either. She obviously needed to be alone and find out what SHE wanted.Her mother had to be the most ridiculous character in this whole movie! What a heavy handed,judgemental and self-righteous woman she was. How are you going to come up in to your daughters house with a prayer group uninvited? That is just rude. That is not your house. This woman thought everyone was the devil! Goodness!Why oh why did she have to get HIV? Why did Tyler feel that this was necessary? How was this guy carrying around HIV and still having sex with all these women and running a billion dollar business? Why was he dating these simple middle class local girls? A man of that caliber would be sailing the french riviera with a 20 year old supermodel, not stalking Brandy in Washington DC while trying to seduce  some modest homely married woman with no taste in style. Nothing about this film was realistic at all! It was advertised as a sexy drama but it wasn't sexy and you didn't see any love making, nudity or anything. It was all so dry and rushed! The affair went from 0 to 360 in like fifteen minutes. I'm also sick of this idea that the rich, successful person always has to be some immoral, spiritually lost, evil person because they have money, meanwhile the poor character with a dead end job is so sweet, humble and kind. Does Tyler Perry not have millions? Can you not have money, be well dressed and be a good person too?",1,So over the top!

1634086,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEL4QFO,FNDNreview,"[11, 18]","For a great many people, Tyler Perry is a household name associated with some of the greatest entertainment on the planet.  From stage work to television, and of course on the big screen, Perry has created a brand of entertainment all his own.  He's taken drag to a whole new level, creating the popular character Madea, whom he portrays in a handful of films, including Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Madea's Big Happy Family, and the upcoming film, A Madea Christmas.  However, when he's not portraying Madea (or doing a million other things), he occasionally stars in much more serious roles, like in Good Deeds or Alex Cross.  However, in his newest film - Perry does everything but act, staying behind the camera as writer, producer, and director, for the marriage drama, Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor.Directed by Tyler Perry (Madea's Family Reunion), Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor stars Jurnee Smollett as Judith, a married woman that's frustrated with her position as a therapist for an online dating agency (strictly for the wealthy).  Her husband, Brice (Lance Gross), has been the love or her life since they were young children.  However, both Judith and Brice are highly devoted to their careers, and have settled in to a comfortable, ""boring"" marriage.  Meanwhile, Judith's job pairs her with an internet mogul as she attempts to sell him on the idea of investing in the company she works for - but at the same time, this internet mogul, Harley (Robbie Jones) is much more interested in stealing Judith from her husband.  As Harley and Judith grow closer, her ""temptation"" to cheat on her husband grows to the breaking point.  Vanessa Williams, Brandy Norwood, and Kim Kardashian also star in supporting roles.In general, the theme of ""temptation"" has always made for interesting storytelling, so it's not too difficult to imagine what this film is all about:  characters being tempted.  The story focuses on a semi-happily married couple that is feeling the strains of marriage - both far too comfortable with each other, leaving the ability for them to do is grow apart.  The themes within this film are strong and to the point, so much so that if nothing else, this film will at least have you thinking about the choices you make by the time the credits role.  The main character, Judith, comes from a heavily religious upbringing, and for a woman that knew what she wanted in life, she finds herself being tempted fairly easily.  Her career is stuck in neutral and her marriage has gone stale, so she's easily tempted by the idea of someone new, and especially someone that has the ability to fast-track her career.  At one point, her mother even steps in to say she's being tempted by the devil, which will only lead her to pain and suffering.  In the end, Judith makes her own decisions and has to live with them.  However, if all Judith did was make the right decisions, it would make for a pretty uninteresting film.  And, unfortunately - the theme is the only plausible concept to take away from this poorly executed film.To be honest, I couldn't tell where the plot of this film was headed, but that's mainly because I didn't really care.  These characters are far too full of themselves, worried too much about what they look like, and simply fail to make viewers care about what happens to them.  In the end, there is a pretty sad and significant twist to the direction of this film - but it's an unemotional twist that will simply make you shrug your shoulders.  It's not because the situation isn't sad (because it is), it's that the ""care"" factor is nonexistent by the time the climax comes to pass, leaving nothing more than borderline hate and mistrust for a character that should have made better choices.  At the same time, this film isn't called ""redemption,"" so that should clue you in to what these characters have to look forward to in this lengthy monstrosity.There's no doubt about it - Temptation would be better suited for Lifetime instead of the big screen.  The film is completely devoid of a strong acting presence, and stars a bunch of actors/actresses that you've probably never heard of or will most likely end up on daytime television.  After all, the fact that Kim Kardashian is in the film should tip you off right away that the value of this film's cast is seriously lacking in quality.  Are you serious?  Kim Kardashian is the ""best"" actress (and I say that with complete sarcasm) available to play a role that served absolutely no point to begin with?  If a film begins with a clean slate (meaning an A+), and has to work to keep that grade (which very few films in the history of movie-making have ever achieved), a film will automatically drop 4 letter grades just for casting Kim Kardashian in a role.  It doesn't matter if it's for 15 minutes or 15 seconds, because she offers absolutely nothing to everything.  If there were ever a more worthless person to entertain you, I'm drawing a blank as to who would beat her.The underlying message of this film is simply to think about your choices before you go and ruin your life.  However, for anyone that has an appreciation for the sanctity of marriage, this film will completely slap you in the face.  On the other hand, if you're into greedy, envious people that have no backbone or willpower, you'll probably dig this film.  Still, save yourself two hours and don't watch this movie.  It shouldn't take some pointless Lifetime knockoff drivel (or the money it costs to watch it) to make you think about your choices in life.  But, if you don't believe me - at least do yourself a favor and wait for this film to show up in the bargain bin before you go overspending on it.  If you pay $15 dollars to own it, odds are it will be the most expensive coaster you own.Grade: D-FNDNreview.com",1,"Don't give into 'Temptation,' skip this film at all cost",1373328000,"07 9,

It was low-budget and seems more like a made for TV drama than a theatrical release.As with all of Perry's movies, this one has a great moral or theme that takes real-life situations and brings the most important points home. With the title ""Temptation"" there is no mystery as to what is going to happen in the movie. Girl and boy meet as children in a small, quaint town, fall in love, get married, move to the big city (Washington, DC), girl is educated and in what she thinks is a dead end job, an attractive, rich man starts working at her job and flirts with her, girl decides her husband is boring and falls in ""lust"" with the new man, the new man isn't what he seems, and everyone suffers the consequences. Old story and predictable but it could have been a terrific movie. If only the acting weren't horrible.First, why in the world would anyone cast Kim Kardashian in a movie where she has to talk? That's just dumb from the start. Then as a double no-no, Perry put Brandi in a secondary role. Brandi can barely sing and she acts worse than she sings! Now, Vanessa Williams and Ella Joyce can actually act - but in other films. In this movie they don't have much screen time, which is a shame because all of the other actors need as much help as they can get. I really felt sorry for the leading man, Lance Gross, because he tried his best and did a halfway decent job. Too bad the movie fell down around him.Then, Tyler Perry went overboard with the cliches in the script. The husband is a bit of a whimp and doesn't confront men who are gawking at his wife so of course the other man does confront someone who is oggling her. In addition, the husband has a job as a pharmacy clerk while the wife has her masters degree and graduated early from school. So she feels that she is out-growing him. The other man, Robbie Jones, flaunts his wealth in order to snag the leading lady (tries to seduce her on his private jet) but of course has a secret. The wife's mother is ultra religious and of course she comes to stay with her daughter and son-in-law and notices something is wrong and lectures her with lots of gospel laden advice. And on and on and on. It gets a bit tiring after a while.I wasn't too upset that this movie was so painful to watch because I rented it from RedBox - so it only cost $1.27.

1634116,A6Z6O41DRZQFH,B00BEL4QFO,marsmoon,"[0, 0]","This was my first viewing of a Tyler Perry production so I was expecting a romantic comedy.  Wow, was I surprised.  This film is true to the Black culture yet it also relates to eternal and universal qualities of the human psyche when it comes to dating, relationships, marriage and aging.  The characters could have lapsed into stereotypes, yet here, each also portrayed a deeper level of realism beyond the mask.  The husband was kind of boring and his game fell down, yet he was trying cuz the dude was tired from working hard day in, day out, after all.  His acting seemed kind of thin at times yet there really are guys like him.  The mother seemed like she was Bible thumping, yet the woman had lived a lot of life and could see what was going on with her keen eagle eye.  The wife didn't do anything wrong, she just needed attention and she was frustrated cuz she was busting her rear yet she wasn't realizing her dream fast enough.  Her transformation was intriguing to watch and yet it portrayed yearnings we harbor within, quite a range, and well done in her role.  One wonders what drives the billionaire player within his thought process, which is more implied than stated, the better to ponder, after the movie has ended.  The film raises some good questions about the existential quandary folks can find themselves in, doing the accepted things yet feeling so utterly unhappy and unfulfilled in their lives, hinting at the huge octopus of the system, as they go through their lives.  The director/creator has woven a cautionary tale that doesn't cop out in the end, not to sermonize or to endorse stereotypes, yet to show that as a community, there are some real dangers out there for which we are frail and naive to deal with if we stay in our comfort zones.",4,Heavy Hard Hitting Romantic Drama,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1773,"['was', 'first', 'viewing', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'production', 'so', 'was', 'expecting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'true', 'Black', 'culture', 'yet', 'also', 'eternal', 'universal', 'qualities', 'human', 'psyche', 'when', 'dating', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'aging', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'lapsed', 'stereotypes', 'yet', 'here', 'also', 'deeper', 'level', 'realism', 'mask', 'husband', 'was', 'kind', 'boring', 'game', 'fell', 'down', 'yet', 'was', 'trying', 'cuz', 'dude', 'was', 'tired', 'working', 'hard', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'acting', 'seemed', 'kind', 'thin', 'times', 'yet', 'really', 'are', 'guys', 'mother', 'seemed', 'was', 'Bible', 'thumping', 'woman', 'had', 'lived', 'lot', 'life', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'keen', 'eagle', 'eye', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'just', 'needed', 'attention', 'was', 'frustrated', 'cuz', 'was', 'busting', 'rear', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'realizing', 'dream', 'fast', 'enough', 'transformation', 'was', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'yet', 'portrayed', 'yearnings', 'harbor', 'quite', 'range', 'well', 'done', 'role', 'One', 'billionaire', 'player', 'thought', 'process', 'more', 'implied', 'stated', 'better', 'ponder', 'movie', 'ended', 'film', 'good', 'questions', 'existential', 'quandary', 'folks', 'can', 'find', 'doing', 'accepted', 'things', 'yet', 'feeling', 'so', 'utterly', 'unhappy', 'unfulfilled', 'lives', 'hinting', 'huge', 'octopus', 'system', 'go', 'lives', 'director/creator', 'woven', 'cautionary', 'tale', ""n't"", 'cop', 'out', 'end', 'not', 'sermonize', 'endorse', 'stereotypes', 'yet', 'show', 'community', 'are', 'real', 'dangers', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'frail', 'naive', 'deal', 'stay', 'comfort', 'zones']",Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions Of A Marriage Counselor Digital

But when Judith starts working at a match-making company and has to deal with a new client who is not only charming but owns a billion dollar business, she gets trapped in a net of lust and temptation.Review: I duck the concept of the movie and I thought the trailer looked very dramatic. But boy, was I fooled. First of all, I think making a PG-13 movie with this specific topic is just senseless, because there can't be any violence, swearing or nudity, and that's what this movie needs. I don't know where Tyler Perry tried to go with this story, it could have been so great, I mean there was definitely potential, but the first half was just a lot of talking, the second half was just over-the top, everything happened too fast, and suddenly it was over. The characters didn't get the chance to blossom or develop, which, sadly, didn't even make me feel sorry for any of the characters. This movie was advertising with relatively known actors like Kim Kardashian - which I know I didn't watch it for because she is completely talent- free, bless her little heart - Vanessa Williams or Brandy Norwood, and it was a commercial success, however, as a movie it failed in my opinion and is definitely one of Tyler Perry's weakest movies ever. I appreciated his movies in the past but his recent work is a huge disappointment.Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor is a bad representation of Tyler Perry's work because he is a talented producer, but he doesn't show it recently.For more reviews please VISIT my Blog [...] LIKE my Facebook Page [...] and FOLLOW me on Twitter: @SimonSays_Watch",2,Where is Tyler Perry trying to go with this??,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,1886,"['might', 'like', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Co-ed', 'Call', 'Girl', '1996', 'Madea', 'Goes', 'Jail', '2009', 'Long', 'Story', 'Short', 'Judith', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett-Bell', 'Christian-', 'raised', 'woman', 'husband', 'Brice', 'Lance', 'Gross', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'City', 'Washington', 'abandoning', 'country', 'side', 'when', 'Judith', 'working', 'match-making', 'company', 'deal', 'new', 'client', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'charming', 'billion', 'dollar', 'business', 'trapped', 'net', 'lust', 'temptation.Review', 'duck', 'concept', 'movie', 'thought', 'trailer', 'looked', 'very', 'dramatic', 'boy', 'was', 'fooled', 'First', 'think', 'making', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'specific', 'topic', 'just', 'senseless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'violence', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'what', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'tried', 'go', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'great', 'mean', 'was', 'definitely', 'potential', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'just', 'lot', 'talking', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'just', 'over-the', 'top', 'everything', 'happened', 'too', 'fast', 'suddenly', 'was', 'over', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'blossom', 'develop', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'characters', 'movie', 'was', 'advertising', 'relatively', 'known', 'actors', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'completely', 'talent-', 'free', 'bless', 'little', 'heart', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'Brandy', 'Norwood', 'was', 'commercial', 'success', 'however', 'movie', 'failed', 'opinion', 'definitely', 'one', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'weakest', 'movies', 'ever', 'appreciated', 'movies', 'past', 'recent', 'work', 'huge', 'disappointment.Temptation', 'Confessions', 'Marriage', 'Counselor', 'bad', 'representation', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'work', 'talented', 'producer', ""n't"", 'show', 'recently.For', 'more', 'reviews', 'please', 'VISIT', 'Blog', '[', ']', 'Facebook', 'Page', '[', ']', 'FOLLOW', 'Twitter', '@', 'SimonSays_Watch']",Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions Of A Marriage Counselor Digital

The characters seemingly were written by one person.  The characters are very boring characters and the did not vary in personality as people. The strongest actor out of the movie was Vanessa Williams, albeit a very small part she had.  Kim Khardasian acting was like a horror movie - she was scarely awful!  The part was probably a good part for her to play since the character loves style, clothes, makeup, etc.  And you would think the part wouldn't be a stretch for her and she would be able to jump right in and make the part her own.  She failed.  Her caught-in-headlights doe-eyed stares and over botoxed eyebrows were a distraction and made her expressions appear flat and emotionless.Tyler Perry is attempting to divest from his typical buffoonery movies and I applaud him for his ATTEMPT.

Actually, all though this was mainly an all African-American cast, the story could be any woman's story no matter the financial standing or race.  Being swept off your feet by a billionaire or an everyday working man happens.  It addresses the root of something that is true for most women - we want to feel like our spouse, significant other ""sees"" us and values us.  While some women would have swooned over having a husband that idolizes you but doesn't express himself passionately towards you may not bother some it will others.  Being ""caught up"" with too much attention and falling into temptation is not a topic anyone wants to talk about.

Since it is a Tyler Perry production, the dialouge is mildly humorous with Kim Kardashian giving Judith fashion advice.

1634156,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BEL4QFO,Turfseer,"[5, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***With an extremely low score of '27' on Metacritic, Tyler Perry's Temptation was universally panned by the critics. On Metacritic, Perry managed only 1 positive review, 2 mixed and 11 negatives. Still, the first week the picture came out, it managed a #3 ranking at the box office. Based on his own stage play, Perry has been quoted as saying that the film version is the best thing he's ever written. In reality, Temptation is no different than most of the soap operas out there today. It's a cheap little story, with thin characters and an over-moralizing plot.The protagonist is Judith, a marriage counselor, who provides a cautionary tale of infidelity to a client, pretending that the subject is her sister, but is actually her own life story. During the overlong narration at the beginning of the film, Judith's story is explained in a flashback that serves as most of the film's narrative. Judith married her childhood sweetheart, Brice, who works in a pharmacy. They supposedly have a picture book relationship but it appears Judith is a bit of a social climber, desiring to start her own match making business.Meanwhile, Judith's actual job is working for Janice (Vanessa Williams), who runs a high-end match making agency, seeking clients of substantial means. I found it difficult to believe that Judith could have lasted more than a few days there, as she constantly makes it clear that she resents working at the tawdry agency. Kim Kardashian, plays her bitchy co-worker, Ava, who criticizes her for dressing too conservatively and the two exchange barbs until Judith's sudden about face at the midpoint, when she embraces a new world of 'depravity'.For most of the film, Judith is a rigid, unlikeable character, egged on by her mother 'Miss Sarah', an old-fashioned, fire and brimstone Christian, who predicts her daughter's fall from grace. Perry can do little with Brice, a cookie-cutter 'nice guy', who exhibits few personality traits of interest. All Perry seems to know about Brice's involvement in the pharmacy business is that he must constantly toil, taking care of the 'inventory' which makes him tired, and less attentive to Judith when gets home. Note that it's really irrelevant what kind of work Brice does, as it could be any type of business. Perry is not concerned with fleshing out his characters by focusing on the idiosyncratic details of their lives--only the tawdry plot which will be discussed in a moment.The main plot of Temptation involves Harley, a social media magnate, who is one of Janice's clients at her match making agency, and who she hopes will invest in her company. Harley hardly seems like a Bill Gates type but more like a slick player from the sports world (note again, the characters' professions are irrelevant and interchangeable). He ends up falling for Judith and two thirds of the movie seems more like a story ripped from a Harlequin Romance, with Harley courting Judith at such venues as his private jet, breaking her down and eventually seducing her.From true romance, Perry shifts gears in the third act, attempting to turn his soap opera into a sordid thriller, a la Brian de Palma. Suddenly Harley has morphed into a drug-addicted monster and sucks Judith into the sleazy club world (not very good for his image as social media magnate but more believable as a superstar pro football player). Harley the monster throws Judith's mother to the ground while she's conducting a prayer service with her friends and then ends up beating Judith up, who Brice saves after his co-worker at the pharmacy reveals that Harley did the same thing to her and gave her HIV.The worst part of Temptation is of course Mr. Perry's proclivity toward old-fashioned moralizing. An affair in Mr. Perry's mind can only result in the worst type of consequences. The woman ends up with the 'devil' himself (the repulsive Harley) and is then scarred for the rest of her life. As Judith hobbles down the street at film's end, the scene reminds me of the nightmare sequence from 'It's a Wonderful Life', where Mary Bailey ends up a spinster, working at the public library. Here too, Judith will remain a spinster, joining her boring mother, at church services. Perry takes the side of moralizing Christians, promoting the dictum: 'if you cheat, you pay'.Like most melodramas of this ilk, Tyler Perry doesn't know how to create characters that resemble real people. They are only cheap cardboard cutouts, placed inside a narrative that's been done to death, for years. The fact that this film was financially successful, only goes to show that the tastes of the majority of film goers out there today, are on a very low, aesthetic level.",1,Universally panned soaper
