41774,A1ABXLEBN524RG,0782010660,Avid Runner,"[10, 11]","This multilayered movie from 1985 isn't the best known of Meryl Streep's movies (it got largely overshadowed that year by ""Out of Africa"") and those more in tune to her commercial efforts such as ""Death Becomes Her,"" of ""She-Devil"" will likely be sorely disappointed.Based on David Hare's stage play (recently given a London revival staring the marvelous Cate Blanchett) the story revolves around Susan Traherne a British woman who, when the movie opens, is working as a part of the French resistance during World War II.  The movie then follows her and her life over the next 20 years as show slowly becomes disillusioned with the vacuous society that springs up over the next two decades after the war and begins to question the idealism that led her into the resistance in the first place.Some have been critical of Streep's performance as being ""chilly"" forgetting the fact that this is precisely the traits of the character that the script emphasizes particularly as she begins her downward spiral into dissatisfaction with postwar life.Adding to the strong performacne by Streep is the supporting cast, particaulry Charles Dance as her husband, Tracy Ullman (in her first movie role) as her best friend, and the late John Gielgud as the Brisith diplomat she humilates.  Look also for small, but pivitol, roles from Sting, Ian McKellen and Sam Neil.""There will be days and days like this"" says Susan Traherne as she looks out over a lovely pastoral scene in rural France on a clear day after the war has ended.

41777,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0782010660,Bobby Underwood,"[93, 97]","Meryl Streep gives a heartbreaking performance in this deeply affecting and brilliant film about a woman trapped forever in the past. Susan Traherne might appear on paper to be a selfish and unlikable woman, but Streep somehow manages to let the audience see her inner anguish and restlessness, and her quiet desperation at not being able to recapture the feeling of living life to its fullest; something she experienced during WWII as a Resistance fighter in France. It is one of the most exquisite performances ever captured on film.Fred Schepisi crafted this Edward R. Pressman produced RKO film from a play by David Hare. There is a fine cast which lend support to Meryl Streep, including a winning turn from Tracey Ullman as Susan's wild and irreverent friend, Alice Park. Beautifully shot in several countries, the viewer feels as if they too are trapped in a moment in time. It is a poignant and wistfull moment, however, and in the end, the ache that runs through this story is fully driven home by a flashback of a joyful Susan shortly after the war ended.When the film opens, Susan is waiting in the dark with other Resistance fighters when a paratrooper they had not been expecting lands in their area. Sam Neill is Lazar, who has landed far from his intended location. Once the weapons are lowered and he is identified, Susan will escort him to the nearby village. Lazar saves her life from a group of Germans on night patrol, and Susan's vulnerability in that moment bonds the two together in a tender manner brought about by war.Susan and Lazar will share a brief but intense intimacy only those who have shared some danger with another can understand. When he gets the message to leave due to impending danger, he will leave behind a momento of the time they shared that she will carry with her for life; a reminder of a life with meaning she longs to return to. The Germans murder a man in the streets they believe to be Lazar, while he escapes by bicycle. Susan watches as her life disappears with a touch of the cap; the only gesture he dare show.Susan after the war is restless and strong willed. She wants to change everything but does not know how. She is unable to remain ensconced in a job or situation for any length of time and longs for that hour or two during the Resistance when she saw bravery, and the best in people. It is much more than nostalgia, but a paralyzing ache that will cause her to always move on. Streep lets us see into Susan's soul, and rather than being unsympathetic because of her character's outward actions, we fall in love with her from the inside out and want to save her.She meets a diplomat named Raymond Brock (Charles Dance) who shows kindness to her in a sensitive situation. They have a romance that will eventually come to an end, or so it would seem, when she can not leave the past in France behind and move forward with her life. The one constant during all this turmoil is the spirited Alice (Tracey Ullman). She is a free soul and lives her life as she pleases, which is often to her detriment.Susan's anguish begins to worsen, and once she makes a proposition to a bloke named Mick, her world begins to unravel. Sting is very good as Mick, who is in way over his head with Susan and her friend Alice. Just over his head is where the bullets will land when Susan finally has a mental breakdown. It is Raymond who will return to pick up the pieces. When the ambassador, portrayed with stoic flair by John Gielgud, decides to resign, Raymond will get a post in Egypt, where Susan is far from Europe and her memories.She is also far from herself, as her friend Alice will discover when she comes to visit. The languid pace and sandy colors of Egypt would seem to agree with Susan. She is lovely and sedate, but it is because she is, in fact, sedated. Susan is a picture of serenity, but her spirit is not in evidence. It is only when Alice speaks to Raymond in her defence that she shows a glimmer of her former self.The seed has been planted, and when the ambassador dies, Susan decides to return to England for the funeral, against her husband's wishes. It is in England she will remain, forcing Raymond to abandon his post, effectively ruining his career. Susan does not want him to suffer because of her, and has a talk with his superior with disastrous results. It will force a confrontation between she and Raymond in which she will leave her home. It is a poignant scene as she walks down the street, a bit unsteady. We know she will never return.Lazar tracks her down from a BBC broadcast about the Resistance, and they have a reunion which proves to be too late. France is too far away to reach after so much damage has been done. We will see a joyful and hopeful Susan in a golden field in France after the war, and our hearts will break at a life which never happened.Magnificent is not a strong enough word for Meryl Streep's performance in ""Plenty."" It is one of the most memorable you will ever see in film. A beautiful refrain played by the London Symphony Orchestra haunts this film, and each time I hear it still, I see Meryl Streep in that field in France, with a world of promise in front of her. This is a movie, and a performance, no film lover should miss.",5,A Mackerel Sky,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,5240,"['Meryl', 'Streep', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'deeply', 'affecting',

They have trouble convincing anyone that our lives would be improved by having our property confiscated and distributed to our less fortunate brethren. Yes, it is a hard sell this socialism, which is why most socialists don't talk about the future. Socialism belongs to the past. There is, of course, no socialist utopia that can be pointed out, so here Hare, an old agitprop playwright, has found the French resistance as a metaphor for the utopia he yearns for. In America, leftists identify the 60s as a time for triumphant social involvement. The problem with this kind of nostalgia is that intellectually one fails to face certain brutal truths. The resistance, which no doubt had its moments of personal heroism, was paid for by capitalist America and by the earnings of England's soon to be bankrupted Empire. The 60s were funded by the American business class that bankrolled its children's escapades. Hare's utopia, in short, was a panty- raid, a kind of Spanish Civil War all over again, paid for by the great nascent empire emerging across the Atlantic. Good times were had by all, yes, that is one way of thinking of WWII. Sex, daring, sadness: almost as good as a trip on the Titanic without the iceberg. This play is a thrill, but I don't believe that post-war life was empty and pointless. Susan, Hare's heroine, was a spoiled, cruelly selfish woman who, not unlike pre-war aristocratic adventuresses, simply couldn't find a way to occupy her time once she'd landed a rich husband.",5,Hare Delivers The Goods,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,1622,"['Socialists', 'have', 'serious', 'problem', 'convincing', 'others', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'expansive', 'government', 'have', 'trouble', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'having', 'property', 'confiscated', 'distributed', 'less', 'fortunate', 'brethren', 'Yes', 'hard', 'sell', 'socialism', 'why', 'most', 'socialists', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'future', 'Socialism', 'past', 'course', 'socialist', 'utopia', 'can', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'so', 'here', 'Hare', 'old', 'agitprop', 'playwright', 'found', 'French', 'resistance', 'metaphor', 'utopia', 'America', 'identify', '60s', 'time', 'triumphant', 'social', 'involvement', 'problem', 'kind', 'nostalgia', 'intellectually', 'one', 'face', 'certain', 'brutal', 'truths', 'resistance', 'doubt', 'had', 'moments', 'personal', 'heroism', 'was', 'paid', 'capitalist', 'America', 'earnings', 'England', 'soon', 'be', 'bankrupted', 'Empire', '60s', 'were', 'funded', 'American', 'business', 'class', 'bankrolled', 'children', 'escapades', 'Hare', 'utopia', 'short', 'was', 'panty-', 'raid', 'kind', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'paid', 'great', 'nascent', 'empire', 'emerging', 'Atlantic', 'Good', 'times', 'were', 'had', 'yes', 'one', 'way', 'thinking', 'WWII', 'Sex', 'daring', 'sadness', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'trip', 'Titanic', 'iceberg', 'play', 'thrill', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'post-war', 'life', 'was', 'empty', 'pointless', 'Susan', 'Hare', 'heroine', 'was', 'spoiled', 'cruelly', 'selfish', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'pre-war', 'aristocratic', 'adventuresses', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'occupy', 'time', ""'d"", 'landed', 'rich', 'husband']",N/A

It suggests that for some people, the intensity, fear, and hope of wartime living, the subterfuge of fighting, and an adherence to ideals that inform one's actions can create an unusually vivid experience that makes subsequent, peacetime existence seem dull.&quot;Plenty&quot; gives us a portrait of one woman who was involved on the periphery of combat and the devastation of attacks on her native land.  Susan Traherne's post-war life is calm in comparison.  But placidity is not what she finds satisfying anymore.  Having participated in such extreme conditions, she finds peacetime  hollow.  The rebuilding of society fails to meet the ideals of the fighters she had joined, furthering her sense of alienation.  She drifts amidst work and play that seem trivial in light of the intense events that preceded them.  The bourgeois and privileged life she eventually joins through marriage seems complacent and hypocritical.  She finds a glimmer of what she seeks to recapture in the bohemian, countercultural friend she made at work.  Her rambling attempts to decide between a life that is thrillingly gratifying or one safer but paler make for a story that is interesting for audiences interested in character studies or philosophical inquiries.In addition to an intriguing premise, the execution of the movie is wonderful.  The pacing of the narrative, the use of silence and certain sense memories such as sounds, the use of setting, and the acting by the ensemble are outstanding.

Meryl Streep is once again amazing--mastering another accent--while making it hard to keep your eyes off this prickly, complicated character--from her days as a girl in the French resistence to her slow unraveling as she finds no passion to fill the void left after the war. But there are also masterful supporting performances from Tracy Ullman, Charles Dance, Sam Neil, Ian McKellan, John Geilgud and--yes--Sting. The complex themes and social commentary are serious and the ample humor, dark and biting. Unfortunately, this film was NOT available in letterbox format for sometime and some wonderful scenes are ruined in that format: mostly notably a moment in which Streep and Sting ""do it"" under perverse circumstances on a sofa while Elizabeth II's coronation plays on the telly in the background. The hilarious juxtaposition is lost on the squashed screen. The film also makes great use of sound--the sound of opening parachutes is echoed again and again throughout the film, but largely lost because the cut-down visual context is gone. Even some of the reviews of the film when it initially opened commented on its excellent use of the widescreen frame.

41795,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,0782010660,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[33, 36]","Yes, it was fairly well-reviewed when it came out, but it's more than merely a ""good"" film. I thought it was good the first time I saw it. By the third time I watched it I thought it was great and by the fifth viewing I was awestruck. Plenty is rich, subtle, low key and--for many (not me)--hard to warm up to, because none of the characters is especially lovable, at least not for very long. This isn't a film where you ""root"" for anyone. It's more of a film where you watch, observe, live and breathe in the times, amazed that, even though you've never lived in this period, after this movie you feel as though you have.In the excellent director's interview that comes with this version of the DVD (but not the other, less expensive one, so be sure to fork out the extra bucks and get this issue) Fred Schepisi explains that this is a film about memory. What he modestly doesn't say is he conveys the theme of memory superbly well through his expert direction, with music and lighting and set cues that make us feel as though we are living life with Susan, and that, oddly, we have lived it along with her before. We feel her nostalgia for France when she does. We feel her claustrophobia in her suburban London existence. Plenty is a film of rich textures, one we can almost smell and taste as we watch it.Its themes are rich and multi-faceted. Plenty is about idealism and disillusionment, about hypocracy and naivete, about promises never fulfilled, or that may be unfulfillable.  The heroic ""good"" war, the post-war rise of diplomacy to replace confrontation, the hypocracy of suburban middle-class morality, the belief that the good guys can do anything, so long as they do it in a civil manner, these are just some of the themes of Plenty. And watching it, I was somehow reminded strongly of our present times in many ways. We (Americans) are in a rampant consumer culture, drenched in middle-class morality as we rationalize everything from war with Iraq to plundering oil for our SUVs. We feel we can get away with questionable actions of foreign policy if we go about it diplomatically, because we're ""the good guys."" (John Gielgud's speech to Charles Dance as he explains his disenchantment over Suez, where he says he would have gone along with whatever the government cooked up so long as they would have been honest to him about it, keeps ringing in my ears.) Most of us don't stop to examine our lives, and the fact that at one point Susan goes into advertising (""I don't expect it to stretch me, but maybe it'll be good fun."") made me howl.  The film also deals with class distinctions and rising through the social classes beautifully. Susan goes from working girl to upwardly mobile woman to diplomat's wealthy wife. Her best pal Alice does all this as well, basically following on Susan's coattails in the beginning, but although she starts out rather immature she eventually grows beyond Susan, though she probably would not realize that herself.  It's odd that in a novel, movie or play the secondary character grows beyond the hero(ine), but that is just one twist that makes this work fascinating.It all happens rather subtly. There is no pontificating, no ""morals,"" no dissolves and title cards that say things like ""Eight years later."" No one explains the changes that happen to these characters slowly, over two decades, and they do not seem to notice many of them themselves. Schepisi counts on the viewer to figure it all out. Maybe that's one reason the film has never done well, whether in the theaters, on the critics' lists, or on home video. Another is it's not a very ""American"" movie. Aside from the fact that it deals with Europe and its culture and history, of which most Americans are woefully ignorant, it does not have a single hero or heroine, a single point of view, and a feel-good ending, three essential ingredients for almost any American movie (at least of the last 25 years). As I often find myself saying when it comes to movies I truly love, I'm amazed this got made at all.Streep plays the role of Susan very well (of course), but with perhaps just a bit more restaint and calculation than I would have liked.  We never really see a slow build, an evolution, of her Susan, but instead flashes of sanity as she battles to live in a too-sedate and plastic world.  More impressive are the other characters. Charles Dance is sympathetic (the only somewhat sympathetic character in the movie) as Susan's long-suffering husband Raymond, someone in love with her and yet destinted to never understand her. Tracey Ullman impressively holds her own in every scene with Streep as best friend Alice. And the eclectic casting of the supporting characters--John Gielgud, Ian McKellen, Sam Neill, Sting (!) and Burt Kwok (Kato in the Inspector Clouseau movies, who here has what may be the best line, ""These 'Gyps need whipping!"")--works brilliantly. Schepisi deserves credit for not turning this into a ""mere"" Masterpiece Theater costume drama, which could have easily happened if he'd just plundered the cast of BBC dramas for his actors.Fred Schepisi is one of our more underrated directors. (I say ""ours,"" even though he's from Australia.) And this may be his greatest film. I urge anyone who's curious, though, to watch it several times before making a judgment. As one of the reviewers below said, the film's greatness doesn't hit you the first time. If you give it time, though, it will eventually sweep you away. I just wish some of those critics would give it a few more spins in their DVD players, so that they'd *really* be impressed.

41796,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,0782010660,The Wingchair Critic,"[4, 4]","During an interview in the 1979 September/October edition of WET magazine, Avant-garde musician Nico (1938-1988, real name: Christa P&auml;ffgen) stated her opinion that life was about ""the power of the will to the end."" Nine years later, after almost two decades of heroin addiction and chronic poverty, Nico was, perhaps not surprisingly, dead at the age of fifty. On a methadone regime and moving away from chemical dependency at the time of her death, she died of a head injury after a fall from a bicycle in Ibiza.Fred Schepisi's 'Plenty,' which was released in America in 1985 at the height of Meryl Streep's fame and failed spectacularly at the American box office, is a realistic, grim, educational, and very moving film about many things, but predominantly about a belief in ""the power of the will to the end,"" and where such a personal philosophy can take one.Beautifully adapted and improved upon by David Hare from his own play, 'Plenty,' which takes place over a period of roughly fifteen years, is the story of Susan Traherne (Streep), initially a young Englishwoman posing as a French citizen to aid the French Resistance again the Nazi occupation of France. Living under the terrible strain of being discovered and shot to death in the streets, Susan has a very brief affair with fellow Englishman Lazar (Sam Neill), the memory of which she then romanticizes.Believing on some level that evil and brutishness have been expunged from the world after the fall of the Nazis, Susan returns to post-war England only to find that life is ""worse than it was during the war.""Attempting to find meaning in her life, Susan moves from strategy to strategy, from career to career and from man to man, only to find herself confronted with stupidity, institutionalized sexism, oppression posing as good manners, and near-total gridlock in tense hierarchies as the British Empire forcibly collapses and has to be dismantled.How Susan responds to her circumstances is what 'Plenty' is really about.Though ""mental illness"" is suggested several times throughout the film, and Susan does have one rather vague ""mental breakdown"" and is later severely ""sedated,"" both Hare and Schepisi leave the question of Susan's ""mental illness"" open as just one of the possibilities which might explain Susan's often erratic and sometimes dangerous behavior. 'Plenty' wisely explores and addresses many more facets of life than just mental illness.Susan is a highly intelligent woman who is, above all things, frustrated by the hard facts of existence in post-war Britain and, at varying times, the commonness, the pretentiousness, and the utter ruthlessness of the people around her. Susan, who has personal vision, intuits all that life might potentially be, but cannot find a means to fulfill herself, though she briefly finds solace with her lover (and later, husband) Brock (Charles Dance), and bohemian friend Alice (Tracey Ullman).Susan is Dame Muriel Spark's 'Miss Jean Brodie' (beautifully portrayed by Maggie Smith in the 1969 film adaptation of the novel) taken that many steps further: just as the well-intentioned Miss Brodie ultimately ""assassinates"" herself through naivet&eacute; and carelessness, Susan brings herself down through her maddening inability to come to terms with the hard strictures of reality, the often oppressive nature of power, and her own inability to fulfill her dreams of a better, brighter world. Susan is a fallen Romantic, broken on the rocks.Significantly, Susan also fails to acknowledge and take responsibility for the series of disasters, small and large, which she herself precipitates.It's no surprise that 'Plenty' failed at the American box office, the film being something of the 'Ethan Frome' of American cinema.Though the film is perfect on every level, and beautifully directed, photographed, scored, and acted, its caustic drama and hard message are simply not elements which excite the imagination of mass audiences.Susan herself is a difficult, if not an impossible, character for most people to relate to and sympathize with. Her intelligence, which is superior to almost everyone around her at all times, unfortunately pushes her repeatedly into an arrogant frame of mind, no matter how she attempts to control and temper herself.Additionally, 'Plenty' ends with one of the most painful moments in modern cinema.Meryl Streep is at her finest here, which is unfortunate, as so few have actually seen the film, which remains obscure even among Streep's fans. Producer Joseph Papp later revived the film at Manhattan's Public Theater, but 'Plenty,' a masterpiece of 80s cinema, continues to remain almost unknown.",5,"""The Power of the Will To the End""",1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,4653,"['interview', '1979', 'September/October', 'edition', 'WET', 'magazine', 'Avant-garde', 'musician', 'Nico', '1938-1988', 'real', 'name', 'Christa', 'P', 'auml', 'ffgen', 'stated', 'opinion', 'life', 'was', 'power', 'will', 'end', 'Nine', 'years', 'later', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'chronic', 'poverty', 'Nico', 'was', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'dead', 'age', 'fifty', 'methadone', 'regime', 'moving', 'away', 'chemical', 'dependency', 'time', 'death', 'died', 'head', 'injury', 'fall', 'bicycle', 'Ibiza.Fred', 'Schepisi', ""'Plenty"", 'was', 'released', 'America', '1985', 'height', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fame', 'failed', 'spectacularly', 'American', 'box', 'office', 'realistic', 'grim', 'educational', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'predominantly', 'belief', 'power', 'will', 'end', 'where', 'such', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'can', 'take', 'one.Beautifully', 'adapted', 'improved', 'David', 'Hare', 'own', 'play', ""'Plenty"", 'place', 'period', 'roughly', 'fifteen', 'years', 'story', 'Susan', 'Traherne', 'Streep', 'initially', 'young', 'Englishwoman', 'posing', 'French', 'citizen', 'aid', 'French', 'Resistance', 'again', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'France', 'Living', 'terrible', 'strain', 'being', 'discovered', 'shot', 'death', 'streets', 'Susan', 'very', 'brief', 'affair', 'fellow', 'Englishman', 'Lazar', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'memory', 'then', 'romanticizes.Believing', 'level', 'evil', 'brutishness', 'have', 'been', 'expunged', 'world', 'fall', 'Nazis', 'Susan', 'post-war', 'England', 'only', 'find', 'life', 'worse', 'was', 'war', 'Attempting', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'Susan', 'strategy', 'strategy', 'career', 'career', 'man', 'man', 'only', 'find', 'confronted', 'stupidity', 'institutionalized', 'sexism', 'oppression', 'posing', 'good', 'manners', 'near-total', 'gridlock', 'tense', 'hierarchies', 'British', 'Empire', 'forcibly', 'collapses', 'be', 'dismantled.How', 'Susan', 'circumstances', 'what', ""'Plenty"", 'really', 'about.Though', 'mental', 'illness', 'suggested', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'Susan', 'have', 'one', 'rather', 'vague', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'later', 'severely', 'sedated', 'Hare', 'Schepisi', 'leave', 'question', 'Susan', 'mental', 'illness', 'open', 'just', 'one', 'possibilities', 'might', 'explain', 'Susan', 'often', 'erratic', 'sometimes', 'dangerous', 'behavior', 'wisely', 'explores', 'many', 'more', 'facets', 'life', 'just', 'mental', 'illness.Susan', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'things', 'frustrated', 'hard', 'facts', 'existence', 'post-war', 'Britain', 'varying', 'times', 'commonness', 'pretentiousness', 'utter', 'ruthlessness', 'people', 'Susan', 'who', 'personal', 'vision', 'life', 'might', 'potentially', 'be', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'means', 'fulfill', 'briefly', 'finds', 'solace', 'lover', 'later', 'husband', 'Brock', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'bohemian', 'friend', 'Alice', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', '.Susan', 'Dame', 'Muriel', 'Spark', ""'Miss"", 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Maggie', 'Smith', '1969', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'taken', 'many', 'steps', 'further', 'just', 'well-intentioned', 'Miss', 'Brodie', 'ultimately', 'assassinates', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'carelessness', 'Susan', 'down', 'maddening', 'inability', 'come', 'terms', 'hard', 'strictures', 'reality', 'often', 'oppressive', 'nature', 'power', 'own', 'inability', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'better', 'brighter', 'world', 'Susan', 'fallen', 'Romantic', 'broken', 'rocks.Significantly', 'Susan', 'also', 'acknowledge', 'take', 'responsibility', 'series', 'disasters', 'small', 'large', 'herself', 'precipitates.It', 'surprise', ""'Plenty"", 'failed', 'American', 'box', 'office', 'film', 'being', 'something', ""'Ethan"", 'Frome', 'American', 'film', 'perfect', 'level', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'photographed', 'scored', 'acted', 'caustic', 'drama', 'hard', 'message', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'elements', 'excite', 'imagination', 'mass', 'audiences.Susan', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'character', 'most', 'people', 'relate', 'sympathize', 'intelligence', 'superior', 'almost', 'everyone', 'times', 'unfortunately', 'repeatedly', 'arrogant', 'frame', 'mind', 'matter', 'how', 'control', 'temper', 'herself.Additionally', 'ends', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'moments', 'modern', 'cinema.Meryl', 'Streep', 'finest', 'here', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'few', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'film', 'obscure', 'even', 'Streep', 'fans', 'Producer', 'Joseph', 'Papp', 'later', 'revived', 'film', 'Manhattan', 'Public', 'Theater', ""'Plenty"", 'masterpiece', '80s', 'cinema', 'remain', 'almost', 'unknown']",N/A
41797,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0782010660,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","It seems a cheap shot to say that there's not much to Plenty, but Meryl Streep's rather wearingly one-note performance does tend to show up the thinness of the material. Despite his penchant for bombastic metaphor and excruciatingly on-the-nose dialogue, David Hare's adaptation of his play feels rather closer to naturalism than usual, but when the woman whose dilemma at the heart of his big theme is so resoundingly one-note you do feel as if you're just being told the same thing over and over again. Streep is the former SOE worker who, like Britain itself, was at her best and most noble during the war but struggles to come to terms with the post-war reality of stagnation, emptiness and missed opportunities in a country whose soul-crushing bureaucracy grows as its empire shrinks. Which is a perfectly serviceable metaphor for post-war disillusionment even if the WW2 scenes in France have absolutely no vitality or danger to them to provide much of a contrast. Unfortunately it's another case of the actress giving an accent rather than a performance, and a not entirely convincing one at that. She just says the words, overpronouncing one or two from time to time and plays the superficial surface attention-seeking big moments rather than showing us what's inside, which gets to be like watching Lady MacBeth's mad scene for two hours. Rather than a woman being stifled in a world where expression is frowned upon, there's not much sign that there was ever a person in there to begin with. The only scene where she convinces is the final flashback, and at the cost of losing dramatic irony it may have been better had the scene been moved earlier in the picture to give a sense of the hope and ideals that are dashed.Not that Streep is the only offender. Almost everyone is very visibly giving a performance, as if reminding us that this used to be a play. Tracey Ullman delivers a particularly awful supporting turn, sounding like she's doing a bad voice over for a preschool cartoon character as her affectedly bohemian best friend. Ian McKellan does little more than a second-rate Alan Bates impersonation despite being gifted one of the film's better scenes explaining the diplomatic mindset that has drowned the brief spurt of post-war optimism. Only John Gielgud's betrayed civil servant, stretching himself just a little bit more than his latter roles usually required, and an excellent Charles Dance as Streep's devoted but constantly frustrated minor diplomat husband who never realizes he's the personification of many of her problems really shine. The film improves as it progresses despite Fred Schepisi's often coldly detached direction, and there are good moments - a dinner party from hell at the height of the Suez Crisis chief among them - but they just aren't quite enough to make up for the void at its heart. In a way, this feels like a film that may have been made too soon. Cate Blanchett played the role in a West End revival a few years ago and brought out the nuance and struggle within the character far more convincingly. Still, at least the film does offer Gielgud telling a Burmese diplomat's wife that ""Ingmar Bergman is NOT a bloody Norwegian, he is a bloody Swede.""",2,Less than meets the eye,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,3209,"['cheap', 'shot', 'say', 'not', 'much', 'Plenty', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'rather', 'wearingly', 'one-note', 'performance', 'tend', 'show', 'up', 'thinness', 'material', 'penchant', 'bombastic', 'metaphor', 'excruciatingly', 'on-the-nose', 'dialogue', 'David', 'Hare', 'adaptation', 'play', 'feels', 'rather', 'closer', 'naturalism', 'usual', 'when', 'woman', 'dilemma', 'heart', 'big', 'theme', 'so', 'resoundingly', 'one-note', 'do', 'feel', ""'re"", 'just', 'being', 'told', 'same', 'thing', 'over', 'again', 'Streep', 'former', 'SOE', 'worker', 'who', 'Britain', 'was', 'best', 'most', 'noble', 'war', 'come', 'terms', 'post-war', 'reality', 'stagnation', 'emptiness', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'country', 'soul-crushing', 'bureaucracy', 'empire', 'shrinks', 'Which', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'metaphor', 'post-war', 'disillusionment', 'even', 'WW2', 'scenes', 'France', 'have', 'absolutely', 'vitality', 'danger', 'provide', 'much', 'contrast', 'case', 'actress', 'giving', 'accent', 'rather', 'performance', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'one', 'just', 'words', 'overpronouncing', 'one', 'two', 'time', 'time', 'superficial', 'surface', 'attention-seeking', 'big', 'moments', 'rather', 'showing', 'what', 'inside', 'be', 'watching', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'mad', 'scene', 'two', 'hours', 'Rather', 'woman', 'being', 'stifled', 'world', 'where', 'expression', 'frowned', 'not', 'much', 'sign', 'was', 'ever', 'person', 'there', 'begin', 'only', 'scene', 'where', 'final', 'flashback', 'cost', 'losing', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'scene', 'been', 'moved', 'earlier', 'picture', 'give', 'sense', 'hope', 'ideals', 'are', 'Streep', 'only', 'offender', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'very', 'visibly', 'giving', 'performance', 'reminding', 'used', 'be', 'play', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'particularly', 'awful', 'supporting', 'turn', 'sounding', 'doing', 'bad', 'voice', 'preschool', 'cartoon', 'character', 'affectedly', 'bohemian', 'best', 'friend', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'little', 'more', 'second-rate', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'impersonation', 'being', 'gifted', 'one', 'film', 'better', 'scenes', 'explaining', 'diplomatic', 'mindset', 'drowned', 'brief', 'spurt', 'post-war', 'optimism', 'Only', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'betrayed', 'civil', 'servant', 'stretching', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'latter', 'roles', 'usually', 'required', 'excellent', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Streep', 'devoted', 'constantly', 'frustrated', 'minor', 'diplomat', 'husband', 'who', 'never', 'personification', 'many', 'problems', 'really', 'shine', 'film', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'often', 'coldly', 'detached', 'direction', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'dinner', 'party', 'hell', 'height', 'Suez', 'Crisis', 'chief', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'void', 'heart', 'way', 'feels', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'too', 'soon', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'played', 'role', 'West', 'End', 'revival', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'brought', 'out', 'nuance', 'struggle', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'convincingly', 'Still', 'least', 'film', 'offer', 'Gielgud', 'telling', 'Burmese', 'diplomat', 'wife', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'NOT', 'bloody', 'Norwegian', 'bloody', 'Swede']",N/A
