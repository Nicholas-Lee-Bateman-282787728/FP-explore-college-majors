The creatures are mammoths, saber-tooth tigers, sloths, bears, wolves and other predatory carnivores.  The people are said to be first the Clovis people, followed much later by the Folsom people. They are named after the hunting tools made by flint knapping, used for spear tips, arrow tips, knives, and scraping.  The Clovis style flint tool was discovered in New Mexico, but primarily has the most occurrence in subsequent archaeological discovery off the New England coastline near Connecticut and Vermont.  The Folsom style flint tool seems to have its prominence in Colorado, such as the Lindenmeier site.  This video tells of the ""adaladal"" which is a spear throwing device that propels the spear much faster by sling-shot effect leverage, to speeds in excess of 60 mph, and creates a great advantage in hunting because of the distance the hunter wants to keep between themselves and the target, and because some creatures were difficult to kill.  The video also explores possible origins and methods of migration from Siberia, France, Spain, and parts of Asia, across oceans, land masses, and explains time period allowances for a lower sea level, in relationship to what effect ice sheets in Canada would have on the Americas.  There are theories shared about what caused the climate changes and dust storms, from changes in river flow, ocean currents, and winds, to the ice sheet being impacted by meteorites.  The documentary has some slow dry spots in the delivery and unfortunately a lot of repetition for the drawings and animations that make it almost amateurish and lets your attention sag.  Of course this type of documentary is based upon speculation and theory more than just about any other subject, so about all the aim of the video has is to stimulate the possibilities in the mind of the viewer.  The one thing it did for me was made me want to visit the George C. Page Museum near the Rancho La Brae Tar Pits at 5801 Wilshire BLVD in Los Angeles, California.  Some scholars say the people of that time period were likely to band together when they met for sharing their knowledge, skills, experiences, food, and their women.  Other scholars say they probably knew the resources were very limited and large groups are slower at migrating than smaller groups, so it is more likely they fought to the death, beginning with the leader of the two clans - which weakened the chances for survival of the clan whose leader died.  Mostly though, I came away feeling like the producer, editor, and director of the documentary knew much more than they were willing to share, and that somehow they felt it was necessary not to tell me the big secrets, or show me the archaeological discoveries first hand.  So I can't give more than 3 stars.",3,"Could have been more academic, more informative; less repetitive, less animated . . .",1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,2871,"['History', 'Channel', 'Journey', '10,000', 'B.C', 'alleged', 'being', 'real', 'story', 'prehistoric', 'man', 'fight', 'survival', 'creatures', 'are', 'mammoths', 'saber-tooth', 'tigers', 'sloths', 'bears', 'wolves', 'other', 'predatory', 'carnivores', 'people', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'first', 'Clovis', 'people', 'followed', 'much', 'later', 'Folsom', 'people', 'are', 'named', 'hunting', 'tools', 'made', 'flint', 'knapping', 'used', 'spear', 'tips', 'arrow', 'tips', 'knives', 'scraping', 'Clovis', 'style', 'flint', 'tool', 'was', 'discovered', 'New', 'Mexico', 'primarily', 'most', 'occurrence', 'subsequent', 'archaeological', 'discovery', 'New', 'England', 'coastline', 'Connecticut', 'Vermont', 'Folsom', 'style', 'flint', 'tool', 'have', 'prominence', 'Colorado', 'such', 'Lindenmeier', 'site', 'video', 'adaladal', 'spear', 'throwing', 'device', 'spear', 'much', 'faster', 'sling-shot', 'effect', 'leverage', 'speeds', 'excess', '60', 'mph', 'great', 'advantage', 'hunting', 'distance', 'hunter', 'keep', 'target', 'creatures', 'were', 'difficult', 'kill', 'video', 'also', 'possible', 'origins', 'methods', 'migration', 'Siberia', 'France', 'Spain', 'parts', 'Asia', 'oceans', 'land', 'masses', 'time', 'period', 'allowances', 'lower', 'sea', 'level', 'relationship', 'what', 'effect', 'ice', 'sheets', 'Canada', 'would', 'have', 'Americas', 'are', 'theories', 'shared', 'what', 'caused', 'climate', 'changes', 'dust', 'storms', 'changes', 'river', 'flow', 'ocean', 'currents', 'winds', 'ice', 'sheet', 'being', 'impacted', 'meteorites', 'documentary', 'slow', 'dry', 'spots', 'delivery', 'unfortunately', 'lot', 'repetition', 'drawings', 'animations', 'make', 'almost', 'amateurish', 'attention', 'sag', 'course', 'type', 'documentary', 'based', 'speculation', 'theory', 'more', 'just', 'other', 'subject', 'aim', 'video', 'stimulate', 'possibilities', 'mind', 'viewer', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'made', 'want', 'visit', 'George', 'C.', 'Page', 'Museum', 'Rancho', 'La', 'Brae', 'Tar', 'Pits', '5801', 'Wilshire', 'BLVD', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'scholars', 'say', 'people', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'likely', 'band', 'together', 'when', 'met', 'sharing', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'experiences', 'food', 'women', 'Other', 'scholars', 'say', 'probably', 'knew', 'resources', 'were', 'very', 'limited', 'large', 'groups', 'are', 'slower', 'migrating', 'smaller', 'groups', 'more', 'likely', 'fought', 'death', 'beginning', 'leader', 'two', 'clans', 'weakened', 'chances', 'survival', 'clan', 'leader', 'died', 'Mostly', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'producer', 'editor', 'director', 'documentary', 'knew', 'much', 'more', 'were', 'willing', 'share', 'somehow', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'not', 'tell', 'big', 'secrets', 'show', 'archaeological', 'discoveries', 'first', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '3', 'stars']","History Channel: Journey to 10,000 BC"

While the information given was interesting the effects, putting people in front of a green screen or blue screen, made it feel like I was watching a cartoon.  This didn't bother me as much as the fact that many scenes were used again and again and that the commercial breaks were not taken out, so things kept repeating. A lot.  Also, the theory that the first Americans could have come from Europe, and were wiped out which is why none of their genes are among the current American Indians, is somewhat hard to support, I think, without more evidence.In the end I think you have to judge for yourself.
