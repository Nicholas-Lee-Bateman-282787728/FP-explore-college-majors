Moreover, if you're like me, you've already seen the third season and are just buying it to watch it again or complete the collection (having owned the first two seasons on BluRay already).  I won't bore you with a synopsis of the season.  I'm sure you know it already.  If you don't, it's easily on par with the first two.  The cameos are a bit more plentiful in the third season as the series had gained some popularity by now.  Also, the 4th season is due to being soon.  Yep...many people thought the 3rd season was the series finale...heck even Danny McBride was done with the series and announced they had no plans or intentions for another season.  Yet...it's coming!So how does this set stack up against the other two season's releases?  Well, its pretty much the same.  The case looks fine next to the other two. The artwork and design of the case looks like it belongs next to the other two.  The transfer and menus are slick.  The extras are standard fare following suit with the previous seasons.  A blooper reel, deleted scenes, A special, ""Dinner with the Schaffers"" short (hilarious), and a bevy of really great commentaries.All in all, for the unbeatable price of a lousy 19.99...you get many hours of top notch, highly underrated comedy from some of the best out there.  The series, and the style of comedy may not be for everyone, but if you like the series and want to own it...like I did and do...then this set is perfect.

1539326,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007WGDC7I,Mark Turner,"[0, 23]","I missed the ball when the series EASTBOUND & DOWN began a few years ago. I heard good things about it and wondered if it lived up to the hype. Having just watched most of season 3 I can honestly say no, it comes nowhere near the hype. This show is just plain terrible.The story is based around Kenny Powers, a baseball star who got kicked out of the big leagues when his fastball began to fade and due to his obnoxious personality. From what I've read the first season had him return to his hometown to teach gym. Apparently between then and now he's received a second chance and is now pitching in some minor league. The episodes I made it through didn't really touch much on this, only enough so you were aware.True to form Kenny is still an obnoxious character. He seems to spend more time getting high and trying to hit on women far too young for him and definitely out of his league. For the most part they seemed more turned off by him than interested. The bragging about what a great star he is comes more from Kenny than from anyone else.Here we have a central character that there is no way anyone could like or even care about. Kenny is a narcissist with a capital N. In his mind there is no one more important than Kenny, even his child. He is the most unlovable character I've seen in some time.To make this series even worse is the performance by star Danny McBride. McBride has fallen into the same trap that so many before him have, most notable Jack Black. He apparently has a staff that tells him no matter what he does he's funny even when he's far from it. I've seen several things with McBride in the past few years and as an actor he isn't. He portrays every role the same way with the same characteristics and same problems. When it seems there aren't enough laughs he resorts to vulgar language. I have little doubt in my mind some half wasted college kid finds this hilarious. Until proven wrong the only thing McBride can do for me is give me a clue which movies/shows to avoid since he is in them.I found nothing in this series that would make me want to come back and watch it each week. I honestly found myself stopping halfway through this season knowing that there was no way it would get any better than what I'd already witness and that was terrible. All it made me do was wonder how something like this could get made when so many great series were canceled or never even made it on the air. Would the show have been funnier or more enjoyable had I seen the first two seasons? Perhaps. Then again maybe if I decided to start smoking weed I'd find this series funny or even tolerable. I think I'd rather save the brain cells and just pass it by.But one thing is certain. I'm sure that there are some out there who think McBride is a genius. I'm sure that there are some out there who think that this series is the funniest thing on the face of the Earth. And with that in mind I know that someone will take me to task for talking about how bad this show is, for revealing that the king isn't wearing any clothes. I'm sorry if you're a fan of this show and of this actor. My only hope is that one day you'll experience something that actually IS funny.",1,TERRIBLE TV,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3184,"['missed', 'ball', 'when', 'series', 'EASTBOUND', 'DOWN', 'began', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'wondered', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'most', 'season', '3', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'no', 'nowhere', 'hype', 'show', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible.The', 'story', 'based', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'baseball', 'star', 'who', 'got', 'kicked', 'big', 'leagues', 'when', 'fastball', 'began', 'fade', 'due', 'obnoxious', 'personality', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'return', 'hometown', 'teach', 'gym', 'Apparently', 'then', 'now', 'received', 'second', 'chance', 'now', 'pitching', 'minor', 'league', 'episodes', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'touch', 'much', 'only', 'enough', 'were', 'aware.True', 'form', 'Kenny', 'still', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'getting', 'high', 'trying', 'hit', 'women', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'definitely', 'league', 'most', 'part', 'seemed', 'more', 'turned', 'off', 'interested', 'bragging', 'what', 'great', 'star', 'more', 'Kenny', 'anyone', 'else.Here', 'have', 'central', 'character', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'like', 'even', 'care', 'Kenny', 'narcissist', 'capital', 'N.', 'mind', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'Kenny', 'even', 'child', 'most', 'unlovable', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time.To', 'make', 'series', 'even', 'worse', 'performance', 'star', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'McBride', 'fallen', 'same', 'trap', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'most', 'notable', 'Jack', 'Black', 'apparently', 'staff', 'matter', 'what', 'funny', 'even', 'when', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'things', 'McBride', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'actor', ""n't"", 'role', 'same', 'way', 'same', 'characteristics', 'same', 'problems', 'When', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'vulgar', 'language', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'mind', 'half', 'wasted', 'college', 'kid', 'hilarious', 'proven', 'wrong', 'only', 'thing', 'McBride', 'can', 'do', 'give', 'clue', 'avoid', 'them.I', 'found', 'nothing', 'series', 'would', 'make', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'week', 'honestly', 'found', 'stopping', 'halfway', 'season', 'knowing', 'was', 'way', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'already', 'witness', 'was', 'terrible', 'made', 'do', 'was', 'wonder', 'how', 'something', 'could', 'get', 'made', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'series', 'were', 'canceled', 'never', 'even', 'made', 'air', 'Would', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'decided', 'start', 'smoking', 'weed', ""'d"", 'find', 'series', 'funny', 'even', 'tolerable', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'save', 'brain', 'cells', 'just', 'pass', 'by.But', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'McBride', 'genius', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'series', 'funniest', 'thing', 'face', 'Earth', 'mind', 'know', 'someone', 'will', 'take', 'task', 'talking', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'revealing', 'king', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'clothes', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'actor', 'only', 'hope', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'experience', 'something', 'actually', 'funny']",Eastbound & Down: Season 3

Not giving away too much of the plot but season 3 sees Kenny Powers juggling his pitching career and the challenges of fatherhood.  Seeing Kenny trying to raise his baby after April left would be worth watching the entire season but Kenny is also facing professional challenges as he is no longer the Alpha on the team and he will do anything to get that position back.  If you liked the first two seasons season three is more of the same.  Some reviewers claim there is a dropoff from season two to season 3 but I disagree I feel season 3 is as solid as the other two seasons if not bettet.,5,Kenny Powers Never Gets Old,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,694,"['watched', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'about', 'Not', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'season', '3', 'sees', 'Kenny', 'Powers', 'juggling', 'pitching', 'career', 'challenges', 'fatherhood', 'Seeing', 'Kenny', 'trying', 'raise', 'baby', 'April', 'left', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'entire', 'season', 'Kenny', 'also', 'facing', 'professional', 'challenges', 'no', 'longer', 'Alpha', 'team', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'position', 'back', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'same', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'dropoff', 'season', 'two', 'season', '3', 'disagree', 'feel', 'season', '3', 'as', 'solid', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'not', 'bettet']",Eastbound & Down: Season 3
