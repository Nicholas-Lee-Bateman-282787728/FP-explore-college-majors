You would think after all of these years that acting would have evolved but I'd take the original series any day!  Show a kid the original and he or she would probably like it better too.,2,Yawn.

I only rented both movies mainly for &#34;The Little Rascals Save the Day&#34; and the only way I could rented it on demand through my cable TV was to rent the double feature which contained both LR movies and I did not want to rent it with Amazon video on demand and watch it on my computer moniter.

1693114,A2DRPL4GAZ0PAI,B00I03D8ZS,Rick,"[2, 2]","I was looking forward to this movie.  I'm a fan of the original Our Gang comedies, as well as the 1994 movie directed by Penelope Spheeris who got the casting of the kids about as right as you could want & managed to coax very good performances out of the kids, closely mimicking the personalities of their counterparts from the original shorts.  I'm sure kids will love this new movie just fine.  Mine did, but for me it was a disappointment.  The director was clearly more focused on getting the best performances out of the kids, less concerned about story & editing & I couldn't help but feel embarrased for the adults in this film.  This movie is 100% made for kids and makes no bones about it so I cant' really be too critical.  I was hoping this movie would be as good or better than previous one.  Look for a cameo by actor Bug Hall who played Alfalfa in the '94 movie - he plays the ice cream delivery guy in this one.",3,The Little Rascals Save the Day,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,927,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', ""'m"", 'fan', 'original', 'Gang', 'comedies', 'as', 'well', '1994', 'movie', 'directed', 'Penelope', 'Spheeris', 'who', 'got', 'casting', 'kids', 'as', 'right', 'could', 'want', 'managed', 'coax', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'kids', 'closely', 'mimicking', 'personalities', 'counterparts', 'original', 'shorts', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'new', 'movie', 'just', 'fine', 'Mine', 'did', 'was', 'disappointment', 'director', 'was', 'clearly', 'more', 'focused', 'getting', 'best', 'performances', 'kids', 'less', 'concerned', 'story', 'editing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'embarrased', 'adults', 'film', 'movie', '100', '%', 'made', 'kids', 'bones', 'so', 'cant', 'really', 'be', 'too', 'critical', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'previous', 'one', 'Look', 'cameo', 'actor', 'Bug', 'Hall', 'who', 'played', 'Alfalfa', ""'94"", 'movie', 'ice', 'cream', 'delivery', 'guy', 'one']",N/A

This is not the Little Rascals you grew up with, sort of.Viewing this movie with the fondness of the past will cause pain; the anachronisms are too much to handle. In the same scene an ice cream man delivers a treat to school, a kid dances to music from his iPod. In another scene, we see an old time theatre, soda jerk shop, and bakery, but then a hummer pulls up. I get they wanted to show the new and the old, but it wasn't the same ol' Rascals.The other issue I had was the over-acting. Aside from the venerable Doris Roberts, most of the adult actors did not correspond well with the children actors. It just seemed &#8220;off&#8221;.That said, my kids enjoyed this movie. Adults falling, cakes blowing up, pets being turned different colors, cars rolling down hills: everything kids love to laugh at. In the end, isn&#8217;t that what counts?I&#8217;m giving this four stars, not because of my own enjoyment, but because I believe every kid (whom this movie is meant for) will have a great time watching it.",4,"Clean, slapstick fun.

I didn't like the last Little Rascals movie, and as bad as that one was as compared to the original, this one is worse than that one.The characters were reproduced horribly down to Alfalfa's fake cow lick. It is as if they attempted to parody the original. This film combines several of the original episodes into one as the gang tries to raise money to save grandma's bakery. I couldn't help but cringe at the climax as &#34;The International Silver String Submarine Band&#34; performed Sonny and Cher as opposed to the wonderful original where all the gang members sang &#34;The Man on the Flying Trapeze.&#34; If this was a play, Spanky would have been booed off stage.If they couldn't make a film better than this, they should not have even tried.
