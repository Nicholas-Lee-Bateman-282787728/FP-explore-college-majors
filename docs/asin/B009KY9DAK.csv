1597587,A1S2YV6GT2RVT2,B009KY9DAK,Jim Brown,"[1, 2]","I've always loved Woody -- as a singer, a horn player, and as leader of one of the great bands of all time. I was lucky enough to hear his bands several dozen times during the 60s, 70s, and 80s, and as a live sound professional, recorded and/or provided the sound system for a half dozen or so performances. One of the things I've always appreciated about Woody is that he was first a great entertainer, and it contributed to him being a great leader. He was also a fine human being and a fine musician. The great strength of this DVD is that it captures those qualities, both with historical audio and video, and with interviews with many who knew him.Weaknesses of this DVD are the total lack of any captions or other identification of the soloists and section players seen on screen, and the less than stellar musical and sonic quality of the live video that was the anchor of the production (although it was a lot better than the really weak stuff on the same producer's earlier Kenton DVD).Those wanting to learn more about Woody and his music should look for &#34;Leader of the Band,&#34; Gene Lees' excellent biography. To appreciate his music, the two Mosaic sets document his great bands of the 40s and 50s, the Atlantic Monterey Jazz Festival recording (c.a. 1959) is wonderful, and there are many fine CDs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.",4,Nice Documentary,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1344,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Woody', 'singer', 'horn', 'player', 'leader', 'one', 'great', 'bands', 'time', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'hear', 'bands', 'several', 'dozen', 'times', '60s', '70s', '80s', 'live', 'sound', 'professional', 'recorded', 'and/or', 'provided', 'sound', 'system', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'performances', 'One', 'things', ""'ve"", 'always', 'appreciated', 'Woody', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'entertainer', 'contributed', 'being', 'great', 'leader', 'was', 'also', 'fine', 'human', 'being', 'fine', 'musician', 'great', 'strength', 'DVD', 'qualities', 'historical', 'audio', 'video', 'interviews', 'many', 'who', 'knew', 'him.Weaknesses', 'DVD', 'are', 'total', 'lack', 'captions', 'other', 'identification', 'soloists', 'section', 'players', 'seen', 'screen', 'less', 'stellar', 'musical', 'sonic', 'quality', 'live', 'video', 'was', 'anchor', 'production', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'really', 'weak', 'stuff', 'same', 'producer', 'earlier', 'Kenton', 'DVD', '.Those', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'Woody', 'music', 'should', 'look', '34', 'Leader', 'Band', '34', 'Gene', 'Lees', 'excellent', 'biography', 'appreciate', 'music', 'two', 'Mosaic', 'sets', 'document', 'great', 'bands', '40s', '50s', 'Atlantic', 'Monterey', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'recording', 'c.a', '1959', 'wonderful', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'CDs', '60s', '70s', '80s']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[12, 12]","This is the second of the in-depth music biographies that I've watched by Graham Carter (the other was ""Stan Kenton: Artistry in Rhythm"") and I have to give Carter credit for being a ""one-man band"" (NO pun intended, really). He not only conducted all the interviews - and with nearly 1,000 musicians who played in one of Woody Herman's bands over 50-plus years, Carter seems to have found nearly 35 or more - and wrote the script, but he narrates it too!. And you get a lot of entertainment value on this DVD as well. With a running time of nearly two hours and a lot of complete performances (both from European TV and from a PBS station in Iowa) that are , thoughtfully, ""indexed"", so that you can go directly to specific performances on repeat viewings, it's a must have for big band or Herman fans. Note that it is authorized by both the Herman Estate and the Woody Herman Appreciation Society.But I need to warn you that this is not a ""slick"" production. While the post-1960 performances - usually from videotape - have good video, the clips  (most of the early performances - taken from feature films - are just excerpts) from the 1930s-1950s show a lot of wear and the images are fuzzy. There are certainly better copies out there but the licensing fees may have made using these cost-prohibitive. If you are used to seeing early jazz documentaries with clean prints, I'm afraid you won't find those here.  I issue the warning but am still giving the DVD five stars because no one else has attempted to pay such a loving tribute to the ""Head of the Herd"" before and, even though Herman's career started in 1936, we are up to the 1940s in the story - and clips - in the first 11 minutes. I probably should have dropped 1/2 a star for the video quality of those early clips, but Amazon doesn't allow 1/2 stars.Carter has also produced documentaries on on Phil Woods and Bud Shank, but I haven't seen those (yet). I'm not sure what his current project is but I for one, will certainly be looking forward to it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Lovingly made documentary with lots of performance footage - though early ones are only excerpts.,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2105,"['second', 'in-depth', 'music', 'biographies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Graham', 'Carter', 'other', 'was', 'Stan', 'Kenton', 'Artistry', 'Rhythm', 'have', 'give', 'Carter', 'credit', 'being', 'one-man', 'band', 'NO', 'pun', 'intended', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'conducted', 'interviews', 'nearly', '1,000', 'musicians', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'Woody', 'Herman', 'bands', '50-plus', 'years', 'Carter', 'have', 'found', 'nearly', '35', 'more', 'wrote', 'script', 'too', 'get', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'value', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'lot', 'complete', 'performances', 'European', 'TV', 'PBS', 'station', 'Iowa', 'are', 'thoughtfully', 'indexed', 'can', 'go', 'directly', 'specific', 'performances', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'must', 'have', 'big', 'band', 'Herman', 'fans', 'Note', 'authorized', 'Herman', 'Estate', 'Woody', 'Herman', 'Appreciation', 'Society.But', 'need', 'warn', 'not', 'slick', 'production', 'post-1960', 'performances', 'usually', 'videotape', 'have', 'good', 'video', 'clips', 'most', 'early', 'performances', 'taken', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'excerpts', '1930s-1950s', 'show', 'lot', 'wear', 'images', 'are', 'fuzzy', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'out', 'there', 'licensing', 'fees', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'using', 'cost-prohibitive', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'early', 'jazz', 'documentaries', 'clean', 'prints', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'issue', 'warning', 'am', 'still', 'giving', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'else', 'attempted', 'pay', 'loving', 'tribute', 'Head', 'Herd', 'even', 'Herman', 'career', 'started', '1936', 'are', 'up', '1940s', 'story', 'clips', 'first', '11', 'minutes', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'dropped', '1/2', 'star', 'video', 'quality', 'early', 'clips', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'allow', '1/2', 'stars.Carter', 'also', 'produced', 'documentaries', 'Phil', 'Woods', 'Bud', 'Shank', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'current', 'project', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
