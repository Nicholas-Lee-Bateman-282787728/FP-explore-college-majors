This is an excellent HBO production, and it plays more like a big-screen release than a made-for-TV production (as HBO is known to do).The centerpiece of this film is the work of Alice Paul (Hillary Swank) and Lucy Burns.  These sufferagettes met in England and brought their passion home to the United States in 1912.  They attracted a group of young, dedicated, educated women that went to work in Washington, D.C.,to lobby for the vote.  This is the same year Woodrow Wilson took office.  Their decision to picket the White House, even during the early days of WWI brought down the ire of many people upon them, and even resulted in their unlawful arrests and imprisonment.  Alice Paul was the heart and soul of this effort and, though she was a relative latecomer to the fight, provided the spark that inspired women to take up the challenge.  The treatment of the sufferagettes in prison was eye-opening.The cast is amazing, and there is not a weak performance among them.  You will see many familiar faces among the cast.The film is of high quality and deserves to be seen.  There are a few disjointed scenes here and there, like Swank in the bathtub, but all in all, it is an excellent period piece dramatizing actual events.Watching a film like this makes me ashamed about the times I have taken for granted the right to vote, and inspired me to be a better-informed voter and citizen.5 stars, without a doubt.",5,Top-notch effort at depicting the fight leading to the women's right to vote in the USA,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,1507,"['Iron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'final', 'stages', 'battle', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'excellent', 'HBO', 'production', 'more', 'big-screen', 'release', 'made-for-TV', 'production', 'HBO', 'known', 'do', '.The', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'work', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Lucy', 'Burns', 'sufferagettes', 'met', 'England', 'brought', 'passion', 'home', 'United', 'States', '1912', 'attracted', 'group', 'young', 'dedicated', 'educated', 'women', 'went', 'work', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'lobby', 'vote', 'same', 'year', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'took', 'office', 'decision', 'picket', 'White', 'House', 'even', 'early', 'days', 'WWI', 'brought', 'down', 'ire', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'resulted', 'unlawful', 'arrests', 'imprisonment', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'effort', 'was', 'relative', 'latecomer', 'fight', 'provided', 'spark', 'inspired', 'women', 'take', 'up', 'challenge', 'treatment', 'sufferagettes', 'prison', 'was', 'eye-opening.The', 'cast', 'amazing', 'not', 'weak', 'performance', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'familiar', 'cast.The', 'film', 'high', 'quality', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'few', 'disjointed', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'Swank', 'bathtub', 'excellent', 'period', 'dramatizing', 'actual', 'events.Watching', 'film', 'ashamed', 'times', 'have', 'taken', 'granted', 'right', 'vote', 'inspired', 'be', 'better-informed', 'voter', 'citizen.5', 'stars', 'doubt']",Iron Jawed Angels

Even the greatest names among our foremothers are virtually unknown. Pearl S. Buck, one of the most popular novelists of the mid-twentieth century and the first woman to win both the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes for literature, wrote: ""In curiosity a few months ago I asked a haphazard score of women of my acquaintance if they had heard of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Only one had even heard her name, and she had no recollection of more. Yet only a generation ago Elizabeth Cady Stanton was called the greatest woman in the United States, and by some the greatest in the world.... [I]f the aim of education is to be enlightening of men and women about each other, of course history must be taught truthfully about both, and truthfully rewritten.""This movie depicts the life of Alice Paul and her fellow suffragists during the last years of suffrage, including the violence used against them, the arrests and imprisonment, the infested food they were given to eat, the hunger strikes, the force-feedings, and their strength and courage in the face of hideous abuse. Most people have no idea how they suffered for our right to vote. (Even fewer know they opposed abortion, which Alice Paul called ""the ultimate exploitation of women."")  It is my hope that ""Iron Jawed Angels,"" though imperfect, will renew interest in the women's suffrage movement and its great heroes like Alice Paul and Inez Milholland Boissevain, ""Who Died for the Freedom of Women"" (as the classic memorial poster says).""Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B.

The young feminists of the 1910s shocked their elders with their protests (see Code Pink), their smoking (see Sex in the City), their sexual liberty (see sex positive feminism) and their will to power.What's amazing about this film is that so little of it ever crosses a school-child's desk.

825265,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00026L9CU,Deborah Earle,"[4, 5]","In a role that was tailor-made for her, a tomboyish and intelligent-looking Hilary Swank leads a stellar cast in Katja von Garnier's look at the second-generation suffragettes who saw the push for the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote, end victoriously.Occasionally, I found the modern score of this tale of the early 20th century to be rather off-putting, but have come to appreciate its usefullness in attracting a modern audience.I have been provided with a lesson about the suffragettes who lived to celebrate the passage of the 19th Amendment that was hitherto unknown to me, although I was familiar with the story of the attacks on the suffragettes during the 1913 parade in Washington.As Lucy Burns, the exotically beautiful Frances O'Connor, with her sharp, dark eyes, olive skin, red hair, and a strict Irish Catholic upbringing similar to  that of the character she plays, is every bit Swank's equal.The group of suffragettes really come to life in this  production, becoming more than the staid women in historical black and white photos. As is exemplified when Alice commandeers Lucy's new lavender hat, and by their kidding around at a photo session during a rally, they are far from humorless, and in fact,are prankish and spirited, although serious about their cause.Anjelica Huston's performance as Carrie Chapman Catt was worthy of the Golden Globe she received for it. She is primly assertive as she challenges the policies of the young suffragettes, and is either confrontational or supportive of Bob Gunton's President Wilson depending on the issue.Ultimately, she comes to respect the young suffragettes for their bravery in their endurance of abuse and a hunger strike during their unjust incarceration.Julia Ormond is tragically brave and bravely tragic as Inez Milholland, whose sacrifice brings bittersweetness to the eventual outcome.Molly Parker's Emily Leighton, the wife of Senator Tom Leighton (Joseph Adams), is as demure and docile as a live Victorian porcelain doll in the beginning, but as she is recruited to the cause, impresses her husband and the world when she shows the stuff she is truly made of.Vera Farmiga's  full-lipped Slavic beauty and strength are well used in her role as the immigrant factory worker Ruza Wenclawska.Brooke Smith's Mabel Vernon keeps the suffragettes and the NAWSA (National American Women's Suffrage Association) budget on an even keel.Adalah Barnes gives spark to the courage of Ida Wells Barnett, who joins the marchers over the objections of Southern delegates who did not want an integrated rally, and Carrie Snodgress, in her last role, typifies the down-home strength of a farm woman as she consoles her daughter, Alice after the death of one of the leading suffragettes, encouraging her to renew the fight despite the setback.Patrick Dempsey's newspaper columnist, Ben Weissman, is a widowered father and potential love interest for Alice.Both Alice and Lucy play off well against each other as they discuss their campaign strategy. While she inevitably has her down moments,Alice always knows what to say to win recruits to the cause and to keep those involved in it committed. The definitive moment in the struggle is probably Alice's confrontation with the prison psychiatrist, who expresses his admiration of her gallantry in his report to President Wilson.On August 18, 1920, a young and unassuming Senator Burns( Peter Berinato) reads a telegram from his mother, Phoebe, and decides to change the course of American history in the Tennessee State House. Alice and Lucy await the final word at Suffragette Headquarters with a poignant tribute to a fallen  suffragette posted in one corner of the office.The celebration of their triumph is a sight to behold; the symbolic yellow stars of pro-suffrage fluttering from the balcony, and two best friends tossing their stylishly bobbed heads thither and yon in acknowledgement of the tribute.While there are a few inaccuarcies, Katja von Garnier's production is a beautiful tribute to Alice Paul in time for the 120th anniversary of her birth, as a timely one that could help decrease apathy among the American voters of today.",5,"The Lady in the Lavender Hat, and Her Companions",1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,4191,"['role', 'was', 'tailor-made', 'tomboyish', 'intelligent-looking', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'look', 'second-generation', 'suffragettes', 'who', 'saw', 'push', '19th', 'Amendment', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'granting', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'end', 'victoriously.Occasionally', 'found', 'modern', 'score', 'tale', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'be', 'rather', 'off-putting', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'usefullness', 'attracting', 'modern', 'audience.I', 'have', 'been', 'provided', 'lesson', 'suffragettes', 'who', 'lived', 'celebrate', 'passage', '19th', 'Amendment', 'was', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'was', 'familiar', 'story', 'attacks', 'suffragettes', '1913', 'parade', 'Washington.As', 'Lucy', 'Burns', 'exotically', 'beautiful', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'sharp', 'dark', 'eyes', 'olive', 'skin', 'red', 'hair', 'strict', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'upbringing', 'similar', 'character', 'bit', 'Swank', 'equal.The', 'group', 'suffragettes', 'really', 'come', 'life', 'production', 'becoming', 'more', 'staid', 'women', 'historical', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'exemplified', 'when', 'Alice', 'Lucy', 'new', 'lavender', 'hat', 'kidding', 'around', 'photo', 'session', 'rally', 'are', 'far', 'humorless', 'fact', 'are', 'prankish', 'spirited', 'serious', 'cause.Anjelica', 'Huston', 'performance', 'Carrie', 'Chapman', 'Catt', 'was', 'worthy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'received', 'primly', 'assertive', 'policies', 'young', 'suffragettes', 'confrontational', 'supportive', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'President', 'Wilson', 'depending', 'issue.Ultimately', 'respect', 'young', 'suffragettes', 'bravery', 'endurance', 'abuse', 'hunger', 'strike', 'unjust', 'incarceration.Julia', 'Ormond', 'tragically', 'brave', 'bravely', 'tragic', 'Inez', 'Milholland', 'sacrifice', 'brings', 'bittersweetness', 'eventual', 'outcome.Molly', 'Parker', 'Emily', 'Leighton', 'wife', 'Senator', 'Tom', 'Leighton', 'Joseph', 'Adams', 'demure', 'docile', 'live', 'Victorian', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'beginning', 'recruited', 'cause', 'husband', 'world', 'when', 'stuff', 'truly', 'made', 'of.Vera', 'Farmiga', 'full-lipped', 'Slavic', 'beauty', 'strength', 'are', 'well', 'used', 'role', 'immigrant', 'factory', 'worker', 'Ruza', 'Wenclawska.Brooke', 'Smith', 'Mabel', 'Vernon', 'suffragettes', 'NAWSA', 'National', 'American', 'Women', 'Suffrage', 'Association', 'budget', 'even', 'keel.Adalah', 'Barnes', 'spark', 'courage', 'Ida', 'Wells', 'Barnett', 'who', 'marchers', 'objections', 'Southern', 'delegates', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'integrated', 'rally', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'last', 'role', 'down-home', 'strength', 'farm', 'woman', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'death', 'one', 'leading', 'suffragettes', 'encouraging', 'renew', 'fight', 'setback.Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'Ben', 'Weissman', 'widowered', 'father', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Alice.Both', 'Alice', 'Lucy', 'play', 'off', 'well', 'other', 'discuss', 'campaign', 'strategy', 'inevitably', 'down', 'moments', 'Alice', 'always', 'what', 'say', 'win', 'recruits', 'cause', 'keep', 'involved', 'committed', 'definitive', 'moment', 'struggle', 'probably', 'Alice', 'confrontation', 'prison', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'admiration', 'gallantry', 'report', 'President', 'Wilson.On', 'August', '18', '1920', 'young', 'unassuming', 'Senator', 'Burns', 'Peter', 'Berinato', 'telegram', 'mother', 'Phoebe', 'decides', 'change', 'course', 'American', 'history', 'Tennessee', 'State', 'House', 'Alice', 'Lucy', 'await', 'final', 'word', 'Suffragette', 'Headquarters', 'poignant', 'tribute', 'fallen', 'suffragette', 'posted', 'one', 'corner', 'office.The', 'celebration', 'triumph', 'sight', 'behold', 'symbolic', 'yellow', 'stars', 'pro-suffrage', 'fluttering', 'balcony', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'tossing', 'stylishly', 'bobbed', 'heads', 'thither', 'yon', 'acknowledgement', 'tribute.While', 'are', 'few', 'inaccuarcies', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'production', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'time', '120th', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'timely', 'one', 'could', 'help', 'decrease', 'apathy', 'American', 'voters', 'today']",Iron Jawed Angels

The entire cast does a good job here, although Patrick Dempsey's smirking takes away from his supposedly sympathetic character.Only when the movie dispenses with the special effects does the story really come into its own.

Two-time Oscar winner Swank does an excellent job of conveying the abuses suffered in jail.

Pouliot,"[1, 1]","Closing in on 100 years after women gained the right to vote in America, few know what a momentous struggle it was to establish the franchise among the female half of the population. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" tries to erase the misconception that the work of getting the vote was just the work of quaintly-dressed, semi-masculine suffragettes. In actuality, the road was long, frustrating and sometimes violent.The movie focuses on Alice Paul, a young Quaker PhD from Swarthmore, played brilliantly by Hilary Swank. Paul represents the new breed of suffrage worker who, armed with advanced degrees and a passion for activism and justice, make the final push for the franchise. The movie shows us the difficult work of organizing reluctant women to support voting, as well as the political infighting that took place within the movement, Older suffrage supporters, like Carrie Chapman Catt (played by the magnificent Angelica Huston) have been firmly, patiently, yet unsuccessfully asking for the vote for years. Deferential to men in power, they hope to gain the vote by slowly amassing support at the state level. Alice Paul and her young comrades, like Lucy Burns (played by Frances O'Connor) and Reverend Anna Howard Shaw (played by Lois Smith) take a different tack, ""manning"" the phones and organizing public events to bring attention to their demand for the vote. But when World War I begins, there is a dilemma in the movement. Should suffragism go underground again until the hostilities end? Or is this the time to press even harder? When Alice Paul and her cohorts decide to go for it, they set in motion a series of events that leads to violence, imprisonment under trumped up charges and abuse.Though ""Iron Jawed Angels"" is excellent, it has a few problems, notably the awkward title, which is equally descriptive and disparaging of the suffragists' determination. Then, there is the unfortunate (but predictable) love interest for Paul - Ben Weissman, a fictional newspaper cartoonist played by hunky Patrick Dempsey. A particualrly unfortunate bathtub scene (you'll know it when you see it.) in which Hilary muses on an afternoon encounter with Weissman, comes close to devolving into soft porn. Such nonsense is both unnecessary and out of keeping with the film's uplifting tone of female empowerment.""Iron-Jawed Angels"" is smartly written, very well acted and informative about a historical period that mostly wins smirks. Great acting turns by the above named as well as by Vera Farmiga as a Russian immigrant and Molly Parker as the timid wife of a US Senator. The film's best line is delivered at a White House meeting with a reluctant President Woodrow Wilson. When a comparison of suffragist demands to Patrick Henry's ""Give me Liberty of give me Death"" speech is called ""apples and oranges,"" a participant says that ""In oranges and women, courage is often mistaken for insanity."" This film tells the true story about courage and a drive for equality and justice.

Bernabo,"[6, 7]","The meaning of the title for this 2004 HBO movie becomes clear in the final act when sister suffragette Alice Paul (Hilary Swank) is arrested for ""obstructing traffic"" by standing in front of the White House and reading aloud public statements made by President Woodrow Wilson.  Convicted on the trumped up charges and thrown in a workhouse with over 200 over suffragettes, Paul goes on a hunger strike and eventually is force fed against her will.  The picture of Paul, jaw clenched against the coming intrusion, becomes iconic for the film, especially given the idea expressed at different times in different ways in the film that points out that courage in women is mistaken by men as being insanity.""Iron Jawed Angels"" is the story of the radical suffragettes who broke away from the National American Woman Suffrage Association and its president Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston).  By the time Woodrow Wilson (Bob Gunton) entered he White House in 1912 there were a handful of states that had given women the right to vote.  NAWSA wants to continue to go state by state, but Paul, Lucy Burns (Frances O'Connor) and other like-minded younger women want to push for an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to give women the right to vote.  Facing opposition from the old guard and political conservatives, the women also face apathy from Wilson's administration.  Marching for women's suffrage before Wilson's inauguration the women are attacked, and this foreshadows worse things to come, especially once America's entry into World War I is supposed to stop the movement in its tracks and Paul insists on pushing forward.Directed by Katja von Garnier, ""Iron Jawed Angels"" has a script put together by Jennifer Friedes (who came up with the story), Sally Robinson, Eugenia Bostwick Singer & Raymond Singer, and it is not overly simplistic to say that the film shows that the movement for women's rights had a dark side that makes it more akin to the labor and civil rights movements than our history textbooks lead us to believe.  The problematic elements with the movie come in the early parts.  I did not want to be distracted by any spark of romance between Paul and editorial cartoonist Ben Weissman (Patrick Dempsey), because such things become immaterial when Paul is being straight-jacketed and having her jawed ratcheted open.  Early on in the film there are some funky examples of editing and at one point Sarah McLaughlan starts singing ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,"" but such contemporary concerns are stripped away in that final act when the question is whether Paul and her colleagues are going to survive long enough to see the Women's Suffrage Amendment passed.Fortunately, ""Iron Jawed Angels"" saves the best for last and whatever you think of the first couple of acts of the movie the last one will catch your complete attention.  Swank has certainly cornered the market on playing a suffering woman, but her best moment is when she is questioned by a doctor concerning her beliefs and mental state, and she more than holds her own.  Ultimately it is the contrast between the silent actions of these imprisoned women and the babbling hypocrisies coming out of the mouth of the district commissioner and other politicians that eloquently drives home the point of this movie.  Of course, the idea that merely quoting the president could constitute treason is a delicious irony (and one that has certainly existed ever since).But in dramatizing the story of the push for the 19th Amendment there is always a tendency to be overly dramatic and everything gets reduced to the idea that Paul, Burns and the others are suffering so that Catt finally realizes they have given her a big chip to play in this game of power politics.  I guess I want to think that on some level the idea of equality being inherently just came into play, and I know that I really do not want to think that gender equality in this country came down to one state legislator receiving a note from his mother.  The result is not a movie that is short of perfection but which still demands attention for the story it tells, the cause it embraces, and the women it honors.",4,Sister suffragettes lay it on the line for the right to vote,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,4155,"['meaning', 'title', '2004', 'HBO', 'movie', 'clear', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'sister', 'suffragette', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'arrested', 'obstructing', 'traffic', 'standing', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'reading', 'aloud', 'public', 'statements', 'made', 'President', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'Convicted', 'trumped', 'charges', 'thrown', 'workhouse', '200', 'suffragettes', 'Paul', 'hunger', 'strike', 'eventually', 'force', 'fed', 'will', 'picture', 'Paul', 'jaw', 'clenched', 'coming', 'intrusion', 'iconic', 'film', 'especially', 'given', 'idea', 'expressed', 'different', 'times', 'different', 'ways', 'film', 'out', 'courage', 'women', 'mistaken', 'men', 'being', 'insanity', 'Iron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'story', 'radical', 'suffragettes', 'who', 'broke', 'away', 'National', 'American', 'Woman', 'Suffrage', 'Association', 'president', 'Carrie', 'Chapman', 'Catt', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'time', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'entered', 'White', 'House', '1912', 'were', 'handful', 'states', 'had', 'given', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'NAWSA', 'continue', 'go', 'state', 'state', 'Paul', 'Lucy', 'Burns', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'other', 'like-minded', 'younger', 'women', 'want', 'push', 'Amendment', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'give', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'Facing', 'opposition', 'old', 'guard', 'political', 'conservatives', 'women', 'also', 'face', 'apathy', 'Wilson', 'administration', 'Marching', 'women', 'suffrage', 'Wilson', 'inauguration', 'women', 'are', 'attacked', 'worse', 'things', 'come', 'especially', 'once', 'America', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'supposed', 'stop', 'movement', 'tracks', 'Paul', 'pushing', 'forward.Directed', 'Katja', 'von', 'Garnier', 'Iron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'script', 'put', 'together', 'Jennifer', 'Friedes', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'story', 'Sally', 'Robinson', 'Eugenia', 'Bostwick', 'Singer', 'Raymond', 'Singer', 'not', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'say', 'film', 'movement', 'women', 'rights', 'had', 'dark', 'side', 'more', 'akin', 'labor', 'civil', 'rights', 'movements', 'history', 'textbooks', 'lead', 'believe', 'problematic', 'elements', 'movie', 'come', 'early', 'parts', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'distracted', 'spark', 'romance', 'Paul', 'editorial', 'cartoonist', 'Ben', 'Weissman', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'such', 'things', 'become', 'immaterial', 'when', 'Paul', 'being', 'straight-jacketed', 'having', 'jawed', 'ratcheted', 'open', 'Early', 'film', 'are', 'funky', 'examples', 'editing', 'one', 'point', 'Sarah', 'McLaughlan', 'singing', 'Fumbling', 'Towards', 'Ecstasy', 'such', 'contemporary', 'concerns', 'are', 'stripped', 'away', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'question', 'Paul', 'colleagues', 'are', 'going', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'Women', 'Suffrage', 'Amendment', 'passed.Fortunately', 'Iron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'best', 'last', 'think', 'first', 'couple', 'acts', 'movie', 'last', 'one', 'will', 'catch', 'complete', 'attention', 'Swank', 'certainly', 'cornered', 'market', 'playing', 'suffering', 'woman', 'best', 'moment', 'when', 'questioned', 'doctor', 'concerning', 'beliefs', 'mental', 'state', 'more', 'own', 'contrast', 'silent', 'actions', 'imprisoned', 'women', 'babbling', 'hypocrisies', 'coming', 'mouth', 'district', 'commissioner', 'other', 'politicians', 'eloquently', 'home', 'point', 'movie', 'course', 'idea', 'merely', 'quoting', 'president', 'could', 'constitute', 'treason', 'delicious', 'irony', 'one', 'certainly', 'existed', 'ever', '.But', 'dramatizing', 'story', 'push', '19th', 'Amendment', 'always', 'tendency', 'be', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'everything', 'reduced', 'idea', 'Paul', 'Burns', 'others', 'are', 'suffering', 'Catt', 'finally', 'have', 'given', 'big', 'chip', 'play', 'game', 'power', 'politics', 'guess', 'want', 'think', 'level', 'idea', 'equality', 'being', 'inherently', 'just', 'came', 'play', 'know', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'think', 'gender', 'equality', 'country', 'came', 'down', 'one', 'state', 'legislator', 'receiving', 'note', 'mother', 'result', 'not', 'movie', 'short', 'perfection', 'still', 'attention', 'story', 'cause', 'women', 'honors']",Iron Jawed Angels

Spanning the years from 1912 to 1920, it stars Hilary Swank as Alice Paul who led the fight with ultimate courage.  There's some interesting history of which I was unaware.  And the filmmakers seem to get the theme across.  At the time, it was a state-by-state decision as to whether or not women could vote.  But Alice Paul wanted to make it a constitutional amendment.  There is, of course, is in-fighting in the movement itself with the old factions, led by Anjelica Huston, as Carrie Chapman Catt,  preferring to not make a fuss and quietly let each state decide.  Alice Paul, however, confronted the establishment head on and brought down some dour consequences on herself and the group of women who followed her lead.At first I was annoyed at the film. I felt their wardrobes too lavish and the potential romance between Alice and a Washington Post cartoonist was silly.  I also thought the women seemed a bit too modern and politically correct.  And, frankly, I thought of turning off my DVD and never reviewing this film.But then there was a scene in which the police turned their backs on protecting a festive parade in which women and children were demonstrating.  When the mobs attacked the women I felt real tears dripping down my face.  And then, later, when the women were horribly mistreated in prison, I found myself crying again, especially when they force-fed Alice Paul and we see them pushing tubes down her throat and through her nose. By the end of the film I understood exactly what these brave women had gone through in order to give me a privilege that I take for granted.  I also know that I have learned a new appreciation for my right to vote and will never take that right for granted again.While not perfect, I applaud this film.  It brought me a new understanding.

It probably helps to have had some background in the long battle for women's right to vote as this story picks it up in the final stages and takes it to the finish line. Others have said that it may try too hard not to be a period piece and that is probably a fair criticism as the characters may be a little more reflective of today than the early 1900's. Having said that, it has always taken people who have that radical toughness and obsession to break down barriers in society. Isn't it amazing that our Constitution that proclaimed 'all men are created equal....' took so long to make it really viable for half of our population, not to mention the battles for freedom from slavery and the subsequent struggle for voting rights of African-Americans. Our country was founded in revolution and struggle-both ideological and physical and that was the beginning as we have struggled to define 'all men' since then. This is a movie worth watching for the reminder of the hard fought (they literally experienced physical violence and wrongful imprisonment) rights that some in our society have had to battle for while others have been able to take for granted those same freedoms. This is the story of a sad chapter in our history and the women who paved the way for their daughters and granddaughters to have an equal (mostly) seat at the table.

In any movement there are often different opinions over what methods to use to achieve their goals. It's one of the historical ironies that in staid stiff upperlip England, the suffrigist movement used very in-you-face techniques with ladies in lace gloves sticking small bombs in MPs mailboxes, storming parliament and pelting the members with eggs. While in rough-and-tumble America, for decades the suffrigists were very lady-like and tried to do nothing to offend the politicians and public. Was it the efforts of the suffrigists that got the vote or would it have come anyway since at that time legions of women were attending college and entering the workforce as a result of the WWI labor shortages? This is an excellent film to study the dynamics of social change.The only fault I found was the obvious pandering to the youth audiance by throwing in a superfluous love story and a bathtub self-pleasuring scene that cluttered the story. (Also the music belonged more to an Ophra movie than the early 20th century.)

Iron Jawed Angels portrays the struggles and sacrifices made by the Suffragists Alice Paul (portrayed by Hilary Swank) and Lucy Burns (portrayed by Frances O'Connor). Along with their diverse team of recruits--from a senator's wife to an immigrant factory worker--they surpassed the efforts of their ""older sisters"" and succeeded in changing the old guard political machinery of the United States, winning the right for women to vote.Call them Suffragists, call them Feminists, women who've fought for rights in our nation's history have often been portrayed as masculine, ball-busting bra-burners. This film does a beautiful job at depicting the beauty and intelligence of these modern, college-educated women, and isn't afraid to show them admiring fashion or worrying about how their hair looks. At the same time, it pays homage to the original Suffragists, including Carrie Chapman Catt (portrayed by Angelica Houston) who succeeded Susan B. Anthony as head of the National Woman Suffrage Association. The upbeat musical score pumps additional energy into the telling of these tireless women, willing to give everything for their cause. We, their descendents, owe them a debt of gratitude.Hillary Clinton may be breaking the so-called glass ceiling in today's American politics; however, she has it EASY compared to Alice Paul and Lucy Burns and what it took to pass the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club",5,Watch This With Your Daughters,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1722,"['story', 'especially', 'poignant', 'now', 'America', 'midst', 'presidential', 'election', 'where', 'woman', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'vying', 'Democratic', 'nomination', 'candidates', 'are', 'sloganeering', 'concept', 'change', 'Iron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'struggles', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'Suffragists', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'portrayed', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Lucy', 'Burns', 'portrayed', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'diverse', 'team', 'recruits', 'senator', 'wife', 'immigrant', 'factory', 'worker', 'surpassed', 'efforts', 'older', 'sisters', 'succeeded', 'changing', 'old', 'guard', 'political', 'machinery', 'United', 'States', 'winning', 'right', 'women', 'vote.Call', 'Suffragists', 'call', 'Feminists', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'fought', 'rights', 'nation', 'history', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'portrayed', 'masculine', 'ball-busting', 'bra-burners', 'film', 'beautiful', 'job', 'depicting', 'beauty', 'intelligence', 'modern', 'college-educated', 'women', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'admiring', 'fashion', 'worrying', 'how', 'hair', 'same', 'time', 'homage', 'original', 'Suffragists', 'including', 'Carrie', 'Chapman', 'Catt', 'portrayed', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'who', 'succeeded', 'Susan', 'B.', 'Anthony', 'head', 'National', 'Woman', 'Suffrage', 'Association', 'upbeat', 'musical', 'score', 'pumps', 'additional', 'energy', 'telling', 'tireless', 'women', 'willing', 'give', 'everything', 'cause', 'descendents', 'owe', 'debt', 'gratitude.Hillary', 'Clinton', 'may', 'be', 'breaking', 'so-called', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'today', 'American', 'politics', 'however', 'EASY', 'compared', 'Alice', 'Paul', 'Lucy', 'Burns', 'what', 'took', 'pass', '19th', 'Amendment', 'giving', 'women', 'right', 'vote.Michele', 'Cozzens', 'author', 'Not', 'Mother', 'Bridge', 'Club']",Iron Jawed Angels

It focuses on the work of young suffragettes Alice Paul (Hilary Swank) and Lucy Burns (Frances O'Conner) from their arrival in Washington, D.C. in 1912 until just before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1920. Paul and Burns represented the younger generation of suffragettes who were less willing to bide their time playing politics until the nation's politicians came around to their way of thinking. They were brash, bold, brave and so self-righteous that they must have thought themselves invincible. But the time for extreme tactics had come, and even picketing President Woodrow Wilson during the US's involvement in World War I ultimately produced good results, though at a high price. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" follows Paul and Burns' fight for the vote through their atttention-stealing Inauguration Day parade in 1912, attempts to lobby Congress, their split with the National Women's Suffrage Association, formation of the National Women's Party, their 1916 cross-country trip to rally voters against any Democratic candidate who opposed a constitutional amendment giving women the vote, and their imprisonment for picketing a wartime president and subsequent hunger strike. There is constant strife between Alice Paul and the older generation of suffragettes, who are experienced in the ways of government and politically savvy, but disdain the obnoxious tactics that the younger generation embrace. Most notable of the older generation of suffragettes is Carrie Chapman Catt, played to perfection by Angelica Huston, who is imposing and clever, if old-fashioned.Director Katja von Garnier has brought this story to life with a stellar cast and contemporary style. The film and sound editing are bold. The soundtrack is modern and upbeat. I questioned that decision when I first heard contemporary pop sounds pumping as Alice Paul crossed a street in 1912. But the style grew on me, and I came to appreciate the director's unconventional but oddly effective choices in scoring the film. The cast is great. Hilary Swank hits just the right note as Alice Paul -over and over again. I have never liked Frances O'Conner in anything, but she's perfect as Lucy Burns. It's a joy to hear Anjelica Huston speak as Carrie Chapman Catt, even if she is a stuffy character. Molly Parker gives perhaps the most emotionally affecting performance as Emily Leighton, wife of Senator Thomas Leighton, who supported the suffrage cause against her husband's wishes. Hers is an Oscar-calibre performance. Julia Ormond and Bob Gunton are also notable as suffragette Inez Mulholland and Pres. Woodrow Wilson, respectively. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" creatively and passionately presents the victory for women's suffrage and the story of those who fought and won it.The DVD: There is an audio commentary by director Katja von Garnier and screenwriter Sally Robinson. The commentary is very casual and discusses filming and sound editing decisions and recounts a few anecdotes. It's honestly not very informative or interesting. No need to feel you missed anything if you skip it. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.

825296,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00026L9CU,Nicholas Carroll,"[8, 8]","I rented this film mostly because I'm a huge fan of Frances O'Connor and want to see everything she's in.  She's my favorite actress, and I never fail to be impressed by her grace, humour and heart.  She always charms, and this role is no exception.  Hilary Swank was a pleasant surprise, as I've never seen any of her films, yet she shines in this one as Alice Paul--a pioneer in women's rights, forsaking love for a cause.  In one of the most profound lines I ever heard, she tells Lucy that as an individual, she has the right to make any choice she wants, but love would obligate her in a way that she would no longer have that choice because she'd be committed to what's best for the relationship.This film surprised me by its very impressive cast...including Angelica Huston in some cool looking hats, Julia Ormond as the lady on the horse in their first march on Capitol Hill, and Patrick Dempsey as the Washington Post Reporter who falls for Alice Paul.  It was also nice to see President Woodrow Wilson onscreen and learn that things haven't changed so much in our country (for all our talk about freedom of speech, Americans truly are a censorous bunch when the person speaking raises uncomfortable questions about our commitments to what we claim to believe, as written in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights).I really love the hip style of filmmaking the producers used to make history alive and exciting, with some interesting shots (particularly the 360-degree shot at the end of the film, the intercuts of people's speeches, etc) and some current music to drive home the beats (Lauryn Hill's ""Everything is Everythin"" and Vertical Horizon's one hit wonder song).  Historical purists might be alarmed and cry foul, but I think its a fresh touch for what might have easily been a ""boring period film"" shown on PBS or the BBC.  This film has modern sensibilities and was easily able to maintain my interest throughout.  This film stands as an example of how to make a historical film be interesting and fresh to a younger generation.The scenes in prison were alarming, and all of it is new to me, as I never learned about any of this in high school or college history classes.  For that, I thank the filmmakers for bringing this topic to the screen.  I learned a lot and after watching this film, it makes me want to learn more.  That's the best that filmmakers can aim for.  All in all, a film worthy of being shown in high school history classes or required course assignments in college, discussed at length and to serve as an intro before diving into the subject of voting rights.  This film is an example that freedom is never given up by those in power.  At every step of the way, people must demand rights and not be afraid to pay the ultimate price for their demands.  This film deserves to serve as an inspiring call for any group that seeks to change our government to act in keeping with its words and founding principles.  If the people don't rise up and demand their rights be respected, no one else will.  History has shown it again and again, and this film is a perfect reminder of how far we've come...but also how much things haven't changed either.

825298,A341BG8RMH8QW,B00026L9CU,NotATameLion,"[7, 14]","I have mixed feelings on Iron Jawed Angels. One the one hand, it tells the story of a very important (and relevant) moment in American history--the movement for national women's suffrage.As a film, Iron Jawed Angels works. On first viewing it is very arresting (no pun intended) and involving. It is filled with great actresses and gets good turns from an aging Patrick Dempsey and a seemingly getting younger Bob Gunton (he sure didn't look this good a decade ago in The Shawshank Redemption).Like most movies of this genre, the historical accuracy is slain on the altar of story-telling. In a story like Ms. Paul's this is unneccessary and annoying. This story has more than enough to it to carry a movie without any ""improvements.""I can understand the poetic liscence with the voting at the end, but why must we make up a Senator and his wife to live this battle out in the microcosm of their family? It is tedious and steals the thunder of the history to have this man use his position to ""rescue"" these women.One person did make a big fan of me in this movie. That was Frances O'Connor. She steals this film as Lucy Burns. My wife likes all the Austen flicks and I actually brought home The Importance of Being Earnest, so I have had the pleasure of watching Ms. O'Connor's work before, but she is at the top of her game in this film.Unfortunately, on a second viewing of this film, she was one of very few things that held up twice. The soundtrack and cinematography that make the film grab you the first time around--to put it in a nice way--wear quickly.The soundtrack in particular will date itself horribly in the next decade (an aside: my brother once said the same thing about the humor in Disney's Alladin. I thought he was splitting hairs back then, but man, was he right.)So...now comes recommendation time: Iron Jawed Angels is a visually stunning and historically important movie.

I was able to catch snips of it when it aired on HBO originally, but it wasn't until this weekend that I saw the whole thing. Three times, actually, plus a once-through of the commentary track with the director and screenwriter.American cinema is usually quick to make movies about ""war heroes"", but much slower at pulling the trigger on our nation's heroes without guns... and even slower when those heroes are women. This is not a dull or overly dramatic movie about a long-overdue subject where the movie is just ho-hum but the topic makes it receive some sympathy points. This is a a great movie on its own.I liked the fact that the music wasn't from the teens or twenties. Not because I don't like musics of that era (a search of my previous reviews will show that I do), but because alot of people do not. Having a more modern soundtrack will probably do a better job at drawing more people into the film. Plus, I think it also makes a subliminal connection between the past and the present. These events are by no means ""old"" history, and I think music from today may do a better job for most people of making them feel like we as a nation are still very much tied to the events caused by/surrounding these great women.Beyond that, the movie shows them as humans, not as a cluster of no-personality drones who are always 100% serious and giving corny Hollywood-generica Hero Speeches. Also, they were not without flaw. In many director's hands, a movie of this topic very well may have ended up going that route, but here we get a great movie about the real events and real people that helped shape this nation... some of those people (the women) for better, and some (Woodrow Wilson & friends) for worse. Hopefully you already knew Wilson was garbage, but if not, this is a fine introduction to that fact.There are many great performances here, but the whole thing hinges on Hilary Swank's performance, in my opinion. What an excellent choice she was! Having seen it, I can only hope that production of the movie would have been delayed had she  already been engaged in another project at the time. After this movie, no one can play Alice Paul again. Well, I guess someone could, but why?Hopefully we can someday get movies of this magnitude about Ida B.

While acknowledging the need for women's rights, that same film also presented the women as pampered housewives who were really too busy for their families.Thank goodness this HBO movie is much more realistic about the American-British radical suffrage struggle.Alice Paul (Hillary Swank) and company may be conventionally attractive, but they are also not afraid to show how openly ticked off they are about being held to laws they cannot help form.Much to the chagrin of the older `respectable' American suffragists (who want to wait for men to give them the vote), the British experience encourages demand for full sociopolitical equality. When they are jailed for their convictions, the women refuse to eat. By our modern expectations, the prison response (shown in graphic detail) is especially brutal.For all of their progressive politics, Paul and company downplay race ironically in a time when such justice is most needed. Paul personally welcomes support of Delta Sigma Theta and other African American organizations, but worries their public presence will either undo or prevent the critical southern support necessary to winning suffrage. It is not easy to admit that our movement has an imperfect past, but it is important to ensuring a socially just future for all members. This conciousness is a marked improvement from days when even feminists themselves assumed their experiences applied for all women and race was a separate issue.Another plus, this same movie recognizes men have always supported the suffrage movement not because they wanted a partner, already had one, or were lobbied until they had no other public choice---but out of similar social justice concern.Again, earlier suffrage depictions (as with the larger feminist movement) erroneously claimed that the movement was all women. This more accurate historical picture may convince male viewers they have a similar obligation to work for the continuation of modern women's equality.  Other men will question their motives and some women will question their sincerity. But equality is really everybody's fight.Attending a college, which was founded by many suffragists, the emphasis on women college graduates (then a statistical minority) was especially sobering. Despite our current knowledge of women's studies and gender theory, I don't think my generation (including myself) appreciates how fortunate we are when we would have been jeered at in earlier generations for receiving a college degree. After seeing this movie, I walked across my own campus trying to imagine some of the local townspeople (opposed to the idea of women receiving a college education in their town) threatening us on a near constant basis.Precisely because Paul's Equal Rights Amendment was not ratified by the required states by the 1982 deadline, the film ends on a melancholy note. Paul's work remains half-finished and we have moral obligation to ensure the ERA becomes part of the constitution.Encouraging viewers to complete the revolution, the movie turns armchair loungers into activists.",5,Seeing this movie is a revolutionary experience,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,3427,"['Only', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'was', 'released', 'beginning', 'America', 'second', 'wave', 'feminism', 'was', 'sister', 'suffragettes', 'number', 'inspiring', '1964', 'snippet', 'British', 'suffrage', 'tactics', 'completely', 'convieniently', 'overlooked', 'radical', 'strategies', 'favor', 'bouncy', 'pert', 'cheerleading', 'could', 'otherwise', 'found', 'high', 'school', 'game', 'acknowledging', 'need', 'women', 'rights', 'same', 'film', 'also', 'presented', 'women', 'pampered', 'housewives', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'too', 'busy', 'families.Thank', 'goodness', 'HBO', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'American-British', 'radical', 'suffrage', 'struggle.Alice', 'Paul', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'company', 'may', 'be', 'conventionally', 'attractive', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'how', 'openly', 'ticked', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'laws', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'form.Much', 'chagrin', 'older', 'respectable', 'American', 'suffragists', 'who', 'want', 'wait', 'men', 'give', 'vote', 'British', 'experience', 'encourages', 'demand', 'full', 'sociopolitical', 'equality', 'When', 'are', 'jailed', 'convictions', 'women', 'refuse', 'eat', 'modern', 'expectations', 'prison', 'response', 'shown', 'graphic', 'detail', 'especially', 'brutal.For', 'progressive', 'politics', 'Paul', 'company', 'downplay', 'race', 'ironically', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'justice', 'most', 'needed', 'Paul', 'personally', 'support', 'Delta', 'Sigma', 'Theta', 'other', 'African', 'American', 'organizations', 'worries', 'public', 'presence', 'will', 'either', 'undo', 'prevent', 'critical', 'southern', 'support', 'necessary', 'winning', 'suffrage', 'not', 'easy', 'admit', 'movement', 'imperfect', 'past', 'important', 'ensuring', 'socially', 'just', 'future', 'members', 'conciousness', 'marked', 'improvement', 'days', 'when', 'even', 'assumed', 'experiences', 'applied', 'women', 'race', 'was', 'separate', 'issue.Another', 'same', 'movie', 'men', 'have', 'always', 'supported', 'suffrage', 'movement', 'not', 'wanted', 'partner', 'already', 'had', 'one', 'were', 'lobbied', 'had', 'other', 'public', 'choice', 'similar', 'social', 'justice', 'concern.Again', 'earlier', 'suffrage', 'depictions', 'larger', 'feminist', 'movement', 'erroneously', 'claimed', 'movement', 'was', 'women', 'more', 'accurate', 'historical', 'picture', 'may', 'convince', 'male', 'viewers', 'have', 'similar', 'obligation', 'work', 'continuation', 'modern', 'women', 'equality', 'Other', 'men', 'will', 'question', 'motives', 'women', 'will', 'question', 'sincerity', 'equality', 'really', 'everybody', 'fight.Attending', 'college', 'was', 'founded', 'many', 'suffragists', 'emphasis', 'women', 'college', 'graduates', 'then', 'statistical', 'minority', 'was', 'especially', 'sobering', 'current', 'knowledge', 'women', 'studies', 'gender', 'theory', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'generation', 'including', 'how', 'fortunate', 'are', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'jeered', 'earlier', 'generations', 'receiving', 'college', 'degree', 'seeing', 'movie', 'walked', 'own', 'campus', 'trying', 'imagine', 'local', 'townspeople', 'opposed', 'idea', 'women', 'receiving', 'college', 'education', 'town', 'threatening', 'near', 'constant', 'basis.Precisely', 'Paul', 'Equal', 'Rights', 'Amendment', 'was', 'not', 'ratified', 'required', 'states', '1982', 'deadline', 'film', 'melancholy', 'note', 'Paul', 'work', 'half-finished', 'have', 'moral', 'obligation', 'ensure', 'ERA', 'part', 'constitution.Encouraging', 'viewers', 'complete', 'revolution', 'movie', 'armchair', 'loungers', 'activists']",Iron Jawed Angels

Certainly, it couldn't have been a budget-breaker to have employed ""time-resistant"" classical music or at least music that, if ""period-specific,"" would be appropriate to the film's narrative setting.Seeing Angelica Houston reminded me of her appearance in her father's last movie--an adaptation of Joyce's ""The Dead"" (in some respects, as ""unfilmable"" as a movie could be--but that was Joyce's, not the Houstons', fault).

Definitely not a kids movie though due to some of the more adult scenes (some nudity, one scene alluding to more adult content without showing anything).  The only thing I wish is that the characters had been switched as I understand that Alice Paul was more aggressive than Lucy Burns (who was gentler in manner), but artistic expression on the director's part allows for some discrepancy.  They stayed very close to actual events, like splitting from NAWSA, starting NWP, picketing the white house, their time in jail (including the hunger strikes)...just a wonderful true to life movie, thanks to the amazing actresses/actors and thanks to the director for keeping this as true to the time period as she could!

Occasionally, an exceptional example to the contrary occurs, as we see in the woman's suffrage movement of the early 20th century. Iron Jawed Angels, HBO's dramatic and emotionally stirring fictional account of the trial and tribulations endured by the women activists involved in this fight, is a film that does just that. Released on DVD in the fall of 2004, the film reveals in the battle between traditonal culture and values, and a new class of bravado and progressivism that has endured for years benefiting both past and future activists of equal rights.The film stars Hilary Swank as Alice Paul, a young defiant yet charismatic woman growing up in a time when most would rather see her role as a bright, contemporary leader regulated to cleaning the house and making the families dinner. Swank does neither, as we see her embark on a drama filled journey of conflict and betrayal to secure the voting rights for American woman and witness the pain and hardship all women involved in this movement are forced to endure. The film builds on this as it concludes with her quest finally ending with the passing of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on August 26th, 1920.At times, I did feel like I was given an intermission of sorts, as we witness theme transformations and plot deviations in the form of a less than stellar romance involving Swanks lead character and a widowed but determined Washington Post editor brilliantly portrayed by Patrick Dempsey.  Francis O'Connor plays the remarkably likable but slightly vulnerable Lucy Burns, a sidekick of sorts who revels in the day she herself can settle down for marriage and a family to call her own. Legendary film veteran Angelica Houston tops off the films honors with her excellent and riveting portrayal of the leader of the National Woman's Suffrage Organization.An excellent example of how everyday woman can bring about change and optimism in modern day society, I felt enlightened and somewhat motivated after viewing Iron Jawed Angels. Questions I had about the treatment of the activists had been answered, for I had no idea why Swank and her cohorts had been labeled the `Iron Jawed Angels' before seeing the film. Witnessing a scene in which Swank is held down in a confinement chair while forcibly feed liquid nourishment as to combat her fasting crusade and avoid a martyrdom, I now had a new found understanding of what it meant to truly dig in and fight for your beliefs.Interestingly enough, discussions in my college Modern American History class that I've had the opportunity to be involved in have really helped in my understanding of how events of the past, even some that may seem trivial in comparison to modern day conflict, can take hold and shape how a culture looks at itself for generations to come. Minority based civil rights of the 1960's would prove a keen example of this, as African Americans could look into the past for one of the first times in our nations history and find role models in the woman that suffered unspeakable defiance in the face of ever changing and turbulent times.Had it not been for the courage and determination of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, along with hundreds if not thousands of other woman activists that held their ground and fought for suffrage rights, I believe that America would be less of a nation, one still involved in disagreement and inner turmoil over equal rights regardless of gender.
