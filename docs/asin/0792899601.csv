I recognized the name from the title, but I was pretty sure that it wasn't all going to be about Andy Warhol.  I was perplexed and ready for yet another adventure down the path of our nation's undiscovered history.  When I first started watching this movie I knew nothing about Valerie Solanas.  She is not in the history books labeled next to Andy Warhol, or is she one that oozes sympathy.  Solanas is a trash talking, independent thinker that somehow found herself next to one of the most modern men of our century, Andy Warhol.Lili Taylor helms this unbridled beast Solanas like no actress I have seen before.  I honestly felt as if Taylor had transformed herself into this brutal feminist.  After the first ten minutes, I didn't even recognize Taylor because she had successfully transformed herself into this insane (?) character who carried this film on her shoulders.  Taylor plays this woman who, for reasons unknown, constantly seeks Warhol's attention and approval.  When Andy refuses to devote his entire attention to her, her mental stability begins to fail.  In hopes to bring her back into the spotlight, and hopefully demonstrate to the world her manifesto, she does what the title of this film suggests.  Sadly, this has the opposite effect and she is forced to live with the act that she committed instead of the words that she has written.Taylor was phenomenal in this role.  She stole the scene from everyone and was never afraid to take Solanas to the next level.  Thankfully, she has some help from some amazing back-up stars to only help boost her performance.  Jared Harris is superb as Andy (one of the best reincarnations of him) and Stephen Dorff blazes onto the scene as Candy Darling.  Oscars should have been handed out for their parts in this film, but unfortunately this was yet another film the Academy ignored.Outside of the acting, director Mary Harron does a fabulous job of setting the scene and building the image of this era.  Warhol was a genius, and because of his fame and notoriety he somehow attracted some of the most interesting people in the world.  This is one of those stories of a woman that wanted to attach herself to this great man, yet somehow couldn't.  Harron directs these actors to show this with perfection.  Her brash cinematography and direction seem to blend perfectly in this boiling pot of history.  Her mix of documentary and biography genres works well in this film.  She commands attention behind the camera, and her actors react with positive responses.  This was a gritty story not for everyone's tastes.  It was a very true story that is more than just Andy Warhol, but also develops themes of feminism and women's rights.  Was Solanas crazy?  I don't think so, I just think she was ahead of her time and not afraid to be herself.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,You got to go through a lot of sex to be ready for anti-sex.,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2888,"['When', 'first', 'found', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'whom', 'was', 'recognized', 'name', 'title', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'going', 'be', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'was', 'perplexed', 'ready', 'yet', 'adventure', 'down', 'path', 'nation', 'undiscovered', 'history', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Valerie', 'Solanas', 'not', 'history', 'books', 'labeled', 'next', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'one', 'sympathy', 'Solanas', 'trash', 'talking', 'independent', 'thinker', 'somehow', 'found', 'next', 'one', 'most', 'modern', 'men', 'century', 'Andy', 'Warhol.Lili', 'Taylor', 'helms', 'unbridled', 'beast', 'Solanas', 'actress', 'have', 'seen', 'honestly', 'felt', 'Taylor', 'had', 'transformed', 'brutal', 'feminist', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'Taylor', 'had', 'successfully', 'transformed', 'insane', 'character', 'who', 'carried', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Taylor', 'woman', 'who', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'constantly', 'Warhol', 'attention', 'approval', 'When', 'Andy', 'devote', 'entire', 'attention', 'mental', 'stability', 'fail', 'hopes', 'bring', 'back', 'spotlight', 'hopefully', 'demonstrate', 'world', 'manifesto', 'what', 'title', 'film', 'Sadly', 'opposite', 'effect', 'forced', 'live', 'act', 'committed', 'instead', 'words', 'written.Taylor', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'stole', 'scene', 'everyone', 'was', 'never', 'afraid', 'take', 'Solanas', 'next', 'level', 'Thankfully', 'help', 'amazing', 'back-up', 'stars', 'only', 'help', 'boost', 'performance', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'superb', 'Andy', 'one', 'best', 'reincarnations', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'scene', 'Candy', 'Darling', 'Oscars', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'out', 'parts', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'yet', 'film', 'Academy', 'ignored.Outside', 'acting', 'director', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'fabulous', 'job', 'setting', 'scene', 'building', 'image', 'era', 'Warhol', 'was', 'genius', 'fame', 'notoriety', 'somehow', 'attracted', 'most', 'interesting', 'people', 'world', 'one', 'stories', 'woman', 'wanted', 'attach', 'great', 'man', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'Harron', 'actors', 'show', 'perfection', 'brash', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'seem', 'blend', 'perfectly', 'boiling', 'pot', 'history', 'mix', 'documentary', 'biography', 'genres', 'well', 'film', 'attention', 'camera', 'actors', 'react', 'positive', 'responses', 'was', 'gritty', 'story', 'not', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'story', 'more', 'just', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'also', 'themes', 'feminism', 'women', 'rights', 'Was', 'Solanas', 'crazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'not', 'afraid', 'be', 'herself.Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

It was also the best performance I've seen out of 1996 among the leading actresses. The makers did a great job of putting the elements together and made the party/gathering scenes to look very natural, something that was very badly missing in films of last 20 years like 54 and The Last Days of Disco. Also, they displayed a great control of the mess that I Shot Andy Warhol was becoming and infused an excellent pacing to the film. On the other hand, I liked Jared Harris' performance as Andy Warhol because in a way, he made Andy to look more superior and somewhat mysterious to everybody else around him yet was an ordinary person.

157942,A23BH24MXOPUZU,0792899601,Ben,"[2, 2]","I really enjoyed this film.  As a Factory fan, I was hesitant to get this, perhaps due to the off-putting title.  But I'm glad I did.  The acting was great, especially the actor who played Warhol himself - dead on.  Also, Ms. Taylor was 100% believable as the unfortunate, demented, freaky Valarie Solanas.I notice that a lot of negative reviews for this and other films consist of a rant about the film being the worst they ever saw, a waste of 2 hours, etc., but these folks never explain WHY they didn't like it.  This is true for some of the bad reviews here.Additionally, I'm not sure that that filmmaker Harron not taking a blantant stance against the SCUM Manifesto constitutes and endorsment of it; rather the opposite.  It seems to me that Solanas' rants are so out there and crazy that it isn't necessary to say ""Hey, this is wrong/bad/whatever.""  Her insane writtings speak for themselves. Why do people need to be spoon fed the obvious?While not a masterpiece (hence the 4 stars), this certainly is a good movie and a fascinating subject.  It is clearly not for everyone, as some of the reviews here illustrate.

A ""Midnight Cowboy"" for the 90's.This is one of my favorite films from the 90's. Certainly more of an edge than Oscar winners from the '90's Forrest Gump, Titanic and Shakespeare in Love.Lili Taylor as Valerie Solonas is superb. The overall cast is excellent. Stephen Dorff as Candy Darling is ... irresistible. Going beyond the fine acting is the direction, Mary Harron making it all just too real. She also co-wrote the script with Daniel Minahan, who later directed ""Series 7: The Contender"". Without Harron's tight handling, this film probably would have just been odd. Now it's great and odd. Billy Name, who was responsible for covering the actual Factory's inner walls in foil, was an advisor. He seems to have been put to good use.I've watched twice now, the second time seeming even more powerful than the first. The second half was especially absorbing. The entire Warhol scene seems fascinating. Reading about it first in a book like ""Popism: The Warhol Sixties"" might enhance viewing of this movie. Something to watch but perhaps to be glad not to have been part of.

157945,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0792899601,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[29, 34]","I suppose ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" is different things to different people. I have argued vehemently with friends whose opinion I respect about the extraordinary merits of this film. I think ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" was one of the finest films of 1998. I also think this film is blessed with one of the most intense performances of any era by Lili Taylor, unforgettable in the lead role of lesbian-prostitute-feminist-deranged-Warhol-groupie Valerie Solanas. Hers is a brave, utterly believable portrayal, wrought with desperation, loneliness and a creative need chained by conventions of American society.To expect a by-the-numbers retelling/recreation of the true events portrayed in this film - Solanas' assault of Andy Warhol - is entirely missing the point. I believe film director/writer Mary Harron was trying to reveal a type of exploitation of women that existed during this time, and certainly hovered in the shadows of the pseudo alternative arts culture of Andy Warhol's Factory - a dream-like warehouse littered with black-clad artists/writers/filmmakers instinctively creating against-the-grain works while rebelling against the conservative conventions of 1950s-1960s American culture.Harron's version of Solanas, who would go on to publish the frightening though fascinating work ""SCUM Manifesto,"" is a lonely, out-of-place soul. She initially appears to have found a comrade haven in Warhol's Factory. But her rage, plus her radical feminist views, eventually causes her ""excommunication,"" leading to her assualt of Andy. The shooting itself essentially ended Warhol's artistic career, leaving wounds which would never entirely heal.I like the contrast Harron makes several times throughout the film between Warhol (well played by Jared Harris) and Solanas - with Warhol as the effeminate introverted male and Solanas as the masculine extroverted female. These two are definitely opposite sides of the coin. I was also impressed by Harron's pointed observation of the women-hating exploitation that existed in much of the Factory's art. It has always been cool to admire Warhol and the legend of his Factory. Harron's recreation of several of the warehouse parties, including a memorable Velvet Underground concert, are some of the many highlights of this film.But eventually in Harron's film, Solanas' radical views are too counter culture for even Warhol and company. And once again Solanas is an outcast, lonely and adrift within the confines of the New York art scene of the 1960s. ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" is such a sad film in many ways, detailing lost souls void of acceptable identity. Solanas' rage is the angst of all struggling outcasts, cursed by a need to create, but unable to find the proper forum or audience. That she took her rage to the ultimate extreme should not be applauded. But to place her into the conventional (and safe) category of demented psycho is not entirely accurate. It's a brave stance ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" makes, and perhaps it is just another form of the emotional truth of this story.Harron's ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" is an alternative examination of alternative lifestyles. It's stance is disturbingly unique, with a creative style undeniable.",5,Alternative film hits alternative bull's-eye,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3184,"['suppose', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'different', 'things', 'different', 'people', 'have', 'argued', 'vehemently', 'friends', 'opinion', 'respect', 'extraordinary', 'merits', 'film', 'think', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '1998', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'blessed', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'performances', 'era', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'unforgettable', 'lead', 'role', 'lesbian-prostitute-feminist-deranged-Warhol-groupie', 'Valerie', 'Solanas', 'Hers', 'brave', 'utterly', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'wrought', 'desperation', 'loneliness', 'creative', 'need', 'chained', 'conventions', 'American', 'society.To', 'expect', 'by-the-numbers', 'retelling/recreation', 'true', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Solanas', 'assault', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'entirely', 'missing', 'point', 'believe', 'film', 'director/writer', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'was', 'trying', 'reveal', 'type', 'exploitation', 'women', 'existed', 'time', 'certainly', 'hovered', 'shadows', 'pseudo', 'alternative', 'arts', 'culture', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'dream-like', 'warehouse', 'littered', 'black-clad', 'artists/writers/filmmakers', 'instinctively', 'creating', 'against-the-grain', 'works', 'rebelling', 'conservative', 'conventions', '1950s-1960s', 'American', 'culture.Harron', 'version', 'Solanas', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'publish', 'frightening', 'fascinating', 'work', 'SCUM', 'Manifesto', 'lonely', 'out-of-place', 'soul', 'initially', 'have', 'found', 'comrade', 'haven', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'rage', 'radical', 'feminist', 'views', 'eventually', 'excommunication', 'leading', 'assualt', 'Andy', 'shooting', 'essentially', 'ended', 'Warhol', 'artistic', 'career', 'leaving', 'wounds', 'would', 'never', 'entirely', 'heal.I', 'contrast', 'Harron', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'Warhol', 'well', 'played', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'Solanas', 'Warhol', 'effeminate', 'introverted', 'male', 'Solanas', 'masculine', 'extroverted', 'female', 'two', 'are', 'definitely', 'opposite', 'sides', 'coin', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Harron', 'pointed', 'observation', 'women-hating', 'exploitation', 'existed', 'much', 'Factory', 'art', 'always', 'been', 'cool', 'admire', 'Warhol', 'legend', 'Factory', 'Harron', 'recreation', 'several', 'warehouse', 'parties', 'including', 'memorable', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'concert', 'are', 'many', 'highlights', 'film.But', 'eventually', 'Harron', 'film', 'Solanas', 'radical', 'views', 'are', 'too', 'counter', 'culture', 'even', 'Warhol', 'company', 'once', 'again', 'Solanas', 'outcast', 'lonely', 'adrift', 'confines', 'New', 'York', 'art', 'scene', '1960s', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'sad', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'detailing', 'lost', 'souls', 'void', 'acceptable', 'identity', 'Solanas', 'rage', 'angst', 'struggling', 'outcasts', 'cursed', 'need', 'create', 'unable', 'find', 'proper', 'forum', 'audience', 'took', 'rage', 'ultimate', 'extreme', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'applauded', 'place', 'conventional', 'safe', 'category', 'demented', 'psycho', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'brave', 'stance', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'perhaps', 'just', 'form', 'emotional', 'truth', 'story.Harron', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'alternative', 'examination', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'stance', 'disturbingly', 'unique', 'creative', 'style', 'undeniable']",N/A
157946,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792899601,Dennis Littrell,"[12, 13]","Director Mary Harron invades the sixties tinfoil castle of Andy Warhol and spins a kind of art deco loser romance with the very talented Lili Taylor playing the very butch Valerie Solanas, who actually did shoot Andy Warhol.  I have been driving myself crazy trying to recall who Taylor is taking off on, some little guy, ghetto denizen from a forgotten flick of my mind.  If anybody recognizes the style, please let me know.  Anyway, she manages to be surprisingly sympathetic as the authoress of the SCUM manifesto (that's ""Society for the Cutting Up of Men"") and a play entitled ""Up Your ...,"" which I suppose is appropriate considering the decadence depicted.  Taylor's Valerie Solanas is strangely winning as a victim of a desperate, mad integrity.  (I suspect the real Valerie was anything but sympathetic.)  She won't take a job but will beg, panhandle, turn tricks and steal.  She's a true believer whose main tenet is that men are something akin to a disease.  Because she is bright and witty and courageous she wins us over even though she hates us.  We forgive her because we know she hurts a lot and can't help herself.  (To which she would say, ""..."")Harron decorates this sixties cum nineties version of New York chic/flophouse reality with the kind of degenerate personalities for which the Big Apple is justly famous.  Jared Harris plays Andy Warhol brilliantly with something like a truer than true characterization, combining a sympathetic, eccentric and gentle exterior with an exploitive mercantile heart.  One gets the sense that he had it coming.  Stephen Dorff is Candy Darling, a transvestite so fetching that he makes a guy like me wish he had a sister.  Lothaire Bluteau as Olympia Press publisher Maurice Girodias seems a little young, but otherwise fits the bill, and Martha Plimpton as Stevie does a nice job in a modest part.  The sound track might catch your ear with Blue Cheer performing the Coasters' ""Summertime Blues"" and Bettie Serveert doing a fine interpretation of Dylan's ""I'll Keep It with Mine.""  Jewel (yes, the very same) sings ""Sunshine Superman,"" and completing the nineties accent on the sixties, REM does ""Love Is All Around.""  Probably outright anachronistic is the use of an aluminum soda can to smoke grass.  I don't think that came into practice until later when the skunkweed got so strong you could smoke it like hash.Some other sights: the Andy Warhol hanger-ons doing a faux sand-painting mandala with pills as they party, and then one of them rolling her naked torso into the pills so that they stick to her body.  Or the guy coming out of--an encounter, we'll call it--with a jar of Vaseline in hand in time to greet some slumming French aristocratic ladies whose hands (one gloved) he kisses.

157947,A84UFSF2SZS2W,0792899601,"EriKa ""E""","[3, 5]","Lili Taylor is a mysterious actress, gifted and almost chameleonic. She plays manic so well that you cannot tell if it is real or pretend. Of course, you see her in a ""normal"" role and she is perfectly normal. So you have to determine that the woman is just gifted beyond what talents actors normally have. Would I say that Taylor is underrated? No, she receives raves for the work she does. Does she choose to appear in every movie that comes along? No. She appears to be extremely selective about her projects, which is why, to this day, half the people I ask, will have no idea who Lili Taylor is.This film, though, is definitely a one woman show. There are peripheral characters (and even a stunning turn in drag for Stephen Dorff as Candy), but Taylor as the progressively more troubled writer and feminist Valerie Solanas IS the movie. The performance is both repulsive and compulsive... and compelling. I found myself sickened with Solanas's life as portrayed in the movie. She begged on the streets, prostituted herself, and lived on the edge of poverty because she did not believe in working. She wrote and wrote and wrote. And she pestered. This endless and manic pursuit of people-the pestering-is what bothered me most. I don't want to have people in my face bothering me, and this appeared to be Solanas's specialty. She somehow managed to endear herself to the bizarre Andy Warhol, and although the rest of his crowd could have done without Solanas, Warhol (at least at first) took a liking to her. Once he and his fickle friends tired of Solanas's intensity and-maybe-insanity, they ignored her. But Solanas was never one to be ignored. This, ultimately, is probably why she shot Andy Warhol. She did not kill him, but she did indeed shoot him.The film is quite well done, and the acting from Taylor is superb and makes the film quite worthwhile.",3,SCUM,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,1861,"['Lili', 'Taylor', 'mysterious', 'actress', 'gifted', 'almost', 'chameleonic', 'manic', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'real', 'pretend', 'course', 'see', 'normal', 'role', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'have', 'determine', 'woman', 'just', 'gifted', 'what', 'actors', 'normally', 'have', 'Would', 'say', 'Taylor', 'underrated', 'No', 'raves', 'work', 'Does', 'choose', 'appear', 'movie', 'along', 'No', 'be', 'extremely', 'selective', 'projects', 'why', 'day', 'people', 'ask', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'is.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'woman', 'show', 'are', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'even', 'stunning', 'turn', 'drag', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Candy', 'Taylor', 'progressively', 'more', 'troubled', 'writer', 'feminist', 'Valerie', 'Solanas', 'movie', 'performance', 'repulsive', 'compulsive', 'compelling', 'found', 'sickened', 'Solanas', 'life', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'begged', 'streets', 'prostituted', 'lived', 'edge', 'poverty', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'working', 'wrote', 'wrote', 'wrote', 'pestered', 'endless', 'manic', 'pursuit', 'people-the', 'pestering-is', 'what', 'bothered', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'people', 'face', 'bothering', 'appeared', 'be', 'Solanas', 'specialty', 'somehow', 'managed', 'endear', 'bizarre', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'rest', 'crowd', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Solanas', 'Warhol', 'least', 'first', 'took', 'liking', 'fickle', 'friends', 'tired', 'Solanas', 'intensity', 'and-maybe-insanity', 'ignored', 'Solanas', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'be', 'ignored', 'ultimately', 'probably', 'why', 'shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'did', 'indeed', 'shoot', 'him.The', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'Taylor', 'superb', 'film', 'quite', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Its a brilliant film that takes you into a world that is often ugly yet impossible to turn away from.  The first time I watched it, I felt a little uncomfortable with some of the subject matter.  I don't see this movie as making a judgment call on either side.  It just tells the story of the deterioration of this woman and her growing hatred and obsession with Andy Warhol that led to the shooting.  Valerie wrote this odd little play with a name I can't write here.  She found her way to the Factory through Candy Darling, a drag queen brilliantly portrayed by Stephen Dorff.  None of them were interested too much in the play and it got tossed out with the trash.  After being duped by a shady publisher for her feminist manifesto, she became increasingly enraged and obsessed with Warhol who she believed was trying to steal her book.I have to admit that this would be a disturbing film for most people.  Her ideas were very warped and skewed by a hatred and distrust of men.  The ironic thing was that she probably could have been a good writer if her bitterness and insanity hadn't taken over.  I think this shows what can happen to a person sexually abused as a child.  Its a really depressing film that always makes me wince whenever I see it.  However, its so powerful that I've watched it many times.  I think Lily Taylor should have got an Oscar for this film.  She put her heart and soul into this character.All in all, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  Its definitely a film that offends a lot of people.

157957,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0792899601,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[3, 3]","The 1996 film ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" is a bizarre film based upon the true story of a bizarre woman named Valerie Solanas (Lili Taylor) who, in the late 1960's in Manhattan, became an acquaintance of the famous pop artist Andy Warhol (Jared Harris).  Obsessed with misandry and blaming men for all of the world's problems, Valerie wrote a booklet advocating an anarchistic and violent revolution to be carried out by women in order to create a female-only society.  Valerie used the booklet, which she named the ""SCUM Manifesto"" (where SCUM referred to ""Society for Cutting Up Men""), as a way to try and make money, often by attempting to sell copies (that she had typed & copied herself) on the streets of New York City, and at parties given by Andy Warhol at his famous art studio known as ""The Factory"" to which Andy had invited her. (During the film, Valerie is often shown quoting directly from the ""SCUM Manifesto"".)  Valerie also wrote a play equally hateful of men that she asked Andy Warhol to produce, but his apparent lack of interest and misplacement of her only copy that she had lent him to read angered the already highly irrational Valerie.  This encouraged Andy to ignore Valerie and set the stage for the film's final scenes.Though often times difficult to watch with the scenes involving drug use and the various odd people that were part of Andy Warhol's life in New York City, it is the quality of the acting performances given principally by Lili Taylor, Jared Harris and Stephen Dorff (who played the drag queen known as Candy Darling, the only man that Valerie appeared to trust) that made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" worth watching.

How ironic (or is it?) that not even he was immune from someone looking for their 15 minutes at his expense.  It nearly cost him his life, but we got to see the true story of the woman behind the myth when it came to Andy Warhol's career.Valerie Solarnis was angry at the world, to say the least.  She was a lesbian hooker in New York who was looking to publish her SCUM manifesto (the Society for Cutting Up Men).  Indeed she had even presented it as her final thesis in college, why men are biologically inferrior to women.  Eventually, she joins forces with a few of the trendy people, and gains access to The Factory.  Here she meets Andy and the rest of his Warhol Superstars, a bunch of creative, eccentric people who are both innovative and pretentious.  Heady with the promise of being with the In Crowd, Valerie even appears in one of Andy's Movies ""I A Man"", she anxiously hopes that he will publish her work.  Andy, not really caring for it, yet just as vain as the next celebrity, puts her down.  As she is descending into paranoia and obsessing on her own causes, Valerie walks into the Factory one day, pulls out a gun, and shoots Andy.  She then walks out onto the street, hands to gun over to a policeman who just happened to be there on his beat, and said ""I shot Andy Warhol"".What is this all about really?  Mental health?  Making a statement to others?  Showing us that she was right and the whole rest of the world is wrong?  No, it's about fame.  She got her 15 minutes of fame.  Then she was committed to a mental hospital and died there.  End of story.  She wasn't really trying to get her point across, she was just another nutcase who targeted a celebrity to make herself famous.  Is that all it is?

Poor Valerie's fifteen minutes of fame were up quickly.  The impression I recall of her was that of very disturbed, unattractive person.Valerie Solanas, as portrayed by the brilliant Lilli Taylor, is a whole different person. Yes she does some horrible things but she does them in such a defiant spirit, with so much wit and even charm, that we, the viewers are pulled in to root for her.  At least I was.  This is my main objection to the film---the glamorization of someone who was beyond pathetic.  It's customary Hollywood practice---Bonny and Clyde were not nearly as beautiful as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway; I don't know what Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid looked like but I doubt they came close to Newman and Redford.  I've never seen a Mafia guy come close to the charm and looks of Brando or Pacino, etc. etc. etc.But this is an important Indie Film.  Aren't they supposed to be truthful and beyond the gimmicks of Hollywood?  Was it the purpose of the film maker to garner our sympathy for Solanas and/or her beliefs by portraying her by this charming, perky and even cute actress?  Would the real Solanas have approved?  Who knows?Warhol and his scene were fascinating for many.  There is a much better documentary of his life which gives a view of the Factory that seems more believable.  Warhol was a very smart man, even a genius, and there must have been more appeal to the place than the silliness than is shown in this film.If you're looking for a realistic picture of Valerie Solanas, I don't think this is it.  If you're looking for a realistic view of this time of Warhol's life, I think you can find better elsewhere.  Still, if you don't care about accuracy, this is an interesting film.

It's particularly good at showing the arty crowd that orbited Andy Warhol, that formed his circle, his salon of admirers.You might come away from this film a little disillusioned about Warhol and a little suspicious of his talent. When he's shown here, he seems to be dabbling, daubing - rather than creating any really expressive works of art. His main talent seems to be making himself available to young artistic aspirants. He's one of the few icons of pop culture who is approachable and willing to personally encourage young, unconventional stylists. You can see this aspect of Warhol clearly shown elsewhere in the movie ""Basquiat."" But here we see it's Warhol's sheer availability, his willingness to be got at - that leads to his tragedy.His mentoring sometimes turns out to be just another facet of his dabbling. He takes an interest for a while, promises sponsorship - then dismisses people from his orbit when they begin to bore him. This is what happened to Valerie Solanas, a gamine intent on publishing and getting wide circulation for her radical man-bashing polemic ""Scum Manifesto."" Her quirky rage and irreverence amuses Warhol for a while. But then when he drifts on to other amusements, her craziness is compounded with rage directed at him. She turns dangerous. Lili Taylor does a superb job projecting this generally rejected, rejecting figure, slouching towards mayhem.However, this isn't a movie about stalking. It isn't a thriller. It's an authentic recasting of those anti-establishment days when people crashed in pads - then simply crashed. It's an informal, let-it-all-hang-out dramatization of the times leading up to the assault that changed Andy Warhol's life.",4,A Revealing Blast from the Past,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,1792,"['movie', 'remarkable', 'snapshot', 'hanging-loose', 'hanging-out', 'times', 'late', '60', 'particularly', 'good', 'showing', 'arty', 'crowd', 'orbited', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'formed', 'circle', 'salon', 'admirers.You', 'might', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'little', 'disillusioned', 'Warhol', 'little', 'suspicious', 'talent', 'When', 'shown', 'here', 'be', 'dabbling', 'daubing', 'rather', 'creating', 'really', 'expressive', 'works', 'art', 'main', 'talent', 'be', 'making', 'available', 'young', 'artistic', 'aspirants', 'one', 'few', 'icons', 'pop', 'culture', 'who', 'approachable', 'willing', 'personally', 'encourage', 'young', 'unconventional', 'stylists', 'can', 'see', 'aspect', 'Warhol', 'clearly', 'shown', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'Basquiat', 'here', 'see', 'Warhol', 'sheer', 'availability', 'willingness', 'be', 'got', 'tragedy.His', 'mentoring', 'sometimes', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'facet', 'dabbling', 'interest', 'while', 'sponsorship', 'then', 'people', 'orbit', 'when', 'begin', 'bore', 'happened', 'Valerie', 'Solanas', 'gamine', 'intent', 'publishing', 'getting', 'wide', 'circulation', 'radical', 'man-bashing', 'polemic', 'Scum', 'Manifesto', 'quirky', 'rage', 'irreverence', 'amuses', 'Warhol', 'while', 'then', 'when', 'other', 'amusements', 'craziness', 'compounded', 'rage', 'directed', 'dangerous', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'superb', 'job', 'projecting', 'generally', 'rejected', 'rejecting', 'figure', 'slouching', 'towards', 'mayhem.However', ""n't"", 'movie', 'stalking', ""n't"", 'thriller', 'authentic', 'recasting', 'anti-establishment', 'days', 'when', 'people', 'crashed', 'pads', 'then', 'simply', 'crashed', 'informal', 'let-it-all-hang-out', 'dramatization', 'times', 'leading', 'up', 'assault', 'changed', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'life']",N/A

I love Lili Taylor's performance in this, she is so dedicated and attached to her character that it comes off as totally believable and fascinating to watch.  I also love Stephen Dorff's portrayl of Candy Darling.  It's hard to believe this is the same actor who starred in the movie ""Blade"". I've seen this film several times and I always find something new to take from it.  It's a brilliant character driven movie that damaged people like myself do appreciate and understand.  I love one of the lines Candy Darling recited when reading from her journal.  ""I find that socially unacceptable people make better lovers because they are more sensative"", something like that which gives you some insight on the human condition and makes you think about life in a different light.",5,Just Shoot Me,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,894,"['love', 'films', 'centered', 'tragic', 'strange', 'characters', 'Shot', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'plenty', 'say', 'least', 'love', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'performance', 'so', 'dedicated', 'attached', 'character', 'off', 'totally', 'believable', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'also', 'love', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'portrayl', 'Candy', 'Darling', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'starred', 'movie', 'Blade', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'take', 'brilliant', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'damaged', 'people', 'do', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'love', 'one', 'lines', 'Candy', 'Darling', 'recited', 'when', 'reading', 'journal', 'find', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'people', 'make', 'better', 'lovers', 'are', 'more', 'sensative', 'something', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'think', 'life', 'different', 'light']",N/A
