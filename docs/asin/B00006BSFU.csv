My kids just say ""that's silly"" and ignore that they're jumping into a coloring book world.  In some shows, that wouldn't seem to be strange (in Magic School Bus, for example, that would be a very tame field trip), but for Dora it just seems ""wrong"".  Anyway, the others are fine but not the best episodes.  Our favorite Dora DVD remains ""Meet Diego"" because of the animal focus.",4,"Christmas episode is good, but...",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,521,"['Christmas', 'episode', 'yes', 'just', 'one', 'good', 'have', 'empathically', 'agree', 'other', 'folks', 'who', 'think', 'Quack', 'Quack', 'weird', 'kids', 'just', 'say', 'silly', 'ignore', ""'re"", 'jumping', 'coloring', 'book', 'world', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'strange', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'tame', 'field', 'trip', 'Dora', 'just', 'wrong', 'Anyway', 'others', 'are', 'fine', 'not', 'best', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'Dora', 'DVD', 'Meet', 'Diego', 'animal', 'focus']",Dora the Explorer - Christmas VHS
