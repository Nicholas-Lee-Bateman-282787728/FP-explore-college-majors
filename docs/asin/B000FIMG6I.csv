991416,A2SW560X584UEF,B000FIMG6I,Barbara B.,"[0, 0]","I am a liberal feminist, so the idea of a show about a liberal female president appealed to me. I suppose, like so many others, I was expecting a feminized version of West Wing. It's not surprising that I was disappointed.My biggest problem was that the whole show was a real downer. There was hardly any comic relief, no joy whatsoever. The backstabbing, quarreling, pettiness and barrage of major problems one right after the other may be closer to real life than I'd like to believe, but it doesn't make for an entertaining show. On West Wing, there was at least a core group of people with shared values working together. Here, everyone is at each others' throats all the time. And, on WW, the opposition wasn't necessarily ""the enemy."" On this show, they made the Donald Sutherland character so reprehensible that there is no real balance; it's like Superman vs The Riddler without the jokes.The plotlines involving the family are far too ""soap opera"" for me. The older two children are old enough to behave in a more mature fashion, particularly since they had supposedly been living at the VP residence for two years.One other problem I had was that, for a show that was supposedly woman-centered and even feminist, the same Hollywood double standards apply:  men can be old, fat or unattractive but the female leads are all relatively thin and beautiful. How many women in Washington really look like Genna Davis, Natasha Henstridge or Leslie Hope?Bottom line is that the main reason I loved West Wing was that, in the end, it showed the US government at its best (from a liberal POV of course!). This show focuses on our government at its worst.Compared to most of the other drivel on the tube, this was a great show. But compared to West Wing and some of the other really outstanding political dramas aired over the years, this one didn't quite make it for me.",3,So depressing it makes you want to move overseas,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,1870,"['am', 'liberal', 'feminist', 'idea', 'show', 'liberal', 'female', 'president', 'appealed', 'suppose', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'expecting', 'feminized', 'version', 'West', 'Wing', 'not', 'surprising', 'was', 'disappointed.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'real', 'downer', 'was', 'hardly', 'comic', 'relief', 'joy', 'whatsoever', 'backstabbing', 'quarreling', 'pettiness', 'barrage', 'major', 'problems', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'closer', 'real', 'life', ""'d"", 'like', 'believe', ""n't"", 'make', 'entertaining', 'show', 'West', 'Wing', 'was', 'least', 'core', 'group', 'people', 'shared', 'values', 'working', 'together', 'Here', 'everyone', 'others', 'throats', 'time', 'WW', 'opposition', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'enemy', 'show', 'made', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'so', 'reprehensible', 'real', 'balance', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Riddler', 'jokes.The', 'plotlines', 'involving', 'family', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'soap', 'opera', 'older', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'behave', 'more', 'mature', 'fashion', 'particularly', 'had', 'supposedly', 'been', 'living', 'VP', 'residence', 'two', 'years.One', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'supposedly', 'woman-centered', 'even', 'feminist', 'same', 'Hollywood', 'double', 'standards', 'apply', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'old', 'fat', 'unattractive', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'relatively', 'thin', 'beautiful', 'How', 'many', 'women', 'Washington', 'really', 'look', 'Genna', 'Davis', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'Bottom', 'line', 'main', 'reason', 'loved', 'West', 'Wing', 'was', 'end', 'showed', 'US', 'government', 'best', 'liberal', 'POV', 'course', 'show', 'government', 'worst.Compared', 'most', 'other', 'drivel', 'tube', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'compared', 'West', 'Wing', 'other', 'really', 'outstanding', 'political', 'dramas', 'aired', 'years', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make']",Commander in Chief: The Inaugural Edition - Part One

991419,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000FIMG6I,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Commander in Chief is obviously attempt to ride the wake of the success of West Wing. Unfortunately, it didn't quite succeed. I can see why. It's a good how, but has some flaws. Here's the rundown:GOODThe acting is all around strong. Of course, Geena Davis gives a strong performance as the first female president with a mixture of strength and motherliness. Donald Sutherland as her arch-nemesis Speaker Nathan Templeton is brilliant, combining regal dignity with deviousness. All of the characters are multifaceted and most have a realistic mix of motivations. Even Templeton is never portrayed as simply a villain but rather a politician who believes the country would be better off with him as president.I also appreciate that the plot lines don't become two ridiculous (with one or two exceptions). It's tempting for a show like this to simply feature a foreign or political crisis every week, but Commander in Chief doesn't overdo these.BADI think the biggest problem with the show is its self-righteousness. The show always portrays the president as morally and politically superior to anybody around her. Her policies are portrayed as the right ones, even when they're questionable (particularly the first episode, which seems to endorse a vision of American imperialism and interventionism). She always finds some out-of-the-box policy solution to outwit her opponents. However, I think the show would have been more interesting if we see the president or her team trip up occaisionally.Another issue is that the president is both the first female president and a political independent. It's a bit too much and the show sometimes seemed undecided as to which aspect to emphasize. Especially after the 2008 election, it's pretty easy to imagine a female president. However, an independent is less realistic and the show doesn't quite pull it off. More often it becomes the president against the Republicans.The show isn't quite as wonky as West Wing. More of the episodes focus on the first family. Obviously, this is natural with the first female president, but I can understand why much of the West Wing audience didn't care much for the episode where the teens go wild in the White House.Overall, it's a good show, but I can see why it was never great.",4,Entertaining and not too inaccurate,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2263,"['Commander', 'Chief', 'obviously', 'attempt', 'ride', 'wake', 'success', 'West', 'Wing', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'good', 'how', 'flaws', 'Here', 'rundown', 'GOODThe', 'acting', 'strong', 'course', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'strong', 'performance', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'mixture', 'strength', 'motherliness', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'arch-nemesis', 'Speaker', 'Nathan', 'Templeton', 'brilliant', 'combining', 'regal', 'dignity', 'deviousness', 'characters', 'are', 'multifaceted', 'most', 'have', 'realistic', 'mix', 'motivations', 'Even', 'Templeton', 'never', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'villain', 'rather', 'politician', 'who', 'country', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'president.I', 'also', 'appreciate', 'plot', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'two', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'tempting', 'show', 'simply', 'feature', 'foreign', 'political', 'crisis', 'week', 'Commander', 'Chief', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'these.BADI', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show', 'self-righteousness', 'show', 'always', 'president', 'morally', 'politically', 'superior', 'anybody', 'policies', 'are', 'portrayed', 'right', 'ones', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'questionable', 'particularly', 'first', 'episode', 'endorse', 'vision', 'American', 'imperialism', 'interventionism', 'always', 'out-of-the-box', 'policy', 'solution', 'outwit', 'opponents', 'However', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'president', 'team', 'trip', 'occaisionally.Another', 'issue', 'president', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'political', 'independent', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'undecided', 'aspect', 'emphasize', 'Especially', '2008', 'election', 'pretty', 'easy', 'imagine', 'female', 'president', 'However', 'independent', 'less', 'realistic', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'More', 'often', 'president', 'Republicans.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'wonky', 'West', 'Wing', 'More', 'episodes', 'focus', 'first', 'family', 'Obviously', 'natural', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'much', 'West', 'Wing', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'episode', 'where', 'teens', 'go', 'wild', 'White', 'House.Overall', 'good', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'never', 'great']",Commander in Chief: The Inaugural Edition - Part One

991422,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FIMG6I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 16]","The first thing that needs to be said is that it is bad enough that there are only ten of the eighteen episodes that make up the complete run of ""Commander In Chief"" contained in ""The Inaugural Edition, Part 1.""  But that tenth episode, ""Sub Enchanted Evening,"" is the first of a two-part story that is concluded in Episode 11, ""No Nukes Is Good Nukes,"" which will be available in Part 2.  We are used to cliffhangers coming at the end of a season and therefore in the last episode of a complete season, but as the last episode of an arbitrary stopping point?  There are eighteen episodes, you can do nine and nine to avoid this problem, but I think it is just a stupid marketing ploy.  This is strange given that these DVDs have the worst cover art for a current (or recently cancelled) television series I have ever seen.  Oh, and while I am at it, Mackenzie Allen did not have an inaugural.  She was at one, before the series started when she was sworn in as vice president, but you do not get one when you assume the duties of the chief executive when the president dies.  You lose double points for being cute when you get it wrong like this.The point of ""Commander in Chief"" is to tell the story of the first woman president of the United States.  Her resume is that she was a prosecutor, elected to the U.S. Congress twice as an independent from Connecticut (they have had an independent Senator), and then Chancellor of the University of Richmond (Go Spiders!).  When Republican Vice President Teddy Bridges runs for president, he gets her to be his running mate.  If this seems like a weird political ploy, for the Republican nominee to pick a less conservative woman as his running mate, then you should know the Democratic nominee picked a more conservative man, a general no less, to be his running mate.  In the ""Pilot"" episode, a dying Bridges wants Allen to resign so that Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton (Donald Sutherland) can become president.  If she agrees, then there is no show.  There is a show, just not a very good one.The show's premise is that we get the first woman president when a woman becomes vice president and the president dies in office.  Fair enough.  That was how we got the youngest president in the nation's history, Theodore Roosevelt.  But creator Rob Lurie wants to stack the deck against Mackenzie Allen. Since she is an independent, she has no party support when she decides to take the oath of office.  Templeton and the rest of Bridge's staff are worried what the rest of the world will think if a woman becomes president, as opposed to worrying what the rest of the world will think when we change the rules to avoid having a woman become president.  Once she is in the Oval Office she has people on her staff betraying her and everybody else in the government out to get her or get in her way.Fortunately, there is nothing wrong with Geena Davis' performance as President Allen.  She acts presidential, she is a lot smarter than anybody gives her credit for being, and she is committed to doing the right thing.  She is also a bit of an idealist, which is arguably the most unrealistic aspect of the character.  The problem is the Templeton character, who is out to destroy the president, as if he can do that without harming the country (think the My Lai mentality where you destroy something in order to save it).  Templeton thinks himself a great statesman, but he is closer to Willie Stark as opposed to any contemporary politician.  The last time I saw a Republican portrayed as being this unconscionable on television it was a made for television about Joseph McCarthy, ""Tailgunner Joe.""I admit I watched this show each week just to see how it would tick me off.  I think politicians are more incompetent than they are corrupt, but ""Commander-in-Chief"" is dedicated to the reverse proposition.  Every week Templeton would try to take down the president while sanctimoniously declaring he was doing it for the good of the country.  The fault is not in Sutherland's performance, but in the writing that insists on sticking to the same basic formula as each episode Allen proves her moral and political superiority over Templeton.  However, this is unnecessary.  Selecting a vice president or National Security Advisor, dealing with the death of DEA agents in Latin America, hosting a summit for the Russian president, and handling a hurricane or a damaged submarine are all dramatically interesting without going round and round with Templeton each week.There are some good points to the show, so it is not all painful. Harry J. Lennix as Jim Gardner always seems like the smartest person in the room and a decent Chief of Staff who does his job when others are playing politics.  Having Polly Bergen, who played the first woman president in a movie way back in 1964 with ""Kisses for My President"" playing Mac's mom Kate was a nice touch.  Attention is paid to the three kids who suddenly find themselves part of the First Family, but if some guy starts boasting about sleeping with the President's daughter that the Secret Service would at least take him in for questioning, even if he is not lying about it.  Then there is whole uproar over what influence the First Gentleman, Rob Calloway (Kyle Secor), might have on his wife.  He was her Chief of Staff as vice president and attorney general of Connecticut at some point and if he has some sort of official position in her White House the world comes to an end?  Give me a break.  Wait a minute, they already did that with this DVD set.  Just another thing to be ticked off about with this late and semi-lamented show.",3,A timely idea for a series destroyed by unnecessary complications,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,5631,"['first',

I hope it gets aired again, but just in case it doesn't, I think that purchasing this dvd is a good idea in order to be able to remember the ""good old times""  :)For those not fortunate enough to have seen this show, ""Commander in chief"" is a political drama that has a bit of comedy, a great cast of actors and a good plot. It is based on an interesting premise: what would happen if, due to unforeseen circumstances, a woman were to be president of the United Stated. That is what happens to Mackenzie Allen (Geena Davis),that becomes president after President Teddy Bridges (Will Lyman) dies. Without political support of her own, she will have to learn how to survive Washington politics and balance her time-consuming new position with her family. Not an easy job, but something that is quite entertaining to watch!All in all, I can say that I love this show, and that I can recommend it to you. If you are not sure you will like a show more or less centered on politics, rent this dvd instead of purchasing it, but don't miss the opportunity of watching ""Commander in chief"".Belen Alcat",4,"""What a town.

Walker ""catu11us""","[3, 3]","It's hardly likely to elicit any argument if I note that ""Commander in Chief was deliberately planted in ground already prepared by ""West Wing"".  Unfortunately it was only a good show, not a great one.  It was certainly better than to numerous dreary sitcoms infesting the small screen these days, not to mention the even drearier ""reality"" (there's a laugh!) shows, and the utterly drearier quiz and contest shows.  In the end, however, even the considerable presence of Geena Davis and the brilliant (but challenged) malevolence of Donald Sutherland couldn't save the series.  ""Commander in Chief"" disappeared in mid-1st season, after 18 episodes.The premise of ""Commander in Chief"" is this:  a Republican candidate for President chooses a progressive Independent woman (Mackenzie Allen) to be his Vice President - in order, as one character puts it, ""to get the soccer mom vote"".  Vigorous and athletic, he gets his just desserts in the form of a massive heart attack.  On his deathbed he orders her to resign so that the terminally ambitious Speaker of the House, Nathan Templeton.  She agrees, but ultimately rejects this course and takes the oath of office.  Allen and Templeton are of course Davis and Sutherland, and their struggle for power forms the core of the series.  Although every episode or couple of episodes contain one or more subplots, everything relates to the Allen-Templeton feud - and this makes the series fundamentally a soap opera.  It's a very high-tone soap opera, but still ... .Allen brings into the Residence with her a husband, Rod Calloway, and 3 children: teenage fraternal twins (boy and girl) and a much younger daughter.  They are played by decent, but not well-known, actors.  She also inherits the former President's cabinet and staff.  Among the latter is the Chief of Staff, Jim Gardner, played with effective gravitas by the very talented Harry Lennix.The series proceeds with President Allen dealing doggedly with one crisis after another - international, domestic, administrative, whatever.  Templeton (the name of the rat in ""Charlotte's Web"", by the way) is always lurking, trying to sabotage Allen's efforts, or to take advantage of her difficulties, or at the very least to gloat - and all this despite her repeated demonstrations of kindness and good will toward him (which seem to touch him at the time).  In spite of seemingly intractable difficulties, Allen always seems to choose the road less traveled and wins through.And that is the real difficulty of this fine but flawed series.  Although the various crises differ in detail, the basic plot outlines are very much the same.  She is such an honest, well-meaning goody-goody, so enthused about doing right, that the palm of victory seems virtually to drop in her lap, willy-nilly.  We don't expect these astounding successes at the beginning, but after a half-dozen or so episodes we simply expect them.Overall, ""Commander in Chief"" is an interesting diversion, and it's not half-bad - and, as I said, better than so much else.

After all, she was only picked to increase Bridges's support with women voters. Bridges administration personnel did not actually expect her to assume the presidency.Instead, Allen decides that she will take the oath of office and become America's first woman president. For creator Rod Lurie, having a woman president was not enough; he wanted to examine how the chief executive of America balanced her work and family obligations.Because this change in American women's political status also affects men, 'Commander' also examined how husband Rod Calloway (Kyle Secor) adapts to being the 'first' First Gentleman. Claiming to be comfortable, Rod subsequently expresses obvious discomfort with some aspects of his own new public image (""First...Do No Harm""). A major strength of this series was that it also gives serious airtime to the challenges a First Gentleman could face.Rod briefly considers becoming commissioner of baseball before deciding that it would pose a conflict of interest (""First Disaster""). Later on, the Allen-Calloway marriage gets challenged when he is discovered with an intern (""The State of the Unions"").""Rubie Dubidoux and the Brown Bound Express"" makes another inevitable comparison with the Clinton administration. Since he is unofficially her closest advisor, Mackenzie subsequently decides that appointing Rod to an official position only makes sense. However gender politics in 21st Century America doesn't have that decision being perceived as smoothly as this first couple would like. Is Mackenzie a strong leader or is Rod ultimately controlling her? Is this nepotisim or is he really the most qualified person for the job?""Commander"" is also special because Polly Bergen guest stars as Mackenzie's mom, Kate Allen. Bergen had ironically stared in ""Kisses for my President"" (1964) Hollywood's earlier take on what having a female Chief Executive would be like. That president had to resign when she got pregnant!""The Mom Who Came to Dinner"" also marks the addition of Mark-Paul Gosselaar to the cast as Richard ""Dickie"" McDonald, a young but very sharp media advisorOf course having a good drama would have been remotely impossible without a good arch nemesis on hand to keep things heated up. He's still a 'Hollywood liberal' but Donald Sutherland plays conservative Republican Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton with gleeful abandon. Templeton is continually a thorn in Allen's side--he does not like her on either a political or a personal level.10 episodes are included in this release. Extras include unaired scenes (mmm...!), an exclusive interview with Geena Davis, and insights into the show itself from the creator--replete with commentary.

991437,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000FIMG6I,Wayne C. Rogers,"[7, 9]","I missed Commander In Chief when it was on the air last year.  I did, however, just purchase the entire 18-episodes of the series on two different DVD sets.  The show turned out to be so good that I watched all the episodes in just two days.  Now, I'm having a hard time understanding why ABC cancelled this great series, especially since there's a chance that we may very well elect a female President in 2008.  I was truly captivated by Geena Davis's performance as Mackenzie Allen in this series.  She was smart, strong when necessary, compassionate, politically wise, and had the hottest legs of any President that I've seen.  The series not only showed the tremendous amount of stress that a President is constantly under with hundreds of decisions needing to be made every week, but also the back-stabbing that goes on continuously in Washington, D.C. and how difficult it is to get anything worthwhile done.  There's also the stress on the President's family and how they manage to cope with being under the spotlight each and everyday with the media just waiting for something to pound them with.  The acting in this series by everyone is excellent.  Kyle Secor as Rod Calloway (the President's husband) does a marvelous job of demonstrating how hard it is to be the First Gentleman and the ridicule that he has to deal with.  Polly Bergen does a fine job of playing the President's mother.  Donald Sutherland, however, often steals the show as the cunning Speaker of the House, Nathan Templeton, who desires to be the President.  He admires President Allen for her stead-fast principles, while seeing them as a weakness on her part and using that to his own advantage.  What makes Sutherland's role so tasty is that the character of Templeton actually believes that he's doing the right thing!  Another strong role is that of the Chief of Staff, Jim Gardiner, who's played by Harry Lennix.  He's had the hard job of dealing with the death of his former boss and then adapting to the new President, a woman that almost no one wanted to see in that position.  Peter Coyote starred in several episodes as the appointed Vice President under Mackenzie Allen.  I hated to see him leave the show.  Retired Army Captain, Dale Dye, has also been in a number of shows where the military has been called upon to rescue the crew of a damaged submarine and to set up the rescue of American hostages being held by terrorists.  The children in the show do a fine job of rebelling against their parents and getting themselves into situations that bring negative publicity onto the President.  All in all, I believe that Commander In Chief was one of the best series ever on television, and I'm sorry that there won't be any other shows to watch in the future.  I believe that if ABC had given this series one more season that it would've turned into a blockbuster for them.  After all, Geena Davis did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a television drama just as it was announced that the show was being cancelled.  Highly recommended to those who love well-acted dramas about politics and the Washington scene.",5,I can't believe ABC cancelled this magnificent series!!!,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,3117,"['missed', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'last', 'year', 'did', 'however', 'just', 'purchase', 'entire', '18-episodes', 'series', 'two', 'different', 'DVD', 'sets', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'watched', 'episodes', 'just', 'two', 'days', 'Now', ""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'ABC', 'cancelled', 'great', 'series', 'especially', 'chance', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'elect', 'female', 'President', '2008', 'was', 'truly', 'captivated', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'performance', 'Mackenzie', 'Allen', 'series', 'was', 'smart', 'strong', 'when', 'necessary', 'compassionate', 'politically', 'wise', 'had', 'hottest', 'legs', 'President', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'showed', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'stress', 'President', 'constantly', 'hundreds', 'decisions', 'needing', 'be', 'made', 'week', 'also', 'back-stabbing', 'continuously', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'how', 'difficult', 'get', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'done', 'also', 'stress', 'President', 'family', 'how', 'manage', 'cope', 'being', 'spotlight', 'everyday', 'media', 'just', 'waiting', 'something', 'pound', 'acting', 'series', 'everyone', 'excellent', 'Kyle', 'Secor', 'Rod', 'Calloway', 'President', 'husband', 'marvelous', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'hard', 'be', 'First', 'Gentleman', 'ridicule', 'deal', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'President', 'mother', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'however', 'often', 'show', 'cunning', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Nathan', 'Templeton', 'who', 'be', 'President', 'President', 'Allen', 'stead-fast', 'principles', 'seeing', 'weakness', 'part', 'using', 'own', 'advantage', 'What', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'so', 'tasty', 'character', 'Templeton', 'actually', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'strong', 'role', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Jim', 'Gardiner', 'who', 'played', 'Harry', 'Lennix', 'had', 'hard', 'job', 'dealing', 'death', 'former', 'boss', 'then', 'adapting', 'new', 'President', 'woman', 'almost', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'position', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'starred', 'several', 'episodes', 'appointed', 'Vice', 'President', 'Mackenzie', 'Allen', 'hated', 'see', 'leave', 'show', 'Retired', 'Army', 'Captain', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'also', 'been', 'number', 'shows', 'where', 'military', 'been', 'called', 'rescue', 'crew', 'damaged', 'submarine', 'set', 'up', 'rescue', 'American', 'hostages', 'being', 'held', 'terrorists', 'children', 'show', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'rebelling', 'parents', 'getting', 'situations', 'bring', 'negative', 'publicity', 'President', 'All', 'believe', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'television', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'other', 'shows', 'watch', 'future', 'believe', 'ABC', 'had', 'given', 'series', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'blockbuster', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'did', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'television', 'drama', 'just', 'was', 'announced', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'cancelled', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', 'well-acted', 'dramas', 'politics', 'Washington', 'scene']",Commander in Chief: The Inaugural Edition - Part One
