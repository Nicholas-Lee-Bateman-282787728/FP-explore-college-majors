I mean I almost never sit down and watch any kind of game on TV, or go to a sporting event, or know what other guys are talking about when the subject of baseball, football, or basketball comes up.  I could name a couple of players in every sport, the ones that everyone else knows, but that is it.  So that said, I think this set is nothing short of great.  I love documentaries that are well made and take you into a world that you don't know about in a way that makes it fascinating.  I've watched documentaries on scrabble, spelling bees, or competitive crossword puzzles and loved them.  Most stories have taken an aspect of some sport and told a story that has drawn me in almost immediately.  Usually it is an interesting part of a much larger picture.  For instance, I know who Wayne Gretzky, the hockey player, is and I have a vague recollection of him coming to the US, but I never knew the story of how it affected the people of Edmonton and all of the drama behind it.  Also very interesting to hear him talk about it now.

They were such a contrast, both in temperament and playing style. I remember being totally awed by the power and aggressiveness of Martina's game, and at the same time impressed by Chris's steely determination and passing shots. It always surprised me to hear that they were friends off court, because the media liked to play up personality issues and the extremes of their competition.This documentary is a wonderful inside look at their careers and lives in respect to each other, both on and off the court. I had an overwhelming sense of nostalgia as I watched, reliving the excitement I experienced watching them play all those years ago. And it was heartwarming to see how these two great women relate to each other as they talked about their shared past.Both women come across as very open and willing to discuss almost anything. They share a lot of interesting insights about themselves, and each other. They also cover a few interesting tidbits about how women's tennis has changed between then and now. I like the format chosen, where most of the time they are simply in conversation with each other. It came across as relaxed, natural, and very real. These scenes are interspersed with tennis footage and individual interviews.My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I would have loved it even more if Unmatched were twice as long and included a lot more tennis footage. The tennis clips that are included are quite brief, and I think I was expecting a little more in that regard.I highly recommend Unmatched to anyone who fondly remembers the greatest tennis rivalry of all time, or to anyone interested in the history of women's tennis.

They go into enough detail without boring the viewer, and have some big names attached as far as directors are concerned.  Great sports stories of the past 30 years that some people may have never known about - some feel good stories, some not so much.  Always interesting, always entertaining, always learning - these are a great way to learn about some of America's greatest passions from the people who know/care the most about them.

All the other professional sports and pastimes just don't interest me all that much.  As such, I was a bit skeptical (despite the very positive reviews) of this set of documentaries considering its wide-ranging appeal.  Boy, was I ever wrong!Simply put, these are some of the best sports documentaries ever produced...period.  They are so varied and genre-diverse that describing them all would take too long for this kind of review forum, but suffice it to say that there were only 1-2 of them that were ""so-so"" for me.  All the rest sucked me in from the beginning and made me truly care until the very end.Thus, if you have ANY doubts about whether or not you will enjoy this series, check them at the door RIGHT NOW!  Even if you aren't a raging sports enthusiast, these documentaries will appeal to your very human nature with their drama and thought-provoking nature.
