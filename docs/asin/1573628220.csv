190831,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,1573628220,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 5]","This TV movie is an excellent adaptation of the classic novel by Dostoyevsky.  This is the story of Rodya Raskalnikov (Patrick Dempsey), an intellectual who is suspended from University and is living in poverty in  19th century Russia.  Raskalnikov believes that in order for great men like  Napoleon to accomplish great things, they must be above the law.With  this as a psychological backdrop, he gets the news that his sister has been  discharged from her governess position and she is considering marrying a  rich man she doesn't love to keep the family from starving.  He reasons  that he, being a great man, must take action to prevent this travesty.  So  he decides he should kill his pawnbroker, a despicable woman who preys on  the misfortune of others, and take her money to save his sister from  prostituting herself in this terrible marriage.  He reasons that the pawn  broker deserves to die anyway, and that his sister's future is far more  important.  The remainder of the story is a study in the torment and guilt  he feels, and from which he cannot escape intellectually.The film  remains true to the novel, which is one of the classics of Russian  literature.  It is well directed, filmed in Poland to give it an authentic  eastern European look.  Joseph Sargent does an excellent job of capturing  the rank poverty of the time in contrast to the opulence of the  privileged.This is Patrick Dempsey's shining moment, by far the best  I've ever seen him.  He does a terrific job of capturing the overwrought  Rodya's agony and emotional distraction.  Although Dempsey was sometimes  overly manic in his portrayal, this is one of the most complex characters  in literature and it is impossible to imagine anyone getting him just the  way Dostoyevsky wrote him.  Dempsey has come a long way since the Woo Woo  Kid (""In The Mood"", 1987).Ben Kingsley was also terrific as the wily  police chief who suspects Rodya of the crime, but with no evidence,  cleverly manipulates his psyche to make the guilt unbearable.I rate this  film a 9/10.  It is no substitute for reading the novel, but in comparison  to most of what is on the market, this is a gem.  Most refined viewers will  not regret seeing this film.",5,Excellent Adaptation of a Classic,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,2219,"['TV', 'movie', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'novel', 'Dostoyevsky', 'story', 'Rodya', 'Raskalnikov', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'intellectual', 'who', 'suspended', 'University', 'living', 'poverty', '19th', 'century', 'Russia', 'Raskalnikov', 'order', 'great', 'men', 'Napoleon', 'accomplish', 'great', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'law.With', 'psychological', 'backdrop', 'news', 'sister', 'been', 'discharged', 'governess', 'position', 'considering', 'marrying', 'rich', 'man', ""n't"", 'love', 'keep', 'family', 'starving', 'reasons', 'being', 'great', 'man', 'must', 'take', 'action', 'prevent', 'travesty', 'should', 'kill', 'pawnbroker', 'despicable', 'woman', 'who', 'misfortune', 'others', 'take', 'money', 'save', 'sister', 'prostituting', 'terrible', 'marriage', 'reasons', 'pawn', 'broker', 'die', 'anyway', 'sister', 'future', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'remainder', 'story', 'study', 'torment', 'guilt', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'intellectually.The', 'film', 'true', 'novel', 'one', 'classics', 'Russian', 'literature', 'well', 'directed', 'filmed', 'Poland', 'give', 'authentic', 'eastern', 'European', 'look', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'rank', 'poverty', 'time', 'contrast', 'opulence', 'privileged.This', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'shining', 'moment', 'far', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'terrific', 'job', 'capturing', 'overwrought', 'Rodya', 'agony', 'emotional', 'distraction', 'Dempsey', 'was', 'sometimes', 'overly', 'manic', 'portrayal', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', 'literature', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'getting', 'just', 'way', 'Dostoyevsky', 'wrote', 'Dempsey', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Woo', 'Woo', 'Kid', 'Mood', '1987', '.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'also', 'terrific', 'wily', 'police', 'chief', 'who', 'Rodya', 'crime', 'evidence', 'cleverly', 'psyche', 'make', 'guilt', 'unbearable.I', 'rate', 'film', '9/10', 'substitute', 'reading', 'novel', 'comparison', 'most', 'what', 'market', 'gem', 'Most', 'refined', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'seeing', 'film']",N/A

I looked at the length of the movie (89 minutes) and figured it would cut out a lot of the book.  But I did not expect it to cut out so many of the extremely vital  events, conversations, characters and stories.  The plot in the book is  extremely thick and the movie is merely a portion of a shodow of the book.  Needless to say I was very disappointed in this movie.  If you have read  the book, don't waste your money or time on this movie.  However, if you  haven't read the book, this may be a mildly entertaining movie for you.  But don't write a book report from this movie and don't expect the same  deep moral storyline that is in the book.  If you seen this movie, don't  let it deter you from reading the book.

If you do, you will invariably be disappointed.  This film takes only the main elements of the book (how could it do otherwise ?) and packs them tightly into a psychologically suspenseful cocoon of innocent ambitions, sinister evil, and ultimately- - regenerative redemption.  The story is a classic, and this Hallmark Hall of Fame Presentation does a fine job of transporting the viewer to turn-of-the-century Russia to see the conflict of good vs. evil unfold.

190835,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1573628220,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","It's not the condensed story that really disappointed me.  Surprisingly, this made-for-TV film retains ALL the crucial episodes of the original Dostoyevsky novel.  Rodya's killing of an old pawnbroker, his sister's plight in her hometown, his friendship with Dimitri, and his faithful love Sonia (with her poverty-stricken family).  And Siberia, bullet in the head, oily Inspector Porfiry and his 'trap.'  I found every episode that impressed me while reading the book.  What I couldn't find is, psychological depth that makes Dostoyevkey's book one of the greatest novels of the world.The story is a famous one, so I don't write it here.  All I can say about it is that, instead of changing or deleting the episodes of the original, they stick to the course of the major events surrounding the guilt-ridden hero Rodya Raskolnikov, and moreover, speed up the development of the plot (that consists more than 500 pages in ordinary paperback form).That means, if you have not read the book yet, you might have some trouble in following the fast-paced story.  Who is this guy?  Why is he acting like that?  How could she have a pistol in her bag?  Before you know it, Sonia's mother vanishes in the air.  What happened to Rodya's sister?  What makes a certain character commit suicide?  It's like reading a summery, not the novel.I know the film is not novel (and the data at imdb suggest that the film underwent a heavy cutting before released on video.)  However, the fact remains that the film reminds me of a soap-operaish potboiler that goes without ever explaining the inside of the characters.  In this film, when Rodya commits crimes, he does it too abruptly.  At least it looks like that, so he suddenly decides to do what he does, like, after something flashing in his eye, with contorted facial expressions, Booom!  there he goes, like a Grade-B serial killer movie.  His guilt is expressed with the lopside camera and fast-cut flashbacks and close-ups of people's faces looking into his eye -- including that of Ben Kngsley with strange beards.With this script, you just cannot blame anyone involved in the film.  Patrick Dempsey's Rodya is so-so, Ben Kingsley's Porfily is just OK, and Julie Delpy as Sonia is too beautiful for the role, like Heather Graham in 'From Hell.'  The constant use of actors' heavy accent has only detracting effects, and as to the location, oh, it's too obviously felt that it is not the 19th century Russia (it's today's Hungary).I understand the difficulty of handling the huge material like Dostoyevsky.  This made-for-TV, however, manages to contain all the main episodes, but fails to capture the spirit of the novel.  It surely traces the crimes and their consequences, but doesn't present the characters while we really want to know them more, especially, Rodya and Sonia.",2,"The Film Follows the Story, But Loses the Spirit of the Book",1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2817,"['not', 'condensed', 'story', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Surprisingly', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'crucial', 'episodes', 'original', 'Dostoyevsky', 'novel', 'Rodya', 'killing', 'old', 'pawnbroker', 'sister', 'plight', 'hometown', 'friendship', 'Dimitri', 'faithful', 'love', 'Sonia', 'poverty-stricken', 'family', 'Siberia', 'bullet', 'head', 'oily', 'Inspector', 'Porfiry', ""'trap"", 'found', 'episode', 'impressed', 'reading', 'book', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'psychological', 'depth', 'Dostoyevkey', 'book', 'one', 'greatest', 'novels', 'world.The', 'story', 'famous', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'here', 'can', 'say', 'instead', 'changing', 'deleting', 'episodes', 'original', 'stick', 'course', 'major', 'events', 'surrounding', 'guilt-ridden', 'hero', 'Rodya', 'Raskolnikov', 'moreover', 'speed', 'up', 'development', 'plot', 'more', '500', 'pages', 'ordinary', 'paperback', 'form', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'fast-paced', 'story', 'Who', 'guy', 'Why', 'acting', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'pistol', 'bag', 'know', 'Sonia', 'mother', 'vanishes', 'air', 'What', 'happened', 'Rodya', 'sister', 'What', 'certain', 'character', 'commit', 'suicide', 'reading', 'summery', 'not', 'novel.I', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'novel', 'data', 'imdb', 'suggest', 'film', 'underwent', 'heavy', 'cutting', 'released', 'video', 'However', 'fact', 'film', 'soap-operaish', 'potboiler', 'ever', 'explaining', 'inside', 'characters', 'film', 'when', 'Rodya', 'crimes', 'too', 'abruptly', 'least', 'suddenly', 'do', 'what', 'like', 'something', 'flashing', 'eye', 'contorted', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Booom', 'Grade-B', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'guilt', 'expressed', 'lopside', 'camera', 'fast-cut', 'flashbacks', 'close-ups', 'people', 'looking', 'eye', 'including', 'Ben', 'Kngsley', 'strange', 'beards.With', 'script', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'anyone', 'involved', 'film', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Rodya', 'so-so', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Porfily', 'just', 'OK', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'Sonia', 'too', 'beautiful', 'role', 'Heather', 'Graham', ""'From"", 'Hell', 'constant', 'use', 'actors', 'heavy', 'accent', 'only', 'detracting', 'effects', 'location', 'oh', 'too', 'obviously', 'felt', 'not', '19th', 'century', 'Russia', 'today', 'Hungary', '.I', 'understand', 'difficulty', 'handling', 'huge', 'material', 'Dostoyevsky', 'made-for-TV', 'however', 'contain', 'main', 'episodes', 'capture', 'spirit', 'novel', 'surely', 'crimes', 'consequences', ""n't"", 'present', 'characters', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'especially', 'Rodya', 'Sonia']",N/A
