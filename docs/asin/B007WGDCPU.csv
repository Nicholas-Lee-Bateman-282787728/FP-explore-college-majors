1539337,AUYOSNKVHJAD6,B007WGDCPU,Chris W,"[1, 2]","I absolutely loved this short lived series. I wish they could have kept this going but sadly it looks like this all we're going to get. I would say my favorite episode on this series would have to be episode 2. Love the sci-fi convention scene and especially the whack job scene starring none other than Johnny Depp. ""Wanna go to the toilet with me?"" Mr. depp asks and cut to Warwick standing literally in the toilet and Johnny saying, ""Toilet troll love it!"" That scene had me bawling to be honest. Among other great episodes there are other funtastic viewings of other celebs inluding Helena Bonham Carter, Cat Deeley, and Sting. I definitely recommend this series if you were ever a fan of Warwick Davis.",5,Any true fan of Warwick's buy this,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,707,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'short', 'lived', 'series', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'going', 'sadly', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'would', 'say', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'episode', '2', 'Love', 'sci-fi', 'convention', 'scene', 'especially', 'whack', 'job', 'scene', 'starring', 'none', 'other', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Wan', 'na', 'go', 'toilet', 'Mr.', 'depp', 'cut', 'Warwick', 'standing', 'literally', 'toilet', 'Johnny', 'saying', 'Toilet', 'troll', 'love', 'scene', 'had', 'bawling', 'be', 'honest', 'other', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'other', 'funtastic', 'viewings', 'other', 'celebs', 'inluding', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Cat', 'Deeley', 'Sting', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'series', 'were', 'ever', 'fan', 'Warwick', 'Davis']",N/A

1539339,A3P15Y71H9UVZA,B007WGDCPU,"Mr. Fahey ""TBW""","[7, 8]","The only bad thing about this series is it only has seven episodes.  If you like Ricky Gervais and his type of humor, you'll like this fictional account of Warrick Davis's life as a little person actor.  The cameos are hysterical and amazing considering how famouse these people are.  It's cleverly written and has a cast of supporting characters who are all well done.  I recommend it for an afternoon of laughs.  There are no plans to continue the series at this time and that's a shame, becuase it is hysterical.If you don't like the British version of the Office or Extras, etc. Don't watch this, it isn't for you.

1539340,A3OFZFLLURJNVZ,B007WGDCPU,P David,"[3, 3]","This show is just plain funny. This show proves that Warwick Davis is a phenomenal comic actor. He does the double takes, delivers the straight lines, has great reaction shots, but is perhaps best in physical comedy. If you enjoy dry comedy or slapstick, it is absolutely worth the money to buy this DVD (actually 2 DVDs). The cameos by Liam Neeson and Johnny Depp are, if anything, rather tedious compared to Warwick Davis' brilliant acting. Don't hesitate to take a chance on this. I look forward to watching it again and again.",5,Funniest show I've seen in years,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,530,"['show', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'show', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'phenomenal', 'comic', 'actor', 'double', 'straight', 'lines', 'great', 'reaction', 'shots', 'perhaps', 'best', 'physical', 'comedy', 'enjoy', 'dry', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'money', 'buy', 'DVD', 'actually', '2', 'DVDs', 'cameos', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'are', 'anything', 'rather', 'tedious', 'compared', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'take', 'chance', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Warwick has been one of my favorite actors since I saw him in Willow. When you see the body of work he's done (no pun intended), you'll see how versatile he is. From the sweet and caring Willow to the funny character he plays on this show to the Harry potter characters to the evil and vile Leprechaun, he can do ANYTHING. It's nice to see him get a gig where people see his face and see him talk about his life and films, even if it is all in jest. Give this show a chance, it's totally unique.
