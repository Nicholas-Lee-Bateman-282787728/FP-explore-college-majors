684070,AI345DWOQT367,B00005UF7Z,faith star,"[10, 35]","One thing being copiously quoted from this movie is certainly true - the claim that we're living in extreme days. Extreme days these are indeed when so many ""Christians"" fall into singing the praises of this as a supposedly ""Christian"" movie. Are an ever greater portion of ""Christians"" becoming like the infamous People's Temple that met its demise back around 1982, willing to fall for whatever they are told in ""Christian"" guise, even if told to drink cyanide? It's hard to grasp how anyone's Christian discernment has not already received its lethal dose of cyanide when such a one can fall for this as a ""Christian movie"". A relatively minor problem with this lies in the way the guys in this movie talk at times of how their participation in extreme sports helps them know they're alive. The notion of needing to flirt with danger to know one is alive is dubious enough to equate with any Christian experiencing of the divine, and it's downright irresponsible to lead young people to associate such risk-taking with Christian meaning. But the really fatal flaw to any thought of this being a Christian movie comes through its supposed heroine, Jesse, who joins the guys in their adventures. She's a self-righteous person who supposedly teaches the guys valuable ""lessons about life"" and calls upon them to practice pre-marital abstinence. But she's hardly one to ""save"" them, and her demands for pre-marital abstinence must grow out of self-absorbed narcissism, not real Christian committment. If in no other way, her hypocricy is thoroughly exposed when the group of main characters fights another group they meet over who gets the last available campsite at a campground. Yes, they fight in this ""Christian"" movie. Jesse is the only female in either group. At least in the male on male pairings in the fight, some semblance to fair fighting is practiced. But Jesse goes against a guy who declines to fight back. That doesn't keep her from giving him a good beating while HE turns the other cheek. Finally he presents her a bouquet of flowers as a peace offering. She pretends she's going to accept them, only to get close enough to surprise him with a swift karate kick to his crotch! Gee, what a ""Christian""!

Too bad, because I was really looking forward to this one. This is one of those rare occasions in which the trailer for the movie was A WHOLE LOT BETTER than the movie itself! There was hardly a plot and the acting wasn't exactly spectacular, either. There were some of the corniest jokes and attempts at humor ever put on film, and some horrible dialogue. Laughing while watching this movie was a very rare thing.All in all, bad attempt at Christian filmmaking -- if Christians are gonna make good, wholesome movies (which we desperatly need)they need to do it right!
