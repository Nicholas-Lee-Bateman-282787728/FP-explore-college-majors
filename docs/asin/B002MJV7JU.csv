1278295,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002MJV7JU,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Summer's Moon is a pretty strange movie.  For one thing it's certainly not a horror.  For 90% of the time, it's not really a suspense either.  The storyline is a confusing mess beginning halfway through and never really making sense to me after this. Despite these flaws, it has a few surprisingly good moments so I'm sort of in between whether it's worth recommending or not.The flaws are pretty obvious.  For one thing, the character of Ashley Greene -attractive as she may be- presents herself as a hitchhiker that doesn't like perverts demanding sexual favors, but certainly desires lots of sleazy overnight sex with complete strangers.  This means when she's eventually kidnapped, it's hard to sympathize with her character because of the kind of girl she is.  It turns out the young man she's sleeping with secretly kidnaps women, takes them to his basement and ties them up so they can't see the light of day.  So far pretty compelling (despite the low budget Ghost Whisperer-resembling acting of course).Then we find out the girl came all this way to visit her father.  However by this point it's painfully clear that the type of ""suspense"" we're witnessing doesn't stand a chance of winning me over personally.  It's too much like a horror movie for those that are easily frightened which means for the *rest* of us, we really won't care about the plot development.  Also, it really annoys me (not to mention sends up a red flag that Summer's Moon isn't even trying to be taken seriously) that the young man and Ashley's character are basically flirting in a ""hard to get"" kind of way throughout the first half.  Ashley's supposed to be terrified that she's been kidnapped but she doesn't seem very concerned most of the time.  It comes across more like ""Oh, a hot guy just kidnapped me- maybe I won't run away after all"".  Also, how many times did we hear the threat ""I'm going to rip your tongue out!""  Too many times.However when the man eventually lets the girl escape from the basement, that's when I knew this was a total dud of a movie.  But... unbelievably, there's *still* hope so the film's not a complete disaster.  The final 20 minutes *finally* provides some compelling and decent storyline writing when the father/husband comes home and causes chaos with his family.  Of course his inclusion felt somewhat tacked on as a quick way to wrap up a confusing storyline, but regardless of that, his character alone saves Summer's Moon and makes a possible recommendation somewhat tricky for me.  I'd say, if you can find this movie for a cheap price it may be worth it.  Otherwise you can skip it without missing much.",3,"flawed, extremely confusing... but improves by the end",1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,2635,"['Summer', 'Moon', 'pretty', 'strange', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'certainly', 'not', 'horror', '90', '%', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'suspense', 'either', 'storyline', 'confusing', 'mess', 'beginning', 'halfway', 'never', 'really', 'making', 'sense', 'flaws', 'few', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'moments', ""'m"", 'sort', 'worth', 'recommending', 'not.The', 'flaws', 'are', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'one', 'thing', 'character', 'Ashley', 'Greene', '-attractive', 'may', 'be-', 'presents', 'hitchhiker', ""n't"", 'like', 'perverts', 'demanding', 'sexual', 'favors', 'certainly', 'lots', 'sleazy', 'overnight', 'sex', 'complete', 'strangers', 'when', 'eventually', 'kidnapped', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'character', 'kind', 'girl', 'out', 'young', 'man', 'sleeping', 'secretly', 'kidnaps', 'women', 'basement', 'ties', 'up', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'light', 'day', 'So', 'far', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'low', 'budget', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer-resembling', 'acting', 'course', 'find', 'out', 'girl', 'came', 'way', 'visit', 'father', 'However', 'point', 'painfully', 'clear', 'type', 'suspense', ""'re"", 'witnessing', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'winning', 'personally', 'too', 'much', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'easily', 'frightened', '*rest*', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'development', 'Also', 'really', 'not', 'mention', 'up', 'red', 'flag', 'Summer', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'young', 'man', 'Ashley', 'character', 'are', 'basically', 'flirting', 'hard', 'get', 'kind', 'way', 'first', 'half', 'Ashley', 'supposed', 'be', 'terrified', 'been', 'kidnapped', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'concerned', 'most', 'time', 'more', 'Oh', 'hot', 'guy', 'just', 'kidnapped', 'me-', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'Also', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'hear', 'threat', ""'m"", 'going', 'rip', 'tongue', 'out', 'Too', 'many', 'times.However', 'when', 'man', 'eventually', 'girl', 'escape', 'basement', 'when', 'knew', 'was', 'total', 'dud', 'movie', 'unbelievably', '*still*', 'hope', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'final', '20', 'minutes', '*finally*', 'compelling', 'decent', 'storyline', 'writing', 'when', 'father/husband', 'home', 'chaos', 'family', 'course', 'inclusion', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'tacked', 'quick', 'way', 'wrap', 'up', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'regardless', 'character', 'alone', 'Summer', 'Moon', 'possible', 'recommendation', 'somewhat', 'tricky', ""'d"", 'say', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'cheap', 'price', 'may', 'be', 'can', 'skip', 'missing', 'much']",N/A

1278306,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002MJV7JU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Summer's Moon (Lee Demabre, 2009)Like most obsessive film snobs (at least, most obsessive film snobs I know), I keep best- and worst-of lists. I'm a little crazier than most, and have been unduly influenced by guys like David Thomson and Peter Travers, so I recently expanded my hundred-best list to a thousand-best list. (New movies get added to it at least once a month. There's so much out there to watch!) The hundred-worst list, however, is a lot less changeable. It's all half-a-star and zero-star movies, and despite my love of pure, unadulterated crap, I don't see all that many movies that are that horrible. For seven years, Lee Demabre's third film, Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, occupied the #2 spot on that list. (It was supplanted a couple of months ago by Brian Yeo's horrid Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie, coincidentally also a Canadian film. Predictably, it now resides at #3.) It is so far beyond terrible that better critics than I will have to invent new words for how beyond terrible it is. Which begs the question of why I'm sitting here writing this reminiscence while watching Demabre's most recent movie, Summer's Moon. And there's one answer: Stephen McHattie. I love Stephen McHattie, and will watch him in anything, from Gray Lady Down (which I saw in the theater! At nine years old!) to A History of Violence to Kaw, and every movie I've seem him in, well, at least he's good.Plot: Summer (Twilight's Ashley Greene) has grown up without a father, but she wants to find him, thanks to her deteriorating relationship with her mother. So, armed with nothing but an old photograph and a vague idea of where he lives, she heads north. All well and good until she runs into smooth-talking, sexy Tom Hoxey (Family First's Peter Mooney), who ends up being a psycho who has a thing for keeping a ""garden"" of lovely young transients in his basement, aided and abetted by his equally nutzoid mom (the wonderful Barbara Niven, probably best remembered these days for a role on the TV series Pensacola: Wings of Gold). She's been willing to put up with him doing it for a while, but just before taking Summer, he got a little greedy and took a girl from town, Amber (Carny's Dani Kind), whose father (The Bone Collector's Peter Michael Dillon) has just been sprung from prison and is now looking for her. And to top it all off, Tom's wayward father (McHattie) is coming home...If you can't see the big plot twist coming five minutes into this movie, you haven't watched enough movies like this. It's painfully obvious, and that's one of the movie's biggest weaknesses; Conradt (a veteran writer of Lifetime Original Movie fare) and Hogan (who wrote the much, much better Lie Still) didn't give us anywhere near a large enough cast to throw in the red herrings necessary to mask the identity of Summer's father. That said, once the writers give us the Big Reveal, which comes about halfway through the movie, and they stop trying to build the ineffective mystery, it actually starts getting good, in a twisted, envelope-pushing kind of way that one doesn't normally see in movies that are essentially made for television (while it did play a few festivals, it's essentially a straight-to-DVD flick that got picked up right quick by Chiller).I've seen a few reviews for the movie from gushing fans that I'd have to say go way, way too far. ""...[O]ne of the most deranged, shocking, and twisted family thrillers ever made..."" says the Imagination Films promo material, which makes me wonder if they've ever seen Street Trash or Motel Hell, or, for that matter, that scene in Deliverance from which this sort of thing normally stems. An IMDB reveiwer (who stamps him- or her-self as a Twi-hard from the outset) says s/he ""[will] record it on a disk with Thirteen, Deep Winter, and Lords of Dogtown"". I haven't seen Deep Winter, but I can attest that this is not as bad as the other two.Obviously a must for Twi-hards thanks to the Ashley Greene connection, and Stephen McHattie fans will find his over-the-top performance here enjoyable (I kind of thought of Gant Hoxey as the anti-Grant Mazzey, for those of you who recognize the name). Others will probably find it take-or-leave.

1278307,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B002MJV7JU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","Summer's Moon is a suspense horror movie that starts off with the hot-headed and rebellious young Summer (Ashley Greene, who plays Alice in the ""Twilight"" series) hitch-hiking to the small town of Massie to find the father she never knew.  Well, she finds her blood relatives, but also finds a lot of trouble along the way, stumbling first upon a mentally unbalanced, twisted and incestuous family before later coming to meet her biological father.The insane family isn't in the vein of Leatherface and his clan in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", this is a perfectly normal-looking family at first glance, living in a clean, attractive home not far from town.  It's only when you discover the unsettling relationship between mother and son, and the human additions to the son's 'garden' in the basement, that their true nature becomes apparant.  And then things go from bad to worse when Daddy comes home.Stephen McHattie plays the family patriarch, away from home for long periods of time on business and on other pursuits.  McHattie, as Gant Hoxey, delivers one of the best and most subtly creepy performances as a psychopath that I've ever seen.  As with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, his effectiveness comes largely from the fact that much of the time there's nothing in his demeanor to suggest the violence and horror we know that's in there.  There's a scene of the character in a park, sitting on a bench and sipping a drink, looking perfectly friendly and non-threatening, looking around at the park, noticing the pretty girls around...  But with what we've seen of the character previously, and knowing his less-than-friendly intentions, especially toward the pretty girls, the otherwise benign scene is incredibly intense and disturbing.  The filmmakers take their time with this scene, as they do with a number of spots in the movie where the atmosphere is given time to grow and take on a really eerie feeling.Ashley Greene also does a great job in this, and it's great to see a bit more of her than inTwilight (Two-Disc Special Edition).  The cast in general is good, and the production well-made.  There are little nods to other movies the cast has made - Summer's mother is named 'Twila' and in one part of the movie Summer's even dressed very much like Bella from Twilight!  In a bit more subtle homage, the small town is named Massie, the same as the surname of McHattie's character Grant Massie inPontypool(a criminally underseen gem, by the way).There's one angle in Summer's Moon, very small and subtle, but it adds a whole new possible dimension to the movie.  I'm hesitant on whether to mention it, and am going to put it after my usual spoiler warning.****WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD****As I mentioned, the family house is very nice and clean.  I don't know exactly how to say this, because it's probably better if noticed on one's own (hence the spoiler warning) but it adds such a powerful question to the whole movie.  Put bluntly, when Gant returns home, the number of flies in the house jumps way up.  It's nothing obvious, like in The Amityville Horror where you'd see a whole room swarming with them, but in various scenes in and out of the house, there's discreetly a fly or two buzzing around in the background for a couple seconds when McHattie's character is present or near.  Nothing is commented on this within the movie, and it's so subtle (not All his scenes have them, by any means) that in real life one may never notice it, but given the character and the un-nerving sense of creepiness coming off him (hidden under a very sociable, charismatic exterior), this whole angle has obvious and powerful implications.****END SEMI-SPOILERS******Summer's Moon leaves you with an eerie feeling after the credits have finished rolling, and there are questions that are deliberately left unanswered.  Sometimes it's better not to go and spell everything out neatly in the last five minutes of the movie.  This is one of those cases.  Also known by the title ""Summer's Blood"", this is definately one to get.",4,"Eerie And Suspenseful, With A Unique Atmosphere",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,4052,"['Summer', 'Moon', 'suspense', 'horror', 'movie', 'hot-headed', 'rebellious', 'young', 'Summer', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'who', 'Alice', 'Twilight', 'series', 'hitch-hiking', 'small', 'town', 'Massie', 'find', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'Well', 'blood', 'relatives', 'also', 'lot', 'trouble', 'way', 'stumbling', 'first', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'twisted', 'incestuous', 'family', 'later', 'coming', 'meet', 'biological', 'father.The', 'insane', 'family', ""n't"", 'vein', 'Leatherface', 'clan', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'perfectly', 'normal-looking', 'family', 'first', 'glance', 'living', 'clean', 'attractive', 'home', 'not', 'far', 'town', 'only', 'when', 'discover', 'unsettling', 'relationship', 'mother', 'son', 'human', 'additions', 'son', ""'garden"", 'basement', 'true', 'nature', 'apparant', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'Daddy', 'home.Stephen', 'McHattie', 'family', 'patriarch', 'away', 'home', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'business', 'other', 'pursuits', 'McHattie', 'Gant', 'Hoxey', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'subtly', 'creepy', 'performances', 'psychopath', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'effectiveness', 'largely', 'fact', 'much', 'time', 'nothing', 'demeanor', 'suggest', 'violence', 'horror', 'know', 'there', 'scene', 'character', 'park', 'sitting', 'bench', 'sipping', 'drink', 'looking', 'perfectly', 'friendly', 'non-threatening', 'looking', 'around', 'park', 'noticing', 'pretty', 'girls', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'previously', 'knowing', 'less-than-friendly', 'intentions', 'especially', 'pretty', 'girls', 'otherwise', 'benign', 'scene', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'disturbing', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'time', 'scene', 'do', 'number', 'spots', 'movie', 'where', 'atmosphere', 'given', 'time', 'grow', 'take', 'really', 'eerie', 'feeling.Ashley', 'Greene', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'inTwilight', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'cast', 'general', 'good', 'production', 'well-made', 'are', 'little', 'nods', 'other', 'movies', 'cast', 'made', 'Summer', 'mother', 'named', ""'Twila"", 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'Summer', 'even', 'dressed', 'very', 'much', 'Bella', 'Twilight', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', 'homage', 'small', 'town', 'named', 'Massie', 'same', 'surname', 'McHattie', 'character', 'Grant', 'Massie', 'inPontypool', 'criminally', 'underseen', 'gem', 'way', 'one', 'angle', 'Summer', 'Moon', 'very', 'small', 'subtle', 'whole', 'new', 'possible', 'dimension', 'movie', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'mention', 'am', 'going', 'put', 'usual', 'spoiler', 'warning', '****WARNING', 'POSSIBLE', 'SEMI-SPOILERS', 'AHEAD****As', 'mentioned', 'family', 'house', 'very', 'nice', 'clean', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'say', 'probably', 'better', 'noticed', 'one', 'own', 'hence', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'powerful', 'question', 'whole', 'movie', 'Put', 'bluntly', 'when', 'Gant', 'home', 'number', 'flies', 'house', 'way', 'up', 'nothing', 'obvious', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'where', ""'d"", 'see', 'whole', 'room', 'swarming', 'various', 'scenes', 'house', 'discreetly', 'fly', 'two', 'buzzing', 'around', 'background', 'couple', 'when', 'McHattie', 'character', 'present', 'near', 'Nothing', 'commented', 'movie', 'so', 'subtle', 'not', 'scenes', 'have', 'means', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'may', 'never', 'notice', 'given', 'character', 'un-nerving', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'coming', 'off', 'hidden', 'very', 'sociable', 'charismatic', 'exterior', 'whole', 'angle', 'obvious', 'powerful', 'implications', '****END', 'SEMI-SPOILERS******Summer', 'Moon', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling', 'are', 'questions', 'are', 'deliberately', 'left', 'unanswered', 'better', 'not', 'go', 'spell', 'everything', 'out', 'neatly', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'one', 'cases', 'Also', 'known', 'title', 'Summer', 'Blood', 'definately', 'one', 'get']",N/A
