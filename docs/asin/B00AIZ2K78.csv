1612223,AXIGQAWNY8NX4,B00AIZ2K78,Michael Thomas,"[4, 10]",This just goes over old ground nothing new. There was a much better show about Bobbie and Ethel on PBS in the mid- ninties. It is dishearting to hear that Ethel allowed one of her daughters to go 4 days with a broken leg before she took her to the hospital to get the leg set. I wish they would have used people outside of the children to give a richer view of Ethel. She has accomplished so much more than this show gives her credit for. I would have liked to have heard more about what Ethel has accomplished AFTER Bobbie was gone. Roey did NOT do her mother credit with this DVD.
