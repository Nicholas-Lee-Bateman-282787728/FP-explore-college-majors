1624320,A37MYXJR68QO11,B00BC0JH24,Cheri w.,"[18, 22]","What a wonderful, wholesome family show.  Real life lessons in a wonderful family setting.  But like so many shows that are worth watching and great for the whole family it was pulled and replaced with a show of violence and mayhem.  Seems the world is more interested in violence, nudity and non family values.  What a shame,but when you take God out of the equation that is what happens.  I hope a network re looks at this series and brings it back to finish it in the right way.  We need more good family programming.",5,So disappointed!,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,520,"['What', 'wonderful', 'wholesome', 'family', 'show', 'Real', 'life', 'lessons', 'wonderful', 'family', 'setting', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'pulled', 'replaced', 'show', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'world', 'more', 'interested', 'violence', 'nudity', 'non', 'family', 'values', 'What', 'shame', 'when', 'take', 'God', 'equation', 'what', 'hope', 'network', 're', 'series', 'back', 'finish', 'right', 'way', 'need', 'more', 'good', 'family', 'programming']",Legacy: The Complete Series

1624327,A386II5JPHOQOX,B00BC0JH24,"Robert W. Moses ""Caladan""","[0, 0]","I just finished the 18th episode and LOVED it!  I had fallen away from TV due to the garbage on TV these days. This is the kind of show that I want to see.  Much like Little House and Love Comes Softly, it was a heart warming story that promoted good Christian ethics and connected you with the characters. Today's shows are soulless, evil, shallow, and demeaning to viewer's intelligence.  By pulling Legacy, the TV execs have strengthened my already considerable  contempt for them and the crap they are trying to force feed us viewers.  Most evenings, if I bother with TV at all, I find myself watching &#34;How It's Made&#34; or the History channel or even more often, resorting to a good book to avoid the sickening, shallow crap masquerading as &#34;entertainment&#34; on TV today.One other big gripe I have is the annoying advertising imposing on the program that ruins the show.  It is as if they insist on rubbing their crap in our faces trying to force us to watch what they deem as entertainment.  Can you tell that I am growing increasingly angry at the idiots who control what's on TV these days?  My disgust is growing stronger, so much so that most evenings I find I am avoiding TV altogether. When will the misguided powers that control TV shows get a clue and realize they are losing their audience?",5,Another great family show replaced by junk,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,1316,"['just', 'finished', '18th', 'episode', 'LOVED', 'had', 'fallen', 'away', 'TV', 'due', 'garbage', 'TV', 'days', 'kind', 'show', 'want', 'see', 'Much', 'Little', 'House', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'was', 'heart', 'warming', 'story', 'promoted', 'good', 'Christian', 'ethics', 'connected', 'characters', 'Today', 'shows', 'are', 'soulless', 'evil', 'shallow', 'demeaning', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'pulling', 'Legacy', 'TV', 'execs', 'have', 'strengthened', 'already', 'considerable', 'contempt', 'crap', 'are', 'trying', 'force', 'feed', 'viewers', 'Most', 'evenings', 'bother', 'TV', 'find', 'watching', '34', 'How', 'Made', '34', 'History', 'channel', 'even', 'more', 'often', 'resorting', 'good', 'book', 'avoid', 'sickening', 'shallow', 'crap', 'masquerading', '34', 'entertainment', '34', 'TV', 'today.One', 'other', 'big', 'gripe', 'have', 'annoying', 'advertising', 'imposing', 'program', 'show', 'insist', 'rubbing', 'crap', 'trying', 'force', 'watch', 'what', 'deem', 'entertainment', 'Can', 'tell', 'am', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'angry', 'idiots', 'who', 'control', 'what', 'TV', 'days', 'disgust', 'growing', 'stronger', 'so', 'much', 'most', 'evenings', 'find', 'am', 'avoiding', 'TV', 'altogether', 'When', 'will', 'misguided', 'powers', 'control', 'TV', 'shows', 'get', 'clue', 'realize', 'are', 'losing', 'audience']",Legacy: The Complete Series
