1303056,AAZRWLML88IZK,B002ZG97LK,A kids review,"[0, 0]","Yeah, I know; I was thinking it too: ""A Footloose remake? Why?"" If there was any saving grace to the idea, it was that the film was to be helmed by the man who brought us Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan, two movies steeped in the music and culture of the American South. As it turns out, much to the surprise of moviegoers who initially balked at the remake, Craig Brewer's updated Footloose isn't half bad. Following cues from the original film relatively closely -- with a few tweaks -- the story revolves around a big city high schooler who moves to a small, conservative Southern town where, due to a past teenage tragedy, loud music and public dancing have been outlawed. Throw in a star-crossed romance with the local reverend's rebellious daughter, and you're looking at a pretty faithful remake. I felt that Brewer did a respectable job both paying homage to the original film and updating the story for a new generation, infusing Footloose with the same kind of energy he harnessed for his previous films. This probably won't blow your socks off, but it may surprise you.",3,Footloose,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1083,"['Yeah', 'know', 'was', 'thinking', 'too', 'Footloose', 'remake', 'Why', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'idea', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'helmed', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'two', 'movies', 'steeped', 'music', 'culture', 'American', 'South', 'out', 'much', 'surprise', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'initially', 'balked', 'remake', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'updated', 'Footloose', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'Following', 'cues', 'original', 'film', 'relatively', 'closely', 'few', 'tweaks', 'story', 'around', 'big', 'city', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'small', 'conservative', 'Southern', 'town', 'where', 'due', 'past', 'teenage', 'tragedy', 'loud', 'music', 'public', 'dancing', 'have', 'been', 'outlawed', 'Throw', 'star-crossed', 'romance', 'local', 'reverend', 'rebellious', 'daughter', ""'re"", 'looking', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'remake', 'felt', 'Brewer', 'did', 'respectable', 'job', 'paying', 'homage', 'original', 'film', 'updating', 'story', 'new', 'generation', 'infusing', 'Footloose', 'same', 'kind', 'energy', 'harnessed', 'previous', 'films', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'socks', 'off', 'may', 'surprise']",N/A
1303057,A14N5L5T089VX3,B002ZG97LK,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[2, 5]","When I saw the MTV Films Logo flash across the screen in the Theatre, I settled back, knowing I was in for a good film, since similar films MTV has produced in the past with similar themes, such asA Walk to Rememberwith Mandy Moore, have been fabulous - but I was wrong.While this remake has much in common with the original 1984 production, it just isn't as well done.  I did not find the dancing scenes to be as compelling, for the most part, and there were quite a few scenes and themes inserted into this film that had no reason for being there, or which were clumsily handled.  The bus-demolition derby scene, in particular, has a bit where the lead character, Ren asks himself ""What have I gotten myself into?"" - and we're left wondering the same thing.Even so, most of the acting was really well done.  The real scene stealer, as others have noted, is Miles Teller, who plays Ren's gawky, awkward pal, and we have wonderful performances from many of the other actors in this production, both young and old, particularly  Andie MacDowell (best known for appearing opposite Bill Murray in Groundhog Day), Dennis Quaid (as her husband, the preacher) and Ray McKinnon (as Ren's Uncle).Yet, the producers of this film throw lots of stuff at you without thought for how to make sure it makes sense to the audience.  Each scene needs to build on what has come before, there needs to be coherence and some sort of natural flow from one scene to the next.  You do not want to leave the audience wondering ""why did he (or she) do that?""  So, despite the excellent acting, some good dance scenes, the production as a whole is poor due to poor directing and especially bad editing.  I'll give the film two stars - worth buying when you find it as ""closeout"", and OK to watch as a streaming rental on a night when you have nothing else to do, but not worth seeing in the Theatres, nor worth paying full price to own.",2,The whole is less than the sum of the parts,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,1910,"['When', 'saw', 'MTV', 'Films', 'Logo', 'flash', 'screen', 'Theatre', 'settled', 'back', 'knowing', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'similar', 'films', 'MTV', 'produced', 'past', 'similar', 'themes', 'such', 'asA', 'Walk', 'Rememberwith', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'have', 'been', 'fabulous', 'was', 'remake', 'much', 'common', 'original', '1984', 'production', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'done', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'be', 'compelling', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'themes', 'inserted', 'film', 'had', 'reason', 'being', 'there', 'were', 'clumsily', 'handled', 'bus-demolition', 'derby', 'scene', 'particular', 'bit', 'where', 'lead', 'character', 'Ren', 'What', 'have', 'gotten', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'same', 'thing.Even', 'so', 'most', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'who', 'Ren', 'gawky', 'awkward', 'pal', 'have', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'production', 'young', 'old', 'particularly', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'best', 'known', 'appearing', 'opposite', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'husband', 'preacher', 'Ray', 'McKinnon', 'Ren', 'Uncle', '.Yet', 'producers', 'film', 'throw', 'lots', 'stuff', 'thought', 'how', 'make', 'sure', 'sense', 'audience', 'scene', 'build', 'come', 'before', 'be', 'coherence', 'sort', 'natural', 'flow', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'audience', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'So', 'excellent', 'acting', 'good', 'dance', 'scenes', 'production', 'whole', 'poor', 'due', 'poor', 'directing', 'especially', 'bad', 'editing', ""'ll"", 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'worth', 'buying', 'when', 'find', 'closeout', 'OK', 'watch', 'streaming', 'rental', 'night', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Theatres', 'worth', 'paying', 'full', 'price', 'own']",N/A

1303065,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG97LK,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 11]","I'm not sure why I decided to see this.  I have not seen the original (avoid the Bacon at all costs) yet somehow this remake wound up on my Netflix queue and before I could stop it, they were shipping it to my house.  My wife was excited.  She loves dancing.  I do too, but there was something about this that seemed so `wrong' to me; so much so that I was heavily opposed to us watching it.We watched it.There is so much wrong with `Footloose' that I'm not even sure where to begin.  The basic premise is that a town, stricken with tragedy, goes overboard in an attempt to preserve the lives of their youth and actually bans public dancing unless supervised and orchestrated by adults (like a school dance observed by the Minister who enforces a rule that forbids dancing closer than six inches apart).  The Minister's young and tramplike daughter rebels, dates an older guy and dances in the parking lot of a local diner when the police aren't patrolling.  An outsider with a heart of gold comes to town, is picked on by locals, given a bad wrap and eventually falls for the Minister's daughter and together they fight for their right to dance.Seriously.The fact that nothing in `Footloose' makes sense ultimately becomes the film's biggest downfall.  I mean, it's enough that the town bans dancing, which is somewhat ludicrous, but the way the dance scenes are staged are ridiculous (the music blaring at a popular diner in a small town and thought to be unnoticeable when a cop literally pulled out of the parking lot not thirty seconds before the owner popped in the CD) and the music selected, while paying homage to the original film, also made no sense.  I'm sorry, but the song `Footloose' just isn't cool anymore, no matter who is singing it.  The acting is horrendous and the plotting is filled to the brim with holes that are puttied over with obvious clich&eacute;s.Yes, Dennis Quaid sells his speeches, but outside of that the film is a bit `WTF'.I also found it quite humorous that Andie MacDowell gives some ""I've been silent"" speech towards the end and I was thinking to myself, `I totally forgot you were in this'...i.e.; she was right.  Kenny Wormald can't act, but he can dance; although I must say that this film tries far too hard to emulate the latest trend in `Step Up' films and fails rather drastically because the integration of country music into this breed of film doesn't come off as `inspired' as they wanted it to.  The dancing numbers become repetitive and lack any real charisma (all fake, plastic, manufactured).  Mile Teller is kind of hilarious and deserves props for having to spit out some of the most ridiculously clich&eacute;d and stereotypical jargon I've heard in a feature film lately.  After watching him devastate in 2010's `Rabbit Hole', I was hoping he'd get a big break.  Maybe this was it.  Maybe now he can move on to more fare similar to `Rabbit Hole'.Oh, and Wormald's dance freakout in the mill is completely OTT and utterly hilarious; which was not the intent.",1,Screwloose...,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3016,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'decided', 'see', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Bacon', 'costs', 'yet', 'somehow', 'remake', 'wound', 'up', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'could', 'stop', 'were', 'shipping', 'house', 'wife', 'was', 'excited', 'dancing', 'do', 'too', 'was', 'something', 'seemed', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'heavily', 'opposed', 'watching', 'it.We', 'watched', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'Footloose', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'where', 'begin', 'basic', 'premise', 'town', 'stricken', 'tragedy', 'overboard', 'attempt', 'preserve', 'lives', 'youth', 'actually', 'public', 'dancing', 'supervised', 'orchestrated', 'adults', 'school', 'dance', 'observed', 'Minister', 'who', 'rule', 'dancing', 'closer', 'six', 'inches', 'apart', 'Minister', 'young', 'tramplike', 'daughter', 'rebels', 'older', 'guy', 'dances', 'parking', 'lot', 'local', 'diner', 'when', 'police', 'are', ""n't"", 'patrolling', 'outsider', 'heart', 'gold', 'town', 'picked', 'locals', 'given', 'bad', 'wrap', 'eventually', 'Minister', 'daughter', 'together', 'fight', 'right', 'dance.Seriously.The', 'fact', 'nothing', 'Footloose', 'sense', 'ultimately', 'film', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'mean', 'enough', 'town', 'dancing', 'somewhat', 'ludicrous', 'way', 'dance', 'scenes', 'are', 'staged', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'music', 'blaring', 'popular', 'diner', 'small', 'town', 'thought', 'be', 'unnoticeable', 'when', 'cop', 'literally', 'pulled', 'parking', 'lot', 'not', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'owner', 'popped', 'CD', 'music', 'selected', 'paying', 'homage', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'sense', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'song', 'Footloose', 'just', ""n't"", 'cool', 'anymore', 'matter', 'who', 'singing', 'acting', 'horrendous', 'plotting', 'filled', 'brim', 'holes', 'are', 'puttied', 'obvious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'speeches', 'film', 'bit', ""WTF'.I"", 'also', 'found', 'quite', 'humorous', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'silent', 'speech', 'end', 'was', 'thinking', 'totally', 'forgot', 'were', 'i.e', 'was', 'right', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'can', 'dance', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'emulate', 'latest', 'trend', 'Step', 'Up', 'films', 'rather', 'drastically', 'integration', 'country', 'music', 'breed', 'film', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'inspired', 'wanted', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'become', 'repetitive', 'lack', 'real', 'charisma', 'fake', 'plastic', 'manufactured', 'Mile', 'Teller', 'kind', 'hilarious', 'props', 'having', 'spit', 'out', 'most', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'stereotypical', 'jargon', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'feature', 'film', 'lately', 'watching', 'devastate', '2010', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'get', 'big', 'break', 'Maybe', 'was', 'Maybe', 'now', 'can', 'move', 'more', 'fare', 'similar', 'Rabbit', ""Hole'.Oh"", 'Wormald', 'dance', 'freakout', 'mill', 'completely', 'OTT', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'was', 'not', 'intent']",N/A

1303067,ADMTH3K9CRS9S,B002ZG97LK,Arik &quot;The 109th Star of Destiny&quot;,"[4, 8]","First off,  I have a couple disclaimers just to clear things up.Number One--I grew up in the eighties and Footloose was one of my favorite movies it was right up there with Breakfast Club and Top Gun. But also realize I enjoyed motion pictures like Children of a Lesser God as well. With that said, I tried to go in to this movie with an open mind and unbiased in anyway, whether or not I was successful read on and decide for yourself.Number Two--I am by no means an accomplished critic in anyway,  it's very hard for me to find a movie I don't take joy in watching. After all, I am a movie geek, love movies, and watch everything I can get my hands on from raucous comedies to critically acclaimed to foreign films, and even some anime and an emerging new genre like FFVII: Advent Children and others in this type of film medium. I do have a minor in film studies from Wichita State University, but these are my only credentials. With these things said, read further if you would like to know my opinion of the Footloose remake.In the ""It's our Time"" Footloose remake, it is far from its time because the hits are far outnumbered by the misses. I wish I could start and end on positive notes, there just wasn't much positive in this movie. I will cover the short list of hits in the movie first. If casting on looks alone were the only criteria for a good movie remake then this is a perfect movie all of the main characters seem to mimic the looks of the original cast; except for the changing of nationality of some of the characters, and Dennis Quaid doesn't resemble John Lithgow in any way.I like the rewrites of the script where it concerns Ren's, aunt's husband. This was a nice attempt and a good hit. And the actor portraying him I believe gave one of the best, if not the best performance in the movie. I also like the reason Ren came to Bomont to live with his aunt, though it's true motives and potential falls way short, oh sorry, this is supposed to be the positives. The beginning and it's connecting parts throughout the film did its job in explaining the town a little, but not by much. The dance scenes were okay for the most part although most reminded me of the original more than being original themselves. Let's see, anything else...The actor playing Willard made me think of Sean Penn the whole time, nonetheless he did okay in his performance, as good as any of the other's except of course for the aunt's husband. Beyond these few things, there wasn't much else good about the movie.And now for the misses, but there are so many, I do not know where to begin, so I will try and stick to fim criteria such as music, acting, script, and the like. First off, and I know this is my bias, the remakes of two of the more important songs in the movie were done horribly, not to mention leaving off the song from Ren's dance scene in the saw mill in the original; or if they used the same song it was done so horribly I didn't recognize it. Remaking a rock song into a ballad was the worst travasity I think. I could see changing it to a ballad if it was an emotional scene but it wasn't or if it was supposed to be, it fell short by far. And the remake of the love ballad at the end, it was so bad that I took the time to run to the restroom while it was playing. But I do apologize for being so harsh because I know music is subjective.As for the acting and performances, as I said the only really memorable role was that of the aunt's husband. I saw very little chemistry between the Ren and Arielle character, but the friendship between Willard and Ren was done better I think, but this was by no means The actor who played Ren's doing, it was the actor playing Willard. Again Andie McDowell's role as Val Moore was given very little screen time at all, and this was probably the director's fault, I think Val should play a bigger role in the film. I say this mainly because one of the reason's I wanted to see it was because Dennis Quaid was cast as the Reverend. And I was very disappointed in his performance, in fact, it was subpar for any actor with his experience, but again this may not have been Mr. Quaid's fault. And it is hard to follow a performance like John Lithgow's was in the original film. Is there anything else about the acting??? Nothing that stands out.The script...the main script was pretty much identical to the original, almost. The script tempted to add a few things and those things for the most part would have been excellent if they had been done properly. As I said in the positive's the relationship between Ren and his aunt's husband was a little better developed and I like the idea of him supporting instead of not as he did in the first one. I like the added dimension of why Ren ended up in Bomont, but it really was followed through haphazardly. Yes there was a lot of mention of it, but the actor portraying Ren didn't convey that much except for in the dance sequence in the abandoned building. The father-daughter relationship between Arielle and the reverend was done so much better in the original, and only one of the changes was a near hit, but ultimately failed because it lacked the emotion of the original. As I mentioned before Willard's and Ren's friendship was done better as well. I could pick this near exact cover of the script to death so I won't. I will just mention that the catch phrase for the movie and all over the poster's, `It's our Time', could have given this movie much more praise and power, but we never really see anything about it until the last few scenes of the movie. So don't let the phrase seduce you into watching the movie, because I believe you will be sorely disappointed. I would wait until it reaches DVD to watch it, but probably not even then. I was going to add it to my amazon wish list as soon as it was available. But now I don't think I will, and I feel it may well end up on the shelf way sooner than MTV wants it too.In closing, if I as a freelance writer were commissioned to do another remake of the motion picture Footloose, I would probably piece together the best parts of both scripts and focus a little more on the relationships of the characters and keep the original music the way it was. Then look to the stars in the midnight sky and hope I could find actors and actresses that could convey the best  performances of the two motion pictures combined...Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, Andie McDowell, and those actors playing Willard and the aunt's husband in the remake...and there could be the potential to leave a lasting impression like August Rush, Music & Lyrics, Save the Last Dance, and Top Gun.Well I hope this helps those who were wavering on whether or not to go see the movie in their decision-making. For those who loved the movie, I am sorry if I offended you, but if you really look within and maybe even compare the old and new songs one after the other, then you may begin to understand why I only gave this remake one star.  Until my next review, do yourself a favor and go take in a motion picture this weekend and suspend your disbelief for a couple hours, it may change the world, but if not the world; at the very least, it may change you just a little bit.",1,It's Our Time Footloose remake should never have been made,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,7210,"['First', 'have', 'couple', 'disclaimers', 'just', 'clear',

Beginning the film with an actual dance was ingenious, and showing us the tragic accident immediately created the climate for the town of Bomont's overprotective atmosphere.The director paid just the right amount of homage to the original with the use of the car, the red boots, and the similarity in the dance party attire.  The change in the mother's history in the new movie added to Ren's character arc.  Also, the new choreography, especially Ren's warehouse number, really made it surprising and exciting.I wasn't the least bit disappointed at the script changes and was, in fact, impressed at how the writers were able to update the dialogue to make it more believable.

1303084,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG97LK,Chris Kennison,"[2, 4]","Controversy always surrounds movies when it comes to remakes. Should ""Footloose"" have been made? Should ""Psycho"" have been remade? Absolutely not. ""Footloose"" though? Why not? The original is very dated and the elements that made the original ""Footloose"" so popular are still as timely and relevant today. It's the music and dancing that brought people to the cinemas back in 1984 for the original ""Footloose"" and today, movies like ""Step Up"", ""Save the Last Dance"" ""Stomp the Yard"" and ""Burlesque"" are just as popular. Yet ""Footloose"" seemed to rise to the top and has been touted as a classic, as far as dance movies go.The new version of ""Footloose"" does a lot of things right and I would even go as far as to say that it takes absolutely nothing away from the original movie. They took some liberties with some scenes, putting their own twist on them. Most of the scenes are nearly identical. The script is nearly identical with the exception of the opening minutes that show the audience why the town of Bowmont has banned dancing and other things. Personally, I don't think this adds to the movie at all though. Since the main protagonist is Ren MacCormack, played by Kenny Worwald, a character who is new to the town and doesn't know these people anyway. I think not knowing the victims of the tragedy that caused the law against dancing makes more sense, and adds to the questioning of why the law exists in the first place.Many of the scenes are too choreographed and those scenes take away from the realism and looking glass feel you should get from a movie. For instance, in the new version, the caf&eacute; scene where the minister catches his daughter dancing is a full on blow out, up-in-the-club moment with choreographed craziness. It wasn't realistic and was way overblown. This wasn't always the case. Many of the revamped scenes are well done and much of the music has either been retooled or reused.One of the more popular dance numbers in the original movie is when Wren blows off some steam in the warehouse to the song ""Never"". In the new version, the dance choreographer is preserved to a miserable, strange song that doesn't have near the moxie that ""Never"" did. Most of the songs are good enough to be memorable though, and Willard learning to dance to the song ""Let's Hear it for the Boys"" is one of the best scenes in the movie.The biggest surprise of the movie though was the acting ability of Julianne Hough, who plays Ariel Moore, the preacher's daughter. Hough rose to fame as a dancer on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""Footloose"" is only her second movie. She did her part great justice, especially for someone who is a virtual novice. Miles Teller (Rabbit Hole), who plays Willard, also did a great job in only his second movie. In fact, he steals the show in many ways.""Footloose"" is a good movie.

1303100,A3L753EAJUYWHR,B002ZG97LK,"D. Leon ""A reader""","[8, 13]","I went into this movie really hoping they would do right by the original, which is a fine movie. After seeing the remake, it's very clear just how fine the original was. The remake failed to capture any of the spirit, youthful exuberance, or sincerity of the first one.The script was the first problem. Very surprising since Dean Pitchford co-wrote it, and wrote the original. In his attempt to make the script more contemporary and relatable, he wrote out all the genuine emotion. Everything was explained to the point of hitting the audience over the head. Just one case in point: we start out by going straight to the fun toe-tapper of a theme song, everyone dancing, and a few seconds later BAM...we get emotionally jerked out of the feel-good fun time of hearing that nostalgic song and into the contrived sadness of Bobby's death, which paints too plain a picture of why Ariel is so rebellious and messed up. In the original, one simple conversation as they drive over the bridge after the night at the club, and Lori Singer's Ariel reacting to telling the story of Bobby's death was all we needed to feel her pain, and to finally understand, at the same moment Ren does, why she is the way she is. It was much more genuine and packed a much greater emotional punch than the remake's overly sappy church scene when Reverend Moore pours his heart out to the congregation. The bridge conversation just feels like overkill by that point.The characters were also much more one-note and two-dimensional that the original characters. Julianne Hough's Ariel was just a little naughty and self-destructive. Lori Singer's Ariel was borderline crazy. You could see clearly that something very serious ailed her soul. Not so with Hough's Ariel. Even when the script again hits us over the head by having her tearfully come out and say ""I've been losing my mind"" you don't quite believe her in the way you knew Singer's Ariel was losing her mind, and she never even had to say a direct word about it. Ren's uncle was more like the mill boss in the original, and Ren's mom is gone altogether. Reverend Moore and his wife, Vi, portrayed by Dennis Quaid and Andie McDowell this time around, also felt flat and one-note. This seemed to be in part the way the characters were written, and in part how they were portrayed. Quaid and McDowell are fine, competent actors, but they simply cannot hold a candle to John Lithgow and the sublime Diane Wiest. McDowell's Vi betrays her own basic nature by shouting to get attention for Ren at the town hall meeting. But Wiest maintains Vi's quiet restraint and tendency toward deference in how she simply, and quietly says ""Eleanor, sit down."" And achieves even more impact than McDowell's out of character shouting. Likewise Quaid's Shaw Moore only had one level, barely  maintaining a calm and trying to hold things together. We never really see him struggle with the inner turmoil that Lithgow made so clear, and we never really see Qauid's Shaw smile. When he slaps Ariel, we don't really see what built up to lead him to do such a thing, and the fact that he does it when she is fresh from the beating by the bad ex boyfriend makes Quaid's Shaw far less sympathetic and relatable. Lithgow's Shaw never even found out about Ariel's run-in with Chuck, greater illustrating the chasm between daughter and parents. When Lithgow's Shaw smacks Ariel at the breakfast table in the original, we have a better understanding of why, and the tension between all three family members is much more palpable. In the conversation that follows, we can see Vi means the praise she gives Shaw, and in the same moment, when she says ""but it's the one on on where you need a little work"" we see her anger and frustration as well. Lithgow's and Wiest's performances made Shaw and Vi real, human and three-dimensional in a way Quaid and McDowell didn't even touch.There was also very little if any exposition as to why the whole town put their youth on lockdown after the accident.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[48, 57]","From Tom Cruise getting down in his tighty whiteys in ""Risky Business"" to Jennifer Grey having the time of her life in ""Dirty Dancing"", eighties movies were filled with great moments involving dancing.  They were one of a kind, and can't be recreated with the same impact.  If you asked me before I saw the reviews, I would have said that the cinematic world did not need a remake of ""Footloose.""  Mainly, because I can't think of a remake of an eighties' film that bettered the original. In this case, I've only seen bits of the original, so I thought this was pretty good.The plot is the same as the `84 version.  When a group of teens are killed in a drunk driving accident, the minister (Dennis Quaid) whose son has also died, and the town officials ban virtually everything teens do for recreation, including dancing. (Drag racing busses aflame, does get a pass.) Three years later, Bobby's younger sister, Ariel, played by Julianne Hough, is busy doing everything that's been banned and not caring if she's caught.  She also has the requisite bad boy older boyfriend, who doesn't respect her.  Naturally, she's a perfect match for new kid in town Ren (Kenny Wormald reprising the Kevin Bacon role), who's moved in with his uncle's family, following the death of his mom from cancer.  Ren is a good kid, but after a series of run-ins with the local authorities, he decides to cut loose, kick off his Sunday shoes and with his new friends, get the ban on dancing revoked.The lead does a good job, but if you ask me, Miles Teller, playing Ren's pal who must overcome his fears of being a ""dancing dork"" stole the show.

I never thought I'd say this, but I will now:  the original and the remake are like apples and oranges; I like'em both, each in their own way.  The young leads, Kenny Wormald (who landed the role of ""Ren,"" apparently after a lot of actor shuffling, including Zac Efron, who was originally cast as Ren) and Julianne Hough (""Ariel"") are good and energetic, but the real find here is the charismatic Miles Teller as Ren's buddy ""Willard"" (played by the late Chris Penn in the original), so one can't help but wonder what he might have been like as Ren instead (just a thought).  Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell are also very welcome in their parental supporting roles and are like getting a warm hug from the 80s.  Of course, if you've seen the original a hundred times, like me, there were no surprises in the plot (being a remake, though, maybe that unnecessary fight sequence at the end could have been edited out, especially since the movie was about 15 minutes too long), but those very familiar-looking scenes (almost shot for shot), including surprisingly effective father-daughter scenes between Quaid and Hough (""Daddy, guess what? We're dancing""), bring back some great memories, from the original and from the 80s in general.  Not sure the current teen crowd will go for it, with perhaps some slightly dated sequences, but this movie, I'll now admit, ultimately won me over.",4,"Did we really need a ""Footloose"" reboot?

Now let's see if this sweet-spirited version (which duplicates many of the original scenes verbatim!) will do the same for our new Ren McCormack. Based on the DVD available from Amazon, I think it might.* Kenny Wormald (""Center Stage: Turn It Up"") is Ren, who, after his mother died, was transplanted from Boston to this podunk town out in the hinterlands of Texas, where his love of dancing hits a stone wall. Wormald is a former backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, who recommended him for this role. Good call, Justin!* Dennis Quaid (""Vantage Point"") is Reverend Moore, the grieving minister who had a town ordinance passed that outlawed dancing three years ago after five teenagers were killed, including his boy.* Julianne Hough (""Dancing With the Stars"") is Ariel, the minister's daughter, rebellious and in pain because her father's sole focus is on his dead son and not on his living daughter.* Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"") is Vi, the minister's wife. Her job is to referee the battles between her husband and their daughter and to provide another point of view when it's needed ...which is fairly often.* Ray McKinnon (""The Blind Side"") surprised me as Ren's Uncle Wes, because this gawky hick turned out to be fair, supportive and wise. I'm always shocked when I have to revise my expectations of a character that are based on a few prejudices of my own.* Miles Teller is a revelation! That sad, bewildered teenager from ""Rabbit Hole"" is the guy Ren and his nieces teach to dance. He's funny and (eventually) he really dances in a highly entertaining montage; I always like to watch someone master a new skill.Of course you have the usual coterie of chums and high-school faculty, plus members of that well-meaning town council, so there are many capable actors who get to strut their stuff. The line dancing is enjoyable, but the grudge race using school buses left me cold.I'm glad the film starts with that horrific wreck, it's a great illustration of the hazards of drinking and driving! I appreciate the clean-shaven look of the principal players - only the bad guys are scruffy. This version, like the first, does NOT devolve into an anti-religious screed, but instead respects the convictions of the principals, e.g., Ren uses the Old Testament in his petition to the city council.This film is PG-13, so you'll hear a smattering of profanity and see the promise of nudity, but not the real thing. No gunshots or blowie uppie stuff, but you DO see what a reckless wench Ariel has become.

Pluntze, Jr. ""pluntze2001""","[1, 4]","No film I've seen so far in 2012 -- neither in a movie theater, nor on DVD -- has proven to be a BIGGER and BETTER surprise for me that 2011's ""Footloose"" ... a terrific (and terrifically-entertaining) remake of one of my LEAST favorite movies of the 1980s (one of many that came out back then where the film's soundtrack evidently had been written longgggg before anyone gave ANY thought whatsoever to constructing an even remotely-plausible movie plot that very same much-ballyhooed soundtrack might sorta-kinda ""fit into"", and/or a plot that otherwise resonated with even a modicum of genuine emotion).What co-writer/director Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow"", ""Black Snake Moan"") has done here is basically re-invent/re-think the original ""Footloose"" from the ground, up -- providing, among many other things, a very understandable, plausible and empathetic reason now why the father-preacher character in ""Footloose"" (John Lithgow in the original; a much-better Dennis Quaid in the remake) does what he does.In the original, Lithgow's character came across as a verrry thinly-veiled, self-serving loon ... someone who was simply ""deranged"" because he A) Believes in God, and B) Has banned dancing, live music, etc, throughout the small town where the ""Footloose"" characters live.Conversely, in this 2011 version, we know almost immediately what has happened to both this town in general, and to Quaid's character in particular -- boy, do we EVER!! -- so pretty much EVERYTHING that follows that admittedly-horrific event does, for the most part, make sense (psychologically, emotionally, politically, etc).Add to that the fact that the main couple in the movie (Lori Singer and Kevin Bacon in the original; Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald in the remake) are now a MUCH more compelling, interesting, well-developed and well-rounded couple than they ever were in the mostly-forgettable 1980s version.Hough and Wormald are also, arguably, CONSIDERABLY BETTER dancers, too (than either Bacon or Singer were), having won much-deserved accolades on numerous appearances of ""Dancing With the Stars"" over a five-year period -- among other very impressive professional-dancing credentials.Plus, the music arrangements the filmmakers have done here with the songs from the original's soundtrack are nothing short of astonishing -- with special kudos to 15-year-old, North Carolina native ELLA MAE BOWEN (whose hauntingly-beautiful and wonderfully-quiet rendition of ""We Need a Hero Now"" is a real improvement in many ways, I think, over the obnoxiously-loud/pulsing Bonnie Tyler version that was featured in the first ""Footloose"").(Bowen has a number of superb musical performances on YouTube that you may want to look up asap).Faith-based and character-driven movies -- and 2011's ""Footloose"" is NOTHING if not THAT -- may not have had any place in mainstream Hollywood productions back in the 1980s, but thankfully they seem to have one now. And this constantly-surprising remake is proof-positive that you actually CAN have a father character in a film who genuinely DOES care about his daughter and who isn't merely an unceasingly-cartoonish/bufoonish, Bible-thumping caricature of one.""Footloose"" (2011) is  movie with a lot of heart, soul, and wisdom in it.

The acting by the lead guy wasn't as good as Kevin Bacon was in the original, but then again Kevin Bacon became a big star and I can't remember the name of the guy in this.  Although I did hear that his main career is actually dancing, not acting.  He is an amazing dancer and its worth watching this for that.  However, the movie wasn't exciting enough to keep it afloat beyond the dancing.  I don't know how many towns ban dancing in America in this day and age.  It may seem outlandish for some to fathom while watching this.  Clearly you'd need to keep the suspension of disbelief.  Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the dad of one of the teen girls and seems to be the only cast member who is a gifted actor.  His wife is played by Andie MacDowell in a pointless role proving that in Hollywood once you reach a certain age you have to take these little thankless Mother roles just to keep working.

Not only that, the blaring of music as you drive your car along a country road can get you fined.  He butts heads with police, preacher, and headmaster soon after.  He meets the attractive rebellious yet troubled preachers daughter, Ariel, played by Julianne Hough who blanks him.Somewhere in town highschoolers can go and blare some music, but before long the authorities appear.  Ren dances and catches the eye of Ariel.  Her brother died in the accident, messing her up, and she acts out, thrillseeking, dangerously self destructive, she dates the local bad boy.  As the attraction grows, conflicts arise with both the preacher, and the bad boy.  Will Ren get her?  Will she change her ways?  Will they do the mambo?  If you're like me these are some of the questions that run through your mind as you watch this movie.You have to watch the movie to find out.  Not having previously seen the original Footloose, I was curious to see this because of Julianne Hough, who has won twice on Dancing with the stars, and is a world champion ballroom dancer.  Kenny Wormald I had not heard of before.  He has danced professionally with some of the world's top entertainers such as Justin Timberlake, and I believe Mariah Carey.  I found his performance in his first leading role engaging, and clearly he has great dance skills.  Somewhat to my surprise I was impressed by the acting performance of Julianne Hough, she delivers in the several great emotional scenes this movie offers, particularly when she gets slapped.  I knew she could dance, and I did not recognise her in Burlesque, because she wore a brunette wig, but I think she could have a decent career as a leading movie actress.  Beyond her obvious appeal, she has some depth.In some respects this is better than the original, particularly the storytelling, which includes the inciting incident of the accident at the beginning, and some of the dancing particularly by Kenny Wormald and others were very good.  What surprised me given the talent of Hough is that she was underused in a dancing capacity, and had no solo to speak of.In some respects the original is better, particularly the depth of acting talent, which includes well known actors such as John Lithgow, and Dianne Wiest, as the preacher and his wife, whose characters were three dimensional, Kevin Bacon, of course, Sarah Jessica Parker in a supporting role as Ariel's friend, and a scene stealing Christopher Penn, Sean Penn's brother.The best known actors in the new version are Dennis Quaid, and Angie McDowell, yet somehow the director played down the role of these characters so that they are one dimensional.I think most people will enjoy both versions, with a new movie updated soundtrack with new artists.  I think the remake was worthwhile, because this version will appeal to a new generation that was not even alive when the first movie was made.  I think though we are seeing too many remakes this year.If you want to watch another dance movie,  I recommendThe Red Shoes - Criterion Collection, one of the greatest dance movies ever made.",5,Better than you might imagine,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,3352,"['Sunday', 'shoes', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'tiresome', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'week', 'long.Ren', 'McCarthy', 'small', 'town', 'Bomont', 'soon', 'discovers', 'dances', 'are', 'banned', 'following', 'tragic', 'accident', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'five', 'high', 'schoolers', 'were', 'killed', 'Not', 'only', 'blaring', 'music', 'drive', 'car', 'country', 'road', 'can', 'get', 'fined', 'butts', 'heads', 'police', 'preacher', 'headmaster', 'soon', 'attractive', 'rebellious', 'yet', 'troubled', 'preachers', 'daughter', 'Ariel', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'who', 'blanks', 'him.Somewhere', 'town', 'highschoolers', 'can', 'go', 'blare', 'music', 'long', 'authorities', 'appear', 'Ren', 'dances', 'eye', 'Ariel', 'brother', 'died', 'accident', 'messing', 'up', 'out', 'thrillseeking', 'dangerously', 'destructive', 'local', 'bad', 'boy', 'attraction', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'preacher', 'bad', 'boy', 'Will', 'Ren', 'get', 'Will', 'change', 'ways', 'Will', 'do', 'mambo', ""'re"", 'are', 'questions', 'run', 'mind', 'watch', 'movie.You', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Not', 'having', 'previously', 'seen', 'original', 'Footloose', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'who', 'won', 'twice', 'Dancing', 'stars', 'world', 'champion', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'before', 'danced', 'professionally', 'world', 'top', 'entertainers', 'such', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'believe', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'found', 'performance', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'engaging', 'clearly', 'great', 'dance', 'skills', 'Somewhat', 'surprise', 'was', 'impressed', 'acting', 'performance', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'several', 'great', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'movie', 'particularly', 'when', 'slapped', 'knew', 'could', 'dance', 'did', 'not', 'recognise', 'Burlesque', 'wore', 'brunette', 'wig', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'decent', 'career', 'leading', 'movie', 'actress', 'obvious', 'appeal', 'depth.In', 'respects', 'better', 'original', 'particularly', 'storytelling', 'inciting', 'incident', 'accident', 'beginning', 'dancing', 'particularly', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'others', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'What', 'surprised', 'given', 'talent', 'Hough', 'was', 'underused', 'dancing', 'capacity', 'had', 'solo', 'speak', 'of.In', 'respects', 'original', 'better', 'particularly', 'depth', 'acting', 'talent', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'such', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'preacher', 'wife', 'characters', 'were', 'three', 'dimensional', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'course', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'supporting', 'role', 'Ariel', 'friend', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Christopher', 'Penn', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brother.The', 'best', 'known', 'actors', 'new', 'version', 'are', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Angie', 'McDowell', 'yet', 'somehow', 'director', 'played', 'down', 'role', 'characters', 'so', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional.I', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'versions', 'new', 'movie', 'updated', 'soundtrack', 'new', 'artists', 'think', 'remake', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'version', 'will', 'appeal', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'alive', 'when', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'think', 'are', 'seeing', 'too', 'many', 'remakes', 'year.If', 'want', 'watch', 'dance', 'movie', 'recommendThe', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'one', 'greatest', 'dance', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

Oleson,"[2, 3]","Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow"", ""Black Snake Moan"") would seem to be an unlikely choice for directing this update of the 1984 minor classic of the same name.  Replacing Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as the teenage leads are dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough.  While neither is quite ready for the Oscar walk, they hold their own on the acting thing and are more than qualified in the dancing department.The cornball story line has to do with the aftermath of a tragic car accident which killed 5 of small town Bomont, Georgia's teenagers.  Returning from a dance, the driver lost control and hit a semi-truck head on.  As a result, the town's (pop. 19,000) preacher (and father of the driver) leads the city council to set curfews for teens and outlaws loud music and dancing.  Ren (Wormald) moves to Bomont from Boston after his mother dies to live with his uncle and his family.  Ren discovers Ariel (Hough) who is the sister of the ill-fated driver and daughter of the Rev. (Dennis Quaid).  She's gone from nice girl to naughty girl after her brother's death, but mom and dad don't recognize her own pain.  Ren, of course does.  And when they discover they can both dance pretty well, they decide to try to overturn the arcane laws put in place.Brewer and his choreographers do a good job of mixing up the dancing routines which range from country line dancing to acrobatic breaking, locking and popping.  All good although I thought Hough's abilities were restrained.  Her dance time was mostly sexy accompanying to Wormald's leads.  There's nothing really special about this movie, but I admit my toes were tappin' throughout.The 1080p Blu ray disc has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is near perfect in every regard.  Beautiful sharp, clear photography transfers with no faults that I could see.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is equally excellent.

1303179,A3IM5IGE0JCLHO,B002ZG97LK,"One World ""One World""","[3, 4]","I just skimmed the one-star reviews decrying the messing with of a classic. When I rented this I was skeptical and thought I was going to be among that group as I was just a very young - under 21 - adult for the first go-around.  I've seen what Hollywood can do to a classic TV show like Dukes of Hazzard and also The Brady Bunch and some remakes of other movies have been less than decent.  So I was not about to plunk down my hard-earned at Walmart money to see basically a ""High School Musical"" or ""Glee"" dumb-down of this in the theater.I have to say that I was impressed at the faithfulness this rework exercised - like a great cover of a favorite song.  While the time-frame of the story is set in the present time, it's the same.  I like how they revisit some of the original music of the 1984 but give it a new twist.  The acoustic rendition of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" was superb.  Also I like a few of the changes for some of the scenes such as the racing of the school buses in place of the chicken game with the farm tractors, the dance at the drive-in instead of the hamburger joint and the dance lesson scenes for the cowboy kid were adorable. Making changes like these does not diminish the movie in anyway, there is not need to make a carbon copy, no more than Whitney trying to make a country version of ""I Will Always Love You"", her rendition captures the spirit of that song.While the original movie is still and always will be my classic, there are some elements that give this version an advantage over the original:The Opening: The tragic car wreck and what led up to it and the subsequent laws that were passed as a result.  Here we see that the laws being passed in the wake of the tragedy came from love and genuine concern for the well-being of the adolescents from a heart-broken community.The Court Scene: The concern stemming from the heartbreak from the loss is once again communicated by the preacher  when Ren wants to appeal against the no-dancing law.  The original movie paints the adults as oppressive and uncaring toward the youth because you don't see that love and concern that spawned the law, also the committee are rather condescending with Ren in the original.  In this remake, the preacher sounds empathetic and sensitive to what Ren is asking for.  Overall, the court scene in the remake is rendered much better in my opinion.Preacher/Daughter Showdown Scene:  Here we see that the daughter is not merely being a rebel, she - like her mother - are frustrated by him, that because of losing his son he is over doing it in trying to protect her to the point that he is basically smothering her.Preacher and Ren Scene:  Finally Ren's asking the preacher if he can take his daughter to the dance that was going to happen anyway in the neighboring town since Bomont was to remain a no-dance town. Here we see the preacher and the person he considers his enemy beginning to see eye to eye.I like how this movie - though depicting the typical ""teenage rebellion"" and showing drinking of alcohol and explicit dancing, I feel it's conveys the message that it isn't espousing such behavior but showing how it can lead to bad consequences - the accident - and that while adolescents may want to ""act stupid"" as Ren said in the courtroom, there is a way to do it without harming yourself.  The movie also - like the original - espouses that parents and adults concerned about adolescents have to find that balance where you can set boundaries to protect them but not so much you are stiffing them and even giving them a reason to fight against you.Congratulations on a job well done.",5,I Agree!

At 65 I could of gotten up and danced along with them and guess what I did.  Change of story just enough to make it right for today's teens.  Dennis Quaid and Andy McDowell were perfect as the preacher and his wife they even made the movie more realistic by being in it.Trust is a big issue and if they do not earn your trust in them then a time out or grounding is correct for any teen.  Once they know you are the parent and not their Friend, as well as NOT buying their Love.  This helps them Respect you, as the parent and the teens will be trustworthy and make each parent proud to say that is my son or daughter.No child is perfect at what ever age they grow because of our guidance and values, as well as morals.

I remember sitting between 2 of my friends and letting the movie take me to this magical world where music and dance could unite a community.  When we left the theater, my car was covered with snow, and I remember taking the snow brush out of my trunk and doing the ""footloose"" dance to my cassette of Quiet Riot (in the movie) while my friends cheered me on.  One of the best memories I have of being a teenager.My teen years are, well, over 20 years behind me, so this movie means a lot to me.  When I heard they were remaking it, I was not happy.  I began watching this movie with a well deserved hatred.  How dare they mess with my memories??!!  Outside of the bus racing scene, this is an absolutely A++++ revision of the original.  The current version is respectful of the movie it is based on without being a lame carbon copy.  The leads are under appreciated actors and incredible dancers.  I defy anyone of my age (46) to watch the new Ren teach his best friend to dance and not remember Kevin Bacon teaching Chris Penn to dance.This movie has the heart and soul of the original, while giving it a time-sensitive make over.

Some parts were good others felt 'cut in'. The actors...I really don't know what's up with trying to pass off older actors as teens. Doesn't make sense to me. It's bareable sometimes- some people have 'young genes' like the actors in Highschool Musical. But it was painfully obvious these guys were not in Highschool.The second thing is that it's too extreme- in some movies directors/writers will write the most dramatic extreme thing they can think of to keep you watching. It doesn't work, it just feels chaotic from one scene to the next. It lacks that flow that takes you through the story. On top of that it just rushes from one topic to another.Another thing is the music- there have got to be way way better songs than the ones chosen for this movie. A lot of it was just noise. Not even good noise.If you can sit through it- kudos to you. Honestly, an hour into the movie I checked how much time was left and decided not to sit through yet another hour of watching this. At least not tonight, lol. To the point- there are MUCH better movies out there. This is just okay, a very low okay. I definitely don't recommend this for kids- or anyone really. I don't understand the high ratings but to each his own I guess.The first reason I gave it 3 stars is because if the plot, the actors, the overall flow of the movie had been more thought out and refined it could've actually made sense. If it weren't a remake of the original footloose, and just it's own movie it would've been better.

Now in this movie they raced with old school buses and there were more then the two of them. Miles Teller, I feel he .didn't come across as being strong, He made me think that one good punch and he would be in lala land. Were Chris Penn was bulky and he looked strong, he looked like the country boy that worked all day lifting hay at a farm. Now Miles did wonderful with the dancing. I loved the music and all the dancing in this. I loved also that they tried to play the same songs that the first movie had and they did a lot of the songs, but they were alittle different. Then the ending I felt was so nice that they played the same last song of Kenny Logins and did the same last dance that Kevin Bacon did. That was awesome. This movie will be one that I will watch over and over. I probably be play the first one and comparing them. This is a movie that the whole family can watch.  Its about two teens that live in this town that as a law on rock and roll music and dancing. So this boy comes to this town to live and the people feel that he is bad and a troublemaker.

Mostly about the same, but overall I don't think it was as good as the original.Spoiler alert! The rest of this review contains detailed descriptions of the plot.Better than the original:Ren being from Boston instead of Chicago. Although it was kind of bogus that he never once mentioned anything particular to Boston (such as the Red Sox, stuff like that), it somehow worked better to have him be from Boston.Setting it in the South rather than the West. Again, it just makes more sense that way, I think.Worse than the original:No good scenes of Ren doing gymnastics. What's the point of that plot element if we only see it indirectly through his dancing? The gymnastics talent was cool, and I wish it had been more evident in this remake.Andie MacDowell was nowhere near as good as Dianne West. But I don't really think MacDowell is a particularly good actor in the first place, so I was not surprised.Dialogue changes. Pretty much everywhere they changed the dialogue, they made it worse. There were a few good modifications, but the majority of the modifications made the scenes worse rather than better. For example, cutting the &#34;What did David do? . . . What did David do?&#34; line. I don't know why they cut that line--maybe Wormald couldn't pull it off the way Bacon could, or maybe they just didn't think it added anything--but it is one of the most famous lines in the movie, and it was just silly for them to remove it.The same:Kenny Wormald did a good job. I am a little biased toward Kevin Bacon for this role, but I think Wormald did fine as well. The girl who played Ariel also did a fine job. Dennis Quaid also did a good job, maybe as good as John Lithgow.Overall plot is fairly comparable to the original.-----All things considered, this remake is okay and worth watching for fans of the original movie, but just go into it with low expectations and let the movie exceed your expectations.",3,Worth watching but keep your expectations low,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,2014,"['was', 'okay', 'ways', 'better', 'original', 'other', 'ways', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Mostly', 'same', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'original.Spoiler', 'alert', 'rest', 'review', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'plot.Better', 'original', 'Ren', 'being', 'Boston', 'instead', 'Chicago', 'was', 'kind', 'bogus', 'never', 'once', 'mentioned', 'anything', 'particular', 'Boston', 'such', 'Red', 'Sox', 'stuff', 'somehow', 'worked', 'better', 'have', 'be', 'Boston.Setting', 'South', 'rather', 'West', 'Again', 'just', 'more', 'sense', 'way', 'think.Worse', 'original', 'good', 'scenes', 'Ren', 'doing', 'gymnastics', 'What', 'point', 'plot', 'element', 'only', 'see', 'indirectly', 'dancing', 'gymnastics', 'talent', 'was', 'cool', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'evident', 'remake.Andie', 'MacDowell', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'Dianne', 'West', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'MacDowell', 'particularly', 'good', 'actor', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'not', 'surprised.Dialogue', 'changes', 'Pretty', 'much', 'changed', 'dialogue', 'made', 'worse', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'modifications', 'majority', 'modifications', 'made', 'scenes', 'worse', 'rather', 'better', 'example', 'cutting', '34', 'What', 'did', 'David', 'do', 'What', 'did', 'David', 'do', '34', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'cut', 'line', 'maybe', 'Wormald', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'way', 'Bacon', 'could', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'anything', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'lines', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'remove', 'it.The', 'same', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'am', 'little', 'biased', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'role', 'think', 'Wormald', 'did', 'fine', 'well', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Ariel', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'maybe', 'as', 'good', 'John', 'Lithgow.Overall', 'plot', 'fairly', 'comparable', 'original.', '-All', 'things', 'considered', 'remake', 'okay', 'worth', 'watching', 'fans', 'original', 'movie', 'just', 'go', 'low', 'expectations', 'let', 'movie', 'exceed', 'expectations']",N/A

I found a lot of people who Hate the idea of this movie being re-made.I also believe that most, if not all of these people wouldn't like the idea of any older film being re-made & think they believe films being re-made are bad before they even see them.I can understand where these people are coming from, but to all of those people please give this movie a chance! Also, remember like me, the original Footloose will always hold a special place in your Heart, so even if you dont like this newer version, you won't lose the older version!!!Futhermore, although this newer version of the Iconic Film has a lot of similarties to the old version, it isn't the Old version!!!However, this Version of the film offers it's own STYLE & FLARE!!!A lot of the scenes in the movie were near matches to scenes in the Original Footloose, and I really appreciated that, as it shows much Respect to the Original.Also the same VW bug appeared, same tux jacket & similar outfits, hairstyles, quotes etc...All the main actors did a Fantastic Job in their respective roles!!!Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough had incredible on screen Chemistry & made a very good Ren & Ariel.Julianne looked AMAZING & showed she can act & act well!!!Kenny showed he can act as well & though he was no Kevin Bacon, he did one heck of a good job playing Ren.Dennis Quaid played the strong willed Pastor, and he was very believable & real!The new Williard did a good job... he was funny, showed his slow side(lol), had some great dance moves, and really fit the role well as his chemisty with Kenny Wormald was excellent!The bad guy who played Chuck Cranston in the movie didn't seem to fit too well! I didn't like him near as much as Jim Youngs who played the bad guy in the Original Footloose.The Dancing sequences were Amazing, and appropriate for todays style of dancing.The songs/music were pretty good, but no match compared to the older Famous film Soundtrack that accompanied the original film.They did manage to play the Kenny Loggins version of Footloose in the film, and I think they played the Deniece Williams version of Lets hear it for the boy, in which it was really nice to hear both of the original versions in this film.Even though I like the Origianl Better, all in all I liked this Version of Footloose too. It was Exciting, Fun, Intense, High Spirited, Invigorating & was an AWESOME FLASHBACK to one of the Greatest movies of all time!!!Please go & see the movie before judging it, and don't be too harsh on it, as nothing will replace the Original Version!Thanks for reading my review!",5,"Not the Original, but it is DARN Good!",1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,3083,"['very', 'long', 'wait', 'finally', 'just', 'saw', 'new', 'Footloose', 'film', 'theater', 'could', 'barely', 'hold', 'excitment', 'longer', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'DISAPPOINTED', 'child', '80', 'probably', 'biggest', 'Footloose', 'fan', 'time', 'will', 'say', 'go', 'movie', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'Footloose', 'saw', 'back', '80', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bit', 'surprised', 'maybe', 'even', 'disappointed.After', 'reading', 'previous', 'articles/reviews', 'other', 'sites', 'talking', 'people', 'work', 'friends', 'etc', 'found', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'Hate', 'idea', 'movie', 'being', 're-made.I', 'also', 'believe', 'most', 'not', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'older', 'film', 'being', 're-made', 'think', 'believe', 'films', 'being', 're-made', 'are', 'bad', 'even', 'see', 'them.I', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'coming', 'people', 'please', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'Also', 'remember', 'original', 'Footloose', 'will', 'always', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'Heart', 'so', 'even', 'dont', 'newer', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'older', 'version', 'Futhermore', 'newer', 'version', 'Iconic', 'Film', 'lot', 'similarties', 'old', 'version', ""n't"", 'Old', 'version', 'However', 'Version', 'film', 'own', 'STYLE', 'FLARE', 'lot', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'near', 'matches', 'scenes', 'Original', 'Footloose', 'really', 'appreciated', 'much', 'Respect', 'Original.Also', 'same', 'VW', 'bug', 'appeared', 'same', 'tux', 'jacket', 'similar', 'outfits', 'hairstyles', 'quotes', 'etc', 'main', 'actors', 'did', 'Fantastic', 'Job', 'respective', 'roles', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'had', 'incredible', 'screen', 'Chemistry', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'Ren', 'Ariel.Julianne', 'looked', 'AMAZING', 'showed', 'can', 'act', 'act', 'well', 'Kenny', 'showed', 'can', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'did', 'one', 'heck', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Ren.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'played', 'strong', 'willed', 'Pastor', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'real', 'new', 'Williard', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'funny', 'showed', 'slow', 'side', 'lol', 'had', 'great', 'dance', 'moves', 'really', 'fit', 'role', 'well', 'chemisty', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'was', 'excellent', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Chuck', 'Cranston', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'too', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'near', 'as', 'much', 'Jim', 'Youngs', 'who', 'played', 'bad', 'guy', 'Original', 'Footloose.The', 'Dancing', 'sequences', 'were', 'Amazing', 'appropriate', 'todays', 'style', 'dancing.The', 'songs/music', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'match', 'compared', 'older', 'Famous', 'film', 'Soundtrack', 'accompanied', 'original', 'film.They', 'did', 'manage', 'play', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'version', 'Footloose', 'film', 'think', 'played', 'Deniece', 'Williams', 'version', 'Lets', 'hear', 'boy', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'hear', 'original', 'versions', 'film.Even', 'like', 'Origianl', 'Better', 'liked', 'Version', 'Footloose', 'too', 'was', 'Exciting', 'Fun', 'Intense', 'High', 'Spirited', 'Invigorating', 'was', 'AWESOME', 'FLASHBACK', 'one', 'Greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'Please', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'judging', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'nothing', 'will', 'replace', 'Original', 'Version', 'Thanks', 'reading', 'review']",N/A

As such, I was pleasantly surprised, although not outright blown away.For a basic plot summary, ""Footloose 2011"" is a typical ""teens vs. adults"" flick.  When a car crash (after a night of partying) kills five high school seniors, their community pastor (played by Dennis Quaid) restricts future teenage rebellious behavior by controlling the town with strict laws/curfews.  That is, of course, until his daughter (Julianne Hough) meets the new kid in town from Boston (Kenny Wormald) and the town gets stirred up once again.The prevailing factor in this film experience is that the movie is good at what it does.  It provides everything that one expects to see, such as: incredible dancing, popular music, attractive men/women, and teen-centered plots.  All those things are accomplished with aplomb.An ""added bonus"" is the quality of acting from both the youngsters and adults (especially Quaid) in the film.  Though inherently a bit hokey, this movie could have diverged into pure cheeseball without such strong performances.Thus, while I can't give it an enormous star rating because it isn't an outright classic, it is very good at what it does (and if you like that kind of thing, your rating will be much higher).  Three and a half stars would probably be a more exact ranking.
