928459,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000AM6OC6,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 0]","First off, I'll start by saying that this review is based off of my impressions of the first episode. I was lucky enough to receive the special DVD in the mail though Shonen Jump magazine. However, the episode was a full, uncut episode, starting from the opening lead to the end credits, so I was given more than enough to form a healthy opinion. I will say that, even from only seeing this episode, I was impressed.The manga, which can be found in Shonen Jump and in separate graphic novels, is about a boy named Hikaru who discovers an ancient, blood-stained Go board (Go is a game popular around the world, but mostly in Asia) which contains the spirit of an Go master named Fujiwara-no-Sai who lived in long-ago Japan. He's kept in this life by his strong desire to continue playing Go so that he can achieve the ""divine move."" The anime starts here as well, and goes from there in nearly the same direction the manga did. Hikaru becomes possessed by the innocent and effeminate Sai, but instead of becoming horrified by this (initially, there is some shock of course) he decides to use it, and has Sai help him on his school tests and homework. Sai agrees in exchange for a chance to play Go. It was this agreement that sent Hikaru to the local Go parlor where he would meet, and defeat, the gifted young Go player Akira. This fateful meeting drives the manga and will no doubt drive the anime as well.You wouldn't think that a manga or an anime about playing a board game would be interesting, but surprisingly it is. There is a level of tension that comes into the game Hikaru plays with Akira, heightened by the fact that Hikaru knows absolutely nothing about the game. That tension, I might add, is not built by applying creepy looking monsters that pop out of cards (sorry Yu-Gi-Oh! fans). If the anime follows the manga as it looks like it will do, then this is sure to be a promising series. Other bonuses include decent opening and closing themes, well-voiced characters, and top-notch animation.My one problem with this anime, however, was Sai's voice. It sometimes has an annoying pitch to it, and when he whines you can feel it rattling your ear-drums. Some may think this adds to the effect, but think about that later down the line after seeing volume after volume of the anime. The Japanese track will probably be the track to watch this anime with.Still, I highly recommend this to fans of the manga, or fans of any of the other Shonen Jump titles. I would also recommend it for parents of young children, as the story is simple with great characters and a few morals sprinkled about, without being overly melodramatic. It's not as good as the manga, but Hikaru no Go promises to eventually reach that point soon.",4,This Review is Based Off the First Episode,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,2733,"['First', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'review', 'based', 'impressions', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'receive', 'special', 'DVD', 'mail', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'magazine', 'However', 'episode', 'was', 'full', 'uncut', 'episode', 'starting', 'opening', 'lead', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'enough', 'form', 'healthy', 'opinion', 'will', 'say', 'even', 'only', 'seeing', 'episode', 'was', 'impressed.The', 'manga', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'separate', 'graphic', 'novels', 'boy', 'named', 'Hikaru', 'who', 'ancient', 'blood-stained', 'Go', 'board', 'Go', 'game', 'popular', 'world', 'mostly', 'Asia', 'spirit', 'Go', 'master', 'named', 'Fujiwara-no-Sai', 'who', 'lived', 'long-ago', 'Japan', 'kept', 'life', 'strong', 'desire', 'continue', 'playing', 'Go', 'so', 'can', 'achieve', 'divine', 'move', 'anime', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'there', 'nearly', 'same', 'direction', 'manga', 'did', 'Hikaru', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'innocent', 'effeminate', 'Sai', 'instead', 'becoming', 'horrified', 'initially', 'shock', 'course', 'use', 'Sai', 'help', 'school', 'tests', 'homework', 'Sai', 'exchange', 'chance', 'play', 'Go', 'was', 'agreement', 'sent', 'Hikaru', 'local', 'Go', 'parlor', 'where', 'would', 'meet', 'defeat', 'gifted', 'young', 'Go', 'player', 'Akira', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'manga', 'will', 'doubt', 'drive', 'anime', 'well.You', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'manga', 'anime', 'playing', 'board', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'surprisingly', 'level', 'tension', 'game', 'Hikaru', 'Akira', 'heightened', 'fact', 'Hikaru', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'game', 'tension', 'might', 'add', 'not', 'built', 'applying', 'creepy', 'looking', 'monsters', 'pop', 'cards', 'sorry', 'Yu-Gi-Oh', 'fans', 'anime', 'manga', 'will', 'do', 'then', 'sure', 'be', 'promising', 'series', 'Other', 'bonuses', 'include', 'decent', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'well-voiced', 'characters', 'top-notch', 'animation.My', 'one', 'problem', 'anime', 'however', 'was', 'Sai', 'voice', 'sometimes', 'annoying', 'pitch', 'when', 'can', 'feel', 'rattling', 'ear-drums', 'may', 'think', 'effect', 'think', 'later', 'down', 'line', 'seeing', 'volume', 'volume', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'track', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'track', 'watch', 'anime', 'with.Still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'manga', 'fans', 'other', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'titles', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'story', 'simple', 'great', 'characters', 'few', 'morals', 'sprinkled', 'about', 'being', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'manga', 'Hikaru', 'Go', 'eventually', 'reach', 'point', 'soon']",N/A

While the Japanese voices sound better, the English ones are OK and the translation is much better in the dubbed version. My 7 year-old daughter is now watching it with me on Amazon and she loves it.The story is very well done. The rules of the game, club atmosphere, competition, history and even some moral issues are being introduced slowly and subtly while following a nice story of a rebellious boy growing up.For go players it is fun to freeze-frame on board positions, they are all real and carefully created.There are a few more episodes about an international competition that are available only as manga, never turned in an anime.My only complaint is that Amazon is offering only the first season.

It has a lot of intensity, and during the first 4 episodes you actually learn how to play  a little.

This is a wonderful show with beautiful art, music, and characters. This is a little like Yu-gi-oh, but i think the game is a little more advanced. and you dont have to collect a bunch of cards.

Abentroth ""Shopping Addict""","[2, 2]","If I were to describe this to you as a show based on a kid being taught how to play an ancient game kinda like chess by a ghost, you probably wouldn't want to watch it. Yes, it is similar, but the series is a LOT more than that, seriously!You don't have to play or even understand the game of go to watch this series, they describe certain things to you through the characters so you aren't completely lost. It gets to be fun to watch the matches played out (in fast motion mostly, don't worry, it's not boring.) The show even got myself and my boyfriend into playing the game.The plot of the series is young Hikaru finds an old go board in his father's attic and since he has this hidden talent to play go, the ghost of the board (a VERY important go player back in the day, teacher to an emperor) is released to teach him to play go and live vicariously through Hikaru. After Hikaru gives in to Sai's pleading to find someone for him to play, he ends up at a go parlor where go kid genius Touya Akira regularly plays. Sai ends up beating Touya and Hikaru is marked as competition for Touya later down the road.Throughout the series, Hikaru makes friends through playing go and works his way up the go ranks by going to a go school and entering tournaments and receiving ranks. There are many different and interesting plotlines in each series and we see the characters grow up before our eyes. The character development is intense and when they start showing clips from the beginning of the series in characters' memories, you are amazed at how little and immature they were in the first series.The soundtrack is awesome, too. The theme songs are good (""Bokura no Boken"" is my absolute favorite) and after a while the songs and segues are easily recognizable while you watch the series. The music is highly stylized and flows very well in the scenes.Read the manga! Watch this series!

928463,A2P5DHT5BNT3DS,B000AM6OC6,I. Kim,"[4, 17]","I strongly recommand this to everyone especially youngsters in between age 9-15. This anime is a pure brilliance and I was shocked by how good it came out to be. As a Igo player once in China, I did not expect that someone could write an anime about this game for 75 episodes. However, I was wrong -- there hasn't been a single min during which I was bored. The author closely connects the game with the character's personal development as they approach adulthood. This isn't just an anime about winning or losing the ""Go"" game. By improving their game skills, the main characters learn to control their emotions, meet different people, orginize their lives compete with friends while keeping their friendship strong and intact. Yet, this anime doesn't stop at this level. There were themes about respecting other people (including your rivals), the value of friendship, and the retribution of arrogance. On the other hand, as both a friend and a mentor for Hikaru, Sai has played the most important role in Hikaru's life. If one pays close attention to Hikaru's attitude towards Sai before Sai's transcend, Hikarue behaves totally like a child lacking of respect and appreciation. His selfish and arrogant actions are directed toward not only Sai but also his friends. However, he learned this lession the hard way (after losing Sai without even having a chance to say Goodbye). As most viewers might feel that at the end of the show, Hikaru suddenly became mature and more determined to follow the path he has chosen with much confidence. In fact, every character became a better person at the end, through this game, Go, they are able to improve themselves in every respect. The dissapointment I had for this anime is that Hikaru never apologized to Sai. I feel bad for Sai since without him Hikaru would still be a no-body. At least Hikaru should apologize to Sai for his ignorance. Other than that, I really wanted to see Hikaru and Akari get together but that's besides the point ^_^.",5,"if you like Go , must see :)",1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,1990,"['strongly', 'recommand', 'everyone', 'especially', 'youngsters', 'age', '9-15', 'anime', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'good', 'came', 'out', 'be', 'Igo', 'player', 'once', 'China', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'someone', 'could', 'write', 'anime', 'game', '75', 'episodes', 'However', 'was', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'been', 'single', 'min', 'was', 'bored', 'author', 'closely', 'game', 'character', 'personal', 'development', 'approach', 'adulthood', ""n't"", 'just', 'anime', 'winning', 'losing', 'Go', 'game', 'improving', 'game', 'skills', 'main', 'characters', 'learn', 'control', 'emotions', 'meet', 'different', 'people', 'orginize', 'lives', 'compete', 'friends', 'keeping', 'friendship', 'strong', 'intact', 'anime', ""n't"", 'stop', 'level', 'were', 'themes', 'respecting', 'other', 'people', 'including', 'rivals', 'value', 'friendship', 'retribution', 'arrogance', 'other', 'hand', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Hikaru', 'Sai', 'played', 'most', 'important', 'role', 'Hikaru', 'life', 'one', 'close', 'attention', 'Hikaru', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Sai', 'Sai', 'transcend', 'Hikarue', 'totally', 'child', 'lacking', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'actions', 'are', 'directed', 'not', 'only', 'Sai', 'also', 'friends', 'However', 'learned', 'lession', 'hard', 'way', 'losing', 'Sai', 'even', 'having', 'chance', 'say', 'Goodbye', 'most', 'viewers', 'might', 'feel', 'end', 'show', 'Hikaru', 'suddenly', 'became', 'mature', 'more', 'determined', 'follow', 'path', 'chosen', 'much', 'confidence', 'fact', 'character', 'became', 'better', 'person', 'end', 'game', 'Go', 'are', 'able', 'improve', 'respect', 'dissapointment', 'had', 'anime', 'Hikaru', 'never', 'apologized', 'Sai', 'feel', 'bad', 'Sai', 'Hikaru', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'no-body', 'least', 'Hikaru', 'should', 'apologize', 'Sai', 'ignorance', 'Other', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Hikaru', 'Akari', 'get', 'together', 'point', '^_^']",N/A

928467,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000AM6OC6,Sebastian Fernandez,"[2, 2]","What a wonderful story! Hikaru is searching his granddad's basement, to see if there is anything of value he can sell, to compensate for losing his allowance after a failed test, and he comes across a Go board. This has a profound effect on his life, since together with the board, he finds the spirit of Sai, an ancient Go player that has some unfinished business with the game; he seeks to play the Divine Move. Therefore, he possesses Hikaru and they quickly struck a deal, Hikaru will play go following Sai's guidance in exchange for the spirit helping him with his courses, especially the dreaded history.The transformation Hikaru suffers, even in this few first episodes is mesmerizing, since he goes from a disrespectful attitude for the game to displaying an interest and passion that grow with each game he plays. Sai's past life is a central part of the story, and one that gives it a very interesting twist. Being a fanatic chess player myself, I can relate with Sai's passion for the game. Since Go has similar characteristics to chess, I can understand how the events that developed in his past life affected his existence.Right from the start we get to see a myriad of opponents Hikaru has to face, each with his unique characteristics. The fact that the story provides background on each of these is a big plus in my book. There is also a hint of romance in the air, between Hikaru and his female friend, but the series has not gone there yet; I am pretty sure it will though.In terms of the graphics, these are some of the most impressive I have ever seen, with drawings with an unbelievable level of detail and bright and crisp colors. The animation is so good that you can almost feel that Go is an action game, instead of a quiet board game. Such is the intensity of the characters when they play it! Another important feature in this DVD, which is helpful for a big part of its Western audience, is the glossary explaining the game of Go and the terms used in the anime. Besides this, there are short video segments in between episodes, with a teacher and two kids explaining the basics of the game.I never thought that a series about playing a board game could be so fast-paced and exciting.
