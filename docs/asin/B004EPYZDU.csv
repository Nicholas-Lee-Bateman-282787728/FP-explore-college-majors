1398407,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EPYZDU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 22]","With the 2010-2011 television season wrapping up, it is official that the promising ""The Chicago Code"" will not be back for a sophomore year.  An intriguing, if not wholly successful, cop show--I will say this one scored huge points for not being a typical procedural tackling a new case each week.  Created by Shawn Ryan, the show excelled at depicting the political struggles and manipulations inherent in a government bureaucracy even if it didn't always ring true with its supporting characters and peripheral story lines.  But at heart, the show's strengths far outweighed its shortcomings.  I came into ""The Chicago Code"" with pretty hefty expectations, I must admit.  Ryan created, in my opinion, TV's greatest police drama ""The Shield"" as well as the under appreciated and quirky ""Terriers.""  Both of those shows, however, benefited from being on FX--a network that is able to provide edgier and more realistic fare than traditional networks (this aired on Fox).  In most respects, you can see the distinct difference.The show centers around the appointment of a new police commissioner (Jennifer Beals) who vows to tackle corruption and complacency within the Chicago department.  Aided by a former colleague and hotshot cop, Jason Clarke, the pair take on cases of particular political volatility.  One of their primary targets is a potentially corrupt city alderman played with precision by Delroy Lindo.  It is this continuing story line that gives ""The Chicago Code"" its greatest drama and intrigue.The Good:  Clarke, a great actor who has been restrained in previous roles, has a chance to really break out here.  Beals is an intriguingly complex character.  And Lindo, as I mentioned, is riveting.  He steals every scene he's in.  The action revolving around his plot lines is dynamic and mesmerizing.The Bad:  As great as the central characters are, the show falters a bit with its supporting cast.  Clarke's niece is also on the force and having a dalliance with her partner.  In one episode, this secret relationship is exposed causing a settlement suit to be awarded to a complainant.  However, somehow the affair still remains a secret after becoming a part of public record.  Huh?  And there is an undercover cop in the Irish mob.  He's a low level hood that somehow ascends to exactly the position he needs to be in.  Very convenient and not at all plausible.  Add the fact that he is constantly in contact with Beals and Clarke (even in public venues) and deep undercover has never seemed so shallow.  The actors are all fine, the screenplay is just taking unnecessary shortcuts that undermine the show's truthfulness.The Perplexing:  This being a network show, Ryan doesn't have the luxury of using realistically colorful language.  He, therefore, makes Clarke a character who is offended by the use of curse words (especially in front of children).  Okay, I'll buy it--except for one thing.  He just substitutes euphemisms for swear words that sound just like swear words.  If he were really offended by bad language, his vocabulary would reflect that--he wouldn't just make up new words.All in all, though, I enjoyed the show and think it might have developed into a richer and more rewarding experience.  But we'll never know.  For Beals, Clarke, and Lindo--this is still an easy recommendation.  I'll follow Ryan to his next show (back on cable, I hope) and maybe that one can make it past one season (the great Terriers also didn't get a second season pick-up).  If you like cop shows, you'll probably like this one too.

I like the show and it  has  promise for future episodes. With that being said of the cast I just hope they don't go changing cast members by the second season, should there be one.To give you an idea of the show it's like The Shield and The Wire the softer version.PS: can't believe Jennifer Beals is 47 wow and she is bad &% in this show.",4,;0),1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,709,"['crime', 'dramas', 'already', 'have', 'TV', ""n't"", 'bad', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'show', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'must', 'say', 'know', 'Jennifer', 'Beal', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'show', 'cops', 'corruptions', 'other', 'issues', 'going', 'Chicago', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'only', 'think', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'promise', 'future', 'episodes', 'being', 'said', 'cast', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'changing', 'cast', 'members', 'second', 'season', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'one.To', 'give', 'idea', 'show', 'Shield', 'Wire', 'softer', 'version.PS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', '47', 'wow', 'bad', '%', 'show']",N/A
1398409,AL66W0H5A29VQ,B004EPYZDU,"lusty22 ""avid reader""","[13, 15]","The first season of The Chicago Code created by the same talented Shawn Ryan of ""The Shield"" is by far the best of all the new cop dramas introduced to us this season. It is not easy to appeal to the masses from what I understand. Must be everyone has their own ideas about what makes a cop drama good. Realism is my first request and no one knows how to meet that requirement better than Shawn Ryan in my book. The Shield was seven seasons of non stop action and enjoyment. When I read about this latest offering from him I was super excited. The Chicago Code has great acting and realistic plots. The guy from Showtimes's Brotherhood carries the show well. His partner is played by the adorable kid from Friday Night Lights who is just as appealing in this role. Jennifer Beal is good as the newly appointed police commisioner. The show is based on Chicago politics and it's subsequent corruption. It's interesting for the viewer to see how a city gets run. I think that edge in itself makes this show stand out from other cop dramas and it creates a unique take on the inner workings of a great city . It not only concentrates on crimes being committed and solved, but it focuses on the police commisioner working with a couple of select cops to clean up the underhanded workings of the city politicians and workers. There are interesting relationships being played out as well to keep it a little bit soapy. It is not crass and aggresive like The Shield but it is also not light or silly like many other popular cop shows. All in all it has a difficult time slot as it is up against ABC's Dancing With The Stars and we all know Fox can be quite unforgiving with their new shows. It seems like they are not always treated fairly or given a fighting chance. I am thinking of the wonderful Terriers on FX and how quickly it was axed. Sadly this show has not done as well in the ratings as it should have, it did'nt seem to get much hype. It's a solid show and very intersting. I sure hope we can get a second season out of it. If you have not watched it you are missing a Monday night treat!",5,Great show so it will most likely get axed!,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,2092,"['first', 'season', 'Chicago', 'Code', 'created', 'same', 'talented', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'Shield', 'far', 'best', 'new', 'cop', 'dramas', 'introduced', 'season', 'not', 'easy', 'appeal', 'masses', 'what', 'understand', 'Must', 'be', 'everyone', 'own', 'ideas', 'what', 'cop', 'drama', 'good', 'Realism', 'first', 'request', 'one', 'how', 'meet', 'requirement', 'better', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'book', 'Shield', 'was', 'seven', 'seasons', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'enjoyment', 'When', 'read', 'latest', 'offering', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'Chicago', 'Code', 'great', 'acting', 'realistic', 'plots', 'guy', 'Showtimes', 'Brotherhood', 'show', 'well', 'partner', 'played', 'adorable', 'kid', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'who', 'just', 'appealing', 'role', 'Jennifer', 'Beal', 'good', 'newly', 'appointed', 'police', 'commisioner', 'show', 'based', 'Chicago', 'politics', 'subsequent', 'corruption', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'see', 'how', 'city', 'run', 'think', 'edge', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'cop', 'dramas', 'unique', 'take', 'inner', 'workings', 'great', 'city', 'not', 'only', 'crimes', 'being', 'committed', 'solved', 'police', 'commisioner', 'working', 'couple', 'select', 'cops', 'clean', 'up', 'underhanded', 'workings', 'city', 'politicians', 'workers', 'are', 'interesting', 'relationships', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'keep', 'little', 'bit', 'soapy', 'not', 'crass', 'aggresive', 'Shield', 'also', 'not', 'light', 'silly', 'many', 'other', 'popular', 'cop', 'shows', 'difficult', 'time', 'slot', 'up', 'ABC', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'know', 'Fox', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'unforgiving', 'new', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'treated', 'fairly', 'given', 'fighting', 'chance', 'am', 'thinking', 'wonderful', 'Terriers', 'FX', 'how', 'quickly', 'was', 'axed', 'Sadly', 'show', 'not', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'ratings', 'should', 'have', 'seem', 'get', 'much', 'hype', 'solid', 'show', 'very', 'intersting', 'sure', 'hope', 'can', 'get', 'second', 'season', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'are', 'missing', 'Monday', 'night', 'treat']",N/A

1398412,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B004EPYZDU,susannah,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed the show and thought Jennifer Beals did an amazing job as a tough police chief, with enemies and rivals looking to discredit her or remove her at every turn. The street criminals were only part of the problem, and not the biggest part. It wasn't perfect, but new shows rarely are right out of the gate, and I thought it would have found its legs, if given time. I as I said, thought Jennifer was badass enough to pull it off, and the character of Alderman Gibbons was wonderfully played, shaking someone's hand with one hand and stabbing them in the back with the other, the essence of benign evil. He was great. Sometimes it was members of Colvin's own family who threatened her.I didn't like Jason Clarke's character at all. I thought him narcissistic, far too much of a hotdog, acting like he was the commander of the force, instead of Colvin, calling all the shots, and that she should answer to and accede to him. I wanted there to be respect for her rank, instead of treating her like his personal buddy who would do anything he wanted, and more respect for the others on the force, who weren't just there at his beck and call, as was shown in every episode. I also didn't like the plotline with the niece having the affair with the partner, or the dragged on plot about his corrupt family.I really really really didn't like the conclusion that had the extremely publicized chief of police sitting in a fancy hotel bar picking up men, as though no one would have any clue who she was, not the people working at the bar, or other customers, or anyone. I didn't like Colvin being that self destructive but professionally it would be the most stupid thing to do, in public, where she would be seen, and in a venue where wealthy constituents would see her. She had had one sexual misconduct accusation already, earlier in the season. I felt it was just really lazy writing, and they could have done better.But on the whole it was a good show, a different show, and I wish that they would have given it more time. Instead, the reality shows roll on undisturbed.
