It's a history of the time period in which Bruce's classic Darkness on the Edge of Town was recorded.About half of it focuses on recent interviews with the members of the E. Street Band, and the other half shows the events (in black and white) that took place back in the mid to late 70's when this album was recorded, which means you will mostly be treated to witnessing Bruce and the rest of his band in the recording studio laying down lyrics, going over arrangements several times, Bruce fine tuning his guitar, constant disputes between the band members, etc.There's nothing really unordinary or especially noteworthy about this documentary, and it pretty much explains everything you've already known if you're well familiar with the Darkness album, but it's nice watching a documentary like this to possibly appreciate this great album even more than you already do.Then again, if you dislike the Darkness album or Springsteen himself, don't expect to be blown away by anything here either.  The best it would be able to accomplish at this point would be to allow you to *maybe* appreciate Darkness on the Edge of Town and give it another shot.However, this is the kind of history mostly intended for those who are big fans of the album.

Street Band in 1978 at the height of their sonic powers, recording outtakes and demos and alt versions of songs that later fought it out to be the Last Men Standing in the Darkness on the Edge of Town LP, I just wanted the sometimes grainy but always atmospheric and rousing and full-sounding rehearsal tapes to just play and play and play.  Instead, a few intriguing bars of a rare song get cut to a talking gray-head (sorry) enthusing about how great they were back-when, or a loose studio moment of catty bickering gets squelched in favor of another old-head reassuring us, &#34;We survived.&#34;  No duh.  But couldn't we have gotten to savor that precious rock n roll edge a bit more fully?  After all, as fans, we know the band survived and then some.  What would have been cooler was to hear and see that survival meaning business, taking shape, if nothing else for the revelation which was easy to miss at the time but which became clearer with The River and Nebraska, that the Boss was not just a caricature of heartland blue collar blues, but something like the next great U.S. short story writer since Ray Carver.

1381806,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B0041KKZJ6,Gregory William Locke,"[9, 9]","Like the bulk of music fans from my generation, my first impression of Bruce Springsteen was established when I was young, back when Bruce was doing the Born in the USA thing. He'd stick his underbite way out, wear skin tight jeans and headbands, stomp around on stage riffing like he was in a hair band, ride those cheesy synthlines, etc. Needless to say, I wrote the guy off before I was in high school and even figured him for some sort of idiot savant. By the time I was 20 or so I was a fan of his music, surely; but not until I saw director Thom Zimny's The Promise: The Making of the Darkness on the Edge of Town did I realize that, in his day, Bruce was as cool as anyone, and an all-around brilliant man of deep artistry.The bulk of Zimny's film is comprised of archival footage of Bruce and The E Street Band following the worldwide success of their previous album, Born to Run. Overnight, it seemed, Bruce had become a household name. His working class background forever lingering, Bruce saw the opportunity to make something that was not just better than Born to Run, but different. Next came the notebooks, then the songs, then the rehearsals, then the recording. Then more recording. Then more writing. Eventually Bruce and his band had 70+ new songs to choose from, 10 of which ended up on his now-classic Darkness record. Thanks for Zimny's film, we get to see the whole process, mixed up with recent footage of the band reflecting on the Darkness era.The Promise is one of the 10 best music docs I've ever seen, telling a great story that focuses on a great - and brilliant - leading man. The movie reminds me quite a bit of Sam Jones' film about Wilco, I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, but with a much cooler focus and much cheesier production. Had the producers and director done a better job of mixing the old footage with the new (and not used every cliche doc trick in the book), this would've been a near-perfect movie. Still, though, it's a must-see for fans of rock n' roll, pop culture, songwriting or film in general.The movie is an amazing document of a brilliant writer, music mind, band leader and thinker who was working in his artistic prime. I still can't say much for the pop star 80s version of Bruce, but damn if the struggling back alley artist of the 70s wasn't as good as they came. This film will stand as the one of the essential pieces to the Art of Bruce.Check out more of my reviews at [...]",5,Whoa!!!

I also thought they were reserved for a watershed title, for example, John Lennon's JOHN LENNON/PLASTIC ONO BAND.  Yet it is H.B.O., television's premiere network, that gives us THE PROMISE: THE MAKING OF DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, documenting the 1979 Bruce Springsteen album DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  That's right, this film is not about BORN TO RUN or BORN IN THE U.S.A., the jewels of Springsteen's career.  It's about DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, perhaps not even the third or fourth biggest L.P. in the singer-songwriter's catalog!  THE RIVER and TUNNEL OF LOVE were more successful, weren't they?Maybe that's the point of THE PROMISE: THE MAKING OF DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  Despite it being an era when recording artists released an album a year, for ethical reasons Bruce Springsteen postpones following up on his 1975 breakthrough BORN TO RUN for more than three years, the overdue work being DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  But starting with that un-catchy title, the DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN album proves more a watershed career moment for Bruce Springsteen than a bubblegum smash that gets teenyboppers dancing at the sock hop, THE PROMISE shows us.  DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is what Springsteen the artist has to make, a result of his past success and a stepping stone to the greatest commercial achievements he would have in the 1980s with THE RIVER, BORN IN THE U.S.A., and TUNNEL OF LOVE.If it sounds as though I'm knocking the DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN album please know if it is possible to rate art, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is my favorite of the ten or so Bruce Springsteen titles I own.See THE PROMISE: THE MAKING OF DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.",3,Bruce Springsteen matures the rock documentary from V.H. 1 to H.B.O.,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,1787,"['thought', 'making', 'album', 'television', 'specials', 'belonged', 'V.H', '1', 'channel', 'also', 'thought', 'were', 'reserved', 'watershed', 'title', 'example', 'John', 'Lennon', 'JOHN', 'LENNON/PLASTIC', 'ONO', 'BAND', 'H.B.O.', 'television', 'premiere', 'network', 'PROMISE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'documenting', '1979', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'right', 'film', 'not', 'about', 'BORN', 'TO', 'RUN', 'BORN', 'IN', 'THE', 'U.S.A.', 'jewels', 'Springsteen', 'career', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'third', 'fourth', 'biggest', 'L.P.', 'singer-songwriter', 'catalog', 'RIVER', 'TUNNEL', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'were', 'more', 'successful', 'were', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'point', 'THE', 'PROMISE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'being', 'era', 'when', 'recording', 'artists', 'released', 'album', 'year', 'ethical', 'reasons', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'postpones', 'following', 'up', '1975', 'breakthrough', 'BORN', 'TO', 'RUN', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'overdue', 'work', 'being', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'starting', 'un-catchy', 'title', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'album', 'more', 'watershed', 'career', 'moment', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'bubblegum', 'smash', 'teenyboppers', 'dancing', 'sock', 'hop', 'THE', 'PROMISE', 'DARKNESS', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'what', 'Springsteen', 'artist', 'make', 'result', 'past', 'success', 'stepping', 'stone', 'greatest', 'commercial', 'achievements', 'would', 'have', '1980s', 'THE', 'RIVER', 'BORN', 'IN', 'THE', 'U.S.A.', 'TUNNEL', 'OF', 'LOVE.If', ""'m"", 'knocking', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'album', 'please', 'know', 'possible', 'rate', 'art', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN', 'favorite', 'ten', 'so', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'own.See', 'PROMISE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'ON', 'THE', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'TOWN']",The Promise: The Making of “Darkness on the Edge of Town”
1381808,A2X64F7DOMZO23,B0041KKZJ6,Peter Hyatt,"[7, 16]","Having had the ""Darkness Sessions"" for many years, I looked forward to the releases but have been disappointed.Some of the songs have been ""updated"", sadly losing the freshness and rawness that was felt in the originals, but it is the DVD that is difficult to watch.It is fascinating to see young Springsteen, heavy jersey-accent devil-may-care, making the finest music of the day, but flash-foward to the older, southern-twang philosopher is painful to watch.Each emotion expressed by him is analyzed by him, as if the universe turned on his every whim.  He does self-analysis, sometimes acting like a therapist to a therapist, in a blatant narcissistic display on camera.One interesting moment is when the older Springsteen is speaking about his former manager, Mike Appel, when suddenly, he drops his southern drawl and anger flashes his eyes, and the pace of speech picks up, Jersey accent and all, unable to conceal the anger.  It was an honest moment caught among too many dishonest ones.Older fans; that is, those who were in their teens in the late 70's, will understand.  1978 wasn't a great year for music and Springsteen stood head and shoulders above the rest.  New Jerseans were proud of him, and not embarrassed by his regional accent.  The older, political egomaniac who appears to have so lost touch with reality, tries in vain to be Bob Dylan trying to be Woody Guthrie, when we were happy with him being Bruce Springsteen.  We didn't need political sermons back then, and the music, as it was then, was perfect.  Listening to the modern additions, including new guitar and vocals, reminds me of how much more valuable the originals are.Interviews with E Street Band members is interesting, but the close ups of modern Springsteen are painful to watch, especially in his self-analytical moments which dominate the DVD.

Organ ""Filly Film Fan""","[9, 13]","This release is not for the die-hard fans, rather it is for those who couldn't afford or didn't see the need for a full-blown Darkness experience.  Those who are calling it a ""double-dip"" are not seeing this for what it is: a solo release of the documentary.As for the content itself, the documentary is excellent and very much worth repeated viewings.  It is so much more than just a documentary on the creation of the album.  Rather it is about an artist who is trying to find his voice and staying true to his vision while dealing with enormous outside pressures.  Both the audio/video of the footage (new and archival) is beautifully presented in a very new and creative way.  I have to give my hats off to Thom Zimny for this excellent work, a worthy documentary on one of the most important albums in the Springsteen catalogue.The extra ""performance"" videos are okay, but  not a ""must have"" by any stretch of the word.  The band offers some good performances, but nothing coming close to ""you gotta see this!"" status.  As for the ""Talking To Fans"" video, it is nothing more than a 23 minute commercial for the documentary.  Bruce answers a few questions, but they are short and interspersed with long stretches of video from the documentary.  I saw it once, and that was more than enough; nothing that I would spend my money on to have a permanent copy.  Had they included the unedited talk with the fans, I might have considered this a likely purchase, but I don't see the need to own a commercial of a product I already own.While it would have been nice to have another '78 concert or (even better!) the Darkness album as uncompressed audio files, any addition of that nature would have created a huge ""What the...?"" from the fans who would have complained bitterly that they were not included in the box set.  Again, this release is about the documentary with some ""filler"", not an extension of the Darkness Box Set.So, I would also give this release a pass unless you (a) don't have the documentary or (b) are a frantic collector.",4,Not for the Die-hard.,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,2040,"['release', 'not', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'rather', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'full-blown', 'Darkness', 'experience', 'who', 'are', 'calling', 'double-dip', 'are', 'not', 'seeing', 'what', 'solo', 'release', 'documentary.As', 'content', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'documentary', 'creation', 'album', 'artist', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'voice', 'staying', 'true', 'vision', 'dealing', 'enormous', 'outside', 'pressures', 'audio/video', 'footage', 'new', 'archival', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'very', 'new', 'creative', 'way', 'have', 'give', 'hats', 'Thom', 'Zimny', 'excellent', 'work', 'worthy', 'documentary', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'albums', 'Springsteen', 'catalogue.The', 'extra', 'performance', 'videos', 'are', 'okay', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'stretch', 'word', 'band', 'good', 'performances', 'nothing', 'coming', 'close', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'status', 'Talking', 'Fans', 'video', 'nothing', 'more', '23', 'minute', 'commercial', 'documentary', 'Bruce', 'few', 'questions', 'are', 'short', 'interspersed', 'long', 'stretches', 'video', 'documentary', 'saw', 'once', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'nothing', 'would', 'spend', 'money', 'have', 'permanent', 'copy', 'Had', 'included', 'unedited', 'talk', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'considered', 'likely', 'purchase', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'own', 'commercial', 'product', 'already', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', ""'78"", 'concert', 'even', 'better', 'Darkness', 'album', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'files', 'addition', 'nature', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'huge', 'What', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'complained', 'bitterly', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'box', 'set', 'Again', 'release', 'documentary', 'filler', 'not', 'extension', 'Darkness', 'Box', 'Set.So', 'would', 'also', 'give', 'release', 'pass', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'documentary', 'b', 'are', 'frantic', 'collector']",The Promise: The Making of “Darkness on the Edge of Town”
