The episodes were extremely high quality and each and every story was exceptionally well done. This edition marks the END of the GUNSMOKE half-hour format, before they moved to hour-long episodes. The sparkling Black and White photography still maintains a solid visual edge, giving each episode a stark, gritty quality. The stories are also well compsoed and tightly written. I am a bit disappointed that there are no real 'extras' to be found ( except a few original sponsor commercials) but at these prices (around $20.) the overall entertainment value of these packages is so high that I really can't complain.

I can only say that I grately appreciated how the producers of this series researched that way of life before making all their episodes.  It was as true to life as possible with a touch of flare for the viewing audience.  If you want to get a taste of how life was like back in the 1800's, just watch a few episodes of Gunsmoke.  You'll appreciate all of the modern conveniences in your life a bit more.  The actors are seasoned to the series and work together like a well oiled machine.  When you work with someone for 20 years, you concider yourself almost married to them, knowing their personalities and strong points, as well as their weaknesses.  That is what made this series so special.  There was substance because of their long careers together.  It's nice to see how everyone had the same goal in mind, to make ""Gunsmoke"" as realistic as possible.  That's what made it so enjoyable for me.  You get to see how a piece of the past  really was.  It draws the viewer into it's plot with gentle persuasion and captivates you with suspense.  You feel like you are right there in the midst of it.  You will cry and laugh and celebrate their lives as you see the actors aging with grace everystep of the way.  Only a few  series, this being one of them, were able to captivate us with heart tugs and emotions as we too progressed in age right along with them.  They became our friends and to some, family.  Now I find myself watching these old programs and thinking back to my childhood, remembering how my parents would tune into their favorite show on TV every Monday evening to watch Festus and old Doc get into another fracas over Festus' wild conclusions, or when will Marshall Dillon propose to Miss Kitty, (a big unanswered question mark left  in that series). It brings me back to a happier time in my life too.  I remember when my parents were younger and able bodied and I was in grade school with lots of time to kill during summer vaction.  It was more than just a TV show to many folks. You won't see space ships blow up the earth or endless car chases all over the city, but you will see realalistic situations with real emotions of how life was for our forefathers 150 years ago.  I would like to end my review with my recommendation,  I can assure you, if you choose to purchase this series, you will not be disappointed.
