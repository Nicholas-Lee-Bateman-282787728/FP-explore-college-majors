And the movies weren't necessarily played out because Macaulay Culkin had gotten older; they were played out anyway. I guess this movie was a vehicle to lift Alex D. Linz to superstar status, which, consequently, didn't happen (have you heard from him since then?). Parts of the movie were interesting, but not many.

Here are some examples.1)  The movie has nothing to do with Kevin McCallister or any relationship with the first 2 movies.  So just because it has a kid setting traps like the first 2, is this really considered a sequel? because sequels usually have relationships to its previous films and this one didn't.2)  The bad guys in the movie are not crooks like Marve and Harry.  These guys happen to be a group of masterminds and computer geniuses that are not wanted by the police but instead the FBI.3)  It has a very bizzare plot.  The reason why the criminals are here is because of luggage mixup.  It was kind of stupid too because there bag was behind someones luggage and but comes out of the x-ray machine first and was identical to another bag.  And not only that, how could the lady who took their bag by accident have not realized it was the wrong bag.  It took the criminals less then 10 seconds to realize they had the wrong luggage.  They need their bag because it had a toy car that they hid a missil chip inside of that they need.4)  The new hero, Alex (Alex d. Linz from Max Keeble's big Move) isn't staying home alone because his family went on vacation and forgot him but because he has chicken and stays home from school and his parents have to go work.5)  An 8 year old boy takes out 4 supergeniouses.  Lets just take a minute to think WHAT IS UP WITH THAT????????  I know in the first 2 we have an 8 year old boy taking out criminals but those guys were morons.  Where dealing with people who have mini camers on their singlasses and intercept phone calls.  These guys are wanted by the FBI and they are dumb enough to get trapped by a little kid.  One trap where Alex put yarn and a wire together and hooking to a cord making it electrical.  The guy was sp stupid into cutting the wire, why didn't he just walk around it?I agree with another rviewer that this movie shouldn't have been called home alone.  It had nothing to do with the original and brought us a totally different storyline.  It is like Halloween 3.  I'll admit this movie is kind of funny but becomes boring later.  This is one product that I recommend not to get but if you do intend on watching this movie then rent it.  But if you still like then go ahead and buy this movie because this is only what I think.  There many of other people who would say this is there favorite movie.  I'm just not one of them.  It's your desicion, do what you want to do.  If you see other reviews that convince you to buy this then go ahead.

Everything else about this movie is excruciatingly awful! Home Alone 3 lacks the charm, wit, and warmth that the first two movies had. First of all, the plot is just ridiculous. It's about the same as the original, but this time, the government is involved! Yeah, it's just plain silly. Second, the booby traps are a bit creative, but really, how could a little kid come up with stuff like this? The main character from the first two films didn't create traps as complex as this. So why how does THIS kid know when to hit the mark? Third, if these villains are professionals, then why do they have a hard time defeating the kid?!

Since the villains are professionals now (and more realistic), they act serious, therefore the stunts are not as funny.

439996,A50W7ZVTG606,6304932553,"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff""","[6, 10]","I liked Home Alone. I loved Home Alone 2. I didn't think anything could possibly top the sight of Tim Curry on his knees telling a fictitious hotel patron that 'he loved him'.Boy, was I wrong.Many people seem to have taken issue with Home Alone 3 because it does not follow on directly from the 2nd film in the series. Really, is that such a huge deal? If anything, it's what made this movie work. They didn't try to make another 'Kevin' story, but went for something totally different, just using the same plot - David vs. Goliath in a house of horrors that David set up.And as for trashing Alex D. Linz in the role, please.... At least this child could act. My biggest gripe with the first two Home Alone movies was that Macauly Culkin constantly sounded like he was reading his lines straight out of the script, rather than something that was rehearsed.But back to the story. The premise of this tale is that four criminal masterminds have obtained a stolen chip, with the intention of selling it to a mega-rich (mega-dangerous) buyer.Through a totally plausible mix up at the airport, the chip (which is hidden inside a remote controlled toy car) ends up in the hands of an elderly lady. The crooks chase her all the way back to Chicago to try and recover the chip and save their own rear ends.This is another factor which worked well for the movie. Whereas with the first two films, it was funny because Harry and Marv were such an obvious pair of morons. The four crims in HA3 are supposed to be smart, which makes it so much more delicious when Alex makes idiots of them.The hero of the story, Alex, is by himself not through any family holiday mix-ups, but rather because he has chicken pox, and both parents have to work. Like Kevin McAllister, Alex is portrayed as being rather hard done by as far as his family goes. He's the butt of endless jokes and tormenting by his older brother and sister, and when he begins reporting the suspicious activity going on his neighbourhood, no one will believe him.Hence, he decides eventually to take matters into his own hands, find out just what is going on and do something about it.There are some absolutely hilarious scenes in this film. Particularly the scene when Alex sends the car with a video camera taped to the top to try and get evidence to prove he is not lying.And the inevitable confrontations in the end with the crooks have to be seen to be believed.The best parts to watch for are firstly the incident with the mouse and the iron bar. If you thought Marv's screams in Home Alone 2 (when the pigeons were attacking them) were hysterical, then this one surpasses all possible expectations. Who would have thought a grown man was capable of hitting such a perfect high note...?And secondly, the parrot is a complete crack-up. Watch for the shower scene, it's the best.Like the first two movies, this has the standard little-boy-makes-friends-with-aloof-and-outcast-neighbour ploy. The plot is basically the same in all three movies, but the introduction of a completely new cast has done wonders.This film is not the disaster that some would have you believe, and if you enjoyed the first two Home Alone movies, then it's hard to imagine that you wouldn't like the 3rd installment. Just do yourself a big favour, see it for yourself and make up your own mind.

This third installment oozes with something else other than charm. Everything that was great about the first two HA movies is absent from this movie. Not to mention that the story is much different than the first two.Plot: Some hi-tech crooks hide a microchip inside of a remote-controlled toy car. During their time in the airport, their luggage gets switched with the luggage of the crotchety middle-aged woman that lives next door to the Pruitt family. The crooks realize that their luggage has been swapped with the old woman and finds out where she lives. On arrival they meet up with the snotty scamp Alex who realizes something is wrong with them and plans to thwart them while his mother is away.Opinion: After reading the plot, you already know that this has nothing to do with the MCcallister  family. That is the least of its problems. What was fresh in the first two HA movies is now mundane. Every gag is the same: people get bonked upside the head with things and fall down. Alex D. Linz is about as bland as tofu. As a matter of fact, the whole cast is about as bland as tofu. The wisecracking parrot has more personality than these cardboard cutouts in this movie. The crooks made Harry and Marv look like geniuses. Did I forget to mention that this movie is lethally dull? Plus this movie is missing what made the first two great: Heart. This movie is emotionally distant like Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter's character in  Fight Club). Nothing about this movie is redeemable. It's all routine. You've seen it all before done better.

Macaulay Culkin looks great in this movie.  I mean, he still looks like he's 9!  That's pretty amazing.  There's a scene in here where Macaulay shoots off this guys head with a bee-bee gun.  Pretty bloody.  He overdoses on ritalin and goes through this whole drug trip where he thinks he's some soldier in Vietnam.  Powerful yet reinforces family values.

I also remember seeing this movie in the movie theater with my mom back then and she thought it was better than she expected.  I know this movie doesn't have very good reviews, but it is not always about the reviews.  It is more about your personal opinion and taste.What I like about this movie, well this movie you can play anytime.  After watching the other two home alones recently, I think they only work during the holiday season.  This movie does not take place during Christmas, so it's more a regular entertaining film.  I like the opening scene in Home Alone 3, it's epic showing high tech criminals walking together in the airport.  Although a lot of people don't think international terrorists work as well as burglars in the other Home Alone films, they were by all means interesting characters and the beginning of the movie shows it.  They look cheesy during the climax.Another thing I like about this film.  We remember how Kevin is such a bratty kid while watching Home Alone.  This kid is a much nicer kid, he seems much smarter too.  Basically, Alex would be easier to get along with than Kevin.  Alex also seems to come from a more normal family.
