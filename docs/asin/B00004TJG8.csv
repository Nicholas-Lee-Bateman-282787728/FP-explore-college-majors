They have connections to alter-egos in three of seven scientists on the moon.  After locating  the other four moon dreamers,  they decypher the dreams' true meaning.  This has a profound impact on their futures and reveals/explains latent talents in the dreamers.good parts:*This is a philosophical work which takes you on an emotional journey.  First you envy the dreamers, but then realize the dreams come at a high cost.  Intense feelings of all kinds are created with a &quot;bratty little boy&quot; character.* Uniquely a  &quot;pure shoujo&quot; love story with zero fan service or other gimmicks.* Excellent value with 6 episodes on one disc.  Plus a really nice ending theme from Yoko Kano.bad parts:*The last half of the manga (comic book) story was chopped in order to fit this in just 6 episodes.  It would have been one of the best series ever  if extended to12 episodes.  It ends giving you an empty feeling of incompleteness.overall:Even half of this excellent story is still worth buying!  Not for little kids, as they wouldn't understand the concepts in such a complex plot.  A big step up from typical shoujo anime.",4,moon dreams with no Sailor!

550343,A3VDC23HUFETP5,B00004TJG8,Jeremy Moses,"[0, 0]","It's not that I dislike all shojo. It's just that so much of it is this magical girl stuff that is really unappealing. So when I started watching this I was pleasantly surprised. By the end of the second episode, I was totally hooked. The story, of six people who dream of their past lives together living as scientists on the moon is very intriguing, as well as beautiful, and the characters that are first introduced are very well done. The whole thing was beautiful and compelling.Of course, that made it all the worse when every single story line was seemingly abandoned mid way through. Instead the show deteriorates all of a sudden into some ridiculous dragonball z like fighting scenes, and is concluded with some lengthy out of context flashback sequences that use confusing situations and extensive imagery to hide the fact that there is no ending. At this point I should mention that I know this is based on a much longer manga which tells a much more thorough story. I searched for the manga but was never able to find it, if indeed it was ever even released in the U.S. Given this lack of availability, I sort of wish that the anime told more of the story. After all, if you saw the first half of a movie and liked it but the second half was incomplete, confusing, jumbled images, you wouldn't rate it very highly. The same principle is at play here.

The story goes like this:  A group of seven kids discover that they are the reincarnations of seven alien beings who had  watched the earth for many years.  But two of the seven harbor a secret  that makes them deadly rivals.  It is a story filled with interesting  plot twists and a nearly incomprehesible finale.  Okay...it's not that bad,  but when you see it, you'll know what I mean.  The DVD has an unneeded FAQ  section that explains many points that are revealed in the serise.  I guess  it's there for those who didn't pay attention.  I suggest you use the  subtitled version of the serise, for the dubbing isn't excellent.  But  those who perfer dubs, it's not that bad.

It's a story of the reincarnation of a group of human/aliens who were stranded on the moon and are coming back as as teenagers in Japan.  Quite an interesting concept and story.  My biggest problem, however, and I hate to admit it, is keeping track of who's who.  A lot of the Japanese names sounded similar and some of the characters look similar (and there are a lot of them), so it can get confusing about who is who.  Not that in the long run it makes a big difference.  I have to say that the ending is quite anti-climactic too, but overall the whole experience of this anime was pretty entertaining.

550348,A1UXEIZAWN2VM7,B00004TJG8,"""monkeys_and_anime""","[2, 2]","I really loved this OAV. Since everyone has already pretty much summed up the story with the seven scientists living on the moon and then being reincarnated on Earth, I'll move on to the DVD itself. Well, the nicest thing of all is that this DVD contains all six episodes of the OAV which were originally on three seperate VHS tapes. The quality of the animation is amazing. The colors are crisp and bright and the character designs are absolutely gorgeous. Extra's include a section full of viz products including trailers for quite a few other anime (Yay commercials, I can't help it I'm wierd and I like watching them.), also a creditless ending (not that big of a whoop), most frequently asked questions, and a really really helpful character profile and info section. This is great because all seven scientists look TOTALLY different reincarnated, some even switching genders. It gets really confusing who is who and I found myself referring to it a few times throughout the show.The dub is pretty good as well, not the best but it didn't make me cringe like some shows.The music is also another plus. It is soooooo pretty and eerie. It sounds really cool at some parts and fits well in the scenes. The story is very good as well. It's very touching and at the same time exciting. No matter how many times I watch it I never get sick of it. I totally reccomend this show to any anime fan. It has enough action, romance, drama, and science fiction to appeal to everyone.",5,Fantastic!!,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,1474,"['really', 'loved', 'OAV', 'everyone', 'already', 'pretty', 'much', 'summed', 'up', 'story', 'seven', 'scientists', 'living', 'moon', 'then', 'being', 'reincarnated', 'Earth', ""'ll"", 'move', 'DVD', 'Well', 'nicest', 'thing', 'DVD', 'six', 'episodes', 'OAV', 'were', 'originally', 'three', 'seperate', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'quality', 'animation', 'amazing', 'colors', 'are', 'crisp', 'bright', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Extra', 'include', 'section', 'full', 'viz', 'products', 'including', 'trailers', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'anime', 'Yay', 'commercials', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', ""'m"", 'wierd', 'like', 'watching', 'also', 'creditless', 'ending', 'not', 'big', 'whoop', 'most', 'frequently', 'asked', 'questions', 'really', 'really', 'helpful', 'character', 'profile', 'info', 'section', 'great', 'seven', 'scientists', 'look', 'TOTALLY', 'different', 'reincarnated', 'even', 'switching', 'genders', 'really', 'confusing', 'who', 'who', 'found', 'referring', 'few', 'times', 'show.The', 'dub', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cringe', 'shows.The', 'music', 'also', 'plus', 'soooooo', 'pretty', 'eerie', 'really', 'cool', 'parts', 'fits', 'well', 'scenes', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'very', 'touching', 'same', 'time', 'exciting', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'totally', 'reccomend', 'show', 'anime', 'fan', 'enough', 'action', 'romance', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'appeal', 'everyone']",N/A
