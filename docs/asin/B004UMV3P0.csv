1428257,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B004UMV3P0,Adam Gagnon,"[0, 0]","A show about a serial killer that is so much deeper than it appears at first glance. The writing for the series is brilliant and the audience really feels for the protagonist. As the series progresses it does have a bit of a formula, as any TV show does, but the characters lives seem to keep going and progressing which is not always pulled off so well on a TV show. The constant conflict of characters and audience keeps the show interesting for years. The Blu-Ray transfers are excellent and the picture quality really stands out.",5,This show is fantastic.,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,533,"['show', 'serial', 'killer', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'first', 'glance', 'writing', 'series', 'brilliant', 'audience', 'really', 'protagonist', 'series', 'have', 'bit', 'formula', 'TV', 'show', 'characters', 'seem', 'keep', 'going', 'progressing', 'not', 'always', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'TV', 'show', 'constant', 'conflict', 'characters', 'audience', 'show', 'interesting', 'years', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfers', 'are', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'really', 'out']",Dexter: Seasons 1-5

But what you need to do with Dexter, and really isn't an option but mandatory WATCH THIS SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING DO NOT WATCH IT OUT OF ORDER... I cannot stress this enough notice I use capital letters in the title also.This show like many shows nowadays on Showtime and HBO and AMC arE just plain incredible and should be watched from the very beginning. Now I 1st watched Dexter 2 years ago and I watched the 1st episode of season 5 with my parents now longtime Dexter fans will know that that was a huge gigantic mistake. (That's the season after the Trinity killer) OMG was that a huge mistake so dumb, so dumb.That's all it really have to say as my warning the show is great almost every season but my order of seasons that I love the best are in this order - season 2, season 1, season 4, season 6, season 3, season 5... and I'm really stoked for season 7 it's going to be great!So few have watched this do yourself a favor and follow love with Dexter he is so great.PS this show isn't really that scary like pop out and make you jump but it does have some Gore but you get used to that after a while.",5,WARNING:  WATCH IT FROM THE BEGINNING & THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!!!,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1399,"['NOTE', 'time', 'writing', 'can', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'seasons', 'individually', 'cheaper', '150.00', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'that.This', 'show', 'amazing', 'telling', 'really', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'what', 'will', 'tell', 'next', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'Dexter', 'really', ""n't"", 'option', 'mandatory', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'SHOW', 'FROM', 'THE', 'BEGINNING', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'IT', 'OUT', 'ORDER', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'notice', 'use', 'capital', 'letters', 'title', 'also.This', 'show', 'many', 'shows', 'nowadays', 'Showtime', 'HBO', 'AMC', 'arE', 'just', 'plain', 'incredible', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'very', 'beginning', 'Now', '1st', 'watched', 'Dexter', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', '1st', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'parents', 'now', 'longtime', 'Dexter', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'was', 'huge', 'gigantic', 'mistake', 'season', 'Trinity', 'killer', 'OMG', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'so', 'dumb', 'dumb.That', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'warning', 'show', 'great', 'almost', 'season', 'order', 'seasons', 'love', 'best', 'are', 'order', 'season', '2', 'season', '1', 'season', '4', 'season', '6', 'season', '3', 'season', '5', ""'m"", 'really', 'stoked', 'season', '7', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'So', 'few', 'have', 'watched', 'do', 'favor', 'follow', 'love', 'Dexter', 'so', 'great.PS', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'pop', 'make', 'jump', 'have', 'Gore', 'get', 'used', 'while']",Dexter: Seasons 1-5
