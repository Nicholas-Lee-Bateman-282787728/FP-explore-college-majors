This show set the new standard in high quality television and was the precursor to such great shows as Ally McBeal, Boston Legal and a host of others.

1509528,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0064MMN9O,Dave. K,"[4, 7]","DVD L.A. LawThis review is for the DVD release and NOT the episodes.L.A. Law debuted on NBC back in 1986 and the first home video release comes 28-years later. With this review I'm gonna be as honest as possible and tell it like it is. When it comes to TV shows sitcoms are always the easier sale for syndication than dramas. Now obviously the older the show the less the market for it no matter how popular it was even more so with dramas since again sitcoms are more popular in syndication well outside of the Law & Order franchise that is. L.A. Law is one of my favorite shows and I know there are many other fans like myself, but lets be honest here it wasn't exactly in high demand. So this is very much one of those cases where its better than nothing. When it comes to Shout Factory the majority of the stuff I own by them is from their Scream Factory label. You gotta do what's good for business, which is why certain films they released are better than others. But some titles they put out such as X-Ray (a 1980s slasher film packed in a double feature release with Schizoid) isn't a film that will be in high demand so of course more popular cult titles will get better releases. However the DVD release for L.A. Law isn't all that great in terms of quality. Shout Factory does a nice job however in terms of features with a slew of interviews. Some might wonder will a cult film sell more than a TV series that was not only one of the most influential, but a multiple time award winner? The answer is easily a yes. We're quite passionate about cult cinema and it may sound like a surprise, but many of those films would actually be in higher demand than L.A. Law and sales will show that. However that isn't an excuse for subpar quality.I liked the first season, but felt the show got better as it went along with the 4th and 5th seasons being the best in my opinion of course. The 6th season had an ok first half and a terrific 2nd half than after that  it could be sort of hit or miss. So if you are a fan of the show like I am its very much worth a purchase. The audio is alright its nothing spectacular, but gets the job done. However the video presentation is very much lacking and very little if any restoration was done. Being 28-years old and again not exactly in high demand and not airing all that much outside of A/E than later the defunct network American Life I wasn't expecting a 5-star treatment. The video is plagued by issues many of older titles looked on DVD prior to being mastered in HD. If anyone watches older shows on non-HD cable stations well that's what you get here and in someways it might look better on network. Like many of the pre-mastered in HD titles of older films/TV shows it looks a notch or two above VHS. The DVDs ARE watchable but detail is poor at times the video has some grain and white specs as well as lines and some episodes the actors have sort of a pinkish look on parts of their faces (almost like a pink light was put on a part of their face). For anyone who watched this on American Life the video is nearly identical (if not I already explained how the older TV shows look when aired).I know it can be expensive when it comes to a restoration, but a little more work could have been put into the video. As a fan of cult cinema I've seen ultra low budget films that didn't go through a major restoration, but enough work was done and they look excellent. I love Shout Factory and I'm very grateful they put this out. I used to have a good portion of the episodes recorded, but they were ruined when my house flooded and I was devestated since there was no dvd release and at that time no release in sight. But I also feel if you're gonna do something do it properly. DVD technology has come along way since its debut (ignoring blu-ray since the set is DVD I'll only compare it to DVD). Even a lot of pre-mastered in HD films put out on DVD hold up, but L.A. Law looks like something from the early stages of DVD and its plagued by many of the issues lower budget films at times suffered from.Now I know most people reading this are thinking well is there really a point of buying it since the review was negative? My answer is YES its worth it. Despite the subpar video there are some excellent features and the video is watchable and more importantly if we want the rest of the series and other vintage shows we only get that if this sells (I have no idea what deal was made when Shout licensed the rights they may be obligated to release all 8 seasons regardless of sales).This is the best we'll get simple as that. We won't get a better DVD release and we can forget blu-ray so quality aside if you love the show its more than worth it, but Shout Factory could have cleaned up the prints a little more.As I write this season 2 is slated for May and seasons 1-4 have been released in the UK. I haven't seen them so no comment on quality and despite being a UK release, which is region 2 and some of the covers listing it as region 2 I've read conflicting reports as some say it plays others say it doesn't.Overall again I'm disappointed in the quality, but ecstatic we got season 1 and soon season 2. Here's hoping Shout Factory delivers the rest of the series.",3,Season 1 Review,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,5226,"['DVD', 'L.A.', 'LawThis', 'review', 'DVD', 'release', 'NOT', 'episodes.L.A', 'Law',

Up until that point I had never watched it  but got hooked on it every weekday afternoon on Lifetime or some channel like that.

The storylines were as great as I remembered, with twists and turns and unexpected endings. I had completely forgotten about the transexual man who stood up at Norman Cheney's funeral - shocking in the day!  I had also forgotten (and had to laugh at) those horrible synthetic material dresses/suits with the gi-normous shoulder pads that were de rigueur in corporate America in the late 80's. Jeez! I look forward to revisiting The Venus Butterfly, Kuzak's pursuit of Grace - in a gorilla suit, and the trial over the bull semen, et al.I do recall that towards the end of the series 8-year (I believe) run, signs of wear were showing.  I mean, the writers had poor Susan Dey hooked up with everyone except the plumber, and Jimmy Smits and Harry Hamlin had long vacated their roles.  But in those first several seasons, L.A. Law was the show to watch and the show we all talked about at work the next day.I am SO GLAD this finally came out on DVD.  22 hour-long (roughly) episodes - what a deal.

LA LAW was something different.This first series introduced us to the characters played by Harry Hamlin (Michael Kuzak), Jimmy Smits (Victor Sifuentes), Susan Dey (Grace Van Owen), Jill Eikenberry (Ann Kelsey), Richard Dysart (Leland McKenzie) and Corbin Bernsen (Arnie Becker) among others.This UK release of LA LAW is a worldwide first.
