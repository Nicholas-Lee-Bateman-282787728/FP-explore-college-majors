1634276,A19UFCMSFGOZ2K,B00BF0SKKQ,"Charles H. Levenson ""chubbybuns""","[0, 6]","....not good at all....&#34;In the heat of the night&#34;was a very successful movie in which a homicide detective from the north(Sidney Potrtier)is stranded in the deep south in a town called Sparta on the night of the murder of a rich white man.The bigoted police chief(Rod Steiger)at first suspects the detective,Virgil Tibbs of being the killer,based mainly on his race but then uses his expertise to solve the crime.The film was a gritty portrayal of bigoted attitudes that ultimately lead to a grudging mutual respect between the two main charectersSteiger won the Oscar for his portrayal of the policeman Gillispe..The t.v.show toned down all of the grit and realism,making Gillispie a sort of loveable curmudgeon with slightly politically incorrect racial viewpoints,while Tibbs,whose anger at the prejudice he experienced in the original film version was palpable was recast as a forgive and forget sort of a guy who just happens to accept a job working with Gillispie...Where the original film was on fire the t.v.show was just an ember...Still,once one got past all of the watering down the show succeeded as a typical 1980s police drama...Nothing really weighty or controversial,just the facts,the usual suspects,stock charecters played rather broadly.The 8th and&#34;final&#34;season was 4 really bad made-for t.v-movies,none of which had satisfactory conclusions.Gillispie the bigot has married a black politician,something the original film version Gillispie would never have done.Indeed,by the 8th season Gillispie may well have been a member of the N.A.A.C/P.given his 180degree makeover.Tibbs was long gone,the Sparta police department was happily integrated under a new police chief who was African-American,and Gillispie was sheriff of an equally happily integrated sheriff's department.So much for 1980s reality.The films present crimes and criminals but for the most part there are no conclusions to these tales.In &#34;By duty bound&#34;Gillispie is about to retire.A corrupt but popular businessman intends to take his place.Three murders take place.A suspect is arrested.END OF FILM.In&#34;Grow old along with me'an ex-policeman with a dark secret weds the local rich widow.A woman from the policeman's past emerges and threatens to spill the beans.The ex-cop and his new bride plan to murder her but their plans go very wrong and two innocent teens are killed instead.The couple is blackmailed.The ex-cop kills himself.END OF FILM.No conclusions.No wonder the show folded after this dismal last season.Sure,in real life there often are no satisfactory conclusions but given all of the re-tooling the show underwent in its transformation from film to television,and the 7 seasons in which each episode did have a conclusion these final 4 films are jarring to say the very least.",1,"Not good,,,,,",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,2803,"['.not', 'good', '34', 'heat', 'night', '34', 'was', 'very', 'successful',

1634277,A22DXI6D0FU2BP,B00BF0SKKQ,ComicMan,"[13, 13]",Season 8 of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was actually only a series of four made-for-TV movies with the same cast as the series first seven years.  The titles and chronological order of these four movies were as follows:* Season 8Episode # 143  8-01  21/Oct/94  A Matter of JusticeEpisode # 144  8-02  09/Dec/94  Who Was Geli Bendl ?Episode # 145  8-03  17/Feb/95  By Duty BoundEpisode # 146  8-04  16/May/95  Grow Old Along with MeThis DVD set contains all four HEAT movies in a nice boxed set.  Good video and audio transfers.  But there is one problem.  That problem is that three of the four DVDs are mislabeled.  The movies are listed in the correct order on the disc clamshells but only one disc - Disc # 4 has the correct number labeled on it.  Disc 4 contains the last of the four movies GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME.  The Disc labeled # 1 is actually Disc # 2 and contains the 2nd movie WHO WAS GELI BENDL?.  The Disc labeled # 2 is actually Disc # 3 and contains the 3rd movie BY DUTY BOUND.  The Disc labeled # 3 is actually Disc # 1 and contains the 1st movie A MATTER OF JUSTICE.  I suppose this is a small concern except for HEAT purists like myself.  But the manufacturers should have done a better job of quality control with the DVD labels.
