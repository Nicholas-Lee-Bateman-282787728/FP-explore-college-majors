1621100,A1KSTB85XS3TRE,B00B1RB8KW,"D. Davie ""DD""","[2, 3]","If you enjoyed A Certain Magical Index then ACSR is going to blow your mind.  They basically take place at the ""same time"" but Railgun is a segue of time from everything that took place during ACMI.  (We get to hear Misaka called ""bug zapper"" a few times by Toma, so we know they've met and whatnot and there's another couple clues that let us know it's going on at the same time as the alternate movie but I won't spoil anything.)Brittney Karbowski is already one of my favorite VA's - but what she brings to life in Misaka is truly beyond extraordinary.  She's one of the best protagonists I've seen across countless series...and that's saying something because that particular number crosses over the 4 digit mark; so I have a LOT to compare it to.  And still I can say ACSR is one of my favorites.  Throughout the entire series I was laughed hysterically, cheered on Misaka and her group friends, cried, trembled with anger, fear, sadness, gratitude and everything in between each emotion in the spectrum.  It touches on everything but doesn't linger in one spot; nor does it move across a point so quickly you don't even realize what just happened.  The recipe for storyline, characters, delivery, and artwork is truly one of the best I've ever watched.  And rewatched the moment it finished running the final episode.The stories are fresh, the humor is great...and it's mature enough most ages (save for the perpetual advances from Kuroko which might be a bit much for anyone under 13 or so) will enjoy it and everyone's favorite ""Level 5 Esper"" is able to shock the fun and rewards into any viewer who will give it a chance!!  I pre-ordered and bought both parts, sight unseen...I've never made a better ""blind"" purchase for an anime title.

1621102,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00B1RB8KW,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[3, 6]","If you are interested in this series, chances are you have seen A Certain Magical Index. This is a spinoff of that show. While Index was a pretty good series, this one is average. It doesn't really have the dramatic flair or the great characters that Index had either. Railgun follows the daily life of Esper, Mikoto Misaka. When I say daily life, I mean exactly that. Her friends and her school life, with a little action from time to time. The most interesting people in Mikoto's life were Touma and Index. They only make a few short Cameos in this spinoff.The series is divided up into several story arcs. A couple of them are mildly entertaining. One of Mikoto's friends gets hold of a device that can increase ones esper abilities. The problem is, it has a dangerous side effect. An unlikely character is also the culprit in this case. There is also an arc involving one of the Judgement members that works with Shirai (Mikoto's room mate), as she comes to terms with her past by fighting against a violent gang. Those are pretty much the highlights of the series.This series isn't bad, it's just not all that good. The production quality is very solid. The voice acting, animation, and soundtrack are well done. The story just kind of drags. Most of Mikoto's time is spent hanging out with her friends and fending off her lesbian roommate. Even the action in this series is kind of mediocre. I recommend watching it online before buying and making your decision then. I hope that the 2nd season of Index comes out soon. Hopefully this was just an attempt to buy some time until then. As far as anime goes, A Certain Scientific Railgun will probably fall through the cracks unless the 2nd season kicks some major ass.",3,Not As Good As I Had Hoped,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1722,"['are', 'interested', 'series', 'chances', 'are', 'have', 'seen', 'A', 'Certain', 'Magical', 'Index', 'spinoff', 'show', 'Index', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'series', 'one', 'average', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'great', 'characters', 'Index', 'had', 'Railgun', 'daily', 'life', 'Esper', 'Mikoto', 'Misaka', 'When', 'say', 'daily', 'life', 'mean', 'exactly', 'that', 'friends', 'school', 'life', 'little', 'action', 'time', 'time', 'most', 'interesting', 'people', 'Mikoto', 'life', 'were', 'Touma', 'Index', 'only', 'make', 'few', 'short', 'Cameos', 'spinoff.The', 'series', 'divided', 'up', 'several', 'story', 'arcs', 'couple', 'are', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'One', 'Mikoto', 'friends', 'hold', 'device', 'can', 'increase', 'ones', 'abilities', 'problem', 'dangerous', 'side', 'effect', 'unlikely', 'character', 'also', 'culprit', 'case', 'also', 'arc', 'involving', 'one', 'Judgement', 'members', 'Shirai', 'Mikoto', 'room', 'mate', 'terms', 'past', 'fighting', 'violent', 'gang', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'highlights', 'series.This', 'series', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'production', 'quality', 'very', 'solid', 'voice', 'acting', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'just', 'kind', 'drags', 'Most', 'Mikoto', 'time', 'spent', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'fending', 'off', 'lesbian', 'roommate', 'Even', 'action', 'series', 'kind', 'mediocre', 'recommend', 'watching', 'online', 'buying', 'making', 'decision', 'then', 'hope', '2nd', 'season', 'Index', 'out', 'soon', 'Hopefully', 'was', 'just', 'attempt', 'buy', 'time', 'then', 'As', 'far', 'anime', 'Certain', 'Scientific', 'Railgun', 'will', 'probably', 'fall', 'cracks', '2nd', 'season', 'kicks', 'major', 'ass']",N/A

Amazon is the only place that lists a dual audio Railgun blu-ray, and only for part 1. Other sites have only the dvds, both parts. This includes rightstuf. The only Railgun Blu-rays are the Japanese region A, which are not subtitled and have no English audio either.

1621105,AFV2584U13XP3,B00B1RB8KW,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[5, 7]","Overall if you've seen the series A Certain Magical Index then you know the character of Misaka Mikoto somewhat, a young highschool tomboyish girl with quite a temper and the electric power to back it up.  The series is pretty much of the previous mentioned series but this one focuses more on the character of Misaka and her friends who also live in Academy City. The first Kuroko Shirai who not only being a teleporter but also a member of Judgement the Academies school enforced semi-police force for the city then you have another member of Judgement as well as the third friend of the four Kazari Uiharu who while not having any powerful Esper abilities still has a keen mind and advanced expertise in computers closing the group is Ruiko Saten who is Kazari's best friend and like her has a keen mind though more interested in the latest urban legends and gossip more then anything else also Ruiko is what is called a level 0 someone who shows no discernible esper abilities during her test which leaves her somewhat disappointed.The series follows the friends during their adventures throughout the show both comedic and dramatic though the series tries to keep the drama more to a medium level so it doesn't reach the darker aspects like Death Note or Shiki.  The characters are pretty endearing for the most part but there are times where Misaka's personality comes off as a little condescending especially on the difference between power levels between espers as does Kuroko's sometimes which makes them less likable at points in the series.  The animation and soundtrack are done very well and of course the subbed and dubbed are terrific too. So if you liked A Certain Magical Index or like tough female characters then the series is a nice one to add to your anime collection just remember while the series is entertaining the overall plot is pretty generic so don't expect any originality in the main storyline....",4,Entertaining Action Comedic Series But Also One That's Pretty Generic As Well,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1928,"['Overall', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'A', 'Certain', 'Magical', 'Index', 'then', 'know', 'character', 'Misaka', 'Mikoto', 'somewhat', 'young', 'highschool', 'tomboyish', 'girl', 'temper', 'electric', 'power', 'back', 'up', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'previous', 'mentioned', 'series', 'one', 'more', 'character', 'Misaka', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'live', 'Academy', 'City', 'first', 'Kuroko', 'Shirai', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'teleporter', 'also', 'member', 'Judgement', 'Academies', 'school', 'enforced', 'semi-police', 'force', 'city', 'then', 'have', 'member', 'Judgement', 'as', 'well', 'third', 'friend', 'four', 'Kazari', 'Uiharu', 'who', 'not', 'having', 'powerful', 'Esper', 'abilities', 'still', 'keen', 'mind', 'advanced', 'expertise', 'computers', 'closing', 'group', 'Ruiko', 'Saten', 'who', 'Kazari', 'best', 'friend', 'keen', 'mind', 'more', 'interested', 'latest', 'urban', 'legends', 'gossip', 'more', 'then', 'anything', 'else', 'also', 'Ruiko', 'what', 'called', 'level', '0', 'someone', 'who', 'discernible', 'esper', 'abilities', 'test', 'somewhat', 'disappointed.The', 'series', 'friends', 'adventures', 'show', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'series', 'keep', 'drama', 'more', 'medium', 'level', ""n't"", 'reach', 'darker', 'Death', 'Note', 'Shiki', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'endearing', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'Misaka', 'personality', 'off', 'little', 'condescending', 'especially', 'difference', 'power', 'levels', 'espers', 'Kuroko', 'sometimes', 'less', 'likable', 'points', 'series', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'course', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'are', 'terrific', 'too', 'So', 'liked', 'Certain', 'Magical', 'Index', 'tough', 'female', 'characters', 'then', 'series', 'nice', 'one', 'add', 'anime', 'collection', 'just', 'remember', 'series', 'entertaining', 'overall', 'plot', 'pretty', 'generic', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'originality', 'main', 'storyline']",N/A
