224110,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6300218066,Chrijeff,"[5, 6]","One of the most frequently used, and most telling, elements of comedy is incongruity, and this is a film with plenty of it.  The title character and his adventures should be a sheer delight for everyone, and even the romantic element is so low-keyed that there should be no complaints from boy viewers about ""mush.""Paul Hogan, who wrote the original story and co-wrote the screenplay, plays Michael J. ""Mick"" Dundee, sometimes known as ""Crocodile,"" who (with his more civilized partner, Walt Reilly) runs Never-Never Safaris out of Walkabout Creek, Northern Territories, Australia.  He claims to have been raised by the local aboriginies (and does indeed join them, face painted, at a corroboree), doesn't know how old he is (""What year's this?"" he asks, when the question comes up), and doesn't know or care what the day of the week is.  He ""was sorta married once...Went out for a walkabout, I come back and she'd gone.""  He's a highly skilled outdoorsman (sometimes accused of being a ""poacher"" of crocodiles) and even seems to have some unusual abilities--he puts a water buffalo to sleep when it blocks the road his Jeep is following (""Mind over matter,"" Walt says).  New York reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), daughter of the publisher of Newsday, is in Australia doing a series of pieces, hears of one of his recent exploits (slightly inflated in the telling), and decides he'd make a good subject for a story.  Eventually she persuades him to come to New York with her, and it's there that more than half the movie occurs, along with all the humorous incongruity.  Mick Dundee is every country bumpkin who ever came to the big city, and his frankness, his ingenuous offerings of friendship to jaded New Yorkers, and his reactions to things like planes, escalators, elevators, a bidet, a black chauffeur, hookers and transvestites (when the former offer him ""one for free,"" he says, ""One what?""), New York traffic (he shinnies up a light pole at his first encounter with it, and has to be rescued by a mounted cop), and cocaine use are delightfully innocent.  Withal, he finds his bush skills not unuseful to him: he brings down a purse-snatcher with an accurately-thrown can of food, drives off a trio of muggers by pulling out his huge Bowie knife and slashing the jacket of the leader, and ""charms"" and makes friends with a pair of ferocious Rottweilers.Some of Hogan's Australian speech may be hard to understand, and the sudden attack of a crocodile on Sue (it grabs the canteen hanging around her neck) may scare some kids.  But on the whole, the movie should be a hit with all ages.  Part of Mick is ""for tourists only"": out in the bush, he switches from safety razor to his Bowie knife when Sue joins him, and after spreading out for her a feast of goanna (a native lizard), grubs, sugar ants, and yams, he cheerfully admits, ""You can live on it, but it tastes like s**t,"" and pulls out a can.  Yet he can't sleep in a bed--he makes up a doss on the floor of his hotel room--and he's careful never to hurt a fellow human being, even when driving off a group of poachers who are killing kangaroos for fun.  The first crack in his lighthearted facade shows when Sue's editor proposes publicly to her at a dinner party, and only then do we realize that he's grown to love her.  At the close he walks on heads and shoulders across a mobbed subway platform to rejoin her, and everybody cheers.

A few remember he parlayed the success from this movie into a co-hosting gig at the Oscars as well as snagging a nomination for co-scripting ""Crocodile Dundee"".  It's been twenty-odd years since I last saw this flick but it's just as good as ever.  Hogan projects an affable ruggedness that belies a certain toughness and a little bit of innocence.  Linda Kozlowski is just as appealing as the urbane reporter who brings Michael J. Dundee from the bush to the Big Apple.  The film is split into two parts, an Outback adventure and a fish-out-of-water comedy.  Both parts work equally fine and perfectly compliment each other.  Two scenes stick out for me here.  Firstly, the scene where Dundee answers a switchblade wielding thug with a massive Bowie knife.  Secondly, the scene where he shyly asks two ladies of the evening if they want to go to a movie.  I think the reason this film worked so well in 1986, where I saw it on a double-bill with ""Armed and Dangerous"", is that it was the antithesis of the cynicism of ""Rambo"".

It continues to be an absolute classic favorite today, and as I have stated in my review for the third movie in the series, it is a perennial favorite of my family's. It was one of my mother's favorite films.Everyone knows the adventures of Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, the Bushman and Outbacker who comes to America because he likes the frumpy blonde reporter (Linda Kozlowski, a bit more bright and chipper here) who has come to interview him. Croc's good mates Walt Reilly (the great John Meillon) and Aborigine Neville Bell (David Gulpilil) round out the delightful Aussie cast (obviously I excluded a few). Walkabout Creek (shot in McKinlay, Queensland), well, everyone has their own Walkabout Creek I daresay ....Further shooting there was done at The Federal Hotel in McKinlay and UDP Falls, Kakadu National Park, all in the Northern Territory.The shots of Australian Outback country - such as it is - really moves us all, especially because it reminded my parents of home and me too, a little bit, since I summered where my parents were born. The humor is 100% Hogan and brilliant as any of the old classic comedians who inspired Hogan. Who can forget Croc's Bowie knife, as Croc says to a thug, ""That's not a knife ... THIS is a knife!""What sickens me is that Paul Hogan has only done six major films if you don't count the Croc movies: ALMOST AN ANGEL, LIGHTNING JACK, FLIPPER, FLOATING AWAY, STRANGE BEDFELLOWS (vid. my review) and CHARLIE AND BOOTS. Also vid. my review of Crocodile Dundee III. Hogan is a wasted talent, sidelined quickly into sidekick status and it BLOWS. This man should have at least six Oscars, and dozens of scripts awaiting him on his desk!That is my private take on this movie anyway.

She is puzzled that her questions, about whatever positions he has on various social and political issues, do not ""ring a bell"" with him.

He thinks that bidets are for rinsing one's back. He washes his socks while he is in the bathtub, exactly as he would were he in a river. Evidently thinking that all dark-skinned people are Australian aborigines, he asks the tribal affiliations of a certain African-American cab driver. The throngs of people, crowded together, but not speaking to each other, amaze him. He climbs upon a pole to try to find his way back to the hotel. Not understanding what kind of women he is talking to, he gets into fights with the pimp. He scares off a knife-wielding mugger by pulling out his own much-bigger knife.

Paul Hogan's  movie debut and his first serious acting role - his only previous acting  experience was in comedy sketches in his Australian TV show.  This was the  movie which sparked the Aussie craze of the late 1980s in the US.  It is a  fairly innocuous fish out of water tale featuring a knockabout bushman and  a savvy American newspaper reporter.  The first half of the movie shows  reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) in the Australian outback while in  the second half the tables are turned and Mick Dundee (Hogan) finds himself  coming to grips with life in New York.  The film suffers in the  transformation to video - the spectacular scenes shot in Australia's Kakadu  National Park and the breathtaking vista of New York City are but a pale  whimper on the small screen and some of the continuity problems are  magnified, specifically the scene in the back seat of the taxi.  But they  are small beer when you consider the feel good impact of this film and its  achievement in raising the profile of Australia in the US.  Hogan became  Australian of the Year in 1987 as a result of this film and his  &quot;shrimp on the barbie&quot; tourism commercials.

224139,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300218066,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","&quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; is the entertaining 1986 film that made Paul Hogan, the Australian television star whose tourism commercials for the country that is a continent introduced Americans to the idea of throwing another shrimp on the barbie.  This movie follows &quot;the innocent abroad&quot; tradition, in which a naive person from a distant land (or planet) arrives in the big city and experiences the foibles of modern civilization through saner eyes.  Besides the Australian accent, the twist is that Mick &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee can more than hold his own against the pimps, muggers, and fiances that would make lesser mortals back down or run away.The premise is that New York City reporter Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) goes Down Under to interview the colorful crocodile poacher who lives out in the outback.  He shows her the lay of the land and does a few impressive things, including saving her life, and turns out to be as colorful as anyone could hope.  She then decides to bring him back to NYC and unleash him on the unsuspecting population.  The New York sequence is where all of the good bits in the film come and Hogan's easy charm and sense of comic timing makes almost all of the bits work.  It is hard not to like Mick Dundee and it is not surprising that a romance pops up between him and the reporter.The only problem is that the on-screen chemistry between the two leads is the weakest part of the film.  Yes, I know that Hogan divorced his wife and that in 1990 he married Kozlowski, but whatever was happening off-camera did not translate onto the screen, which is not unusual: just think about &quot;Bennifer.&quot;  It can be done, if you are Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, but all of the warmth and charm in the Hogan and Kozlowski pairing is on his side of the equation.  The result is that the final scene of the film is rather unsatisfying, even with the incessant drumming music reminding us this is dramatic.  We are supposed to be caught up in Mick and Sue, but it is the two guys on the subway platform who steal the scene.Still, &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; is an entertaining film about a big kid in a bid city (with a big knife) whose reputation would be slightly more enhanced if it had not spawned a couple of sequels, which deluted the charm of the original.  Going back to the outback or putting Mick Dundee in Los Angeles instead of New York is enjoyable, but it is just more of the same and there is never quite as good the second time around.",4,Mick &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee first visits the Big City,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,2508,"['quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'quot', 'entertaining', '1986', 'film', 'made', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'Australian', 'television', 'star', 'tourism', 'commercials', 'country', 'continent', 'introduced', 'Americans', 'idea', 'throwing', 'shrimp', 'barbie', 'movie', 'quot', 'innocent', 'abroad', 'quot', 'tradition', 'naive', 'person', 'distant', 'land', 'planet', 'big', 'city', 'foibles', 'modern', 'civilization', 'saner', 'eyes', 'Australian', 'accent', 'twist', 'Mick', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'quot', 'Dundee', 'can', 'more', 'hold', 'own', 'pimps', 'muggers', 'fiances', 'would', 'make', 'lesser', 'mortals', 'back', 'down', 'run', 'away.The', 'premise', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'reporter', 'Sue', 'Charlton', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'Down', 'interview', 'colorful', 'crocodile', 'poacher', 'who', 'out', 'outback', 'lay', 'land', 'few', 'impressive', 'things', 'including', 'saving', 'life', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'colorful', 'anyone', 'could', 'hope', 'then', 'bring', 'back', 'NYC', 'unleash', 'unsuspecting', 'population', 'New', 'York', 'sequence', 'where', 'good', 'bits', 'film', 'come', 'Hogan', 'easy', 'charm', 'sense', 'comic', 'timing', 'almost', 'bits', 'work', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'not', 'surprising', 'romance', 'up', 'reporter.The', 'only', 'problem', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'Yes', 'know', 'Hogan', 'divorced', 'wife', '1990', 'married', 'Kozlowski', 'was', 'happening', 'off-camera', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'screen', 'not', 'unusual', 'just', 'think', 'quot', 'Bennifer.', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'are', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'warmth', 'charm', 'Hogan', 'Kozlowski', 'pairing', 'side', 'equation', 'result', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'rather', 'unsatisfying', 'even', 'incessant', 'drumming', 'music', 'reminding', 'dramatic', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'Mick', 'Sue', 'two', 'guys', 'subway', 'platform', 'who', 'steal', 'scene.Still', 'quot', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'film', 'big', 'kid', 'bid', 'city', 'big', 'knife', 'reputation', 'would', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'enhanced', 'had', 'not', 'spawned', 'couple', 'sequels', 'deluted', 'charm', 'original', 'Going', 'back', 'outback', 'putting', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'instead', 'New', 'York', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'never', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'time']",N/A

She does so, and afterward a romance between them develops, and he travels back to New York City with her.

224146,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300218066,Martin Asiner,"[1, 3]","When CROCODILE DUNDEE was first released in 1986, it made a star out of veteran Australian actor Paul Hogan and the film was the surprise hit of the year.  Now, nearly twenty years later, repeated viewings have not diminshed the charm or the luster of a film that manages to work on so many different levels.  Credit must go to Hogan who wrote the screenplay and knew, as did Stallone for ROCKY, that only he could bring an instant audience identification with the mythical Likable Hero.Hogan is Mick Dundee, a resident of the Australian outback who is discovered by Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), who brings him back to New York to revel in the sin of the big city.  When she does this, Hogan is the Aussie fish out of water, but astoundingly, he blends in nicely regardless of situation or circumstance, while losing none of his infectious charm.  People just seem to like him, and those that do not (Charleton's boyfriend, the pimp, the mugger) he quickly dispatches much to the applause of the audience in the film and the audience watching it.  Director Peter Faiman wisely allows Hogan's irrespressable grin to act as a cinematic lighting rod that attracts a community blessing on everything that Hogan says or does.  Hogan as Mick Dundee permits the audience to vicariously perform feats of Outback and Central Park heroism that only a previous generation's Frank Capra could have pulled off.  One previous reviewer slammed the Hogan-Kozlowski romantic pairing as forced and one-sided.  I don't agree.  Early on, Kozlowski as Charlton shows a potent attraction to Dundee, even in the face of her looming marriage to another man.  As she sees that Dundee is a physically attractive and emotionally appealing hero of towering yet likable stripe, she gravitates toward him in a way that is predictable yet highly satisfying for that.  The closing scene on the subway platform that allows a crowd of passengers to connect the two lovers also serves as a cinematic fulcrum that bridges the gap between passive audience acceptance of romance to active audience participation of that romance.  CROCIDILE DUNDEE is as fine a mythologized hero-heroine film that has ever graced the screen.",4,"The Crocodile Man: Hero, Humor, & the Community",1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,2188,"['When', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1986', 'made', 'star', 'veteran', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', 'year', 'Now', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'have', 'not', 'diminshed', 'charm', 'luster', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Credit', 'must', 'go', 'Hogan', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'knew', 'did', 'Stallone', 'ROCKY', 'only', 'could', 'bring', 'instant', 'audience', 'identification', 'mythical', 'Likable', 'Hero.Hogan', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'resident', 'Australian', 'outback', 'who', 'discovered', 'Sue', 'Charlton', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'who', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'revel', 'sin', 'big', 'city', 'When', 'Hogan', 'Aussie', 'fish', 'water', 'astoundingly', 'nicely', 'regardless', 'situation', 'circumstance', 'losing', 'none', 'infectious', 'charm', 'People', 'just', 'seem', 'like', 'do', 'not', 'Charleton', 'boyfriend', 'pimp', 'mugger', 'quickly', 'much', 'applause', 'audience', 'film', 'audience', 'watching', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Faiman', 'wisely', 'Hogan', 'irrespressable', 'grin', 'act', 'cinematic', 'lighting', 'rod', 'community', 'blessing', 'everything', 'Hogan', 'Hogan', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'audience', 'vicariously', 'perform', 'feats', 'Outback', 'Central', 'Park', 'heroism', 'only', 'previous', 'generation', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'One', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'slammed', 'Hogan-Kozlowski', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'forced', 'one-sided', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Early', 'Kozlowski', 'Charlton', 'potent', 'attraction', 'Dundee', 'even', 'face', 'looming', 'marriage', 'man', 'Dundee', 'physically', 'attractive', 'emotionally', 'appealing', 'hero', 'towering', 'yet', 'likable', 'stripe', 'way', 'predictable', 'yet', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'closing', 'scene', 'subway', 'platform', 'crowd', 'passengers', 'connect', 'two', 'lovers', 'also', 'cinematic', 'fulcrum', 'gap', 'passive', 'audience', 'acceptance', 'romance', 'active', 'audience', 'participation', 'romance', 'CROCIDILE', 'DUNDEE', 'as', 'fine', 'mythologized', 'hero-heroine', 'film', 'ever', 'graced', 'screen']",N/A

He dragged himself to the hospital and then disappeared back into the outback.That's the story that journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) wants to get.  When she arrives at Walkabout Creek (that's in the Northern Territories), she finds Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan), a hard drinking fun loving guy who was attacked by a croc when ""fishing"".  But she has paid for his story and is going to get it.Once out on the road, she finds that Mick is different, alone.  While he still is posing for her, she gets to understand the beauty of the outback.  After a few adventures, she has her story.  But the she gets the notion to bring Mick to the Big Apple as he has never been outside of his small town.Mick is a fish out of water in NYC.  He acts just like he is at home.  But he does know when he is being made a fool.  Rather than a story, this part of the film is a series of comical misadventures. The best is when Mick and Sue are being mugged by a guy with a switchblade.  Sue says ""but he's got a knife"".  Mick ""That's not a knife, this is a knife"" and he pulls his bowie knife.Prior to this film Hogan was famous for being the ""Shrimp on the Barbie"" man.

224158,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300218066,Reviewer,"[30, 35]","One of the great things about movies is that every once in awhile the unexpected happens, something comes along that you know immediately is just a bit different and special somehow.  Usually it's the film itself, but on occasion-- and this is one of them-- a character will emerge who is not just a character in a movie, but IS the movie.  Here, it's the title character of ""Crocodile Dundee,"" directed by Peter Faiman, and starring Paul Hogan as the inimitable Mick Dundee, a rather unique individual hailing from the small hamlet of Walkabout Creek, Australia.  Mick hit the big screen in 1986, and from the first moment he appeared, right up through the end of the second sequel, it's been a ""G'day"" for audiences around the world.In Australia on assignment for her New York newspaper, journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) runs across a story she just has to pursue.  It's about a legendary ""local"" from one of the small towns on the cusp of the bush, a crocodile hunter who, the story goes, had his leg bitten off by a croc, then managed to survive by crawling, alone, for days on end across the outback.  So it's off to the town of Walkabout Creek in search of this larger-than-life character, who it turns out is quite a ""character"" to say the least.  He is, in fact, one of a kind.After a memorable meeting in the town's only pub (one of about four buildings in the whole place), Michael J. ""Mick"" Dundee agrees to take her on a tour retracing his steps and reconstructing the famous event where it actually took place.  He promises a hard journey through some rugged terrain-- no place, in fact, for a ""Sheila""-- but, like any good reporter, she's ready for anything; or so she thinks.  And it's the beginning of an adventure she, as well as the audience, will never forget.Hogan concocted the story and created the character, then wrote the screenplay along with John Cornell and Ken Shadie, after which he turned it over to director Faiman, who did a worthy, if not exceptional, job of translating Hogan's vision to the screen.  Faiman, however, is destined to be the forgotten man with regards to this project, inasmuch as he was not only necessarily overshadowed by writer/star Hogan, but he presented the film in a fairly straightforward manner, without anything particularly noteworthy that ""he"" did that would put his ""signature"" on it.  Add to that the fact that this was the first of only two films Faiman ever directed (his second was the lackluster ""Dutch"" in 1991); simply not enough to reference him, nothing added to his resume afterwards to make you take notice and say, ""Oh, yes, he directed `Dundee,' too.""  Still, filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium, and as they say, a film does not ""direct"" itself; so credit must be given where it is due, and considering how good this film is, and how well it did at the box office, it points up that whatever Faiman did, he did right.  And he deserves to be acknowledged for it.It's no secret, of course, what really makes this film work.  Aside from the engaging story with it's romantic notions of adventure, from beginning to end it has the four ""Big Cs"" going for it:  Character, Charisma, Chemistry and Charm.  Let's face it, Paul Hogan is ""The Man"" as Mick Dundee; he's the guy other guys admire and want to be (whether or not they'll admit to it), and he has the kind of natural good looks, charisma and charm that is irresistible to the ladies (whether or not they'll admit to it).  And the chemistry between Hogan and Kozlowski is irrefutable; it's the kind that makes you want to put another shrimp on the barbie.  Besides all of which there is an innate honesty about Hogan's Mick that shines through like a 1st order Fresnel light in a London fog.  He's laid-back and grounded, with a refreshingly logical outlook on life-- this guy's never going to need a pill for hypertension-- and what adds even more to his appeal is that there's a touch of larceny in his make-up, hiding just beneath that twinkle in his eye and his obvious integrity.  You also know instinctively that this is the guy you want in your corner when the chips are down.  All of this and more is what Paul Hogan captures in his performance; this is the Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee he brings to the screen.In her motion picture debut, the lovely Linda Kozlowski brings some sizzle to the screen and proves to be the perfect counterpoint to co-star Hogan.  Something of an ""Ibsenesque"" role model, she demonstrates that a woman can be strong and ultra feminine, capable yet vulnerable, and all at the same time.  It makes her portrayal of Sue Charlton convincing, well rounded and real; much more than just a cardboard cutout kind of a character that could have been used as nothing more than a vehicle to move the story along.  Instead, though this is without question Mick Dundee's story, she makes it her story, too, and it gives the film an added perspective and considerably more depth than what is usually found in light comedy, which is essentially what this film is.  And there's a look in her eye and something in the way she smiles at Mick that has an absolute ring of truth to it.  You could say, in fact, that Hogan and Kozlowski are the Bogie and Bacall of the outback.Another invaluable asset to the film is the performance of the likable John Meillon as Mick's friend, Walter Reilly.  The part is a true character actor's character, and Meillon does it beautifully.  The supporting cast includes Mark Blum (Richard), Michael Lombard (Sam), Steve Rackman (Donk) and Reginald VelJohnson (Gus).  A memorable film filled with unforgettable characters, ""Crocodile Dundee"" will take you to the top o'the world... ""down under.""",5,Nothing but Fun from the First &quot;G'day&quot; to the Last,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,5692,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'movies', 'once', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'something',

Despite that, no one could possibly make for a better character of Crocodile Dundee than Paul Hogan as Mick Dundee. Dundee survives an attack from a crocodile which nets him a great deal of publicity. A young woman who works for one of the large papers in NYC hears of his story and wants to interview him and see the land he survived on. So the movie begins with her trek to the Land Down Under, where predictably after many adventures in the brush, Dundee and the woman get a little sweet on each other. But don't let that spoil your good time. It's just getting started!

Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn&#8217;t hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she&#8217;s trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (&#8220;You call that a knife?&#8221;), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today&#8217;s standards.Overall, although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.",5,Introducing America to the Land Down Under,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,2287,"['was', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'tv', 'star', 'Australia', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'was', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'United', 'States', 'Then', '1986', 'came', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'Hogan', 'became', 'huge', 'international', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'also', 'helped', 'make', 'Australia', 'dream', 'vacation', 'destination', 'millions', 'Americans.Hogan', 'stars', 'movie', 'Mick', 'Dundee', 'part', 'Aborigine', 'crocodile', 'hunter', 'who', 'doesn', '8217', 'hunt', 'fun', 'Sue', 'Charlton', 'Linda', 'Kozlowski', 'New', 'York', 'journalist', 'assignment', 'Australia', 'coming', 'back', 'home', '8217', 's', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'local', 'man', 'very', 'small', 'town', 'Walkabout', 'Creek', 'who', 'supposedly', 'had', 'part', 'leg', 'bit', 'off', 'croc', 'managed', 'survive', 'crawled', 'out', 'Outback', 'several', 'days', 'later', 'eventually', 'man', 'who', 'story', 'about', 'take', 'journey', 'retrace', 'steps', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Australian', 'wild', 'Sue', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'turn', 'when', 'Mick', 'accompany', 'Sue', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'urban', 'jungle.Hogan', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'movie', 'also', 'created', 'story', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'chemistry', 'Kozlowski', 'exceptional', 'really', 'came', 'surprise', 'two', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'very', 'long', 'term', 'real-life', 'romance', 'other.CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'major', 'surprise', 'hit', 'when', 'first', 'was', 'released', 'Other', '1980s', 'fashions', 'Sue', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'quarter', 'century', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'great', 'well-written', 'story', 'very', 'colorful', 'characters', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'amazing', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'lines', 'became', 'catch', 'phrases', 'time', '8220', 'call', 'knife', '8221', 'also', 'humor', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'classic', 'slapstick', 'wry', 'witty', 'Also', 'are', 'few', 'adult', 'references', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'basically', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'rated', 'PG-13', '1986', 'only', 'PG', 'movie', 'today', '8217', 'standards.Overall', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'critical', 'darling', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'was', 'huge', 'popular', 'success', 'fresh', 'relevant', 'today', 'something', 'everyone', 'family', 'enjoy']",N/A

Linda and Dundee naturally start to fall in love despite the fact that she has an arrogant fiance.""Crocodile Dundee"" was released in 1986 and spawned two sequels in 1988 and 2001. It successfully combines 3 genres or themes -- romantic comedy, adventure and fish-out-of-water.What makes the film work so well is the simple charisma of Paul Hogan. You'll likely never experience a more likable protagonist. On top of this, Linda Kozlowski is both likable and lovely, possessing an attractive spirituality and intelligence.Paul and Linda have great chemistry. The chemistry is real seeing as how they would marry four years later in 1990. This is funny in light of the fact that one of Roger Ebert's main criticisms of the film was their supposed lack of chemistry. I love Roger Ebert. He's a great writer and critic, but he obviously missed it big on this one!""Crocodile Dundee"" was the most successful Australian film ever. It only runs about 90 minutes before the credits start.
