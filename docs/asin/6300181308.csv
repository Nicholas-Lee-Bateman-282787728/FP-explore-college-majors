Katharine Hepburn is his estranged wife who agrees to campaign with him for appearance sake (men who were separated from their wives would've had no chance of getting nominated). She re-falls in love with him, though she almost loses him to political shenanigans.No one could possibly believe that Tracy as the idealistic, hooray-for-democracy, honesty-is-all candidate even approaches reality, but Capra makes us want to believe. The script is tight, fast, and funny (it was a Broadway play before hitting the screen), and the all-star cast (including Van Johnson, Angela Lansbury, and Adolphe Menjou) is ""on"" all the way through the picture.

198908,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6300181308,Christopher Schwinger,"[1, 1]","This is the last political movie Frank Capra made and the last one for me to see.  It's adapted from a play, so there's no way for it to be as monumental as Meet John Doe or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, but the powerful acting of especially Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and Capra's fast-paced direction, make it powerful nonetheless.  Hepburn and Tracy had perfect rapport, and this was their 5th out of 9 movies.  The story is about the compromises a straight-talking/forthright American businessman (Tracy) makes to try to become the Republican nominee for President.  Behind his campaign are a shrewish newspaper giant (Angela Lansbury) and a campaign manager who feels sidelined (Adolphe Menjou).  Ultimately, it ends happily and makes a powerful statement about the attitude of party establishment.  I'm sure you can think of candidates in recent time who have been touted by the media as the ""inevitable"" nominees.  What happened to letting the people decide?  This movie is therapeutic for showing that the desperate attempts of the media to play God with the country will not ultimately triumph.  I strongly recommend it for that.  It encouraged me to hope that even when everyone seems to be compromising, good sense may yet return.  The only thing that weakened it in comparison to Meet John Doe, my favorite Capra movie, was that Tracy's character has too optimistic an attitude about human nature, saying that man is evolving higher and higher in his potential and that a world government stronger than the UN is needed to ensure world peace.  (American humanistic optimism was a lot stronger in the late 40s than it is today, because we hadn't experienced catastrophes on our home territory since the Civil War, whereas Europe had been devastated by two world wars.  The 60s put a damper on American humanism, through the JFK assassination, Vietnam, and homeland riots.)

198909,A213KQ65OELF7R,6300181308,Commander Adama,"[12, 13]","&quot;State of the Union&quot; may not be one of Frank Capra's best films, nor is it the best pairing of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, one of Hollywood's greatest couples (both on-screen and in real life). However, it is still excellent entertainment, and it's also a great political satire that still resonates even today. Grant Matthews (Tracy) is a nationally-known, flamboyant businessman who has made a fortune building airplanes, and still flies them (and even jumps out of them playing &quot;games&quot; with other pilots to see who can parachute to the ground first). He is having an affair with Kay Thorndyke (a deliciously manipulative, cold-blooded and lovely Angela Lansbury), the powerful publisher/owner of a national chain of newspapers. The affair has caused him to separate from his wife (Hepburn), who still loves him and hopes that he comes to his senses regarding Kay. When Thorndyke is unable to force her will onto the leading candidates for the 1948 Republican presidential nomination, she decides to go all-out to make her lover Matthews the GOP's presidential candidate. She talks the reluctant Matthews into getting into politics by telling him that he &quot;owes it&quot; to the people to share his &quot;idealism&quot; and talents with them. Of course, behind the scenes she cares nothing for Matthews' high ideals - she intends to make him President and then control the nation through him. Instead, Kay hires a corrupt but experienced GOP political &quot;boss&quot; named Jim Conover (Adolphe Menjou) to be Matthews' campaign manager. Conover clearly sees Matthews as merely a vehicle to regain power in Washington, and he also comes to see Matthews' idealism and honesty as an obstacle to his plans. Kay also hires her star reporter, the cynical but charming &quot;Spike&quot; McManus (a delightful Van Johnson) to be Matthews' press secretary. In a real show of chutzpah, Kay even convinces Matthews' estranged wife to stay with him on the campaign trail to present the image of a happily-married couple. As the plot develops, Matthews is slowly corrupted by Conover and his political cronies, but in the end his wife brings him back to his good senses. The film's climax - in which Matthews tries to deliver a speech announcing his presidential candidacy on national television while his angry, drunken wife gives his mistress a verbal thrashing - is one of the finest (and funniest) moments in any Hepburn-Tracy movie. As another reviewer pointed out, this film is what H. Ross Perot's first presidential campaign in 1992 could have been had he not turned out to be a few bricks shy of a full load. The notion of an idealistic and honest political &quot;outsider&quot; giving the corrupt &quot;insiders&quot; their comeuppance is an old but powerful theme in American politics - and Spencer Tracy's Grant Matthews is a perfect symbol of what we'd like for our leaders to be - honest, colorful, dynamic, idealistic, and more devoted to the good of the nation than to himself. Hopefully, someday we'll get leaders in real life who can match what we see on the movie screen. Until then, however, &quot;State of the Union&quot; makes a fine substitute.

The subject is well suited to filmmaking legend Frank Capra, who made the classicMr. Smith Goes to Washingtona decade earlier and echoes a similar theme of an honest man surrounded by those who tear at his ethics. Adapted by Anthony Veiller and Myles Connolly from a play by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay, the plot centers on Grant Matthews, a pulled-from-his-bootstraps industrialist who has not lost touch with the common folks, a quality seized upon by Machiavellian newspaper publisher Kay Thorndyke, who uses her considerable media power to shape him into a viable candidate for the presidency.Thorndyke also happens to be Matthews' lover, even though he is still married to stoic, disillusioned Mary, his estranged wife who has remained in the marriage not only for the sake of their two children but also in the dimming hope that he will come back to her. Initially, Matthews balks at the idea of becoming President, but he recognizes an ambition to improve the country. At the same time, Thorndyke and her cohort, proto-Karl Rove political advisor Jim Conover convince him to make compromising speeches to win the votes of powerful lobbies. If you know Capra films, you know how it will all turn out. The main problem I had with the film is the pacing and the relative inconsistency in tone. Much of the time, it feels truncated with little transition between scenes, and farcical moments are mixed with more serious ones in ways that make the film feel emotionally askew at times.The performances can't be faulted. Spencer Tracy is well cast as the plainspoken Matthews, while Katharine Hepburn lends her much-needed verve and snap to the cautiously hopeful Mary. All of 22 but looking far more commanding and mature, Angela Lansbury almost steals the picture as Kay, even though her character is so venal and humorless that it is hard not to hiss when she's onscreen, especially with her dragon-lady cigarette holder. It's easy to see the future Mrs. Iselin in John Frankenheimer'sThe Manchurian Candidate. Adolphe Menjou plays Conover in his typical blowhard manner, while Van Johnson is unctuous in a likeable sort of way as reporter Spike McManus. Capra lays out his familiar flag-waving cornpone thickly here, sometimes quite effectively, but the attempts at slapstick humor are pretty laborious. This remains an interesting curio in his canon.

In fact, I'd say it is hell, for many people in politics. People mistakenly call this a ""satire"". It is a comic drama, nearly incomparable as to its genre: it is also a political drama (the best one I've ever seen).One thing that is missed about this sharp, super-advanced film is that it is indeed a Democratic jab at the Republican jugular--in the most satisfying way, by making all the characters slimy, back-shooting Republicans.Today is November 4, 2010. The House has just gone back into Republican hands and the Democratic Senate is left barely hanging onto its majority. Want to know how all this really works, from the dinky local elections to the primaries?Watch STATE OF THE UNION--and accept no substitutes.Spencer Tracy is at his level best playing airplane tycoon Grant Matthews. He gets conned into leaping for the Republican nomination to run in the 1948 election by his lover, Kay Thorndyke (a shocking portrait of evil by a young Angela Lansbury).Though Matthews starts off right--as a non-politician and regular guy type--he's swept into it as he ""catches the bug"" for the presidency. His estranged wife Mary (a very lustrous, deep, agonized performance by Katharine Hepburn) re-renters the picture to support him.I do not have to tell anyone from any walk of life what happens next: all I need to say is this is a hyperrealistic picture of political games, the throwing aside of democracy in exchange for corruption and what a stellar cast! Adolphe Menjou...Van Johnson in one of his finest roles...Charles Dingle...and the way Capra uses the bit-players as well as forgotten ones!Mm, mm, mm. GOOD movie. It isn't everyday you can learn civics, government and politics all in one shot, and especially not in a movie. True, Capra facilitates the lesson by caricaturing certain elements (i.e., the mouthy old lady who allegedly stands up for minority voters).You need no more from me...get this, cherish it as one of our truly great films of all time. And one of the most ignored. Forget that it has jokes about old guys who are still left over from President Harding's era. Forget that Republicans and Democrats were a bit different back then.Remember only this: you'll go a looong way without finding a better two hours in front of the tube!HOUSEKEEPER TO MATTHEWS: ""Hope you like this room.

Not just by Tracy and Hepburn's charm, but by the script as well. It speaks of issues which are still relevant today. Tracy's comments on capitalism etc. can make some people happy even today while may invite wrath of others, again even today! One may say, Tracy was not bi-partisan even before nomination!However, the script deals the nomination process in a too simplistic way to brush the people involved in black and white! The film correctly says that 'people may like you, but its the politicians who send nomination'. However the nomination process is bound to become extremely complex with so many interests, from so many people - with varying ideas -  involved in, often crossing the paths of one another, which may necessitate difficult maneuvering while at the same time keeping the electorate happy and opposition at bay. The film depicts it in rather simple and overt manner. Here it reminds the final scene of 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'. Also, that a single young lady owning a newspaper can pull so many strings of a national political party - in any age - in difficult to believe. The way Tracy changed his stance just after a brief side-room meeting with the lady publisher is probably the weakest point of the movie. Equally jarring is his return to his own self, influenced by his wife, brilliantly played by Hepburn.

It's the story of a  businessman played by Spencer Tracy who gets talked into running for  President, and along the way he loses his ideals and begins playing the  games, under the familiar but false assumption that he'll just do it until  he gets elected.  Katharine Hepburn stars as his wife and conscience, a  woman who wants him to speak the truth and say what's really on his mind,  win or lose.  Tracy and especially Hepburn are excellent in their roles,  making a lot of dialogue sound fresh and real.  Angela Lansbury is cold but  convincing as a newspaper syndicate owner who is a behind the scenes player  in the political game, pushing Tracy (with whom she's in love) into the  presidential race.  Van Johnson is a lot of fun as the aide with the dry  sense of humour and realistic approach to everything.  There's a good mix  of laughs with dramatic moments, and surprisingly, the message behind the  movie remains very current and rings true, over fifty years after the film  was made.

198923,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300181308,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 16]","Hollywood always seems to produce better Presidents and candidates for President than the real world, which is certainly the case with this 1948 Frank Capra film.  Spencer Tracy plays Grant Matthews, who is persuaded by his mistress, powerful publishing heiress Kay Thorndyke, played to the hilt by Angela Lansbury, to seek the Republican nomination.  Katharine Hepburn plays Mary Matthews, who joins her estranged husband to present a public portrait of a happy family.  With the aid of the conniving political boss Jim Conover, played by Adolphe Menjou, Matthews begins the long road to the White House.Based on the Pulitzer-prize winning play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, you can still get a sense of the original three-act structure of the story.  Act I in a Washington, D.C. bedroom in the house of political operative Jim Conover is where Matthews is convinced to try running for President and his wife is persuaded that this is as much a chance to save her marriage as it is to advance her husband's campaign.  Act II in a hotel room in Detroit is where Matthews begins sacrificing principles for political expediency in his quest to gain the White House.  Act III takes place in the Matthews home on the night of a national radio address, when everything finally comes to a head.  From this perspective you have to credit scenarists Anthony Veiller and Myles Connolly with have done an excellent job of adapting the play to the screen.  There are a lot of little jokes at the expense of the politicians in both parties in 1948, which will probably be lost on contemporary audiences; in fact, while on Broadway the political jokes were updated weekly.  Certainly the particular brand of &quot;Republicanism&quot; offered by candidate Matthews, with his belief in the ultimate formation of a United States of Earth, sounds much more like what we would consider left-wing politics today.As with most Capra films the acting is a delight from top to bottom.  Tracy has several of those earnest speeches about America that make you shake your head when you look at Bore and Gush, while Hepburn tries to deal with both her husband's political amibitons and the other woman in his life.  Lansbury's cold and calculating performance foreshadows the monstrous creature she plays in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;  Van Johnson as Spike McManus is pretty much the weatherwave of the story and there is a marvelous moment when Johnson makes a sarcastic quip and Tracy turns and says, &quot;I haven't quite made up my mind about you yet.&quot;  Howard Smith, Margaret Hamilton and Lewis Stone all have marvelous bit parts as well.  Capra was always more concerned with the people who played his characters more than art direction or shot composition.  &quot;State of the Union&quot; is rarely considered one of Capra's best works simply because he had less of an impact than usual because it was based on such a successful play, but it is certainly in keeping with the ideological perspective of more celebrated Capracorn films such as &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.&quot;Final notes: &quot;State of the Union&quot; was originally slated for Capra favorite Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert.  Tracy was signed instead of Cooper and when Colbert pulled out at the last moment Tracy suggested Hepburn, who had been rehearsing with him, as the obvious replacement.  There are a few suspicious souls who believe that Ronald Reagan lifted his infamous &quot;I'm paying for this microphone' line in the 1980 primaries from Tracy's final outburst in &quot;State of the Union.&quot;  Make up your own mind on that one.",5,Tracy and Hepburn do a Capracorn film,973382400,"11 5, 2000",2000,3654,"['Hollywood', 'always', 'produce', 'better', 'Presidents', 'candidates', 'President', 'real', 'world', 'certainly', 'case', '1948', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'film', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Grant', 'Matthews', 'who', 'persuaded', 'mistress', 'powerful', 'publishing', 'heiress', 'Kay', 'Thorndyke', 'played', 'hilt', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'seek', 'Republican', 'nomination', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Mary', 'Matthews', 'who', 'estranged', 'husband', 'present', 'public', 'portrait', 'happy', 'family', 'aid', 'conniving', 'political', 'boss', 'Jim', 'Conover', 'played', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'Matthews', 'long', 'road', 'White', 'House.Based', 'Pulitzer-prize', 'winning', 'play', 'Howard', 'Lindsay', 'Russel', 'Crouse', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'sense', 'original', 'three-act', 'structure', 'story', 'Act', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'bedroom', 'house', 'political', 'operative', 'Jim', 'Conover', 'where', 'Matthews', 'convinced', 'try', 'running', 'President', 'wife', 'persuaded', 'as', 'much', 'chance', 'save', 'marriage', 'advance', 'husband', 'campaign', 'Act', 'II', 'hotel', 'room', 'Detroit', 'where', 'Matthews', 'sacrificing', 'principles', 'political', 'expediency', 'quest', 'gain', 'White', 'House', 'Act', 'III', 'place', 'Matthews', 'home', 'night', 'national', 'radio', 'address', 'when', 'everything', 'finally', 'head', 'perspective', 'have', 'credit', 'scenarists', 'Anthony', 'Veiller', 'Myles', 'Connolly', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'adapting', 'play', 'screen', 'are', 'lot', 'little', 'jokes', 'expense', 'politicians', 'parties', '1948', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'lost', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'fact', 'Broadway', 'political', 'jokes', 'were', 'updated', 'weekly', 'Certainly', 'particular', 'brand', 'quot', 'Republicanism', 'quot', 'offered', 'candidate', 'Matthews', 'belief', 'ultimate', 'formation', 'United', 'States', 'Earth', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'left-wing', 'politics', 'today.As', 'most', 'Capra', 'films', 'acting', 'delight', 'top', 'bottom', 'Tracy', 'several', 'earnest', 'speeches', 'America', 'make', 'shake', 'head', 'when', 'look', 'Bore', 'Gush', 'Hepburn', 'deal', 'husband', 'political', 'amibitons', 'other', 'woman', 'life', 'Lansbury', 'cold', 'calculating', 'performance', 'monstrous', 'creature', 'quot', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate.', 'quot', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Spike', 'McManus', 'pretty', 'much', 'weatherwave', 'story', 'marvelous', 'moment', 'when', 'Johnson', 'sarcastic', 'quip', 'Tracy', 'turns', 'quot', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'yet.', 'quot', 'Howard', 'Smith', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Lewis', 'Stone', 'have', 'marvelous', 'bit', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'Capra', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'concerned', 'people', 'who', 'played', 'characters', 'more', 'art', 'direction', 'shot', 'composition', 'quot', 'State', 'Union', 'quot', 'rarely', 'considered', 'one', 'Capra', 'best', 'works', 'simply', 'had', 'less', 'impact', 'usual', 'was', 'based', 'successful', 'play', 'certainly', 'keeping', 'ideological', 'perspective', 'more', 'celebrated', 'Capracorn', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Meet', 'John', 'Doe', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington.', 'quot', 'Final', 'notes', 'quot', 'State', 'Union', 'quot', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'Capra', 'favorite', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Tracy', 'was', 'signed', 'instead', 'Cooper', 'when', 'Colbert', 'pulled', 'out', 'last', 'moment', 'Tracy', 'suggested', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'rehearsing', 'obvious', 'replacement', 'are', 'few', 'suspicious', 'souls', 'who', 'believe', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'lifted', 'infamous', 'quot', ""'m"", 'paying', 'microphone', 'line', '1980', 'primaries', 'Tracy', 'final', 'outburst', 'quot', 'State', 'Union.', 'quot', 'Make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'one']",N/A

She decides to wholeheartedly back Grant's run for the nomination all the while fighting back the rumors of his unfaithfulness and the influence of the ruthless Thorndike. This begins the tug of war between Mary and Thorndike as to how the campaign should be run - total honesty and openness or politically shrewd playing all sides. It would be hard not to have an entertaining film, especially about such a hot topic, with the stars involved and under the direction of Frank Capra. A lesser known gem of Tracy and Hepburn, this is a great time to pull it out and watch. Maybe there is still a Grant Matthews lurking out there that we could nominate. For aviation buffs, there is a great scene where a couple of Grant's test pilots pull up alongside the campaign plane and challenge him to a little game of 'chicken' in the air.

Tracy and Hepburn are of course great in the lead roles, but Capra allows many supporting actors to shine through in ways other directors would miss, notably Angela Lansbury, Van Johnson, Adolph Menjou, and many others. Despite the political cynicism, the Capra belief in the ultimate goodness of man can be seen here in his faith in the little guy, the common man who the politicos and power brokers in this movie are constantly trying to dupe and scheme against. Add to that some improbable but immensely entertaining scenes of stunt flying by the dark horse candidate Tracy (who was an aeronautical executive before he got into politics) and you have as entertaining a movie as you could want.

Evans ""Content Maven behind meryl.net""","[3, 5]","A movie is almost guaranteed success with names like Frank Capra, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Angela Lansbury involved. This classic film digs into the world of dirty politics, broken marriages and idealism. Granted, State of the Union won't be remembered as one of the best Capra films or Tracy/Hepburn pairing, but it's still a gratifying classic film.We meet Kay Thorndyke (Angela Lansbury) when she comes to see her dying father. Her father admitted he wanted a boy, but he got more with daughter Kay, a manipulative and cold, calculating woman. Lansbury played the role perfectly making it easy for the audience to despise her in spite of knowing the sweet characters she came to be known for in later years. Lansbury later deliciously played another frighteningly ruthless character in the political thriller, The Manchurian Candidate.Kay takes over her father's newspaper business, determined to help someone become the President of the United States so she can gain control that comes with the job. She picks her lover, Grant Matthews (Spencer Tracy), a businessman who builds and flies airplanes, a reluctant candidate with high ideals which she uses to convince him to run.Kay hires the equally shrewd and corrupt Jim Conover (Adolphe Menjou), a man with campaign experience, to manage the campaign. Also on board is Spike McManus (Van Johnson), a star reporter from Thorndyke's newspaper to provide the comedy relief and a little goodness to this nasty team. The team convinces Grant's estranged wife Mary Matthews (Katharine Hepburn) to join him on the campaign trail portraying themselves as a happily-married couple.Ironically, though the team picks Grant as the candidate because of his idealism, it's that same characteristic that creates a problem for Conover and the campaign. The campaign hits bumps along the way as Grant loses his connection with the American public, Mary tries to convince Grant to stick with his beliefs, Conover and Thornydyke are determined to control every aspect of the campaign, and Grant continues to put his wild flying skills to use.Although some of the dialog is weak, the powerful first-rate cast combined with a decent storyline make State of the Union amusing and worth watching.

Spencer Tracy stars as Grant Matthews, an idealistic business man with no notions of getting into politics.  Enter Elenor Thornedyke, a hardened newspaper woman, with dreams of finding a canidate for president that she can control.  Knowing the married Matthews has feelings for her, she uses them to make him see his chances to become president.  And even though they have a strained marriage, even his wife, Mary, can see what a good president he would make.  So he decides to run.  Grant starts off strong by speaking the truth and not playing politics, but soon Thornedyke strikes at him and causes him to make compromises.  Again and again, he begins to speak with politics rather than his convictions, and it tears him down piece by piece.  Frank Capra in this film uses an equal balance of comedy and drama to make this film work.  And as always, he appeals to the patriotic side of Americans, and makes you love our country despite it's faults.  Not quite as classic as his Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or You Can't Take it With You, but still a worthy film that beats most films that can be made today.

Tracy is a highly successful airplane manufacturer who is approached to run for President of the U.S.  He seems like an ideal candidate - full of common sense and integrity.  However, it turns out that he's less than perfect; he's estranged from Hepburn and carrying on an affair with a king-maker newspaper publisher, played by Angela Lansbury.  Tracy realizes that if he is to run for President, he needs Hepburn by his side.  The two reunite tentatively, and Tracy's initial speeches strike a chord with the ""common man.""  Unfortunately, as Lansbury becomes more involved, Tracy changes in some rather ominous ways.""State of the Union"" is not one of the better known Hepburn-Tracy pairings, such as ""Adam's Rib"" or ""Woman of the Year.""  However, it is every bit as good as these classics.  Frank Capra directed the film - it's his follow-up to ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Like that movie, ""State of the Union"" is a bit idealistic and has a rather mushy denouement.  However, along the way, the script (adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse) makes some rather insightful comments on politics and human relations and contains some crackling witty dialogue.  Much of this material is still relevant today, 60 years after the fact.Hepburn is charming and beautiful as the betrayed wife, and Lansbury is the portrait of cold-blooded calculating ambition.  It's hard to believe that Lansbury was only 23 years old when ""State of the Union"" was made.  Another interesting aspect of the film is the obvious parallels to the Hepburn-Tracy relationship.  It was a poorly kept secret that they were having an affair starting in the early 1940s which continued until Tracy's death in 1967, although the staunchly Catholic Tracy never divorced his wife.  Hepburn acting wounded because Tracy has a mistress while she was in fact his real mistress - well it makes the mind boggle a bit!
