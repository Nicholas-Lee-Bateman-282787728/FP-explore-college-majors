In that episode his roommate was Mike Paxton, but only for a couple of days and to me that doesn't qualify as a college roommate. He also stayed at college every now and then, but they never said who his roommate was, but tome that also doesn't qualify as a college roommate. Also I don't remember the family ever meeting Mike Paxton, yet not only did John Boy say in his letter that Mike Paxton was close to the Waltons, the family had rememberences that never happened.

Everyone in the Walton clan is affected -- John, now in great demand with his lumber for government work; John-boy, off in London as a correspondent; Mary Ellen, whose doctor husband Curt is stationed at Pearl Harbor; Jim-Bob, who dreams of enlisting and becoming a pilot; Jason, who begins to feel he might be a conscientious objector to the war itself. The others find the war invading their everyday life, from shortages to more work to overall worry and fear.There are also a number of episodes featuring other mountain residents and their lives -- the discrimination still faced by Verdie Foster and her family; growing marital and personal problems between Ike and Corabeth Godsey; and the revelation of a long-buried secret for Miss Emily Baldwin.Life may be changing drastically for the Waltons, but one thing remains steadfast -- viewers can be assured of quality episodes about the tight-knit family they've enjoyed watching in seasons past.Still, there are countless life (and mountain) traditions and situations that endure reassuringly, even in the face of war and hardship. Now 13, Elizabeth is struggling with her feelings about growing up -- often resulting in turmoil, as seen in ""The Changeling"" and ""The Yearning."" Mary Ellen, mother of baby John Curtis, struggles to balance her nursing career with raising her son.

This meant Zebulon was also &#34;killed off&#34; the show. The season opens up with The Empty Nest which focuses slightly on this topic.Besides that, season 7 brings a whole array of change on Walton's Mountain. John-Boy is still in NYC so he's not in this season at all. It's 1941, and Japan has dropped a bomb on Pearl Harbor, killing many (an important character is killed here too but I won't spoil it). This triggers America's entrance into World War 2, which will serve as the show's main plot  until the 9th and final season. Grandma is back from the hospital after suffering a lethal stroke, now barely able to talk and getting only temporary screen time. After this season, she seems to disappear, presumably going under more medical care.Season 7 also introduces some new people, like J.D. Pickett, Erin's new employer as she tries to help in the war effort. I personally hate J.D and think he's annoying. Also introduced in this season is Ben's suddenly pronounced wife, Cindy. At first this new marriage seems doomed to failure but it works.All these new happenings on Walton's Mountain may seem like a shock. They did when I first saw this season. This season sees the show transitioning from the family atmosphere to a more mature/war one. The show feels empty without Grandpa and barely featuring Grandma.

1135345,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B00127IU4S,"kone ""kone""","[4, 4]","This is the seventh of nine seasons of ""The Waltons"", a family-oriented drama set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. This season originally aired in 1978. This is the first full season without the central character of John-boy Walton. During the first five seasons, John-boy was the focus of the show, as he is the narrator, and his journals and writings are the source of the individual episodes. John-boy leaves his mountain home at the end of season five, and appears for several episodes at the end of season six. With John-boys absence, the show now focuses on the other members of the Walton family (and friends). In my opinion, this season is the first where the writing suffers a bit. To be sure, there are some very good episodes in this season, but there are several episodes which lack the quality and feeling typical of earlier Walton seasons. Even with an ""uneven"" season in terms of quality, these episodes are still worth watching (and owning), as they deal with real family and personal issues in a humane and loving way. The Waltons is a classic TV series that beat the odds, in that it had a loyal audience without resorting to special-effects, gratuitous violence, or overt sexual themes. It is entertainment with a message suitable for the entire family. I watch The Waltons with my children and they love the shows. Walton time is family time.Three episodes stand out in my mind as exceptional. The first is a touching two-part episode devoted to the death of Grandpa Zeb Walton (Will Geer), who died between seasons six and seven. This is a touching episode that will bring tears to every viewer. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) who suffered a real-life stroke, reprises her role as Grandma Esther Walton, and her long life with Zeb is recounted in flashbacks. Each of the grandchildren say goodbye to Grandpa Zeb in their own touching way.The ""Day of Infamy"" is another major highlight as Pearl Harbor is attacked and Mary-Ellen's husband, Curt, is apparently killed. Judy Norton gives a profound performance in a sorrowful episode.The third episode that stands out is ""The Parting"". In this episode, Oliva Walton learns she has tuberculosis and has to go away for treatment. Oliva will make only guest appearances from this point on in the series. Saying goodbye to a loving mother is a heart-rending experience.It is truly a treat to watch the Walton children grow up and deal with the associated problems of maturity and living in the throes of the beginning of America's entry into World War II. Although not the quality of previous seasons, this is still quality tv and is highly recommended.Jim Konedog Koenig",4,1941 - A Year of Infamy on Walton's Mountain,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2641,"['seventh', 'nine', 'seasons', 'Waltons', 'family-oriented', 'drama', 'set', 'Blue', 'Ridge', 'Mountains', 'Virginia', 'season', 'originally', 'aired', '1978', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'central', 'character', 'John-boy', 'Walton', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'John-boy', 'was', 'focus', 'show', 'narrator', 'journals', 'writings', 'are', 'source', 'individual', 'episodes', 'John-boy', 'mountain', 'home', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'several', 'episodes', 'end', 'season', 'six', 'John-boys', 'absence', 'show', 'now', 'other', 'members', 'Walton', 'family', 'friends', 'opinion', 'season', 'first', 'where', 'writing', 'bit', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'lack', 'quality', 'feeling', 'typical', 'earlier', 'Walton', 'seasons', 'Even', 'uneven', 'season', 'terms', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'deal', 'real', 'family', 'personal', 'issues', 'humane', 'loving', 'way', 'Waltons', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'beat', 'odds', 'had', 'loyal', 'audience', 'resorting', 'special-effects', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'overt', 'sexual', 'themes', 'entertainment', 'message', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'watch', 'Waltons', 'children', 'love', 'shows', 'Walton', 'time', 'family', 'time.Three', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'exceptional', 'first', 'touching', 'two-part', 'episode', 'devoted', 'death', 'Grandpa', 'Zeb', 'Walton', 'Will', 'Geer', 'who', 'died', 'seasons', 'six', 'seven', 'touching', 'episode', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'viewer', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'Grandma', 'Walton', 'who', 'suffered', 'real-life', 'stroke', 'role', 'Grandma', 'Esther', 'Walton', 'long', 'life', 'Zeb', 'recounted', 'flashbacks', 'grandchildren', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Grandpa', 'Zeb', 'own', 'touching', 'way.The', 'Day', 'Infamy', 'major', 'highlight', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'attacked', 'Mary-Ellen', 'husband', 'Curt', 'apparently', 'killed', 'Judy', 'Norton', 'profound', 'performance', 'sorrowful', 'episode.The', 'third', 'episode', 'out', 'Parting', 'episode', 'Oliva', 'Walton', 'tuberculosis', 'go', 'away', 'treatment', 'Oliva', 'will', 'make', 'only', 'guest', 'appearances', 'point', 'series', 'Saying', 'goodbye', 'loving', 'mother', 'heart-rending', 'experience.It', 'truly', 'treat', 'watch', 'Walton', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'deal', 'associated', 'problems', 'maturity', 'living', 'throes', 'beginning', 'America', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'not', 'quality', 'previous', 'seasons', 'still', 'quality', 'tv', 'highly', 'recommended.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",The Waltons: Season 7
