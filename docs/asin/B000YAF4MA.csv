Sweet, sage, and funny, Rob Reiner delivers another heartwarming gem that's rejuvenating to watch.They couldn't be more opposite.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy owner of hospitals where the frills are fleeting at best.  ""We run hospitals, not health spas,"" Edward brashly tells his potential clients.  ""Two guests to a room, no exceptions.""  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is mild and wise.  He is a mechanic at a garage supporting his family, but is an academic at heart and a trivia expert who would make Cliff Claven blush.  A fellow colleague is always trying to stump him with questions from a trivia book, and Carter's favorite past time is to blurt out the answers (questions really) while watching 'Jeopardy'.You guessed it.  They both have cancer and have to share a room in one of his hospitals.  Thomas* (whose real name is Matthew, but is too hard for Edward to keep track of) is his assistant.  He can't have his own room because it would be bad PR not to follow his own rules.  Edward does get top service by his doctor (Rob Morrow who plays a far different MD than he did on `Northern Exposure'.)  The odd couple take a while to warm up to each other.  Each is absorbed in his own interests, and each has foibles that would annoy anyone.As their prospects both turn terminal, Edward comes across Carter's ""bucket list"".  Meant to be a whimsical exercise from Carter's philosophy professor, it gets them thinking about using their precious last moments to do what they haven't done before.  Edward has the money but Carter has the wisdom, so sorting out their priorities turns from a final blessing to a final battle.  Carter, who always wanted to be a history professor, decides to take up Edward's offer to take a whirlwind tour of the world and discover the joys of skydiving and race car driving to name just two.  (""You gonna drive it or give it a dress?"" asks an impatient Edward to Carter the mechanic who would truly appreciate the opportunity.)This is all to the chagrin of Virginia, (also Ginny)[Beverly Todd], Carter's devoted nurse wife.  (""You're a fool who's figured out a way not have cancer,"" she chides her husband.  And to Edward:  ""My husband is not for sale."")  Carter rekindles Edward's ability to think deeply.  He offers Edward the challenge that below the surface relationships and getting one's house in order really matter.  It's not just about the fun.Once they're on the road, they have several disagreements.  One of the best merits of the movie is how it can transition from fun and funny to philosophical.  Some may find the whole affair ponderous, but I loved the way both grapple emotionally, physically, and intellectually to the challenges that death provides.  If you liked books and movies like 'Tuesdays with Morrie,' then surely 'Bucket List' should appeal to you.We've all seen ""The Little Old Lady from Pasadena"" routine so often:  Gramps or granny is in a hot rod, saying displaced things like ""cool"" and ""far out.""  It usually is funny and offensive at the same time.  This factor couldn't be more remote from the film.  There's never a bitter aftertaste when watching the elderly men doing young things.  It's all done thoughtfully and tastefully.  The dialogue is excellent.  The jokes are funny; the questions posed are interesting, but without the dead ends, for they provide some thoughtful answers as well.Watching this film reminds me that watching a three-and-a-half-star film can sometimes be more rewarding than watching a full five-star film.  In the end, 'The Bucket List' is a feel good movie with some substance that should be put on your movie ""list"".(*Sean Hayes whom I recognized, but didn't figure out 'til late to be the 'Will and Grace' star in a far different role.)",4,Worthy 'List',1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,3929,"['3.5', '*', 's', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'previews', 'so', 'much', 'elaboration', ""n't"", 'needed', 'Bucket', 'List', 'still', 'worthy', 'journey', 'even', 'plot', 'laid', 'out', 'already', 'Sweet', 'sage', 'funny', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'heartwarming', 'gem', 'rejuvenating', 'watch.They', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'opposite', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'wealthy', 'owner', 'hospitals', 'where', 'frills', 'are', 'fleeting', 'best', 'run', 'hospitals', 'not', 'health', 'spas', 'Edward', 'brashly', 'potential', 'clients', 'Two', 'guests', 'room', 'exceptions', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'mild', 'wise', 'mechanic', 'garage', 'supporting', 'family', 'academic', 'heart', 'trivia', 'expert', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'Cliff', 'Claven', 'blush', 'fellow', 'colleague', 'always', 'trying', 'stump', 'questions', 'trivia', 'book', 'Carter', 'favorite', 'past', 'time', 'blurt', 'out', 'answers', 'questions', 'really', 'watching', ""'Jeopardy'.You"", 'guessed', 'have', 'cancer', 'have', 'share', 'room', 'one', 'hospitals', 'Thomas*', 'real', 'name', 'Matthew', 'too', 'hard', 'Edward', 'keep', 'track', 'assistant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'room', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'PR', 'not', 'follow', 'own', 'rules', 'Edward', 'get', 'top', 'service', 'doctor', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'who', 'far', 'different', 'MD', 'did', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'odd', 'couple', 'take', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'other', 'absorbed', 'own', 'interests', 'foibles', 'would', 'annoy', 'anyone.As', 'prospects', 'turn', 'terminal', 'Edward', 'Carter', 'bucket', 'list', 'Meant', 'be', 'whimsical', 'exercise', 'Carter', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'thinking', 'using', 'precious', 'last', 'moments', 'do', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'before', 'Edward', 'money', 'Carter', 'wisdom', 'so', 'sorting', 'out', 'priorities', 'final', 'blessing', 'final', 'battle', 'Carter', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'history', 'professor', 'take', 'up', 'Edward', 'offer', 'take', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'world', 'discover', 'joys', 'skydiving', 'race', 'car', 'driving', 'name', 'just', 'two', 'gon', 'drive', 'give', 'dress', 'impatient', 'Edward', 'Carter', 'mechanic', 'who', 'would', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'opportunity', 'chagrin', 'Virginia', 'also', 'Ginny', '[', 'Beverly', 'Todd', ']', 'Carter', 'devoted', 'nurse', 'wife', ""'re"", 'fool', 'who', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'not', 'have', 'cancer', 'husband', 'Edward', 'husband', 'not', 'sale', 'Carter', 'Edward', 'ability', 'think', 'deeply', 'Edward', 'challenge', 'surface', 'relationships', 'getting', 'one', 'house', 'order', 'really', 'matter', 'not', 'just', 'fun.Once', ""'re"", 'road', 'have', 'several', 'disagreements', 'One', 'best', 'merits', 'movie', 'how', 'can', 'transition', 'fun', 'funny', 'philosophical', 'may', 'find', 'whole', 'affair', 'ponderous', 'loved', 'way', 'grapple', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'intellectually', 'challenges', 'death', 'liked', 'books', 'movies', ""'Tuesdays"", 'Morrie', 'then', 'surely', ""'Bucket"", 'List', 'should', 'appeal', 'you.We', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Little', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Pasadena', 'routine', 'so', 'often', 'Gramps', 'granny', 'hot', 'rod', 'saying', 'displaced', 'things', 'cool', 'far', 'out', 'usually', 'funny', 'offensive', 'same', 'time', 'factor', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'remote', 'film', 'never', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'when', 'watching', 'elderly', 'men', 'doing', 'young', 'things', 'done', 'thoughtfully', 'tastefully', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'questions', 'posed', 'are', 'interesting', 'dead', 'ends', 'provide', 'thoughtful', 'answers', 'well.Watching', 'film', 'watching', 'three-and-a-half-star', 'film', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'more', 'rewarding', 'watching', 'full', 'five-star', 'film', 'end', 'Bucket', 'List', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'substance', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'movie', 'list', '*Sean', 'Hayes', 'whom', 'recognized', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', ""'til"", 'late', 'be', ""'Will"", 'Grace', 'star', 'far', 'different', 'role']",The Bucket List

The first, Edward Cole- Jack Nicholson- is the CEO that runs the hospital and is a ruthless persona and the second is a mechanic, Carter- Morgan Freeman-, who wanted in his youth to be a history teacher but life circumstances did not allow him to do so. They share the common adversities of the infirmity and they, ant the same time, share a long trip that will tie the relationship even further.One day, Carter starts to write a ""Bucket List"" containing all the things that he would like to do before he dies and Cole finds it out. Afterward, they decide to write the ""Bucket List"" together and start going on marvelous trips around the world and sharing precious moments and becoming the best of friends.  Two utterly different persons become the closest friends ever in the last months of their lives.What really stroke me about this DVD was that it not only applies to two terminal cancer patients: What stroke me the most is its universality. If we think a little deeper, it could apply to two or more persons sharing similar adversities- or joyfulness for that matter- and relying on each other for comfort, understanding, and the sharing of knowledge and experiences.The performances of the two principal actors are outstanding and make you laugh and cry at different times during the performance.Highly recommended!!!",4,A Universal DVD,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1551,"['Bucket', 'ListA', 'Universal', 'DVDThis', 'story', 'close', 'relationship', 'two', 'utterly', 'different', 'men', 'must', 'share', 'same', 'hospital', 'room', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'advanced', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'first', 'Edward', 'Cole-', 'Jack', 'Nicholson-', 'CEO', 'hospital', 'ruthless', 'persona', 'second', 'mechanic', 'Carter-', 'Morgan', 'Freeman-', 'who', 'wanted', 'youth', 'be', 'history', 'teacher', 'life', 'circumstances', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'do', 'so', 'share', 'common', 'adversities', 'infirmity', 'ant', 'same', 'time', 'share', 'long', 'trip', 'will', 'tie', 'relationship', 'even', 'further.One', 'day', 'Carter', 'write', 'Bucket', 'List', 'containing', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'Cole', 'out', 'Afterward', 'decide', 'write', 'Bucket', 'List', 'together', 'start', 'going', 'marvelous', 'trips', 'world', 'sharing', 'precious', 'moments', 'becoming', 'best', 'friends', 'Two', 'utterly', 'different', 'persons', 'become', 'closest', 'friends', 'ever', 'last', 'months', 'really', 'stroke', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'patients', 'What', 'stroke', 'most', 'universality', 'think', 'little', 'deeper', 'could', 'apply', 'two', 'more', 'persons', 'sharing', 'similar', 'adversities-', 'joyfulness', 'matter-', 'relying', 'other', 'comfort', 'understanding', 'sharing', 'knowledge', 'experiences.The', 'performances', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'different', 'times', 'performance.Highly', 'recommended']",The Bucket List

Lees,"[1, 3]","This is a generic buddy movie but unlike Curtis and Poitier in The Defiant Ones, Nicholson and Freeman are chained together metaphorically: both have only a short time to live and both are seeking some kind of meaning before their hearts cease beating.  The conceit is simple, the script is undemanding and the plot line unfolds pretty much exactly as you'd expect, with chippy dialog and set-piece dramatic moments, not to mention the inevitable ""meaning of life"" schticks that recur with monotonous regularity.What makes it worth watching (aside from the gorgeous travelog visuals) is that Nicholson truly acts for a moment, near the very end, during the funeral oration.  He's a star who has spent so much of his career mugging to camera that it's a real joy to see him doing more, and actually doing it successfully.Furthermore there's a scene that is unintentionally comic: about one-third into the movie when the two protagonists are in their shared hospital room deep in a discussion about life, the continuity goes to hell as Freeman's spectacles alternately appear and disappear from his face as shot follows shot.  Clearly the director hoped no one would notice and forewent the expense of re-shooting the scene.  This unintended comic effect has the additional virtue of distracting from the leaden dialog, so it's wholly a plus point.All in all, this is just another Hollywood mechanically-cranked-out product but it's pleasantly distracting and essentially harmless and (mirabilis dictu) there isn't a firearm in sight.",3,Lightweight but with a few worthwhile moments,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,1532,"['generic', 'buddy', 'movie', 'Curtis', 'Poitier', 'Defiant', 'Ones', 'Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'are', 'chained', 'together', 'metaphorically', 'have', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'are', 'seeking', 'kind', 'meaning', 'hearts', 'cease', 'beating', 'conceit', 'simple', 'script', 'undemanding', 'plot', 'line', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', ""'d"", 'expect', 'chippy', 'dialog', 'set-piece', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'not', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'meaning', 'life', 'schticks', 'recur', 'monotonous', 'worth', 'watching', 'aside', 'gorgeous', 'travelog', 'visuals', 'Nicholson', 'truly', 'moment', 'very', 'end', 'funeral', 'oration', 'star', 'who', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'career', 'mugging', 'camera', 'real', 'joy', 'see', 'doing', 'more', 'actually', 'doing', 'successfully.Furthermore', 'scene', 'unintentionally', 'comic', 'one-third', 'movie', 'when', 'two', 'protagonists', 'are', 'shared', 'hospital', 'room', 'deep', 'discussion', 'life', 'continuity', 'hell', 'Freeman', 'spectacles', 'alternately', 'appear', 'disappear', 'face', 'shot', 'shot', 'Clearly', 'director', 'hoped', 'one', 'would', 'notice', 'forewent', 'expense', 're-shooting', 'scene', 'unintended', 'comic', 'effect', 'additional', 'virtue', 'distracting', 'leaden', 'dialog', 'wholly', 'plus', 'point.All', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'mechanically-cranked-out', 'product', 'pleasantly', 'distracting', 'essentially', 'harmless', 'mirabilis', 'dictu', ""n't"", 'firearm', 'sight']",The Bucket List

Shame because those seeking a funny, light-hearted movie were vastly disappointed. This is, by all accounts, a rather serious film with a few funny moments intertwined. Jack Nicholson is very good at playing the self-absorbed millionaire who finally gets a heart and Morgan Freeman does a great job of finding meaning in life wherever and whenever he can. Many have complained about the film's lack of real adventure--especially when it comes to the scenes from far away lands--but I have to admit that I am glad that wasn't the main focus; otherwise, it would have become a rather shallow film. Instead, this is a deep philosophical film, in the lightest manner possible, about the lives we live. When we come to the end of our journey, it's not the riches we obtain or the material wealth we've acquired that will matter, it's who we are, what we've done, and what we'll leave behind that will matter most. And that's a lesson Nicholson's character will take with him to the grave.

Very rarely do they star two juggernaut actors like Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  Very rarely are they this devoid of merit.  I'm bewildered at how poorly conceived this film was, when you consider the names involved.  I really wanted to see this.  Sure, it looked corny and unappealing on the outset, but it also stars one of the greatest actors ever (Nicholson) and one of the more understated and nuanced of his generation (Freeman), so the possibilities were endless here.  Instead of challenging these two men to provide us with something insightful and profound, we are left with a film that casts Nicholson as the loudmouthed jerk and Freeman as the quietly sincere `wise' soul.  Seriously, why are such great actors relegated to playing the same character in every film?  Why couldn't Nicholson be the quiet one for a change?  Why can't we see Morgan Freeman boss people around and show lack of personal regard for everyone around him?  I just want something to differentiate this from the last dozen movies these two have starred in.  YUCK.

It sets out on this journey about two men and effectively touches upon all those things I just mentioned, and all those emotions. Mission accomplished. What you see is pretty much what you expect having seen the trailers for the film. It doesn't exactly re-invent the wheel or offer much in the way of surprises, but it doesn't have to. It's about these two men. Their story. And when you have these two particular performers as Edward Cole and Carter Chambers, they raise the film to even greater heights, and make it that much more special and meaningful. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman team up for the first time and, thankfully, the movie is a lot more than just dream casting. They are a brilliant pair, and one wishes they had teamed up a lot sooner than this. As two terminally ill patients, Edward Cole(Nicholson), and Carter Chambers(Freeman), bond while sharing a hospital room. They gradually get better and leave the hospital, but they leave to really experience life and to do things they've always wanted to do before they, you know, kick the bucket. The road trips and adventures the two go on are priceless, but it's the deep characters and nuanced performances here that are front and center. Nicholson is Nicholson, and he proves once again why he is a living legend. You find yourself losing ""Jack"", and seeing ""Edward"". He is amazing. Freeman has always been one of the industry's finest and strongest performers, and here he is his usual wonderful, supportive, and brilliant self. It really is magic seeing the two together. It's never slow or repetitive. The two shine together and make everything better. The only other real co-star here is Will And Grace's Sean Hayes, who is just fine in his role, and offers some laughs of his own. ""The Bucket List"" may be a film where you can tell where it's headed and what will happen, but it doesn't matter at all. It's about the journey getting there, and the journey these two men go on in the last few months they are here on this earth. The commaraderie between them is sparkling, and the dialogue fun and meaningful. It may seem dire, but there is a light that shines thru it all. It definitley doesn't hurt that two of our greatest living actors are leading you thru that light. In the end, the movie may not seem fancy or stick out of the pack, but it's an accomplished film with great perfomers brigning life to great characters.

We put off that vacation to save money; plan things we'll do with our kids but the kids grow up and this is a great reminder of taking one day at a time.  This isn't a movie that I expected to enjoy, however I really did like it.  The movie is interesting - enjoyed all the triva that Morgan Freeman knew in his role.  It showed that you should never judge a book by it's cover.

This film is truly a reflection of real life, the young unconcerned with the inevitable and the questions it posits, the aging begrudgingly accepting and learning to deal with the allotment of time remaining.Yes this is a film designed to draw a specific audience and stars two of Hollywood's most respected senior actors to attract that target group.

Edward as a captain of industry, and Carter as a father and trivia buff. When they both find themselves next to each other in the hospital with cancer and a few months to live, both their lives change. The greatest change is for Edward. The movie is not to preachy but it shows us some of realism of being terminally ill with cancer. We see the impact it has on each man in his own way.For the fun of it Carter had started to create a ""Bucket List"" based on a class he had taken discussing what they wanted to do before they die. Carter throws it away when he learns of his final fast approaching fate. Edward finds it and decides it's the best course of action for them to have one last fling of life before they die. The rest the movie we see them travelling around the world, racing cars, and skydiving. The conclusion of the movie we see they go their separate ways with different priorities but then meeting again in a dramatic way when one is near death.

1117961,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YAF4MA,Chris Pandolfi,"[33, 40]","Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" functions with a strong sense of What If: What if you discovered you were terminally ill? What if you finally decided to live your remaining days to the fullest? What if you discovered more in those remaining days than you ever discovered before? Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are faced with scores of What Ifs when both are diagnosed with cancer and given a finite number of days to live--with Cole's help, Chambers uses that precious time to see the world and experience things he had previously only dreamed of. This is obviously not a new idea for a story like this, and the reality is that most of the film is unrealistic and clich&eacute;. But it's also touching and meaningful, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Simply put, ""The Bucket List"" is an unabashed tearjerker, a film that's simultaneously witty and sentimental for maximum effect.The film opens with one of Freeman's voiceover narrations, and that in and of itself is a clich&eacute;: consider ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Feast of Love"" and ""The Hunting of the President"" and ... I think you get the idea. Anyway, his character's narration acts as a framing device, one that will be filled with the events of the main story. The first character to be established is Chambers, who has worked as a mechanic for the past forty-five years. He's knowledgeable about many things, which is why he's able to watch ""Jeopardy!"" and answer virtually every question. We first see him in his auto shop, answering trivia questions with his co-worker; at that point, he receives a devastating phone call from his wife, one that forces him to drop his cigarette and walk away in a daze. Apparently, the test results from his latest medical exam paint a grim picture for his future.Soon after, Cole is introduced. A multimillionaire, Cole is savvy and inflexible, with a dry and completely off-putting sense of humor. He also has an affinity for Kopi Luwak coffee, the world's most expensive (and most disgusting--if you really must know why, look it up on your own). He owns a hospital in Los Angeles, and he has a strict policy when it comes to patient lodging: Two beds to a room, no exceptions. Private rooms aren't allowed because, as he puts it, ""I run hospitals, not health spas."" Upon his cancer diagnosis, he's taken in for emergency surgery, after which he's wheeled into the same hospital room occupied by Chambers; at that point, Cole pleads to be given his own room, and never mind the bad PR.Before long, Cole and Chambers form a companionship of sorts. It would be too much to say that they become fast friends--Cole's personality would make that virtually impossible, especially so soon after they meet. But they definitely tolerate each other, which is probably why Cole is willing to indulge Chambers in his last days. You see, Chambers begins writing what his old history professor called a Bucket List, which is a list of things one wants to do before dying (also known as kicking the bucket); Cole gets a hold of it and convinces Chambers to not only follow the list, but also to add a few exciting things, like skydiving and racecar driving and seeing sights all over the world. Cole would tag along, but merely as a financier and a motivator, not as a confidant. Not at first, anyway.All this comes as a surprise to Chambers' wife, Virginia (Beverly Todd), who feels that Cole is stealing her husband away during his final days. Chambers would like nothing more than for his wife to understand where he's coming from: he devoted years of his life to her and their children, and now that he's dying, he feels he's earned a little time for himself. Much to Virginia's chagrin, Chambers and Cole set off on their journey, and as you've probably guessed, this journey will be profound, revealing many things about both characters. For one thing, we learn that Chambers had once hoped to be a history professor. We also learn that Cole has endured four failed marriages, one of which introduced his daughter into the world. For reasons I won't reveal, the two haven't spoken in years--this is a golden opportunity for Chambers, who tries to use his knowledge and philosophical wisdoms to urge Cole towards reconciling.If these themes of self-discovery, friendship, and family seem routine, that's because they are. ""The Bucket List"" doesn't really give us anything new, especially when it comes to the obligatory epiphanies; in stories like this, a character's impending death always makes him or her appreciate life, usually for the first time. But I have to be honest--it's still an effective movie, if not for the story, then for reaffirming our emotions. This applies to both ends of the scale: parts of the film are incredibly funny while other parts are incredibly sad. One of the funnier moments occurs when Cole and Chambers visit the Taj Mahal in India: Cole can't decide on his funeral arrangements. An ordinary burial makes him feel claustrophobic. Cremation is risky because the person may not be completely dead when it happens.The sadder moments are mostly reserved for the end, and while I won't say what happens, I think you have a pretty good idea. ""The Bucket List"" is not a perfect film, but it's still poignant and endearing, and its sense of humor is generally well placed. There's also a decent performance by Sean Hayes as Thomas, Cole's personal assistant (his real name is Matthew, but Cole found that too Biblical). I'm recommending this film mostly for its well-established but important message of living life to the fullest. Why? Let me answer that with another question: What if?",4,Live Like You Were Dying,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,5738,"['Rob', 'Reiner', 'Bucket', 'List', 'functions', 'strong', 'sense', 'What', 'What',

The Bucket List brings together two noble actors, and their opposite life experiences juxtaposed on their common destiny (a diagnosis of cancer with 6 months to live).  Ed Cole, mega-rich egotistical and lonely executive and Carter Chambers, a gifted but humble blue-collar family man with faith meet in a common hospital room and bond while recovering from surgeries and going through chemotherapy.  When they both learn of their common fate, they decide to do everything they always wanted to do before it is too late.  What starts off as a rip-roaring adventure with comic moments ends when each man ""crosses the line"" by setting up a situation that the other one is uncomfortable with.  However at the same time, both men are healed from the emotional problems that they had in their personal lives, having taught each other a lesson that there are people and relationships more important than just adventure, experiences and fun.  Finally Cole cared about someone other than himself, and Carter gets to laugh so hard until he cries.  Even though the ending is sad, because of the cancer, the story is uplifting, as both men transcend their previous existence, in the final moments of life, in having helped a perfect stranger (each other):  Carter loses his bitterness and Cole his self-centeredness.",5,A touching family movie,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,1374,"['Finally', 'warm', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'family', 'Bucket', 'List', 'together', 'two', 'noble', 'actors', 'opposite', 'life', 'experiences', 'juxtaposed', 'common', 'destiny', 'diagnosis', 'cancer', '6', 'months', 'live', 'Ed', 'Cole', 'mega-rich', 'egotistical', 'lonely', 'executive', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'gifted', 'humble', 'blue-collar', 'family', 'man', 'faith', 'meet', 'common', 'hospital', 'room', 'bond', 'recovering', 'surgeries', 'going', 'chemotherapy', 'When', 'learn', 'common', 'fate', 'decide', 'do', 'everything', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'too', 'late', 'What', 'off', 'rip-roaring', 'adventure', 'comic', 'moments', 'when', 'man', 'line', 'setting', 'up', 'situation', 'other', 'one', 'uncomfortable', 'However', 'same', 'time', 'men', 'are', 'healed', 'emotional', 'problems', 'had', 'personal', 'lives', 'having', 'taught', 'other', 'lesson', 'are', 'people', 'relationships', 'more', 'important', 'just', 'adventure', 'experiences', 'fun', 'Finally', 'Cole', 'cared', 'someone', 'other', 'Carter', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'Even', 'ending', 'sad', 'cancer', 'story', 'uplifting', 'men', 'transcend', 'previous', 'existence', 'final', 'moments', 'life', 'having', 'helped', 'perfect', 'stranger', 'other', 'Carter', 'bitterness', 'Cole', 'self-centeredness']",The Bucket List

1117984,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000YAF4MA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 6]","Rob Reiner directs ""The Bucket List,"" a little film with a big message that boasts two mega stars who only epitomize in these roles that for which they have become noted and respected in countless others.Jack Nicholson plays Edward Cole, the quintessentially cynical billionaire with the same world-weary ennui and uncertainty that he brought to the character of Warren Schmidt in the 2002 film ""About Schmidt.""  For years he wheels and deals as one of the big movers and shakers in the health care industry.  As his collapsible morality and an inflexible adherence to his people-unfriendly hospital policies transmutes handsomely into a larger bank account but yields scant personal relationships, Cole thinks himself far too savvy to believe in a higher being yet preens with self-satisfaction regarding his sophisticated tastes and appreciation of the best of the material things the world has to offer.  Vintage Nicholson.Enter the perfect foil, the wonderfully elegant Morgan Freeman.  He  imbues the character of Carter Chambers, a wisdom-seeking egghead auto mechanic who sacrificed an education and a more promising future for the sake of his growing family with his ever-present serenity in the face of any adversity and nobility that any knight of Arthur's legendary Round Table would be proud to possess.  Think the stoically patient and hopeful Red in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tempered to a rich patina where a look conveys a multitude of emotions and elicits immediate audience response.When cancer strikes both Cole and Chambers, both men's very different lifestyles hover in a holding pattern that targets death within six months.  Unlikely companions, they compose a list of ""things to do before kicking the bucket"" and embark on a journey stocked with once-in-a-lifetime experiences and friendship-forging moments where each man's perspective is explored through their lives' mistakes and triumphs.  Of course, lessons are learned and thankfully, the audience is allowed a happy, albeit tearful, ending of sorts where this meeting of two opposites produces a pleasant mellow glow that is meant to initiate reflection and illuminate one's own legacy.Bottom line?  ""The Bucket List"" may be a comedy that laughs in the face of death, but more so, it evokes a bittersweet reaction that begs the audience to look within and define the importance of life.  Some may argue that some of the film's adventure sequences seem a bit overly sentimental and overstocked with big questions that cannot be answered during a two-hour time frame. Maybe the lessons seem to be learned too fast.  In the same respect, it could be said that Nicholson and Freeman may just be portraying themselves without the need for character definition, but honestly, I don't think any of this really matters.  The film captures the essence of Reiner's purpose; the audience definitely empathizes with both of these esteemed actors.  Not for a moment was I bored by their performances.  Rather, I was amazed at how effortless both of these American institutions make their craft seem.  Happily, ""The Bucket List"" fully delivers what it intends:  a satisfying film fraught with life and death, friendship and family, laughter and tears.  Recommended with the caveat that for those who have lost someone to cancer, the hospital sequences will serve as a sad reminder of this experience.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Finding Eternity,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,3402,"['Rob', 'Reiner', 'Bucket', 'List', 'little', 'film', 'big', 'message', 'two', 'mega', 'stars', 'who', 'only', 'epitomize', 'roles', 'have', 'become', 'noted', 'respected', 'countless', 'others.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'quintessentially', 'cynical', 'billionaire', 'same', 'world-weary', 'ennui', 'uncertainty', 'brought', 'character', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', '2002', 'film', 'Schmidt', 'years', 'wheels', 'deals', 'one', 'big', 'movers', 'shakers', 'health', 'care', 'industry', 'collapsible', 'morality', 'inflexible', 'adherence', 'people-unfriendly', 'hospital', 'policies', 'handsomely', 'larger', 'bank', 'account', 'yields', 'scant', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Cole', 'far', 'too', 'savvy', 'believe', 'higher', 'being', 'yet', 'preens', 'self-satisfaction', 'regarding', 'sophisticated', 'tastes', 'appreciation', 'best', 'material', 'things', 'world', 'offer', 'Vintage', 'Nicholson.Enter', 'perfect', 'foil', 'wonderfully', 'elegant', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'wisdom-seeking', 'egghead', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'education', 'more', 'promising', 'future', 'sake', 'growing', 'family', 'ever-present', 'serenity', 'face', 'adversity', 'nobility', 'knight', 'Arthur', 'legendary', 'Round', 'Table', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'possess', 'Think', 'stoically', 'patient', 'hopeful', 'Red', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'tempered', 'rich', 'patina', 'where', 'look', 'multitude', 'emotions', 'elicits', 'immediate', 'audience', 'response.When', 'cancer', 'Cole', 'Chambers', 'men', 'very', 'different', 'lifestyles', 'hover', 'holding', 'pattern', 'death', 'six', 'months', 'Unlikely', 'companions', 'compose', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'kicking', 'bucket', 'embark', 'journey', 'stocked', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'experiences', 'friendship-forging', 'moments', 'where', 'man', 'perspective', 'explored', 'lives', 'mistakes', 'triumphs', 'course', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'thankfully', 'audience', 'allowed', 'happy', 'albeit', 'tearful', 'ending', 'sorts', 'where', 'meeting', 'two', 'opposites', 'pleasant', 'mellow', 'glow', 'meant', 'initiate', 'reflection', 'illuminate', 'one', 'own', 'legacy.Bottom', 'line', 'Bucket', 'List', 'may', 'be', 'comedy', 'face', 'death', 'more', 'so', 'bittersweet', 'reaction', 'audience', 'look', 'define', 'importance', 'life', 'may', 'argue', 'film', 'adventure', 'seem', 'bit', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'overstocked', 'big', 'questions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'two-hour', 'time', 'frame', 'Maybe', 'lessons', 'seem', 'be', 'learned', 'too', 'fast', 'same', 'respect', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'portraying', 'need', 'character', 'definition', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'matters', 'film', 'essence', 'Reiner', 'purpose', 'audience', 'definitely', 'esteemed', 'actors', 'Not', 'moment', 'was', 'bored', 'performances', 'Rather', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'effortless', 'American', 'institutions', 'make', 'craft', 'seem', 'Happily', 'Bucket', 'List', 'fully', 'what', 'satisfying', 'film', 'fraught', 'life', 'death', 'friendship', 'family', 'laughter', 'tears', 'Recommended', 'caveat', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'someone', 'cancer', 'hospital', 'sequences', 'will', 'serve', 'sad', 'reminder', 'experience.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",The Bucket List

I saw the trailers--two old coots kicking up their heels before cashing in their chips--and thought the film looked too contrived and superficial.  Well, I caught the ending of the movie on cable recently, then couldn't wait to view it again, which I did (several times).  This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and I've seen some intense movers and shakers.It's a given when a film features talent like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you are going to get excellent performances.  And both actors deliver:  Freeman as a lifelong mechanic whose true ambitions were thwarted by circumstances; the irascible Nicholson as a curmudgeonly tycoon.  Both characters are suddenly thrown together by terminal illnesses, yet through all the turmoil and heartache a fast friendship develops.  The friction between them as they first meet, the adventures they share as they go through their respective ""Bucket Lists"", make up the movie's most comedic scenes.  The skydiving scene, in particular, was very effective for me, as it was readily apparent both Freeman and Nicholson were actually freefalling through the air during the scene.The actors themselves could have kicked the bucket.Yet the ending was what moved me the most.  Because we as the audience have developed an attachment to the characters, it becomes very difficult to watch as they meet their respective fates.  The interaction between the two in the end--the total and complete way each man has made a change, for the better, in his friend's life--makes for one incredibly poignant climax.  THE BUCKET LIST covers the full range of emotions; easily one of the best bittersweet movies in many years.  Highly recommended.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning",5,I Laughed.

I saw this movie sitting in Business Class on an Emirates flight to DUBAI. The flight was smooth, the food was fabulous, the flight stewardesses were courteous and good looking. However, the icing on the cake that made the flight perfect was this movie. It is a movie about death, for we all die once we are born. I calculated once how many minutes a person has if he or she lives for 100 years. It is not a lot if you make the calculation yourself.The story is simple. Morgan Freeman has a list of what you want to do before 'you kick the bucket', hence the title: The Bucket List. Jack Nicholson, one of my favourite actors, just like Emirates is one of may favourite airlines, is superb in his wise cracking role of a man who has just months to live. He has the money to make Morgan Freeman's hypothetical 'bucket list' a reality. He says at one point, 'Money, that's all I got'So the two buddies go and do all the things they wanted to do but never did and for them as for all of us, time really is running out.I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is hilarious and it really looks like Jack did the tandem jump, unless CGI is so good nowadays that it can fool me. The movie insurance premium on Jack must have been huge.They race fast cars like pro drivers and Jack even tries to set up Morgan with a beautiful, intelligent fille de joie, but Morgan, good guy that he is, politely declines. That shows there are those who still keep to their principles, no matter what. Something I always admire in a person.Morgan's wife is enraged that he is spending his last hours with a new found friend instead of with his family.Jack's performance is outstanding as it was to in 'Something's gotta give'. He is physically ugly but boy, he sure can act! And his charisma and screen presence c'est formidable!!!See this movie and laugh and maybe, just maybe, make your own bucket list to do.

1117990,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YAF4MA,Ed Uyeshima,"[9, 16]","Film master Akira Kurosawa made one of his most quietly powerful films in 1952'sIkiruabout a government paper-pusher who learns he has six months to live and takes stock of all the things he has not done with his life. By comparison, Rob Reiner's output as a director has been less than stellar for well over a decade (considerAlex & EmmaandRumor Has It...). This time, he appears to be going for a partial remake of ""Ikiru"" times two with this lugubrious, feel-good 2007 dramedy with components ofTerms of EndearmentandGrumpy Old Menthrown in for good measure. The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clich&eacute;s that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version ofThe Odd Coupleuntil they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his ""bucket list"" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voiceover and wizened wisdom he has been providing sinceThe Shawshank Redemption. And why cast an actor as exuberantly animated as Sean Hayes (the indefatigable Jack onWill & Gracefor eight seasons) in such an impassive role as Edward's officious factotum Thomas? He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette,  just a five-minute short, ""Writing a Bucket List"" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, ""Say"", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song.

It features both men at the top of their game. Nicholson as the millionaire hospital magnate and Freeman as the lowly mechanic strike an unlikely friendship while commiserating over their cancer. It's easy for movies about the elderly and death to take on an almost didactic air.

Two late-middle-age guys, one indecently rich, the other comfortably un-rich, end up in the same hospital room facing the same no-win battle with cancer. The rich one, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), owns the hospital, and is offended by having to share a room; he has made a virtue, however, of creating hospitals with unilateral service and few perks beyond good medical care for all - which his assistant points out - and to maintain his stand, he grumpily puts up with his roommate, Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).Over the course of time together, they of course become friends (was there any other expectation?); Carter learns to ignore Edward's surly nature, and Edward finds Carter to be that unusual person; someone he can get along with. Both of them realize time is running out, and Edward, with boundless resources, proposes to fulfill an idle dream of Carter's which he happens upon: a ""list of things to do before we kick the bucket"".With less capable personnel, this movie would have been no more than a Hallmark holiday presentation, but it barely tilts past middle-of-the-road because of the two principals of Nicholson and Freeman, neither of whom can throw a role. Morgan Freeman is famous for sage, compassionate, level-headed characters, and this is no exception. Nicholson is his typical bad-boy self, but is it ever possible to dislike either of them?Together these veterans launch a full-fledged campaign against their coming debilities by jetting around the world, visiting exotic locales, and doing things they had always wanted to do but either never got around to or, in Carter's case, never had the money for. Edward's long-suffering assistant - another well-acted role by Sean Hayes - capably arranges for all their adventures with a totally blank face, putting up with all manner of rudeness from his employer.I eagerly anticipated this movie (I'm a big Morgan Freeman fan) and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the knockout I thought it would be.

To know that these chaps will most likely die by the end makes it all the more important to see how they decide to enjoy their last months on Earth and accomplish all the things they never got around to or never had the courage to in their lives.  There is no more time to procrastinate, as it's now or never for both Carter (Freeman) and Edward (Nicholson).  The fine performances of the supporting cast, namely Sean Hayes as Edward's personal assistant and Carter's wife, make the viewer see the illness from all sides, not just from the eyes of the patient, but also from the family who wants to nurture and protect till the very end, but needs to learn to let go in these final months in order for the men to fulfil their life long dreams.  The concept of a Bucket List is easily applied to anyone, and hopefully you will not be faced with the grave diagnoses that these characters must deal with; don't put off till tomorrow what you can reach for today, and while you have the time on this Earth, grab your life and LIVE IT, don't die with regrets and unreached dreams, for this will only make for a lonely end.

1118000,AY12DBB0U420B,B000YAF4MA,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's movie was ""The Bucket List"" DVD, a simple story, well told. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were  superb in their leading roles. Hats off to the directing by Rob Reiner. Basically, Nicholson and Freeman meet in a hospital (owned by Nicholson) and both are expected to die within a year. They jointly decide to make up a list of things to do before they kick the bucket, and off they go on an around-the-world adventure supported by the immense wealth of Nicholson. The DVD cover bills it as ""Hysterically Funny"" and I got a lot of good chuckles out of it, to be sure. However, I found the film to be immensely sad, perhaps aided by the fact that I'm now approaching 77 and can faintly perceive my own bucket sitting out there on the distant horizon. Well, it's something we all face and it's a good thing to think about, no matter what your age might be. We all need a Bucket List.Some of the things on the bucket list are just standard, like traveling to distant Africa to view the wildlife, hiking in the Himalayas or driving a race car. Some are border-line crazy, like sky diving. No matter, it's a funny list and you'll be chuckling as you work your way through it. Some are simple but touching, like laughing so hard that you cry. Well, who hasn't done that? My guess would be quite a few. It's both a touching and funny movie. In their adventure and their growing friendship they also decide what to do with their remains and they both disdain conventional solutions and end up with their ashes stashed in a couple old coffee cans in a beautiful local. This is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen in months and months.

ANY movie.As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane.Yes, it's sad, but so are lots of things in life but this is a different kind of sadness. It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me.

1118007,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YAF4MA,Grady Harp,"[60, 64]","Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term.  It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love.Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly  diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy.  Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need.  Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other.Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine.  But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.

Roger Ebert, for example, delivers a heated diatribe on the liberties taken in Bucket List, particularly with respect to the realities of having cancer, a subject the esteemed critic has experienced first-hand. Ebert's anger, however, seems more connected with his own personal trauma than he acknowledges. I, for one, don't hold movies up to that kind of litmus test. It's more about how much the film gets inside you, makes you feel, engages you and keeps you watching for more as the story unfolds. Reiner's film does all those things here, at least for me. While it is admittedly formulaic to pit the wise, quiet, gentle and all-giving soul (Freeman) against the narcissistic, shallow, in-your-face, yet ultimately loveable character which Nicholson can pretty much phone in by this time, at the end of the day, IT WORKS. Good drama often involves the tempering of opposites and The Bucket List is no expection. We watch with satisfaction as these two extremely different men move toward their expected and imminent deaths, willing to break out of their lives as they've lived them so far, each allowing change to occur through the influence of the other. Much of it is just fun, Hollywoodish entertainment, but there is depth there as well. When I got up from watching this movie, I was aware of it having gotten inside me; I felt an openness and gratitude for my own life and those in it. And whereas I certainly can't credit The Bucket List for the having the ability to evoke that response in everyone who watches it, I do recommend it as entertainment, a few laughs and the occasional kleenex.

And we get to see Rob Morrow practice medicine again.The plot's wildly improbable and pretty simple:  two guys learn that they are going to die, and assemble and execute a list of things they will do before they kick the bucket.  BTW, the scene where Morgan Freeman gets his initial cancer diagnosis (on a cell phone, which is also improbable) is wonderfully performed.  There are other scenes which reminded me of my wife's career work as a family advocate;  she takes care of family members and visitors of emergency room patients.  Arguably the first part of the movie is just like a day at work for her and for millions of other doctors, nurses and caregivers.One item on the bucket list was ""to kiss the most beautiful girl in the world.""  In this movie, Jack Nicholson's character gets to do that by kissing his granddaughter, whom it looked like he'd never met before.I shared a song with the most beautiful girl in the world many years ago, called ""The Waters of March,"" written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.  The lyrics sound like nonsense;  my girl and I used to debate what they meant.But the last words of the ""doggerel"" are, ""It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart.""  While looking at the Pyramids, Morgan Freeman tells Jack that the ancient Egyptians believed that, at death, you were asked two questions to gain admittance to heaven:  did you have joy, and did you bring joy to others.Mayve Jobim and the ancient Egyptians synched up.  Death is surely the end of all strain, and what matters is the joy in your heart.Nicholson tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of erotic joy to Freeman;  Freeman's decision to decline the offer regains him his marriage.Freeman tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of family joy to Nicholson;  Nicholson's immediate reaction is rage, anguish and withdrawal, wonderfully acted (reminded me a little of Nicholson's work in ""Carnal Knowledge"").But the common thread was family.  Shelby Mustangs, Himalayas and skydiving aside, family is what brings us the greatest joy, and we can only get what we give.So, kiss the most beatiful girl in the world, and don't put it off.

If you did choose to find out, would you live out the remainder of your days in fear of that final moment, or regretting things you may or may not have had the chance to do? On the other hand, would you take whatever time you were allotted to do your best to live your life to its fullest potential? That is a question, and is essentially the basic theme, that is presented in the new comedy/drama ""The Bucket List"" starring Morgan Freeman (""The Dark Knight"") and Jack Nicholson (""The Departed"").""The Bucket List"" is the story of two complete strangers, one is a cantankerous billionaire named Edward (Jack Nicholson), and the other is a very kind and wise mechanic named Carter (Morgan Freeman), who find themselves in the same depressing situation when they discover they both have the same prognosis... cancer. Rather than letting this sort of news send them headlong into the depths of depression, these two men embark on an inspiring journey to see and experience many of the world's greatest sights and adventures; showing to everyone around them that just because your time is short, that does not mean your life is over already.Director Rob Reiner (""A Few Good Men""), along with writer Justin Zackham, have done a very good job of balancing an incredibly serious subject matter that hits close to home for many viewers, while at the same time injecting the story with a hefty dose of humor to lift the mood of the film. For some, mixing such a serious subject with comedy may seem offensive or disrespectful, but the story never becomes so humorous that the primary subject ever becomes watered down or treated lightly. I also like that along with the very well-written story, the movie poses some thought-provoking questions that will cause you to think about whether you would like to know when or how you will die, and what exactly you would do with that knowledge. It is always nice when a movie is willing to become a little more than just entertainment and good storytelling, allowing itself to create some form of discussion over its subject matter or themes.Regarding the stars of the film, it's not surprising that the two lead actors do a terrific job, after all both are veterans of the film business, and their performances have never once disappointed me in any film. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were the absolute perfect choices to play these two characters; and through their growing friendship, respect for each other, and the realistic problems and challenges they must face, along with the cleverly written dialogue, we are effectively drawn into their lives, easily relating to and becoming emotionally invested in them. Actor Sean Hayes, best known for TV's ""Will and Grace"", is the witness to the inspiring adventure these newfound friends embark upon, and his own sarcasm fits in perfectly with Edward's sardonic nature and Carter's keen intellect and quick wit. Every member of the cast did an excellent job of gracefully moving back and forth between the serious nature of the disease plaguing the two leads' lives and the humorous moments spread throughout the film, never once failing to appropriately portray either side of the situation.""The Bucket List"" is the perfect example of what has been dubbed a dramedy by many people; it's a mixture of a drama and comedy, never becoming solely one or the other. The cast is perfect, giving the characters a depth and realism that is needed for a film such as this; the script is well-written and crafted to perfectly balance the gravity of the situation with some light-hearted humor. Overall, this is just a really good movie that will undoubtedly hit closer to home for some more than others, but it still should be seen, as it is an inspiring example of not letting your life's circumstances, grave or otherwise, get the best of you.""The Bucket List"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexuality and violence.",4,Live Life to the Fullest...,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,4038,"['Let', 'ask', 'question', 'could', 'know', 'date', 'least', 'approximate', 'time', 'frame', 'when', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'would', 'want', 'did', 'choose', 'find', 'out', 'would', 'live', 'out', 'remainder', 'days', 'fear', 'final', 'moment', 'regretting', 'things', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'were', 'allotted', 'do', 'best', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'potential', 'question', 'essentially', 'basic', 'theme', 'presented', 'new', 'comedy/drama', 'Bucket', 'List', 'starring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Departed', 'Bucket', 'List', 'story', 'two', 'complete', 'strangers', 'one', 'cantankerous', 'billionaire', 'named', 'Edward', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'other', 'very', 'kind', 'wise', 'mechanic', 'named', 'Carter', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'find', 'same', 'depressing', 'situation', 'when', 'discover', 'have', 'same', 'prognosis', 'cancer', 'Rather', 'letting', 'sort', 'news', 'send', 'headlong', 'depths', 'depression', 'two', 'men', 'embark', 'inspiring', 'journey', 'see', 'experience', 'many', 'world', 'greatest', 'sights', 'adventures', 'showing', 'everyone', 'just', 'time', 'short', 'not', 'mean', 'life', 'already.Director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'writer', 'Justin', 'Zackham', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'incredibly', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'close', 'home', 'many', 'viewers', 'same', 'time', 'injecting', 'story', 'hefty', 'dose', 'humor', 'lift', 'mood', 'film', 'mixing', 'such', 'serious', 'subject', 'comedy', 'may', 'seem', 'offensive', 'disrespectful', 'story', 'never', 'so', 'humorous', 'primary', 'subject', 'ever', 'watered', 'down', 'treated', 'lightly', 'also', 'like', 'very', 'well-written', 'story', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'questions', 'will', 'cause', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'when', 'how', 'will', 'die', 'what', 'exactly', 'would', 'do', 'knowledge', 'always', 'nice', 'when', 'movie', 'willing', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'entertainment', 'good', 'storytelling', 'allowing', 'create', 'form', 'discussion', 'subject', 'matter', 'themes.Regarding', 'stars', 'film', 'not', 'surprising', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'are', 'veterans', 'film', 'business', 'performances', 'have', 'never', 'once', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'were', 'absolute', 'perfect', 'choices', 'play', 'two', 'characters', 'growing', 'friendship', 'respect', 'other', 'realistic', 'problems', 'challenges', 'must', 'face', 'cleverly', 'written', 'dialogue', 'are', 'effectively', 'drawn', 'lives', 'easily', 'relating', 'becoming', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'Actor', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'Will', 'Grace', 'witness', 'inspiring', 'adventure', 'friends', 'embark', 'own', 'sarcasm', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'Edward', 'sardonic', 'nature', 'Carter', 'keen', 'intellect', 'quick', 'wit', 'member', 'cast', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'gracefully', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'serious', 'nature', 'disease', 'plaguing', 'two', 'leads', 'lives', 'humorous', 'moments', 'spread', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'failing', 'appropriately', 'portray', 'side', 'situation', 'Bucket', 'List', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'been', 'dubbed', 'dramedy', 'many', 'people', 'mixture', 'drama', 'comedy', 'never', 'becoming', 'solely', 'one', 'other', 'cast', 'perfect', 'giving', 'characters', 'depth', 'realism', 'needed', 'film', 'such', 'script', 'well-written', 'crafted', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'gravity', 'situation', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'Overall', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'hit', 'closer', 'home', 'more', 'others', 'still', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'inspiring', 'example', 'not', 'letting', 'life', 'circumstances', 'grave', 'otherwise', 'get', 'best', 'Bucket', 'List', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'language', 'sexuality', 'violence']",The Bucket List

1118044,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000YAF4MA,Kathy W,"[1, 1]","Saw this one in the theater.  This was an excellent film with acting greats Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as 2 older gentlemen, both diagnosed with terminal cancer.  They meet when they become hospital roommates through operations and chemotherapy treatments (and heads in the toilet bowl).  They are an unlikely pair of opposites who find consolation within the tender caring sides of each other.Jack is a billionaire, previously married 4 times, currently single, and estranged from his one child, a daughter.  Morgan is a family man, married with children and grandchildren.  Jack is a little outspoken and wild.  Morgan is like a quiet southern gentleman.  They become great friends in the hospital and decide to make a ""Bucket List"" (a list of things to do before they kick the bucket).  So, with Jack's money and Jack's personal assistant to make all arrangements, and Jack's private plane, they take off to do all the things on the list.Although in content it is certainly sad, it is also uplifting that they get to live the rest of their time doing some very special things as well as bonding in a beautiful loving friendship.  There are lots of laughs, too.  This movie will have you both laughing and crying as you go through the final months of the lives of these two men.On a side note, I can understand if you are leery of seeing a movie about 2 men dying of cancer.  I was a little uneasy about the subject matter myself, since I lost my 53 year old mother, 64 year old father, and 40-year old brother to cancer.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was glad I watched it.  And, of course, the acting job was superb.  I even took my 15-year old granddaughter to see the movie.  I asked her what rating she would give it, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being outstanding.  She gave it a 9 --and I certainly agree!Note: This ""Bucket List"" thing is a great idea, not that I'm expecting to cross over anytime soon.  I kept a mental Bucket List for awhile and some things that were on it I wound up doing, so even though it might seem too expensive, or unlikely for whatever reason, it's a good idea to make the list. A couple of places that I wanted to see, but didn't think I could afford, were: San Diego, Denver, the Mayan ruins in Mexico, the Canadian Rockies, and Alaska.  Somehow, the trips manifested just by thinking about them and somehow they were affordable.  I even went to the Canadian Rockies TWICE (2004 and 2007) because the deal was so good.So, some more things on my bucket list are: Aspen/Mt. Estes/Vail, Colorado (no, I don't ski), a Barry Manilow concert in London, Machu Piccu Peru, Mt. Shasta California, Sedona Arizona, Stonehedge, Avalon, Ireland, a Panama Canal cruise, Lourdes France, Australia, and New Zealand.  I probably left something out, but there it is.  I have written it down and now it's official, so somehow these things can also begin to manifest.  I suggest you write down your Bucket List, too.",5,Making the most out of your last months-The Bucket List,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,2953,"['Saw', 'one', 'theater', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'acting', 'greats', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', '2', 'older', 'gentlemen', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'meet', 'when', 'become', 'hospital', 'roommates', 'operations', 'chemotherapy', 'treatments', 'heads', 'toilet', 'bowl', 'are', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'opposites', 'who', 'find', 'consolation', 'tender', 'caring', 'sides', 'other.Jack', 'billionaire', 'previously', 'married', '4', 'times', 'currently', 'single', 'estranged', 'one', 'child', 'daughter', 'Morgan', 'family', 'man', 'married', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'Jack', 'little', 'outspoken', 'wild', 'Morgan', 'quiet', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'become', 'great', 'friends', 'hospital', 'decide', 'make', 'Bucket', 'List', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'kick', 'bucket', 'So', 'Jack', 'money', 'Jack', 'personal', 'assistant', 'make', 'arrangements', 'Jack', 'private', 'plane', 'take', 'off', 'do', 'things', 'list.Although', 'content', 'certainly', 'sad', 'also', 'uplifting', 'get', 'live', 'rest', 'time', 'doing', 'very', 'special', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'bonding', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'friendship', 'are', 'lots', 'laughs', 'too', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'crying', 'go', 'final', 'months', 'lives', 'two', 'men.On', 'side', 'note', 'can', 'understand', 'are', 'leery', 'seeing', 'movie', '2', 'men', 'dying', 'cancer', 'was', 'little', 'uneasy', 'subject', 'matter', 'lost', '53', 'year', 'old', 'mother', '64', 'year', 'old', 'father', '40-year', 'old', 'brother', 'cancer', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'course', 'acting', 'job', 'was', 'superb', 'even', 'took', '15-year', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'see', 'movie', 'asked', 'what', 'rating', 'would', 'give', 'scale', '1', '10', '10', 'being', 'outstanding', 'gave', '9', 'certainly', 'agree', 'Note', 'Bucket', 'List', 'thing', 'great', 'idea', 'not', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'cross', 'anytime', 'soon', 'kept', 'mental', 'Bucket', 'List', 'awhile', 'things', 'were', 'wound', 'up', 'doing', 'so', 'even', 'might', 'seem', 'too', 'expensive', 'unlikely', 'reason', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'list', 'couple', 'places', 'wanted', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'afford', 'were', 'San', 'Diego', 'Denver', 'Mayan', 'ruins', 'Mexico', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'Alaska', 'Somehow', 'trips', 'manifested', 'just', 'thinking', 'somehow', 'were', 'affordable', 'even', 'went', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'TWICE', '2004', '2007', 'deal', 'was', 'so', 'good.So', 'more', 'things', 'bucket', 'list', 'are', 'Aspen/Mt', 'Estes/Vail', 'Colorado', 'do', ""n't"", 'ski', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'concert', 'London', 'Machu', 'Piccu', 'Peru', 'Mt', 'Shasta', 'California', 'Sedona', 'Arizona', 'Stonehedge', 'Avalon', 'Ireland', 'Panama', 'Canal', 'cruise', 'Lourdes', 'France', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'probably', 'left', 'something', 'out', 'have', 'written', 'down', 'now', 'official', 'so', 'somehow', 'things', 'can', 'also', 'begin', 'manifest', 'suggest', 'write', 'down', 'Bucket', 'List', 'too']",The Bucket List
1118045,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B000YAF4MA,Kelly Klepfer,"[0, 1]","I should have loved this film. I really like Nicholson and Freeman. I also enjoy a good dramedy, even those about death -- one of my all-time favorites is Better Off Dead. It must be very difficult to pull off funny when the subject is death, so to do so is impressive. The Bucket List tries, and sometimes gets very close... but I didn't love this film. It was okay. I don't regret the time invested, but, I'm not adding it to my library.Why?There was a manipulative feel to it, at times too much emotion, and others a lack that seemed extreme even when taking the grieving process into account. And I really didn't like the characters. The actors did a great job with the material. But there were moments where I ended up scratching my head and wondering where the inappropriate emotion was coming from, or how in the world that choice was made. I will admit that I just lost a near dear one to lung cancer and the hospital scenes were tough to watch. But I don't think that affected my feelings about the characters.Freeman plays a hard-working, responsible family man, Carter. He's sacrificed his whole life for his family. Nicholson plays the part of a rich playboy, Edward. Edward owns the hospital where Carter is living during cancer treatment. Edward is diagnosed with cancer and ends up as Carter's roommate because Edward is infamous for publicly stating from his soapbox that ""there are no private rooms etc.etc."" Predictably, they hate sharing and each other until treatment and struggles bring them together in a brotherhood of the suffering and dying. They begin a bucket list...""things to do before I kick the bucket."" Actually, Carter does and the items on the list are evidence of his life of responsibility and service. But then Edward and his deep pockets get involved and the adventure is on.I struggled with Carter's embracing of some of Edward's foolishness. I didn't like Carter's wife which was probably the goal otherwise Carter would have just looked selfish for taking off on the mad adventure around the world. Maybe I've been wrong about things. I always thought that I'd look back and feel that my life made a difference in others' lives because of relationship, not because of my experiences and exploits. Ultimately, that is kind of the end message.

This is no masterpiece, but not a terrible flick.  Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play characters who have little in common, save for the fact that they each have diagnoses of terminal cancer. To pack as much life as possible into their limited time, they collaborate in writing a ""Bucket List,"" a to-do list of things to do before they die:  skydiving, car-racing, world travel, etc.  In the end, the Grim Reaper wins out but not before the characters find meaning in their lives.Of course, such an endeavor is facilitated if you leave your family or have a multimillionaire buddy and a private jet to bankroll such a quest.  You must suspend your disbelief for much of this movie.  For example, Nicholson's character has his head shaved but is in the hospital long enough for his hair to grown back.  What kind of HMO is he on?  The movie's end is somewhat of a formulaic tearjerker, so have some Kleenex on hand.In the end,  we are all terminal.

The ties to family, to our work, our identity, our ideals, our religion and even to strangers. There are countless ties that bind us each and every moment of every day. How tight the tie is depends on the moment, the situation, other who are present.In this movie, the main characters loosen their ties and focus on themselves. They set out to accomplish things they wish they had done in their life....before their death.This movie also shows how reaching a dream isn't done alone.

The concept is to make a list of all the things you want to do before you die and then do them.  Seems like a good idea.This 2008 film, staring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is based on this concept.  These two men are fine actors.  They bring their years of experience, subtleties of expression and past fame to their roles of two terminally ill cancer patients who meet in the hospital and then go off to live their dreams before they die. Nicholson is the rich one who can finance all sorts of adventures for the two of them.  Freeman is the hardworking family man who has worked all his life as a mechanic and never got a chance for a formal education. Together they make a good team and their performances are excellent.The script, however, leaves much to be desired.  First of all, it is NOT a comedy although its publicity makes it seem so.  Second of all, it is just not real.  Terminally ill patients don't have the stamina to go sky diving, big game hunting in Africa, etc.  Freeman's life is all family and just too sickly sweet.  Nicholson's final reconciliation with a daughter who hates him contains no surprises.  And the film itself, instead of being uplifting, is actually sort of depressing.However, this movie has one big redeeming value.  It makes a person think about his or her own life and what is really important.  And if a film can do that, it has achieved something more than just plain entertainment.",4,Good concept and fine acting but the script leaves much to be desired,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,1494,"['phrase', 'bucket', 'list', 'become', 'part', 'culture', 'concept', 'make', 'list', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'die', 'then', 'do', 'good', 'idea.This', '2008', 'film', 'staring', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'based', 'concept', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'bring', 'years', 'experience', 'subtleties', 'expression', 'past', 'fame', 'roles', 'two', 'terminally', 'ill', 'cancer', 'patients', 'who', 'meet', 'hospital', 'then', 'go', 'off', 'live', 'dreams', 'die', 'Nicholson', 'rich', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'finance', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'two', 'Freeman', 'hardworking', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'life', 'mechanic', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'formal', 'education', 'Together', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent.The', 'script', 'however', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'First', 'all', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'publicity', 'seem', 'so', 'Second', 'just', 'not', 'real', 'Terminally', 'ill', 'patients', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stamina', 'go', 'sky', 'diving', 'big', 'game', 'hunting', 'Africa', 'etc', 'Freeman', 'life', 'family', 'just', 'too', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'Nicholson', 'final', 'reconciliation', 'daughter', 'who', 'surprises', 'film', 'instead', 'being', 'uplifting', 'actually', 'sort', 'depressing.However', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'redeeming', 'value', 'person', 'think', 'own', 'life', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'achieved', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'plain', 'entertainment']",The Bucket List

Is it mostly a check-off of things that other people agree are important or are they things that really, deeply matter to you?*Your time is limited whether you know it or not, so what's stopping you from doing what's on your list?The movie itself requires that you drift off a little: the outside shots are so artificial that you feel like you're watching a car commercial or the weather report on TV.The acting consists mostly of Nicholson and Freeman being themselves-or at least the screen versions. On two occasions, they try to expand their range and the results are disastrous. Freeman tries to express fear when he's about to jump from an airplane. Nicholson goes for deep emotion when he delivers a eulogy at Freeman's funeral.There are two cameos worth mentioning: Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife is so beautiful that you can barely notice the fine job she does.

Maybe reviewers are too young or maybe they're just so scared of death themselves that they don't know how to react without prejudice to a movie that is, at its core, about just plain dying. Maybe I liked this movie because I am 56 years old and yesterday Tim Russert, only 58, died suddenly. This movie gives people in the second half of our lives hope that we may be given a little time to do what we didn't do and smooth over the rough edges of our lives. Yes, the Nicholson character being so wealthy and the working class Freeman character just happening to luck out and meet the rich guy is contrived. But, really, what in a film is not contrived? Isn't that the core of story-telling: making up or choosing a tale to fit the desired message? All movies have a message or movie makers wouldn't make them. The message here is simple: you're born, you die and hopefully sometime in between you make yourself and others happy.

Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are top-notch in this film, as are the other actors, the directing, the cinematography, and the incredibly excellent script.The basic story: Two men meet in a hospital room as they are being treated for cancer. They both find out the same day that they only have six months to a year to live. They make a list of things they want to do before they die, and set out to do them. In the process, the true gold in this film is illuminated. It isn't in the things the two men do, but is in the developing relationship between the two men, and especially what happens with Jack Nicholson's character. There is even a touch of the mystical that sneaks up on you at the end.I won't say any more, because I don't want to spoil anything. Just see the movie. Though it isn't one you can get up and walk away from to get a snack. Everything is needed in this film to tell the story. And again, I cannot state strongly enough how incredibly excellent the script is. The dialog is wonderful without ever striking a false note. The story is completely believable, and never once do you think that something isn't plausible, or that something doesn't sit right.I was a bit worried that this movie would be maudlin and/or depressing and/or incredibly sad, but it isn't. This movie is instead an affirmation of life.There are laugh-out-loud moments (again, fabulously excellent dialog!), and there are some moments when I cried--sometimes not because something bad happened, but because something wonderful did.

I must admit I was curious to see what was on the 'bucket list' of the characters and I was prepared to find myself in for a rollicking good time. What I didn't expect was to be taken completely by surprise at the depth of emotions I felt as I watched Freeman and Nicholson portray the two main characters.By now you know that both men are faced with short life expectancies and they set out to do the things they've always wanted to do. What drew me to these two was the fact that they came from such opposite backgrounds. Sure we have the rich white guy and the average-income black guy but as the story unfolds we see who truly is the richest person. For my money, it is Freeman's character since his riches are counted in people and love rather than cold hard cash.As the two travel the world in their quest to complete their bucket list, the bond that is formed is real yet fragile. There were times when I could do nothing but cry but also times when I was reminded that sometimes in the face of desperation it is better to laugh. Nicholson is superb acting as the know-it-all millionaire who can't seem to untangle his hospital cords without help!Kudos should be given to Sean Hayes for his portrayal of the assistant to Nicholson's rich-guy character. It takes a confident actor to hold his own on screen with both Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.I highly recommend this film as one that you'll want to watch every now and then, especially with a loved one or older parent.",4,A Jewel in Disguise,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,1578,"['movie', 'was', 'list', 'must-see', 'ran', 'out', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'was', ""'bucket"", 'list', 'characters', 'was', 'prepared', 'find', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'be', 'taken', 'completely', 'surprise', 'depth', 'emotions', 'felt', 'watched', 'Freeman', 'Nicholson', 'portray', 'two', 'main', 'characters.By', 'now', 'know', 'men', 'are', 'faced', 'short', 'life', 'expectancies', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'What', 'drew', 'two', 'was', 'fact', 'came', 'such', 'opposite', 'backgrounds', 'Sure', 'have', 'rich', 'white', 'guy', 'average-income', 'black', 'guy', 'story', 'see', 'who', 'truly', 'richest', 'person', 'money', 'Freeman', 'character', 'riches', 'are', 'counted', 'people', 'love', 'rather', 'cold', 'hard', 'cash.As', 'two', 'travel', 'world', 'quest', 'complete', 'bucket', 'list', 'bond', 'formed', 'real', 'yet', 'fragile', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'could', 'do', 'nothing', 'cry', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'reminded', 'sometimes', 'face', 'desperation', 'better', 'laugh', 'Nicholson', 'superb', 'acting', 'know-it-all', 'millionaire', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'untangle', 'hospital', 'cords', 'help', 'Kudos', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'portrayal', 'assistant', 'Nicholson', 'rich-guy', 'character', 'confident', 'actor', 'hold', 'own', 'screen', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Jack', 'Nicholson.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'now', 'then', 'especially', 'loved', 'one', 'older', 'parent']",The Bucket List
1118076,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000YAF4MA,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","Car mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is at the garage tinkering with a Chevrolet Camaro - cigarette in his gob like it always has been for 45 years. He smiles as his younger co-worker quizzes him on five former American Presidents whose surnames begin with H (Carter has a thing for accumulating knowledge). He of course gets their names right. But then mid explanation on the next question (which man actually invented the radio) - his Doctor phones with test results - and the cigarette that was placed between Carter's fingers to take the call falls to the greasy floor...Meanwhile in a courtroom far away - four-times married multi-millionaire Edward Penniman Cole (Jack Nicholson) is assimilating hospital number 16 into his privatized portfolio. Sipping his Indonesian Kopi Luwak (the most expensive coffee in the world) from a Gold mobile dispenser - he asks his puppet assistant to give the panel of trustees ""the spiel..."" Their financially failing Hospital needs him and no matter what their 'moral posturing' maybe - in his moneymaking medical palaces there are two beds to every room for patients (no exceptions). But in the middle of another crass speech about how he's running a hospital and not a health spa - Edward suddenly starts to cough something into his handkerchief that isn't phlegm...Next both wildly different men find themselves lumped together in the same room of a Hospital Edward Cole owns. But because of bad PR - the grouchy Cole can't get a private room to be away from ""the living dead over there"". Gradually across chemo, operations, puking and diarrhoea - they become reluctant buddies of sorts. One day Edward finds a yellow jotter page on the floor on which Carter has written ""The Bucket List"". It's what his former college tutor told him to write as a young man - things you want to do before you 'kick the bucket'...Recovered momentarily and now with a diagnosis of 6 months and one year respectively - Edward persuades Carter not to go home to his Nurse wife Veronica and his three kids to be swallowed by pity and grief - but to take a shot at all the things he's wanted to do. After all money is not a problem. And despite his wife's misgivings - Carter knows Edward is right. It's now or never. So they skydive, get a tattoo, drive a Mustang Shelby 360, laugh until they cry, kiss the most beautiful woman in the world, witness something majestic...and so on.Part of the joy of ""The Bucket List"" is watching two acting giants given great material - let rip with it - and that's what you get here. The chemistry and obvious respect between Freeman and Nicholson leaps off every frame and Director Rob Reiner never interferes - even when the film is being silly and a little preposterous. In fact in the first 30 or 40 minutes as they navigate the physical and mental agonies of terminal illness in a Hospital - ""The Bucket List"" is truly touching movie-making - with a razor-sharp script and life observations that don't feel obvious nor too cutesy.Even in the second-half where the story demands they do their comedy party pieces - the conversations between them on Cole's private jet and in a luxurious hotel bathtub are filled with classy one-liners and power delivery (beautifully scripted by Justin Zackham). And it's funny too (most of which is provided by the incomparable Jack Nicholson). By the time it gets to The Shawshank Redemption Morgan Freeman voiceover end - when a Chock-Full-Of-Nuts tin is being carried up a mountain - you're a willing convert.This is major Hollywood movie and the picture quality on the BLU RAY is simply glorious. Defaulted to 1.85:1 Full Aspect - the frame fills the entire screen and there isn't a shot that doesn't look immaculate and impressive. Even the CGI of the chat about his daughter Emily on top of the Pyramids is convincing (title above) - as is the motorbike ride on the Great Wall of China and their walks around the Taj Mahal. Audio is Dolby Digital English, French and Spanish 5.1 for each - while the Subtitles offered are English, French and Spanish.The Extras are delightful - interviews with both leads, Director Ron Reiner, the Screenwriter, a Making of and John Mayer's gorgeous acoustic balled ""Say"".As he treks through snow keeping a promise to a man he first despised but then grew to love - Carter Chambers says of Edward Cole - ""When he died...his eyes were shut...and his heart was open...""""The Bucket List"" has been a joy to re-watch on BLU RAY.

1118081,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000YAF4MA,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[42, 45]","The Bucket List tells the sensitive and well thought-out story of two older men who are diagnosed with cancer so severe that they have six months to live--or maybe a year if they're lucky. Look for stunning performances from both Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers and Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole. Beverly Todd also acts her heart out as Beverly Chambers, Carter's wife.The action begins when Carter Chambers, a working class black man, and Edward Cole, super-wealthy self-made rich white guy who actually owns the hospital they're in become roommates in the oncology ward of the hospital. At first Carter and Edward don't exactly hit it off but it isn't long before they forge a friendship. When they each learn that by coincidence they have six months to a year to live, they embark on a trip to accomplish certain lifelong dreams and personal goals before they die. The list of things to do is called The Bucket List because it's a list of things to do before they ""kick the bucket.""Of course, because Edward Cole is wealthy many scenes in this movie become almost miraculously possible. They travel the world by private corporate jet; and they live more in just a few weeks than most people ever do in a lifetime.Of course, life has its ways of surprising just about any of us; so still the plot could go just about anywhere. How will Beverly, Carter's wife, react to all this? Will she understand and remain patient while Carter lives out a few lifelong dreams or will she want her husband home NOW? Will Carter and Edward be able to keep their cool when they are stranded in Asia during a monstrous snowstorm and they are not allowed to fly? What happens if one of them gets very sick along the way? What about Edward's refusal to make up with his daughter who disowned him long ago--will he ever decide to approach her or will he remain obstinate in his refusal to even meet with her? The results may surprise you. No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!As a cancer survivor who is finishing my own chemotherapy soon, I will add that some of the side-effects of the chemotherapy they receive are exaggerated. However, I think director Rob Reiner added these elements to the film to make it somewhat more dramatic.Overall, The Bucket List is an excellent movie; and I couldn't have enjoyed it more.

But while the beginning was slow and frighteningly morbid, the film was actually inspiring and somewhat uplifting.Can two terminally ill men who are complete strangers with different personalities and backgrounds enjoy an adventure-packed vacation during some of the last months of their lives?  The answer is yes, if you're in the movies where remission, money, and wit can come at the drop of a screenwriter's pen.Jack Nicholson's character had the money, while Morgan Freeman's character had a lifetime of knowledge; so much so that I wondered why appearing on Jeopardy didn't top the so called bucket list.  But while the extent of their vacation and list of things to do before they ""kicked the bucket"" was extreme, their growing appreciation for one another and effect on each other's lives were realistic enough to make an impact.And while this movie was not one of Nicholson's funniest, the movie was a real joy to watch.  It will make you think about the value of life, death, family loyalty, and everlasting friendship.

I thought their religious views were devoid of any value.

I thought that they missed the point of life. I was saved about 9 years ago at age 53 and my priorities are undergoing a major shift as I become more familiar with the Bible.If you have not read through the Bible, I pray that you might consider it. Before I did, I had spent at least two decades investigating eastern religion, philosophy, and psychology, only to become a fence sitter because I could not derive any meaning out of anything I had experienced. I had been a Bahai for about 5 years and studied Zen for at least that long. Although I had read parts of the Bible numerous times, I did not read through it until my 3rd marriage crashed and burned. God lifted me up out of the wreckage of that and gave me the interest to read through the Bible. I was finally able to believe in creationism.

They still do a good job but while polar opposites of each other at times, sometimes it seemed a little too contrived.  Freeman's character was a little too sage while Nicholson's was a little too out there to be believable sometimes.  Still, it was nice to see them pal around.For a plot this moved along pretty good.  It was interesting, albeit a bit unbelievable at times but since its a movie I'm allowing to suspend reality for a bit.  It was interesting to see some of the stuff on the bucket list, although it seems a lot of it would be standard for everyone (go on safari, travel the world, etc.) but some of it was unique to the characters and that was nice.  Some of the scenes were a little cheesy and you could tell they were backdrops instead of the actual place which was a surprising thing to me considering when the movie was made.  I also don't remember much of the music which means that it must have just been background filler.Not a bad movie but not the most excellent either of these two have done.  I'd probably watch it again.Review by M.

Richards,"[1, 1]","Whether you've written a list of the things you want to do with your life or just let them run through your mind, this becomes the ""bucket list""...the list of things you want to do before kicking the bucket.  The two main characters in this movie faced with the reality of death on the near horizon decide to live in the moment and find joy in the daily events of life.The movie begins with a cut throat businessman (Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole) and a true gentleman (Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers) trapped in the same hospital room.  Not immediate friends -- in fact they couldn't be more different but that allows each of them to grow and challenge each other.Their journey begins with their escape from the hospital where they begin their travels over the world...completing their list of things to do along the way.  The list itself involves both general accomplishments and gestures of kindness. Crossing off each item is a milestone full of smiles for both.While most of the movie is carried by the main characters...their interaction with others truly conveys their personalities.  Like place Edward in the boardroom ...full of power and control...stating his ""no exceptions...two to a hospital room policy"" which of course he wants the exception when he finally gets sick but is stuck sharing a room.  Then you have Carter who finds so much of his personal joy and accomplishment with his family...supporting and loving time with them. Life has tests just like in the movie...people make choices...and it isn't about pass or fail...but rather what is right for you.As a whole, I think this movie is one of genuine heart...family...the moments in life that take your breath away.  If you're looking for action...it has its funny skydiving moment among others but isn't that kind of movie.  There is humor that made me laugh so hard that I cried and yet given the subject matter...moments of loss like death are sad. It is a mixture...just like many of the metaphors used throughout.  In the end of your life...measure yourself by those that measure themselves by you...but live for the joy in the moment...as one doesn't need to get a death sentence to know that death could be sooner than we'd like to face.",5,Measure your life by joy experienced,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,2221,"['Whether', ""'ve"", 'written', 'list', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'life', 'just', 'let', 'run', 'mind', 'bucket', 'list', 'list', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'kicking', 'bucket', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'faced', 'reality', 'death', 'near', 'horizon', 'decide', 'live', 'moment', 'find', 'joy', 'daily', 'events', 'life.The', 'movie', 'cut', 'throat', 'businessman', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'true', 'gentleman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'trapped', 'same', 'hospital', 'room', 'Not', 'immediate', 'friends', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'grow', 'challenge', 'other.Their', 'journey', 'escape', 'hospital', 'where', 'begin', 'travels', 'world', 'completing', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'way', 'list', 'general', 'accomplishments', 'gestures', 'kindness', 'Crossing', 'off', 'item', 'milestone', 'full', 'smiles', 'both.While', 'most', 'movie', 'carried', 'main', 'characters', 'interaction', 'others', 'truly', 'conveys', 'personalities', 'place', 'Edward', 'boardroom', 'full', 'power', 'control', 'stating', 'exceptions', 'two', 'hospital', 'room', 'policy', 'course', 'exception', 'when', 'finally', 'sick', 'stuck', 'sharing', 'room', 'Then', 'have', 'Carter', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'personal', 'joy', 'accomplishment', 'family', 'supporting', 'loving', 'time', 'Life', 'tests', 'just', 'movie', 'people', 'make', 'choices', ""n't"", 'about', 'pass', 'fail', 'rather', 'what', 'right', 'you.As', 'whole', 'think', 'movie', 'one', 'genuine', 'heart', 'family', 'moments', 'life', 'take', 'breath', 'away', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'funny', 'skydiving', 'moment', 'others', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'humor', 'made', 'so', 'hard', 'cried', 'yet', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'moments', 'loss', 'death', 'are', 'sad', 'mixture', 'just', 'many', 'metaphors', 'used', 'end', 'life', 'measure', 'measure', 'live', 'joy', 'moment', 'one', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'death', 'sentence', 'know', 'death', 'could', 'be', 'sooner', ""'d"", 'like', 'face']",The Bucket List

After some preamble to fleetingly show that they are actually not well, they create a bucket list - a list of things they want to do before kicking the bucket, and since one of them is rich, set out to work their way through the items, learning about themselves and each other as they go.It works because the leads are strong, particularly Freeman.  Nicholson overplays, but then the writing does call for it.  It does stumble however in the script department from time to time... For example, Freeman talking to Nicholson - ""You once said you're not everyone. Well, that's true-you're certainly not everyone, but everyone is everyone.""  It's not exactly Shakespeare.  The concept of terminally ill men skydiving, climbing mountains and traveling the world somewhat while barely catching their breath also stretches credibility.  Morgan Freeman does his trademark stately voice over, which only serves to remind you of The Shawshank Redemption, and the comparison is not favourable.  And while the male bonding is fun to watch and some of the one-liners funny, the warmth of affection Freeman narrates for the Nicholson character never seems quite justified by anything his character does.Those quibbles aside, it's fun, warm and fuzzy round the edges, has some decent performances, and is short enough not to outlast its welcome.

Although they didn't live up to some of their earlier great roles, neither were they disappointing.  Both did yeoman's work in their roles as aging men from very different life backgrounds, one phenomenally rich and the other a humble laborer, who found common ground in their battle with terminal cancer.  Both are forced, without regard to wealth or social status, to come to grips with both their own mortality and their past failings.The first half hour or so of the movie was less than gripping, and at times maybe even a little tedious, but once it moves into the meat of the storyline it takes on a new life (although even at this it seems a bit too contrived and just missed a fourth star).  In their quest to live full lives in their last remaining months, and thus to try to undo a lifetime of squandered opportunities, they stumble upon something far more valuable -- true self-understanding, true friendship, and, most importantly, redemption.I hate spoilers, so I won't give any clues except to say that the end of this frequently humorous, frequently poignant tale is delightfully unexpected and equally poetic.

1118121,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B000YAF4MA,Penumbra,"[2, 2]","Based on previews and coming attractions, ""The Bucket List"" was a movie that held no interest for me.  Sure, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are good actors.  Sure, Rob Reiner has directed at least a dozen other movies that I've liked a lot.  But the premise of ""The Bucket List""  sounded weird and unappealing.  This movie is proof that an excellent cast and a skillful director can turn straw into, if not exactly gold, maybe stainless steel.  The movie certainly exceeded my expectations.Two men with nothing in common except cancer and chemotherapy meet while sharing a hospital room.  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a family man who has been married for 45 years.  He has a loving family, an insatiable intellect and the soul of a philosopher.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) has been divorced four times, is estranged from his only child, has no friends and is accompanied everywhere by a paid personal assistant.  His lifelong talent and passion has been for business and making money; he's a billionaire.As an academic exercise Carter starts a list of things he'd like to do before he dies.  Edward, picks up the discarded list and is immediately intrigued.  So, with unlimited funding from Jack, the two set off to do all the things they wanted to do... intended to do.... someday.... before 45 years blew past ""like smoke through a keyhole.""Sean Hayes is terrific as Edward's assistant, Thomas.  I always found him annoyingly over-the-top on ""Will and Grace.""  Here he proves that he can be more charming and much more funny when he dials it down a few notches.The DVD special features are limited; a brief featurette - ""Writing a Bucket List"" and a John Mayer Music Video 'Say'.  You can insert the DVD into your PC's disk drive more additional special features - something that always seems more trouble than it's worth.  There is no commentary track.""The Bucket List"" isn't a raucous comedy.  The premise sounds grim but there is humor throughout the film - low key, subtle and thoughtful.  I give it 3 1/2 stars for being better than it had any right to be considering the material.",4,"There are things you always wanted to do...intended to do.

This film should have done better then it did.  It should have swept the Oscars, destroyed all box office records, and be declared among the greatest films of all time!  But, even if it was denied these accolades, it is still a fine film.  Our leads play a pair of men, previously unknown to one another, who become hospital roommates as they both learn that they have terminal cancer.  Deciding to make their remaining time count, they set out on an around-the-world trip, one of them being rich enough to easily finance the venture for the pair and his assistant/butler/verbal punching bag ""Thomas"", played by Sean Hayes...I actually found the explanation of this character's name to be among the funniest parts of the movie.  This film worked because of the chemistry that Freeman and Nicholson built up throughout their time together...you could see their friendship rise and fall with each passing event.  I don't know much, if anything, about Beverly Todd, but I felt she was just there so Morgan Freeman could have a wife.  I just don't like it when there's a couple on the screen and we only get to know one person and the other one's just...there.

The bucket list ended up being a life affirming film from start to finish. It's not about death, it's really about life. Living life to the fullest and setting things right. It's a film about two men standing at the door to death and deciding it's time to really live life for the first time before they die. The characters Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play are such complete opposites, yet they had something in common that they understood. Working together they find the courage and meaning to live out their last days doing the things they never did in all their years on earth, and in only 3 months they ended up doing more than most people do in a lifetime. And along the way they came to understand what true frienhship, love, and forgivness are really all about. I am so greatful to Rob Reiner for making this film because exploring the subject of death and telling a story of hope at the same time is a tough nut to crack. But this film succeeds in telling a story that needed to be told and doing so in such a wonderful way. In the end the message was loud and clear for me.

Nicholson as a billionaire in hospitals - a field noted for groups operating illegally. Not at all realistic, and the character is absurd - more or less acquaintance-less, perhaps to keep the cost down; and also without anything one imagines billionaires to have, from sophistication (there's a drawn-out thing with a type of coffee he would certainly know the details of) to grasp of his business and will. The other one is a sort of Nelson Mandela type, not showing the sorts of characteristics noted by US blacks. In the same way blacks are promoted as athletes - for want of anything else - this character is shown as a TV quiz type, quoting simple-minded factoids, though the script does allow a bit of play there.[2] The events are too obviously selected to be tear-jerking, like some guilty person making up a story about a dying relative as an excuse. This is of course is a standard technique; it doesn't really work here, because of the extreme contrasts of the operations, shaved heads, near-death, and stumbling around in hospital clothing stuff, with the going round the world material. As is a Hollywood standard, the black character is morally impecable, turning down, for example, a sh*g with a woman presumably paid by Nicholson. Some of the regret material seemed better, but, well...[3] The effects didn't quite work... the scenes trying to race cars showed the characters talking to each other through open windows; and with obviously implausible stunt scenes.

He was wealthy, powerful, and he ran hospitals.""We run hospitals--not resorts!"" E. Cole (Nicholson)If Cole hadn't been so mercenary, he'd never have been stuck with another patient in his hospital room.  At first, the very wealthy Cole doesn't care for the soft-spoken auto mechanic, but as time goes on the two develop a friendship--and Cole begins to both share food and care for Carter.When Edward sees Carter's 'Bucket List,'(a list of items he wants to accomplish before he kicks the bucket) he realizes it's something the two of them can do--and says they should.  That's when the two cancer patients break out of the hospital and go on a world tour. Together, they write out a new bucket list and work to make each other's dreams come true.""Bucket List"" is sentimental, predictable, and yet more than my words can encompass.  The film's not just about dying, but friendship, and finding joy to spread to others--even at the worst times in a person's life.In my opinion, the three best aspects of this film were Morgan Freeman's outstanding narration and Sean Hayes' well-done portrayal of Cole's ever-present assistant (Thomas). Another nod goes to actress Beverly Todd, who played Virginia Chambers.

He sacrificed and worked and toiled for a lifetime, always putting his family's needs ahead of his own long-cherished dream to get a college degree and become a history professor. And his lifetime of self-sacrifice bore much fruit: His three children went to college and became successful professionals.Nicholson and Freeman forged a bond, and became friends despite the fact that the two men were complete opposites and would never have crossed paths in day-to-day life, were it not for their illness.Nicholson lived an life that was the diametrical opposite of Freeman's character; a life which was characterized by debauchery, lasciviousness and general over-indulgence, always keeping a keen eye open, looking out for Number One. His legacy is a business, which has made him a multi-millionaire.In the few weeks the men have left, Freeman gives Nicholoson a few life lessons about real success and love and the joy that can be found in self-sacrifice and Freeman shows Nicholson that the love we leave behind and the life example we leave behind can be our most enduring and important life legacy.And Nicholson gives Freeman an extraordinary gift. Nicholson shows Freeman the world that he's spent decades reading about in books.My favorite line in the movie: According to Egyptian lore, you're asked two questions at the gates of heaven: First, Did you experience joy in your lifetime?

Nicholson plays Edward Cole, and is rich; Freeman (Carter Chambers) isn't (he's a mechanic).  Chambers is married; Cole is married to his work.  Both are seriously ill, and given months to live.  Chambers starts jotting on a pad, curious about the note, Cole picks it up.  Chambers is not happy, but allows that it is a 'bucket list', i.e. a list of things to do before one dies.Cole decides to make both of their lists a reality.  First on the list, skydiving.  Then, racing a Mustang 350 race car, Mount Everest and other things.When the movie came out, the reviews were mixed, and I wasn't that motivated to see it.

Personally, I like this movie, a lot.  Aside from some typical over the top acting from our boy Jack and Morgan Freeman's typical wise old guy persona, the movie works for me, and as others have stated, delivered a new phrase in our lexicon.However, if you are expecting a greatly increased quality from the blu ray version...don't.  The audio is strictly a 5.1 lossy offering and not DTSHD.  For a dialogue driven film like this, it really doesn't make much of a difference.  There is very little use of the surrounds for your home theater system to make use of.  The video quality is good, nothing outstanding but good.There are a number of extras but no deleted scenes or alternates.  The interview between Rob Reiner, the director and Morgan Freeman was done over a television hookup so that when the camera focuses on Morgan, the interlacing is very, very apparent and I found it distracting.  The whole interview, while some interesting things were mentioned seemed as if the two of them were doing nothing but saying how wonderful they both were.  It got boring.For me, the movie is a 5 star treat, nothing heavy but the end does make me well up.  I do wish the audio were mixed better which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Bucket List on Blu Ray,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1753,"['Well', 'easy', 'see', 'love', 'film', 'others', 'dismiss', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'mishmash', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'go', 'story', 'lines', 'plot', 'development', 'Personally', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'Aside', 'typical', 'top', 'acting', 'boy', 'Jack', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'typical', 'wise', 'old', 'guy', 'persona', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'delivered', 'new', 'phrase', 'lexicon.However', 'are', 'expecting', 'greatly', 'increased', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'audio', 'strictly', '5.1', 'lossy', 'offering', 'not', 'DTSHD', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'very', 'little', 'use', 'surrounds', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'make', 'use', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'are', 'number', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternates', 'interview', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'director', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'done', 'television', 'hookup', 'when', 'camera', 'Morgan', 'interlacing', 'very', 'very', 'apparent', 'found', 'distracting', 'whole', 'interview', 'interesting', 'things', 'were', 'mentioned', 'seemed', 'two', 'were', 'doing', 'nothing', 'saying', 'how', 'wonderful', 'were', 'got', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'treat', 'nothing', 'heavy', 'end', 'make', 'well', 'up', 'do', 'wish', 'audio', 'were', 'mixed', 'better', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Bucket List

I'm not trying to be contrary, but I'll disagree a bit with that recommendation.  Not because the movie isn't worth it, but more because the Blu-ray disc version is relatively sparce on extras and also because the long-term value for this disc/package doesn't seem high enough to get over the threshold I'd would normally set for recommending purchase versus rental.The film itself is certainly worth viewing, so at least do yourself the favor of renting via Unbox or any other service you prefer.  While the subject matter is sad and somewhat depressing (two victims of cancer or other terminal diseases bond while sharing a hospital room) to begin with, the journey the two individuals make is heartwarming and somewhat uplifting.The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 97 minutes.  The first major portion of the film deals with the main characters finding out about their illnesses and living through (mostly suffering through) treatment for same.  That segment is fairly depressing and not necessarily easy to get through.  It is worth watching just to educate yourself on what life with cancer or a tumor is like, and especially what life while being treated for such things would be like.Once past that part of the film, the story that was promised in trailers and advertisements for the movie comes through, that of a pair of friends that go off to do the things on their 'bucket list' -- a list of things to be done before kicking the bucket.Seeing these two great actors playing these roles and doing a great job in portraying their characters is well worth the price of admission here.  They both are living legends, and both do a great job of playing believable characters.  Additionally, the director for the film is none other than Rob Reiner, himself a legandary director.  A genuine A team of talent.See this movie.  It is most definitely recommended viewing.  Purchase decision really comes down to what you want from a Blu-ray disc or DVD package.  Basic movie?

Whether the list include tangible sort of goals like run a marathon or climb a mountain or somewhat more intangible things like being a better person or contributing to society, the reason as to why we might choose to list such items is to sort of set some goals in the life that passes us by so quickly.Often times we might not take seriously the list of things to achieve until it is too late. We might be caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life that removes our focus from what might be a priority and what might not be. There are times when we might fail to start addressing the things that might be classified as goals until ""everything else"" is done.Directed by Rob Reiner, The Bucket List is a humorous yet somewhat philosophical film that maybe even for just a few seconds reminds us that maybe there is more to life than just the rigmarole of our professional lives. In a society that is driven by numbers, results and expectations, a failure to step back every now and again could indeed push each of us to our passing in a more expeditious manner.The Bucket List gets its name because it is one man's listing of things that he hopes to accomplish before he kicks the bucket.Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a mechanic by trade but perhaps a professor by knowledge and action. Carter seems to know just about every fact there is to know about just about everything. A Jeopardy wizard, Carter is satisfied with his life as a mechanic but cannot help but wonder if decisions that he made perhaps could have forever changed the life that he lives.One day while working in his shop, Carter comes out to find that he has terminal cancer and likely does not have much time left to live. Though he has sort of found his peace with the diagnosis, Carter does try some experimental cancer treatment in an attempt to give not just himself but his family some more time.By matter of circumstance, Carter ends up becoming hospital roommate with Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) who is, interestingly enough, the owner of the hospital where the two are staying. Edward has made his fortune in the health care industry owning and operating hospitals. His business approach to health care has always been more about the dollars and cents more than it has been about providing quality health care.But when Edward comes to find out that he too is on a quick path to death due to a cancer diagnosis, as well, Edward finds a new perspective on life. His friendship with Carter is a unique and interesting one that at times is about nothing more than playing gin while at other times it is all about personal and emotional issues the two might be sharing.Sean Hayes plays the role of Thomas, who is Edward's right hand man and does it remarkably well. There is the right level of cynicism directed back at the boss that truly makes the dynamic between the two shine.Needless to say, the two friends each start to look at the things that are on their joint bucket list and wonder whether or not they will be able to accomplish many of them before they pass. As the absurdity of some of the tasks grows so does their friendship that really was like a phoenix that rose from the ashes of being nothing more than hospital roommates.What makes The Bucket List such an enjoyable film is really the message that it gets across. Though certainly it is meant to be watched partially as a comedy, there is also the right amount of a sort of deeper meaning to the film that makes it a complete film. Freeman and Nicholson are the ideal actors for the parts that they were cast for and it is clear to see why they were chosen.The Bucket List is an amazingly well done film that is certainly worth while to add to your own bucket list of movies to watch. After all, it could help to shed some perspective as to your own daily living.",5,Don't Kick It Before Watching It,1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,3953,"['probably', 'theoretically', 'have', 'list', 'things', 'hope', 'accomplish', 'meet', 'fateful', 'end', 'here', 'Earth', 'list', 'include', 'tangible', 'sort', 'goals', 'run', 'marathon', 'climb', 'mountain', 'somewhat', 'more', 'intangible', 'things', 'being', 'better', 'person', 'contributing', 'society', 'reason', 'why', 'might', 'choose', 'list', 'such', 'items', 'sort', 'set', 'goals', 'life', 'so', 'quickly.Often', 'times', 'might', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'list', 'things', 'achieve', 'too', 'late', 'might', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'everyday', 'life', 'focus', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'priority', 'what', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'might', 'fail', 'start', 'addressing', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'classified', 'goals', 'everything', 'else', 'done.Directed', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Bucket', 'List', 'humorous', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'philosophical', 'film', 'maybe', 'even', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'maybe', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'rigmarole', 'professional', 'lives', 'society', 'driven', 'numbers', 'results', 'expectations', 'failure', 'step', 'back', 'now', 'again', 'could', 'indeed', 'push', 'passing', 'more', 'expeditious', 'manner.The', 'Bucket', 'List', 'name', 'one', 'man', 'listing', 'things', 'accomplish', 'bucket.Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'mechanic', 'trade', 'perhaps', 'professor', 'knowledge', 'action', 'Carter', 'know', 'just', 'fact', 'know', 'about', 'just', 'everything', 'Jeopardy', 'wizard', 'Carter', 'satisfied', 'life', 'mechanic', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'decisions', 'made', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'forever', 'changed', 'life', 'lives.One', 'day', 'working', 'shop', 'Carter', 'out', 'find', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'likely', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'live', 'sort', 'found', 'peace', 'diagnosis', 'Carter', 'try', 'experimental', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'attempt', 'give', 'not', 'just', 'family', 'more', 'time.By', 'matter', 'circumstance', 'Carter', 'up', 'becoming', 'hospital', 'roommate', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'owner', 'hospital', 'where', 'two', 'are', 'staying', 'Edward', 'made', 'fortune', 'health', 'care', 'industry', 'owning', 'operating', 'hospitals', 'business', 'approach', 'health', 'care', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'dollars', 'cents', 'more', 'been', 'providing', 'quality', 'health', 'care.But', 'when', 'Edward', 'find', 'out', 'too', 'quick', 'path', 'death', 'due', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'as', 'well', 'Edward', 'new', 'perspective', 'life', 'friendship', 'Carter', 'unique', 'interesting', 'one', 'times', 'nothing', 'more', 'playing', 'gin', 'other', 'times', 'personal', 'emotional', 'issues', 'two', 'might', 'be', 'sharing.Sean', 'Hayes', 'role', 'Thomas', 'who', 'Edward', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'remarkably', 'well', 'right', 'level', 'cynicism', 'directed', 'back', 'boss', 'truly', 'dynamic', 'two', 'shine.Needless', 'say', 'two', 'friends', 'start', 'look', 'things', 'are', 'joint', 'bucket', 'list', 'wonder', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'accomplish', 'many', 'pass', 'absurdity', 'tasks', 'grows', 'so', 'friendship', 'really', 'was', 'phoenix', 'rose', 'ashes', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'hospital', 'Bucket', 'List', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'really', 'message', 'certainly', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'partially', 'comedy', 'also', 'right', 'amount', 'sort', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'film', 'complete', 'film', 'Freeman', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'ideal', 'actors', 'parts', 'were', 'cast', 'clear', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'chosen.The', 'Bucket', 'List', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'add', 'own', 'bucket', 'list', 'movies', 'watch', 'could', 'help', 'shed', 'perspective', 'own', 'daily', 'living']",The Bucket List
1118191,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000YAF4MA,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[5, 5]","One of the most fun and uplifting films of the year, Rob Reiner's The Bucket List is also a likely contender for Academy Award nominations. Wonderfully sarcastic dialogue, poignant exchanges between excellently crafted characters, and an overall beautiful tale of mortality and morality, The Bucket List is an excellent opportunity for two of the greatest actors of our time to show off their inimitable techniques. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a chemistry that will have you laughing until you cry and crying at the sight of something truly majestic.Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is an incredibly wealthy hospital owner who firmly believes that he's running infirmaries instead of health spas, and therefore demands that each room contain two beds and two patients. When a twist of fate lands him in his own hospital, he's stuck sharing a room with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). Both men are dying of cancer, and the doctors give each of them only a few months left to live. The two slowly but surely realize how much they enjoy each other's company, so when Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"", Jack prompts him to see it through. The ""bucket list"" is a list of all the things both Edward and Carter would like to accomplish in their remaining months (before they kick the bucket) and with Cole's wealth, the two end up touring the world, skydiving and racecar driving. As their list of goals begins to come to an end, they realize how much they've truly lived just in the last few months alone, and how much their short friendship has impacted their lives.Jack Nicholson's performance is excellent as the curmudgeonly Ebenezer character that receives a change of heart and a change of view with Carter's friendship. Little character development is necessary as we have come to recognize Jack's style over the years. We're already familiar with his character and relate to him in much the same way we feel about all of his recent projects. He's attained a level of recognition that allows us to acknowledge him simply as Jack. Regardless of his role, he's still Jack, and he doesn't disappoint.The same can be said for Morgan Freeman who continues to play roles that accentuate his knack for worldly, wise and good-natured characters that can make us laugh and cry from moment to moment. Rarely do we see two actors work so well together - this odd couple appears to have been destined for these roles. The chemistry between these veterans is pleasantly refreshing, and because of it, The Bucket List is one of the most entertaining films of the year.Another aspect, which is a great credit to screenwriter Justin Zackham, is the dialogue, which is continually hilarious even while it borders on heartbreaking. Sarcasm and cynicism are proudly worn by Jack, and the conversations conducted between the two are never dull. Meaningful, affecting and downright funny, the script is amazingly well paced and flows more naturally than anything in recent memory.Nearly everything is likable about The Bucket List, except the tone of the film, which many awards voters and critics may feel is too repetitious of late. The film is uplifting and heartwarming, and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability, comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""As Good as it Gets"" are immediately brought to mind, especially because these include the same actors, although the morals of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" are clearly beneath the surface of this feel-good comedy. Despite these comparisons, The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight, especially after his unpropitious previous project, ""Rumor Has It..."".- Mike Massie",4,The Bucket List Movie Review,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,3758,"['One', 'most', 'fun', 'uplifting', 'films', 'year', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Bucket', 'List', 'also', 'likely', 'contender', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Wonderfully', 'sarcastic', 'dialogue', 'poignant', 'exchanges', 'excellently', 'crafted', 'characters', 'overall', 'beautiful', 'tale', 'mortality', 'morality', 'Bucket', 'List', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'two', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'show', 'off', 'inimitable', 'techniques', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'have', 'chemistry', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'cry', 'crying', 'sight', 'something', 'truly', 'majestic.Edward', 'Cole', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'incredibly', 'wealthy', 'hospital', 'owner', 'who', 'running', 'infirmaries', 'instead', 'health', 'spas', 'therefore', 'demands', 'room', 'contain', 'two', 'beds', 'two', 'patients', 'When', 'twist', 'fate', 'lands', 'own', 'hospital', 'stuck', 'sharing', 'room', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'men', 'are', 'dying', 'cancer', 'doctors', 'give', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'left', 'live', 'two', 'slowly', 'surely', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'so', 'when', 'Carter', 'writing', 'bucket', 'list', 'Jack', 'see', 'bucket', 'list', 'list', 'things', 'Edward', 'Carter', 'would', 'like', 'accomplish', 'remaining', 'months', 'kick', 'bucket', 'Cole', 'wealth', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'touring', 'world', 'skydiving', 'racecar', 'driving', 'list', 'goals', 'begins', 'come', 'end', 'realize', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'truly', 'lived', 'just', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'alone', 'how', 'much', 'short', 'friendship', 'impacted', 'lives.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'excellent', 'curmudgeonly', 'Ebenezer', 'character', 'change', 'heart', 'change', 'view', 'Carter', 'friendship', 'Little', 'character', 'development', 'necessary', 'have', 'come', 'recognize', 'Jack', 'style', 'years', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'character', 'relate', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'feel', 'recent', 'projects', 'attained', 'level', 'recognition', 'acknowledge', 'simply', 'Jack', 'Regardless', 'role', 'still', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'disappoint.The', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'play', 'roles', 'accentuate', 'knack', 'worldly', 'wise', 'good-natured', 'characters', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'moment', 'moment', 'Rarely', 'do', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'odd', 'couple', 'have', 'been', 'destined', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'veterans', 'pleasantly', 'refreshing', 'Bucket', 'List', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'year.Another', 'aspect', 'great', 'credit', 'screenwriter', 'Justin', 'Zackham', 'dialogue', 'continually', 'hilarious', 'even', 'heartbreaking', 'Sarcasm', 'cynicism', 'are', 'proudly', 'worn', 'Jack', 'conversations', 'conducted', 'two', 'are', 'never', 'dull', 'Meaningful', 'affecting', 'downright', 'funny', 'script', 'amazingly', 'well', 'paced', 'more', 'naturally', 'anything', 'recent', 'memory.Nearly', 'everything', 'likable', 'Bucket', 'List', 'tone', 'film', 'many', 'awards', 'voters', 'critics', 'may', 'feel', 'too', 'repetitious', 'late', 'film', 'uplifting', 'heartwarming', 'conclusion', 'unpredictability', 'comparisons', 'may', 'be', 'drawn', 'similarly', 'crafted', 'works', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'As', 'Good', 'are', 'immediately', 'brought', 'mind', 'especially', 'include', 'same', 'actors', 'morals', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'are', 'clearly', 'surface', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'comparisons', 'Bucket', 'List', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'will', 'certainly', 'bring', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'back', 'spotlight', 'especially', 'unpropitious', 'previous', 'project', 'Rumor', '.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",The Bucket List

But while Carter was trying to define his private dreams and plans, reality intruded. Marriage, children, myriad responsibilities and, ultimately, a 46-year job as an auto mechanic turned his concept of a bucket list into little more than a bittersweet memory of lost opportunities and a mental exercise he occasionally thought about to pass the time. Meanwhile, corporate billionaire Edward Cole never saw a list without a bottom line. He was always too busy making money and building an empire to think about what his deeper needs might be beyond the next big acquisition or cup of gourmet coffee. Then life delivered an urgent and unexpected wake-up call to both of them. Carter and Edward found themselves sharing a hospital room with plenty of time to think about what might happen next--and about how much of that was in their hands. For all their apparent differences, they discovered they had two very important things in common: an unrealized need to come to terms with who they were and the choices they'd made, and a pressing desire to spend the time they had left doing everything they ever wanted to do. So, against doctor's orders and all good sense, these two virtual strangers check themselves out of the hospital and hit the road together for the adventure of a lifetime--from the Taj Mahal to the Serengeti, the finest restaurants to the seediest tattoo parlors, the cockpit of vintage race cars to the open door of a prop plane--with just a sheet of paper and their passion for life to guide them. Adding and crossing items off their list while taking in the grandeur and beauty of the world, they grapple with the difficult questions and the even more difficult answers that plague all of us. And, without even realizing it, become true friends.  This movie is full of well-earned rueful humor. What a gift.

This is the core base of this film as the two main characters find themselves pushed into the other 4%.These two characters are billionaire tycoon Edward Cole (played by Jack Nicholson) and car mechanic Carter Chambers (played by Morgan Freeman) that are both terminally ill with cancer, have both been given less than a year to live, and find themselves sharing the same hospital room.

Carter is a self-taught man with a thirst for knowledge that is never quite quenched.  He has three children, a devoted wife, and is an ace mechanic.  A telephone call one morning from the hospital changes everything.  The operation he had months before was unsuccessful and has terminal cancer in the brain.  Carter finds himself in the hospital participating in a ""promising"" experimental treatment.  Carter's roommate in the hospital turns out to be none other than the CEO of the hospital, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson).  Edward has built a fortune and an empire by turning failing hospitals around into relatively profitable businesses.  However, as Edward soon learns profitable hospitals aren't necessarily customer friendly or the nicest places to stay.  Edward has a similar illness as Carter and the men from two different worlds soon develop a friendship.  One day, while waiting for his test results Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"" a list of all the things he would like to do before he ""kicks the bucket"".  When he receives news that he only has about six months to live at the most, Carter abandons the idea.  Edward, however, won't allow Carter to give up so easily and together the two men take off on a journey around the world living out their every whim, from skydiving, to eating lunch on one of the Great Pyramids, to racing expensive sports cars.  Along the way the two men learn a great deal about friendship and themselves.THE BUCKET LIST is a fairly engaging, sentimental movie.  The movie has a strong emotional appeal, especially if anyone has lost a parent or parental figure in their lives.  Freeman and Nicholson make a great team and I wish they would have done more movies together in their careers.  On the negative side, the opening and concluding segments of THE BUCKET LIST are a bit confusing.  Also, I was a bit disappointed that the film didn't have more of Carter and Edward participating in more adventures.  Despite the confusing moments and a lack of adventures, THE BUCKET LIST is still a pretty decent film with a lot of heart and an important message about living life to the fullest.",4,Carpe Diem--Even If You're Pushing 80.,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2196,"['Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'relatively', 'happy', 'man', 'Carter', 'self-taught', 'man', 'thirst', 'knowledge', 'never', 'quite', 'quenched', 'three', 'children', 'devoted', 'wife', 'ace', 'mechanic', 'telephone', 'call', 'one', 'morning', 'hospital', 'changes', 'everything', 'operation', 'had', 'months', 'was', 'unsuccessful', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'brain', 'Carter', 'hospital', 'participating', 'promising', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'Carter', 'roommate', 'hospital', 'out', 'be', 'none', 'other', 'CEO', 'hospital', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Edward', 'built', 'fortune', 'empire', 'turning', 'failing', 'hospitals', 'relatively', 'profitable', 'businesses', 'However', 'Edward', 'soon', 'profitable', 'hospitals', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'customer', 'friendly', 'nicest', 'places', 'stay', 'Edward', 'similar', 'illness', 'Carter', 'men', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'soon', 'develop', 'friendship', 'One', 'day', 'waiting', 'test', 'results', 'Carter', 'writing', 'bucket', 'list', 'list', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'bucket', 'When', 'news', 'only', 'six', 'months', 'live', 'most', 'Carter', 'idea', 'Edward', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Carter', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'easily', 'together', 'two', 'men', 'take', 'off', 'journey', 'world', 'living', 'out', 'whim', 'skydiving', 'eating', 'lunch', 'one', 'Great', 'Pyramids', 'racing', 'expensive', 'sports', 'cars', 'way', 'two', 'men', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'friendship', 'themselves.THE', 'BUCKET', 'LIST', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'movie', 'strong', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'especially', 'anyone', 'lost', 'parent', 'parental', 'figure', 'lives', 'Freeman', 'Nicholson', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'movies', 'together', 'careers', 'negative', 'side', 'opening', 'concluding', 'segments', 'THE', 'BUCKET', 'LIST', 'are', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Also', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'Carter', 'Edward', 'participating', 'more', 'adventures', 'confusing', 'moments', 'lack', 'adventures', 'THE', 'BUCKET', 'LIST', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'important', 'message', 'living', 'life', 'fullest']",The Bucket List

1118209,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B000YAF4MA,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[12, 27]","The new Jack Nicholson & Morgan Freeman buddy picture is downright depressing. Indeed, the Warner Brothers' trailer for ""The Bucket List"" made it look like a hilarious combination of ""Grumpy Old Men"" meet ""Odd Couple"" in a cancer ward. The Oscar-winning actors play an Abbott & Costello pair of charismatic cut-ups with cancer. Unfortunately, this warm fuzzy frolic about two terminally-ill old-times that tear off for one final fling is predictable, preposterous, and ultimately pathetic. This is the kind of movie that would make a hospice nurse snicker out of one corner of his or her mouth. No disrespect intended to hospice nurses.Our elderly heroes loiter for the first thirty minutes in a hospital, the next thirty on a round-the-world, fun-in-the-sun, travelogue thrill ride, and the last thirty minutes taking forever to die. Ironically, billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cork (paunchy Jack Nicholson of ""Anger Management"") has never been sick a day in his life. He parlayed his fortune out of privatizing health care facilities. Two beds for each room, he stipulates early in the opening scene, he doesn't operate health spas. No sooner has Cork declared this dictum than he lands in one of his own hospitals with six months to live. When he awakens, Cork demands a private room. Not possible, his right-hand man Thomas (Sean Hayes of TV's ""Will & Grace"") admonishes him. Cork's choice of a private room, Thomas points out, would undermine Cork's own dictum about low-cost hospital facilities. Thankfully, Jack Nicholson doesn't moon us like Tom Hanks did in ""Charlie Wilson's War."" Of course, what movie about chemo patients would be complete without the star in his hospital gown puking in a toilet?Auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven"") suspects that he has his own tumor when he discards his last cigarette. Unlike the quadruple divorced Cork, Chambers has been happily married to his high school sweetheart for 45 years with two financially successful grown-up sons and a daughter. The boys have made him a grandfather while his daughter has become a world-class violinist.Cork and Carter wind up in the same room but they aren't made for each other. One day, Carter scribbles out an inventory of activities on a yellow pad he'd like to do before he kicks the bucket. Generously, Cork offers to foot the bill for their adrenalin-laced adventures. Our heroes behave like overgrown adolescents. They parachute from planes, careen around in race cars, climb the Great Pyramids, and motorcycle the length of the Great Wall of China. Lastly, they share the laugh of their lives when they discover Cork's premium coffee derives its unique flavor from the digestive tract of an exotic tree cat that feeds on them.Nicholson and Freeman together aren't enough to redeem freshman writer Justin Zackman's contrived clowning about friendship, death, and dying. We're none the wiser for watching this platitudinous pabulum. ""The Bucket List"" qualifies as another loser from director Rob Reiner who once made good movies such as ""When Harry Meet Sally,"" ""The Sure Thing,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""The Princess Bride."" Lately, he has been dishing up dreck like ""North,"" ""The Ghosts of Mississippi,"" ""The Story of Us,"" ""Alex and Emma,"" and ""Rumor Has It.""The tear-jerking titans that Nicholson and Freeman play possess far too much stamina and energy as former chemotherapy patients to perform their daring feats. The skydiving scenes are the genuine item,with Nicholson and Freeman clearly in the air above th earth, but the racing scenes suffer from obvious back-projection footage. What? They could sky dive from several thousand feet for real, but they cannot drive like hellions for a quarter of a mile?Make ""The Bucket List"" the last movie you ever see!",1,"Kick ""The Bucket List""",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,3779,"['new', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'buddy', 'picture', 'downright', 'depressing', 'Indeed', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'trailer', 'Bucket', 'List', 'made', 'look', 'hilarious', 'combination', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'Men', 'meet', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'cancer', 'ward', 'Oscar-winning', 'actors', 'play', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'pair', 'charismatic', 'cut-ups', 'cancer', 'Unfortunately', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'frolic', 'two', 'terminally-ill', 'old-times', 'tear', 'one', 'final', 'fling', 'predictable', 'preposterous', 'ultimately', 'pathetic', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'hospice', 'nurse', 'snicker', 'one', 'corner', 'mouth', 'disrespect', 'intended', 'hospice', 'nurses.Our', 'elderly', 'heroes', 'loiter', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'hospital', 'next', 'thirty', 'round-the-world', 'fun-in-the-sun', 'travelogue', 'thrill', 'ride', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'taking', 'forever', 'die', 'Ironically', 'billionaire', 'hospital', 'magnate', 'Edward', 'Cork', 'paunchy', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Anger', 'Management', 'never', 'been', 'sick', 'day', 'life', 'parlayed', 'fortune', 'privatizing', 'health', 'care', 'facilities', 'Two', 'beds', 'room', 'early', 'opening', 'scene', ""n't"", 'operate', 'health', 'spas', 'sooner', 'Cork', 'declared', 'dictum', 'one', 'own', 'hospitals', 'six', 'months', 'live', 'When', 'Cork', 'private', 'room', 'Not', 'possible', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Thomas', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'TV', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Cork', 'choice', 'private', 'room', 'Thomas', 'out', 'would', 'undermine', 'Cork', 'own', 'dictum', 'low-cost', 'hospital', 'facilities', 'Thankfully', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""n't"", 'moon', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'course', 'what', 'movie', 'chemo', 'patients', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'star', 'hospital', 'gown', 'puking', 'toilet', 'Auto', 'mechanic', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Unforgiven', 'own', 'tumor', 'when', 'last', 'cigarette', 'quadruple', 'divorced', 'Cork', 'Chambers', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', '45', 'years', 'two', 'financially', 'successful', 'grown-up', 'sons', 'daughter', 'boys', 'have', 'made', 'grandfather', 'daughter', 'become', 'world-class', 'violinist.Cork', 'Carter', 'wind', 'up', 'same', 'room', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'other', 'One', 'day', 'Carter', 'out', 'inventory', 'activities', 'yellow', 'pad', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'bucket', 'Generously', 'Cork', 'foot', 'bill', 'adrenalin-laced', 'adventures', 'heroes', 'behave', 'overgrown', 'adolescents', 'parachute', 'planes', 'careen', 'around', 'race', 'cars', 'climb', 'Great', 'Pyramids', 'motorcycle', 'length', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'Lastly', 'share', 'laugh', 'lives', 'when', 'discover', 'Cork', 'premium', 'coffee', 'unique', 'flavor', 'digestive', 'tract', 'exotic', 'tree', 'cat', 'them.Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'together', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'redeem', 'freshman', 'writer', 'Justin', 'Zackman', 'contrived', 'clowning', 'friendship', 'death', 'dying', ""'re"", 'wiser', 'watching', 'platitudinous', 'pabulum', 'Bucket', 'List', 'loser', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'who', 'once', 'made', 'good', 'movies', 'such', 'When', 'Harry', 'Meet', 'Sally', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Lately', 'been', 'dishing', 'up', 'dreck', 'North', 'Ghosts', 'Mississippi', 'Story', 'Us', 'Alex', 'Emma', 'Rumor', 'tear-jerking', 'titans', 'Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'play', 'possess', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'stamina', 'energy', 'former', 'chemotherapy', 'patients', 'perform', 'daring', 'feats', 'skydiving', 'scenes', 'are', 'genuine', 'item', 'Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'clearly', 'air', 'th', 'earth', 'racing', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'obvious', 'back-projection', 'footage', 'What', 'could', 'sky', 'dive', 'several', 'thousand', 'feet', 'real', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'hellions', 'quarter', 'mile', 'Make', 'Bucket', 'List', 'last', 'movie', 'ever', 'see']",The Bucket List

It was entertaining but not really moving because we all have bucket list but throughout the course of a lifetime we don't write off everything in our lists.

1118218,AP3B615GM191G,B000YAF4MA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","When this film first hit theaters back in 2007, it spawned a whole collection of ""Bucket Lists"" (a list of things to do before you ""kick the bucket"", as the saying goes).  It seemed a little sappy and contrived (""can those two old goats really carry a film these days?"" was one of my mindsets), so it took me until now to see it.  I wish I would have ""relented"" sooner!Basically, the plot of this film centers on two characters: the filthy-rich, uptight Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and the family-loving, laid-back Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  The two happen to meet while sharing a hospital bed, and (though grudgingly at first) begin to form a bond over their advancing ages.  When Cole notices a strange ""Bucket List"" scrawled out on a napkin by Chambers, he decides to make the list a reality.  The two gallivant around the country together, embarking on such journeys as skydiving, seeing the Pyramids, and climbing a mountain (to name a few).In terms of evaluating the overall plot of the movie, it is always sincere, bordering on downright sappiness or pure cheese.  If you can get past the idea that the two ""old codgers"" are doing things that would completely tax men half their age, the story will suck you in.  If not, you won't buy in and thus miss the emotional payoff in the final scenes.However, whatever credibility issues arise from the plot, the film is so superbly acted that it almost doesn't even matter.  The chance to watch such legends as Nicholson and Freeman work their magic together is an opportunity that should not be missed.  These men, contrary to the ""pretty boys"" and ""sex symbols"" of the current generation, are the cream of the crop in terms of dramatics and emotional performances.  So, even if the plot doesn't hook you in, just watching those two stalwarts act will provide much enjoyment!Thus, though not an instant classic or anything like that, ""The Bucket List"" is a charming little film that will make you laugh, perhaps even shed a tear at the end, and leave you contemplating your own life and relationship with those around you.",4,"A Bit Cheesy, But Superbly Acted",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2082,"['When', 'film', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'back', '2007', 'spawned', 'whole', 'collection', 'Bucket', 'Lists', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'kick', 'bucket', 'saying', 'seemed', 'little', 'sappy', 'contrived', 'can', 'two', 'old', 'goats', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'days', 'was', 'one', 'mindsets', 'took', 'now', 'see', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'relented', 'sooner', 'Basically', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'characters', 'filthy-rich', 'uptight', 'Edward', 'Cole', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'family-loving', 'laid-back', 'Carter', 'Chambers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'two', 'happen', 'meet', 'sharing', 'hospital', 'bed', 'grudgingly', 'first', 'begin', 'form', 'bond', 'advancing', 'ages', 'When', 'Cole', 'strange', 'Bucket', 'List', 'scrawled', 'out', 'napkin', 'Chambers', 'make', 'list', 'reality', 'two', 'gallivant', 'country', 'together', 'embarking', 'such', 'journeys', 'skydiving', 'seeing', 'Pyramids', 'climbing', 'mountain', 'name', 'few', '.In', 'terms', 'evaluating', 'overall', 'plot', 'movie', 'always', 'sincere', 'bordering', 'downright', 'sappiness', 'pure', 'cheese', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'two', 'old', 'codgers', 'are', 'doing', 'things', 'would', 'completely', 'tax', 'men', 'age', 'story', 'will', 'suck', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'thus', 'miss', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'final', 'scenes.However', 'credibility', 'issues', 'arise', 'plot', 'film', 'so', 'superbly', 'acted', 'almost', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'chance', 'watch', 'such', 'legends', 'Nicholson', 'Freeman', 'work', 'magic', 'together', 'opportunity', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'men', 'contrary', 'pretty', 'boys', 'sex', 'symbols', 'current', 'generation', 'are', 'cream', 'crop', 'terms', 'dramatics', 'emotional', 'performances', 'So', 'even', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hook', 'just', 'watching', 'two', 'stalwarts', 'act', 'will', 'provide', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'Thus', 'not', 'instant', 'classic', 'anything', 'Bucket', 'List', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'perhaps', 'even', 'shed', 'tear', 'end', 'leave', 'contemplating', 'own', 'life', 'relationship']",The Bucket List
