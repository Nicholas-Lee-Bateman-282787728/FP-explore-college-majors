I wasnt sure if it was a 'horror' film and had an actor and showed what he did, or if it was a documentary. The best way to describe this is that it would be an uncut documentary from TLC or court tv, maybe even from Unsolved Mysteries Its a bunch of photos of him and his victims, along with some footage from that time period, along with a guy that runs a museum of weird collectable(fishs confession) and a psychologist. Obviously a lot of this stuff is disturbing, but its not really a gory movie. The bloodiest is when he whips a boy and himself. Theres even scenes of meat in an oven and being cut, but its no different then normal things.I would definetely recommend this if your interested in him",5,"This is NOT a horror movie, but a documentary",1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,764,"['first', 'saw', 'website', 'thought', 'id', 'give', 'try', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'was', ""'horror"", 'film', 'had', 'actor', 'showed', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'documentary', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'would', 'be', 'uncut', 'documentary', 'TLC', 'court', 'tv', 'maybe', 'even', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'bunch', 'photos', 'victims', 'footage', 'time', 'period', 'guy', 'museum', 'weird', 'collectable', 'fishs', 'confession', 'psychologist', 'Obviously', 'lot', 'stuff', 'disturbing', 'not', 'really', 'gory', 'movie', 'bloodiest', 'when', 'boy', 'Theres', 'even', 'scenes', 'meat', 'oven', 'being', 'cut', 'different', 'then', 'normal', 'things.I', 'would', 'definetely', 'recommend', 'interested']",Albert Fish
1046760,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B000MKXEZG,Anthony Pittore,"[2, 2]","Albert Fish, like H.H. Holmes before him, was a serial killer before serial killers were commonplace names like Ted Bundy and the Son of Sam. Even as one of the first known serial killers in America, Fish was one of the most disgusting, perverted, and vicious murderers in history. He was a vile, sadistic, and despicable child murderer & cannibal and I would be hard pressed to find many more humans to be more disgusting in this world's history.However, this review is not for the horrible man that was Albert Fish, but for the documentary, 'Albert Fish: In Sin He Found Salvation.' Before viewing, one should realize what this documentary is about. I do not believe this film's main goal was to be informative. Much of the film was about the 'shock' of the events of Albert Fish's life and crimes. Information was regularly repeated, but in just more dramatic ways. The film itself was compiled well, however. The dramatizations are well done, the structure of the film flows well, and the narration is fantastic.If you're unfamiliar with the life of Albert Fish and looking for basic information with flair, this documentary is for you. However, if you already have done your research on the monster that is Albert Fish, watch this film for nothing more than seeing what you already know exhibited in new ways.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",4,In Sin He Found Salvation,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,1339,"['Albert', 'Fish', 'H.H', 'Holmes', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'serial', 'killers', 'were', 'commonplace', 'names', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Son', 'Sam', 'Even', 'one', 'first', 'known', 'serial', 'killers', 'America', 'Fish', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disgusting', 'perverted', 'vicious', 'murderers', 'history', 'was', 'vile', 'sadistic', 'despicable', 'child', 'murderer', 'cannibal', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'many', 'more', 'humans', 'be', 'more', 'disgusting', 'world', 'history.However', 'review', 'not', 'horrible', 'man', 'was', 'Albert', 'Fish', 'documentary', ""'Albert"", 'Fish', 'Sin', 'Found', 'Salvation', 'viewing', 'one', 'should', 'realize', 'what', 'documentary', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'film', 'main', 'goal', 'was', 'be', 'informative', 'Much', 'film', 'was', ""'shock"", ""'"", 'events', 'Albert', 'Fish', 'life', 'crimes', 'Information', 'was', 'regularly', 'repeated', 'just', 'more', 'dramatic', 'ways', 'film', 'was', 'compiled', 'well', 'however', 'dramatizations', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'structure', 'film', 'well', 'narration', 'fantastic.If', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'life', 'Albert', 'Fish', 'looking', 'basic', 'information', 'flair', 'documentary', 'However', 'already', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'monster', 'Albert', 'Fish', 'watch', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'seeing', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'exhibited', 'new', 'ways.Final', 'Verdict', '7/10.-AP3-']",Albert Fish

Goes to show you you can never trust a book by its cover!My only gripe against this movie was the appearance of Joe Coleman, artist, in the middle of the movie, and he takes entirely TOO MUCH of the movie. He was given the ORIGINAL letter of this maniac, and the secretary kept the photocopy (hopefully that secrtary was fired--what an airhead!) that confessed the killing and eating of a little girl.  I didn't feel he added much insight and was entirely his own opinion.
