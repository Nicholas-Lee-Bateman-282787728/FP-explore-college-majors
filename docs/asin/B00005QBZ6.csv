674501,A3DWUM6SN3N3NR,B00005QBZ6,Brian Wallace (Co-author of It's Not Your Hair),"[2, 2]",a moderately fascinating overview of the gradual establishment of a star. DVDs have come so far since this was released that the viewer is left wanting more: more live songs and more of her actually being interviewed. I would recommend buying the recent live DVD instead and only getting this one if you must have everything by or about her.,4,for the completist,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,341,"['moderately', 'fascinating', 'overview', 'gradual', 'establishment', 'star', 'DVDs', 'have', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'released', 'viewer', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'live', 'songs', 'more', 'actually', 'being', 'interviewed', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'recent', 'live', 'DVD', 'instead', 'only', 'getting', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'everything']",N/A
674502,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005QBZ6,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 4]","If you lean towards being slightly more eclectic, this might surprise and delight you. The variety of interviews and stage performances show Jewel's rich singing tradition. She can yodel in her car or perform her music in any setting. When she sings, she becomes the music and there are moments where it feels as if music is as natural as breathing.Jewel's wild vulnerability, the soft pink lights radiating through her hair, the mixture of woman and child all make this DVD especially entertaining and meaningful. If you have ever wondered how a music CD is created, there is insight into the creative brainstorming and you get to see the photo shoot for the cover of the Spirit album.This is ten times more interesting than an unauthorized DVD. Jewel is actually singing and performing on stage. We find her on the tour bus, reading quietly while being filmed, singing in London under a chandelier, standing outside the Inner Change Coffee House where she was discovered. Jewel's brothers also make an appearance and Lenedra Carroll (Jewel's mother) talks about singing to her children and how Jewel grew up in a very artistic and musical family.What fascinating me more than anything is how Jewel adapts a song for the stage and for the audience environment in a smaller intimate setting. This alone shows how she connects with various audiences and how her music truly does appeal to the heart. I loved seeing how she tried to connect with a European audience and how she gradually won them over. This has Benefit Concert footage and you can see Jewel enjoying her trip to London.If you are a Jewel fan researching her history, then you won't want to miss this rare footage.Bonus Songs include: What's Simple Is True, Down So Long and Who Will Save Your Soul.Also look for her books:Jewel: Chasing Down the DawnA Night Without Armor: Poems~The Rebecca Review",5,Rare Footage,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,1862,"['lean', 'towards', 'being', 'slightly', 'more', 'eclectic', 'might', 'surprise', 'delight', 'variety', 'interviews', 'stage', 'performances', 'show', 'Jewel', 'rich', 'singing', 'tradition', 'can', 'yodel', 'car', 'perform', 'music', 'setting', 'When', 'music', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'music', 'as', 'natural', 'breathing.Jewel', 'wild', 'vulnerability', 'soft', 'pink', 'lights', 'radiating', 'hair', 'mixture', 'woman', 'child', 'make', 'DVD', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'meaningful', 'have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'music', 'CD', 'created', 'insight', 'creative', 'brainstorming', 'get', 'see', 'photo', 'shoot', 'cover', 'Spirit', 'album.This', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'interesting', 'unauthorized', 'DVD', 'Jewel', 'actually', 'singing', 'performing', 'stage', 'find', 'tour', 'bus', 'reading', 'quietly', 'being', 'filmed', 'singing', 'London', 'chandelier', 'standing', 'Inner', 'Change', 'Coffee', 'House', 'where', 'was', 'discovered', 'Jewel', 'brothers', 'also', 'make', 'appearance', 'Lenedra', 'Carroll', 'Jewel', 'mother', 'talks', 'singing', 'children', 'how', 'Jewel', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'artistic', 'musical', 'family.What', 'fascinating', 'more', 'anything', 'how', 'Jewel', 'song', 'stage', 'audience', 'environment', 'smaller', 'intimate', 'setting', 'alone', 'how', 'various', 'audiences', 'how', 'music', 'truly', 'appeal', 'heart', 'loved', 'seeing', 'how', 'tried', 'connect', 'European', 'audience', 'how', 'gradually', 'won', 'over', 'Benefit', 'Concert', 'footage', 'can', 'see', 'Jewel', 'enjoying', 'trip', 'London.If', 'are', 'Jewel', 'fan', 'researching', 'history', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'rare', 'footage.Bonus', 'Songs', 'include', 'What', 'Simple', 'Is', 'True', 'Down', 'So', 'Long', 'Who', 'Will', 'Save', 'Your', 'Soul.Also', 'look', 'books', 'Jewel', 'Chasing', 'Down', 'DawnA', 'Night', 'Without', 'Armor', 'Poems~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

It's fun just to watch Jewel yodle! She's so talented. It's also nice to see interviews with her family, a very unique family who lived in the harsh existence of Alaska, but that unusual environment certainly helped to shape Jewel. Thank goodness for her wise mother who guides her to follow her true self, amazing woman. You will really enjoy this concert footage and the story of the early beginnings.",5,You definately want to own this,1050796800,"04 20, 2003",2003,514,"['want', 'take', 'peek', 'world', 'extremely', 'talented', 'singer/songwriter', 'performer', 'then', 'get', 'fun', 'just', 'watch', 'Jewel', 'yodle', 'so', 'talented', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'interviews', 'family', 'very', 'unique', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'harsh', 'existence', 'Alaska', 'unusual', 'environment', 'certainly', 'helped', 'shape', 'Jewel', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'wise', 'mother', 'who', 'follow', 'true', 'self', 'amazing', 'woman', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'concert', 'footage', 'story', 'early', 'beginnings']",N/A
674505,A2SJWJX51V6S5U,B00005QBZ6,"Vick ""skoodster""","[3, 3]",I liked this DVD because it reminds me of the intimacy of a Jewel concert.  She is so much better in concert than on CD.  You have to experience her honesty in concert to appreciate the CD's.  The DVD is pretty raw and I liked that better than a finely produced DVD.  It has a lot of footage and is fast paced.  Could her brothers' look any more different than her???,4,A good show,1008201600,"12 13, 2001",2001,367,"['liked', 'DVD', 'intimacy', 'Jewel', 'concert', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'concert', 'CD', 'have', 'experience', 'honesty', 'concert', 'appreciate', 'CD', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'raw', 'liked', 'better', 'finely', 'produced', 'DVD', 'lot', 'footage', 'fast', 'paced', 'Could', 'brothers', 'look', 'more', 'different']",N/A
