Seeing it said on the back, that it was the 'thriller of the year' I decided to rent it. Boy was I ever disappointed. The movie got off to a VERY slow start and the movie only seemed to get started somewhere near the middle. After that, it just went downhill. The characters never seemed to actually connect they just spoke at one another as they passed through scenes. None of the characters came off as sympathetic. I felt like actually rooting for them to be killed off. The ending is equally anti-climatic. Overall, a boring, not at all scary movie.

628013,AHKP7P4T2QDU5,B00005JNBN,Aubrey Ward III,"[1, 2]","I rented Darkeness because all the other new releases I wanted to see were sold out for the weekend. I knew it would be a straight to video style spook fest. What I didn't expect was to actually enjoy it. As a horror film, not scary. As an occult mystery, however, this movie's got potential. I was intrigued by the plot which as you can read from the other reviews involves an old house, an unfinished ritual, and the new tenant's connection to all the weirdness.It was nice to see Anna Paquin sport some lead actress chops after her knockout ensemble performances in X-Men and X2. Usually the horror herione is a clueless flake or a pistol packing bad girl. Anna's character was just an old teen missing the US and griping about taking the bus. I was touched by the relationship between Anna's character and her little brother. A nice change from the usual sibling rivalry in films today and it gives the girl soul. Lena Olin(Alias) and Iain(Tomb Raider) were great as the parents. I agree that the cinematography and toned down effects were refreshing. And I loved the ending. I was shocked and satisfied. It's true that when compared to ""The Others"" or ""Sixth Sense"" it's not a groundbreaker but it's a worthy effort that should be viewed at least once. Alas, I can only recommend this as a rental and not a buy.",4,Could've been a little darker.,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,1316,"['rented', 'Darkeness', 'other', 'new', 'releases', 'wanted', 'see', 'were', 'sold', 'out', 'weekend', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'straight', 'video', 'style', 'spook', 'fest', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'scary', 'occult', 'mystery', 'however', 'movie', 'got', 'potential', 'was', 'intrigued', 'plot', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'old', 'house', 'unfinished', 'ritual', 'new', 'tenant', 'connection', 'weirdness.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'sport', 'lead', 'actress', 'chops', 'knockout', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'X-Men', 'X2', 'Usually', 'horror', 'herione', 'clueless', 'flake', 'pistol', 'packing', 'bad', 'girl', 'Anna', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'old', 'teen', 'missing', 'US', 'griping', 'taking', 'bus', 'was', 'touched', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'character', 'little', 'brother', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'films', 'today', 'girl', 'soul', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Alias', 'Iain', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'were', 'great', 'parents', 'agree', 'cinematography', 'toned', 'down', 'effects', 'were', 'refreshing', 'loved', 'ending', 'was', 'shocked', 'satisfied', 'true', 'when', 'compared', 'Others', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'groundbreaker', 'worthy', 'effort', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'least', 'once', 'Alas', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'rental', 'not', 'buy']",Darkness
628014,A22028GTBTIMBT,B00005JNBN,BD Obsessor,"[1, 3]","Darkness has all the makings of a great horror thriller. It puts a small family with strained relationships in an old European house and starts toying with them. The usual shadows, hallucinations, and bumps in the night begin. We learn that the people involved in the sale of the house apparently do not exist in the real sense, and nobody is quite what they seem in the end. Why then, does the film seem so flat?I think the answer lies in a lack of transition. The scenes often seem to fire out at the viewer in a rapid stream, and any reason why we should be frightened or even sympathetic is left hanging in the air. If you're a fan of Anna Paquin, you might get a sense of wanting her character to survive unscathed. The film throws away this element in the end by trying to have a dangling ending and failing.The main reason I imported this DVD rather than wait for a local version is because it has been around three years since the film was released in theatres and I hadn't heard of it until earlier this year. It is almost as if Dimension want to be bankrupt, or something. To top that off, while the DVD itself is not bad, it is hindered by a few of my favourite annoyances on the format. It seems the idea of using seamless branching to deliver a theatrical cut and a director's unrated edition on the one disc has not caught on. Perhaps the idea of selling the same film on two discs appeals more to the studio. When they do release more than one disc of the same film, one would think they could at least have the decency to include a decent number of chapter stops. You know, that key feature that help make DVD so much less a chore than VHS to watch?Bottom line, if you are a massive fan of any of the actors in this film, buy it. Otherwise, there are far better horror stories in a visual format that you could buy. Especially at this asking price, which seems more appropriate for a feature-loaded two-disc set.",4,"Okay, so I bought it because Anna Paquin is the real star",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,1928,"['Darkness', 'makings', 'great', 'horror', 'thriller', 'small', 'family', 'strained', 'relationships', 'old', 'European', 'house', 'toying', 'usual', 'shadows', 'hallucinations', 'bumps', 'night', 'begin', 'learn', 'people', 'involved', 'sale', 'house', 'apparently', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'real', 'sense', 'nobody', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'end', 'Why', 'then', 'film', 'seem', 'so', 'flat', 'think', 'answer', 'lack', 'transition', 'scenes', 'often', 'seem', 'fire', 'out', 'viewer', 'rapid', 'stream', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'frightened', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'left', 'hanging', 'air', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'might', 'get', 'sense', 'wanting', 'character', 'survive', 'unscathed', 'film', 'away', 'element', 'end', 'trying', 'have', 'dangling', 'ending', 'failing.The', 'main', 'reason', 'imported', 'DVD', 'rather', 'wait', 'local', 'version', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'earlier', 'year', 'almost', 'Dimension', 'want', 'be', 'bankrupt', 'something', 'top', 'off', 'DVD', 'not', 'bad', 'hindered', 'few', 'favourite', 'annoyances', 'format', 'idea', 'using', 'seamless', 'branching', 'deliver', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'director', 'unrated', 'edition', 'one', 'disc', 'not', 'caught', 'Perhaps', 'idea', 'selling', 'same', 'film', 'two', 'discs', 'appeals', 'more', 'studio', 'When', 'do', 'release', 'more', 'one', 'disc', 'same', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'decency', 'include', 'decent', 'number', 'chapter', 'stops', 'know', 'key', 'feature', 'help', 'make', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'chore', 'VHS', 'watch', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'massive', 'fan', 'actors', 'film', 'buy', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'horror', 'stories', 'visual', 'format', 'could', 'buy', 'Especially', 'asking', 'price', 'more', 'appropriate', 'feature-loaded', 'two-disc', 'set']",Darkness
628015,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JNBN,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","A small part of me thinks Darkness is a pretty decent movie, which is why I'm giving it 3 and a half stars.  No it's not a complete flop like many reviewers below think, and of course it's by NO means a masterpiece either but if you treat it as the Amityville Horror's baby brother, it's not so bad then.Darkness has all the ingredients of a well-made horror movie.  Lots of atmosphere, lots of uncertainty and mysteriousness taking place inside the household involving ghostly children, pretty good characters overall... perhaps the biggest problem is that Darkness tends to rely too much on the unknown and hardly ever delivers on the goods.  When you think something scary enough to blow you away is about to happen... it usually fizzles out and leaves you disappointed.  Another small problem is that the storyline is often times confusing- I mean I think we've established that a bunch of demonic children are haunting the house and targeting the younger brother in particular, but there's also the element of darkness that plays a minor role (arguably an underutilized role which is unfortunate) until close to the end.  I mean think about it- usually demonic activity occurs in the darkness anyway.  The movie writers should have gone the extra distance to focus on the element of darkness.  At least I believe the darkness should have been applied better due to the title of the movie.But yeah, the characters are pretty awesome I thought.  It basically centers around Anna Paquin's character.  She's the older teen sister, and she's determined to figure out the clues pertaining to the unexplainable attitude change of her father (played by Iain Glen) and the odd circumstances that surround her younger brother usually when he's alone in his bedroom playing with crayons on the floor (whenever they roll under his bed, get ready!)  The mother is basically a helpless lady that doesn't understand why her husband suddenly explodes in anger sometimes nor his sudden fascination with antiques, so she sits by and watches his temper flare up without explanation.  She does figure out how to handle this later on, however.  Other characters enter the picture later on, but their appearance is either unnecessary or tacked on illogically.There ARE a few good scares.  One of them occurs when the mother turns on the stove burner in the dark kitchen near the end- something awesome happens afterwards that admittedly shocked me pretty good!  The very last scene is somewhat of a disappointment.  The movie writers were going for a dramatic moment of uncertainty, but.. I dunno, I think the last scene should have played out for about 5 more minutes and *then* ended.  Oh and perhaps unintentionally, how about the scene in the beginning with the father taking his son to school and the father suddenly has a seizure and needs urgent help?  Talk about a VERY disturbing moment.  If I was the son sitting in the passengers seat, I'd be quite traumatized permanently.  This is actually the most disturbing part of the entire movie for different reasons unrelated to the main plot.Overall no, this is nothing horror fanatics haven't already seen hundreds of times before so I can't really recommend it unless you're dying for a horror.  Dying for a horror?  Wow what a bad choice of words, haha.  Seriously this movie's good but all the investigating that Anna Paquin does is nothing we haven't seen before/more thoroughly in other better movies, but the characters are interesting enough, and the suspense involving the demonic children appearing in the darkness *does* often times keep you on the edge of your seat, so it ain't all bad.",3,into the light darkness,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,3637,"['small', 'part', 'Darkness', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'half', 'stars', 'not', 'complete', 'flop', 'many', 'reviewers', 'think', 'course', 'NO', 'masterpiece', 'either', 'treat', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'baby', 'brother', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'then.Darkness', 'ingredients', 'well-made', 'horror', 'movie', 'Lots', 'atmosphere', 'lots', 'uncertainty', 'mysteriousness', 'taking', 'place', 'household', 'involving', 'ghostly', 'children', 'pretty', 'good', 'characters', 'overall', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Darkness', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'unknown', 'hardly', 'ever', 'goods', 'When', 'think', 'something', 'scary', 'enough', 'blow', 'away', 'happen', 'usually', 'out', 'disappointed', 'small', 'problem', 'storyline', 'often', 'times', 'confusing-', 'mean', 'think', ""'ve"", 'established', 'bunch', 'demonic', 'children', 'are', 'haunting', 'house', 'targeting', 'younger', 'brother', 'particular', 'also', 'element', 'darkness', 'minor', 'role', 'arguably', 'underutilized', 'role', 'unfortunate', 'close', 'end', 'mean', 'think', 'it-', 'usually', 'demonic', 'activity', 'darkness', 'anyway', 'movie', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'extra', 'distance', 'focus', 'element', 'darkness', 'least', 'believe', 'darkness', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'applied', 'better', 'due', 'title', 'movie.But', 'yeah', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'thought', 'basically', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'character', 'older', 'teen', 'sister', 'determined', 'figure', 'out', 'clues', 'pertaining', 'unexplainable', 'attitude', 'change', 'father', 'played', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'odd', 'circumstances', 'surround', 'younger', 'brother', 'usually', 'when', 'alone', 'bedroom', 'playing', 'crayons', 'floor', 'whenever', 'roll', 'bed', 'get', 'ready', 'mother', 'basically', 'helpless', 'lady', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'husband', 'suddenly', 'anger', 'sometimes', 'sudden', 'fascination', 'antiques', 'watches', 'temper', 'flare', 'up', 'explanation', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'handle', 'later', 'however', 'Other', 'characters', 'enter', 'picture', 'later', 'appearance', 'unnecessary', 'tacked', 'illogically.There', 'ARE', 'few', 'good', 'scares', 'One', 'when', 'mother', 'stove', 'burner', 'dark', 'kitchen', 'end-', 'something', 'awesome', 'afterwards', 'admittedly', 'shocked', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'uncertainty', 'but..', 'dunno', 'think', 'last', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'about', '5', 'more', 'minutes', '*then*', 'ended', 'Oh', 'perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'how', 'scene', 'beginning', 'father', 'taking', 'son', 'school', 'father', 'suddenly', 'seizure', 'urgent', 'help', 'Talk', 'VERY', 'disturbing', 'moment', 'was', 'son', 'sitting', 'passengers', 'seat', ""'d"", 'be', 'quite', 'traumatized', 'permanently', 'actually', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'different', 'reasons', 'unrelated', 'main', 'plot.Overall', 'nothing', 'horror', 'fanatics', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'dying', 'horror', 'Dying', 'horror', 'Wow', 'what', 'bad', 'choice', 'words', 'haha', 'Seriously', 'movie', 'good', 'investigating', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before/more', 'thoroughly', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'suspense', 'involving', 'demonic', 'children', 'appearing', 'darkness', '*does*', 'often', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad']",Darkness

628017,A1ARQYFYXAL4I,B00005JNBN,bonsai chicken,"[3, 3]","Forty years ago, something awful happened at the house.  One child escaped, too traumatized to remember anything.  The others were never found.Now an American family moves into the Spanish country estate, which is plagued by unexplainable electrical problems.  Then more frightening things begin to occur.  Teenaged Regina (Anna Paquin - X-MEN) immediately suspects that something is wrong with the house.  Her little brother is making disturbing drawings in his sketchbook, and bruises have appeared on his body with no discernible cause.  Her mother (Lena Olin - ROMEO IS BLEEDING) believes there is a mundane explanation and writes her daughter's behavior off as normal teen angst, and in any case she has her hands full with her husband, whose previously dormant mental illness is resurfacing.  Objects move by themselves; specters lurk in the shadows.Yes, it's pretty clich&eacute; in a lot of ways.  The script isn't particularly sharp, and there's some terrible acting by the actor who plays the father.  What saves it is its very stylish direction and a thoroughly convincing performance by Paquin.  (Her fans will want to see this film regardless, as she is front and center for the entire picture - emphasis on the ""front."")  I liked the film's subtlety and deliberate pacing, and its, ah, dark ending.  A nice twist (no, they're not all dead) and a few chills here and there, too.Extras on the DVD include a brief (under four minutes) behind-the-scenes featurette, as well as trailers for this film, SIN CITY and CURSED.DARKNESS sat on the shelf for a couple years before finally being released to theatres under the radar in 2004.

In fact, I turned to the special features and found a behind the scenes featurette there, but even that left me with nothing after it ended abruptly in three minutes.On the one hand, the plot is completely contrived and obvious: an eclipse is approaching and a ceremony involving children must be performed during the event. On the other hand, the plot is completely preposterous and unexplained: ""the darkness"" is coming, a darkness that is pure evil. The characters discover it through an old book that they mysteriously know about. None of it makes any sense. If I tried to explain it, you would be left shaking your head, just as I am thinking about it.The good thing about this movie is the camerawork.

Darkness is not so much of a abstract thing in this movie, but a character(devious like the Norse God Loki). The human beings immersed in it are somehow unaware of all of its inner trappings until the very end. Just like any great disaster flick. Some may say Darkness does not explore its theme well enough. I beg to differ, the scene where Anna Paquin is left alone in the house to fend for herself against the slippery black marauders is wrought full of tension. The theme of darkness is not so much ""Oh my Gosh! What just happened!""But more so ""Imagine if this should happen.""Consider this. Any unimaginative film maker can make dead children pop out of nowhere and hum some inconsequential scary tune or whisper some lines. What the director does here in darkness is place the titular entities right next to you..in a place where the most extreme violence or death could be delivered without you even noticing it until it is too late. Now that, my freinds is terror.Usually in films, I detest understatement. It is most times confusing and does not make a good show.However, when used properly..as in this film..it can become a great bane to the over all effect of the film.The understatement here comes with a price..paid in full by the end of this gem.I digress..watch this movie and see for yourself what you can derive from it.

His latest effort is Darkness, made in Spain only to be acquired and promptly buried by Dimension Films for two years before a low-key theatrical release with cuts to make it more accessible. It has finally been released on DVD in an uncut form.Director Juame Balaguero wisely creates a foreboding sense of dread early on and never lets up. For example, Regina returns home from school on a rainy night and spots a mysterious figure in the darkness. It's a brief shot but creepy nonetheless. He uses fleeting, sudden jolts of disturbing imagery. Shadowy figures flash by the camera as he messes with our perception and imagination. As befitting the title, the director plays around with the absence of light, with shadows and with what we can't see. There's a scene where a character walks down a hallway that becomes darker and darker until he is engulfed by the darkness. It is one of the film's most striking images.Balaguero thankfully eschews a trendy young cast of TV actors from UPN or the WB in favour of someone like Paquin who plays a smart and resourceful young woman who is by no means a shrinking violet. The only glaring clich&eacute; that Darkness resorts to is the old chestnut where the bad guy explains his master plan thereby giving our heroine enough time to escape. Otherwise, this film is a nice alternative to formulaic movies like Cursed and the upcoming House of Wax remake.""Darkness Illuminated: Behind the Scenes of Darkness"" features brief clips of the director and the cast with clips from the movie.

628030,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JNBN,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","Speaking as a veteran of many horror films, I find myself unable to comprehend the low ratings this film receives.  My only regret about watching Darkness is the fact that I saw the rated rather than the unrated version.  The film is a little less than perfect, but it is, without question, one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.  In my opinion, Jaume Balaquero is the most exciting horror director working today.  Like The Nameless, Darkness is a visual masterpiece of cinematography - although Balaquero probably tried a little bit too hard with this film.  All of the random visuals are a little overdone, the movie drags a little longer than it should have for maximum effect, and the ending is - most unfortunately - far too ambiguous, but Balaquero knows horror - how to approach it and how to present it.It's amazing how effective the haunted house motif still remains - as long as it's done right, incredible things are possible.  Apart from the ending, this film is done absolutely right.  The house in question here is inherently evil and most definitely haunted - although, as in real life, the greatest dangers to the innocent are men with evil in their hearts.  Forty years ago, six children disappeared, but one escaped - although he could not remember enough to help the cops catch the evildoers.  Now, forty years later, a family has moved into the gloomy house where the crimes took place - but only the children sense the danger lurking there.  Young Paul retreats within himself and begins showing unexplained bruises around his neck, while teenaged daughter Regina (Anna Paquin) picks up on the evil presence and tries to protect her brother; the parents are less than useless.  Mark, the dad, has some kind of seizure and then begins changing in ways that beg for a straightjacket, and all the while the mom just tells everyone not to worry.  Regina and her boyfriend do some investigating and discover the true history of the house, its evil design and ritualistic intent, but their search takes Regina places she would never have dreamed of going.  It's all pretty much up to her, though, as her parents won't listen to her and poor Paul is helplessly haunted by the ghosts of several evil children.  Darkness comes with a nice little bundle of surprises; not only did the story take a couple of turns I didn't foresee, it had me guessing about other possible surprises.The cinematography of this film is brilliant and the true secret of its palpable creepiness.  You'll be looking at a dark room and then a lightning strike will silhouette these creepy children just standing there; you've got shadows that move just outside the peripheral vision of characters; and periodic sets of random, disturbing images also contribute greatly to the overall effect.  These latter scenes are used too often in the latter half of the film, but it's a minor quibble at best.  The only thing wrong with the movie is the ending, which is just too ambiguous to satisfy anyone.  Darkness does not have a five-star story, but it's just so incredibly creepy that I cannot give it less than five stars overall.  Anna Paquin proves more than capable of carrying the film single-handedly whenever she needs to.  In my opinion, Darkness ranks right up there among the creepiest horror films made in the last two decades - now I just have to get my hands on the unrated version.",5,Balaquero hits another perfect 10 on the creepiness meter,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,3382,"['Speaking', 'veteran', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'find', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'low', 'ratings', 'film', 'only', 'regret', 'watching', 'Darkness', 'fact', 'saw', 'rated', 'rather', 'unrated', 'version', 'film', 'little', 'less', 'perfect', 'question', 'one', 'creepiest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'opinion', 'Jaume', 'Balaquero', 'most', 'exciting', 'horror', 'director', 'working', 'today', 'Nameless', 'Darkness', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'cinematography', 'Balaquero', 'probably', 'tried', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'random', 'visuals', 'are', 'little', 'overdone', 'movie', 'little', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'maximum', 'effect', 'ending', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'far', 'too', 'ambiguous', 'Balaquero', 'horror', 'how', 'approach', 'how', 'present', 'it.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'effective', 'haunted', 'house', 'motif', 'still', 'as', 'long', 'done', 'right', 'incredible', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'Apart', 'ending', 'film', 'done', 'absolutely', 'right', 'house', 'question', 'here', 'inherently', 'evil', 'most', 'definitely', 'haunted', 'real', 'life', 'greatest', 'dangers', 'innocent', 'are', 'men', 'evil', 'hearts', 'Forty', 'years', 'ago', 'six', 'children', 'disappeared', 'one', 'escaped', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'enough', 'help', 'cops', 'catch', 'evildoers', 'Now', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'family', 'moved', 'gloomy', 'house', 'where', 'crimes', 'took', 'place', 'only', 'children', 'sense', 'danger', 'lurking', 'there', 'Young', 'Paul', 'retreats', 'showing', 'unexplained', 'bruises', 'neck', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'up', 'evil', 'presence', 'tries', 'protect', 'brother', 'parents', 'are', 'less', 'useless', 'Mark', 'dad', 'kind', 'seizure', 'then', 'changing', 'ways', 'beg', 'straightjacket', 'mom', 'just', 'everyone', 'not', 'worry', 'Regina', 'boyfriend', 'do', 'investigating', 'discover', 'true', 'history', 'house', 'evil', 'design', 'ritualistic', 'intent', 'search', 'Regina', 'places', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'dreamed', 'going', 'pretty', 'much', 'though', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'poor', 'Paul', 'helplessly', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'several', 'evil', 'children', 'Darkness', 'nice', 'little', 'bundle', 'surprises', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'story', 'take', 'couple', 'turns', 'did', ""n't"", 'foresee', 'had', 'guessing', 'other', 'possible', 'surprises.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'brilliant', 'true', 'secret', 'palpable', 'creepiness', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'dark', 'room', 'then', 'lightning', 'strike', 'will', 'silhouette', 'creepy', 'children', 'just', 'standing', 'there', ""'ve"", 'got', 'shadows', 'move', 'just', 'peripheral', 'vision', 'characters', 'periodic', 'sets', 'random', 'disturbing', 'images', 'also', 'contribute', 'greatly', 'overall', 'effect', 'latter', 'scenes', 'are', 'used', 'too', 'often', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'minor', 'quibble', 'best', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'ending', 'just', 'too', 'ambiguous', 'satisfy', 'anyone', 'Darkness', 'not', 'have', 'five-star', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'incredibly', 'creepy', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'overall', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'more', 'capable', 'carrying', 'film', 'single-handedly', 'whenever', 'opinion', 'Darkness', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'creepiest', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'now', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'hands', 'unrated', 'version']",Darkness
628031,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00005JNBN,Danno,"[1, 1]","This is a spoiler-free review of ""Darkness: Unrated Version.""""Darkness"" isn't nearly as terrible as the critics universally agreed when the film was released in December 2003. It's yet another entry in the ""Haunted House"" subgenre of horror films, and how much you enjoy it depends partly on how familiar you are with this type of film. If you've seen too many of them recently, you'll probably find ""Darkness"" both dull and cliche-ridden. If you haven't, you might find yourself enjoying parts of this film while scratching your head at others. I quite enjoyed much of it.The strength of the film lies in its minimalistic old-school techniques to send shudder down your spine. Unlike the recent remakes of both ""The Haunting"" and ""The House on Haunted Hill,"" ""Darkness"" doesn't use computer-generated graphics to conjure up demons and ghosts. Rather, it uses clever editing, sound effects and lighting to convey the building paranoia that comes from living in a haunted house. I also liked the idea that the teenaged protagonist Regina (Anna Paquin)is neither a sexpot nor a superheroine. Through most of the film she is realistically resourceful, and geniunely troubled about the many problems her family faces even prior to the hauntings.On the downside, we have a stereotypical ""European""-style production in which the actors appear to have minimal rehearsal time and are encouraged to improvise their lines.

628036,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00005JNBN,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[1, 4]","""Darkness"" is a paradox. On one hand the film achieves a primal terror, and it has sequences that are much scarier than most of the horror crap being turned out these days. At least this movie was not named after a bodily fluid and didn't star that ""7th Heaven"" kid. On the other hand, the movie could be better, and some parts tend to feel artificial and drag. Now normally when reviewing a horror movie, I don't mark it down for artificialness, but this feels really, really fake. Now, I didn't catch this movie in the theaters, but I thought I would rent it to see if it was as bad as critics said. I wasn't expecting much, and perhaps that's why I didn't mind it, but I only expect alot from movies I have been waiting to see for a while, like ""White Noise"" (terrible) or ""The Aviator"" (pretty good). This movie is not a Speilberg movie or even a Brian Singer film. The movie, putting it frankly, is good and effectively frightening, but it is unoriginal to the tenth degree. Shadows of ""The Shining"" and ""Se7en"" are present throughout the moie, and of course there is the requisite scene where the troubled teenage daughter has to make a decision that may or may not hurt a loved one. After the halfway point, the movie loses its feel of a more independant, low budget film and takes horror full circle. This may be good for some people, but others, like me, will think the change is too abrupt.The PG-13 rated movie has parts that will make you say ""This is SOO PG-13"", like the scene where the father bangs on his sons door yelling and freaking this and frigging you and fricking that. The three times the f-word is used is used towards a repair man, and I couldn't help thinking that they should have used their limited supply towards the son, so that the scene would not have sounded so goofy. Althought the DVD boasts ""shocking unrated footage"", the whole thing in its entirety is not that shocking. The only thing actually added from the theatrical release is that the blade performing the tracectomy is scene going into the cadavers throat, and no blood is even seen! Well, actually a little is. We see the blade enter the throat and a drop of blood. Shocking. And it looks so fake it could be a cartoon. From what I've read, the DVD is just a ploy to get people to buy it since it was somewhat of a theatrical flop. I heard somewhere that the traceotomy scene is on the DVD just as it was in the PG-13 version, and that the only thing changed is the tiny drop of blood. Believe me, the only reason this DVD is ""unrated"" is because without that subtitle it would just have a slightly changed content description on the back of the box. Currently it is rated PG-13 for ""Disturbing Images, Intense Terror Sequences, Thematic Elements, And Language"", the DVD should be rated PG-13 for ""Violence, Disturbing Images, Terror, Thematic Content, And Language"". I have no clue what thematic elements are, but they must be something to do with sex or something. I'm just kidding of course about the sex thing, but I have no clue what they are.When ""Darkness"" first starts out, it looks promising. It starts with a kid being interviewed about a ritual that he escaped from narrowly. The entire sequence is intercut with images (and they're disturbing, too!) of kids being chased by sinister looking people in cloaks. A disadvantage of the film is that many things happen in the 102 minutes that this movie runs, but alot of the things that happen have no explanation to how they are connected. The scene with the father and son in the car when the father has the first seizure goes on for about ten minutes, but it only needed a two minute setup. Eight minutes are spent on the father honking his horn and getting the other drivers mad at him. All the horn honking gave me a headache.""Darkness"", although better than expected, has been getting made for five decades. Perhaps that is why it was delayed almost three years. For every stupid part, there is a scary one, and for every plot hole there is an explanation for another question that was raised. Half this movie is spent sitting around watching the power go out, and it gets old after about the tenth time the power dies. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheesecake. It's hard to get through, and when it's over you don't want much more. The Spanish countryside stereotyping doesn't work well either. The movie tries to be beautiful and picturesque, but it comes off as half-hearted and hackneyed.The plot of the movie revolves around a ritual performed in 1962 during the solar eclipse. It involved seven children being slaughtered to free the evil inside of them, and although the movie never makes it clear, I believe it was some sort of Satanic thing. Flash forward forty years later. Regina (Anna Paquin) has just moved into the house that the rituals were performed in along with her family, mother Maria (Lena Olin), father Mark (Iain Glenn), and brother Paul (Stephan Enquist). They of course do not know about the ritual, and they are soon the prey of the stirring ghosts that still inhabit the house. The movie requires quite a leap of faith in terms of the plot, as one of the members of the family (I will not say who), has come back from the sixties and now lives in the house as part of the family (they are the kid that escapes). The moie asks us to believe this and the plot twist that leads up to it, but I don't buy it.At the 80 minute mark, when the climax starts, people are worn out (I know I was) because the movie kind of catapults us into the action and the violence without checking back with the characters. The movie has some flaws, but it is good and scary for the most part. Even a scene where the ghost kids call Regina and tell her they are watching her and call her a bitch, while funny that they have no reason to call her that, and also because it's always funny to hear kids swear (especially girl scouts, like in ""Dodgeball""). What the movie needed was a larger amount of action and not just cram 20 minutes of it into the end. A good movie all in all, but it could have ended in a clearer way, and perhaps it was a sequel setup, but I was unconvinced.""Darkness"" is rated PG-13.  Ignore the ""unrated"" version, it's just a longer PG-13 version, and had I not heard that I probably would not have rented it. It is true what you hear. ""Darkness"" may not be the best film of the year, but it is very scary and pulls off some great jump moments.",3,"Better Than Expected, Although We Have All Seen It Before",1116115200,"05 15,

628037,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B00005JNBN,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 2]","I wish I could have given this film four stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to do that. This is not a bad film, it just suffers from some problems that could have been avoided if the filmmakers had spent a little more time with it. First off, there wasn't enough development of the backstory about the house and the missing children. There was an event which had occurred in this house forty years earlier which was central to the current storyline, but we are told practically nothing about this event except a few flashes of children running and a few passing references. What went on there? Why were the children running, and from what were they running? Secondly, not enough time was given to developing the current cast of characters. We don't know them well enough to really be all that concerned about their well being. It takes almost the whole movie just to makes us feel like we know these people. Why take so long? Third, the plotline was disjointed in the sense that we had difficulty following what was happening. We could see what the people were doing and hear what they were saying, but so often we were just asking what this all meant. Some scenes seemed disconnected from the story. The bottom line, I think, was time. The filmmakers needed to fill in these gaps to make the story complete and meaningful and easier to understand. As I said in the beginning, this is not a bad film. It had the potential to be a really great film. I think Anna Paquin did a great job as usual. She seemed to be the glue that held everything together for us. And I admired the way she was so protective of her younger brother Paul. And I can't say enough about young Stephan Enquist, the young actor who played Paul. He was wonderful. I couldn't believe that he had never acted before, but it's true. This is his only acting credit to date. But he was as talented as he was adorable. I found out that he was half Swedish and half Spanish, so that explains his good looks. I watched this film twice before I wrote this review because I wanted to be sure I understood what I wanted to say. And I think I've done that. I wanted to be as fair as possible to this film. I do not want to discourage anyone from watching ""Darkness,"" I just want you to watch it carefully and try to bear in mind that there IS more to the story than you see on the screen. If you do this, I think you will come away with at least a little respect and appreciation for what the filmmakers were trying to do. I hope my thoughts have been of at least some help to you.

Now that it's out on video, it's a movie that's well worth picking up on Amazon used as long as you don't go in expecting too much.The story is about a family from America that moves into a house in Spain, where a murder happened 40 years ago. Anna Paquin and her mom don't get along and there are many scenes  where Anna stomps around and snorts in the throes of teen angst. Anna's brother is kind of like Danny Torrance from ""The Shining"" and he is tormented by the ghosts in the house.  Round this dysfunctional family out with a father who has some vague kind of mental disorder that occasionally causes him to have seizures and turns him into a raving lunatic. If that sounds familiar, it's because the character is a close relative of Jack from ""The Shining"".  Essentially what you've got is: The Torrance Family goes to Europe! (with Anna Paquin).In other words, the set-up is very familiar and will feel somewhat predictable to anyone who's seen ""The Shining"", ""Amityville Horror (either the original or the remake) and ""Poltergeist"". It is to the credit of the director, Jaume Belaguero, that the movie doesn't have you chapter skipping as soon as you see the similatrities. The movie is shot and edited beautifully, and tends to make up for a somewhat maudlin plotline.But then the movie becomes a little hard to follow. In a reveal that almost rivals the ridiculous discovery of the torture chamber in the basement in the Amityville Horror remake, we find out that  Anna's house is a demonic temple built by Satanist. 40 years ago, this Satanic Contractor attempted to bring the end of the world (why do people want that?) by performing a ritual that involved the murder of 7 children.  The ritual didn't work because one of the kids escaped. Now, 40 years later, the lunar eclipse is coming, thereby offering another chance for the end of the world. Poor unlucky Anna and her family. That's what you get for moving to Spain, I guess. After the reveal of the coming eclipse and the ritual, and multiple scenes of Anna  swimming in the pool and being angsty, I lost interest and starting playing with my bellybutton lint.Still, Jaume shoots a good movie, so I kept watching. Even if it was between lint-picking stints. To say that the movie becomes confusing in the end is not quite accurate. That's not what I mean when I say that it becomes hard to follow. It's not that it's confusing, it's just that I completely lost interest and just wanted the credits to roll. Basically, the last reel of the movie involves Anna getting kidnapped by some old guy (who I think might be the Satanic Contractor). She escapes. She runs home and her father starts choking on something. Mom gives him an emergency tracheotomy, and then he dies. And then the eclipse comes. And then evil is unleashed on the world. The end.Jaume Belaguero has directed a beautifully shot amalgamation of every haunted house movie ever made. The only thing that (thank god) didn't make an appearance in this story was the American Indian Burial Ground.  In the end, it's not good enough to watch more than once, but not bad enough to deserve the scathing reviews it has gotten. One thing that's clear from this movie is that Jaume Belaguero is a talented director. He just needs to let someone else do the writing.",3,Spanishining,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,3476,"['***', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '***Darkness', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'horror', 'tale', 'probably', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'accompanied', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Now', 'out', 'video', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Amazon', 'used', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'too', 'much.The', 'story', 'family', 'America', 'house', 'Spain', 'where', 'murder', 'happened', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'mom', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Anna', 'around', 'snorts', 'throes', 'teen', 'angst', 'Anna', 'brother', 'kind', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'Shining', 'tormented', 'ghosts', 'house', 'Round', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'father', 'who', 'vague', 'kind', 'mental', 'disorder', 'occasionally', 'have', 'seizures', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'familiar', 'character', 'close', 'relative', 'Jack', 'Shining', 'Essentially', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Torrance', 'Family', 'Europe', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'other', 'words', 'set-up', 'very', 'familiar', 'will', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Shining', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'original', 'remake', 'Poltergeist', 'credit', 'director', 'Jaume', 'Belaguero', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'chapter', 'skipping', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'similatrities', 'movie', 'shot', 'edited', 'beautifully', 'make', 'up', 'somewhat', 'maudlin', 'plotline.But', 'then', 'movie', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'reveal', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'discovery', 'torture', 'chamber', 'basement', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'remake', 'find', 'out', 'Anna', 'house', 'demonic', 'temple', 'built', 'Satanist', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Satanic', 'Contractor', 'attempted', 'bring', 'end', 'world', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'want', 'performing', 'ritual', 'involved', 'murder', '7', 'children', 'ritual', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'one', 'kids', 'escaped', 'Now', '40', 'years', 'later', 'lunar', 'eclipse', 'coming', 'thereby', 'offering', 'chance', 'end', 'world', 'Poor', 'unlucky', 'Anna', 'family', 'what', 'get', 'moving', 'Spain', 'guess', 'reveal', 'coming', 'eclipse', 'ritual', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'Anna', 'swimming', 'pool', 'being', 'angsty', 'lost', 'interest', 'starting', 'playing', 'bellybutton', 'lint.Still', 'Jaume', 'good', 'movie', 'kept', 'watching', 'Even', 'was', 'lint-picking', 'stints', 'say', 'movie', 'confusing', 'end', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'not', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'hard', 'follow', 'not', 'confusing', 'just', 'completely', 'lost', 'interest', 'just', 'wanted', 'credits', 'roll', 'Basically', 'last', 'reel', 'movie', 'Anna', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'Satanic', 'Contractor', 'home', 'father', 'choking', 'something', 'Mom', 'emergency', 'tracheotomy', 'then', 'then', 'eclipse', 'then', 'evil', 'unleashed', 'world', 'end.Jaume', 'Belaguero', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'amalgamation', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'thing', 'thank', 'god', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'story', 'was', 'American', 'Indian', 'Burial', 'Ground', 'end', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'deserve', 'scathing', 'gotten', 'One', 'thing', 'clear', 'movie', 'Jaume', 'Belaguero', 'talented', 'director', 'just', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'writing']",Darkness

628047,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JNBN,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","DARKNESS is a movie struggling under the burden of an impossibly puerile script.  Had the writer Fernando de Felipe and director/writer Jaume Balaguer&oacute; taken a bit more time to develop the underlying basis for this Gothic suspense excursion into night they may have had a stronger result.  As it is the reasons for all of the occult intervention in a strange house somewhere in Spain comes in bits and pieces and ultimately seem barely interesting and silly.Mark (Iain Glen), his wife Maria (Lena Olin) and their two children Regina (Anna Paquin) and Paul (Stephan Enquist) move into an old house unoccupied for forty years, a house that has problematic electricity and water and odd sounds that go bump in the night.  The family's doctor/grandfather Albert Rua (Giancarlo Giannini) appears at times when the family needs support and in this new home those times proliferate.  Mark is afflicted with a disease called 'Harrington Syndrome' which causes episodes of wild behavior supposedly controlled by meds which nurse wife Maria administers.  Paul is the most frightened or sensitive to the bizarre occurrences that happen only in the dark: he gains strange bruises, sees darkened children, notices movements and other nocturnal scaries.  Regina is the comfort to Paul and believes the 'delusions' his father and mother deny and seeks help from a local lad Carlos (Fele Mart&iacute;nez)  who researches the house and discovers that it was built by an architect (a man who stalks the house at night) who informs Carlos that the house was built for strange reasons: a ritual occurred forty years ago involving the death of six children (meant to be seven but one escaped).  It is only with the death of that seventh child at the hands of one who loves him that the curse will be lifted.Yes, this is really the tale...how this disintegrating family comes to grips with the dark history and demands of the house and who is to be the seventh 'child' is the gist of the story.  Had the writers given us more perhaps we would care more, but with so many threads of unexplained twists and turns the suspense fails to peak.  The actors, having such poor material from which to work, stumble through the tale without gaining our concern or support.The saving grace of this outing is in the moody cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez: the look of the film is excellent enough to justify simply turning off the sound track to allow your imagination to make a story out of the visuals.

The beggining was very abrupt, and left you with a feeling like they didn't finish that up.  It just flashed a bunch of clips of kids running, and the house and the title appeared.  Along with the cast.  And then, it moved on to the beggining.  With the family all happy 'cause they've got their new house down in Spain.  Well, for some unexplained reason, the main guy (I forgot everyone's names it was so bad) has a wierd seizure-type-thing in his car in the middle of traffic.  Could this be linked to the ghosts that inhabit that house?!?!This film is abundant with pointless scenes.  Like, the one I like to call 'the girl-in-the-wheel-chair scene'.  That scene had no explanation to it.  AT ALL.  If you view this piece of crap, you will know what I am talking about.  There were generic scare scenes that obviously weren't scary in the least, and they were pretty laughable too.  Like, the scene where that old man is trying to escape the ever-growing darkness in a building.  SCARY.  OH MAN.  Some of the lines in the film were laughable near the end, and had the entire theater cracking up.  Oh man.  Just...no.  NO.  It also had an abrupt ending aswell as an abrupt beggining, and it left the audience booing and flipping the screen off.

I find many of them unfair and lacking evidence to state their cases. In my opinion, I just don't think that some people put the effort into understanding this movie as they should have done.If you pay VERY close attention to the story line, the terror of it is insurmountable. The effect of the story is very conveying, weighing down on your mind and ultimately, sending a chill down your spine. Sure, this plot line may have been seen a million times before. But, in this day and age, what is original anymore?Another set of complaints was how the cast was terrible. I will concede that the cast could have been a bit better acted. But, hey, it works. The cast's acting did nothing to draw attention away from the central story line. Sorry if all film companies can't hire actors like Sarah Michelle Gellar or anything. This is the best that they can do everyone. Cut them a little slack.As the old saying goes, ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" This is very true in regards to this movie.

The mother is a debonaire, annoying woman who has no interest whatever in what's going on, only affecting an air of sophistication.The important one, of course, is Regina. She discovers through a weird old handicapped man that the house was once employed by cultists for the use of human sacrifice, namely children, and that she should get the ever scribbling young Paul out of the house as quickly as possible.

628066,A2AVSKPLMDEBJT,B00005JNBN,"LILyte Review ""Mercy""","[2, 5]","Fear is an individual thing as far as what scares the soul in us to such a degree that it will continue to haunt us long after we witness it, or in this case, the movie. It seems that from reading the reviews here that the notion of 'fear' is so diverse that we can basically place them into two groups. First we have the new wave horror thriller type movies that the current generation of youngsters seems to relate to and rave about like Soul Survivors or Urban Legends where the fear is forced upon you for the purpose of creating excitement to the paying viewers. The filming angles is an obvious giveaway, like the victims hope you get scared as well. Thus the terror just doesn't seem real at all but since these kids have grown accustomed to the type of horror where blood gore and half nude sexy girls is the requirement on the menu to wet your pallet, then it is good enough. Second is the type of terror that knows how to tap within our fears where there are no boundaries as it grows until the climax is ultimately reach but it will continue on. Your body and mind will feel that blood chilling and un-nerving fear, that you will not be able to go to sleep without worrying what might happen next long after witnessing it. Thus the nightmares begins. This is horror in that old school tradition where our fear are genuine, pure and simple.Genuine horror is something that youngsters have find difficult to grasp because they are incapable to understand the true nature of fear. They are expecting to be force fed with an onslaught of chills and excitement to satisfy their brainwash pallets so they won't feel rip off for spending money to see it. Fear has a price that money can't touch. We have boat loads of bad movies in the name of horror. If viewers don't get what they expect, then they will complain that it was not scary enough or at all, or it don't make sense...yada yada blah. They just don't get it.With that said, this movie did scare me in a way that i haven't been been scared in such a long time. It seems to stayed with me when i am alone in the dark that i have not yet been able to shake off. Maybe it's the atmospherics feel which it presents itself. The cinematography is utterly outstanding here...a very important element. The director Jaume Balagueno knows what he is doing in this movie and the point come across quite well by understanding how fear works which he accomplished the right way, without hollywood telling him what to do or else. I have to say that the quiet star in this movie, Anna Paguin, was brilliant as she tries to discover the underlining dark secrets from the past. She is really underrated as an actress because her performance was sensational as she showcase her honest expressions of inner fear that will have you believing...very ethentic. Her looks is made for horror movies, as the victim unfortunately. The latest Amityville Horror remake just didn't get it right like the original one did...they can learn a thing or two from Darkness.I have seen both the rated and unrated version which there are some noticeable additional footage for added creepiness. Being the owner of the unrated version, i do feel compelled to own the original one as well due to the possible future designation of this movie to be label as a horror genre classic after a few years. Seeing the original on the big screen was worthwhile because it had me trembling in my shoes so I have to say it does make a different whether you watch it in the theater or at home. If you watch it at home, just set up the home theater 5 way speaker system to a nice setting, turn out the lights and be prepared. Your journey into the world of fear is about to begin.I do recommend Darkness if you are a true fan of horror who can appreciate what fear is and is not. It might creep the daylights out of you when you least expected and stir your mind to wonder what is next, not forced upon just to see you jump. Keep in mind, this is not a great horror movie but it is one of the better ones that i haven't seen in a long time and has the making to become a classic. We just have to wait and see for now. The 'Spotlight Review' above, more or less, understand what i am talking about. If you really want to see top notch horror of the supernatural at its finest, then check out Rosemary's Baby which i also wrote a review on awhile back. That one will put you in a state of fear for a long while after you witness it because it will change you. In fact, you might want to think twice before viewing it because not everyone can handle the terror that awaits if you do.",4,Anna Paguin witness it.....are you ready as well?,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,4592,"['Fear', 'individual', 'thing', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'soul', 'such', 'degree', 'will', 'continue', 'haunt', 'long', 'witness', 'case', 'movie', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'notion', ""'fear"", 'so', 'diverse', 'can', 'basically', 'place', 'two', 'groups', 'First', 'have', 'new', 'wave', 'horror', 'thriller', 'type', 'movies', 'current', 'generation', 'youngsters', 'relate', 'rave', 'like', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'where', 'fear', 'forced', 'purpose', 'creating', 'excitement', 'paying', 'viewers', 'filming', 'angles', 'obvious', 'giveaway', 'victims', 'hope', 'get', 'scared', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', 'terror', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'kids', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'type', 'horror', 'where', 'blood', 'gore', 'half', 'nude', 'sexy', 'girls', 'requirement', 'menu', 'wet', 'pallet', 'then', 'good', 'enough', 'Second', 'type', 'terror', 'how', 'tap', 'fears', 'where', 'are', 'boundaries', 'climax', 'ultimately', 'reach', 'will', 'continue', 'body', 'mind', 'will', 'feel', 'blood', 'chilling', 'un-nerving', 'fear', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'sleep', 'worrying', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next', 'long', 'witnessing', 'Thus', 'nightmares', 'horror', 'old', 'school', 'tradition', 'where', 'fear', 'are', 'genuine', 'pure', 'simple.Genuine', 'horror', 'something', 'youngsters', 'have', 'find', 'difficult', 'grasp', 'are', 'incapable', 'understand', 'true', 'nature', 'fear', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'force', 'fed', 'onslaught', 'chills', 'excitement', 'satisfy', 'brainwash', 'pallets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rip', 'off', 'spending', 'money', 'see', 'Fear', 'price', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'have', 'boat', 'loads', 'bad', 'movies', 'name', 'horror', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'expect', 'then', 'will', 'complain', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'yada', 'blah', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.With', 'said', 'movie', 'did', 'scare', 'way', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'been', 'scared', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'stayed', 'when', 'i', 'am', 'alone', 'dark', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'able', 'shake', 'off', 'Maybe', 'atmospherics', 'feel', 'cinematography', 'utterly', 'outstanding', 'here', 'very', 'important', 'element', 'director', 'Jaume', 'Balagueno', 'what', 'doing', 'movie', 'point', 'come', 'quite', 'well', 'understanding', 'how', 'fear', 'accomplished', 'right', 'way', 'hollywood', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'else', 'have', 'say', 'quiet', 'star', 'movie', 'Anna', 'Paguin', 'was', 'brilliant', 'discover', 'underlining', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'really', 'underrated', 'actress', 'performance', 'was', 'sensational', 'showcase', 'honest', 'expressions', 'inner', 'fear', 'will', 'have', 'believing', 'very', 'ethentic', 'looks', 'made', 'horror', 'movies', 'victim', 'unfortunately', 'latest', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'remake', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'original', 'one', 'did', 'can', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'Darkness.I', 'have', 'seen', 'rated', 'unrated', 'version', 'are', 'noticeable', 'additional', 'footage', 'added', 'creepiness', 'Being', 'owner', 'unrated', 'version', 'i', 'do', 'feel', 'compelled', 'own', 'original', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'due', 'possible', 'future', 'designation', 'movie', 'be', 'label', 'horror', 'genre', 'classic', 'few', 'years', 'Seeing', 'original', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'had', 'trembling', 'shoes', 'so', 'have', 'say', 'make', 'different', 'watch', 'theater', 'home', 'watch', 'home', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'home', 'theater', '5', 'way', 'speaker', 'system', 'nice', 'setting', 'turn', 'out', 'lights', 'be', 'prepared', 'journey', 'world', 'fear', 'begin.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'Darkness', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'horror', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'what', 'fear', 'not', 'might', 'creep', 'daylights', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'stir', 'mind', 'wonder', 'what', 'next', 'not', 'forced', 'upon', 'just', 'see', 'jump', 'Keep', 'mind', 'not', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'making', 'become', 'classic', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'now', ""'Spotlight"", 'Review', 'above', 'more', 'less', 'understand', 'what', 'i', 'am', 'talking', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'top', 'notch', 'horror', 'supernatural', 'finest', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'i', 'also', 'wrote', 'review', 'awhile', 'back', 'one', 'will', 'put', 'state', 'fear', 'long', 'while', 'witness', 'will', 'change', 'fact', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'viewing', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'handle', 'terror', 'do']",Darkness

Thank goodness I saw this on HBO and didn't have to buy theater tickets, or even rent it. I would have been much more disappointed than I am.The movie plot is very horror basic. Without offering too many spoilers, a troubled family moves to a small town and into an odd house everyone else shuns. Suddenly, the youngest member of the family, a small boy, is troubled by unseen forces, and his older sister must find a way to not only save him but her family.Anna Paquin plays the older sister, and while normally a talented young actress, she isn't given a chance to do much in the film other than run around without a proper bra.

Their grandfather lives there and helps them and they settle in a remote house just outside of town, one that needs a little work.From the moment the movie begins, there are unsettling things happening in the house. Paul begins drawing some disturbing pictures that seem to relate to the film's prologue where a young boy is on the run from something or someone terrible found in the house.Regina's parents Maria and Mark (Lena Olin and Iain Glen) seem to be very loving parents. But dad has an attack while driving one day and that's when we, the viewers, find out that he has had them before. And they terrify Regina. Afterwards, dad begins to have more frequent bouts of attacks and starts to act irrationally, scaring Regina and Paul even more although mom refuses to admit there is anything wrong.Anyway, the films unravels slowly, offering us glimpses into what is causing all of these problems but never totally telling us until near the end. And the answer is one most will figure out early on. Not to mention the fact that is not the least scary. Any film maker can offer a few jump scenes in a film. But to truly terrify an audience, you have to come straight at them. This movie plays around way too much.The story behind the house and those who inhabit it offer the briefest glimpse of where this movie might have gone, offering just a speck of something interesting. But plot and the secret revealed are so overly convoluted that by the time you finish, you just don't care. And then ending is completely disappointing.If you love horror films, rent one of the newer releases out there or go see something...anything...new in theaters.

Pay ridiculous prices for a small glass of alcohol, or find some other form of entertainment. The hotel we were at had it's own DVD player in the room, so we decided to rent a movie. The hotel had it's own renting service, so the three of us looked through a big binder of DVDs, to see what took our fancy. Could we decide on a single film? Normally, my dad & I like similar films, but my mum doesn't. And most of them, I'd either seen & owned, or wasn't interested. But then a cover that looked mighty familiar jumped out at me. I knew I hadn't seen it, and I couldn't read the blurb as it was in Dutch - I think - so I couldn't jog my memory that I'd already read one review that tore this film to pieces.We chose Darkness. As soon as I put it on, I realised my mistake. I knew exactly what this film was, but was determined to sit through it. I dozed off during the first quarter of the film, then my mum fell asleep after I woke up, and went to bed, but Dad & I stayed up to watch it.And watch it.There's nothing good that can be said about Darkness. A good cast of actors (Anna Paquin, Lena Olin & Iain Glen) were just lost in a heavy script, which made no sense, plus it had elements of a Japanese horror movie, and elements of The Shining. It picked up about three quarters of the way through, but lost the thread again, and Dad & me ended up severely frustrated by the whole thing. It made no sense, and the trailer, which promised at so much, was a major let down.I have absolutely no idea why this film is getting five star reviews on Amazon. You're all crazy.

It's pretty much all been done by now, in film after film after film, and that's only too obviously apparent when watching this picture. Okay, I'll admit that when watching spooky films alone in the dark, I'm kind of jumpy---so this film is good for a few scares. But man, that's about all that can be said for it---visually and plot-wise, every component of this film can be found in other better films.There's no point in going on in great detail---well, apart from the pleasure to be found in making fun of it! So I won't bother to say much---apart from wow, here you can see THE WORST MOTHER EVER. After moving into this new house it quickly becomes apparent that her little boy is obviously horribly traumatized---and he's waking up every morning with terrible cuts and bruising around his face. What does the mother say? ""Oh, he's just scratching himself in his sleep."" Sheesh... she also ignores her daughter's warnings at EVERY TURN and apparently has no problem in leaving a psychopath alone with the children.I picked out the evil villain of the piece the very instant he appeared onscreen---no surprise there. So, let's just say this film is a total piece of **** that made no sense from beginning to end; it's like a pile of random scripts were thrown into a blender and the resulting mish-mash was poured onto the screen. Oh, and I hated the ending.(Now, I have to admit I took note of some very nice stained glass windows on display in this picture, so I guess that could be a positive. I also noticed that the haunted house had the EXACT same wallpaper as one of the rooms in this house (William Morris' ""Arbutus"" pattern). However, I'm not exactly thrilled to have the same wallpaper as a demon-possessed house.)Now, there are plenty of funny posts about this film on IMDB that make me laugh---for instance, user ""reciprocity_failure"" wrote:""The movie was about the house...then it was about the darkness...then it was about the kids...then it was about the eclipse...then it was about the satanic ritual or whatever which was fortunately published in detail in some book at the library which wasn't too hard to find...then it was about the doctor...then it was about the house again...then it's about ghosts that can duplicate people or something...  make up your ******* mind you demons.""",1,Garbage,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2432,"['Okay', 'THEORY', 'really', 'films', 'creepy', 'old', 'houses', 'have', 'wonder', 'anything', 'new', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'genre', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'done', 'now', 'film', 'film', 'film', 'only', 'too', 'obviously', 'apparent', 'when', 'watching', 'picture', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'watching', 'spooky', 'films', 'alone', 'dark', ""'m"", 'kind', 'jumpy', '-so', 'film', 'good', 'few', 'scares', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'said', '-visually', 'plot-wise', 'component', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'better', 'point', 'going', 'great', 'detail', '-well', 'apart', 'pleasure', 'be', 'found', 'making', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'say', 'much', '-apart', 'wow', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'WORST', 'MOTHER', 'EVER', 'moving', 'new', 'house', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'little', 'boy', 'obviously', 'horribly', 'traumatized', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'terrible', 'cuts', 'bruising', 'face', 'What', 'mother', 'say', 'Oh', 'just', 'scratching', 'sleep', 'Sheesh', 'also', 'daughter', 'warnings', 'EVERY', 'TURN', 'apparently', 'problem', 'leaving', 'psychopath', 'alone', 'children.I', 'picked', 'out', 'evil', 'villain', 'piece', 'very', 'instant', 'appeared', 'onscreen', '-no', 'surprise', 'there', 'So', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'total', 'piece', '****', 'made', 'sense', 'beginning', 'end', 'pile', 'random', 'scripts', 'were', 'thrown', 'blender', 'resulting', 'mish-mash', 'was', 'poured', 'screen', 'Oh', 'hated', 'ending', 'Now', 'have', 'admit', 'took', 'note', 'very', 'nice', 'stained', 'glass', 'windows', 'display', 'picture', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'positive', 'also', 'noticed', 'haunted', 'house', 'had', 'EXACT', 'same', 'wallpaper', 'one', 'rooms', 'house', 'William', 'Morris', 'Arbutus', 'pattern', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'thrilled', 'have', 'same', 'wallpaper', 'demon-possessed', 'house', 'Now', 'are', 'plenty', 'funny', 'posts', 'film', 'IMDB', 'make', '-for', 'instance', 'user', 'reciprocity_failure', 'wrote', 'movie', 'was', 'house', 'then', 'was', 'darkness', 'then', 'was', 'kids', 'then', 'was', 'eclipse', 'then', 'was', 'satanic', 'ritual', 'was', 'fortunately', 'published', 'detail', 'book', 'library', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'find', 'then', 'was', 'doctor', 'then', 'was', 'house', 'again', 'then', 'ghosts', 'can', 'duplicate', 'people', 'something', 'make', 'up', '*******', 'mind', 'demons']",Darkness

Far from it. This movie was weak in plot, acting and explanations. I still really do not get what the entire film was about. I don't know maybe I missed something but I only got bit and pieces of the whole plot. The plot at first was somewhat strong, then it just crumbled to pieces when it just stopped making sense.

You never do, for the ending cuts off so fast without answering your questions at all and you feel so empty and bitter afterwards. I would not recommend this movie, it was a waste of time. I cannot even truly explain what the movie is about. Just a family that moves into a house and the father all of a sudden turns into Jack Nicholson from the Shining basically every once and awhile and the small boy is constantly being bruised and the daughter and mother feel it's the father doing it when it's really not. It's a lot like the Shining when you really think about it, but definitely not as good. It was more of a drama than anything, a bad drama though. And they try though to shy away from the Shining plot a tad and put in a different occult twist, but you really never understand the new occult twist, so you're just left with a remade but badly done mixture of other haunting movies, the biggest highlight again the Shining. Trust me, watch the Shining instead, it's older but a heck of a lot better and with a more clear plot. The worst part is in the end though, nothing is finished in the film basically. Very incomplete.I don't really get what's happening with horror films. They're getting pretty bad when it comes to these kind.

It is Oscar-winner Anna Paquin, as the moody but perceptive teenaged daughter of the clan, who gets to have her name above the title here - a dubious distinction at best, I'm sorry to say.""Darkness"" has just about all the standard accoutrements one would expect to find in a film on this subject.  In addition to the perpetual thunderstorm taking place outside and the electricity that keeps going out on cue, we also have the self-activating toys, the strange voices on the telephone, the ghostly images on photographs, the father who becomes exponentially more psychotic in every scene in which he appears, and the mysterious old man with the limp who shows up out of nowhere and seems to hold the key to everything.  Seasoned veterans will be able to predict just about every hackneyed setup and clich&eacute; a full hour before it officially arrives on screen.  For instance, we just know, without room for quibble, that the minute the mother brings home a box of colored pencils for her delighted little boy to play with, the tyke will start drawing strange and disturbing pictures to help push the plot points along.  It's practically de rigueur when it comes to films in this vein.  (However, I must say, in all fairness, that the movie does NOT include the cat-jumping-out-at-the-audience scene, which is pretty much standard issue for every horror flick these days.  The filmmakers DO earn some bonus points for that).Paquin makes for a feisty heroine, and it isn't really her fault that her character always seems to be ten giant steps behind the audience in figuring it all out.  And as to the ""What the *&$%?"" ending - well, it's either so brilliant that it is beyond the ken of mere mortal man to figure out, or it's one of the biggest final curtain stumbles in horror movie history.  I have my own personal notion as to which of those two it really is, but I`ll let you figure that one out for yourself.

It's about 'devil worshippers'in lower fifth - dimensional Spain of the late 1990's and beyound , who decide decades earlier to have a house built to harness what the ONA calls 'acausal energies'.These devil - worshippers believed in what they felt to be the useability of human sacrifice to aid themselves in their deeply dark , seriously sinister 'shamanic'journeying - journeying to the lower forth dimension and beyound.They allow one member to make a decision to let his child escape , but sacrifice all the other children they felt they had to sacrifice to finish off their ritual - in a manner I found to be one of the most terrifying descriptions in movie history. This film is dark. And I am not pissed off by these one star reviewers of this film , but rather perplexed , wondering what films they may know about which go beyound the Darkness. I chose to use this movie in my own spiritual journeying minus all the brutal violence of course with seriously good results.I loved the film and saw it again and again and again , in Spanish and in English , and it deals with the concept of child sacrifice by supposedly existing 'satanist groups'you never hear about anywhere , especially not in the writings of the top anti - satanism authors , and in the writings of such authors as David Icke.The Darkness is not only a scary horror film - it is a sinister horror movie which kind of captivates an atmosphere whose nature as sinister is akin to the atmosphere people felt while watching the Exorcist in the eighties and earlier.

Honestly if this version was supposed to be more intense then the theatrical version had to be a real snoozer.The Director/writer Jaume Balaguero obviously had the Horror 101 playbook in use as there is almost nothing in this movie that hasn't been borrowed from other horror films.  You'll see plot devices borrowed from Amityville Horror, Darkness Falls, The Others, The Ring, Six Sense, and who knows how many other films.  We have the father who is slowly being driven mad by the house...we have the little boy who is drawing disturbing pictures in crayon...we have things that zoom past doorways just out of view...The story, what there is of it concerns a family that moves from the states to a creepy old house in the Spanish Countryside.  Maybe I blinked, but I never did hear the reason for the radical move other than they had to be in THAT house for a reason and the director is Spanish.  Soon after creepy things happen and only the daughter Regina (Anna Paquin) seems to notice what's happening.  her little brother Paul keeps showing up with bruises on him yet the idiot mother Maria (Lena Olin) passes it off as ""these things happen"".  yeah right...they happen if you live with a child abuser...Dad Mark (Iain Glen) starts going all George Lutz on the family, suffering seizures and generally being abusive to the family members, while little brother Paul is the one being tormented in his bedroom by a toy carrousel that goes on by itself (another Horror cliche) and a pencil that always rolls under his bed....OOhhhhh Scary!  Dan busts a hole in the wall and finds an old victrola and listens to old records and puts up a creepy photograph of 3 old ladies wearing sunglasses.  Every one in a while we get a quick glimpse of something creeping around like the girl from the Ring but it's never explained.There's some mumbo jumbo about how the house was really built to match a temple (of what I have no idea) and a spell which requires seven children to be killed to bring ""Darkness"" about.  Again, it's never really explained because the director obviously thought we'd be too creeped out to ask questions.  Ultimately it's just silly as is the usual cliched horror film ending which could not come soon enough.  If this film had come out five years ago it might not have been bad, but seeing how almost everything in it is liberally borrowed from other films it just comes off very weak.  I'll give it two stars on the strentgh of Paquin's performance who at least seemed to be giving it an effort.Oh, and finally it's one of the cheapest DVDs of a new release in a long time.  All you get for special features is a couple of trailers and a FOUR minute featurette on the making of the film.  It's obvious that the guys who made this film knew what a clunker it was and were not going to spend any more money by adding special features.",2,UN-RATED FOR WHAT EXACTLY????,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,3316,"['When', 'one', 'blurb', 'un-ratred', 'edition', 'one', 'naturally', 'will', 'be', 'content', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'gory', 'nature', 'was', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'version', ""'m"", 'loss', 'what', 'exactly', 'un-rated', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Maybe', 'was', 'tracheotomy', 'scene', 'was', 'longer', 'more', 'graphic', 'Whoopee', 'wanted', 'see', 'surgery', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Learning', 'Channel', 'something', 'Honestly', 'version', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'intense', 'then', 'theatrical', 'version', 'had', 'be', 'real', 'snoozer.The', 'Director/writer', 'Jaume', 'Balaguero', 'obviously', 'had', 'Horror', '101', 'playbook', 'use', 'almost', 'nothing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'been', 'borrowed', 'other', 'horror', 'films', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plot', 'devices', 'borrowed', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Others', 'Ring', 'Six', 'Sense', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'father', 'who', 'slowly', 'being', 'driven', 'mad', 'house', 'have', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'drawing', 'disturbing', 'pictures', 'crayon', 'have', 'things', 'zoom', 'past', 'doorways', 'just', 'view', 'story', 'what', 'family', 'states', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'Spanish', 'Countryside', 'Maybe', 'blinked', 'never', 'did', 'hear', 'reason', 'radical', 'move', 'other', 'had', 'be', 'house', 'reason', 'director', 'Spanish', 'Soon', 'creepy', 'things', 'happen', 'only', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'notice', 'what', 'happening', 'little', 'brother', 'Paul', 'showing', 'up', 'bruises', 'yet', 'idiot', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'off', 'things', 'happen', 'yeah', 'right', 'happen', 'live', 'child', 'abuser', 'Dad', 'Mark', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'going', 'George', 'Lutz', 'family', 'suffering', 'seizures', 'generally', 'being', 'abusive', 'family', 'members', 'little', 'brother', 'Paul', 'one', 'being', 'tormented', 'bedroom', 'toy', 'carrousel', 'Horror', 'cliche', 'pencil', 'always', 'bed', '.OOhhhhh', 'Scary', 'Dan', 'hole', 'wall', 'old', 'victrola', 'old', 'records', 'up', 'creepy', 'photograph', '3', 'old', 'ladies', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'one', 'while', 'get', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'something', 'creeping', 'girl', 'Ring', 'never', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'how', 'house', 'was', 'really', 'built', 'match', 'temple', 'what', 'have', 'idea', 'spell', 'seven', 'children', 'be', 'killed', 'bring', 'Darkness', 'about', 'Again', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'director', 'obviously', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'creeped', 'out', 'ask', 'questions', 'just', 'silly', 'as', 'usual', 'cliched', 'horror', 'film', 'ending', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'soon', 'enough', 'film', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'five', 'years', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'seeing', 'how', 'almost', 'everything', 'liberally', 'borrowed', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'off', 'very', 'weak', ""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'strentgh', 'Paquin', 'performance', 'who', 'least', 'seemed', 'be', 'giving', 'effort.Oh', 'finally', 'one', 'cheapest', 'DVDs', 'new', 'release', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'special', 'features', 'couple', 'trailers', 'FOUR', 'minute', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'obvious', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'clunker', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'adding', 'special', 'features']",Darkness

This the only thing horrific about this movie is the story and the characters.The movie tries to wind slow tension by making Paquin walk from room to room at the slowest possible speed. It tries to draw cheap jumps with the not-so-subtle use of sudden booming music. Both tricks failed miserably.The mother comes off as inept, the father comes off as a pathetic idiot who has no idea what's going on. The son looks like the posterboy for Ritalin, and surprise, the only one who has a firm grasp on the situation is the adolescent, over-dramatic, daughter.Like a compulsive gambler, I forced myself to watch the whole movie to see if the ending would be somehow worth it.The explanation for what is happening is beyond feeble. It looked like the writers got stuck for a solution and threw this garbage at the audience hoping it would fly.Hell, I would have settled for the house being built on an old burial ground instead of the sludge they fed me.If you're between the ages of twelve and sixteen, maybe you'll like it.
