I love a good date movie and am prepared to accept a certain formulaic quality from the genre. But I'm afraid this offering fails to meet the required standard.It's the usual plot: star figure skater needs new partner after his established partner is injured. He plucks an unknown out of nowhere -- they train together, fall in love, have a romantic crisis and end up winning the gold.To make this enjoyable, the lead characters need to  have chemistry and the movie needs to make at least some minimal effort to avoid cliches.Unfortunately, almost every line in this script is a cliche -- my wife saw several coming before they were uttered -- and the leads, while attractive don't exactly melt the screen with their passion.Pretty harmless fare -- just not very good.",2,Not very good,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,866,"['enjoyed', 'original', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'quite', 'bit', 'so', 'had', 'moderately', 'high', 'hopes', 'one', 'love', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'am', 'prepared', 'accept', 'certain', 'formulaic', 'quality', 'genre', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'offering', 'meet', 'required', 'standard.It', 'usual', 'plot', 'star', 'figure', 'skater', 'new', 'partner', 'established', 'partner', 'injured', 'unknown', 'out', 'nowhere', 'train', 'together', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'romantic', 'crisis', 'end', 'up', 'winning', 'gold.To', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'lead', 'characters', 'need', 'have', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'make', 'least', 'minimal', 'effort', 'avoid', 'cliches.Unfortunately', 'almost', 'line', 'script', 'cliche', 'wife', 'saw', 'several', 'coming', 'were', 'uttered', 'leads', 'attractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'melt', 'screen', 'passion.Pretty', 'harmless', 'fare', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good']",The Cutting Edge - Chasing the Dream

1143148,AX2A8Q454K8L2,B0013K2ZFY,Laura,"[23, 25]","The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream is the third and final installment in the Cutting Edge series that started with everyone's favorite 90s film about an ice skater and ex-hockey player who banter their way to the Olympics. The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream added an extra twist to the story by making the female lead a hockey player and the male lead is the one in need of a partner. The concept was cute, but there wasn't a lot of follow through.The original movie The Cutting Edge was rated PG, but at a time when PG meant that you could include more adult themes. The character depth in the film was believable as you saw these characters evolve. In this film, because of the changed standards on movie ratings were limited on what could be discussed. Now, the film is meant for the family which means quite a bit is simplified for a younger audience and overall less believable.Overall, fans of the original film will be glad to see references made to the original. The Pamchenko Twist makes another appearance along with an almost identical ending. However, like all sequels, the original will always be the best. The references to the original made the movie cute and worth watching once, but not good enough to stand on its own.If you're a die hard fan looking for a cute movie, give this one a chance. However, if you're actually going to look at this movie with a realistic or slightly critical eye, you're not going to care for it one iota. If you're not sure - just stick to the original.

But somehow, the two young stars upstage their own mediocre production to make this work, sort of.Couldn't believe they actually made two sequels to the cult favorite. One day I might spend the time to watch the second version, but for this third installment, I was aghast at the complete lack of originality. I get that the basic ""fish out of water"" has to be the foundation of these stories - I get it. But c'mon, there has just got to be some semblance of crafting your own vision, cutting your own path. This was the movie equivalent of putting down tracing paper and copying another person's artwork. Sad.Again, what saves this from a complete and utter disaster are the two young stars, Matt Lanter and Francia Raisa. In particular - the latter. Her infectious energy really carries this otherwise staid uninspired retread.Without her - this is low two. With her - it's a high two. With her in an original screenplay - who knows?And it would be wrong to not mention the only other valid actor I felt was in the film - Luis Oliva, who played the brother to Francia's character. Guy was very real and I completely bought his role. Hope someone in a position to notice - notices.Finally, I was so depressed to see them resurrect the original 'illegal move'. Is there nothing else in skating that might be credibly drafted as something amazing? Really, that's it: Swinging your partner and tossing her up - that's the penultimate? Nothing else can be done?Appreciate that it's dangerous, and I love the move. But I loved it *20 years ago* when the first team came up with it.

I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.Now, the acting was good. I believed the main actors. But the coach, Jackie Dorsey, wasn't that good. I didn't feel she had the heart or the will power to be a believable coach. It was the skaters talent that saved the day, and not the words or teaching of the coach. The skating wasn't all good, but wasn't as good as the 2nd movie.I felt that this movie was a role reverse form the original movie. The girl is now a hockey player turned figure skater. The boy is the desperate pair skater that needs a partner. The even learns how to do the Pamchenko! The Pamchenko was basically a CGI performance of Alex flying in the air and Zack catching her.
