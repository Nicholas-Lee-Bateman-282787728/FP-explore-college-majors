1433806,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B004YM6JQO,Alan Ramirez,"[3, 6]","90210 is one of the best CW shows. Since the very beginning of this season everything is exciting. You can see a huge improvement from last season: more dark plots (like Annie's introduction on prostitution, or Ivy dealing with Raj's death). I feel the show became more real this season, and the fans who have been watching the show since the very beginning will know what I'm talking about. Everyone had great plots this season, unlike other shows that completely forget about some characters, but not in 90210.All the cast is amazing, Shenae, Gillian, Jessica, Annalynne and Jessica Stroup are the best female cast on TV nowadays, it's like in real life you could believe that they are real friends without the acting. I also loved that this season has more outdoor scenes, new crazy characters that are ready to mess with our West Bev kids (Holly, Vanessa) and the transition from teenagers to young adult.If you like 90210, don't doubt on buying this season. I already pre-order it and i'll keep watching the show until the very end. Can't wait for season 5!",5,Keeps getting better,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1062,"['90210', 'one', 'best', 'CW', 'shows', 'very', 'beginning', 'season', 'everything', 'exciting', 'can', 'see', 'huge', 'improvement', 'last', 'season', 'more', 'dark', 'plots', 'Annie', 'introduction', 'prostitution', 'Ivy', 'dealing', 'Raj', 'death', 'feel', 'show', 'became', 'more', 'real', 'season', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'very', 'beginning', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Everyone', 'had', 'great', 'plots', 'season', 'other', 'shows', 'completely', 'forget', 'characters', 'not', '90210.All', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Shenae', 'Gillian', 'Jessica', 'Annalynne', 'Jessica', 'Stroup', 'are', 'best', 'female', 'cast', 'TV', 'nowadays', 'real', 'life', 'could', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'friends', 'acting', 'also', 'loved', 'season', 'more', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'new', 'crazy', 'characters', 'are', 'ready', 'mess', 'West', 'Bev', 'kids', 'Holly', 'Vanessa', 'transition', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adult.If', '90210', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'buying', 'season', 'already', 'pre-order', 'i', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'very', 'end', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '5']",90210: Season 4
1433807,A1DD15RXIXWENM,B004YM6JQO,"Anton Beat Riess ""Toni Riess""","[1, 3]","Hm, compared with the original ""Beverly Hills 90210"", this version/Spin-Off is terrible, poor in Stories, trivial, shallow and doesn't allows to give those character to chance to grow up. Those ""kids"" acts amazing stupid. I mean not the actors, any of them are good, specially AnnaLynne McCord as true Beverly Hill Girlie. But really, where the parents of those kids? Doesn't have those kids parents? My parents had been all the time around in my younger years.The only character I gave a chance was Teddy (Trevor Donovan) who had somehow an interesting part but he was written out. The stories/themes are short handled. The drug-Theme of Dixon ist just in two or 3 episodes. Liam accident at the end of one episode. In the next episode he can leave the hospital already, without any friends has visited him - or parents? How stupid is that?The writers don't give us the chance to get a connection to and feel with the characters like we got in the original ""Beverly Hills 90210"". So it makes me difficult to remember the characters name. Even the names of the supporting characters I can't hold. I still remember the names of the old show. But here... no chance.Why they (the filmmakers) give us not a chance to see a deep-in-Story/relationship with Teddy and Shane (Ryan Rottman)?I just like Chris McKenna (as Patrick Westhill), Austin Deeley (as Austin) (even is story-lines are waste of time, trivial and shallow), Trevor Donovan (as Teddy) and AnnaLynne McCord and Matt Cohen (he needs definitve more time).What about special guest? In the original show they had here and there some interesting names7guests. But here? Special guest for poor people are here. Just Ray Wise (""Savannah"", ""Twin Peaks"") had an appearance - for two (=2) minutes. How poor is that?And why they use for adult people (like the FBI woman) where looks like just 25 years old? Where is Silvers Mom Jackie? Or Kelly? David.  And why the hell everybody looks almost like a fashion model? - Oh I forgot - its a TV Show and has nothing to do with real world.Its amazing that ""90210"" is already 5 years on air. Other shows where are more thrilling are cancled after the first season (""Ringer"", ""The Secret Circle""). But its now wonder that it was cancled in Germany after 15 epMore hotties: Niall Matter, Sean Wing, Nick Ballard, Nick Zano, Dylan Neal.THE DVD: has good picture and sound quality (english in 5.1 and stereo sound) and subtitles: English SDH, spanish, portuguese.Bonus-Features: any few short documentaries about the fashion, Make up, Set Tour, and audio-commentary with Cast on seletect Episodes.FAZIT: do you want see a thrilling TV-Serie?

But after all this lack of writing and the same old same old I got really tired of this show. The writers keep on writing the same thing over and over again like they keep on having a Naomi vs. a girl she doesn't like and her always throwing party's and moving on to a different guy and her always being annoying, this lady has to grow up she isn't in high school anymore, the writers seriously have to make Naomi's character grow up. Annie is always in the little stupid situations in which she puts herself in. Liam try's to unsuccessfully be the bad boy that he was in season 1 but still be kind when he wants to. Adrianna of course they are always gonna be doing that whole ""she's addicted to drugs again"" thing. I had no problem with Teddy or Navid or Dixon but because of the same stuff they keep on using I've completely stopped watching this show! They seriously need new writers!

1433812,A2GG3RUAMHF0KX,B004YM6JQO,Mohit G.,"[3, 8]","I fell in love with 90210 during Season One but Season Two was a huge step down and Season Three was definitely a big improvement from the second season. Rebecca Sinclair's departure has not done the show any good.Once again, the show revolved around Naomi and her ridiculous romances from Max to Austin to PJ. Max and Naomi as a couple were watchable but watching her and PJ was just repulsive. She just met the guy and fell in love and is getting married Come on, so unbelievable. Her rivalry with Holly was funny and at the same time, extremely kiddish. I thought this season they'll make the characters a little more mature but no, the same old drama continues. Jen returns and fights Naomi for PJ and suddenly gives up and leaves. Once again, out of character.Moving on, Sliver and Navid's relationship was tested when Navid's annoying sister moves in with them. Once again, stupid decision and they just forget about her after a few episodes. Continuity has never been 90210's forte but this just got ridiculous. To top it all, Navid's ""evil"" uncle wreaks havoc in his life and he has to break up with Silver who quickly moves on to a TEACHER at CU, Greg but they break up too and then she sleeps with Liam. Silver has officially slept with every guy on the show, Ethan, Dixon, Teddy, Navid and Liam. Her character is ruined. She was a very likable character but now she has become a promiscuous woman/girl. I thought they were going in a good direction with the breast cancer angle and they dropped the ball on it. The whole, Silver/Liam/Navid triangle wasn't very exciting. Seen it all before.Speaking of Liam, how dumb can a character get? I mean, what the hell! Vanessa was an interesting character but her manipulation was too obvious, even a five year old would have seen it coming. Liam is not a gullible character and in addition to Silver, the writers destroyed Liam's character as well.Annie, just don't wanna say anything. She might as well be gone. An escort really? Shenae Grimes herself trashed her storyline this season. Her mother lives in Paris, they had a huge house in Beverly Hills, she's not exactly broke. She falls for one of her ""clients"". Another pathetic angle. I spoke too soon, her falling for a priest made me want to just turn off the TV. I mean, can't poor Annie ever find a sane and normal guy.Dixon and Adrianna hooked up. The only convincing couple on the show. Dixon's drug addiction arc was just a recycled version of Ade's addiction storyline. Ade's scene with her daughter was cute but in order to redeem herself, Ade became boring. She used to bring the drama but now it just seems like she is a useless character like Ivy. Really hope she does something interesting next season, if Dixon's car crash kills him, it'll be an interesting storyline to see how Ade copes, a hook-up with Austin, maybe?Ivy finally bid adieu to 90210 and thank God for that, she was only interesting when she was with Raj, other than that she put me to sleep every time she was on.Hopefully, her departure means Teddy's re-entry on the show. His exit seemed a little bit forced mid-season. It'll be nice to see him with a new guy and have a gay relationship on the show did the show good last season. The finale definitely left the door open for Teddy's return.Overall, recycled and unnatural story arcs made this season a huge disappointment. The show should focus less on fancy guest stars and more on character development. The show needs stable and mature relationships rather than everyone sleeping with each other. Ivy and presumably Dixon's departure can pave the way for introducing a new character. An Ethan return could be good.",2,Disappointing (Includes Spoilers),1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3660,"['fell', 'love', '90210', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'down', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'definitely', 'big', 'improvement', 'second', 'season', 'Rebecca', 'Sinclair', 'departure', 'not', 'done', 'show', 'good.Once', 'again', 'show', 'revolved', 'Naomi', 'ridiculous', 'romances', 'Max', 'Austin', 'PJ', 'Max', 'Naomi', 'couple', 'were', 'watchable', 'watching', 'PJ', 'was', 'just', 'repulsive', 'just', 'met', 'guy', 'fell', 'love', 'getting', 'married', 'Come', 'unbelievable', 'rivalry', 'Holly', 'was', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'extremely', 'kiddish', 'thought', 'season', ""'ll"", 'make', 'characters', 'little', 'more', 'mature', 'same', 'old', 'drama', 'Jen', 'returns', 'fights', 'Naomi', 'PJ', 'suddenly', 'up', 'leaves', 'Once', 'again', 'character.Moving', 'Sliver', 'Navid', 'relationship', 'was', 'tested', 'when', 'Navid', 'annoying', 'sister', 'moves', 'Once', 'again', 'stupid', 'decision', 'just', 'forget', 'few', 'episodes', 'Continuity', 'never', 'been', '90210', 'forte', 'just', 'got', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'Navid', 'evil', 'uncle', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'life', 'break', 'up', 'Silver', 'who', 'quickly', 'TEACHER', 'CU', 'Greg', 'break', 'up', 'too', 'then', 'Liam', 'Silver', 'officially', 'slept', 'guy', 'show', 'Ethan', 'Dixon', 'Teddy', 'Navid', 'Liam', 'character', 'ruined', 'was', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'now', 'become', 'promiscuous', 'woman/girl', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'good', 'direction', 'breast', 'cancer', 'angle', 'dropped', 'ball', 'whole', 'Silver/Liam/Navid', 'triangle', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'exciting', 'Seen', 'before.Speaking', 'Liam', 'how', 'dumb', 'can', 'character', 'get', 'mean', 'what', 'hell', 'Vanessa', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'manipulation', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', 'even', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'Liam', 'not', 'gullible', 'character', 'addition', 'Silver', 'writers', 'destroyed', 'Liam', 'character', 'well.Annie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'anything', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'gone', 'escort', 'really', 'Shenae', 'Grimes', 'trashed', 'storyline', 'season', 'mother', 'Paris', 'had', 'huge', 'house', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'not', 'exactly', 'broke', 'one', 'clients', 'pathetic', 'angle', 'spoke', 'too', 'soon', 'falling', 'priest', 'made', 'want', 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'poor', 'Annie', 'ever', 'find', 'sane', 'normal', 'guy.Dixon', 'Adrianna', 'hooked', 'up', 'only', 'convincing', 'couple', 'show', 'Dixon', 'drug', 'addiction', 'arc', 'was', 'just', 'recycled', 'version', 'Ade', 'addiction', 'storyline', 'Ade', 'scene', 'daughter', 'was', 'cute', 'order', 'redeem', 'Ade', 'became', 'boring', 'used', 'bring', 'drama', 'now', 'just', 'useless', 'character', 'Ivy', 'Really', 'hope', 'something', 'interesting', 'next', 'season', 'Dixon', 'car', 'crash', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'see', 'how', 'Ade', 'hook-up', 'Austin', 'maybe', 'Ivy', 'finally', 'bid', 'adieu', '90210', 'thank', 'God', 'was', 'only', 'interesting', 'when', 'was', 'Raj', 'other', 'put', 'sleep', 'time', 'was', 'on.Hopefully', 'departure', 'Teddy', 're-entry', 'show', 'exit', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'forced', 'mid-season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'new', 'guy', 'have', 'gay', 'relationship', 'show', 'did', 'show', 'good', 'last', 'season', 'finale', 'definitely', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'Teddy', 'return.Overall', 'recycled', 'unnatural', 'story', 'arcs', 'made', 'season', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'show', 'should', 'focus', 'less', 'fancy', 'guest', 'stars', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'show', 'stable', 'mature', 'relationships', 'rather', 'everyone', 'sleeping', 'other', 'Ivy', 'presumably', 'Dixon', 'departure', 'can', 'pave', 'way', 'introducing', 'new', 'character', 'Ethan', 'return', 'could', 'be', 'good']",90210: Season 4
