954264,A2A3PV7XG6ZGM5,B000C1VB0U,Michael Harmon,"[5, 7]","I rented the first disc of Gravion after I finished Godannar Vol. 5. I have to wait 2 months for volume 6 so I figured I'd give Gravion a shot. I knew I could get the whole series for only 30 bucks so if i liked the first disc, I could just buy it cheap. Well, after watching the first disc my wife and I went out and bought the box set and finished all 13 episodes that night. Now all things considered: price A+, animation B-, music A-, japanese acting B english C, writing/story B, characters B, and so on, this is a solid collection. I noticed on most of the episodes that the time went pretty fast. I mean I couldnt believe it was almost over when i looked at the time. It was that engaging. Some animes I'm hoping for the end of the episode already but this one rarely did that. I will say however that in a couple of episodes it did end too quickly. Kind of like, okay we finally found out how to defeat the alien and now we are out of time so one slash, end, and music. Overall the animation was good but near the end you could tell they were either running out of money or time because some scenes were drawn subpar as well as the definition and color. As for the writing, It was pretty good. I know ""aliens invade earth, send in the robo-protector"" isnt new but it was what the writers did to keep that age old concept fresh. For example How do you form your big robot when missing a pilot? And if you can, what are the consequences? The music was great in this as well. You have to have a great ""merging"" song in these shows and you get one as well as a good opening and closing song. I liked these characters too. The pilots were funny and interesting. The fan service was minimal. Now as a big fan of Godannar I have seen fan service. Gravions fan service was nothing compared to Godannars. I also thought the characters had enough backround and the ones who didnt needed to stay mysterious and I think that helped their character strength. Well this is getting long, in conclusion, this series was very good. It gave me what I was looking for, something to tide me over till the next installment of Godannar comes out. If you are a fan of Godannar, Gravion is not on par with Godannar in almost every category but its still very good for what it is and as its own show. I hope Gravion Zwei ends the series well because Gravion was a great beginning.",4,Closer To 3.5 But It Was A Fun Anime So 4 It Is,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2363,"['rented', 'first', 'disc', 'Gravion', 'finished', 'Godannar', 'Vol', '5', 'have', 'wait', '2', 'months', 'volume', '6', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'Gravion', 'shot', 'knew', 'could', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'only', '30', 'bucks', 'so', 'i', 'liked', 'first', 'disc', 'could', 'just', 'buy', 'cheap', 'Well', 'watching', 'first', 'disc', 'wife', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'box', 'set', 'finished', '13', 'episodes', 'night', 'Now', 'things', 'considered', 'price', 'A+', 'animation', 'B-', 'music', 'A-', 'japanese', 'acting', 'B', 'english', 'C', 'writing/story', 'B', 'characters', 'B', 'so', 'solid', 'collection', 'noticed', 'most', 'episodes', 'time', 'went', 'pretty', 'fast', 'mean', 'couldnt', 'believe', 'was', 'almost', 'when', 'i', 'looked', 'time', 'was', 'engaging', 'animes', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'end', 'episode', 'already', 'one', 'rarely', 'did', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'couple', 'episodes', 'did', 'end', 'too', 'quickly', 'Kind', 'like', 'finally', 'found', 'out', 'how', 'defeat', 'alien', 'now', 'are', 'time', 'one', 'slash', 'end', 'music', 'animation', 'was', 'good', 'end', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'either', 'running', 'money', 'time', 'scenes', 'were', 'drawn', 'subpar', 'as', 'well', 'definition', 'color', 'writing', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'know', 'aliens', 'invade', 'earth', 'send', 'robo-protector', 'isnt', 'new', 'was', 'what', 'writers', 'did', 'keep', 'age', 'old', 'concept', 'fresh', 'example', 'How', 'do', 'form', 'big', 'robot', 'when', 'missing', 'pilot', 'can', 'what', 'are', 'consequences', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'have', 'great', 'merging', 'song', 'shows', 'get', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'opening', 'closing', 'song', 'liked', 'characters', 'too', 'pilots', 'were', 'funny', 'interesting', 'fan', 'service', 'was', 'minimal', 'Now', 'big', 'fan', 'Godannar', 'have', 'seen', 'fan', 'service', 'Gravions', 'fan', 'service', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Godannars', 'also', 'thought', 'characters', 'had', 'enough', 'backround', 'ones', 'who', 'didnt', 'needed', 'stay', 'mysterious', 'think', 'helped', 'character', 'strength', 'Well', 'getting', 'long', 'conclusion', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'gave', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'tide', 'next', 'installment', 'Godannar', 'out', 'are', 'fan', 'Godannar', 'Gravion', 'not', 'par', 'Godannar', 'almost', 'category', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'own', 'show', 'hope', 'Gravion', 'Zwei', 'series', 'well', 'Gravion', 'was', 'great', 'beginning']",Gravion: Season 1
954265,ACTHUAU2A70DF,B000C1VB0U,"M. Sharpless ""NERV""","[11, 11]","There you have it, this show is pretty much Power Rangers with fan service.  By no means does that make it a bad show, and this box set comes with both ""Gravion & Gravion Zwei"" two seasons in one.  Not bad for the money if your into machines that can't do nothing alone, but combined they form a super big robot that can do anything.Season One starts out with Eiji being tricked into piloting one of the worthless machines, while trying to look for his sister.  The show picks up from there, and by the end of season one a lot of questions have been asked but no answers were given.Season Two starts out by trying to be funny, which ruins some of what the first season built up.  Season two gets better at the end, when it returns to the seriousness of the show, but the first four to five episodes tries to hard to please the fan service crowed, with nudity being put into the show more.  The show never shows too much nudity, but this show is not recommended for a younger audience. It's pointless fan service, and the characters start (Mostly Eiji) to curse more than need be for this type of show (In the English Dub anyway, have not watched the Japanese subtitles yet).  The start of season two just brings the whole series down, but luckily the that last 9 episodes picks the show back up.As far as dubs go, the English dub is good.  Chris Patton-which also did voice work for Chrono Crusade, Dragon Ball Z, Area 88, and much more, does the voice for Eiji.  He does a good job, and you can tell he put a lot of work into the emotions of the character.  The rest of the cast, does an good excellent job as well.  However, for you purist out there the Japanese audio track is there for you with all subs you can read.Overall the quality of this box set is sub par, the DVDs are not on an individual disk holder, but rather the six DVDs are all put on one spool, which makes accessing the individual disk a nightmare, plus the top DVDs never stay on the spool which leads to scratches.The show itself is worthwhile, but the second season makes the show forgettable, you will enjoy the show while you watch it, but will forget the show almost as soon as you finished watching it. I would borrowing from a friend, or if your into Mechs, and power ranger type teams, than go for it. You won't regret watching this show.  I enjoyed watching this show.  The price for two seasons is not bad, over all a 4 star rating. Losing one star because of the first few episodes of season two, and the DVD case itself.",4,"Soldier of the Grand Knights, combine and form ""Super Heavy God Gravion""",1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2505,"['have', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'fan', 'service', 'means', 'make', 'bad', 'show', 'box', 'set', 'Gravion', 'Gravion', 'Zwei', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'Not', 'bad', 'money', 'machines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'nothing', 'alone', 'combined', 'form', 'super', 'big', 'robot', 'can', 'do', 'anything.Season', 'One', 'out', 'Eiji', 'being', 'tricked', 'piloting', 'one', 'worthless', 'machines', 'trying', 'look', 'sister', 'show', 'up', 'there', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'lot', 'questions', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'answers', 'were', 'given.Season', 'Two', 'starts', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'what', 'first', 'season', 'built', 'up', 'Season', 'two', 'better', 'end', 'when', 'seriousness', 'show', 'first', 'four', 'five', 'episodes', 'tries', 'hard', 'please', 'fan', 'service', 'crowed', 'nudity', 'being', 'put', 'show', 'more', 'show', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'nudity', 'show', 'not', 'recommended', 'younger', 'audience', 'pointless', 'fan', 'service', 'characters', 'start', 'Mostly', 'Eiji', 'curse', 'more', 'need', 'be', 'type', 'show', 'English', 'Dub', 'anyway', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'yet', 'start', 'season', 'two', 'just', 'whole', 'series', 'down', 'luckily', 'last', '9', 'episodes', 'show', 'back', 'up.As', 'far', 'dubs', 'go', 'English', 'dub', 'good', 'Chris', 'Patton-which', 'also', 'did', 'voice', 'work', 'Chrono', 'Crusade', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Area', '88', 'much', 'more', 'voice', 'Eiji', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'tell', 'put', 'lot', 'work', 'emotions', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'purist', 'there', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'there', 'subs', 'can', 'read.Overall', 'quality', 'box', 'set', 'sub', 'par', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'individual', 'disk', 'holder', 'rather', 'six', 'DVDs', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'spool', 'accessing', 'individual', 'disk', 'nightmare', 'top', 'DVDs', 'never', 'stay', 'spool', 'scratches.The', 'show', 'worthwhile', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'forgettable', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'watch', 'will', 'forget', 'show', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'would', 'borrowing', 'friend', 'Mechs', 'power', 'ranger', 'type', 'teams', 'go', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'show', 'price', 'two', 'seasons', 'not', 'bad', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'Losing', 'one', 'star', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'DVD', 'case']",Gravion: Season 1
954266,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B000C1VB0U,Porcupine,"[9, 19]","This show is often compared to Godannar, another robot fighting anime that came out at approximately the same time. So for 30 bucks, I figured I'd give this a shot. What a waste of my money. In the end, all I can say is that I've got yet another example of why anime fans' opinions should be taken with a grain of salt.This show is often referred to as one of those big-booby-girly animes. But this show is not girly in the slightest. This show, like Godannar, centers around robot fighting and tries to be reasonably serious. That's neither a good or a bad thing, just a description of what to expect. Don't be misled by the box covers or anime fan reviews.However, unlike Godannar, this show has awful drawings, awful animation, no plot, and is totally boring. It is a poorly directed and poorly executed show. I've lost all respect for director Masami Obari (Fatal Fury movies, which I thought were great) after seeing this series. Viewers should be allowed to form their own opinions about whether or not they like the drawing style in this series, so I won't say whether I think it is good or bad. However, what is inarguable is that the drawings are of poor quality. That is to say, they are inconsistently done, and every episode is severely ""degenerated"" (a well-known anime phenomena, where certain episodes may look worse than others due to different, unskilled people doing the key animation). The animation is ultra cheap and frame-saving throughout the series. Seeing this series makes me lose some respect for Gonzo, the animation studio responsible for this show. Some Gonzo shows look amazing with top-quality animation, but Gravion is not one of them unfortunately.Even the way the video was mastered seems riddled with problems. It feels as if Gonzo did not know how to produce a digital anime when seeing this show, however that cannot be as Gonzo has produced other excellent digital animes, some before Gravion (such as Vandread). So I don't know what went wrong here. In some sequences, such as the Gravion fusing transformation sequence, the video is all choppy because it has been incorrectly mastered with 5:4 (24 fps to 30 fps progressive) pulldown, which is WRONG and should never be done. Unacceptable.A terrible series. Complete garbage. I have nothing against this type of show (I rate Godannar, a similar show, as the best show I've ever seen in my life) but Gravion is super low-budget and low-quality and deserves to be thrown in the trash.",1,Terrible......ugh...,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2473,"['show', 'often', 'compared', 'Godannar', 'robot', 'fighting', 'anime', 'came', 'out', 'approximately', 'same', 'time', 'So', '30', 'bucks', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'What', 'waste', 'money', 'end', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'got', 'yet', 'example', 'why', 'anime', 'fans', 'opinions', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt.This', 'show', 'often', 'referred', 'one', 'big-booby-girly', 'animes', 'show', 'not', 'girly', 'slightest', 'show', 'Godannar', 'centers', 'robot', 'fighting', 'tries', 'be', 'reasonably', 'serious', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'description', 'what', 'expect', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'box', 'anime', 'fan', 'reviews.However', 'Godannar', 'show', 'awful', 'drawings', 'awful', 'animation', 'plot', 'totally', 'boring', 'poorly', 'directed', 'poorly', 'executed', 'show', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'respect', 'director', 'Masami', 'Obari', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'movies', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'seeing', 'series', 'Viewers', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'not', 'like', 'drawing', 'style', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'think', 'good', 'bad', 'However', 'what', 'inarguable', 'drawings', 'are', 'poor', 'quality', 'say', 'are', 'inconsistently', 'done', 'episode', 'severely', 'degenerated', 'well-known', 'anime', 'phenomena', 'where', 'certain', 'episodes', 'may', 'look', 'worse', 'others', 'due', 'different', 'unskilled', 'people', 'doing', 'key', 'animation', 'animation', 'ultra', 'cheap', 'frame-saving', 'series', 'Seeing', 'series', 'lose', 'respect', 'Gonzo', 'animation', 'studio', 'responsible', 'show', 'Gonzo', 'shows', 'look', 'amazing', 'top-quality', 'animation', 'Gravion', 'not', 'one', 'unfortunately.Even', 'way', 'video', 'was', 'mastered', 'riddled', 'problems', 'Gonzo', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'produce', 'digital', 'anime', 'when', 'seeing', 'show', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Gonzo', 'produced', 'other', 'excellent', 'digital', 'animes', 'Gravion', 'such', 'Vandread', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'sequences', 'such', 'Gravion', 'fusing', 'transformation', 'sequence', 'video', 'choppy', 'been', 'incorrectly', 'mastered', '5:4', '24', 'fps', '30', 'fps', 'progressive', 'pulldown', 'WRONG', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'Unacceptable.A', 'terrible', 'series', 'Complete', 'garbage', 'have', 'nothing', 'type', 'show', 'rate', 'Godannar', 'similar', 'show', 'best', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'Gravion', 'super', 'low-budget', 'low-quality', 'be', 'thrown', 'trash']",Gravion: Season 1

Like some of the other mecha animes you have a mysterious wealthy lord who seeks to protect the world from an unknown invader by recruiting a group of young fighters to pilot advanced machine mechas that when called for form a powerful robot(Sound Familiar).  The characters aren't the worst out there in anime series but there so forgettable you're left wondering ""Why The Hell Should I Care"" kind of feeling for the series.  The animation is o.k. but it's not the greatest also the soundtrack while it fits the action scenes it's also pretty much a clone soundtrack of the Power Rangers.  The voice cast are probably the only real good thing about the series as both the subbed and dubbed cast did very well playing their character roles which I give them kudos for.
