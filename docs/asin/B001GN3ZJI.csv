1198234,A2ZYFPHEDPBYDW,B001GN3ZJI,Jobla,"[15, 16]","I thought that the 3-D worked quite well, given the limits of DVD.  The disc provides three different versions of the film: color 3-D, black-and-white 3-D, and a really good color print in 2-D.  There are also interviews with cast and crew members, and a nice documentary about 3-D that even provides a 3-D trailer preview of THE MAZE!The film itself is a typical softcore flick from the late 1960s.  Some of the actresses include Christina Hart (who is interviewed in the accompanying featurette), cult fave Monica Gayle, and Nancy ""CINDY AND DONNA"" Ison.  THE STEWARDESSES was perhaps the first American film of its kind that played mainstream theaters.  Because of that, I consider it to be the first film in the ""porno chic"" movement, although many film historians award that distinction to DEEP THROAT (1972).",4,A good restoration of this vintage film,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,814,"['thought', '3-D', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'given', 'limits', 'DVD', 'disc', 'three', 'different', 'versions', 'film', 'color', '3-D', 'black-and-white', '3-D', 'really', 'good', 'color', 'print', '2-D', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'nice', 'documentary', '3-D', 'even', '3-D', 'trailer', 'preview', 'THE', 'MAZE', 'film', 'typical', 'softcore', 'flick', 'late', '1960s', 'actresses', 'include', 'Christina', 'Hart', 'who', 'interviewed', 'accompanying', 'featurette', 'cult', 'fave', 'Monica', 'Gayle', 'Nancy', 'CINDY', 'DONNA', 'Ison', 'THE', 'STEWARDESSES', 'was', 'perhaps', 'first', 'American', 'film', 'kind', 'played', 'mainstream', 'theaters', 'consider', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'porno', 'chic', 'movement', 'many', 'film', 'historians', 'award', 'distinction', 'DEEP', 'THROAT', '1972']",The Stewardesses 40th Anniversary

Zarco,"[1, 1]","The Stewardesses 3-D(1969) is a sexy comedy/drama starring Christina Hart and directed by Alf Silliman Jr. It's packed with sexy women, nudity and 3-D effects. Then again, it has almost no plot or story. The budget for the film was $100,000 and it grossed more than $25 million at the box office. There are several alternate versions of the film. The film is a part of pop culture. It was spoofed on SCTV. The Stewardesses was one of the first movies filmed in Stereophonic 3-D. Many Hollywood 3-D movies were filmed in Anaglyph 3-D. This Shout Factory DVD does deliver in quality. The film claims that it was based on a novel, but that is not true! The film has many filler scenes. People play pool or have fun at a carnival. A stewardess gets high on LSD and tries to make love to a lamp! This film is for adults only.

I was lucky enough to see The Stewardesses. What I remember most was that the audience was screaming with laughter at this movie. This movie is the perfect talk back to the screen movie. This is a cheesy soft porn skin flick in 3d, and I loved every minute. I just got the dvd yesterday and watched it again for the first time in years, and it has not changed a bit. I remember the scene the audience went wild over. It was right at the beginning when this girl and guy are making love in a motel room, and the girls feet and legs are going back and forth at the screen. Restoration is good. 3D is fair. It works well in somes parts, but not in others. Take this movie for exactly what it is, a look back at the very early stages of what would become the golden age of porn.
