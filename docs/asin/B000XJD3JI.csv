The organization and balance of emotional scenes in the story struture works very well. The performances do credit to the director and his talented ensemble.  I&#8217;ve looked for Harden&#8217;s films since seeing her terrific performance in &#8220;Pollock,&#8221; and her performance in this film is flawless.  Her character, struggling with schizophrenia, is central to the story, but the focus is on her son and his relationship with his father - played wonderfully well by Devon Gearhart and Joe Pantoliano.  The beauty of the story is that they learn to help each other, after trying to cope individually. The realistic treatment makes this a film for a niche market.  The first part of the film was not pleasant, but it posed the problem that was more or less dealt with as the story developed - but not with a Hollywood ending. This is not &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; or &#34;Rachel Getting Married.&#34; The handling of the story provides catharsis, without meeting the criteria of classical tragedy.

1114483,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B000XJD3JI,,"[1, 1]","The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) supports this excellent movie about a family heavily affected by mental illness.  From the writer and director Joseph Greco, comes the autobiographical account of a mother, Mary Marino (Marcia Gay Harden), diagnosed approximately two years prior with Schizophrenia, her husband John (Joe Pantoliano) and eleven year old son, Christopher (Devon Gearhart).  They are a working class family living in Florida.  Mary is a homemaker and paints for a hobby or possibly even therapy while John works long hours and hard days to afford a day to day living along with Mary's always  mounting medical bills.  While Schizophrenia is biological in its origin, its symptoms manifest in psychological behaviors causing severe and devastating psychological torture for the patient and horrible problems within the family structure, especially when Mary loses her insight and becomes terrified without any ability to control it.As the movie begins, it is during the quieter times in their lives.  Mary is with a much younger Chris at the beach, playing on the shore and gazing off at the lighthouse in the distance.  This is a woman who dearly loves her son and at the outset, the film clearly shows the closeness between the two.  We skip ahead quickly, after her diagnosis, and Chris is returning home from a trip where he stayed with his Aunt Joanne.  Mary is overjoyed to see him, wants to paint his portrait, but then begins to greatly suffer from paranoia.  She is extremely worried about his whereabouts at all times, when and if he will return home after school, following him onto his school bus, and is suffocating Chris.  The pressure on him is building more and more when kids start to tease him at school about his ""crazy"" mother.  It gets so bad for him that he ends up in a physical fight before yelling at Mary those dreaded words, ""I hate you"", and that he wishes he would have never come home from his Aunt's house.Mary crosses the line into a psychotic break with her already paranoid reality; hearing voices, becoming combative, forgetting important things, staring off into the distance and going outside ranting in the rain while terrified.  It is clear that this has happened before as we see Chris watch the flashing lights of the ambulance and police cars in their yard through his bedroom window; his demeanor is just rather numb and helpless.  They have come once again to take his mother to the hospital as John is pleading with them to not put her in handcuffs.  All three of them are lost and paralyzed by Mary's mental illness.  Helpless to do anything but patiently wait for John's wife and Chris' mother to come back to them; like she used to be, like she was.It is at this point in the film that the focus shifts away from Mary and then to John and Chris as now John is in charge of taking care of their son while this is all happening.  The timing is terrible when John takes a monumental financial hit from his boss/friend.  He takes time off of work anyway and begins an all-consuming project, one born in the love he has for his Mary, one that reminds him of what they used to be together before the illness took hold, and one that he will totally lose himself in.  It is also a soul searching time for Chris to remember the love he has for his mother, recalling her showing him how to sew and listening to seashells they collected together down by the lighthouse.  This is the time for these two to let it all out. All of their pain that has been bottled up without talking about the important things, the reasons why they love her as much as they do.  A time to do the really  hard work emotionally while they together get consumed in the project of love for Mary.The beaches of Florida, the lovely paintings, and a lighthouse in the distance are all beautifully shown (Rob Sweeney) and make this wonderful story come to life.  Some very sweet and expressive melodies (Joel Goodman) run through this family tale and put you right in the middle of the situations.  The acting in the film is nothing short of stellar, this has to be  Joe Pantoliano's most expressive work by far.  Marcia Gay Harden gives such a heartrending and emotional performance, which always hits you viscerally. The young Devon Gearhart as their tender son, yearns for his mother in such an expressive and loving way. Such a lovely movie, a thinking movie, but more so an emotional movie.  A very sad, although surprisingly joyful and in touch testimonial of what it is like to lose what a person's character once was because of an illness taking it over.  Mental illness can be so very devastating, ruining people, families, and lives. The wonderful thing about this family is that through all of the pain and loss, the love never leaves, never wavers, but continues to burn as brightly as the lighthouse in the distance.",5,"""I Hate You ...

When we learned that her mom suffered from schizophrenia we told her that whenever her mom was off her medicine, and she didn't make a meal, this little girl should come to our house and we'd feed her.  Over the years, she also slept at our house many times.  Her last day of high school she ate breakfast with our kids and said she was really going to miss those times as part of our family.

1114488,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000XJD3JI,Grady Harp,"[23, 24]","CANVAS is an autobiographical story by writer/director Joseph Greco and knowing that fact helps to forgive some of the weaknesses of the film.  The story - how a family copes with the presence of paranoid schizophrenia and survives - comes from the heart and is as frank a film about the subject of mental illness as any out there. And for all the inherent tendencies to play it as a soap opera, the overriding effect is one of sharing lives challenged by the presence of a crushing disease.Mary Marino (Marcia Gay Harden) has been afflicted with paranoid schizophrenia for nearly two years and her disease has affected her marriage to her working husband John (Joe Pantoliano in his best role to date) and her eleven year old son Chris (Devon Gearhart): John misses work to care for Mary and still pay for her mounting hospitalization and medical bills and Chris suffers abuse form his mocking school friends, frequently having to explain away his mother's erratic behavior. Mary paints (therapy) the same scene repeatedly, hears voices, and finally refuses to stay on her meds, a fact that results in her long-term hospitalization in a Psychiatric Hospital.  John and Chris continue to love Mary despite the radical changes in their lives and each finds a means of coping: John goes on sick leave to build a sailboat for his wife and son in his backyard (he and Mary met and fell in love on a sailboat), and Chris takes up one of Mary's hobbies - sewing patches on shirts - and finds an audience and acceptance and income at his school.  How the father and son survive and conquer their challenge presented by the mental illness of Mary serves to provide the ending to this story.Each of the actors is excellent, especially Pantoliano. Harden is a solid actress but the script fails to capture the essence of her response to her disease.  The film feels disjointed and inconsistent and has holes of undeveloped subplots and lines of thought that keep the movie grounded.  But knowing that the story is true encourages the viewer to forgive the flaws and appreciate the tough subject matter that should help every viewer to better understand the effect of mental illness on a family.

This is a story based on the directors experiences as aboy growing up in a home with a schizophrenic mother.  He also wrote thescreenplay over a ten year period, and it is his first full length film.(I watched the directors commentary after viewing the film 5 times overa 6 week period.  The cast is excellent all around, especially the father,Joe Pantoliano, who is trying to cope with his wife's illness, the highmedical bills, and his son's anxiety about his mother and the socialpressures he has to endure from peers, particularly his father's boss'son, who he eventually beats up, costing his father his job.  The pointof the film is how the father and son cope and eventually come to termswith the mother's illness.The son, 11, played by Devon Gearhart, gives an incredibly nuanced per-formance for a child actor.  The film is largely seen through his eyes,and he is so real and normal, it seems at times like a documentary.  Thecinematography is beautiful, mostly filmed in Hollywood, Florida.  Themusic is wonderful (wish there was a CD), and despite the heavy subjectmatter, there is much humor and good happy moments to balance it out.This movie deserves a much larger audience.  It won many audience awardsat film festivals in 2006.  I own about 300 DVD's, and as ""little"" filmsgo, this has become my all-time favorite. Do yourself a favor and rentit, or better yet, buy it.

1114490,A2KP1SXTMHK8ZO,B000XJD3JI,"TheBanshee ""M.J.""","[27, 28]","I almost didn't see this film. I just tuned it in on Cablevision Movies on Demand. Oscar winner (for ""Pollock"") Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as Mary, the wife and mother who had suffered a psychotic break about 18 months before this story begins, and whose denial that she needs continuing medical help has begun tolead her once again into bizarre behavior and paranoid delusions, to the extent that she's finally removed from her home by the local police, who have been there many times before. But Harden's portrayal is so nuanced that we can see the loving wife and mother and the scared person inside. As Mary's frustrated, but fiercly protective and loving husband John, Joey Pantoliano is first-rate. I know I've seen him in a lot of other things, but this was the film that made me realize exactly how good he is.But Mary's illness is only part of the story. When she's hospitalized (and in the scene where John and son Chris first go to the psychiatric ward to see a heavily sedated Mary, Harden is heartbreaking), a new relationship has to be forged between Chris, who has been taunted at school about his ""crazy"" parents, and John, who is seriously worried about being able to pay Mary's mounting medical bills.To me, this film is less about schizophrenia as it is about family and love, and the human connections that redeem us no matter what's happening on the outside. There is a lot of love in this film.If you haven't seen Canvas, you should.EDIT: There should be a soundtrack for this film, but I haven't been able to find it. Joel Goodman's score is worth hearing, and there are a couple of gorgeous songs sung by Lisbeth Scott.",5,"Wonderful performances, absorbing story.",1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1662,"['almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'just', 'tuned', 'Cablevision', 'Movies', 'Demand', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Pollock', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Mary', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'suffered', 'psychotic', 'break', '18', 'months', 'story', 'denial', 'continuing', 'medical', 'help', 'begun', 'tolead', 'once', 'again', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'extent', 'finally', 'removed', 'home', 'local', 'police', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'many', 'times', 'Harden', 'portrayal', 'so', 'nuanced', 'can', 'see', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'scared', 'person', 'inside', 'Mary', 'frustrated', 'fiercly', 'protective', 'loving', 'husband', 'John', 'Joey', 'Pantoliano', 'first-rate', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'realize', 'exactly', 'how', 'good', 'Mary', 'illness', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'When', 'hospitalized', 'scene', 'where', 'John', 'son', 'Chris', 'first', 'go', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'see', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'Mary', 'Harden', 'heartbreaking', 'new', 'relationship', 'be', 'forged', 'Chris', 'who', 'been', 'taunted', 'school', 'crazy', 'parents', 'John', 'who', 'seriously', 'worried', 'being', 'able', 'pay', 'Mary', 'mounting', 'medical', 'bills.To', 'film', 'less', 'about', 'schizophrenia', 'family', 'love', 'human', 'connections', 'redeem', 'matter', 'what', 'happening', 'outside', 'lot', 'love', 'film.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Canvas', 'should.EDIT', 'should', 'be', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'Joel', 'Goodman', 'score', 'worth', 'hearing', 'are', 'couple', 'gorgeous', 'songs', 'sung', 'Lisbeth', 'Scott']",N/A
