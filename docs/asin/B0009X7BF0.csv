Some people just didn't know when to quit!These post-Mabel King episodes of the now adult Rerun and Roger will stink up your DVD players like stale cabbage and have your friends (and kids who aren't familiar with the originals) look at you like an idiot for watching this stuff.These contain some of the stupidest episodes in the show's history. The late 70s were a bad time in Tv comedy in general, and this is a perfect example. One episode actually has Dwayne wanting to quit school to become a peanut hawker at a stadium! (For once, even Rerun looks smarter!). Raj is about to fool with a married woman (hey! this was a family show)! Nine year old Little Earl joins a gang to impress the teenaged Dee, and the series comes to an end when Dee lectures an audience who comes to see celebrities (who don't appear) at a benefit rather than to support the cause!

916137,AJK5WHV1GW941,B0009X7BF0,Mikeisha Best,"[3, 3]","The third season of ""What's Happening!"" was an overall entertaining and interesting season.  I own all three seasons, and, while many reviewers have expressed that this season was not as good as seasons one and two, I feel that it was.  Yes, Mabel King is no longer on the show, and Big Earl and Little Earl join the cast, but they were very funny and meshed well with the other cast members.  Of course, I missed the presence of Mabel King, but the show was still amusing and contained creative subject matter regardless.Raj and Rerun move into their apartment.  Raj is a student and Rerun holds down a steady job.  Dwayne is still in school (and gets more attractive every season!)  Dee has matured a great deal physically, and by this season, she becomes even more drab, but less sarcastic.  She's not quite as effective as she was in the previous seasons.  Because Mabel King is no longer on the show during this season, the writers make Shirley a more valued member of the cast.  She takes on more of a motherly role; she moves into the Thomas house and acts as a guardian to teenaged Dee.  Some of my favorite episodes include when Dwayne stands in for Big Earl as a coach, and the children end up favoring him over Big Earl, and he has to decide if he wants to take his job, when Shirley gets fired from the soda shop and when Raj tutors Snake.I highly recommend ""What's Happening!"", season three because I feel that it can easily entertain any audience.

Rerun, Dwayne and Raj are still the same funny, likeable guys they always were and Dee shows a lot of maturity but the formula with Raj and Rerun as roommates just doesn't feel the same.  The interaction with ""Mama' Thomas was just as much a part of the show as the interaction with the guys, especially with Dee's ""Imma tell mama!"" threats and Raj giving her money to shut her up.  The addition of Big and Little Earl Barnett did absolutely nothing for the show.  Except for maybe the purpose of ""whitening"" things up a little, I really don't know why they were there.All isn't that bad though.  Season Three still had a few decent episodes such as the one where Rerun went credit card crazy and got everything in the apartment repossessed.  Anyone who enjoyed watching Rerun dance should get a kick out of the episode where he entered the dance contest after promising everyone who contributed to the entry fee double on their investment.  Nothing else, however, was very memorable or compelling.  Some say that the series was cancelled too early but given the direction it was going, it was probably about time.  All of the starring cast, except for Mabel King, would come back a few years later in the ""What's Happening Now"" series.""What's Happening"" however, remains one of my favorite sitcoms of all time and the characters are all unforgettable.

The fact that the three seasons have now been released and there were no extras included in any of the box sets is really disappointing.Still, it is fun to watch Raj, Dwayne, and Rerun together and the season does have some highlights such as ""Making Out"" where Raj and Rerun both embellish how well they do on their dates and ""The Last Page"" where Rerun imagines he's ""The Fonz"" and ""Mork.""Overall, if you're a fan of the show, you'll want to get all three seasons (I did) but if you're like me, you'll spend more time on seasons one and two.",3,The Spark is Gone,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,1272,"['Season', 'Three', 'What', 'Happening', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'magic', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'did.With', 'Mama', 'no', 'longer', 'cast', 'member', 'though', 'mentioned', 'was', 'still', 'around', 'majority', 'action', 'happened', 'Raj', 'Rerun', 'new', 'apartment', 'Two', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'added', 'form', 'upstairs', 'neighbors', 'Big', 'Earl', 'son', 'Little', 'Earl', 'Shirley', 'now', 'renting', 'Raj', 'old', 'room', 'Dee', 'show', 'effort', 'include', 'character', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'soda', 'shop', 'Raj', 'apartment.As', 'watch', 'season', 'three', 'start', 'realizing', 'fat', 'jokes', 'aimed', 'Shirley', 'Rerun', 'begin', 'get', 'redundant', 'Dee', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'more', 'annoying', 'cute', 'bad', 'acting', 'really', 'grate', 'fact', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'were', 'extras', 'included', 'box', 'sets', 'really', 'disappointing.Still', 'fun', 'watch', 'Raj', 'Dwayne', 'Rerun', 'together', 'season', 'have', 'highlights', 'such', 'Making', 'Out', 'where', 'Raj', 'Rerun', 'embellish', 'how', 'well', 'do', 'dates', 'Last', 'Page', 'where', 'Rerun', 'Fonz', 'Mork', 'Overall', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'three', 'seasons', 'did', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'seasons', 'one', 'two']",What's Happening!!: Season 3

I really enjoyed the storylines surrounding Rerun and Raj being roommates, especially the episode when they compete to see who can score with the ladies and stretched the truth!!!However, I must admit that the evolution of Dee's character was somewhat a disappointment. First of all it seemed like the producers were not sure if they wanted to grow her up by having her go back and forth wearing her hair in those stupid ponytails. Then it seemed like she just read her lines without the zest she had in the first 2 seasons. I am happy to say that storylines surrounding Shirley's character were even funnier when the producers made her presence stronger in the Thomas family home.All in all it was a great season but was cancelled way too soon!

916143,A2STDDBMI6CIPA,B0009X7BF0,"W. gallegos ""wg6175""","[7, 9]","I am a big fan of this show and own the first 2 seasons on dvd. Sadly,those are the only seasons on dvd that I will ever own. I have seen every episode on syndication and must say that the episodes from the final season were not all that. It could be one of many reasons why the show got canned following the 3rd season. Perhaps they got rid of their original writers and decided to go with the less expensive,amateur writers who just weren't as good? Perhaps it was the departure of Mabel King (Miss Thomas) that led to the downfall? Maybe it was the addition of Big and Little Earl to the cast that killed it? Or maybe,just maybe it was the young cast who were slowly converting from hilarious teenagers to somewhat maturing young adults? Let's see...Rerun went from a flunking highschooler to a responsible roommate working at ABC as a studio tour guide. Dwayne went from this young airhead kid with a big afro with his famous ""hey,hey,hey"" line to a more mature young adult just trying to act like an airhead. Roger was now renting an apartment with....can you believe,Rerun? And Dee went from a blackmailing brat to a young woman who just wasn't getting on her brother's or Rerun's nerves anymore. If I had a top ten list of my best What's happening episodes,I am afraid not one episode from the 3rd season would make the list. I just can't think of an episode from season 3 that compares to the episode when Rerun's brother-in-law loses 500 dollars in a football bet or when Rerun marries an illegal alien to keep her in the country or when the gang meets the legendary Doobie brothers. Overall,I will still give this show 3 out of 5 stars because of the love I have towards the series.
