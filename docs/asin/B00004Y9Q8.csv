Russell ""syzygy121""","[5, 6]","Well the idea is always good -- showcasing short cinema, in this case with a common theme of young gay men coming to terms with their sexuality.  Yet, as with nearly every short film collection, some of the installments are great, some are pretty lousy.""Smear"" is as confused as is the protagonist (at least I think he was the protagonist).  ""Front Room"" is a gimmick that is more akin to something a high-school student would do in the privacy of his bedroom.""The Absolution of Anthony"" is good, especially with a cast that includes Victor Garber (of ""Titanic"" fame).  ""Stanley Beloved"" is even better, but the ending is so unresolved and the characters so underdeveloped, I found it hard to care for it beyond the limited scope.""Fairy Tale,"" while second-best here, is a bit uneven and I thought some of the characters were broadly-drawn and stereotypical, but there is some real depth to the plot and the dialogue.  Like any short story or short film, it is difficult to keep the pace up without feeling rushed.  This one handles it pretty well, with a few fits and starts that frustrated me.  Still and all, among the dramatic pieces here, it was the most emotionally satisfying given the genre.BEST BY FAR is ""Piglets.""  I haven't laughed out loud like that in quite a while.  The bizarre situations and characters made me watch this one over and over.  I like the pantomime aspect of it, it is a German production, which lends a universal feel to it all.

The first brief, The Absolution of Anthony (as if there was any absolution) featured a young Hispanic on the verge of coming out, who had a very odd ""hobby"" of calling random people out of the phone book and asking them to tell him that they wanted to *blank* him. It ended with what was a hint of an encounter with a (likely) heterosexual. The most ambitious, Fairy Tale, was miserably unbelievable. A guy goes home for his birthday bringing his partner of three and half years, and is so upset by his mother's coldness that he runs into the woods and has sex with a stranger. There's a terrible attempt at symbolism, with a red hat and a forest, and Little Red Riding Hood - it just doesn't work.I had very low expectations, but I thought that at least one would be good.

558793,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B00004Y9Q8,Patrick,"[7, 9]",I cannot believe these short films are considered &quot;good&quot; by ANYBODY! They're horrible! I think the worst one is the one with the guy licking his arm. That's all he does. That's all you see. Just a man licking his own arm for about 3min. Another terrible one is with two guys and a girl playing some kind of running game with each other. They take turns running in front of each other. I don't understand why kids are playing Playstation 2 when they can take turns running in front of each other! The ONLY thing that saves this DVD is the very funny guys who introduce the films. Even they seem to think they're stupid.
