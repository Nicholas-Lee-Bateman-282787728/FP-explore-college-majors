305342,A2DH4EV86KTRIO,6302276594,Esar Shvartz,"[6, 8]","First, I want to point out that Stanley Crouch's review of this movie is outstanding.  Anybody who is serious about understanding the real west should read his review. In my opinion, John Ford did an excellent job of showing the white vs Indian conflict, better than in 'The Searchers'. To most of us, living comfortably more than a century after the west was won, it is difficult to understand the racist attitudes toward the Indians in the 19th century.  Well, how would you feel if you managed to survive being scalped, hide in the bushes, and see your wife raped and murdered, your grandchild burned to death and later consumed by the squaws, and your teenage girls gang raped never to be hear about again. Would you call the ACLU? Invite the 'noble savages' to participate in group therapy? I am sure that there are some lunatic liberals who would do just that. But, the rest of us red blooded Americans its time to look at the real west which was cruel, unforgiven, and ugly. There is no question that John Ford was able to recreate the real west better than anybody else; the agonizing dilema of what to do with whites who lived with barbaric, stone aged, savages and sometimes turned out to be just like them. By the way, many white children who survived Indian captivity and were rescued spent the rest of their lives in lunatic assylems. I wish that Amazon reviews will generate more interest in movies like the present one and make us appreciate the courage of the European immigrants who moved west and carried out Manifest Destiny without which America could not have become the shining example of democracy in human history.",5,An underrated western,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,1638,"['First', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'review', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'Anybody', 'who', 'serious', 'understanding', 'real', 'west', 'should', 'read', 'review', 'opinion', 'John', 'Ford', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'white', 'vs', 'Indian', 'conflict', 'better', ""'The"", 'Searchers', 'most', 'living', 'comfortably', 'more', 'century', 'west', 'was', 'won', 'difficult', 'understand', 'racist', 'Indians', '19th', 'century', 'Well', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'managed', 'survive', 'being', 'scalped', 'hide', 'bushes', 'see', 'wife', 'raped', 'murdered', 'grandchild', 'burned', 'death', 'later', 'consumed', 'squaws', 'teenage', 'girls', 'gang', 'raped', 'never', 'be', 'hear', 'again', 'Would', 'call', 'ACLU', 'Invite', ""'noble"", 'savages', 'participate', 'group', 'therapy', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'lunatic', 'liberals', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'rest', 'red', 'blooded', 'Americans', 'time', 'look', 'real', 'west', 'was', 'cruel', 'unforgiven', 'ugly', 'question', 'John', 'Ford', 'was', 'able', 'recreate', 'real', 'west', 'better', 'anybody', 'else', 'agonizing', 'dilema', 'what', 'do', 'whites', 'who', 'lived', 'barbaric', 'stone', 'aged', 'savages', 'sometimes', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'way', 'many', 'white', 'children', 'who', 'survived', 'Indian', 'captivity', 'were', 'rescued', 'spent', 'rest', 'lives', 'lunatic', 'assylems', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'will', 'generate', 'more', 'interest', 'movies', 'present', 'one', 'make', 'appreciate', 'courage', 'European', 'immigrants', 'who', 'moved', 'west', 'carried', 'out', 'Manifest', 'Destiny', 'America', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'become', 'shining', 'example', 'democracy', 'human', 'history']",Two Rode Together VHS

Despite some magnificent passages, it's a very tiresome affair.  Ford reportedly did it for the money, hated the script, and just tried to finish it as quickly as possible.  His apathy towards the project comes through.  It feels like a hodgepodge of cliched Western scenes thrown together.The film does have its pleasures though.  Stewart's performance (his first film with Ford) is very good.  He plays a morally ambiguous sheriff, and Widmark is very good.  There's an excellent scene where Stewart and Widmark are sitting on a river bank just talking.  It runs on for 3 minutes or so (there's no cutting in the scene), and Widmark and Stewart improvised the whole thing.  They didn't even know they were being filmed.  It's the best scene in the film.  Shirley Jones is good here as well, but Andy Devine's ""comic relief"" is quite awful (Devine would redeem himself in Ford's next picture, the masterpiece The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.  It's Devine's finest performance).  If you're a Ford fan, you should check this one out.

305345,A3G2GATVPBWGA9,6302276594,Mike,"[3, 3]","""Two Rode Together"" is the only James Stewart Western not to reach the American public on DVD.  It is endearing.  The director (John Ford) reportedly didn't like it, which isn't that odd given Ford's souring on the Western as an idiom.  It is, however, a gem in every way.  The acting is exemplary, with the unbroken talk between Steward and Widmark by the stream being remarkable.  The characters and crisp and engaging: John McIntyre, Shirlely Jones, Linda Crystal, Andy Divine, and Ken Curtis support Stewart and Widmark.  There is comic relief.  There are thoughtful plot turns and conflicted characters.  The underlying theme, that good deeds are often fraught with unanticipated and tragic consequences, was especially apt given the films timing (the nation was enmeshed in the Vietnam War).  The film centers on two very different men: one (Stewart's character) a hardened Marshall, who is cynical and a ""kept man"".  The other is a idealistic cavalry officer (Whitmark), who is repulsed by Stewart at times but who is bound to do his duty.  They are sent to deal with Comanche Indians (Texas) holding white captives.  The Indians have factions: one group recognizes the need to make a deal, and the other are a more militant brand of Comanche who believe magic talismans can ward off bullets.  The pragmatists verses the true-believers is an interesting take.  The result is that several captives are repatriated, with plot-twist consequences.  One reason for the poor reputation of the film may be the unflattering depiction of the Indians.  We're in an era in which there is discomfort showing them as something less than woodland poets.  I note that the Anglos don't exactly shine, either.  Good and bad are on both sides of the deal, hence a sense of realism.  This is an engaging, thought-provoking film that exceeds The Searchers in my estimation.  This is set in Texas, it is excellent even if the director soured on making Westerns.",5,most under-rated gem I know of,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1947,"['Two', 'Rode', 'only', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Western', 'not', 'reach', 'American', 'public', 'DVD', 'endearing', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'reportedly', 'did', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'odd', 'given', 'Ford', 'souring', 'Western', 'idiom', 'however', 'gem', 'way', 'acting', 'exemplary', 'unbroken', 'talk', 'Steward', 'Widmark', 'stream', 'being', 'remarkable', 'characters', 'crisp', 'engaging', 'John', 'McIntyre', 'Shirlely', 'Jones', 'Linda', 'Crystal', 'Andy', 'Divine', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'support', 'Stewart', 'Widmark', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'plot', 'turns', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'underlying', 'theme', 'good', 'deeds', 'are', 'often', 'fraught', 'unanticipated', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'was', 'especially', 'apt', 'given', 'films', 'timing', 'nation', 'was', 'enmeshed', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'one', 'Stewart', 'character', 'hardened', 'Marshall', 'who', 'cynical', 'kept', 'man', 'other', 'idealistic', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'Whitmark', 'who', 'repulsed', 'Stewart', 'times', 'who', 'bound', 'do', 'duty', 'are', 'sent', 'deal', 'Comanche', 'Indians', 'Texas', 'holding', 'white', 'captives', 'Indians', 'have', 'factions', 'one', 'group', 'need', 'make', 'deal', 'other', 'are', 'more', 'militant', 'brand', 'Comanche', 'who', 'believe', 'magic', 'talismans', 'can', 'ward', 'off', 'bullets', 'pragmatists', 'true-believers', 'interesting', 'take', 'result', 'several', 'captives', 'are', 'repatriated', 'plot-twist', 'consequences', 'One', 'reason', 'poor', 'reputation', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'unflattering', 'depiction', 'Indians', ""'re"", 'era', 'discomfort', 'showing', 'something', 'less', 'woodland', 'poets', 'note', 'Anglos', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'shine', 'either', 'Good', 'bad', 'are', 'sides', 'deal', 'hence', 'sense', 'realism', 'engaging', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'Searchers', 'estimation', 'set', 'Texas', 'excellent', 'even', 'director', 'soured', 'making', 'Westerns']",Two Rode Together VHS

305347,A1MD6MXBHCRC0V,6302276594,Robert J. Evered,"[0, 0]","TWO RODE TOGETHER (1961): A band of settlers put pressure on the US Army to repatriate their children caught by the Comanche Indians seven years earlier. In turn cavalry fort commander Major Frazer (James McIntire) puts pressure on a reluctant Marshal Guthrie McCabe (James Stewart) and Lieutenant Jim Gary (Richard Widmark) to saddle up and go in search of the white captives held by the feared Comanche Chief Quanah Parker (Henry Brandon). The two negotiate the return Running Wolf (David Kent) and Elana de la Madriaga (Linda Cristal) with mixed results.Brandon also played the Comanche Chief Scar in THE SEARCHERS (1956) also carried over from that film are Ford favourites mother and son Olive Carey and Harry Carey Jn, Ken Curtis and John Qualen. Also in common with the earlier film was the scriptwriter Frank Nugent. John Ford is said to have made the film as a casual favour to Columbia's boss Harry Cohen. Of the two leads James Stewart plays a (unusually for him) cynical and ruthless character whilst Richard Widmark (who can play good guy or bad with equal aplomb) has the sympathetic sidekick role. Shirley Jones provides the main love interest. Although there are one or two nice touches of the Master at work in my opinion Ford was well-wide of the mark with this one; thankfully he is back on top form next time also with Jimmy Stewart and John Qualen but with the added bonus of John Wayne in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962).",3,"Disappointing, sub-standard, John Ford Western.

305349,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6302276594,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 2]","John Ford westerns are transcendent, a word I wouldn't use to describe much of anything unless I meant it.  He had a visual style that one moment could be as basic and authentic as the cowboy himself, and just as iconic, and downright arty and lyrical the next.  Film buffs tend to point to his earliest work, such as ""Stagecoach,"" and his epic color work, such as ""The Searchers,"" as his best films, and I admire them certainly but lean toward his often black-and-white work in the 40s and 50s as the most consistently well crafted, where he seemed more at ease with the work.A lot of contradictions exist about the man himself, who ran the gamut from chummy to fatherly to tyrannical depending on who is being interviewed and when.  And it's sometimes hard to say how much of what Ford did onscreen was deliberate versus what might have been cribbed from someone else or just plain happenstance.  But we have the end products, more than 100 of them, most of them good, and some of them masterpieces.""Two Rode Together"" falls short in a lot of ways.  The script is clumsy and rife with muddle-headed racial politics that want to condemn racism at the same time the film paternalistically reaffirms for its audience their superiority over anyone non-white - more or less what we have today in a Hollywood movie, but Ford had already examined the same themes better and with as much generosity as the times would have in ""The Searchers.""  There are moments when characters seem genuinely confused as to their purpose in the plot, a condition exacerbated by Ford's effort to draw too many light-hearted moments from leads Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark.  Both are in good form, especially the under-rated Widmark, who was born with a face for villainy but retained elements of sensitivity in his expressions that many people miss.  But even together, neither is charismatic enough to give the talky movie momentum.The plot involves a rascally town marshal helping a cavalry troop find white children presumably taken prisoner in years-ago Comanche raids.  While there's comic relief from the likes of Andy Devine, whose body type is the anatomical equivalent of a Hershey's Kiss, the soldiers here are mostly extras in spiffy blue shirts, without the Remington-esque romanticizing in Ford's earlier films like ""Fort Apache"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.""  Woody Strode, so able in Ford's ""Sergeant Rutledge,"" is criminally misused as a renegade chief, and the women (Shirley Jones and Linda Cristal), while cute, fail to provide sparks.  Perhaps the most powerful scene in the film involves a lynching, but its pathos stumbles as the scene marvels at the ""savagery"" of being the ""other"" while shoving us toward the ineffective clich&eacute; of who the real savages are.  That would come better in the brilliant tragicomedy ""Little Big Man"" less than a decade later.While Ford still had one or two good films left in him, by the time ""Two Rode Together"" was made, he seemed less interested in projects.  Even the oft-regarded one-camera take of an allegedly ad-libbed scene between Stewart and Widmark seems more gimmicky than artful.  (Compare it to similar takes in ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" for instance, to see the difference.)  ""Two Rode Together"" is worth a look if you're a Ford fan, but don't expect too much, or you'll probably watch it with a hint of sadness.",3,Three and a Half Stars is More Accurate,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,3366,"['John', 'Ford', 'westerns', 'are', 'transcendent', 'word', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'describe', 'much', 'anything', 'meant', 'had', 'visual', 'style', 'one', 'moment', 'could', 'be', 'basic', 'authentic', 'cowboy', 'just', 'iconic', 'downright', 'arty', 'lyrical', 'next', 'Film', 'buffs', 'tend', 'point', 'earliest', 'work', 'such', 'Stagecoach', 'epic', 'color', 'work', 'such', 'Searchers', 'best', 'films', 'admire', 'certainly', 'lean', 'often', 'black-and-white', 'work', '40s', '50s', 'most', 'consistently', 'well', 'crafted', 'where', 'seemed', 'more', 'ease', 'work.A', 'lot', 'contradictions', 'exist', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'gamut', 'chummy', 'fatherly', 'tyrannical', 'depending', 'who', 'being', 'interviewed', 'when', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'Ford', 'did', 'onscreen', 'was', 'deliberate', 'versus', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cribbed', 'someone', 'else', 'just', 'plain', 'happenstance', 'have', 'end', 'products', 'more', '100', 'most', 'good', 'masterpieces', 'Two', 'Rode', 'Together', 'short', 'lot', 'ways', 'script', 'clumsy', 'rife', 'muddle-headed', 'racial', 'politics', 'want', 'condemn', 'racism', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'paternalistically', 'audience', 'superiority', 'anyone', 'non-white', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'have', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Ford', 'had', 'already', 'examined', 'same', 'themes', 'better', 'as', 'much', 'generosity', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'Searchers', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'characters', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'confused', 'purpose', 'plot', 'condition', 'exacerbated', 'Ford', 'effort', 'draw', 'too', 'many', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'leads', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'are', 'good', 'form', 'especially', 'under-rated', 'Widmark', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'face', 'villainy', 'retained', 'elements', 'sensitivity', 'expressions', 'many', 'people', 'miss', 'even', 'together', 'charismatic', 'enough', 'give', 'talky', 'movie', 'momentum.The', 'plot', 'rascally', 'town', 'marshal', 'helping', 'cavalry', 'troop', 'find', 'white', 'children', 'presumably', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'years-ago', 'Comanche', 'raids', 'comic', 'relief', 'likes', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'body', 'type', 'anatomical', 'equivalent', 'Hershey', 'Kiss', 'soldiers', 'here', 'are', 'mostly', 'extras', 'spiffy', 'blue', 'shirts', 'Remington-esque', 'romanticizing', 'Ford', 'earlier', 'films', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'so', 'able', 'Ford', 'Sergeant', 'Rutledge', 'criminally', 'misused', 'renegade', 'chief', 'women', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Linda', 'Cristal', 'cute', 'fail', 'provide', 'sparks', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'film', 'lynching', 'pathos', 'stumbles', 'scene', 'marvels', 'savagery', 'being', 'other', 'shoving', 'ineffective', 'clich', 'eacute', 'who', 'real', 'savages', 'are', 'would', 'come', 'better', 'brilliant', 'tragicomedy', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'less', 'decade', 'later.While', 'Ford', 'still', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'good', 'films', 'left', 'time', 'Two', 'Rode', 'Together', 'was', 'made', 'seemed', 'less', 'interested', 'projects', 'Even', 'oft-regarded', 'one-camera', 'take', 'allegedly', 'ad-libbed', 'scene', 'Stewart', 'Widmark', 'more', 'gimmicky', 'artful', 'Compare', 'similar', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'instance', 'see', 'difference', 'Two', 'Rode', 'look', ""'re"", 'Ford', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'hint', 'sadness']",Two Rode Together VHS
