388376,AHOVW01T4ZGF9,6303917194,"""amaris-raine""","[28, 28]","This is a very effective workout video by my favorite instructor.  I have all of her videos (except Step &amp; Awesome Abs, because I don't have a step.)  There are 4 segments, each around 15 minutes in length.  They all have their own warm-up, stretch &amp; cool-down.  Her video Donna-Mite came out at the same time as this, &amp; would be a good choice to do before this one.The 1st part is arms.  This segment is all standing, although you go into a lunge position for a few moves.Part 2 is the thigh workout (the best segment, in my opinion.)  It's divided into standing squat &amp; lunge moves, then moves on to floorwork, which consists of inner &amp; outer-thigh raises.Next comes probably the most challenging part of the video, butt &amp; hamstrings.  Just like the thigh segment, it starts off with standing moves.  You'll need balance for these, so a chair would be helpful if needed.  Then, just like the thigh segment, it moves on to floorwork, but instead of laying on your side, you're on your hands &amp; knees toning your butt &amp; hamstrings.  It can get tiring, because I have long legs, so it's hard to keep it going, but of course it's okay to rest.Finally, abs &amp; waist.  It's a great segment, &amp; feels good to lie down after all that standing &amp; balancing in the previous 2 segments.  She mixes traditional moves with some new variations making for a complete mid-section workout.Donna is a master at cuing, but since this is a slower-paced toning video her skills at that aren't quite as noticeable.  4-Day Rotation is a must have to tone your body, &amp; don't forget to check-out her funky aerobics videos too!",5,Donna is the best!,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1647,"['very', 'effective', 'workout', 'video', 'favorite', 'instructor', 'have', 'videos', 'Step', 'amp', 'Awesome', 'Abs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'step', 'are', '4', 'segments', '15', 'minutes', 'length', 'have', 'own', 'warm-up', 'stretch', 'amp', 'cool-down', 'video', 'Donna-Mite', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'amp', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'do', 'one.The', '1st', 'part', 'arms', 'segment', 'standing', 'go', 'lunge', 'position', 'few', 'moves.Part', '2', 'thigh', 'workout', 'best', 'segment', 'opinion', 'divided', 'standing', 'squat', 'amp', 'lunge', 'moves', 'then', 'floorwork', 'inner', 'amp', 'outer-thigh', 'raises.Next', 'probably', 'most', 'challenging', 'part', 'video', 'butt', 'amp', 'hamstrings', 'Just', 'thigh', 'segment', 'standing', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'need', 'balance', 'chair', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'needed', 'Then', 'just', 'thigh', 'segment', 'floorwork', 'instead', 'laying', 'side', ""'re"", 'hands', 'amp', 'knees', 'toning', 'butt', 'amp', 'hamstrings', 'can', 'get', 'tiring', 'have', 'long', 'legs', 'hard', 'keep', 'going', 'course', 'okay', 'rest.Finally', 'abs', 'amp', 'waist', 'great', 'segment', 'amp', 'feels', 'good', 'lie', 'down', 'standing', 'amp', 'balancing', 'previous', '2', 'segments', 'mixes', 'traditional', 'moves', 'new', 'variations', 'making', 'complete', 'mid-section', 'workout.Donna', 'master', 'cuing', 'slower-paced', 'toning', 'video', 'skills', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'noticeable', '4-Day', 'Rotation', 'must', 'have', 'tone', 'body', 'amp', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'check-out', 'funky', 'aerobics', 'videos', 'too']",4-Day Rotation Workout VHS
388377,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6303917194,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[8, 8]","This vdieo consists of four separate 15-minute workouts--arms/shoulders, hips/thighs, buttocks, and abs--each with its own brief warm-up and cool-down.  The upper body section contains traditional exercises for each of the major muscle groups, while the hips & thighs section adds some unique twists to the usual squats and lunges.  The buttocks program is tough, and I especially liked the abs section, which again contains unique variations of traditional moves.  Donna is an enthusiastic instructor who sometimes goes a little over-the-top, but mostly, she acts as a motivating workout buddy.  She has two background exercisers, and it's nice to see that they have varied body types.  This video would be very appropriate for beginners using light weights or more experienced exercisers using heavier weights; it's perfect for virtually anyone looking to incorporate short strength workouts into their fitness schedule.",4,"A nice series of 4 short, time-saving strength workouts.",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,922,"['vdieo', 'four', 'separate', '15-minute', 'workouts', 'arms/shoulders', 'hips/thighs', 'buttocks', 'abs', 'own', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'upper', 'body', 'section', 'traditional', 'exercises', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'hips', 'thighs', 'section', 'unique', 'twists', 'usual', 'squats', 'lunges', 'buttocks', 'program', 'tough', 'especially', 'liked', 'abs', 'section', 'again', 'unique', 'variations', 'traditional', 'moves', 'Donna', 'enthusiastic', 'instructor', 'who', 'sometimes', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'mostly', 'motivating', 'workout', 'buddy', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'nice', 'see', 'have', 'varied', 'body', 'types', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'appropriate', 'beginners', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'more', 'experienced', 'exercisers', 'using', 'heavier', 'weights', 'perfect', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'looking', 'incorporate', 'short', 'strength', 'workouts', 'fitness', 'schedule']",4-Day Rotation Workout VHS

Beginners can start with no weights, intermediates can go for small weights and as you progress you can add ankle weights and heavier dumbells.

You always know when a change is coming because she tells you!  There are 4 15-minute segments: Upper Body, Hips &amp; Thighs, Buns, and Abs. She gives some of the segments cute names like, &quot;This is Abs with Attitude.&quot;  She has two friends with her who keep the ambience fun.  Each section is self-contained, with its own warm-up and cool-down.  You could do each section on a different day, or combine them in whichever ways work for you, or do them all in one day.  The exercises are effective and some are quite unique.  I think the tape would be suitable for beginners, intermediates, and advanced, by using heavier weights, adding ankle weights, and/or doing more sets of the exercises. She covers all major muscle groups. This tape is wonderful for someone who is extremely busy, like myself, but who wants to keep in shape.
