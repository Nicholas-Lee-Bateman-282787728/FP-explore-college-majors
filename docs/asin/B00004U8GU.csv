551905,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00004U8GU,Byron Kolln,"[24, 24]","The classic Broadway and television musical PETER PAN has come back to life thanks to acclaimed gymnast and Broadway star Cathy Rigby, who has made the role her own in several Broadway incarnations and national tours over the last decade.Cathy Rigby's PETER PAN maintains the spirit and integrity of the much-loved Mary Martin version but adds a few modern touches to keep in step with theatregoers. Choreographer Patti Colombo offers a breathtaking new STOMP-like spin to the ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" musical number, and takes advantage of Rigby's history as an Olympic gymnast in the ""I'm Flying"" ballet.Filmed before a live audience during a performance at the La Mirada Theatre, this new PETER PAN features an impressive supporting cast headed by Paul Schoeffler in the traditional dual-roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook. Elisa Sagardia plays a delightful Wendy and Barbara McCulloh is a touching Mrs Darling as well as a cunning Mermaid in the Marooner's Rock scene.Dana Solimando plays both maid Liza as well as Tiger Lily (which sadly means the omission of ""Liza's Ballet"" which was a highlight in the Mary Martin version). Aileen Quinn (who played the title role in the film version of ANNIE as well as the Canon MovieTales version of THE FROG PRINCE) makes a welcome appearance as Lost Boy Tootles. Drake English and Barry Cavanagh play Wendy's younger siblings John and Michael.This is a thrilling production with superb theatrical values.

551906,A396SBGKAOLTZE,B00004U8GU,Chris Aldridge,"[0, 0]","I only saw this production because I happened to find a VHS tape of it in a clearance rack in my local video store (and bought it for next-to-nothing). It is a new staging of the Broadway musical from the 1950's; this does not minimize its impact in any way, but there are many reviewers who feel the need to make excessive (and in my opinion unfounded) comparisons between this production and the original one with Mary Martin- when, in fact, it is the same show. I have copies of both performances and primarily treasure the Martin production because of its historical significance as a time capsule of early television. This version with Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby version is brilliant; its presentation differs from the 1960 one as they captured an actual performance from a theater with an audience rather than tape on a network sound stage. As someone else noted, Ms. Rigby's mannerisms and costuming better capture that of an impish boy than Ms. Martin's (although I didn't care for Ms. Rigby's attempt at a British accent). The point is they each do it a little differently, Ms. Rigby opting for more exuberance and athleticism; watch especially the &quot;I Gotta Crow&quot; scenes with her tumbling all over the stage and the &quot;Ugg-A-Wug&quot; dance and drum challenge with the Indians. The book itself is a bit corny (doesn't matter which version), but chances are you're watching it with your own children or re-living your own childhood- and that's sort of the point. The Act 1 finale which shows Peter and the Darling clan fly out the window is stunning.

551914,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,B00004U8GU,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[1, 1]","This version of Peter Pan - a filmed stage performance - is far better than the Mary Martin version of the 1960's.  Cathy Rigby uses her gymnastic abilities (she was, at one time, a member of the USA Olympic Team) to enhance the Peter Pan character, and her nautral innocence and charm make the show delightful and easy to love.Everything is better (compared to the MM production).  The performers who portray the Darling children are (here) well trained actors and singers, and the lost boys are the same.  The story is made to make more sense (the marooner's rock scene is included, for example) and the sets are far more elaborate and believable.The guy who plays Mr. Darling/Captain Hook is a top-notch performer with an excellent set of pipes.  Here and there, he is a tad aloof (as if being an entertainer is beneath him), but he's fun, and adds to the overall quality of this ... gem of a movie.But Cathy Rigby is the star.  She soars, and she takes the show with her.  She is a delight, a pure delight (even when she bullies the lost boys).The only shortfall (to me) is the handling of the indians.  They are not fun.  Peter is fun.  Wendy, Michael, and John are fun.  The lost boys are fun.  And even the pirates are fun.  But the indians here are made to be serious indians ... and are not fun.Gone too is the cute dance that introduced the indians in the MM production.  And the peace pipe scene (""I'll just send for Tiger Lily ... And I'll send for Peter Pan"") is now an over-produced example of a choreographer gone mad.But this is an excellent movie for the whole family.  And Cathy Rigby shines as the boy who won't grow up.

551915,A1PT8RZAEDXQLA,B00004U8GU,jjmmkk,"[0, 0]","Since the original Mary Martin/Cyril Richard/Jerome Robbins broadcast seems unaccountably unavailable (which is a crime) this production starring Cathy Rigby is the only choice available to those wishing to see a live musical theatrical version, as opposed to a cartoon.  I saw the original on Broadway as a ten year old - and happily own the  TV broadcast of the original version on VHS but curiosity got the better of me and I just purchased the Rigby version. I will admit I was not  predisposed to liking it and have been mostly proven correct in that - except for Ms. Rigby herself who much to my surprise is a very fine Peter Pan, if one of an entirely different species from Mary Martin.  Rigby is almost disconcertingly boyish, much more so than Mary Martin.  Her gymnastic/dance ability is of  an entirely different,  far more accomplished, order from Mary Martin's and her acting in certain moments, particularly those in which Peter is sad or bereft are quite moving.  That being said, everything else about this production is a horror.  It is  technological show biz at its worst: showy and soulless.Where to begin?  Well the worst aspects first.- As many others here have commented, Rigby is obviously lip synching her songs.  That is bad enough but even worse is that the audience response is similarly canned, manipulated and artificial.  That is a true outrage. If we aren't even allowed to hear  a genuine response from the audience how are we expected to be involved in what they are watching?- I do not find it at all charming to have older actors playing the lost boys rather than , as in the original, true boys, nor do I find any advantage in having the Indians being men as well as women. The original gender specificity of the lost boys being boys and the indians all being girls made the story much more delightful even if there was no logic to it.-  Most serious of all, this lovely, ageless fairy tale of a story has been, in this production, tarted up - and to my mid completely destroyed - by the high powered, technically over the top, needlessly virtuosic choreography of Patti Columbo.  The credit at the top of the show misleadingly says it is a Jerome Robbins direted and choreographed production when it is nothing of the kind. Robbins was one of this country's greatest choreographers, as accomplished in ballet as on Broadway and yet he understood that choreography should be suited to the subject, and ought not run roughshod over it.  This is known in some circles as taste. a quality utterly lacking here.  This production's choreography is obscenely showy, replete with needlessly difficult technical stunts  and completely obscures the delight, charm and sheer silliness that Robbins' genius applied to the tale. Here we are subjected to a cheap effort at achieving  ""wow"" factor that is self defeating. Triple pirouettes in this context are not charming in the slightest .I am an actor singer myself and admit that, although I have never had the opportunity to play Hook, it has always been one of my life long dreams.  However if this version had been the only version I had seen, playing Hook would never have entered my mind!  This Hook is a bore.  He is merely a scene chewer and not a very pleasant one at that, with no sense of the utter joy, wit and charm that Cyril Richard made such an indelible part of the role.  That is perhaps the single saddest aspect to this entire production.My advice: by Hook or by crook, find some way to get ahold of the Mary Martin/Cyril Richard/Jerome Robbins version.  It's not showy.  In some ways - compared to this one - it is crude.  It's not glitzy, it is simple. And quite silly. And thus utterly charming.I perhaps have overused the word charm in this review, but charming is what Peter Pan is, or else why mount it at all?The Jerome Robbins Peter Pan, precisely because of its charm, is moving, and in it's understanding of what makes a show like Peter Pan worthwhile it is a sad example of how the love and respect for the art of theater which used to be the norm has given way to a pursuit of commerce which today often destroys what was best in our past.

Three of the Lost Boys were played by girls but I am use to seeing girls get male leads. Well my eye was on Slightly and Twin # 2 (due to them being the only boys). I have to say (Forgive this Mary) the 1955 version sucked!! Cons are listed belowCONS1. Way older actors!2. The Lost Boys didn't even sing (Poor things)3. The choregraphy was awful (God Bless the choregrapher for this one)4. The sets were too colorufl (Bink) nice try set designers5. Mary Martin can't sing even if her life depended on it.I just love this new improved version, that's why I recorded over my Mary Martin version tape. I took one little glance and said sorry ain't gonna miss you and recorded Three Men And A Baby. The day I got this I was thinking Mom don't put me through the Peter Pan stage (Thinking it was awful one like the other tape). Still when it got in the VCR I was stunned with oh's and awe's. Now today 13 years old I still love this movie I own the soundtrack that way when I am not watching the movie and I can still hear the music. The first time I heard the Lost Boys sing I was shocked and up dancing with them. I almost know all the dance moves. I like the upper-body person so when I saw Slightly lay Wendy down (Which might I add he held her) I was thinking oh,a strong boy I like that. Ten tons better then the oringinal lock yourself up if you haven't got the point yet. I am looking forward to getting this on DVD for Easter (Hope I will that is).

And female ""Indians"" less clothing.Let people think it's a psychological decision. Who cares as long as they buy tickets?Rigby moves well and is wiry. When she's not straining to follow the track, she is an excellent actor. She looks like hexx though. Not just that she is thin, but tired tired tired--the airbrushing on the CD Case was so severe as to make me think it was a painting. I hope she feels better now.  Anyway, the lip-synching severely hurt the acting. As a sometimes actor and dancer, I know it is a burden to have to follow a track. The acting would have been better and more natural had they not been lip-synching, but they had to do this to get Cathy Rigby (I have read that she has since learned to sing).Wendy and her brothers were well-acted and fun. Hook was appropriately creepy. Jane was excellent; it was such a small role and she was amazing in conveying the joy of freedom and the heartbreak her freedom will cause her mother.I don't care that the lost ""boys"" are played by adults when the main character is a 12 year old boy played by a 40 some year old woman. I don't care that they didn't get real Indians--should they have found real pirates, too? I do care that the fun, spontanaety, joy of a live performance was only halfway there.  I do care that my daughter is getting her idea of Indians from this show.  I can't forbid her to watch it for the racism, nor can I find much that is both less racist and as much fun for her to watch. Parents of young children will know that if a child likes something, he or she wants to watch it often, maybe endlessly.)There were exuberent moments, though, and the orchestra interpreted the score beautifully.

Also, Cyril Richard is a far-better (and funnier) Capt. Hook than in this new version, where the Capt. is quite scary (for the little ones) and sinister. All this aside, the performance was quite good for a revival, as the acrobatics (flying) and technical staging is far superior to the NBC-1960 version by Mary Martin, which, sadly, is not currently ""in-print"" except for a few ""bootleg"" versions out there.Cathy sings and performs very well and the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Silverberg ""starrmaker""","[0, 0]","After a new production on Broadway was launched with Sandy Duncan assuming the role from Mary Martin, producers went back to the drawing board and cast Cathy Rigby, the Olympic Gymnast. Gone was the TV perinnal that started on Broadway with Mary Martiin, who is now only remembered as the Mother of Dallas star, Larry Hagman, with less tecnically advanced production values. Shown yearly on NBC, you can actually see the wires attached to Ms. Martin's harness and costume. Although Ms. Rigby had no trainning or desire to be an actress, producers spent time helping her to acquire the skills to star in this production, which was taped for A&E. Although another viewer cited faults, she claimed she saw like lip-synching, I did not notice this.What is different about this production, is that all the actors use an English accent unlike the Martin version. Even the adults in the audience were captivated by Ms.Rigby as Peter. The new actor assuming the role of Captain  Hook did an excellent job. He did not scare children in an unrealistic way Cyril Richard, the original did. Ms. Rigby has continued to reprise the role in a touring production around Christmastime to the enjoyment of children and adults. I enjoyed seeing this production. Although I have mentioned Ms.Martin in this review, I can accept Ms.Rigby's interpretation of the role. What comes next is a new production by NBC, with an unnamed cast at this point.  I can hardly wait who is Peter this time. HD will add a new dimension to this and the previous version.

The picture quality and sound on this DVD is superb. The set is far more advanced and impressive than the original Mary Martin version. The flying is more real and breathtaking also. Cathy Rigby soars over the stage beautifully, showing off talent in flips and turns through the air. As other reviewers have said before, there are some annoying differences if you are used to the orignal version. First of all, Cathy Rigby can not compare to Mary Martin. She is more masculine and can't carry a tune as well as her predessor. She seems to be more of a mean character in this version, pushing the lost boys around, well in this case they arn't really boys, and her voice isn't as playful as Mary's. I think Richard Cyril (or whoever played the original Hook) was somewhat better and more memorable.  I like the added sequence of Marooner's Rock with neat mermaids and flowing water. I don't like how they used a much younger Mrs. Darling, she seems to be 25. Here, Smee is also a bit young for the character, he could easily pass for 20. As I said, the lost boys arn't really boys, but older guys, which is a disappointment. I would like to see the scene changes as if watching a live production, but they are not shown in this film. You can see the audience clapping along and credits come on the screen, telling of the name of the different scenes or rather where they take place. And sadly, Liza, (the nanny lady) never gets to go to Neverland as the original. Tiger Lily's dance is not as fun. But overall I would say this is a very good revival of a classic. I give it 5 stars for it is amazing in its own right, but compared to the original it falters a bit. Defintately pick this one up if you loved the original, or have never seen it. It is an incredible performance to enjoy with the family.",5,"An amazing revival of a classic musical, with pros and cons",971568000,"10 15, 2000",2000,1934,"['was', 'very', 'excited', 'receive', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'putting', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'greeted', 'nice', 'menu', 'features', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'DVD', 'superb', 'set', 'far', 'more', 'advanced', 'impressive', 'original', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'version', 'flying', 'more', 'real', 'breathtaking', 'also', 'Cathy', 'Rigby', 'stage', 'beautifully', 'showing', 'off', 'talent', 'flips', 'air', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'annoying', 'differences', 'are', 'used', 'orignal', 'version', 'First', 'Cathy', 'Rigby', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'more', 'masculine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'tune', 'as', 'well', 'predessor', 'be', 'more', 'mean', 'character', 'version', 'pushing', 'lost', 'boys', 'well', 'case', 'ar', ""n't"", 'really', 'boys', 'voice', ""n't"", 'as', 'playful', 'Mary', 'think', 'Richard', 'Cyril', 'played', 'original', 'Hook', 'was', 'somewhat', 'better', 'more', 'memorable', 'like', 'added', 'sequence', 'Marooner', 'Rock', 'neat', 'mermaids', 'flowing', 'water', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'used', 'much', 'younger', 'Mrs', 'Darling', 'be', '25', 'Here', 'Smee', 'also', 'bit', 'young', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'pass', '20', 'said', 'lost', 'boys', 'ar', ""n't"", 'really', 'boys', 'older', 'guys', 'disappointment', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'scene', 'changes', 'watching', 'live', 'production', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'audience', 'clapping', 'along', 'credits', 'come', 'screen', 'telling', 'name', 'different', 'scenes', 'rather', 'where', 'take', 'place', 'sadly', 'Liza', 'nanny', 'lady', 'never', 'go', 'Neverland', 'original', 'Tiger', 'Lily', 'dance', 'not', 'fun', 'overall', 'would', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'revival', 'classic', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'amazing', 'own', 'right', 'compared', 'original', 'bit', 'Defintately', 'one', 'up', 'loved', 'original', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'incredible', 'performance', 'enjoy', 'family']",Peter Pan VHS
