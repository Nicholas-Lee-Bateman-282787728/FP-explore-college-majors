In the beginning, the acting is also a little stiff and the plotlines thin.  As the storyline progresses, things do improve somewhat, making this still a great edition to a fantasy geek's collection -- at the right price, of course.",2,"Very Cheezy Sci-Fi, but Still Fun",1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,347,"['series', 'getting', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'film', 'grain', 'special', 'effects', 'definitely', 'give', 'away', 'beginning', 'acting', 'also', 'little', 'stiff', 'plotlines', 'thin', 'storyline', 'things', 'do', 'improve', 'somewhat', 'making', 'still', 'great', 'edition', 'fantasy', 'geek', 'collection', 'right', 'price', 'course']",N/A

While it has weak acting such as one might find at a B-movie, and outdoor sets that repeat from episode to episode (same village buildings in quite a few), it has a special charm to it.  The stories were, for the most part, creative and I grew to enjoy spending time with the characters.As a synopsis, Sinbad is an adventuring sailor, earning his way by carrying cargo to various ports.  The stories involve him and four of his crewmen as they right the various wrongs they encounter.  They also are visited upon by giant creatures, both men and beasts, and battle demons from time to time.  Basic standard fantasy fare, but charming in a way.",5,Good B-movie type of show,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,731,"['Canadian', 'produced', 'show', 'was', 'syndication', 'channels', 'USA', '1996', '1998', 'weak', 'acting', 'such', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'B-movie', 'outdoor', 'sets', 'repeat', 'episode', 'episode', 'same', 'village', 'buildings', 'quite', 'few', 'special', 'charm', 'stories', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'creative', 'grew', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time', 'characters.As', 'synopsis', 'Sinbad', 'adventuring', 'sailor', 'earning', 'way', 'carrying', 'cargo', 'various', 'ports', 'stories', 'involve', 'four', 'crewmen', 'right', 'various', 'wrongs', 'encounter', 'also', 'are', 'visited', 'giant', 'creatures', 'men', 'beasts', 'battle', 'demons', 'time', 'time', 'Basic', 'standard', 'fantasy', 'fare', 'charming', 'way']",N/A

No it wasn't going to win any awards but it was good ole fashion fun and fantasy week after week. Just try to find that on tv these days. Yes as everyone said the sets were reused and the graphics were out there but hey imagine trying to pull off reactions to nothing and then see what they came up with. Zen Gesner could give over the top performances occasionally but that made Sinbad even more fun. Plus for the guys, the ladies were certainly great to look at,just ask my husband and for the girls well Sinbad was certainly easy on the eyes,especially in season 2 when they let him macho up.",5,Fantasy Fun At It's Best,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,713,"['absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'week', 'looked', 'forward', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'younger', 'mean', '25', 'lol', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'was', 'good', 'ole', 'fashion', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'week', 'week', 'Just', 'try', 'find', 'tv', 'days', 'everyone', 'said', 'sets', 'were', 'reused', 'graphics', 'were', 'there', 'hey', 'imagine', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'reactions', 'nothing', 'then', 'see', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'Zen', 'Gesner', 'could', 'give', 'over', 'top', 'performances', 'occasionally', 'made', 'Sinbad', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'guys', 'ladies', 'were', 'certainly', 'great', 'look', 'just', 'ask', 'husband', 'girls', 'well', 'Sinbad', 'was', 'certainly', 'easy', 'eyes', 'especially', 'season', '2', 'when', 'let', 'macho', 'up']",N/A

The picture quality is as good as I'd expect from a DVD and certainly better than when it ran on television.There is an episode menu on each disc but there are no chapter-menus. No big deal.The availability of this set though, seems to change as often as did the Time-Slot for the Show when it ran on Television.Anyway, if you can get it, it's well worth purchasing.

1044029,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B000M8CCA6,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[1, 1]","I'm not sure my title is fair, because there are quite a few props, costumes and CGI effects in this wonderful TV series.  It's campy, it's not realistic in the least, the acting one-take, the stories are right out of a young boy's adventure book, but it does entertain.But, for all that, the single village they built and used for every port of call, the boat set, the makeup, the costumes, they help establish a fantasy medieval Persian Gulf, complete with dragons, sea serpents, demons, harpies and a number of other baddies, bad guys and foemen and foewomen who have designs on Sinbad, his crew, his ship, and the world.  But Sinbad and his friends are there to stop them with skill, guile, strength and knowing that they will help their friends as their friends will help them.For all of the other high minded stuff that I'm used to watching, I might have classified this as a guilty pleasure, but even though it looks a bit like a low budget production, it has heart and is entertaining.  Even though the costumes are clean, the actors are clean, the props are clean, and even the violence and action are G-Rated, and the acting is fairly basic, &#34;The Adventures of Sinbad&#34; has its own level of sophistication as it conveys messages of friendship, unity and braving dangers to young viewers, or those who are young at heart.  Few shows of the time aimed at young viewers would build a full scale Arabian Dow, shoot night battles with mounted troops at night, dress actors and stuntmen in medieval garb and arm them with swords, bow and armor, or even train a falcon for one of the actresses.  The Nomad herself, Sinbad's ship, may be CGI from a distance, but her deck was real.  The characters may be clean, but they weren't afraid to get their hands dirty fighting evil wherever it reared its head, and righting wrongs.This is what great TV is all about.In short, this show was just pure fun.  Good themes and stories for the child in all of us, who has fantasies about joining a ship like the Nomad, and setting sail for far off lands filled with adventure.  I'm just sorry it only lasted a couple of seasons.  It should have lasted for two, maybe even three more.Highly imaginative even if shot on the cheap, the producers didn't capture great thesping, but they gave us adventure.",5,Fun low budget adventure.,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2297,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'title', 'fair', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'props', 'costumes', 'CGI', 'effects', 'wonderful', 'TV', 'series', 'campy', 'not', 'realistic', 'least', 'acting', 'one-take', 'stories', 'are', 'right', 'young', 'boy', 'adventure', 'book', 'entertain.But', 'single', 'village', 'built', 'used', 'port', 'call', 'boat', 'set', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'help', 'establish', 'fantasy', 'medieval', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'complete', 'dragons', 'sea', 'serpents', 'demons', 'harpies', 'number', 'other', 'baddies', 'bad', 'guys', 'foemen', 'foewomen', 'who', 'have', 'designs', 'Sinbad', 'crew', 'ship', 'world', 'Sinbad', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'stop', 'skill', 'guile', 'strength', 'knowing', 'will', 'help', 'friends', 'friends', 'will', 'help', 'them.For', 'other', 'high', 'minded', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'used', 'watching', 'might', 'have', 'classified', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'even', 'bit', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'heart', 'entertaining', 'Even', 'costumes', 'are', 'clean', 'actors', 'are', 'clean', 'props', 'are', 'clean', 'even', 'violence', 'action', 'are', 'G-Rated', 'acting', 'fairly', 'basic', '34', 'Adventures', 'Sinbad', '34', 'own', 'level', 'sophistication', 'messages', 'friendship', 'unity', 'braving', 'dangers', 'young', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'heart', 'Few', 'shows', 'time', 'aimed', 'young', 'viewers', 'would', 'build', 'full', 'scale', 'Arabian', 'Dow', 'shoot', 'night', 'battles', 'mounted', 'troops', 'night', 'dress', 'actors', 'stuntmen', 'medieval', 'garb', 'arm', 'swords', 'bow', 'armor', 'even', 'train', 'falcon', 'one', 'actresses', 'Nomad', 'Sinbad', 'ship', 'may', 'be', 'CGI', 'distance', 'deck', 'was', 'real', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'clean', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'fighting', 'evil', 'wherever', 'reared', 'head', 'righting', 'wrongs.This', 'what', 'great', 'TV', 'about.In', 'short', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'pure', 'fun', 'Good', 'themes', 'stories', 'child', 'who', 'fantasies', 'joining', 'ship', 'Nomad', 'setting', 'sail', 'far', 'lands', 'filled', 'adventure', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'only', 'lasted', 'couple', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'two', 'maybe', 'even', 'three', 'more.Highly', 'imaginative', 'even', 'shot', 'cheap', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'great', 'thesping', 'gave', 'adventure']",N/A
