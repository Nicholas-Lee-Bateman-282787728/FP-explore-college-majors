1410467,A188LOA4EPLIKV,B004I9D7BI,BLACKCAT,"[0, 0]","I love Micky Yoochun of  Super K-KPOP group TVXQ/JYJ. Matter-of-fact as I type this review I am watching their music video &#34;O&#34;Anyway, moving along. I loved this drama, not because of my bias toward Yoochun but because it was really good. The story line, the beautiful scenery, the supporting cast. All superb. Though I have noticed, the theme of Sunghyunkwan Scandal is used alot in Korea. Basically, a young woman is forced to enrolled in a all boys school/enviroment to earn a living for her family.  For instance, it has been used it in dramas like (You're Beautiful, Coffee Prince, and To The beautiful You&#34; in each case the plot is basically the same, a woman has to pass off as a man, while at the same time, falling in love with her main chracter, who has to check his manhood to make sure he's not falling for a man. Sound simple, right. I guess it is how you look at it.  I enjoyed each of these dramas, the writing was fresh, crisp, and emotional. The females acting was great, as the women had to pretend to be men and it really drew you in. My only complaint was that, the women didn't look like men, in the real world the men would have known it. But I guess that is why they call it ACTING. Still I would recommend, Sunjkyukwan Scandal.",5,Micky Yoochun,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1262,"['love', 'Micky', 'Yoochun', 'Super', 'K-KPOP', 'group', 'TVXQ/JYJ', 'Matter-of-fact', 'type', 'review', 'am', 'watching', 'music', 'video', '34', 'O', '34', 'Anyway', 'moving', 'along', 'loved', 'drama', 'not', 'bias', 'Yoochun', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'have', 'noticed', 'theme', 'Sunghyunkwan', 'Scandal', 'used', 'alot', 'Korea', 'Basically', 'young', 'woman', 'forced', 'enrolled', 'boys', 'school/enviroment', 'earn', 'living', 'family', 'instance', 'been', 'used', 'dramas', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'beautiful', '34', 'case', 'plot', 'basically', 'same', 'woman', 'pass', 'off', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'falling', 'love', 'main', 'chracter', 'who', 'check', 'manhood', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'falling', 'man', 'Sound', 'simple', 'right', 'guess', 'how', 'look', 'enjoyed', 'dramas', 'writing', 'was', 'fresh', 'crisp', 'emotional', 'females', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'women', 'had', 'pretend', 'be', 'men', 'really', 'drew', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'men', 'real', 'world', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'guess', 'why', 'call', 'ACTING', 'Still', 'would', 'recommend', 'Sunjkyukwan', 'Scandal']",SUNGKYUNKWAN SCANDAL KOREAN DRAMA 8 DVDs w/English Subtitles

Their chemistry was great and they just drew me in.  I would have given this five stars except I felt at times like I was getting preached at on the equality of all.  I totally agree that all people are equal but I think it didn't have to be so in my face at various points of the show.  I think this story was a little simple and could have gone to a totally different level if they added a bit more tension.  Overall, however, I really enjoyed it and plan on watching it again.As for family friendly...overall I would not recommend for those under 12 as some may find the basic plot concerning.",4,Entertaining but a bit preachy!,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,717,"['enjoyed', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'actors', 'where', 'SO', 'adorable', 'fell', 'love', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'chemistry', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'drew', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'felt', 'times', 'was', 'getting', 'preached', 'equality', 'totally', 'agree', 'people', 'are', 'equal', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'so', 'face', 'various', 'points', 'show', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'simple', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'totally', 'different', 'level', 'added', 'bit', 'more', 'tension', 'Overall', 'however', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'plan', 'watching', 'family', 'friendly', 'overall', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', '12', 'may', 'find', 'basic', 'plot', 'concerning']",SUNGKYUNKWAN SCANDAL KOREAN DRAMA 8 DVDs w/English Subtitles

YA Entertainment english subs are the very best, they will not disolve into mandarin to english anywhere in this film. Type in YA Entertainment here on Amazon and see what Korean dramas they have to offer if you need good subs.I loved all four main characters---this is another girl enters all boys college pretending to be a boy---main character falls in love with her and thinks he's gay theme. This is however, a cut above others I've seen, as the students and teacher readily admit the ""he"" is an unusually pretty, unusually 'girly' boy.The story is wonderful and doesn't get boring, ever. It's also a period piece and takes place near the end of the 18th century.I own a lot of Asian dramas, and this is one of the best.

1410473,A1EBJKTH0V0YKH,B004I9D7BI,Fiction Writer,"[1, 1]","This is a fun historical drama-comedy. I watched it without expectations, and was quickly drawn into the story. It's witty and intriguing, and there's romance, too, with plenty of comical misunderstandings and tension.The subtitles are good until the last two or three episodes, when whoever was translating seems to have been drunk or inattentive: fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, and just downright nonsense. However, the gist of story can still be inferred from the actors themselves and from the occasional subtitle that makes sense.
