854865,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B00049QJ48,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","I came over this movie cheap and I did not have allot of expectations when I sat down to watch it. Now Shadows of the Dead is about a young couple who get attacked by a strange man in the woods, the man turn out to be some sort of zombie and suddenly the male protagonist is infected and it do not take long before his girlfriend is to. The pair of them, not knowing what have happened to them take refuge in a cabin in the woods. Slowly the couple turns into full fledged zombies, though they do keep their minds, and the movie is about the horror they experience as they go through  this transformation and how that affects their relationship.I really like this film, however I have to admit that I like it for it's originality, if there where many movies like this then Shadows of the dead would probably not rank that high. There are hundred if not thousands of movies where a group of desperate survivors try to fight of zombies, there are very few movies where the story is told from the perspective of the zombies themselves and even fewer that are a love story such as this one. Now the movie itself is not bad, but it do lack a bit of planning, the viewer have to be rather generous with suspense of disbelief. The movie get a bit drawn out at times and it might have done better as a short film than as a full movie. However I think the actors do a good job, and all in all this film is atmospheric and interesting for it's weirdness and uniqueness.Shadows of the Dead is obviously produced on the cheap, the costumes and make up are not exactly top notch, however I think they get to job done. All in all I am very pleased with this film. I am a huge zombie fan and Shadows of the Dead bring something new to a genre which is often rather stale. This is also great for anyone who want a different love story. I think Shadows of the Dead would fit perfectly for a spooky Valentines day movie if you are tired of the typical romantic comedy flick, s grab your ghoul and put Shadows of the Dead in the DVD player.",4,Different zombie love story.,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2021,"['came', 'movie', 'cheap', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'allot', 'expectations', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Now', 'Dead', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'get', 'attacked', 'strange', 'man', 'woods', 'man', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'sort', 'zombie', 'suddenly', 'male', 'protagonist', 'infected', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'girlfriend', 'pair', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'have', 'happened', 'take', 'refuge', 'cabin', 'woods', 'Slowly', 'couple', 'full', 'fledged', 'zombies', 'do', 'keep', 'minds', 'movie', 'horror', 'experience', 'go', 'transformation', 'how', 'relationship.I', 'really', 'film', 'however', 'have', 'admit', 'like', 'originality', 'where', 'many', 'movies', 'then', 'Shadows', 'dead', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'rank', 'high', 'are', 'hundred', 'not', 'thousands', 'movies', 'where', 'group', 'desperate', 'survivors', 'try', 'fight', 'zombies', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'where', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'zombies', 'even', 'fewer', 'are', 'love', 'story', 'such', 'one', 'Now', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'do', 'lack', 'bit', 'planning', 'viewer', 'have', 'be', 'rather', 'generous', 'suspense', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'get', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'times', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'short', 'film', 'full', 'movie', 'However', 'think', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'interesting', 'weirdness', 'uniqueness.Shadows', 'Dead', 'obviously', 'produced', 'cheap', 'costumes', 'make', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'top', 'notch', 'however', 'think', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'film', 'am', 'huge', 'zombie', 'fan', 'Shadows', 'Dead', 'bring', 'something', 'new', 'genre', 'often', 'rather', 'stale', 'also', 'great', 'anyone', 'who', 'want', 'different', 'love', 'story', 'think', 'Shadows', 'Dead', 'would', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'spooky', 'Valentines', 'day', 'movie', 'are', 'tired', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'flick', 's', 'grab', 'ghoul', 'put', 'Shadows', 'Dead', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A
854866,A3MTQQ5N6GOV23,B00049QJ48,"Annaleise Ferreira ""Acolyte of Cthulhu""","[2, 2]","I got interested in this from seeing the cover art in the video store, and found the blurb on the back to be interesting. It seemed like a unique take on the zombie movie, so I checked it out, knowing that it would probably be a very cheaply-made movie but could be fun. I found it pretty well-written with good interaction between the two leads, and the film makes good use of its low budget. It doesn't look cheap, except for some shaky camera work and a lack of variety of locations. The characters avoid many of the dumb mistakes people make in these kinds of movies, for instance they decide to stay in the car until morning instead of run around in the woods, although they also make some monumentally stupid ones, like deciding not to go to the hospital  after John is bitten by something in the woods until he actually starts getting sick. I also have to wonder why it's so easy for them to steal medicine from the clinic and why the electricity in the abandoned cabin still works. The movie also doesn't make clear whether they ever got their car back so I wonder how they got around so easily. All in all it's a fun movie which moves slowly in some places and has some clunky dialogue, but worth checking out if you're into zombie movies with an actual plot.",3,Interesting low-budget horror,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1268,"['got', 'interested', 'seeing', 'cover', 'art', 'video', 'store', 'found', 'blurb', 'back', 'be', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'unique', 'take', 'zombie', 'movie', 'checked', 'out', 'knowing', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'cheaply-made', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'fun', 'found', 'pretty', 'well-written', 'good', 'interaction', 'two', 'leads', 'film', 'good', 'use', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'look', 'cheap', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'lack', 'variety', 'locations', 'characters', 'avoid', 'many', 'dumb', 'mistakes', 'people', 'make', 'kinds', 'movies', 'instance', 'decide', 'stay', 'car', 'morning', 'instead', 'run', 'around', 'woods', 'also', 'make', 'monumentally', 'stupid', 'ones', 'deciding', 'not', 'go', 'hospital', 'John', 'bitten', 'something', 'woods', 'actually', 'getting', 'sick', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'easy', 'steal', 'medicine', 'clinic', 'why', 'electricity', 'abandoned', 'cabin', 'still', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'ever', 'got', 'car', 'back', 'so', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'around', 'so', 'easily', 'fun', 'movie', 'slowly', 'places', 'clunky', 'dialogue', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'zombie', 'movies', 'actual', 'plot']",N/A

854868,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B00049QJ48,Ghoulie Guru,"[6, 6]","I watched this movie, and many brain cells died. I felt like one of the lead characters. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like a zombie, pick this one up.The story concerns a guy who gets attacked while taking a woodland stroll with his girlfriend. For reasons unknown, the attack causes our hero's heart to stop. He's apparently dead, but he doesn't seem to know it. So, he hangs out in his apartment and his girlfriend brings him hot soup and tries to nurse him back to health. Of course, it's only a matter of time before our guy decides to infect his girlfriend with this lovely gift. So, now she's kinda undead too. They hang out in their bedroom and bemoan their fate. Lots of caked on white makeup ensues. She hates him for doing this to her. The End.I understand that when you have five dollars to make a horror movie, one of the first things you decide to do is find a way to contain the story. Movies like ""Saw"", 'Cabin Fever"", ""Evil Dead"" and ""Misery"" show that you can have a very effective horror film with a minimum of locations. But setting your entire movie in a bedroom with two undead characters who don't really do anything but bicker is just plain lazy. It's about as scary as watching paint dry.

Well, I can say I've seen alot better movies than this one. In a nutshell, a couple becomes stranded in the woods and discover what they think is a dead body. Wrong. After coming in  contact with the ""dead body"", they both become infected with a deadly desease. They seek refuge in a deserted cabin because they have no where else to go. They soon realize that they will both suffer a horrible death. They turn to thoughts of murder in order to save their own lives.
