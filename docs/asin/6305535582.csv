Holyoak,"[2, 2]","This movie tells the tale of Joan of Arc, aka &quot;The Maid of Lorraine.&quot;  The interesting part of this movie to me is not what happens while Joan is accepted by the people as their hero and military  leader, but the events preceeding and following that.  I think that the  attention paid to political wheeling and dealing behind Joan's back, and  the jealousy and pious attitude of the king's main advisor from the church  move the story telling to a higher level -- this is not just an action  adventure!Joan realizes at a young age that she has a special connection  with a matron saint who gives her inspiration and direction.  With that  direction Joan is able to ovecome social and political stigmas related to  her gender and become a force in a France split by dissention and torn by  war.  She shows a steely determination to serve her king as she clears the  way for him to be crowned king over a united France.  She stands up to  royalty and clergy alike as she moves toward that goal.The acting is  good, the story is believable, and the emotions protrayed ring true.

Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  We got to see how Joan won the heart of the people and Leelee does it flawlessly, you don't see that in Messenger.  The Messenger skips how she got to be St. Joan in the eyes of the people.  In Leelee's Joan, I can believe she led her people to victory in battle because Leelee is so exceptional in the battle scenes while Milla seemed completely lost.

While there may be a few historical accuracies in this film, they are more than compensated for with the loving and respectful way in which the material is treated. It successfully accomplishes the difficult task of both providing a wonderful action/adventure film while at the same time serving as an inspirational, spiritual docu-drama.This is such an emotional, heartfelt production. Even after numerous viewings I'm still moved to tears several times during each viewing. While 'Joan of Arc' boasts a formidable, all-star cast; Peter O'Toole, Powers Boothe, Jacqueline Bisset, Peter Strauss, Shirley MacLaine and more, the two greatest performances are those of LeeLee and Chad Willett as her friend and military companion Jean de Metz. From the moment of their first encounter when Joan is just beginning on her spiritual journey to her tragic burning on the stake, Jean is forever by her side. Their bond of mutual admiration and unspoken love is the glue that ties the storyline together so perfectly.What an incredible directorial job by Christian Duquay!

468242,AB34G6VKP28L,6305535582,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Joan of Arc has always been an icon in history, a woman of great faith as she at only the age of seventeen went after what she believed to be God's will with heart and soul and lead France to its salvation from the tyrannical British rule of the 15th Century. The obvious fascination with her has turned out a number of films, the most impressive of these the television mini-series by Hallmark. In flaming letters on a black background we are introduced to the title of the film and heroine. As it fades away, replaced by a burning pier upon which she stands, lifting her eyes heavenward and whispering, ""Thank you... thank you..."" a shudder, perhaps a deeply felt faith, passes through us.Joan of Arc  is an unwanted child, born to a family of boys. Her father is a tyrannical, cruel man whose only interest is that of himself and his family. Fortunately her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) is fond of her, and Joan grows into young maturity befriended only by a blind child and the local prior, who sees in her an earnest desire to serve God. As the invading English burn and pillage the villages of France, making their way toward the capital and the home of the Dauphin Charles, Joan (Leelee Sobieski) is visited again by her patron saint Catherine and told that she will lead France to victory. Her way becomes clear after her village is burned and they are refused aid by the landowner, Sir Robert de Baudricourt, one of Charles' many pious land agents who seeks to fill his own stomach rather than serve his king. Robert's men are ordered to take a wagon of food as far as Orleans for the Prince's benefit. Abandoning her family, Joan conceals herself among the wares only to find that the wagon is bound instead for Robert's own kitchen. Taken in to see Sir Robert, Joan is mockingly given the title of ""The Maid of Lorraine,"" the mythical female savior destined to save France spoken of by Merlin in myth. But even as Robert refuses to send her on to Charles, strange things begin happening in his city.The men follow Jean's guidance without question, strengthening the walls of the city and building up defenses. Robert's chickens also refuse to lay eggs. In desperation, Robert sends her on to Charles with a letter of recommendation... and his chickens begin to lay again. Joan is welcomed by Prince Charles, who finds her something of a commodity, a way to give the people vision; but an advocate against her comes in the form of Charles ""spiritual advisor,"" Bishop Cauchon (Peter O'Toole), who does not believe that a mere girl has the right to determine the fate of France. Yet even he cannot deny the power that radiates from Joan, even as he struggles with his own personal beliefs. Charles has appointed Joan as the head of his armies, but his military advisor gives her a backseat. She's there to cheer the troops on, lead the charge, and ""try not to get killed.""But Joan is no pushover... and it will be she that will raise a cry against all of England and frame the powerful woman who has become a legend in her own right. Treachery lies in the eyes of someone within the Prince's confidence... and even Charles himself will betray her, though all will regret what they have done as the girl is granted entrance to heaven through the burning pier. But before her lies a great many battles to be fought, a great many people to touch and the faith that inspired France to its victory. Part history, part myth, with a little bit of imagination, this epic miniseries is a masterpiece in its attempt to bring Joan to life in living color... in a way you've never seen her before. Joan of Arc is quite impressive and while not following history exactly it does its best to portray the life of the young woman with clarity and passion, the praise of which belongs solely to the lead actress, Leelee Sobieski. She has the ""look"" of Joan of Arc... innocence mixed with wisdom, passion intertwined with fear. A strict Catholic, her belief in God is strong and her faith in the words spoken to her by the ""saints"" ideally strengthened.Forced to evaluate her motives at one point, she repents of the sin of pride. Some may shun this film for its devout Middle Ages Catholicism but Joan of Arc was Catholic, and the Church in those days was often corrupted by crooked politicians within the church system. You are drawn into the story early on and kept pinned there throughout the full several hours. The characters all have their own amount of depth, Joan most critically, secondly the spineless and self-centered Dauphin who would betray her, and thirdly the Bishop (Peter O'Toole) who realizes too late that Joan's faith is in the right and questions his own in sending this innocent and trusting girl to an early grave. From the first glimpse into the eyes of Joan to the last moment as she looks heavenward we've been taught a lesson about faith, courage and treachery that we won't soon forget.

468248,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305535582,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[33, 34]","Only rarely does a television miniseries rival the power, beauty, and excellence of Hollywood's most celebrated theatrical releases.  1999's Joan of Arc is one of those rare gems; it is simply an exquisite film of epic proportions, boasting one of the most impressive cast lists I have ever seen.  Yet even among such stellar names as Jacqueline Bisset, Peter O'Toole, Robert Loggia, Shirley MacLaine, and Maximilian Schell, the young Leelee Sobieski keeps all eyes riveted upon herself with her moving, deeply human portrayal of one of history's most famous and tragic heroines.Over the course of three hours, we follow the young peasant girl who became The Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc, from the day of her birth to her final fiery moments.  I do not know enough details of the historical Joan of Arc's life to truly judge the historical accuracy of this film, but from what I can tell and have read, it does try mightily to follow the story as closely as possible, working especially hard to recreate the social and political situation of Joan's time.  The historical Joan of Arc remains a controversial figure, with learned men and women interpreting her life and story in a couple of quite divergent ways.  This movie's Joan is the bravest and most pious of souls, and she meets her fate willingly as a martyr and not a victim; her faith in God's plan for her never wavers.  The presentation of her visions is kept low-key and free of creative exploitation.  The compassion of her soul is revealed countless times over the course of the movie, and the incredible humanity of her character is this film's true strength.  Still, it remains difficult to understand exactly how the French nation could turn against and burn at the stake a girl who fought for the unification of the French people.  The film offers some illuminating yet difficult to understand (at least for me) reasons and motivations through the story of Bishop Cauchon.  Peter O'Toole is absolutely marvelous as Cauchon, reflecting much of Joan's tragic end in his own life.  The character remained something of an enigma to me until the end, but no moment was as moving and telling as a short shot of Cauchon privately breaking down in tears as Joan is being executed.  Shirley MacLaine warrants special mention in honor of her memorable cameo appearance toward the end.  Suffice it to say that I could write many glowing paragraphs in praise of all of the incredible performances in this movie.  The only performance that failed to enthrall me was Neil Patrick Harris's portrayal of King Charles; even with his Moe Howard-inspired haircut, all I could see was Doogie Howser, making it hard for me to accept the wiliness and despotism of the character.No epic is complete without incredible visuals and sound, and Joan of Arc is amply blessed, with an exception or two, in both regards.  The music is just wonderful and soul-stirring, particularly the one battle scene in which the angelic voice of Charlotte Church singing Panis Angelicus looms over the fray.  The 15th century battle scenes were done quite well, as was the look and feel of the mediaeval French setting.  One would never know that filming actually took place in the Czech Republic.  The fact that this is not a big-budget Hollywood theatrical release is apparent in two scenes, though; both of these involve characters standing in the foreground watching a group of people in the background, and it appears obvious to my eyes that what we are seeing in front of our characters is a screen projection.  My only other quibbles have to do with the actual fight scenes.  While men were slashing each other down left and right, I only saw blood appear on one sword over the course of the movie.  Even more interestingly, whenever an important character was killed or injured in battle, both sides seemed to just stop fighting as long as we and the other characters were focused on the injured party.All in all, though, I was more than impressed with Joan of Arc.  No matter how accurate or inaccurate it might be in terms of the history, it is inarguably a touching dramatic masterpiece.  Even though you know how it will end even before you watch it, the final moments are sure to send tears coursing down your cheeks and move your heart in ways few movies can ever succeed in doing.

It was a hard decision but what drew me to purchasing  this DVD was the cover.  Sobieski's look as Joan of Arc looked more  convincing and she looked so pure and innocent.  I wondered how this person  who projects innocence in the cover will play a military leader?  Well, I  don't know much about Leelee Sobieski and after watching this movie, now I  want to watch the movies that she has appeared in because on &quot;Joan of  Arc&quot;, you get solid acting.The long time of this movie made me  wonder if it was going to drag but if anything this movie drew me in from  start to finish and here is why:The good acting by the cast members, the  great scenery and the selection of Leelee Sobieski as the innocent  &quot;Maid of Lorraine&quot;.  She brought something to this movie that  drew you in.  Her facial expressions and even the ending still stays in my  mind.  Wow!  It's unexplainable but I love the movie.  It was done very  well and I'm impressed that it's a TV movie.  The movie gets an A+.What  about the DVD?  Well, since this is a TV movie, I didn't expect too much  from the DVD.  The audio was good and the video was good but at times I saw  some lines on the screen on parts where there is a lot of action.  The  production notes were nice to see but I have to give the DVD a D- for no  significant extras.It appears Sobieski had much to say about the part  according to the production notes, why not include a featurette then?  Or  even the television commercials or promotional features.  So, yes...the  extras rating gets a D-.

We know little about the true Joan  of Arc, but she certainly had fierce charisma as a person and was an  inspiring military leader. This movie's heroine is just young, virginal,  and nice.I found the movie silly in many respects. The holy apparitions  where Joan is bathed in heavenly light do not really go down well these  days. The slow motion battle scenes with angelic music in the background  are a stupid means to avoid one of the greatest conflicts and  contradictions in Joan's life: how can a person inspired by God lead people  to horrible killing and death.What most stroke me in this movie are the  parallells between Joan's depiction and the life of Jesus. Both were guided  by heaven of course, both started young and succeeded to move masses of  people against all odds, both tried to establish a kingdom not for  themselves. See Joan be betrayed by a friend and ask their companions not  to defend her against her captors. See Joan being judged by scheming  religious figures who accept foreign occupation. Incredibly, see Joan in  this movie being witnessed at her martyrdom by her substitute mother and a  young disciple. She is even better than Christ: whereas Jesus on the cross  suffered and doubted, in one of the silliest scenes of this movie, Joan  turns her well groomed face heavenward in the middle of the flames and  thanks God.

Joan comes across played by Sobieski in parts as both vulnerable and strong to the seeming point of invincibility. Strongly admirable is the scene where she defies King Charles in his banquet hall for selling France out to the Bugundians. And harrowing scenes of her interrogation and torture by the inquisition up to her death.This movie is a thousand times better than the sorry excuse for a portrayal of St JoanThe Messenger:The Story Of Joan Of Arc.This movie portrays Joan as a pious, valiant , big hearted, spiritually aware  and patriotic young girl, unlike The Messenger she is portrayed as a psychotic ,ultra-neurotic who the movie seems to suggest was motivated by selfish and bloodthirsty reasons.",5,"Stirring, compelling and majestic",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2201,"['really', 'stirring', 'compelling', 'majestic', 'movie', 'heroism', 'France', 'patron', 'childhood', 'peasant', 'girl', 'French', 'village', 'Domremy', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'awareness', 'nation', 'travails', 'suffering', 'prophecies', 'future', 'regarding', 'evil', 'queen', 'who', 'sold', 'France', 'enemies', 'maiden', 'heroine', 'who', 'would', 'deliver', 'drive', 'enemies', 'out.Lelee', 'Sobieski', 'alluring', 'yet', 'powerful', 'valiant', 'Joan', 'strong', 'combination', 'attractiveness', 'toughness.It', 'sack', 'burning', 'village', 'teenager', 'voices', 'saints', 'telling', 'free', 'France', 'English', 'help', 'Dauphin', 'Charles', 'be', 'crowned', 'king', 'once', 'patriot', 'fighter', 'weak', 'such', 'where', 'man', 'lining', 'up', 'soup', 'make', 'way', 'little', 'child.The', 'Dauphin', 'later', 'King', 'Charles', 'VII', 'France', 'portrayed', 'fullness', 'cynical', 'scheming', 'young', 'monarch', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Doogie', 'Howser', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'pomp', 'gravitas', 'role', 'conniving', 'treacherous', 'Bishop', 'Cauchon.Soul', 'stirring', 'scenes', 'recovery', 'being', 'wounded', 'battle', 'leadership', 'victory', 'French', 'forces', 'Battle', 'Orleans', 'touching', 'scenes', 'own', 'engagement', 'men', 'family', 'intriguing', 'look', 'machinations', 'King', 'Bishop', 'Cauchon', 'Burgundians', 'Inquistion', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Joan', 'played', 'Sobieski', 'parts', 'vulnerable', 'strong', 'seeming', 'point', 'invincibility', 'Strongly', 'admirable', 'scene', 'where', 'King', 'Charles', 'banquet', 'hall', 'selling', 'France', 'Bugundians', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'interrogation', 'torture', 'inquisition', 'up', 'death.This', 'movie', 'thousand', 'times', 'better', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'portrayal', 'St', 'JoanThe', 'Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc.This', 'movie', 'Joan', 'pious', 'valiant', 'big', 'hearted', 'spiritually', 'aware', 'patriotic', 'young', 'girl', 'Messenger', 'portrayed', 'psychotic', 'ultra-neurotic', 'who', 'movie', 'suggest', 'was', 'motivated', 'selfish', 'bloodthirsty', 'reasons']",N/A

Same thing for the miniseries CLEOPATRA, which aired on ABC that same year. I found out several years later after purchasing both films on VHS that the miniseries' had been cut from their original length on television. I felt cheated. Anyway, I finally just saw the complete miniseries for the first time, and it was excellent. Much better than the truncated VHS edition. Same goes for CLEOPATRA. The DVD versions of the films are the complete and unedited miniseries'.Leelee Sobieski did a wonderful job playing Joan Of Arc, and the supporting actors played their parts perfectly. The production notes on the DVD give some insight into what went on behind-the-scenes of this incredible film. Shame that there isn't any documentary or featurette on the making of the movie.This is a movie you can sit down and watch with the whole family. There is violence, but it is not overly graphic, and there's no profanity or sexual situations (though it's implied towards the end that Joan is being sexually assaulted).SPOILER ALERT!!!I do have one question, though, that I thought the complete miniseries would answer, but it didn't.

Leelee Sobieski does a wonderful job of portraying Joan as simultaneously pious and petulant, refusing to waver in the face of opposition to her visions. The Czech countryside is a terrific stand-in for France. Battles are portrayed with terrifying realism and valor. Plenty of blood and dirt for everyone. The acting is occasionally stilted, but the characters are wonderful, especially Peter Strauss as a skeptical La Hire and Chad Willett as steadfast Jean de Metz. Peter O'Toole is his tormented best as Bishop Cauchon, who wavers between fearsome Inquisitor and confused man fearful of losing his soul. Powers Boothe is both tough and tender as Joan's controlling father. A terrific costuming department renders the rough-hewn quality of 14th century armor.This film doesn't take too many liberties with Joan's story, unlike the execrable ""The Messenger"".

One was a big budget motion picture titled ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" which starred singer/actress Milla Jovovich. The other was a simple made for TV movie called ""Joan of Arc"" starring Leelee Sobieski. Hollywood's sudden renewed interest in the character of Joan was basically an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the TV series XENA (about a warrior princess).The film ""The Messenger"" took the ""warrior princess"" approach, concentrating on action over substance. The finished product actually displayed none of the qualities that made Xena a hit TV show and played like a low-grade ""Braveheart meets Conan meets Red Sonja"". Simply put, it's a horrible film.The writers and producers of the made for TV movie ""Joan of Arc"" decided to take the high road. Instead of churning out just another throw-away ""action flick"", they assembled an incredible cast and then backed them up with an amazing script. The result is perhaps the best film version of the ""Joan of Arc"" story and a movie that anyone can enjoy regardless of religious beliefs.Leelee Sobieski is perfect as Joan, I cannot imagine anyone bringing more to this role than she does. Peter Strauss proves once again that he's a very underated actor. Peter O'Toole delivers an incredible performance, certainly one of his all time best! Shirley MaClaine, Maximillian Schell, and yes, even Neil Patrick Harris deliver fine performances!The last half hour of this film will have you riveted to the screen.

LeeLee Sobieski was the best and most believable Joan I have ever seen. LeeLee brings the human-side of the equation into the young warrior/martyr. Also, it is refreshing to actually have a very young woman played by a young actress. In fact, the whole cast, screenplay, settings, etc were so realistic. In Joan's death scene, LeeLee was the only Joan of Arc who made me cry so deeply. Others have only made me shed a tear or two. But LeeLee, as Joan, showed true fear; crying out for God and Jesus. Her close friend, who helped Joan begin her quest and fought with her in from the very beginning, held a crucifix ""at the level of [her] eyes"", and tried to give her a chance and hope of rescue. Instead, he witnessed her death. The cast is truly amazing. Not only were there semi-known and well-known actors, but also high-profile actors, such as Peter O'Toole, Maximillian Schell, Shirley Maclean. I saw this version of Joan of Arc on televison as a mini-series (and recorded it), as well as bought the VHS tape version (abridged).If it is at all possible, try to look for the complete version of this epic.

From the time she is a child, Joan hears voices and sees things.  She doesn't know that she alone is seeing these things until she seeks advice from her priest.  When her village is distroyed by invading English armies, she has a new resolve in her strange voices and visions.  She has been ordered by God to go to the French court, appeal to the prince of France, and lead the French army to victory over the English.  Without looking back, Joan leaves home.While she is ernest in her wants, there are other powers at work.  How could a simple peasent girl hold these powers over others, especially the soon to be king of France?  When Joan meets the Daulphaine, played by Neil Patrick Harris, she presents him proof.  Only Joan and the Daulphaine know what really happened when they retreated to the other room, but Joan is given her army.  In perhaps a fluke or a true divine act, Joan leads the army into victory over the English, the Daulphaine Charles is crowned, and France's joy is restored.What this movie does as opposed to The Messenger version is deliver both factual information as well as outlining the quick turn of the church and the crown against her, rather than take an artistic turn (although equally as effective).  When Joan's army failed the second time and she began to loose favor in the court and with the church, she was documented as getting before her knees at alters and statues of the saints that she heard.  She begged and cried before them ""Why won't you answer me?! I've done what you asked!!"".  When brought before the councils, she speaks of seeing her visions of the saints.  Saint Michael, for example, she says, wears a crown with six points on his head.  Other established visions of said Saint Michael, have him as wearing a six point crown.  Also, while Joan is confined to her prison, in the Messenger version, Joan is confronted only with her own doubts (in the form of Dustin Hoffman).  Joan was almost certainly raped, as this version shows us.Perhaps in no other version is Joan's burning at the stake captured so well as it was with Leelee.  She burns, and would be cannonized as a saint hundreds of years later.

468283,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305535582,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","Early in the 15th Century, Burgundy and England fought for control of a divided France, while Charles, the dauphin and rightful heir to the throne, hadn't enough power nor the backing to make his ascendancy.  But it had long been prophesied that a maid from Lorraine would rise up to unite France and make the country whole; and in 1429 that prophecy came to pass, when a young woman from the farming country in the north made her way to Charles and convinced him that she was on a mission from God.  Her name was Joan D'Arc; and this is her story.  ""Joan of Arc,"" directed by Christian Duguay, stars Leelee Sobieski as Joan, who-- seventeen-years-old at the time-- through Divine guidance managed to lead an army to victory after victory, and within months was instrumental in placing Charles upon the throne, as King of France.When Joan was ten, she first heard the ""voices"" that would ultimately lead her to her destiny.  It was the voice of her patron saint, Catherine; and by the age of seventeen, having been guided by others, including Saint Michael, she was in the court of Charles (Neil Patrick Harris).  How she was able to do what she did still seems inexplicable; and yet it is a matter of recorded history that this maid, Joan D'Arc, did indeed lead the armies of France and helped unite the country.  That she was betrayed by Charles and burned at the stake for heresy when she was nineteen is also well documented, as is the fact that seven years after her death France at last became a whole country, united-- as she had predicted.  And Charles went on to reign for another thirty years.Originally made for TV as a miniseries, this film nevertheless is as good, or actually even better, than many projects that find their way into theatrical release.  Well written (by Michael Alexander Miller and Ronald Parker) and directed by Duguay, it presents Joan as a very real person, struggling herself to realize where she fits into the grand scheme of things.  Duguay successfully avoids lapsing into any melodrama, and instead delivers a solid drama that is realistic and absorbing.  But the real strength of the film is clearly Sobieski, who was herself seventeen when this movie was filmed.Sobieski, with a maturity beyond her years, keeps Joan grounded with a portrayal that is not only credible, but which makes her extremely accessible to the audience; one with whom you can easily empathize.  Her Joan is strong, yet vulnerable, and Sobieski's ability to capture the complexities of the character is what makes her so good, and makes her Joan so believable.  There is an innocence about her that, along with her maturity conveys an attitude as well as attributes that the real Joan of Arc conceivably would have had.  And Sobieski embodies it all with her engaging, powerful performance, which is arguably the best portrayal of Joan ever brought to the screen, and for which she deservedly received an Emmy nomination.The supporting cast includes Jacqueline Bisset (Isabelle), Powers Boothe (Jacques D'Arc), Maury Chaykin (Sir Robert de Baudricourt), Olympia Dukakis (Mother Babette), Jonathan Hyde (Duke of Bedford), Robert Loggia (Father Monet), Shirley MacLaine (Madame de Beaurevoir), Peter O'Toole (Bishop Cauchon), Maximilian Schell (Brother John Le'Maitre), Peter Strauss (La Hire) and Chad Willett (Jean de Metz).  A lavish and emotionally involving presentation of the life of this remarkable young woman driven by Divine providence to carry out a singular mission, ""Joan of Arc"" is an inspirational meditation on the many and varied manifestations of destiny, and those who in rare instances are motivated by forces clearly beyond the comprehension of mortal man.

468284,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,6305535582,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[19, 23]","This 1999 TV-movie (frequently abridged; be sure to get the full-length 140-minute DVD or double-VHS tape set)has its moments and looks positively brilliant compared to Milla's ""The MESSenger,"" but on the whole tastes like an open can of house-brand soda left out all night -- flat, tinny, and full of artificial ingredients.The screenplay takes excessive historical liberties and is generally underdeveloped and a tad unfocused.  The direction is colorless and seems rushed,  the battle scenes in particular looking confused, unrealistic, and cliched.  (Can we PLEASE declare a moratorium on slow-motion combat photography and people screaming ""NOOOOOOooooOOO!!!"")  There is little passion in the ebb and flow of the story arc and attention tends to wander, even in the shortened version.It is regrettable that Joan's heavily fictionalized conflicts with her father are given so much screentime at the expense of genuine historical events.  (I suspect the producers were aiming for a ""Domremy 90210"" vibe to bring in the teen set.)  The siege of Orleans is over almost before it begins.  We see very little of Joan the war leader, and this is a great shame, seeing as how this was the crux of her mission.  It is hard to imagine what a raw newcomer to Joan's life must think after seeing this production, because a complete portrait was never revealed, only glimpses.  This isn't Leelee Sobieski's fault entirely, although her performance was perhaps a bit underplayed and monotonal.  I am more inclined to blame the director and script, neither of which gave her much to work with beyond lazy melodrama.  Sobieski brings a youthfulness to the role that is refreshing and convincing, and she makes an appealing and sympathetic Jeanne.  I appreciate her vulnerability, but she doesn't display enough steel, compared to the Joan of history, who could be very impetuous and willful.  Why is Joan so reluctant to be seen as the ""maid of Lorraine""?  This is contrary to her own sense of mission as received from her Voices.  The film seems to use them as some sort of magic power -- few other characters demonstrate much religious feeling or motivation, certainly not enough for a film in this setting.Some of the more specific historical quibbles: the real Joan had a fairly well-defined set of supporting characters, but we don't see much of them in this film. Joan's squire and page are dropped in favor of Olympia Dukakis' nun sidekick, which is fairly silly. The hard-bitten captain La Hire, mysteriously tamed by the 17-year old peasant girl, is the only notable French commander we see, and he is a blank rather than the wily, foul-mouthed Gascon veteran he really was. The Dauphin is unconvincing (it would be hard to top Jose Ferrer's 1948 performance OR physical similarity).  Pierre Cauchon, the bishop of Beauvais  who presided over Joan's trial, did not enter her life until after her capture, and his role as a scheming court minister is inaccurate.  There has been a theory put forward in recent years that Joan was raped before her execution but this is far from proven, and its inclusion in the movie is gratuitously mean and manipulative. Finally, Joan was actually captured in battle beneath the walls of Compiegne (possible betrayed from within the city; the gates were shut against her).  She fought back hard and had to be dragged from her horse. Although she had a vision of her eventual capture, she did not court it, and she certainly did not sit in the middle of her troop and let her enemies swoop in and carry her off unresisting like a sack of hamburgers. I kept expecting her brother to call out after the Burgundians, ""Hey, do you want fries with that?""If you can't tell a simple and rousing tale like Joan of Arc's and retain your viewer's interest, you have failed Filmmaking 101. Stories don't come any more dramatic or pre-scripted. The rest is a simple matter of making the raw notes sing.

The performance of Leelee Sobieski is  great ; once again she demonstrates a real talent. Along with it, what I like most is the good depiction of the historical characters and their relationships; there is a great human touch in this movie. It focuses less on warfare and gore, and more on psychology and history (even though the depiction of the battle at Les Tourettes is highly realistic). Among others, the movie shows how France was built from a variety of different regions. The costumes, especially on the french side, are rich and beautiful. The story unfolds in a clear, logical way; the trap in Compiegne is clearly presented. The most interesting dialogue is the one between Joan and the King of France, when she tells him that he should save Compiegne, but he says he has no more budget for that and all his large cities are overrun by the plague. Finally, when the game was over, the English wanted Joan more than the French, got her, had her tried by the local clergymen and burnt. It is astounding to see that Joan never believed she would actually burn when placed on the pyre, because she tought that God would protect her. So there is a terrible and very moving scene when one of the clerymen burns her hand a little to show her what will really happen to her. To summarize it up : it is a superb movie for historians, however I did not give it a 5-star, because the story is a sad one, and the movie would have benefitted from a little bit more glamour sometimes.",4,A great movie to understand what happened,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,1551,"['very', 'good', 'historical', 'movie', 'sad', 'story', 'martyr', 'performance', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'great', 'once', 'again', 'real', 'talent', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'good', 'depiction', 'historical', 'characters', 'relationships', 'great', 'human', 'touch', 'movie', 'less', 'warfare', 'gore', 'more', 'psychology', 'history', 'even', 'depiction', 'battle', 'Les', 'Tourettes', 'highly', 'realistic', 'others', 'movie', 'how', 'France', 'was', 'built', 'variety', 'different', 'regions', 'costumes', 'especially', 'french', 'side', 'are', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'story', 'unfolds', 'clear', 'logical', 'way', 'trap', 'Compiegne', 'clearly', 'presented', 'most', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'one', 'Joan', 'King', 'France', 'when', 'should', 'save', 'Compiegne', 'more', 'budget', 'large', 'cities', 'are', 'overrun', 'plague', 'Finally', 'when', 'game', 'was', 'over', 'English', 'wanted', 'Joan', 'more', 'French', 'got', 'had', 'tried', 'local', 'clergymen', 'burnt', 'astounding', 'see', 'Joan', 'never', 'believed', 'would', 'actually', 'burn', 'when', 'placed', 'pyre', 'tought', 'God', 'would', 'protect', 'terrible', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'clerymen', 'hand', 'little', 'show', 'what', 'will', 'really', 'happen', 'summarize', 'up', 'superb', 'movie', 'historians', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'give', '5-star', 'story', 'sad', 'one', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'glamour', 'sometimes']",N/A

When you get a TV movie that is this spectacular, visually lush, brilliantly acted and emotionally gripping, historical accuracy is the last thing  you'll complain about.Rarely does a TV movie come along that is as well  conceived as its mega budget says it should be. Absolutely stunning battle  scenes (especially for a TV production), rich location shooting and a  superb cast make Joan of Arc unquestionably one of the best TV movies ever  made.But what crowns Joan of Arc as a ""5 star"" production is it's  outstanding lead, Leelee Sobieski. Perfectly cast, Sobieski brings  qualities to the French saint never seen before - an innocent, yet strong  and commanding personality, a ""virginial"" presence, a face resembling  something of a saint/angel/renaissance painting plus not to mention that  she was ""actually"" the right age to play the legendary teenage warrior.  Sobieski's performance is so exceptional, she holds the entire 4 hours  together, and at the same time, leaves other Joan of Arc interpretations by  the likes of Ingrid Bergman and Milla Jovavich in her wake.Definitely  the best TV movie I've ever, and a far better bet than Luc Besson's/Milla  Jovavich's version...",5,Leelee Sobieski - the French connection,952128000,"03 4, 2000",2000,1258,"['terms', 'historical', 'value', 'not', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'who', 'cares', 'When', 'get', 'TV', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'visually', 'lush', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'last', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'complain', 'about.Rarely', 'TV', 'movie', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'conceived', 'mega', 'budget', 'should', 'be', 'Absolutely', 'stunning', 'battle', 'scenes', 'especially', 'TV', 'production', 'rich', 'location', 'shooting', 'superb', 'cast', 'make', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.But', 'what', 'crowns', 'Joan', 'Arc', '5', 'star', 'production', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Perfectly', 'cast', 'Sobieski', 'qualities', 'French', 'saint', 'never', 'seen', 'innocent', 'strong', 'commanding', 'personality', 'virginial', 'presence', 'face', 'resembling', 'something', 'saint/angel/renaissance', 'painting', 'not', 'mention', 'was', 'actually', 'right', 'age', 'play', 'legendary', 'teenage', 'warrior', 'Sobieski', 'performance', 'so', 'exceptional', 'entire', '4', 'hours', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'interpretations', 'likes', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Milla', 'Jovavich', 'wake.Definitely', 'best', 'TV', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'far', 'better', 'bet', 'Luc', ""Besson's/Milla"", 'Jovavich', 'version']",N/A
