1346246,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003IG06PM,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","THE MATTHEW SHEPARD STORY is a made for television movie made in 2002 and only recently released on DVD.  It is time for us all to see this film again as a reminder of how heinous was this incident that rocked the world. Matthew Shepard (December 1, 1976 - October 12, 1998) as a student at the University of Wyoming who was tortured and beaten and left o die on a barbed wire fence in the prairie of Wyoming - because he was gay. Writers John Wierick and Jacob Krueger gathered the information surrounding this event and the subsequent events following his death, focusing on the trial and the difficult gesture his parents made concerning the fate of the murderers.Roger Spottiswoode directed this compelling film, electing to engage the talents of Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston as the parents of Matthew (played with great dignity by Shane Meier).  The remainder of the cast includes such touching portraits of the others involved in this tragedy as played by Tani Gellman, Wendy Crewson and Kristen Thompson.  While the drama of this film is not in the same arena as 'The Laramie Project', it still is a potent reminder of an unnecessary injustice that unfortunately is still being played out across the country.

1346248,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B003IG06PM,Hulka,"[24, 53]","This story is simple minded...it's all about homophobia and cruel dumb rural folk. So simple right? However, the REAL MS story is a lot more nuanced and complicated.According to November 1998 Advocate, MS was attending a meeting of the University of Wyoming GLTB Alliance prior to going to the straight bar where he hooked up with a pair of sinister straight men. Two questionable straight men that MS voluntarily got into a truck with and drove away to his death. According to the Advocate, everyone at the GLBT Alliance meeting begged him NOT to go to a bar alone. But nobody was willing to change their plans and him either. Everyone knew that MS had a history of very questionable interactions with straight men. So why would an otherwise intelligent young man get in a truck with a pair of ruffians anyway? Why was he constantly doing things like that? Was there no connection with this murder and his family and friends?Of course there is no excuse for MS's killers---or anyone to murder someone for his sexual orientation? But what about taking responsibility for yourself? And your family? But was this really just a hate crime? Or a robbery? There was no hate crime law in Wyoming.There were many questions that this movie should have asked. For instance, was there a connection between MS's reckless behavior and his own internalized self-hatred. What was the influence of his own parents' homophobia and lack of understanding? And maybe some of the blame lies with the GLBT friends as well who should have recognized this all too common connection between self-hatred and reckless behavior among young gay men? What were his parents doing sending their very gay son to the University of Wyoming anyway? Was there NO responsibility here for his parents or his friends?It was sickening to see how his parents were embraced by the GLBT organizations, after their negative and non-supportive reaction to their son's homosexuality, which caused Matthew to stop talking to them about his personal life. And seeking a gag-order prohibiting MS's murderers from speaking to journalists after their conviction?No, this is NOT the real MS story, this is a piece of politically correct fact-picking by the very family and community that refuse to acknowledge their own role in the death of this beautiful but unhappy young man.",2,The REAL Matthew Shepard story a little more complicated....,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2326,"['story', 'simple', 'minded', 'homophobia', 'cruel', 'dumb', 'rural', 'folk', 'So', 'simple', 'right', 'However', 'REAL', 'MS', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'nuanced', 'complicated.According', 'November', '1998', 'Advocate', 'MS', 'was', 'attending', 'meeting', 'University', 'Wyoming', 'GLTB', 'Alliance', 'prior', 'going', 'straight', 'bar', 'where', 'hooked', 'up', 'pair', 'sinister', 'straight', 'men', 'Two', 'questionable', 'straight', 'men', 'MS', 'voluntarily', 'got', 'truck', 'drove', 'away', 'death', 'According', 'Advocate', 'everyone', 'GLBT', 'Alliance', 'meeting', 'begged', 'NOT', 'go', 'bar', 'alone', 'nobody', 'was', 'willing', 'change', 'plans', 'either', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'MS', 'had', 'history', 'very', 'questionable', 'interactions', 'straight', 'men', 'why', 'would', 'otherwise', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'get', 'truck', 'pair', 'ruffians', 'anyway', 'Why', 'was', 'constantly', 'doing', 'things', 'Was', 'connection', 'murder', 'family', 'friends', 'course', 'excuse', 'MS', 'killers', '-or', 'anyone', 'murder', 'someone', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'what', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'family', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'hate', 'crime', 'robbery', 'was', 'hate', 'crime', 'law', 'Wyoming.There', 'were', 'many', 'questions', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'asked', 'instance', 'was', 'connection', 'MS', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'own', 'internalized', 'self-hatred', 'What', 'was', 'influence', 'own', 'parents', 'homophobia', 'lack', 'understanding', 'maybe', 'blame', 'GLBT', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'recognized', 'too', 'common', 'connection', 'self-hatred', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'young', 'gay', 'men', 'What', 'were', 'parents', 'doing', 'sending', 'very', 'gay', 'son', 'University', 'Wyoming', 'anyway', 'Was', 'NO', 'responsibility', 'here', 'parents', 'friends', 'was', 'sickening', 'see', 'how', 'parents', 'were', 'embraced', 'GLBT', 'organizations', 'negative', 'non-supportive', 'reaction', 'son', 'homosexuality', 'caused', 'Matthew', 'stop', 'talking', 'personal', 'life', 'seeking', 'gag-order', 'prohibiting', 'MS', 'murderers', 'speaking', 'journalists', 'conviction', 'No', 'NOT', 'real', 'MS', 'story', 'piece', 'politically', 'correct', 'fact-picking', 'very', 'family', 'community', 'refuse', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'role', 'death', 'beautiful', 'unhappy', 'young', 'man']",N/A
1346249,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003IG06PM,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","This is a short film about a young man who was the victim of some homophobic hatred. No matter what the circumstances could have been, no matter what the condition, language or behavior everyone could have demonstrated, killing someone just because he is different is simply absurd. And I say any difference cannot justify killing him, her or them illegally or legally. All act of lethal violence against any one has no justification at all.But in this film, in this case the emphasis is not so much set on the son who finds out he is gay in high school, probably when he went to his first homecoming dance with a girl he could not cope with, but about his parents who had accepted this fact, about the parents after his death, after the first part of the trial that convicted the killer, a young man like Matthew, of the crime, and before the second part of the trial when the jury is going to decide on the sentence. The death penalty is sure but a plea can always be accepted by the parents.The question is what can the parents do? What would Matthew tell them to do? Will he require the death penalty or will he request mercy for his killer? If Matthew was a beautiful person;, an intelligent person, a gracious person, he must have known violence leads to violence and some one some time must stop the hate machine and say: ""Okay, you killed me. Okay you meant to kill me and you abandoned me in a place where I took two days to bleed to death, to die, before my body was discovered. Okay you intended to kill and to torture. But you did all that from a crooked belief that people who are different have to be gotten rid of and that did not come from you, and anyway I cannot find closure and peace in your death. I can only find closure and peace in forgiving you and hoping you will forgive yourself.I regret a little the father decided to follow another line in front of the court and to accept to show mercy and take the plea from the defense but for the wrong reason, so that the killer may suffer remembering his crime all along his long life. It does not even matter whether the murderer does or not. What matters is what the world can remember from Matthew, the message he can transmit to us from beyond his grave, from beyond his torturing chamber, from beyond the long agony and suffering ending in death.

I cried inside while watching it but I thought it was amazingly well done.  Superlative acting.  I like especially how strong Stockard Channing is - she never crosses the borderline into hysteria.  Sam Waterston is at his usual best.  Shane Meier is not that well-known but he should be, he's a very good actor. I was a bit apprehensive about buying this for some reason but not being one to judge books by covers, I did it and am really, really glad I did.  Shane plays Matthew as a really straight gay guy and I think that worked well.  The scenes with Matthew and Pablo are great - a love scene woulda been cool but maybe it wasn't so integral to the plot?  I really liked the lesbian chick who became friends with Matthew, who was played by a very good actress who wasn't too butch. Hopefully the world has become a bit better off because of this film and because of the Matthew Shepard Story and the Foundation in his name.  I wish it didn't take death to instigate and motivate change.  The passage of a few more generations is all it will take, I hope and pray.

I have so much compassion for him and his family although I'm not sure I could've been as merciful towards the bigoted killers. Listen to what Dennis/Sam Waterston says at his closing statement concerning the plea bargain, that shows how I feel about the case.I was also impressed with how Stockard Channing played Judy, she was very convincing and compassionate, and I commended Shane Meier for his portrayal of Matthew.The beating, and the scenes with that stupid hate-monger of a preacher and his clan of bigots make me furious even now. To this day, being almost 30 years old, I can't understand why we have to tolerate homophobia. That bonehead Rev. Phelps and his team need to be shut down before they get someone killed, or indirectly cause more gay suicides.Freedom of speech is important, but what happened to respect for the dead? Hollywood is coming around, but society is dragging its feet, although I've been openly accepted by most of my friends/family in my home town.Matthew, I think would be impressed with how much his legacy has changed close-minded people, unless of course you're Fred Phelps or one of his ilk. I commend Judy Shepard for what she's trying to do as well.I've said it before, and here it comes again-why did it take a young innocent boy being slaugthered to make close-minded people realize that homophobia is just as wrong as being racist? Weird analogy, I know, but to me, prejudice is hatred no matter how you swing it.

The two who played his parents are among my favorite actors, and they did a magnificent job with the movie.  I had never heard of Shane Meier, but he does an excellent job too.  It was a very sad time in American history that they are depicting here, and hopefully the country has moved on past this sort of thing, although gay-bashing does still happen in some areas.  Psychologists are virtually unanimous in stating that most gay-bashers are doing it because they have the tendency to be gay and are resentful of those who actively pursue their sexuality openly.  I have no doubt that the assailants were of that variety, but there are also many sick people in our society who revel in hurting people just for the sick pleasure of hurting people.It seems obvious to me that Matthew Shepard was an idealist, not a realist, and he felt that the world should be the way he wanted it to be, and wouldn't face the fact that life isn't always the way we want it to be.  He was a &#34;performer&#34; as one of my friends puts it, and very bad at judging situations.  I feel that he was asking for trouble in Morocco and it wasn't surprising that he got it.  When you go to a foreign country, you have to take into account the mores and values of that society.  When you openly flaunt things which they don't like bad things can happen to you.  In Wyoming, he was foolish enough to get into a car with people he didn't know, and that alone tells me that his judgement was faulty.  Most parents tell their children not to get into a car with strangers and I have no doubt that Matthew Shepard's parents did that too.It doesn't pay to take risks that are unwarranted.
