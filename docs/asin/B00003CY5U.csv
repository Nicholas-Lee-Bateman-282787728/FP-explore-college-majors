As a parent I often have to suffer through books my children read to me, music they like, and television shows & movies that I have no desire to see. The previews made this movie look like the standard Disney channel fluff I occasionally have to endure. However, I found that I actually enjoyed this movie.Garry Marshall basically redressed his PRETTY WOMAN storyline for kids. He even brought in Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager in PW, as the head security officer for the Queen of Genovia, who is played by Julie Andrews. The story also has aspects of the LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY novel in it.The story is not all that original. A long lost heir to the throne of Genovia has been identified as a klutzy teenager who lives in San Francisco. The Queen of Genovia goes to San Francisco and attempts to persuade her to come back to Genovia and take her place as a princess of the realm. From there the typical hijinks ensue. The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax.  Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock, who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years.The story is predictable and hold no real surprises. Despite this I still found myself enjoying the film. Julie Andrews did well in her role as the Queen and it was a treat to see her in another Disney film. I was surprised by how well Anne Hathaway did in her role as Princess Mia. She held her own against such performers as Andrews and Elizondo. This movie could have come off as cheezy but thanks to the director and skilled actors it proved to be a real treat. I remember back in 1990 when PW came out that girls thought it was so romantic that a hooker could find romance, true love and wealth. In my opinion PD is a much better role model. I'd rather have my little girl wishing she that she was heir to throne than a hooker who happens to find true love.Anyway, thanks to my daughter I discovered a film that I really enjoyed It is also because of her that I just saw the sequel, PD-2. It was even better than PD.",4,An unexpected pleasure!,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",2004,2236,"['When', 'was', '32', 'years', 'old', 'back', '2001', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'took', 'then', '7', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'see', 'move', 'parent', 'often', 'have', 'suffer', 'books', 'children', 'read', 'music', 'like', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'previews', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'standard', 'Disney', 'channel', 'fluff', 'occasionally', 'have', 'endure', 'However', 'found', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie.Garry', 'Marshall', 'basically', 'redressed', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'storyline', 'kids', 'even', 'brought', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'hotel', 'manager', 'PW', 'head', 'security', 'officer', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'who', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'story', 'also', 'aspects', 'LITTLE', 'LORD', 'FAUNTLEROY', 'novel', 'it.The', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'long', 'lost', 'heir', 'throne', 'Genovia', 'been', 'identified', 'klutzy', 'teenager', 'who', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'San', 'Francisco', 'attempts', 'persuade', 'come', 'back', 'Genovia', 'take', 'place', 'princess', 'realm', 'typical', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'princess', 'education', 'proper', 'royal', 'behavior', 'procedures', 'Queen', 'loosen', 'up', 'relax', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'also', 'dating', 'school', 'jock', 'who', 'ignored', 'became', 'famous', 'dating', 'unpopular', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'friend', 'years.The', 'story', 'predictable', 'hold', 'real', 'surprises', 'still', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'did', 'well', 'role', 'Queen', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'Disney', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'did', 'role', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'held', 'own', 'such', 'performers', 'Andrews', 'Elizondo', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'cheezy', 'thanks', 'director', 'skilled', 'actors', 'proved', 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'remember', 'back', '1990', 'when', 'PW', 'came', 'out', 'girls', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'romantic', 'hooker', 'could', 'find', 'romance', 'true', 'love', 'wealth', 'opinion', 'PD', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'model', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'wishing', 'was', 'heir', 'throne', 'hooker', 'who', 'find', 'true', 'love.Anyway', 'thanks', 'daughter', 'discovered', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'just', 'saw', 'sequel', 'PD-2', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'PD']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

However, this is not to say that it barely follows the book. The only things that are in the movie that are like the book, are the fact that Mia acquires princess lessons, goes out with Josh to the dance, finds out she's a princess, Mia's mother dates one of her teachers, Lilly yells at her when she sees her hair, and a few other things.In the movie, when Lilly sees that her friend is turning to someone similar to Lana, she becomes angry. In the book, she ignores her for quite a large bit of the story. In The movie gives the impression that Mia's grandmother is a loving woman but they have not spoken in fifteen years. In the novel, Mia does speak to her grandmother but never was able to figure out that she was a princess (in the book grandmother is a princess, not a queen) of Genovia herself. In addition, Mia's grandmother is not the nicest of people. Furthermore, the Prince of Genovia, Mia's father is still alive.

543206,A3MFGOKZO3CH63,B00003CY5U,Andrea Gidusko,"[2, 2]","As a fan of Garry Marshall for many years, I see every one of his films for two reasons.1. I know I'll love it (Exit To Eden is the one exception)2. To find the ""Garry Clan"" the various people who have been in almost every single Garry movie.Now this movie had a third reason, Anne Hathaway. I discovered Anne on the short lived TV Series ""Get Real"" where she played the genius, but rebellious Meghan Green on the only television show I have really ever seen that portrayed your REAL typical American family. I knew from that moment Anne would be a star, and it took a movie like this to make it happen.I typically don't like movies where someone with glasses is considered a dork, nerd, geek, everything that makes someone as unpopular as one can possibly be; but this movie shows what you can become if you believe in yourself, not just believe in what you see in the mirror. Yes, Mia goes from a frizzy haired bespectacled girl to a beautiful young woman, but this movie goes beyond the exterior which is what I know will happen in any and all Garry Marshall movies.The basic premise is, an unpopular fifteen year old girl is paid an unexpected visit by her paternal grandmother and discovers her late father was the prince of a small country, which makes her a princess and she has to make the personal choice on whether to continue her life in San Francisco or movie to Genovia and rule the country. While mulling this over, she is given a personal makeover on the outside, but never changes the sweet person she is on the inside.You have your typical popular cheerleader, played by Mandy Moore and the best friend, played by Heather Matarazzo. Both characters are essential to the plot and effect how Mia (Anne Hathaway) feels about herself and the overall decision she makes when it comes to the rest of her life.I don't want to say anything that would give the movie away, but this is not your typical teenage movie. The film is rated G, and there is really no language whatsoever and any fan of Pretty Woman will recognize not only people (Hector Elizondo, Patrick Richwood, Alan Kent; if you watch the commentary on the DVD Garry will explain to you whom all these people are if you're nor obsessive like myself and already know) but familiar scenes that are take offs from Pretty Woman, and the familiar undertone of the film itself: it's simply a fairytale, and we should all believe in fairytales once in awhile.",5,Miracles Happen,1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,2425,"['fan', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'many', 'years', 'see', 'one', 'films', 'two', 'reasons.1', 'know', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Exit', 'Eden', 'one', 'exception', '2', 'find', 'Garry', 'Clan', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'single', 'Garry', 'movie.Now', 'movie', 'had', 'third', 'reason', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'discovered', 'Anne', 'short', 'lived', 'TV', 'Series', 'Get', 'Real', 'where', 'played', 'genius', 'rebellious', 'Meghan', 'Green', 'only', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'really', 'ever', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'REAL', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'knew', 'moment', 'Anne', 'would', 'be', 'star', 'took', 'movie', 'make', 'happen.I', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'someone', 'glasses', 'considered', 'dork', 'nerd', 'geek', 'everything', 'someone', 'as', 'unpopular', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'become', 'believe', 'not', 'just', 'believe', 'what', 'see', 'mirror', 'Yes', 'Mia', 'frizzy', 'haired', 'bespectacled', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'movie', 'exterior', 'what', 'know', 'will', 'happen', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'movies.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'unpopular', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'paid', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'late', 'father', 'was', 'prince', 'small', 'country', 'princess', 'make', 'personal', 'choice', 'continue', 'life', 'San', 'Francisco', 'movie', 'Genovia', 'rule', 'country', 'mulling', 'over', 'given', 'personal', 'makeover', 'outside', 'never', 'sweet', 'person', 'inside.You', 'have', 'typical', 'popular', 'cheerleader', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'characters', 'are', 'essential', 'plot', 'effect', 'how', 'Mia', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'overall', 'decision', 'when', 'rest', 'life.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'anything', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'away', 'not', 'typical', 'teenage', 'movie', 'film', 'rated', 'G', 'really', 'language', 'whatsoever', 'fan', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'will', 'recognize', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Patrick', 'Richwood', 'Alan', 'Kent', 'watch', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'Garry', 'will', 'explain', 'whom', 'people', 'are', ""'re"", 'obsessive', 'already', 'know', 'familiar', 'scenes', 'are', 'take', 'offs', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'familiar', 'undertone', 'film', 'simply', 'fairytale', 'should', 'believe', 'fairytales', 'once', 'awhile']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

My love for Anne Hathaway actually started with this very movie, a conventional yet highly entertaining (and adorable) little film about a gawky young girl who becomes a princess.And what gawky young girl doesn't dream of one day doing that!The film tells of Mia, a brace-faced, frizz-haired, four-eyed bookworm who is constantly teased and feels out of place.  She has become strangely content with her lot in life, yet is anyone really every truly content?  She has more or less become conditioned to be the outcast, but all of that is about to change when her grandmother shows up out of the blue to inform her that she is the princess of Genovia.  Now, this fish out of water is about to don the crown and become something she never imagined possible.But first she has to clean up a bit.Anne Hathaway has such natural charm that it just exudes confidence, even when she's playing the highly unconfident.  She delivers each line with so much warmth and genuineness that we are endeared to her almost instantly.  There is a wholesome quality to her (and she even carries this when delivering some raunchier and weightier roles as well) that makes her feel real and approachable.  You just can't help but adore her (and she is mighty fine to look at too).Oh yeah, and I LOVE me some Julie Andrews, so this was a total PLUS.The film is entertaining, funny, charming and memorable; a real treat for the entire family.

It is also quite sweet and charming, but that tends in my opinion to be its downfall rather than a strength.  The books are engaging and laugh-out-loud funny, whereas the story here is drastically altered and toned down, so most of the laughs are no longer there.  Anne Hathaway is very pretty and appealing as leading lady Mia Thermopolis, but her performance is sort of bland.  Julie Andrews is far sweeter as her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, than the deliciously evil character of ""Grandm&eacute;re"" depicted in the Princess Diaries books.  These weaknesses are somewhat compensated for by the addition of two great original characters: Joe (Hector Elizondo), who drives Princess Mia's royal limousine, and Mia's eccentric neighbor Mr. Robitussin.  Also fun to watch is Paolo, Mia's royal hairdresser, who always refers to himself in the third person.

It was actually just a light-hearted little comedy, the Princess who doesn't know she is. Julie Andrews makes a good queen for the role, and Anne Hathaway is pretty good girl-turned-Princess too.Actually, this movie didn't gain such high marks from me until my sister received the books of the same title at Christmas of the next year. WELL! I happened to pick `em up during the confusion of Christmas morning, and my goodness. My opinion of Gary Marshall skyrocketed when I discovered that the books were filled with lots of cursing, tons of sexual references/discussions, and overall, a much more depressing story. (In that Mia was much more of a jerk, her friends jerks, her grandmother was a jerk, and her whole life was one big dysfunctional wreck)I remember hearing Gary Marshall comment about how he'd wanted to make the movie more happy because, contrary to Hollywood's opinion, not EVERY teenager's life is filled with drugs, booze and darkness. Cheers to him for giving it a squeaky-clean makeover; it makes me want to go out and look up more of his works.It's, I suppose, what a lot of people would call a ""chick flick"" or a ""date movie"", but in either case, even though I'm a guy, I thought it was a nice, happy, CLEAN movie.",4,"I'm a guy, and still thought it was okay!",1046131200,"02 25, 2003",2003,1356,"['Princess', 'Diaries', 'mostly', 'girl', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'sister', 'received', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'was', 'actually', 'just', 'light-hearted', 'little', 'comedy', 'Princess', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'good', 'queen', 'role', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'pretty', 'good', 'girl-turned-Princess', 'too.Actually', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'gain', 'such', 'high', 'marks', 'sister', 'received', 'books', 'same', 'title', 'Christmas', 'next', 'year', 'WELL', 'happened', 'pick', 'em', 'up', 'confusion', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'goodness', 'opinion', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'skyrocketed', 'when', 'discovered', 'books', 'were', 'filled', 'lots', 'cursing', 'tons', 'sexual', 'references/discussions', 'overall', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'story', 'Mia', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'jerk', 'friends', 'jerks', 'grandmother', 'was', 'jerk', 'whole', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'dysfunctional', 'wreck', 'remember', 'hearing', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'comment', 'how', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'happy', 'contrary', 'Hollywood', 'opinion', 'not', 'EVERY', 'teenager', 'life', 'filled', 'drugs', 'booze', 'darkness', 'Cheers', 'giving', 'squeaky-clean', 'makeover', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'look', 'up', 'more', 'works.It', 'suppose', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'call', 'chick', 'flick', 'date', 'movie', 'case', 'even', ""'m"", 'guy', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'happy', 'CLEAN', 'movie']",Disney's The Princess Diaries
543235,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,B00003CY5U,David Michael Cohen,"[9, 15]","I gave this movie 2 stars because my pre-teen daughters loved this movie, so it must have some appeal.  The appeal completely escaped me, however.  This movie is basically a re-make of ""Pretty Woman"" i.e. insecure female is given stuff and thus is empowered.  I have a hard time seeing any of this as ""uplifting"" ""inspirational"" or anything else critics called this movie.  For one thing, the main character does nothing to earn the power, prestige or material things she gets in this movie, they are handed to her because of an accident of birth.  This wouldn't be so bad if the main character exhibited some personal growth along the way.  Sadly, she does not.  The implication seems to be that she was always a vibrant, competent person, she just needed some encouragement to bring that out (oh yeah, and a make-over because as we all know people who look plain don't deserve any recognition).  If she had such great potential, however, why does it require the resources of a small country to bring it out?  When we wonder this, the movie throws in some predictable, old-hat slapstick ""comedy"" to make Mia more sympathetic (and bore the parents of the target audience). Or, perhaps we are to believe that now that she is a princess her awkwardness is endearing?  The bottom line is, Mia comes across as pathetic in the beginning of the film and stays that way to the end. The most offensive scene for me was when Mia's Grandmother exploits her royal station and convinces a none-too-bright police officer to excuse her from a fender bender.  Rather than show responsibility and accept the consequences of her actions, Mia calls her grandmother, ""The coolest queen ever.""  Previously, the movie had hinted that popular people shouldn't abuse people less popular than themselves, but then it tells us that using one's birth station to manipulate others and avoid responsibility like a spoiled brat is ""cool.""  What kind of message is that for kids?  Why are ""royal"" persons above consequences for their actions?  Isn't that why America fought a war to get rid of queens and such nonsense?  In conclusion I found very little to enjoy in this movie, and hope it does not signify a future trend in Disney's movies.",2,"Good for pre-teens, and those who think like them",1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,2212,"['gave', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'pre-teen', 'daughters', 'loved', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'appeal', 'appeal', 'completely', 'escaped', 'however', 'movie', 'basically', 're-make', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'i.e', 'insecure', 'female', 'given', 'stuff', 'thus', 'empowered', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'uplifting', 'inspirational', 'anything', 'else', 'critics', 'called', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'main', 'character', 'nothing', 'earn', 'power', 'prestige', 'material', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'handed', 'accident', 'birth', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'main', 'character', 'exhibited', 'personal', 'growth', 'way', 'Sadly', 'not', 'implication', 'be', 'was', 'always', 'vibrant', 'competent', 'person', 'just', 'needed', 'encouragement', 'bring', 'out', 'oh', 'yeah', 'make-over', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'plain', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'recognition', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'potential', 'however', 'why', 'require', 'resources', 'small', 'country', 'bring', 'out', 'When', 'wonder', 'movie', 'predictable', 'old-hat', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'make', 'Mia', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'bore', 'parents', 'target', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'are', 'believe', 'now', 'princess', 'awkwardness', 'endearing', 'bottom', 'line', 'Mia', 'pathetic', 'beginning', 'film', 'stays', 'way', 'end', 'most', 'offensive', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Mia', 'Grandmother', 'royal', 'station', 'none-too-bright', 'police', 'officer', 'excuse', 'fender', 'bender', 'Rather', 'show', 'responsibility', 'accept', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Mia', 'grandmother', 'coolest', 'queen', 'ever', 'Previously', 'movie', 'had', 'hinted', 'popular', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'abuse', 'people', 'less', 'popular', 'then', 'using', 'one', 'birth', 'station', 'manipulate', 'others', 'avoid', 'responsibility', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'cool', 'What', 'kind', 'message', 'kids', 'Why', 'are', 'royal', 'persons', 'consequences', 'actions', ""n't"", 'why', 'America', 'fought', 'war', 'get', 'rid', 'queens', 'such', 'nonsense', 'conclusion', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'hope', 'not', 'signify', 'future', 'trend', 'Disney', 'movies']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

543238,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00003CY5U,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Pretty Anne Hathaway, who, interestingly enough, has the same name as Shakespeare's wife, plays the lead character in a modern fairy tale that the Bard himself might have found amusing.Hathaway's Mia Thermopolis is a gawky teen living with her artist mother (gently and generously portrayed by Caroline Goodall) in San Francisco (whereas, in Meg Cabot's book, her home was New York). She attends a private school via the financial support of her father, who had passed away shortly before the story begins, has a best friend involved in social activism, (played by a loud and cynical Heather Matarazzo), a crush on a heartthrob who doesn't notice her, and a clique of annoying cheerleaders who constantly taunt her, led by pop singer, Mandy Moore.One day, a meeting with her grandmother changes her life, and Mia discovers that her father was the Crown Prince of Genovia. While reluctant to accept her heritage at first, Mia gradually warms to the idea. As the very regal Queen Clarice, Julie Andrews combines her two Broadway roles in ""Camelot"" and ""My Fair Lady"" as she begins the process of training the gawky Granddaughter she had never met before for the role she may one day have on the world stage. Scenes of Mia's Princess lessons are reminiscent of scenes in the film, ""Gigi"".The makeover scene is enjoyable to watch, as we see Mia turn from looking like Sarah Jessica Parker's character in ""Square Pegs"" to looking more like Queen Rania of Jordan. She is truly beautiful with her big, sparkling doe eyes and softened hair as she sees her outwardly polished self in the mirror.Her friend, Lilly, taunts her about her metamorphosis, while Lilly's brother, Michael, played by an adorably sweet Robert Schwartzman, admires it. After a few tumultuous and embarassing incidents, Mia must make a final decision about where she belongs, and is ultimately influenced by her best friend's opinion in so doing. Genovia may receive a new heiress, and the prospective Princess might be on her way to finding true love as well.All the while, it is the cool-headed Hector Elizondo's Joseph, the head of the Queen's security detail, who helps the young girl through her dilemma, providing sage advice, and helping to reconcile both grandmother and granddaughter after Mia generates some bad press.The books on which this film was based have a bit more of an edge and may be more cynical.

543240,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CY5U,D. Litton,"[2, 2]","Let's get a few things clear for those of you who have not yet seen &quot;The Princess Diaries...&quot; no, the movie is not one of the best pictures of the year; no, the movie is not Oscar material; no, the movie is not one of Disney's best. But is it funny? It can be. Does it have a good deal of charm as promised in its promotional campaign? Yes. Is it worth the time and money? I like to think so.&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is a basic, rags-to-riches Cinderella story given a modern makeover with some new and different characters, all uplifted by a cast and a director who seems to bring out the best the material has to offer. I'll be honest: movies like this are usually a hit-or-miss with me, and this latest addition was no exception to my skepticism. All-in-all, it's nothing too terribly special, and the comedy isn't as present as it could be, but it's not a total waste of time, and it can be a lot of fun.At the center of the story is misfit Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway), the classic klutz case who can't seem to get her act together, bumping into objects and people, becoming the center of attention in the worst possible way. Life is just one barrage of insults and mean-spirited jeers for her, so it makes little impact when her paternal grandmother decides to pay a visit to San Francisco with news of her succession to the throne of the country Genovia after the recent death of her father.At first, Mia becomes rebellious towards her grandmother, Queen of Genovia (Julie Andrews), and her mother, who she blames for keeping her royal stature a secret from her for all of her fifteen years. Then, of course, she starts getting more into the spirit of things, with a flashy new makeover to rid her of her bushman eyebrows and her frizzy hair. She soon rises to stardom as the people at school are eager to gain her attention and some small share of her fame.As with any teen-oriented movie, there are going to be setbacks that dot the fairy tale countryside: here, it centers on Mia's crush on a hunky jock who only sees her for her fame, and little else. Immediately smitten, she blows off the boy who really cares for her, as well as her friends, only to realize the trouble she has caused herself, leading us into the mandatory happy ending that Disney is always so masterful at achieving.It's nothing new, and the movie does have its shortcomings. The movie doesn't really have a great deals of comedy to it, and what laughs it does have are few and far between. There are some priceless lines of dialogue interspersed in the script: at one point, Mia's makeover artist refers to her eyebrows as &quot;Frida&quot; and &quot;Kalo,&quot; while the wonderful wit of her driver, Joseph (Hector Elizondo), is wonderful.And just as Elizondo hits a high note, so does much of the cast. Andrews is back in fine form, reprising much of the charm and charisma from her past roles and giving it all she's got here. Hathaway does a good enough job of playing the turn-around princess trying to make a splash, while Heather Matarazzo and Robert Schwartzman are equally well-cast as her two closest friends who see her through tough times. Teen idols Mandy Moore and Erik von Detten make appearances as two of Mia's tormentors, so it's no surprise that I found myself cheering her on when she exacts her revenge on each of them.When it's all over and done with, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; doesn't add much to the cuteness, but it doesn't give it a bad name, either. It's a pleasant enough diversion from reality that doesn't overstay its welcome, and continues to charm with its well-rounded cast of actors. If for nothing else, watch it for the chance to see Andrews make a wonderful comeback, and, of course, to see Mandy Moore get slopped with an ice cream cone... ahh, sweet revenge.",4,A charming diversion from reality.,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,3811,"['Let', 'get', 'few', 'things', 'clear', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'year', 'movie', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'funny', 'can', 'be', 'Does', 'have', 'good', 'deal', 'charm', 'promised', 'promotional', 'campaign', 'Yes', 'time', 'money', 'like', 'think', 'so.', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'basic', 'rags-to-riches', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'given', 'modern', 'makeover', 'new', 'different', 'characters', 'uplifted', 'cast', 'director', 'who', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'material', 'offer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'hit-or-miss', 'latest', 'addition', 'was', 'exception', 'skepticism', 'All-in-all', 'nothing', 'too', 'terribly', 'special', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'as', 'present', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun.At', 'center', 'story', 'misfit', 'Mia', 'Thermopolis', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'classic', 'klutz', 'case', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'bumping', 'objects', 'people', 'becoming', 'center', 'attention', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'Life', 'just', 'one', 'barrage', 'insults', 'mean-spirited', 'jeers', 'little', 'impact', 'when', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'decides', 'pay', 'visit', 'San', 'Francisco', 'news', 'succession', 'throne', 'country', 'Genovia', 'recent', 'death', 'father.At', 'first', 'Mia', 'rebellious', 'towards', 'grandmother', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'mother', 'who', 'keeping', 'royal', 'stature', 'secret', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Then', 'course', 'getting', 'more', 'spirit', 'things', 'flashy', 'new', 'makeover', 'rid', 'bushman', 'frizzy', 'hair', 'soon', 'stardom', 'people', 'school', 'are', 'eager', 'gain', 'attention', 'small', 'share', 'fame.As', 'teen-oriented', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'setbacks', 'dot', 'fairy', 'tale', 'countryside', 'here', 'Mia', 'crush', 'hunky', 'jock', 'who', 'only', 'fame', 'little', 'else', 'Immediately', 'smitten', 'boy', 'who', 'really', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'only', 'realize', 'trouble', 'caused', 'leading', 'mandatory', 'happy', 'ending', 'Disney', 'always', 'so', 'masterful', 'achieving.It', 'nothing', 'new', 'movie', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'great', 'deals', 'comedy', 'what', 'have', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'are', 'priceless', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'interspersed', 'script', 'one', 'point', 'Mia', 'makeover', 'artist', 'refers', 'eyebrows', 'quot', 'Frida', 'quot', 'quot', 'Kalo', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'wit', 'driver', 'Joseph', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'wonderful.And', 'just', 'Elizondo', 'high', 'note', 'so', 'much', 'cast', 'Andrews', 'back', 'fine', 'form', 'reprising', 'much', 'charm', 'charisma', 'past', 'roles', 'giving', 'got', 'here', 'Hathaway', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'playing', 'turn-around', 'princess', 'trying', 'make', 'splash', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'are', 'equally', 'well-cast', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'who', 'see', 'tough', 'times', 'Teen', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Erik', 'von', 'Detten', 'make', 'appearances', 'two', 'Mia', 'tormentors', 'surprise', 'found', 'cheering', 'when', 'revenge', 'them.When', 'over', 'done', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'quot', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'cuteness', ""n't"", 'give', 'bad', 'name', 'either', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'diversion', 'reality', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'charm', 'well-rounded', 'cast', 'actors', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'chance', 'see', 'Andrews', 'make', 'wonderful', 'comeback', 'course', 'see', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'get', 'slopped', 'ice', 'cream', 'cone', 'ahh', 'sweet', 'revenge']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

I imagine Julie Andews' British accent makes it ""foreign"" enough.And gee, can we get more shots of what a klutz this 20-year-old playing a 15-year-old is?  What seems to be a fairly normal gawky kid going through her teen years is repeatedly beaten over our heads to show what an ugly duckling she is.  Since Anne Hathaway has model-quality good looks, it seems the movie had to work extra hard to convince you how much of a misfit she is before her ""transformation"".  It didn't convince me.And of course all the snobs are cheerleaders.  And of course the guy she likes is a real jerk.  And of course the guy who's just a ""friend"" turns out to be the quality human being.  And of course Hector Elizondo has to do EXACTLY the same role as he did in ""Pretty Woman"", the Garry Marshall movie that tried.  And of course there has to be the big question of whether she will become a princess or not?  Anybody not able to guess what the answer will be?The movie is not horrible; the people that put it together are too talented for this.  But it seems that people who want G-Rated entertainment will accept almost anything, and are happy with it BECAUSE it has nothing offensive.  While this movie succeeds in not offending me with the usual things that knock out a G-rating, it did to some degree offend me that I knew exactly what was going to happen next during the entire movie.",2,Utterly predictable,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,1892,"['Director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'be', 'same', 'situation', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'Evolution', 'directors', 'have', 'produced', 'quality', 'popular', 'material', 'past', 'seem', 'be', 'cruise', 'control', 'right', 'now', 'figure', 'crank', 'same', 'formula', 'people', 'will', 'gobble', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'picture', 'take', 'lazy', 'way', 'wherever', 'hear', 'fictional', 'country', 'called', 'Genovia', 'gluing', 'pears', 'flowers', 'get', 'absolutley', 'feel', 'what', 'country', 'imagine', 'Julie', 'Andews', 'British', 'accent', 'foreign', 'enough.And', 'gee', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'shots', 'what', 'klutz', '20-year-old', 'playing', '15-year-old', 'What', 'be', 'fairly', 'normal', 'gawky', 'kid', 'going', 'teen', 'years', 'repeatedly', 'beaten', 'over', 'heads', 'show', 'what', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'model-quality', 'good', 'looks', 'movie', 'had', 'work', 'extra', 'hard', 'convince', 'how', 'much', 'misfit', 'transformation', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'me.And', 'course', 'snobs', 'are', 'cheerleaders', 'course', 'guy', 'real', 'jerk', 'course', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'friend', 'out', 'be', 'quality', 'human', 'being', 'course', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'do', 'EXACTLY', 'same', 'role', 'did', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'movie', 'tried', 'course', 'there', 'be', 'big', 'question', 'will', 'become', 'princess', 'not', 'Anybody', 'not', 'able', 'guess', 'what', 'answer', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'people', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'too', 'talented', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'G-Rated', 'entertainment', 'will', 'accept', 'almost', 'anything', 'are', 'happy', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'movie', 'not', 'offending', 'usual', 'things', 'knock', 'out', 'G-rating', 'did', 'degree', 'offend', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'entire', 'movie']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Mia Thermopolis lives in a refurbished San Francisco firehouse with her mother Helen and cat.  A nerdy neighbor suspect sometime strange is happening next door.  Mia sleeps upstairs in the loft and slides down a fire pole ended at the main floor.  Who wouldn't love to sleep in a firehouse loft and slide down a fire pole each morning?Mia awkwardness is best expressed when during a ""Josh kissing Mia daydream"", Mia gets chocolate ice cream smeared against her uniform; or when Mia throws up after being embarrassed during debate practice; or when she stumbles over her thick soled shoes as she practices walking with a stately glide; or when Mia's car breaks down on the way to the acceptance ball, too be rescued by Joseph, as she sits crying in the rain.  Joseph not Josh is the white knight to Mia's rescue.  Joseph is both understanding with Mia and very helpful in assisting Mia to become a beautiful young woman.  Joseph and Queen Clarisse help gently push Mia from the nest and help Mia fly.Helen manages a career, as an artist. Helen is a single mother, keeps secrets from Mia, and manages to get date with Mia's debate coach.  Mia and Helen rock climb together. Mia and Helen are more friends then mother-daughter. Mia discovers she is heir too a small European principality of Genovia, a secret her mother kept from her.  Helen wanted Mia to grow up, be educated, and suffer like all non-royalty, but on her 16th birthday choice.  The character development between Lilly, Lilly's brother, and Mia was minimal.  Lilly is a ""save the earth"" outcast, who pulled Mia into her cause.  Mia pretends to share Lilly interests because she is her friend.Lilly, at first likes Mia changes in popularity and status.  Lilly loves Mia makeover but over time, Lilly spends most of her time mumbling and nagged Mia.  Lilly can see their friendship disappearing.  Lilly's brother seems too gawk at Mia most of the time but at the end managed to dance with her at the acceptance ball.The central fantasy of this movie was the make over.  Every young girl believes cosmetics, perfect hair, and great clothes will transform them into popularity, affection with boys, and success.  Character development is the essence of a person.  Mia discovers both.  The beauty stylist ask Mia if her these were her glasses.  When Mia says, ""yes"" he snaps them in half.  The stylist says to Mia, ""If Brooke Shields married Groucho Marx, that child would have your eyebrows."" Mia gets her frizzed hairs straighten but not before the wood brush is broke trying to navigate through it.  Next, the eyebrows are plucked and cucumbers placed over her eyes.  Straight hair, eye shadow, eyelid coloring, cheek color, lipstick, and contacts restore the princess image.  The change catches Joshes attention and Lilly's brother, the quiet musician.The choice to accept or reject royalty may seem complex but it was not.  Mia almost immediately chose wealth, prestige, and royalty from the moment she met her grand mother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi.  Joseph head of security escort Mia around town by limousine.  Joseph secretly has a love for the queen but she can't, at the moment, accept his love because she must manage the kingdom.The Queen educated Mia on matters of manners, etiquette, statesmanship, and power.  Mia role as a princess only required to claim what was hers by birthright and this made her immediate famous.  The media received a tip from the hair designer about Mia royal status and TVs attention immediately converge on the High school.  Mia royalty had the affect of launching her into celebrity status.  The tabloids exploited this fact and followed her every move.In one scene, Queen Clarisse knights two officers rather than receive a speeding ticket.  The officers are dumbfounded and accept knighthood with all its perks.  The irony of the situation makes one laugh, they go out to give a ticket, run into a stately dress woman in her mid 50s, and become a knight of Genovia.  Mia arrives at the ball and accepts her title as princess of Genovia.  Mia is amazed as she arrives by helicopter to the exclusive castle on the hill, for which, she will take possession of.

543264,A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7,B00003CY5U,Grace,"[2, 2]","&quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; starring Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, is definitely one that you will want to see! It is an extremely well-made movie with a great story and strong acting. With an actress as talented and experienced as Julie Andrews, you can't go wrong. Anne Hathaway is surprisingly excellent also in her role as Mia Thermopolis, a shy and insecure 15-year-old who, in the beginning of the movie, isn't really noticed by anybody except her best friend Lily and Lily's brother Michael. Unfortunately, that doesn't prevent her from getting teased and ridiculed by the &quot;preps&quot; and the &quot;jocks,&quot; which include the blond-haired, pom-pon waving Lana, who is well portrayed by popular singer Mandy Moore. Basically, this movie is about an insecure teenaged girl whose life is completely turned around when her grandmother (her deceased father's mother) comes to inform Mia that she is &quot;Amelia Mionette Thermopolis Ronaldi&quot; (that's the closest to the actual spelling that I could get, haha), Princess of Genovia. Mia is extremely obstinant about this and only agrees to take &quot;princess lessons.&quot; She does not make her final decision until much later. Mia gradually gains more confidence after receiving a drastic makeover and &quot;lessons&quot; regarding mannerism and behavior, but overwhelming publicity and lack of support from schoolmates prevent Mia from crossing the line from &quot;typical schoolgirl&quot; to &quot;Princess of Genovia.&quot; It is her belief that she simply is not meant to take on the role as princess, but in reality, fear and self-centeredness are the only two things stopping her. After having a deep encounter with her soul and coming to terms with her father's wishes, Mia lifts up her head and is granted the courage to make the right decision about her future. Of course, this movie can be likened to Cinderella or any other uplifting fairy tale with which you wish to compare it. The acting is good, the story remains strong throughout, and the entertainment is prevalent.

543265,A1DCVKDBQS42XW,B00003CY5U,Gwyneth Sergio,"[0, 0]","Rather tepid, uncreative offering from Disney, Inc. involving the well worn formula of yet ""another spin"" on the rags-to-riches story. Anne Hathaway plays Mia, and of course, Julie Andrews, do the best they can. They are troopers with a so-so script that really keeps its focus on the teen trauma, that IS adolescence.  Unfortunately, adults will become rather distracted and start counting the lonely minutes, as the film wears on. The script tends to really drag, laden with the usual provisos that require more than a few dull-witted adults, hip kids, et al. Worse yet, the script aims at the adolescent thought zone and stay there, making it way too cute to suspend a gram of belief. Throw in the fact grandma is the head of state of a country, and knowing her name and being totally oblivious to this fact, is a serious stretch.  Julie Andrews comes as close to anyone, to being the antagonist of the film. I'm sorry, but the mere thought of Julie Andrews being nasty or even rude to anyone, could bring down the republic. She is a goddess of musical entertainment, and we would still worship her anyway.  The real standout of this pic is Hector Elizondo, who is believable, likeable and charismatic, as Joe. The scenes between him and Julie are some of the best.  THE PRINCESS DIARIES is not one of the best, but it's not the worst, by far. Just don't expect any of the usual nod and wink moments of adult humor, that keeps those over twenty on their toes.

543266,A37DLVPKJZGSQF,B00003CY5U,Hannibal,"[2, 2]","Why did most critics and viewers dislike this film so much? It was directed by Garry Marshall, who also directed the much-loved Pretty Woman, the film had a good cast, plot, some very funny moments and brings up one of the most original ideas for a film in ages. The movie also gets by without having any coarse language, violence or cheesy moments whatsoever. Okay, maybe some critics out there noticed the movie can be repetitive in places and some may find the story a little far-fetched, but I found this family comedy to be a delight. The movie stars Anne Hathaway as a nerdy girl at school who suddenly finds out she is princess of Genobia. This girl has curly hair, glasses and ugly shoes. So the transformation begins to turn this dork into a member of the royal family. And what a transformation it is! Anne Hathaway plays both sides of her role astoundingly and manages to bring up one of the most enjoyable performances by a young actor so far in the year. Julie Andrews is typically engaging, giving a really believable portrayal of a Queen whom must be someone who people look up to as well as trying to fit in grandmother-granddaughter time. The film&#65533;s script is brilliantly original and has lots of great laughs, moments of intense family poignancy and each of the characters has something in them that we can all relate to. This movie has been labelled as &#65533;a chick flick&#65533; but I think, I hope, boys and men will find something in this movie that they can appreciate, and I hope everyone can find the time to see this movie because it is truly fun to watch, even if at times it can sort of repeat the meaning it has just brought up a few shots ago. The movie has some great costumes and very good makeup for Anne Hathaway and as a whole, the movie is just really likeable and enjoyable, and I could not of wished for a better Midday watch.",4,A delight for all ages.,1002240000,"10 5, 2001",2001,1874,"['Why', 'did', 'most', 'critics', 'viewers', 'dislike', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'directed', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'much-loved', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'plot', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'ideas', 'film', 'ages', 'movie', 'also', 'having', 'coarse', 'language', 'violence', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'critics', 'out', 'there', 'noticed', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'repetitive', 'places', 'may', 'find', 'story', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'found', 'family', 'comedy', 'be', 'delight', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'nerdy', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'suddenly', 'out', 'princess', 'Genobia', 'girl', 'curly', 'hair', 'glasses', 'ugly', 'shoes', 'transformation', 'turn', 'dork', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'what', 'transformation', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'sides', 'role', 'astoundingly', 'manages', 'bring', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'young', 'actor', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'typically', 'engaging', 'giving', 'really', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'whom', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'people', 'look', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'fit', 'grandmother-granddaughter', 'time', 'film', '65533', 's', 'script', 'brilliantly', 'original', 'lots', 'great', 'laughs', 'moments', 'intense', 'family', 'poignancy', 'characters', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'been', 'labelled', '65533', 'chick', 'flick', '65533', 'think', 'hope', 'boys', 'men', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'movie', 'can', 'appreciate', 'hope', 'everyone', 'can', 'find', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'truly', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'times', 'can', 'sort', 'repeat', 'meaning', 'just', 'brought', 'up', 'few', 'shots', 'ago', 'movie', 'great', 'costumes', 'very', 'good', 'makeup', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'likeable', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'not', 'wished', 'better', 'Midday', 'watch']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

When I saw Mia Thermopolis in the first scene, with curly hair and glasses, I knew they were trying to make her seem like an unattractive, unimpressive girl with no looks. But it really was hard to believe so! Even with those heavy glasses and thick hair she looked pretty! Julie Andrews as Queen Clarisse fitted the role like a key in a lock. Mia's relationship with her mother and her reactions to the biggest and most unexpected information about her own life were totally realistic. Her neighbour, the man who wrote plays all day, was so so funny!! I liked Hector Elizondo in the movie too. Another person whose role completely suited him. And the ending was almost touching. Mia makes her decision, whether or not to accept the throne of Genovia, based on her father's letter to her! Another thing that makes the movie an amazing fairy tale is Mia's wish of popping her leg up while kissing!

543268,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00003CY5U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","As I again get stuck with babysitting my neighbor's kids, it must be time once more for... Sissified Classic Theater, and this time the spotlight falls on promising actress Anne Hathaway. Nowadays Anne Hathaway is strictly taking on grown-up roles. But she first made her hay by starring in well-regarded teen vehicles like THE PRINCESS DIARIES flicks andElla Enchanted (Widescreen Edition)(and, yikes, there's even the very controversialHavoc (Unrated Version)). THE PRINCESS DIARIES, coming out in 2001, is perhaps my Hathaway teen movie of choice. In it Anne plays 15-year-old Mia Thermopolis, gangly and awkward, cursed with thick bushman eyebrows and frizzy, messy Roseanne Roseannadanna-type hair. ""My expectation in life is to be invisible, and I'm good at it,"" confesses Mia, except that when you vomit in debate class, everyone tends to notice and bag on you.Mia is about to get some shocking news, and ""It's bigger than orthodontia."" The fun fairy tale element comes in once Mia's grandmother flies in from Europe and informs Mia that she's the heiress to the Genovian throne. And when your grandmother exudes the regal presence of Julie Andrews, things like this seem very possible. THE PRINCESS DIARIES is one of those expertly-done films that has such a feel-good theme going for it, and Hathaway is so winning and grounded enough, that you roll with it and grin a lot. Julie Andrews, whose past classic pictures have certainly garnered her her share of good will, is invaluable in lending proven grace and credibility to the story. Hector Elizondo is also very good as the stern head of Genovian security, although I can't wrap my brain around his character's boldness in courting the Queen. Inappropriate much? Or perhaps Genovia espouses a more relaxed set of proprieties. Still, Elizondo excels in these types of roles, and director Garry Marshall, in taking him on, was surely thinking of Elizondo's wonderful turn as the hotel manager inPretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition). Larry Miller comes in for a cup of coffee as hairdresser Paolo, and is wicked funny.The one actor I didn't really care for was Heather Matarazzo. She plays Mia's hard-charging environmentalist best pal, and she bristles with so much aggression that she borders on unlikeable. If it's any consolation, I thought she was great in the short-lived (but very awesome) TV series NOW AND AGAIN. Meanwhile, Mandy Moore? She's vacuous but preeety. She sings ""Stupid Cupid"" in this one, and that might've been her best scene.Garry Marshall is a pro at movies like this. Heck, even PRETTY WOMAN, despite its subject matter, is for all purposes a fairy tale and comes off as a surprisingly wholesome movie. But, of course, THE PRINCESS DIARIES caters to a younger audience, and so Marshall trades the soiled dove element for the princessly one. It's a real treat watching Mia being groomed for monarchy, taking her princess lessons, the Ugly Duckling turning into a swan. A still klutzy swan, yeah, but definitely a swan. Mia even learns the wango (sort of like a waltz and a tango) and dines at a royal banquet (which she turns into an adventurous meal). Naturally, all these changes can't help but be reflected in her time at school. The usual stuff that happens when the nerd poaches in the in-crowd territory, happens. Can Mia stay grounded enough as she becomes a celebrity and as she becomes suddenly popular? And, in the end, will she make the right choice for herself and for the nation of Genovia?This is a Disney product, so there's nothing too radical or extreme on the screen. Mia experiences her growing pains, learns important life lessons, even dabbles in romance. The expected vanilla beats come on in, and we take it good-naturedly, because the film is charming and funny and because Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews develop great chemistry. One of the best bits in the movie is when Anne reflexively tells Julie Andrews to ""Shut up!"" and then to watch Julie's affronted reaction. And, since this is Disney doing a movie about a princess, of course, there's a royal ball. My absolutely favorite moment in THE PRINCESS DIARIES? Mia in the royal ball, doing the robot.Frankly, if it's simply a choice between either living in a royal palace or in a way cool refurbished fire station in San Francisco - well, damn, that's still a toughie...This has been Sissified Classic Theater.

It turns out that the long estranged grandma is the queen of a small European country, and she came to ask Mia to claim the throne as the princess of Genovia.A teenage version of Cinderella/Pretty Woman fairy tale, it's really quite sweet and funny.  Unfortunately the characters are a bit shallow, but it probably won't be a big issue for the kids.  Its wonderful to see Julie Andrews on the big screen again, and her performance as Queen Clarisse is convincing and regal.  Anne Hathaway's portrayal of the outcast Mia is adequate, her character starts out believable as she struggles to choose whether to claim her right as the princess or to continue her life in San Francisco, but somewhere in the middle she quickly became superficial and at times immature.  Hector Elizondo plays Joseph, the chief of security to the queen, a good supporting role with not enough screen time to develop the character more.The plot for the Princess Diaries is easy for young kids to follow, and it touches on a lot of issues most high schoolers should be able to identify with.

However, the film actually captured my interest and approval.Pros:1)&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; offers quality entertainment fit for the entire family. There is little, if any, swearing which is excellent for the younger audience (or for the older audience if you are like me and dislike tastless profanity!)2)The overall moral of the story is rather elementary, but well executed i.e. there is more to being a princess than having power and vast lands.3)Julie Andrews offers a wonderfully elegant performance without the ostentation.4)The humor in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is actually funny... All too often films claim to be funny, but instead of offering decent humor they use sexual jokes and gutter humor versus true comedy.Anyway, you get the point..Cons:1)One scene of the film that irritated me greatly dealt with the princess's physical make over. A short explanation: The princess is a klutzy, unattractive young woman whom undergoes a make over under the orders of her grandmother, the queen. When the make over is finished, the princess loses all of her physical klutziness and instantly becomes an irresistable young woman who can do no wrong. (This ficticious attitude last a while, then the flim takes a more realistic approach to princess's make over i.e. a little make-up being applied does not connotate that you will not trip over your own shoes...)That is about it for the deadly Cons.Overall, go see the movie with your family.

It's always a relief to see new actors and actress coming to the screen.  Like Anne Hathaway, for example.  She did an excellent part in her role as the young Mia Thermopolis.  She made me believe in her character and root for her.  And of course, who could forget the charming Miss Julia Andrews as her grandmother, who happens to be the queen of Genovia! The Princess Diaries is a magical fairy tale waiting to happen.  Mia goes from clumsy little high school girl, into a beautiful young princess of Genovia.  Anne's perfomance is so uplifting, it's hard to forget her comical moments as you tries to go about her everday life as a princess, and still try to be the princess she was meant to be.  Gary Marshell made a movie that will bring smiles and tears to your face, while watching The Princess Diaries.  These new comers did a very good job on their performances.

Yes, it may be predictable, but most films are. You can guess from the opening how it will end, but what makes a film like this outstanding is the way the material is presented and the way it is acted. This film has everything right. It is funny with many laugh out loud lines, romantic and charming. The pace never drags. It is well worth the ticket price.Julie Andrews has been one of my favorite performrs since she first appeared on Broadway when we both were in our teens.(We were born the same year.) She has always been remarkable in any role she has undertaken. In this film, she is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, she is certainly regal as the queen of a country should be, and has that certain glint in her eye that makes you smile just looking at her. Even though she no longer is able to sing, she is still wonderful in a straight acting role. She alone makes this film worth seeing over and over.However there is a wonderful new actress playing the Princess, Anne Hathaway. She really shows great talent in her switch from an awkward, frumpy wallflower klutz to a regal, dignified lady. Yes, this theme has been told in many other films and will be told in many still to come, but not a charmingly as in &quot;Princess Diaries&quot;.This film definitely proves that a G rated film can be delightfully entertaining for all age groups.

I like Julie Andrews, I like Cinderella stories, I like fairy tales and I like kids' movies, so before you leap onto your high horse and defend the movie by saying that I'm just too cynical to enjoy it, you're wrong.Here's why I didn't enjoy it:Most of the acting sucks.  With the exception of Andrews, Anne Hathaway and Heather Matarazzo, most of the performances are just plain lousy.  Hector Elizondo appears to be so bored playing one of director Garry Marshall's ""nice guy"" characters for the umpteenth time, it feels like they used a Hector Elizondo robot for his scenes.But even the three lead actresses struggle hard to work with a screenplay that boasts some genuinely horrid dialog and a director who seems to think that bugging eyes, screaming and someone falling down every five minutes is the best way to entertain kids.Garry Marshall has never been a really great director.  He's made some good movies along the way (NOTHING ON COMMON, FRANKIE & JOHNNY, even YOUNG DOCTORS IN LOVE), but most of his movies are uneven, sugary sweet and self-destructively audience pleasing (PRETTY WOMAN, THE OTHER SISTER, EXIT TO EDEN).  I haven't seen every one of his movies, but I can't imagine any are worse that THE PRINCESS DIARIES.

This theme is the importance of physical makeovers. Now I know this movie was about more than that--however, once again, I only want to get my point across, not necessarily recommend or not recommend it.The makeup artists at the studio started with the naturally beautiful Anne Hathaway. To make her geeky and unpopular, they added glasses, frizzed her hair, and made some other minor adjustments to her face. Then, during the movie, they give her a makeover in which she magically becomes the same old beautiful Anne Hathaway she started out as, again. What's so amazing about that? Why does it even matter what she looks like? If Genovians can't accept her the way she was before, I don't think that sends a good message to young girls, anyway--that you can't be accepted if you don't look like a model.I'll concede that maybe to be in the public spotlight, she would need some charm lessons--how to walk straight, speak in front of an audience, etc.In an age of Britney Spears and fashion models, girls need real role models--ones who don't tell them they need to be beautiful to be happy or successful, but who tells them that, no matter what they look like, if they work hard toward their goals they will be happy and successful.",3,A Bad Example for Young Girls,1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,1568,"['OK', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'going', 'review', 'movie', 'sense', 'word', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'start', 'rating', 'have', ""'ll"", 'give', 'rating', 'movie', 'overall.Instead', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'opinion', 'what', 'see', 'crippling', 'theme', 'running', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'theme', 'importance', 'physical', 'makeovers', 'Now', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'more', 'however', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'want', 'get', 'point', 'not', 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'not', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'makeup', 'artists', 'studio', 'started', 'naturally', 'beautiful', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'make', 'geeky', 'unpopular', 'added', 'glasses', 'frizzed', 'hair', 'made', 'other', 'minor', 'adjustments', 'face', 'Then', 'movie', 'give', 'makeover', 'magically', 'same', 'old', 'beautiful', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'started', 'out', 'again', 'What', 'so', 'amazing', 'Why', 'even', 'matter', 'what', 'Genovians', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'way', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'message', 'young', 'girls', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'accepted', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'model.I', ""'ll"", 'concede', 'maybe', 'be', 'public', 'spotlight', 'would', 'need', 'charm', 'lessons', 'how', 'walk', 'straight', 'speak', 'front', 'audience', 'etc.In', 'age', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'fashion', 'models', 'girls', 'need', 'real', 'role', 'models', 'ones', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'need', 'be', 'beautiful', 'be', 'happy', 'successful', 'who', 'matter', 'what', 'look', 'work', 'hard', 'goals', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'successful']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Bernabo,"[2, 9]","&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is a story about a young teenager girl who discovers one day that she is really the princess of Genovia, a postage stamp country between France and Spain, and the only blood heir to the throne.  This Disney Film is firmly in the Ugly Duckling tradition, which means that Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) starts out with glasses and bushy curly hair, but she is one makeover away from being gorgeous.  The agent of revelation in this story is her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), who explains that Mia must be prepared to assume the throne.  However, Mia's mother (Caroline Goodall) assures her daughter that she does not have to be a real princess is she really does not want to be.Will Mia becomes a princess?  Will the makeover help?  Will she tell her best friend (Heather Matarazzo) her secret?  Will the press find out?  Will Mia get the first kiss of her dreams?  Will Mia pick her best friend's brother (Robert Schwartzman) or the big man on campus (Erik von Detten)?  Will Mia ever hit the softball?  Will the evil baron and his bride take over Genovia?  Will Mia's mom find a boyfriend?  Will Mia ever get to put stuck up cheerleader Lana Thomas (Mandy Moore) in her place?  Do I really have to ask any of these questions?This movie is going to be liked a lot more by adolescent girls who have not seem enough of this particular formula film to know that most of it is painfully predictable.  Fans of Garry Marshall have to be disappointed that this film is not a lot better.  Fortunately he has Julie Andrews as the queen and it is hard to get too mad at a film that has her going around being so nice to everybody.  I think it is because it is Andrews in the role that the culture shock of colliding with her granddaughter's world is not so great: informed that she is a princess Mia shouts &quot;Shut up!&quot; and there are retainers there to explain to the queen that in the vernacular of American teenagers this does not mean &quot;to be quiet.&quot;  Unfortunately the script requires the queen to be a bit slow at key moments so that all the little conflicts of the film can come together.Marshall also has his good luck charm, Hector Elizondo as Joe, who is the queen's jack of all trades.  Although he is under utilized, Elizondo provides most of the timely intelligent comments in the film.  I know they are working on a sequel this year for this film in which Mia is going to be forced to marry some young European royal, but I am hoping that Joe does more than dance with the queen the next time around.There are relatively few really good moments in &quot;The Princess Diaries.&quot;  I liked the line Mia says before her big romantic kiss, and I liked the setting of the big romantic kiss, but the scene only underscores the idea it should not have taken her this long to make the right choice.  More emblematic of the film is when Mia gives her arch nemesis her big comeuppance.  I know that this is a Disney film and that allowances must be made, but even within those strictures this was the best anybody could come up with?  The alternative scene included on the DVD is even lamer.

Out of the blue, her estranged, paternal grandmother, Queen of Genovia, swoops down upon her and tells Mia that she is, in fact, a princess of royal blood and the next ruler of the kingdom of Genovia. Granny, regally played by the stately, always lovely, and seemingly ageless Julie Andrews, is determined to turn her awkward granddaughter into a princess worthy of her crown.

543306,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00003CY5U,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","One of the often repeated themes in movies that seem to have picked up in frequency of late is the story of the girl or woman who becomes a princess.  In comparison to most of those other movies, this one succeeds.  Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is in her gawky, geeky, teen years.  Mia's reaction to not fitting in is to wish that she were invisible.  She is an extreme type-B personality; introverted, shy, abhorrent of being the center of attention.Mia's grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews) interrupts Mia's attempt at making herself invisible by revealing to Mia that she is heir to the throne of Genovia.  Mia is alternately fascinated and distressed by the opportunity that has been presented to her.  Attempting to help her in this decision, either directly or indirectly, are an assorted variety of friends, relatives, and others with an interest in whether she will accept the responsibility of being the Princess of Genovia.Perhaps two of the strongest influences in her life as she tries to make this decision are those of her grandmother and Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo), both type-A personalities.  Her grandmother strongly encourages her to take up the mantle of princess, but ultimately backs off, realizing that the decision has to be Mia's own.  Lilly, an ardent environmentalist, is alternately fascinated by the possibility that her friend might have a chance to influence the world in a very positive way, and yet concerned that her friend may become like the other A-crats (autocrats); concerned with power, status and style over substance.  Lilly vocalizes Mia's fears in a way that Mia is unable, and is thus a very important (though frequently obnoxious) character.Mia also has other, more subtle influences.  Her mother (Caroline Goodall) wants Mia to choose for herself, and clearly show that she will stand by Mia's decision.  Chauffeur and bodyguard Joe quietly watches Mia mature from an indecisive, geeky teenage girl to a beautiful, self-confident young woman, with minor assistance and perspective along the way.  Joe is played perfectly by Hector Elizondo in a near reprise to a similar role in ""Pretty Woman,"" though here he attempts to be more aloof from the activities, ultimately failing.Thrown into this mix are the usual issues faced by maturing teenagers of every age.  The guy Mia thinks she would like to have as a boyfriend (handsome, shallow and self-centered) versus the guy who will be truly supportive of her and who truly loves her (Robert Schwartzman).  Her comparison to the stuck-up cheerleaders (Lana, Anna and Fontana, who make me ill remembering similar types from my own high school years) makes her secretly envious.It would be easy to be critical of this movie.  It does have a lot of clich&eacute;, it does present stereotypes, and it does retread material that has been done so many times before.  However, it is the relatively straightforward story with a solid acting cast that makes this movie a winner.  Anne Hathaway is perfect as the princess.  She communicates her fear of being one of the ""establishment,"" but is fascinated by the possibility of being accepted.  Her ultimate choice brushes aside all the trivialities and focuses on being mature and responsible.  Heather Matarazzo and Robert Schwartzman are excellent as a brother and sister, one a best friend, the other who loves, both who support her.  And best of all are Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo in roles for which she they were perfectly cast.  The combination of talent and the clever way in which Mia's character evolves make this movie a perfect family movie, most especially for all the special princesses in our lives.",4,Modern Fairy Tale,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,3680,"['One', 'often', 'repeated', 'themes', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'frequency', 'late', 'story', 'girl', 'woman', 'who', 'princess', 'comparison', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'Mia', 'Thermopolis', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'gawky', 'geeky', 'teen', 'years', 'Mia', 'reaction', 'not', 'fitting', 'wish', 'were', 'invisible', 'extreme', 'type-B', 'personality', 'introverted', 'shy', 'abhorrent', 'being', 'center', 'attention.Mia', 'grandmother', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Renaldi', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Mia', 'attempt', 'making', 'invisible', 'revealing', 'Mia', 'heir', 'throne', 'Genovia', 'Mia', 'alternately', 'fascinated', 'distressed', 'opportunity', 'been', 'presented', 'Attempting', 'help', 'decision', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'are', 'assorted', 'variety', 'friends', 'relatives', 'others', 'interest', 'will', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'being', 'Princess', 'Genovia.Perhaps', 'two', 'strongest', 'influences', 'life', 'make', 'decision', 'are', 'grandmother', 'Lilly', 'Moscovitz', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'type-A', 'personalities', 'grandmother', 'strongly', 'take', 'up', 'mantle', 'princess', 'ultimately', 'off', 'realizing', 'decision', 'be', 'Mia', 'own', 'Lilly', 'ardent', 'environmentalist', 'alternately', 'fascinated', 'possibility', 'friend', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'influence', 'world', 'very', 'positive', 'way', 'yet', 'concerned', 'friend', 'may', 'become', 'other', 'A-crats', 'autocrats', 'concerned', 'power', 'status', 'style', 'substance', 'Lilly', 'Mia', 'fears', 'way', 'Mia', 'unable', 'thus', 'very', 'important', 'frequently', 'obnoxious', 'character.Mia', 'also', 'other', 'more', 'subtle', 'influences', 'mother', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'Mia', 'choose', 'herself', 'clearly', 'show', 'will', 'stand', 'Mia', 'decision', 'Chauffeur', 'bodyguard', 'Joe', 'quietly', 'Mia', 'mature', 'indecisive', 'geeky', 'teenage', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'self-confident', 'young', 'woman', 'minor', 'assistance', 'perspective', 'way', 'Joe', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'near', 'reprise', 'similar', 'role', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'here', 'be', 'more', 'aloof', 'activities', 'ultimately', 'failing.Thrown', 'mix', 'are', 'usual', 'issues', 'faced', 'maturing', 'teenagers', 'age', 'guy', 'Mia', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'handsome', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'truly', 'supportive', 'who', 'truly', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'comparison', 'stuck-up', 'cheerleaders', 'Lana', 'Anna', 'Fontana', 'who', 'make', 'ill', 'remembering', 'similar', 'types', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'secretly', 'envious.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'be', 'critical', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'present', 'stereotypes', 'retread', 'material', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'However', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'story', 'solid', 'acting', 'cast', 'movie', 'winner', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'perfect', 'princess', 'fear', 'being', 'one', 'establishment', 'fascinated', 'possibility', 'being', 'accepted', 'ultimate', 'choice', 'brushes', 'aside', 'trivialities', 'focuses', 'being', 'mature', 'responsible', 'Matarazzo', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'are', 'excellent', 'brother', 'sister', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'other', 'who', 'who', 'support', 'best', 'are', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'roles', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'combination', 'talent', 'clever', 'way', 'Mia', 'character', 'evolves', 'make', 'movie', 'perfect', 'family', 'movie', 'most', 'especially', 'special', 'princesses', 'lives']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

I can't imagine anyone else in her roll.The DVD release is perfect for fans of the movie.  The widescreen picture looks great and the full surround is perfect.  There's a fun behind the scenes featurette, 8 deleted scenes with interesting if somewhat over done commentary by Gary Marshall, and two audio commentaries.  The first features director Gary Marshall and the second features a tea party/commentary with Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway.Pre-teens girls are the target audience of this movie, and they'll love it.

Some of the conflict and giddiness seem believable and real, as when Mia (Hathaway) takes advantage of her popularity to go on a date with the most popular (and jerky) boy at school, or when Mia is embarrassed that her mother is planning a date with a teacher. There are also some touching moments between Mia and her bodyguard-turned-chauffeur. But there is too much that seems phony; it's a given that the climactic ball will be a chance for Mia to save the day and get a romantic moment with her true-blue boyfriend-to-be, but the filmmakers shouldn't have made the mistake of making Mia blind to the benefits of being a princess; more importantly, they shouldn't have tried to play off Mia's newfound royalty as a cause for derision by her peers.",3,"Hathaway engaging, plot by the numbers",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,880,"['predictable', 'teen', 'fantasy', 'downtrodden', 'San', 'Francisco', '15', 'year', 'old', 'discovers', 'actually', 'princess', 'Genovia', 'conflict', 'giddiness', 'seem', 'believable', 'real', 'when', 'Mia', 'Hathaway', 'advantage', 'popularity', 'go', 'date', 'most', 'popular', 'jerky', 'boy', 'school', 'when', 'Mia', 'embarrassed', 'mother', 'planning', 'date', 'teacher', 'are', 'also', 'touching', 'moments', 'Mia', 'bodyguard-turned-chauffeur', 'too', 'much', 'phony', 'given', 'climactic', 'ball', 'will', 'be', 'chance', 'Mia', 'save', 'day', 'get', 'romantic', 'moment', 'true-blue', 'boyfriend-to-be', 'filmmakers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'making', 'Mia', 'blind', 'benefits', 'being', 'princess', 'more', 'importantly', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'tried', 'play', 'off', 'Mia', 'newfound', 'royalty', 'cause', 'derision', 'peers']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

543317,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CY5U,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","Much of The Princess Diaries sparkles like a diamond. The rest of it is more like cut glass. ... The parts I enjoyed were more than enough to compensate for the scenes where the movie becomes predictable and banal. The scenes that shimmer are the ones with Julie Andrews, who is incapable of being either predictable or banal. Basically, you can fast-forward through the other scenes and not miss a thing. She more than makes the movie worthwhile.Mia [Anne Hathaway] is a bright, gawky fifteen-year old living in a converted San Francisco fire hall with her eccentric artist mother, Lana [Many Moore]. Her awkwardness, her fizzy hair, and her devotion to liberal causes do not make her popular at school. Her best friend, Lilly [Heather Matarazzo], is a free spirit who delights in upsetting the school's frat boys and pom pom girls. But Mia's life is about to make a dramatic turn. Her parents were divorced when she was little, and her Dad returned to his small European homeland. He has recently died, and Mia's grandmother, Clarisse [Andrews], has come to town. This is no sentimental visit. Clarisse is actually the Queen of that faraway land. What Mia is about to find out is that, not only is she a real princess, she is heir to the throne. This news does not exactly make her day.It is great to see Andrews again. I have missed her. I don't think there is any actress who can be so elegant, regal, charming and funny all at the same time. Playing a queen is right up her alley. Anne Hathaway is good in her first big starring role and makes the transformation from giddy girl to assured young woman seem believable. The young Heather Matarazzo, who has a face that is both plain and intriguing, is destined to become a great character actress. You should see a lot of her in the coming years. Director Gerry Marshall believes that making movie should be fun, andin this case, the good times are reflected in the movie. Mr. Marshall also directed Pretty Woman and Beaches. He is a master at telling stories about women, and this is one of his better efforts.The weak parts of The Princess Diaries are those depicting life at Mia's school. I know the movie needs to show that Mia lives a middle-class life because this emphasises the culture shock she faces. I think this could have been done without its turning into a stereotypical teen comedy about the geeks vs. the jocks and the cheerleaders. The scenes that show Clarisse's attempts to turn ugly duckling Mia into a swan are much funnier and more interesting, as are those between Mia and Lilly because the girls' relationship is both well written and somewhat true to life.Most girls have a fantasy about being a princess, and they are the ones this movie is aimed at. They should be enchanted. Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is that it tells a story about teens while still managing a 'G' rating. This goes to show that sometimes we can successfully do without all the profanity and innuendoes.",3,"Part diamond, part cut galss",1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2967,"['Much', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'diamond', 'rest', 'more', 'cut', 'glass', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'more', 'enough', 'compensate', 'scenes', 'where', 'movie', 'predictable', 'banal', 'scenes', 'shimmer', 'are', 'ones', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'who', 'incapable', 'being', 'predictable', 'banal', 'Basically', 'can', 'fast-forward', 'other', 'scenes', 'not', 'miss', 'thing', 'more', 'movie', 'worthwhile.Mia', '[', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', ']', 'bright', 'gawky', 'fifteen-year', 'old', 'living', 'converted', 'San', 'Francisco', 'fire', 'hall', 'eccentric', 'artist', 'mother', 'Lana', '[', 'Many', 'Moore', ']', 'Her', 'awkwardness', 'fizzy', 'hair', 'devotion', 'liberal', 'causes', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'popular', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'Lilly', '[', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', ']', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'upsetting', 'school', 'frat', 'boys', 'pom', 'pom', 'girls', 'Mia', 'life', 'make', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'parents', 'were', 'divorced', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'Dad', 'returned', 'small', 'European', 'homeland', 'recently', 'died', 'Mia', 'grandmother', 'Clarisse', '[', 'Andrews', ']', 'come', 'town', 'sentimental', 'visit', 'Clarisse', 'actually', 'Queen', 'faraway', 'land', 'What', 'Mia', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'princess', 'heir', 'throne', 'news', 'not', 'exactly', 'make', 'day.It', 'great', 'see', 'Andrews', 'again', 'have', 'missed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'elegant', 'regal', 'charming', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'Playing', 'queen', 'right', 'alley', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'good', 'first', 'big', 'starring', 'role', 'transformation', 'giddy', 'girl', 'assured', 'young', 'woman', 'seem', 'believable', 'young', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'who', 'face', 'plain', 'intriguing', 'destined', 'become', 'great', 'character', 'actress', 'should', 'see', 'lot', 'coming', 'years', 'Director', 'Gerry', 'Marshall', 'making', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'andin', 'case', 'good', 'times', 'are', 'reflected', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Marshall', 'also', 'directed', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Beaches', 'master', 'telling', 'stories', 'women', 'one', 'better', 'efforts.The', 'weak', 'parts', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'are', 'depicting', 'life', 'Mia', 'school', 'know', 'movie', 'show', 'Mia', 'middle-class', 'life', 'culture', 'shock', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'turning', 'stereotypical', 'teen', 'comedy', 'geeks', 'jocks', 'cheerleaders', 'scenes', 'show', 'Clarisse', 'attempts', 'turn', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'Mia', 'swan', 'are', 'much', 'funnier', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'Mia', 'Lilly', 'girls', 'relationship', 'well', 'written', 'somewhat', 'true', 'life.Most', 'girls', 'have', 'fantasy', 'being', 'princess', 'are', 'ones', 'movie', 'aimed', 'should', 'be', 'enchanted', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'story', 'teens', 'still', 'managing', 'G', 'rating', 'show', 'sometimes', 'can', 'successfully', 'do', 'profanity', 'innuendoes']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

543319,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00003CY5U,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[4, 5]","Why? Because I identify so much with them! Lets take Mia for example. Like me she has: bad hair, glasses, a bit geeky, and clumsy to boot. The only thing Anne Hathaway wasn't 'blessed' with during this movie was bad skin. Why not?!I must admit I'm a sucker for a good Cinderella story, after all, what girl wouldn't want a hunk carrying her away from everything? (And doing stuff to her afterwards that Disney can't show?) This isn't that much of a Cinderella story, although it's loosely based around the idea. There is the fairy godmother, but there's no prince charming - the guys were not cute in this movie!The only thing that stops this movie from becoming four stars, is the fact it's so slow!!! The first hour flies by, the second absolutely drags. It has a few funny moments, particularly when they're at the big fancy dinner, but that's about it.I loved the fact that this movie was directed by Garry Marshall, the same guy who directed Pretty Woman. Even some of the same actors appear in this. Allan Kent who plays the waiter at state dinner says the words, ""Happens all the time."" He said the same words as the waiter in Pretty Woman. Patrick Richwood, who played elevator operator Dennis in Pretty Woman also appears as Mia's next door neighbour. Also, you may also spot Hector Elizonda, who was the hotel manager, Barney Thompson.There's an underlying romance (since Mia wasn't getting any) going on between Hector & the fabulous Julie Andrews, which was hinted at during the movie, but never really brought forward. However, this relationship Queen Clarisse Renaldi and Joseph was not scripted. The dance scene and the underlying affection was added by the two actors. According to Hector Elizondo, ""We felt that a romance after 50 was important to tell and it can be sensual and sexy while keeping your clothes on.""The scene where Mia trips and falls in the bleachers was real. Anne Hathaway had tripped while doing the scene, and director Garry Marshall thought it was funny, he inserted it in the final cut. Hector also played basketball several hours solo in the rain for the few seconds shown in the movie.Two of my boyfriend's favourite women also appear in this, and they are Mandy Moore and Heather Matarazzo. Neither have really big parts, and Heather plays her usual role, of being a really little whine at times, and also a snob. Mandy played a blonde cheerleader, and once more, she sings a song during this. Why?! Why must she always sing in movies, to constantly remind she was a not-so-successful singer before this? Grrrrrr. She was a real cow in this movie, and thankfully, she got her come-uppance, cos I was about ready to strangle her!The plot is predictable, and the extras are majorly fluffy, but what else do you expect from a Disney movie? Anne Hathaway held her own against the other bigger name stars, and really shone in this movie. And she did the ugly duckling/swan looks really well. It will be interesting to see how the sequel goes, as I don't really think they could have done much more with it than already done.I don't think as some reviewers have mentioned this is a kiddie version of Pretty Woman. For starters, there's no handsome hunk to sweep the lead off her feet, in fact, the whole guy-lusting-after-girl-but-she-only-notices-the-popular-guy-at-school is really dumbed down, and hardly a major part of the movie. I think I prefer Pretty Woman though - Garry Marshall has never surpassed that movie.This movie will never be considered a classic, and is pretty much forgettable a while after watching it. It's nothing special, although Anne Hathaway could do with a little nudge in the right direction, and she'll become a star.",3,I love ugly duckling into swan movies,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,3685,"['Why', 'identify', 'so', 'much', 'Lets', 'take', 'Mia', 'example', 'bad', 'hair', 'glasses', 'bit', 'geeky', 'clumsy', 'boot', 'only', 'thing', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'was', ""n't"", ""'blessed"", 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'skin', 'Why', 'not', 'must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'what', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'hunk', 'carrying', 'away', 'everything', 'doing', 'stuff', 'afterwards', 'Disney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'idea', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'prince', 'charming', 'guys', 'were', 'not', 'cute', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'becoming', 'four', 'stars', 'fact', 'so', 'slow', 'first', 'hour', 'flies', 'second', 'absolutely', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'particularly', 'when', ""'re"", 'big', 'fancy', 'dinner', 'it.I', 'loved', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Even', 'same', 'actors', 'appear', 'Allan', 'Kent', 'who', 'waiter', 'state', 'dinner', 'words', 'time', 'said', 'same', 'words', 'waiter', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Patrick', 'Richwood', 'who', 'played', 'elevator', 'operator', 'Dennis', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'also', 'Mia', 'next', 'door', 'neighbour', 'Also', 'may', 'also', 'spot', 'Hector', 'Elizonda', 'who', 'was', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Barney', 'Thompson.There', 'underlying', 'romance', 'Mia', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'going', 'Hector', 'fabulous', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'hinted', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'brought', 'forward', 'However', 'relationship', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'Renaldi', 'Joseph', 'was', 'not', 'scripted', 'dance', 'scene', 'underlying', 'affection', 'was', 'added', 'two', 'actors', 'According', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'felt', 'romance', '50', 'was', 'important', 'tell', 'can', 'be', 'sensual', 'sexy', 'keeping', 'clothes', 'scene', 'where', 'Mia', 'trips', 'falls', 'bleachers', 'was', 'real', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'had', 'tripped', 'doing', 'scene', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'inserted', 'final', 'cut', 'Hector', 'also', 'played', 'basketball', 'several', 'hours', 'solo', 'rain', 'few', 'seconds', 'shown', 'movie.Two', 'boyfriend', 'favourite', 'women', 'also', 'appear', 'are', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'have', 'really', 'big', 'parts', 'Heather', 'usual', 'role', 'being', 'really', 'little', 'whine', 'times', 'also', 'snob', 'Mandy', 'played', 'blonde', 'cheerleader', 'once', 'more', 'song', 'Why', 'Why', 'must', 'always', 'sing', 'movies', 'constantly', 'remind', 'was', 'not-so-successful', 'singer', 'Grrrrrr', 'was', 'real', 'cow', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'got', 'come-uppance', 'cos', 'was', 'about', 'ready', 'strangle', 'plot', 'predictable', 'extras', 'are', 'majorly', 'fluffy', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'held', 'own', 'other', 'bigger', 'name', 'stars', 'really', 'shone', 'movie', 'did', 'ugly', 'duckling/swan', 'looks', 'really', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'already', 'done.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'kiddie', 'version', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'starters', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'sweep', 'lead', 'feet', 'fact', 'whole', 'guy-lusting-after-girl-but-she-only-notices-the-popular-guy-at-school', 'really', 'dumbed', 'down', 'hardly', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'think', 'prefer', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'never', 'surpassed', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgettable', 'while', 'watching', 'nothing', 'special', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'nudge', 'right', 'direction', ""'ll"", 'become', 'star']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Hathaway plays commoner 15 year old Mia, the class invisible girl, whose life is thrown into chaos when Queen Julie arrives to tell her that she is the sole daughter to the Prince of Genovia, and theretofore, the next in line to rule the kingdom.  A MY FAIR LADY transformation occurs, with the formerly nerdy Mia becoming quite a fetching young woman to the dismay of her best friend and wanna be boyfriend (marvelously embodied by Heather Matarazzo and Robert Schwartzman).

Princess Mia from the books was a fun and spunky character that finds out that she was a Princess to the throne of the principality of Genovia because their prince had a fling with her artistic mother and because her father is now unable to have any more children, she must take up the title of Princess. Instead of being in the city of New York, they put it in San Fransico. Instead of being alive, they state that her father dies, but I can't really blame them for that since they were trying to make it kid friendly and as sad as it is saying that he is dead is much easier than saying that he had prostate cancer and because of the treatments he is now sterile. Mia's Grandmere is portrayed by Julie Andrews (an actress that I am a huge fan of), but I felt that she was not right for the role of Clarisse, why because she was too nice. Clarisse in the books was not evil and abusive in the books, but she was very strict and just didn't understand Mia's more modern views on life which would cause them to get into huge arguments. All the high school snobs (like Lana), were pretty close to the books, but Michael my Michael was ruined. Yes Michael was in a rock band, but that wasn't all he was, he was smart, a computer and tech genius, very good looking, and had a personality that most girls would swoon over. In the movie we get this kind of grungy guy that wasn't that good looking and didn't have much of a personality, it is because of how he was presented in the movie is probably why his relationship with Mia in the movies didn't last. Loveable charcters like Tina and Borris were taken out of the movie and replaced with this guy Jeramiah who was a magician and had crayon red hair. If this and the sequel had been stand alone movies, then I would have liked them more, but they are not and that make me not like them as much as I could have.",3,I couldn't really enjoy this movie as much as I could have because it was nothing like the books.,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,1980,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'book', 'series', 'time', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'book', 'finnished', 'last', 'one', 'Princess', 'Mia', 'books', 'was', 'fun', 'spunky', 'character', 'out', 'was', 'Princess', 'throne', 'principality', 'Genovia', 'prince', 'had', 'fling', 'artistic', 'mother', 'father', 'now', 'unable', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'must', 'take', 'up', 'title', 'Princess', 'Instead', 'being', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'put', 'San', 'Fransico', 'Instead', 'being', 'alive', 'state', 'father', 'dies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'kid', 'friendly', 'as', 'sad', 'saying', 'dead', 'much', 'easier', 'saying', 'had', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'now', 'sterile', 'Mia', 'Grandmere', 'portrayed', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'actress', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'role', 'Clarisse', 'why', 'was', 'too', 'nice', 'Clarisse', 'books', 'was', 'not', 'evil', 'abusive', 'books', 'was', 'very', 'strict', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Mia', 'more', 'modern', 'views', 'life', 'would', 'cause', 'get', 'huge', 'arguments', 'high', 'school', 'snobs', 'Lana', 'were', 'pretty', 'close', 'books', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'was', 'ruined', 'Yes', 'Michael', 'was', 'rock', 'band', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'was', 'was', 'smart', 'computer', 'tech', 'genius', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'had', 'personality', 'most', 'girls', 'would', 'swoon', 'over', 'movie', 'get', 'kind', 'grungy', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'looking', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'personality', 'how', 'was', 'presented', 'movie', 'probably', 'why', 'relationship', 'Mia', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'Loveable', 'charcters', 'Tina', 'Borris', 'were', 'taken', 'movie', 'replaced', 'guy', 'Jeramiah', 'who', 'was', 'magician', 'had', 'crayon', 'red', 'hair', 'sequel', 'had', 'been', 'stand', 'alone', 'movies', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'are', 'not', 'make', 'not', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

So you might guess that I have a soft spot for her.  The Princess Diaries is Julie's return to the studio that made her famous.Mia Termopolis is your average teenager trying to survive high school.  She lives in an old fire house (probably the one from Herbie Rides Again) and he has her own socially impaired friends.  She is set to have a quiet and inconsequential life.  But one day her life is thrown into upheaval when her grandmother arrives.  She has never met her before.When Grandma arrives it turns out that she is more than just a grandmother, she is the Queen of Genovia.  And she has news; Mia is the sole heir to the throne.  And she is going to go through a royal makeover for a reception that will announce her to the world. (This is very predictable but still funny.)At first Mia tries to hide her royal secret from everyone.  First her friends find out then the news breaks and everyone finds out.  This turns her from social outcast to the most popular girl at school.  And the dreamboat that she fantasizes over now is after her.  This is where the movie gets very predictable with an ending that is even more predictable.This is a charming film and is a great family film.The quality of the film is Julie Andrews.  She takes a role that could be minor or trivial and shows the star quality that she has.  She was even mentioned as a longshot supporting actress Oscar nominee - and that would have been justified.Anne Hathaway makes a great debut as Mia but at times shows her naivety in the early scenes with Julie.  But in the end she shows her ability to be a future star.Hector Elizondo once again shows why he is a great movie character actor.  He is polished and makes the perfect number two man.Garry Marshall started in sitcoms like The Odd Couple and Happy Days but transferred to movies with ease.  This is the first film in which he shows some of his old sitcom tendencies but you can overlook it in the end.DVD EXTRAS:A New Princess Featurette - making of featurette with interviews by producers Debra Martin Chase and Whitney Houston, director Garry Marshall, actors Anne Hathaway, Heather Matarazzo, Mandy MooreDeleted Scenes with Introduction by Garry Marshall - 8 deleted scenes with commentaryAudio Commentary by Garry MarshallAudio Commentary by Julie Andrews and Anne HathawayMusic Videos - Miracles Happen by Myra and Supergirl by Krystal Harris",4,Julie Returns to Disney,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2478,"['earliest', 'movie', 'memories', 'are', 'seeing', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Sound', 'Music', 'So', 'might', 'guess', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'Julie', 'return', 'studio', 'made', 'famous.Mia', 'Termopolis', 'average', 'teenager', 'trying', 'survive', 'high', 'school', 'old', 'fire', 'house', 'probably', 'one', 'Herbie', 'Rides', 'Again', 'own', 'socially', 'impaired', 'friends', 'set', 'have', 'quiet', 'inconsequential', 'life', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'thrown', 'upheaval', 'when', 'grandmother', 'never', 'met', 'before.When', 'Grandma', 'out', 'more', 'just', 'grandmother', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'news', 'Mia', 'sole', 'heir', 'throne', 'going', 'go', 'royal', 'makeover', 'reception', 'will', 'announce', 'world', 'very', 'predictable', 'still', 'funny', 'first', 'Mia', 'tries', 'hide', 'royal', 'secret', 'everyone', 'First', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'then', 'news', 'breaks', 'everyone', 'out', 'social', 'outcast', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'dreamboat', 'now', 'where', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'predictable.This', 'charming', 'film', 'great', 'family', 'film.The', 'quality', 'film', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'role', 'could', 'be', 'minor', 'trivial', 'star', 'quality', 'was', 'even', 'mentioned', 'longshot', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'justified.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'great', 'debut', 'Mia', 'times', 'naivety', 'early', 'scenes', 'Julie', 'end', 'ability', 'be', 'future', 'star.Hector', 'Elizondo', 'once', 'again', 'why', 'great', 'movie', 'character', 'actor', 'polished', 'perfect', 'number', 'two', 'man.Garry', 'Marshall', 'started', 'sitcoms', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'Happy', 'Days', 'transferred', 'movies', 'ease', 'first', 'film', 'old', 'sitcom', 'tendencies', 'can', 'overlook', 'end.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'New', 'Princess', 'Featurette', 'making', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'producers', 'Debra', 'Martin', 'Chase', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'actors', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Mandy', 'MooreDeleted', 'Scenes', 'Introduction', 'Garry', 'Marshall', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentaryAudio', 'Commentary', 'Garry', 'MarshallAudio', 'Commentary', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Anne', 'HathawayMusic', 'Videos', 'Miracles', 'Happen', 'Myra', 'Supergirl', 'Krystal', 'Harris']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

The basic storyline has Mia (Anne Hathaway), an unpopular (to put in mildly) school girl finding out that she's the heir to the throne of a small European kingdom when her long-lost grandmother (the legendary Julie Andrews!!!) shows up to claim her for the throne.The rest of the movie basically shows Mia taking the hilarious steps to refine and (physically and socially) transform herself for the throne while she tries to survive the tenth grade, find the right boyfriend and battle off the paparazzi.  While the plot may sound clich&eacute;, the movie really is a great flick taking you back to those less than secure days of high school.  You'll really feel for Mia as she battles her own self-doubts, feelings, emotions and those sometimes cruel classmates of hers (including pop superstar Mandy Moore).Highlights:- The first state dinner!!!- Beating the ticket!!!- Those high school adventures...- The hilarious lessons in etiquette...- The makeover...- A young girl finds herself!!!The best scenes in the movie for me were the ""State Dinner"" and the part where they tried to beat a ticket from a cop.THE DVD FEATURES:Overall, Princess Diaries DVD is basically a great representative of what most DVD movies SHOULD be like as it is just chalked full of great extras.1. 8 deleted scenes from the movie, including commentary from director Gary Marshall introducing each scene and then subsequently explaining why they were cut from the movie.  GREAT extra.2. Behind-the-scenes documentary/featurette ""A New Princess.""  Truly one of the better behind-the-scenes documentaries I've seen with tons of cast and crew interviews, including looks at the different cast members and why they were cast for their specific roles.  You'll get to see a lot of the cast interaction including a cast and crew party.3. Two music videos including Myra's ""Miracles Happen"" and Krystal Harris' ""Supergirl.""  These were cool...4. TWO OPTIONAL AUDIO COMMENTARIES:  One from Gary Marshall and one from Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews.  The commentaries actually run throughout the movie where they explain and give their thoughts on each scene.Summed up, this is basically a really, really good DVD and definitely a must-see if you really liked the movie.  Disney's done a great job on it.Overall, if you dig those ""teen/chick"" types of movies, you'll go for this one.  I'd equate this to a cross between ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Never Been Kissed.""  It's a fun movie to kill a few hours with or to catch while on a date.

543334,A2SETXU4UY67C9,B00003CY5U,"Ms Diva ""cycworker""","[1, 1]","The movie The Princess Diaries is based on a novel by Meg Cabot. It's about a teen named Mia who finds out she is a princess.Mia is most definitely NOT a member of the ""in"" crowd at her school. In fact, her goal is simply to survive, pass gym class and remain anonymous. There's something about Mia's experiences in school that I think most of us can relate to, whether it's having a crush on the school jock while the right guy is under your nose, or just the trials and tribulations of gym class.The best part of this movie is the impeccable casting, particularly in the principal roles. Anne Hathaway is a major find. I didn't even care that she is clearly not 15, because she so immersed herself in the part that, frankly, I forgot she's 21. She was clearly having a ball. She shows major promise as both a comedic and a dramatic actress. She really captured Mia's ambivalence about being royalty.  Best of all, she didn't seem to be intimidated by the incomparable Julie Andrews. Andrews was, as always, brilliant. She had just the right note of awkwardness as Clarisse stopped being the Queen of Genovia and started being Mia's grandmother.Hector Elizondo took what could've been a small throwaway part and made himself integral to the movie. He and Andrews had a nice chemistry, and I wish I had seen more of the romance between their characters. In terms of the supporting players, I thought Heather Matarazzo (as Lily, Mia's best friend) and Robert Schwartzman (as Michael, Lily's brother, who secretly has a crush on Mia) were terrific. These actors rose about the stereotypical way their characters were written to capture the fear their characters were feeling as they sensed Mia slipping away to join the popular crowd.There were problems with the film, like the pace. It was slow at times, and I think it could've been shorter. Because of that problem the film seemed choppy at times. I would've loved to have seen more scenes of Andrews teaching Hathaway's Mia how to be regal. In general, some of the school scenes were repetitive. These could've been cut, and some of the more interesting subplots (the one with the Baron/Baroness, the hinted at romance between Joe and Clarisse) could have been developed, which would've made it easier to accept the film's length.Despite these few flaws, I think this is a wonderful movie and I highly reccommend it.",5,"Fun, charming family entertainment",1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,2368,"['movie', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'based', 'novel', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'teen', 'named', 'Mia', 'who', 'out', 'princess.Mia', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'member', 'crowd', 'school', 'fact', 'goal', 'simply', 'survive', 'pass', 'gym', 'class', 'remain', 'anonymous', 'something', 'Mia', 'experiences', 'school', 'think', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'having', 'crush', 'school', 'jock', 'right', 'guy', 'nose', 'just', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'gym', 'class.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'impeccable', 'casting', 'particularly', 'principal', 'roles', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'major', 'find', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'clearly', 'not', '15', 'so', 'immersed', 'part', 'frankly', 'forgot', '21', 'was', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'major', 'promise', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'really', 'captured', 'Mia', 'ambivalence', 'being', 'royalty', 'Best', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'intimidated', 'incomparable', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Andrews', 'was', 'always', 'brilliant', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'awkwardness', 'Clarisse', 'stopped', 'being', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'started', 'being', 'Mia', 'grandmother.Hector', 'Elizondo', 'took', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'small', 'throwaway', 'part', 'made', 'integral', 'movie', 'Andrews', 'had', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'more', 'romance', 'characters', 'terms', 'supporting', 'players', 'thought', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Lily', 'Mia', 'best', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'Michael', 'Lily', 'brother', 'who', 'secretly', 'crush', 'Mia', 'were', 'terrific', 'actors', 'rose', 'stereotypical', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'capture', 'fear', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'sensed', 'Mia', 'slipping', 'away', 'join', 'popular', 'crowd.There', 'were', 'problems', 'film', 'pace', 'was', 'slow', 'times', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shorter', 'problem', 'film', 'seemed', 'choppy', 'times', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'scenes', 'Andrews', 'teaching', 'Hathaway', 'Mia', 'how', 'be', 'regal', 'general', 'school', 'scenes', 'were', 'repetitive', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'more', 'interesting', 'subplots', 'one', 'Baron/Baroness', 'hinted', 'romance', 'Joe', 'Clarisse', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'easier', 'accept', 'film', 'length.Despite', 'few', 'flaws', 'think', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'reccommend']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Katz ""NancyK18""","[3, 3]","I may be a sentimentalist at heart and prefer sappy movies to violent movies, but as a grown woman I loved the movie The Princess Diaries based on the book by Meg Cabot.  This was one of the most delightful movies I've seen in a long time and a welcome antidote to the current movie fare as well as national News.  The cast, which includes Julie Andrews, Hector Elizondo and Anne Hathaway as the unkempt young woman who becomes a princess, is absolutely perfect.  And any opportunity to see Julie Andrews as the Queen and Hector Elizondo in the same movie is cause for a celebration.  Some may even see Mr. Elizondo's role in The Princess Diaries as a bit similar to the one he played in Pretty Woman.Mia Thermapolis is a young woman living in San Francisco with her mother who is an artist.  She's a 9th graders who complains about being too tall, having curly hair, feels awkward around boys and worries that she may never be kissed by a boy.  She doesn't' think her life could ever be more complicated until she meets an elegant woman who tells Mia that her father was the Prince of Genovia and that she is his heir and a princess.  And this woman should know since she's not only Mia's grandmother but the Queen of Genovia.  At this point the viewer may wonder why Mia never knew this before but I was so taken in with this film I didn't bother thinking about this for too long.Now the fun begins as Mia must shed her 9th grade poor self- image and learns to become a princess under the tutelage of her grandmother and Hector Elizondo.  Throughout the movie we are treated to wonderful scenes of Mia learning how to behave like a princess to dealing with her schoolmates who suddenly notice Mia, as they never did in the past.  Perhaps my favorite scene is when Mia, after giving serious consideration to what her life will be like in the future, is presented to society as a princess by her grandmother.This movie, which does differ from the book, is both appropriate for young adults and sophisticated enough to appeal to older audiences as well.  And it really was so delightful to watch a movie with no violence, nudity or foul language.  This is a one of a kind movie reminiscent of Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady who was originally played by Ms. Andrews and the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Finally, this movie reminds one of what it was like to be a little girl wishing that would wake up one day to learn that she is suddenly a princess.  Now I'm hoping another movie would be made continuing the story of Mia and her royal family.  I'd love to know s how life is treating her as she flies off to Genovia at the end of this movie.",5,A delightful movie!,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,2654,"['may', 'be', 'sentimentalist', 'heart', 'prefer', 'sappy', 'movies', 'violent', 'movies', 'grown', 'woman', 'loved', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'based', 'book', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'welcome', 'antidote', 'current', 'movie', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'national', 'News', 'cast', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'unkempt', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'princess', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Queen', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'same', 'movie', 'cause', 'celebration', 'may', 'even', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Elizondo', 'role', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'bit', 'similar', 'one', 'played', 'Pretty', 'Woman.Mia', 'Thermapolis', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'mother', 'who', 'artist', '9th', 'graders', 'who', 'being', 'too', 'tall', 'having', 'curly', 'hair', 'feels', 'awkward', 'boys', 'worries', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'kissed', 'boy', ""n't"", 'think', 'life', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'more', 'complicated', 'elegant', 'woman', 'who', 'Mia', 'father', 'was', 'Prince', 'Genovia', 'heir', 'princess', 'woman', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'Mia', 'grandmother', 'Queen', 'Genovia', 'point', 'viewer', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'Mia', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'thinking', 'too', 'fun', 'Mia', 'must', 'shed', '9th', 'grade', 'poor', 'self-', 'image', 'become', 'princess', 'tutelage', 'grandmother', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Mia', 'learning', 'how', 'behave', 'princess', 'dealing', 'schoolmates', 'who', 'suddenly', 'notice', 'Mia', 'never', 'did', 'past', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Mia', 'giving', 'serious', 'consideration', 'what', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'presented', 'society', 'princess', 'grandmother.This', 'movie', 'differ', 'book', 'appropriate', 'young', 'adults', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'appeal', 'older', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'was', 'so', 'delightful', 'watch', 'movie', 'violence', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'one', 'kind', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'played', 'Ms.', 'Andrews', 'musicals', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Finally', 'movie', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'little', 'girl', 'wishing', 'would', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'learn', 'suddenly', 'princess', 'Now', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'continuing', 'story', 'Mia', 'royal', 'family', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 's', 'how', 'life', 'treating', 'Genovia', 'end', 'movie']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Yes, I represent the eighteen-year-old guy group that went and watched this movie. I'm sure we make up about .0000000000000000001 percent of the viewing audience.First of all, The Princess diaries was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The writing was horrific, the acting isn't anything special, and I detested some of the supporting characters. The main thing I hated about the movie was how many scenes were contrived for Mandy Moore just to sell the soundtrack. I mean, her character wasn't even needed.All that said, the movie had its good points (or else it wouldn't have gotten 4 stars). It's kind of the movie equivalent of a kitten biting your toes. It's really annoying but kind of cute anyway. The target audience will love this movie. The movie also has some genuinely funny moments, and some of the dialogue is so cheesy it comes across as really funny. The funniest thing about the movie has got to be the &quot;love interest&quot; Michael's hair in the last scene. The main reason this movie succeeds is Anne Hathaway. What she lacks in acting, she makes up by being really hot. I mean it, she's gorgeous.

However, try to put Mia's complaints of having size 10 feet and being a willowy 5'11"" into a movie. Much of what made the books so wonderful is lost in the process. Plus they choose the beautiful Anne Hathaway (who looked good even with the dorky glasses and bushy hair & eyebrows), who is not a large person at all. Sure, she has her complaints of retainers and lack of love inetests, but the movie Mia's character is cheerful and determined while book Mia is sarcastic and failing (mostly just Algebra, but she's also not quite living up to her grandmother's standards). Another odd choice in casting is the elegant Julie Andrews as the grandmother, who was described in the books as quite frightening, having tattoos on her eyelids so she wouldn't have to put on mascara all the time and being threatening.The movie tries to incorporate too much, throwing all three books into just one film so that it's too fast-paced to really be that enjoyable. Not to mention that they pick the ugly guy to be Mia's crush and the attractive guy to be the one who's always secretly loved Mia. Most of the jokes about Mia's mother dating Mia's Algebra teacher is non-existant, there is no mention of the pregnancy or the marriage.The film also take too many creative lincenses. Instead of living in a Greenwich Village apartment, Mia and her mom live in a refurbished firehouse in California. Mia's mom isn't a slob, as she is in the books. Mia never complains and is pretty much just a scared teenager in the film, just the opposite in the books. And why is Mia fourteen in the books and sixteen in the film, anyway?It still manages to be good, there's no swearing or things you wouldn't want your kid to see.

543342,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00003CY5U,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[0, 4]","This 'special edition' of THE PRINCESS DIARIES, offers TWO versions of the movie -- Wiede Screen and Full Screen.  Each of the two discs is nicely and seprately ensconsed within the DVD holder, and each offers a differing array of the wonderful extras listed on the back of the package, (though I have yet to find the 'tiara maker' and the 'printable room accessories' listed amongst the specila features.)  Full screen or wide-screen/  Take your choice!  See them both, check out the differing extras on each DVD -- and, afterwards, perhaps, give one as a present, to someone else who might also like this movie!The major lesson of this movie -- charmingly and un-forced -- came across to me as, that anyone can learn to make their OWN decisions, their OWN way, no matter what anyone else says -- and thus become a ""Prince"" or ""Princess"" of one's own life!I first found out about THE PRINCESS DIARIES about six months before it premiered, after reading a blurb about it's production in the newspaper, New York Newsday.Being a 'royalophile' from a VERY early age, I was EXTREMELY excited to see this movie.  It seemed JUST the type of movie I would enjoy!Well, it was and it wasn't.  I enjoyed the acting, and the storyline a lot.  The dialogue was unforced and very natural.  The costumes were magnificent, and the furnishings and interiour archeticure of the Genovian embassy - at least, what we are able to see of it - totally beyond reproach.However, the ""royalness"" of this movie was always on the edge of what REAL royalty does -- and has done for them -- even in this modern era.  All too often, sadly, this movie -- admittedly a fantasy -- crosses right OVER the the edge of modern royal reality, into what anyone with even the most rudimentary knowlege of how royalty acts, (and is acted upon), today, will wince at, and sadly be made aware, over and over, and OVER again, that this IS only a Disney movie!  Even the much worse remake of ""Roman Holiday"", (starring Catherine Oxenberg), for all it's failings, DID have a ""royal believabilty factor"" (RBF) far, FAR in excess of the otherwise enchantingly delightful ""The Princess Diaries"".For instance, when Queen Elizabeth II visited New York, (and probably any other city), TRAFFIC IS DIVERTED AND DETOURED ALONG HER ROUTE.  This is probably done for security, as well as for privilege -- and it DOES leave a lot of ""regular"" motorists complaining unenedingly -- but this is how protocol is done.  But in the opening scenes of ""The Princess Diaries"", we are treated(?) to a view of the Royal Limosine, with all flags flying, travelling along with the rest of the traffic(!)  (By the way, it is NOT the flying of official flags that gives an official diplomatic vehicle the right to park anywhere -- it is the DIPLOMATIC LICENCE PLATES such a vehicle bears!)  If Queen Clarisse had wanted to make an incognito visit, OK -- she would have arrived in a SMALLER, unmarked car -- WITHOUT any flags flying.  If this was impossible -- then the streets and highways should have been cleared for her!  And -- was a visit to the Mayor's office not unavoidable?  Yes, the REAL Mayor of Los Angeles at the time DOES show up at a Royal Reception....but this is far, far, further in the movie.  All of this non-following of REAL royal protocol gave a very well-intentioned fantasy movie a sense of reality akin to putting a full ballet company, doing a full, four act version of ""Swan Lake"" in as the ""warm up act"" for a Rock Concert.  Or perhaps finding a nice layer of ice on a basketball court....with confused basketball, (and perhaps even more confused hockey-players who have NOT been given pucks, but have instead been given basket-balls), all wondering if they had suddenly been transplanted into a Twilight-Zone episode....or something.)  And -- when a Royal visits the USA -- shouldn't she have more than just a few servants with her/  Having Hector Elizeando's character double -- no, triple! - as chauffeur, dance instructor, and bodyguard did seem a bit strange.  Also -- Royals are just about NEVER known by their second name!  The reason for this is that everyone is supposed to know them by their first names, alone.  Of course, Royal families DO have surnames -- but these are just about never used with their given, first names.  When was the last time you heard of; 'Queen Elizabeth Windsor'/  No, she is 'Queen Elizabeth of Great Britain', or 'Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Commonweath of Nations'.  ALL other REALroyals are similarly addressed.  Maybe the customs in Genovia are different -- but, since Genovia is a fictional country, calling the ruler of the country by both first and last mames makes it sound even MORE fictional than it could have been!And -- HOW long had the King, (Queen Clarisse's husband) been dead.  At least in England, when the sovereign dies, the heir becomes King or Queen IMMEDIATELY -- even BEFORE the coronation.  Sadly, this would mean that the obnoxious couple who were set to inherit the throne of Genovia, should Mia have refused it, would IMMEDIATELY become -- not just the new heirs -- but the new KING AND QUEEN!  Because having the dead King's widow immediately become xovereign -- Queen Regnant -- is something that I, at least, have never heard of happening in any REAL monarchy.  This again lent a disappointing air of unreality to the movie -- but, hey -- romantic that i am, I told myself, well....maybe Genovia is unique in this aspect, and it is the CUSTOM in Genovia, for the dead king's widow to temporarily assume the throne -- for a specified limited amount of time -- whether she is Royal by birth or by marriage.  ANYTHING, to keep that horrid couple off the throne!  But I must admit it DID take a bit of mental waggling to come up with this ....er....logical//...solution, and make myself believe it.  Even worse, this soluton -- and an explanation that that solution is PECULIAR to Genovian protocol, was NOT mentioned in the movie.  Had it thus been, er, 'officially' mentioned, so other people could understand it, and not just the invention in my own, royalophile mind -- and perhaps, only BE IN my own, royalophile mind, the situation would have seemed much more real -- even to me!And the Queen of Genovia, sneaking off with her grand-daughter, to an amusement park -- without even ONE bodyguard?  Without the manager of the Amusement Park recognizing them, oand offering them some refreshment or a 'view from the top' of the Amusement Park?  Abd.or without the whole scene finishing with TONS of reporters finally descending upon the royal grand-mother and grand-daughter/  This is the difference, I suppose, between reality-based fantasy, and total unbelievability!Many people have criticised this movie because it purports to show that curly hair is not as good as straight hair.  Many people with curly / frizzy hair were totally insulted by Mia's ""beauty transformation"" which included the changing of her hair from curly to straight.  This ""straight-hair is good, curly hair is awful"" attitude, is really NOT what the movie was trying to portray, I believe.  What it WAS trying to portray is that GROOMING is better than NOT grooming.  I mean, HAVE you ever seen a girl or woman with hair AS untamed, as Mia's in the first part of this film?  Perhaps taming her naturally curly-locks to make them look like proudly-curly haired actress AMY IRVING's hair, would have been more 'politically correct'....but even Amy Irving's hair, while not straight, is not FRIZZY, either!  TANGLED locks are never in fashion -- for anybody!  I once read that REALLY frizzy hair could be ""sculpted"", making them into 'topiary' -- such as 'Edward Scissorhands' (Johnny Depp), did at the beginning of the movie ofthe same name.  Perhaps Mia should have been given a CHOICE of hair-styles -- and she chooses the straight hair, so it can look like her best-friend Lily's hair.  It's SO easy to forget, (and many people are just too young to remember), that having CURLY hair was the MOST FASHIONABLE hair to have, up until about the 1960s!Straight hair, until then, was considered dull, boring -- and very ordinary.  In fact, (though her hair is straighter than Mia's was at the beginning of the movie), if you look at the hairstyle QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wears, you can tell that it is probably put into curlers of some sort, to make it curl up at the ends!Yes, as someone who wears glasses, and tried contacts but found them eggregiously uncomfortable -- I felt a little miffed with Mia's forsaking her glasses for contacts.  However, in REAL royal history, PRINCESS GRACE OF MONACO was famous for taking out her glasses at parties and other times.  And, if you look at a website dedicated to being a ""Worldwide Guide To Women In Leadership"", check out their page describing ""Heiresses To Thrones"", and scroll down just a few ladies below Princess Anne of England, you will find a charming, modern (REAL), European Princess, (quite and happily alive), who WEARS GLASSES SIMILAR TO MIA'S AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM.....AND ALSO HAS CURLED HAIR!Gary Marshall is a very nice man.  He proves it by his appearances in the 'Deleted Scenes"" section of the movie.  Only a very NICE man could talk as he does, and explain so much.  i agreed with some of the deletions, but not with others.  Still, it was great to see themes.  There are other extras in this film too, that seem enchanting....  But Mr. Marshall, though enthusasiastic about this movie as one could wish any producer to be about any movie -- should have hired a ""royalty consultant', to authenticate some of the ""inner workings of modern monarchy' shown in the film.  He need not have hired Andrew Morton or Tina Brown -- any Royalty enthusiast would probably have done.  In fact, a contest could have been held, with people writing, 'in five hundred words or less' why they thought THEY should be the ""royalty consultant' on this film.  Maybe the winner could have also had a bit part in the movie!  Doing this would have provided a REAL 'Cinderella story' for this film, and added a nice amount of added publicity!  If any production of ""Princess Diaries III"" ever comes into being, I would repsectfully suggest this be done. ANYTIME would be a GREAT time to film 'PRINCESS DIARIES III', as Royalty is always a topic in the back of most people's mind, but RIGHT NOW -- with the memories of the Royal Swedish and Royal British Weddings fresh in the public's mind....and with celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II's DIAMOND Jubilee not far off -- would be THE perfect time to film 'PRINCESS DIARIES III' (perhaps starring JULIET ELIZANOD, who was so wonderful as the Prime Minister's daughter in the original!)-- AND to hold a ""royalty advisor"" contest!(Or....would the producers like to forgo the contest, and just hire eager little me?

I sat down with a completely open mind, only to be bombarded from the opening credits with every @!^& bell and whistle a gaggle of vapid Disney execs could think up: the heroine is ridiculously &quot;plain&quot;-in fact, she's made up to look like a Gilda Radner Lisa Lupner clone from an old SNL skit-seriously! And, there's &quot;slapstick&quot; that's SO poorly staged, it's unreal....also, Anne's character is very poorly conceived: it changes from scene to scene-in the first 20 minutes, no less: is she a gawky nerd/ a pretty wall-rock-climber/athletic girl? A daydreamer? Super-smart? Kind of not-so-smart? Yes? No? Because she's ALL of those things and more...there's just no consistent character for the actress to play. You might say that well, this is just a silly movie for kids-but there's absolutely no reason why it couldn't have been just a smidgen more intelligently written and directed.

But, now, after I have seen &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, I think better of it. See, today I went to go see &quot;The PRincess Diaries&quot;, and I loved it! I went with my mom, and by the end, she was crying!!! There are funny parts, sweet parts, sad parts, happy parts, and even parts that alot of people were saying, &quot;you go, girl!&quot; and stuff! Behind us were some 6 and 4 year olds, and in front of us, some EIGHTEEN year olds! In fact, even grown ups came to see this movie!!! &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is a movie for all different ages, and all different personalities. When my dad came to pick my mom and me up, my mom was crying, I was skipping with joy (:P), and we both started chatting. &quot;Remember this?&quot; &quot;Yeah... but remember that?&quot; &quot;My favorite part was...&quot; &quot;Well, I liked...&quot; We were talking all the way home, and then, when we got in the house, we were still chatting away! My brother came down and both me and my mom were saying things like &quot;Not only are they pretty, they're funny! They are great actors, and you just NEED to see this movie!&quot; &quot;We're going to MAKE you see it!&quot; So, as you can see, anyone who wants to go have some fun, go to the movies and see &quot;The PRincess Diaries&quot;. Or, if you do not like movies, I recommend the book---&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;! And, if you say &quot;Well, but, I don't like that...&quot; there will STILL be more things that you would definitely, I guarentee, like! The movie is meant for everybody. So, yeah, it's a Disney movie. But, it is the BEST Disney movie! This Disney movie is not for babies! Yeah, it IS G. But it is still hilarious! And, it has great scenery: it is set in San Fransisco!!! It has humor, romance, great scenery, and alot of other good things that would make anyone want to see this movie! And, it might SOUND like a girl's kind of movie, but it is not! All ages, man or woman, all personalities. It has some fun for everyone!

The casting directer did the right thing when hiring Julie Andrews to star in this film! THE PRINCESS DIARIES is about a young modern-day 15-year-old high school freshman named Mia (Anne Hathaway) who lives in Manhattan with her single mother. Mia calls herself a freak and basically all her other peers call her a freak, too. She is flat-chested, does poorly in alegebra, and one of the tallest girls in her school! Her hair is all frizzy, too and she wears glasses. Then, Mia has a surprise visit from her grandmother, who turns out to be the queen of a small rich country in Europe called Genovia, and her father is the prince. But since her father has cancer and can't have anymore kids, Mia is destined heir to the throne and now her grandmother must teach her how to act and behave and look like a real princess. Through all her &quot;how-to-be-a-princess lessons&quot;, Mia gets the courage to stand up to her worst enemy, the pretty, popular, and snotty Lana (singer, Mandy Moore), and ends up stealing Lana's popular, handsome boyfriend, Josh (Erik von Detten), when he learns Mia is really a princess and when he sees how beautiful she became!Like I said before, the entire cast is absolutely superb. I've read the book which this film is based on also called THE PRINCESS DIARIES (copywrite, 2000), and it is written by Meg Colbot. Both the book and the film are excellent! The film follows the book pretty much. The 'G' rating of the film means that there is no violence, very mild-fowel language, no sexual sceens, and will not offend anybody. So basically everybody can see THE PRINCESS DIARIES. It is actually supposed to be a teen movie, but it is suitable for children and adults, as well. It is not your average teen movie because it has some twists and surprises...especially at the end! The storyline and plot are well-done, too. The film also has some very funny parts to it. The chemistry between the characters in the film is excellent, and THE PRINCESS DIARIES is just a really awesome film!

In the book the story is set in New York and Mia's dad is very much alive and plays a central role in her becoming a princess. But in the movie (set in San Francisco) the story becomes much more touching when we see Mia finding her father's letter, or Mia remembering a special moment that they shared.Mia (Anne Hathaway) is immensely likable as an awkward, clumsy teenager, and Mia's school could be any school, with its colorful assortment of bullies, jocks and cheerleaders. Lilly (Heather Matarazzo) is a genius, mouthy and outspoken, a perfect match for too-timid Mia who tries to be invisible. Mia's mom is a flighty artist who forgets to do practical things (grocery shopping, paying the bills), leaving Mia pretty much in charge, until Mia's grandmother Clarisse Rinaldi (Julie Andrews) swoops in and tells Mia that she is a princess.Watching Mia's journey from high school nerd to Amelia, princess of Genovia (an imaginary European country between Spain and France in the book, or between France and Italy in the movie) is a joy. Mia is suddenly treated like a celebrity and her world is turned upside-down as her grandmother attempts to remake her into a beautiful, graceful, politically minded princess with often humorous results. Hector Elizondo plays Joe, Mia's chauffeur who gives her advice from the heart.As if Mia's life wasn't complicated enough, she has a crush on Josh, the most popular boy in the school who is already taken by Lana (Mandy Moore).

But what would it really look like?  The Princess Diaries is the story of a plain, nerdy fifteen-year-old girl from San Francisco who suddenly discovers she is a princess and heir to the throne of a small European country.  Mia, played by the absolutely charming Anne Hathaway, is an awkward, insecure girl whose self described expectation in life is, ""to be invisible - and I'm good at it.""  However, with the help of her Grandmother, Queen Clarisse, superbly played by Julie Andrews (An inspired bit of casting, that.  It is nice to see her back with Disney after her Academy Award winning performance in Mary Poppins.), Mia is transformed with the help of a remarkable makeover and ""princess lessons.""  Mia learns not just how to be a princess but to have confidence in who she is.  Not to say there are not some bumps along the way with mean girls, boy problems, and other problems all teenagers face - but in Mia's case, through the camera lens of the paparazzi.  In the end, it all works out and she gets the right boy who ""saw her when she was invisible"" and sees her for the person she truly is.The movie is family friendly and I would say the story is good for Jr. High and above.  Garry Marshall does an excellent job directing.  I must say it is good to see Julie Andrews moving gracefully into older rolls where her acting talents continue to shine.  As I mentioned, Anne Hathaway does a great job as Mia.  The show stealer in my opinion is Hector Elizondo who plays Joe, the Chief of Security, with a dry whit.  Also appearing are Heather Matarazzo as Mia's best friend, Mandy Moore as the lead mean girl, and Robert Schwartzman as Mia's true love.",4,"A Modern ""My Fair Lady"" with an Outstanding Cast",1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1756,"['suppose', 'one', 'time', 'fantasize', 'discovering', 'are', 'actually', 'royalty', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'look', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'story', 'plain', 'nerdy', 'fifteen-year-old', 'girl', 'San', 'Francisco', 'who', 'suddenly', 'princess', 'heir', 'throne', 'small', 'European', 'country', 'Mia', 'played', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'awkward', 'insecure', 'girl', 'self', 'described', 'expectation', 'life', 'be', 'invisible', ""'m"", 'good', 'However', 'help', 'Grandmother', 'Queen', 'Clarisse', 'superbly', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'inspired', 'bit', 'casting', 'nice', 'see', 'back', 'Disney', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Mia', 'transformed', 'help', 'remarkable', 'makeover', 'princess', 'lessons', 'Mia', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'be', 'princess', 'have', 'confidence', 'who', 'Not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'bumps', 'way', 'mean', 'girls', 'boy', 'problems', 'other', 'problems', 'teenagers', 'face', 'Mia', 'case', 'camera', 'lens', 'paparazzi', 'end', 'out', 'right', 'boy', 'who', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'invisible', 'person', 'truly', 'is.The', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'would', 'say', 'story', 'good', 'Jr.', 'High', 'above', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'see', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'moving', 'gracefully', 'older', 'rolls', 'where', 'acting', 'talents', 'continue', 'shine', 'mentioned', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'great', 'job', 'Mia', 'show', 'stealer', 'opinion', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'who', 'Joe', 'Chief', 'Security', 'dry', 'whit', 'Also', 'appearing', 'are', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Mia', 'best', 'friend', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'lead', 'mean', 'girl', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'Mia', 'true', 'love']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

What I don't understand is this:Anne Hathaway first appears as an ""invisible girl,"" but the fact is, she is fairly visible from the first, and cute and pretty as she is.  Clumsy when she gets attention, certainly; yes, she throws up.  Unkempt hair, indeed; but she already got attention as she is from a boy Michael.  He may not be a hunk, but you know he is a good-natured, kind, and faithful boy unlike Josh.  (And remember. Michael, actually good-looking, is played by Robert Schwartzman, son of Talia Shire, F Ford Coppola's sister, which means he is a cousin of Nicolas Cage.)  And most important thing is, the heroine Mia may be shy and loses confidence sometimes, but she is proud of her lifestyle, and rightly so.  She has a good friend who can understand her; she has a mother who listens to her.  Is there anything that you need more?The biggest problem is that.  To me, Mia with glasses and frizzy hair is as attractive as Mia with too clean-cut hair.  At least, the former is a unique girl, precious exsistence that boys who know difference always seek for (and that's why Michael comes to notice her, right?).  So why change?  ""Princess Diaries"" is enjoyable, I admit, but after Mia changed to a Julia Roberts look-alike, the film starts to meander in its plot.  That's understandable because it has nothing to tell any more.  Thanks to likable characters (especially Hector Elizondo), the entire movie is not dull, but, girls, I want to ask: Did Mia have to change herself at all?The film finally gives an answer -- she makes a speech with wet hair, drenched to the skin -- yes, appearance doesn't count, but we all knew that from the first.  And overall impression of the film is, it tries to make Anne Hathaway another Julia.  Please.  Julia is good, but Anne is also good as she is.  I believe I am not the only one to feel that bespectacled Anne is as pretty as beautified Anne.  Or prettier.As a whole, ""Princess Diaries"" is a 3-star movie, funny and charming, but its charm comes from the place where studio executives are not looking at.  Anne Hathaway is a real find, and she is worth money you buy tickets with, but like I said,  sometimes all you need is just stay as you are.  So, one star goes.Trivia; twin girls seeking for Mia's autograph are director Marshall's real-life grandchildren.",2,Beauty Can Be Manufactured; Charm Never,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,2444,"['Princess', 'Diaries', 'travels', 'battered', 'path', 'where', 'movies', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'had', 'been', 'before', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'first', 'invisible', 'girl', 'fact', 'fairly', 'visible', 'first', 'cute', 'pretty', 'Clumsy', 'when', 'attention', 'certainly', 'yes', 'up', 'Unkempt', 'hair', 'indeed', 'already', 'got', 'attention', 'boy', 'Michael', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'hunk', 'know', 'good-natured', 'kind', 'faithful', 'boy', 'Josh', 'remember', 'Michael', 'actually', 'good-looking', 'played', 'Robert', 'Schwartzman', 'son', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'F', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'sister', 'cousin', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'heroine', 'Mia', 'may', 'be', 'shy', 'confidence', 'sometimes', 'proud', 'lifestyle', 'rightly', 'so', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'can', 'understand', 'mother', 'who', 'there', 'anything', 'need', 'more', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Mia', 'glasses', 'frizzy', 'hair', 'as', 'attractive', 'Mia', 'too', 'clean-cut', 'hair', 'least', 'former', 'unique', 'girl', 'precious', 'exsistence', 'who', 'know', 'difference', 'always', 'seek', 'why', 'Michael', 'notice', 'right', 'why', 'change', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'enjoyable', 'admit', 'Mia', 'changed', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'look-alike', 'film', 'meander', 'plot', 'understandable', 'nothing', 'tell', 'more', 'Thanks', 'likable', 'characters', 'especially', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'dull', 'girls', 'want', 'ask', 'Did', 'Mia', 'have', 'change', 'film', 'finally', 'answer', 'speech', 'wet', 'hair', 'drenched', 'skin', 'yes', 'appearance', ""n't"", 'count', 'knew', 'first', 'overall', 'impression', 'film', 'make', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Julia', 'Please', 'Julia', 'good', 'Anne', 'also', 'good', 'believe', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'feel', 'bespectacled', 'Anne', 'as', 'pretty', 'beautified', 'Anne', 'prettier.As', 'whole', 'Princess', 'Diaries', '3-star', 'movie', 'funny', 'charming', 'charm', 'place', 'where', 'studio', 'executives', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'real', 'find', 'worth', 'money', 'buy', 'tickets', 'said', 'sometimes', 'need', 'just', 'stay', 'are', 'So', 'one', 'star', 'goes.Trivia', 'girls', 'seeking', 'Mia', 'autograph', 'are', 'director', 'Marshall', 'real-life', 'grandchildren']",Disney's The Princess Diaries

Stories, tales, myths, songs, poems, books, and movies love to explore the theme. It's the heart of stories like the Ugly Duckling and Cinderella. Garry Marshall's THE PRINCESS DIARIES (he directed and adapted it from the book; the book is much more vulgar) is one of the best newest adaptations of a story revolving around the truth that true beauty lies within. Mia is a fifteen year-old girl who's major goal in life was to become invisible. Then her forgotten grandmother pays a visit to San Francisco and Mia learns that she is the heir to the throne of Genovia. Mia has to choose whether to except her heritage or forsake it for the life she once knew. What follows is a voyage of discovery and growing up. Mia learns that things aren't always what they appear to be and that you can't judge a book by it's cover because true beauty lies within.As for those who think the movie gives girls a negative example of life, saying that it perpetrates the idea that only &quot;good looks&quot; count, the message of the movie is the exact opposite. Mia doesn't want to dress and become like the cheerleading imbeciles at her school. She would rather remain as she is; a geeky girl with crazy hair and glasses unknown to most of the world, but loved by those who truly count. However, for the greater good, she becomes in appearance like what she most detests.
