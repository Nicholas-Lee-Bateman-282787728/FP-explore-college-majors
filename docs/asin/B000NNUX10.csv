The final movie was not all that great.  I would give that movie one star.  But because the other two were good I gave the entire DVD 4 stars.

1057766,A1SG0EBC86HTKD,B000NNUX10,movieWolf buff,"[1, 1]",I enjoyed all three of these Romantic-comedy movies. Hilary Duff plays matchmaker in the perfect man to cheer up her mom but things get mixed up etc. Freddy Prince Jr. is great in Head over heels even though he gets accused of some strange things in this romantic comedy. In Good company was interesting with Dennis Quaid as the over protective father/boss of a guy who falls for his daughter etc.,5,Good movies,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,397,"['enjoyed', 'three', 'Romantic-comedy', 'movies', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'matchmaker', 'perfect', 'man', 'cheer', 'up', 'mom', 'things', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'etc', 'Freddy', 'Prince', 'Jr.', 'great', 'Head', 'heels', 'even', 'accused', 'strange', 'things', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Good', 'company', 'was', 'interesting', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'protective', 'father/boss', 'guy', 'who', 'daughter', 'etc']",The Perfect Man / Head Over Heels / In Good Company Triple Feature
