Last year's best films often had twisty, interlocking plots that came together from fragmented lives. 'Babel' continues this trend where few films have gone since. Not only that but the beautiful cinematography (courtesy Rodrigo Prieto) and the wonderfully placed soundtrack from Gustavo Santanella (both of 'Brokeback Mountain' fame) are just a few of the nuances in this brilliant movie. Having some of the feel of 'Syriana,' 'Babel' digs deeper. Both movies are grand and comprehensive with a theme: 'Babel' does for communication gaps what 'Syriana' did for the world oil industry and all its consuming problems--no pun intended! If movies are to give us escapist fare or illuminating transcendence, then 'Babel' succeeds in both by offering absorbing protagonists in a tight and ingenious story. Unlike 'Syriana,' a very good movie, 'Babel' doesn't exhaust us mentally. Beyond that, there's no comparison. 'Babel' is a magnificent and brilliant film that never stops fermenting resources.Briefly, Richard and Susan Jones (Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchet) are traveling in a tour bus through the desert of Morocco. Along the nearby cliffs, two boys are testing a questionable rifle their father obtained from a Japanese hunter. They are shooting at rocks and other targets, skeptical of the claims that it can shoot up to three kilometers. The results seem to support their doubts until the younger boy shoots at a tour bus coming on a twisty, desert road below them. The result is that Susan is shot, barely discerning its impact at first. The movie then splits its focus in four pieces: The Japanese man has a deaf daughter (Koji Yakusho) who is isolated by her handicap, and typically, is frustrated by her luck with dating. Revelations are made about her father as well as the mother's mysterious death, which is given one rendering by the daughter, another by the father. Ties are made to the Japanese hunter with the gun found at the boys' home. Meanwhile, the boys' benign action creates an International incident. The Post 9/11 world is, understandably, nervous at the pull of a trigger. Fearing repercussions from America, the Moroccan government descends on the boys' family and community with terse language and much firepower. Misunderstandings are stretched to the breaking point. Back home in the US, the Smith's caretaker, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, cares about the two Smith children under her wing, but she won't miss a key relative's wedding in her native Mexico. Her solution? Take the kids over the border with her nephew, Santiago, driving the way to the fiesta. Her drunken nephew partly is responsible for making the return a living hell. (Things don't translate well at the border patrol.) Then, of course, there's the Smiths, who must break through the Arab language barrier and forget that the Third World doesn't offer the amenities, including health care, the way it does at home. Kindness translates in any language, and whenever it's present in the movie, `Babel' is partly defeated.To tell the details of 'Babel' is a real spoiler, so I leave you to watch it. But one development is a testament to the movie's marvelousness. When we go to the discoth&egrave;que in Japan, we hear and feel the silence and alienation Chieko goes through as she can only imitate others' bumping and grinding. We can see how painfully aware she becomes in her silence as she notices her fellow deaf friend stealing her boyfriend escort. Effective to every detail, the acting, editing, writing, and directing (Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Ina'rrita, respectively for the latter two) make 'Babel' a masterpiece. In an age of instant text messaging, 'Babel' reminds us of our frailty in ample situations that get ""lost in translation"". And a world of misunderstandings can take place with language barriers.

A cosmic version of the movie Crash on a grander scale.  This journey takes us to many different parts of the world.  The cinematography is wonderful and the grittiness is so very real.  In this movie you are not getting a santized view of the world we live in.  This movie is so much bigger than just Brad Pitt.In Babel we are quickly thrust into a series of terrible events that seems to have no end.  Just when you are hoping for something to turn better it doesn't.  From the beginning portrayl of two Morrocan brothers who are entrusted to take care of the families livelihood it becomes apparent how much children are the same.  The wonderful acting almost had me feeling the warm air of the desert as I began to feel if I was there.  I quickly felt a lump in my stomach as the inevitable happens and the horrendous journey begins.  I will save the story for you the viewer but please be ready from an emotional joyride.What I think captivated me most was that Babel wasn't watered down.  It was real, incredibely real.  From the Middle East, to Japan, and then to Mexico the stories seemed almost to real.  Combined with the acting I was quickly thrown over the edge.  It's almost hard to imagine the magnitude of such a film bringing so many cultures together.  Yet it did and it did very well.  Everyone played a part that you could imagine would be real.Overall this movie is a must see.  Don't get ready for some happy celebration that will make you feel good.  This movie is distrubing...and if your not paying attention you will miss something.  Your not going to find much lighthearted fun.  Even when there is a joyful scene a serious touch of reality comes.  When you see children playing a game where they attempt to catch a chicken that goes from excitment to grief on the child's face when they see the real fate of the chicken they just caught.  The Blu-ray version won't leave you stunned for the most part.  It lacks any special features that would make it stand out.  The hd picture is okay but not stunning.  I would say if cosmetics aren't very big for you to go get the standard dvd version.  Generally this movie is worth many awards and hopefully it gets it's place in cinematic history.",5,Amazingly painful journey,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,2288,"['movie', 'incredible', 'story', 'had', 'riveted', 'beginning', 'cosmic', 'version', 'movie', 'Crash', 'grander', 'scale', 'journey', 'many', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'grittiness', 'so', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'santized', 'view', 'world', 'live', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'bigger', 'just', 'Brad', 'Pitt.In', 'Babel', 'are', 'quickly', 'thrust', 'series', 'terrible', 'events', 'have', 'end', 'Just', 'when', 'are', 'hoping', 'something', 'turn', 'better', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'portrayl', 'two', 'Morrocan', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'entrusted', 'take', 'care', 'families', 'livelihood', 'apparent', 'how', 'much', 'children', 'are', 'same', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'almost', 'had', 'feeling', 'warm', 'air', 'desert', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'there', 'quickly', 'felt', 'lump', 'stomach', 'inevitable', 'happens', 'horrendous', 'journey', 'will', 'save', 'story', 'viewer', 'please', 'be', 'ready', 'emotional', 'joyride.What', 'think', 'captivated', 'most', 'was', 'Babel', 'was', ""n't"", 'watered', 'down', 'was', 'real', 'incredibely', 'real', 'Middle', 'East', 'Japan', 'then', 'Mexico', 'stories', 'seemed', 'almost', 'real', 'Combined', 'acting', 'was', 'quickly', 'thrown', 'edge', 'almost', 'hard', 'imagine', 'magnitude', 'such', 'film', 'bringing', 'so', 'many', 'cultures', 'together', 'did', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Everyone', 'played', 'part', 'could', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'real.Overall', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ready', 'happy', 'celebration', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'distrubing', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'will', 'miss', 'something', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'much', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'Even', 'when', 'joyful', 'scene', 'serious', 'touch', 'reality', 'When', 'see', 'children', 'playing', 'game', 'where', 'attempt', 'catch', 'chicken', 'excitment', 'grief', 'child', 'face', 'when', 'see', 'real', 'fate', 'chicken', 'just', 'caught', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'stunned', 'most', 'part', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'hd', 'picture', 'okay', 'not', 'stunning', 'would', 'say', 'cosmetics', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'big', 'go', 'get', 'standard', 'dvd', 'version', 'Generally', 'movie', 'worth', 'many', 'awards', 'hopefully', 'place', 'cinematic', 'history']",N/A
1044453,A3T769B249IZIT,B000MCH5P4,Adam Pierson,"[32, 56]","There are so many things wrong with this movie that I find it hard to understand the number of positive reviews. This is mediocrity trying to pass as an enlightened film on how we are all connected and the global consequences of our actions. Every parent in this film was beyond irresponsible and should have had their children taken away from them.I'm suppose to believe that a well-off American couple deserts their also grieving young children to go to Morocco for ""alone time"" to recover from the Sudden Infant Death of their youngest child (talk about the me generation)? That this couple would leave their kids alone for weeks with the nanny (an illegal immigrant, day care provider)? That's just one of the many far-fetched steps that are used to force this movie along.The shooting of Cate Blanchet's character was messed up.  Where was the continuity manager for the movie?  She was sitting on the driver's side of the bus, yet she was shot by a bullet fired from the opposite side of the bus. However, it is shown as if the bullet comes in her side of the window (this is cartoon physics where the bullet magically goes around the object). From the angle that the kid's fired the rifle, the bullet would have gone in the front or the front side opposite the driver and oppostie where Cate was sitting.  Based on where the bullet came in the bus, the local police should have been looking at the hillside area on the left side of the bus, but they still managed to find the shell casings high on a hill in a large landscape of desert, in just a short time.  This can only happen in a movie.  She was hurt so badly that her husband, Brad Pitt, (in yet another one-two note acting job) tried to keep the bus in the small town rather than try to reach a hospital. Yet she was well enough to talk and move around some before the helicopter finally showed up many hours after she could have been at the hospital. Also, was it because they were Americans that the shooting was tagged immediately as a terrorist event? Would that have been the case if the Australians or Germans on the bus had been shot?  This whole setup reeked of ""the ugly American"".If one believes the premise of this movie that all the characters are tied together by the rifle, then Chieko's mother, who committed suicide by shooting herself, probably did so with the ill-fated rifle because of incest between the father and daughter (implied in the final scenes of the movie).  The father abandon's his daughter in her grief and goes to Morocco to shoot big-game (do they have any in Morocco) and leaves the rifle behind as a gift to his guide precipitating the events that bring all the families together. The guide sells the rifle to his friend for what seems like an extreme amount of money considering the circumstances in which they live.Once the kids have the rifle, they use it for what are the only believable sections of the movie.  They are told to shoot jackals to protect the family's most important possession, the goat herd.  Instead, being kids, they start shooting at rocks etc and aim at the bus because they don't believe the bullets can go that far.  Then they hide the gun and act like typical kids who have screwed up.In the mean time, even with the mother having been shot and the father calling and telling the nanny (Amelia) to stay with the kids, she decides to take them to Mexico for her son's wedding in the car driven by her clearly irresponsible nephew. Instead of staying after the wedding for a reasonable time and letting the nephew sober up, they all get back in the car and end up in trouble at the border.  Amelia then makes every imaginable mistake, putting herself and the kids in life threatening situations, only to end up deported and no longer able to see the kids she claims (strongly) to the border patrol, that she loves.This movie was an endless stream of improbable and impossible events meant to garner sympathy from the audience. It failed.  Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett, both of whom are outstanding actors, were wasted; anyone could have played their parts.If you want a movie that shows how actions have global consequences see ""Syriana"". If you want a movie that makes a statement, see ""Thank You For Smoking"". If you want an Indie film that will make you think, see anything by Charlie Kaufmann.",1,How does such mediocrity get 7 Academy Nominations?,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,4334,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'number', 'positive', 'reviews', 'mediocrity', 'trying', 'pass', 'enlightened', 'film', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'global', 'consequences', 'actions', 'parent', 'film', 'was', 'irresponsible', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'children', 'taken', 'away', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'suppose', 'believe', 'well-off', 'American', 'couple', 'deserts', 'also', 'grieving', 'young', 'children', 'go', 'Morocco', 'alone', 'time', 'recover', 'Sudden', 'Infant', 'Death', 'youngest', 'child', 'talk', 'generation', 'couple', 'would', 'leave', 'kids', 'alone', 'weeks', 'nanny', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'day', 'care', 'provider', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'far-fetched', 'steps', 'are', 'used', 'force', 'movie', 'shooting', 'Cate', 'Blanchet', 'character', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'Where', 'was', 'continuity', 'manager', 'movie', 'was', 'sitting', 'driver', 'side', 'bus', 'yet', 'was', 'shot', 'bullet', 'fired', 'opposite', 'side', 'bus', 'However', 'shown', 'bullet', 'side', 'window', 'cartoon', 'physics', 'where', 'bullet', 'magically', 'object', 'angle', 'kid', 'fired', 'rifle', 'bullet', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'front', 'front', 'side', 'driver', 'oppostie', 'where', 'Cate', 'was', 'sitting', 'Based', 'where', 'bullet', 'came', 'bus', 'local', 'police', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'hillside', 'area', 'left', 'side', 'bus', 'still', 'managed', 'find', 'shell', 'casings', 'high', 'hill', 'large', 'landscape', 'desert', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'can', 'only', 'happen', 'movie', 'was', 'hurt', 'so', 'badly', 'husband', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'yet', 'one-two', 'note', 'acting', 'job', 'tried', 'keep', 'bus', 'small', 'town', 'rather', 'try', 'reach', 'hospital', 'was', 'well', 'enough', 'talk', 'move', 'around', 'helicopter', 'finally', 'showed', 'up', 'many', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hospital', 'Also', 'was', 'were', 'Americans', 'shooting', 'was', 'tagged', 'immediately', 'terrorist', 'event', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'Australians', 'Germans', 'bus', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'whole', 'setup', 'reeked', 'ugly', 'American', 'one', 'premise', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'rifle', 'then', 'Chieko', 'mother', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'shooting', 'probably', 'did', 'so', 'ill-fated', 'rifle', 'incest', 'father', 'daughter', 'implied', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'father', 'abandon', 'daughter', 'grief', 'Morocco', 'shoot', 'big-game', 'do', 'have', 'Morocco', 'rifle', 'gift', 'guide', 'precipitating', 'events', 'bring', 'families', 'together', 'guide', 'rifle', 'friend', 'what', 'extreme', 'amount', 'money', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'live.Once', 'kids', 'have', 'rifle', 'use', 'what', 'are', 'only', 'believable', 'sections', 'movie', 'are', 'told', 'shoot', 'jackals', 'protect', 'family', 'most', 'important', 'possession', 'goat', 'herd', 'Instead', 'being', 'kids', 'start', 'shooting', 'rocks', 'etc', 'aim', 'bus', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'bullets', 'can', 'go', 'far', 'Then', 'hide', 'gun', 'act', 'typical', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'screwed', 'mean', 'time', 'even', 'mother', 'having', 'been', 'shot', 'father', 'calling', 'telling', 'nanny', 'Amelia', 'stay', 'kids', 'take', 'Mexico', 'son', 'wedding', 'car', 'driven', 'clearly', 'irresponsible', 'nephew', 'Instead', 'staying', 'wedding', 'reasonable', 'time', 'letting', 'nephew', 'sober', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'car', 'end', 'up', 'trouble', 'border', 'Amelia', 'then', 'imaginable', 'mistake', 'putting', 'kids', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'deported', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'see', 'kids', 'strongly', 'border', 'patrol', 'loves.This', 'movie', 'was', 'endless', 'stream', 'improbable', 'impossible', 'events', 'meant', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'failed', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'whom', 'are', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'were', 'wasted', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'parts.If', 'want', 'movie', 'how', 'actions', 'have', 'global', 'consequences', 'see', 'Syriana', 'want', 'movie', 'statement', 'see', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'want', 'Indie', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'see', 'anything', 'Charlie', 'Kaufmann']",N/A

1044456,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B000MCH5P4,A. Hickman,"[0, 0]","This is riveting story telling that doesn't talk down to its audience.  Critics seem to be tired of films that interweave three or four narrative threads.  But that's often how real life works.  Our stories are rarely told in isolation, and, ala the butterfly effect, our best-intended gestures (such as making the gift of a rifle to a guide in Morocco) can have unintended consequences.  But none of that really matters when you have stories as engrossing as the four collected here.  The connections are sometimes obvious, as in the case of Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett); they have just lost a child and are in Morocco trying to put their marriage back together.  They have left their surviving children, a boy and a girl, in the care of their nanny, whose son is getting married in Mexico.  When Richard tells the nanny she can't have the day off, she makes the life-altering decision to drive across the border with both her young charges and her firecracker nephew (played by Gael Garcia Bernal, an alumnus of director Alejandro Inarritu's earlier masterpiece, ""Amores Perros"").  The story that initiates the action is that of two young Moroccan brothers, who receive a rifle from their father, with the instruction to kill the jackals that are attacking their goats.  When the younger brother takes a pot shot at a passing tour bus, Susan (Blanchett) is shot and the complex plot is set in motion.  The most tangential, yet in some ways the most provocative, thread is provided by the Japanese story, which centers on a deaf-mute young woman (played by charismatic newcomer Rinko Kikuchi), whose mother has committed suicide.  Although she lives in a culture that panders to youth, she is both physically and emotionally set off from the adults in that world--including her father--who might give her solace.  When she acts out sexually with a kindly, if somewhat disconcerted, policeman, she finally inspires a response from her distant father, the same Japanese tourist who once gave a rifle to his guide in Morocco, who then sold it to a goatherder with two sons.  This approach to film making can come off as forced (think ""Crash""), but when it works (think the best films of Robert Altman), it can provide a singularly satisfying viewing experience, the sort of thing that both challenges and provokes audiences, and that keeps them coming back to the cinema.

1044458,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000MCH5P4,Alex Udvary,"[2, 5]","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is turning into quite the filmmaker. Already his first two films, Amores perros and 21 Grams (which I thought was the best film of 2003) were hugh international successes, which brought much praise Inarritu's way. His new film ""Babel"" is equally deserving of such praise. It is one of the year's best films.As was the case with his previous films ""Babel"" is an interlocking character film, where we get to meet many different characters, each involved in a different storyline, which very carefully starts to intertwine all the characters together.Given that the film's title is ""Babel"" the movie becomes a religious epic. It is a story of love, tolerance and forgiveness. But it never preaches to its audience. The film makes us believe in these people. They are more than merely pawns who help move the plot forward. Every character gained my interest. I was genuinely interested in what would happen to them.Inarritu is proving himself to be one of the most gifted directors working today. He expresses the human condition in a lyrical and poetic way that hasn't been done since Ingmar Bergman.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star as Richard and Susan an American couple visiting Morocco. Susan gets into an accident. While travelling on a tour bus, she is hit by a bullet. A terrorist attack is the immediate response. But things aren't that black & white. Richard must now do everything he can to save his wife.Adriana Barraza plays Amelia, an illegal alien who has been watching an American couple's children. She has requested the day off so she can attend her son's wedding in Mexico, but, on the day of the wedding finds that she is not longer able to have the day off as the children's parents are unable to come home.Amelia now decides to bring the children with her as her nephew, Gael Garcia Bernal, drives them into Mexico.Zohra (Wahiba Sahmi) and Yasira (Fadmael Ouali) are children who must attend their father's sheep. The father has recently bought a rifle in order for his kids to kill wolves which attack the sheep. Soon the young boys get in trouble when a ""game"" goes terribly wrong.Finally there is Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) a deaf-mute, who's mother died and has left her with her father. The two aren't on best terms leading Chieko to feel like an outsider and seek love and acceptance, sadly in all the wrong ways and with all the wrong people.How any of these stories connect I will leave up to you to go and see the movie but the connection are done in a masterful way. Inarritu slow builds the suspense in the scenes just enough to get our attention and then changes course going to another story.That technique may bother some, but, what it does is brings us closer to the story. He become more and more involved in these characters and their situations.It's hard to say who gives the best performance in the film. There isn't one character who stands out more than another. Everyone is equally effective. This is a true ensemble piece. It would however be a shame if ""Babel"" didn't recieve Oscar nominations for ""Best Picture"", ""Director"" and ""Screenplay"".Inarritu and company weave a story that will touch many people's hearts and challenge their minds. In the end, what more could we possible ask for.Bottom-line: One of the year's best films. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu shows the human condition in a way that hasn't been done since Ingmar Bergman. The characters come off the screen and become more than pawns within the plot.

The fate of the shepherd and his boys (Mohamed Akhzam, Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani) is now welded to that of a desperately unhappy American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett); their terrible situation causes the lives of a brash Mexican guy and his respectable aunt (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Adriana Barraza) to go tragically off course and everyone is enigmatically connected to a Japanese widower and his hearing-impaired teenage daughter (Kji Yakusho and Rinko Kikuchi)."" quote taken by the review Peter Bradshaw from the GuardianDon't waste your money.

When I sit down to watch a movie it is usually to have something on while I'm folding clothes or to RELAX.  I don't want to work too hard when I watch a movie, know what I mean?This grabbed me, though.

I'll leave that to you. You'll find lots of thought provoking material on what it means to have or have-not, when those times occur that no amount of money can fix things, how sometimes tragedy is so near and we know it, desperately so, and other times we have no idea what we almost lost and didn't.

I was led to believe the movie was about an American couple in some Arab country who, because of the accident involving the gun, the husband is trying to save the wife but because no one speaks english, he cannot get the appropriate help, while another story happens somewhere else following the same protocol.Completely wrong.  Everyone understands each other (except for the Japanese girl who is absolutely impossible to comprehend) and there's no language barriers between anyone (the couple has a helpful man who translates for them).Brad Pitt's character had a helpful Muslim guy who spoke Morrocan Arabic and English, the Japanese girl knew sign language and could write, the Mexican nanny could speak English and Spanish, the Morrocan boys had no trouble speaking with anyone else in some other language.In my honest opinion, I think if the stories had been made out into separate short movies, all still connected, but in different segments, with much of the brutal scenes toned down by a lot, it could have worked out great, but all together like that, it was too painful to watch.First off, it's way too brutal. For seemingly no reason, the movie seems to grab you, rip at your heart, only to save you from breaking apart with a minor footnote that everything's going to be alright, then continuing to strip your heart sinew by sinew.It's brutal, but also tasteless and tactless.  First off, we have a little arab kid not even 13 masturbating in front of the camera while fantasizing about his cousin whose been putting on a show for him in the shower while he spies through a hole in the wall.We also have a Japanese girl who is apparently deranged and has no fear of being raped, wandering out in public with a miniskirt and flashing boys at the discotheque or w/e, then calling up a police detective involved in a case with her mother and stripping naked before him.We also have Brad Pitt dry-humping Cate Blanchett's character while she's urinating in a pan and slowly bleeding from the gunshot wound.We've also got the Morrocan kids getting involved in a police shootout and one of the boys getting shot and killed.We've got an old man and his old wife being brutalized by the police in Morroco.We've got two American kids nearly dying in the Texas desert because the border patrol gives up on finding them after a few minutes.We've got a nanny who has devoted her life to the two kids, and has spent 16 years in America, only to be deported when she's discovered to be an illegal alien, without being allowed to recover her 16 years worth of property, contacting her 16 years' worth of contacts, friends, or even to say goodbye to the two children she's loved for so long, just given a snotty-assed response by a snotty-ass immigration officer, ""You should have thought of that BEFORE you snuck into our country [16 years ago]""The stories are so loosely connected as to be completely irrelevent, most especially in the case of Chieko, the Japanese deaf-mute girl.  Chieko's story and Amelia's (the Mexican nanny's) story have absolutely nothing to do with each other, or the shooting incident, save for the fact that Amelia is the nanny of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's character's kids, and Chieko is the daughter of the man who originally owned the gun involved.The stories: For one, there's the deaf-mute Japanese girl who is sosexually starved that she's apparently gone insane, licking herdentist, flashing her crotch at boys at the J-pop, and literallyexposing herself to a police detective and forcing him to hold herbreast.  [...] Her story is in no way connected to all the others save for one piece of insignificant detail; her father owned the gun involved in theshooting of Cate Blanchett's character, then gave it to a Morrocanguide, who sells it to the guy whose kids are involved in the shooting.Two, the Morrocan kids get ahold of the gun from their father who buysit from the guide to shoot jackals who keep eating his goats. The kidsplay around with it, and remember the guide saying that the bulletscould travel 3 kilometers. They don't believe this, so they test it buyshooting at cars and buses on the road. They hit a bus, and obviouslyhit Cate Blanchett's character, then run away in a panic. This starts apolice investigation, in which the police began torturing the guide whooriginally owned the gun and his wife, and then leads to the family.The father discovers what the sons have done, and he beats them, thenthe kids take him to where they have hidden the gun. They find it, andon their way off, the police find them, and this leads to a shoot-outwhich leaves the older brother shot and presumably dead, with one ofthe officers wounded as the younger brother shoots back. He then breaksthe gun, and surrenders to the police, fearing they will shoot him.Next is the seemingly ""main storyline"" involving Brad Pitt's characterand Cate Blanchett's characters. Neither have names, or if they do,they are never given directly or indirectly to the audience. This storyis perhaps the dullest of them all, in which Cate Blanchett's characteris shot, and rather than turn back where they came, the tour guidebrings them to his village, where they sit there, slow down herbleeding, and then wait for hours for an ambulance to arrive. A manarrives to tell them the US embassy pulled the ambulance out at thelast minute to send a helicopter instead, meaning it will take evenlonger to arrive. All in all, nothing dramatic happens, except Cate'scharacter pees in a pan while Pitt's character kisses her sloppily and practically dry humps her, then she is taken out by helicopter and cared for at a hospital, where Pitt's character checks up on his kids and their Mexican nanny, where her story now begins.Now the Mexican nanny Amelia, whose story, I believe, is the mostcold-hearted and brutal at the hands of the filmmakers. She wants toattend her son's wedding in Mexico, but she has to care for thechildren and has nowhere to leave them. So she brings them with her,and her nephew Santiago drives them down across the border, where theyattend the wedding, and Santiago gets drunk.At nightfall, they are driving to the border, and the border patrol stops them as they realize he is drunk. When asked to pull over, he simply speeds through, and tries to lose the cops in the desert. Then he tells Amelia and the kids to get out of the car, he will lose the cops, and come back for him.The next morning, they are seen a dirty mess sleeping under somesharp-looking wooden desert things, and Santiago is nowhere to be seen.Not only that, they are completely lost. She tries to find a road fromwhich to signal for help, but cannot find any, so she leaves the girl(who is asleep) and tells her brother to look after them, she will findhelp and return. She finds a patrol officer finally, and tries to tellhim about the kids in the desert. He decides instead to arrest her, asapparently she was a suspect when Santiago sped away in the car.Finally he lets her lead him to the children, but she cannot find thembecause the desert sucks, or the children have moved. When she is shownbefore a border officer person, she is told the children were found,but would have been nearly dead. The officer then proceeds to brutallyrip into her, essentially saying it was her fault and that the childrencould have died (because, you know, in the desert, you'll die if anadult isn't sitting next to you), then he has her deported, herproperty confiscated, in true ancient Roman proscription fashion, not even allowed to say goodbye to her 16 years' worth of friends, family, and the two kids who in the end I believe still love her. Shenever sees the kids again and is left in abject poverty, trying to findher son back in Mexico who she finally does find at the very end of the movie.Also, people looking to see ""Brad Pitt's best performance"" should know that at most, he gets probably 10-15 minutes of screen time. And even that amount is nothing more than looking somber, or looking a wreck because his wife is dying.All in all in all, I really don't understand how to categorize the movie, or how even to judge it properly, but this was one movie that made me depressed for all the wrong reasons... it was very heavy on raw emotion, for seemingly no purpose other than to toy with the audience's emotion and make them cry.I don't understand why I hated it and thought it terrible, but I just do. Honestly, I believe you should go see it for yourself to truly judge. [...]I have to repeat what I said above: If each individual story were separated from the big mash it was mushed into for ""Babel"", and made into separate little movies, or even TV movies, and released separately, but still connected, it could have worked, and worked great (aside from the brutal parts which would need a heavy-hand toning down the gritty brutality).",1,"After much thought,

Yet, somehow it doesn't quite make it.The essence of the film is that even very small actions can have consequences in other parts of the world.  A Japanese man visiting Morocco on a hunting trip leaves his gun with his guide.  The guide then sells the gun to a goat herder who, in turn, allows his children to carry it to shoot jackals.  The gun, however, is used for another purpose which, ultimately, has consequences in the US and Mexico.The concept is undoubtedly interesting.  Individuals are often unaware of the ultimate consequences of their actions.  The world is truly interconnected.Although the plot is compelling and the acting first rate, the film is not so rewarding.  I suspect that I had the film ""Crash"" in mind when I saw ""Babel"".  I thus had very high expectations.  ""Babel"" is certainly no ""Crash"".  Nonetheless, see the film.  It is certainly worth seeing.  Perhaps few films would rate well in comparison with ""Crash"".

1044470,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000MCH5P4,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","A Japanese hunter gives a riffle to a Moroccan tour guide in thanks of a pleasurable hunting trip.  That Moroccan man in turn sells the riffle to a family that lives nearby.  The man who purchases the gun tells his two young sons to use it to kill jackals that have been eating their animals.  The boys instead decide to shoot at a tourist bus, and thus begins this harrowing story that spans three continents and four families in pursuit of a greater truth; that we only want to hear what we want to hear and if we ever want to truly be understood we must be willing to listen.  `Babel' is an extremely well done film that, while never as a whole reaching levels of miraculous greatness, has moments of truly tender and emotional brilliance.I have been a fan of Inarritu ever since watching `Amores Perros' and so `Babel' was high on my list of films to see in 2006.  Surprisingly it took me a while to actually get to this film, but I finally did and I'm happy the time had come.  While it is probably my least favorite film but Inarritu (collectively) it actually has some of my favorite scenes he's ever directed (especially when involving the character of Chieko).  There are a few strands missing from this film in my opinion, a few loose ends that could have been tightened up; but overall this is a very rewarding experience.  This is one of those films I feel could have run a tad longer; maybe that would have deepened some of the sequences.The film centers around a stray bullet that hits an American tourist named Susan.  Susan and her husband Richard are vacationing in Morocco in an attempt to find some connection they lost between themselves.  Before they have a chance to manage anything more than a handhold Susan's life is put in danger.Back home in San Diego their children are being kept by their nanny Amelia.  Amelia is supposed to leave for her sons wedding in Mexico but due to the accident in Morocco she is left to care for the children longer than was expected.  Finding no one who can take the children she decides to take them with her to Mexico for the wedding.  All seems fine for a time but upon trying to reenter the country she is met with trouble.Back in Morocco the two boys responsible for the shooting are trying to keep their involvement a secret but when the gun is inadvertently traced back to their father they are forced to uncover the truth.  The families decision there after places them all at risk.The final storyline takes place in Tokyo where Chieko, a young deaf-mute Japanese girl, is coming into her own.  Feeling outcast by her peers, her disability becomes a hindrance to her emotional growth.  She feels jaded and left out as she watches her friends date and interact in ways she only wishes she could.  This in turn causes her to seek affections in the most obscene and inappropriate of manors, not ever really understanding the consequences.  This storyline is probably the most rewarding yet the most damaging to the film.  Instead of focusing on Chieko's father (the hunter responsible for placing the said riffle in dangerous hands) the film focuses on Chieko.  Chieko's story is the most fascinating and overall the most emotionally resonant of the entire film but it doesn't fit.  Each of the other three stories are all connected to one incident whereas Chieko's story feels like a complete deviation from the plot of the film.  It's not a terrible thing but in the end I feel like it takes a little away from the film.The performances within this film are all beautiful to witness.  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are touching and so brutally honest with their characters.  Watching the guard surrounding Richard slowly fall away until he is stripped bare of any protectors and thus becomes raw emotion is so tragically effective.  The scene where he breaks down on the hospital phone is memorable and gripping.  Adriana Barraza is marvelous as Amelia, especially as the film draws to a close.  Her final scene with immigration is heartbreaking and so gritty and real.  The standout here though is the marvelous Rinko Kikuchi who is utterly flawless as Chieko.  Her character is so well fleshed out to where you feel her inner struggle and become one with her pain.  The scene where she breaks down after her advances to the police officer are turned down is so painful yet so immaculate you can't help but embrace it to the full.  It is probably my single favorite scene in the entire cinematic year that was 2006.The point behind `Babel' is that we, as humans, don't take the time to truly listen.  What I found so wonderful about this film is that really, other than Richard and Susan's situation, language barriers really play no part in the lack of understanding.  True, with Chieko there are some who don't know sign language and thus must read her writing to communicate, but at least they have that.  No, in `Babel' the lack of understanding comes mostly from the selfishness that engulfs us.  Quite frankly we too often don't want to listen.  When the police are mercilessly shooting at the Moroccan family instead of allowing them to explain and or surrender, it's not language gaps that prevent them from rationally dealing with a problem, it's stubborn pride.  When Amelia and her nephew are stopped at the border it's not language gaps that prevent them from explaining their situation, its blatant assumption and carelessness.  When Chieko accuses her father of never listening to her you get the impression that no one ever truly has listened to her and that's what makes her breakdown so much more moving; it was a long time in the coming.`Babel' teaches us a powerful lesson about relationships with others and the responsibility we have as family, friends and in general human beings to take the time to truly listen to others.  If we weren't so preoccupied with our own interests then maybe this world would see fewer tragedies.",4,Undeniably powerful; a film that will move you to action...,1205107200,"03 10,

It's the path of a rifle that loosely binds the tales together.  [Some of it's a stretch, frankly.]  I enjoyed three of the plotlines, especially the Japanese stuff.  Rinko Kikuchi is spectacular as a deaf mute teenager, and it's a treat to see Kji Yakusho.  [Who can forget him inShall We Dance?] Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu does his best work in those scenes I think.  As spectacular as the Moroccan mountainside scenes are, the passages from Kikuchi's viewpoint are fabulous...as are his sequences that get to the heart of the unrelenting crush of Tokyo life.Like I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga's partnership in21 Grams, Babel is anything but linear in its telling.  Tony Gilroy does the same thing inMichael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)andDuplicity, but he gives you little cues (""2 weeks earlier""...that type of thing).  Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga don't do that.  Until you catch on it can be confusing.  The viewer needs to piece the sequence together.  After you get it, it's neat to watch it all fall together.The one part of the film I soured on: any time Brad Pitt appeared on screen.  I'm not anti-Brad Pitt.  I've enjoyed him in many things.

I personally was moved. I loved Inarritu's ""Amores Perros"", I wasn't fond of ""21 Grams"", but ""Babel"" is Inarritu's best achievement as a filmmaker. The scope of the story, with the different locations (Morocco, Japan, Mexico, and U.S.), and cultures are connected by a string of events (starting with a gunshot). The tagline well fits the theme in the movie to ""Listen"". You can see the many difficulties anyone from any country can experience from a lack of communication in the world and also between families. We live in a world that supposedly has crossed language and culture barriers, but the reality is far from that. Yet humanity still tries and sometimes finds deep connection through compassion. This movie made me ponder this among other things. Some people may think of this movie as similar to the Academy award winning ""Crash"", but ""Babel"" felt more heartfelt to me. Also ""Babel"" was more aesthetically appealing (cinematography and score), and not as forceful in giving a message. I was pleasantly surprised when ""Babel"" received the most nominations at the Golden Globes. Especially with two well deserved `Supporting Actress' nominations for Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi.

I never understood what it was she could not forgive him for.

People have done dumber things. But... there is NO one other than the nanny? NO friends, family, no one? How many parents would go to Morocco and leave their children with only the nanny responsible and for how long? What ruined the movie for me was the sub plot of the Japanese girl. What in the world?

Mad because she is mute? Wants to have sex? Detective gets note explaining???? Dad finds daughter and what makes for a very touching father daughter moment??? The end...  What the heck just happened?

Babel is as close to a masterwork as you can get.  Delicate elements of cinema are used harshly and sensibly; the music is HAUNTING, the actors are utterly compelling and every single one of them -  stars or not - is brilliant. The story is universal and timely.  We the people of this wonderful global community need each other. Every single one of us matters and are responsible for what is going on across the earth.

Babel shows us how judgmental and irrational people can be, how innocence is lost and violence is present in every aspect of our life.I loved how I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu touched upon power and authority.  Babel spans different cultures from various parts of the world and the authorities are extremely dissimilar.

Others have criticized the self-referential aspect in which the hum-drum is elevated to cosmic self-importance.  It's another consciousness-raising festival, Hollywood style, and we are supposed to discern deep thoughts and all sorts of hidden meanings while munching popcorn.  Several in line had never heard the Old Testament story from which the title came, proving once again that we are turning out a nation of cultural idiots. We are dealing here with an inability to communicate whether by speaking differnt languages or speaking without listening or saying things without meaning them or perhaps more likely, all our technology has falsely made us think that ease of communication is the same as the act itself.In movies like this the slightest question raises a host of possibilites. Is it even possible that these worldwide events could be related?  Brad Pitt is still searching for the BIG ROLE, the breakout movie in which he finally proves he is a ""serious"" actor (lol).  Alas, Richard comes across as, well, Brad Pitt playing Richard, which is fine for most of the viewing audience.  One can admire the intricacies of the film, the attention to detail, the thematic relationships (a little heavy at times) and the subtlety but in the end the sum of the parts is less than the whole.  Each vigenette (actually  movie within a movei - this thing is too long!!) attempts a variation on the theme and about halfway through one has an  inkling of how things will turn out.  We are asked to connect to our inner spiritual self which comes across as some global, vague transcendence.The Japanese vigenette seemed (and still seems) odd, out of place really.  The Moroccan story was the best of the movie. This is probably a two-week film since most of the moviegoers will jabber about how it touched them while thinking, God I can't believe I spent $10 on this thing. If it is like the theater where I saw the movie, there was much looking around and asking, ""What does that mean?""

It is not uncommon for some movies to go back in time and then to current time. It was obvious in this movie, not a problem to me. Quite simply, a Korean man gifted a rifle to a fellow Moroccan hunter, who allowed his young children to use it, unsupervised. Then, when he learned the youngest boy shot an American tourist and she was barely  hanging onto life, the father attempted to disappear with both children. They were caught but the youngest was a bad ass who shot at the police and when they shot back, the good son was shot & killed. Lesson to the father who should have taken responsibility for non-supervision and turned in his son. The tourists' babysitter had good intentions toward the tourists' children but, she used poor judgment and came off as hiding something - pretending to look for a permission letter at the border, instead of just being honest, saying she didn't have one. She should have told them why she took them to Mexico. She knew her nephew was drunk and stupidly took a chance, with two young children who were not hers. He deserted the three in the desert and disappeared. She was caught and deported, after about 7 illegal years in the U.S.  THIS IS A MOVIE about all that went wrong because people did stupid or the wrong thing. The only thing that didn't make any sense to me was why the Korean girl was such a trampy slut. Sure, she lost her mother in her mid teens but, big deal, people lose a parent all the time and don't act like that. Why her father wasn't surprised that she was standing on the balcony completely naked - he should have told her to get some clothes on and been angry that she was behaving that way. The girl was just asking for trouble. It seemed to me that they wanted a naked component to the movie and had time left over so they added the girl. American writers/producers seem so obsessed with showing naked women. Anyway, she was disgusting to watch.

1044487,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000MCH5P4,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[2, 3]","An ominous shot in the Moroccan hinterlands echoes in a Mexican village, cracks across Tokyo`s metallic skyline.  Are the consequences of our actions so interconnected, so inextricable from one another?  According to Alejandro Inarritu`s masterful creation, `Babel,` the answer is yes.Few plots are as labyrinthine as `Babel`s,` and even fewer manage to remain as comprehensible and engaging as this one.  An impoverished Moroccan family of goat herders barters for a new hunting rifle to help protect their flocks.  The herder`s sons taunt each other into ever greater feats of marksmanship when a fateful target looms into view:  a tourist bus lumbering up a mountain highway.  His turn to trump his brother`s paltry aim, the younger son pulls the trigger and soon sets off an avalanche of unforeseen consequences.The stray bullet finds home in an embittered American housewife (Cate Blanchett), angered and confused as to why she and her husband (Brad Pitt) are sweating things out in such a desolate destination.  The renegade shot stops such musing short as she slowly bleeds out and her husband`s increasingly ugly American behavior takes over.  An American shot in an Islamic backwater...it must be `terrorists.`As the bus veers into a nearby village for medical assistance, the shot sounds an echo heard worlds away.  Tokyo police search out the original owner of the rifle, while the American couple`s children back in Southern California are shuffled off to their Mexican housekeeper`s (Adriana Barraza) Baja village for her son`s wedding.  Sound convoluted? Preposterous? Unlikely in the extreme?  As Innaritu`s skilled direction weaves the storyline ever deeper, your disbelief becomes thoroughly suspended as the improbable, the impossible comes to life.As Tokyo`s police track down the gun`s owner, his deaf-mute daughter (Rinko Kikuchi in a truly heart-wrenching debut performance) unloads a Pandora`s box of hidden pain.  Deprived a mother by suicide, Kikuchi`s character is adrift in a world that neither understands her nor she it.  The film shows that even when words are clear and intelligible, they rarely mirror the truth of our desires and needs.  Kikuchi`s character is a pathetic case in point.  Treated as an outcast by the speaking world around her, her hunger for human connection intensifies.  She screams for contact, yet nobody listens.  She finally resorts to the only language left her, her physical body, to convey her loneliness and hunger for connection.  Yet, those confronted by her glaring behavior and physical directness miss the deeper message.  Signals are misread, and meanings get lost in translation.  She, like all the film`s characters, gets lost in a babel of words bereft their true message.Innaritu`s film shows a human community stumbling ever further away from comprehension, from connection.  Botched transmissions and fumbled receptions clutter each frame. Lies overlap lies until words are but empty vessels, stripped of content.  In the village where Pitt`s character scurries helplessly, English-language television networks ramble on about `terrorist cells` and an `American tourist killed` (she survives).  When the Moroccan gendarmes descend upon the goat herder's family, misinformation swarms like flies.  The police thugs beat up those whose `answers` make no sense.  As the housekeeper returns from Mexico with her American charges, her nephew (the fiery Gael Garcia Bernal) engages in a verbal cat-and-mouse game with the border guards until chaos overcomes.  The housekeeper, with her limited English, is unable to clarify an otherwise straightforward situation.  Confusion spreads like a cancer and the consequences approach the catastrophic.Despite the cacophony of voice and miscue, `Babel` does not descend into absolute despair.  Innaritu does offer hope that understanding is still possible.  The children of this film carry its redemption.  Throughout the film, they knowingly and unknowingly set right the confusions adults sow.  The housekeeper talks to her American ninos in Spanish and they passively, instinctively comprehend.  In the Moroccan village, while parents and police turn to violence, the youngest son (Mohamed Akhzam in an amazing performance) ends the mayhem by divulging the truth the adults have failed to grasp.`Babel` ends painfully, tragically.  A boy chocks the wheel of violence but not without a horrible price.  A housekeeper saves her charges but loses her freedom.  A lonely girl threatens suicide.  What makes these moments all the more pathetic is that they could have been avoided.  Innaritu suggests our babel of tongues, customs, and walls deny us the chance of celebrating our common humanness.  The best we can hope for is support from those closest to us, namely our own flesh and blood.  The muted, misunderstood teen clings to her father, the hapless American tourists realize their children hold the keys to contentment, the deported housekeeper finds refuge in her son`s arms, and the Moroccan father grieves a murdered son, saved perhaps an even worse fate.While Innaritu`s political subtext may grate some viewers the wrong way (Are American lives worth more?), don`t let that scare you away from a provocative, thoughtful and emotionally enriching experience.  While the big names (Pitt and Blanchett) fill the film`s minor roles, it is the unknowns and child actors who deliver `Babel`s` masterful performances.  `Babel` celebrates those outside the Hollywood pale...the Bernals... the Barazas... the Kikuchis... the Akhzams.  Combined with Gustavo Santaolalla`s evocative soundtrack (a great follow up to his Brokeback Mountain work) and Rodriego Prieto`s lush, encompassing panoramas of Sahel scrabble and Tokyo steel, their all too human portrayals make `Babel` a film for the ages.",5,Speaking in tongues...,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,5804,"['ominous', 'shot', 'Moroccan', 'echoes', 'Mexican', 'village', 'cracks',

There are tons of examples of deadly ends that have resulted due to miscommunication. And this is the premise for BABEL, a film winning (and probably destined to win) many movie awards. Although I think this is fine, I do think it a tad unfair for a couple of reasons.First is that comedies are often pushed aside at these award shows in favor of dramatic roles. I point this out because this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE shone brightly with many award nominations but won too few. Comedic timing is probably one of the toughest achievements when it comes to script and acting, and to simply pass them by is the biggest shame in my estimation. Which brings us to Babel...Although thought-provoking and interesting, Babel isn't the monolithic film accomplishment I was expecting. After its multiple wins at Cannes and its Golden Globe pick-up for Best Picture, I was expecting a righteously perfect film. I did get a good film, an enjoyable one. But legendary? Above Little Miss Sunshine? I don't think so.Stories are about people, and Babel has that and a bit more. Perhaps too much more. Similar to CRASH in composition, Babel tells its story via a triad. The first is through the eyes of Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), a married American couple on holiday in Morocco. Well, not really a holiday. They are there to try and save their marriage after the SIDS death of an infant son. Both feel equal amounts of guilt and blame toward the other. While driving in a vacation bus with other tourists, Susan gets hit by a bullet fired from a hillside by a ten-year-old Moroccan kid and his elder brother. Richard, forced into the role of a caring husband, must now try and save his wife's life while in the middle of nowhere and with limited communication skills in this foreign land.The second part of the triad takes place in Southern California and concerns Richard and Susan's two surviving children as they await the return of their parents from overseas. Amelia (Adriana Barraza), an illegal Mexican immigrant, watches over their kids and needs to go to a wedding in Mexico. Unable to find another babysitter for them, she reluctantly crosses into Mexico with the kids thanks to her cousin Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal, THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP), a reckless man with a short fuse temper. Once in Mexico, everything goes fine. The wedding is beautiful and original in appearance. But crossing back over the border into the U.S. presents some nearly fatal results.The third and final part of the triad involves a deaf-mute Japanese teenager named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi). Battling with her mother's recent suicide and her own growing sexuality, Chieko struggles to be understood in a world that's alive with sounds she'll never hear nor understand. Her father was also a great big game hunter and once gave a nice, new rifle to one of his guides as thanks for a successful hunt; the same gun used to shoot Susan in Morocco.There's a fourth leg to this story, too (not really a triad now, is it), in that the Moroccan boys and their family are unfortunately involved in the shooting of the American through their own foolishness and the illegal obtaining of a high-powered rifle (which was supposed to be used to kill jackals that eat their goat herd).The big problem with the entire story is that it's built on such a grand scale that it just can't stand up under its own, great weight ...especially when comparing it to something like Little Miss Sunshine (which got the audience VERY intimate with its characters). That's not to say that Babel isn't watchable or even good. It is both. I'm glad I saw it. But on par with Little Miss Sunshine and the like?

Early on, one member of my family left the room because the reality was so intense.  I was fascinated because the patina and shine surrounding most commercially ambitious films was missing from ""Babel.""  I am drawn to the reality of movies like this, in the same sort of way I begin watching TV by starting at the top of the cable channels and working my way down to the networks.  These days the networks feel overly contrived and fake, which is why they are usually my last choice.""Babel"" was about alot of things, and it was certainly thought provoking on many levels.  Of all the themes worthy of discussion, I'm left thinking about the fragility of my modern, sheltered, western existance.  The main characters in this movie are all just a random moment and a little bad luck and/or bad judgement away from total disaster.I agree with most of the previous reviewers who found beauty in the directing, acting, camera work, and audio.  Even the extras, such as the tourists on the bus whose growing fear is palpable, added to many dramatic moments.  Most important, I think the movie was able to put us as nearly as possible (while sitting on my couch in the safety of my home) into the experiences of the main characters. Particularly memorable were the scenes with the brilliant young actress playing the deaf/mute.  The sound came and went, the camera shook back and forth in dramatic anxiety, and the visual stimulation was overwhelming, as if we were experiencing what the young woman was experiencing.  I understood the dreadful lonliness she was feeling while surrounded by hundreds of people in the club and on the streets of Tokyo.Now, several days after seeing ""Babel,"" I continue to contemplate the roles played by the various human beings who come in contact with the main characters in each of the three primary sub-plots.  These entirely random intersections have a huge impact on what unfolds. First the unwitting antagonists: the stupid boys with the gun, the ugly men on the bus, the moron at the border station, the drunken nephew, the dentist, and the insensitive, distant father.  These people cause the main characters to loose their footing and fall into peril.Next, the miraculous strangers, who, when all appears to be lost, kindly (heroically?) step between the main characters and death.  The two best examples were the Moroccan bus driver who invites the critically injured woman and her husband into his house while finding a doctor and a phone, and the police lieutenant, who somehow finds a way to be tender and understanding, probably preventing another suicide.Finally, I'm left thinking about what desperation will do to people and how we respond.  The babysitter went to great lengths after a series of bad decisions, to endure the desert to protect the kids.  Moments after their petty despute where the couple ably demonstrates their indifference for each other, the husband does everything he can to save his wife.  She cries - not when the pain gets too intense, but when he tells her he loves her.  And finally the young woman who exposes and denudes herself, in a desperate attempt for a response of any kind from a world in which she finds herself completely alone.I appreciate movies like this where the objective is to create art and tell a story as honestly as possible, where doing so the best way you know how, will inevitably preclude commercial success.",5,Harsh and Authentic,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,3471,"['Babel', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'watch', 'objective', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertain', 'Early', 'one', 'member', 'family', 'left', 'room', 'reality', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'was', 'fascinated', 'patina', 'shine', 'surrounding', 'most', 'commercially', 'ambitious', 'films', 'was', 'missing', 'Babel', 'am', 'drawn', 'reality', 'movies', 'same', 'sort', 'way', 'begin', 'watching', 'TV', 'starting', 'top', 'cable', 'channels', 'working', 'way', 'networks', 'days', 'networks', 'feel', 'overly', 'contrived', 'fake', 'why', 'are', 'usually', 'last', 'choice', 'Babel', 'was', 'alot', 'things', 'was', 'certainly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'many', 'levels', 'themes', 'worthy', 'discussion', ""'m"", 'left', 'thinking', 'fragility', 'modern', 'sheltered', 'western', 'existance', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'random', 'moment', 'little', 'bad', 'luck', 'and/or', 'bad', 'judgement', 'away', 'total', 'disaster.I', 'agree', 'most', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'who', 'found', 'beauty', 'directing', 'acting', 'camera', 'work', 'audio', 'Even', 'extras', 'such', 'tourists', 'bus', 'growing', 'fear', 'palpable', 'added', 'many', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Most', 'important', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'as', 'nearly', 'possible', 'sitting', 'couch', 'safety', 'home', 'experiences', 'main', 'characters', 'Particularly', 'memorable', 'were', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'deaf/mute', 'sound', 'came', 'went', 'camera', 'shook', 'back', 'forth', 'dramatic', 'anxiety', 'visual', 'stimulation', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'were', 'experiencing', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'experiencing', 'understood', 'dreadful', 'lonliness', 'was', 'feeling', 'surrounded', 'hundreds', 'people', 'club', 'streets', 'Tokyo.Now', 'several', 'days', 'seeing', 'Babel', 'continue', 'contemplate', 'roles', 'played', 'various', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'main', 'characters', 'three', 'primary', 'sub-plots', 'entirely', 'random', 'intersections', 'have', 'huge', 'impact', 'what', 'unfolds', 'First', 'unwitting', 'antagonists', 'stupid', 'boys', 'gun', 'ugly', 'men', 'bus', 'moron', 'border', 'station', 'drunken', 'nephew', 'dentist', 'insensitive', 'distant', 'father', 'people', 'cause', 'main', 'characters', 'loose', 'footing', 'fall', 'peril.Next', 'miraculous', 'strangers', 'who', 'when', 'be', 'lost', 'kindly', 'heroically', 'step', 'main', 'characters', 'death', 'two', 'best', 'examples', 'were', 'Moroccan', 'bus', 'driver', 'who', 'critically', 'injured', 'woman', 'husband', 'house', 'finding', 'doctor', 'phone', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'somehow', 'way', 'be', 'tender', 'understanding', 'probably', 'preventing', 'suicide.Finally', ""'m"", 'left', 'thinking', 'what', 'desperation', 'will', 'do', 'people', 'how', 'respond', 'babysitter', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'series', 'bad', 'decisions', 'endure', 'desert', 'protect', 'kids', 'Moments', 'petty', 'despute', 'where', 'couple', 'ably', 'indifference', 'other', 'husband', 'everything', 'can', 'save', 'wife', 'not', 'when', 'pain', 'too', 'intense', 'when', 'finally', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'response', 'kind', 'world', 'completely', 'alone.I', 'appreciate', 'movies', 'where', 'objective', 'create', 'art', 'tell', 'story', 'as', 'honestly', 'possible', 'where', 'doing', 'so', 'best', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'inevitably', 'preclude', 'commercial', 'success']",N/A

The intention being that what we do is not done in a vacuum, every action has the potential to affect others in a myriad of ways. It's a world of endless possibilities.'Babel' does explore a rather fascinating subject matter which in and of itself makes for an interesting watch. The difficulty with the film is that it attempts to weave three storylines into one coherent, enjoyable whole. The connection between the three is ultimately accomplished, but they unfortunately don't command equal interest in the viewer thus detracting from the overall flow and continuity of the movie. I found myself becoming distracted and unfocused when the film left the central theme involving Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and then reconnecting when the plot returned to the two main stars in Morroco.

The problem is twofold--the scriptwriter seems too be far too obsessed with bodily functions and borderline child porn. What is up with the scenes involving panties or no panties. Even a tender scene (SPOILER ALERT) of Brad Pitt helping his injured wife, played by Cate Blanchett, pee turns slightly sexual the way the scene is written/shot.Also, near as I can tell the movie wants to say the following:1. Never give a weapon as a gift to a Moroccan.2. Always have a doctor onboard a tour bus.3. When taking American kids across a border, make sure your nanny is a legal alien and the driver is not drunk.4.

The cinematography and acting are top notch. the various sub-plots are interesting and grounded in reality, i.e. there are no overly dramatic events that make the movie unbelievable. The scenery and acting really make you feel the emotion in the characters. You can't help but feel the deep pain of the deaf girl who is looking for the wrongs things in the wrong places. You feel like you are watching 3 or 4 movies at once because the converging plots are so different from one another, and yet, each sub plot is emotionally packed and very well acted in its own right.On the other hand, I believe the filmmaker bit off a little more than he could chew. Some of the extended shots are designed to emphasize the setting of the particular plot...and it works very well, however, it also tends to slow the movie down more than necessary. And since this type of movie tends to be a little slow and hard to follow to begin with, any storyline or technique that slows it even further is detrimental. Maybe more of that time should have been spent on the great acting.The story does come together in the end and each of the sub-plots are closed out in an acceptable manner, however, it all seemed a little anti-climactic. Tough to put my finger on it, but the end did not live up to the build-up. That may, in fact, be a very realistic ending to the plot, but it did not provide any dramatic punch.To close, this is a good movie that is very well acted and filmed.

This film is not only compelling and riveting but complicated as well. The movie interlocks four different stories all rolled into one. I didn't think that the movie was going to be as good as I thought it was. The beginning dragged on a little but it quickly picked up the pace and from then on it moved at full speed to the climatic ending.

Everyone in the cast is fantastic, the acting is great as is the writing and directing. Gael Garcia Bernal as a small time punk with his share of an evil streak is very good although he's hardly in the movie is always good to watch. The kids nanny mexican actress Adriana Barraza and the Japanese girl (her name escapes me) are both fantastic in their roles. BABEL is a movie that one must see with an open mind, eyes and ears. Is not your average type of movie. It is one that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll in the screen. It is a story about humans that experience highly complex situations in their lives and somehow it involves and touches more than one family.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[6, 8]","Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu took 4 interlocking stories, unfolding in Mexico, the US, Japan, and Morocco, to make this film, but there is a communication breakdown, not unlike what happened to the builders of the tower of Babel. Though it had multiple nominations, and won for best score, the sum of the parts somehow equals less than the whole.The stories don't really connect in any meaningful way, and three out of four don't even work as vignettes. The young goat herders who shoot Cate Blanchett are not believable. Actually, they do a good job, acting-wise, but I just didn't buy that they wouldn't realize that if they shot at a busful of tourists, they might actually hit one.Brad Pitt's character is a real jerk, and perhaps was meant as a metaphor for our foreign policy. He is understandably frustrated in his attempts to get his wife to a hospital, but tells the other passengers on the bus that he will kill them if they leave without him. If he is meant to learn a lesson, such as the importance of family, he doesn't ever seem to get it. He is just relieved that his wife and children don't die. Brad Pitt did a good job, acting-wise, but the writing didn't give him much to work with. I never understood what exactly he was doing out in the desert, and what was the trouble in his marriage about? Why was he such a jerk? Why should we care?The Japanese story is the only one that can stand on its own, but its connection to the other stories is the weakest of all. A young Japanese woman struggles to connect though she is deaf, and saddened by the recent death of her mother. Rinko Kikuchi was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress (along with Adriana Barraza), and she really deserved it. Tokyo looks like an amazing place.This film was really a good effort, with great cinematography, an Oscar winning score, and fabulous locations. Acting was first rate, but what was it trying to say?

1044514,A2XFII4E73279L,B000MCH5P4,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[4, 8]","BABEL is one of those films that are not often made anymore, and it takes a non-American director to bring it off. It is good to see in this age of TRANSFORMERS and X-MEN and Bruce Willis action pieces that we can still have movies that are about ideas, not just escapism.The reviewer for Amazon, Sam Graham, is spot-on in his analysis and overview. This is clearly not a film  for everyone -- only for those of us who who care to think and who recognize that lack of communication is a central problem throughout the world. Americans are not the only ones who often fail to see what is going on under their noses, and who can realize that small issues can quickly escalate into monumental ones. A mistake, such as taking the children of an American couple across the border into Mexico, quickly grows into a life-threatening event, and the parents of the children, who we don't realize until later, are Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette -- tourists in North Africa who must resort to some difficult-to-watch crude surgery. That those top-billed stars in what is an ensemble piece are not given the full-focus of the long film is not the point. This is not a pretty-boy movie, or even a pretty movie. It is gritty and real, and all of the characters are shown as having clay feet.If we think that we are really in charge of our lives, we need to think again. At any moment, something can happen which can throw what we think are our self-absorbed and ordered existences into a tail spin -- often because of our own short-sighted perspectives and often because of someone's else's -- wherever they happen to be in the world. The rifle fired carelessly by the boy is the center piece -- the center of the spider web, but the rest of the web strands may seem to be unconnected to the rest until near the end. The story in Japan seems to be unrelated to the other stories until we discover that the rifle used by the boys halfway around the world is one that the father of the deaf-mute originally furnished. Dismiss this as the butterfly effect if you wish, but the connections exist if we are careful enough to look.The story about the deaf-mute girl in Japan (portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi who was, as she should have been, nominated for an Academy Award) is not as separate as we might first think. In fact, it is her inability to communicate with her father and her friends in an area of the world where personal defects are looked down upon by peers that turns out to be a microcosm for the entire, far-flung story. Her frustration is the distillation of what is wrong with all of us -- we don't take to listen to, or understand, others around us. As a professor who has taught in China for many years and has learned how personal ailments and birth defects are sometimes looked down upon as reflecting weaknesses in character, I understood the Japanese girl's painful frustration. Boys ignore her because she cannot speak to them, and even her father, until the very end in a touching finale, is unable to comprehend her needs and angst. She wants and needs to be recognized as a human being, even if it means only being a sexual being. She, like most of us, needs to be understood for who we are and not expected to be exactly like everyone else.For obvious reasons, I did not show the film in class to Chinese students, but I did loan it to a former female student. She asked me in an Instant Message why the girl showed, as she put it, her beaver to the boys in public. I told her that she felt that since she could not be noticed as a teenage girl wanting to fit in with the others, she would show herself as a sexual object, which is what, she felt, the boys only cared about. She would get attention in the only way she knew how, even if it meant making sexual overtures to a mature dentist or to a police officer who comes to her home in her father's absence. Of course, she is reeling from the death of her mother and even makes up her own version to explain her untimely demise, but her issues are even deeper and more inward-focused than that.Even the Brad Pitt character learns that some people, even in a third-world nation, are not interested in helping others for a reward. When he offers money to the man who has helped save his wife's life, he is amazed when his money is rejected. Even in these days of constant terror threats, some people -- in any corner of the globe -- are still human and, more importantly, humane. This humble native of Morocco is not like Pitt's fellow tourists who want to get on with their trip; he is selfless and resourceful, willing to help an American tourist whose wife's life is threatened.That this film ends with the deaf-mute girl standing nude on the terrace with her father is perfect because it exemplifies the theme of the entire, skillfully woven tapestry. If we don't communicate with others and reconcile our differences -- whether real or perceived -- we are doomed to live in isolation.When BABEL was overlooked for an Academy Award in favor of the Martin Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, an American remake of a Japanese film, I was disappointed but not surprised. After all, that gangster film, full of violence and vile language, was more accessible to the American public. It was easier to accept a film full of pretty boys and the scene-stealing Jack Nicholson, people who settle their differences by shooting each other, than a film where one single shot fired in stupidity can affect us so dramatically. It's like that uncanny Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. See if you think we are all really unconnected from each other.",5,"A FEELING MOVIE, NOT A FEEL-GOOD MOVIE",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,5581,"['BABEL', 'one', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'made',

1044517,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000MCH5P4,Chris Luallen,"[1, 4]","""Babel"" is a series of four related stories. The first is about a well intentioned Latina nanny, Amelia (Adraina Barraza), who takes the two San Diego kids she cares for to a wedding in Mexico. Unfortunately, her drunk and irresponsible nephew, Santiago, gets involved in a police chase while trying to cross the border and ends up abandoning Amelia and the kids in the desert. Meanwhile, the children's parents, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), are on vacation in Morroco. But their trip gets cut short when two young Moroccan shephards accidently shoot Susan while goofing around with a gun. The owner of this gun had originally been a Japanese businessman who has a deaf daughter, Chieko (Rinko Kikiuchi), who is intensely distraught following her mother's recent suicide. Chieko seeks to deal with her emotional neediness by seeking out casual sex. But is only laughed out and rejected because of her disability. Of course, this causes her to become even more insecure and desperate.Unfortunately, the stories are brought together in a way that seems forced and highly improbable. The Japanese story was the best and I would have preferred to see the director make a feature length film of this rather than try to interconnect the four separate plots. The title ""Babel"" obviously alludes to the biblical story and the movie seems to be trying to make some grandiose statement about the difficulty of communication in a world that is rapidly facing globalization while still speaking different languages and holding different cultural and religious values. Unfortunately, this point is made in a way that seems all too obvious and heavy handed rather than suggesting anything uniquely insightful. Futhermore, the stories are written with pretense and without humor, subtlety or even a sense of hope.Several years ago Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu directed an outstanding movie called ""Amores Perros"" about three sets of characters living in Mexico City. Each individual story was powerfully realistic and yet was interconnected to the others in a way that was almost magically sychronistic. ""Amores Perros,"" full of both hope and tragedy, was a great film and heralded Gonzalez Inarritu as a major new figure in the emerging world of Mexican cinema.With ""Babel"" Gonzalez Inarritu shows he is still attempting to make artistically important films but has somehow lost his way. At the time, ""Amores Perros"" seemd original and unique with it's use of interlinked stories. But in ""Babel"" this method no longer seems  innovative. But rather just a formulaic attempt by the director to duplicate his earlier success. Truly great filmmakers are always striving for originality and new styles of expression. But, after ""Babel"" and the also disappointing ""21 Grams,"" Gonzalez Inarritu is starting to seem like a ""one trick pony"" with nothing new to offer.",3,Disappointing Effort By A Potentially Great Director,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2862,"['Babel', 'series', 'four', 'related', 'stories', 'first', 'well', 'intentioned', 'Latina', 'nanny', 'Amelia', 'Adraina', 'Barraza', 'who', 'two', 'San', 'Diego', 'kids', 'wedding', 'Mexico', 'Unfortunately', 'drunk', 'irresponsible', 'nephew', 'Santiago', 'involved', 'police', 'chase', 'trying', 'cross', 'border', 'up', 'abandoning', 'Amelia', 'kids', 'desert', 'Meanwhile', 'children', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Susan', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'vacation', 'Morroco', 'trip', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'Moroccan', 'shephards', 'accidently', 'shoot', 'Susan', 'goofing', 'around', 'gun', 'owner', 'gun', 'had', 'originally', 'been', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'who', 'deaf', 'daughter', 'Chieko', 'Rinko', 'Kikiuchi', 'who', 'intensely', 'distraught', 'following', 'mother', 'recent', 'suicide', 'Chieko', 'deal', 'emotional', 'neediness', 'seeking', 'out', 'casual', 'sex', 'only', 'laughed', 'out', 'rejected', 'disability', 'course', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'insecure', 'desperate.Unfortunately', 'stories', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'way', 'forced', 'highly', 'improbable', 'Japanese', 'story', 'was', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'director', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'rather', 'try', 'interconnect', 'four', 'separate', 'plots', 'title', 'Babel', 'obviously', 'biblical', 'story', 'movie', 'be', 'trying', 'make', 'grandiose', 'statement', 'difficulty', 'communication', 'world', 'rapidly', 'facing', 'globalization', 'still', 'speaking', 'different', 'languages', 'holding', 'different', 'cultural', 'religious', 'values', 'Unfortunately', 'point', 'made', 'way', 'too', 'obvious', 'heavy', 'handed', 'rather', 'suggesting', 'anything', 'uniquely', 'insightful', 'Futhermore', 'stories', 'are', 'written', 'pretense', 'humor', 'subtlety', 'even', 'sense', 'hope.Several', 'years', 'ago', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'directed', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'called', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'three', 'sets', 'characters', 'living', 'Mexico', 'City', 'individual', 'story', 'was', 'powerfully', 'realistic', 'yet', 'was', 'interconnected', 'others', 'way', 'was', 'almost', 'magically', 'sychronistic', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'full', 'hope', 'tragedy', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'heralded', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'major', 'new', 'figure', 'emerging', 'world', 'Mexican', 'cinema.With', 'Babel', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'still', 'attempting', 'make', 'artistically', 'important', 'films', 'somehow', 'lost', 'way', 'time', 'Perros', 'seemd', 'original', 'unique', 'use', 'interlinked', 'stories', 'Babel', 'no', 'longer', 'innovative', 'rather', 'just', 'formulaic', 'attempt', 'director', 'duplicate', 'earlier', 'success', 'Truly', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'always', 'striving', 'originality', 'new', 'styles', 'expression', 'Babel', 'also', 'disappointing', '21', 'Grams', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'starting', 'seem', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer']",N/A
1044518,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000MCH5P4,Chris Pandolfi,"[18, 30]","""Babel"" was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had at the movies. I don't mean to say that it was appropriately or effectively unpleasant; what I do mean to say is that I wish I had not seen it. It was a low attempt as a cultural commentary, failing to instill even the slightest amount of understanding, compassion, or tolerance. What exactly was director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu hoping to achieve here? If it was to inform the audience, to show that miscommunication can lead to a series of ill-timed and heartbreaking events, then he went about it the wrong way. This film only manages to depress us by depicting people in unfortunate circumstances, and not in a way that's fascinating, enlightening, or even entertaining. It's too long, too slow, and far too downbeat to do any good for an audience, especially if a resolution is desired.What we have here is a fragmented story of distant connections, told in four separate yet mixed segments. They're so distant that one wonders why they had to be connected in the first place; one idea is incredibly different from the other, pretty much to the point of seeming out of place when forced together in the same plot. Apparently, it wasn't bad enough that each segment was unbearably drawn out, with little dialogue passing between the characters. As the story progresses, its one bad situation after another, and by the end, little if anything has been a worthwhile experience. Yes, I understood that we were supposed to be witnessing several slices of life, and yes, I recognize that it was made to be ""realistic."" But shouldn't such ""realism"" actually go somewhere? Was there really no other way to make the plight of these characters understandable and worthy of our sympathy?I think the best way to describe the plot would be to separate the four segments (I can't describe them in any particular order, considering they unevenly weave together). The first segment involves a poor Moroccan family. The father, Abdulah (Mustapha Rachidi), purchases a pre-owned rifle and gives it to his two adolescent sons, Yussef (Boubker Ait El Caid) and Ahmed (Said Tarchani). One day while atop a mountain, practicing shooting at jackals and rocks, they decide to fire at a passing tour bus in the distance (not out of hatred; they just wanted to test the rifle's firing range). They see the bus come to a stop and immediately understand that someone has been hurt. As all frightened children would do, they run off. They immediately hide the rifle and keep silent about the whole thing, even when they hear the news that an American woman was shot (and supposedly killed).The second segment involves Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), an American couple visiting Morocco, supposedly to reconnect after their infant son died of SIDS. It doesn't seem to be working; it was easy to recognize the tension between them, as was the fact that Susan is deeply hurt over Richard's initial inability to deal with the death. Reconciliation is hinted at on their tour bus, when she reaches for his hand. But then things take a turn for the worst when a rogue bullet hits her square in the neck. Thus begins a whirlwind decent into panic and fear; the nearest hospital is over four hours away, and no one will stop to help. The only option is for Susan to be taken to the nearest village and housed in a Good Samaritan's home. While she rests, Richard tries like mad to get hold of the American embassy. He thinks that if anyone can get an ambulance to his injured wife, they can.The third segment involves a Mexican housekeeper named Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who diligently looks after Richard and Susan's surviving children, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble). Amelia had planned on returning home to Mexico for her son's wedding, but Richard tells her that she has to stay with his children a little longer. Unable to find anyone to watch them, she foolishly decides to take them with her. She meets with her nephew, Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), and they all cross the border. Initially, everything goes well: the kids have fun (mostly), the wedding was lively and eventful, and everyone came away happy. But driving back into America turns into a nightmare. When the Boarder Patrol demands Santiago to pull over under suspicion of intoxication, he speeds away. He then tells Amelia and the kids to get out of the car. Now there was a bright idea: leaving two innocent children and his aunt alone in the desolate California desert, in the middle of the night, with no food or water. Did he ever intend to find them again? Apparently not: come daybreak, they're left to fend for themselves.The forth segment was, in my opinion, the worst of all in terms of relevance. It involves a girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf and mute Japanese teenager who's still reeling over the suicide of her mother. She's become downright standoffish to her father, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho), whose emotional distance is giving her reason to rebel. She's so desperate for male attention that she's willing to sacrifice her dignity. She exposes her genitals to a group of teenage boys. She tries to get her dentist to manually stimulate her. She even strips completely naked for a detective. Why, you ask, was the detective there in the first place? He wanted to question her father over an international incident, specifically the shooting of an American woman in Morocco. Yasujiro was recently on a hunting excursion in that country, and he gave his rifle to his guide as a form of payment.All four of these segments are dismal, practically bordering on melodrama. This is shown through some unnecessary plot details: one of Abdulah's sons is sexually attracted to his sister; Richard gets into fights with other tour bus passengers; an affair between Amelia and an old flame is hinted at (but not followed through); Chieko goes to a dance club only to remember that she can't hear any of the music. Why did any of this need to be included? What do they have to do with the underlying story of the rifle? Everything was so disjointed and off kilter that I felt none of the segments belonged together; they probably would have been much better as separate films (without the rifle subplot, of course). Maybe that's why each moment of dialogue felt half complete, as if I had entered halfway through the conversation.But that's only the start of this film's problems, not the least of which is its intolerable pacing. To say that it moves at a snail's pace would be an understatement. To say that its speed hurts an already unlikable story would be too kind. I only had ugly feelings watching this movie, a movie founded on an idea that would never support such ugliness. ""Babel"" was awful, pure and simple.

They are all connected by the gift of a hunting rifle from a Japanese businessman to a Moroccan peasant.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are a married couple on a trip through Morocco. There is a disconnect between them because one of their children died recently. Their other children are home in the U.S. being cared for by the family's Mexican housekeeper. In Japan, the businessman's teenage daughter, who is deaf, is having trouble dealing with her physical condition, her father and her mother's suicide. In Morocco, the gun is sold to another family. The two young sons have it with them as they shepherd on the hillside. Practicing with the gun they accidentally shoot through a tour bus, injuring Cate Blanchet. Brad Pitt has to fight the language barrier as well as the other impatient tourists on the bus, to get his wife to a hospital for treatment.Back in the U.S., their Mexican housekeeper needs to get to Mexico for her son's wedding. She has no choice but to take the children with her. On the way back that night, there is trouble at the border. Her nephew driving her, crashes the border crossing and she ends up in the desert with her charges. In Japan, a young attractive policeman comes to talk to the Japanese businessman about the gun he gave away as it has now been used in an international incident. The teenage daughter tries to seduce him, one of the many awkward ways she tries to deal with her internal pain.Babel is an amazing movie. I saw it months ago and still think about it. It has two qualities that would normally shy me away from it; It is very long and slow paced. However, in this case, the movie is so well made and the characters so compelling I was riveted.

Sure, that's every kid's dream but these ungrateful ingrates seem to whine the entire time about wanting to go home.  Guess who I wouldn't be taking to Mexico with me next time?  That's right.

Its a really made film with excellent performances from the actors involved in it and a complex storyline that didn't feel too melodramatic to hamper its impact. Its also so convoluted that its point will be lost to a lot of people who get bored and give up.In Morocco a couple with they're marriage in trouble are vacationing when the wife is hit by a stray bullet while riding a tour bus. The shooters are two children gaurding their fathers herd of goat who while bored shoot the rifle their father bartered for from another man. In America the couples nurse maid takes their two children to Mexico in order to attend her son's wedding and end up finding it harder to get back into America carrying someone else's children. And finally in Japan the deaf daughter of the man who owned the gun goes in search of some kind of connection, outcast in her country due to her inability to communicate with others.Thats a basic plot description. With movies like this unless the writer director spells it out deciphering what the plot can be complicated and usually would be interepreted several different ways so in honor of fairness I'll leave that to those who watch the film. I will admit there are several times in this film that my attention was riveted by great filmmaking. Inarittu is an excellent director who gives even the smaller moments of the film power. He's helped by four excellent performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adrianna Barza and Rinko Kikuchi who adds the most ammount of weight as the deaf girl. She's the powerhouse of the film who definitely deserves the acclaim and accolades she's reaping.In the end the films pace will turn a lot people off.

1044525,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000MCH5P4,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","It's always strange watching a film on DVD. Living in a town where some movies never even get shown for fear of no one going to see it (we only have one screen and show one movie at a time for 3-7 days so some never get shown), I go off of what the general public is saying about a movie. Rather than walk into a movie cold with no critic or fan reviews or box office tallys, I see all criticisms and praise and decide whether a film deserves a watch. So we get Babel which many people love while others say it's ""overrated"" and never reaches the heights it thinks it's at. I wouldn't say it's the best film ever but it certainly was a worthy watch.The film follows 4 yet connected storylines: in Morocco, 2 boys testing out a rifle fire upon an American tour bus and the police closing in on them. The one who was fired upon was Susan, an American travelling with her husband Richard and the lack of immediate help generated since it's perceived as a terrorist attack. Back in America, Richard and Susan's kids are being taken care of by Amelia, their Spanish caretaker who, along with her nephew Santiago, take the kids to Mexico to attend a wedding. And in Japan, deaf-mute girl Chieko struggles with her inability to connect and acts in sexually forward ways.Out of all the storylines, the Japan segments are the least directly connected to the shooting but oddly, it's the most engaging. I sincerely hope Rinko Kikuchi wins the award because she's flat-out phenomenal in this. Simple looks are all that's needed and one scene towards the end is so heartbreaking you just want to hug this girl. The rest are equally great too, even the Moroccan kids. The main storyline, Richard and Susan, will depend on how much you can look past the faces of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Yeah they act well yet there's always that feeling of ""wow, one half of Brangelina can act"". It's not really his fault but it comes with the superstar celebrity status he has: audiences see him less as a character than Brad Pitt playing Brad Pitt playing a character named something other than Brad Pitt.For me the film's big flaw is the editing. No, this isn't one of those quick-paced edit films like Michael Bay's but rather it's the way in which we leave each segment. When one segment ramps up in emotion and pace, we skip across the continent somewhere else. That builds and off we go somewhere else. The scenes should've had a bit of time to breath before we're carted away somewhere else. Not to mention some might feel one storyline shouldn't get as much screen time or one should get more than the other. While Japan is my favorite, it's also the least connected to the American storyline while the Moroccan storyline doesn't have as much interesting scenes to warrant much attention. But that's the nature of these films: not enough material for a full-length film on each segment but too much or too little to be combined.Should it win Best Picture? My guess is that the Departed will win simply because the Academy realizes Martin Scorsese hasn't won and give it to him as a ""sorry it took so long"" award but I wouldn't protest if this won. Unlike Crash, which I hated on first viewing and hated when Jack Nicholson read out its name for Best Picture, this I'd be like: ""alright, least it went to a good movie.""",4,One of the biggest surprises of 2006,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3303,"['always', 'strange', 'watching', 'film', 'DVD', 'Living', 'town', 'where', 'movies', 'never', 'even', 'get', 'shown', 'fear', 'one', 'going', 'see', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'screen', 'show', 'one', 'movie', 'time', '3-7', 'days', 'so', 'never', 'get', 'shown', 'go', 'what', 'general', 'public', 'saying', 'movie', 'Rather', 'walk', 'movie', 'cold', 'critic', 'fan', 'reviews', 'box', 'office', 'tallys', 'see', 'criticisms', 'praise', 'decide', 'film', 'watch', 'get', 'Babel', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'others', 'say', 'overrated', 'never', 'heights', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'certainly', 'was', 'worthy', 'watch.The', 'film', '4', 'yet', 'connected', 'storylines', 'Morocco', '2', 'boys', 'testing', 'out', 'rifle', 'fire', 'American', 'tour', 'bus', 'police', 'closing', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'fired', 'was', 'Susan', 'American', 'travelling', 'husband', 'Richard', 'lack', 'immediate', 'help', 'generated', 'perceived', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Back', 'America', 'Richard', 'Susan', 'kids', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'Amelia', 'Spanish', 'caretaker', 'who', 'nephew', 'Santiago', 'take', 'kids', 'Mexico', 'attend', 'wedding', 'Japan', 'deaf-mute', 'girl', 'Chieko', 'inability', 'connect', 'acts', 'sexually', 'forward', 'ways.Out', 'storylines', 'Japan', 'segments', 'are', 'least', 'directly', 'connected', 'shooting', 'oddly', 'most', 'engaging', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'award', 'flat-out', 'phenomenal', 'Simple', 'looks', 'are', 'needed', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'just', 'want', 'hug', 'girl', 'rest', 'are', 'equally', 'great', 'too', 'even', 'Moroccan', 'kids', 'main', 'storyline', 'Richard', 'Susan', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'look', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Yeah', 'act', 'well', 'yet', 'always', 'feeling', 'wow', 'one', 'half', 'Brangelina', 'can', 'act', 'not', 'really', 'fault', 'superstar', 'celebrity', 'status', 'audiences', 'see', 'character', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'playing', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'playing', 'character', 'named', 'something', 'other', 'Brad', 'Pitt.For', 'film', 'big', 'flaw', 'editing', 'No', ""n't"", 'one', 'quick-paced', 'edit', 'films', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'rather', 'way', 'leave', 'segment', 'When', 'one', 'segment', 'up', 'emotion', 'pace', 'skip', 'continent', 'somewhere', 'else', 'builds', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'scenes', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bit', 'time', 'breath', ""'re"", 'carted', 'away', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Not', 'mention', 'might', 'feel', 'one', 'storyline', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'one', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'other', 'Japan', 'favorite', 'also', 'least', 'connected', 'American', 'storyline', 'Moroccan', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'warrant', 'much', 'attention', 'nature', 'films', 'not', 'enough', 'material', 'full-length', 'film', 'segment', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'be', 'combined.Should', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'guess', 'Departed', 'will', 'win', 'simply', 'Academy', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', ""n't"", 'won', 'give', 'sorry', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'award', 'would', ""n't"", 'protest', 'won', 'Crash', 'hated', 'first', 'viewing', 'hated', 'when', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'read', 'out', 'name', 'Best', 'Picture', ""'d"", 'be', 'alright', 'least', 'went', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

1044528,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000MCH5P4,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 3]","With a plot structure not unlike his previous Amores Perros or 21 Grams, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga have created Babel, the final act of a trilogy about the human condition.  With seemingly unrelated characters and storylines that gradually merge, it is as ambitious as a narrative can get, and the filmmakers pull it off with great aplomb.Four parallel stories take place within days if not hours of each other.  In Morocco, the father of a goat herding family buys a rifle from a neighbor.  Set to guard the flock from predators, his two sons decide to do some target practice.  As a tour bus happens by, a single shot rings out, and a careless act will create havoc and distress for innocent victims and have severe repercussions for others.In the bus, an American couple, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), are having a marital crisis when all of a sudden their world is turned upside down.  The tour bus stops at a remote village as the passengers begin to stir and fear for their own safety.  As the Moroccan police investigate the incident, Richard is desperate to save the life of his wife amid primitive surroundings in a foreign land.The couple's two children in California are under the care of their nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who is anxious to go to her son's impending wedding.  After failing to find suitable caregivers to watch over the children, she takes them with her to Mexico.  Escorted by her volatile nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), they drive to a festive wedding ceremony and reception.  Afterwards, they are stopped at a border checkpoint where events turn nightmarish.In Japan, a lonely teenaged girl, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who is deaf, hangs with her other deaf friends and dreams of flirting and connecting with a male even if it means compromising her dignity.  Her father, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) is inadequate as a parent since his wife died under obscure circumstances.  As detectives want to question Yasujiro, Cheiko is smitten by a younger detective and unleashes a torrent of passion and secrets.The final moments of the film are memorable as each storyline becomes clearer and potent in their revelations and truths.  Time slips back and forth and certain events catch up to the others (Christopher Nolan's Momento comes to mind).  The threads that connect the different stories are not as obvious as one might expect and when they do become apparent, they hold emotional meaning.  What is so remarkable is how a seemingly innocent prank sets off a chain reaction of angst and responsibility.The film does not sermonize but rather it presents the events as they happen albeit in an incongruent time frame. You experience life and its effects on other events and people.  The director and writer try to depict people like you or me with the same needs or longings.  With a setting that reaches the far-flung corners (Japan, Mexico or Morocco) of the world, Inarritu has forced his audience to go with him and face a myriad of characters that speak English, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Berber, or French!  Yet when we get to know these disparate individuals and their situations, we begin to empathize and care for them despite their faults or shortcomings.  Although the title has biblical references with its different languages, these stories share common emotional bonds that transcend mere dialects.  This is a film that could easily play anywhere in the world and still be affecting.The international cast melds amateurs with seasoned veterans and the honest performances are completely captivating and affecting.  I dare anyone to pick out the professional actors from the non professionals (save Pitt and Blanchett).  This use of unknowns adds to the believability of the whole storyline.  (It is ironic that Michael Pena plays a border policeman; he was featured in last year's similarly structured Crash-a coincidence perhaps?)There are painful, agonizing moments where human suffering is brought with unflinching, explicit realism to an almost unbearable level.  This film presents characters with all their strengths and weaknesses and it does so unsparingly.  Sometimes the punishment or consequences unfairly outweigh the crime or the mistake.  The brothers who watch over their father's goats must face their own culpability and ugly family secrets that threaten to destroy their way of life.  There are Richard and Susan who are at the center or eye of a growing hurricane of life's cruel randomness and must depend on strangers for survival.  A jaunt across a Mexican border turns ugly.Things are not wrapped up nicely, and several plot threads are left hanging and open-ended on purpose.  The marital problems of Richard and Susan are never clearly delineated and their relationship gets short shrift even as they go through a harrowing event.  The music is somber and spare.  The imagery is powerful despite the handheld documentary feel. The scenes of Japanese nightlife are vivid and disturbing in their portrayal of urban youth.Babel is about how families are torn apart and come together.  It is also about children. It could be your children or mine or the world's children.  There are some significant issues (racial tension, illegal immigrants, adolescent yearnings, perceptions of a foreign country, and the arrogance of the `ugly American') the filmmakers touch upon and you wish they had gone even farther with the material, but you are glad they went as far as they did.  Babel is a film that this reviewer has no desire to sit through again, but having gone through it once, it is a unique, remarkable experience.  This is an imperfect, significant film and destined for major Oscar nominations.",4,BABEL's Microcosm of the World,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,5726,"['plot', 'structure', 'not', 'previous', 'Amores',

1044534,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000MCH5P4,Dai-keag-ity,"[3, 6]","Babel is a decent film but after viewing it I was surprised it received the critical acclaim it did. I am guessing the star-power presence of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt had a lot to do with that. Babel is an often flat film without gripping moments or strong subplots. It tells the story of the interconnectedness (a la Short Cuts, Crash, Pulp Fiction and many others with similarly time-skipping themes) of the lives of four groups of people in far flung locales: rural Morocco, northern Mexico, and the kinetic megapolis of Tokyo.

Clendenin,"[1, 2]","With Babel director Alejando Gonzalez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu completes his trilogy begun with Amores Perros and 21 Grams, and demonstrates just how powerful movie-making can be in the hands of an artistic genius. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu connects four deeply human stories by the tragic and unintended consequences of a random act. In the desert mountains of Morocco, two little boys shoot at a tour bus while playing with a rifle that their father bought to shoot jackals that threatened their goats. In San Diego, Susan and Richard travel to Morocco to heal their marriage but encounter tragedy on a tour bus. In Mexico, the nanny and illegal immigrant Amelia attends her son's wedding but runs afoul of the law when she tries to re-enter the United States. In Tokyo, the deaf and mute teenager Chieko searches for love in all the wrong ways to overcome the fallout of her mother's suicide and her father's emotional distance.Babel (the title comes from Genesis 11 in the Bible) is a cinematic metaphor for our post-modern, global age, ambitious in scope and layered with multiple themes--family, the collision of cultures, poverty, helplessness before state power and petty bureaucrats, human estrangement, misinformation and miscommunication, international terrorism, and fate. Every component of this film--sound track (including an unforgettable scene in a Tokyo disco when the pounding music goes silent in order to simulate Chieko's deafness), scenery, narrative, and cinematography--combine for an overwhelming effect. Give your heart and mind to this film and its characters, and you will leave the theater on mental, spiritual, and emotional overload.

Unfortunately, the only imaginative and clever part in the movie is Santaolalla's Guitar, who has illuminated other sadly lame movies, as Brokeback Mountain.

Creating simple histories, then order them in a linear structure, unite them by a very thin thread and them break them apart.  Then he leaves the audience a abysmal chasm between stories united by a thin line, for them to fill by their eager and more creative imagination with meaning and ultimately link them together, and give it sense.  Assuming this audience believes he's a master that has said little, but hints to a well of wisdom, not said, but in front of you.Just check the stretch of meaning he pulls to join the history of the rifle, which is really about the americans and the daughter of the japanese owner of the rifle that once traveled east (no explanation there) and gives the rifle as a gift .

1044549,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000MCH5P4,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 7]","There are some problems with this widely acclaimed film by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who previously gave us Amores perros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), but they really don't matter because the film is so interesting and so very well acted and directed.  The script by Guillermo Arriaga, who also wrote the script for Amores perros and 21 Grams, weaves the lives of people from Mexico, the US, Morocco, and Japan into a single story held together tenuously by the delicate thread of a bullet from a rifle.The rifle belonged to a Japanese businessman who gave it to a Moroccan guide after hunting in Morocco, who sold it to a goat herder, who gave it to his sons to shoot jackals.  The younger son shot at a tour bus in which the very well-to-do American couple Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are traveling, hitting Susan in the shoulder.  Meanwhile, the two young children of Richard and Susan are being watched by their Mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza) who needs to attend her son's wedding.  But she can find nobody to take care of the kids, so she takes them across the border with her to the wedding.It really doesn't matter how contrived this plot is (actually I thought it was rather creative) because the point is to show how connected we are all in this world.  A butterfly may flap its wings in the Sahara and it may rain in Florida and maybe there is some cause and effect, as they tell us is possible in chaos theory.  And maybe these people are no closer that six degrees of separation, and maybe their voices are babel to one another.  But what Inarritu is intent on showing us is that we are all human and share the same feelings, whether a lonely Japanese girl looking for love in all the wrong ways, or a privileged very white woman in the desert with a bullet hole in her shoulder looking for the love of a husband she thinks she has lost.  Furthermore, the character and worth of a Mexican nanny is equal to that of a Japanese tycoon which is equal to that of a Moroccan goat herder which is equal to that of a little white girl, and so on.While most people admired this movie, and it received many awards and nominations for awards, some viewers did not like it; and some of those viewers vented.  When a good movie is trashed because it has a few plot holes or because the logic is a bit off, you can be sure that the person doing the trashing has been offended.  Usually it is some kind of sexuality depicted that offends.  Sometimes the source of the anger is political or even racial.  Here it definitely could be sexual since we see some under age sexual activity (masturbation and exhibitionism) done in a somewhat kinky way.  Or it could be that some viewers did not feel sympathetic toward the deaf and mute Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) or were disgusted with a boy who spies on his sister and then gets sexually aroused.  Or it could even be that some viewers really were offended by the stupid behavior of some of the characters.Surely Amelia could have found somebody to watch the kids.  Surely she knew it was dangerous to return to the US with her drunken nephew Santiago (Mexican heart throb, Gael Garcia Bernal) at the wheel.  And of course the selfishness of Richard and Susan to put her in such a spot was wrong.  And the pathetic desperation of Chieko acted out in such a blatant manner, as she throws herself at men must have offended many.  To me, though, the psychology projected by Inarritu and Arriaga was striking and largely compelling even while it was controversial.  When a young girl presents her naked body to a man and is rejected, it could be psychologically devastating to the girl.  She is offering her entire self to him and he does want her.  And perhaps the ambiguous question of why she appeared naked on the balcony as her father comes home and embraces her is troubling.  We want to understand what is being asked and answered here.  Something troubling to the ordinary human psyche perhaps.Anyway, do not let the nay sayers dissuade you from watching this excellent movie.  Regardless of how one might feel about the ideas of Inarritu and Arriaga, they are very much worth viewing in an artistic, a psychological, and a political sense.  It may seem easy to construct a movie with a rising sense of tension and to develop characters that will interest the audience with just a few scenes and even fewer lines, but it isn't; and to do it with such a convoluted plot is even more remarkable.So see this for Inarritu who got the most out of the actors, from top drawer professionals like Pitt and Blanchett to beginners like Boubker Ait El

I did side by side comparison, and blu ray is not such a noticeable improvement from upscaled dvd (w/ HDMI).  Blu ray just seems grainier and harsher.  If you already have the DVD, save yourself $20.{{{I see my review above has not been helpful.  Hence, addendum 05/03/10 below to provide more edification.}}}The manner in which the analysis was conducted was as follows.  The time is at night, (room darkened), but w/ recessed lights graded barely hued to simulate subtle twilight.  Several different scenes were chosen to allow a spread of variety: bright, dark, and fast motion scenes.The medium used are as follows: 65"" Panasonic 1080p Plasma S Series, TC-P65S1, with 2 Panasonic DMP-BD60 blu ray players side by side running subsequently synchronized w/ the TV inputs alternating between the two HDMI cables.  The picture mode is at standard settings, not vivid.  All specs pre-calibrated w/ Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray] at the time of TV installation.  With my glasses, I have 20/20 vision.The Babel blu ray has been released 2 separate times, on June 3, 2008; then the reprint on December 16, 2008.  For your clarification, I will include the ASIN # of the one I received from Amazon: B000MCH5TK.This same pattern of consistent comparison is done as I receive each of my newly ordered blu rays replacing my dvd's.  In my current collection, vast stunning jaw dropping improvements have been seen in the following blu ray: Requiem for a Dream, Planet Earth, Jackal, Chronos, and Heathers.  However, only subtle improvements were seen in Phantom of the Opera, Juno, Universe Seasons 1-4, and Truman Show.

1044552,A2PZ1W2Q4JQQWA,B000MCH5P4,"Devon Christopher Adams ""www.nooccar.com""","[3, 6]","Then there's Babel. Honestly, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was gonna be some cool Bible movie about the tower, but then it wasn't. It's a cool concept I've seen done before, and it sort of reminded me of Traffic without the annoying filters and Catherine Zeta Jones play acting. The film intersects three very different places as far from Morocco to Mexico to Japan and the USA. Brad Pitt plays a man whose made some terrible mistake that is never explained and his wife is Cate Blanchett (who I've really liked in certain films and hated in others). She is shot in a horrible random situation that the American gov't way to quickly deams a terrorist action (which it is not) by a gun sold to a man from a hunting guide who received it from a Japanese business man on vacation whose daughter is a deaf-mute who is seeking some affection from anyone by trying to give up her virginity to anyone and everyone. Pitt's children are being watched by the family's illegal Mexican nanny who wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. She can't find a sitter and sneaks the two very white, blond haired children into Mexico. Sounds confusing? It isn't until Pitt's side of a conversation towards the end is the same as a conversation from the other end at the very beginning of the film.Ever see those films that make you really really hope everything turns out ok? This falls into that category, but I honestly feared it wouldn't. I thought people would die. They didn't. Some people will be pissed when the nanny is eventually deported. Her comments that she's made a good life for herself in the US during the past 16 years, and the INS officer's heartless response was that she should've thought about that before she came illegally, gave rise to current Southwestern political issues. (No, she doesn't get to stay. Oh well.) Some would ask why Blanchett (who can sometimes be awesome) wasn't nominated (remember when she won for The Aviator? Brilliant), and my response was, why give some chick an Oscar for spending the whole movie writhing in pain and almost dying. The wrinkles around Pitt's eyes bothered me. I don't know if it was makeup or all the sun he gets in third world countries with Angelina. So let's not be too cynical here. Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese deaf-mute was nominated deservingly so. But I think that her nomination is her reward. My God, the girl doesn't talk and is naked in the film. (This isn't the porn awards.) Barraza, who plays the nanny, probably did the best acting in the film especially as she hobbled across the desert in her groom-mother gown trying to save Pitt's kids. (One of whom I must add was played by Elle Fanning, Dakota's little sister who doesn't say a whole heck of a lot in this film, but does look like a younger, littler version of her talented bigger sister.)This film is one of the most nominated with seven nods this year (I do NOT count Dreamgirls since the damn thing was nominated three times in the same category!). I can't say if they will take Best Supporting Actress, but I sure hope they best lose director (come on, give Scorsese his due!) Should it be the Best Picture? Maybe. It's up against The Queen (you know my opinion of that one), United 93 (just because it's about 9/11 and Oliver Stone didn't make it), a artsy Little Miss Sunshine, Letters from Iwo Jima, and The Departed, which is its biggest contender. The film editing was brilliant (I didn't see Blood Diamond yet, so no comparison comments here) and the Score was wonderful. It definitely had The Queen beat on this one, but my problem with that was sometimes it was almost too loud, too over the top, and too annoying. Although the scenes when we hear (or don't hear) the film from Chieko's (Kikuchi) point of view are done very well!

1044556,A3DDSAGWD0UN9H,B000MCH5P4,Discophage,"[1, 1]","Lead reviewer Michael Acuna writes that ""Chapter 11 of Genesis tells a story of mankind's attempt to reach heaven by building a tower, not as a way to glorify God but as a way for mankind to glorify themselves by putting them on God's level. God strikes the plan down by confusing/creating different languages so that the builders cannot understand each other thereby suspending communication.""Interestingly, Chapter 11 of Genesis does NOT say that:""1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.""Nowhere does the text explicitly say that the building of the tower was a way for mankind to glorify themselves rather than God. It explicitly says that it was a way to ""reach unto heaven"". Isn't that what religious people, mystics, try and do: get closer to God? But we have been so accustomed, for centuries and millenia, to being told and believing that God sent onto mankind the confusion of languages to strike down mankind's arrogance and pride, that we don't even read any more what the text explicitly says. And that name, ""Babel"". In translation the text of the Bible is pretty cryptic here: ""Therefore is the name of it called Babel"". Babel was presumably Babylon, but the author of the text draws a reconstructed etymology from the Hebrew ""blal"", to jumble, to confuse. But Bab-el meant ""The Gate to God""...What the text explicitly says (provided that King James' translation is accurate, I haven't specifically researched), is that the reason for God to strike mankind down was the concern that ""now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do"". Like: the fruit of knowledge was enough knowledge. Let's prevent them from knowing more, and thus coming closer to Me.If confusion of languages was part of God's plan, should we burn at the stake Merriam, Webster, every dictionary and translation and inventor of translation softwares, and even King James and every translated Bible? I've never seen any religious biggot (I know, it isn't the proper spelling, but I like the similitude with ""maggot"") advocate that, and I find religious biggots very inconsistent here.If the reasons for God sending upon mankind the confusion of languagues was (as the text explicitly says) to prevent mankind from doing just anything ""which they have imagined to do"", should artists, novelists, scientists, inventors, architects, all those that for centuries and millenia have tried to turn their imagination into reality, made possible the impossible, built real or metaphorical skycrapers and worked for the betterment of the life of mankind, be burnt at the stake? I don't think even the worst religious biggots advocate it (although, some, maybe...) and I find them very inconsistent here.Or maybe not. I've always found it strange that God should send strife and confusion among mankind (and what it begets, and what the film is about: misunderstanding, fear, violence, war). Isn't strife, confusion, fear and violence a thing of the Devil, rather than of God? Oh but yes: the Devil is also part of God's plan. And what's the plan? Keep mankind into submission, prey of death, malady, ignorance, fear; keep mankind into its condition of mankind, despite the unfortunate ingestion of the forbidden fruit. God is a ruler jealous of his power. In fact he's never accepted to share it with anyone, and unlike Stalin and Mao, he is eternal.Or maybe He just wants to be left alone, undisturbed, and thus closes all the Gates to Him that mankind tries to open.Oh, and, from reading the text of the Bible with pre-conceptions rather than reading it for what it explicitly says, we also forget that Babel is not just about the division and confusion of languages: it is also about mankind being ""scattered abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth"". That too is part of the Plan. Burn Freddy Laker and American Airlines at the stake.I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's ""Babel"" is a powerful film. Maybe it is a film ""about"" the difficulty to communicate - a nowhere more than in its ""Japan"" thread, with its deaf-mute heroin. But other than that it is not the theme I find the most prominent. It is also, evidentely, a film about mankind being scattered on the surface of the earth (and as close as San Diego to Tijuana can be as far as Morocco from Tokyo), about borders and crossing them.Some negative commentators seem to think that it rambles, that its four threads are only loosely connected. Well - maybe, but if so, it is just like life itself. It is NOT always the mechanical unfolding of a preconceived and tightly-wrought plan. It rambles and glides along sinuous roads, as the touring bus on the small Moroccan mountain road, it takes its time and feasts as in a Mexican wedding, but that's only the spring slowly winding up (and you know it is winding up, which fills even these scenes with breathless tension, because you don't know exactly where the blow will come from), and suddently fate strikes. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's film hits you in the stomach like a fist blow. His actors are so real - I'm not talking here only of stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchet and Gael Garcia Bernal (and they are great; Pitt proves that he can be a real actor, not just a cardboard clowning caricature as in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds), but all the others, the Moroccans, the Mexican nanny (Adriana Barraza), all the way to the smallest roles, the American border guard, the Moroccan shepperds, guide, police - that it is unbelievable. How do you get non-professional, teen-age Moroccan actors to play so realistically in scenes that would seem to be anathema to Muslim culture? Is there a subsidiary of the Actor's Studio in Rabat? I found the scene of the Mexican nanny lost in the desert with the two kids almost unbearable - I had to stop a few minutes, go pee, take a bite, any pretext to relieve the tension. But I returned.The film is called ""Babel"" but I think the title may be somewhat misleading, and that there is another secret thread running through it. I once read an interview of an ex-convict turned philosopher, and he had this aphorism which imprinted on my memory. Paraphrasing Sartre, he said: ""hell is not ""the others"": hell is causality"". I think ""Babel"" is about that too. How small, inconsequential decisions will bear unanticipated, fateful, unescapable consequences. The ancient Greeks called it ""Fate"".This is a real director, and this is real cinema, not entertainment.",5,A few rambling thoughts about Babel,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,7567,"['Lead',

The shot was not fired with malice, nor with evil intent, but with carelessness; yet the response is a series of mixed signals, misinformation, and definitely miscommunication.  Using the Tower of Babel as rich allegory, director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (try saying that three times in a row) tells a powerful story of confusion and cultural conflict in his compelling film BABEL.Here four totally separate (or so we first believe) stories play out simultaneously, on three continents.  An American couple (Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett) is vacationing in western Africa when they fall victim to a bizarre incident; a farmer and shepherd (Mustapha Rachidi), trying to eek out a living in the Moroccan desert, sends his two young sons out to protect his goat heard, and gives them a rifle to protect the livestock from predators.  Meanwhile, the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) makes a most unfortunate decision to take the couple's two children from San Diego into Mexico to attend a wedding; while in Japan, a deaf-mute teenage girl (Rinko Kikuchi) is having a most difficult time coming to grips with the recent death of her mother--even while authorities are searching for her businessman father (Koji Yakusho) to question him for a shooting that occurred in western Africa.Inarritu (with the astute help of writer Guillermo Arriago) weaves these stories together until the viewer understands the confusion, the miscommunication--the cultural disconnect.  And his cast is superb:  Pitt and Blanchett are outstanding, while the young Kikuchi appears in one of the film's most eye-opening scenes.  BABEL is anything but a ""feel good"" movie, but for viewers looking for a complex story compelling them to think, this is it.""If you want to be understood. . .listen.""--D.

Along the lines of Crash and Little Children where the story is interlocked by characters who are related to one another in one way or the other.There's the American couple (Pitt and Blanchett) who meets with an unfortunate shooting incident vacationing in Morroco due to two boys' mischief with a rifle that's from a Japanese hunter. At the same time, their nanny brings their children out of the American border to Mexico without permission. and meets with tragedy. Meanwhile the ex-Japanese hunter has a broken relationship with his deaf daughter whose emotional turmoils are furthered by her mum's suicide.Where the actors all have limited screen time alloted to them, each gave solid performances especially Rinko Kikuchi whose vulnerability leads to vicarious sexual abandonment. Brad Pitt reaches a level of sensibility  previously unseen of while Adriana Barraza plays the delirious nanny whose one moment of folly throws her life out of order.Through all these little stories lie the message of the power of communication - the lack of it in all the situations, creating misunderstandings, culminating in unnecessary tragedies.

What does that mean?"" asked the wife (I presume).""You know... babble... with two 'b's."" replied the husband (and again).Well, almost.As you probably know, the title of this film refers to the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel. According to that story, there was once a time when mankind was united in language, in country and in purpose. And, at that time, man decided to build a great city and a great Tower that could reach on to Heaven, itself. God, horrified at the prospect of man being able to do anything that he set his mind to (yeah, that's the rationale given...), decided to make such cooperation impossible, then and in the future, by dividing man into the several nations and tongues. We were given different languages so that we couldn't communicate clearly with each other; so that we would be divided amongst ourselves, and could no longer cooperate to reach for the sky (and attaining the sky is only possible through cooperation).Babel is, in part, an exploration of how good a job God did.Each of the four stories of Babel (a family of Moroccan goat-herders; the couple they accidentally shoot at; the couple's children and housekeeper in San Diego; a Japanese businessman and his deaf-mute daughter) revolves in some way around communication or culture, and how our difficulties and differences stand in our way.That such communication and superficial differences might be our only *real* barriers is presented subtly, yet well, by providing us with scenes and themes in each locale which are universally human: the two Moroccan brothers tussling for dominance; the Japanese teen's struggle for acceptance and understanding; the joy and celebration of family and love in Mexico; and, the powerful intimacy between loved-ones, when death might be approaching. These people are all human, and their struggles and triumphs are familiar. In showing us these scenes, we learn to see past the subtitles and languages to the people behind them. We see that, whatever confusion God may have wrought might yet be undone, if only we were better able to understand one another.This movie strikes one blow against God's project, in helping us to better understand each other, and in that (and several other aspects others will touch on, such as direction, acting, excitement, etc.), the movie is a great success.Five stars.",5,One Brick More in the Rebuilding of the Tower of Babel,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2450,"['fiancee', 'were', 'leaving', 'theater', 'heard', 'discussion', 'front', 'film', 'why', ""'Babel"", 'What', 'mean', 'asked', 'wife', 'presume', 'know', 'babble', 'two', 'b', 'replied', 'husband', 'again', '.Well', 'probably', 'know', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'According', 'story', 'was', 'once', 'time', 'when', 'mankind', 'was', 'united', 'language', 'country', 'purpose', 'time', 'man', 'decided', 'build', 'great', 'city', 'great', 'Tower', 'could', 'reach', 'Heaven', 'God', 'horrified', 'prospect', 'man', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'set', 'mind', 'yeah', 'rationale', 'given', 'decided', 'make', 'such', 'cooperation', 'impossible', 'then', 'future', 'dividing', 'man', 'several', 'nations', 'tongues', 'were', 'given', 'different', 'languages', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'clearly', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'divided', 'amongst', 'ourselves', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'cooperate', 'reach', 'sky', 'attaining', 'sky', 'only', 'possible', 'cooperation', '.Babel', 'part', 'exploration', 'how', 'good', 'job', 'God', 'did.Each', 'four', 'stories', 'Babel', 'family', 'Moroccan', 'goat-herders', 'couple', 'accidentally', 'shoot', 'couple', 'children', 'housekeeper', 'San', 'Diego', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'deaf-mute', 'daughter', 'way', 'communication', 'culture', 'how', 'difficulties', 'differences', 'stand', 'way.That', 'such', 'communication', 'superficial', 'differences', 'might', 'be', 'only', '*real*', 'barriers', 'presented', 'subtly', 'yet', 'well', 'providing', 'scenes', 'themes', 'locale', 'are', 'universally', 'human', 'two', 'Moroccan', 'brothers', 'tussling', 'dominance', 'Japanese', 'teen', 'struggle', 'acceptance', 'understanding', 'joy', 'celebration', 'family', 'love', 'Mexico', 'powerful', 'intimacy', 'loved-ones', 'when', 'death', 'might', 'be', 'approaching', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'are', 'familiar', 'showing', 'scenes', 'learn', 'see', 'subtitles', 'languages', 'people', 'see', 'confusion', 'God', 'may', 'have', 'wrought', 'might', 'yet', 'be', 'undone', 'only', 'were', 'better', 'able', 'understand', 'one', 'another.This', 'movie', 'one', 'blow', 'God', 'project', 'helping', 'better', 'understand', 'other', 'several', 'other', 'aspects', 'others', 'will', 'touch', 'such', 'direction', 'acting', 'excitement', 'etc', 'movie', 'great', 'success.Five', 'stars']",N/A

In Babel the stories are simple and not that dramatic. For me it was just paining to drag it out any longer. Because of a lack of individual character development, I just didn't feel much for any of them. That can suck if that is exactly the motive of a movie such as in Babel. No I'm not a bad person its just that Babel is a movie and movies need to draw you in.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga (who have sadly had a falling-out) may be one of the most formidable creative teams in the industry. Without resorting to cheap sentiments or preaching, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu crafts a quietly compelling follow-up to ""21 Grams,"" with an introspective look at the interlaced lives after a tragedy.Two boys in Morocco buy a rifle, and while testing it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman (Cate Blanchett), in the middle of a rural area with no real medical facilities. Unable to be transported, the woman and her husband (Brad Pitt) are dropped off in a rural village, to await help.Unknowingly, the boys have triggered off shattering events in other people's lives across the world -- a troubled, deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) causes a commotion, and the police find that this neglected, lonely teen is the daughter of the man who originally had the boys' rifle. And the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) is delayed going to her son's wedding, and attempts to bring the children into Mexico with her -- with disastrous results.""Babel"" is like a series of completely different photographs, but with the same person in the background. These haunting looks at how lives can be changed in an instant -- and the effects of violence, whether malicious or careless -- makes up the last volume of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga's ""Death Trilogy."" It illustrates death with the fragility of life.But it's also about the difficulty of communicating in the modern world. You can talk to someone across the world, but sometimes never communicate -- cultures, languages, race, and disabilities can divide people, such as when the border police rush to rescue the American kids, but are callous to the kindly nanny merely because she is not a citizen.And I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu knows how to capture the right feel for the movie, even to giving it shaky, rough cinematography. There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call. And the movie moves seamlessly from the rocky, dusty Morocco to the flashy, frenetic Tokyo to the relaxed San Diego.Blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress. Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year -- and heads should roll if she isn't even nominated!But the supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Kikuchi as the rebellious teenager, who feels isolated from the world around her, and is still grieving from her mother's tragic death. So she acts out sexually. And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.Admittedly, a good movie deserves a pretty good special edition, but this two-disc version really doesn't differ that much from the original theatrical release. The primary extra on this is a long ""making of"" featurette. It's nice, but a bit more would have been expected.It may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but ""Babel"" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film. A brilliant, thought-provoking movie, and one that deserves to be seen.",4,How we speak,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3508,"['Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Guillermo', 'Arriaga', 'who', 'have', 'sadly', 'had', 'falling-out', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'formidable', 'creative', 'teams', 'industry', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'sentiments', 'preaching', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'crafts', 'quietly', 'compelling', 'follow-up', '21', 'Grams', 'introspective', 'look', 'interlaced', 'lives', 'tragedy.Two', 'boys', 'Morocco', 'buy', 'rifle', 'testing', 'out', 'strike', 'passing', 'tourist', 'bus', 'Unfortunately', 'bullet', 'vacationing', 'American', 'woman', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'middle', 'rural', 'area', 'real', 'medical', 'facilities', 'Unable', 'be', 'transported', 'woman', 'husband', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'dropped', 'off', 'rural', 'village', 'await', 'help.Unknowingly', 'boys', 'have', 'triggered', 'off', 'shattering', 'events', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'world', 'troubled', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'commotion', 'police', 'find', 'neglected', 'lonely', 'teen', 'daughter', 'man', 'who', 'originally', 'had', 'boys', 'rifle', 'American', 'couple', 'nanny', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'delayed', 'going', 'son', 'wedding', 'attempts', 'bring', 'children', 'Mexico', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Babel', 'series', 'completely', 'different', 'photographs', 'same', 'person', 'background', 'haunting', 'looks', 'how', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'instant', 'effects', 'violence', 'malicious', 'careless', 'up', 'last', 'volume', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Arriaga', 'Death', 'Trilogy', 'death', 'fragility', 'life.But', 'also', 'difficulty', 'communicating', 'modern', 'world', 'can', 'talk', 'someone', 'world', 'sometimes', 'never', 'communicate', 'cultures', 'languages', 'race', 'disabilities', 'can', 'divide', 'people', 'such', 'when', 'border', 'police', 'rush', 'rescue', 'American', 'kids', 'are', 'callous', 'kindly', 'nanny', 'merely', 'not', 'citizen.And', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'how', 'capture', 'right', 'feel', 'movie', 'even', 'giving', 'shaky', 'rough', 'cinematography', 'feeling', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'even', 'small', 'scenes', 'such', 'Pitt', 'starting', 'crumble', 'phone', 'call', 'movie', 'seamlessly', 'rocky', 'dusty', 'Morocco', 'flashy', 'frenetic', 'Tokyo', 'relaxed', 'San', 'Diego.Blanchett', 'Pitt', 'are', 'center', 'movie', 'order', 'are', 'excellent', 'Blanchett', 'stunning', 'performance', 'critically', 'wounded', 'wife', 'Pitt', 'well', 'anguished', 'husband', 'rediscover', 'love', 'duress', 'Blanchett', 'performance', 'should', 'definitely', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'next', 'year', 'heads', 'should', 'roll', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Kikuchi', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'who', 'isolated', 'world', 'still', 'grieving', 'mother', 'tragic', 'death', 'out', 'sexually', 'Barraza', 'solid', 'performance', 'nanny', 'nightmarish', 'situation', 'particularly', 'haunting', 'really', 'happens.Admittedly', 'good', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'edition', 'two-disc', 'version', 'really', ""n't"", 'differ', 'that', 'much', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'primary', 'extra', 'long', 'making', 'featurette', 'nice', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'expected.It', 'may', 'comment', 'lack', 'communication', 'cultures', 'people', 'Babel', 'so', 'compelling', 'acting', 'visuals', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'silent', 'film', 'brilliant', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

""Babel"" is his third film and continues the downward spiral into ever-greater style-over-substance.  It is all about grandiose intentions, gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack, a mediocre mega-star lead actor (Brad Pitt) cast mainly to create more of a mainstream/mass-appeal box office draw, and a generally cliched, heavy-handed and cornily predictable plot built upon a host of mostly two-dimensional characters.Pitt and Blanchett are the generic spoiled, narcissistic and miserable yuppy Americans who are helpless when calamity strikes them overseas, with two angelic-looking innocent and helpless little kids left back home under the care of an equally angelic and helpless illegal-immigrant Mexican nanny, who stupidly takes them to a wedding party in Tijuana with her crazy nephew (Gabriel Garcia Bernal, whose talent is wasted in a stock role here) driving.  Rinko Kikuchi plays a miserably lonely, isolated, and helpless deaf-mute teenager flailing around haplessly in the surreal and soulless landscape of urban Japan.  The only truly interesting, authentic, and emotionally involving characters were the Moroccans, in particular the Berber goatherding family whose two young sons initiate the whole movie's plot development through a series of stupid actions that have totally unforseen consequences.And that, for all the movie's sound and fury, is all that drives this work: the (gasp!) presentation of human life as the outcome of human folly and frailty which, due to our innate interconnectedness on a global and karmic level, like a hair-trigger can set off a flurry of tragic and destructive events, i.e. human suffering.  I suppose this might be a GINORMOUS revelation if one spends one's life glued to the boob tube watching ""reality TV"" shows (perhaps true for the legions of Brad Pitt fans that the casting company was hoping to reel in), but otherwise it's hardly earthshaking news.However, there are many films with prosaic themes, predictable plotlines and inflated pretentions that can still hold the viewer's interest.  ""Babel"" is not one of those, because it fails to follow the first rule of decent storytelling: create involving CHARACTERS that move the plot, rather than having the PLOT (especially one as didactic as this) move the characters as though in a puppet theater.It's still not as tedious as ""Crash"" though, thanks to the cinematography and score.

1044567,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000MCH5P4,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","In general, omnibus movies which carry divergent storylines and multiple character arcs are risky propositions for the contrivances that occur in bringing the movie back to a more holistic experience. From my perspective, Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a prime example of this hit-and-miss approach. Filmmaker Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, however, has provided quite an exception to the rule with this spellbinder of a film tied together by our often desperate need and frequent failure to communicate. It's by turns audacious, challenging and heartbreaking, as he and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga present a puzzle-piece yet clear-eyed narrative that tenuously links complete strangers in three different locales around the world.It opens in a desolate area of Morocco where a goat-herding family comes in the possession of a rifle which the father instructs his two pre-adolescent sons to use on jackals who threaten the goats. Through typical sibling rivalry, one of the brothers shoots at a tourist bus and accidentally hits a female American tourist named Susan. Fears of terrorism run rampant as her husband Richard frantically tries to find medical help for her in an isolated village. Back in the U.S., Richard and Susan's nanny Amelia needs to go to her son's wedding in Mexico, but she has no one who can take care of their two young children. With her hot-headed nephew Santiago driving, Amelia decides to bring the children with her across the border. Meanwhile, there is an angry young girl in Tokyo named Chieko, deaf and mute, who is desperate for intimacy in light of an emotionally distant father and deceased mother.The stories gradually interlock in a non-linear manner that plays havoc with our sensibilities but not at the expense of the visceral punch that I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga provide with each new revelation. It's simply startling how they are able to avert the potential contrivance of the running theme through the creative dexterity of the storytelling. It also helps that the acting is so uniformly strong in light of the various languages spoken and the cultural and socioeconomic differences presented. None get a huge amount of screen time, but they make lasting impressions. Cate Blanchett and especially Brad Pitt play Susan and Richard with economic skill and palpable desperation. As the young Moroccan brothers, Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid are particularly affecting, as is Mohamed Akhzam as the sympathetic guide Anwar.While Gael Garcia Bernal uses his natural charisma effectively as Santiago, it is the quietly devastating work of Adriana Barraza as Amelia that makes the worst-nightmare dimensions of their story feel so authentically heartbreaking. Nevertheless, the most surprisingly powerful work comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko. Although her character initially appears to be a maladjusted J-Pop-obsessed teen, Kikuchi brings out all of Chieko's inner torment and vulnerability with fluidity. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is superb considering the variety of locales he had to shoot and still stay in tune with a uniform visual look, and Gustavo Santaolalla contributes another exceptional music score. Both did similarly accomplished work on Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"". This is first-class work full of cathartic moments and complex emotions.

1044570,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B000MCH5P4,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[7, 11]","I must admit, upon first glance of the trailer, the only thing that caught my attention was the title, ""BABEL"". The word was one I am quite familiar with considering the story of The Tower of Babel was in mind. However, taking a sudden random interest in seeing the film just a month before it came out, I found out the story was much more complexed and original. Hailed as a recreation of the Academy Award winning Crash, which I had little to no interest to see, I considered Babel to be something that was being pushed below of what it actually could do with the limited release and already being ridiculed by people who hadn't even seen it. Blocking out all skepticism, I made the effort to see the film in the only theatre in my area where it was showing. I have no regrets of doing so.When an American woman traveling on vacation with her husband and a group of tourists in Morocco is suddenly shot, a chain reaction begins. Suspecting terrorists, the American and Moroccan governments take action. Little do they know it was a small local family living in the mountains. The two sons, who had the rifle, were supposed to be protecting the family's herd of goats with it but instead began aiming at cars and also the tour bus. In Japan, deaf and mute Chieko, who's father once owned the gun, is having problems of her own communicating with anyone of the outside world, let alone does she make any real effort to do so. Not only this, but Amelia, who is the American couple's Mexican nanny, takes the couple's young children across the border to attend her own son's wedding when the couple does not return in time, only to find she may not be able to get them back. Along the lines, these six people will find they didn't have their world as well planned out as they had thought.The cast was absolutely phenomenol. Filled with first-timers and world-class talent, each person is able to show their abilities. Adriana Bazzara shines as Amelia the maid. She was the most sympathetic out of all the characters, and her portrayal of an insanity set in by not being able to make it back to the life she left behind in America is absolutely incredible. Barraza's own level of commitment is also insurmountable. Because the screenplay called for her to talk the majority in Spanish, this may have enabled Barraza to bring out her full potential. I admit, she was my favorite actress out of the whole movie if not THE best.I must also admit that I think this was my favorite movie Brad Pitt played in. I can't say I would own any films with him in it, but just the idea that he was playing a character that was not the lead (nor were there any leads except for the principles) was what also made me want to see the movie more because playing a supporting is usually more difficult. He did not shine on screen which was ultimately good. Usually when people go to see a movie, they go to see the star. This was not his case, however. They were actually seeing the character of Richard and not just Brad Pitt which I was amazingly shocked he could pull off without pulling his usual stints in the process. Well known actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett also did the same. Both are of high-stature in hollywood and in their home countries, but ultimately make room for the unknowns, who end up being just as good (or in Barraza's case, BETTER) than the super-stars. Koji Yakusho should've been given more time than he was, but makes a nice supporting star in the film in the simplicity of his role.I will give a lot of notification to writer Guillermo Arriaga and Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for their bold and straightforward displays of the story that Babel puts forth. The atmospheric setting and the different sides of the world that are quick to make acusations, and how hard life is anywhere outside of your home country, even if you are only traveling, which are obvious nods to the Mexicans and the Americans in the movie. Though I can see a lot that could've been left out of the graphicness in the story of the deaf and blind Chieko, such as the full frontal nudity (which could've been done just as well with just implied nudity), the rest of her story, and the others are perfect in their complications. A lot is displayed in the 2 hours and 23 minutes the film runs, even giving you the idea that life runs slower than it really is.The key element, which is not pushed out into the obvious but played along for the audience to figure out, is that all the characters are trapped in a world in which they cannot communicate with the people around them, hence the title BABEL. This was another thing that lured me in on account of we pass this by everyday without even knowing it. In Albuqueruqe, New Mexico where I live, it is very difficult to speak with people because the majority of people here speak spanish, while about 1/5 of the population ONLY speaks Spanish. Babel touched home with me on that aspect. I know Spanish, but I can only imagine what it must be like for people who don't. You could almost think of it as an innocence of ignorance as with the issue all the characters in the film experience. I'm sure with a lot of people Babel touched home, but I hope it picks up at the box office soon.On the $25,000,000 budget, which the producers spent thoughtfully and and worthfully, the fruits of their passion on a six month shoot has brought us this amazing work of art to the world which should be noted to all kinds as a message that needs to be heard. Babel will feel as reality because it is a lesson in arrogance and hubris on many fronts. If you are a person who takes the time to experience reality daily as I did, you will feel for these people. If not, do not waste your time. It is very difficult for anyone of the routine world who cannot take the time to realize the little things in life such as being able to understand one another that could never understand a film as complex as Babel. Go in with a skeptical mind and come out feeling refreshed and waiting for life to meet you. I guarantee you that you will get something back.",5,"Open your eyes, and your ears!",1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,6082,"['must', 'admit', 'first', 'glance', 'trailer', 'only', 'thing', 'caught',

1044573,A3PL6I6DNQT4V4,B000MCH5P4,Fiction Fanatic,"[6, 9]","A more intelligent film than your average box office draw and more demanding of its audience.I was warned that the film was depressing, and its larger message is grim, but the way the film plunks us down in the daily life situations of two Third World and one First World, but very foreign, country, and the up-close-and-personal stay we make in each of those places, is rare in Hollywood movies.A previous reviewer dismisses the characters as ""stupid people doing stupid things"". What's engrossing about this film is that the characters who engage in such folly are so lovingly drawn and portrayed, reminding us that perfectly well-meaning folks can commit grave mistakes with broad repercussions due to their own lack of foresight and the irrational reactions of the larger world around them.  This is a movie that makes you think AND feel.  You can't help but cringe at the missteps that take the characters into disturbing places and experiences.Even more troubling is the fact that people do these sorts of things all the time.  People do pack themselves into air-conditioned busses to drive through the countryside (and rejuvenate their marriages) with little or no understanding of the circumstances of life for the people they pass along the way.  When they are forced to get down from the bus, it occurs to them to be scared of the locals, whom they might well imagine to be terrorists.As for the acting, while it was nice to see the box office draws of Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, the lesser known actors were even more compelling.  Gael Garcia Bernal and Adriana Barraza are terrific; Rinko Kikuchi, Koji Yakusho and Yuko Murata also put in very strong performances; and the choice to cast local unknowns in Morocco was a refreshing addition to the use of Hollywood stars.When the character of Cheiko, the angry Japanese teenage deaf-mute who seeks love through sexual advances, stands naked on the balcony of the penthouse apartment she shares with her dad, and looks out over the urban landscape of postindustrial Tokyo, the human predicament is poignantly presented.  Other viewers read sexual innuendo into her father's embrace, but instead it seemed more of a father's belated and feeble attempt to comfort and protect the daughter who is fast growing beyond him into a woman.",5,Some good ethnographic filmmaking along with a strong indictment of US xenophobia,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,2294,"['more', 'intelligent', 'film', 'average', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'more', 'demanding', 'audience.I', 'was', 'warned', 'film', 'was', 'depressing', 'larger', 'message', 'grim', 'way', 'film', 'down', 'daily', 'life', 'situations', 'two', 'Third', 'World', 'one', 'First', 'World', 'very', 'foreign', 'country', 'up-close-and-personal', 'stay', 'make', 'places', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'movies.A', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'characters', 'stupid', 'people', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'What', 'engrossing', 'film', 'characters', 'who', 'engage', 'such', 'folly', 'are', 'so', 'lovingly', 'drawn', 'portrayed', 'reminding', 'perfectly', 'well-meaning', 'folks', 'can', 'commit', 'grave', 'mistakes', 'broad', 'repercussions', 'due', 'own', 'lack', 'foresight', 'irrational', 'reactions', 'larger', 'world', 'movie', 'think', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cringe', 'missteps', 'take', 'characters', 'disturbing', 'places', 'experiences.Even', 'more', 'troubling', 'fact', 'people', 'do', 'sorts', 'things', 'time', 'People', 'do', 'pack', 'air-conditioned', 'busses', 'drive', 'countryside', 'rejuvenate', 'marriages', 'little', 'understanding', 'circumstances', 'life', 'people', 'pass', 'way', 'When', 'are', 'forced', 'get', 'down', 'bus', 'be', 'scared', 'locals', 'whom', 'might', 'well', 'imagine', 'be', 'terrorists.As', 'acting', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'box', 'office', 'draws', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Kate', 'Blanchett', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'are', 'terrific', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'Yuko', 'Murata', 'also', 'put', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'choice', 'cast', 'local', 'unknowns', 'Morocco', 'was', 'refreshing', 'addition', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'stars.When', 'character', 'Cheiko', 'angry', 'Japanese', 'teenage', 'deaf-mute', 'who', 'love', 'sexual', 'advances', 'naked', 'balcony', 'penthouse', 'apartment', 'shares', 'dad', 'out', 'urban', 'landscape', 'postindustrial', 'Tokyo', 'human', 'predicament', 'poignantly', 'presented', 'Other', 'viewers', 'read', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'father', 'embrace', 'instead', 'seemed', 'more', 'father', 'belated', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'comfort', 'protect', 'daughter', 'who', 'fast', 'growing', 'woman']",N/A

It was really not about the different languages, as the story would have had the exact same meaning to me if all the characters had spoken the same language.  To me, it was all about the gun, and the sadness it brought to those affected directly by it.The movie was interesting to watch (although it did not put up subtitles by default, and is impossible to know what is going on without the subtitles unless you speak several languages) but the movie cuts off into credits without any ending.  We don't know what was written on the note, and so many other unanswered questions with no closure.I was really enjoying watching this movie during the entire thing, until it stopped and the credits started to roll, because it was like someone just came and turned the TV off right in the middle of the movie.A great movie I saw just before this one was ""The Lives of Others"" which has a really good non predictable ending that leaves you really feeling satisfied.

1044582,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000MCH5P4,Galina,"[2, 4]","Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's first film ""Amores Perros"" that used multi-narrative style and told three intertwined stories abut lives, loves, passions, and losses of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs and that were connected by one fateful incident in the streets of Mexico City was a remarkable compassionate movie, a very successful debut that left me waiting for the next I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's film. ""21 grams"" (2003) which takes place in the USA, tells the story of three people whose lives become deeply connected through a horrific accident. It is IMO, the best I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's film, with three finest performances from most gripping actors working now, with three stories that take their heroes to such emotional, mental, and physical depths of despair, revenge, and promise of redemption that it is difficult to think of another such powerful film.In his latest and most celebrated film ""Babel"" (2006), I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu went global and biblical on us. One city or even one country is not enough for him anymore. Several taglines advertised the film that connects (or disconnects) the characters of different cultures, backgrounds, languages, religions, and nationalities, and their stories. ""If You Want to be Understood...Listen"", ""Tragedy is universal"", ""A global disaster"", ""A single gunshot heard around the world"", ""Pain is universal... But so is hope"". I agree with all these statements, as for the movie...well, I am afraid it proves that its writer/director may be one trick pony who uses the same approach, the same tools and tricks over and over again. He reminds me of a cook who has learned how to make one dish only, and he keeps serving it to us under the different sauce an on the larger plates. This time, his sauce is not done well. All three stories are primitive, predictable, and poorly written. Some of them simply should not and could not happen. For instance, the story of Amelia, a kind and nice Mexican nanny who had to take two American children in Mexico with her to attend her son's wedding. According the law, if the USA citizens - minors enter Mexico without their parents, they MUST have a notarized letter of permission given by their parents or legal guardian. The nanny would've been stopped and questioned before she crossed the USA-Mexico border which would make the later heartbreaking scenes simply impossible. I wonder if I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu chose to ignore the well known information on purpose to manipulate the viewers. Another question has been brought up often regarding the Mexican story. Why would Amelia let her obviously drunk nephew who had problems crossing Mexico-USA border before drive her and the children back to the USA? Why did Santiago (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) behave so irrationally? We never found out.Three stories of four, of a nanny and an American couple, her employers, vacationing in Morocco where the wife (Cate Blanchett) was gravely wounded in a shooting accident, and of two Moroccan boys whose father handed them the fateful rifle which is a logical center of the film are connected.  The fourth story though, that of a deaf-mute Japanese teenage girl in Tokyo, ""Rebel Without a Cause"", has very little to do with the rest of the stories. Actually, despite a strong performance by Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko), the Japanese part of the movie is weak and I think it does not belong to the movie. It is hard for me to believe that the attractive teenage girl is so desperate to lose her virginity - just to any man who crosses her path, no matter who he is that she would act in a manner immortalized by Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"". Judging by her behavior in ""Babel"", she does not want to be loved, she does not need a boyfriend who would kiss her, hold hands with her, no, she needs to be f_ucked. NOW! I think that her problems with the lack of communications due to her condition, her anger and frustration toward the ""normal"" boys who seem first to be interested in the pretty girls but would stay away after realizing that the girls are deaf-mute, and she silently screams to her friend, ""They look at us like we're monsters"", could've been solved by the writers easily had they provided Chieko with a chance to meet a boy of her age with the same disability. If they (the writers) came up with the girls' school for deaf-mute students, I am sure they could've shown similar boys' schools in Tokyo.  But they were not interested in helping their own character. They found it more interesting to put her through the series of absolutely unnecessary sexually explicit and exploitive, humiliating scenes that did not contribute anything compelling or important to the film.In the end, I am afraid that ""Babel"" fits closely one of its taglines - ""A global disaster"". Even with some good performances, moody cinematography, and impressive Oscar winning musical score, it fells victim to its creator's ""global"" ambitions. The Japanese storyline rewritten and reworked could be another movie. As it is now, it brings to my mind a famous Russian saying which translates like ""An elderberry grows in the kitchen garden and my uncle lives in Kiev"", meaning , Mr. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, please next time, don't mix apples and oranges.P.S. For the fans of Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu who believe that he has started multi-narrative style. Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" was made in 1975 and it was followed by Altman's ""Short Cuts""(1993) and P.T. Anderson's ""Magnolia""(1999). Both films were made before I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu ""Amorres Perros"" (2000).",2,Vidas Perros,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,5616,"['Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'first',

An American couple is visiting Morocco and their children are in the care of a Mexican nanny in the U.S.  There is also a fourth story which involves an adolescent female from Japan. During the whole movie I was wondering how the Japanese story would relate to the other stories but you find out towards the end.The acting by everyone is great. Besides Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, all the other actors are unknown.  A lot of the movie is in Arabic, Japanese and in Spanish. In addition, the female in Japan is deaf/mute. It is interesting when they turn of the volume sometimes during her scenes to show us how she sees the world.  The movie has great acting, and a great storyline.  The scenery in Mexico, Morocco and Japan is nice and it really gives you a feel for those countries.I would just give it four stars because I don't understand why the young boy from Morocco looks at his sister while she is changing or why the lady from Japan is naked in front of her Dad. I don't understand what the director's purpose was in showing those scenes.When I finished the movie I was wondering what kind of message the director was trying to relay.  The only thing which I could thing of was how privileged the American couple where in relation to the Moroccan people.  I know if any Moroccan person in that village had a fatal wound they definitely would not be flown by helicopter to Casablanca.

Great acting all around, even from the Morrocan extras who weren't professional actors.  I liked the idea of how these four separate stories were connected by one unfortunate bullet, but there were some scenes that were pointless.The Japanese deaf-mute character seemed unneccesarry.  What was the point of Rinko Kikuchi getting naked and showing her crotch?  She got an oscar nomination for this?  I mean the center of the story wasn't even around her, it was around her father's hunting rifle which caused all the riff-raff to begin with.  While her acting was very good, I felt the role of Chieko was was invented merely to get the Asian chick naked on screen. She's showing her hooch and boobs, give her an oscar nomination.  Why not?Cate and Brad did great as usual, and Cate did an exceptionally good job being the annoying wife.  Who the hell runs away to Morocco over depression and leaves their kids with the nanny who, by the way, is an illegal immigrant who already had other plans?

They have worked together on 'Amores perros' then '21 Grams', gradually going from independent low budget, highly sophisticated controversial films to the point where those who produce films are willing to invest the big bucks that it takes to create a film like BABEL. The two men, writer/director and  writer, seem to maintain an almost theatrical company around them: many of the same actors appear, the same crews, etc and the result is ensemble filmmaking whose final impact rests solely on the message of the film itself.  Though this is one of the finest casts assembled yet this year, it would be difficult to select one or two as Oscar contenders, but it is certain the film and its director will gather awards wherever they are wisely and thoughtfully given.The story seems complex, spread as it is from Morocco, San Diego, Tokyo, and Mexico, but the unifying element is so simple that it makes the audience shudder.  A rifle owned by a Tokyo based Japanese hunter is given to his Moroccan guide who in turn sells it to a poor Moroccan peasant whose two young sons guard and use for innocent practice until the younger son shoots at a tourist bus, injuring an American woman who is traveling with her husband, mending a strained marriage.  The couple's children are at home in San Diego with their Mexican nanny who adores them and when no friends will help her is forced to take them with her to Mexico with her loony nephew to attend her son's wedding.  All is well until the time to return home involves a foolish car chase through the Mexican American border and the nanny is arrested as an illegal immigrant despite her fifteen-year presence in California as the beloved housekeeper for the vacationing couple.  Meanwhile, in Japan, the deaf mute young daughter of the man who began the problems with his gift of the rifle to the Moroccan, longs for attention from her father and escape from her misunderstood world of silence and goes to sad extremes to gain male affection, affection which involves the police who merely want to question her father about his rifle gift.Sound extraordinary? It is, and yet the manner in which Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga tell the story the string of bad luck coincidences focus on the problems of communication (from foreign language to sign language) deficits, misguided political obstructive processes, and the desperate need we all have for love and caring and understanding.  The cast is enormous and uniformly outstanding: Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette are the parents, Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble their children, Adriana Barraza their nanny (a stunning actress this!), Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal her irresponsible nephew, Michael Pe&ntilde;a (so memorable in 'Crash') and Clifton Collins Jr. the border guards, Rinko Kikuchi the deaf mute young girl, and a group of Moroccan and Japanese actors that are too many to list.The cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto, the incredibly important film editors are Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, and the astonishing music score is the product of the gifted  Gustavo Santaolalla.

1044588,AAIL33CYCT47J,B000MCH5P4,Gregory Baird,"[9, 18]","'Babel' firmly belongs to the 'Crash' school of filmmaking: find a good, truthful aspect of society and bury it in melodrama and manipulative contrivances to get audiences swooning over your movie.  The people who profess to love the film do so primarily because they agree with the message, not because of the quality of the film itself.  And so, an undeserving, hackneyed work gets awards heaped upon it because everyone wants to look socially responsible/aware.  And all the while, the sad truth is that the movie has little to say about the issues it is ostensibly addressing so thoughtfully.  The ""theme"" of Babel that is so widely discussed in reviews is that communication and cultural understanding have become impossible in today's world, but the only way you get a sense of that from the film is the Biblical reference contained in the title.  Or maybe it's supposed to come out in the way that Brad Pitt's character shrieks at the Morroccan villagers who don't understand his English after his wife is wounded in a freak shooting, but honestly, any halfway-savvy traveller wouldn't dare venture into a foreign land like that without a travel guide that would at least allow them to say ""phone"" or ""hospital"" in the native language, or are we not supposed to question the movie's logic?  That's the type of contrivance that sadly defines the screenplay for 'Babel', and the viewer is supposed to mindlessly nod and accept it.  (***potential spoiler alert***)  This is a movie where travellers wander into territories unknown without a thought for their own protection, a Mexican man living legally in the US will choose to try and outrun customs officials anyway just because they made him angry, a father will encourage his sons to run from the police rather than peacefully attempt to explain the nature of their accident, and a young boy will endanger the lives of himself and his family to shoot at said police who have come to arrest him rather than turn himself in and explain what happened.  (***end potential spoilers***)  Why?  Because it's more dramatic that way.  It may make less sense, but I suppose audiences respond to senseless violence better than poignant truth.What makes 'Babel' better than 'Crash' is that it actually has a pretty solid first hour before the story gets overtaken by melodrama and self-importance.  But get overtaken it does, and soon the viewer is deluged by convenient set-ups and disastrous results.  Aside from Brad Pitt, whose grayed hair and crow's feet look as artificial as his shrieky performance, the acting is stellar.  But even the great performances, such as Adriana Barraza's, get bogged down by the disparate vignette format that the film takes on.  At least Barraza's storyline is directly linked to the Brad Pitt-Cate Blanchett one that takes center stage -- poor Rinko Kikuchi is saddled with a plotline that feels like it belongs in another movie for all it has to do with everything else going on, undermining the layered performance that the Oscar-nominated actress gives as a deaf-mute Japanese teenager losing herself in Tokyo's club scene to get over her mother's suicide.  The direction, courtesy of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is also superb, but cannot distract from the muddled mess that the screenplay makes of its good intentions.",2,Contrived Melodrama,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,3308,"[""'Babel"", 'firmly', ""'Crash"", 'school', 'filmmaking', 'find', 'good', 'truthful', 'aspect', 'society', 'bury', 'melodrama', 'manipulative', 'contrivances', 'get', 'audiences', 'swooning', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'profess', 'love', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'primarily', 'agree', 'message', 'not', 'quality', 'film', 'so', 'undeserving', 'hackneyed', 'work', 'awards', 'heaped', 'everyone', 'look', 'socially', 'responsible/aware', 'while', 'sad', 'truth', 'movie', 'little', 'say', 'issues', 'ostensibly', 'addressing', 'so', 'thoughtfully', 'theme', 'Babel', 'so', 'widely', 'discussed', 'reviews', 'communication', 'cultural', 'understanding', 'have', 'become', 'impossible', 'today', 'world', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'sense', 'film', 'Biblical', 'reference', 'contained', 'title', 'supposed', 'come', 'out', 'way', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'shrieks', 'Morroccan', 'villagers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'English', 'wife', 'wounded', 'freak', 'shooting', 'honestly', 'halfway-savvy', 'traveller', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'venture', 'foreign', 'land', 'travel', 'guide', 'would', 'least', 'allow', 'say', 'phone', 'hospital', 'native', 'language', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'question', 'movie', 'logic', 'type', 'contrivance', 'sadly', 'screenplay', ""'Babel"", 'viewer', 'supposed', 'mindlessly', 'nod', 'accept', '***potential', 'spoiler', 'alert***', 'movie', 'where', 'travellers', 'wander', 'territories', 'unknown', 'thought', 'own', 'protection', 'Mexican', 'man', 'living', 'legally', 'US', 'will', 'choose', 'try', 'outrun', 'customs', 'officials', 'anyway', 'just', 'made', 'angry', 'father', 'will', 'encourage', 'sons', 'run', 'police', 'rather', 'peacefully', 'attempt', 'explain', 'nature', 'accident', 'young', 'boy', 'will', 'endanger', 'lives', 'family', 'shoot', 'said', 'police', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'arrest', 'rather', 'turn', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', '***end', 'potential', 'spoilers***', 'Why', 'more', 'dramatic', 'way', 'may', 'make', 'less', 'sense', 'suppose', 'audiences', 'respond', 'senseless', 'violence', 'better', 'poignant', 'better', ""'Crash"", 'actually', 'pretty', 'solid', 'first', 'hour', 'story', 'overtaken', 'melodrama', 'self-importance', 'get', 'overtaken', 'soon', 'viewer', 'deluged', 'convenient', 'set-ups', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Aside', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'grayed', 'hair', 'crow', 'feet', 'look', 'as', 'artificial', 'shrieky', 'performance', 'acting', 'stellar', 'even', 'great', 'performances', 'such', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'disparate', 'vignette', 'format', 'film', 'least', 'Barraza', 'storyline', 'directly', 'linked', 'Brad', 'Pitt-Cate', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'center', 'stage', 'poor', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'saddled', 'plotline', 'movie', 'do', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'undermining', 'layered', 'performance', 'Oscar-nominated', 'actress', 'deaf-mute', 'Japanese', 'teenager', 'losing', 'Tokyo', 'club', 'scene', 'get', 'mother', 'suicide', 'direction', 'courtesy', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'also', 'superb', 'can', 'not', 'distract', 'muddled', 'mess', 'screenplay', 'good', 'intentions']",N/A

Not likely, otherwise he would have been strung up by the, er, more sensitive and tolerant guardians of our societies. Or at least you'd expect howls of outrage. But instead it's gotten critical acclaim. So my impression is that the director is not American.First, it's overlong. Many scenes are three or four times longer than necessary. Makes it more artsy, I guess?Second, there's precious little about miscommunication or alienation. It's about Mexicans, Moroccans, and Japanese doing inexplicably stupid things. So unbelievably stupid, it's painful to watch. It's also, ironically, a plug for having the NRA go into Morocco and perhaps the whole world to teach its kids not to shoot at cars for practice. Are these kids complete morons?Third, the ""interlocking stories"" aspect of this movie is incredibly lame. It's barely there, in fact. The Japanese angle is a total throwaway. So is the nanny ""connection"". The existence of these connections adds nothing to the story.What happened? The most probable scenario:Director: I've finished it!

1044590,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B000MCH5P4,guillermoj,"[3, 4]","This movie is a feast for all the senses and another masterpiece from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, whose debut film ""Amores Perros"" established him and his writing partner, Guillermo Arriaga, as talents that simply would be ignored.While ""Amores"" had a similar narrative style, it was much more consistently visceral and in your face than ""Babel,"" which is also a tough film but one which demands a slower pace and shows a story-teller and a director at the peak of their respective talents. They had a lot to live up to esp. after the initial critical acclaim of ""Amores"". While some critics/people see the movie as being a little too self-important and some even like the 4 stories (but not in the same movie) I was immediately emotionally involved from the first frame of the movie to the last because of the different stories. One could argue that its message of the need to ""communicate"" does not warrant the movie's perceived self-important tone, but I was easily able to overlook a possibly didactic tone at times and spent a little over 2 1/2 hours getting to know people from around the world who have universal needs and hopes and how these desires manifest themselves in a story of global scope that is brought together by one element which ties them all.I won't much more away as I don't like to know too much about movies before seeing them. I can say that any film student would be hard-pressed not to appreciate the use of different film stocks used to differentiate each story and even more importantly the technical/logistical prowess that must have been required to direct a production of this magnitude, working with such a diverse cultural cast, and finding a way to bring together the performances of stars and others who'd never been in a single frame in their entire lives. I want to see the film again just to appreciate the hues, esp. those used in the Japan portion of the film, with emphasis on a scene that takes place at a nightclub. This sequence is as alive as anything that you will ever see in a single frame in any movie made to date. I would compare it to Scorsese's notorious cooking/restaurant scenes in which you can almost smell the garlic coming from the television/movie screenSome people have complained that the movie is too long, and while the 2 1/2+ hours certainly did not fly by (unlike ""The Departed"" which managed to feel like it lasted much less than it did), I did not mind. Many of the scenes taking place in Morocco and Mexico required the slower pace to give the horrible events that would soon take place even more life and appropriateness in a story that is not told in a linear fashion, and unlike some movies that use a non-linear narrative for show, this one demands on this slower narrative succeeding or else it would not only be virtually impossible to tell but would take away from its big impact.The acting is out of this world and, with the exception of a narrative short-coming (which may very well be on the cutting room floor) that makes the talented Gael Garcia Bernal's character feel like he is making a cameo in the movie, you'll be hard-pressed to find an ensemble in any movie in any year that is as strong as this one. Adriana Barraza's performance is so moving that you'll find it hard to forget even after the movie ends. I am glad that she received a nomination as it will hopefully lead to more work by this talented actress.Bottom-line:If you don't mind long movies and want to be moved by stories the are universal and timely, you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie that does it better than this one. Is it perfect? No, but it simply can't be, although it would have it would have benefited from allowing its images to relay its ""message"" as some of the commentary/words (esp. at the end)that the self-importance that some see in the movie in my mind are solely the product of these touches and an advertising campaign that beat the theme to death and sold the movie and an ""event"". It's a shame that for all the talk that this film has generated, it has not been seen by more people.On the other hand, if you hate long movies (and still have Elaine Benis from ""Seinfeld"" type rants when anyone mentions ""The English Patient""), this is not the movie for you. All humor aside, read the Amazon review IF you need to know more details for making the choice to see this movie. That synopsis is right on the money. This also is not a movie for kids, nor anyone looking for something ""light."" Go with your gut. If you think that this movie is not for you, it probably won't be. I for one loved it and think that it's too easy to call it this year's ""Crash,"" which in my opinion was not as ""good"" as ""Brokeback Mountain"" but was not the piece of junk that some have wanted to reduce it to.",5,You'll probably either love or hate this movie.

We didn't speak much about the film on that day and nothing was said. Now I shall start my ramble.One of the major strengths of Babel is how it not for one second assumes a superior tone than what the viewer is tuned into. In other words, the film is not patronizing and it doesn't really want to make a point (not only) or change lives. Babel manifests a solid storyline without much rabbling. Maybe the reason we were quiet was because we felt a ""collective"" respect for Babel. [and no the end is not like a demise]Two. The acting was not more than what was required. The screenplay doesn't allow for anyone to overact. I must give credit to whoever did the direction and screenplay. The storyline seems impossible to actually be molded into a 2hour 20 minute film, but IT WAS.Three. Though ""Departed"" is the best film I've seen this year and that film deserves an Oscar, Babel deserves more respect in my consciense.Four. Life-refreshing sets.

I think the point is very clearly stated in the preview, but not in the movie itself, although it's clear from watching the movie. The communication barriers we all deal with, and our prejudices against one another affect our lives, and make life hard, and painful, where there does not have to be any pain, or misunderstanding.Cate Blanchett is a phenomenal actress, and does an outstanding job here, as the wife of Brad Pitt who gets shot in Morocco while riding on a bus. She is shot by two young boys, playing with a gun, and terroristic sirens sound off throughout the world. There are some other events happening in the movie too, with their children, and the original owner of the gun who is in China. Somehow they are all intertwined which makes for a compelling story. Each having their own struggles and issues, and communication related barrier. The original owner of the rifle has a deaf-mute daughter he has trouble communicating with after her mother commits suicide. Very well done, except one major complaint.There are some very sexually explicit scenes involving children that were pretty much unessecary in making this a great movie. I personally, think it's tragic for people to accept having scenes like this in movies, that make it somehow acceptable. It's not ground breaking, it's just violating. And, I always thinks it's a bit of a farce when this is included in a movie that otherwise would be phenomenal on it's own merit. It just seems like a weak way to include some ""shock"" factor, when it's not needed, and dumbs down the movie. I could care less to see that, and didn't understand it's place in the movie, except to push the envelope. That could have been done in more valuable ways. Hence, why my rating is only a 3. But, otherwise, the storyline is great, and very interesting. I like movies that have a lot of moving parts, and stories happening in many places.

1044595,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B000MCH5P4,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[8, 10]","Since the times of David Ward Griffith' s Intolerance - the supreme Godfather of the rest of the American filmmakers - in 1916, I had never seen before another film so rich in textures, epic stature, tragic consistence, existential meaning and chromatic variations about the human behavior, no matter the proceeding latitude. Alejandro Gonzalez I&ntilde;arritu employs the desert not only as a visual resource but as a big tapestry on which exposes, warns and denounces some aberrant ways of thinking, feeling, and living.The desert to my mind, is the key to find important references in this sense. First at all, the desert as wasteland, the last frontier of the unthinkable or unimaginable: Marrakech: a rifle, two children at the eve of their growing up maturity, who are really convinced about the innocence of their insane action, exemplifies the ingenuity is masked of an invisible violence almost genetic, inherited by ancestors. In his family, the boredom and penuries also constitute a wilderness of affective deficit.Second: The North American couple who travels to Marrakech and just want to feel the silence (Remember the clever line pronounced by Pitt), once more the desert of the miscommunication, the existential boredom makes he had decided to go in search of that vanished experience.Third: the desert of the soul in the Mexican housekeeper who breaks the rules in order to share an evening of solace amusement to be present in her son's wedding.Four: the desert of the loneliness due the deafness in one of the most cosmopolitan cities of the world, where the young people gather in a noisy oasis, but that sensitive girl with serious emotional sequels, just wishes to be listened and loved, but her restriction defines for the rest of the people, a desert of merciless intolerance signed by a supposed reference frame; when smartly the director opens the objective of the camera to show us the variegated swarm of human people joining in the intersections of two avenues.Five: the desert of the self-centered attitude ( the desert of the selfishness) of the rest of the passengers who accompanied to the young couple fallen in disgrace due that absurd incident.Six: the desert of the linguistic barriers who makes us feel like the deaf girl, when we listen without understanding and need our conventional and universally prosthesis device: the subtitles in our own language.Seven: the desert of the legal rules at the moment of the return from Mexico. There are no arguments. The law is the law (Kafka' s echoes?)Eighth: the desert of the affective silence who is beautifully depicted in the last shot of the film.The script is admirably made, with a perfect edition process ( I guess this will be one of the secure awards the next February 25), the employment of the music as dramatic support, as well as the rest of secondary dramatic lines as the imprudence of the housekeeper, the ignorance of the destructive power of a weapon and the legal barriers in which the political environment seemed to prevail above the value of a human life at the moment to rescue to Cate Blanchet in the middle of nowhere.If the desert was a smart metaphor employed by Stroheim in Greed, John Huston in The treasure of the sierra Madre, David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia and Stanley Kubrick in the first movement of 2001, this talented director employed it as a big frame to make us understand the globalization still remains into the closet and just applies for science and development for totally restricted to other areas of the humankind.A true thousand carats  film, that should be win the Academy Award the next 25.

1044601,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000MCH5P4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 7]","Such a film could be considered as a manifesto about the state of the globalized world right in the middle of the war on terror. A manifesto against that war on terror because it does not consider human needs and particularly the desires, the wants and the wishes, not to speak of the impulses and other drives, hungers and passions, of the young, all ages considered, from 5 to 35. The film shows how the war on terror creates unsolvable situations in which human beings are literally tumbled and spinned actually and really to death. It transforms divisions and divides into uncrossable barriers and frontiers and borders.The film shows how the US-Mexico border is turned into a trap for simple people, including children who are absolutely innocent of any crime and are made guilty of fantasmagoric and incredibly inhuman menaces revealing that the real menace to humanity is not on the side of the illegal immigrant but on the side of the neurotic and psychotic US government, citizens, police, and other uniformed personnel.Then the film shifts to Morocco where a busload of tourists get trapped in the mountain because two vain boys are trying to show off to each other how they can shoot a gun better than the other. It wounds an American woman and the war on terror transforms an insignificant local event into a global menace blocking the necessary helicopter in Casablanca for at least two days. What could and would have been done in twelve hours before, now takes at least forty eight hours and involves the State Secretary instead of keeping the problem at the proper level of a consul. The life of the woman is thus endangered and jeopardized by and for the political ambitions of some Washington-DC paranoid politicians. Then we move to Japan and there some deaf and mute girls nearly create a situation by trying to satisfy their sexual drives at any cost in a society where boys their age are considering them as monsters, at first, and then as nothing but live pleasure dollies. That leads to the last level of denunciation. Kids are made paranoid in our developed countries and plain irresponsible in third world countries : the latter shoot at a bus for fun because they have been accustomed and conditioned into accepting it as normal though it goes against the very grain of their culture. The association of this act to incestuous voyeurism and sexual onanism shows that it is the context we create that makes kids become what we call terrorists, though they are only kids space-out by the cultural shock that brings the two sides of a divide into clashing to the finish. And the whole film is pervaded, from title to end, with the impossibility to communicate : many languages are colliding here and there, now and then, but also all our media are exploding our codes of values, be they traditional or educational. When globalization is based on fear, paranoia and an overpowered fantasmagoric survival instinct, we can only produce a total breakdown.

1044604,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000MCH5P4,James Hiller,"[10, 14]","The biblical tower of Babel created the myriad of languages that we speak on Earth, or so the story goes. We developed over time different ways, different cultures, and those differences are often driving points in the global conflicts that we face today. However, in Babel, despite the language and cultural separations, we are really connected by strings, connected by being the humans that we are. This connectivity is explored in this thought provoking movie.We start with a Moroccan family, two young brothers who love each other, despite their constant and common sibling bickering. Their fahter is sold a high quality rifle to scare off jackals from his herd of sheep, and gives it to the oldest son, who works in the field. The younger son is a natural shot, as is proven early on during their target practice. Trying to both prove to each other their manliness, and the power of the rifle, the two brothers stand on top of a mountain hilltop, and take a potshot at a bus, rather nonchalantly. The bus stops, and the drama quickly escalates.Brad Pitt and my personal favorite actress Cate Blanchette play an American couple struggling with the death of one of their children. They are on a tour of Morocco with a group of internationals, and are riding the ill-fated bus. Meanwhile, their two surviving children are staying with their live-in nanny, a second mother really, who desires to go to their son's wedding in Mexico. A fourth story comes in with a deaf-mute Japanese girl struggling with her sense of belonging and sexuality, and somehow mysteriously is tied into the other three stories.Each story has a thread, if somewhat thin, that links it together, and by the end of the movie, all becomes clear as to how they are linked and why. Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's deft handling of what could be a confusing conundrum of a plot makes the film both entertaining, heartbreaking, and suspenseful. A proven master of such story telling (yes, he made the brilliant Amores Perros!), Babel thrives in his vision.The standout of this movie, however, is not the often-cited Mr. Pitt, whom cameras follow around at will. Nope, the two standout performances were THANKFULLY acknowledge by AMPAS. First, Rinko Kikuchi's stunning performance as Cheiko, the deaf mute Japanese girl, is breathless, stunning, amazing. Whenever she appeared on the screen, her sadness and confusion was so real. She nearly steals this movie. As she longs to be a part of the world that she sees around her, you realize that every story has people in it that don't quite belong either, and we have another thread.And if it's even possible, Adriana Barraza's performance as Amelia, the Mexican nanny, delivers a performance that I now believe should get the Best Supporting Actress for this year (and I'm a grat Jennifer Hudson fan!). She starts off tame enough; we've all seen this performance a hundred times before. But then, as her story progresses, and she descends into a personal hell, her story becomes so heartbreaking that I wanted to reach through the screen and take her into my arms myself. She conveys such pride and sorrow in her final scene in the movie where she attempts to justify her actions; you know what's happened, why it happened, and it both outrages you and breaks your heart. Give Barraza the Oscar now!Babel is not a film for everyone.

1044608,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000MCH5P4,Jason,"[5, 10]","If it weren't so pretentious and boring, Babel would have been a good movie.  A Japanese guy takes his rifle - which may or may not have been used by his wife during her suicide - to Morocco for a hunting expedition.  He gives the rifle to his guide as a gift.  For about 50 shiny rocks and a goat the guide barters his rifle to a completely irresponsible goat herder and father of two young boys, one of whom enjoys pleasuring himself while fantasizing about the moments he goes all Porky's on his prepubescent sister while watching her undress.  This, of course, leads to a potential international terrorism scandal when the goat-herder's young onanist tests the weapon's muzzle velocity and trajectory, fires a single round at the front of a tour bus, watches the bullet take a few JFK turns, entering the driver's side about ten rows back, making contact with the shoulder/neck of an emotionally dead American woman who, along with her husband, are on a Moroccan vacation (shortly after their newborn died of SIDS) and in sudden, desperate need of competent medical attention covered by their HMO while their two, spoiled young children are in the incompetent hands of their illegal immigrant nanny who, driven by her irresponsible relative, needs to travel illegally across the border - again - to attend her nephew's incredibly long and inconsequential wedding in what is presumably Tijuana while the original Japanese gift giver's deaf, mute daughter is going commando throughout the day, flashing her unshaven pubic region to every effeminate Japanese man she can find - there are plenty - and attempting to seduce her middle-aged dentist by licking his face.Speaking of dentists, don't let my first paragraph fool you; the film is brutally long, disconnected, and painful, just like each visit to the dentist.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's methods of weaving subplots are tenuous at best, and he could learn a thing or two fromThe Human Centipedeabout connections and suffering.  If suffering is the primary requirement for award nomination, then THC should have far more praise than Babel.  The only people who suffer worse than the protagonists in this film are the viewers.  The writing leaves countless loose ends, and, my goodness, the editing.  Talk about unbearable melodrama.  A good hour could have been cut from the run-time without a single loss of comprehension.Nothing more than contrived political, cultural commentary, Babel is self-indulgant, undeserving of an Academy Award, and poorly crafted.  Yes, poorly crafted.  We need 30 combined minutes of a deaf person's interpretation of a disco, and the drunk happenings at a Mexican wedding, but we don't get to learn what happens to the criminal Moroccan kid, the criminal Mexican joy-rider, or how the WASP left baking in the desert were found?  What about the stars you ask?  Star power, shmar power.  Other than when she was popping a squat over a bed pan, Cate Blanchett essentially got a high paying gig for taking a nap.  There were nearly as many lines for Bernie in Weekend at Bernie's 2!  And he was dead the entire movie!

A bit too graphic at times, primarily sexually, but otherwise artfully put together, showing how we remain connected, across the world, despite huge misunderstandings because of language. It came out quite clearly that language is culture, and culture is language. Even within a culture differences in understanding occur between the deaf and the hearing, or the Hispanic and Anglic cultures.I loved this movie because 1/3 of it was filmed in Morocco, and even takes place there, at a place I've been to, the area around Erfoud and Ait Benhaddou. I even had friends trying out for the position of tourists on the bus. There was Moroccan Arabic throughout the movie, although not always translated completely correctly. (""Please"", instead of the stronger, ""May God have mercy on your parents."" for ""Allayrahim alwaladin."") It accurately displayed life for the Berbers in the East central desert region, although I fear that a couple references will make people misunderstand Morocco. A shooting occurs in the desert, injuring an American tourist. Something important to understand the subtext of the movie is how rare this is and how illegal it is to even own a gun. Even the police have empty holsters. Morocco isn't dangerous, certainly not compared to the U.S. 20,000 gun deaths last year in the U.S.; zero in Morocco. Secondly, there's a comment about not drinking the water as it could be contaminated. While it may take a bit to adjust to new bacteria in any foreign setting, I have drunk the water in most areas of Morocco without problem.The theme of cultural difference comes through the clearest perhaps in Morocco. The pivotal moment of the movie is seen in how medical care occurs. I unfortunately can't reveal it for risk of spoiler, but if you look for it, it is gut-wrenching, and shaming. Throughout we are treated to the importance of privilege, simply because of birth.

I expected the stories to be connected in a strenuous manner. Instead, I was treated with an interesting and emotionally satisfying production that succeeds in making a point that the world is a very small place. Brad Pitt is barely recognizable with a beard and several wrinkles. But the imperfection of his features doesn't matter when compared with the realistic passion behind his performance as the husband to his wife, Cate Blanchett, that mistrusts him. When his wife suffers from a bullet wound, you forget all about his stardom and focus on his love. Blanchett has less of a role to play as the wounded wife, but she effortlessly conveys the layers of her relationship with her husband behind the pain and anguish of her suffering.The two Moroccan boys who shot her are part of a separate but interlocking story about a rural family in Morocco that just purchased its first rifle. When one of the boys shoots at the bus Blancett is on, it sets off a chain reaction that sends Morocco and America into political turmoil, not to mention their family. There are no-name actors here, and they are not particularly stunning, but their story is touching. Another storyline, possibly the least memorable of the four, involves the children of Pitt and Blanchett and their Mexican nanny who takes them across the border. Gael Garcia Bernal is terribly underused in this portion of the movie, but when he is on screen he steals the show.The best and the most disturbing storyline is that of Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi), a deaf-mute Japanese girl suffering from unsatisfied sexuality. The lengths to which she goes to fulfill her desires are pitiful and moving, and her character is the most nuanced in the movie.This film does show a global class system where Americans are treated with more respect than those from third world countries. The goat-herders are brutalized by their own police, and the Mexicans are viewed with suspicion and contempt by the U.S. border patrol. The film wants us to sympathize with the underdogs. I've enjoyed most of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu previous work and this film isn't any different. The adaptation of each segment of this film has a respective regional style. The Moroccan track looks like an Arabic drama, the Mexican scenes have a flavor that is but too familiar to I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, while the Japanese story is told in a style and filmed in colors that remind the Japanese thrillers. Nice idea. The plots twist and curl around each other to form an amazing vine, a vine with an important message.",4,I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu tackles another amazing film,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,2652,"['difficult', 'make', 'one', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'make', 'three', 'good', 'short', 'movies', 'expected', 'stories', 'be', 'connected', 'strenuous', 'manner', 'Instead', 'was', 'treated', 'interesting', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'production', 'making', 'point', 'world', 'very', 'small', 'place', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'beard', 'several', 'wrinkles', 'imperfection', 'features', ""n't"", 'matter', 'when', 'compared', 'realistic', 'passion', 'performance', 'husband', 'wife', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'When', 'wife', 'suffers', 'bullet', 'wound', 'forget', 'stardom', 'focus', 'love', 'Blanchett', 'less', 'role', 'play', 'wounded', 'wife', 'effortlessly', 'conveys', 'layers', 'relationship', 'husband', 'pain', 'anguish', 'suffering.The', 'two', 'Moroccan', 'boys', 'who', 'shot', 'are', 'part', 'separate', 'interlocking', 'story', 'rural', 'family', 'Morocco', 'just', 'purchased', 'first', 'rifle', 'When', 'one', 'boys', 'shoots', 'bus', 'Blancett', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'Morocco', 'America', 'political', 'turmoil', 'not', 'mention', 'family', 'are', 'no-name', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'story', 'touching', 'storyline', 'possibly', 'least', 'memorable', 'four', 'children', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'Mexican', 'nanny', 'who', 'border', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'terribly', 'underused', 'portion', 'movie', 'when', 'screen', 'show.The', 'best', 'most', 'disturbing', 'storyline', 'Chieko', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'deaf-mute', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'suffering', 'unsatisfied', 'sexuality', 'lengths', 'fulfill', 'desires', 'are', 'pitiful', 'moving', 'character', 'most', 'nuanced', 'movie.This', 'film', 'show', 'global', 'class', 'system', 'where', 'Americans', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'respect', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'goat-herders', 'are', 'brutalized', 'own', 'police', 'Mexicans', 'are', 'viewed', 'suspicion', 'contempt', 'U.S.', 'border', 'patrol', 'film', 'sympathize', 'underdogs', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'most', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'previous', 'work', 'film', ""n't"", 'different', 'adaptation', 'segment', 'film', 'respective', 'regional', 'style', 'Moroccan', 'track', 'Arabic', 'drama', 'Mexican', 'scenes', 'have', 'flavor', 'too', 'familiar', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Japanese', 'story', 'told', 'style', 'filmed', 'colors', 'remind', 'Japanese', 'thrillers', 'Nice', 'idea', 'plots', 'twist', 'curl', 'around', 'other', 'form', 'amazing', 'vine', 'vine', 'important', 'message']",N/A

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett head the credits, but surprisingly share the real leads with Adriana Barranza, who plays a loving Mexican housekeeper, and the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi, a deaf Japanese teenager struggling with the demons of disability, adolescence, and the death of her mother. I thought the most compelling themes of the film were about responsibility, fault and guilt. In a world where the random act of a Japanese traveler giving a gift to his guide on a hunting trip sets in motion events with tragic consequences, how can we ever really know the results of our actions? how can we be held responsible? Is anyone to ""blame"" for what happens to the characters in this film? So much in life is random, but to make sense of it all we search for perpetrators, with often disastrous results.An older, worn and tired Brad Pitt is excellent in this movie. His prominence on the cover of People magazine every week masks what a fine actor he really is.

Two boys, left to guard their father's goat, and given a new hunting rifle with which to shoot jackals, do exactly what two young boys would do with a gun - they shoot it, to test both the guns and themselves. The Americans, Pitt and Blanchett, struggle with being American in a foreign country. There is the expectation of immediate medical service, but they are hours from a hospital and, they find, that their own embassy may not be on their side. A deaf Japanese girl struggles with the loss of her mother and acts out sexually in desperate pleas for affection and attention. A Mexican nanny, in charge of watching two American children, takes them across the border so that she can attend her son's wedding.I've seen this film derided for showing a (most likely) pre-pubescent Moroccan boy who watches his sister strip, and afterwards gives himself pleasure. I'll admit that the movie could have survived the excision of that scene, but the general reaction I've noted is disbelief that such events would ever occur. Well, they would. They happen in our country, they happen everywhere. The real question is what was I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu trying to show us, and did it make sense? It seemed - to this reviewer at least - that he was showing us a child forced to grow up too quickly, and the difficulties that youth has when forced to age prematurely. His illustration certainly made sense to me. It could have been shown to us through different events, but ask yourself this: are you likely to ever forget the scene of that boy squatting between the rocks? Probably not.Also, I've seen similar derision regarding the manner in which the deaf girl, Chieko, acts out. That, perhaps, is even more surprising. All teenagers, regardless of handicap, are beset by one thing: hormones. And almost all teenagers, regardless of handicap, have no idea what to do about them. The manner in which every teenager responds is unique. When you factor in that this girl does suffer a handicap that sets her apart from other people her own age - and let's not underestimate the effects of polarizing a teenager - and that she has suffered a traumatic event, it's easy to understand how she could be confused. Could this confusion have been communicated to us differently? Sure, but it wasn't. And it passes the test: it's a believable reaction.The film speaks to us of the domino effect, how one small, seemingly innocent gesture can cause tremors that are felt around the world, and demonstrates that such things can come full circle. While it could be said that this film makes a good argument for gun control, it is not preachy, nor is it a polemic.A solid cast of characters put in good performances. One reviewer raved about Cate Blanchett. Don't get me wrong, she's wonderful, but this film didn't ask much of her. Rinko Kikuchi, who played the deaf Japanese girl, was believable and was nominated for an Oscar, but to me, the person who stole the show was the American children's nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza).4 stars.",4,Scattered to the four corners of the world,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,3858,"['Biblical', 'story', 'title', 'film', 'people', 'world', 'spoke', 'one', 'language', 'were', 'building', 'together', 'tower', 'reach', 'heavens', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'so', 'hinder', 'ability', 'work', 'together', 'confounded', 'languages', 'then', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'careful', 'things', 'scattered', 'earth', 'wonder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'get', 'along', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Big', 'Guy', 'working', 'eleventh', 'book', 'Genesis', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Babel', 'one', 'complete', 'story', 'formed', 'smaller', 'stories', 'touch', 'other', 'different', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'however', 'always', 'see', 'done', 'well', 'Director', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', '21', 'Grams', 'one', 'event', 'shooting', 'American', 'tourist', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Morocco', 'world', 'together', 'Two', 'boys', 'left', 'guard', 'father', 'goat', 'given', 'new', 'hunting', 'rifle', 'shoot', 'jackals', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'would', 'do', 'gun', 'shoot', 'test', 'guns', 'Americans', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'struggle', 'being', 'American', 'foreign', 'country', 'expectation', 'immediate', 'medical', 'service', 'are', 'hours', 'hospital', 'find', 'own', 'embassy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'side', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'loss', 'mother', 'out', 'sexually', 'desperate', 'pleas', 'affection', 'attention', 'Mexican', 'nanny', 'charge', 'watching', 'two', 'American', 'children', 'border', 'can', 'attend', 'son', 'wedding.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'derided', 'showing', 'most', 'likely', 'pre-pubescent', 'Moroccan', 'boy', 'who', 'sister', 'strip', 'afterwards', 'pleasure', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'excision', 'scene', 'general', 'reaction', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'disbelief', 'such', 'events', 'would', 'ever', 'occur', 'Well', 'would', 'happen', 'country', 'happen', 'everywhere', 'real', 'question', 'what', 'was', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'trying', 'show', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'seemed', 'reviewer', 'least', 'was', 'showing', 'child', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'quickly', 'difficulties', 'youth', 'when', 'forced', 'age', 'prematurely', 'illustration', 'certainly', 'made', 'sense', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'different', 'events', 'ask', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'forget', 'scene', 'boy', 'squatting', 'rocks', 'Probably', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'derision', 'regarding', 'manner', 'deaf', 'girl', 'Chieko', 'out', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'teenagers', 'regardless', 'handicap', 'are', 'beset', 'one', 'thing', 'hormones', 'almost', 'teenagers', 'regardless', 'handicap', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'manner', 'teenager', 'unique', 'When', 'factor', 'girl', 'suffer', 'handicap', 'apart', 'other', 'people', 'own', 'age', 'let', 'not', 'underestimate', 'effects', 'polarizing', 'teenager', 'suffered', 'traumatic', 'event', 'easy', 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'confused', 'Could', 'confusion', 'have', 'been', 'communicated', 'differently', 'Sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'test', 'believable', 'reaction.The', 'film', 'speaks', 'domino', 'effect', 'how', 'one', 'small', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'gesture', 'can', 'cause', 'tremors', 'are', 'felt', 'world', 'such', 'things', 'can', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'good', 'argument', 'gun', 'control', 'not', 'preachy', 'polemic.A', 'solid', 'cast', 'characters', 'put', 'good', 'performances', 'One', 'reviewer', 'raved', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'wonderful', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'who', 'played', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'was', 'believable', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'person', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'American', 'children', 'nanny', 'Amelia', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', '.4', 'stars']",N/A

1044633,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000MCH5P4,Joseph Haschka,"[2, 5]","BABEL's aggregate is less than each of its three component parts.While on a marriage-healing trip to Morocco, Susan (Cate Blanchett) is seriously wounded by a bullet coming through the window of their tourist bus out in the middle of nowhere. Husband Richard (Brad Pitt) is visibly agitated.In San Diego, Amelia (Adraina Barraza), the Latino nanny to two young, blonde, and blatantly WASPish children, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), takes her charges on an unauthorized hop across the border into Mexico so she can attend her son's wedding; Amelia has been temporarily left alone to watch the kids, and she can't find anyone to care for them in her absence. The three are driven by Amelia's irresponsible nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal).In Japan, Chieko ( Rinko Kikuchi), a pretty, deaf-mute, teenage girl, is suffering a severe lack of self-esteem. Her mother recently committed suicide by gunshot. The police want to interview her father, and Chieko assumes the two events are related. As her father is gone most of the day and evening, Chieko lives virtually alone in an upscale Tokyo high-rise. Apparently equating her self-worth with her sexual allure, the girl has been unable to attract a male to relieve her of her virginity despite the most forward (and clumsy) attempts at seduction, and she's approaching a crisis of despair.Though not immediately apparent to the viewer, the three subplots of BABEL are related. Each is superbly acted; there's the potential for Oscar nods for Pitt, Barraza, and Kikuchi (who, in real life, is neither hearing nor speech impaired). Each subplot, on its own and expanded somewhat, could have powerfully served as illustration of the theme, which is that tragic situations can evolve from bad choices exacerbated by an inability to communicate. However, in the case of this otherwise excellent film, the three subplots strung together result in a production that's too long; I'm deducting a star. Perhaps the director should have considered three separate releases, much as Krzysztof Kieslowski did with his Colors Trilogy (RED, WHITE and BLUE).At times, especially in Morocco, BABEL achieves a cinema verite grittiness reminiscent of the recent contemporary Western starring Tommy Lee Jones, THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA.

1044634,A3RY85QM7F3XF6,B000MCH5P4,Josh Brooks,"[5, 8]","Babel is a film that involved 4 interwoven stories that have effects on each life involved. Each story is related to political and racial differences, and a lot of tense drama is involved. Sounds a bit like Crash, right? Well, yeah, but these two films are on two different levels.While Crash had tons of known stars in it, Babel settled with just Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett to carry the film's star quota while rendering the rest of the characters to a lot of unknown artists. A surprise to go along with this is that although Brad and Cate's characters are the center of the stories, their screentime is as equal or under the screentime of the other stories. And it worked very well.After two careless kids accidentally shoot a tourist in the Morrocan desert, a series of lives are affected all around the world. From the owner of the gun who resides in Japan, to his daughter, to the babysitter of the kids of the tourist who was shot. Each life involved changes in different ways. And this leads to some intense scenes, some heartbreaking revelations, and soul-searching answers.One thing that could be a downer - but for me wasn't - is the story of the gun owner's daughter, Chieko. Her story is completely disassociated from the rest of the film, but in the context of viewing the film as a anthology of personal problems and discoveries, then I think it works well.I think that's appropriate.

I'm usually pretty good at predicting the Best Picture winner at the Oscars, but this year was difficult. I thought it was a toss-up between The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, and Babel. Well, The Departed won 4 Oscars and Babel won one (Best Original Score)...Never the less, ""Babel"" is one of the best films of 2006. It's directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and written by Guillermo Arriaga, the same writer/director team behind ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams."" I thought ""21 Grams"" was the fourth best film of the year, the year it came out...""Babel"" is just as good, if not better. It takes place in four countries (mostly in 3), it's in 4 languages, and is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the most important. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard and Susan, a rich couple touring Morocco. Their marriage is on the rocks and something tragic has recently happened to them. Things take a turn for the worst when two young boys, armed with a rifle, accidentally shoot her from a mountaintop. The shooting, which is believed to be the work of terrorists, is suddenly all over the news and Richard is fighting to keep Susan alive even though he can't get her to a hospital or get an ambulance to get her. In San Diego, California where their nanny Amelia (Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza) is watching their two children Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), while trying to figure out a way to make it to her sons wedding in Mexico. When she can't find anyone to look after the children, she has her nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal) take her and the children to Mexico. Everything goes smoothly until they run into problems at the border on the way back. Millions of miles away in Japan is Chieko (Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuechi), a deaf and mute girl yearning for attention from both her father and other men. This movie presented a truly surprising year at the Academy Awards. Unknowns' Barraza and Kikuechi were nominated for Oscars, while leading man Pitt was shut out. Watching the film, it's easy to see why. Barraza is probably the actress that most deserved the Oscar this year (although I haven't seen ""Dreamgirls"" so my opinion is a bit unfounded). Kikuechi doesn't say a word in the film and yet delivers one of the best performances of the year. Brad Pitt delivers his best performance ever and I'm surprised after watching it he didn't get an Oscar nomination. Even though he wouldn't have beat Forest Whitaker or Peter O'Toole, I'm surprised his performance didn't even get noticed. ""Babel"" was an Oscar front-runner, but it actually got mixed reviews. It ended up on a lot of top ten lists, but a lot of critics (namely A.O. Scott and Michael Phillips) shut the film out. It is a film that won't appeal to the average American audience, because Americans don't like to read movies but this is a great film that I think some people would benefit from seeing. It has a lot to say about America and people, although I found a revelation at the end of the film to be a little confusing. The movie runs 135 minutes, but feels much shorter because it breezes through these stories and never overstays its welcome. The Oscar-winning score is terrific and, even, at times, haunting.GRADE: A-",5,One of the Best Films of the Year,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,3365,"['Babel', 'was', 'nominated', 'several', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'had', 'previously', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Golden', 'Globe', ""'m"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'good', 'predicting', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'Oscars', 'year', 'was', 'difficult', 'thought', 'was', 'toss-up', 'Departed', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Babel', 'Well', 'Departed', 'won', '4', 'Oscars', 'Babel', 'won', 'one', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'Never', 'less', 'Babel', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'written', 'Guillermo', 'Arriaga', 'same', 'writer/director', 'team', 'Amores', 'Perros', '21', 'Grams', 'thought', '21', 'Grams', 'was', 'fourth', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'Babel', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'place', 'four', 'countries', 'mostly', '3', '4', 'languages', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'play', 'Richard', 'Susan', 'rich', 'couple', 'touring', 'Morocco', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'something', 'tragic', 'recently', 'happened', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'worst', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'armed', 'rifle', 'accidentally', 'shoot', 'mountaintop', 'shooting', 'believed', 'be', 'work', 'terrorists', 'suddenly', 'news', 'Richard', 'fighting', 'keep', 'Susan', 'alive', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hospital', 'get', 'ambulance', 'get', 'San', 'Diego', 'California', 'where', 'nanny', 'Amelia', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'watching', 'two', 'children', 'Debbie', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Mike', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'sons', 'wedding', 'Mexico', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'look', 'children', 'nephew', 'Santiago', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'take', 'children', 'Mexico', 'Everything', 'smoothly', 'run', 'problems', 'border', 'way', 'back', 'Millions', 'miles', 'away', 'Japan', 'Chieko', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Rinko', 'Kikuechi', 'deaf', 'mute', 'girl', 'yearning', 'attention', 'father', 'other', 'men', 'movie', 'presented', 'truly', 'surprising', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Unknowns', 'Barraza', 'Kikuechi', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'leading', 'man', 'Pitt', 'was', 'shut', 'out', 'Watching', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Barraza', 'probably', 'actress', 'most', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'year', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dreamgirls', 'opinion', 'bit', 'unfounded', 'Kikuechi', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'film', 'yet', 'delivers', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'beat', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", ""'m"", 'surprised', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'noticed', 'Babel', 'was', 'Oscar', 'front-runner', 'actually', 'got', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'ended', 'up', 'lot', 'top', 'ten', 'lists', 'lot', 'critics', 'namely', 'A.O', 'Scott', 'Michael', 'Phillips', 'shut', 'film', 'out', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'average', 'American', 'audience', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'read', 'movies', 'great', 'film', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'lot', 'say', 'America', 'people', 'found', 'revelation', 'end', 'film', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', 'movie', '135', 'minutes', 'feels', 'much', 'shorter', 'stories', 'never', 'welcome', 'Oscar-winning', 'score', 'terrific', 'even', 'times', 'haunting.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

1044637,A34792YZU3EH56,B000MCH5P4,J. Swagman,"[5, 8]","This movie is often compared with movies like Crash, Traffic, and Syriana, and with good reason. (In fact while watching this movie I thought it had been made by the same people as those other movies, but according to wikipedia apparently not). It uses the same kind of directing and the same kind of story telling though. And the same idea of having 4 separate stories, loosely connected with each other but all dealing with similar themes.As the title suggests, the main theme of this movie is language, but some of these four stories are more language related than others.There are a number of points in the movie where characters do things that are illogical or don't seem to make a lot of sense. Of course people in real life do things that don't make a lot of sense, so it is difficult to know how critical to be of this. But there were a number of points in the movie where my friend and I said to each other: ""Now why doesn't he just do this instead of that?"" Or ""That doesn't make any sense. If she would only do that all the problems would be over.""The Japanese segments deal with a deaf mute girl who can only communicate with sign language. (I thought I was going to get an opportunity to test my Japanese language skills out during this film, but the majority of the Japanese segments deals with sign language).Interesting factiod: did you know that Japanese sign language is different than American sign language? I just assumed it was a universal language, but it's not. (This came up in a lesson from the textbook we taught out of last year: the difference between American and Japanese sign language).Both of the main Japanese actors looked very familiar to me while watching the movie. It took me a while to place them but Rinko Kikuchi was also in ""69"" and Koji Yakusho, who played the father, has actually been in a number of famous Japanese movies, including the main part in ""The Choice of Hercules"" and the American movie ""Memoirs of a Geisha"".",3,"Some plot holes, but still a good film",1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,1967,"['movie', 'often', 'compared', 'movies', 'Crash', 'Traffic', 'Syriana', 'good', 'reason', 'fact', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'same', 'people', 'other', 'movies', 'according', 'wikipedia', 'apparently', 'not', 'same', 'kind', 'directing', 'same', 'kind', 'story', 'telling', 'same', 'idea', 'having', '4', 'separate', 'stories', 'loosely', 'connected', 'other', 'dealing', 'similar', 'themes.As', 'title', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'language', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'language', 'related', 'others.There', 'are', 'number', 'points', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'are', 'illogical', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'course', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'difficult', 'know', 'how', 'critical', 'be', 'were', 'number', 'points', 'movie', 'where', 'friend', 'said', 'other', 'Now', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'do', 'instead', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'only', 'do', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'Japanese', 'segments', 'deal', 'deaf', 'mute', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'communicate', 'sign', 'language', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'opportunity', 'test', 'Japanese', 'language', 'out', 'film', 'majority', 'Japanese', 'segments', 'deals', 'sign', 'language', '.Interesting', 'factiod', 'did', 'know', 'Japanese', 'sign', 'language', 'different', 'American', 'sign', 'language', 'just', 'assumed', 'was', 'universal', 'language', 'not', 'came', 'up', 'lesson', 'textbook', 'taught', 'last', 'year', 'difference', 'American', 'Japanese', 'sign', 'language', '.Both', 'main', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'looked', 'very', 'familiar', 'watching', 'movie', 'took', 'while', 'place', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'was', 'also', '69', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'who', 'played', 'father', 'actually', 'been', 'number', 'famous', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'including', 'main', 'part', 'Choice', 'Hercules', 'American', 'movie', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha']",N/A

1044644,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000MCH5P4,Kaya Savas,"[3, 5]","MOVIE: Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has established himself as a raw and powerful filmmaker. While he doesn't have a lot of films under his belt he definitely showed us what he can do with Amores Perros and 21 Grams. Inarritu's friend and screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga, has also established himself as a great writer. Arriaga is a great storyteller who does his best work when he writes in a non-linear fashion. The two match up perfectly and deliver us a raw, powerful, and emotional experience with Babel. The premise is an interesting one; how does one event affect people in three different locations around the world? The idea alone would cause any writer a headache just trying to make it work, but I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga make it work almost perfectly.A Japanese hunter travels to Morocco and gives his rifle to his hunting guide as a present and a token of thanks. This hunting guide then sells the gun to a local man who herds goats in a small villiage. He leaves the gun with his sons and tells them to fend off any Jackals that try to kill the goats. While they are testing the gun the kids are convinced that the bullets don't go far, so they shoot at a tour bus that is driving down the road and think that nothing happens all until the bus swerves to a stop and panic ensues. An American couple on vacation (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are now in peril after the wife is shot during the incident. In the middle of nowhere it is pure chaos as the husband does everything in his limited power to save his wife. This incident now directly affects a Mexican woman back in San Diego, who is the housekeeper of the American couple in Morocco. Due to the incident, she is left with the kids in San Diego, but needs to leave to attend her son's wedding in Mexico. Without anybody to look after the kids she takes them along and things go from good to horribly bad as they try to cross back into the United States. Back in Japan we deal with the daughter of the Japanese hunter, who is deaf-mute. The Japanese storyline has the least to do with the central storyline, but is important nonetheless. This deaf girl lives a life of always being judged and ignored by people and only has her close friends who are also deaf-mute. She deals with sexual frustration since no man ever wants to even spend time with her, so she feels unloved and alone. These are the storylines.The film switches back and forth between the storylines, but not in a linear fashion. We will see a section of one storyline and then jump back a bit to see the other one. So, simply, the screen is not split into thirds so we cannot see each storyline at the same time. We will see a part of one storyline, but during that time the other storylines are occurring so we need to jump back in time to catch up the other storylines. It may sound confusing, but trust me it really isn't. This film is incredibly easy to follow, and thankfully that allows the emotional impact to be so much greater. What I love about Inarritu and Arriaga is that they know the fundamental rule of film, and that is to ""show, don't tell"". They know that film is a visual medium and that's how they tell the story. The dialogue is minimal in the film, and there are many shots of people, faces, expressions, settings, etc. They really bring you to the different locations. The film is shot in the documentary ""shakey"" camera style, shot mostly or even all on digital from what I could tell. Although there were a few scenes that looked like it could have been film, so I'm not too sure about it. Anyway, the style works to captivate the audience completely. Some moments are so full of emotion that it will bring you to cry and tremble. The film is a dark and depressing look at the human condition, the way we have separated ourselves in our own respective cultures and how that causes conflict and friction. The film is also enhanced greatly by Gustavo Santaolalla's subtle and powerful score. Personally, I absolutely hated Brokeback Mountain's score and thought that it winning the Oscar was a travesty. However, I absolutely loved this score, it was truly phenomenal. Usually scores in films like these are not thematic, but this score was incredibly thematic and does wonders to enhance the visuals. Look for another Santaolalla nomination this year.The Japanese storyline shows us that even in our own culture, the lack of communication completely isolates us. In a powerful scene we see the Japanese girl walk into a pulse pounding night club where the music is blasting and people are dancing. We switch back and forth from the girl's perspective where all we hear is silence. The scene evolves into an epileptic assault on the audience's senses, the scene goes way too long to make its point. It was the only scene I did not like in the entire film. Going to the Mexican storyline, we spend a lot of time at the wedding, lots of drinking and dancing. Then when the housekeeper tries to cross back into the states and she doesn't have a parent letter of permission things become scary. The main storyline back in Morocco is also harrowing. We see the impact on the Moroccan family where the sons are responsible for the shooting. There are some points in the film where you will be truly shaken to your core. Each storyline compliments the other one and communicates the same thing and that is that humans construct barriers to separate ourselves, but no matter how disconnected we may seem we all live on the same planet and we all affect each other.ACTING: Brad Pitt is labeled as the lead actor in the film, but there is not one actor that carries the film. Each storyline is headlined by different actors, and every single person who appears on screen in this film portrays incredibly real human emotion. Brad Pitt was stunning in the film, and Cate Blanchett was amazing as well. Adriana Barraza plays the Mexican housekeeper and I think she gives the best performance in the entire film. If the Academy does not nominate her performance then there is something seriously wrong with the voters. Some film enthusiasts will notice a few short roles by some famous people. Michael Pe&ntilde;a (Crash, World Trade Center) has a small role as a Border Control officer, and Clifton Collins Jr. (Capote) plays another Border Control officer. For those who think the little girl who plays the daughter of Brad Pitt's and Cate Blanchett's characters looks familiar, she should look familiar. The little girl is played by Elle Fanning, Dakota Fanning's little sister. Rinko Kikuchi plays Chieko, the deaf-mute Japanese girl. This young actress also gives a stunning and magnificent performance that should be recognized at the Oscars. Riveting performances all come together to communicate these storiesBOTTOM LINE: If you want to be compelled by a film, then Babel is the film to see. This is what a great film is. If you want to see masterful directing and writing then this is the perfect example, if you want to see stunning acting then this is the perfect example, but there were a few problems in the editing that bothered and if I could I would knock it down half a star (a feature Amazon should really have for its reviewers). This film needs to be experienced, so do yourself a favor and see it.",5,Babel Is Compelling Filmmaking About Isolation & How Our Cultural Barriers Create Conflict And Friction In The

1044645,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000MCH5P4,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[14, 19]","Hands down, this is Pitt's best work, not only because he veers away from his handsome image, actually looking aged and allowing his performance to ADD to the movie, rather than showcase his looks. As a result, he delivers a standout performance - and the rest of the cast is equally strong.There are three main stories in this movie, all connected, however vaguely. One revolves around a deaf/mute teenager, another about a couple with marital problems (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) traveling to a foreign country and the third dealing with the couple's babysitter. Be forwarned - the film does jump back and forth in time but this all makes sense and I think it is an effective approach. It takes awhile to figure out why the director would use this technique. I think it was used to clarify just how difficult it can be to see a situation in its whole and complex entirety, to see how pieces of individual lives interconnect with others, even if those others are half a world away.What is the particular plot or ""message"" in this movie? That was harder to discern and, if you buy the regular DVD, you should know that Special Features will not help solve any questions about THE MESSAGE of the movie, will not hit you over the head the THE POINT that you are supposed to get (thank goodness). There are no actor or director interviews on it, no interpretations...and I actually LIKED that. This is the sort of movie that shakes one to the core and raises questions about alienation both within one's own culture and when traveling in other cultures, about how one tragic event can be linked to several countries, etc. It raises questions about our role in the world and how hard it can be to make the right decisions in the wake of violent and dangerous situations. I understood how and why certain things happened but I also wondered if certain decisions were ethical or moral....and how they could have been averted, if at all and how a single tragedy might have been prevented from setting off others.For me, misunderstanding and alienation between people, both within and without their home cultures, and how quickly seemingly small actions can lead to tragedy were the themes that struck me most powerfully as I watched this movie. I felt for nearly every character in this film, even those who committed terrible acts, but so many of those were done with a certain naivete or innocence...most of the time. People acted without thinking fully,  not seeing the possible ramifications of their decisions or how things could go so terribly awry.One final suggestion: Please don't try to predict ""what will happen next"" in this film. I guarantee you'll be surprised at some point because the director doesn't follow stereotypes. If you're looking for a film that ties everything up neatly, with no loose ends, this isn't the film for you.But if you're ready to tackle a film that will have you thinking about our place in the world, how people can resolve conflict and understand one another better and (perhaps) reach a point of greater understanding and develop new ways of relating and handling terrible situations, this is a great film for fueling THOSE thoughts.",5,Definitely Pitt's best - and a superb movie - and about the DVD version,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,3182,"['Hands', 'down', 'Pitt', 'best', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'away', 'handsome', 'image', 'actually', 'looking', 'aged', 'allowing', 'performance', 'ADD', 'movie', 'rather', 'showcase', 'looks', 'result', 'standout', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'strong.There', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'stories', 'movie', 'connected', 'however', 'vaguely', 'One', 'deaf/mute', 'teenager', 'couple', 'marital', 'problems', 'played', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'traveling', 'foreign', 'country', 'third', 'dealing', 'couple', 'babysitter', 'Be', 'forwarned', 'film', 'jump', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'sense', 'think', 'effective', 'approach', 'awhile', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'director', 'would', 'use', 'technique', 'think', 'was', 'used', 'clarify', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'see', 'situation', 'whole', 'complex', 'entirety', 'see', 'how', 'pieces', 'individual', 'lives', 'interconnect', 'others', 'even', 'others', 'are', 'world', 'particular', 'plot', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'harder', 'discern', 'buy', 'regular', 'DVD', 'should', 'know', 'Special', 'Features', 'will', 'not', 'help', 'solve', 'questions', 'MESSAGE', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'hit', 'head', 'THE', 'POINT', 'are', 'supposed', 'get', 'thank', 'goodness', 'are', 'actor', 'director', 'interviews', 'interpretations', 'actually', 'LIKED', 'sort', 'movie', 'one', 'core', 'questions', 'alienation', 'one', 'own', 'culture', 'when', 'traveling', 'other', 'cultures', 'how', 'one', 'tragic', 'event', 'can', 'be', 'linked', 'several', 'countries', 'etc', 'questions', 'role', 'world', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'make', 'right', 'decisions', 'wake', 'violent', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'understood', 'how', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'happened', 'also', 'wondered', 'certain', 'decisions', 'were', 'ethical', 'moral', '.and', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'averted', 'how', 'single', 'tragedy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'prevented', 'setting', 'off', 'misunderstanding', 'alienation', 'people', 'home', 'cultures', 'how', 'quickly', 'seemingly', 'small', 'actions', 'can', 'lead', 'tragedy', 'were', 'themes', 'struck', 'most', 'powerfully', 'watched', 'movie', 'felt', 'nearly', 'character', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'committed', 'terrible', 'acts', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'done', 'certain', 'naivete', 'innocence', 'most', 'time', 'People', 'acted', 'thinking', 'fully', 'not', 'seeing', 'possible', 'ramifications', 'decisions', 'how', 'things', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'terribly', 'awry.One', 'final', 'suggestion', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'film', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'point', 'director', ""n't"", 'follow', 'stereotypes', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'everything', 'up', 'neatly', 'loose', 'ends', ""n't"", 'film', 'you.But', ""'re"", 'ready', 'tackle', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'place', 'world', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'understand', 'one', 'better', 'perhaps', 'reach', 'point', 'greater', 'understanding', 'develop', 'new', 'ways', 'relating', 'handling', 'terrible', 'situations', 'great', 'film', 'fueling', 'THOSE', 'thoughts']",N/A

1044648,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000MCH5P4,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[8, 15]","In Genesis Chapter 11 it is said that men, unified under one common language, decided to build a tower that would reach to the heavens, proving that they were greater then God.  They were to call this tower Babel.  God, sensing that united nothing would be impossible for them, confused their languages to prevent the tower from being finished.  Years later people have found the ability to learn other languages but the language barriers still causes lots of problems.  None the least of which is in ""Babel,"" where a lack of communication manages to cause much grief due to simple misunderstandings.  Like ""Crash"" from the year before, ""Babel"" is not a straightforward movie.  It revolves around four storylines in three countries: Mexico, Morocco, and Japan.  All these stories are connected, though it may take time for this to become obvious.  The first storyline revolves around two Moroccan teenagers who are playing with a gun their father just bought in order to protect their flock of sheep.While shooting at a tour bus, they accidently shoot an American tourist (played by Cate Blanchette), which leads to the most obvious story connection in the movie.  Blanchette's husband is played by Brad Pitt, who now has a wife dying of a gunshot wound, and no means of medical support.  This in turn makes the family late in returning home to the states, where the family maid Amelia (Adriana Barraza) decides to take the children to Mexico with her so that she can attend her sons wedding, and finds herself having difficulty getting back into the States at the borderline.  Then we hop over to Japan, where we follow a deaf girl played by Rinko Kikuchi, who feels distanced from her father (Koji Yakusho) and tries solicit her body for sex in a sadly misguided attempt at finding happiness.  The connection between these stories involve everything, and yet nothing at all.If that doesn't make much sense, let me elaborate a bit.  All these stories connect to one main thread.  This much is obvious, otherwise there would be no reason to have the four stories in the first place.  How they all connect is what makes it interesting.  Each one of these individual stories would work well as it's own movie, but is instead molded into one single narrative.  Like ""Crash"" and ""Syriana"" you need to pay close attention to all the storylines, as this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle: Putting together piece by piece until you get the whole picture in plain view.  If you don't have the patience for this type of film making, then it's suggested you skip this movie and watch something less complicated.  Though I was a fan of ""Syriana"" and an even bigger fan of ""Crash,"" I do admit my enthusiasm for this type of film making is wearing just a little bit thin.  It was a novel idea with those two movies, but now I'm getting tired of the whole thing.The one problem you have with these types of movies is that you can't really delve into the storyline of characters with too much detail.  The storyline because it makes no sense outside of a basic summery, and the characters because the characterizations aren't always there.  There is a huge conflict with the screenplay when it comes to the storyline revolving around the deaf Japanese teenager.  Rinko Kikuchi's storyline is the most heartbreaking of the four.  It's the most difficult role to play, and it's conclusion is very bittersweet.  Since this storyline is the emotional high point of the movie though, it's troublesome that this storyline has two huge problems with it.  The first problem is the sexual content in this storyline borders on exploitation despite it's necessity in telling the story.  The second problem is that the Japanese storyline is the weakest link to the whole structure, and could have been completely cut from the movie without anyone noticing that anything was even missing (the only point the Japanese storyline serves is to show that the gun used by the Moroccan boys was given to the father by the girls father).The fact that the most emotional storyline is easy expendable shows that this movie could have used more heart.  The storyline surrounding the Moroccan boys sets off the whole storyline, yet that storyline is the least emotionally involved.  The caretakers trip through the dessert is emotionally involving, yet one wonders whether or not the movie could have survived without it.  Obviously the most important storyline in the movie is that of Brad Pitt, who is desperately trying to save his dying wife with nothing to work with.  On a whole, I guess ""Babel"" works as a mild curiosity.  Watching the movie certainly won't result in boredom, but how does one go back to a movie that adds up to one thing: That someone pulled the trigger and due to a lack of communication in the languages there was chaos.  It's an interesting question to be sure, and one wonders whether or not the film maker would have been better off making a film trilogy instead of forcing three movies into one.  It's a good movie, but I can certainly live if I never see it again.Rating: *** stars",3,Interesting...But Emotionally Pointless,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,5069,"['Genesis', 'Chapter', '11',

This is getting to be a specialty of his. He weaves different plots and characters together in unlikely ways hoping to surprise and enhance the dramatic affect of his storytelling. It brought him wide acclaim for his breakthrough ""Amores Perros"" a funny and thrilling ride for man and dog! The device was a bit more unnecessary in ""21 Grams,"" but that smaller film ended up being my choice for the best acted film of its year. But now he takes his skill and technical prowess to his biggest canvas yet.""Babel"" is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the United States. We follow the interlocking stories of a Moroccan farming family, a couple of American tourists, a disaffected and deaf/mute Japanese schoolgirl, and a Mexican maid and her two American charges. One bullet brings all the stories together. As one of the tourists, Cate Blanchett, is accidentally shot--the repercussions are felt around the world.This is an ambitious picture, and I do believe the narrative framing and structure enhance the overall experience. From a technical standpoint, there is not much more you could ask for--this is an awesome achievement. From editing, score, screenplay, cinematography and art direction--""Babel"" is propelled to the short list of great studio films this year. The acting is uniformly excellent. Brad Pitt as Blanchett's husband and Rinku Kikuchi as the Japanese girl have been singled out repeatedly (and are likely Oscar contenders), but everyone here is in top form. This is heavy drama, and I can understand why that scares some people away--but the payoff is worth it. It is harrowing and unpleasant at times, but riveting and emotional throughout.""Babel"" is clearly a film made with serious intentions--and I'm not entirely sure it's as successful as it hopes to be. The philosophical implications, the biblical allegory, the effort to document the state of the world, the examination of a disaffected society, the randomness of the universal ties that bind, and the commentary at the lack of communication and understanding in the world--it's all here! There are certainly individual moments within ""Babel"" that will strike a chord, and it's definitely an intelligently made film, I just don't necessarily think that it is as ""significant"" as some make it out to be. I admire that it tries to deliver a social commentary without being ""preachy,"" but it moves perilously close at several times (times where 2 seconds of rational thought and explanation could have resolved something--but people were more villainous than understanding). Ultimately, though, I must embrace ""Babel"" as great adult filmmaking and powerful drama. About 4 1/2 stars from me, I'm rounding up for the sheer scope and ambition present.

Since then, he has lost his wife, and he has emotionally lost his daughter.The Morrocian (sp??) has sold the rifle to a local farmer in exchange for half the asking price and a free goat. The farmer lets his two boys keep the rifle while they shepherd the rest of his goats, so they can protect the herd from jackals.The boys argue about the usefulness of the rifle and how worthwhile a shot it is.  The younger of the two is the better shot.  He proves it by making a tourist bus his target for practice.Little does he know, the bus is carrying Brad Pitt and his wife, played by Cate Blanchett.  They're in Morrocco to ""get away"" as Pitt puts it.  The two have some marital and person issues they're both dealing with.  These issues are never brought to the forefront.  So, the audience can only assume it's a subject whose discussion could very well make their marriage crumble.Pitt and Blanchett have two kids left at home.  They are being looked after by a Mexican caretaker named Amelia.  Amelia receives an urgent call stating she must come to Mexico to see her son married.  On the way back, she's stopped by the border patrol.  She's placed under arrest simply because she's an alien who has been working in America for 16 years.Basically, the other theme of Babel is wrong choices, and the consequences because of them.  Should Amelia had left for Mexico?  She put the kids in danger, and then got caught herself.  Should Pitt and Blanchett have gone to Morrocco?  As they learned, the hard way, Morrocco doesn't exactly have the best medical system.  Everything is miles away from everything else.  If they wanted to be alone, they could have gone to an island in the Bahamas.  Should the Japanese hunter have made a better effort to make closure with his daughter? to communicate with her even if she can't speak?  Should the farmer had trusted his two young sons to use the gun properly?Overall, my feeling on the movie is one of overwhelming exhaustion.  Watching the 2.5 hours slip past my eyes is tiring.  It's not just because I feel as if I'm a world traveller now going from Morrocco to Japan to Mexico.  But also because of all the subtitles I had to read.Each of the stories involved in Babel are fascinating, if not emotionally draining.  Life is either slipping away, or has already slipped away from each character in the film.  Each of the stories would have made an excellent film on their own.The tragedy of the life and choices the Japanese girl makes and her final acceptance of finding a way to accept her father for who he is, and vice versa.The story of the Amelia and how she came to America for a better life, traveling to her home country to witness the marriage of her son.  Watching him make a life for himself, while she works hard so far away from him.Whatever the trouble in Brad and Cate's character's marriage is would be a great story to explore, especially given what traged befalls them on a getaway trip.Also, it would be a good story filled with agony and grief about the poor farmer and his sons.My feeling is this: Crash, best picture winner of 2005 did the coincidence story better.",3,Babel: A Long Strange Trip,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,3602,"['Babel', 'Long', 'Strange', 'Trip.Film', 'number', '3', '5', 'years', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominess', 'Babel', 'odd', 'theme', 'occuring', 'films', 'late', 'plot', 'plots', 'more', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'revolving', 'around', 'coincidence', 'Babel', 'one', 'such', 'film.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'revolves', 'single', 'rifle', 'Said', 'rifle', 'first', 'owned', 'Japanese', 'hunter', 'deaf-mute', 'daughter', 'hunter', 'rifle', 'trip', 'then', 'Morrocian', 'who', 'was', 'guide', 'then', 'lost', 'wife', 'emotionally', 'lost', 'daughter.The', 'Morrocian', 'sp', 'sold', 'rifle', 'local', 'farmer', 'exchange', 'asking', 'price', 'free', 'goat', 'farmer', 'two', 'boys', 'keep', 'rifle', 'shepherd', 'rest', 'goats', 'can', 'protect', 'herd', 'jackals.The', 'boys', 'argue', 'usefulness', 'rifle', 'how', 'worthwhile', 'shot', 'younger', 'two', 'better', 'shot', 'making', 'tourist', 'target', 'practice.Little', 'know', 'bus', 'carrying', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'wife', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', ""'re"", 'Morrocco', 'get', 'away', 'Pitt', 'two', 'have', 'marital', 'person', 'issues', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'issues', 'are', 'never', 'brought', 'forefront', 'So', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'subject', 'discussion', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'make', 'marriage', 'crumble.Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'have', 'two', 'kids', 'left', 'home', 'are', 'being', 'looked', 'Mexican', 'caretaker', 'named', 'Amelia', 'Amelia', 'urgent', 'call', 'stating', 'must', 'come', 'Mexico', 'see', 'son', 'married', 'way', 'back', 'stopped', 'border', 'patrol', 'placed', 'arrest', 'simply', 'alien', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'America', '16', 'years.Basically', 'other', 'theme', 'Babel', 'wrong', 'choices', 'consequences', 'Should', 'Amelia', 'had', 'left', 'Mexico', 'put', 'kids', 'danger', 'then', 'got', 'caught', 'Should', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'have', 'gone', 'Morrocco', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'Morrocco', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'best', 'medical', 'system', 'Everything', 'miles', 'away', 'everything', 'else', 'wanted', 'be', 'alone', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'island', 'Bahamas', 'Should', 'Japanese', 'hunter', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'effort', 'make', 'closure', 'daughter', 'communicate', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Should', 'farmer', 'had', 'trusted', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'use', 'gun', 'properly', 'Overall', 'feeling', 'movie', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'exhaustion', 'Watching', '2.5', 'hours', 'slip', 'eyes', 'tiring', 'not', 'just', 'feel', ""'m"", 'world', 'traveller', 'now', 'going', 'Morrocco', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'also', 'subtitles', 'had', 'read.Each', 'stories', 'involved', 'Babel', 'are', 'fascinating', 'not', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'Life', 'either', 'slipping', 'away', 'already', 'slipped', 'away', 'character', 'film', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'film', 'own.The', 'tragedy', 'life', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'final', 'acceptance', 'finding', 'way', 'accept', 'father', 'who', 'vice', 'versa.The', 'story', 'Amelia', 'how', 'came', 'America', 'better', 'life', 'traveling', 'home', 'country', 'witness', 'marriage', 'son', 'Watching', 'make', 'life', 'hard', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'him.Whatever', 'trouble', 'Brad', 'Cate', 'character', 'marriage', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'story', 'explore', 'especially', 'given', 'what', 'traged', 'getaway', 'trip.Also', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'story', 'filled', 'agony', 'grief', 'poor', 'farmer', 'sons.My', 'feeling', 'Crash', 'best', 'picture', 'winner', '2005', 'did', 'coincidence', 'story', 'better']",N/A

1044657,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000MCH5P4,LARRY,"[5, 11]","I truly enjoyed *Babel* as it was similar to *Crash* and *Traffic*.  The only difference is that *Crash* and *Traffic* focuses on incidents happening in America.  *Babel* focuses on how one could impact another across the world.  It was just brilliant!Richard (Pitt) and Susan (Blanchett) are in Morocco for a vacation, hoping to repair their marriage.  While on a tour bus, Susan is suddenly shot and is bleeding.  With limited resources, they are forced to detour to a small town which sets everyone, on the bus, on edge.Meanwhile, 2 local Moroccan boys realize the severity of their actions.  They bury the rifle and act like nothing has happened.Across the world in America, Richard and Susan's kids are being taken care by their Mexican maid.  The Mexican maid is frustrated because she is supposed to go to Mexico for her son's wedding.  With no one willing to watch the kids, she has no choice but to take the kids with her.Somehow, information has been brought up that the rifle once belonged to a Japanese man.  We see a Japanese widower and his relationship with his Deaf daughter, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi, who is not Deaf).Of course, things go wrong.  But the question is what went wrong or what causes things to go wrong?  Language barrier?  Cultural barrier?  The unwillingness to listen and compromise?Each of these stories are not only related but they also have their own little stories.  Richard and Susan have issues to address in order to save their marriage.  The village where the Moroccan boys live face brutality from the UN (?) in order to get answers about this terrorist act.  The Mexican maid and her family deal with the border patrol.  Chieko, believing herself to be ugly, seeks affection from men.The movie was just wonderful.  The cinematography was meaningful.  You have to watch it again to grab the implied meaning or symbolism.  The ONLY thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it was too long.  There were some things that could have been edited or deleted.  (That's why the 4 stars.)Like *Crash* and *Traffic*, I liked this movie because it sparks dialogue with friends and loved ones after viewing.

1044659,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000MCH5P4,Lee Armstrong,"[8, 13]","While much of ""Babel"" made me squirm uncomfortably, it had a powerful cumulative impact.  Nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and winning Best Picture awards from the American Film Institute and the Golden Globes, it is a film with credentials.  The last shot as the camera draws away from the top floor Tokyo skyscraper was breathtaking to me.  Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Best Director award @ Cannes and was nominated for the Oscar.  His film ""Amores Perros,"" loosely translated as ""Love's A B*tch,"" previously won the best foreign language award in Britain.  In that picture he worked with Adriana Barraza who rose to prominence in ""Babel"" with her Best Supporting Actress nomination as Amelia, the Mexican housekeeper who takes the children she cares for to her son's wedding in Mexico.  Brad Pitt has only been nominated for one Oscar (Best Supporting Actor for ""12 Monkeys"" in 1995), but he turns in a finely tuned performance as Richard, a father who grieves the death of a child and finds himself frantically trying to find medical care for his wife.  The emotional territory he traverses in the film is impressive, particularly the phone conversation he has with his son as he tries to pretend that everything's okay while worried that his wife will die on the surgical table.  His body slumps toward the phone like a man on the edge just trying to hang on.  It's one of his best performances.  Playing his wife Susan is Australian actress Cate Blanchett who won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2004 for ""The Aviator"" and was nominated again this year for ""Notes on A Scandal.""  She does a good job as the wounded wife in a foreign land who through this crisis overcomes her grief for her lost child and rediscovers her love for her husband.  Movies about husbands and wives who fall in love with each other always play well with me; and this aspect of this film was most charming, despite the gore.  Rinko Kikuchi who played in the Japanese film ""Ikitai,"" translated as ""Will to Live,"" is stunning as the deaf mute adolescent whose grief for her mother's suicide leads her to act out improperly.  I'm not sure of the name of the Japanese policeman who comes to her apartment to interview her, but it is an excellent, tender scene.  As Chieko, Kikuchi was also nominated for the Oscar from this film.  Gael Garcia Bernal as Santiago gives a good performance as he goes crazy while questioned by a border patrol.  Michael Pena who played the locksmith in ""Crash"" gives a cameo performance as John Border Patrol who apprehends Amelia.  The international scope of the picture is breathtaking as we travel from a Middle Eastern country to Southern California & Mexico to Japan.  While my squirm factor was raised high with some of the blood & gore as well as the adolescent nudity, I came away appreciating this film as one that calls for greater understanding among people.

1044660,A2UJ8CMLTWLVXY,B000MCH5P4,Leslie Halpern,"[5, 5]","""Babel"" is the latest film from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who also served as co-producer with Steve Golin and Jon Kilik.  The story begins in a desolate region in the Moroccan desert where two brainless boys decide to see how far a new rifle can fire by using a tour bus full of people as target practice.  One bullet critically injures an American woman (Cate Blanchett) who along with her husband (Brad Pitt) is recovering from the death of their infant.  This new tragedy follows a series of earlier tragedies (including the suicide of a Japanese woman) and begins another series of tragedies (including the deportation of the couple's illegal immigrant nanny, played beautifully by Adriana Barraza).With the loud, abrasive action jumping back and forth through time, and from place to place (Morocco, Japan, America, and Mexico), and from one story to another, this is an exhausting film to follow.  In one story, the two Moroccan boys and their dysfunctional family try to escape justice.  In a related, but separate story, the American couple (portrayed with great sincerity and passion by Pitt and Blanchett) struggle in a life-or-death situation aided by the incompetent, though sympathetic, locals in a nearby village.  Meanwhile in California, the couple's children are being taken care of by a loving Mexican nanny who foolishly takes the children with her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) to a wild wedding party across the border.  In yet another story, with the most tenuous of thematic threads to link them, a teenaged deaf-mute Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) runs around the city without panties trying to lose her virginity.Each story reveals characters with communication problems:  The American couple can't talk about the baby's death or the husband's earlier desertion; the boys have never told their parents about their sister's incestuous peep shows, the nanny is not only ignorant of the English language, but of American laws; the Japanese girl, who besides having difficulty communicating with anyone who's not deaf, has a strange and strained relationship with her father.This raw, depressing drama earns its R rating by providing in-your-face depictions of violence, nudity, survival, desperation, fear, and isolation.  There's obviously some masterful storytelling and moving performances in ""Babel,"" but overall, it's not extremely enjoyable to watch.Leslie Halpern, author ofReel Romance: The Lovers' Guide to the 100 Best Date MoviesandDreams on Film: The Cinematic Struggle Between Art and Science.",4,Characters With Communication Problems,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,2537,"['Babel', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'co-producer', 'Steve', 'Golin', 'Jon', 'Kilik', 'story', 'desolate', 'region', 'Moroccan', 'desert', 'where', 'two', 'brainless', 'boys', 'decide', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'new', 'rifle', 'can', 'fire', 'using', 'tour', 'bus', 'full', 'people', 'target', 'practice', 'One', 'bullet', 'critically', 'American', 'woman', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'husband', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'recovering', 'death', 'infant', 'new', 'tragedy', 'series', 'earlier', 'tragedies', 'including', 'suicide', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'series', 'tragedies', 'including', 'deportation', 'couple', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'nanny', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', '.With', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'action', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'place', 'place', 'Morocco', 'Japan', 'America', 'Mexico', 'one', 'story', 'exhausting', 'film', 'follow', 'one', 'story', 'two', 'Moroccan', 'boys', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'try', 'escape', 'justice', 'related', 'separate', 'story', 'American', 'couple', 'portrayed', 'great', 'sincerity', 'passion', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'struggle', 'life-or-death', 'situation', 'aided', 'incompetent', 'sympathetic', 'locals', 'nearby', 'village', 'Meanwhile', 'California', 'couple', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'loving', 'Mexican', 'nanny', 'who', 'foolishly', 'children', 'nephew', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'wild', 'wedding', 'party', 'border', 'yet', 'story', 'most', 'tenuous', 'thematic', 'threads', 'link', 'teenaged', 'deaf-mute', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'city', 'panties', 'trying', 'lose', 'virginity.Each', 'story', 'reveals', 'characters', 'communication', 'problems', 'American', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'baby', 'death', 'husband', 'earlier', 'desertion', 'boys', 'have', 'never', 'told', 'parents', 'sister', 'incestuous', 'peep', 'shows', 'nanny', 'not', 'only', 'ignorant', 'English', 'language', 'American', 'laws', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'who', 'having', 'difficulty', 'communicating', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'deaf', 'strange', 'strained', 'relationship', 'father.This', 'raw', 'depressing', 'drama', 'R', 'rating', 'providing', 'in-your-face', 'depictions', 'violence', 'nudity', 'survival', 'desperation', 'fear', 'isolation', 'obviously', 'masterful', 'storytelling', 'moving', 'performances', 'Babel', 'overall', 'not', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Leslie', 'Halpern', 'author', 'ofReel', 'Romance', 'Lovers', 'Guide', '100', 'Best', 'Date', 'MoviesandDreams', 'Film', 'Cinematic', 'Struggle', 'Between', 'Art', 'Science']",N/A
1044661,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000MCH5P4,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 7]","Babel's impact resonates long after the film is over.  Scenes flash through my mind.  I'm disturbed and unsettled.  And I'm convinced that this film is a very special kind of art form.It's an ambitious undertaking.  There are four parallel stories and several languages including the sign language of a deaf mute young woman.  Cultures clash.  Misunderstandings happen.  It's just like the real world - only more up close and ""in your face"".  And, like the real world, the conclusion is not tidy and only leads to more questions.Bravo to the director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu for his skill in making these seemingly separate pieces all come together as one unified whole.  And bravo to the to actors who were nominated for Academy Awards for their supporting roles --  Adriana Barraza, cast as a Mexican caretaker of two American children and Rinko Kikuchi, cast as a young deaf mute Japanese schoolgirl.  Yes, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchard did bring the star power to this film, and they were indeed excellent as the American tourist couple who are stranded in a small Moroccan village after a stray bullet hits their tour bus and the wife is seriously wounded.No, it wasn't terrorists, although the media immediately picks up on the story.  The bullet came from the gun of a young Moroccan goatherd who was trying to see how far his gun could shoot.  We get to see the confusion created by this incident and the over-reactions of the Moroccan police.  There are other police actions that made me shudder as well, as mistakes add up and a car driven by the Mexican woman's nephew is detained by the U.S. Boarder Patrol.Another police incident concerns a young  Japanese police officer who the deaf mute young woman tries to seduce.  All this seems complex, but that is the point of the film.  Life is complex and disturbing and an action by one person can impact many others on the other side of the world.I highly recommend this film, but it's certainly not light entertainment.

Languages, cultures, classes, and countries weave into a fabric of common connections.A rifle is the center of the film.  It becomes part of a local goat herdsman's property in Morocco.  He has two young sons (Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid) who take care of the goats but also play with the rifle.  During target practice with rocks one son inadvertently takes a shot at a tour bus.  Both sons see the bus stop and realize something is wrong.  They run back to their home and hide the gun as they realize what trouble they started.Traveling in the tour bus in the back roads of Morocco are Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett).  They are a wealthy young couple who have just lost a child.  Their other two children are at home in San Diego with their illegal Mexican housekeeper and nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza).  Susan has been irritable and upset most of the trip. After a meal she does not enjoy they get on the tour bus and start down the winding back roads of Morocco.  Susan leans against the window and the gunshot comes through hitting her in the shoulder near the neck.  Richard and the Tour Bus passengers panic and try to find hospital or help near by as Susan is bleeding and in much pain.  Finally they find a small town nearby, but still need competent medical care.Richard calls home to tell Amelia she needs to stay with the children longer than expected.  Amelia is upset as she was planning on attending her son's wedding in Mexico.  She makes a decision to go anyway and take Richard and Susan's children with her.  They have great fun at the wedding and Amelia's son does not want her to leave Mexico.  She says she has to return with the children - and her nephew drives them back.  Immigration officials cause a problem and near disaster in the desert when trying to come back to the United States.Then the film zips to Tokyo and a rich widower (Koji Yakusho) who is tied to the rifle that shot Susan. He worries and is torn about his deaf daughter (Kinko Kikuchi). She is angry she has no hearing and no mother.  Her anger at a sports game upsets him.  He seems to talk to her about her attitude (There are no subtitles). She is upset when boys back away from her when they realize she cannot hear.  She wants to be loved and have a life of fun and boyfriends like other young girls.  She is bold, promiscuous, determined and angry.  Her actions are both shocking and sad.This is a very intimate peek into each life.  It is deeply, darkly emotional and yet very thoughtful on the love of families as well as cultural misunderstandings.  We see humanities connectedness and how we all make mistakes whether rich or poor.

When the boys decide too try it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman in the middle of nowhere. The bus driver convinces them that it would be best to go to his small village which is nearby with the claim the village has a doctor. Unable to be transported any further, the woman and her husband are dropped off in this very remote village, to await help. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt is her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress.This shooting triggers off events in other people's lives across the world.

1044677,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000MCH5P4,Marc Cabir Davis,"[7, 15]","Wow.What can one say about ""Babel"", the sort of preposterous big-budget 'world' cinema that Hollywood insists on making these days (wasn't the pathetic ""Crash"" enough for them?).Perhaps the worst thing about this misguided enterprise is that it stars the newly `world-conscious' Mr. Pitt as the headline star. Please watch this film. What exactly does Brad Pitt do here except simper and mope like a little girl? This is `acting'? Which joke of a professional reviewer dared call this Brads' `best performance'? I was thoroughly displayed by the disgusting display of Brad Pitts' `acting skills' here, and the directors lovingly focused on his `tortured emotions' as he came to terms with his wife's shooting. I mean, if one thing sinks `Babel', its Pitt. Its not like I hate him or anything (`Interview with the Vampire' was stupendous) but what he does here is criminal - as he takes centerstage in a film he first of all has no business being in.The story is about many parallel lives on various continents all interconnecting in the end to make you go `Aha! I never saw THAT coming!', but you dear viewer, deserve far better than the supposed `goodies' this film has to offer. Maybe I should just write this entire review in `air quotes'. Seriously. Let me count the storylines. This will be good:1. Brad and Cate : Two people in Morocco vacationing to save their obviously dead-in-the-ground marriage (and considering Pitts' face here, its no wonder she doesn't want anything to do with him). They're in a bus, she gets shot, and the rest of the movie follows Brads' attempts to find help for her in a rural area and to prevent her death. Oh boo hoo hoo.2. Brad and Cate's children & their Nanny : Back in the US, their children's nanny comes up with this amazing idea to take the kids across the border for her daughters' wedding (which is probably the most boring Hispanic wedding I've ever seen - they are far more vibrant than this one, in real life). Gael Garcia Bernal (who gives his role far more depth than this film deserved) plays the guy who takes them across the border. On the way back, La Americano Immigrationo stops them and the kids and nanny are lost in the desert, also at deaths' door.3. In Japan, an obviously sexually deprived teenager looks for love in all the wrong places because of some sordid back-story involving her mothers' suicide. We are supposed to `feel her pain', but the only thing I felt was how low this character would stoop to get some action. I mean, really. The Japanese actress was fine, but anyone could have sleepwalked through this excuse of a role. There is the sub-story of a Japanese police officer, but this storyline is too inconsequential to detail here. Pass.4. The Moroccan Kids : Two Moroccan kids get a hold of a rifle and they're the ones that shot Cate from a distance. One kid ends up dying and the other realizes the errors of his ways. Oh wow. I am on my knees praying to the Lord already. What a message!And heres the shocker. All these stories converge into one point at the end. Just like Manoj Shyamalan's surprise endings of late (and you know what I mean), the shock here is that the gun the kids shot Cate with, used to belong to the Japanese girls' father!! Oh my!! Isn't that exciting!!Not.Which is exactly why this ludicrous waste of film does not get my vote. I have had it with films that set you up for a payoff and then suddenly the end credits roll. As a student of world cinema, I find this to be very `Hollywood' in the worst sort of way. Its no wonder this was shut out at the Oscars because even though it has some pretty music and cinematography, it has NO soul. And that is so evident.The worst part of the film was a ten minute long sequence where the Japanese girl meets some boys, takes some `pills', gets drunk, saunters into a nightclub, and then leaves. Seriously. Ten Minutes of this non-stop nonsense parading as `serious art'. Oh yeah, shes deaf and dumb too, but that doesn't stop her does it? Oh no! At the end of the film, the movie hints at the girls' suicide attempt, but we are not even given this visual delight. Instead the film ends with a numbing visual of the girl, naked, hugging her father on her terrace. Dubious to say the least, and nothing was resolved.If you love this movie, I'm sorry. You're probably in the majority. However, I did not like this. It was a waste of time, and took my intelligence for granted. I hear the word `masterpiece' being thrown around, and that is definitely not true. This is a C Grade movie dressed up in an A+ costume. To me, the only worthy thing about this was Gael Garcia Bernal who is good in literally everything he is in. Watch it for him, if you must, but take my advice and skip this. There are so many great movies about cultural integration around us - lets not forget that this film focuses on the travails of a WHITE family and that the entire story revolves around them. Whatever `world unity' they wanted to portray was lost a long time ago.Two Stars.

Or, you could look at it as an example of the ""Butterfly Effect"". However you do it, this is a good film!It is an example (to me) of how one mindless act, reverberates around the world, and affects so many people. There are the most tenuous of threads connecting these people to one another. It is also the decisions they make in the wake of this act, that fuels the story.We first meet an American couple, vacationing in Morocco (?). As their bus begins climbing a small grade, the wife is shot. the wound is not serious, but in this part of the world, medical help is somewhat hard to come by, and that fact makes it serious. Meanwhile, in San Diego, California, a nanny/housekeeper is trying to make arrangements to go to a wedding, south of the border. Unfortunately, no one seems willing to relieve her of her two charges, a boy and a girl, who belong to the vacationing couple. Next we see a young, and somewhat bitter Japanese girl who is deaf, playing volleyball. She is somewhat estranged from her father, resulting from her Mother's death. Last, but by no means the least, are a family in Morocco, whose Father/Husband has recently purchased a rifle for a handful of cash and a goat, from a man who was gifted the rifle by a Japanese hunter.It is from here that things begins in earnest, and we are witness to a series of bad judgements that fuel the tale. This could be any of us. How would YOU fare?This film boasts some of the best actors of our time, Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal.

1044681,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000MCH5P4,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","On a desolate Moroccan mountainside impoverished young brothers Ahmed and Yussef are testing out their exciting new manly acquisition - a Winchester M70 Rifle their father bought from a local guide Hassan for 500 Dirhams and a goat. They start out innocently enough (pot shots at Jackals) but sibling rivalry kicks in as they test Hassan's claims that the gun is so good - the bullets can travel up to 3 kilometres. Yussef (the younger of the two) is the better marksman - so in jest he takes aims at a long tourist bus trundling up a dirt road far below. They laugh as nothing seemingly happens. But then the bus pulls in - screaming voices inside - they're English-speaking tourists. Ahmed and Yussef look at each other and run.Mr. Wataya proudly watches his deaf Japanese teenage daughter Chieko play fiercely competitive Volleyball with other mutes in a privileged Tokyo school gym (fabulous turns by Koji Yakusho of the original ""Shall We Dance"" and Rinko Kikuchi of ""Pacific Rim""). Chieko is beautiful but is mentally tortured by the suicide of her mother only a year earlier and a subsequently difficult relationship with her father. But more obsessive than that is her burgeoning sexuality that no cool J-POP Japanese boy seems to want because of her language disability. She begins to go extreme lengths to get attention in shopping malls and even with her dentist as she lays prostate on his chair...Amelia is a big-hearted middle-aged Mexican nanny (a stunning Adrianna Barraza) taking good care of two beautiful white children is Los Angeles while their warring parents Richard and Susan Jones (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are holidaying in Morocco. But Amelia gets a phone call from Richard that his wife Susan has been shot and they're holed up in a small town called Tazarine waiting for an American helicopter to get them out. Amelia will therefore have to cancel going to her son's wedding that day in Mexico to look after the kids. But Amelia figures it will be ok (what can go wrong) and takes the young Debbie and Mike (Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble) and her son Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal) across the border in his beat-up car. But things go badly wrong. And on it goes to a honourable Japanese cop who works out where the Rifle originated...Employing the same creative team he worked with on the equally compelling  ""Amores Perros"" (2000) and ""21 Grams"" (2004) (see review) - Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu once again uses the disjointed different-people different-places storytelling of Guillermo Arriaga (Writer) and the hugely emotive Music of Gustavo Santaolalla to make the stunning ""Babel"" (2006). But this is an even more accomplished round-the-world parable that the two that went before.Ok - the idea that unbeknown to them two Moroccan children could set in motion a chain of events that will affect people in Tokyo, Mexico and the USA is perhaps stretching credibility a tad - but Inarritu wants us to see that we are all connected and that 'pain is universal' whether you're rich or poor. He also clearly believes that kindness and faith are not merely rationed to the West. In fact people with nothing show more grace than panicking affluent tourists greedy for their own safety do - while one of their own lies bleeding to death in a dust hovel with a bullet in her neck.But what gives ""Babel"" its extraordinary humanity and personal punch are the faces you don't recognize and the worlds you're allowed to peer in on - often not sexy nor glamorous - but full of family and heart nonetheless. There is an old lady who stays with Cate Blanchett's Susan as she writhes in pain - her wizened sunken-sockets life-long-struggle face is incredible. Mohamed Akhzam as the desperate father trying to keep his kids from being killed by trigger-happy police as the 'American Killed By Terrorists' storyline filling the news gets out of hand. The speech-challenged teenage girls in Tokyo who just want to be cool and liked but get hurt by the cruelty of giggling boys in Games Arcades. Its amazing around-the-world stuff...After the grain-filled gritty realism of ""21 Grams"" on the new format - it's fabulous to see that ""Babel"" is a proper looker on BLU RAY and a quantum leap ahead in terms of visuals. Defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect  - it fills the full screen and the effect is powerful. Dust, dirt and goatherds on the one hand with the neon blitz of downtown Tokyo on the other - all looking fabulous. The Audio is in both English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital with Subtitles in English, English for the Hard Of Hearing, French and Spanish. But apart from a Theatrical Trailer and some Previews - a huge disappointment is the complete lack of Extras when this film so cried out for them.""Babel"" broke down doors in terms of showing us the world in all its complex but similar humanity - and while it may not all tie up perfectly at the end (like life) - it was hailed in certain circles as 'a genuine masterpiece'.I for one would agree

God, observing these many people united in the contruction, sought to destroy the tower and scatter the humans to the farthest reaches of the globe and confussing the languages, never again to be able to build the tower. in Babel which derives it name from the tower, the lives of many intersect with just a single action that affect all the people in more then one ways. a follow up to his 2003 flick, 21 Grams, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu delivers a searing drama that can definintly be called this years Crash (though a heck of a lot better) using the premise of the biblical story, we see four interwoven stories that all are somehow connected to a single event. two kids playing with a gun suddenly gets find themselves in a very nasty situation. a husband and wife (Pitt and Blanchett) vacationing in Morroco suddenly find themselves in a perilous dilhema when they find themselves in a perilous flight of life and death. a nanny (Barraza) left in care of her employers children decides to take them to her sons wedding which leads to tragic events. a deaf Japanese girl (Kikuchi), angry at the world for her disability, seeks a way to rebel against her father and all those who have what she does not. it is then with a single gun fire that all these people connect with one another and how it all acumilates in an ending that will be happy for some, tragic for others. the true driving force of the film is the performences. Pitt brings his best performence since 12 Monkeys and it surprises me that he didn't get nominated. Barraza is supremly moving as the loving nanny but i feel the standout of the film is Rinko Kikuchi's fierce turn as the deaf teen Chieko. everytime she is on screen, she blares like a silent siren with such raw force and power that her performence joins the likes of other great none speakign roles like Marlee Matlin and Holly Hunter. the music also brings some depth to the film, Santaoalalla really blends in the music to make it all seem more real. my favorite scene is the very end (spoiler alert) when Chieko and her father hug on the balconey, it really got to me that scene. a truley epic film, Babel is definently one of 2006 most outstanding films.",5,one bullet can effect everyone,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2309,"['bible', 'said', 'united', 'group', 'humans', 'took', 'up', 'task', 'build', 'great', 'tower', 'reach', 'heavens', 'God', 'observing', 'many', 'people', 'united', 'contruction', 'sought', 'destroy', 'tower', 'scatter', 'humans', 'farthest', 'reaches', 'globe', 'confussing', 'languages', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'able', 'build', 'tower', 'Babel', 'name', 'tower', 'lives', 'many', 'intersect', 'just', 'single', 'action', 'affect', 'people', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'ways', 'follow', 'up', '2003', 'flick', '21', 'Grams', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'searing', 'drama', 'can', 'definintly', 'be', 'called', 'years', 'Crash', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'using', 'premise', 'biblical', 'story', 'see', 'four', 'interwoven', 'stories', 'are', 'somehow', 'connected', 'single', 'event', 'two', 'kids', 'playing', 'gun', 'suddenly', 'find', 'very', 'nasty', 'situation', 'husband', 'wife', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'vacationing', 'Morroco', 'suddenly', 'find', 'perilous', 'dilhema', 'when', 'find', 'perilous', 'flight', 'life', 'death', 'nanny', 'Barraza', 'left', 'care', 'employers', 'children', 'take', 'sons', 'wedding', 'tragic', 'events', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Kikuchi', 'angry', 'world', 'disability', 'way', 'rebel', 'father', 'who', 'have', 'what', 'not', 'then', 'single', 'gun', 'fire', 'people', 'connect', 'one', 'how', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'tragic', 'others', 'true', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'performences', 'Pitt', 'best', 'performence', '12', 'Monkeys', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'Barraza', 'supremly', 'moving', 'loving', 'nanny', 'i', 'feel', 'standout', 'film', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'fierce', 'turn', 'deaf', 'teen', 'Chieko', 'everytime', 'screen', 'silent', 'siren', 'such', 'raw', 'force', 'power', 'performence', 'likes', 'other', 'great', 'none', 'speakign', 'roles', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'music', 'also', 'depth', 'film', 'Santaoalalla', 'really', 'music', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'favorite', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'when', 'Chieko', 'father', 'hug', 'balconey', 'really', 'got', 'scene', 'truley', 'epic', 'film', 'Babel', 'definently', 'one', '2006', 'most', 'outstanding', 'films']",N/A

Galindo,"[19, 28]","I knew little of what to expect from this movie, so I wasn't terribly surprised to discover that, in reality, it really is nothing more than an international version of ""Crash."" The movie revolves around four stories, all but one with an immediate link to each other, and the same heavy-handed, manipulative story-telling that last year's Academy Award winner gave us. This movie will work for some - most, maybe - but if one doesn't swallow the typical Holllywood line and can think for themselves, they will probably see through the thin veneer of this film very quickly.Put simply, this film just doesn't make sense logically. Yes, the premise is that through various cultures and languages and mistakes and the fact that people don't listen as much as they talk they often find themselves in precarious situations. Okay, that was beaten into the audience, ad nauseum.Yet, the film isn't tight, there are too many moronic moments and too many times when one might find themselves saying, ""Yeah, but who would DO that?!?"" If a couple is having marital difficulties would a man seriously book him and his wife with a tour to a third world country like Morocco? Over a tropical island or a European destination? And would a wife who is so eager NOT to go still get on a plane willingly? Huh? Would two boys who know that a gun can kill/injure a jackel then shoot at a moving vehicle and NOT realize they might injure some one inside? Really.... And would a couple really truly go halfway around the world - leaving the country - and leave their two children in the care of some one not related, in the country illegally, and not leave her with any emergency contact numbers or the names of anyone close by? (like, in the same city, maybe?) Sure about that? And are these people so hermitlike that if they do need to have some one other than the nanny take care of their kids there are no neighbors, no friends, no colleagues they know or trust? Does anyone really live like this? These are just some of the ""suspensions of belief"" this movie is asking viewers to make. Unbelievable.There is a segment that takes place in Japan that at first seems out of place and never really connects fully to the movie. In fact, it was like watching two movies, which was rather bizarre in some way. And I think I liked that other, Japanese movie better, but the director left so much of it unfinished. A shame, really. Perhaps he should have dumped this Babel stuff, picked up the remnants of the Japanese story, fleshed that story out, and made a whole new movie. Now THAT would have been something to see! Infinitely more enjoyable!This movie was okay.

God strikes the plan down by confusing/creating different languages so that the builders cannot understand each other thereby suspending communication. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, along with his screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's take on this material is ""Babel"" their third and most ambitiously produced film with locales in Morocco, Japan, San Diego and Mexico and like the Bible story, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is once again dealing with communication or lack thereof: how we talk and either no one listens or more to the point...doesn't understand. Simple themes told exceedingly well here.In the best sequence, shot in Japan a deaf mute girl, Chieko (Rinko Cucuchi), desperate for attention and contact other than she can get from her pals, tells (actually signs) to her father (a sad sack Koji Yakusho from ""Shall We Dance?""): ""You Never Listen to Me!"" Ironic on at least a couple of levels. Chieko is reeling from the normal drama of being a teen as well as the not so normal drama of having found her Mother dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She is also dealing with a father who is also devastated and unable to comfort himself much less his daughter. They live in a glacial glass high-rise box in Tokyo: a symbol of the icy coldness of the lives that they live within.The two other parts of the film deal with the stars (a very good Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) in Morocco on vacation (!?) and a supposed terrorist attack and the third, a very real and scary sequence involving the Pitt/Blanchett children and their caretaker, Amelia (a terrific Adriana Barraza) and their harrowing journey into Baja California.Every one of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's films (""Amores Perros,"" ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"") contain at least one gut-wrenching, emotional and transcendentally beautiful scene: the dog fight in ""Amores Perros,"" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in ""21 Grams"" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide-eyed, wide-eyed, mouth agape...experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.Though I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga stretch the ""if a butterfly flutters its wings in Hawaii, etc."" metaphor to the breaking point, there is no doubt that""Babel"" has got the goods where it counts: deep in the recesses of its soul and heart.",4,Butterfly Wings,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2679,"['Chapter', '11', 'Genesis', 'story', 'mankind', 'attempt', 'reach', 'heaven', 'building', 'tower', 'not', 'way', 'glorify', 'God', 'way', 'mankind', 'glorify', 'putting', 'God', 'level', 'God', 'plan', 'down', 'confusing/creating', 'different', 'languages', 'so', 'builders', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'other', 'thereby', 'suspending', 'communication', 'Director', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'screenwriter', 'Guillermo', 'Arriaga', 'take', 'material', 'Babel', 'third', 'most', 'ambitiously', 'produced', 'film', 'locales', 'Morocco', 'Japan', 'San', 'Diego', 'Mexico', 'Bible', 'story', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'once', 'again', 'dealing', 'communication', 'lack', 'thereof', 'how', 'talk', 'either', 'one', 'more', 'point', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Simple', 'themes', 'told', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'here.In', 'best', 'sequence', 'shot', 'Japan', 'deaf', 'mute', 'girl', 'Chieko', 'Rinko', 'Cucuchi', 'desperate', 'attention', 'contact', 'other', 'can', 'get', 'pals', 'tells', 'actually', 'signs', 'father', 'sad', 'sack', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'Never', 'Listen', 'Me', 'least', 'couple', 'levels', 'Chieko', 'reeling', 'normal', 'drama', 'being', 'teen', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'normal', 'drama', 'having', 'found', 'Mother', 'dead', 'self-inflicted', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'also', 'dealing', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'devastated', 'unable', 'comfort', 'much', 'less', 'daughter', 'live', 'glacial', 'glass', 'high-rise', 'box', 'Tokyo', 'symbol', 'icy', 'coldness', 'lives', 'live', 'within.The', 'two', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'deal', 'stars', 'very', 'good', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Morocco', 'vacation', 'supposed', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'third', 'very', 'real', 'scary', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Pitt/Blanchett', 'children', 'caretaker', 'Amelia', 'terrific', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'Baja', 'California.Every', 'one', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'films', 'Amores', 'Perros', '21', 'Grams', 'Babel', 'contain', 'least', 'one', 'gut-wrenching', 'emotional', 'transcendentally', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'dog', 'fight', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'scene', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'how', 'lose', 'family', 'random', 'accident', '21', 'Grams', 'here', 'Babel', 'Chieko', 'Shinto', 'dance', 'club', 'soundtrack', 'stopping', 'starting', 'approximate', 'Chieko', 'experience', 'Chieko', 'wide-eyed', 'wide-eyed', 'mouth', 'agape', 'experiencing', 'world', 'feeling', 'touching', 'paramount', 'hearing', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Arriaga', 'stretch', 'butterfly', 'wings', 'Hawaii', 'etc', 'metaphor', 'breaking', 'point', 'doubt', 'Babel', 'got', 'goods', 'where', 'deep', 'recesses', 'soul', 'heart']",N/A
1044689,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B000MCH5P4,Michael A. Newman,"[5, 7]","With direction similar to Crash, this movie focused on the plight of three different sets of kids. Two young kids are staying with their Mexican housekeeper while their parents are traveling in Morocco.  Their mother gets shot which prevents the parents from returning.  The housekeeper meanwhile needs to attend her son's wedding across the boarder in Mexico.  With nobody else to care for the kids and not wanting to miss the wedding, she takes the kids with her and her ""shady"" nephew to Mexico for the wedding.  Of course something will go wrong in their trip, brought about by the nephew.The second set of kids are two young boys in Morocco who play with a high powered rifle and accidentally shoot the first kids' mother and then try to cover up what they did before they are caught.  The shot mother is tottering between life and death because she was shot very far from the nearest hospital and her shooting is thought to be terrorist related, causing a whole international incident that prevents the US embassy from sending help to her.The third kid is a deaf/mute teenager in Tokyo whose father was the owner of the rifle used in the Morocco shooting.  She is very troubled, apparently related to the recent death of her mother (the police had questioned her about her father's possible involvement in the death) and hangs out with a bad crowd who are into drugs.  Also, she appears very promiscuous because she exposes herself to two of the boys and later to a police detective.The director jumps back and forth from story to story, always at key parts that leave you eager to find out what was going to happen next.  It is a very successful formula here and one can understand all the positive critical reviews that this movie has received.  I felt it actually better than Crash which was last year's best picture.

If everyone is talking then nobody is listening. If nobody listens, then there is no communication. So, in BABEL the movie, we have a set of three tenuously linked stories about communication or the lack thereof. One character is even a Japanese deaf mute teenage girl. (How is that for artistic symbolism?) Two other characters are an American husband (Brad Pitt) and wife (Kate Blanchard) who are on a trip in Morocco and not talking to each other. A Moroccan peasant father cannot seem to communicate with his sons and daughter. In the United States, the American couple's Hispanic nanny can't seem to communicate with her impulsive young relative. Another theme is the evil of guns, in this case a hunting rifle and the consequences its criminally improper use creates. A second gun incident is tragically involved in the story of the deaf mute. So we get the feeling this film has anti-gun propaganda aspects to it which is not surprising from Hollywood liberal film makers. That said, BABEL is an entertaining if starkly realistic and gritty film with fine acting turns by all involved. Rinko Kikuchi is excellent as the Japanese girl and stole the film in my opinion. I don't know if BABEL is brilliantly conceived or even superbly directed; the division into three barely connected stories feels disjointed.

She brings the children across the border into Mexico to attend her son's wedding, and problems arise when they attempt to re-enter America.  In Japan, deaf-mute Chieko (Kikuchi) is trying to connect with someone, anyone.  All the stories are related, and all come together smoothly in this tale of small mistakes and lapses in judgment, and the consequences that they cause.Like ""21 Grams"" before it, in ""Babel"" director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu masterfully entwines multiple stories into a compelling film.  Packed with solid performances all around.  Bernal and Kikuchi in particular are standouts, and their Academy Award nominations are fully warranted.

There is the old saying that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Unfortunately, this film parts is greater than the whole.  Each story is interesting but when combined together they lose their individual punch.The main story is about a boy who does something very stupid that sets up a series of events that changes everyone's life.  In a middle eastern country a shepard buys a hunting rifle to protect his flock from jackals.  He sends his two boys to tend the flock.  He gives the rifle to the oldest son.  After the missing a jackal, the boys blame the rifle.  The gun was suppose to have a range of about 2 miles.  The boys take the rifle to a ridge.  The older boy aims at a passing car that is at the bottom of the ridge (I assume that it's about a mile away.) and misses it.  The younger boy takes the rifle and shoots at a passing bus.  It appears that he also missed but then the bus suddenly stops.  The boys are overjoyed that they hit the bus.  But soon that joy is overshadowed by the fact that it turns out that an American tourist has been shot.This storyline spirals out of control on two fronts.  The local government reacting to the finding the shooter and the treating of the wounded woman.  The first part is more interesting than the second.  Although, Brad Pitts performance as the shooting victim's husband is brilliant and Oscar worthy (but as a Supporting Actor, as this film really has no leads.)If developed further, this would have made a fine film on it's own.The second story involves a Mexican housekeeper trying to attend her son's wedding in Mexico.  But the problem her employers are out of town and she is responsible for the two children.  When she can not get anyone to take care of the children, she takes them with her.  The problem occurs when they try to return to the US.  This story is connected to the main story by the children belonging to the woman who was shot.  But there are too many problems with this storyline to enumerate.The third story is about a deaf Japanese girl whose mother commited suicide and she is having trouble coping with life.  So she decides to act out sexually.  First ""flashing"" some boys at a restaurant and finally trying to seduce a police detective.  This story is very flimsily tied to the main by the rifle used to shoot the tourist was owned by the girl's father.The film takes place over five days and this also created a credibility issue with the first two stories.  This is a film that wants to tackle too many issues on how the establishment oppresses poor.  But when you look at the main conflicts, the characters did very irresposible deeds that lead to their demise.The only reason to see this film is Brad Pitt's ""Best Film Performance.""

1044697,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B000MCH5P4,moviemusicbuff,"[10, 13]","This is an excellent film made and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.  In ""Crash""-like fashion, the movie interweaves the lives of 4 different families which are affected/involved in an incident involving the shooting of an American tourist Susan (played by Cate Blanchett) who is accompanied by her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) while on vacation in Morocco.  The other 3 families involve the boys in Morocco who did the shooting involving a Winchester rifle that was given as a gift to their father, the nanny (an outstanding Oscar nominated performance by Adriana Barraza) of Susan & Richard's two children who makes a fateful decision to bring the children to her son's wedding in Mexico, and the Japanese girl Chieko (played by Rinko Kikuchi in another outstanding performance) and her father, who was the one who gave the rifle away as a gift.Other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the story, so I won't repeat that here.  I want to comment on the subtle social commentary that is inherent in this film which I found very intriguing.1) The discrepancy on the value of human life of the American tourist Susan versus the way the lives of the Moroccan family are viewed.  So much attention was paid to the treatment of the American tourist even by the onlooking Moroccan villagers while the local authorities harshly treat the parents of the two boys involved in the shooting. So, if Moroccan villagers happen to get killed, would it be a big deal at all or would it be a bigger deal that an American tourist was being shot at?  Was the director trying to comment on the disparity of how human value and worth are viewed across different cultures?  This disparity of the view of human value and worth is definitely a consequence of the ""Babel"" story in Genesis 11.2) The snow-balling effects of a bad decisionThe Japanese businessman decides to give the Winchester rifle to his local guide, who happens to be the father of the two Moroccan boys who did the shooting;  Richard (Brad Pitt) decides to take his wife Susan (Cate Blanchett) to a vacation(!) in Morocco; the Moroccan boys decide to shoot at the American tourist bus instead of jackals;  the nanny does not know what to do with taking care of the two children so she brings them with her to her son's wedding in Mexico.  Each of these decisions have very dramatic and significant consequences, as you'll see.Another effect of ""Babel"" in Gen. 11 is confusion.  There is a lot of confused thinking which leads to dramatic consequences.3) The effect of trauma upon childrenEach of the families involved will face a traumatic event which involves the children.The confusion of Gen. 11 affects future generations, hence the effect of trauma upon children : we see the distorted thinking of the Moroccan boy who is responsible for the shooting (he might actually grow up to be a terrorist for all we know), and the confused sense of reality exhibited by the Japanese girl Chieko.4) The unifying factor of loveThis movie speaks of the way all the confusion and division of Babel can be healed and reversed.  The confusion & division in the biblical story is due to the selfish, self-glorifying actions of the participants involved, which leads to the confusion of languages and scattering of families.  Sure, there are communication breakdowns in this movie which happen across cultures.  However, the one unifying factor that we see in this movie is genuine love and understanding.  Genuine love and understanding care speaks a common language that is understood beyond all cultures and ethnicities.  (SPOILER ALERT: the following statements may reveal significant story/plot points in the film:)a) The caring hospitality of the Moroccan tour guide in the bus (and his relatives) helps to heal the situation involving the American tourists.b) The caring understanding of one of the Japanese detectives makes a very big difference upon the Japanese girl ChiekoThe love and care of these individuals are the bright spots in this movie, which otherwise is filled with sadness and tragedy.I believe the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is trying to emphasize that the hope of redeeming and healing racism, social inequality, and family trauma is the outpouring of genuine love and understanding.I give a big thumbs up to the great acting in this movie:  Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adriana Barraza, and Rinko Kikuchi all give outstanding performances.  Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a very substantial drama with biting social commentary.The only big drawback of this DVD is the total lack of special features.  Why isn't there any featurettes which interview the cast/director/crew and give a behind-the-scenes look at the film?I deleted one star due to the poor DVD features.  Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie a lot.(Also, a cautionary note to viewers who might be sensitive to this:  there is a lot of nudity in this film, esp. involving scenes with the Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi)",4,Harrowing adult drama -- great acting but poor DVD features,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,4989,"['excellent', 'film', 'made', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'Crash',

All because it's a ""foreign"" movie. That's the advantage of making a movie with this kind of tone to it: at worst, the reception by the public will be maybe just slightly above average, and at best, be received exactly how this movie was: as a great movie. The truth is this was a long boring waste of time.This is one of those movies where you could miss 5 minutes of it here and there, and it would have absolutely no bearing on anything. I thought in movies, every piece of dialogue, every frame of every scene *counted, and was shot a certain way for a reason? This is like the opposite ofBack to the Future. This was unnecessarily long because they spent so much of the time showing characters doing trivial things that didn't advance the overall plot.When they cut between the 4 separate story lines going on, taken by themselves they are pretty good scenes that are well acted and leads to those characters' individual story arcs. But you don't just cut together 4 separate stories like that without some central plot to tie it in and expect to get a good movie. And no, the damn rifle doesn't count. Don't even try to act like that minimal amount of relevance some of the characters had to each other amounts to anything, because it doesn't.At about the halfway point of the movie I was sitting there wondering what the hell was the point of all this, and didn't really understand where they were going with this. As the minutes ticked by beyond the halfway mark, I slowly came to the sad realization that I had in fact wasted my time on yet another over-hyped movie (up until then I assumed it would get better, silly of me).You don't make a movie like this.

Unlike ""Crash"", which focused on the cultures crashing against one another and resolving in an ""uh-huh"" moment of epiphany once the different stories have colided as well, ""Babel"" is more interested in the personal path of these people, as they represent their culture.

This movie doesn't have a purpose or a final resolution, which may irritate some audiences, but that is not the point - it is a movie made for its own sake, creating art that doesn't need to be justified.

To me, the movie is evaluating about barrier, be it tangible & intangible. For Japanese segment of ""Babel"", there's a barrier between father & daughter. The daughter is deaf-mute & communication is compromised somewhat. However, the father is overcome with a sense of helplessness for not doing enough to save his wife &  perhaps his daughter, whilst the daughter is rebelling AGAINST the father because she's angry that he's becoming the way that he is. Then, the daughter herself is having problem assimmilating to society due to her apparent physical handicap. In this instance, there are already physical, emotional, language barriers to address.  For American segment, we have the young couples who goes to Morroco for time-out & it's apparent that all isn't well with their relationship. As the movie progresses, it would divulge of the reason that causes an emotional barrier to be built up between them. The tragedy that's to happen to Cate Blanchett's character would subsequently open the channel of communication which somehow enables reconciliation for them to move forward with their lives.  For Mexico's segment of the story, the babysitter of the American couple would take their children to Mexico for a wedding.  Then, everything go awry. This really brings to the fore the paranoia & the suspicion that we have towards somebody or something that we don't know of.  Humanity is eroded or degraded the moment we approach the immigration check-in and check-out points when immigration officers would dissect us without giving us benefit of a doubt & that our dignity & integrity aren't spared.  In this instance, race & borderlines are barriers that we are evaluating.  Last but not least, the Morroco segment about the two children who used the hunting gun carelessly.  There's possibly the questioning about the age barrier, of what we deem as suitable for someone to use something dangerous in a responsible manner.  The beauty of this movie is that towards the end, everyone is linked directly & indirectly.  ""Babel"" is an intelligent movie that raises questions about barriers & applaud it for its capacity to have us evaluating upon the topic even when the final credit rolls.

It probably would have actually improved the flow of the film. I did find the stories of the deaf Japanese girl and the two little Morroccan kids to be very touching but even in some parts of that I found myself asking out loud, ""what the hell is going on?"" There were way too many instances of the viewer left waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never drops. And the part with the Mexican nanny who brings the kids to Mexico just plain irritated me. Now I'm sure some people will say that this is just nuance and I just didn't ""get it."" Yes, I get the part that the stories were all connected, yada, yada, yada, but I just felt like I was left hanging on too many aspects. For instance, why did the Japanese girl tell the cop that her mother jumped from the balcony? What did her note to the cop say? What happened to the two kids? Just little things like this where the viewer is left in the dark irritated me.That being said, the film was not a total loss.

As a motto for life, this struck me as dull - there's an implied passivity, and a churlish irresponsibility in this glib phrase.  Certainly, such a statement harbours no promise of a narrative.  Inarritu seems to have taken this slogan as the foundation for `Babel'.  He presents a series of misfortunes which befall his victims.  They suffer, but are in no position for wilfull action - and so they suffer passively, as do we, the audience.  This is not so much drama as simply waiting for things to be over.The characters feel thin, largely as we do not see them making any morally consequential decisions.  The main plot points are accidents, or acts inflicted upon the protagonists.  If the characters reveal themselves at all, it is on less crucial matters.  This lack of decisive action by the characters, and the related feeling that they are not responsible for what happens to them, makes for dull narrative.  As some critics have suggested, `Babel' borders on boring.  Given the exotic locations, big name actors, hyperactive editing, and overbearing score, it's quite something for this film to be boring, but boring it is, and I think the cause lies with the passivity of plot and character already mentioned.Others have summarized the strands of the film, but here is another take:  Cate Blanchett gets shot (accidentally), and we (along with Brad Pitt) wait to see if she receives competent medical attention; the shooting jeopardizes the lives of the young Moroccan perpetrators, and we wait to see if the law apprehends them; Brad and Cate's children first see Mexico, and then are imperilled by the unmotivated crazed actions of their chauffeur - we wait to see if they survive; a mute young Asian girl shows us her nascent sexual longings, and we wait to see if anything happens here at all.  There's a lot of waiting going on, but far fewer laughs than in a Samuel Beckett play.  It's all very earnest, but to very little end.A word of warning too if hand held camera work blown up on a big screen makes you physically nauseous - there's enough here to induce queasiness.  The editing is also intemittently frenetic, so much so that I felt like I was trapped inside a food processor.In place of character development Inarritu offers gore and brutality, petty conflict, and adolescent nudity and sexuality, often with spectacular mountain backdrops or slick cityscapes.  It's questionable what literally tearing a live chicken's head off adds to anyone's cinematic experience.  Indeed, I wonder if the same might be said about virtually everything in this film.

1044737,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000MCH5P4,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","****1/2In the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel, the human race, filled with the sins of arrogance and pride, builds an immense structure that will allow it to reach the heavens, and, in so doing, achieve equality with God.  Enraged by such presumption, a jealous Jehovah punishes the people by scattering them to the four corners of the earth and confusing their language.  It is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's contention, in his latest film, ""Babel,"" that we are still paying the price for that event all these thousands of years later.  For the point of this film is that, even in this technologically advanced age of instant, global communications, we are basically all still separated from one another by the barriers of race, religion, culture and, most especially, language.  Indeed, it is this last factor that seems to cause the most problems, for it results in serious miscommunication and misunderstandings, which in turn lead to immense personal suffering and human tragedy on both an individual and global scale.As he did in his previous films, ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams,"" Inarritu, working with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, has fashioned a multi-narrative work that pays little heed to the spatial and temporal rules of conventional storytelling, going back and forth in time and space, as it spins a tale set in three widely separated and distinctly different corners of the world.  The movie begins with the delivery of a rifle to a poor Islamic goat herder who is barely eking out an existence on a barren, windswept hillside in Morocco.  When one of the man's young sons uses the gun to shoot into a nearby bus filled with American tourists, the boy sets into motion a series of events that threatens to have immense personal and political repercussions for the individuals and nations involved.  The bullet strikes a woman (Cate Blanchett) who is touring the country with her husband (Brad Pitt).  Seriously wounded, she is taken to a nearby village where Pitt works frantically to get medical attention for her while an international crisis threatens to erupt over the incident.The second story involves the couple's young children back home in California, who are taken on an unauthorized trip to Mexico by their illegal-immigrant nanny desperate to attend her son's wedding.  The third tale, set in Tokyo, seems, at first, entirely unrelated to the others until the tenuous connection tying them altogether is finally established near the end of the film.  This one involves a deaf teenaged girl, embittered by both her handicap and the recent suicide of her mother, who begins to act out in ways that reveal her intense loneliness and willingness to do just about anything to fit in.The makers of ""Babel"" really challenge their audience by not going for obvious connections and by allowing the film to feel formless and disconnected for fairly long stretches of time.  I admit that I kept flashing in and out of the film for about the first two-thirds of its running time - at times feeling it was a work of genius, at others, feeling like it was not working at all - but, eventually, the movie won me over entirely as the meanings came more into focus and as each story moved inexorably towards its emotionally wrenching conclusion.  Much of the credit in this regard goes to the powerful musical score by Gustavo Santaollala, which starts off slowly then builds in intensity as the movie draws to a close.In each of these three stories, problems arise as a result of either an inability to communicate clearly or a stubborn refusal to say what needs to be said at a given crucial moment.  But the real power of the film lies not in its message but in the intensity of the individual moments it shows us, be it Blanchett's pain as she undergoes treatment for her wound; Pitt's desperation in getting his wife to a place of comfort and safety and his emotional breakdown while speaking on the phone to his young son; a wild ride through the desert Southwest as a young man madly attempts to outrun some border patrol officers in hot pursuit; a young girl's humiliating attempt to seduce a compassionate but clear-thinking older man; a poor father's moment of despair as he comes to realize how his son's actions have brought shame on the family.  The film is replete with many such moments.Inarritu has drawn riveting performances out of his large cast, primarily from Pitt, Blanchett, Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi.  Even though they aren't given the quantity of screen time they would have received in a conventional single-story film, these performers all make the most of the scenes they are in.It would be easy to dismiss ""Babel"" for being contrived, pretentious and self-important, for pretending to be more insightful and profound about the state of the world than, perhaps, it really is.  As such it would be an easy target.  Yet, ""Babel,"" for all its seeming ""significance,"" is surprisingly restrained in driving its message home, unlike, say ""Crash"" which literally screams out its meaning with every contrived incident and line of dialogue.  ""Babel"" requires its viewers to think - indeed it ASKS them to think - in ways ""Crash"" never comes even close to doing.  Like many challenging artists, Inarritu and Arriaga may be too full of themselves for some people's tastes, but at least they don't talk down to their audience.""Babel"" captures the paradox inherent in a world in which we are brought together by circumstances and our commonality as a species, yet driven apart by our differences.",4,drama with a kick,1169596800,"01 24,

1044738,A13D4E28S63SYF,B000MCH5P4,"Ron ""true faith""","[18, 40]","It appears quite a few reviewers think that ""Babel"" is about the loss of communication, communication problems, or communication gaps.  This may be true to a certain degree, but I don't think that's what ""Babel"" is essentially about.  The one thing these characters all have in common is that they're desperate to get something.  For example, the Brad Pitt character is desperate to get his wife to a hospital.  The Japanese teenager is desperate to get laid by a boy or attention from her father.  The Mexican housekeeper is desperate to get to her relative's wedding.  The Moroccan boy is desperate not to get blamed for shooting the American tourist so he frantically looks for a good place to hide the rifle.  Through their desperation they are incapable of having any kind of dialogue with anyone.  All they care about is to be heard.  They don't care about what the other person has to say.  The Brad Pitt character doesn't listen to the other bus riders about needing to get back to the hotel for their medicine.  The Japanese teenager doesn't listen to her father the first time about going to the dentist office.  The Mexican housekeeper doesn't listen to her nephew about not taking the two kids to the wedding. This is where the communication problems in the film come into play.  But this is all just surface stuff.All of these characters need to learn to stop thinking about themselves and to start thinking about other people.  When they can do this then they have achieved FORGIVENESS, which is something they are looking for.  For example, the Brad Pitt character seeks forgiveness from his wife for not being a very good husband--both in the U.S. and Morocco.  The Japanese teenager seeks forgiveness from her father for the death of her mother.  Because she was the one who discovered the dead body, she felt responsible for it.  The Mexican housekeeper seeks forgiveness from the Brad Pitt character for putting his children in harm's way.  The Moroccan boy seeks forgiveness from the American tourist for injuring her.We as human beings will always have communication problems with other people that upset us.  We need to get past the hurt that other people inflict upon us and forgive them.  This is exactly what Jesus preached.  As a matter of fact, his last words were: ""Forgive them Father for they do not know what they are doing.""  As far as I am concerned, ""Babel"" was about forgiveness.

I mention this because it seems relevant to the polyglot, multicultural, and braided nature of Babel, the movie.In Babel, a donated rifle affects events in four countries on three continents.  There are characters mourning over deaths, and deaths to be mourned.If I may continue to borrow from Wikipedia, and as other reviewers have noted about the ""Butterfly Effect,"" ""The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that ultimately cause a tornado to appear (or, for that matter, prevent a tornado from appearing). The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.""Babel is about the start of a small change in initial conditions.  The movie doesn't end with any resulting tornado.  Instead, it hints at additional effects further along in time, effects on individuals, families, communities, and even nations.I thought village life in Morocco was misrepresented, in that the screenwriter portrayed Moroccans as ignorant, uncaring peasants.  Village life certainly isn't the same as life in Rabat or Casablanca, but remember that Morocco has been a country longer than the U.S.; in fact, Morocco was the first country to recognize that new upstart country, the original 13 colonies calling themselves the United States.  I doubt that the Moroccan government would be that cavalier toward an attack on a tourist bus.I still enjoyed the movie, and it seemed particularly appropriate on a theater-sized screen.

1044744,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000MCH5P4,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","""Babel"" is poetry, building on its humble, multi-layered opening act into a remarkable, crushing peak of emotion before closing on a cathartic shot of such visual power that the camera pulls back into eternity and drags memories of the total experience along with it. Brave. Difficult. Tense. Masterful.Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez Inarritu, this is the final in their trilogy of complex, literate films exploring the human condition. ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"" were the flowering of their narrative skills. ""Babel"" is the best of them; it's also the easiest to follow and the least concerned with applying a fierce narrative logic to its jumbled storyline.There are four threads: A family of goat herders in Morocco; a married couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) on an Moroccan tourist bus; an illegal immigrant (Adriana Barraza) watching the couple's children back in San Diego; and a deaf Japanese girl named Chieko (Rinko Kikushi) whose beautiful eyes peer out at a world of moving mouths and empty words.Arriaga and Inarritu weave these global plotlines together, yet the movie is determined to be intimate. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto employs so many close-ups that we finally see Pitt's age around his eyes. When a character is hit, we see the blood washing over his whiskers. We see the tears developing in the corners of Chieko's eyes.We learn things about them. The illegal nanny's nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) listens to music a little too loud and taunts authority a little too much. Chieko pretends to understand her sexuality, but is in fact so shy and sweet and hungry for contact that she cozies up to a new friend and says ""You smell good!""In the Moroccan family, there are two brothers. The younger boy is more of a man than the older one. He likes to watch his sister take off her clothes then find a nook in the mountainside to think about her.What emerges, really, is a portrait of human frailty and brokenness. What suffering these characters endure! Not necessarily physical pain - although Blanchett's character is shot near the movie's beginning - but emotional and spiritual emptiness.Loneliness is suffering. To feel cheap is to suffer. To fear the police is suffering. To know you've made an unforgettable mistake that wipes your former life right off the chalkboard - that's an intense kind of suffering. Some of the characters in ""Babel"" find redemption; some of them are swept away.It seems unrelated to the rest of the movie, and it basically is, but the filmmakers invest the most in Chieko's story. To look at the girl is to want to hug her, but this isn't a girl who wants to be hugged. What she thinks she wants and is ready for reveals itself after a rapturous sequence in a Tokyo disco.From the third row of the theater, which is where ""Babel"" ought to be watched, Kikuchi is unforgettable. Give her every award. When Chieko finally releases all of her rage in muted sobs and asks, at long last, for empathy instead of exploitation, it is a crucial turning point. The movie would seem less without it.Which is not to say ""Babel"" is everyone. It begins slowly. Pitt and Blanchett are relegated to less meaty roles. Some viewers won't like the movie's non-linear, out-of-order structure. And some have levied the ""Crash"" critique against it, dredging up the backlash that pelted last year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture.I thought ""Crash"" was pretty effective, although it went off the rails in its final scenes. But ""Babel,"" while surreal, is more organic and believable. It integrates the use of several languages into the narrative, but doesn't pummel the point home. Arriaga and Inarritu aren't erecting paradigms and straw men so ideologies can collide.No. ""Babel"" is just about us. When we're scared. When we're happy. When we're hurt, or angry, or panicked or lustful. When we're the middle of the world or at the end of it. It is sincerity without the smarminess or sap, executed in visual ecstasy.

1044746,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000MCH5P4,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 2]","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Babel"" wrenches the viewer through a dizzying number of subplots all set in motion by a single act:  a gift of a hunting rifle by a Japanese businessman to his Moroccan hunting guide.  The common links between these various stories are (a) people do not listen to each other, and (b) our refusal to listen causes much of the pain in the world.This a true ensemble piece, and even though big-name stars like Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett appear in the film, they do not dominate the story.  They do form a critical core for the film.  Pitt and Blanchett are married Californians on a bus trip across Morocco's sunblasted mountains, hoping to find some normalcy in a strained marriage.  At the movie's outset, they have not yet been successful.On a parallel track, the hunting guide decides to sell the rifle he received from the businessman to a friend who needs the gun to protect his goat herds from jackals.  The friend has two young boys who tend the flock, and thanks to boys being boys, they end up taking shots at a tour bus as it drives by - not out of malice, but just to see if the bullets will go as far as advertised.Unfortunately, one of the bullet strikes Blanchett in the shoulder, and she is bleeding profusely.  Pitt must struggle to save his wife's life miles from any hospital and in a land where few speak English and a Band-Aid is the high water mark of medical care.Here is where Inarritu's theme of not listening takes off.  American authorities instantly proclaim the shooting as a terrorist attack.  This angers the Moroccans, who won't allow a helicopter in to rescue Blanchett.  A diplomatic standoff ensues.At the same time, the Californians' nanny takes their two children - whom she loves and has raised as her own - to Mexico to attend her daughter's wedding.  She has begged for someone to watch the kids, but nobody helps her.  After the wedding, her drunken nephew refuses her admonitions to be careful when driving across the border, and an argument ensues with a border guard.  This argument involves a lot of shouting and impulsive action, but at the end the nanny and the two kids end up stranded in the merciless desert.And finally, there is a very tough subplot involving the daughter of the Japanese businessman, who not only must struggle with being a teenager, but she is also a deaf-mute in a land that is not always that forgiving of medical impediments.This is a movie that lacks a true villain, but the absence of a villain does not mean there are no victims and there is no suffering.  Indeed, ""Babel"" is one of the most painful movies I've ever had to watch.  Do not look for simple answers or tidy little summaries of all the subplots.  This is a difficult, wrenching film.Many have compared this movie to ""Syriana,"" which also involved a convoluted plot and largely took place in the Middle East.  Do not confuse these two movies.  ""Syriana"" is a political tale.  ""Babel"" cares not a whit for politics except in the limited sense that our politics can serve as yet another layer of prejudice, a barrier to our understanding of our fellow man.  Inarritu's film says that we cannot forget that while we are talking about our own fears and prejudices, other people may be dying in front of us.",4,"One of the best ""feel bad"" movies of all time",1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3270,"['Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'Babel', 'viewer', 'dizzying', 'number', 'subplots', 'set', 'motion', 'single', 'act', 'gift', 'hunting', 'rifle', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'Moroccan', 'hunting', 'guide', 'common', 'links', 'various', 'stories', 'are', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'other', 'b', 'refusal', 'listen', 'causes', 'much', 'pain', 'world.This', 'true', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'even', 'big-name', 'stars', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'appear', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'dominate', 'story', 'do', 'form', 'critical', 'core', 'film', 'Pitt', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'married', 'Californians', 'bus', 'trip', 'Morocco', 'sunblasted', 'mountains', 'hoping', 'find', 'normalcy', 'strained', 'marriage', 'movie', 'outset', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'parallel', 'track', 'hunting', 'guide', 'sell', 'rifle', 'received', 'businessman', 'friend', 'who', 'gun', 'protect', 'goat', 'herds', 'jackals', 'friend', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'tend', 'flock', 'thanks', 'boys', 'being', 'boys', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'shots', 'tour', 'bus', 'not', 'malice', 'just', 'see', 'bullets', 'will', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'advertised.Unfortunately', 'one', 'bullet', 'strikes', 'Blanchett', 'shoulder', 'bleeding', 'profusely', 'Pitt', 'must', 'struggle', 'save', 'wife', 'life', 'miles', 'hospital', 'land', 'where', 'few', 'speak', 'English', 'Band-Aid', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'medical', 'care.Here', 'where', 'Inarritu', 'theme', 'not', 'listening', 'off', 'American', 'authorities', 'instantly', 'proclaim', 'shooting', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Moroccans', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'helicopter', 'rescue', 'Blanchett', 'A', 'diplomatic', 'standoff', 'ensues.At', 'same', 'time', 'Californians', 'nanny', 'two', 'children', 'whom', 'raised', 'own', 'Mexico', 'attend', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'begged', 'someone', 'watch', 'kids', 'nobody', 'wedding', 'drunken', 'nephew', 'admonitions', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'driving', 'border', 'argument', 'border', 'guard', 'argument', 'lot', 'shouting', 'impulsive', 'action', 'end', 'nanny', 'two', 'kids', 'end', 'up', 'stranded', 'merciless', 'desert.And', 'finally', 'very', 'tough', 'subplot', 'involving', 'daughter', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'struggle', 'being', 'teenager', 'also', 'deaf-mute', 'land', 'not', 'always', 'forgiving', 'medical', 'impediments.This', 'movie', 'true', 'villain', 'absence', 'villain', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'victims', 'suffering', 'Indeed', 'Babel', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'watch', 'Do', 'not', 'look', 'simple', 'answers', 'tidy', 'little', 'summaries', 'subplots', 'difficult', 'wrenching', 'film.Many', 'have', 'compared', 'movie', 'Syriana', 'also', 'involved', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'largely', 'took', 'place', 'Middle', 'East', 'Do', 'not', 'confuse', 'two', 'movies', 'Syriana', 'political', 'tale', 'Babel', 'not', 'whit', 'politics', 'limited', 'sense', 'politics', 'can', 'serve', 'yet', 'layer', 'prejudice', 'barrier', 'understanding', 'fellow', 'man', 'Inarritu', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'are', 'talking', 'own', 'fears', 'prejudices', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'dying', 'front']",N/A

This was quickly replaced by seeing countless, useless scenes that did nothing to propel the story or make the point that the director was trying to make (I assume he was trying to point out something with this film).If he was trying to show how things are inter-connected, he failed.  Are we supposed to be angry with the Japanese man for selling the gun to the Moroccan man because it was used in a tragic shooting?  That would be the same as if I sold my car to a man who then used it to kill someone in an accident.  The logic simply doesn't fit.Was the director trying to show how incredibly stupid people are?  Two Moroccan boys deciding to shoot their gun at a tour bus; a Mexican woman who takes someone else's kids across the border into Mexico without thinking about the consequences; a young Japanese woman who is so distraught regarding her mother's death, that she's attempting to get any man's attention through sexual advances.  If the director was trying to demonstrate the stupidity of people, he almost succeeds.There isn't enough characterization in this movie to make me feel anything for any of the characters in this film.  The only tragedy that I felt sad about was Susan (Cate Blanchett) being shot.Quite simply, what was the point of these three intersecting story arcs?  When a director/writer fails to get this across, I'm afraid that he's failed in what he's tried to do.  It doesn't matter to me if this film was recognized by some critics and also at the major award shows.There are too many scenes in this movies that have no bearing on the story.  What is the point of Amelia making out with a man in a phone booth?  Most of the sexual scenes in this movie do nothing to move the story.  They're simply there for sex sake.  Is it really necessary to show a young boy masturbating to the image of his older sister getting dressed?  Why is this important to what happens later when he shoots the bus?This film could have been so much better had we been allowed to really know the characters.  The Japanese girl had the best characterization.  But we still needed more from the other storylines.  I wish that the entire movie had been about the Japanese girl since her story was the most compelling, but there was still not enough of it.All in all this film was different, but not in a good or effective way.

The meaning behind the title is clear from the beginning, since the difficulty in communicating is palpable and has some serious consequences. The director I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, delivers a production that belongs to the highest echelon in terms of its artistic value, but has some elements that make it less than perfect. The movie generated a variety of conflicting emotions in me while I was watching it, and at some points I even considered stopping altogether. I am glad I did not, since even though it was not easy to stomach some portions, the final balance was clearly positive.The first story, which develops in Moroccan, shows a man buying a rifle and giving it to his two sons to kill jackals that accost their goats. The bullets are supposed to have a range of three kilometers, and when the kids are trying to verify this, they end up putting a shot inside a bus with tourists. This is when we get the second story, which is mainly in English. Richard and his wife are on a trip in Morocco, trying to rebuild their marriage after losing the smallest of their three kids. When the stray bullet hits Richard's wife, they are thrown into a morass of confusion, and have to manage to get help in a strange land. Meanwhile, back in the United States Amelia is taking care of Richard's kids and needs to go to the wedding of her son. Since there is nobody to take care of the children while she is gone, she decides to take them with her and her nephew. There is a factor that makes this less than straightforward though; the wedding is in Mexico. As you can guess, this third story is mostly in Spanish. Finally, the fourth story involves a deaf Japanese girl, Chieko, who is angry at her father and at most of the rest of the world, after losing her mother. This one develops in Japanese and sign language. At first there does not seem to be any connection between the story in Japan and the others, but all will be explained in due time.Besides the different languages used in the movie, there is a proficient use of a variety of music, which complements each portion perfectly. There is even a scene with Chieko, in which a deafening silence has an effect that is as noticeable as the music in other cases. The continuous jumping from one story to the next keeps the plot interesting and the slight time shifts are easy to follow. There were a couple of developments in the plot that really bothered me though, especially in the Spanish portion. It seemed to me that the creators were trying to get points for shock value, but they went too far and ended up losing them instead. I do not want to give away the scene I am referring to, but I am pretty confident you will spot it right away if you watch the movie.One of the biggest pluses I found in this film was the performances of all of the participants in the cast. Brad Pitt really surprised me, with a vivid and emotional portrayal of Richard. As usual, Cate Blanchett delivers a top notch performance, but her role requires limited screen time and renlinquishes her role almost to a secondary spot. The one that steals the prize is Gael Garcia Bernal, who plays Amelia's nephew, Santiago. He displays his usual charm and intensity in portraying a character that allows him to show his strengths as an actor.If you are not bothered by desperate situations, then I would say that you should definitely watch this movie. But if that is not the case, the circumstances are considerably harder to assess. I was a little bothered by some of the events, but found the experience to be satisfying, but my wife, who is more squeamish, was not able to go through with it. I hope that the review provides you with a basis to determine in which category you fall and whether you are likely to like this film.",4,"""Apparently some terrorist killed and American tourist""",1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,3860,"['film', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'interconnected', 'develop', 'different', 'languages', 'meaning', 'title', 'clear', 'beginning', 'difficulty', 'communicating', 'palpable', 'serious', 'consequences', 'director', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'production', 'highest', 'echelon', 'terms', 'artistic', 'value', 'elements', 'make', 'less', 'perfect', 'movie', 'generated', 'variety', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'was', 'watching', 'points', 'even', 'considered', 'stopping', 'altogether', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'stomach', 'portions', 'final', 'balance', 'was', 'clearly', 'positive.The', 'first', 'story', 'Moroccan', 'man', 'buying', 'rifle', 'giving', 'two', 'sons', 'kill', 'jackals', 'accost', 'goats', 'bullets', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'range', 'three', 'kilometers', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'trying', 'verify', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'shot', 'bus', 'tourists', 'when', 'get', 'second', 'story', 'mainly', 'English', 'Richard', 'wife', 'are', 'trip', 'Morocco', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'marriage', 'losing', 'smallest', 'three', 'kids', 'When', 'stray', 'bullet', 'Richard', 'wife', 'are', 'thrown', 'morass', 'confusion', 'have', 'manage', 'get', 'help', 'strange', 'land', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'Amelia', 'taking', 'care', 'Richard', 'kids', 'needs', 'go', 'wedding', 'son', 'nobody', 'take', 'care', 'children', 'gone', 'take', 'nephew', 'factor', 'less', 'straightforward', 'wedding', 'Mexico', 'can', 'guess', 'third', 'story', 'mostly', 'Spanish', 'Finally', 'fourth', 'story', 'deaf', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Chieko', 'who', 'angry', 'father', 'most', 'rest', 'world', 'losing', 'mother', 'one', 'Japanese', 'sign', 'language', 'first', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'connection', 'story', 'Japan', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'due', 'different', 'languages', 'used', 'movie', 'proficient', 'use', 'variety', 'music', 'portion', 'perfectly', 'even', 'scene', 'Chieko', 'deafening', 'silence', 'effect', 'as', 'noticeable', 'music', 'other', 'cases', 'continuous', 'jumping', 'one', 'story', 'next', 'plot', 'interesting', 'slight', 'time', 'shifts', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'were', 'couple', 'developments', 'plot', 'really', 'bothered', 'especially', 'Spanish', 'portion', 'seemed', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'points', 'shock', 'value', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'ended', 'up', 'losing', 'instead', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'scene', 'am', 'referring', 'am', 'pretty', 'confident', 'will', 'spot', 'right', 'away', 'watch', 'movie.One', 'biggest', 'pluses', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'performances', 'participants', 'cast', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'really', 'surprised', 'vivid', 'emotional', 'portrayal', 'Richard', 'usual', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'role', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'role', 'almost', 'secondary', 'spot', 'one', 'prize', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'Amelia', 'nephew', 'Santiago', 'usual', 'charm', 'intensity', 'portraying', 'character', 'show', 'strengths', 'actor.If', 'are', 'not', 'bothered', 'desperate', 'situations', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'case', 'circumstances', 'are', 'considerably', 'harder', 'assess', 'was', 'little', 'bothered', 'events', 'found', 'experience', 'be', 'satisfying', 'wife', 'who', 'more', 'squeamish', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'go', 'hope', 'review', 'basis', 'determine', 'category', 'fall', 'are', 'likely', 'like', 'film']",N/A

The film is a collection of very loosely intertwined narratives that debate the same theme; how this world seems deaf and blind to its true problems.In the first narrative, we have two Americans (Pitt and Blanchette) traveling abraod. When the woman is shot, terrorists are immediately blamed. Now, stuck in this country - and in the middle of a political war - Pitt has to try and deal with his wife's faith. Problem is, we, the viewers, know that this was not a terrorist attack but truly a prank gone bad, as the woman was shot by two pre-teen boys trying out their father's rifle. Their narrative is also revealed and the impact of their action is sad and shocking.Back in America, a Mexican nanny wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. But she is stuck with the two American kids is cares for. Deciding to bring them to her son's wedding is a mistake since, upon coming back into the US, she is accused of having kidnapped the kids since she is Mexican and has trouble communicating with the boarder patrol. This is by far the best narrative in this film. There is a scene where the woman runs away in the desert with the children. As she gets lost, you can see the fear growing in her, until she can no longer control everything she is feeling.Finally, in Asia, a young deaf woman only wants to be loved. But because she lacks communication skills, no one understands her basic needs. The fact that no one understands her and, in a way, that she doesn't understand her own self makes her one of the saddest characters I've seen on screen in a while.In the end, all these storylines are link. But this is not the important thing in this movie. This movie is about silence and about understanding through images and actions. The narrative is slow at times, but I liked the way the film took its time to tell its story. There is rarely a dull moment in Babel and the emotional punch strikes you right in the gut and steals your breath away.Babel really had an impact on me.

""Babel"" is a good movie, and one I would probably give 4 stars to, if it wasn't for the oh-so-important premise.  You aim high, you can also fall far.  Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is too good a director to fall very far, but he does stumble.  On the good side, just as in 21 Grams, he really brings out the best in his actors. For example, Brad Pitt is no longer Brad Pitt, but a gray haired husband and father on a vacation that turns bad.  There is an early scene Pitt has with Cate Blanchett at a table in a blasted landscape that I swear was influenced by Hemingway's short story ""Hills Like White Elephants.""  Clearly, Inarritu is one literate guy, and one who can frame that literacy in one remarkable scene after another.  But do all these fine parts equal a whole?  I don't think they do.Perhaps unintentionaly, the glue in all of this seems to be the furious camera work. Inarritu uses cinematography like a busy surgeon, zipping from the wastelands of Morocco, to the city lights of Japan, to the border of the U.S.  As dazzling as all this back and forth non-linear story-telling is, holes exist in the story, and in a way that the telling of it can not excuse.  You are left, by film's end with the sense that the relationship between the three stories is tenuous at best, and to insist for more wrecks the fragile balance Inarritu was trying to achieve.  As stand alone stories, I thought each could easily have been expanded into their own films.  But by insisting upon a connective thread, even if that thread is the paradoxical Babel message, the director was rolling for a high number and an audience that would appreciate and buy into the way in which he rolled.  In Babel's case, Style must go hand in hand with Substance, and that is not what Inarritu delivered.  Still, Inarritu is a great director who is going to make a lot of great films, and I welcome the risk taking going on in Babel, even if I'm not totally satisfied with the result.",3,Risk taking that comes up short,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,2032,"['Well', 'least', 'Babel', 'not', 'button-pushing', 'pretentious', 'Crash', 'Babel', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'oh-so-important', 'premise', 'aim', 'high', 'can', 'also', 'fall', 'far', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'too', 'good', 'director', 'fall', 'very', 'far', 'stumble', 'good', 'side', 'just', '21', 'Grams', 'really', 'out', 'best', 'actors', 'example', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'no', 'longer', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'gray', 'haired', 'husband', 'father', 'vacation', 'bad', 'early', 'scene', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'table', 'blasted', 'landscape', 'swear', 'was', 'influenced', 'Hemingway', 'short', 'story', 'Hills', 'White', 'Elephants', 'Clearly', 'Inarritu', 'one', 'literate', 'guy', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'frame', 'literacy', 'one', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'do', 'fine', 'parts', 'equal', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do.Perhaps', 'unintentionaly', 'glue', 'be', 'furious', 'camera', 'work', 'Inarritu', 'cinematography', 'busy', 'surgeon', 'zipping', 'wastelands', 'Morocco', 'city', 'lights', 'Japan', 'border', 'U.S.', 'As', 'dazzling', 'back', 'forth', 'non-linear', 'story-telling', 'holes', 'exist', 'story', 'way', 'telling', 'can', 'not', 'excuse', 'are', 'left', 'film', 'end', 'sense', 'relationship', 'three', 'stories', 'tenuous', 'best', 'insist', 'more', 'wrecks', 'fragile', 'balance', 'Inarritu', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'stand', 'alone', 'stories', 'thought', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'own', 'films', 'insisting', 'connective', 'thread', 'even', 'thread', 'paradoxical', 'Babel', 'message', 'director', 'was', 'rolling', 'high', 'number', 'audience', 'would', 'appreciate', 'buy', 'way', 'rolled', 'Babel', 'case', 'Style', 'must', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'Substance', 'not', 'what', 'Inarritu', 'delivered', 'Still', 'Inarritu', 'great', 'director', 'who', 'going', 'make', 'lot', 'great', 'films', 'welcome', 'risk', 'taking', 'going', 'Babel', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'result']",N/A

They even put that quote on the front of some of the Babel DVD art. The person that made that quote probably just doesn't like Pitt that much and was making a statement of rejoice as Pitt's screen time is kept to approximately 20 -30 minutes of the total 2 hours and 22 minutes.Pitt's performance was indeed very good. In fact, I think that Pitt's acting abilities (not his looks) are perhaps among the most underrated in Hollywood. But enough about Pitt....The movie was fantastically entertaining. A single shot from a rifle intricately weaves together and binds the lives of 4 groups of players...3 of which are in different parts of the world.I have perused some of the reviews here that simply outright tell the story that unfolds in Babel. And that's too bad. Because I'm sure that this movie was spoiled for many by such reviews...professional and Amateurazon.I went into this movie as I do most: I base my choice on the trailers and the average ""stars"" or ratings that a movie is getting. And let me tell you that Babel surprised me. I thought that I was in for a Kate Blanchett/Brad Pitt fest, but what I got was a story that was much more compelling, complex and expertly told by a director with a very short resume.Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu gives us Babel like he's been putting out classics for two decades. But his first film that gained any notoriety in the US at all was 2003's 21 grams. So kudos to I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu...a director that now will have surely earned the status of making people attracted to a movie just because his name is attached to it.There are some stretches of reality in Babel. But I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu does an excellent job of keeping the unreal real. The main take-away is that this is a relatively long movie that keeps you in your seat without the desire for a break. There's suspense, desperation, thrills, high emotion and different situations for every age group and culture to relate to in Babel.Definitely worth the purchase.

1044758,A63B8ZKTMU9FK,B000MCH5P4,Speednet,"[3, 7]","I'll get the negative stuff out of the way up front:  This movie has an underlying liberal agenda.  The movie teaches you that GUNS ARE BAD, that people in Afghanistan are not terrorists, that USA politicians are unreliable wishy-washy attention grabbers, and that everyone involved in law enforcement is a bad guy prone to hyperactive violence inflicted on poor, innocent, unarmed poor people.Well, OK, maybe the USA politicians idea is universally accepted as true, but I wouldn't doubt it was being aimed at the current Administration, which is kind of annoying.With that out of the way, I would highly recommend that any mature, thinking, film-loving adult see Babel.  It is an amazing work of creativity, especially in how it slowly reveals the interconnections that span the globe.  At first it is difficult to see any connection between various story lines, and it is at first a bit jarring to have the action completely switch gears and players.However, that feeling of being wrenched from one situation to another begins to change to awe, as you start to sense the intelligence and craftiness that went into the construction of the characters, plot points, and editing.I must say that the storyline involving the Japanese girl was the most intriguing and eye-opening, and the actress playing the girl is perhaps one of the most brave I have seen.  The scene in the disco near the end of her story thread was just amazing and emotionally engaging.On the topic of Brad Pitt, I thoroughly enjoy his performances -- always -- and I think he's one of the best actors working today.  There are probably a lot of people who will disagree with me and say that he's just there for his looks, but ever since I saw him years ago in Legends of the Fall I have been impressed by his performances.  That being said, I think he may not be the best actor for this role.  I can't put a finger on it, but my gut says he's the one who is most mis-cast -- but ever so slightly.Overall, my strong recommendation to see this movie is only extended to those who are not distracted or put-off by mature subjects and nudity.  You must be able to keep an open mind when you see events being portrayed in an anti-law enforcement perspective.  Also, if you are unable to ignore the strong anti-gun undercurrent, then you probably won't enjoy it as much.Myself, when I watch a movie I tend to immerse myself in the story without weighing each point against my own belief system, so I can experience it the way the director intended, even though I may have strong disagreements with Hollywood writers and their social agendas.  The only time I can remember finding myself unable to stay immersed in the story was in the movie, ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" with the little 7-year-old kid saying the Bible said the other kid was ""going straight to Hell"", but fortunately there was nothing in Babel that was quite so outrageous that took me out of it.",5,"Engrossing, takes many creative risks, anti-gun",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2922,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'negative', 'stuff', 'way', 'up', 'front', 'movie', 'underlying', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'movie', 'GUNS', 'ARE', 'BAD', 'people', 'Afghanistan', 'are', 'not', 'terrorists', 'USA', 'politicians', 'are', 'unreliable', 'wishy-washy', 'attention', 'grabbers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'law', 'enforcement', 'bad', 'guy', 'prone', 'hyperactive', 'violence', 'inflicted', 'poor', 'innocent', 'unarmed', 'poor', 'people.Well', 'OK', 'maybe', 'USA', 'politicians', 'idea', 'universally', 'accepted', 'true', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'was', 'being', 'aimed', 'current', 'Administration', 'kind', 'annoying.With', 'way', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'mature', 'thinking', 'film-loving', 'adult', 'see', 'Babel', 'amazing', 'work', 'creativity', 'especially', 'how', 'slowly', 'interconnections', 'span', 'globe', 'first', 'difficult', 'see', 'connection', 'various', 'story', 'lines', 'first', 'bit', 'jarring', 'have', 'action', 'completely', 'switch', 'gears', 'players.However', 'feeling', 'being', 'wrenched', 'one', 'situation', 'begins', 'change', 'awe', 'start', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'craftiness', 'went', 'construction', 'characters', 'plot', 'points', 'editing.I', 'must', 'say', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'eye-opening', 'actress', 'playing', 'girl', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'brave', 'have', 'seen', 'scene', 'disco', 'end', 'story', 'thread', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'emotionally', 'engaging.On', 'topic', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'always', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'are', 'probably', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'disagree', 'say', 'just', 'looks', 'ever', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'performances', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'gut', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'mis-cast', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly.Overall', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'extended', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'distracted', 'put-off', 'mature', 'subjects', 'nudity', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'see', 'events', 'being', 'portrayed', 'anti-law', 'enforcement', 'perspective', 'Also', 'are', 'unable', 'ignore', 'strong', 'anti-gun', 'undercurrent', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'much.Myself', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'tend', 'immerse', 'story', 'weighing', 'point', 'own', 'belief', 'system', 'can', 'experience', 'way', 'director', 'intended', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'strong', 'disagreements', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'social', 'agendas', 'only', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'finding', 'unable', 'stay', 'immersed', 'story', 'was', 'movie', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'little', '7-year-old', 'kid', 'saying', 'Bible', 'said', 'other', 'kid', 'was', 'going', 'straight', 'Hell', 'fortunately', 'was', 'nothing', 'Babel', 'was', 'quite', 'so', 'outrageous', 'took']",N/A

It is a lot more coherent to watch than '21 Grams' which was made by the same director and makes this more enjoyable as a result. The stories are a touch aimless at times and the endings, whilst linking up well, aren't very powerful. But I guess life is like that, you have events that have a major impact and then you keep on going, plus we are a lot more connected than we first realise. I guess that is what this film is trying to put across. The performances were excellent, especially Chieko, the japanese deaf-mute girl, where you really feel her frustrations and vulnerability and Brad Pitt who is better than I thought he'd be. The soundtrack, which is quite sparse, allowing the atmosphere of the film to permeate through, was moving when it had to be and was far enough in the background when most appropriate. The ending piece of music was especially moving and added perfectly to the final scene. This is a good film and worth a watch, it has no definite beginning, middle and end, but that in no way detracts from the various stories and their impact, although I feel that may have disappointed other reviewers here.

Movies nowadays come out with no theme and no general message, just a bunch of high priced actors doing what they do best with average dialogue in unique settings. However, an audience of humans, yes humans, takes what they see on the big screen and try to make sense of it. Our natural ability as humans is to try and make things better for ourselves and for our families. We look for positivity in every day life and sometimes come to the movies to escape every day reality and to dream and to look for hope and for overall solace. Well, you won't find that here with Babel. While the acting for the roles is quite superb, case in point the scenes in Japan by the Japanese actors, the overall story is the most depressing I've ever seen on big screen. If it wasn't for the Japan scenes, this movie would've been a big failure to me.  Go figure, I honestly thought the best performance was done by the deaf-mute Japanese girl.  The only thing that saved it was the fact that at the end of Babel's story, there was hope between the Japanese girl and her father.  But what about mom and dad in Morocco?  What about the kids?  What about the Mexican nanny?  The rest of Babel's 4 stories are just a mess of tragedy and despair.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[9, 15]","Nominated for six Academy Awards (and winner for Music Score), producer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's BABEL is a complex and challenging treat for adult moviegoers.  It demands full concentration, running 143 minutes and often with English subtitles.  And it thrillingly intercuts related stories taking place along parallel lines in Morocco, Tokyo, and the Mexico-California border.  It is a masterpiece that engrossed me while I watched it on DVD, and that haunts me one day later.We start in Morocco with American tourists Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  A nomad family has received a powerful rifle as a survival present.  Using it for fun, one child seriously wounds  Blanchett in a distant tour bus.  While she is taken by helicopter to a hospital in Casablanca, the incident is treated as an international terrorist attack by the media.Cut to Tiajuana, where a birthday party is taking place.  The guests include the kids of Blanchett and Pitt, plus their loyal long-time Mexican nanny (and Oscar nominee) Adriana Barraza.  At dawn, the party breaks up and Barraza and the two children head back toward California.  (They live in San Diego.)Cut to Tokyo, all bright lights and neon signs at night.  (The cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto.)  Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi plays a sex addict deaf-mute teenager who is frustrated at not being able to communicate with her businessman father.  Linking the Tokyo scenes to Morocco is the fact that the murder weapon was apparently sold to the Moroccan father by Kikuchi's father.  Critics who complain that the Tokyo scenes are irrelevant must have missed this crucial point.So, we have a long movie that excitingly intercuts scenes in Arabic in Morroco, in Spanish in Mexico, and in Japanese in Tokyo.  The yellow English subtitles on DVD are a huge help, and both Barraza and Kikuchi richly deserved their Oscar nominations.  So did editor Stephen Mirrione.  The brilliant common theme for Oscar nominees Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga is a lack of communication in a chaotic modern world.  The Moroccan family cannot communicate with the English-speaking media.  (Amusingly, a frustrated Pitt swears a lot, as if that would help expedite matters.)  Kikuchi, as a deaf-mute, perhaps takes off her clothes (the film has full female frontal nudity) to gain her father's and others' attention.  Most troubling of all, Barraza's illegal alien nanny character has a powerful pre-dawn confrontation with a Mexico-California border guard. He speaks Spanish, so he seems to be nasty with her just to set an example.Editor Mirrione cross-cuts these three beautifully written and acted subplots faster and faster as we pass the two hour running time mark, with twenty minutes or so to go.  BABEL is a masterpiece of filmmaking with a lingering power for me.  It is the crowning achievement for Inarritu,. who previously made AMORES PERROS and 21 GRAMS.  This is definitely his best film.  Does Barraza's Mexican nanny get deported or sent home to San Diego?  Does Japanese teenager Kikuchi make contact with her father?  And does Blanchett's American tourist survive her gunshot wound?  I will only say that the stories are satisfyingly and optimistically wrapped up for me, and that the final shot in nighttime Tokyo is haunting.  BABEL is not to be missed.",5,An Oscar-winning masterpiece with a lingering power,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,3315,"['Nominated', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'Music', 'Score', 'producer-director', 'Alejandro', 'Gonzalez', 'Inarritu', 'BABEL', 'complex', 'challenging', 'treat', 'adult', 'moviegoers', 'full', 'concentration', 'running', '143', 'minutes', 'often', 'English', 'subtitles', 'thrillingly', 'related', 'stories', 'taking', 'place', 'parallel', 'lines', 'Morocco', 'Tokyo', 'Mexico-California', 'border', 'masterpiece', 'engrossed', 'watched', 'DVD', 'haunts', 'one', 'day', 'later.We', 'start', 'Morocco', 'American', 'tourists', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'A', 'nomad', 'family', 'received', 'powerful', 'rifle', 'survival', 'present', 'Using', 'fun', 'one', 'child', 'seriously', 'Blanchett', 'distant', 'tour', 'bus', 'taken', 'helicopter', 'hospital', 'Casablanca', 'incident', 'treated', 'international', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'media.Cut', 'Tiajuana', 'where', 'birthday', 'party', 'taking', 'place', 'guests', 'include', 'kids', 'Blanchett', 'Pitt', 'loyal', 'long-time', 'Mexican', 'nanny', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'dawn', 'party', 'up', 'Barraza', 'two', 'children', 'head', 'back', 'California', 'live', 'San', 'Diego', 'Cut', 'Tokyo', 'bright', 'lights', 'neon', 'signs', 'night', 'cinematographer', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'sex', 'addict', 'deaf-mute', 'teenager', 'who', 'frustrated', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'communicate', 'businessman', 'father', 'Linking', 'Tokyo', 'scenes', 'Morocco', 'fact', 'murder', 'weapon', 'was', 'apparently', 'sold', 'Moroccan', 'father', 'Kikuchi', 'father', 'Critics', 'who', 'complain', 'Tokyo', 'scenes', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'crucial', 'point.So', 'have', 'long', 'movie', 'excitingly', 'intercuts', 'scenes', 'Arabic', 'Morroco', 'Spanish', 'Mexico', 'Japanese', 'Tokyo', 'yellow', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'are', 'huge', 'help', 'Barraza', 'Kikuchi', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'So', 'did', 'editor', 'Stephen', 'Mirrione', 'brilliant', 'common', 'theme', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Inarritu', 'writer', 'Guillermo', 'Arriaga', 'lack', 'communication', 'chaotic', 'modern', 'world', 'Moroccan', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'English-speaking', 'media', 'Amusingly', 'frustrated', 'Pitt', 'lot', 'would', 'help', 'expedite', 'matters', 'Kikuchi', 'deaf-mute', 'perhaps', 'clothes', 'film', 'full', 'female', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'gain', 'father', 'others', 'attention', 'Most', 'troubling', 'Barraza', 'illegal', 'alien', 'nanny', 'character', 'powerful', 'pre-dawn', 'confrontation', 'Mexico-California', 'border', 'guard', 'Spanish', 'so', 'be', 'nasty', 'just', 'set', 'example.Editor', 'Mirrione', 'cross-cuts', 'three', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'subplots', 'faster', 'faster', 'pass', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'mark', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'go', 'BABEL', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking', 'lingering', 'power', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Inarritu', 'who', 'previously', 'made', 'AMORES', 'PERROS', '21', 'GRAMS', 'definitely', 'best', 'film', 'Does', 'Barraza', 'Mexican', 'get', 'deported', 'sent', 'home', 'San', 'Diego', 'Japanese', 'teenager', 'Kikuchi', 'make', 'contact', 'father', 'Blanchett', 'American', 'tourist', 'survive', 'gunshot', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'stories', 'are', 'satisfyingly', 'optimistically', 'wrapped', 'up', 'final', 'shot', 'nighttime', 'Tokyo', 'haunting', 'BABEL', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

I found last year's Crash to be a much better drama of this sort (multiple stories intermingling). The acting is stellar, the story is well told, and the scenery and imagery were breathtaking. These worlds I have known -Mexico and Japan, and I enjoyed watching those scenes. I thought this movie was probably a good thirty to forty-five minutes too long, especially since much of the ending seemed a bit too easily wrapped up. All-in-all, though, you could watch dozens of bigger wastes of time than Babel and it is a solid, thought provoking, and somewhat provocative movie.On a side note...what saddens me the most as I read the reviews is how so many people got uptight with some of the images in the movie. Their own discomfort with such things says more about them than the movie's content. Better to live in your dream world than to face reality, I guess. Now there's the real tragedy and truly the missed point of the movie. Movies like this force the viewer to confront things they'd rather not think about as they go about the deadening banality of their socially accepted and sanitized lives. I'm sure a good soaking in the bathtub of their home in the cul-de-sac followed by a excessive bloat at Applebee's and a materialistic orgasm at Wal-Mart made everything all better.",3,Solid but slow and somewhat unsatisfying,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1353,"['enjoyed', 'Babel', 'not', 'level', 'best', 'picture', 'year', 'found', 'last', 'year', 'Crash', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'drama', 'sort', 'multiple', 'stories', 'intermingling', 'acting', 'stellar', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'scenery', 'imagery', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'worlds', 'have', 'known', '-Mexico', 'Japan', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'scenes', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'thirty', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'much', 'ending', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'wrapped', 'up', 'All-in-all', 'though', 'could', 'watch', 'dozens', 'bigger', 'wastes', 'time', 'Babel', 'solid', 'thought', 'provoking', 'somewhat', 'provocative', 'movie.On', 'side', 'note', 'what', 'most', 'read', 'reviews', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'got', 'uptight', 'images', 'movie', 'own', 'discomfort', 'such', 'things', 'more', 'movie', 'content', 'Better', 'live', 'dream', 'world', 'face', 'reality', 'guess', 'Now', 'real', 'tragedy', 'truly', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'Movies', 'force', 'viewer', 'confront', 'things', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'think', 'go', 'deadening', 'banality', 'socially', 'accepted', 'sanitized', 'lives', ""'m"", 'sure', 'good', 'soaking', 'bathtub', 'home', 'cul-de-sac', 'followed', 'excessive', 'bloat', 'Applebee', 'materialistic', 'orgasm', 'Wal-Mart', 'made', 'everything', 'better']",N/A

Pitt and Blanchett are the focus of one of the stories, but the other three are probably more compelling.The film will take you to Morocco, the US, Mexico and Japan. It deals with themes such as love, loneliness, adolescence, the law, and kindness.

1044769,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B000MCH5P4,Suzanne,"[79, 89]","I have to start by saying how desperately hard I found this film to review. It's so complex, has so much to say, and works on so many levels. At the same time, it's not an easy film. It's apparent reading the reviews how much trouble people have had with this film - for any number of reasons. Perhaps they felt it a bit long, and didn't care about what was being said. Perhaps they couldn't relate to the actions and choices the characters made, and didn't sympathize or empathize with them. Or perhaps the film's unusual structure left them a bit cold and disconnected. Whatever the reason, the 3.5 star current rating reflects the majority's inability to really ""connect"" with this film.For those who don't know, Babel tells 4 different revolving stories across 4 countries (USA, Mexico, Morocco, Japan), and how the actions of one effected all of the others. On another level, the Biblical story of Babel was a story of how man tried to build a tower to God. In doing so they were struck down and punished by speaking different languages - rendering their ability to communicate null. Babel takes this idea of man's inability to communicate and creates a film that expresses this idea on a multitude of levels. Whether it's through race and discrimination, cultural differences, handicaps, or through personal anger and estrangement.I also find it very interesting that the over-arching idea of communication is told in a backwards but interlocking fashion through the 4 storylines. Starting from the last to enter to the first what we see is: Man's desperate, primal need to communicate with others. This basic idea is rendered in a heartfelt, poignant manner through Rinko Kikuchi's performance of a deaf teenager, and reiterated in many scenes. The separation and isolation from others is driven home through the dance club sequence, and Rinko's sobering exit. The next stage is man forming bonds with others. This is told through the relationship of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. This single stage of communication is on the intimate, personal level with another person.Moving from this we get to a larger stage, in man creating societal groups, and forming barriers to separate from other society groups. This point is driven home by the Mexico/America border scene. This creation of barriers and walls is one that's inevitable as large groups start to form. And it's through this that discrimination is born. The final stage is how man causes harm to others because of these barriers. It's ironic, or perhaps appropriate that this violence is expressed through the actions of children. What better way to show how discrimination caused by separation caused by lack of communication can effect not only ourselves but future generations?It has been noted many times that the cinematic merits of this film are impeccable, and nearly impossible to dispute. Editing, cinematography, score, sound, etc. are all handled with a true level of directorial mastery. The acting is equally superb. The two ""big names"" of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in terrific and (surprisingly) understated performances. They're not given alot to work with, but they bring a level of depth to roles that could've been extremely hollow. But Rinko Kikuchi, as the Japanese teenager deserves extreme praise for her handling of a particularly difficult role. The demands on her in this film are higher than any one else. Throughout all of her scenes she runs the gamut of emotions, and she handles them with a level of genuine emotion and a delicate touch. Even in a film with great all-around performances, she steals the show. Adriana Barraza as the Mexican nanny is almost equally as good as Rinko. Finally, Mustapha Rachidi as the Moroccan farmer is only of lesser note in light of the other extraordinary performances, but is excellent as well.I find the two storylines of the Moroccan farmer and his family, and the Mexican nanny are the two most difficult. I say this because of the 4 storylines, these were the only two that ended up in the situations they did because of bad decisions. But is it so simple? In the case of the Moroccan farmer and his children, they end up in the situation because of the children being forced to grow up so fast. This is expressed in multiply ways throughout the storyline. Is the reason they end up where they do due to stupidity or just immaturity? In the case of the Mexican nanny, she makes one seemingly harmless decision to take the children she's watching to a marriage in Mexico. But on the way back a series of horrendous events leaves her and the children struggling for their lives in the desert. The scene where things break down at the border is one of the films key moments regarding communication.It could be the cultural divide. It could be the odd, interlocking narrative. Whatever it may be, Babel is just not going to be a film that's a huge hit here in the USA. It's interesting that this film is about man's inability to communicate, and Americans are particularly bad in that we're too wrapped up in our own culture. If we don't understand it, we don't like it. It really says something that this film has been a huge hit throughout the world, but grossed relatively little here. Films like Crash, Syriana, and the like have garnered much more attention, yet Babel has out-grossed them both world-wide, but not here. Overall I think it will be left up to the individual in terms of how much they get out of this film. If you're willing to look deeper and try to understand each individual story within its context and what's being said, this is a film that will likely really hit home with you. Its resounding statement is how we should really stop and take the time to listen to one another and then go the extra mile to not just listen, but really understand one another.",4,A Multi-Cultural

Meanwhile, the shooting victim's Mexican housekeeper takes her two children illegally from the United States to Mexico to attend a wedding, and later gets busted while trying to return to San Diego. Then, there's a Japanese family somehow involved. As it turns out, the father in the Japanese family had given the rifle to a Moroccan hunter guide, who then sold it to a man whose kids end up shooting the American woman.

This film is basically about a series of highly unlikely unfortunate events (usually the result of a really bad decision) occurring to a small group of people, with each event more depressing and unbelievable than the last. It's an emotional snuff film, offering only a voyeuristic trip into human misery. If you like to watch people suffer at the mercy of situations beyond their control, then then film is for you!About midway through this film it began to strike me as almost a parody of itself; the never-ending chain of gut-wrenching, anguishing events are truly over-the-top. The same film could have been made simply by filming little children as their pet-kittens are pried from their hands, and then thrown out a car-window into oncoming traffic.

1044780,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000MCH5P4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 7]","I suspect most people will either love or hate ""Babel"", the new film from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director of ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"".This film sort of slipped under my radar. I have seen the trailer a few times, but that is about it. No advanced press or information about it, something I found strange considering the film stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal. After watching the film, this makes sense. The film is being positioned to be one of those ""conversation starter"" films, films that create buzz and then earn some Oscar nominations. The smaller it looks, the better its chances.""Babel"" is a very good film. It has some flaws, but I am willing to overlook most of those due to the power of the story and the acting.A Moroccan goat herder buys a gun from a neighbor; he wants to keep the Jackals away from his goats, to preserve his cash flow. He gives the gun to his two sons, who take the goat herd out every day. The two boys, alone and bored, decide to test the statement of the neighbor who sold their father the gun; can the bullets reach 3 km. One of the boys is adept at using the weapon, the other is not. Finally, a tour bus makes its way down a barren road below them. Taking aim, they fire. After a few moments, the bus stops and the boys run away. An affluent California couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are traveling through Morocco on the tour bus. It is clear they have some problems in their marriage and perhaps the trip is a method of patching up the relationship. Dozing off to sleep, the wife suddenly gasps in pain; she has been shot. The husband asks the Moroccan guide where they can go. He says that his village is nearby and there is a doctor there. The other tourists are frightened, but the woman is losing too much blood. Back home, the couple's nanny is waiting for their sister to arrive and watch the couple's two young children. The husband calls; his sister can't make it. The nanny is expected at her son's wedding the next day in Mexico. Her boss says ""Cancel the wedding, I'll pay for a better wedding when I get back"". She decides to take the children with her. Her nephew (Gael Garcia Bernal) shows up to drive and they are off on an adventure. In Tokyo, a confused teenager (Rinko Kinkuchi), who is also a deaf mute, is having difficultly hiding her anger; her mother died a few months earlier and the relationship between she and her father is strained. She is also very anxious to have sex and many of the boys treat her as a freak when they find out she is a deaf mute. So she teases them and other men, in an effort for some release.Now, you might say to yourself after reading this synopsis, as I did while watching this film, ""What connection does a deaf mute Japanese teenage girl have to the rest of the story?"" And the answer is ""A very tenuous one."" For a film like this to work, a film containing elaborate, multifaceted stories, everything has to be connected and work well together, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Everything else fits into place nicely and works together, which makes the Japanese story stand out all the more. The connection is just too small.That said, the story is interesting, unusual and worth watching.Over the years, there have been many film and television projects following the course of one item through the hands of multiple owners. And there have been other projects exploring the consequences of one action through different stories. ""Babel"" is a little of both.The gun passed down from one farmer to the other causes the beginning of the film, but the other elements are connected to this American couple and the gun, allowing the story to branch off from two different places. This is ultimately what makes the film as a whole better than the mistakes of individual parts. Because Inarritu is taking us in many directions, he has to create a compelling and interesting story. He has done that. In spades.As the American couple wait in the small Moroccan village for an ambulance, the rest of the tourists become antsy. It's hot and the driver won't turn on the air conditioning because that will waste gas and he can't stop at a corner gas station for a refill. The tourists are also frightened because they are in a small village where they believe anything can happen. A local brings them a plate of flatbread, because they must be hungry, yet they avoid her. She could be a terrorist trying to poison them. The Mexican nanny is clearly devoted to the children in her care, but her family obligations require her trip to Mexico. She decides to take them along and because they have grown up with her, they are completely at ease. Once they arrive at the wedding, these shy children have a great time, meeting new people, learning new things. The Moroccan boys hide the gun when their father comes home and states an American tourist was shot. Naturally, they are scared and don't breathe a word of the incident to their dad. The Japanese girl finds it difficult to find a companion. She and her friend are introduced to another friend's cousin, a handsome boy who doesn't seem to mind they are deaf because he has grown up with his cousin and he even understands some sign language. After an afternoon of drinking and partying, they go out dancing. As she moves in, she finds the boy kissing her friend. Heartbroken, she wanders the busy streets of Tokyo.Because each of these stories has many layers, the filmmaker holds our attention to the very end. Yes, some of these stories have problems, but in the end, I suspect that is probably what he wants to get across. It makes them seem more real, more life like, because life isn't neat and tidy.If you have seen either of Inarritu's previous films, you will recognize this film as his own. In ""Babel"", each of the stories is connected, but the timelines of each story are not synced. For instance, we first meet the Moroccan man and his family, learn about their life and watch as the neighbor trades them a gun and bullets. Then, they teach the sons how to use the gun and the boys take the goats out and do a little target practice. Then, a tour bus appears in the distance. The film cuts to a home in California. The Mexican nanny rushes to answer the phone. On the other end, Pitt is calling from Morocco, distraught, but he explains that his sister will be flying in to take care of the kids. The next day, he calls again to let the nanny know that the sister can't make it, she will have to stay and watch the kids, cancel the wedding. Then we watch as Brad and Cate sit at a makeshift caf&eacute; in the Moroccan desert. Cate is very unhappy, uses sanitizer on her hands and won't drink a coke with ice because she doesn't know where the water came from. Later, she is shot by a stray bullet. The next day, the nanny's nephew comes to pick them up and take them to the wedding. All of this happens within the first fifteen or twenty minutes and we pick up some stories before other stories start, shifting between the timelines of each with ease. Near the end of the film, you realize some of these story threads start much later than others. Because of this, some of the stories are the consequence of other actions in other parts of the film. Inarritu plays with the chronology of the film; it looks like we are watching things unfold simultaneously, but later we learn the secret to this story and how everything fits into place.""Babel"" will not be remembered because of the acting, it will be remembered because of the storytelling. Clearly, these actors wanted to be involved because of the director and the story; each of the actors is playing a character we meet in mid story. They aren't allowed to have full character arches because the director only wants us to see specific things at precise times. As a result, much of Cate Blanchett's screen time is spent depicting her character's suffering from the gunshot wound she has received. Most of Brad Pitt's, the anguish of a husband unable to stop his wife's pain. Bernal's character is the driver for the nanny and her children, to get to her son's wedding. He acts as a facilitator, getting the children acclimated to their new surroundings, but then he has a good time, along with everyone else, during the festive ceremony. It doesn't even matter that these characters do not develop very much, they are there to serve the story and the story is what is important in ""Babel"".That Japanese story. I keep coming back to that. Because the connection is so tenuous, you would expect it to provide greater illumination to the overall theme of the film, to help us see what the other stories are trying to portray. But it doesn't. The story is interesting and unusual; I can think of few depictions of Japanese teenager's on film, even fewer depictions of deaf mute teenagers and no previous portrayals of deaf mute Japanese teenagers. We are immediately drawn in and the character is interesting, perhaps the most fully developed. But she has very, very little to do with the Moroccan farmers, the American couple and the Mexican nanny. During her journey, Inarritu experiments with the sights and sounds of her journey, trying to make us as disoriented as she must feel. But this can't be the sole reason for her inclusion in this story. Can it?""Babel"" is a well-made, complicated film depicting four very different groups of people who are all connected by circumstances created by others. It is interesting, thought provoking and well-done. Not perfect, but well-done.",4,Interesting Story and Good Performances Compensate for the Mistakes,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,9538,"['suspect', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate',

In ""Babel"" things look unnecessarily convoluted.For me the most impressive part of ""Babel"" is the story about the family living in the Moroccan desert. There two kids accidentally shoot one of the American tourists with a rifle (though they don't know the consequences until much later). These two child actors are amazing with natural and compelling performances, better than Brad Pitt and Cate Banchett as the stranded travelers, and their actions, not wise but credible, well-represent the ripple of the butterfly effect. Actually with their stories alone ""Babel"" could be a great film with its message ""Tower of Babel"" intact.So, why should these stories in Africa be connected to the other two parts about the American couple's nanny and Japanese high school girl? Though each story is well acted, American and Japanese sections are weaker than those about the Moroccan family. Yes, after some slack moments these two stories finally deliver; one in the desert and the other in Tokyo apartment and ruptured timelines are not hard to follow thanks to the skillful editing, but the abrupt wrap-ups (especially the first one) is very disappointing.I know the director's flair for interlocked narrative, and he uses it quite tactfully here, but I think a simpler approach would be as effective as that.

Though reminding quite a bit of the movie, Crash, this film proved to be a powerful drama with compelling performances by all of its actors.  I was struck in how a simple act of kindness by a Japanese businessman on a hunting trip in Morocco when he gives his guide a rifle as a gift can have such an astounding affect on four different families around the world.  This is the basis for the movie.  When the guide later sells the rifle to a nearby Moroccan family, the father of the family gives the rifle to his two small sons so that they can shoot the jackals that are eating their goats.  The boys are not very old--maybe eight and ten.  Trying to see just how far the rifle will shoot, the boys end up hitting a tourist bus and Cate Blanchett's character is shot in the shoulder.  This event has the ripple affect as her husband, who's played by Brad Pitt, attempts to get medical help for his injured wife in the middle of nowhere.  Their Mexican nanny will be affected as she makes the decision not to miss her son's wedding in Mexico and to take the two children in her charge with her.  This will have dire consequences for all involved.  There's also the Japanese businessman and his deaf daughter, who's still recovering from the suicide of her mother.  The journey that Babel takes is filled with hardship, stupidity, anger, and compassion.  There are no easy answers to the things that happen.  Even at the end, you still feel kind of empty due to the tragedies that have already taken place.  I have to say that Adriana Barraza as the Mexican nanny and Rinko Kikuchi as the Japanese daughter steal the film with their non-flinching, emotional performances.  The director of the movie, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, manages to capture the true humanity in each of the characters and how we're all interconnected in today's world.  Babel is certainly a film worth seeing and worth owning for your DVD library.  There are no extras with this DVD, so a collector's edition may be coming out this summer.

1044805,A2W7GQG04QCEVT,B000MCH5P4,Wendell,"[5, 8]","Quite a good film. I'm not sure why it seems to rub some people the wrong way. Perhaps the fact that a Mexican director is showing such international reach is a problem for some people. If so, that's unfortunate because it's a gift that films like this exist - films that expose American audiences to the complex interconnections of the modern world. Don't watch this if you're not willing to sit through a slow, thoughtful and understated film, though. This is a far cry from Brad Pitt's normal fair, but if you've seen and enjoyed any Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu films this one won't disappoint you.All the acting is good. It's nice seeing Brad Pitt showing his age a bit, looking older. I see this as his setting the groundwork for a continuing career, one that will carry on after his pecs and abs go a little soft. Cate Blanchett is a bit wet, but that's her character. It can't be easy to play someone who spends most of the film writhing in pain or feverish. Adriana Barraza is great. You really feel for her as she stumbles through a worsening situation. Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is always good, even though the character he plays in the one makes all the wrong choices.

Director Inarritu masterfully interweaves four stories (each fully capable of standing on its own as a feature) into a series of connected experiences and shows how events in each person's life effects others.All four stories are extremely distinct, and not just because of the different languages and locations, but the way the filmmakers have chosen to portray each situation. At the very core, Babel is a story about how as humans we have lost the ability to communicate with each other successfully. This is shown in all levels, from the obvious (language barriers, governmental red tape) down to the more discreet (emotional confusion, sexual angst). The lives in each story revolve around personal communication and trying to break the barriers that prevent us from expressing ourselves to others.In the end, the film may leave you feeling depressed and a bit confused, but Babel isn't offering any solutions to the issues it brings up, merely presenting them. And for creative storytelling and remarkable acting, look no further than this continent-spanning epic on the minutiae of communication.Brief rant:The trailer for Bable is misleading, as is the poster. Both prominently feature Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, and seem to market the film as a star vehicle for the two *name* actors. Babel is nothing of the sort. Not that their characters aren't important, or their acting brilliant, but as you can tell from the Oscar nominations (Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi, both for Best Supporting Actress), the film isn't all about Blanchett and Pitt.
