1266224,A4KL031C6WV6R,B002FG9NBE,Rodamu,"[0, 0]",Elvis's early years are profiled some 50 years after the events covered.  It must be hard to find people who knew the young Elvis and to present details not already covered in scores of other biographies. But this short film gives an acceptable history of a musical genius who transformed popular music and culture in the middle of the 20th Century. It is unfortunate that more musicians were not found who could discuss more fully Elvis's approach and understanding of music.,4,"A limited, somewhat subjective but informative Bio.",1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,476,"['Elvis', 'early', 'years', 'are', 'profiled', '50', 'years', 'events', 'covered', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'young', 'Elvis', 'present', 'details', 'not', 'already', 'covered', 'scores', 'other', 'biographies', 'short', 'film', 'acceptable', 'history', 'musical', 'genius', 'who', 'transformed', 'popular', 'music', 'culture', 'middle', '20th', 'Century', 'unfortunate', 'more', 'musicians', 'were', 'not', 'found', 'who', 'could', 'discuss', 'more', 'fully', 'Elvis', 'approach', 'understanding', 'music']",N/A
1266225,AH3YDMM67FS3S,B002FG9NBE,"Sheila L Schmitz ""Sheila""","[0, 0]","I was especially interested in seeing this video because when I was a teenager I spent a week in Tubelo and thought it would be interesting to see exactly how Elvis lived when he lived there.Even though I have been a big Elvis fan all my life, I learned a lot about Elvis that I did not know until I watched this video. I won't give away what I learned because I think some of you will be just as surprised as I was.Watching this video made you understand why Elvis was the generous person that he was after he became famous and rich--always giving his money away or helping someone who needed help. He lived in such abject poverty when he was growing up that I am sure that made him compassionate and sympathetic later in life toward others who had less than he did. I knew that Elvis grew up poor, but not to the extent that this video shows. While watching his days of poverty, it makes you appreciate what you have--especially when you were thinking that you did not have enough.I really enjoyed all the interviews with the people who knew Elvis--especially of the people he grew up with and knew him. I had to laugh out loud when an old girl friend was telling about her first date with Elvis--how she never kissed on a first date but let Elvis kiss her. You will just have to watch to see what she had to say about the first kiss he gave her--that is what made me laugh so hard.The end of this video was so touching that I found my eyes teary--Elvis was so human and so unsure of himself just like the rest of us when it comes to wanting people to accept you. Watch this video if you are an Elvis fan and you will be glad that you did.",5,Best documentary I have ever seen about Elvis,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1641,"['was', 'especially', 'interested', 'seeing', 'video', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'spent', 'week', 'Tubelo', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'Elvis', 'lived', 'when', 'lived', 'there.Even', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'life', 'learned', 'lot', 'Elvis', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'watched', 'video', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'learned', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'surprised', 'was.Watching', 'video', 'made', 'understand', 'why', 'Elvis', 'was', 'generous', 'person', 'was', 'became', 'famous', 'rich', 'always', 'giving', 'money', 'away', 'helping', 'someone', 'who', 'needed', 'help', 'lived', 'such', 'abject', 'poverty', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'am', 'sure', 'made', 'compassionate', 'sympathetic', 'later', 'life', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'less', 'did', 'knew', 'Elvis', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'not', 'extent', 'video', 'watching', 'days', 'poverty', 'appreciate', 'what', 'have', 'especially', 'when', 'were', 'thinking', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Elvis', 'especially', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'knew', 'had', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'old', 'girl', 'friend', 'was', 'telling', 'first', 'date', 'Elvis', 'how', 'never', 'kissed', 'first', 'date', 'let', 'Elvis', 'kiss', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'first', 'kiss', 'gave', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'hard.The', 'end', 'video', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'found', 'eyes', 'teary', 'Elvis', 'was', 'so', 'human', 'so', 'unsure', 'just', 'rest', 'when', 'wanting', 'people', 'accept', 'Watch', 'video', 'are', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[17, 17]","An in depth look at Elvis from birth to 1956 - superbly done!There have been a lot of documentaries released over the years on Presley's life and career. This 2008 film from Michael Rose Productions is one of the best and - while it covers some of the territory that's been done before - there's enough newly discovered footage and interviews to appeal to those who already own ""everything Elvis"".Kris Kristofferson narrates the 90-minute film which takes us from Pressley's birth in Tupelo, Mississippi  (and even some background on his parents) through his high school years (with new interviews with many of his high school friends) and on to his move to Memphis and recording for Sun Records. It stops in 1956 just as he heads to Hollywood to make his first film (""Love Me Tender""). There is a lot of discussion about race and Elvis' interest in Black music; more than I have seen before. And we hear the real story behind his hip swiveling from his closest friends. Only two musicians are interviewed: One of the original Jordanaires and DJ Fontana, his drummer. Other interviews are with his early girl friends, country music historians and even local Tupelo tiur guides! Rose seemed to have found every person in Tupelo who ever knew Elvis and gathered some really rare footage and still photos that I don't think have been shown before.The 60 minutes of ""bonus material"" include newsreels about Elvis from the period (though why there is a 3-minute one on the Tornados in Tupelo, I don't know). And a 12 minute ""Drew Pearson's Merry-go-round"" film about Elvis from the 1950s. Then there are what must have been outtakes from the documentary where the interviewees comment on Elvis meeting Bill Monroe and the women who dated Elvis. These add nicely to the package.Elvis fans will want this but so should anyone interested in pop culture and the music business in the early to mid-1950s.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,An in depth look at Elvis from birth to 1956 - superbly done!,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1927,"['depth', 'look', 'Elvis', 'birth', '1956', 'superbly', 'done', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'documentaries', 'released', 'years', 'Presley', 'life', 'career', '2008', 'film', 'Michael', 'Rose', 'Productions', 'one', 'best', 'territory', 'been', 'done', 'enough', 'newly', 'discovered', 'footage', 'interviews', 'appeal', 'who', 'already', 'own', 'everything', 'Elvis', '.Kris', 'Kristofferson', '90-minute', 'film', 'Pressley', 'birth', 'Tupelo', 'Mississippi', 'even', 'background', 'parents', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'new', 'interviews', 'many', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'move', 'Memphis', 'recording', 'Sun', 'Records', '1956', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'first', 'film', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tender', 'lot', 'discussion', 'race', 'Elvis', 'interest', 'Black', 'music', 'more', 'have', 'seen', 'hear', 'real', 'story', 'hip', 'swiveling', 'closest', 'friends', 'Only', 'two', 'musicians', 'are', 'interviewed', 'One', 'original', 'Jordanaires', 'DJ', 'Fontana', 'drummer', 'Other', 'interviews', 'are', 'early', 'girl', 'friends', 'country', 'music', 'historians', 'even', 'local', 'Tupelo', 'tiur', 'guides', 'Rose', 'seemed', 'have', 'found', 'person', 'Tupelo', 'who', 'ever', 'knew', 'Elvis', 'gathered', 'really', 'rare', 'footage', 'still', 'photos', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'before.The', '60', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'material', 'include', 'newsreels', 'Elvis', 'period', 'why', '3-minute', 'one', 'Tornados', 'Tupelo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '12', 'minute', 'Drew', 'Pearson', 'Merry-go-round', 'film', 'Elvis', '1950s', 'Then', 'are', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'outtakes', 'documentary', 'where', 'interviewees', 'comment', 'Elvis', 'meeting', 'Bill', 'Monroe', 'women', 'who', 'dated', 'Elvis', 'add', 'nicely', 'package.Elvis', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'so', 'should', 'anyone', 'interested', 'pop', 'culture', 'music', 'business', 'early', 'mid-1950s.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
