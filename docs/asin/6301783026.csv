Second, many of the camera shots are long takes as the characters move from one area to another. This is only part of the reality style: the camera never looks away. As the accident happens, the rubber-neckers (viewers) are right there, watching the entire scene unfold. Third, the sumptuous of the individual costumes and stages pieces is in stark contrast to the bare openness of the set. Then there is the raw offensive brutality of a way too successful gangster (Gambon) tyrannizing his wife and crew. Plus, there is the titillating full frontal, never look away, nudity of both the voluptuous Helen Mirren and her male lead, who have several scenes in which they never put on clothes and yet remain exposed, vulnerable, in rooms in the restaurant and their hiding place. Set, dialogue, color, violence, nudity are used in ways that film rarely does.This work exposes the dangerous volcanic emotions running underneath all of ourselves, and our clothes.",4,A film school classic.,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,1272,"['Much', 'Stanley', 'Kubricks', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'disturbingly', 'different', 'style', 'cinema', 'photography.First', 'exterior', 'interior', 'large', 'massively', 'stylish', 'restaurant', 'stretched', 'huge', 'Hollywood', 'soundstage', 'Broadplay', 'ran', 'continuously', 'one', 'theater', 'several', 'city', 'blocks', 'Second', 'many', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'long', 'characters', 'move', 'one', 'area', 'only', 'part', 'reality', 'style', 'camera', 'never', 'away', 'accident', 'rubber-neckers', 'viewers', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'watching', 'entire', 'scene', 'unfold', 'Third', 'sumptuous', 'individual', 'costumes', 'stages', 'pieces', 'stark', 'contrast', 'bare', 'openness', 'set', 'Then', 'raw', 'offensive', 'brutality', 'way', 'too', 'successful', 'gangster', 'Gambon', 'tyrannizing', 'wife', 'crew', 'titillating', 'full', 'frontal', 'never', 'look', 'away', 'nudity', 'voluptuous', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'have', 'several', 'scenes', 'never', 'put', 'clothes', 'yet', 'remain', 'exposed', 'vulnerable', 'rooms', 'restaurant', 'hiding', 'place', 'Set', 'dialogue', 'color', 'violence', 'nudity', 'are', 'used', 'ways', 'film', 'rarely', 'does.This', 'work', 'dangerous', 'volcanic', 'emotions', 'running', 'ourselves', 'clothes']",N/A

Leprechaun 2 is available on DVD, and this isn't.I remember when this was released, it had just gotten a very positive review in the NY Times, and the theater was packed.  Well, by the end of the film,  there were plenty of empty seats.  I've never seen so many people walk out  on a movie, or in such a steady flow.  It was as though the people who  found it distasteful had very different levels of tolerance, or perhaps  that the film offered an unusually broad selection of potentially offensive  subjects.  There were actually people who walked out during the last 10  minutes.  Still, there were plenty of viewers who were transfixed by this  exquisite film, including me.  In fact, I had to go see it again the very  next day.  I can't remember being quite so affected by any movie.Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon are both very good here, but what really  sets this film apart are the stunning, painterly compositions and the lush  cinematography (by Sacha Vierny).  The brutal violence, the dialogue, the  characters and plot all serve as a background to the film's dazzling visual  spectacle.  This inversion is somewhat typical of Peter Greenaway's films  in general, but this is perhaps his masterpiece.

So, the deal is: Peter Greenaway is a film maker, not an entertainer. His plots are rudimentary - on purpose. He still packs more story in than most mainstream directors. If you like dense, talky films, however, you'll hate this film. His characters are sharply drawn - you'll know the characters for what and who they are immediately. This clears the way for the visuals, which when combined with the soundtrack produce a sort of film-fugue that I found wonderfully effective in moving from scene to scene. There is a compelling, accessible plot, but plot and style hang together as equals in Greenaway films. This makes for &quot;arty&quot; looking films, which is an annoyance to some and a Very Good Thing to others. The &quot;fugue effect&quot; can be distracting to a &quot;mainstream&quot; filmgoer. Another common complaint - the &quot;gross out&quot; factor. Truth is - it's far less gross than pretty much any action film, and much less violent. However, when there is something disgusting or violent onscreen, Greenaway hits so viscerally that the film can seem more disturbing than it is. As far as the cannibalism, well, it ain't what you think - I'll leave it at that. One of the best things about this film - it stands up well to repeat viewings, and you will always see new things in it. There is also an underlying aesthetic and moral statement in this film, which is nice for a change. You may not agree with me that it is a great film, but it is great for aspiring filmmakers and photographers. For me, it is my single favorite film period. It is, I admit, an acquired taste. It is also the most mainstream-accesible of the Peter Greenaway films I've seen so far, which is rather scary. Bottom line - if you like your mac and cheese out of a box; if 'Independence Day' is your idea of a great film; if the word &quot;art&quot; is irrevocably wedded to the word &quot;fart&quot; in your mind; if my use of the word &quot;aesthetic&quot; totally turned you off this review, you'll hate it and should buy &quot;Gladiator&quot; instead.",5,"Get it, or not - updated.",989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,2138,"['People', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'have', 'something', 'worthy', 'right', 'Right', 'So', 'deal', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'film', 'maker', 'not', 'entertainer', 'plots', 'are', 'rudimentary', 'purpose', 'still', 'more', 'story', 'most', 'mainstream', 'directors', 'like', 'dense', 'talky', 'films', 'however', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'sharply', 'drawn', ""'ll"", 'know', 'characters', 'what', 'who', 'are', 'immediately', 'way', 'visuals', 'when', 'combined', 'soundtrack', 'produce', 'sort', 'film-fugue', 'found', 'wonderfully', 'effective', 'moving', 'scene', 'scene', 'compelling', 'accessible', 'plot', 'plot', 'style', 'hang', 'together', 'equals', 'Greenaway', 'films', 'quot', 'quot', 'looking', 'films', 'annoyance', 'Very', 'Good', 'Thing', 'others', 'quot', 'fugue', 'effect', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'quot', 'quot', 'filmgoer', 'common', 'complaint', 'quot', 'gross', 'quot', 'factor', 'Truth', 'far', 'less', 'gross', 'pretty', 'much', 'action', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'violent', 'However', 'when', 'something', 'disgusting', 'violent', 'onscreen', 'Greenaway', 'so', 'viscerally', 'film', 'can', 'seem', 'more', 'disturbing', 'As', 'far', 'cannibalism', 'well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'up', 'well', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'will', 'always', 'see', 'new', 'things', 'also', 'underlying', 'aesthetic', 'moral', 'statement', 'film', 'nice', 'change', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'aspiring', 'filmmakers', 'photographers', 'single', 'favorite', 'film', 'period', 'admit', 'acquired', 'taste', 'also', 'most', 'mainstream-accesible', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'rather', 'scary', 'Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'mac', 'cheese', 'box', 'Day', 'idea', 'great', 'film', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'irrevocably', 'wedded', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'mind', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'aesthetic', 'quot', 'totally', 'turned', 'off', 'review', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'should', 'buy', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 'instead']",N/A

I was eighteen back then, and the movie impressed me so much, I saw it three times in a week. Watching it again recently, I realized the movie has aged badly. It has some very strong visual conceits, with its color coded rooms and strictly horizontal camera moves. But the dialogue and the situations are ridiculous, not to mention the gratuitous shocks Greenaway imposes on the audience. To the uninitiated, Greenaway seems to be a masterful artist, but the more you watch great movies by great directors (Fellini, Kiarostami, Ozu, Kurosawa, Paradjanov), you realize he is more of an impostor than a real artist. And Greenaway's misanthropy means his films has no real insight on human nature; the characters in his movies are constructions not flesh-and-blood people. There is not denying he is a visually talented artist, but his take is somewhat shallow. In any case, right now he belongs more to the art world than to the cinema world, and he probably feels more at home that way.",3,"Good, but flawed",1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,1032,"['saw', '1990', 'shortly', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'eighteen', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'Watching', 'again', 'recently', 'realized', 'movie', 'aged', 'badly', 'very', 'strong', 'visual', 'conceits', 'color', 'coded', 'rooms', 'strictly', 'horizontal', 'camera', 'moves', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'mention', 'gratuitous', 'shocks', 'Greenaway', 'audience', 'uninitiated', 'Greenaway', 'be', 'masterful', 'artist', 'more', 'watch', 'great', 'movies', 'great', 'directors', 'Fellini', 'Kiarostami', 'Ozu', 'Kurosawa', 'Paradjanov', 'realize', 'more', 'impostor', 'real', 'artist', 'Greenaway', 'misanthropy', 'films', 'real', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'characters', 'movies', 'are', 'constructions', 'not', 'flesh-and-blood', 'people', 'not', 'denying', 'visually', 'talented', 'artist', 'take', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'case', 'right', 'now', 'more', 'art', 'world', 'cinema', 'world', 'probably', 'more', 'home', 'way']",N/A
265837,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301783026,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","I guess I should sound a loud alarm, and yet many have already done so, that this film is not for everyone.  In fact, this film isn't for most people.  It shows graphic depictions of sex, torture and eventual cannibalism.  It isn't shy about anything, divulging in gross imagery as well as direct and graphic language that completely engulfs every frame.  But, for every moment that makes you cringe, `The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover' is laced with such beautiful imagery and electrifying performances that it balances out rather beautifully.Yes, the film feels `right' despite being so very, very wrong.`The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover' takes place nearly solely in a restaurant, a restaurant owned and occupied by a British thug who is loud, crass and violent.  In fact, the film opens with Albert (this said thug) brutishly humiliating a man who owes him money by stripping him naked right in front of the restaurant and assaulting him, lathering feces on his naked body and then urinating on him.  The film follows each dinner between Albert, his wife Georgina and their friends (or I should say, his friends).  Georgina, obviously `over it' finds solace in a bizarre affair with a bookworm named Michael.  The two first meet for spontaneous intercourse in a restroom where their affair is almost immediately thwarted by Albert's intrusion.  From that point forward, the two gallivant in the kitchen behind a carefully placed sheet that shields them from the mayhem happening in the kitchen itself.  The affair cannot last secretly for long, especially since their meetings are `between courses', and so the eventual is upon them as Albert violently vows to eradicate the man taking delight in his wife's body.As I mentioned in the outset of this review, the film strikes an odd yet marvelously astute balance between the beautiful and the obscene.  The actions of many of the characters, including Georgina and her lover, can be seen as crude and `gross' and yet the scenery (those walls, those rooms, those costumes; that food) is all flawlessly detailed in the most eye-catching and glorious of ways.  It sets in the mind the knowing of Albert's awful tendency to desecrate all that is beautiful and it carries with it a weight that is subtle despite the glaring obviousness of the films `gimmicks'.And then there is Helen Mirren.Can I just say now that I really love her as an actress, I just wish that the world in general (and namely the Academy) had recognized her earlier in her career, when she was putting out astonishing work in films like `The Long Good Friday', `Mosquito Coast' and this bizarrely fantastic film.  Yes, I would trade all three of her Oscar nominations (including the one she won the gold for) for the three performances I just mentioned, all of which she should have been nominated for (and arguably could have won for any of them).  Here she captures such raw sensuality while maintaining so emotionally distracted, completely detached from her own vile existence.  She is ashamed and afraid of what she has endured and yet is validated in her brief moments of happiness.  To watch her body crumble as her husband's voice floods the bathroom or to watch her melt as she gives herself to her lover or to watch her eyes flicker in defiance as she humiliates her husband with devilish talk at the dinner table or to eventually see her glisten with loathing as she forces that brute to pay for his sins; it is all so magnetically delivered with passion and phenomenal depth.So, in closing I recommend this film to any film lover with an iron stomach who appreciates art for what it is and isn't quick to dismiss a film solely on the grounds of audaciousness; since audacious is a term aptly applied to this brilliant film.",5,Beautifully disgusting; if that makes any sense...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3777,"['guess', 'should', 'sound', 'loud', 'alarm', 'yet', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'most', 'people', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'sex', 'torture', 'eventual', 'cannibalism', ""n't"", 'shy', 'anything', 'divulging', 'gross', 'imagery', 'as', 'well', 'direct', 'graphic', 'language', 'completely', 'engulfs', 'frame', 'moment', 'cringe', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Her', 'Lover', 'laced', 'such', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'electrifying', 'performances', 'out', 'rather', 'beautifully.Yes', 'film', 'feels', 'right', 'being', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'wrong.', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Her', 'Lover', 'place', 'nearly', 'solely', 'restaurant', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'occupied', 'British', 'thug', 'who', 'loud', 'crass', 'violent', 'fact', 'film', 'Albert', 'said', 'thug', 'brutishly', 'humiliating', 'man', 'who', 'money', 'stripping', 'naked', 'right', 'front', 'restaurant', 'assaulting', 'lathering', 'feces', 'naked', 'body', 'then', 'urinating', 'film', 'dinner', 'Albert', 'wife', 'Georgina', 'friends', 'should', 'say', 'friends', 'Georgina', 'obviously', 'solace', 'bizarre', 'affair', 'bookworm', 'named', 'Michael', 'two', 'first', 'meet', 'spontaneous', 'intercourse', 'restroom', 'where', 'affair', 'almost', 'immediately', 'thwarted', 'Albert', 'intrusion', 'point', 'forward', 'two', 'gallivant', 'kitchen', 'carefully', 'placed', 'sheet', 'mayhem', 'happening', 'kitchen', 'affair', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'secretly', 'long', 'especially', 'meetings', 'are', 'courses', 'so', 'eventual', 'upon', 'Albert', 'violently', 'eradicate', 'man', 'taking', 'delight', 'wife', 'body.As', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'review', 'film', 'odd', 'yet', 'marvelously', 'astute', 'balance', 'beautiful', 'obscene', 'actions', 'many', 'characters', 'including', 'Georgina', 'lover', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'crude', 'gross', 'yet', 'scenery', 'walls', 'rooms', 'costumes', 'food', 'flawlessly', 'detailed', 'most', 'eye-catching', 'glorious', 'ways', 'mind', 'knowing', 'Albert', 'awful', 'tendency', 'desecrate', 'beautiful', 'weight', 'subtle', 'glaring', 'obviousness', 'films', ""gimmicks'.And"", 'then', 'Helen', 'Mirren.Can', 'just', 'say', 'now', 'really', 'love', 'actress', 'just', 'wish', 'world', 'general', 'namely', 'Academy', 'had', 'recognized', 'earlier', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'putting', 'out', 'astonishing', 'work', 'films', 'Long', 'Good', 'Friday', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'bizarrely', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Yes', 'would', 'trade', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'one', 'won', 'gold', 'three', 'performances', 'just', 'mentioned', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'arguably', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'Here', 'such', 'raw', 'sensuality', 'maintaining', 'so', 'emotionally', 'distracted', 'completely', 'detached', 'own', 'vile', 'existence', 'ashamed', 'afraid', 'what', 'endured', 'yet', 'validated', 'brief', 'moments', 'happiness', 'watch', 'body', 'crumble', 'husband', 'voice', 'floods', 'bathroom', 'watch', 'melt', 'lover', 'watch', 'eyes', 'flicker', 'defiance', 'husband', 'devilish', 'talk', 'dinner', 'table', 'eventually', 'see', 'glisten', 'loathing', 'brute', 'pay', 'sins', 'so', 'magnetically', 'delivered', 'passion', 'phenomenal', 'depth.So', 'closing', 'recommend', 'film', 'film', 'lover', 'iron', 'stomach', 'who', 'art', 'what', ""n't"", 'quick', 'dismiss', 'film', 'solely', 'grounds', 'audaciousness', 'audacious', 'term', 'aptly', 'applied', 'brilliant', 'film']",N/A

To address the sound, this DVD does not have subtitles.  If you're an American unaccustomed to thick British accents, that presents a problem...Secondly, the film posits most of the action from a distance- frequently employing a horizontal tracking shot which parallels the actors as they walk from room to room.  There are few closeups, and the movie really disorients the viewer in terms of what action we should focus on.  Given the overwhelming lavishness and richness of the sets, the human actors often compete with inanimate parts of the sets for our attention.  Thirdly, the film is so hyper-stylized as to lose its narrative power.  Human relationships are shaped into sweeping metaphors regarding British society.  The central love story between The Wife (Helen Mirren) and Her Lover (Alan Howard) involves nearly no verbal communication.  They have a connection, but it is not conveyed in recognizable human terms.  The Cook is compassionate and long-suffering, but again, this film does not depict him or any of the characters as more than superficial fodder for a political polemic.  There were aspects of the film I certainly enjoy- Greenaway conveys a palpable atmosphere of the evils of excess.  Scatology and food and violence are linked together with remarkable vulgarity.  The garishness and inhumanity of the restaurant is genuinely unsettling.  However, ultimately, Greenaway's supposed masterpiece bored me.

This will work for you if you accept it on those terms and enjoy the artistry and design of the piece, like a prose opera,  but will be a turnoff if you want a more direct and realistic narrative.Arch and wry and by turns graceful and brutal, this film is presented in stately tableaus, with the performances alternately theatrically ritualized and realistically brutal.  There are gorgeous images counterposed with gross ones. There are Greenaway's typical non-sequiturs, i.e., characters and images presented without explanation and curiously belonging to the film without benefit of any logic or reason for being so.A brutal and cruel thug gets his comeuppance.

It is indeed true that not all of the events portrayed in the film are nice or pretty, but neither are they gratuitous.  The characters are sharply and intelligently drawn and the cinematography is nothing short of virtuoso (indoor cinematography is a much greater challenge than the outdoor variety).  Any film buff will want this film for the visuals alone.I would like to go on about the plot.  But if you have not seen this film yet, taking that journey with Peter Greenaway and the stellar cast is something to be experienced with as little information as possible.

In &#65533;The Cook, the tief, his wife and her lover&#65533; is why people who like &#65533;regular&#65533; movies should stay far from his.It has a quite simple plot. Everyday a tief goes to the same French restaurant with his wife and his buddies. His wife starts to develop a crush on a bookeeper who&#65533;s there everyday too. The begin a love affair, and the only place where they can meet is in the kitchen while her husband is having dinner and won&#65533;t suspect of something. It is the French chef and his crew who helps them to decive the husband --mostly because he is a bad man, and want him to be decived.So the story goes, food, sex, naked people, violence... and --what&#65533;s a feather in the movie&#65533;s hat-- a stunning cinematography! You can&#65533;t say there are twits in the plot --we more or less know what will happen, because these things are the natural course of the story. Well, until the last 10 minutes, that&#65533;s when you say &#65533;Oh my God! He won&#65533;t do that...&#65533; and... watch it and find out what Greenaway does --in a scene that Hannibal Lecter would really really love!The acting is perfect. Hellen Mirren has never looked so beautiful. Her costumes desingned by Jean Paul Gautier makes all the difference too, and the use of colors has a point. What I admire most is how she was daring with her character and she is not afraid of being naked --maybe her work in &#65533;Caligula&#65533; helped somehow. By the way, Greenaway is one of the few moviemakers who&#65533;s not afraid of nudity both male and female.

265846,A20IIR0422G3A5,6301783026,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 4]","The movie on the DVD for `The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover', written and directed by Peter Greenaway is probably about as far out in left field of the English and American filmmaking style as you can probably get without adopting Mel Gibson's device of directing a movie for an American audience spoken in two languages of antiquity. Greenaway's aesthetic belongs to a very select group of directors such as Ken Russell and Terry Gillian who follow their muse in some very unusual directions. The bridge between the conventional and the unconventional represented by Greenaway, Russell, and Gillian can probably be bridged by reference to some of the work of Stanley Kubrick such as `2001' and `Full Metal Jacket'.One thing which Greenaway, Gillian, and Kubrick share with some greats such as the early Orson Wells and the directors who inspired him is an interest in making the whole cinematic environment work to contribute to the effect produced by the film. Greenaway and Gillian's set decorations in movies like this and in Gillian's `Brazil' and `The 12 Monkeys' is so rich you find yourself going through them with a pause at every new scene so you can take in all the rich detail of the stage setting. Greenaway's work is filmed in a large but almost completely enclosed set of four rooms encompassing the exterior, the kitchen, the dining room, and the lavatory of a very large restaurant. Each of the four main rooms has a predominant color and characters' costumes seem to literally change color as they move from one room to the next.The change in colors is only the beginning. I almost believe Greenaway choose a restaurant as the principle venue of this little set piece as it offered such a rich source of images created by arrangements of produce, meats, pots and pans, knives, dough mixers, and sausage makers. The fate of unattended meat and walk-in freezers play an important role in some events in the story. Other important Greenaway trademarks in the stage setting are great oversized letters brought into the restaurant early in the movie as the pieces to the new name of the restaurant. These seem to have a role similar to the numbers in Greenaway's earlier work, `Drowning by Numbers' but don't quote me on that one.The title of the movie does not do justice to the first two of the main characters, as `the Cook' is actually the head chef of this very large restaurant who rules over his kitchen as you may expect from Wolfgang Puck or Emeril Lagasse. `the Thief' is not a petty criminal but the owner of the restaurant and a fairly large scale racketeer whose main business is not simple burglary or bank holdups, but extortion which, like real gangsters, can be lacquered over with a veneer of civility (see `The Godfather, Part I'), if it were not for the fact that `the Thief' is a loutish bully who routinely beats his wife, lesser employees, and patrons in his restaurant.A synopsis of the story is very simple which would easily fit into 80 minutes of a good film noir flick. The story of `The Maltese Falcon' makes this one look like it came from a relatively short story. Virtually all action takes place within and immediately outside the restaurant where the thief commonly assembles his subalterns and their consorts to dinner with him and his wife. `the Wife' makes frequent trips to what seems to be a unisex lavatory set entirely in bright white to meet in sexual congress with her lover, who is a solo diner in the same restaurant and whose attention, while eating, is buried in a book. The wife with the fact that if they meet right under her husband's nose, he will never suspect anything justifies the highly risky encounters. The problem with this reasoning is that the husband is so possessive, he can't abide the wife's frequent absences and follows her into the WC to hunt her down. This close escape is small melodrama compared to later scenes when the lover and the wife join in full unclothed intimacy hidden by the devices of the cook who provides them a place to hide in the giant kitchen pantry.True to the wife's belief that the husband would not suspect hanky panky right under his nose, the couple is found out by a consort to one of the thief's underlings. At this point, when one finds it hard to believe the situation can get much more odd, it does. The naked pair escape the restaurant while naked by hiding in a walk-in freezer, then by making a getaway in the back of a truck filled with decomposing raw meat seen arriving at the restaurant three or four `movie days' before when the story opens. The fact that the thief finds and kills the lover is mundane compared to the wife's revenge on the husband, with help, again, from the cook.While there are four lead actors on the marquee, the film is owned by Helen Mirrin and Michael Gambon playing the wife and the thief. Their roles and their interpretation of these roles so fill the screen as to make virtually all the other performances to blend in with the overrich scenery. Even Tim Roth, an important member of Quentin Tarantino's troupe of players who gets fifth billing, is practically invisible. Practically the only other role to stand out is that by a singing dishwasher whose voice fills the kitchen while he scrubs his pots and who plays a part in the discovery by the thief of the illicit lovers' hidey hole.This is possibly Peter Greenaway's best known film, but I think it is just a bit less well done than `Drowning by Numbers'. And, while I would still give this movie five stars, the DVD screams out for a director's commentary and there is none. So, the DVD gets but four stars.",4,Great Impressionist Moviemaking.

Not that ""enjoyment"" is the right word here, nor is it what Greeanway is after. It really held my interest for about the first two thirds. Then it just got silly. Sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism. I always love Gambon's work. Yet here he is even more over the top than is Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, and that's saying something. Not exactly a believable character, outside of Baghdad (that bad boy Urday!). Mirren is sexy and very good in her role. That little albino choir boy is incredibly annoying. I wanted something bad to happen to him, myself, just to get him to stop that nail on a blackboard noise!I hear there is a pretty climactic ending. I'll never know as I didn't watch the last 15 minutes. I'm generally willing to readily suspend disbelief, but in this film, it just drifts way too far into the realm of the absurd to hold my interest. Not that absurdity in itself is necessarily a bad thing (I'm a big Beckett fan). But if you're making an artistic decision, you must decide, one way or the other, and the work must maintain its vision and inner logic (no matter how illogical). A case in point, Bunuel's Un chien andalou. The given reality that forms the backdrop for this picture dissolves as the movie progresses. If that was Greenaway's intent (he wrote the screenplay as well as directed), to portray some sort of human devolution, that's fine. I suppose he could justify it also as a kind of Brechtian distancing from the audience, aiming for some sort of artistic statement or other. That's generally enough to get the attention and approval of viewers of a certain mindset.We all want to think that we are more aware, open and discerning than the ordinary Joe who wanders into the theater by mistake. Our self image is reinforced when Joe walks out of the theater in disgust or because he is too dim to comprehend the significance of the genius on display, that is so easily perceived by the cognoscenti. Once in a while art is just bad art, however. When an artist falls in love with his imagination and gives in to his excessive tendencies, as is the case here, the result can be rather ugly.BEK",3,Greenaway's Bestiary,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,2253,"['watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'guess', 'must', 'be', 'too', 'big', 'Philistine', 'something', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Not', 'enjoyment', 'right', 'word', 'here', 'what', 'Greeanway', 'really', 'held', 'interest', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'Then', 'just', 'got', 'silly', 'Sensationalism', 'sake', 'sensationalism', 'always', 'love', 'Gambon', 'work', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'top', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'saying', 'something', 'Not', 'exactly', 'believable', 'character', 'Baghdad', 'bad', 'boy', 'Urday', 'Mirren', 'sexy', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'little', 'albino', 'choir', 'boy', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'wanted', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'just', 'get', 'stop', 'nail', 'blackboard', 'noise', 'hear', 'pretty', 'climactic', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'last', '15', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'generally', 'willing', 'readily', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'film', 'just', 'drifts', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'realm', 'absurd', 'hold', 'interest', 'Not', 'absurdity', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', ""'m"", 'big', 'Beckett', 'fan', ""'re"", 'making', 'artistic', 'decision', 'must', 'decide', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'work', 'must', 'maintain', 'vision', 'inner', 'logic', 'matter', 'how', 'illogical', 'case', 'point', 'Bunuel', 'Un', 'chien', 'andalou', 'given', 'reality', 'backdrop', 'picture', 'movie', 'was', 'Greenaway', 'intent', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'portray', 'sort', 'human', 'devolution', 'fine', 'suppose', 'could', 'justify', 'also', 'kind', 'Brechtian', 'distancing', 'audience', 'aiming', 'sort', 'artistic', 'statement', 'other', 'generally', 'enough', 'get', 'attention', 'approval', 'viewers', 'certain', 'mindset.We', 'want', 'think', 'are', 'more', 'aware', 'open', 'discerning', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'who', 'theater', 'mistake', 'self', 'image', 'reinforced', 'when', 'Joe', 'theater', 'disgust', 'too', 'dim', 'comprehend', 'significance', 'genius', 'display', 'so', 'easily', 'perceived', 'cognoscenti', 'Once', 'while', 'art', 'just', 'bad', 'art', 'however', 'When', 'artist', 'love', 'imagination', 'excessive', 'tendencies', 'case', 'here', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'ugly.BEK']",N/A

Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","There is a connection between food, gluttony, sex and violence and it all intersects in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover. The title pretty much sets up both the characters and the plot line. Albert (Michael Gambon) is an amoral thief who pretends to greatness. He eats dinner each night over a roughly two week period at Le Hollandais run by the Cook (Richard Bohringer).Albert is married to Georgina (Helen Mirren) who he mistreats terribly as he also mistreats everyone and everything he comes into contact with. Georgina begins a torrid affair with bookish Michael( Alan Howard) in the restaurant literally under her husband's nose. This affair is facilitated by the Cook. Suffice it to say that when the thief finds out about this affair very nasty things happen.This is not a film for everyone. Perhaps, it is not a film for very many people. I think that there is a great allegory here of the British government under the Thatcher administration. But I'm not really a social commentator. What I do know is that this is a very angry film but it is also one of the most artistic films I've ever seen. Each shot is perfectly framed as if one were watching a painting. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier are fantastic and the photography by Sacha Vierny was clearly award worthy.This is an adult film in that it was made for thinking adults. If you're looking for standard Friday night movie fare you'll want to look elsewhere. If you are not turned off by images of vile gluttony it is certainly worth a look.

Just go with the flow and enjoy this grotesquely compelling tale of sadism, decadence,  illicit love, and jaw-droppingly gruesome retribution, or feel free to explore Greenaway's deeper intentions in giving us such cleverly colour-coded debauchery and stunning juxtaposition.The hideous Spica (Gambon) - an unholy cross between a  Falstaffian trencherman and a vicious gangland thug, wields absolute power in the crimson opulence of the dining area.  Like some sacrilegious parody of Christ's last supper, Spica sits centre-table surrounded by a host of well-loved British characters.  Look! Isn't that Trigger from Only Fools and Horses  (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and there's grandma Royle (Liz Park). Even the late great Ian Dury is in there trying to do wicked things with his rhythm stick and Gary Olsen, sadly lamented by his 2.4 children.  But oh boy, is that /really/ (Dame!) Helen Mirren doing all those naughty things virtually under her abusive husband's nose?Leaving the blood-red velvet of the dining room, we are swept to the pristine white, almost paradisiacal appearance of the lavatories. Here, the earthiest and most explicit sex acts take place between the furtive lovers (Mirren and Alan Howard), reminding us of one of Spica's diatribes, when he comments on the proximity of the organs of defecation and reproduction. A brutal flash of crimson intrudes upon the white, when Spica bursts in.  Seeking refuge elsewhere, the lovers enjoy moments of passion in rooms surrounding the astonishing kitchen, making love amongst hanging game birds and pigs' heads, whilst the albino choir-boy's innocently beautiful voice soars above all.  When forced to flee, still naked, the lovers take refuge in a truck full of rotting meat and fish, in a scene strangely reminiscent of the work of Hieronymus Bosch . Freud would have a field day!As the atmosphere of menace builds, the inevitability of the lovers' exposure becomes apparent.  Spica's revenge is utterly horrific, in one of the most unsettling torture scenes I have ever witnessed.  But in a cautionary tale such as this, how will the villain get his just ""desserts""?Well, no more spoilers. Just watch it and see.  We can probably all guess what's going to happen, but the denouement, when it comes, is still satisfyingly hideous.  This is a delicacy, and you know where it's been!  The crimson curtain finally drops after almost 2 hours have simply flown past,  and you can finally breathe out, mouthing the word ""wow!""Nyman's stunning score (partly reprised from Greenaway's earlier ""A Zed and Two Noughts"") complements the film perfectly and will be stuck in hour head for days afterwards.Sadly, no extras on the DVD and, with no 5.1 sound,  this appears to be a straight port-over from VHS. The sheer magnificence of this movie, though, almost every scene from which could be hung in the Tate, precludes me from giving anything less than five stars.

Gardner,"[2, 2]","If this film was a conscious allegory about Margaret Thatcher's England (about the intellectuals &amp; the public going to sleep and all that), it equally well applies to present-day US. Stripped of that possible meaning, it's simply a savage exercise in the trashing of the sensibilities of the art-film audience in the most visceral way possible. Supposedly, Greenaway wondered what it would be like to present a modern-day Jacobean revenge play, but it seems more a movie by a man who was at war with his own sensibilities, as if by doing violence to them he was trying to body-slam both high-society pretentiousness (symbolized here by the obsession with fine food) and have his revenge against those who would pretend to such a station (Albert Spica, the horrendous restauranteur-thief). The beautiful, color-coded images and tableaux, the over-the-top costumes and relentlessly driving Nyman music are entirely overturned by the coarse/eloquent dialogue and action (like just about every Greenaway film). It's a movie whose content attacks its form.But the acting is great. Gambon's Albert Spica is one of the most memorable villains in the movies--the brutal boor. You flinch with apprehension every time the scene switches back to him (although he's onscreen most of the time). You don't know what outrageously offensive thing he'll say next--except that it will be outrageous and offensive. His character is one-dimensional, and so repellent that you eventually try to turn off what he's saying, but this is on purpose. He's one of those people who thinks he can buy or bully his way into respectability and high society because, as Richard the Cook says, &quot;No one else will have you, Mister Spica.&quot; So he pillages those in his own restaurant. When his long-suffering wife rebels and has an affair with a bookish man, and Spica takes his revenge on her, he then gets what he deserves and it's the most stomach-turning ending in a movie you will ever see (no wonder NC-17 was practically invented for Greenaway). But it is at once fitting, terrifying, and clever.

A thief (Michael Gambon as Albert Spica) and his wife, Georgina (Helen Mirren) with his toadies and gang members dine each night at the restaurant of the cook (Richard Bohringer). Spica is a monster; crude, loud and a bully with the table manners of a hog. The first scene in the movie is Spica, his gang and their women getting out of their cars in a dark, wet alleyway and preparing to enter the restaurant through the kitchen. But first they deal with a guy who owes Spica money. His gang brings Spica dog excrement on pieces of paper; Spica wipes the stuff all over the other guy's face and mouth. They strip him down while the women watch and Spica continues to smear him. He pokes at the cowering man on the ground with his cane, while others kick at him. Then he urinates on him...but chews out a toadie who was going to do the same because the toadie might offend the women. Spica's behavior doesn't get any better. Georgina Spica wears matyrdom like a cloak. Eating every night in the restaurant is a shy, book-loving man (Alan Howard) who ignores the uproar Albert and his gang create. He and Georgina see each other and he becomes her lover, making love everywhere in the restaurant that they can find where it's quiet, with the help of the cook. The thief finds out and deals with the lover. The wife takes her revenge with the complicity of the cook in a grotesque and appropriate way.Sounds simple enough, but this movie is a powerhouse. The look of the film, like so much of Greenaway's stuff, is lush and highly stylized. The rooms of the restaurant have their own colors and the costumes of the actors change colors as they move from room to room. The kitchen is huge and strange, with boiling kettles, hanging instruments and tables piled high with glassware and dishes; with geese being plucked in clouds of feathers; with fat, half-naked men stirring steaming sauce pans. A white-haired, retarded boy does simple tasks while singing in a counter-tenor.The movie, I think, seems to be about anger and retribution. Gambon is a powerful as Albert Spica, completely repellant, domineering and absolutely fascinating. Helen Mirren is superb, and one of the bravest actors around. Her humiliation at the hands of her husband just goes on and on. Her scenes of sexual escape with Alan Howard are hardly erotic, but they are explicit and strong.Greenaway has done a number of films. I think a lot of Prospero's Books (1991) and The Draughtsman's Contract (1982). He's a guy you have to get in the mood for, though.

265853,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,6301783026,colinwoodward,"[7, 16]","I wanted to watch this movie for a long time, ever since it came out in the early 90s, when I was too young to rent NC-17 movies. Now, I am older, and can rent whatever I want. Although controversial when it came out, The Cook, the Thief seems almost tame 15 years later. The sex is fairly mild compared to the love scenes in Basic Instinct or Monster's Ball. And the violence, though unsettling, is nowhere near as bloody as any given Quentin Tarantino movie. So, what was the big fuss all about? A movie such as Titus is much more depraved than this one is. What are we left with then? Albert, the thief of the title, and who is given far too much screen time, is one of the most repellant figures in any movie I've seen. He's like Tony Montana without the charm, if such a thing is imaginable. Albert is the worst type of animal: a brute who thinks he's cultured. He stomps and swears and bullies everyone around him like a ten year old on a playground. That such an unbalanced and erratic criminal, who is naturally given to making enemies, could live as long as he has, is amazing. I won't give away the ending, but someone in the movie eventualy stands up to Albert. But the payoff provides no uplift. It only adds to the film's nihilistic dread. The performances in the movie are fine. I suppose my biggest problem with the film is Greenway's ponderous directorial style. From a compositional standpoint, the film is repetitive, with most shots being centered, and there being few closeups. The set design is the film's most intriguing quality. But the scenes, shot against rich reds, still feels cold. Chillier than Kubrick at his chilliest. Almost all the film takes place at night in a cavernous-looking restaurant or just outside it. The rooms are as large as the rooms in Charles Foster Kane's mansion. The film looks like it was filmed in hell, the actors look thoroughly miserable throughout, and it is a trial watching events unfold. Only the lavatory of the restaurant has any brightness to it.

Lots of odd stuff in the films, much of it on the unpleasant side of kinky.  This film makes those films seem rather pedestrian.I guess even I might have walked out on this film, I certainly didn't sit through the whole thing at home.  Part of it's problem, for me, was that it had the feel of a filmed play.  If I wanted to see a play, I go to the theatre, when I want a movie, I want cinema.  But I sat through &#34;Auntie Mame&#34; and all of Rosalind Russell's campy over acting, so what really put me off was the cruelty.  People are cruel.  Women kept locked up for twenty years in Austria, and Ohio.  Mothers who drown their own children.  Men and women who make each other's lives miserable because it's the only emotion they get a rise from.  Do I really want to watch it on the screen?Apparently not.Then again, it depends on how it's done.  Tennessee Williams plays often have a shocking core of meanness, and or contaminating strains of mendacity within them.  Shakespeare was no sissy when it came to depicting humanity, either.  In fact, this film most directly reminds me of Hollywood's bizarre remake of the Bard's &#34;Titus&#34;, with Anthony Hopkins.  There though, the depraved behavior, and cruelty, are cloaked in the balm of Western Literature and oddly juxtaposed between the Classical Age and Italian Fascism.  I wince when I watch that one (as well as &#34;Brazil&#34; come to think of it) but it's still entertaining.  &#34;Cook-Thief-Wife And Her Lover&#34; was too disturbing without having any sense that anything was behind it.  If I want to be disturbed, all I have to do is go to work any given day of the week and one of the losers who have fallen from the planet into San Francisco will most happily oblige me, without my having to ask.I guess if you think rude waiters are entertaining, this may well be your cup of tea.

I did like it but more in retrospect that when I was watching it.  I like movies that spur long debate with wife when they are over and this movie consumed about two hours of debate, including rewinding to check scenes to settle differences of opinions about something or other. The movie has a great cast and Helen Mirren is awesome and even more special considering the movie was released many years ago.  Michael Gambon is superb as the nasty cockney gangster, he plays a vile character so well, he puts Michael Cain and Bob Hoskins (The Long Good Friday) to shame playing the character Albert in this movie.  This is not a good movie for a planned romantic evening in fact is it a romantic mood killer for both parties, despite the teasing title of the movie. No worries, we knew what we were getting into before we watched it having read several reviews beforehand - thank goodness, otherwise it would have spoiled the evening if romantic movie plans had been on the agenda.

265865,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6301783026,Jeffrey Leach,"[112, 125]","I went into Peter Greenaway's &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover&quot; with blinders on. I had absolutely no idea what to expect as the movie started, none whatsoever. I slightly suspected the director made &quot;art&quot; films due to a faint recollection of a discussion I saw on a bulletin board years ago, but that was all I could remember. Heck, I thought Uma Thurman was in this film for some reason! Obviously, this was my first experience with Greenaway, a director I have since learned is noted for creating disturbing films designed to upset audiences. I'll bet this masterpiece had arty types fleeing for the doors! Boy, I wish I'd seen this in an art house when it came out. I'm used to seeing films dealing with subject matter far worse than this one, but viewers who spend their time watching pictures about relationships and strolls through a park on a sunny day aren't. Yes, Greenaway's film deals with abhorrent themes expressed in undeniably grotesque forms. Yes, the picture has ugly scenes of violence. Yes, relationships of a decidedly revealing nature play a big part in the plot. What did you expect from a NC-17 rated picture? Don't worry-you can handle it. Actually, you'll probably be glad that you sat through it because this is a marvelous movie.&quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover&quot; starts on a particularly memorable note. Big time gangster and thief Albert Spica (Michael Gambon), his wife Georgina (Helen Mirren), and his entourage pull up to the back door of a fancy restaurant run by the fabulous French chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer), ready for a night of fine dining and obnoxious behavior. Spica is a notorious brute, a beefy, sadistic thug who enjoys tormenting everyone around him, especially his wife Georgina. Greenaway sets the tone immediately by having a pack of dogs snap and snarl outside the restaurant as Spica presides over the humiliation of an underling. The bad behavior continues inside as Spica and his miscreants throw food, insult the staff and fellow customers, and generally make fools out of themselves. Night after night, Spica and his band of dangerous ruffians return to the restaurant, tormenting Borst and his staff as the restaurant's business drains away. No one, it seems, wants to spend an evening eating next to a guy like Spica.One gentleman seems relatively unbothered by the ruckus a couple of tables over. Michael (Alan Howard), a scholarly looking librarian who always reads a book while he eats, simply ignores Spica's loud theatrics. When he makes eye contact with the gorgeous Georgina, however, sparks fly. Within minutes the two are in the bathroom madly pawing away at each other. The clandestine affair continues night after night, with both Michael and Georgina continually aware that Albert Spica or one of his goons could discover the tryst at any moment. Eventually, the staff of the restaurant plays a part in helping the two lovebirds meet, allowing them to use the nooks and crannies in the cavernous kitchen and deflecting any suspicions posed by Albert. Georgina uses Michael as a respite from her vicious husband, a chance to escape his obnoxious behaviors if even for a few precious minutes. Spica's wife soon finds the strength to flee from Albert, moving in with Michael in his library. The thuggish Albert flies into a rage over his wife's disappearance. It's not that he cares for her in any way (he definitely doesn't), but his massive ego cannot stand the idea of her being with another man. Spica tracks down Michael and has him murdered by stuffing pages from a book about the French Revolution down his throat. The conclusion to the film is one of the most memorable in recent film history.After I watched Greenaway's film, I looked a few things up. Some bright film critics in England see this picture as a critique of the Thatcher years, with Spica standing in for the right wing, Georgina as England, and her lover as the hapless political left. Maybe, but I didn't see any of that in the film. I spent too much time chuckling over the coarse behavior of Spica and his goons-one played by Tim Roth in an early role, by the way-and enjoying the stunning Helen Mirren. She's so beautiful here that your heart aches over the indignities she suffers at the hands of Albert. She's also not afraid to do some daring scenes, a lesson she probably learned from her role in the Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione classic &quot;Caligula,&quot; made some ten years before this film. If you still need to a reason to watch the movie, if the political symbolism and charged situations leave you cold, check out the great musical score by Michael Nyman and the sumptuous atmosphere of the restaurant. The colors and d&eacute;cor of the dining establishment take your breath away, and Greenaway further uses color by having people's outfits change hue as they walk from room to room. What does it all mean? Who knows, but it's fun to watch.The DVD version of the film I saw didn't have much in the way of extras besides a trailer and a widescreen picture transfer. No matter, though. The movie is challenging enough to make you forget all about commentaries, stills, and any other of the usual extras. After watching &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover,&quot; I would like to see other Peter Greenaway films. Unfortunately, most of them have not received a reissue on DVD. If the subject matter is as disturbing as this film, no wonder! I recommend renting this movie and then inviting some friends over to watch it. Don't tell them anything about it beforehand, though. Just sit back and watch the jaws drop.",5,Oh my goodness!,1087257600,"06 15, 2004",2004,5650,"['went', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'quot', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Her', 'Lover', 'quot', 'blinders', 'had',

Reynolds,"[11, 19]","This is an excellent film to watch as a group if you're in a cooking club, perhaps a neighborhood ladies' or small church organization that enjoys great food, great food ideas and plenty of jovial comraderie.  This documentary examines life behind the scenes in a typical upscale restaurant, in the fashion of an extended Food Channel show, with a variety of glimpses at the preparation and clean-up process for numerous dishes and entres.  The film showcases excellent discussions around the use of gas, the over-use of mushrooms, the effects of smoking upon taste, finger and utensile etiquette, novelty foods (e.g. prairie oysters), the employment of refrigerated vehicles for food transport, how to deal in a genteel fashion with accidental regurgitation at the table, and standards for culinary discourse along with behaviorial propriety in a formal dining setting.  As with all effective documentaries, this one occasionally departs from the primary subject by offering delightful peeks at the fascinating lives of the principals -- the singing kitchen boy, the nightly patron who reads during every meal, some quick mischief in the restroom, and several side-splitting instances of good old rollicking frivolity in the parking lot out back.  Elderly ladies will find this film particularly appealing, as will anyone who really appreciates watching an exemplary old married couple enjoying a good meal together.  The husband's enthusiasm for life, lust and great food is infectious, and his wife's beauty totally stunning.  Additionally, the scenery is fantastic, the color schemes and lighting absolutely remarkable, and you might be inspired to copy much of the decor in your own home.

I didn't think I would like it at all, but it is one  of the best offbeat films I have ever watched.  Helen Mirren is superb as  the down trodden wife of a vicious gangster played to perfection by Michael  Gambon.  Set in a restaurant we are treated to a visual feast of decadence  galore as each night Gambon and his cohorts meet in the same restaurant to  enjoy the culinary delights of Richard Bohringer who plays the restaurant's  cook.  It's not long before Helen Mirren finds comfort in the arms of a  fellow diner, and their first encounter is in the ladies toilet where they  succumb to their passion.  It's not long before they enjoying more than  just the food in the restaurant each night, and the Cook and his staff  discreetly ignore their illicit meetings.  However the deception cannot  last and Gambon finds out that his wife is being unfaithful and extracts a  horrific revenge on Helen's lover.  But Helen has found in herself a  strength she never knew she had and with the aid of the Cook, she organizes  a counter revenge that is shockingly outrageous but totally appropriate.  Peter Greenaway has created a masterpiece in &quot;The Cook, the Thief, his  Wife and her Lover,&quot; it is visually stunning, utterly grotesque,  totally disgusting in parts and so outrageous it is no wonder that people  walked out of the cinema before the film had ended.

265872,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6301783026,K. Driscoll,"[7, 8]","The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover is probably the film most associated with the name of director Peter Greenaway.  That's unfortunate because Greenaway has created far better films.  This one is notoriously subversive, disturbing, and strange.  I would like to say profound too, but unlike many of Greenaway's other films, I can't find much of a message in this movie.  So my beef with The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover is not its content but its overall lack of purpose.  It seems a bit weird to me that this movie is in such high demand for a DVD re-release when I've yet to see much demand for great Greenaway films likeProspero's Books,Drowning By Numbers, orBaby of Macon. I guess this film caught some kind of sub-cultural fire and is now considered by many to be a rare classic.  It's rare for sure, but just because it has poop, nudity, and cannibalism, combined with great photography, does not necessarily make it a classic.Albert Spica (Michael Gambon), the thief, and his wife, Georgina (Helen  Mirren) go to a restaurant Spica has just taken over.  A man there named Michael (Alan Howard) soon begins an affair with Georgina.  The two have their affair with the help of the restaurant staff, lead by French chef Richard (Richard Bohringer), the cook.  After Albert begins to figure things out some truly disturbing things take place.  Other actors worth mentioning are Tim Roth and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, who play some of Spica's thugs.There doesn't seem to be any way to justify this film's message overall.  It does have a strong performance from Gambon, who delivers far more dialogue than anyone else in the film.  It also has some very creative artistic direction, cinematography, and set design that helps control the mood Greenaway may have been searching for.  It even has some truly humorous moments.  Still, maybe I'm missing something but this feels like a failure.

There is always a vocal minority who are most passionate about a given subject and extol on it's perceived virtues. The reviews for this movie reflect this. I don't know why those folks were so smitten by this film.The visual curiosity of having different hued settings was clever enough but lost it's appeal as the movie dragged on. The inevitable isolation and demise of the villain was predictable and formulaic. The story offered no novel insights or revelations about human debauchery. The heroine was rather unsympathetic and vacuous, the lover shallow and the cook was merely another background set piece.There are many who might object to the content and consider it base and vulgar, though I take no issue with that. I have no problem with artistic expression in all of it's forms. My primary critique is the pervading since of arrogance on the part of the director who presumes this to be a work of genius.

I know several people who have pretty eclectic tastes when it comes to independent directors and film makers but they draw the line when it comes to Greenaway's often dark, depressing movies.For one thing, men often get the short end of the stick when the women finally take their revenge for the abuses in their romantic relationships, as in the three husbands who are drowned by their disaffected wives in Drowning by Numbers, the arrogant draughtsman who finally gets his comeuppance in The Draughtman's Contract, the father of the female protagonist in The Pillow Book who is being sexually exploited by his gay boss, and the lover in this movie who also meets his end when the thief learns of his dalliances with his wife. There are still a couple of Greenaway films I haven't seen yet, so I can't say they're all like this , but so far themes such as the power of women and the power of sex over men, which often leads them to their final judgment and premature demise, seems to be a common theme.This movie is no different and besides the dangers of illicit sexual liaisons, this film features other dark themes such as the good man dying while the evil man (the thief) continues to prosper,  the general amorality of many of the characters, the grimy back alleys and poverty that lurks just outside the doors of the upscale restaurant and establishment where the main characters all have dinner, and even cannibalism. Despite Greenaway's movies many dark themes he has the ability to produce beautiful and vivid and striking images too that will stay with you a long time, whether his overall filmic vision appeals to you or not. If there is a more unusual director out there or anyone whose creative vision is as unique as Greenaway's I don't know who it is.",5,Another unusual film from Greenaway,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,1998,"['just', 'had', 'few', 'comments', 'unusual', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'something', 'fan', 'Greenaway', 'movies', 'are', 'filled', 'mature', 'dark', 'even', 'perverse', 'themes', 'are', 'controversial', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'many', 'people', 'favorites', 'know', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'pretty', 'eclectic', 'tastes', 'when', 'independent', 'directors', 'film', 'makers', 'draw', 'line', 'when', 'Greenaway', 'often', 'dark', 'depressing', 'one', 'thing', 'men', 'often', 'get', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'when', 'women', 'finally', 'take', 'revenge', 'abuses', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'three', 'husbands', 'who', 'are', 'drowned', 'disaffected', 'wives', 'Drowning', 'Numbers', 'arrogant', 'draughtsman', 'who', 'finally', 'comeuppance', 'Draughtman', 'Contract', 'father', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'who', 'being', 'sexually', 'exploited', 'gay', 'boss', 'lover', 'movie', 'who', 'also', 'end', 'when', 'thief', 'learns', 'dalliances', 'wife', 'are', 'still', 'couple', 'Greenaway', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'re"", 'so', 'far', 'themes', 'such', 'power', 'women', 'power', 'sex', 'men', 'often', 'final', 'judgment', 'premature', 'demise', 'be', 'common', 'theme.This', 'movie', 'different', 'dangers', 'illicit', 'sexual', 'liaisons', 'film', 'other', 'dark', 'themes', 'such', 'good', 'man', 'dying', 'evil', 'man', 'thief', 'prosper', 'general', 'amorality', 'many', 'characters', 'grimy', 'back', 'alleys', 'poverty', 'just', 'doors', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'establishment', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'dinner', 'even', 'cannibalism', 'Greenaway', 'movies', 'many', 'dark', 'themes', 'ability', 'produce', 'beautiful', 'vivid', 'striking', 'images', 'too', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'overall', 'filmic', 'vision', 'appeals', 'not', 'more', 'unusual', 'director', 'there', 'anyone', 'creative', 'vision', 'as', 'unique', 'Greenaway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who']",N/A

""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[4, 5]","When I perused the previous reviews of this movie it became apparent to me that people think the movie is very bizarre and love it or they think it's very bizarre and hate it. There doesn't seem to be much indifference when it comes to &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover&quot;.&quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover&quot; was written and directed by Peter Greenaway. Most of the film is set in an splendid epicurean restaurant called &quot;Le Hollandais&quot; which is owned by the Thief, Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) the uncouth, vulgar restaurant's owner. Albert a brutal criminal holds court every evening at the restaurant, along with his attractive wife Georgina (Helen Mirren) and various obsequious subordinates where he foists his convoluted views and questionable wisdom upon his captive audience. Even though Albert is the restaurant's owner his presence is tolerated and endured by the staff, including the Cook/Chef Richard (French actor Richard Bohringer). In short, Albert is a man easy to hate and impossible to like.One evening while Albert is giving one of his boring discourses, often berating his guests, the apparently subservient Georgiana observes a moderately good looking gentleman reading a book while dining. She finds this studious man interesting, the antithesis of her vulgar, mean, loutish husband. After catching his attention and visually flirting back and forth for a few minutes, they meet each other in the hall to the restrooms, eventually enjoying a sexual liaison in a stall in the Ladies Room.And so Georgina takes Michael (Alan Howard) as her lover, in an extremely dangerous love affair, having sex in various places, with the help of the Cook, within the confines of the restaurant, under the nose of her husband. Her obnoxious husband, who's no fool, becomes suspicious and eventually finding he's been made a cuckold is furious, stating publicly and categorically that he will kill Michael and eat him.I will leave the rest of the movie to your imagination.CONCLUSIONThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover is a movie of dichotomies. On one hand we have elegance and beauty, on the other there is vulgarity and ugliness. There is tenderness offset by brutality, boorishness in the face of proper etiquette, affection and sadism and above all, we have eroticism. I suppose Greenaway may have been trying to recreate a microcosm of life itself for, upon reflection, that is how I view it.This is not a movie for the timid. Though not pornographic, it is sexually exploitive and mentally engaging, capturing ones imagination though not to the point of stimulating ones libido. None under the age of seventeen should watch this movie since there is much nudity including full frontal, but the the love scenes are handled delicately and tastefully. There are other reasons for not allowing younger viewers as well, since there is violence and a rather bizarre unnatural ending.I can understand how some might find this distasteful or even abhorrent but I, who sometimes gravitate to the unusual, found the movie appealing and intriguing. Furthermore it was not just the cast (excellent), the storyline (wild) and the acting (wonderful) that fascinated me. The colorful surreal set was lovely and the method of cinematography, where the colors of the characters clothing would change from entering the kitchen form the dining room and vice versa, was extremely interesting.This is a movie that is memorable and worth seeing if you think you can handle it after my warning.",5,A Bizarre Trip in Erotica,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,3544,"['When', 'perused', 'previous', 'reviews', 'movie', 'became', 'apparent', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'bizarre', 'love', 'think', 'very', 'bizarre', 'hate', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'indifference', 'when', 'quot', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Her', 'Lover', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Her', 'Lover', 'quot', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Most', 'film', 'set', 'splendid', 'epicurean', 'restaurant', 'called', 'quot', 'Le', 'Hollandais', 'quot', 'owned', 'Thief', 'Albert', 'Spica', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'uncouth', 'vulgar', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Albert', 'brutal', 'criminal', 'court', 'evening', 'restaurant', 'attractive', 'wife', 'Georgina', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'various', 'obsequious', 'subordinates', 'where', 'convoluted', 'views', 'questionable', 'wisdom', 'captive', 'audience', 'Even', 'Albert', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'presence', 'tolerated', 'endured', 'staff', 'including', 'Cook/Chef', 'Richard', 'French', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Bohringer', 'short', 'Albert', 'man', 'easy', 'hate', 'impossible', 'like.One', 'evening', 'Albert', 'giving', 'one', 'boring', 'discourses', 'often', 'berating', 'guests', 'apparently', 'subservient', 'Georgiana', 'moderately', 'good', 'looking', 'gentleman', 'reading', 'book', 'dining', 'studious', 'man', 'interesting', 'antithesis', 'vulgar', 'mean', 'loutish', 'husband', 'catching', 'attention', 'visually', 'flirting', 'back', 'forth', 'few', 'minutes', 'meet', 'other', 'hall', 'restrooms', 'eventually', 'enjoying', 'sexual', 'liaison', 'stall', 'Ladies', 'Room.And', 'Georgina', 'Michael', 'Alan', 'Howard', 'lover', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'love', 'affair', 'having', 'sex', 'various', 'places', 'help', 'Cook', 'confines', 'restaurant', 'nose', 'husband', 'obnoxious', 'husband', 'who', 'fool', 'suspicious', 'eventually', 'finding', 'been', 'made', 'cuckold', 'furious', 'stating', 'publicly', 'categorically', 'will', 'kill', 'Michael', 'eat', 'him.I', 'will', 'leave', 'rest', 'movie', 'imagination.CONCLUSIONThe', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Lover', 'movie', 'dichotomies', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'elegance', 'beauty', 'other', 'vulgarity', 'ugliness', 'tenderness', 'offset', 'brutality', 'boorishness', 'face', 'proper', 'etiquette', 'affection', 'sadism', 'all', 'have', 'eroticism', 'suppose', 'Greenaway', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'recreate', 'microcosm', 'life', 'reflection', 'how', 'view', 'it.This', 'not', 'movie', 'timid', 'not', 'pornographic', 'sexually', 'exploitive', 'mentally', 'engaging', 'capturing', 'ones', 'imagination', 'not', 'point', 'stimulating', 'ones', 'libido', 'None', 'age', 'seventeen', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'much', 'nudity', 'including', 'full', 'frontal', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'delicately', 'tastefully', 'are', 'other', 'reasons', 'not', 'allowing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'well', 'violence', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'unnatural', 'ending.I', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'might', 'find', 'distasteful', 'even', 'abhorrent', 'who', 'sometimes', 'gravitate', 'unusual', 'found', 'movie', 'appealing', 'intriguing', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'cast', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'wild', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'fascinated', 'colorful', 'surreal', 'set', 'was', 'lovely', 'method', 'cinematography', 'where', 'colors', 'characters', 'clothing', 'would', 'change', 'entering', 'kitchen', 'form', 'dining', 'room', 'vice', 'versa', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting.This', 'movie', 'memorable', 'worth', 'seeing', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'warning']",N/A

One day I'm sure clothing will possess this property and we'll all be constantly changing but here done as an entire set it is revolutionary.An unhappy woman, trapped in a brutal marriage to a beastial man isn't new ground but what is new is how the story unfolds.

The story is compelling, the actors are superb, the cinematography is stunning (especially the long moving horizontal shots), the soundtrack music is quite appropriate and kind of spooky, and the director's vision, disturbing as it may be, is skillfully focused. The story leads up to an inevitable climax.Do we enjoy seeing people being urinated on and smeared with feces? Of course not, but those scenes are quite brief, and they set up the audience's hatred for the antagonist, who certainly receives his due in the climax of the film.The oft-mentioned metaphor about Thatcherism and its effect on small business owners in Great Britain is quite accurate. Thatcher (much like Reagan) was anti-union and pro big business, allowing big, monopolistic corporations to take power and squash the little guy.In the film, the male protagonist dies with pages from the book about the French Revolution stuffed down his throat. Isn't it obvious that this director is making a political statement?Yes, this film is disgusting---but the systematic destruction of the middle class by greedy, exploitative corporate entities is even more disgusting.I think it's a great film. Even if you don't grasp its political message, it's still an engaging story.

It is a film so drenched in gothic red colors, Jacobian theatrics, and wonderful performances, that one can't be surprised Greenaway had as much influence from 16th century tragedies as he did from filmmakers such as Michael Powell  and Emeric Pressburger.Set at the eloquent but menacing restaurant ""La Hollandaise"", CTWL follows a week in the life of hapless wife (Mirren) who is constantly abused verbally and physically  by the Immense terror that is her husband Albert Spica (Michael Gambon). And what an immense terror he is! From the very first scene we realize we are no longer in PG land as Spica humiliates a man by covering him in dog feces and then spending the rest of the night gallavanting at the highest level of obnoxiousness with his slimy henchmen. Mirren, miserable as anyone could imagine, finds a fresh romance in a local patron at the restaurant: Michael (Alan Howard). We, the audience, want the relationship to work, but the menacing undertones of the cinematography hint towards a much darker fate.There are several qualities that make CTWL a film worth owning. One being the acting: Michael Gambon's performance here is one of legendary status. After watching this film, it amazes me that I have never seen Albert Spica on any ""Top Villains lists"". From the very first scene we just want to see him dead. My love for Helen Mirren was confirmed with her performance as Georgina. I had seen and loved her in O'Lucky Man, The Queen, and Caligula (I know, I know) but the minute she muttered that famous bad a-- last line I was just googly eyed. The cinematography is also to be adored. It's as if Edgar Allen Poe became a Set designer.  Loads of black, mixed with red and plenty of shots that show exquisite depth. The allusions to the Thatcher adminstration that are said to be seen in the plot completly flew over my head, but then again I'm no expert on English Politics.Due to its infamous climax and candid use of nudity, CTWL has repeatedly been named one of the most shocking films of its era. And while I found the nude-rotten meat truck scene to be quite unsettling I found this film to be a beautiful tribute to old tradgedies such as ""Tidus Andronicus"" and ""The White Devil"". And although Spica alone is quite appalling, the film didn't quite reach the stomach-churning heights of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Salo"" (That is not a bad thing).

265898,A3M2WW0PO34B94,6301783026,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[22, 24]","""Bon soir. Welcome to Le Hollandaise. You have a reservation? Many reservations? We are the best restaurant in all of London. It is not necessary to worry about eating at Le Hollandaise. Let me show you to your table. This way, please. Ignore the buffoon at that table.""Le Hollandaise is the fictional restaurant setting for Peter Greenaway's controversial 1989 film ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"". It was my first exposure to the work of Peter Greenaway and I fell in love. ""Cook"" is also Greenaway's most well known, most controversial and, therefore, financially successful film. After watching the film, watching many people walk out, I sought out Greenaway's earlier works and have been a faithful follower of his new films.The Cook (Richard Bohringer) is the owner of Le Hollandaise, a grand, snooty restaurant serving the elite of London's upper class. He has a reputation for creating the most wonderful dishes. The Thief (Michael Gambon) makes himself a partner of the restaurant, forcing his favors upon the Cook and holding court in the restaurant every evening. His boorish manners and atrocious attitude towards everyone begins to have an effect on The Wife (Helen Mirren). Georgina can't stand her abusive, stupid, loud husband. One evening, she spots The Lover (Alan Howard) sitting alone at another table, his face buried in a book. He looks up. Soon, he follows her into the ladies room and they begin their affair under the nose of her husband. Each night, they become closer but also come closer to getting caught. The Cook soon aids in their liaisons.In any Greenaway film, the most important aspect of the film is the design. This is closely followed by some sort of system and the story and subject matter closely follow that.The DesignGreenaway is a rare filmmaker. Like Spielberg, Scorcese and Soderbergh, he is obviously very passionate about his films, a passion evident in the skill and craftsmanship involved in making his films. Greenaway started out as a painter and this is an important thing to know. It informs his work considerably, much like we are aware of Scorcese's Italian heritage when watching a classic like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Raging Bull"", or Spielberg's early attempts at making science fiction films when we watch a classic like ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  When you learn that Greenaway is a painter, his film compositions become all the more interesting and complex. Each frame is meticulously composed; every detail worked out to the smallest piece of fabric. You will not see a film that looks like ""Cook"" again in your life. Greenaway has worked with the same cinematographer on a number of films. He and Sacha Vierny have created a rich body of work that is a sumptious treat for the eyes. Each of the frames of ""Cook"" seem to pay tribute to Dutch painters like Vermeer and Rembrandt. Our viewpoint is usually from a distance, creating the impression we are looking at a living painting. The film takes place in the large rooms of the restaurant, with a couple of brief, very memorable trips outside and to one other location, each of the rooms lit as they might be for a painting from the 16th Century. The architectural design and cinematography of ""Cook"" stands as a testament to film design.ColorEach room not only has its own look, but its own feel as well, complemented by the design of the interior. The kitchen is functional, busy, and perhaps not completely clean. The dining room is grand, pretentious and obviously very expensive. The bathrooms are functional yet large as well. Each room of the restaurant is bathed in a particular color. The main dining room is filled with luxurious red velvet and red draperies and table clothes. The bathrooms are bright white. The kitchen is bathed in green. The predominant color of each room not only dazzles the viewer visually, but also serves to help create different feelings for the scenes. Georgina and Michael carry on their affair in each room of the restaurant and each of their trysts is different due to the functionality of the room.The Good BitsIn preparation for this opinion, I watched the film again, to refresh it in my mind. I remembered that each of the character's costumes changed each night they visited the restaurant. Georgina wears a number of outfits that are always predominately black, but they always features a scarf or swath of fabric over the shoulder. Albert, the thief, usually wears a cumberband or sash. As they move from one room to the next, these accessories change color as well, reflecting the hue of the environment. I remembered that this particularly struck me. It seemed very dramatic, almost operatic. Watching it again, I realized that not every character is affected in this way. As the main characters move from one room to the next, the camera passes behind a wall, much like a live television broadcast from the 50s, before entering the next room. The camera passing behind the wall hides the editing involved and the characters enter the new room in the same clothes, but with different color accents. The costumes, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier are as interesting as the design of the rooms. Georgina's clothes become increasingly S & M inspired. Albert's clothes become noticeably gaudier. These elements add so much to the feeling and mood of the film.GeneralizationsEvery Greenaway film I have seen has some sort of system at the basis of it. ""The Pillow Book"" was fascinated with Japanese calligraphy and this becomes a significant part of the story and design as the main character begins to write on her lover's body. ""Drowning By Numbers"" hides an ascending series of numbers in the visual composition as three generations of women in the same family all deal with philandering husbands. ""The Belly Of An Architect"" tells the story of an American architect building a structure in Rome that is much more complicated than he can handle. The film presents increasingly elaborate architectural designs between each scene. Greenaway's first feature ""The Draughtsman's Contract"" follows the adventures of an 18th Century draughtsman as he completes a commission to draw the estate of a wealthy woman. The progression of the drawings and the clues within provide a loose framework for the story. The systematic element of the story is one of the things that I always look forward to. The puzzle always adds something extra to watch and look for.In ""Cook"", the characters go to the restaurant every night for a week. During each visit, the thief becomes more obnoxious, deplorable and despicable. Georgina becomes more desperate for love. The cook becomes more anxious to get rid of his unwanted partner. Each segment is introduced by a menu announcing the Specialities Du Jour, surrounded by the food specials of the evening. The menu is very elegant, pretentious and fitting for such a restaurant. The food surrounding the menu has a connection to one of the elements in the story. On, no, I will not, can not reveal that.Greenaway's films address the issue of class. Characters are entrenched in the middle class, desperate to achieve riches, a place in society, comfort. Their actions prompt the main action within the story. In ""Cook"", the obnoxious, boorish thief is desperate to look presentable and become a member of the upper class. How does he do this? He forces his way into the restaurant and continues his underworld dealings to give him the means for a fancy lifestyle. Greenaway uses the thief as a model for most people in the upper class. He tells us that anyone in this class is really a derivation of Albert, a derivation of a thief.The Naughty BitsGreenaway's films enjoy a loyal following in the United States. His films have never achieved what anyone would call financial success; one recent film was not even released in the United States. Part of the reason for this is the subject matter of his films, and the reason I have chosen this film for my write-off. Every one of his films deals with people that are not in love, but need love and therefore take it. In ""Cook"", Albert does not love Georgina and she certainly doesn't love him, but she feels trapped and doesn't know where to go or what to do. When she finally finds love, Albert soon learns of it and puts a stop to it. Robbed of her last chance for true love, she takes revenge, releasing her nightmares. ""Pillow Book"", ""The Draughtsman's Contract"", ""8  Women"" all have main characters that are similar. They all have needs, needs that must be, will be fulfilled, no matter what the cost. If these characters were able to love and be loved the films and stories wouldn't exist. It is their perversions that make the films real, watchable and interesting. When Greenaway makes a film that works successfully with these notions, they become memorable. When he is off his game, they don't work; we don't feel sympathy for the characters. ""Cook"" works because we can feel sympathy for Georgina and Michael. We can even feel sympathy for Albert. He is such an atrocious human being that we can imagine the horrible childhood that created him.In one review I read about ""Cook"", the writer noted that they felt Greenaway let Albert off the hook too easily. Without revealing a lot of the climax, I don't agree. I felt that he let Georgina escape from her personal hell in a quick, expedient way.More Naughty Bits""Cook"" was controversial because it has a lot of elements that are uncommon in American films. Two very natural looking humans appear nude often, before and during their romantic encounters. Helen Mirren has a voluptuous body type, another element that draws parallels to Dutch paintings and Alan Howard is also not a svelte male super model. Their encounters are truly erotic, interesting and much more arousing than most `love scenes' in American films. This alone would send shock waves through just about every religious watchdog group. Greenaway also includes some fairly graphic violence, prompting a lot of controversy and much of the revenue the film generated. I find it ironic that the MPAA will give a film about a serial killer who engages in explicit sexual intercourse before killing his victims as the camera agonizes over the death `R' ratings, but if the film depicts intercourse between two loving people and happens to include some violence, it can't receive a rating. In 1989, ""Cook"" was released as Unrated. When it finally hit video stores, two versions were available, the Unrated letterboxed version and a chopped up `R' rated version. Blockbuster would only carry the `R' rated version, which is about 30 minutes shorter than the Unrated version. Did these people see the same film? No.The violence in ""Cook"" is fairly graphic. There are also some elements of a very unconventional nature in the climax that might be unsettling for some people. These elements only serve to strengthen the overall story, shocking the viewer, making us realize how far this affair has gone on.And As You Leave The Theater""Cook"" is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen. If video is your preferred method, please, please, please search out a copy of the uncut letterboxed version. With almost 30 minutes cut out, there is no way the `R' rated version can approximate the experience. The tape is out of print, so a newer video store may not have it. ""Cook"" is also a film more than worthy of a deluxe DVD edition, yet still hasn't been released on DVD.""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" is one of the most visually spectacular films I have ever seen. After watching it the first time, I imagined a play, a painting and an opera all combined into one film. It was, and remains, a shocking experience that I will remember for a long time.",5,Greenaway's Best,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,11746,"['Bon', 'soir', 'Welcome', 'Le', 'Hollandaise', 'have',

I felt physically ill as I left the theatre.  Months later, after still reading rave reviews, I gave it a second chance (on video for $1).  It was beautiful, overwhelming, multi-layered, sexy, shocking, tragic, and even funny.  If you steel yourself for this experience, you can enjoy it for what it truly is: a Master film-maker, working with a masterful group of actors (led by the exquisite Helen Mirren, who is flawless and Michael Gambon, who is terrifying), wearing unmistakeable costumes by Gaultier, feauturing music by an amazing composer (Michael Nyman), all coming together beautifully to tell this beautifully lit and photographed tale of love, revenge, power, and tragedy.

Half an hour into the film I was already sick to death of Albert's manic ranting (which makes up fully 3/4 of the dialog)  Horrendous, repetitious musical score.  Ear-piercing soprano solos.

Instead, wait for a showing at a good art theater, or wait for a better DVD version. Greenaway's movie affects viewers by contrasting beauty and horror, but for the effect to work, the images must be crisp and perfectly rendered. This DVD does not preserve movie quality resolution and so the effect is lost. Apart from that, the movie itself is the most memorable I have ever seen. I first saw it in 1990 and remembered almost all of it before viewing it a second time last night.The production is flawless. Each cast member is matched perfectly to each part: a wry, clever, wise Cook (Bohringer), a violent, unpleasant, loud Thief (Gambon), a suffering quiet Wife (Mirren) and a discrete Lover (Howard). Look also for a young Tim Roth playing his usual delinquent role. The photography is carefully planned, right down to the red water melons with green rinds split open on the cutting table. All the kitchen shots look like masterful 19th century still life paintings. There are interesting visual tricks: the costumes change color as the characters move from the dining room (red) to the kitchen (green).But be warned, this is not a pleasant movie. The film begins and ends with two unmentionable scenes. The thief insults his wife throughout the movie and it's soon difficult not to cringe at the sight of him. There is spitting and graphic vomiting. Make sure you've eaten some time before seeing this.

There is one nasty scene with Tim Roth stuffing pages of a book down the lovers throat, but that's it!!!  The rest of the so called violence is actually comical.  One lady gets a fork stuck in her cheek when she tells the husband that his wife is cheating on him, and you can't help laughing.  A guy at the beginning gets roughed up a little and gets peed on, hysterical! Also, the nudity and the sex scenes are not that explicit.  Don't buy this or not buy this movie based on all that jazz.  This movie should be seen just for the cinematogrophy and the acting.  Everyone in this film was excellent and the way the director presents each location of each scene is awesome.  I'll give you an example.  The dinning room of the resturant is where most of the film takes place and I guess is where the dark underlining of the atmosphere is the most visual.  So to make it seem just that way, the director shows everyone and everything with a red overture.  The ladies room is the wife's getaway from her abusive husband and is bright white.  It is also where(at first)she goes to meet up with her lover.  Get it?  The dinning room is her hell and the ladies room is her heaven.  Brilliant. Just to make sure the audience understands this, the director throws it in your face.  When you first see the resturant, you see the wife wearing what seems to be a dark red dress in the dinning room.  Then she retreats to the ladies room. As she walks through the door of the restroom the dress turns from dark red to bright white. I still don't know what color the dress actually was.  There are so many undertones in this film that you really have to sit and watch it to understand them all.  Quick note-Ever since I have been surfing through movies on amazon and e-bay, I have come to realize there are a lot of great movies out there that are not mainstream and although they are little known films, they sometimes are better than the major motion pictures.  So expand your horizons and give these films a shot, you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is one of those films, and it is an all around great movie.  Oh, it lost one star only because the accents are really thick and sometimes difficult to understand.

It's a tale of sex, lust, food, gluttony, murder and revenge. The film opens with a vulgar scatological scene, when a man is smeared with excrement by 'The Thief', Albert Spica. Most of the film is set in an elegant gourmet restaurent called Le Hollandais. Spica dines at this restaurant frequently, along with his gorgeous wife Georgina (played by solemnly sexy Helen Mirren) and his group of coarse associates.Spica is a vulgarian, who growls his orders towards those around him. Georgina then becomes fixated with a customer in the restaurant (Alan Howard) and the two of them have a dangerous sexual affair there. Eventually, Spica discovers their liaison, and the film draws to its memorable and shocking conclusion, which is the ultimate retribution. Sumptuous to look like at and superbly performed. A must see.The DVD image is in widescreen 2.35:1 and it is a good transfer. It is well defined and the colours are splendid. The sound is in Dolby 2.0 and pretty good. Michael Nyman's excellent soundtrack uses the surround channel to good effect.
