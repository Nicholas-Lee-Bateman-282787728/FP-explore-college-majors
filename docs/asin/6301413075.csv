Few people, I gather, have seen this in any format since my review is only the second here at Amazon even though the movie was made over 30 years ago.It's not a great movie but it has a dream-like look and feel to it, which is why a good DVD transfer could give it justice. It's a nice, clean movie with no profanity or blood and an interesting story of the Wright Brothers struggling to build their first airplane and then keep their famous plans and ideas from being stolen by others. There is a lot of justified paranoia in here.Oddly, if I didn't know it was Michael Morarity, I would have thought this was some rookie actor who couldn't put any inflection into his lines, but maybe his ""Wilbur Wright"" character is supposed to be this ultra low-key. Nonetheless, Moriarty sounded very wooden, but now I am informed that's how Wilbur was, which I'm glad to hear since I like Moriarity.The movie also drags a bit here and there, but overall I am still glad I own the VHS because it's a really nice film and a worthy addition to any collection.",4,Nice Film!

252222,A1MAQHECJKA2OV,6301413075,Happy Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Possibly the most complete movie made about the Wright brothers.  I have 5 different DVDs claiming to cover this important American story. The Winds of Kitty Hawk hits all the marks, the history before them, their trials and tribulations along with proper mention of their mentors, sponsors and family's support.  Every one of these factors led to the first powered aircraft.  In true American spirit, Wilbur and Orville, after success eluded them and other contemporaries, had the audacity to question the existing engineering data.Each of these brothers had their individual strengths to bring to their common goal of manned flight sparked by reading a science periodical of their day.  How many young inventive minds have been launched by this chance method. How many parents have chuckled over their child's fascination over a periodical with a glossy cover.  Michael Moriarty portrays Wilbur's undaunted spirit  and David Huffman gives life to Orville's insightful intellect.  These men were true Americans and patriots of their time.",5,Finally a complete story!,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1039,"['Possibly', 'most', 'complete', 'movie', 'made', 'Wright', 'brothers', 'have', '5', 'different', 'DVDs', 'claiming', 'cover', 'important', 'American', 'story', 'Winds', 'Kitty', 'Hawk', 'marks', 'history', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'proper', 'mention', 'mentors', 'sponsors', 'family', 'support', 'one', 'factors', 'led', 'first', 'powered', 'aircraft', 'true', 'American', 'spirit', 'Wilbur', 'Orville', 'success', 'eluded', 'other', 'contemporaries', 'had', 'audacity', 'question', 'existing', 'engineering', 'data.Each', 'brothers', 'had', 'individual', 'strengths', 'bring', 'common', 'goal', 'manned', 'flight', 'sparked', 'reading', 'science', 'periodical', 'day', 'How', 'many', 'young', 'inventive', 'minds', 'have', 'been', 'launched', 'chance', 'method', 'How', 'many', 'parents', 'have', 'chuckled', 'over', 'child', 'fascination', 'periodical', 'glossy', 'cover', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'Wilbur', 'undaunted', 'spirit', 'David', 'Huffman', 'life', 'Orville', 'insightful', 'intellect', 'men', 'were', 'true', 'Americans', 'patriots', 'time']",The Winds of Kitty Hawk VHS
