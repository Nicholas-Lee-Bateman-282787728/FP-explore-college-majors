I laugh at the reviews from those who complain about plot holes, bad acting, and C. G. I. effects.  That's what a creature feature is.Carmen Electra spends most of her time flaunting her still flawless figure, or clinging to Charlie O' Connell who played her husband.  These 2 are in charge of an entire class of swimsuit clad, gorgeous, co-eds.

Its like an unrealistic version of &#34;JAWS&#34; - and I mean that in a good context. It has the basic story of a group teens trying to survive as a bloody monster picks them off one by one. I will concede a certain bias because I've become friends with one of the actors in this movie, Geoff Ward. He plays the character of Cole, the stereotypical jock, but in real life, Geoff is one of the nicest people I've had the pleasure of meeting - and he's incredibly funny!

Dennis Moore""","[2, 2]","One day on the outskirts of Hollywood one movie guy said to another movie guy, ""Let's make a killer shark movie.""Hollywood Guy #2 said, ""Like JAWS?""""No, no,"" Hollywood Guy #1 replied, ""this'll be set at sea, like a Semester at Sea kind of thing, full of pretty young people, girls in bikinis, guys with lots of muscles, it'll be lots of eye candy with this deadly shark on the attack.""Hollywood Guy #2 said, ""Like CROCODILE?""Hollywood Guy #1 said, ""No, see we don't have a party boat, we're gonna be on a yacht out on the high seas.  And they'll take refuge on this island, then find themselves trapped by the shark, because the boat needs repairs, see.""Hollywood Guy #2 said, ""Like BLOOD SURF?""Hollywood Guy #1 said, ""No, cuz, see, this shark, it's got TWO HEADS!""And so the word was sent down from on high in the studio, ""Make it so,"" and thus it was made so and it did star Charlie O'Connell and Carmen Electra and Brooke Hogan and it was produced by The Asylum, makers of fine low-budget shlock for over a decade.2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK is just one of those titles you can't help but pick up and give the DVD box a once-over.  And if the copy you've picked up is already used only a month or so after the movie's release, and you can get it for $3, it's only natural to buy it, right?  It's 2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK, after all.  What's not to love?Okay, so there's the script, the acting, the effects, the direction, the production, and basically everything else about you can possibly loathe about a movie.  All of these things are wrong with this movie, but it's called 2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK, for God's sake!  The female lead is Brooke Hogan.  Charlie O'Connell plays a professor.  We're not talking high cinema here.  I think the last time I saw a less-convincing learned doctor in a movie was Tara Reid in ALONE IN THE DARK, and I LIKE Charlie O'Connell.While The Asylum is best known for their mockumentary films--taking a well-known Hollywood film and making a comparable version on a smaller budget with less-famous stars (ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES, SNAKES ON A TRAIN, THE DA VINCI TREASURE), 2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK is a standalone movie and is not based on a pre-existing film.  Maybe that works to its advantage; when I see one of The Asylum's mockumentaries I can't help but compare it to the original, and in this case, with nothing to compare it to, I'm left to enjoy its awfulness based solely on its own personal failings.  And there are SO many of those.For example, (spoiler alert) the big climax comes when the final three students decide the best way to eliminate the shark is to blow it to bits using an old gasoline barrel they found on an atoll they've been taking shelter on.  Let's never mind the top of the barrel is obviously a piece of cardboard painted black, but the only fuse they can find is the shirt of one of the students.  The wet shirt.  Sure, go ahead, ring it out, that'll help the lighter start it burning.  It's only a wet, salt-water-soaked T-shirt, I can't understand why they're having such a hard time getting the fabric to light.  I mean, it's obviously a brilliant solution, right?On the bright side, the movie did hit some nostalgic notes with me in the CGI department.  I recall very fondly how much fun I had watching the Dire Straits ""Money for Nothing"" video back in the day.  Good times.With a $1 million budget and a cast of 23, that couldn't have left a whole lot over for things like special effects and re-shoots, so in the end, they probably had to go with what they had and hope it came together in the end to make a decent movie.  It didn't.  And I'm saying that as someone who likes crappy movies.  And even with a title like 2-HEADED SHARK ATTACK, expecting a certain level of cheese to come with that, I still was not prepared for just how bad this movie would be.  I got my copy for $3 and I still feel like I was robbed.

1505845,A3TYVNOIQZWTOA,B005ZI6NHG,Cerulean,"[3, 4]","I love terrible movies, so Asylum is, as you may well imagine, one of my favorite studios.  Anytime I pop in a movie and see ""The Asylum"" listed in the opening credits, I know I'm in for a treat.  That said, their movies tend to be rather average as far as terrible movies go.  Every once in a while they put out a real gem like their version of Sherlock Holmes or 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which really go above and beyond in the way that awesome terrible movies should, but for the most part you know exactly what you're getting into with one of these, and 2 Headed Shark Attack is no exception.  You go in expecting a terribly animated two headed shark eating its way through scantily clad co-eds whose acting skills are about on par with your local college's rendition of Macbeth.  And that is exactly what you get.  And it is just as awesome as you would expect.  If you think that sounds awesomely stupid, then you'll like the movie.  If you think it just sounds stupid, then you should probably stick to whatever hideous dramas you usually watch instead and leave the awesome two headed sharks who ride tidal waves across an island (excuse me, atoll) to those of us who appreciate things of such caliber.The plot of the movie involves a college class in something or other which is on a sea cruise (for educational purposes, of course!) with the stupidest professor who ever lived and his Carmen Electra.  I mean wife.  Anyway, they hit the most poorly animated dead mega-mouth shark that has ever existed, poke it with a long stick, and somehow make a hole in their hull, so they head for a nearby atoll.  Unbeknownst to them, the area is home to a two headed shark whose origins are never even guessed upon in the movie.  It just exists and no one questions it.  The professor suggests that they look around for... scrap metal... on an uninhabited tiny island.  Which goes about as well as you would expect.  Then the island starts collapsing into the sea for no reason while the shark eats everyone.  Did I mention that the island (sorry, atoll) is magical and constantly changes sizes and shapes depending on the angle they are filming at?  One second it is about the size of a shopping mall, and the next you see it in the background and it looks like the coast of Florida.  And then it sinks and later is back above water so it can sink several more times.  It is glorious.In short, who cares what the plot is.  The more ridiculous the better.  And this is certainly ridiculous.  All that you really need to know is that a bunch of hot girls who packed nothing but bikinis are stranded on a deserted island with a couple amazingly stupid roiding jocks (which makes for awesome dialog, by the way, such as one of them excitedly shouting ""Protein!"" when a giant squid washes up on shore) being hunted down by a giant two headed shark that roars like a lion.

I was a little worried when I saw Brooke Hogan in the cast list, but we're still talking about a bloodthirsty 2-headed shark on a rampage here (not to mention a gaggle of college girls in bikinis) - what could possibly go wrong?  I'll tell you what could go wrong and does go wrong in this movie - the entire cast is horrible.  You could have built a replica of the Trojan Horse from all of the wooden acting on display here.  And annoying!?  If I had to choose between getting eaten by a 2-headed shark and being shipwrecked with the characters in this movie, I would be giving ""suicide by shark"" some serious consideration.  Naturally, there are also all sorts of continuity errors, bad special effects, and giant plot holes, but what else would you expect from The Asylum?  Heck, it's part of their B-movie rip-off charm, if you ask me.So some kind of Podunk college offers some kind of Semester at Sea program, which leads to a bunch of scantily-clad college kids sunbathing, flirting, and goofing off onboard a boat while their professor futilely tries to teach them how to use a sextant.  I thought the professor looked like he should be Jerry O'Connell's stunt double (except he isn't a good enough actor to be a stunt double), and now I know why - it's Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie.  Professor Babish does have one thing going for him, though - he's married to Carmen Electra's character (she's apparently some kind of doctor, but she can barely wrap an injured leg and apparently did her residency at a tanning salon).  Both of them are useless when the ship hits something in the water and suffers a small but significant hull breach.  Luckily, the ship happens to be a short distance away from an atoll, so the professor and kids take a dingy to the island while the crew tries to repair the ship.  That's about the time our two-headed shark shows up to ruin everyone's day.  I won't even try to describe all the stupid shenanigans that go on the rest of the way.  Even if these people didn't needlessly put themselves in danger time and time again, they would only be safe for so long because the atoll they're on is quickly sinking into the sea (which I take as a sign that God hated these characters as much as I did).  Geoff Ward deserves special mention, as he makes a strong run at ""most annoying character ever"" as a brainless, muscle-bound punk whose arrogance is only rivaled by his cowardice.  Heck, Brooke Hogan plays the only character with half a brain in this entire movie.Two scenes stick out in my mind.  At one point, a certain adult character falls and skins his leg - and cries about it like a two-year-old who had her favorite doll stolen.  You would think this guy is dying a most painful death, when all he really needs is a Band-Aid.  None of the people actually being eaten by the shark carry on like this putz.  The other scene is classic, though, and pretty much stands as the saving grace of the entire film.  The two-headed shark flips this one dude up into the air with his tail, dives down, and then jumps up to double-chomp the guy before he lands back into the water.  I had to rewind and watch that scene over again - it almost makes up for all of the horrible CGI effects and stock footage shots of the shark.  Speaking of bad special effects, the filmmakers originally wanted to have the shark's second head growing out of its forehead.  Now, that would have really been stupid.I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this film.  Mutant monster movies starring B- and C-grade actors is supposed to be The Asylum's bread and butter, but they really let me down with this one.  2-Headed Shark Attack does feature more gore than I'm used to seeing from The Asylum, but that's about the only positive thing I can take with me from this movie.",3,"Should have been a slam dunk, but The Asylum barely manages to hit the rim with this one",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,3914,"['2-headed', 'shark', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Man', 'live', 'B-movies', 'one', 'nobody', 'better', 'Asylum', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'when', 'saw', 'Brooke', 'Hogan', 'cast', 'list', ""'re"", 'still', 'talking', 'bloodthirsty', '2-headed', 'shark', 'rampage', 'here', 'not', 'mention', 'gaggle', 'college', 'girls', 'bikinis', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'go', 'wrong', 'movie', 'entire', 'cast', 'horrible', 'could', 'have', 'built', 'replica', 'Trojan', 'Horse', 'wooden', 'acting', 'display', 'here', 'annoying', 'had', 'choose', 'getting', 'eaten', '2-headed', 'shark', 'being', 'shipwrecked', 'characters', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'suicide', 'shark', 'serious', 'consideration', 'Naturally', 'are', 'also', 'sorts', 'continuity', 'errors', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'giant', 'plot', 'holes', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Asylum', 'Heck', 'part', 'B-movie', 'rip-off', 'charm', 'ask', 'me.So', 'kind', 'Podunk', 'college', 'kind', 'Semester', 'Sea', 'program', 'bunch', 'scantily-clad', 'college', 'kids', 'sunbathing', 'flirting', 'goofing', 'off', 'onboard', 'boat', 'professor', 'futilely', 'teach', 'how', 'use', 'sextant', 'thought', 'professor', 'looked', 'should', 'be', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'stunt', 'double', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'be', 'stunt', 'double', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'brother', 'Charlie', 'Professor', 'Babish', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'though', 'married', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'character', 'apparently', 'kind', 'doctor', 'can', 'barely', 'wrap', 'injured', 'leg', 'apparently', 'did', 'residency', 'tanning', 'salon', 'are', 'useless', 'when', 'ship', 'something', 'water', 'small', 'significant', 'hull', 'breach', 'Luckily', 'ship', 'be', 'short', 'distance', 'away', 'atoll', 'professor', 'kids', 'take', 'dingy', 'island', 'crew', 'repair', 'ship', 'time', 'two-headed', 'shark', 'up', 'ruin', 'everyone', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'describe', 'stupid', 'shenanigans', 'go', 'rest', 'way', 'Even', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'needlessly', 'put', 'danger', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'safe', 'so', 'long', 'atoll', ""'re"", 'quickly', 'sinking', 'sea', 'take', 'sign', 'God', 'hated', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Geoff', 'Ward', 'special', 'mention', 'strong', 'run', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'ever', 'brainless', 'muscle-bound', 'punk', 'arrogance', 'only', 'rivaled', 'cowardice', 'Heck', 'Brooke', 'Hogan', 'only', 'character', 'brain', 'entire', 'movie.Two', 'scenes', 'stick', 'out', 'mind', 'one', 'point', 'certain', 'adult', 'character', 'falls', 'leg', 'cries', 'two-year-old', 'who', 'had', 'favorite', 'doll', 'stolen', 'would', 'think', 'guy', 'dying', 'most', 'painful', 'death', 'when', 'really', 'Band-Aid', 'None', 'people', 'actually', 'being', 'eaten', 'shark', 'carry', 'putz', 'other', 'scene', 'classic', 'though', 'pretty', 'much', 'stands', 'saving', 'grace', 'entire', 'film', 'two-headed', 'shark', 'one', 'dude', 'up', 'air', 'tail', 'down', 'then', 'up', 'double-chomp', 'guy', 'back', 'water', 'had', 'rewind', 'watch', 'scene', 'again', 'almost', 'up', 'horrible', 'CGI', 'effects', 'stock', 'footage', 'shots', 'shark', 'Speaking', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'filmmakers', 'originally', 'wanted', 'have', 'shark', 'second', 'head', 'growing', 'forehead', 'Now', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'stupid.I', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Mutant', 'monster', 'movies', 'starring', 'B-', 'C-grade', 'actors', 'supposed', 'be', 'Asylum', 'bread', 'butter', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'one', '2-Headed', 'Shark', 'Attack', 'feature', 'more', 'gore', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Asylum', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'take', 'movie']",N/A

He's loaded the film up with bikini babes, guys with washboard abs, stupid dialogue and, gloriously, copious gory 2-headed shark attacks. He even finds room for a lesbian nude scene, which he ends with the most memorable shark-kill in the film.""Sliders""-and-nothing-else star Charlie O'Connell is (yeah, he wishes) a college professor who is married to (yeah, he wishes) Carmen Electra, who is (yeah, she wishes) a doctor. The two take a bunch of sexy ninnies on a ""Semester at Sea"" field trip for some unspecified class, but all those hot coeds would rather (surprise, surprise) go skinny dipping instead.Helen Keller could see where this is going.The 2-headed shark appears out of nowhere (and indeed exists for no reason other than it's the film's titular star) and starts eating people who, conveniently enough, tend to fall into the water two at a time.After their boat stalls, the prof and his hapless crew find themselves beached on an atoll which looks like an abandoned Gilligan's Island and which is, preposterously, slowly sinking.Of course, it's no spoiler to reveal that all the ninnies get eaten, the two plucky outcasts win in the end, and that there are plot holes even a three-headed shark could easily swim through. One literal one involves a gigantic hole the group comes upon on the beach, wonders about for a little while, then moves on. What is it? I don't know. It's never seen or mentioned again. I'm gonna lose sleep over that one.Anyway, The Asylum's obviously spent more money on this movie than its previous DTV flicks, suggesting it's investing its earnings from its earlier cheapies in making slightly better films, which is a positive thing, to be sure. The shark effects are quite passable, much better than The Asylum's ""Mega Shark"" sillies, and the extra dough spent on location shooting and some good helicopter shots serve the film well. Even the sinking atoll effects are convincing, even if the reason it's sinking isn't.While ""2-headed Shark Attack"" succeeds well as a DTV b-movie time waster, its greatest success is that it's the Asylum's best example of el-cheapo movie making that exposes its big-budget brethren for the foolish films they are. Nationally released ""Shark Night"" is just as poorly made, but not nearly as fun as ""2-headed Shark Attack.""

1505859,A2UQF0BCL4I75O,B005ZI6NHG,POD JAWS,"[2, 3]","I have read so many mixed reviews about this but in the end, after all that waiting, I enjoyed it... it was a great, fun B Grade Movie and after seeing the great, and In my opinion scary/intense trailer for this epic looking movie I must say that this film although wasn't scary, was still a little over decent!Plot: twenty three college students (including their two professors played by Charlie O' Connell and Carmen Electra) are struck with their first sign of bad luck when they hit a rare mega mouth shark that soon gets caught on the propeller and jams their boat but that's not the end of it for as soon as they find land (an atoll) they soon find out that a birth defected 40-45 foot two headed shark is stalking, eating, and ripping apart theCo-eds and apparently is very hungry. If things couldn't get any worse the atoll is sinking due to the coral reef that supports the island being damaged! What more could go wrong?Review: Let me start off my review with saying that this movie has so many flaws that it isn't even funny! Like being able to hold a mega mouth shark that surely was at least 2000 pounds with a hook and not getting pulled into the ocean (as Charlie O' Connell was able to do) and saying that the only way they can send out their beacon is to scuttle (sink) the boat (as Charlie O' Connell says) as well as the radio antenna snapping off for the most impossible reason, peoples superb visuals (such as one of the characters screaming ""Civilization"" when they are over a mile away) and screaming ""There's no way out"" when there is an island right in behind them (well what is left of the island, but it's still better than nothing) etc. After all that I must say some positive things at least. The CGI, it was decent most of the time and downright cartoony the other few times. I was surprised by some of the deaths such as having people being torn to pieces which was quite graphic and I have never seen that in a Syfy channel original, let alone a Asylum movie. The acting was okay and it had a couple of good characters that actually were funny and had decent dialogue. The trailer was scary as all hell I think the thing that really got me was the fin coming at Brook Hogan but they quickly took away the suspense by getting rid of that atmosphere and suspenseful music and replacing it with cheesy nonsense! I hope they do make a sequel but with a bigger budget..., maybe it could be  a 3 HEADED SHARK called the Cerberus Shark or something as long as it's done right I'll watch it.... because Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus got a Sequel and that was immensely worse than this!Acting: Brook Hogan played a good role and she has a fear of sharks for the movie which is able to be overcome which I adore that idea because most of these kinds of movies have a story like hers and they forget about it and never bring it up again! Carmen Electra was also decent but when she sunbathed I was wondering if she was either getting a tan or posing for the camera. Charlie O' Connell was okay it looked like he put to much effort in it which is sometimes a good thing but in this situation, no, just no!Gore: People are ripped apart sometimes very graphically and sometimes very cheaply but I like the fact that they tried to make this movie as big and epic as they could and sometimes it paid off but other times it was a little ridiculous. one scene of gore that I was let down by though is when a character was bitten on the leg and then the shark let go and either they forgot the put the blood and missing leg effect in or the person was just caught in the gums but all in all it had pretty damn good special effects for a TV movie even if they used some of the same shots over and over and also one of the characters was put in as CGI while she was being attacked and over all it looked wicked cartoony for that scene!Bottom Line: Not what I was hopping for but it still delivered. It was obviously a cash in on Piranha 3D and Shark Night 3D but I do believe that this was better than Shark Night 3D. Piranha 3D however is still a great movie filled with idiots who make stupid decisions. This movie was pretty much the same but it was filled with idiotic morons and even stupider decisions which sometimes actually worked even when it was humanly or scientifically impossible.Official

1505861,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B005ZI6NHG,Robert I. Hedges,"[13, 16]","""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is the latest ridiculous sea monster flick from The Asylum. Before you can even get to the film there's an intro from The Asylum bragging how they have done over 100 of these cheesy disaster films so far, and the beauty is that if you've seen one you pretty much know what's going to happen in any of the others: just substitute ""two-headed shark"" for ""giant alligator,"" ""enormous squid,"" or ""subterranean volcano under a metropolis"" and you've got it. As the credits unwind to obnoxious college students on a speedboat, creature feature fans may feel the hairs on the back of their neck stand up when they see the director is Christopher Douglas-Olen Ray. With B-movie genetics like this you know it's going to be an entertaining movie for all the wrong reasons. Not that I fault Chris Ray, it's not like anyone was going to make a good movie called ""2-Headed Shark Attack"" or anything. You know what you're buying when you see the title.The opening starts the production off right. Two talented water skiers in bikinis are pulled behind a boat towed by three ogling guys taking their pictures. I therefore found it a bit incredulous that nobody in the boat noticed when a giant two-headed shark leapt from the water and neatly munched them down. Not that it matters. The real meat of the story, the chum as it were, starts when we meet Professor Babbish (Charlie O'Connell) who is taking his class of insufferable students on a ""semester at sea"" to learn...well, something. It starts off with a lesson in sextant use, but quickly turns to a sunbathing demonstration. They are on a typical Florida tourist boat...no I'm sorry, a ""US education vessel,"" the ""Sea King,"" sailing ""hundreds of miles from anywhere"" and immediately sustain shark damage via a curious scene that you may not find entirely plausible. In the process the shark damages their radio antenna (ponder) and they cannot communicate with anyone. The interesting point is that bonehead jock Cole (Geoff Ward) was scolded to turn his cell phone off not more than five minutes earlier. But never mind, they are really, really stuck at sea with a crippled boat. Just take our word for it.The dialogue is predictably ridiculous (""We're not sinking. We're taking on water."") Fortunately by an amazing coincidence a deserted island is right next to them. For some reason they decide to send the Professor and students ashore to look for scrap metal to repair the boat (really?) while Mrs. Anne Babbish (Carmen Electra, who is clearly here only because of her name and sundry assets, not because of any contribution to the plot whatsoever) is in charge of vessel repairs. She has two Spanish speaking deckhands who work hard and Laura (Morgan Thompson) the lovely welder to do the work. That's a good thing, because as senior officer onboard with her ship sinking what do you think she does? Well, obviously she changes into a bikini and soaks up some rays on deck. While all that's going on, the kids are getting into petulant arguments and exploring the island, and believe me they cannot get eaten fast enough for my taste. I hope that shark is famished.If the plot isn't enough to make you laugh out loud, the acting and terrible CGI will. I have some seen some awful shark movies, but this is one of the worst on a whole bunch of levels. The effects are utterly laughable, and among the least scary of any of The Asylum movies. (That's saying something.) I truly enjoy how the entire scale of the shark varies by orders of magnitude throughout the film. Bonus points for that. The backstory unspools in an even sillier way than you would expect: voluptuous, angst-laden, uptight blonde heroine Kate (Brooke Hogan, Hulk's daughter) enrolled in the semester at sea because she was spooked by a shark in the ocean when she was 12, and hasn't been in the water since then. This is not how normal human beings make decisions. As they explore the deserted island which has well-developed roads, infrastructure, and even a church, they discover two boats which prompts the line ""Hey guys do you think these will work?"" For what? What part of ""boat"" don't they understand? What was the point of going to the island again? Never mind. Fortunately Kate is an engineering-mechanic-welding savant and fixes the boats with the help of smart guy Paul (David Gallegos,) the only remotely likeable member of the cast, while idiot Cole almost kills himself with a spear.It sure was lucky they found this island, wasn't it? Oh, but wait! The shark is making the island have earthquakes and sink into the ocean! The first earthquake injures the Professor's leg to the point he needs to be ferried back to the ""Sea King"" (why did they ever leave again?) Fortunately they forget about this as he is able to run again within two hours. Assorted mayhem occurs with much CGI thrashing and foam teeth in attendance while idiotic canned interpersonal conflicts occur in abundance. Cole steals one boat for the cool kids, leaving Kate and Paul on the other. Oddly many of the students elect to stay on the sinking island as the boats race toward the ""Sea King."" This scene will have you praying for natural selection to work its wonders. Cole comes up with an ingenious plan to jump into the water and swim for the ""Sea King"" abandoning the boat's other occupants to the shark. Sadly Kate rescues Cole and when back in shallow water explains where their relationship stands in no uncertain terms.Because this is going nowhere everyone comes ashore, abandoning the ""Sea King."" (Oh, whatever.) While Cole emotes over the loss of his party buds, the Babbish clan comes up with a brilliant plan: sink the ""Sea King."" No, seriously. You mean that boat they just left floating over there? Yes. Apparently they believe that it would be safer than staying on the visibly sinking atoll, because that would trigger its EPIRB (they don't call it that) to summon help. Turns out you don't really have to do that, but for the plot to work that's the best idea they've got. Paul (the student who should be in charge because he's the only one who knows anything about the ocean, fish, or boats) comes up with an alternate plan: fix the ""Sea King."" Brilliant! There's an elaborate subplot about distracting the shark with an electric bridge (don't ask) while the Professor sends, of all people, archenemies Cole and Kate to fix the ""Sea King."" (Suspension of disbelief is key here, people.) A favorite moment is when Professor Babbish watches the shark and yells ""It's confused!"" For a moment I thought he was talking about the plot, but nope, just the fish. Kate starts welding to fix the amusingly fake ""hull damage"" while the shark gets tired of its electroshock therapy and destroys the bridge, freeing it up to do more important things. Like eating.Cole steals the ""Sea King"" as soon as the welding is complete, leaving Kate alone in the water. You'd have thought she was imperiled what with the giant mutant shark on the loose, but no, she just wades ashore. Suffice it to say that Cole doesn't get far, and the Professor's original plan is put into action, though this is lost on the cast for some reason. As the island sinks ever lower in the water, most people run inland, but two particularly dim coeds run to stand on the smallest, spindliest dock imaginable, then precariously perch on the very edge of said dock saying ""I think we're good."" What do you, the audience, think? Do you think huge two-headed sharks can leap clean over a dock? I won't tell.Because this in an Asylum movie, there's not quite enough going on yet, so what do you think could go wrong next? Volcano? Good guess, but wrong. Enormous altruistic intervening squid? Again, good guess, but no. How about this one: tidal wave. Sadly, it's true. As it strikes the island the Babbishes have one last kiss as they are engulfed simultaneously by the rogue wave and the central character of the film. To seek refuge from the shark the remaining kids seek refuge in a church, which the shark treats as a snack basket before getting hopelessly lost inside. (It's a small church, but sharks have small brains.) Paul even gets to beat it on the snout with a crucifix. I am so not joking. The film concludes with a wholly ridiculous plan and multiple acts of bravery, and Kate and Paul finally putting us out of our misery by climbing onto the rocks of the island and waiting for the rescue helicopter which promptly shows up as the credits start to some truly awful music.The DVD has a few extras, none of them good. There is a ""Gag Reel"" which consists of a couple of minutes of assorted clowning and bloopers. It may be the single lamest blooper reel I have ever seen. Don't waste your time. There are some trailers for this and other Asylum movies, and last but least, a ""Making Of Featurette."" This documentary interviews just about everyone including the costume designer (the ""costumes"" are shorts and bikinis...really, you needed a costume designer?) It goes without saying that this is pretty boring and self-congratulatory stuff. I was amused when they interviewed Brooke Hogan, the star of the show, that there was no audio of her answers. Nice bonus feature! Don't waste your time with this one either. I will save you the time by summing up: location shooting on water is difficult.""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is just another insane monster fish debacle from our friends at The Asylum, no more and no less. If you are looking for brainless B-movie hilarity, I suppose this could be a good choice. Most people will find the cast too obnoxious to endure for 90 minutes, though fans of the feminine form will likely be pleased. It's a given that it's a bad movie, but under the right circumstances, with the right group of people it could bring joy to fans of extraordinarily bad camp. If you want to see a good or a scary movie, though, this is not for you.",2,Two Heads Are Better Than One,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,9881,"['2-Headed', 'Shark', 'Attack', 'latest', 'ridiculous',

I have never seen such a movie have so many girls in bikinis all throughout the movie.The movie itself is horrible made. The shark is a joke. The story is really bad. The CGI is horrible. But, the extras and actors they used were hot!!!!The shark is mostly CGI, but it is done really bad. You won't believe it at all. And, then when it comes up to attack it's a badly made puppet.The worse acting I have every seen! The acting is so bad, I hated see and hearing them talk. You won't believe anything they say. They sound like they are reading every line just before they shot every scene they did.--Spolier Alert--The story really doesn't make much sense at the end. The shark is in the wining situation and everyone should had died based on how they set up their storyline up to that point. The last group of people about 6 people were left. They have no why to get off the island. The island is sinking fast. The shark will kill them once they go underwater.But, now suddenly, when it came down to the last group of people, the island isn't sinking as fast as before. They somehow find a cabin half sunk and they run inside. Three of the 6 members don't make it, where they died and the other 3 escape outside the cabin.Now they are just in the middle of the island and it's still have sunk. They suddenly have a gas barrel flow by them and surprise their still a lot of gas inside. Now, all they have to do is set up a trap and have the shark take the barrel and make it light up and blow up. Well, somehow it doesn't go that way and the main star, she still lived by fighting it off??? Not possible because she was just in the middle of the shark's  two heads hacking at it with a stick! What??? The other girls had a gun and she still didn't live? What luck?Then, the main star gets away and the shark actually eats the barrel and it blow up without any light or fire at all underwater too. But only one head blew up. Then, the last two people makes the shark go after a boat and the shark bites the boat propellers and the whole thing just blows up??? Why??? The gas barrel was gone. Just bitting the propellers wouldn't make the boat blow up because the shark did that to so many other boats before, but this boat must be one crazy boat because this time, it blew up.The movie makes no sense!!!

I will tell you about it in my review right now.The bad things about this movie is that the asylum is lacking in computer graphics,the acting is ok but,is like the graphics it's kinda youtube graphics(the graphics are low classed). The camera working needs work because the movie is mostly computer graphics they need to show more stuff that does not need any computer graphics. Now the nudity scene it doesn't make any sense in this movie, they shouldn't have any nudity in it. When the shark was chasing the boat, the shark's only head left it was switching sides of it's body and it's pretty embrassing to do that. And finally about the story, this movie would be more better by showing how the shark came into being.The good thing about this movie is that it has a good level of gore, nice level of violence, good action thats happening in some parts of the movie, some suspense.

1505865,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005ZI6NHG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","It appears Asylum is into the mega/super shark movie business, apparently having invested in a prop or graphic that still hasn't paid for itself. What is the size of this thing? Initially (see front cover) this thing attacks and swallows two skiers whole. Then the next thing you know a far smaller version has a hold of a guy's leg while he attempts to punch it in its nose. In one scene it has a hold of an underwater diver's leg then in the next frame the diver is swimming away with no visible damage to the leg. And how does something this big do shallow water attacks?Once we get past the typical Asylum bad production stuff, we have a decent ""B-"" grade shark movie. The sound track was fairly decent. I like the metal to give the film a grindhouse feel. A crew of hard body college students get stranded on what could be ""Gilligan's Island"" in the South Pacific, one that had former residents. They talk about shark feeding frenzies and cannibals. Girls in bikinis and guys with developed pecks. The island shows signs of fairly recent habitation and is manicured. There are boats that need repair at a dock. Once fixed they can be used for rescue or for boat races to litter the sea with shark food. To add to their woes, the tropical paradise is subject to tremors. The shark special effects ranged from laughable (head on 2 headed shark swimming) to pretty decent (stock footage of a real shark). Ample cleavage shots of Kate (Brooke Hogan) throughout the entire film (Hulk's daughter who also can't act).Island tremor special effects consisted of rumbling noises, camera shaking, and people falling down. The funny part was the scenes of people being eaten.
