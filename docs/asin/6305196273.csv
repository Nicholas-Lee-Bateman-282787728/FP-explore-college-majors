454151,A3FCLVBY9O5DOS,6305196273,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Like much British television after 1995, this series is underwritten and overproduced.  Settings and photography are good, but there's too much mediocre background music, which tends to drown out the dialogue.  Subtitles would have helped.  The plot and characters are not well drawn.  Of course, the plot is an intricate one, and getting it all into 6 hours was probably impossible.  But what emerges is very murky, with too much cutting back and forth between the various stories.  The occasional use of jump cuts is also quite inappropriate-- more overproduction showing off.  And considering that this is Dickens, whose forte was the creation of quirky, memorable characters, the series slips badly in many instances by failing to allow the time and ""business"" needed to establish the characters.  Jenny Wren, the ""Doll's Dressmaker,"" for example, is justly one of Dickens's most famous creations, but, despite the valiant efforts of the actress who plays her, the film gives only a faint notion of her marvelous, droll personality. The only characters that emerge fully are the central ones of the Boffins, Bella Willfer, and John Harmon.  I missed a lot of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn's dialogue because they talked so fast.  If I hadn't read the novel first, I would have been lost, so recommend doing that if you want to watch this. It does have its moments.  The villains are well done except that one of the main ones-- the gentile loan shark who slyly uses the Jewish character, Reah, as a front-- is left out entirely. Since Reah is defined by his relationship to the loan shark, he barely emerges as a character although, again, he's one of Dickens's most famous ones.Like many other reviewers. I think the 1970s version with Leo McKern as Boffin was much better than this one, and I wish they would put it on DVD. I wish they'd bring back the 1980s Little Dorritt with Derek Jacobi too.  The 2004 version of that is so much worse than even the 1998 Our Mutual Friend that I couldn't watch it all.",3,Not Enough Dickens,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2015,"['much', 'British', 'television', '1995', 'series', 'underwritten', 'overproduced', 'Settings', 'photography', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'mediocre', 'background', 'music', 'drown', 'out', 'dialogue', 'Subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'drawn', 'course', 'plot', 'intricate', 'one', 'getting', '6', 'hours', 'was', 'probably', 'impossible', 'what', 'very', 'murky', 'too', 'much', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'various', 'stories', 'occasional', 'use', 'jump', 'cuts', 'also', 'quite', 'inappropriate', 'more', 'overproduction', 'showing', 'considering', 'Dickens', 'forte', 'was', 'creation', 'quirky', 'memorable', 'characters', 'series', 'badly', 'many', 'instances', 'failing', 'allow', 'time', 'business', 'needed', 'establish', 'characters', 'Jenny', 'Wren', 'Doll', 'Dressmaker', 'example', 'justly', 'one', 'Dickens', 'most', 'famous', 'creations', 'valiant', 'efforts', 'actress', 'who', 'film', 'only', 'faint', 'notion', 'marvelous', 'droll', 'personality', 'only', 'characters', 'emerge', 'fully', 'are', 'central', 'ones', 'Boffins', 'Bella', 'Willfer', 'John', 'Harmon', 'missed', 'lot', 'Lizzie', 'Hexam', 'Eugene', 'Wrayburn', 'dialogue', 'talked', 'so', 'fast', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'so', 'recommend', 'doing', 'want', 'watch', 'have', 'moments', 'villains', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'main', 'ones', 'gentile', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'slyly', 'Jewish', 'character', 'Reah', 'front', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'Reah', 'defined', 'relationship', 'loan', 'shark', 'barely', 'character', 'again', 'one', 'Dickens', 'most', 'famous', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'think', '1970s', 'version', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Boffin', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'wish', 'would', 'put', 'DVD', 'wish', ""'d"", 'bring', 'back', '1980s', 'Little', 'Dorritt', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'too', '2004', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'even', '1998', 'Mutual', 'Friend', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch']",Our Mutual Friend VHS

454155,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,6305196273,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a masterful adaptation of the sometimes wordy Dickens. Having read the book, I must say that whoever adapted this script was very skillful. Characters who were not as interesting were pushed into the background (Fledgeby and Gerogianna Podsnap were eliminated altogether) leaving the way clear for the much more facinating characters.I enjoyed all of the preformances. As to Stephen Mackintosh, his character has been betrayed, thought to be dead and is in a terrible moral dilema. One cannot expect him to leap for joy under such circumstansces. Plus, it's so much cooler when he finally loses his temper at the end.My favorite part of the movie is the Lizzie/Eugene/Headstone love triangle. Eugene's world weariness is played subtley and Lizzie's innocence is never over done. As for Headstone, nervous breakdowns are very hard to do without looking silly and this actor manages to be scary and pathetic at once, it really adds a lot to the plot.The music is just perfect, the costumes are great (Bella's white ball gown is amazing) and the sets are ideal.I should warn people that the first tape is very hard to get into the first time out. Maybe it is too dark with too many characters at once. I considered turning it off after the first twenty minutes. However, get past the first tape and you will be hopelessly addicted.One more thing.

I always enjoy Dickens and just had to give it another try, and I'm so glad I did!I had been trying to watch SIDE 2 before I watched Side 1. I have no idea what I was thinking, but it doesn't work that way. Even worse, at the end of Side 1, I wondered if that was all. Was that the ending? Of course it wasn't. Don't stop there or you'll never see things come together. As you start Side 2, feel free to have a laugh thinking of me as I tried to start the movie at that part. Being 'lost' doesn't even start to explain it. Just don't make my mistake.In fact, even watching it the right way, from the beginning, you have to pay attention. This isn't a movie you can watch while you sort your socks. You also put in some time before you see the gorgeous backgrounds and clothes of the rich that some of us always enjoy. You get to enjoy the beautiful heroines from the beginning. I won't try to describe the story. That has been done already and just trying to do that makes my head swim. The plot twists and turns.I did enjoy the side-plot where 2 social climbers find out at their wedding reception that ""I don't have any  money, don't you?"" ""No! I have no money. You made a mistake marrying me.""  OUCH! What a great dilemma, and so fun to watch. Even more fun to watch as they try to recover from their mutual error.  That's just a side-plot.

Only Dickens can make such a complicated plot and make it work so delightfully.I've always like the Christmas story of Scrooge but I do believe this is better.

454173,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6305196273,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","The very first element that has to be said about this novel, or this work is that it is too intricate and characters are too complicated and intertwined in their motivations and even identities that we find it difficult to follow. The plot is slightly too thick for me.The second element is the social cruelty of the story. Cruelty against the poor, the small, the lower classes. They are working like hell making their bosses rich and they are described as having no real human feelings, no real human dimension. They are like human animals living in dirt, squalor and bleakness. It is at times unbearable how little self-respect they may have for themselves, and as for that only a few, and very few women make an effort among these poor people to be clean and keep their house and household clean.These poor are over-endowed with alcoholism and gross attitudes and habits, drinking late at night in dirty and in many ways disgusting public houses. And here is Dickens's social Darwinism. The upper classes are shown with all kinds of respectable qualities and everything is genteel with them. They drink in parties in glasses served to them on a tray by special servants, with music and beautiful dresses and suits. In these circles marriage has to be within one's own social rank, a type of social segregation particularly obnoxious, and marriage is first of all for money and nothing else, which is absolute hypocrisy, but at least in comfort and cleanliness, except for the abuse of cigars.So think of the situation in this novel of a miser of no genteel extraction and with no respectable human sentiments, who made his fortune out of the heap of dirt and rubbish collected in London and deposited up some river and sorted out with shovels by some human rats. What's more being a miser he is rejected by everyone. So his decision to give all his fortune to his son whom no one knows at all provided he marries the woman this father has set for him in his will makes the whole thing melodramatic and overwrought.So after a few murders and a lot of squalid events Dickens manages to bring up some happy ending for three young couples and an older one and a good old sound heavy moral lesson about doing what the heart is supposed to tell you to do and never be over-fascinated with money. But at the same time the only people who really suffer in this situation are the poor, even if they are shown as deserving that treatment. When you are born in the dregs of society your are bound to remain there and to end very badly.A little bit short, Mr. Dickens, and your regenerated main character is regenerated only symbolically, and he could not be rejected to the end since he was born on the right side of the silver spoon, even if this silver spoon has to be called a garbage shovel.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Too intricate and segregational,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,2809,"['very', 'first', 'element', 'be', 'said', 'novel', 'work', 'too', 'intricate', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'complicated', 'intertwined', 'motivations', 'even', 'identities', 'find', 'difficult', 'follow', 'plot', 'slightly', 'too', 'thick', 'me.The', 'second', 'element', 'social', 'cruelty', 'story', 'Cruelty', 'poor', 'small', 'lower', 'classes', 'are', 'working', 'hell', 'making', 'bosses', 'rich', 'are', 'described', 'having', 'real', 'human', 'feelings', 'real', 'human', 'dimension', 'are', 'human', 'animals', 'living', 'dirt', 'squalor', 'bleakness', 'times', 'unbearable', 'how', 'little', 'self-respect', 'may', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'very', 'few', 'women', 'make', 'effort', 'poor', 'people', 'be', 'clean', 'keep', 'house', 'household', 'clean.These', 'poor', 'are', 'over-endowed', 'alcoholism', 'gross', 'attitudes', 'habits', 'drinking', 'late', 'night', 'dirty', 'many', 'ways', 'disgusting', 'public', 'houses', 'here', 'Dickens', 'social', 'Darwinism', 'upper', 'classes', 'are', 'shown', 'kinds', 'respectable', 'qualities', 'everything', 'genteel', 'drink', 'parties', 'glasses', 'served', 'tray', 'special', 'servants', 'music', 'beautiful', 'dresses', 'suits', 'circles', 'marriage', 'be', 'one', 'own', 'social', 'rank', 'type', 'social', 'segregation', 'particularly', 'obnoxious', 'marriage', 'first', 'money', 'nothing', 'else', 'absolute', 'hypocrisy', 'least', 'comfort', 'cleanliness', 'abuse', 'cigars.So', 'think', 'situation', 'novel', 'miser', 'genteel', 'extraction', 'respectable', 'human', 'sentiments', 'who', 'made', 'fortune', 'heap', 'dirt', 'rubbish', 'collected', 'London', 'deposited', 'up', 'river', 'sorted', 'out', 'shovels', 'human', 'rats', 'What', 'more', 'being', 'miser', 'rejected', 'everyone', 'decision', 'give', 'fortune', 'son', 'whom', 'one', 'provided', 'woman', 'father', 'set', 'will', 'whole', 'thing', 'melodramatic', 'overwrought.So', 'few', 'murders', 'lot', 'squalid', 'events', 'manages', 'bring', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'three', 'young', 'couples', 'older', 'one', 'good', 'old', 'sound', 'heavy', 'moral', 'lesson', 'doing', 'what', 'heart', 'supposed', 'tell', 'do', 'never', 'be', 'over-fascinated', 'money', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'suffer', 'situation', 'are', 'poor', 'even', 'are', 'shown', 'deserving', 'treatment', 'When', 'are', 'born', 'dregs', 'society', 'are', 'bound', 'remain', 'there', 'end', 'very', 'badly.A', 'little', 'bit', 'short', 'Mr.', 'Dickens', 'regenerated', 'main', 'character', 'regenerated', 'only', 'symbolically', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'rejected', 'end', 'was', 'born', 'right', 'side', 'silver', 'spoon', 'even', 'silver', 'spoon', 'be', 'called', 'garbage', 'shovel.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Our Mutual Friend VHS

This movie takes its time to develop the personalities and lives of these fascinating people. It's six hours long but you won't want to miss a minute.Dickens' rats and angels come from all manner of social strata in turn of the century England. No one is free from Dickens scathing critique. The plots are set amidst the backdrop of an aristocracy which is collapsing under its own weight. The middle class grows and the born-rich are forced to socialize with ""new"" money. How distasteful! Even the poor are not immune to the social structure of the time; a river boatman, who dredges the river for bodies, will not let his son go to school; he must carry on the family trade, like his father did!The casting is just right and the acting strong. Oh, the faces of these actors and actresses!  They say so much without a word spoken.  You will fall in love with the hero's and heroine's as they try to figure out what they should do.I must admit, I like Dickens' evil guys! They are simply awful to the core. One of my favorite scenes is when Riderhood unexpectedly shows up in the school teachers (Mr. Headstone)  classroom sitting among the young pupils, sharing his wisdom. After his little lesson, he ruffles a boys hair as he leaves. I wanted to douse the poor lad's head in Lysol. There are a lot of neer-do-wells in this story who need their comeuppance.

This fine 1998 four part version tackles the problems with great brio, and both the river and the dust mounds are beautifully realized visually. There's also some excellent acting in both major and minor parts: Timothy Spall particularly shines as Mr. Venus as does David Morrissey, who does surprising things with Bradley Headstone. And while Margaret Tyzack should still be displaying her inestimable skills in parts as fully worthy of her as Antonia or Queen Anne, she does seem to have a great time of it as the society gargoyle Lady Tippins.In any adaptation of Dickens's longer works, minor characters inevitably are either marginalized or cut altogether because of the exigencies of time; yet even so, it seems particularly regrettable to lose in this adaptation Mr. Podsnap and his daughter Georgiana, and to see the parts of the Veneerings reduced so drastically. This adaptation also brings out some unusual qualities in the novel that are certainly latent within it but receive odd emphasis here. In this version the snobs seem rewarded and the undeserving poor roundly punished, in a way that really works against what was intended for your sympathies: you wind up having more pity for Bradley Headstone and Mr. Wegg than you do for their enemies. (Moreover, the upshot of Mr. Boffin's change of heart here seems to reinforce G. K. Chesterton's famous critique of it.)

Prior to watching this video series, I was not very familiar with this particular book from Charles Dickens.  I believe that this is the last book that Charles Dickens wrote prior to this death.  After watching this series, I then went and read novel itself.  The producers of this video series did a very good job in adapting this novel into a video format.  Over the years I have had the chance to read more and more of the novels of Charles Dickens and I have really come to appreciate his work.  He appears to have been a social reformer and he wanted to make people aware of the inequalities in the society of his time.  Our present generation could really use another modern day version of Charles Dickens.  So many of the things that he depicts in his novels are still with us, as avarice and greed,  which once again seem to become highly lauded characteristics by many people today.The camera work on this video series was excellent.  When the camera takes you down to the waterfront where the bottom level of society tries to eek out a living, the skies turn dark and gray and all of the building and people have a darkened color to them which symbolizes that hopelessness of the people and the society that lives here.  On the other hand, when the camera takes you into the parlors and drawing rooms of the upper crust of society, the skies are blues and the colors of the buildings, clothing, etc. takes on vibrant colors.Looking back, I often wonder why my teachers choose to use &#34;Tale of Two Cities&#34; and &#34;Great Expectations&#34; in their classrooms.  They may have done this due to the fact that this novels are shorter in length.  I think my teachers would have done a much better job in presenting Charles Dickens if they had instead chosen &#34;Out Mutual Friend&#34; and &#34;Little Dorrit.  While these novels may have been much longer in their overall length, I feel that they would have presented the student with novels that had much greater interest value in them and as a result we would have been willing to read the additional pages due to the high interest value of these two stories.  In &#34;Little Dorrit&#34; there is a character by the name of Mr. Merdle, who bilks people out of their money with his Ponzi scheme.  There is a modern day counterpoint to Mr. Merdle who did pretty much the same thing.

One of Dickens' most memorable characters from Our Mutual Friend is certainly Jenny Wren.  She is the disabled child of an alcoholic who manages to take care of herself and her father by doing doll dress-making.  She does some mischevious things in the novel and you really root for her, as well as sympathizing for her condition.  But in this adaptation they chose to have a woman play the part of Jenny who becomes an adult character.  So instead of a child who is street-wise and deals with her difficulties using play-acting like a child (who cannot play with children), she becomes a woman who appears a little like a simpleton.  It is the strangest thing I've seen in a Dickens adaptation.  Certainly this is very enjoyable production and I encourage anyone who likes this movie to read the book.

The film follows a huge cast of characters, most of whom will in some way be connected, from the heights of London society's most successful to the depths of the abysmally poor waterfront district's inhabitants. As with people, these characters range from very to marginally to not very complex; from good, to bad, to somewhere in between; from likable to unlikable; etc.When a large fortune goes unclaimed by its intended owner -- who was found dead under mysterious circumstances -- society is aghast to discover that this astonishing wealth is set to pass to a ""dust man"" and his wife. Innocents are haunted by unspoken accusations of murder; the intended of the dead man sees her chance to escape lower-middle class drudgery vanish; and the ""dustman"" and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, must begin their long journey into acceptability by society. This is the backdrop against which most of the story takes place. Cue in the mysterious stranger's arrival, the sinister employee who discovers a long buried will, the machinations of scheming, but moneyless, nobles, the romantic scheming of a bored, selfish man of society, the daily trials of the forgotten poor, etc., etc. -- and you have a true Dickens masterpiece.The acting in this film is superb. From the Boffins to John Rokesmith, from Bella to Eugene Raybern, Mr. Headstone to Riderhood, Lizzy to Bella's family, etc., etc. -- they are all beyond excellent.

It is a flawless BBC production, and as usual, the BBC mesmerizes with its flowing style and you forget you are watching an historical period movie--everything is so real.What makes Dickens stories so enjoyable and timeless is his array of fascinating characters.  Every facet of the human spirit finds a character in which to dwell.  Greed, generosity, kindness, selfishness, jealousy etc. are all embodied in different characters.  And then Dickens weaves plots and subplots with such dexterity that these characters meld together seamlessly.  But, best of all, they each get what they deserve in the end.  Those who are good have happy story endings and those that are bad, learn miserable life lessons.  It leaves a satisfying feeling that for once people get what they deserve, and not that life is unfair.Highly recommended",5,"A Timeless, Flawless Story",1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,940,"['Mutual', 'Friend', 'favorite', 'Dickens', 'adaptation', 'script', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'are', 'superb', 'flawless', 'BBC', 'production', 'usual', 'BBC', 'flowing', 'style', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'historical', 'period', 'movie', 'everything', 'so', 'real.What', 'Dickens', 'stories', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'timeless', 'array', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'facet', 'human', 'spirit', 'character', 'dwell', 'Greed', 'generosity', 'kindness', 'selfishness', 'jealousy', 'etc', 'are', 'embodied', 'different', 'characters', 'then', 'Dickens', 'plots', 'subplots', 'such', 'dexterity', 'characters', 'meld', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'best', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'end', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'happy', 'story', 'endings', 'are', 'bad', 'learn', 'miserable', 'life', 'lessons', 'satisfying', 'feeling', 'once', 'people', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'not', 'life', 'unfair.Highly', 'recommended']",Our Mutual Friend VHS

454203,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,6305196273,Reliable Reviews Too,"[18, 52]","A poor couple inherit wealth in London in the 1800's, and help some poor persons. Bad persons contrive to blackmail the wealth away. Two men compete for the affections of a young woman. Another young man hides his wealth to test the girl he wishes to marry. Sounds good without the death and creepiness of the actual film.This movie is lost in undeveloped characters, bleakness and death, becoming pleasant only at the end. I imagine the book is a little better than the film; because the reader can hurry over the dreary and linger upon the pleasant.This film leads you on, keeps you, only by mild intrigue, which comes to pleasantness, only in the last ten minutes of the six hour film. Jumps back and forth between several somber (serious and bleak) plots, with but a few minutes of interest with Mr. Boffin and the doll-dress-making, until you are thrilled to arrive at some pleasantness at the end. The death in this film overshadows the few minutes of appeal with the Boffins-couple and the three young, eligible, women. All the suitors are without personality, except ""Mr. Sloppy"". The film does excel in perfecting the creepiness of the bad guys, which unfortunately overshadows the film. Will appeal to the crowd who like mild horror films.The novel was written after Mr. Dickens's divorce from his wife. Mr. Dickens's great classics ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" were written during his long marriage, and have much more charm.In this film, the little brother continues to reject his good sister, after he finds out that she was right in her decision, and that she has suffered unjustly with his assistance. His character is unbelievable, a pointless scoundrel.The idea of an older couple inheriting unexpected wealth, overcoming their lack of education, and extending kindness to many, is a good plot, which the producer failed to exploit. The film also missed the opportunity to expand upon the plot of the young, poor, simple, man who seeks true love with a crippled, doll-dress-making, girl. The doll-dress-making girl is portrayed as insane in one scene, which is inconsistent to her skill, resourcefulness, effort, and kindness.There are some great ideas in this film from which a great film could be made; this film does not do it.Far from the 5-star league of ""Pride and Prejudice"" 2005, 1996, & 1940, ""North & South"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""David Copperfield"", and ""Oliver Twist"".

454218,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6305196273,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","""Our Mutual Friend"" is an adaptation of Dickens' last novel, arguably one of his best. The book was filled with compelling insights and social commentary which has been well-translated in this adaptation. Through the two main love stories, one gains a deeper understanding of the hypocrisy of the upper classes and of the unbearably stuffy conventions and etiquette of the time, all of which revolve around the class divisions between the lower and upper classes. Bella Wilfer (Anna Friel) is prepared to accept a marriage of convenience, to John Harmon (Steven Mackintosh) after he returns from a long stay abroad, for the sake of money and status in society. When John Harmon is found dead, a result of drowning in the river Thames, Bella's future takes a different turn - she ends up marrying John Rokesmith, a lowly secretary, but it is a marriage out of love this time around. There are some dark secrets in this story, a sort of mystery that unravels over a period of time.Then there is the story of Eugene Wrayburn (Paul McGann) who though poor is of noble birth. Eugene falls for young Lizzie Hexam (a very young Keeley Hawes, one of my favorite period actors, who has been inWives and Daughters,Under the Greenwood Tree, andThe Moonstone, among others). This romance too crosses social divisions, as young Lizzie's father drags corpses out of the River Thames for a living. The social criticism inherent in Dickens' novel is starkly and credibly portrayed in this adaptation and the cast does an excellent job in bringing this story vividly to life. An excellent adaptation that would have done Dickens' himself proud.",5,A stellar adaptation of Dickens' novel,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,1627,"['Mutual', 'Friend', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'last', 'novel', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'book', 'was', 'filled', 'compelling', 'insights', 'social', 'commentary', 'been', 'well-translated', 'adaptation', 'two', 'main', 'love', 'stories', 'one', 'gains', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'hypocrisy', 'upper', 'classes', 'unbearably', 'stuffy', 'conventions', 'etiquette', 'time', 'revolve', 'class', 'divisions', 'lower', 'upper', 'classes', 'Bella', 'Wilfer', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'prepared', 'accept', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'John', 'Harmon', 'Steven', 'Mackintosh', 'long', 'stay', 'abroad', 'sake', 'money', 'status', 'society', 'When', 'John', 'Harmon', 'found', 'dead', 'result', 'drowning', 'river', 'Thames', 'Bella', 'future', 'different', 'turn', 'up', 'marrying', 'John', 'Rokesmith', 'lowly', 'secretary', 'marriage', 'love', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'dark', 'secrets', 'story', 'sort', 'mystery', 'period', 'time.Then', 'story', 'Eugene', 'Wrayburn', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'who', 'poor', 'noble', 'birth', 'Eugene', 'young', 'Lizzie', 'Hexam', 'very', 'young', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'one', 'favorite', 'period', 'actors', 'who', 'been', 'inWives', 'Daughters', 'Greenwood', 'Tree', 'andThe', 'Moonstone', 'others', 'romance', 'too', 'social', 'divisions', 'young', 'Lizzie', 'father', 'drags', 'River', 'Thames', 'living', 'social', 'criticism', 'inherent', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'starkly', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'adaptation', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'vividly', 'life', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Dickens', 'proud']",Our Mutual Friend VHS
454219,A3N882HVOOPA2I,6305196273,Z. Yang,"[3, 3]","In this BBC miniseries ""Our Mutual Friend"", every bit of bittersweet of life is conveyed most incisively. It is a quite lengthy (three-tape of totally 339 min) production, and yet, with all the drama - life and death, love and hatred, passion and thriller - to tighten the grip, you won't feel the time once you start watching. It is a quite complicated plot with many characters, and yet, it is unfolded methodically such that you will actually enjoy the dimensions and dynamics.Strongly sensed, while watching this 1860s story, is its close relevance to the realities of true life, even modern life. The drama of John Harmon and his inheritance, around which the whole story is extended, exemplifies the struggle between love and money, which is a constant battle ever going on. The ending of young Harmon winning his true love without his money and Bella Wilfer, John's designated bride, finding her true self, fathoms the root of noble humanities. In character Lizzie Hexam there is writer's idealism, which made this boatman's daughter bearing unique grace and beauty although without any education. Luckily the truthfulness of the love between Lizzie and Eugene Wrayburn can be found in real life and so is its result - a magic of love - that's revealed in the story.There is no writer who could better dig into human natures and create edgy characters than Charles Dickens. In this final work of him, the broadly and deeply depicted characters, ranging from the upper crust to the lowest rung, prove for another time that he is truly the master. The actors and actresses, who have brought life to the characters, even the smallest ones, have played the roles to the bones. Needless to say this masterwork deserves such fine craft. Only if such fine work can be released on DVD, it'd be perfect.",5,Our Mutual Friend - Our True Life,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,1801,"['BBC', 'Mutual', 'Friend', 'bit', 'bittersweet', 'life', 'conveyed', 'most', 'incisively', 'quite', 'lengthy', 'three-tape', 'totally', '339', 'min', 'production', 'yet', 'drama', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'hatred', 'passion', 'thriller', 'tighten', 'grip', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'time', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'quite', 'complicated', 'plot', 'many', 'characters', 'yet', 'unfolded', 'methodically', 'such', 'will', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'dimensions', 'dynamics.Strongly', 'sensed', 'watching', '1860s', 'story', 'close', 'relevance', 'realities', 'true', 'life', 'even', 'modern', 'life', 'drama', 'John', 'Harmon', 'inheritance', 'whole', 'story', 'extended', 'struggle', 'love', 'money', 'constant', 'battle', 'ever', 'going', 'ending', 'young', 'Harmon', 'winning', 'true', 'love', 'money', 'Bella', 'Wilfer', 'John', 'designated', 'bride', 'finding', 'true', 'self', 'root', 'noble', 'humanities', 'character', 'Lizzie', 'Hexam', 'writer', 'idealism', 'made', 'boatman', 'daughter', 'bearing', 'unique', 'grace', 'beauty', 'education', 'Luckily', 'truthfulness', 'love', 'Lizzie', 'Eugene', 'Wrayburn', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'result', 'magic', 'love', 'revealed', 'story.There', 'writer', 'who', 'could', 'better', 'dig', 'human', 'natures', 'create', 'edgy', 'characters', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'final', 'work', 'broadly', 'deeply', 'depicted', 'characters', 'ranging', 'upper', 'crust', 'lowest', 'rung', 'prove', 'time', 'truly', 'master', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'brought', 'life', 'characters', 'even', 'smallest', 'ones', 'have', 'played', 'roles', 'bones', 'Needless', 'say', 'masterwork', 'such', 'fine', 'craft', 'Only', 'such', 'fine', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'be', 'perfect']",Our Mutual Friend VHS
