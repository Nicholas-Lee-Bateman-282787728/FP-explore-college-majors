I've been doing Yoga for six months and thought I could use this video but it was just totally lacking. It's VERY light stretching but Hemalayaa puts her personal touch on it and includes some of the most basic yoga poses. I was disappointed and glad I rented it first, even if your a beginner pass on this one.",2,If your less than a beginner...,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,435,"['usually', 'love', 'everything', 'Hemalayaa', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'doing', 'yoga', 'video', 'even', 'was', 'beginner', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'six', 'months', 'thought', 'could', 'use', 'video', 'was', 'just', 'totally', 'lacking', 'VERY', 'light', 'stretching', 'Hemalayaa', 'personal', 'touch', 'most', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'was', 'disappointed', 'glad', 'rented', 'first', 'even', 'beginner', 'pass', 'one']",HEMALAYAA: YOGA FOR EVERYONE
1221706,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B001O4C6IA,Jenny G,"[9, 9]","I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD! I am not a hard core yoga person.  For me yoga is something that complements the other fitness activities that I do.  In fact, before I did the first segment I had been on the elliptical for 15 minutes, done 40 minutes of strength exercises and 15 minutes of stretching.  I had also worked out prior to trying the second segment.I think this DVD would be good to use after a workout to provide some stretching and flexibility. I also think it would be good after a long day at work to relieve stress.  I like the 20 minute segments as they are easy to fit in anyplace.The words Hemalayaa uses to describe the DVD are ""fun"", ""joyful"", ""smile"".  I think these are good descriptions.  I'm easily bored by yoga DVDs that are so serious, and seem to go on forever.  She does have some mantras/chants (yum, rum) and also some funny facial expressions.  I am NOT a chanting person, but in the spirit Hemalayaa does them they are simply fun.  If you don't feel like doing them, then don't (or smile that she does them).  The expressions - well you can do them or not, but they are also in the same fun spirit.The poses are not difficult, but I also think the DVD is not boring. (I've been burned by ""beginner"" yoga DVDs that could put me to sleep.)  I think she has done a good job of putting together a DVD that will appeal to a wide audience, not just very serious yoga followers (in fact, it may be the more serious yoga followers that have the most trouble with this DVD).When I finished both practices, I felt cheerful, more flexible and  relaxed.  There are differences between the two practices, although they are also similar.  That might be the one improvement she could have made - to distinguish between the practices a little more.I have a bad knee and the only pose I skipped was the warrior pose in the second practice.  I was able to adjust all other poses to respect my knee.",5,Fun yoga!!,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,1914,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'hard', 'core', 'yoga', 'person', 'something', 'other', 'fitness', 'activities', 'do', 'fact', 'did', 'first', 'segment', 'had', 'been', 'elliptical', '15', 'minutes', 'done', '40', 'minutes', 'strength', 'exercises', '15', 'minutes', 'stretching', 'had', 'also', 'worked', 'out', 'prior', 'trying', 'second', 'segment.I', 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'use', 'workout', 'provide', 'stretching', 'flexibility', 'also', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'relieve', 'stress', 'like', '20', 'minute', 'segments', 'are', 'easy', 'fit', 'anyplace.The', 'words', 'Hemalayaa', 'describe', 'DVD', 'are', 'fun', 'joyful', 'smile', 'think', 'are', 'good', 'descriptions', ""'m"", 'easily', 'bored', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'serious', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'have', 'mantras/chants', 'yum', 'rum', 'also', 'funny', 'facial', 'expressions', 'am', 'NOT', 'chanting', 'person', 'spirit', 'Hemalayaa', 'are', 'simply', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'smile', 'expressions', 'well', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'are', 'also', 'same', 'fun', 'spirit.The', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'also', 'think', 'DVD', 'not', 'boring', ""'ve"", 'been', 'burned', 'beginner', 'DVDs', 'could', 'put', 'sleep', 'think', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'DVD', 'will', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience', 'not', 'just', 'very', 'serious', 'yoga', 'followers', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'yoga', 'followers', 'have', 'most', 'trouble', 'DVD', '.When', 'finished', 'practices', 'felt', 'cheerful', 'more', 'flexible', 'relaxed', 'are', 'differences', 'two', 'practices', 'are', 'also', 'similar', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'improvement', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'distinguish', 'practices', 'little', 'more.I', 'have', 'bad', 'knee', 'only', 'pose', 'skipped', 'was', 'warrior', 'pose', 'second', 'practice', 'was', 'able', 'adjust', 'other', 'poses', 'respect', 'knee']",HEMALAYAA: YOGA FOR EVERYONE

I wouldn't suggest it for people who have more than a year experience though, although I still use it on days when I need off time and don't want to do anything too hard.

1221709,A8IF4ZBZRY86C,B001O4C6IA,Michelle Garringer,"[13, 14]",i love yoga and i have all of the Hemalayaa DVDs which i highly recommend along with this one. i am looking for beginner yoga that arent a long workout. a few years back i got out of yoga and have been trying to get back into it due to a very stressful job and the threatening high blood pressure readings and chidings of my doctor mother and various friends. i preordered this and waited while i went through injuries falling down 4 stairs and dealing with an impossible set of co-workers that drive my blood pressure up and just this week antibiotics and a sinus infection. so when i get the mail today and i get this DVD i think i'll just watch it maybe meditatate a little if she has a relaxation section. she does. i got to tell you its 2 workouts 20 minutes each and they are just what the paragraph says- relaxing centering i feel better calmer and i'm smiling because i had fun. i finished the first and only due to time constraints i reluctantly ended the second ten minutes in. These yoga positions are really on the easier side if you have concerns about past injuries and definately good for somebody starting back in again like me. for those of you who are serious about your yoga this workout is FUN and shows creativity to its producers taking a new look at yoga. i will put this on my do first list.

I didn't have to struggle with lunges because Hemalayaa has her knees down, I didn't get vertigo because you slowly and briefly hold a position. There are 2 workouts at 20 minutes each. As usual in her DVDs, there's her voiceover and a quiet, subtle percussion background music. The stage is decorated with candles, pillows, and flowy sheer curtains. The choreography transitions from the sitting cross-legged on the floor with a brief chant, then standing and ends on the floor lying on a bolster (rolled up blankets). The unique qualities of this workout is the movement in the positions-you're either swaying, shaking, pulsing, rotating wrists. There are also facial movements (stick out your tongue) and bursts of exhalation.

At first I was a bit put off by the ""yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm""ing and tongue-sticking-outing, but that does seem to be a good way to release tension.  This gets 4 rather than 5 stars because the breathing can be rushed in places, but there's no reason why you can't do them more slowly.  I think I wind up doing 3 lungs for every 4 she does. You do have to watch the directions the first time through (later, you should be able to do them without watching, when your face is away from the screen).  But to balance that out, there is a brief medition/quiet time at the end of the routines.
