495105,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000007PRF,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought the 1st story (&#34;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&#34;) was a phenomenal masterpiece that really made us feel the sorrow of Good Friday and the glorious joy of Easter Sunday. The 2nd book (&#34;Prince Caspian&#34;) had the difficult job of following the 1st book which was nothing short of a masterpiece. It wasn't my favorite. But it did have some great moments. The 3rd book &#34;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&#34; was pretty good, and it had some really great moments.That brings us to this 4th book. (&#34;The Silver Chair&#34;) In my opinion, this 4th chapter was the best one since &#34;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&#34;Jill Pole is a sad child who finds herself picked on so much at school. She then receives some comfort from the redeemed Eustace.  They end up in Narnia, and Jill (showing off a bit) finds herself separated from her friend Eustace. She then meets Aslan himself who gives her 4 tasks to remember. She tries, but she doesn't remember so well.Basically, the now aged Caspian has lost his wife to a deadly serpent, and his son has been kidnapped. Jill and Eustace must somehow find Caspian's son Rilian. Some benevolent owls explain to them what happened and they find themselves teaming up with the VERY pessimistic Puddleglum. He complains SO MUCH that you may find yourself in tears. What is interesting (and funny) is that Eustace was such a complainer in Book 3 (&#34;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&#34;), and now he has to deal with the constant complainer Puddleglum.One sweet moment is when Eustace's reformed self is underlined. In book 3 &#34;Voyage of the Dawn Treader,&#34; he found himself turned into a dragon. And when our trio runs across a seemingly dangerous dragon, Eustace goes right up to it, and is kind to it. Without going into the whole story, he just says: &#34;I know a thing or two about dragons.&#34;However, this movie takes a bold stand and (like the book) shows that SOMETIMES, the group is wrong, and the complainer is right. The cold and starving trio get a message from a woman who seems nice. She tells them to go to the land of the giants where they will find warm beds, hot baths, and plenty to eat. We may have been sick of Puddleglum's complaints, but at an important point, he's RIGHT when he gets nervous and points out: &#34;Well, Aslan told us to go to the city of the giants, but he didn't  have anything to say about us staying with them.&#34;The giants SEEM nice, but somehow we get the impression that something just isn't right. Some of the giants start to feel sorry for our heroic trio, and we can infer that they are in some kind of danger. So, they make their plans to escape. Whatever Puddleglum's faults were, and however much he complained, there is no denying that he is RIGHT when he says: &#34;We brought down the anger of Aslan. That's what comes from not following his signs.&#34;Eventually, they get back on track and we gradually realize that even though they have ended up where Aslan told them to go, they are in hell. (Or at least C.S. Lewis's interpretation of it.) Interestingly, the book explains it as a place of sorrow more than anything. They then come across someone who feeds them dinner, but appears very sinister. It's not in the book, but there's an interesting 'invention for the film' when this sinister host gets angry at Eustace for talking out of turn, and Puddleglum protects him. Then Puddleglum finds his life threatened with the words: &#34;Do you want to die?&#34; And he (in a dry and comical manner) answers: &#34;Not especially. But if it's a choice between me and the boy, I suppose you better kill me.&#34;I don't want to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen or read it. But there is a moment of pure psychological terror when this sinister host sits in a silver chair, and we realize that he may not be the sinister and disturbed man we thought we was.  This even involves the last command of Aslan. The children understandably have fear. But of all people, Puddleglum the complainer boldly steps forward. And with a sad dignity he explains that they know what they have to do. And while the situation is desperate as well as dangerous, that doesn't let that off from doing what it is Aslan told them to do.Perhaps the greatest moment in the film is when Puddleglum has to explain to the main evil of the story that even if Narnia isn't real, the made up things are far better than anything she created. Undoubtedly, this reflects C.S. Lewis's conversion from atheism to Christianity. (Anglo Catholicism to be exact)I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But the movie follows the book quite well. Some things were snipped to be sure, but that was probably just to keep it at the 3 hour length.In the 3rd Book, VOTDT, Aslan makes a beautiful speech about how he IS in our world, but we have to learn to know him by the name he carries in our world. This speech in the 3rd book, is moved to this 4th film. (Probably because they knew it would be the last film of the series, and it would be a nice way to end the series of films.)One of the best things about this film is that we have a team of 3 hopeful heroes following the commands of Aslan the Christ Lion, in hopes of finding the missing Prince Rilian. But they are NOT polished Hollywood or Disney heroes. Nor do they have totally implausible Harry Potter powers. We have the sweet girl Jill who means well, but can't always remember everything. We have Eustace who appears normal. But we know he had to go through a journey of redemption in he last book. And we have the complainer Puddleglum who drives us crazy with his constant complaining. But as the journey gets more dark and desperate, his complaints seem to get more and more valid.All in all, this film follows the book quite well, and in my opinion is the best film/book since &#34;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&#34;",5,"The Best Book/Film Since ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe""",1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,5974,"['Giving', 'brief', 'rundown', 'where',

495107,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B000007PRF,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[5, 5]","-This review pertains to the original DVD release, not the remastered edition-In 1990, the final film in the BBC's Narnia series made its debut. The series, which consisted of four films, was based onThe Chronicles of Narniabooks by C.S. Lewis and remained very faithful to the source material. However, after having produced the first three films, the budget seems to have shrunk for this, the final installment. And for the first time it hurts the overall quality of the film. The Silver Chair is probably the weakest of the film series mainly because of the shortcuts that the filmmakers were forced to take to accommodate the low budget. Actors who appeared in previous episodes are recast in new roles, special effects are hurried and unconvincing, and the production design seems uninspired. All of this is unfortunate as this film had perhaps the greatest potential as a darker adventure, but overall numerous minor disappointments make this film less satisfying. Still, The Silver Chair is the must-have conclusion to the series and despite its flaws has become a family favorite.While at their unpleasant boarding school, Eustace and his schoolmate Jill frantically search for a place to hide from school bullies. After asking Aslan for help, Eustace and Jill are magically transported to Narnia, where Aslan has an important mission for them. They are to find and rescue Prince Rilian, King Caspian's son and only heir to the throne of Narnia. Furthermore Aslan also appoints Jill the task of remembering four cryptic signs that will help them on their quest. They are given aid by a talking owl named Glimfeather, who takes them to the Parliament of Owls. There, Eustace and Jill are told of how Rilian's mother was killed by a poisonous serpent, and that Rilian later disappeared while visiting the site of his mother's death. The owls then take the two children to the swamplands where a marsh-wiggle named Puddleglum will serve them as a guide on their epic quest. Puddleglum turns out to be a curmudgeonly pessimist, but an invaluable companion. His knowledge of Narnia's history, geography, and culture and his abundance of survival skills prove to be an under-appreciated asset for Eustace and Jill. On their journeys they have many adventures such as an encounter with a dragon, an attack by savage giants, and they even cross a colossal ancient bridge that spans the distance between two mountains. Also they meet a beautiful traveler who calls herself the Lady of the Green Kirtle, and her escort, a black knight, who neither acknowledges them nor shows his face. The Lady of the Green Kirtle tells the children that they look awfully tired and should take respite at the castle of Harfang, the home of the gentle giants. After she and the knight depart, the children insist on going to Harfang against the advice of Puddleglum, who has a bad feeling about the lady and her motives. It turns out that he was right to. The giants of Harfang are jovial and hospitable, but something about their behavior is off-putting. To their horror, Eustace and Jill discover that the ""gentle giants"" intend to eat them as part of their autumn feast. Eustace, Jill, and Puddleglum just barely manage to escape, but they do so by taking shelter in a cave, which collapses. After regaining consciousness, they find themselves deep underground in the darkness, in the gloom, in the terrible depths of the Earth. They are taken prisoner by a race of grotesque beings called Under-Earthmen, who are ruled over by a tyrannical queen. They also meet a strange masked man who reveals himself to be the black knight, and they learn from him that queen is none other than the Lady of the Green Kirtle. The knight explains how the queen has been preparing him to lead an army to the over-world, where they intend to defeat the natural leaders of all countries and declare themselves as overlords. The knight also tells them that he suffers a strange enchantment, which drives him mad at night, so he is restrained in a magical silver chair for his own protection. The knight asks Puddleglum and the two children to watch over him in his madness to ensure that he does not escape and he forces them to swear an oath that under no circumstances whatsoever are they to release him from his restraints. But when the time comes, the knight begs and pleads that they set him free. But do they dare defy the malevolent queen and what of the consequences to setting this lunatic free? And most importantly of all will they ever find Prince Rilian and return to their own world?The Silver Chair features a cast of veteran British actors (most of which American audiences will be unfamiliar with). The cast includes David Thwaites as Eustace, Camilla Power as Jill, Geoffrey Russell as Aged King Caspian, Richard Henders as Prince Rilian, Big Mick as Trumpkin, Warwick Davis as Glimfeather, Tom Baker as Puddleglum, Barbara Kellerman as The Lady of the Green Kirtle / The Queen of the Underworld, and Ronald Pickup as the voice of Aslan. As far as the cast goes, most of the actors are clearly stage performers and unfamiliar with the medium of film, which leads to some pretty hammy, over-projected acting. However, in an odd way this actually suits the story.Despite its obvious flaws, The Silver Chair is a worthy finale to the series.The DVD also includes a still gallery and an animated trivia challenge. All three DVDs containing the four Narnia films can be found together in a moneysavingbox set, which includes beautiful artwork on the packaging.

495110,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000007PRF,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[26, 26]","Years before Walden Media debuted their big-budget version of ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,"" the BBC created their own Narnia Chronicles. Despite some goofy prosthetics and a shoestring budget, this is easily the best of the three movies, with excellent acting, pacing, and even some decent special effects.The story opens at a trendy school that Eustace Scrubb attends. But a garden shed doorway leads Eustace and his bullied schoolmate Jill to Aslan's country. But after Eustace is almost killed because of Jill, the god-lion Aslan gives girl an assignment and four signs to follow. King Caspian is now an old, dying man with no heir to follow him, because his son was lured away by a strange serpentine temptress long ago.Jill and Eustace team up with a gloomy Marshwiggle, Puddleglum, who serves as their guide as they go to north Narnia. Along the way they must deal with carnivorous giants, enormous bridges and bad weather. But the enigmatic signs that Aslan gave Jill are hard to follow -- and they soon find that the missing Prince is ensnared in a web of madness and magic.Don't expect this to be a mere copy of the past two movies -- the Pevensies are nowhere to be seen, and old faves like Caspian, Aslan and Trumpkin only have cameos. Sure, they ride owls and hang out with giants. But this is a grimmer, darker story, with a cataclysmic finale and a tight, sometimes harrowing storyline.The past two Narnia movies suffered from hokey special effects and some spotty acting. ""The Silver Chair"" cleans all that up, trimming the special effects edges and focusing on the more majestic sets, costumes and scripting. And for the most part, it's quite a success. Even the flashbacks to the queen's death and Rilian's disappearance are heartrending and quietly effective.There are a few flaws -- for a paradise, Aslan's country looks pretty scrubby and brown. And the final battle with the Emerald Witch is downright silly, with a giant snake puppet twisting around on the floor. But the special effects are infinitely improved in this one, ranging from convincing giants to some genuinely harrowing moments on a giant bridge.Lewis had become a bit less hamhanded with the allegory and Christian symbolism by this time. Instead, he gives jabs at anything-goes attitudes and nihilism. Additionally, he creates one of the most intense and outstanding scenes of the entire Chronicles, with the Witch playing elaborate brain games with Rilian and the kids, slowly convincing them that all they know and believe is a lie -- including the sun and the world above ground.Thwaites and Power both give excellent, understated performances as two kids who bicker constantly, but really care about each other, and Tom Baker (of ""Dr Who"" fame) is glorious as the perpetually pessimistic Marshwiggle. Barbara Kellerman, alas, is still hamming it up, with lots of over-the-top laughter, screeching, cooing and snarling.Despite Kellerman and some primitive CGI, ""The Silver Chair"" is probably the best of the three BBC Narnia movies, with its darker storyline and excellent lead acting.",4,Get out of the chair,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,3086,"['Years', 'Walden', 'Media', 'debuted', 'big-budget', 'version', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'BBC', 'created', 'own', 'Narnia', 'Chronicles', 'goofy', 'prosthetics', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'easily', 'best', 'three', 'movies', 'excellent', 'acting', 'pacing', 'even', 'decent', 'special', 'effects.The', 'story', 'trendy', 'school', 'Eustace', 'Scrubb', 'garden', 'shed', 'doorway', 'Eustace', 'bullied', 'schoolmate', 'Jill', 'Aslan', 'country', 'Eustace', 'almost', 'killed', 'Jill', 'god-lion', 'Aslan', 'girl', 'assignment', 'four', 'signs', 'follow', 'King', 'Caspian', 'now', 'old', 'dying', 'man', 'heir', 'follow', 'son', 'was', 'lured', 'away', 'strange', 'serpentine', 'temptress', 'long', 'ago.Jill', 'Eustace', 'team', 'up', 'gloomy', 'Marshwiggle', 'Puddleglum', 'who', 'guide', 'go', 'north', 'Narnia', 'way', 'must', 'deal', 'carnivorous', 'giants', 'enormous', 'bridges', 'bad', 'weather', 'enigmatic', 'signs', 'Aslan', 'gave', 'Jill', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'soon', 'find', 'missing', 'Prince', 'ensnared', 'web', 'madness', 'magic.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'mere', 'copy', 'past', 'two', 'movies', 'Pevensies', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'old', 'faves', 'Caspian', 'Aslan', 'Trumpkin', 'only', 'have', 'cameos', 'Sure', 'ride', 'owls', 'hang', 'out', 'giants', 'grimmer', 'darker', 'story', 'cataclysmic', 'finale', 'tight', 'sometimes', 'harrowing', 'storyline.The', 'past', 'two', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'suffered', 'hokey', 'special', 'effects', 'spotty', 'acting', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'up', 'trimming', 'special', 'effects', 'edges', 'focusing', 'more', 'majestic', 'sets', 'costumes', 'scripting', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'success', 'Even', 'flashbacks', 'queen', 'death', 'Rilian', 'disappearance', 'are', 'heartrending', 'quietly', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'paradise', 'Aslan', 'country', 'pretty', 'scrubby', 'brown', 'final', 'battle', 'Emerald', 'Witch', 'downright', 'silly', 'giant', 'snake', 'puppet', 'twisting', 'around', 'floor', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'infinitely', 'improved', 'one', 'ranging', 'convincing', 'giants', 'genuinely', 'harrowing', 'moments', 'giant', 'bridge.Lewis', 'had', 'become', 'bit', 'less', 'hamhanded', 'allegory', 'Christian', 'symbolism', 'time', 'Instead', 'jabs', 'anything-goes', 'attitudes', 'nihilism', 'Additionally', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'entire', 'Chronicles', 'Witch', 'playing', 'elaborate', 'brain', 'games', 'Rilian', 'kids', 'slowly', 'convincing', 'know', 'believe', 'lie', 'including', 'sun', 'world', 'ground.Thwaites', 'Power', 'give', 'excellent', 'understated', 'performances', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'bicker', 'constantly', 'really', 'care', 'other', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Dr', 'Who', 'fame', 'glorious', 'perpetually', 'pessimistic', 'Marshwiggle', 'Barbara', 'Kellerman', 'alas', 'still', 'hamming', 'up', 'lots', 'over-the-top', 'laughter', 'screeching', 'cooing', 'snarling.Despite', 'Kellerman', 'primitive', 'CGI', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'BBC', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'darker', 'storyline', 'excellent', 'lead', 'acting']",N/A

Let the transformations begin!This is probably the darkest and gloomiest of the Narnian Chronicles, most of it taking place in an subteranean world of gnomes and lightless creatures. Lewis' gnomes are not cute dwarven creatures, but something like gloomy human moles without emotion. They must be ""shown the light"" by the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve. The visit to the land of the giants is also a somewhat scary span of chapters, with betrayal and helplessness being central themes.

Lewis, although I am surprised that this series was not able to complete the entire set of novels In this story Eustace Scrubb (David Thwaites) is being tormented at school and while looking for a place to hide from the bullies ends up entering the magical world of Narnia from a garden shed, along with another persecuted classmate, Jill Pole (Camilla Power). There Aslan gives them the task of rescuing Prince Rilian, the stolen son of King Caspian. This requires them to travel, along with Puddleglum the Marshwiggle (Tom Baker), north to the Deep Lands of the underworld belonging to the Green Lady (Barbara Kellerman). There they meet the Black Knight, who is under the enchantment of the evil Green Lady, who tortures him in a Silver Chair that sends him into a terrifying rage.By the time you get to ""The Silver Chair"" you have either accepted the limited special effects of this production or not. Yes, the animatronics of Aslan are almost unbelievably simplistic, but the kids always talk to him like he was a real lion and ruler of Narnia and that is all that really matters in the end. The costumes and sets are pretty good and above all the story is faithful to the Lewis narrative. One of the things I enjoyed most about the ""The Silver Chair"" is the way that Lewis elegantly works in Christian elements into the story. Azlan works hard to have Jill learn a series of signs, by which she and Eustace will be able to achieve their goal. However, Jill has problems remembering the signs and Eustace does not really seem up to the challenge. Then again, most great children's literature works on two levels, although clearly ""The Silver Chair"" and the other chronicles will appeal more to the kids, which is fine, because that is really who they were intended for even though they are arguably too good for the little ones.",4,"Azlan sends two children off to rescue Prince Rilian,",1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1933,"['Silver', 'Chair', 'fourth', 'final', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'am', 'surprised', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'complete', 'entire', 'set', 'novels', 'story', 'Eustace', 'Scrubb', 'David', 'Thwaites', 'being', 'tormented', 'school', 'looking', 'place', 'hide', 'bullies', 'up', 'entering', 'magical', 'world', 'Narnia', 'garden', 'shed', 'persecuted', 'classmate', 'Jill', 'Pole', 'Camilla', 'Power', 'Aslan', 'task', 'rescuing', 'Prince', 'Rilian', 'stolen', 'son', 'King', 'Caspian', 'travel', 'Puddleglum', 'Marshwiggle', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'north', 'Deep', 'Lands', 'underworld', 'belonging', 'Green', 'Lady', 'Barbara', 'Kellerman', 'meet', 'Black', 'Knight', 'who', 'enchantment', 'evil', 'Green', 'Lady', 'who', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'terrifying', 'rage.By', 'time', 'get', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'have', 'either', 'accepted', 'limited', 'special', 'effects', 'production', 'not', 'Yes', 'animatronics', 'Aslan', 'are', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'simplistic', 'kids', 'always', 'talk', 'was', 'real', 'lion', 'ruler', 'Narnia', 'really', 'matters', 'end', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'faithful', 'Lewis', 'narrative', 'One', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'way', 'Lewis', 'elegantly', 'Christian', 'elements', 'story', 'Azlan', 'hard', 'have', 'Jill', 'learn', 'series', 'signs', 'Eustace', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'achieve', 'goal', 'However', 'Jill', 'problems', 'remembering', 'signs', 'Eustace', 'not', 'really', 'seem', 'up', 'challenge', 'Then', 'again', 'most', 'great', 'children', 'literature', 'two', 'levels', 'clearly', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'other', 'chronicles', 'will', 'appeal', 'more', 'kids', 'fine', 'really', 'who', 'were', 'intended', 'even', 'are', 'arguably', 'too', 'good', 'little', 'ones']",N/A

Lewis, are truly superb books, and I believe that ""The Silver Chair"" is my favorite from the series. The beautifully conveyed morals are truly wonderful! This particular installment in the series is terrific, because it concerns the daring mission of two children, (Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole,) and a Marsh-Wiggle, (Puddleglum,) who are commanded by The Great Lion Aslan, to go in search for ""The Lost Prince Rilian,"" who has been seduced and held captive by an unsurpassably evil force. They face many perils during their quest, and must use caution in order to discern between those whom they meet, in order to see whom they can trust. The BBC adaptation of this book is verry good, with the children turning in nice performances, (although Camilla Powers, who portrays Jill, is a little too whiny for my liking,) and the actor portraying Puddleglum does an exceptionally terrific job! A special compliment is needed for the performance of Barbara Kellerman, who portrays ""The Emerald Lady."" Her brilliant seductiveness, and ultimately her true sinister purpose is revealed, and she does a great job. Ronald Pickup, (the voice of Aslan,) does well at conveying his authority and love. The only minor complaints I would make is that the the director takes some liberties with a scene in which Jill, Eustace, and Puddle-Glum encounter a knight (who is more than what he seems.) This particular character is far too sinister in manner, quite contrary to the chearful character in the book. I realize the directors intention in doing this, but perhaps it was a little overdone. The only other complaint that I have is that the ending of the film differs greatly from the book, for the director took a sceen from ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" and wove it into the plot, yet if anything it enhances the plot, and is no cause for distress in my opinion. All in all, a verry good adaptation, and truly worth your time.
