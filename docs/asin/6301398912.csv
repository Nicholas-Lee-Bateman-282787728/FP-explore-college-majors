251208,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301398912,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I find it rather hilarious that I have friends who outright refuse to ever watch this movie.  In fact, I've had one friend note on a quiz that the one film he will never agree to watch is `Beaches'.  At the time, I hadn't seen the film so I really had no idea why he would refuse to watch anything, but then again I'm one of those people who wants to give everything a fair shake.Having finally seen the film, I know he'd hate it so he's better off living in his world of ignorance.This is about as saccharine and dripping with melodrama as a Ron Howard film, and yet it fails to reign in enough to make it feel truly moving beyond simple stock emotions.  Yes, you'll cry (or at least feel sad) but at the end of the day I didn't feel a real connection here.  Maybe it is the structure of the film that fights against it and doesn't truly allow the relationship to develop as a whole.  Instead, it feels very structured.They embrace, they fight, they embrace, they fight, they embrace, the fight, they embrace.There isn't much else to the story and so when the finale comes the relationship feels somewhat stereotypical and not very embedded.  When the theme song (Midler's take on `Wind Beneath My Wings') takes over the closing credits we are supposed to be moved to tears and yet there was something that rang false in the delivery.  Still, this has amassed legions of fans, most of which are going to disagree with my review.  This is not a bad film at all.  It is enjoyable in parts, and Midler is a wonderful scenery chewer.

There will be friends but there is only one true friend who'll stand by you through thick and thin. Beaches is an example of friendship that started from childhood until the death of one friend.Hilary and Claire met in Atlantic City when they were children and kept in contact with each other through letters until they were grown. Hilary shows up in New York and stays with Claire. Their relationship is tested when a man enters their lives. He helps Claire with her career but their marriage doesn't last. Claire is too wrapped up in her career to be focused on a real relationship. But Claire doesn't go astray from her dreams unlike Hilary.Hilary wanted to break from her elite roots but she found herself returning when her father died and she married a lawyer who cheated her out of a marriage with another woman. She was forced to return to law when she got pregnant with her daughter and no husband to support her. Then tragedy strikes.Bette Midler is a multitalented woman who can display her acting and singing abilities. She evolves into her character who is pretty much a diva. Barbara Hershey is innocent yet strong as her character who displays manners of old wealth.This is a movie that will make the viewer value the meaning of friendship and why it is important to havae people in their life.,5,Best Friends Forever,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,1390,"['Good', 'friends', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'people', 'go', 'life', 'finding', 'real', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'friends', 'only', 'one', 'true', 'friend', 'who', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'thick', 'thin', 'Beaches', 'example', 'friendship', 'started', 'childhood', 'death', 'one', 'friend.Hilary', 'Claire', 'met', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'kept', 'contact', 'other', 'letters', 'were', 'grown', 'Hilary', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'stays', 'Claire', 'relationship', 'tested', 'when', 'man', 'lives', 'Claire', 'career', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'last', 'Claire', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'career', 'be', 'focused', 'real', 'relationship', 'Claire', ""n't"", 'go', 'astray', 'dreams', 'Hilary.Hilary', 'wanted', 'break', 'elite', 'roots', 'found', 'returning', 'when', 'father', 'died', 'married', 'lawyer', 'who', 'cheated', 'marriage', 'woman', 'was', 'forced', 'return', 'law', 'when', 'got', 'pregnant', 'daughter', 'husband', 'support', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'strikes.Bette', 'Midler', 'multitalented', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'display', 'acting', 'singing', 'abilities', 'character', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'diva', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'innocent', 'yet', 'strong', 'character', 'who', 'manners', 'old', 'wealth.This', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'value', 'meaning', 'friendship', 'why', 'important', 'havae', 'people', 'life']",Beaches VHS

If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend that you do. It tells the story of two young women who meet when they are 11 years old. At a glance, they seem like two completely different people, but in the end, it's their strong devotion to their friendship that make them so close. Bette Midler does an excellent job in her portrayal as CC Bloom, a feisty redhead who is determined to succeed in music and will do almost anything to do so. Hilary Whitney, played by the talented Barbara Hershey, is a quiet, reserved woman who often finds herself jealous of CC's rising success. CC and Hilary may be very different, but they grow even closer when Hilary gives birth to a child--a beautiful little girl named Victoria. When Hilary becomes diagnosed with a fatal disease, she is forced to search her soul and strengthen her relationships with CC and Victoria. Throughout the movie, CC and Hilary go through many difficult times, but in the end, their friendship prevails. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone, but don't expect to have dry eyes at the end! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will touch every piece of your heart.

It's a real tear-jerker, heartwrenching, targeting the audience's tear ducts, but the film does have an aura of sincerity and authenticity.It has an interesting and well-constructed plot. The friendship has its ups and downs. Bette is selfish, egotistical, and envious. Her friend is better looking, better behaved, but has marital problems.

251261,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301398912,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[9, 15]","Trust, communication, and care are three key ingredients when two individuals form a friendship, as these components maintain and foster mutual respect and understanding.  Trust entails two individual's ability to share secretive and personal information without limitations, as there is no fear of harm and judgment.  Listening is the vital portion of communication while the other shares his or her personal information.  Without this kind of communication it becomes hard to share information, and difficult to form friendship.  To provide the best possible attention through good communication and trust one displays that one cares.  If two individuals care it becomes possible for the most unlikely individuals to form an improbable friendship, as C C Bloom (Bette Midler) and Hillary Whitney (Barbara Hershey) do in Beaches.C C rehearses for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl when she receives a message, an unknown message to the audience, but the audience can decipher the social codes that are important as C C drops everything including the evening performance in order to get to San Francisco.  This opening directs the audience into the direction of something immediately threatening.  The question is what can be so important to C C, as she leaves everything behind and rents a car to drive in a rainstorm to San Francisco.  Two lengthy flashbacks deliver the reason for why it is important to C C to drive through the storm.The first flashback begins decades earlier in Atlantic City where Hillary has lost herself along the boardwalk, as C C notices her while hiding in order to smoke a cigarette.  Helpfully, C C emerges from underneath the boardwalk, as she tells Hillary that she knows the hotel where she is staying.  This moment brings the two together, as C C's mother appears to tell her that she has received an opportunity to audition for a Hollywood film director.  C C asks, or more like tells, Hillary to tag along, as she get to witness C C's star quality, which bedazzles her. T his seems to be the moment when Hillary discovers that C C has confidence to do what she pleases-something that is foreign to her.  However, it is the beginning for a long friendship that seems to be held together through long letters of reciprocal sharing of thoughts and feelings, as the two girls mature into women.The story makes several leaps, as it skips years at a time.  These leaps cause a hurried effect in the story, which do not seem to emphasize the emotional character development.  This hurts the cinematic experience, as story does not offer a genuine feeling for the characters.  Both women seem hollow and empty in their emotional portrayal, which is supposed to be the strength of the film.  To further the lack of emotional quality, the film presents a quantity of cinematic clich&eacute;s that are supposed to provide emotional tension and affection.  Nonetheless, there are moments in the film where the story grabs the audience with heartbreaking and joyous tears.The friendships between C C, a spoiled and ditsy self-centered diva with a Jewish heritage from the Bronx, and Hillary, a well-mannered aristocratic lawyer with a well-established background from outside San Francisco are an unlikely alliance.  These two women beat the odds and remain friends far into adulthood where their friendship gets tested, as their trust and communication are broken leaving them careless of each other.  Nonetheless, it is expected that these two women will mend their friendship, as they go through marriages and divorces and through years of joy and sadness.Beaches offers a melodramatic tale that temporarily displays moments of great drama, but often regresses into the genre of television soap operas.  At times the film seems like the lines were written and never spoken, and at times the characters seem awkward with the lines.  This furthers the difficulty in the film.  In addition, the film plays with the audience's empathetic side, as it purposely manipulates the audience's affection in a crude manner.  This crudeness leaves the audience with moments of tears, yet it also leaves a feeling of having been cheated of genuine emotion.  Despite the poor depiction of the story it offers some valuable lessons worth pondering, which at the end leaves the audience with an ok cinematic experience.",3,Melodramatic Tear Drencher...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,4330,"['Trust', 'communication', 'care', 'are', 'three', 'key', 'ingredients', 'when', 'two', 'individuals', 'form', 'friendship', 'components', 'maintain', 'foster', 'mutual', 'respect', 'understanding', 'Trust', 'two', 'individual', 'ability', 'share', 'secretive', 'personal', 'information', 'limitations', 'fear', 'harm', 'judgment', 'Listening', 'vital', 'portion', 'communication', 'other', 'shares', 'personal', 'information', 'kind', 'communication', 'hard', 'share', 'information', 'difficult', 'form', 'friendship', 'provide', 'best', 'possible', 'attention', 'good', 'communication', 'trust', 'one', 'one', 'cares', 'two', 'individuals', 'care', 'possible', 'most', 'unlikely', 'individuals', 'form', 'improbable', 'friendship', 'C', 'C', 'Bloom', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Hillary', 'Whitney', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'do', 'Beaches.C', 'C', 'performance', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'when', 'message', 'unknown', 'message', 'audience', 'audience', 'can', 'decipher', 'social', 'codes', 'are', 'important', 'C', 'C', 'everything', 'including', 'evening', 'performance', 'order', 'get', 'San', 'Francisco', 'opening', 'audience', 'direction', 'something', 'immediately', 'threatening', 'question', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'important', 'C', 'C', 'everything', 'behind', 'car', 'drive', 'rainstorm', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Two', 'lengthy', 'flashbacks', 'deliver', 'reason', 'why', 'important', 'C', 'C', 'drive', 'storm.The', 'first', 'flashback', 'decades', 'earlier', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'where', 'Hillary', 'lost', 'boardwalk', 'C', 'C', 'hiding', 'order', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'Helpfully', 'C', 'C', 'boardwalk', 'Hillary', 'hotel', 'where', 'staying', 'moment', 'two', 'together', 'C', 'C', 'mother', 'tell', 'received', 'opportunity', 'audition', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'director', 'C', 'C', 'more', 'tells', 'Hillary', 'tag', 'along', 'get', 'witness', 'C', 'C', 'star', 'quality', 'T', 'be', 'moment', 'when', 'Hillary', 'C', 'C', 'confidence', 'do', 'what', 'pleases-something', 'foreign', 'However', 'beginning', 'long', 'friendship', 'be', 'held', 'together', 'long', 'letters', 'reciprocal', 'sharing', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'two', 'girls', 'mature', 'women.The', 'story', 'several', 'leaps', 'years', 'time', 'leaps', 'cause', 'hurried', 'effect', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'emphasize', 'emotional', 'character', 'development', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'story', 'not', 'offer', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'characters', 'women', 'seem', 'hollow', 'empty', 'emotional', 'portrayal', 'supposed', 'be', 'strength', 'film', 'further', 'lack', 'emotional', 'quality', 'film', 'quantity', 'cinematic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'supposed', 'provide', 'emotional', 'tension', 'affection', 'Nonetheless', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'story', 'audience', 'heartbreaking', 'joyous', 'tears.The', 'friendships', 'C', 'C', 'spoiled', 'ditsy', 'self-centered', 'diva', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'Bronx', 'Hillary', 'well-mannered', 'aristocratic', 'lawyer', 'well-established', 'background', 'outside', 'San', 'Francisco', 'are', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'two', 'women', 'beat', 'odds', 'remain', 'friends', 'far', 'adulthood', 'where', 'friendship', 'tested', 'trust', 'communication', 'are', 'broken', 'leaving', 'careless', 'other', 'Nonetheless', 'expected', 'two', 'women', 'will', 'mend', 'friendship', 'go', 'marriages', 'divorces', 'years', 'joy', 'offers', 'melodramatic', 'tale', 'temporarily', 'moments', 'great', 'drama', 'often', 'genre', 'television', 'soap', 'operas', 'times', 'film', 'lines', 'were', 'written', 'never', 'spoken', 'times', 'characters', 'seem', 'awkward', 'lines', 'difficulty', 'film', 'addition', 'film', 'audience', 'empathetic', 'side', 'purposely', 'audience', 'affection', 'crude', 'manner', 'crudeness', 'audience', 'moments', 'tears', 'also', 'feeling', 'having', 'been', 'cheated', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'poor', 'depiction', 'story', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'pondering', 'end', 'audience', 'ok', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Beaches VHS

So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. ""Over the shoulder boulder holders"" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.I've heard ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" the same again.Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo.",4,Over the shoulder boulder holders,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3181,"['will', 'cry', 'anything', 'My', 'Girl', 'Armageddon', 'floor', 'everytime', 'sometimes', 'even', 'cry', 'Neighbours', 'So', 'just', 'knew', 'reading', 'blurb', 'would', 'cry.It', 'amazing', 'days', 'friendship', 'can', 'span', 'three', 'decades', 'so', 'far', 'longest', 'friendship', 'lasted', 'nearly', '10', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'never', 'had', 'serious', 'argument', 'old', 'saying', 'guys', 'jobs', 'etc', 'come', 'go', 'friendships', 'last', 'forever.In', 'friendship', 'age', 'roughly', '11', 'young', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'little', 'actress', 'who', 'CeCe', 'Bloom', '11', 'spitting', 'image', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'poor', 'child', 'got', 'hair', 'wide', 'smile', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'so', 'funny', 'watch', 'shame', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'else', 'mainly', 'voice', 'work', 'now', 'most', 'notably', 'character', 'Extreme', 'Ghostbusters', 'become', 'penpals', 'relationship', 'played', 'out', 'letters', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'film', 'spirals', 'there', 'husbands', 'divorces', 'arguments', 'children.It', 'predictable', 'did', 'find', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'irritating', 'was', ""n't"", 'due', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'played', 'character', 'annoyed', 'was', 'so', 'self', 'centered', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'character', 'was', 'fun', 'kinda', 'sidekick', 'CeCe', 'Barbara', 'actually', 'got', 'collagen', 'injections', 'lips', 'look', 'younger', 'was', 'playing', 'character', 'long', 'period.Of', 'course', 'know', 'Barbara', 'character', 'gon', 'get', 'ill', 'way', 'done', 'very', 'subtle', 'start', 'looking', 'more', 'tired', 'then', 'shocking', 'how', 'manage', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'awful', 'really', 'quickly', 'have', 'say', 'makeup', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'there.The', 'funniest', 'line', 'film', 'title', 'review', 'shoulder', 'boulder', 'holders', 'perfect', 'way', 'describe', 'annoying', 'things', 'called', 'bras.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Wind', 'Beneath', 'My', 'Wings', 'many', 'times', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'song', 'What', 'made', 'bigger', 'difference', 'was', 'watching', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'listening', 'lyrics', 'brought', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'song', 'meaning', 'never', 'got', 'Well', 'was', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'watching', 'alone', 'time', 'cos', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'embarrassing', 'someone', 'see', 'crying', 'way', 'did', 'say', 'Beaches', 'had', 'effect', 'understatement', 'year', 'Even', ""'d"", 'switched', 'off', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'house', 'tears', ""'ll"", 'never', 'hear', 'Wind', 'Beneath', 'My', 'Wings', 'same', 'again.Unfortunately', 'bought', 'bog', 'standard', 'frills', 'DVD', 'not', 'realising', 'was', 'special', 'edition', ""'m"", 'quite', 'happy', 'edition', 'have', ""'d"", 'probably', 'cry', 'extras', 'too.I', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'still', 'force', 'watch', 'Armageddon', 'My', 'Girl', 'now', 'again', 'just', 'love', 'much', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'cry', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'terrific', 'film', 'definitely', 'ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', 'also', 'directed', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'so', 'watch', 'out', 'cameo', 'Hector', 'Elizondo']",Beaches VHS

As one of the characters is a singer, there are some great songs and musical numbers, memorably performed by Bette Midler. The extras include a director's commentary and outtakes as well as on interesting and entertaining interview where Mayim Bialik recalls her experiences of the making of the film (and boy, can she talk). The Barbara Hershey screen test is interesting in that it takes place at locations other than those in the film, thus providing in effect, alternative takes. The packaging is however a let down.

That it was heartbreaking, inspiring, etc. A feel good but also make you cry type of movie.  And of course the rumours were all true, I just barely kept from crying.The movie starts with CC Bloom (Bette Midler) receiving a letter and immediately taking off for places unknown despite having an upcoming show (she's a singer) that night.  As she drives, the movie drifts into flashbacks.The setting appears as a beach and a young girl named Hillary Whitney (Marcie Leeds and then later Barabara Hershey) is lost and can't find her way back to her hotel.  She meets a young CC (Mayim Bialik) who was hiding under the boardwalk smoking and they quickly become fast friends when CC says she'll help her find her hotel.  First though, CC has an audition which Hillary attends and discovers that her new friend is truly talented.  Living on opposite ends of the country, they become pen pals and continue writing to each other for many years until Hillary, now a lawyer, decides she needs a change and runs away to New York where CC, a struggling singer, takes her in.  They become roommates and both start doing what they love, just trying to be happy and enjoying each other's friendship.Turmoil of course comes when they both like the same man and then Hillary's father becomes sick.  After she returns to care for her father they still write, but their lives drift somewhat apart.  Hillary marries her father's lawyer and tries to be happy despite his wandering ways and CC marries her director, who always carried a torch for Hillary and doesn't know what to do with CC's boundless ambition.  CC becomes successful and Hillary a housewife and when they next meet up they find it hard to like the new people each other has become.  They  don't reunite until Hillary finds herself single and pregnant and CC divorced and her star falling.They both, with the help of each other, find their way back to success but then discover that Hillary has caught a rare heart disease.  Her daughter is now older and very high spirited and CC finds it hard to get along with her and wants to be there for her friend.  The three must find ways to deal with Hillary's sickness and remain close while discovering what true friendship is.Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey both do a wonderful job playing the two very different friends in this film.  They both have a lot of character and Bette especially has a vivaciousness that is hard to ignore.  The daughter (Grace Johnston) does an ok job but its hard to recognize her with such acting powerhouses in the movie as well.  The two do a great job of expressing friendship with its ups and downs and how together, two people can be happy and have an everlasting friendship despite their differences.The music in this film was of course wonderful.  Midler has a great voice and her ever popular ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" really steals the show.  It's a well known song and used for a variety of events (we sang it in school when a beloved principal retired) and definitely expresses a lot of emotion.  Hearing it in the proper context with the movie made it that much more poignant.  The other music was good too although I do have to say I didn't care much for the variety type ""show"" that Bette sang and acted to in the movie.There are some hard lessons in this film.  Friends can find it easy to betray each other and after doing so, it takes a lot to repair the friendship.  But it can be done.  Its all about choices and I think the movie does a great job of showing how different choices affect people.The only thing I didn't really like about this movie was CC Bloom some of the time.  I found her younger self obnoxious and couldn't really connect with the older CC Bloom.  I understand that she was supposed to be somewhat self absorbed but that made it hard to understand or relate to her sometimes.  I guess that is just a testament on how well her character was played though and the fact that she had imperfections is a positive.Sad movie, an absolute tear jerker, but worth the watching.  It seems that it would be appropriate for all ages.  I don't see viewers who prefer action or horror type films liking the movie too much, but it is perfect for those who like chick-flicks.Review by M.

It depicts that all friendships aren't perfect, everyone has their differences but that in the end that one special friend will always be there for you.

Bloom (Bette Midler)who develop a life long friendship under the boardwalk in Atlantic city that sees them through their respective good times and rough spots. Yes, it's over acted and full of schmaltz.  Yes, it's terribly contrived and not very realistic. But word to the wise: bring Kleenex in advance.  You'll wind up crying by the end.

Midler gets a chance to sing some truly awful tunes and one real show stopper - &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;.  If you haven't heard it I've one question for you - &quot;What planet have you been living on?&quot;  Yes, the film is maudelin in its premise and execution but the syrup works and has proven to be a highly durable in the intervening decades.Disney Inc. gives us the movie in anamorphic widescreen and that's pretty much it.  While the colors have dated and slightly faded, the transfer is generally smooth throughout, with minimal edge enhancement.  There is no aliasing or fine detail shimmer.  The soundtrack is typical 80's 2.0 surround.  There's some nice spread during the musical sequences but overall this is a very dated sounding soundtrack.  No extras.  Perhaps we'll see this as a Vista Series double disc one of these days.

No director can bring out what she feels more than that first impression she had when she reads the script in deciding whether or not to take the part. Of all the movies she's done there are two that shine through as classics in her pantheon of performances and I would humbly submit that ""The Rose"" is the first and ""Beaches"" is the second.Her participation in picking Mayim Baylik as her 11-year-old younger self was exhausting as Garry Marshall later admitted but Bette is a perfectionist and wanted someone who emulated her as closely as possible when she was that age.I absolutely hate it when someone slams the classification ""chick-flick"" on a movie. Does that mean that every action-adventure is supposed to be for men only? I love a good action-adventure as much as any man does so why can't a man admit that sometimes it's okay to see the softer side of a friendship between women? I know plenty of men who enjoy Beaches and Steel Magnolias. It's ridiculous to classify films as ""chick-flicks"". If anything you can classify Beaches as a ""friendship"" movie that runs deeply into the human condition.It could have become deeply maudlin and caused people to flinch with an almost deadly pain but Garry Marshall's direction coupled with the skillful acting of the ensemble cast caused this story to be crafted into a fine woven fabric like antique tapestry that you just have to own. By the time Hillary Whitney is sitting on the deck at the beach waiting to die and the notes of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" start playing, if you don't feel tears on your cheek then you aren't human. If this is a chick-flick then why is it that a man directed it so skillfully?I remember seeing an interview with Bette Midler at one time that she and Garry Marshall were talking about a sequel to Beaches and how CC Bloom coped with raising Hillary's daughter but I guess that never happened. That's a shame because I would have dearly loved to have seen that.Beaches is a ""must-see"" movie if you want to let out those built-up emotions over a hard month. Your problems will just melt away when you see it and you'll feel better after a good cry whether you're male or female.",5,A Classic Bette Midler Performance,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2267,"['When', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'script', 'head', 'first', 'performance', 'director', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'more', 'first', 'impression', 'had', 'when', 'script', 'deciding', 'not', 'take', 'part', 'movies', 'done', 'are', 'two', 'shine', 'classics', 'pantheon', 'performances', 'would', 'humbly', 'submit', 'Rose', 'first', 'Beaches', 'second.Her', 'participation', 'picking', 'Mayim', 'Baylik', '11-year-old', 'younger', 'self', 'was', 'exhausting', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'later', 'admitted', 'Bette', 'perfectionist', 'wanted', 'someone', 'who', 'emulated', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'when', 'was', 'age.I', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'when', 'someone', 'slams', 'classification', 'chick-flick', 'movie', 'mean', 'action-adventure', 'supposed', 'be', 'men', 'only', 'love', 'good', 'action-adventure', 'as', 'much', 'man', 'so', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'man', 'admit', 'okay', 'see', 'softer', 'side', 'friendship', 'women', 'know', 'plenty', 'men', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Beaches', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'ridiculous', 'classify', 'films', 'chick-flicks', 'anything', 'can', 'classify', 'Beaches', 'friendship', 'movie', 'deeply', 'human', 'condition.It', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'deeply', 'maudlin', 'caused', 'people', 'flinch', 'almost', 'deadly', 'pain', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'direction', 'coupled', 'skillful', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'caused', 'story', 'be', 'crafted', 'fine', 'woven', 'fabric', 'antique', 'tapestry', 'just', 'have', 'own', 'time', 'Hillary', 'Whitney', 'sitting', 'deck', 'beach', 'waiting', 'die', 'notes', 'Wind', 'Beneath', 'My', 'Wings', 'start', 'playing', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tears', 'cheek', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'human', 'chick-flick', 'then', 'why', 'man', 'directed', 'so', 'skillfully', 'remember', 'seeing', 'interview', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'one', 'time', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'were', 'talking', 'sequel', 'Beaches', 'how', 'CC', 'Bloom', 'coped', 'raising', 'Hillary', 'daughter', 'guess', 'never', 'happened', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'dearly', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'that.Beaches', 'must-see', 'movie', 'want', 'let', 'out', 'built-up', 'emotions', 'hard', 'month', 'problems', 'will', 'just', 'melt', 'away', 'when', 'see', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'better', 'good', 'cry', ""'re"", 'male', 'female']",Beaches VHS

I saw this Fabulously Entertaining Tearjerker at the theater, and have rented it at least twice over the years. It's the kind of film that I can embrace myself with emotionally, that's why it's always a touching experience. Anyone who hasn't had enduring friendships and are emotionally ""locked up"" will not like this movie. If you are a fan of Bette like myself and loved her in For The Boys, The Rose, or Stella, then this is a must see. Barbara Hershey is great, but it's ultimately Bette who dominated the viewers with her sassy and funny performance, and of course the songs in this movie, especially The Wind Beneath My Wings have been heard a million times, but it's still one of her best and most beloved!It's a perfect vehicle for Bette to showcase her multi-talent as singer and actress delivering a funny and touching performance. It's so enjoyable to watch her whenever she plays a woman in showbiz. The everlasting friendship between Bette and Barbara Hershey's characters are very real representation of many ordinary lives. It takes a lot of unconditional love, respect, trust, and faith to maintain a long distance friendship for decades. No matter what happened in their lives, they know they would still have each other to share their struggles and happiness. Never let time and distance wash away their best intensions and promises.Throughout this movie, there are many moments of laughters, joy, fabulous singing by Bette, and yes, the reunion to the last days their lives shared together was the the climatic point that will require some tissues to stand by!",5,Touched by the Divine Ms.M !,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,1719,"['Honestly', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'Bette', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'two', 'more', 'stars', 'saw', 'Fabulously', 'Entertaining', 'Tearjerker', 'theater', 'have', 'rented', 'least', 'twice', 'years', 'kind', 'film', 'can', 'embrace', 'emotionally', 'why', 'always', 'touching', 'experience', 'Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'enduring', 'friendships', 'are', 'emotionally', 'locked', 'up', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'Bette', 'loved', 'Boys', 'Rose', 'Stella', 'then', 'must', 'see', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'great', 'ultimately', 'Bette', 'who', 'dominated', 'viewers', 'sassy', 'funny', 'performance', 'course', 'songs', 'movie', 'especially', 'Wind', 'Beneath', 'My', 'Wings', 'have', 'been', 'heard', 'million', 'times', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'beloved', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Bette', 'showcase', 'multi-talent', 'singer', 'actress', 'delivering', 'funny', 'touching', 'performance', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'whenever', 'woman', 'showbiz', 'everlasting', 'friendship', 'Bette', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'representation', 'many', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'lot', 'unconditional', 'love', 'respect', 'trust', 'faith', 'maintain', 'long', 'distance', 'friendship', 'decades', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'lives', 'know', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'other', 'share', 'struggles', 'happiness', 'Never', 'let', 'time', 'distance', 'wash', 'away', 'best', 'intensions', 'promises.Throughout', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'laughters', 'joy', 'fabulous', 'singing', 'Bette', 'yes', 'reunion', 'last', 'days', 'lives', 'shared', 'together', 'was', 'climatic', 'point', 'will', 'require', 'tissues', 'stand']",Beaches VHS
