919063,A3U6ACF89PWAYP,B000A2SYJW,"B. Bratton ""Bren Bratt""","[2, 2]","""Breaking The Silence"" is one of Gong Li's finest works. Li plays the Mother of a hearing-impaired son who wants very much to be ""normal"" and to go to ""normal"" school with other children in his community. Li tries, only in vain, to have her son accepted in the ""normal"" school through recitations with the school Principal, but her son is not accepted. To add to Li's struggles, her son's Father is an unresponsible parent who does very little to help Li as she struggles to make a living and care for a son who has a disability. This film is set in modern-day China and will appeal to anyone who loves Asian cinema and has struggles. Li's coping mechanisms are simply superb.",4,"""Breaking The Silence"" Is Well Heard",1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,676,"['Breaking', 'Silence', 'one', 'Gong', 'Li', 'finest', 'works', 'Li', 'Mother', 'hearing-impaired', 'son', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'normal', 'go', 'normal', 'school', 'other', 'children', 'community', 'Li', 'only', 'vain', 'have', 'son', 'accepted', 'normal', 'school', 'recitations', 'school', 'Principal', 'son', 'not', 'accepted', 'add', 'Li', 'struggles', 'son', 'Father', 'unresponsible', 'parent', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'Li', 'make', 'living', 'care', 'son', 'who', 'disability', 'film', 'set', 'modern-day', 'China', 'will', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'struggles', 'Li', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'are', 'simply', 'superb']",Breaking the Silence

If you don't know her work, start with Red Sorghum in 1987, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, Eros, and Michael Mann's Miami Vice in 2006, among others.  Gong Li attacks roles with total commitment and Breaking the Silence is no exception.

Eyon ""Little Raven""","[0, 0]","Except for the opportunity to watch the great Gong Li endure the most difficult travails, this film has little to offer beyond it's good intentions.The story's premise dramatizes a problem found in many societies -- the denial of parents' of the deafness of their deaf or nearly-deaf children -- and their persistence in having them try to live like hearing people.However, this film doesn't offer much insight into the deaf world. And this mother's struggles aren't too different from poor, single women with normal children. Many scenes wound up being a touch too familiar.I didn't find the first 2/3s of the film involving, sad to say. The dramatic flow didn't kick into gear for me until the latter part of the film. And that was done by making things too dramatic.The movie was filmed to present a dark, hopeless mood -- often at night or in dimly lit rooms -- but I suspect some of the too dark scenes may be due to the transfer to DVD -- but I can't be sure.However, Gong Li can hold any story together. Even those, like this film, that try in vain to make her seem less glamorous than nature made her. She is very proud of her performance in this film -- and she deserves to be. But she's had better roles.",3,Routine struggles,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,1214,"['opportunity', 'watch', 'great', 'Gong', 'Li', 'endure', 'most', 'difficult', 'travails', 'film', 'little', 'offer', 'good', 'intentions.The', 'story', 'premise', 'problem', 'found', 'many', 'societies', 'denial', 'parents', 'deafness', 'deaf', 'nearly-deaf', 'children', 'persistence', 'having', 'try', 'live', 'hearing', 'people.However', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'insight', 'deaf', 'world', 'mother', 'struggles', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'different', 'poor', 'single', 'women', 'normal', 'children', 'Many', 'scenes', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'touch', 'too', 'familiar.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'first', '2/3s', 'film', 'involving', 'sad', 'say', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'did', ""n't"", 'kick', 'gear', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'making', 'things', 'too', 'dramatic.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'present', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'mood', 'often', 'night', 'dimly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'suspect', 'too', 'dark', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure.However', 'Gong', 'Li', 'can', 'hold', 'story', 'together', 'Even', 'film', 'try', 'vain', 'make', 'seem', 'less', 'glamorous', 'nature', 'made', 'very', 'proud', 'performance', 'film', 'be', 'had', 'better', 'roles']",Breaking the Silence
