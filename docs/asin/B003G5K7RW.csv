Only around 1997 would they ever get away with Shaq playing a main role in a film, and despite how badKazaamwas, Warner Bros. thought they would give him another shot as a main character. Even on a shoestring budget, this bombed terribly, and it took thirteen years to re-release this on DVD. That's right, it was finally released on DVD in 2010, and by watching this film, it's easy to see why.Steel was meant to be a adaptation of the DC Comics character John Henry Irons, but the only way this connects to the comic book is Shaq's Superman logo tattoo. Not only that, but it's completely obvious that acting isn't Shaq's forte. I've seen more life in stone carvings than in Shaq, but it's obvious that he's playing the role of his real life self throughout the film. I mean, did the DC version of Irons keep making references to his poor free throws? I didn't think so.Another thing to note is that Shaq doesn't even assume the role of a superhero until the second half of the film, and it's probably for the best, as I've never laughed so hard at a superhero costume since the bat nipples in Joel Schumacher's Batman films. Imagine if RoboCop wore a gimp suit, including the painted rubber mask. Let's not forget that he's just some sluggish moving guy that will get knocked down like a corpse from a gun blast.If Shaq's character wasn't crazy enough, the rest of the cast only adds on to the unintentional hilarity in this film. Annabeth Gish plays the wheelchair bound Susan Sparks, who I swear is far more of a superhero than Shaq will ever be (she even acts better!). Judd Nelson of The Breakfast Club fame runs a gun operation inside a video game arcade manufacturer, having their top customers being from gangs that rob banks while they yell during the process. Then we have Richard Roundtree in one of the most glaring low points in his career, who helps out Shaq by designing a hammer-shaped gun and saying ""I especially like the shaft."" Subtlety didn't take a backseat, it was kicked out of the car in motion, and I swear that over half of the lines were stolen from obvious sources.This is by far one of the biggest superhero duds to date, but I can't come to downright detesting it. It's so terrible that it gave me a great laugh at how cheap everything was set up. Bad jokes, poor character design, and the funniest superhero costume to date, Steel has it all.
