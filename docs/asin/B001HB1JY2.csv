I know alot of people on here are talking about the splicing of his performaces is irritating but I dont see how. The splicing between his different locations of his performances was smooth and unoticeable, no sound crackling and the only way i can tell that the splicing was done is that the background changes, again I dont see how its irritating when ur listening to jokes and his style of delivery reuires u to pay attention to whats being said rather than focusing so much on the visuals. As far as his delivery being the same in a previous review, why would he change about what has clearly made him a succesful comedian?Anyways this DVD is 1000% funny and is a solid buy and well worth the money and like his previous stand up's people will be talking about this performance for years to come.",5,And Another one,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,836,"['Awesome', 'production', 'performance', 'know', 'alot', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'talking', 'splicing', 'performaces', 'irritating', 'dont', 'see', 'how', 'splicing', 'different', 'locations', 'performances', 'was', 'smooth', 'unoticeable', 'sound', 'crackling', 'only', 'way', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'splicing', 'was', 'done', 'background', 'changes', 'again', 'dont', 'see', 'how', 'irritating', 'when', 'ur', 'listening', 'jokes', 'style', 'delivery', 'reuires', 'u', 'pay', 'attention', 'whats', 'being', 'said', 'rather', 'focusing', 'so', 'much', 'visuals', 'As', 'far', 'delivery', 'being', 'same', 'previous', 'review', 'why', 'would', 'change', 'what', 'clearly', 'made', 'succesful', 'comedian', 'DVD', '1000', '%', 'funny', 'solid', 'buy', 'well', 'money', 'previous', 'stand', 'up', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'performance', 'years', 'come']",N/A

This kind of material shows off the genius and creativity of CR. My problem with this show is that he goes on too long about racial issues. The jokes just get too repetitive.

While the location switching isn't too distracting, the sound quality in Johannesburg is lower and kind of doesn't blend in as well with London And NYC. Plus, if it were up to me, I wouldn't switch locations in the middle of a joke. I'd finish a joke in one locationDisc 2 - NYC & HBO Digital copy - 5 stars - He seemed to have the best audience reaction in NYC. The digital copy is easy to use.Disc 3 - London and Johannesburg - 4 stars each. Johannesburg's sound quality was a lot lower than NYC and London and that's what threw me off with the HBO Special. London - He probably got the worst audience reactions from London.Anyways, Chris Rock gives another great performance with Kill the Messenger and for this 3 disc set it a much better way to go simply because all 3 performances are separate and some jokes are extended or not featured in the 1 disc (Also Disc 1 here) HBO special",5,Hilarious as usual,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,1299,"['Kill', 'Messenger', 'Chris', 'Rock', '3', 'performances', '2008', 'Apologies', 'Tour', 'combines', 'one', 'special.While', 'splicing', '3', 'locations', 'Johannesburg', 'NYC', 'London', 'middle', 'joke', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'distracting', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'handy', 'mainly', 'get', '3', 'performance', 'separate', 'spliced', 'HBO', 'special', 'digital', 'copy.Disc', '1', 'HBO', 'Version', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'location', 'switching', ""n't"", 'too', 'distracting', 'sound', 'quality', 'Johannesburg', 'lower', 'kind', ""n't"", 'blend', 'as', 'well', 'London', 'NYC', 'were', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'switch', 'locations', 'middle', 'joke', ""'d"", 'finish', 'joke', 'one', 'locationDisc', '2', 'NYC', 'HBO', 'Digital', 'copy', '5', 'stars', 'seemed', 'have', 'best', 'audience', 'reaction', 'NYC', 'digital', 'copy', 'easy', 'use.Disc', '3', 'London', 'Johannesburg', '4', 'stars', 'Johannesburg', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'lot', 'lower', 'NYC', 'London', 'what', 'threw', 'off', 'HBO', 'Special', 'London', 'probably', 'got', 'worst', 'audience', 'reactions', 'London.Anyways', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'great', 'performance', 'Kill', 'Messenger', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'simply', '3', 'performances', 'are', 'separate', 'jokes', 'are', 'extended', 'not', 'featured', '1', 'disc', 'Also', 'Disc', '1', 'here', 'HBO', 'special']",N/A

The use of three different shows is interesting, but the rapid cuts get old fast and lead to unnecessary confusion.The best performance is clearly at the Apollo, the site of Rock's greatest success, Bigger And Blacker. So why include the Jo'berg and London shows? Just to show he's an international star now? Too bad, because you can hear from his voice that Rock is most comfortable and free--and funny!--at home in NYC. His outfit in each town says it all.When it does pick up, you can see Rock relax and start to really deliver the goods.

Social views. His views on plain old common sense....Whether you agree with his views or not, he'll make you laugh. He might even make you mad with some of his views...but that's the point. Oh, you mean the stuff you agree with is funny, but the stuff that you don't agree with isn't??? C'mon!Rock's 2008 HBO special Kill the Messenger is Chris Rock at his best. Some of the act does seem familiar just because (most of us?) now know his routine so well after so many fine years. You have his previous HBO specials: from ""Big *** Jokes"" 14 years ago when he used to simply ""tell jokes"", to his breakthrough specials starting in 1996 that established Rock for the unique style and delivery that he is now famous for {Bring The Pain(1996),Bigger and Blacker(1999), andNever Scared(2004)}. And of course you also have years and years of TV and movies to go with his signature HBO persona.So, while some of the act may seem a bit familiar, rest assured that the subject matter is fresh. The only annoyance (albeit a slight annoyance) with the Kill the Messenger performance is the 3-venue video splicing presentation. In other words, you'll see Rock start a joke in New York, but then finish it in London or South Africa (not necessarily in that order); this splicing effect was distracting for me, but may not bother you.So do go ahead and hit the buy button for a night of laughs if you didn't have the good fortune to catch this on HBO.
