The first time you see it it may seem really bad but after I watched it a few times I loved it more and more. Sometimes the acting is a little overdone and they did change some details here and there. Ellen Marlow (Claire) was the best actress of them all, she's absolutely perfect as Claire. There were supposed to be sequels of this movie but unfortunately there won't be any more coming out.This movie is a great film to watch with girlfriends- it's very funny and entertaining and is fun to see the book come to life onscreen. Elizabeth McLaughlin and Ellen Marlow were fantastic together. The bonus features are also a great addition to this DVD, there is a blooper reel and featurettes on the costumes.
