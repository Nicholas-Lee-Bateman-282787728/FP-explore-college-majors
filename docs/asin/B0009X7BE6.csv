916076,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0009X7BE6,andy8047,"[1, 3]","This season,we welcome future pop/R&B superstar Janet Jackson to the GOOD TIMES cast. Eleven-year-old Jackson plays Penny,an orphan taken in by the Evans household. James Evans Jr.,or J.J.,(Jimmie Walker) has been ""man of the house"" since the auto accident death of his father James Sr.,portrayed by John Amos. Jackson began her singing career in 1982,but when her CONTROL album,her second,was released in early 1986,she instantly catapulted to superstardom. Jackson's singing career is still going strong today. Although she carries no royal title like her King Of Pop brother Michael,she's one of the all-time greats. The Gary,Indiana native later had a starring role in John Singleton's 1993 film POETIC JUSTICE.

916077,A34DXWXAQPWQ5G,B0009X7BE6,"astrology hound ""&#34;Adrian&#34;""","[11, 13]","I'm a die-hard Good Times fan, but it's hard to completely endorse this season of the show.  It's like the writers just gave up completely.  The jokes are so stale they are almost evil - pure garbage. You really can't imagine people sitting at a typewriter believing anyone would think the jokes are funny - the writers should be ashamed of themselves. When sit-com writing gets this stupid, it sucks at your brain.  There are many disappointments - J.J. trades his dream to become a artist and works at an advertising agency, never to pick up a paint brush again, Michael, our black genius gets a ""D"" on his report card, and as an African American, I'll never understand why a show that makes so many comments on discrimination has so many crude fat jokes. (also see What's Happening.) Bookman was never strong enough to be a main character, but there was really no one else, I guess, to consider.That said, this may still be a ""must buy"" for a few reasons.  One is the early Penny eposides(""The Evans Get Involved"")when Penny is introduced as an abused child.  These episodes do what Good Times does best - poignant dramatic comedy with an edge.  Watching Kit Fields and Janet Dubois' confrontation over her abuse allegations is amazing, and Janet Jackson is heartbreaking when she says to her mother who she is protecting, ""I didn't tell them anything Mama."" I never forgot these episodes when they aired in the seventies and now understand why.Part of the advantage of watching the shows in order by season is that you can see the progress (or decline.) I happen to like Wilona as a lead character and Janet Dubois as a actress definitely has her moments. Some of the situations she's put in are ridiculous, but her acting is strong and it is always touching the way she becomes a mother to Penny.And finally, there is ""Write On, Thelma.""  Thelma is asked by Mr. Nichols to change her play and finally delivers words to live by.  For my family, this was a classic and the DVD was worth it for this episode alone.  When Thelma recites her main character's monologue ""My Daddy Always Told Me......."" it is amazing how John Amos, gone from the show for two seasons, still makes an impact on the viewer's mind as ""James.""Good Times was a complicated show and has been criticized rightly for many reasons.  But I still love it, and James Evans was unprecedented in terms of the presentation of black fathers on television.",3,Compromise to a certain point is surrender...And I'm not changing another word.......,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,2421,"[""'m"", 'die-hard', 'Good', 'Times', 'fan', 'hard', 'completely', 'endorse', 'season', 'show', 'writers', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'completely', 'jokes', 'are', 'so', 'stale', 'are', 'almost', 'evil', 'pure', 'garbage', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'people', 'sitting', 'typewriter', 'believing', 'anyone', 'would', 'think', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'writers', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'When', 'sit-com', 'writing', 'stupid', 'brain', 'are', 'many', 'disappointments', 'J.J.', 'dream', 'become', 'artist', 'advertising', 'agency', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'paint', 'brush', 'again', 'Michael', 'black', 'genius', 'D', 'report', 'card', 'African', 'American', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'comments', 'discrimination', 'so', 'many', 'crude', 'fat', 'jokes', 'also', 'see', 'What', 'Happening', 'Bookman', 'was', 'never', 'strong', 'enough', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'else', 'guess', 'consider.That', 'said', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'must', 'buy', 'few', 'reasons', 'One', 'early', 'Penny', 'eposides', 'Evans', 'Get', 'Involved', 'when', 'Penny', 'introduced', 'abused', 'child', 'episodes', 'do', 'what', 'Good', 'Times', 'best', 'poignant', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'edge', 'Watching', 'Kit', 'Fields', 'Janet', 'Dubois', 'confrontation', 'abuse', 'allegations', 'amazing', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'heartbreaking', 'when', 'mother', 'who', 'protecting', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'Mama', 'never', 'forgot', 'episodes', 'when', 'aired', 'seventies', 'now', 'understand', 'why.Part', 'advantage', 'watching', 'shows', 'order', 'season', 'can', 'see', 'progress', 'decline', 'happen', 'like', 'Wilona', 'lead', 'character', 'Janet', 'Dubois', 'actress', 'definitely', 'moments', 'situations', 'put', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'strong', 'always', 'touching', 'way', 'mother', 'Penny.And', 'finally', 'Write', 'Thelma', 'Thelma', 'asked', 'Mr.', 'Nichols', 'change', 'play', 'finally', 'delivers', 'words', 'live', 'family', 'was', 'classic', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'episode', 'alone', 'When', 'Thelma', 'main', 'character', 'monologue', 'Daddy', 'Always', 'Told', 'Me', 'amazing', 'how', 'John', 'Amos', 'gone', 'show', 'two', 'seasons', 'still', 'impact', 'viewer', 'mind', 'James', 'Good', 'Times', 'was', 'complicated', 'show', 'been', 'criticized', 'rightly', 'many', 'reasons', 'still', 'love', 'James', 'Evans', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'terms', 'presentation', 'black', 'fathers', 'television']",Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season
916078,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0009X7BE6,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","""Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season"" marks two significant changes in the cast this season. The first change is an addition to the cast: Janet Jackson joins the cast as Penny Gordon, who's the central character in the four-part episode ""The Evans Get Involved"". Penny is first seen coming in contact with the Evanses, who become acquainted with Penny & later discover bruises of all sorts on her body. This prompts the Evans family to contact the authorities. It is later discovered that Penny's mother is causing the abuse, so Willona takes steps to adopt Penny. A chilling episode. J.J. & three friends share a car in ""Wheels"", & Penny is caught shoplifting in ""Penny's Christmas"". The other cast change is more significant, as Esther Rolle is absent from the cast this season. Florida & Carl Dixon, a love interest from the previous season, have moved to Arizona due to Carl's health. Ja'Net DuBois' Willona Woods gets bigger roles as a result of Esther's absence, so you could say the addition of Janet Jackson to the cast worked out quite well. Thelma, frustrated over her lack of privacy from her brothers at home, decides to move into a roommate's apartment in ""Thelma Moves Out"", & J.J. is suspicious of Thelma's new boyfriend in ""Thelma's Brief Encounter"". Michael makes friends with a girl in the building via CB radio, & later finds out she has a disability in the episode ""Breaker, Breaker"". Johnny Brown's Nathan Bookman gets a larger role this season as well (no pun intended), as the Evanses scheme to get Bookman fired from his job in ""Bye, Bye Bookman"". Robert Guillaume guest-stars as a neighborhood wino who everyone believes he died in a tragic accident in ""Requiem For A Wino"". Willona is involved in two distinct employment scenarios - in the episodes ""Willona, The Fuzz"" - where she takes a store security job to pay for Penny's skates, & in ""Willona's New Job"" - where her ex-husband arrives in town & has big plans. Along with asking to marry her, he buys Willona's company & becomes her boss. So, there's a lot to choose from this season, although it's a weak season since Esther Rolle's not part of the cast. Many of the episodes feature strong storylines to compensate for this absence - hence the four-star rating. ""Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season"" is still a worthwhile, must-have purchase to add to your DVD collection.R.I.P., Esther Rolle.",4,"The Evanses struggle to ""keep their head above water"" without their matriarch",1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2382,"['Good', 'Times', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'marks', 'two', 'significant', 'changes', 'cast', 'season', 'first', 'change', 'addition', 'cast', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'cast', 'Penny', 'Gordon', 'who', 'central', 'character', 'four-part', 'episode', 'Evans', 'Get', 'Involved', 'Penny', 'first', 'seen', 'coming', 'contact', 'Evanses', 'who', 'become', 'acquainted', 'Penny', 'later', 'discover', 'bruises', 'sorts', 'body', 'Evans', 'family', 'contact', 'authorities', 'later', 'discovered', 'Penny', 'mother', 'causing', 'abuse', 'so', 'Willona', 'steps', 'adopt', 'Penny', 'A', 'chilling', 'episode', 'J.J.', 'three', 'friends', 'share', 'car', 'Wheels', 'Penny', 'caught', 'shoplifting', 'Penny', 'Christmas', 'other', 'cast', 'change', 'more', 'significant', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'absent', 'cast', 'season', 'Florida', 'Carl', 'Dixon', 'love', 'interest', 'previous', 'season', 'have', 'moved', 'Arizona', 'due', 'Carl', 'health', ""Ja'Net"", 'DuBois', 'Willona', 'Woods', 'bigger', 'roles', 'result', 'Esther', 'absence', 'could', 'say', 'addition', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'cast', 'worked', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'Thelma', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'privacy', 'brothers', 'home', 'move', 'roommate', 'apartment', 'Thelma', 'Out', 'J.J.', 'suspicious', 'Thelma', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Thelma', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'Michael', 'friends', 'girl', 'building', 'CB', 'radio', 'later', 'out', 'disability', 'episode', 'Breaker', 'Breaker', 'Johnny', 'Brown', 'Nathan', 'Bookman', 'larger', 'role', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'pun', 'intended', 'Evanses', 'scheme', 'get', 'Bookman', 'fired', 'job', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Bookman', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'guest-stars', 'neighborhood', 'wino', 'who', 'everyone', 'died', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Wino', 'Willona', 'involved', 'two', 'distinct', 'employment', 'scenarios', 'episodes', 'Willona', 'Fuzz', 'where', 'store', 'security', 'job', 'pay', 'Penny', 'skates', 'Willona', 'New', 'Job', 'where', 'ex-husband', 'arrives', 'town', 'big', 'plans', 'asking', 'marry', 'Willona', 'company', 'boss', 'So', 'lot', 'choose', 'season', 'weak', 'season', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'not', 'part', 'cast', 'Many', 'episodes', 'feature', 'strong', 'storylines', 'compensate', 'absence', 'hence', 'four-star', 'rating', 'Good', 'Times', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'must-have', 'purchase', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection.R.I.P.', 'Esther', 'Rolle']",Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season

916082,ALP0JQLQOKXII,B0009X7BE6,Friskie,"[1, 1]","The fifth season pulls you in with the four part story line, ""the Evans Get Involved.""  I was too young to see it when it first aired but it hooked me in from the start.  Janet Jackson fits the role of sweet but troubled Penny and Wilona plays the mother role quite well.  The season contains all sorts of laughs and predicaments as J.J is now the head of the household and has to hold it together.  It would have been more believable though to see an episode where J.J actually gets the job at the ad agency.  As another reviewer commented there were too many fat jokes in this season directed at Bookman and after a while they got stale.  Since the show was about discrimination they sure had no problems attacking other types for a cheap laugh.  The episode where J.J dreams that he has turned white was one of the weirdest ones in the season and it failed to actually make the point it was trying to make.  Another memorable episode is when Wilona is offered a security job but has doubts when she discovers what she actually has to do.  It truly was an episode ahead of its time taking into account all the surveillance cameras in the world today. I have to confess I did enjoy the season very much although I do have one complaint.  In the first season the poverty is very much front and centre but here, one would be hard pressed to say the Evans are suffering in any true sense.  The porridge that was a constant for breakfast in the first three seasons has been replaced by pancakes, eggs and bacon.  Their fridge is now full of ribs, chicken, pork etc...they buy new furniture in this season without a fuss and there are forever going out and taking part in cultural events.  The family in reality is now lower middle class.  They might still live in the projects but so what?  It's also interesting to see all the rich guys that come through Wilona's door.

916092,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B0009X7BE6,The Groove,"[5, 6]","During the 1977-78 season, Florida is on her honeymoon with Carl (in reality, Esther Rolle left the show because she got so fed up with the buffoonery of the JJ character, but she returned the next season), making longtime neighbor Wilona (the superb and multitalented Ja' Net Dubois) the motherly figure of the household. I won't review every episode, but I did highlight a few that stand out:THE EVANS GET INVOLVED (Parts 1-4).  Enter Janet Jackson - before the hit records, the Grammys, and the disastrous ""wardrobe malfunction.""  She plays Penny, a strange yet charming little girl who's abused by her mother (Chip Fields, Kim's mom).  Wilona intervenes and ends up adopting her.  These are some of the most memorable episodes of the entire series.THELMA MOVES OUT  Thelma gets fed up with sharing her pad with her two brothers, so she moves out into her own apartment, which she shares with a nerd, a fat slob, and a flirtatious woman who makes a move on Thelma's man.  The moral to the story?  The grass ain't always greener on the other side.THELMA'S BRIEF ENCOUNTER  Any man who dates you only during lunch hours, won't give out his number, and refuses to invite you to his place is a red flag for trouble.  Thelma learns this the hard way.PENNY'S CHRISTMAS  That Penny girl just can't stay out of trouble.  She gets busted for shoplifting at a department store.  The timing couldn't be any worse, as her adoption is close to being finalized.JJ AND THE BOSS' DAUGHTER  In which JJ learns a valuable lesson: never mix business with pleasure.  He dates a co-worker who is not only his assistant but also his boss' daughter.  Things get messy when she threatens to have him fired after he breaks a date with her.WHERE THERE'S SMOKE The couch is set on fire.  Thelma, JJ, Michael, and Penny all give different versions of the story, but only one is telling the truth.  Guess who?JJ's CONDITION  JJ is stressing and he's getting an ulcer.  Is it because of Thelma's cooking?  Nope, he's dating a woman who's still married to her husband.  Two's company, but three is definitely a crowd.As with the other ""Good Times"" DVDs, there are no extra features.  It would have been nice if they had a documentary or some interviews, but all we get are the episodes and nothing more.  Still, it's a good buy, and some of the season's best episodes can be found here.",4,"""Ain't We Lucky We Got 'Em!""",1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2358,"['1977-78', 'season', 'Florida', 'honeymoon', 'Carl', 'reality', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'left', 'show', 'got', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'buffoonery', 'JJ', 'character', 'returned', 'next', 'season', 'making', 'longtime', 'neighbor', 'Wilona', 'superb', 'multitalented', 'Ja', 'Net', 'Dubois', 'motherly', 'figure', 'household', 'wo', ""n't"", 'review', 'episode', 'did', 'highlight', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'EVANS', 'GET', 'INVOLVED', 'Parts', '1-4', 'Enter', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'hit', 'records', 'Grammys', 'disastrous', 'wardrobe', 'malfunction', 'Penny', 'strange', 'yet', 'charming', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'abused', 'mother', 'Chip', 'Fields', 'Kim', 'mom', 'Wilona', 'intervenes', 'up', 'adopting', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series.THELMA', 'MOVES', 'OUT', 'Thelma', 'fed', 'up', 'sharing', 'pad', 'two', 'brothers', 'out', 'own', 'apartment', 'shares', 'nerd', 'fat', 'slob', 'flirtatious', 'woman', 'who', 'move', 'Thelma', 'man', 'moral', 'story', 'grass', 'ai', ""n't"", 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side.THELMA', 'BRIEF', 'ENCOUNTER', 'Any', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'lunch', 'hours', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'number', 'invite', 'place', 'red', 'flag', 'trouble', 'Thelma', 'hard', 'way.PENNY', 'CHRISTMAS', 'Penny', 'girl', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'trouble', 'busted', 'shoplifting', 'department', 'store', 'timing', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'adoption', 'close', 'being', 'finalized.JJ', 'THE', 'BOSS', 'DAUGHTER', 'JJ', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'never', 'mix', 'business', 'pleasure', 'co-worker', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'assistant', 'also', 'boss', 'daughter', 'Things', 'get', 'messy', 'when', 'have', 'fired', 'date', 'her.WHERE', 'THERE', 'SMOKE', 'couch', 'set', 'fire', 'Thelma', 'JJ', 'Michael', 'Penny', 'give', 'different', 'versions', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'telling', 'truth', 'Guess', 'who', 'JJ', 'CONDITION', 'JJ', 'stressing', 'getting', 'ulcer', 'Thelma', 'cooking', 'Nope', 'dating', 'woman', 'who', 'still', 'married', 'husband', 'Two', 'company', 'three', 'definitely', 'crowd.As', 'other', 'Good', 'Times', 'DVDs', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'get', 'are', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'more', 'Still', 'good', 'buy', 'season', 'best', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here']",Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season
916093,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B0009X7BE6,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","IMO Good Times lost some important steam (and heart) with the departures of mom & dad Evans.  Having series star/ comedian James Walker (&#34;Kid DY!NO!MITE!&#34;) take over as the head of the Evans clan in his lanky heart before head way as opposed to bucking his parent's authority certainly adds a different flavor but the fact that he doesn't have the same resonating authority as his parents is showcased in having neighbor Willona (the lovely Ja'Net Du Bois) stepping in and filling Florida's old shoes as the guiding light of the family.  Bookman (&#34;Buffalo Butt&#34;/ &#34;Booger&#34;) is also given a larger part and more recurring role as he morphs this season from the jawing janitor ready to evict the Evans family every other episode to the jawing janitor who slowly begins to be incorporated into their expanding family as a family friend.  Janet Jackson's Penny character, Willona's daughter, is largely used as slight comic material and mostly wasted this season as is Michael's; so much more could have been done with this young man who has passed from boyhood living in the ghetto now fatherless and motherless.  Still, the series continued to match lighthearted humor with real day-to-day difficulties both economic, social, and interpersonal while showcasing how these issues could be resolved with integrity and strength in suffering.  What a fantastic show.  Is there a show on like this today?For me (a young white boy from the solid middle class in the late 70s/ early 80s growing up in a good neighborhood) Good Times was a much loved show with very real characters who were important to me because they showed me how a poor family could be connected and survive by their deep love, taught me lessons about the importance of standing strong in the face of adversity, and showed me just how decent people can be no matter that they and I look very different on the outside.  (That and I had a crush on Thelma...I mean, c'mon!)  This show was both beloved and held a huge importance for me and so many others in a still then largely white America.Could this show be brought back?  Or would that crack the back of the current interrelated and rainbow diverse zeitgeist, recognizing that not everything is rosy but strong knit families in torn up communities still have something to teach us?",4,The Evans brood plus three.,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2316,"['IMO', 'Good', 'Times', 'lost', 'important', 'steam', 'heart', 'departures', 'mom', 'dad', 'Evans', 'Having', 'series', 'star/', 'comedian', 'James', 'Walker', '34', 'Kid', 'DY', 'NO', 'MITE', '34', 'take', 'over', 'head', 'Evans', 'clan', 'lanky', 'heart', 'head', 'way', 'opposed', 'bucking', 'parent', 'authority', 'certainly', 'different', 'flavor', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'resonating', 'authority', 'parents', 'showcased', 'having', 'neighbor', 'Willona', 'lovely', ""Ja'Net"", 'Du', 'Bois', 'stepping', 'filling', 'Florida', 'old', 'shoes', 'guiding', 'light', 'family', 'Bookman', '34', 'Buffalo', 'Butt', '34', '/', '34', 'Booger', '34', 'also', 'given', 'larger', 'part', 'more', 'recurring', 'role', 'season', 'jawing', 'janitor', 'ready', 'evict', 'Evans', 'family', 'other', 'episode', 'jawing', 'janitor', 'who', 'slowly', 'be', 'incorporated', 'expanding', 'family', 'family', 'friend', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Penny', 'character', 'Willona', 'daughter', 'largely', 'used', 'slight', 'comic', 'material', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'season', 'Michael', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'passed', 'boyhood', 'living', 'ghetto', 'now', 'fatherless', 'motherless', 'Still', 'series', 'continued', 'match', 'lighthearted', 'humor', 'real', 'day-to-day', 'difficulties', 'economic', 'social', 'interpersonal', 'showcasing', 'how', 'issues', 'could', 'be', 'resolved', 'integrity', 'strength', 'suffering', 'What', 'fantastic', 'show', 'show', 'today', 'young', 'white', 'boy', 'solid', 'middle', 'class', 'late', '70s/', 'early', '80s', 'growing', 'up', 'good', 'neighborhood', 'Good', 'Times', 'was', 'much', 'loved', 'show', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'important', 'showed', 'how', 'poor', 'family', 'could', 'be', 'connected', 'survive', 'deep', 'love', 'taught', 'lessons', 'importance', 'standing', 'strong', 'face', 'adversity', 'showed', 'just', 'how', 'decent', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'matter', 'look', 'very', 'different', 'outside', 'had', 'crush', 'Thelma', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'show', 'was', 'beloved', 'held', 'huge', 'importance', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'still', 'then', 'largely', 'white', 'America.Could', 'show', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'would', 'crack', 'back', 'current', 'interrelated', 'rainbow', 'diverse', 'zeitgeist', 'recognizing', 'not', 'everything', 'rosy', 'strong', 'knit', 'families', 'torn', 'communities', 'still', 'have', 'something', 'teach']",Good Times - The Complete Fifth Season
