Beautiful shots of the band in a boat on the river there. Guest performers were Jason Crabb, Larry Gatlin, and The Isaacs. There were a few moments of comedy by Mark Lowry, which is always hilarious. Wes does a beautiful solo. Their a cappella rendition of Low Down The Chariot was flawless. Songs like A Hill Called Mount Calvary, I'm Forgiven, Hide Thou Me were wonderful. The bonus minutes were a conversation between guitarist Kevin Williams and his mother. Very funny.

FORGIVE ME FOR BEING HASTY WITH MY FOUR STARS ON THIS ONE. PERHAPS IT WAS MY PARTIALITY TOWARD DAVID. SERIOUSLY, THEY ARE BOTH GREAT! HOW COULD I HAVE GIVEN ONLY FOUR STARS? BEATS ME.These two DVDs have meant so very much to me. They just get better and better. Wonderful ending. You have to feel good after watching these videos, especially when you share them. God bless the Gaithers and all their helpers, for bringing us such talent, and even more importantly, the messages. Outstanding lyrics are delivered with intense devotion. What could be better?Larry Gatlin is very gracious and funny. The brotherly love is heart warming, because the love shows, and that kind of love comes from two things, I think: from time and from God. There is nothing more comforting than an old friend, and if they share the faith, then that's really special. Yeah, get both of these; you won't be sorry. Yay!
