Anyway, I would have liked to see more of Hattie Jacques but I was glad to see the wonderful Joan Sims who was simply one of the most brilliant and gifted of all British comediennes. Why she didn't get Damehood is beyond me because she simply was brilliant and underestimated. She could play Queen Guinevere, a matronly housekeeper, or a drummer. The laughs are not hard to come by.
