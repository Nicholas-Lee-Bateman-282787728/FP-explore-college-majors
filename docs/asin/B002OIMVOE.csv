Gordon,"[0, 0]","5 part documentary mini-series about the politics of Newark, NJ over the course of 2008, culminating inthe night of Obama's election.The 'star' is Newark's absurdly charismatic mayor Corey Booker, whom the series paints as a man truly ona mission to help his city, without turning him into a one-note saint.Yet, by following several story lines; a young, poor woman trying to get her life together as she movesaway from drugs and gangs and tries to become a force for good despite awful obstacles, the new Directorof the police department who seems very effective, but is fought and resented within the department forcoming from New York, and taking power from the existing Chief of Police, and several other well chosencharacter fighting, each in their own way, for change, we really get a mosaic of a modern city and it's terribleproblems.It has been called a real-life version of 'The Wire' ad nauseum, but that really is good description.There are arguable flaws. It can feel a bit one sided, or at least myopic at times.  Since we usually only followone character in a given situation, it's hard to know what the other side's point of view is. (For example, we sorarely see the Police Director's rival - the Chief- we barely know what he looks like, much less whether he has anyvalidity in his complaints.But I was willing to accept that as part of the nature of the series. It's not meant to be 'fair and balanced', it's astudy of a handful of individuals and their experiences, a group of character studies of people trying to changetheir city, not objective reporting.

As I watched this I was so overwhelmed at what a massive difference just a small handful of people can make in a community. In the case here Newark New Jersey elects an extraordinary visonary mayor to take the the city of New Jersey into a realm of new victories and hope. Mayor Cory Booker aims at reducing gang violence and crime in the city of New Jersey. He has so much energy, drive, and unending ambition to guide New Jersey into a safe and wonderful place to reside. Hes no ordinary mayor, He gets involved and cares about everyone in his community. He is known to make random stops just about anywhere to connect with the people on Newark. He even at one point befriends two young men who threatened to murder him and helps them turn their lives around. He stops by a grocery store and pays for the groceries of a couple who have just lost one of their family members to a gang shooting. He gets involved in every aspect of the city. To the high schools and churches, to the every day man on the street. Hes a compelling human being who managed to reduce violence in Newark by 50 percent in less than 2 years. Within this story are numerous amazing human beings, such as Jada and her boyfriend Creep who have a relationship despite the fact that one of them if a Crip and the other a Blood. Together they build a family, and Jada changes her life around to become an important member of the community. Then there is police director Gary McCarthy who worked hand in hand with booker with the goal of making Newark one of the safest cities in the nation, and by the ned of this story they were well on their way.

1281079,A1A3YJK9IW0OI5,B002OIMVOE,"Richard Hine ""Russell Wiley Is Out to Lunch""","[14, 14]","BRICK CITY is a powerful and compelling documentary series that chronicles several months in the history of Newark, New Jersey as the city tries to reclaim itself, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, and brick by brick, under the leadership of Mayor Cory Booker.  Booker is often compared to Barack Obama and the resistance he faces in Newark in 2008 could easily be compared to the national opposition faced by Obama in 2009.  There are some people who just want him to fail, even if the result of failure is the status quo or worse.The series played out on Sundance Channel over five nights in September 2009.  And the dynamic Booker was just one of the stars.  Directors Mark Benjamin and Marc Levin built the series around several distinct characters, including Police Director Garry McCarthy, Central High School principal Ras Baraka, a young couple Jayda (a Blood) and Creep (a Crip), and a community activist called Street Doctor.As presented in BRICK CITY, Booker's attempts to rejuvenate his city revolve around crime reduction, improved education, urban renewal and economic development.  He's an inspirational personality, but that doesn't mean the whole city is buying into helping him achieve his worthy goals:* Political foes don't like the way he brings in ""outsiders"" to solve the city's problems.  (While you're waiting for the BRICK CITY box set, be sure to watch the brilliant documentary Street Fight: A Film by Marshall Curry about Booker's 2002 mayoral run. It offers an excellent primer on Newark politics.)* Inside the police department, McCarthy faces internal resistance and politicking that challenges his authority, even as the murder rate is plunging 40% or more.* Ras Baraka's dreams of opening the much-delayed $100 million Central High School in time for the new school year are threatened by ongoing construction delays.  (Baraka and his vice principal Todd Warren are two of the show's real-life heroes.)* Meanwhile, Jayda's attempts to rehabilitate her life and create a new mentoring program for at-risk teenage girls become threatened when a crime from her past resurfaces.  Her relationship with Creep also faces challenges, even as the couple face the prospect of bringing a new child into the world.As the economy turns south and the 2008 election approaches, BRICK CITY ultimately becomes a show about the power of individuals to maintain hope and deliver progress in the face of seemingly impossible obstacles. In the midst of it all, and for the first time in years, the circus comes to town, too.Some may say that BRICK CITY wears its political heart too obviously on its sleeve.  The show was clearly created and produced by people who are rooting for Booker to succeed, not fail.  But it still feels honest, at times harsh, and very real.Ultimately, the message is simple: Even in the toughest of situations, rebirth is possible, but the gestation process is lengthy, messy and there's a great deal of kicking and screaming involved.EXTRAS (as seen on TV): Forest Whitaker served as Executive Producer, giving an on-screen introduction to each episode.  After each episode, producer-directors Benjamin and Lucas discussed elements of the series and showed additional mini-stories that didn't fit the ""arcs"" of the show itself.  These ""extras"" are all worth watching by themselves, adding additional layers and interest to the main story, including more footage of some of the major players (e.g. Jayda and Creep) and putting a bigger spotlight on some of the more interesting people we are introduced to during the show, such as author-activist Dashaun Jiwe Morris.",5,"Hope, Hard Work, Heroism, and Heartbreak",1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,3621,"['BRICK', 'CITY', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'series', 'several', 'months', 'history', 'Newark', 'New', 'Jersey', 'city', 'reclaim', 'neighborhood', 'neighborhood', 'block', 'block', 'brick', 'brick', 'leadership', 'Mayor', 'Cory', 'Booker', 'Booker', 'often', 'compared', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'resistance', 'Newark', '2008', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'compared', 'national', 'opposition', 'faced', 'Obama', '2009', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'fail', 'even', 'result', 'failure', 'status', 'quo', 'worse.The', 'series', 'played', 'out', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'five', 'nights', 'September', '2009', 'dynamic', 'Booker', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'stars', 'Directors', 'Mark', 'Benjamin', 'Marc', 'Levin', 'built', 'series', 'several', 'distinct', 'characters', 'including', 'Police', 'Director', 'Garry', 'McCarthy', 'Central', 'High', 'School', 'principal', 'Ras', 'Baraka', 'young', 'couple', 'Jayda', 'Blood', 'Creep', 'Crip', 'community', 'activist', 'called', 'Street', 'Doctor.As', 'presented', 'BRICK', 'CITY', 'Booker', 'attempts', 'rejuvenate', 'city', 'revolve', 'crime', 'reduction', 'improved', 'education', 'urban', 'renewal', 'economic', 'development', 'inspirational', 'personality', ""n't"", 'mean', 'whole', 'city', 'buying', 'helping', 'achieve', 'worthy', 'goals', '*', 'Political', 'foes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'outsiders', 'solve', 'city', 'problems', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'BRICK', 'CITY', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'documentary', 'Street', 'Fight', 'Film', 'Marshall', 'Curry', 'Booker', '2002', 'mayoral', 'run', 'excellent', 'primer', 'Newark', 'politics', '*', 'police', 'department', 'McCarthy', 'internal', 'resistance', 'politicking', 'authority', 'even', 'murder', 'rate', 'plunging', '40', '%', 'more', '*', 'Ras', 'Baraka', 'dreams', 'opening', 'much-delayed', '100', 'million', 'Central', 'High', 'School', 'time', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'are', 'threatened', 'ongoing', 'construction', 'delays', 'Baraka', 'vice', 'principal', 'Todd', 'Warren', 'are', 'two', 'show', 'real-life', 'heroes', '*', 'Meanwhile', 'Jayda', 'attempts', 'rehabilitate', 'life', 'create', 'new', 'mentoring', 'program', 'at-risk', 'teenage', 'girls', 'become', 'threatened', 'when', 'crime', 'past', 'resurfaces', 'relationship', 'Creep', 'also', 'challenges', 'even', 'couple', 'face', 'prospect', 'bringing', 'new', 'child', 'world.As', 'economy', 'south', '2008', 'election', 'approaches', 'BRICK', 'CITY', 'ultimately', 'show', 'power', 'individuals', 'maintain', 'hope', 'deliver', 'progress', 'face', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'obstacles', 'midst', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'circus', 'town', 'too.Some', 'may', 'say', 'BRICK', 'CITY', 'political', 'heart', 'too', 'obviously', 'sleeve', 'show', 'was', 'clearly', 'created', 'produced', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'rooting', 'Booker', 'succeed', 'not', 'fail', 'still', 'honest', 'times', 'harsh', 'very', 'real.Ultimately', 'message', 'simple', 'Even', 'toughest', 'situations', 'rebirth', 'possible', 'gestation', 'process', 'lengthy', 'messy', 'great', 'deal', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'involved.EXTRAS', 'seen', 'TV', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'served', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'giving', 'on-screen', 'introduction', 'episode', 'episode', 'producer-directors', 'Benjamin', 'Lucas', 'discussed', 'elements', 'series', 'showed', 'additional', 'mini-stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'arcs', 'show', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'adding', 'additional', 'layers', 'interest', 'main', 'story', 'including', 'more', 'footage', 'major', 'players', 'e.g', 'Jayda', 'Creep', 'putting', 'bigger', 'spotlight', 'more', 'interesting', 'people', 'are', 'introduced', 'show', 'such', 'author-activist', 'Dashaun', 'Jiwe', 'Morris']",N/A
