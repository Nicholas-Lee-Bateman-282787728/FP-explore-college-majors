The film is an overview on the founding of the event, profiles of dancers and performers. The live music shots are great but should have been a seperate disc of just live music. The crowd and dancer histories were interesting. Overall it was too much detail on things that could have covered their own doc, and not enough music to be a concert film.",3,An Overview but Not an Experience,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,433,"[""'m"", 'not', 'dance', 'music', 'fan', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'EDC', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'film', 'overview', 'founding', 'event', 'profiles', 'dancers', 'performers', 'live', 'music', 'shots', 'are', 'great', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'seperate', 'disc', 'just', 'live', 'music', 'crowd', 'dancer', 'histories', 'were', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'own', 'doc', 'not', 'enough', 'music', 'be', 'concert', 'film']",Electric Daisy Carnival Experience

EDM is coming of age in the USA and this concert is a great demonstration of that fact.

It gives you an inside look at things that happen behind the scenes at one of these festivals and interviews a couple of EDM artists (mainly Kaskade). I wish this documentary moved at a faster pace, but it is a documentary after all. The quality of the film is good, but it isn't blu-ray quality so keep that in mind.I've been to EDC 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and in all honesty 2009 was the best. There's nothing like the feeling of being a part of a 100k person rave at the LA Coliseum (interesting fact: the 1984 Olympic Opening Ceremony was held here).The modern day EDC Vegas is cool, but the crowd is spread out over several massive stages rather than 1 huge stage like at the LA Coliseum so you don't get that same vibe with the crowd. Maybe one day EDC will return to the Coliseum...",5,Great Documentary for EDM Fans,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,847,"['Awesome', 'documentary', 'people', 'scene', 'inside', 'look', 'things', 'happen', 'scenes', 'one', 'festivals', 'couple', 'EDM', 'artists', 'mainly', 'Kaskade', 'wish', 'documentary', 'moved', 'faster', 'pace', 'documentary', 'quality', 'film', 'good', ""n't"", 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'so', 'keep', 'mind.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'EDC', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', 'honesty', '2009', 'was', 'best', 'nothing', 'feeling', 'being', 'part', '100k', 'person', 'rave', 'LA', 'Coliseum', 'interesting', 'fact', '1984', 'Olympic', 'Opening', 'Ceremony', 'was', 'held', 'here', '.The', 'modern', 'day', 'EDC', 'Vegas', 'cool', 'crowd', 'spread', 'out', 'several', 'massive', 'stages', 'rather', '1', 'huge', 'stage', 'LA', 'Coliseum', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'vibe', 'crowd', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'EDC', 'will', 'return', 'Coliseum']",Electric Daisy Carnival Experience

The director not only showed that each and every performer is amazing, but they really were able to show the crowd and how they felt about this music festival. There is no hate, no fights, just love and music. It really shows how the underground house music scene has grown into something, that we can all relate too, almost like, a way of life.This was beyond amazing. I highly recommend, buying and watching over and over and over.-John",5,Amazing film from beginning to end!,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,464,"['was', 'amazing', 'film', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'showed', 'performer', 'amazing', 'really', 'were', 'able', 'show', 'crowd', 'how', 'felt', 'music', 'festival', 'hate', 'fights', 'just', 'love', 'music', 'really', 'how', 'underground', 'house', 'music', 'scene', 'grown', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'almost', 'way', 'life.This', 'was', 'amazing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'watching', 'over.-John']",Electric Daisy Carnival Experience

They have dj's spin records and make wild beats of music that the audience responds to with happiness. They all dress up like a mardi gras, the costumes and make-up are so fun and like a circus that I went to a long time ago with my mom. It is just so well done. The artists are unique and really good at what they do. There are rides and they spin in the electric sky with letting go abandon, spinning with rhythm all around in the sky, in their ears, whats next, listen to more music, dance, spin, eat fun food, watch all the color, be happy.
