NOBODY has this bad of aim. These folks are running right up to each other and missing shots. They could be as close as I am to my laptop right now and STILL miss each other, and when they're not missing shots, they're running out of bullets after shooting once or twice. Does anybody load a full round? Speaking of up close, I don't think there's a woman alive who could look a guy she's had sex with dead in the face and not realize he has a new face. How do you NOT recognize someone you've had sex with? And when they don't know anything about the way you two have sex, why does that not raise a big, HUGE flag? The man even cuddled with her, and she still didn't know. (Maybe at the end of the film she told him she fooled him. I didn't stick around to find out. But if she didn't recognize him, why would you have sex with a man not knowing who in the world he is and why he's faking like he's someone else?!)I do understand that if you described Paul Walker and Jason Lewis in a lineup, they could be mistaken for the same person, but the two do NOT look alike. I can tell one from the other regardless of watching ""Sex and the City"" so I'm watching this film thinking, ""You're kidding me."" How is it not one of these people who knows Bobby Z well can tell the difference in his voice (besides the guy on the boat) or notice he has a whole new face? After an hour I gave up on this film. I just can't do it.Spoiler alert: When you set up a bomb and open the door to blow yourself up, that's it for me. You're dumb and you deserve to be dead (in the film). After I saw that, I stopped the movie.",1,Can't believe this movie is this bad,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1904,"['Paul', 'Walker', 'picked', 'pretty', 'good', 'movies', 'be', 'had', 'confidence', 'world', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'So', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'THIS', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shooting', 'range', 'once', 'life', 'can', 'guarantee', 'have', 'better', 'aim', 'men', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'NOBODY', 'bad', 'aim', 'folks', 'are', 'running', 'right', 'other', 'missing', 'shots', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'am', 'laptop', 'right', 'now', 'STILL', 'miss', 'other', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'shots', ""'re"", 'running', 'bullets', 'shooting', 'once', 'twice', 'Does', 'anybody', 'load', 'full', 'round', 'Speaking', 'close', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'woman', 'alive', 'who', 'could', 'look', 'guy', 'had', 'sex', 'dead', 'face', 'not', 'realize', 'new', 'face', 'How', 'do', 'NOT', 'recognize', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sex', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'way', 'two', 'have', 'sex', 'why', 'not', 'raise', 'big', 'HUGE', 'flag', 'man', 'even', 'cuddled', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'end', 'film', 'told', 'fooled', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'around', 'find', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'sex', 'man', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'world', 'why', 'faking', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'understand', 'described', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'lineup', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken', 'same', 'person', 'two', 'do', 'NOT', 'look', 'alike', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'other', 'regardless', 'watching', 'Sex', 'City', ""'m"", 'watching', 'film', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'kidding', 'How', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'well', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'voice', 'guy', 'boat', 'notice', 'whole', 'new', 'face', 'hour', 'gave', 'up', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.Spoiler', 'alert', 'When', 'set', 'up', 'bomb', 'open', 'door', 'blow', 'up', ""'re"", 'dumb', 'deserve', 'be', 'dead', 'film', 'saw', 'stopped', 'movie']",Bobby Z

1086545,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000SK5Z2A,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Isn't it funny, how the movies you really don't expect much out of, turn out to be the most fun. Bobby Z wasn't something that was high on my list of things to see, but it was streaming and fit my mood, so I watched it and what a surprise, a well written, Action film, with a pretty good plot! Bobby Z is a legendary local crime boss in Southern California. He is a very elusive man that the Mexican drug lords go to extreme measures to find. Don Huertero (Joaquim de Almeida) has kidnapped an FBI agent and will only exchange him for Bobby Z, but there's a problem, Bobby Z is dead. The clever folks at the FBI decide to find someone who looks like Z and send him in, that man is Tim Kearney (Paul Walker), and his life depends on how well he can trick people into believing that he is Bobby Z, a man he's never met. Paul Walker is the star of this clever film and he does a tremendous job. I'm not fan of Walker's, whenever he does anything that isn't a gritty Action film, he stinks, fortunately this is a gritty Action film and he was engaging, delightful, and even funny as he tried to play someone he's not. As for the rest of the cast, it was certainly a unique mix of people, but being centered around one man and one goal, really made it work. It's unusual to find a deep plot in an Action film and that's why this film was so unique. Aside from some terrific stunts and fight scenes, there were twists and turns, crosses and double-crosses, even some humor. Bobby Z was really a lot of fun to watch, and it will keep you guessing while at the same time showing you some terrific action sequences, I was more than impressed by this film and by Paul Walker for that matter. It's easy to say, well he's been playing an undercover agent in The Fast & Furious for a decade now, but it certainly wasn't the same thing. The Death & Life of Bobby Z is a wild ride, that's a lot of fun, and it will keep you guessing, you can't ask for more than that.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,1952,"[""n't"", 'funny', 'how', 'movies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'fun', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'was', 'high', 'list', 'things', 'see', 'was', 'streaming', 'fit', 'mood', 'watched', 'what', 'surprise', 'well', 'written', 'Action', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'plot', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'legendary', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'Southern', 'California', 'very', 'elusive', 'man', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lords', 'go', 'extreme', 'measures', 'find', 'Don', 'Huertero', 'Joaquim', 'de', 'Almeida', 'kidnapped', 'FBI', 'agent', 'will', 'only', 'exchange', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'problem', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'dead', 'clever', 'folks', 'FBI', 'decide', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'Z', 'send', 'man', 'Tim', 'Kearney', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'life', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'trick', 'people', 'believing', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'man', 'never', 'met', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'star', 'clever', 'film', 'tremendous', 'job', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Walker', 'whenever', 'anything', ""n't"", 'gritty', 'Action', 'film', 'fortunately', 'gritty', 'Action', 'film', 'was', 'engaging', 'delightful', 'even', 'funny', 'tried', 'play', 'someone', 'not', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'certainly', 'unique', 'mix', 'people', 'being', 'centered', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'goal', 'really', 'made', 'work', 'unusual', 'find', 'deep', 'plot', 'Action', 'film', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'unique', 'Aside', 'terrific', 'stunts', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'twists', 'turns', 'crosses', 'double-crosses', 'even', 'humor', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'was', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'film', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'matter', 'easy', 'say', 'well', 'been', 'playing', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'decade', 'now', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'Death', 'Life', 'Bobby', 'Z', 'wild', 'ride', 'lot', 'fun', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more']",Bobby Z

While it's no worse than much of the action movie junk that makes it to theatres, Bobby Z, originally entitled The Death and Life of Bobby Z, is a action thriller with Tim Kearney (Walker) as the hero.
