326793,ANY46RC9MF6DB,6302662478,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[2, 2]","This is the best movie version of the Ted Bundy story.  Watching it, I kept thinking that it's a shame that the movie wasn't based on Ann Rule's Book, the best book on the subject, until I learned that there was a movie based on her book that didn't do as well as this movie.Richard Larsen, who wrote the book on which the film is based, was a Seattle Times reporter in 1980.  The made for TV movie, which came out in 1986 was, according to Polly Nelson one of Bundy's lawyers ""stunningly accurate"" although most victims names have been changed, and because of time constraints, many of Bundy's crimes have been omittedThough the movie depicts the crimes accurately, it shows the Seattle investigation consisting of the Seattle police simply sitting at their desks repeating the names of the victims, which aren't even their real names. Not much happens until the department acquires a primitive computer, which punches up Bundy's name at the right moment. This actually occurred. But for true crime aficionados, the portrayal of the police work is kind of a let down.The other cornball device is that each victim turns to wave goodbye to someone before they go to die.Larsen, the author, seems to be involved in the police investigations more than I think would be allowed.  That's when I began to long for Ann Rule, but the movie gets going when it reaches Salt Lake City.  Here we have a tough policeman partnered with a cynical detective who trail Bundy and who actually engage in police work.Mark Harmon does a great job.  This man who has been married to Pam Dawber since March 21, 1987 (in Hollywood, yet) plays a first rate lady killer.  He also plays the killer in the excellent,  ""And Never Let Her Go"" another made for TV movie, which was based on an Ann Rule book.",4,Bundy Still Sends Chills,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1776,"['best', 'movie', 'version', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'story', 'Watching', 'kept', 'thinking', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'Book', 'best', 'book', 'subject', 'learned', 'was', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'movie.Richard', 'Larsen', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'was', 'Seattle', 'Times', 'reporter', '1980', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1986', 'was', 'according', 'Polly', 'Nelson', 'one', 'Bundy', 'lawyers', 'stunningly', 'accurate', 'most', 'victims', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'time', 'constraints', 'many', 'Bundy', 'crimes', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'crimes', 'accurately', 'Seattle', 'investigation', 'consisting', 'Seattle', 'police', 'simply', 'sitting', 'desks', 'repeating', 'names', 'victims', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'real', 'names', 'Not', 'much', 'happens', 'department', 'primitive', 'computer', 'up', 'Bundy', 'name', 'right', 'moment', 'actually', 'occurred', 'true', 'crime', 'aficionados', 'portrayal', 'police', 'work', 'kind', 'let', 'down.The', 'other', 'cornball', 'device', 'victim', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'someone', 'go', 'die.Larsen', 'author', 'be', 'involved', 'police', 'investigations', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'when', 'began', 'long', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'movie', 'going', 'when', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Here', 'have', 'tough', 'policeman', 'partnered', 'cynical', 'detective', 'who', 'trail', 'Bundy', 'who', 'actually', 'engage', 'police', 'work.Mark', 'Harmon', 'great', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'Pam', 'Dawber', 'March', '21', '1987', 'Hollywood', 'yet', 'first', 'rate', 'lady', 'killer', 'also', 'killer', 'excellent', 'Never', 'Let', 'Her', 'Go', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'book']",The Deliberate Stranger VHS

It is thorough, and provides  glimpses into the lives of those who knew and loved Ted before they became aware he was a cold-blooded killer. What impressed me most, besides the superb acting skills of Mark Harmon, was the view we were allowed to have of the families and the  victims.  Too often they are forgotton, but this movie touches it all.  I love the narration, and hearing the story through the eyes of this well-known reporter.  Always on the edge of your seat till the end of the movie, it does not disappoint!

326795,A2IAR5XDY0KT2F,6302662478,Becky,"[12, 15]","This is undoubtedly the finest performance of Mark Harmon's career, as he more than adequately steps into the shoes to play the part of Ted Bundy, probably the most notorious serial killer of the twentieth century.  He  effortlessly captures Bundy's on the surface boyish charm, explaining to  the viewers why Bundy's protestations of innocence were able to fool so  many people for so long, and also how he was able to lure his unsuspecting  victims to their ultimate fate.  Masters, Forrest, Walsh, and Ashton are  also excellent as the frustrated detectives who spent years following  Bundy's trail of death around the United States.  Thankfully, this movie  spares the viewers the grisly details of how the murders occurred, but the  non exploitive way in which it deals with Bundy's destruction of so many  lives is what truly makes this movie shine.  It runs for over three hours  and we all know what happened to Bundy in the end, but this fact is diluted  by the way the excellent script and acting weaves a web of suspense and  intrigue which is enthralling to the very end.  I can guarantee two things  - that whoever watches this mini series will never forget it, and they will  forever speculate as to the true tally of lives that Bundy took, a tally  which he carried with him to the grave.",5,Eerie and Creepy,961027200,"06 15, 2000",2000,1303,"['undoubtedly', 'finest', 'performance', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'career', 'more', 'adequately', 'steps', 'shoes', 'play', 'part', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'probably', 'most', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'twentieth', 'century', 'effortlessly', 'Bundy', 'surface', 'boyish', 'charm', 'explaining', 'viewers', 'why', 'Bundy', 'protestations', 'innocence', 'were', 'able', 'fool', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'long', 'also', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'lure', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Masters', 'Forrest', 'Walsh', 'Ashton', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'frustrated', 'detectives', 'who', 'spent', 'years', 'following', 'Bundy', 'trail', 'death', 'United', 'States', 'Thankfully', 'movie', 'viewers', 'grisly', 'details', 'how', 'murders', 'occurred', 'non', 'exploitive', 'way', 'Bundy', 'destruction', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'what', 'truly', 'movie', 'shine', 'three', 'hours', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Bundy', 'end', 'fact', 'diluted', 'way', 'excellent', 'script', 'acting', 'weaves', 'web', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'enthralling', 'very', 'end', 'can', 'guarantee', 'two', 'things', 'whoever', 'mini', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'will', 'forever', 'speculate', 'true', 'tally', 'lives', 'Bundy', 'took', 'tally', 'carried', 'grave']",The Deliberate Stranger VHS

The movie didn't have much gore and focused quite a bit on the police working the Bundy case as well as Bundy.  The police and Bundy seemed to share time.  It got a bit boring watching the police scratch their heads in every other scene.

326797,A3ER1T6KE2T7AW,6302662478,"Cathy ""honest_cmd""","[8, 8]","I would say this television movie is a must see for anyone interested in the life and ""career"" of serial killer Ted Bundy.  Mark Harmon does a very respectable job of portraying a man who is charming, intellectual, romantic, charismatic, intellectual, and digustingly despicable, all at the same time.You must keep in mind that this movie was made in 1986, and for television.  Because of that, it does not display the violence of Bundy's story the way movies today (in the 21st century) are likely to portray violence.  Still, the graphic violence really isn't needed in this case.  Bundy's story is really a tale of a life full of potential gone incredibly wrong.  ""The Deliberate Stranger"" captures that theme very well, and Harmon portrays Bundy with a personality (and sickness) that has you glued to the screen.In terms of accuracy, I would say this TV movie is 95% right on.  It is perfectly understandable that the names of the victims were changed (for the most part), but the circumstances of their crimes were not.  I would recommend reading Larsen's book of the same name or Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me"" before viewing the movie.  Trust me, you will be able to relate all the ficitious names in the movie to the real life victims and circumstances.  Some of the scenes are so close to the real facts that it is chilling.There have been several movies about Bundy in the years since ""The Deliberate Stranger"" was produced in 1986.  I would still recommend this one above all the others.  Again, you need to keep in mind that it was made for television and the year in which it was made, but even still, it is a compelling portrayal of the events as they unfolded.  If you are simply looking for blood and guts, this is not the version for you, but if you are looking for a multidimensional look at the man -- Theodore Robert Bundy -- you will be quite happy with this version and with Harmon's portrayal.Keep in mind that this movie was made within a decade of the actual events.  So far, it is as close to the real life facts as I've ever seen in a dramatic presentation of Bundy's life.  I'm still hoping for a *quality* feature film on Ted Bundy.  If done right, and with the proper budget (and talented actors), I think that type of film could be an Oscar winner.  Until then, Mark Harmon's television Bundy stands up quite well.  Get it.  Watch it.  This fascinating, compelling, and tragic tale of wasted potential and lives ended too soon never goes out of style.  You will be riveted.  Its one major shortcoming is that is was filmed (and completed) three years before Bundy's real life tale finally came to an end -- in the electric chair at Florida State Prison.  If only there could be an *afterward* to television movies.",4,The Deliberate Stranger,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2751,"['would', 'say', 'television', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'life', 'career', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'very', 'respectable', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'charming', 'intellectual', 'romantic', 'charismatic', 'intellectual', 'digustingly', 'despicable', 'same', 'time.You', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'television', 'not', 'display', 'violence', 'Bundy', 'story', 'way', 'movies', 'today', '21st', 'century', 'are', 'likely', 'portray', 'violence', 'Still', 'graphic', 'violence', 'really', ""n't"", 'needed', 'case', 'Bundy', 'story', 'really', 'tale', 'life', 'full', 'potential', 'gone', 'incredibly', 'wrong', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'theme', 'very', 'well', 'Harmon', 'Bundy', 'personality', 'sickness', 'glued', 'screen.In', 'terms', 'accuracy', 'would', 'say', 'TV', 'movie', '95', '%', 'right', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'names', 'victims', 'were', 'changed', 'most', 'part', 'circumstances', 'crimes', 'were', 'not', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'Larsen', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'Stranger', 'Beside', 'Me', 'viewing', 'movie', 'Trust', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'ficitious', 'names', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'victims', 'circumstances', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'real', 'facts', 'chilling.There', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'movies', 'Bundy', 'years', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'was', 'produced', '1986', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'one', 'others', 'Again', 'need', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'year', 'was', 'made', 'even', 'still', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'events', 'unfolded', 'are', 'simply', 'looking', 'blood', 'guts', 'not', 'version', 'are', 'looking', 'multidimensional', 'look', 'man', 'Robert', 'Bundy', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'happy', 'version', 'Harmon', 'portrayal.Keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'decade', 'actual', 'events', 'So', 'far', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'facts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'Bundy', 'life', ""'m"", 'still', 'hoping', '*quality*', 'feature', 'film', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'done', 'right', 'proper', 'budget', 'talented', 'actors', 'think', 'type', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'then', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'television', 'Bundy', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'Get', 'Watch', 'fascinating', 'compelling', 'tragic', 'tale', 'wasted', 'potential', 'lives', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'never', 'style', 'will', 'be', 'riveted', 'one', 'major', 'shortcoming', 'was', 'filmed', 'completed', 'three', 'years', 'Bundy', 'real', 'life', 'tale', 'finally', 'came', 'end', 'electric', 'chair', 'Florida', 'State', 'Prison', 'only', 'could', 'be', '*afterward*', 'television', 'movies']",The Deliberate Stranger VHS

In this case, the two main ones are played by Frederick Forest (""Apocalypse Now"") and John Ashton (""Midnight Run""). Since it was made for television in the 1980s, the movie has little profanity and blood.Most of the time, the violence is implied. It's still chilling in parts. We don't always need CSI-type blood and guts to get the point.What they missed, however, was WHY Bundy did the things he did. They had time to develop that angle, but never touched it. Supposedly, violent pornography had something to do with his behavior, but nothing was explored in this film.

The movie opens with what I can only assume is the stalking of Georgeann Hawkins; I say ""assume"" because none of the victims are called by their true names---with the notable exception of Denise Naslund (and her mother Eleanor Rose), one of the Lake Sam victims.Bundy's earlier victims (Lynda Healy, Susan Rancourt, Donna Manson, and Brenda Ball, among others) are barely mentioned. Details of the Utah and Colorado murders (Melissa Smith, Laura Aime, and Caryn Campbell) are mixed up with other victims or just plain wrong. I found this distracting, as I caught myself spending time trying to figure out which pseudonym belonged to which victim.Robert Keppel, also called by his real name, gives some interest to the story as we follow his efforts to not only catch Bundy, but to establish a computer database to store, sort, and cross-index all the crime data, which did eventually help lead to Bundy's capture, and was the forerunner of the FBI's VICAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) database of today.Mark Harmon's performance was good, although he does seem a little too wholesome for the role.If you're interested in this movie to learn more about Ted Bundy (as I was), I would recommend instead A&E;'s Biography, or reading Ann Rule's ""The Stranger Beside Me"" or Michaud & Aynesworth's ""The Only Living Witness.""",2,"If you're looking for accurate info on Bundy, don't bother",980726400,"01 29, 2001",2001,1411,"['read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'got', 'so', 'excited', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'stalking', 'Georgeann', 'Hawkins', 'say', 'assume', 'none', 'victims', 'are', 'called', 'true', 'names', '-with', 'notable', 'exception', 'Denise', 'Naslund', 'mother', 'Eleanor', 'Rose', 'one', 'Lake', 'Sam', 'victims.Bundy', 'earlier', 'victims', 'Lynda', 'Healy', 'Susan', 'Rancourt', 'Donna', 'Manson', 'Brenda', 'Ball', 'others', 'are', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'Details', 'Utah', 'Colorado', 'murders', 'Melissa', 'Smith', 'Laura', 'Aime', 'Caryn', 'Campbell', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'other', 'victims', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'found', 'distracting', 'caught', 'spending', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'pseudonym', 'belonged', 'victim.Robert', 'Keppel', 'also', 'called', 'real', 'name', 'interest', 'story', 'follow', 'efforts', 'not', 'only', 'catch', 'Bundy', 'establish', 'computer', 'database', 'store', 'sort', 'cross-index', 'crime', 'data', 'did', 'eventually', 'help', 'lead', 'Bundy', 'capture', 'was', 'forerunner', 'FBI', 'VICAP', 'Violent', 'Criminal', 'Apprehension', 'Program', 'database', 'today.Mark', 'Harmon', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'wholesome', 'role.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'movie', 'learn', 'more', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'was', 'would', 'recommend', 'instead', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'reading', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'Stranger', 'Beside', 'Me', 'Michaud', 'Aynesworth', 'Only', 'Living', 'Witness']",The Deliberate Stranger VHS

The 1980s-1990s was the best and last decades for making true story cases brought to film. LMN is doing a horrible job in every true life film from their own production unit. The 1980s and 1990s featured directors, writers and actors who were mature and well casted (not for ones looks) but for the accuracy in portraying films based on true stories and I can appreciate that. The emphasis on the films of 80s and 90s were taken very seriously and were well paced. The true stories today are very cheap looking, the casting is so very poor that they will choose anyone based on looks and being worried of which audience will watch a good film.I truly and strongly suggest that they DO NOT re-make this one as it was well directed and well casted. The producers and directors do not have the same vision and quality of story telling as did in the 80s and 90s. This feature is LONG gone. I grew up as a young person in the 80s and as young people, we respected the adult themes and were not looking for gore as today's immature audience.

This film is one of many biopics about real-life serial killer Ted Bundy, who met his fate in Florida's electric chair in 1989 after having murdered thirty or more women.  Mr. Harmon plays the man as a suave, polite, charming, clean-cut young man who had the capability to lure his victims into his traps.  That was when his murderous rage set in and that was frightening to see from the charming man I had just described.  So another point for Mr. Harmon.  He plays Bundy just so that, despite all the man's ""positive"" attributes, we can never truly get on his side for we know him for the monster he truly is.

His innocent sweet, next door neighbor looks do not lend any menace at all; but maybe that was what made Bundy so successful in his ability to pick up these girls.
