675540,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B00005QTA2,Charismatic Creature,"[6, 10]","The only interesting thing anyone can note about &quot;Princess of Thieves&quot; is the filmmakers savvy in casting soon-to-be famous Keira Knightley in the lead role. God knows, she's stunningly beautiful, oozing star quality from every pore (not unlike an early Julia Roberts) and shown here at only 15, she has a lot of poise and screen presence.But this is the kind of children's film -- presumably made FOR girls -- that I absolutely detested as a child, and I think most pre-teen and adolescent girls would ultimately feel the same way. It sets up a scenario where you THINK you are going to see a high-spirited and adventuresome girl actually getting to ride horses/shoot arrows/fight etc....but what you actually end up with is a super-pretty model-type actress who wears mascara and lip gloss in Sherwood Forest, has a perfect fashion model figure and doesn't actually get to do much in the way of action. Much of the movie's action scenes (and plot) surround Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) or other characters. The thrust of the plot surrounds not Gwyn's own adventures, but her desire to be with her mostly absentee Dad. Very wholesome, but not very interesting.Obviously this was made for TV or cable and it has a painfully low budget look, with most of the movie shot in close ups (eliminating the need for much in the way of extras or sets). The quality and staging of the fight scenes and archery is especially lame and unprofessional looking. But the lameness is evident in other ways that are really unnecessary, even from a $$ point of view: such as when Gwyn decides to disguise herself as a boy, she has to cut her hair. It appears that Ms. Knightley's own hair at this point was cut in a chin-length bob. So when her character first appears with long hair, we can assume it's hair extensions...therefore, it shouldn't pose any problem to actually SHOW her cutting her (fake) hair! But the director skips this pivotal scene (showing the character transforming from girl to &quot;boy&quot;) and just lets us see the strands of hair hitting the floor.I feel a bit mean-spirited picking on a movie so obviously simple and low budget, as they obviously didn't have a lot of resources to work with. But there is a real need for adventure films for girls, and this is just so bland, disappointing, and utterly without personality or viewpoint.Only worthwhile for die-hard Keira Knightley fans, who'd like an early look at her, pre-fame.",2,"Tired, low-budget, limp children's flick",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2446,"['only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'anyone', 'can', 'note', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Thieves', 'quot', 'filmmakers', 'savvy', 'casting', 'soon-to-be', 'famous', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'lead', 'role', 'God', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'oozing', 'star', 'quality', 'pore', 'not', 'early', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'shown', 'here', 'only', '15', 'lot', 'poise', 'screen', 'presence.But', 'kind', 'children', 'film', 'presumably', 'made', 'FOR', 'girls', 'absolutely', 'detested', 'child', 'think', 'most', 'pre-teen', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'would', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'up', 'scenario', 'where', 'THINK', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'high-spirited', 'adventuresome', 'girl', 'actually', 'getting', 'ride', 'horses/shoot', 'arrows/fight', 'etc', 'what', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'super-pretty', 'model-type', 'actress', 'who', 'mascara', 'lip', 'gloss', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'perfect', 'fashion', 'model', 'figure', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'do', 'much', 'way', 'action', 'Much', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'plot', 'surround', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'other', 'characters', 'thrust', 'plot', 'not', 'Gwyn', 'own', 'adventures', 'desire', 'be', 'mostly', 'Dad', 'Very', 'wholesome', 'not', 'very', 'interesting.Obviously', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'cable', 'painfully', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'most', 'movie', 'shot', 'close', 'ups', 'eliminating', 'need', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'sets', 'quality', 'staging', 'fight', 'scenes', 'archery', 'especially', 'lame', 'unprofessional', 'looking', 'lameness', 'evident', 'other', 'ways', 'are', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'even', 'point', 'view', 'such', 'when', 'Gwyn', 'disguise', 'boy', 'cut', 'hair', 'Ms.', 'Knightley', 'own', 'hair', 'point', 'was', 'cut', 'chin-length', 'bob', 'So', 'when', 'character', 'first', 'long', 'hair', 'can', 'assume', 'hair', 'extensions', 'therefore', 'should', ""n't"", 'pose', 'problem', 'actually', 'SHOW', 'cutting', 'fake', 'hair', 'director', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'showing', 'character', 'transforming', 'girl', 'quot', 'quot', 'just', 'lets', 'see', 'strands', 'hair', 'hitting', 'floor.I', 'feel', 'bit', 'mean-spirited', 'picking', 'movie', 'so', 'obviously', 'simple', 'low', 'budget', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'resources', 'work', 'real', 'need', 'adventure', 'films', 'girls', 'just', 'so', 'bland', 'disappointing', 'utterly', 'personality', 'viewpoint.Only', 'worthwhile', 'die-hard', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'fans', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'early', 'look', 'pre-fame']",Princess of Thieves
675541,AB34G6VKP28L,B00005QTA2,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Tales have long been told of the noble thief Robin Hood and his love for Maid Marion... but few know of the child that was given them. The importance of an heir is vast, and Prince John orders the sheriff to place a bounty on the child's head at its birth double to that of the father. But when the Sheriff of Nottingham learns that the child is a girl, the bounty is dropped... and Gwen is forgotten.Raised in the monastery of Fryer Tuck, Gwen (Keira Knightley) is a strong-willed young woman with very black and white views of the world. Largely ignored by her father (Stuart Wilson) due to her gender, her only companionship is found in the young novice Froderick. But even his sweet temperament and eager-to-please mentality cannot repair her grievous relationship with Robin Hood. The daring outlaw is in Jerusalem, fighting with King Richard. But when a war wound leaves the king close to death, Robin must return and see his illegitimate son Philip (Stephen Moyer) to the throne... before the King's tyrannical brother Prince John (Jonathan Hyde) is crowned. Her patriotism running strong, mingled with desperation to appear in her father's eyes worthy, Gwen pleads with him to allow her to accompany the Merry Men on this quest. But Robin is adamant that it is no place for a young woman, and sets out the following day, leaving a sullen daughter behind. In the meantime, Prince John has sent out an order that Philip is not to arrive in England alive and the prince's valet is mistakenly murdered. Philip is alone and lost in England. And Gwen is determined to impress her father... even if she must masquerade as a young man to do it. Eventually their paths will collide and it will be up to Gwen to see the young man upon the throne... and to save her father from death.Overly predictable, Princess of Thieves is at most an entertaining check-your-brain-at-the-door flick perfect for teenagers seeking an alternative to the male-dominated world of Robin Hood. Gwen is a lot of fun, from her spirited verbal tousles with anyone willing to debate to her obviously incredible archery skills and her kind heart. Froderick is at times funny... and in other instances, cringingly immature. And Philip? Well, Philip is the expected ""Please don't crown me"" monarch who would much rather live a simple life. As everyone knows she will, Gwen talks him into the job by pointing out how terribly the people have been treated under Prince John's reign. Thus said, although the film is a nice little production with reasonably good values and a couple of attached moral lessons, there is nothing very original. The script writers pretty much borrowed off the Robin Hood plight that's been seen and done before... the archery tournament... the evil Sheriff... the tyrannical Prince John... And the Philip-Gwen struggle is pretty much the Prince Henry-Danielle debate from Ever After : a selfish, spoiled monarch who is brought around by a poor but sensible young woman. Really the only originality is the untypical ending that closes on a bittersweet note.The acting is praiseworthy although I had a bit of difficulty accepting Stuart Wilson as Robin Hood. He's a very amiable actor and is by far the best in the slew of embarrassingly-bad swordfighters in the film. The only truly great actress in the bunch is young Kiera Knightley herself. Yes, it's predictable and it wouldn't have held up in a run at the box office, but it is an entertaining and almost-innocent way to spend two hours if you like a good adventure, a bit of romance, and a girl that lets it be known that gender has nothing to do with talent or ability. This is one Princess that stands on her own two feet.",4,"family-oriented, feminist twist on Robin Hood",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3675,"['Tales', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'told', 'noble', 'thief', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'love', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'few', 'know', 'child', 'was', 'given', 'importance', 'heir', 'vast', 'Prince', 'John', 'orders', 'sheriff', 'place', 'bounty', 'child', 'head', 'birth', 'double', 'father', 'when', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'child', 'girl', 'bounty', 'dropped', 'Gwen', 'forgotten.Raised', 'monastery', 'Fryer', 'Tuck', 'Gwen', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'strong-willed', 'young', 'woman', 'very', 'black', 'white', 'views', 'world', 'Largely', 'ignored', 'father', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'due', 'gender', 'only', 'companionship', 'found', 'young', 'novice', 'Froderick', 'even', 'sweet', 'temperament', 'eager-to-please', 'mentality', 'can', 'not', 'repair', 'grievous', 'relationship', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'daring', 'outlaw', 'Jerusalem', 'fighting', 'King', 'Richard', 'when', 'war', 'wound', 'king', 'close', 'death', 'Robin', 'must', 'return', 'see', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Philip', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'throne', 'King', 'tyrannical', 'brother', 'Prince', 'John', 'Jonathan', 'Hyde', 'crowned', 'patriotism', 'running', 'strong', 'mingled', 'desperation', 'appear', 'father', 'eyes', 'worthy', 'Gwen', 'allow', 'accompany', 'Merry', 'Men', 'quest', 'Robin', 'adamant', 'place', 'young', 'woman', 'out', 'following', 'day', 'leaving', 'sullen', 'daughter', 'meantime', 'Prince', 'John', 'sent', 'out', 'order', 'Philip', 'not', 'arrive', 'England', 'alive', 'prince', 'valet', 'mistakenly', 'murdered', 'Philip', 'alone', 'lost', 'England', 'Gwen', 'determined', 'impress', 'father', 'even', 'must', 'masquerade', 'young', 'man', 'do', 'Eventually', 'paths', 'will', 'collide', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'Gwen', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'throne', 'save', 'father', 'death.Overly', 'predictable', 'Princess', 'Thieves', 'most', 'entertaining', 'check-your-brain-at-the-door', 'flick', 'perfect', 'teenagers', 'seeking', 'alternative', 'male-dominated', 'world', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Gwen', 'lot', 'fun', 'spirited', 'verbal', 'tousles', 'anyone', 'willing', 'debate', 'obviously', 'incredible', 'archery', 'skills', 'kind', 'heart', 'Froderick', 'times', 'funny', 'other', 'instances', 'cringingly', 'immature', 'Philip', 'Well', 'Philip', 'expected', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'crown', 'monarch', 'who', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'everyone', 'will', 'Gwen', 'job', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'terribly', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'Prince', 'John', 'reign', 'Thus', 'said', 'film', 'nice', 'little', 'production', 'reasonably', 'good', 'values', 'couple', 'attached', 'moral', 'lessons', 'nothing', 'very', 'original', 'script', 'writers', 'pretty', 'much', 'borrowed', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'plight', 'been', 'seen', 'done', 'archery', 'tournament', 'evil', 'Sheriff', 'tyrannical', 'Prince', 'John', 'Philip-Gwen', 'struggle', 'pretty', 'much', 'Prince', 'Henry-Danielle', 'debate', 'Ever', 'selfish', 'spoiled', 'monarch', 'who', 'brought', 'around', 'poor', 'sensible', 'young', 'woman', 'Really', 'only', 'originality', 'untypical', 'ending', 'bittersweet', 'note.The', 'acting', 'praiseworthy', 'had', 'bit', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'very', 'amiable', 'actor', 'far', 'best', 'slew', 'embarrassingly-bad', 'swordfighters', 'film', 'only', 'truly', 'great', 'actress', 'bunch', 'young', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Yes', 'predictable', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'held', 'up', 'run', 'box', 'office', 'entertaining', 'almost-innocent', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'like', 'good', 'adventure', 'bit', 'romance', 'girl', 'be', 'known', 'gender', 'nothing', 'do', 'talent', 'ability', 'one', 'Princess', 'own', 'two', 'feet']",Princess of Thieves

675547,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005QTA2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","In 2001, Disney produced PRINCESS OF THIEVES, a made-for-television movie which not only dusted off the legend of Robin Hood but engagingly added to it. It featured the lovely Keira Knightley, who was then only 15 years old and took time off from school to shoot this picture. The following year would cause her star to prominently ascend with the release of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, but, even as early as in this film, one can plainly see the natural acting abilities and vivaciousness which radiated from this lanky snippet of a girl.Plot SPOILERS begin:The year is 1184 in the reign of Richard the Lionheart, King of England. The Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) decides to rescind the price put on the head of Robin Hood's baby upon discovery that the infant is a girl. The Sheriff will grow to rue this act. The willful and plucky Gwyn (Keira Knightley), despite the determinedly sheltered existence her celebrated father had laid out for her, is not about to lead a life of meek and ladylike propriety as she instead seeks to follow in her father's footsteps. Possessing her father's archery skills and his habit of questioning wrongful authority, Gwyn will end up in more capers than one girl really should.Now it's been five years since Gwyn has seen her father. Robin loves his daughter and, for the sake of her safety, has purposely made his visits unpredictable and very seldom. One day, Robin Hood and Will Scarlett are tasked to safely escort the dying King Richard's son, Prince Philip, so that the prince may properly assume the monarchy. En route, Robin Hood pays a call on Gwyn, who has long been left in the care of Friar Tuck at his abbey and reared with her childhood friend and monastery novice Froderick.But an argument forms a barrier between Gwyn and her father (she wants to go with him, he thinks that's just stupid), which makes for a bitter departure for Robin. The undaunted Gwyn cuts her hair to pass for a boy (hah!) and sneaks away in pursuit of her father and her own very high ideals. When Robin Hood is taken captive by the Sheriff of Nottingham, it's suddenly left up to his rebellioius daughter to rescue him and prevent the wicked Prince John from usurping the throne of England. And, wouldn't you know it, an archery tournament figures into the rescue mission. Good thing the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.Plot SPOILERS end.PRINCESS OF THIEVES is very good for a television feature. The focus is definitely on Gwyn, the daughter of Robin Hood, with a solid supporting role played by Robin Hood even if fans might be a bit disappointed that he doesn't get to do more; a minor beef of mine is that, even though Gwyn has seemingly taken on the mantle of the sharpshooter in this film, I still expected Robin to wield the bow and arrow more (in fact, I find it hard to recall even one scene in which he slings a bow). Also, in much of the movie, Robin is stern and lacking in humor and seems intent on playing the uncompromising father card. Only later on do glimmerings of his once rakish personality surface.Now, sure, this movie's hampered by a very modest budget, which played a huge factor in having the film shot on location in affordable Romania. It's a given that the special effects, stunts, and sets would suffer a bit. But while there is a diminished sense of grandeur here and the skirmishes are done up with more enthusiasm than technical skill, there's still a sense of purpose to this film. The cast and crew, it seems to me, were fully behind this picture and I could sense the commitment in their performances (the behind-the-scenes featurette goes on to reveal that, of the entire cast and crew, only about 16 or 17 spoke English; so bonding was key).Stuart Wilson, with his commanding presence and sketchy resemblance to an older Sean Connery (who himself portrayed this character), makes a fine Robin Hood, who's now more grizzled and may have lost a bit of his dash but remains heroic and can still muster up an irreverent comment when called upon (""You have egg in your beard""). Even at his most stodgy, he maintains a certain magnetic quality about him. Stephen Moyer provides romantic lead services and is decent as the initially self-serving Prince Philip; certainly, he calls on his Heath Ledger good looks to win over the hearts of the female viewing audience.  Veteran actors Malcolm McDowell and Jonathan Hyde add villainous heft to their respective roles of the Sheriff of Notthingham and Prince John. And Keira Knightley? Well, she's simply luminous and one can see why things got bigger and better for her soon after, career wise. As the feisty Gwyn - who'll brazenly steal a horse but who then is insulted when the horse is offered to her because of her gender - Keira embodies modern girl empowerment to a tee. Boy, whenever she's on the screen, I can't take my eyes off her. Plus she has that sexy-cool Brit accent.This dvd contains two noteworthy bonus features: ""Princess of Thieves: The Adventure Behind the Adventure,"" which is the 8 and a half minutes long, behind-the-scenes segment and a so-so audio commentary by Director Peter Hewitt. These extras are certainly miniscule but apropos of a small screen feature. But it's not about the extras, it's about the film itself. Never mind the historical discrepancies. Watch this instead for the entertainment value. PRINCESS OF THIEVES effectively pays homage to the Outlaw of Sherwood, one of the all-time great historical legends. The climactic scenes may not be as rousing as or contain the magnitude of Errol Flynn's or even Kevin Costner's versions, but they'll certainly do. With ample servings of derring-do, false identities, royal intrigue, and star power as provided by Knightley, PRINCESS OF THIEVES is a breath of fresh air and an appealing addition to the mythos of Robin Hood. Once again, Keira Knightley rocks.One question, though.

Gwen, the neglected daughter of Robin Hood, decides to prove to her father that she can help him in his quest against Prince John.  The King is dying and Robin is trying to make sure the rightful heir, Philip, the illegitimate son of King Richard, is placed on the throne.  Gwen cuts her hair and pretends to be a boy.  This is the only part of the movie that is somewhat unbelievable because she is a beautiful young woman that could never be mistaken for a boy, hair or no hair, lol.  Keira Knightley (Gwen) is just outstanding in this film, and seems older than her 15 years!  Stephen Moyer, is also stunning and does an excellent job in his role as the prince.  One of the most memorable performances is by Del Synnott as Gwen's best-friend Froderick.  Gwen meets Philip and he tells her he is Conrad, the Prince's valet, and that Prince Philip is dead.  Little does she know that he is the prince himself!  I didn't give this movie the highest rating because the conclusion is somewhat disappointing for someone like me who is such a die-hard romantic.  Get the kleenexes!  The story is more about Gwen's relationship with her father, and her desire to share his occupation of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, even though she is not a son.  It's an interesting movie with good acting, and is a good movie for the whole family. If you want all the romantic loose ends tied up nicely though, I'd suggest you watch a movie such as Ever After instead.  The soundtrack of this movie is beautiful.

It was very entertaining and lavishly filmed, set in some absolutely spectacular locations, and starred some really top-notch actors. There were funny moments, sad moments and moments of high action, all nicely interspersed. The only thing I found a tad disappointing was the big fight scene towards the end, since it was a little bit tame and slow, but I accept that because this is a family movie, they couldn't really embrace full-on violence.I was more than satisfied with the slightly non-conventional (for Disney) ending...it ended the way it should, in a somewhat non-predictable way.

675555,A1EUFCOZLSAWZP,B00005QTA2,Medieval Lady,"[0, 0]","Gwen, (Kiera Knightley) Robin Hood's (Stuart Wilson) daughter lost her mother as a young child, and has seen her father only a handful of times because he has been on Crusade most of her life. When he returns on the death of King Richard she believes he will finally stay for good and they will be a proper family.Robin however had been entrusted with a special mission by King Richard, to ensure that his illegitimate son and heir Philip (Stephen Moyer) becomes King instead of dastardly John (Johnathon Hyde) who will go to any lengths to take the throne. This mission takes him away from home once again. This arouses the jealousy of Gwen who is determined to go with her father to prove herself, and make him feel guilty about leaving her behind because she is a girl.Things to not go according to plan however when Robin's Nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm MacDowell) takes him hostage to stop him from foiling Prince John's sinister plans to sieze the throne, leaving Gwen with the responsibility of rescuing him, defeating the evil Sheriff and his henchmen and ensuring Philip takes his rightful place on the throne of England.Originally a TV movie for Disney Channel this is yet another Robin Hood 'spin off', it has a better (and unusually almost entirely British ) cast most other such productions, though this is because Disney of course has more money at their disposal.Prince John is as usual an incompetent childish fool, but his acting is as bad as his persona, and is matched by all the other baddies with the exception of The Sheriff of Nottingham. For some bizarre reason the British actor in the role of Will Scarlet has a very unrealistic Scottish accent throughout. I can understand this from an American actor who cannot do a British accent, but why from a Brit?All the characters (including the peasants) have perfectly clean clothes throughout, never get dirty, and look immaculate all the time even when they are in the forest.One character jumps in front of an archer to 'take and arrow' for Prince Philip in the style of an action movie, but recovers after 5 minutes.The film makers seemed also to have little knowledge of the Geography of Britain, as characters are able to travel the 125 Miles from Nottingham to London in a couple of hours with what must have been incredibly fast horses. As another reiviewer mentioned, Gwen is called a 'commoner' but should not be because according to traditional interpretations of the Legends both her parents were of noble blood.It is very corny and predictable, with the typical resolution of Robin nearly being killed by the Sheriff but being saved by the good guys just in time. Still, such is to be expected from a children's film.This one has something to please most children up to about the age of about 11 with a good looking hero and heroine, a `kickass' girl in the leading role, plenty of action including sword-fighting and archery, deeds of daring doo, all the familiar 'Robin Hood' characters and a happy ending.My only concern would be that somechildren who didn't know that much about History might end up believing that King Richard's son Philip really did become King of England. This is probably not very likely though.Some have commented that the main problem with this movie is that is a TV movie that tries to be a Big Screen movie, but fails. I am inclined to agree. It is slightly better than the average Children's TV movie, and has been released on DVD everywhere from Australia to Korea and Hungary but for some reason bypassed the UK.",3,"Good for the Kids, but perhaps too corny and predictable for older viewers",1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,3540,"['Gwen', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'daughter', 'lost', 'mother', 'young', 'child', 'seen', 'father', 'only', 'handful', 'times', 'been', 'Crusade', 'most', 'life', 'When', 'death', 'King', 'Richard', 'will', 'finally', 'stay', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'proper', 'family.Robin', 'however', 'had', 'been', 'entrusted', 'special', 'mission', 'King', 'Richard', 'ensure', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'heir', 'Philip', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'King', 'instead', 'dastardly', 'John', 'Johnathon', 'Hyde', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'take', 'throne', 'mission', 'away', 'home', 'once', 'again', 'jealousy', 'Gwen', 'who', 'determined', 'go', 'father', 'prove', 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'leaving', 'behind', 'girl.Things', 'not', 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'however', 'when', 'Robin', 'Nemesis', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'Malcolm', 'MacDowell', 'hostage', 'stop', 'foiling', 'Prince', 'John', 'sinister', 'plans', 'sieze', 'throne', 'leaving', 'Gwen', 'responsibility', 'rescuing', 'defeating', 'evil', 'Sheriff', 'henchmen', 'ensuring', 'Philip', 'rightful', 'place', 'throne', 'England.Originally', 'TV', 'movie', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'yet', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'off', 'better', 'unusually', 'almost', 'entirely', 'British', 'cast', 'most', 'other', 'such', 'productions', 'Disney', 'course', 'more', 'money', 'disposal.Prince', 'John', 'as', 'usual', 'incompetent', 'childish', 'fool', 'acting', 'as', 'bad', 'persona', 'matched', 'other', 'baddies', 'exception', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'British', 'actor', 'role', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'can', 'understand', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'British', 'accent', 'why', 'Brit', 'characters', 'including', 'peasants', 'have', 'perfectly', 'clean', 'clothes', 'never', 'get', 'dirty', 'look', 'immaculate', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'forest.One', 'character', 'jumps', 'front', 'archer', ""'take"", 'arrow', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'style', 'action', 'movie', 'recovers', '5', 'minutes.The', 'film', 'makers', 'seemed', 'also', 'have', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Geography', 'Britain', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'travel', '125', 'Miles', 'Nottingham', 'London', 'couple', 'hours', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'horses', 'reiviewer', 'mentioned', 'Gwen', 'called', ""'commoner"", 'should', 'not', 'be', 'because', 'according', 'traditional', 'interpretations', 'Legends', 'parents', 'were', 'noble', 'blood.It', 'very', 'corny', 'predictable', 'typical', 'resolution', 'Robin', 'nearly', 'being', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'being', 'saved', 'good', 'guys', 'just', 'time', 'Still', 'such', 'be', 'expected', 'children', 'film.This', 'one', 'something', 'please', 'most', 'children', 'up', 'age', '11', 'good', 'looking', 'hero', 'heroine', 'kickass', 'girl', 'leading', 'role', 'plenty', 'action', 'including', 'sword-fighting', 'archery', 'deeds', 'daring', 'doo', 'familiar', 'Hood', 'characters', 'happy', 'ending.My', 'only', 'concern', 'would', 'be', 'somechildren', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'that', 'much', 'History', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'believing', 'King', 'Richard', 'son', 'Philip', 'really', 'did', 'become', 'King', 'England', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'likely', 'though.Some', 'have', 'commented', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'TV', 'movie', 'be', 'Big', 'Screen', 'movie', 'am', 'inclined', 'agree', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'Children', 'TV', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'everywhere', 'Australia', 'Korea', 'Hungary', 'reason', 'bypassed', 'UK']",Princess of Thieves

Now, Disney has fulfilled my dream and the legend is reborn.With the strength and cunning abilities of her father, and her mother's incredible beauty, Gwyn is the daughter of Robin Hood, the legendary ""prince of theives.""  But instead of practicing archery and swordplay, she is being tutored by Friar Tuck and her best friend, Froderick.  When her father returns home with his close companion, Will Scarlet, Gywn is ready to see her father that she has not seen in five years.  But Robin and Will will not be staying long, for King Richard is dying and they must help his son, Prince Phillip, become king before the evil Prince John is crowned.  To ensure he will be crowned, Prince John issues his guards to kill the prince, whom no one has ever seen.  Gwyn insists on coming along to help, but when her father refuses and rides off one night with Will, Gwyn cuts her beautiful hair and dresses as a boy.  She is not welcome when she arrives in town, but with the help of Froderick she will help her father if it kills her.  But after Robin saves Gwyn from Prince John's guards, he insists that he will accompany her to the church where she is supposed to meet Froderick.  Meanwhile, Prince Phillip's valet has been killed and the guards now know what the prince looks like.  As Phillip is fleeing for France, Prince John's guards put a stop to the church visit by capturing Robin Hood and Will Scarlet, while Froderick and Gwyn are left to fend for themselves.  As Froderick rides back home to ask for assistance, Gwyn stumbles into Prince Phillip, who passes himself off as the valet of the ""deceased"" prince.  Now that the prince has been ""killed,"" and Robin Hood and Will Scarlet have been sentenced to death, it is up to the ""Princess of Thieves"" to save the day.  But with no experinece against her father's archenemies, is Gwyn up to the challenge?",5,The Legend Lives On!,1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,2005,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'ever', 'could', 'crawl', 'have', 'written', 'many', 'fiction', 'stories', 'where', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'daughter', 'came', 'saved', 'day', 'Now', 'Disney', 'fulfilled', 'dream', 'legend', 'reborn.With', 'strength', 'cunning', 'abilities', 'father', 'mother', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'Gwyn', 'daughter', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'legendary', 'prince', 'theives', 'instead', 'practicing', 'archery', 'swordplay', 'being', 'tutored', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'best', 'friend', 'Froderick', 'When', 'father', 'home', 'close', 'companion', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'Gywn', 'ready', 'see', 'father', 'not', 'seen', 'five', 'years', 'Robin', 'Will', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'staying', 'long', 'King', 'Richard', 'dying', 'must', 'help', 'son', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'become', 'king', 'evil', 'Prince', 'John', 'crowned', 'ensure', 'will', 'be', 'crowned', 'Prince', 'John', 'issues', 'guards', 'kill', 'prince', 'whom', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'Gwyn', 'coming', 'along', 'help', 'when', 'father', 'refuses', 'rides', 'one', 'night', 'Will', 'Gwyn', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'boy', 'not', 'welcome', 'when', 'town', 'help', 'Froderick', 'will', 'help', 'father', 'Robin', 'Gwyn', 'Prince', 'John', 'guards', 'will', 'accompany', 'church', 'where', 'supposed', 'meet', 'Froderick', 'Meanwhile', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'valet', 'been', 'killed', 'guards', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'prince', 'like', 'Phillip', 'fleeing', 'France', 'Prince', 'John', 'guards', 'put', 'stop', 'church', 'visit', 'capturing', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'Froderick', 'Gwyn', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'Froderick', 'back', 'home', 'ask', 'assistance', 'Gwyn', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'who', 'off', 'valet', 'deceased', 'prince', 'Now', 'prince', 'been', 'killed', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'have', 'been', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Princess', 'Thieves', 'save', 'day', 'experinece', 'father', 'archenemies', 'Gwyn', 'up', 'challenge']",Princess of Thieves
675559,APATFK56TSZ86,B00005QTA2,Pink Sparkle Unicorn,"[1, 1]","This movie looked interesting on first sight- being the fan of Robin Hood and the Middle Ages that I am- but I was disappointed to find that it was completely predictable and oh so cheezy.  For example, the first conflict of the story is how Robin Hood is gone all the time on the crusades, and his daughter is mad that he won't take her with him.  They start yelling at each other, and in the end Gwyn decides to disobey him anyway.  Sounding a bit familiar?  This whole parent-child disobedience theme is getting so old in Disney movies (Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Lion King, e.t.c.) and it just isn't a good lesson for kids to be learning.  Now I'll move on to the cheese.  This film does a lousy job of depicting the Middle Ages, and some scenes are just so unrealistic they made me laugh out loud.  For example, Prince John and company ride into battle with their hair looking like its been freshly curled!  And besides all the cheese and predictable-ness, I hated the character of Robin Hood.  The original books describe him as a jolly guy who can be serious but has a never-dying sense of humor. In the movie, he is depicted as a gruff, stern, and uncaring old father.  That was really disappointing.  If you want a better Robin Hood story, read the original book by Howard Pyle, watch the movie with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, or relive the Disney cartoon.  I assure you, any of those choices will be better than dragging through this cheezy, predictable movie.",2,COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE AND ULTRA CHEEZY,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1480,"['movie', 'looked', 'interesting', 'first', 'sight-', 'being', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'am-', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'was', 'completely', 'predictable', 'so', 'cheezy', 'example', 'first', 'conflict', 'story', 'how', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'gone', 'time', 'crusades', 'daughter', 'mad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'start', 'yelling', 'other', 'end', 'Gwyn', 'disobey', 'anyway', 'Sounding', 'bit', 'familiar', 'whole', 'parent-child', 'disobedience', 'theme', 'getting', 'so', 'old', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Pocahontas', 'Lion', 'King', 'e.t.c', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'lesson', 'kids', 'be', 'learning', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'move', 'cheese', 'film', 'lousy', 'job', 'depicting', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'example', 'Prince', 'John', 'company', 'ride', 'battle', 'hair', 'looking', 'been', 'freshly', 'curled', 'cheese', 'predictable-ness', 'hated', 'character', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'original', 'books', 'describe', 'jolly', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'serious', 'never-dying', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'depicted', 'gruff', 'stern', 'uncaring', 'old', 'father', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'want', 'better', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'story', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'Howard', 'Pyle', 'watch', 'movie', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Olivia', 'DeHavilland', 'relive', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'assure', 'choices', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'dragging', 'cheezy', 'predictable', 'movie']",Princess of Thieves
675560,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B00005QTA2,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[22, 22]","I stumbled across this delightful treat of a Disney film a few years ago, just as Kiera Knightley was breaking onto the Hollywood scene in ""Bend It Like Beckham""...A family-friendly film, this fictional story ""Princess of Thieves"" centers on Robin Hood's almost-grown teenage daughter, Gwyn (Kiera Knightley).  While King Richard lies dying (off at the crusades), his illegitimate son (& rightful heir), Prince Phillip (Stephen Moyer) must bravely face danger & the mercenaries hired by Prince John (Richard's evil brother) to travel across England & ascend the throne. The tempestuous father/daughter relationship between Robin Hood & Gwyn must be overcome (Gwyn is angry with her father, as he is gone all the time & won't let her join his band of merry men), in order that they might help Phillip to his rightful place as ruler, foiling the plans of the evil Prince John. But when Phillip & Gwyn meet by chance under false circumstances, anthing & everything could happen...For those of you worried about content, this is a very family-friendly movie: there is some mild romantic tension & a time when a woman dressed as a man ends up atop another man for a few seconds (clothes on, they were fighting), there is some killing/death (nothing too drastic or bloody shown) and there is mild violence as people fight.  Beyond this, there is little to object to...I was quite impressed by this film: I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the fictional nature of the story and cheese factor, but I must say I really did like this movie & have watched it quite a few times: a sweet, sweet story with some good actors/actresses, I would recommend this as a nice break from everyday fare & a good film for the whole family to watch!",4,Delightful treat ~ good clean fun for the whole family!,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1719,"['stumbled', 'delightful', 'treat', 'Disney', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'was', 'breaking', 'Hollywood', 'scene', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'fictional', 'story', 'Princess', 'Thieves', 'centers', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'almost-grown', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Gwyn', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'King', 'Richard', 'dying', 'crusades', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'rightful', 'heir', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'must', 'bravely', 'face', 'danger', 'mercenaries', 'hired', 'Prince', 'John', 'Richard', 'evil', 'brother', 'travel', 'England', 'ascend', 'throne', 'tempestuous', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Gwyn', 'must', 'be', 'overcome', 'Gwyn', 'angry', 'father', 'gone', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'join', 'band', 'merry', 'men', 'order', 'might', 'help', 'Phillip', 'rightful', 'place', 'ruler', 'foiling', 'plans', 'evil', 'Prince', 'John', 'when', 'Phillip', 'Gwyn', 'meet', 'chance', 'false', 'circumstances', 'anthing', 'everything', 'could', 'happen', 'worried', 'content', 'very', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'mild', 'romantic', 'tension', 'time', 'when', 'woman', 'dressed', 'man', 'up', 'atop', 'man', 'few', 'seconds', 'clothes', 'were', 'fighting', 'killing/death', 'nothing', 'too', 'drastic', 'bloody', 'shown', 'mild', 'violence', 'people', 'fight', 'little', 'object', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'film', 'gave', '4', '5', 'stars', 'fictional', 'nature', 'story', 'cheese', 'factor', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'did', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'sweet', 'sweet', 'story', 'good', 'actors/actresses', 'would', 'recommend', 'nice', 'break', 'everyday', 'fare', 'good', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'watch']",Princess of Thieves

Overall, it's a mediocre production, but what stands out is the dynamic performance of the then mostly unknown Keira Knightley, which foreshadows what she would do in her subsequent star-making roles.  In his rave review of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Washington Post critic Stephen Hunter described Knightley as a ""lioness"" and ""a force of nature,"" and, though they're not as refined here, she brings those same qualities to ""Princess of Thieves"" to such an extent that at times some of the other actors look like they're afraid of her.  In other words, there's plenty here for the controversial actress' fans to love and for her detractors to hate.Also notable, is that Knightley's character Gwyn proves to be a ""brave dame"" by nearly all the criteria put forward by novelist and media critic  Susan Isaacs, including how she handles love and relationships.
