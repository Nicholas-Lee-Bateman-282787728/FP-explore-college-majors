You may not have Chris Tucker or Jackie Chan, but you can't complain with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg taking the starring film slots!2 Guns is an impeccable match for Washington and Wahlberg (a pair I'd been waiting to see work together for YEARS!): both actors are not only acclaimed, but also diverse! They both prove that here, with their tackling on of action, humor, drama, and suspense.Meet Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Wahlberg). Bobby and Stig, unbeknownst to each other, are an undercover DEA agent (Bobby) and an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer (Stig). Bobby and Stig, to each other, are criminals who learn the truth (about each other) the hard way (following a bank robbery)!Enter drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) and one of his main assets, a crooked CIA agent named Earl (Bill Paxton). With connections to the bank Bobby and Stig robbed, Papi and Earl want ""their"" money back at any cost. To save the life of his lover Deb Rees (Paula Patton), Bobby (posing undercover as a criminal with Stig, Papi, and many other drug dealers) must join Stig in retrieving the money that he stole...for a rightful cause (you will see what I mean when you see the movie; I don't want to spoil it for you)! As his lover is held hostage, Bobby has only one hope to save her: in Stig, a man who he does not completely trust...and who shares the same skepticism.2 Guns, while hard to follow at times, keeps good mystery (for the most part....a special twist is intentionally revealed for good causes) and, in many ways, makes up for the loss of Die Hard 5 this year: it holds the same kind of action, comedy, drama, and suspense that made action films be taken seriously....while being completely original (outside the comic series its based off of) and fun! To top it off, you don't have action stars indulging in the action....you have real, serious, AND acclaimed actors indulging in it! Washington and Wahlberg may never own a comedy club, but in 2 Guns they show just how much they are capable of in comedy. Both actors give their best comedic performances yet, and yet never stray away from the hostile edge they made us fear them with in Training Day and The Departed. Paula Patton does an impeccable job at leading on an actor and character as smart as Denzel Washington/Bobby Trench and Bill Paxton's performance deserves accolades as well: he studied Tennessee Williams to perfect his character!It doesn't get much better than this.",5,One of the BEST films of 2013!,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,2709,"['day', 'age', 'where', 'not', 'even', 'long-awaited', 'Die', 'Hard', '5', 'good', 'reviews', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'right', '2', 'Guns', 'RH', 'buddy', 'action', 'comedy', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'taking', 'starring', 'film', 'slots', '2', 'Guns', 'impeccable', 'match', 'Washington', 'Wahlberg', 'pair', ""'d"", 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'work', 'together', 'YEARS', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'acclaimed', 'also', 'diverse', 'prove', 'here', 'tackling', 'action', 'humor', 'drama', 'suspense.Meet', 'Robert', 'Bobby', 'Trench', 'Washington', 'Michael', 'Stig', 'Stigman', 'Wahlberg', 'Bobby', 'Stig', 'unbeknownst', 'other', 'are', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Bobby', 'undercover', 'Naval', 'Intelligence', 'Officer', 'Stig', 'Bobby', 'Stig', 'other', 'are', 'criminals', 'who', 'learn', 'truth', 'other', 'hard', 'way', 'following', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Enter', 'drug', 'lord', 'Papi', 'Greco', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'one', 'main', 'assets', 'crooked', 'CIA', 'agent', 'named', 'Earl', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'connections', 'bank', 'Bobby', 'Stig', 'robbed', 'Papi', 'Earl', 'want', 'money', 'back', 'cost', 'save', 'life', 'lover', 'Deb', 'Rees', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'Bobby', 'posing', 'undercover', 'criminal', 'Stig', 'Papi', 'many', 'other', 'drug', 'dealers', 'must', 'join', 'Stig', 'retrieving', 'money', 'stole', 'rightful', 'cause', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'lover', 'held', 'hostage', 'Bobby', 'only', 'one', 'hope', 'save', 'Stig', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'completely', 'trust', 'who', 'shares', 'same', 'skepticism.2', 'Guns', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'keeps', 'good', 'mystery', 'most', 'part', 'special', 'twist', 'intentionally', 'revealed', 'good', 'causes', 'many', 'ways', 'up', 'loss', 'Die', 'Hard', '5', 'year', 'same', 'kind', 'action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'suspense', 'made', 'action', 'films', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'being', 'completely', 'original', 'comic', 'series', 'based', 'fun', 'top', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'action', 'stars', 'indulging', 'action', '.you', 'have', 'real', 'serious', 'AND', 'acclaimed', 'actors', 'indulging', 'Washington', 'Wahlberg', 'may', 'never', 'own', 'comedy', 'club', '2', 'Guns', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'capable', 'comedy', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'comedic', 'performances', 'yet', 'yet', 'never', 'stray', 'away', 'hostile', 'edge', 'made', 'fear', 'Training', 'Day', 'Departed', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'impeccable', 'job', 'leading', 'actor', 'character', 'as', 'smart', 'Denzel', 'Washington/Bobby', 'Trench', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'performance', 'accolades', 'well', 'studied', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'perfect', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",N/A

1630929,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00BEIYN9Q,Chris Kennison,"[0, 2]","I sure do love a good shoot em' up and that is pretty much what ""2 Guns"" is. Although somehow the creators managed to blend and old fashion crime, gun-slinging action flick with a movie like ""Ocean's Eleven"". It's a heist, action, comedy, western, thriller and espionage movie all rolled into one. You may think that may be a little too much for a movie to try and bite off and chew but with people like Denzel Washington, Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos and Mark Wahlberg driving the ship. It all seems to work.Denzel plays Robert `Bobby' Trench and Wahlberg plays Michael `Stig' Stigman. They are partners who have many complicated layers that only the viewer should be saddled with figuring out because that's half the fun. In fact, as the two men start the movie off setting up a scenario for a bank robbery we quickly realize that the chemistry between the two is half the fun. We haven't seen such great chemistry between two on screen partners since the Lethal Weapon movies.Bill Paxton hasn't played such a phenomenal bad guy since he tortured Wyatt and whacked Gary's girlfriend on the top of the head with the shotgun in ""Weird Science"". He eats up every situation he has on screen with a twisted sense of humor and a menacing delivery that has you glued to the screen. He may have gone to waste a bit toward the end of the movie but there are so many levels to the film that it is once again, forgiven.There were a few things that could have made ""2 Guns"" and even better movie but for anybody who likes a movie that has twists, turns, action and humor, it works. It may get a little ridiculous a handful of times and there was a minor moment toward the end that really bothered me after watching a witty, creative and realistic movie for the most part. Pull the trigger, man. You don't have to explain yourself. It is like you know the camera is on you and you have to release some plot information. No, you don't.

This is one of those films.Here's the scoop. A DEA agent (Denzel Washington) and a Navy Intelligence agent (Mark Whalberg) team up and rob a bank. Neither knows the others' true identity. When the take on the heist is way more than it should have been they realize something stinks and need to dig themselves out of a huge mess.This is a nifty flick. It's a complex plot where the information is divvied out evenly as things progress. It's loaded with clever verbal exchanges, particularly between Washington and Wahlberg. There are a lot of close calls and a fair amount of violence. There is also a decent amount of stuff happening with cars. Chases, blow-ups and the like. There were also a lot of cool tunes peppered throughout. What's really happening here though is the Washington Wahlberg enemy/buddy thing. You like how the circumstances in the plot change their relationship. Edward James Olmos is on hand as the ruthless drug lord and Bill Paxton (whom I never considered all that good an actor) really steps up to the plate as the crooked CIA agent. You just love to hate him.On the downside. You like Wahlberg but you know that any intelligence agent won't have his demeanor. He's too friendly and optimistic. Then there's the Paula Patton character. I like Patton. She has a good camera face and acts quite well but they screwed up her part.

1630989,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYN9Q,FNDNreview,"[4, 7]","Over the course of film history, there have been several successful onscreen duos.  From comedy to action flicks, just a few of the countless successful partnerships include Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon franchise, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in Wayne's World, and even Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour trilogy.  While not every partnership is perfect, the summer of 2013 has produced a series of mixed results for onscreen duos.  Most notably, the tandem of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy stirred up the laughs in The Heat, while Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges crashed and burned in R.I.P.D.  Now, two of Hollywood's biggest stars - Academy Award winner Denzel Washington and Academy Award nominee Mark Wahlberg have teamed-up in the Boom! comic book adaption, 2 Guns.  Will these two A-list film stars translate to box office success or is their partnership destined to fail?Based on the 2007 comic book series written by Steve Grant and directed by Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur (Contraband), 2 Guns stars Denzel Washington as DEA Agent Bobby Tranch and Mark Wahlberg as NCIS agent Marcus Stigman.  Unbeknownst to one another, both Trench and Stigman are working undercover together for their respective branches with different agendas, both including the same drug cartel, led by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos).  The DEA is attempting to bust Greco for drugs, while NCIS is after the cartel's money - but after robbing a bank, both men realize they were setup by their respective agencies to take the fall.  Begrudgingly, Trench and Stiman are forced to work together to fend off their assailants and return the money to its rightful owner.  Bill Paxton, James Marsden, and Paula Patton also star in supporting roles.On their own, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg have created an abundance of memorable movie roles.  It only makes sense to add them in a film as co-stars and watch the fireworks - which is absolutely the outcome in 2 Guns.  These two charismatic, high-profile actors own their respective roles as they bicker amongst themselves, duke it out on occasion, and shoot the endless amount of bad guys.  There's no shortage of entertainment value with these two stars on the screen as they both incorporate comedy, gushing one-liners, and will undoubtedly eye-wink their way into the good graces of all the action lovers.  Although both Wahlberg and Washington earn an endorsement as a pleasantly entertaining onscreen duo, that's about the only positive attribute to take away from this film.The poorly written, often horribly predictable plot is detrimental to the quality of this film.  For two supposedly smart characters, both Wahlberg and Washington's characters are played for saps on more than one occasion over the course of the film.  It's impatiently irksome at times to see the duo constantly one-up and outsmart each other, yet they are continuously played like a fiddle by the not-so-notorious villains of the film.  While the first half of the film features a great deal of mystery as to who is really pulling the strings of the plot, once the bad guy - in this case Bill Paxton - is revealed, there's really one way for the film to end.  Paxton's character is a bit over-the-top, largely due to his obsession with Russian roulette, but aside from his bark, he doesn't really offer the proper amount of bit.The film also lacks a substantial amount of female presence, regardless of the tedious presence of Paula Patton.  She serves as Washington's love interest, only minus the interest.  For the brief scenes she's actually present, the writing for her character does absolutely nothing to enhance the plot and the final outcome of her character is even more of a bore.  Naturally, her character shows up just long enough to shed her clothes (which is an unnecessary exploitation that offers absolutely nothing to the film), only to disappear and sever the emotionally-lacking damsel in distress.  Compared to the majority of the action flicks out there, it's surprising both Washington and Wahlberg's characters didn't wind up with brain-dead interests.It's easy to nitpick about action films and scold them for being similar to every other action flick that's ever been made.  However, despite the clumsy, unemotional plot and the lack of character development, there's still plenty of entertainment value to be found in this film.  There's just enough action to sustain the attention of most moviegoers, and it's actually refreshing to watch an action flick that isn't as typically overzealous as some of Stallone or Schwarzenegger's action extravaganzas.  As always, the number of bullets flying overhead is absurd, but 2 Guns is a nice change-of-pace summer film that didn't require a $200 million budget or the incorporation of ridiculous CGI aliens and an endless amount of buildings constantly toppling over.Compared to the other comic book films of the summer, including Man of Steel, R.I.P.D. and Iron Man 3, 2 Guns is the most down-to-earth film out of the genre.  Most will be surprised to discover this film was based on a comic book, but that won't take away from the excitement that Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to the screen.  The plot is fair and the cast is above average - making for an easy, safe film recommendation.  No, this isn't a perfect film, but it's an average summer flick that most movie lovers should feel comfortable watching.  The film can but crass at times, and it certainly doesn't exactly ooze with praise for the United States government and military - yet there's still a fair to high amount of entertainment value to be observed.  And, following the undoubted success of this film, the possibility of a sequel should loom large, especially with the recent launch of the comic book sequel, Three Guns.GRADE:

He is also a director and a producer and seems to be one of the more exciting new talents of the day. He directed this work by Stephen Grant based on the Boom! Studios graphic novel adapted for the screen by Blake Masters. It is a crazy mixed up story of mistaken identities, hidden identities and corruption in every branch of the crime prevention division of the government. It works primarily of the unexpectedly fine screen chemistry between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent who takes advantage of gunman Michael Stigman's (Mark Wahlberg) idea to rob a bank to bust him and a mob boss (Edward James Olmos). However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than predicted and with Trench's forces failing to halt the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves. The well-healed cast of characters (at times difficult to tell who is on what team) includes Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Fred Ward, Robert John Burke, Greg Sproles, and Paula Patton.It is noisy action all the way but the script is peppered with enough solid humor and exceptional banter between Washington and Wahlberg that it keeps our attention to the very odd ending.

It's a list of my favorite buddy cop shows, on which 2 Guns immediately ranks. I never would've thought it, but Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make an uproarious team. These are two actors that, to me, normally wouldn't register as comic performers. But 2 Guns' core appeal resides in the sharp interplay between them. They're surprisingly well matched.The set-up: Take two swaggerful characters, each an undercover lawman, except they don't know the other one is. Wily DEA agent Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) has spent the past three years rooting in the dirt, posing as the slick Bobby Beans a.k.a. ""I Know A Guy"" Bobby, trying to get the goods on Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Somewhere, somewhen, Bobby picked up an associate named Stig (Wahlberg). Stig is a bit of a wild card, a bit of a loose cannon. Unbeknownst to Bobby, Stig is U.S. Navy Petty Officer Michael Stigman, deployed on covert assignment for Naval Intelligence. It evens out. That Bobby is DEA is unbeknownst to Stig.2 Guns opens with Bobby Beans and Stig on the verge of robbing a bank in Tres Cruces, New Mexico. There's a smidge of a flashback sequence that sets up motivation - it's all to do with that the bank contains $3 million of the drug lord's cash.The plot thickens when Bobby and Stig pull off the heist but are shocked to learn that their haul isn't $3 million but, rather, $43,125,000. Pangs of deep concern worm in, and, me, I would've put that money back stat. Because that is way too much money and someone's bound to come lookin'. And sure 'nuff. There go Bobby Beans and Stig on the run, pursued by just about everyone from both sides of the law.It's adapted from Steven Grant's graphic novel from Boom! Studios, and maybe that explains away the stylized action set pieces. 2 Guns absolutely mines the buddy cop formula. It's chock full of banter that probably comes off more awesome than it has a right to be mostly because Denzel and Wahlberg are just that amazing together. Denzel doesn't do a lot of comedy, so there's gratification in watching him perform out of his wheelhouse and doing so well. Still, no matter what, I never expect Denzel to suck in whatever role he takes on. What's got me gobsmacked is how funny Wahlberg is. The last time I've been this startled was when Channing Tatum proved he could be very funny. Anyway, the playful chemistry between the two leading men is what drives the film and what gets the viewer invested. Of course, it doesn't hurt that they're playing kickass federal agents who get particular joy out of messing with each other.It's a solid supporting cast, as well, with Paula Patton and her badonkadonk providing knuckle-gnawing eye candy. Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, and Fred Ward lend weight as the heavies/obstructive elements. Bill Paxton, particularly, has got that devilish glint in his eye. But I don't like his tweaking of Russian Roulette because one should never mess with a classic.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Feature Commentary with director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur & producer Adam Siegel- 8 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:11:49 minutes)- Undercover and Into Action (00:06:03 minutes)Lastly, and feel free to skip it, here's a list of my favorite buddy cop programs:- Dempsey And Makepeace (TV show)- Starsky & Hutch (TV Show)- Tango and Cash- 48 HRS.- Running Scared (1986)- Lethal Weapon- Stakeout- The Hidden- Downtown (1990)- Dead Heat- Red Heat- Alien Nation- Dark Angel (a.k.a.

It wasn't bad enough to be fun and it wasn't good enough to be entertaining. Look, talking fast is not enough to be clever or funny. If it were, then Chris Tucker would be fighting off the job offers with a stick. And these movies are usually about juxtaposition of types. When both of your leads are smarmy, fast-talking punks, there is no one for them to bounce off of and you just get a bunch of gibberish and no punch lines. What's the main difference between the two leads? Their races. Oh, and one of them keeps changing his hat for no good reason. That's what passes for characterization in this movie. He even finds the time to change it several times while on the run from federal agents and military investigators who will kill him on sight.The plot was a big snore. Every time a new character showed up they might as well have had a big sign around their neck that said ""villain"" or ""comedy relief"" or ""I will betray you later"". They were so blatant that I was able to tell you exactly how the rest of the movie was going to progress, right down to some of the dialogue to be used, after about 10 minutes in. There were no surprises because the ads and every single plot synopsis tells you, flat out, everything that is going to happen in the first half hour of the movie.A quick word about nude scenes. There needs to be a reason for them to be in a movie. We get a nude scene in this movie that was so pointless that I am surprised the actress involved agreed to it. The scene is repeated, almost word for word a few minutes later in the movie, but in the second version she is wearing a bra. It seemed an awful lot like the director shot two versions of the one scene and then used them both to pad out the movie.And the ending? Ugh...a bunch of stupid explosions and ""idiot logic"" followed by a beat for beat retread of the first bank robbery stakeout from earlier in the movie.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[12, 14]","Based on the graphic novel, 2 Guns, the film follows criminals Bobby Trench and Michael Stigman, who plan to rob Papi Greco, a Mexican drug lord. But after an unexpected overflow of cash during their heist that leaves them with $43 million, they both discover that they're both undercover. Stigman is Special Forces, and Trench is DEA. What they don't know, is the $43 million belongs to the CIA, and soon things spiral out of control, leaving the duo with nothing to do but fight back.2Guns is directed by Baltasar Kormakur, who previously directed Mark in the crime-thriller, Contraband. Here, 2Guns is filled to the brim with non-stop action, laughs, and a great story about friendship, with some bloody details thrown in. The writing is fantastic; nothing Oscar-winning, but still greatly memorable. The acting is even better, with this being Marky Mark's best film by far. Denzel Washington is great as Trench, and his role here does rank along his best (Alonzo from Training Day, Tobin Frost from Safe House, and Whip Whitaker from Flight). The cinematography is surprisingly fantastic, with a few great shots in New Mexico during a sequence where Bobby and Stigman have to cross from Mexico into the US. Honestly, the only movie I can think of that is as funny as 2Guns, is Edgar Wright's The World's End, which was also released this year.2Guns is a must-see and own for action fans, comedy lovers or anyone who likes the two lead actors because this movie, while not a massively epic blockbuster, really shows us why we love seeing movies on the big screen.

Let's take a look2 Guns starts out almost suspiciously, with superstars Denzel Washington (Bobby) and Mark Wahlberg (Stigman). Early on it is pretty obvious this is one of those ""he may not be who he says he is"" kind of movies.  Among one of the many positive things I can point out about 2 Guns; the chemistry between these two makes this movie tremendously enjoyable. Mark's character Stigman is hilarious, and you know if Denzel Washington is in a movie (any movie for that matter) you know exactly what you are getting.To get into the story line without giving too much away, it is heavily based around these two characters Bobby and Stigman, Bobby is an undercover agent who decides to assist Stigman in stealing what they both believe to be $3 Million. However, once the job is done they find more money than either guy could have bargained for. Following the robbery, a lot more guns, and a lot more people become involved. 2 Guns is not exactly a short movie, but it shows to be a movie that is easily likable thanks to the humor, the well rounded performances, and the all around fun tone the movie has.

1631069,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYN9Q,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.If there's one action sub-genre that never fails to be entertaining, it would be that of the buddy cop variety. The concept of two very different people teaming up to achieve a common goal always brings forth this fun, lightheartedness, which makes for a nice change of pace from the usual serious, cookie cutter characters found in your everyday action thriller. This aspect alone makes 2 Guns worth it, but, unfortunately, I found the writers relied too much on this element of the story, which made the narrative feel sloppy and, at times, a little hard to follow. Complex and incoherent are far from synonymous, and 2 Guns is the perfect example of this. However, although the payoff was never satisfying, the journey itself was very enjoyable.2 Guns follows Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Mark Wahlberg), two supposed guns-for-hire who each hold a secret that will soon make life very difficult for the both of them. What they don't know is that each is an undercover agent with their own personal plan, and the truth doesn't come out until they rob a bank that was supposed to be holding three million dollars belonging to a Mexican drug lord by the name of Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). However, the bank was actually holding $43 million of CIA money, and now the duo must go on the run from the cartel, the navy, and the CIA. At the same time, secrets get revealed, friends are slain, and an unusual friendship forms between the two leads.The unique thing about 2 Guns is its ability to entertain while being incredibly ridiculous. From start to finish the writing is witty and bouncy, the story is filled with plenty of laughs, and the chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal. However, at its core, the story is a ludicrously dark representation of humanity. No one in the movie can be trusted, there is never any hesitation when it came down to double-crossing someone, and CIA agents are running around harming and killing innocent civilians. The overwhelming cynicism became extremely unbearable by the halfway mark, and by the end of the film I felt this odd form of depression because no one seemed to truly care about anyone but themselves.In addition, there were a few personal relationships, and a handful of side characters, that never felt fleshed out or explained. For example, in my opinion, the side-relationship between Deb (Paula Patton) and Quince (James Marsden) felt as if it was shoehorned in just as a way to add some unnecessary complexity to an already off-the-rails narrative. Their reason for being together was never explained, and the viewer never actually witnessed them in the same room together. Furthermore, time and time again 2 Guns fails to flesh out the backgrounds of these personal relationships. The viewer never gets told how Bobby and Stigman meet, which feels like a vital part of the story, and the same can be said for Deb and Quince.With that said, what truly drives this movie forward is its fun atmosphere and the great chemistry between its two leads. Washington and Wahlberg may have two very different acting styles, but whenever they were on screen together you knew you were going to have a laugh or two. In a way, this unique pairing only adds to the performances because the differences in their personalities translates perfectly to the differences in their characters. Bobby is the serious character trying to get the job done, and Stigman never hesitates to crack a joke or attempt to lighten the mood. Although neither gave the performance of their careers, the way they played off of each other was highly enjoyable.Finally, the film's score, composed by Clinton Shorter, is anything but groundbreaking, but it does do an excellent job of creating a sense of atmosphere for the entire hour and 40 minutes. The compositions range from jumpy, country western music to these intense, dramatic pieces used to elevate the more energetic segments in the film. Thankfully, this is generally a nice combination, and both elements work surprisingly really well together. However, neither do much to impress for the entire length of the film. As previously stated, the music is very atmospheric, and it fits the film perfectly, but from an artistic standpoint it's a little underwhelming.Overall Score: 6.9/10 - 2 Guns does the unthinkable by providing an extremely fun and entertaining movie that is littered with flaws and inconsistencies. Whalberg and Washington work extremely well together, and Denzel occasionally surpasses the emotional limitations of the script, but the narrative they're working with undeniably lacked the polish necessary to make this work as well as it should have. Nonetheless, I would still strongly recommend this as a rental, or even a purchase if you can get your hands on it for a good discount. It's not terrible, but I found that the narrative never really reached its stride.",3,"6.9/10 - Fun, but highly flawed",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,4965,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers',

While fleeing, they learn the secret of their shakey alliance that neither knew that the other was an undercover agent.Considering the star power here, this is a very well acted movie, with Washington and Walhberg both playing their roles well and having very good chemistry both action and comedy wise during the movie.  Even the supporting cast do very well at playing their roles well, especially with Paxton and Olmos playing the cliche type villians very well.The movie is action packed and entertaining and that is not where the issue is with this movie as there is lots of shooting, blowing things up and characters dying.  Like most action movies, you have to suspend your belief to enjoy this and this one is no different.  The problem is that the plot is a bit far fetched and goes too many directions at once.  DEA, FBI, CIA, Cartels, Navy Intel(which in case of the Navy, for the life of me, I can't figure out why they are involved in this plot).  The plot has way too many things going on at the same time and tends to get things confused and muddled where a better story could have been developed and still been as much fun.  Yes maybe over the top action and plot is the point of this movie and it does that well and does keep you entertained but this movie could have been better with a few tweaks to the plot.A fun fast paced entertaining thrill ride that most action fans and fans of Washington and Walhberg will enjoy.

This is how the story goes: For the past 12 months, DEA agent Bobby Trench and U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman have been reluctantly attached at the hip. Working undercover as members of a narcotics syndicate, each man distrusts his partner as much as the criminals they have both been tasked to take down.When their attempt to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel and recover millions goes haywire, Trench and Stigman are suddenly disavowed by their superiors. Now that everyone wants them in jail or in the ground, the only person they can count on is the other. Unfortunately for their pursuers, when good guys spend years pretending to be bad, they pick up a few tricks along the way.The cast led by Denzel Washington (as Bobby) & Mark Wahlberg (as Stig) is great. The directing by Baltasar Kormakur is great. The screenplay (based on the graphic novels by Steven Grant) by Blake Masters is great.The music by Clinton Shorter is great. The cinematography by Oliver Wood is great. The film editing by Michael Tronick is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe is great. The production design by Beth Mickle is great. The art direction by Kevin Hardison is great. The set decoration by Leonard R. Spears, set dressings by Derek Bensonhaver, Gregory T. Geniusz, Ram Goradia, Prentice Randolph, David Thompson & Barker White, set designs by Wright McFarland, Adele Plauche & Trinh Vu is great. The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon is great. The special effects supervised by James Lorimer, coordinated by Ron Trost is great.

The stunts coordinated by Darrin Prescott & Wade Allen is great.This is a great action film that is entertaining and fast-paced. It is also, at times, funny, as well.

1631110,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BEIYN9Q,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There's no denying that Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are two of the top action stars in film these days even though there is a considerable age difference between the two. So when the word came out that they would be involved in a buddy cop movie I was ready for it to be dynamite. Fortunately 2 GUNS turned out to be just that.The two begin the film as a pair of crooks involved with diabolical Papa Greco (Edward James Olmos), a Mexican drug lord that Robert &#34;Bobby&#34; Trench (Washington) has bought passports for. Unfortunately the drugs that he was supposed to be paid with are being held back by Greco who would rather pay with cash. Instead, Trench tells him to hold on to the cash until he's ready to give him the drugs.Michael &#34;Stig&#34; Stigman is another character altogether. Where Trench is a cool cat, Stigman is the hot youngster ready to go at it at the drop of a hat. Stigman, unhappy with the day's events, suggests to Trench that they do something different to get more money from Greco: rob a bank where he deposits cash every week. Their guess is the take will be about $3 million.After the two head back to the U.S. the find themselves picked up by Immigration and are held for questioning. Here is where we learn that Trench isn't the crook we thought but an undercover DEA agent. He informs his controllers that the deal didn't go through but he's on the verge which results in him being given just 2 weeks to finish the case. With so little time he suggests to his main controller Deb (Paula Patton), who he also happens to be sleeping with, that he and Stigman actually pull off the bank job to get the ball rolling.The duo follows through on their plan with one a few hitches along the way. First off they discover that there is more than just $3 million, more like $43 million. Secondly the arresting DEA officers that were supposed to show never arrive. And lastly when the time comes for Trench to reveal himself to Stigman, Stigman shoots him and leaves him in the dessert with a bottle of water.Stigman reports to a group of friends and we now learn that he is working for Naval Intelligence to get to the money that was in the bank. When he discusses the fact that it was more than expected and that he left Trench alive, his cohorts open fire on him and try to take him out. He escapes but barely.The duo reunites and puts together what information they have after kidnapping Greco to find out how much he knows. While interrogating him at Deb's house, the military guys show and the twists and turns of just who is working for who and which organization is doing the backstabbing begins to reveal itself.The movie is filled with action from start to finish. Not only that but there is a comedic quotient on display here that harkens back to the LETHAL WEAPON films of the past. While Washington may be the cool character with some decent funny lines it is Wahlberg's character that has the more funnier moments. Between his wink, his attitude and his snappy come backs, he brings the humor to the film. As for the rest of the cast they do a remarkable job of playing out their roles and not hamming it up. Seeing as how this movie is based on a graphic novel the fact they can do so shows how well they do.With plenty of explosions and gunplay, after all the movie IS named 2 GUNS, the action quotient is one that should fulfill the needs of all adventure fans. The stars show an ability to tussle with one another and the bad guys as well as offer some gunfire play that will make you wish that these two were on your team if the need ever arose. Is it one for the shelf? Maybe. Not mine but then some of you may be die hard fans of both actors. If so you'll want this one added to your collection. .",4,TWO STARS AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3752,"['denying', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'two', 'top', 'action', 'stars', 'film', 'days', 'even', 'considerable', 'age', 'difference', 'two', 'So', 'when', 'word', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'dynamite', 'Fortunately', '2', 'GUNS', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'that.The', 'two', 'begin', 'film', 'pair', 'crooks', 'involved', 'diabolical', 'Papa', 'Greco', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lord', 'Robert', '34', 'Bobby', '34', 'Trench', 'Washington', 'bought', 'passports', 'Unfortunately', 'drugs', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'paid', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'Greco', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'pay', 'cash', 'Instead', 'Trench', 'hold', 'cash', 'ready', 'give', 'drugs.Michael', '34', 'Stig', '34', 'Stigman', 'character', 'altogether', 'Where', 'Trench', 'cool', 'cat', 'Stigman', 'hot', 'youngster', 'ready', 'go', 'drop', 'hat', 'Stigman', 'unhappy', 'day', 'events', 'Trench', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'Greco', 'rob', 'bank', 'where', 'cash', 'week', 'guess', 'take', 'will', 'be', '3', 'million.After', 'two', 'head', 'back', 'U.S.', 'find', 'picked', 'up', 'Immigration', 'are', 'held', 'questioning', 'Here', 'where', 'learn', 'Trench', ""n't"", 'crook', 'thought', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'agent', 'controllers', 'deal', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'verge', 'results', 'being', 'given', 'just', '2', 'weeks', 'finish', 'case', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'main', 'controller', 'Deb', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'sleeping', 'Stigman', 'actually', 'bank', 'job', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling.The', 'duo', 'plan', 'one', 'few', 'hitches', 'way', 'First', 'discover', 'more', 'just', '3', 'million', 'more', '43', 'million', 'Secondly', 'arresting', 'DEA', 'officers', 'were', 'supposed', 'show', 'never', 'arrive', 'lastly', 'when', 'time', 'Trench', 'reveal', 'Stigman', 'Stigman', 'shoots', 'dessert', 'bottle', 'water.Stigman', 'reports', 'group', 'friends', 'now', 'learn', 'working', 'Naval', 'Intelligence', 'get', 'money', 'was', 'bank', 'When', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'expected', 'left', 'Trench', 'alive', 'cohorts', 'open', 'fire', 'try', 'take', 'out', 'barely.The', 'duo', 'reunites', 'together', 'what', 'information', 'have', 'kidnapping', 'Greco', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'interrogating', 'Deb', 'house', 'military', 'guys', 'show', 'twists', 'turns', 'just', 'who', 'working', 'who', 'organization', 'doing', 'backstabbing', 'reveal', 'itself.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'start', 'finish', 'Not', 'only', 'comedic', 'quotient', 'display', 'here', 'back', 'LETHAL', 'WEAPON', 'films', 'past', 'Washington', 'may', 'be', 'cool', 'character', 'decent', 'funny', 'lines', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'more', 'funnier', 'moments', 'Between', 'wink', 'attitude', 'snappy', 'come', 'backs', 'humor', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'playing', 'out', 'roles', 'not', 'hamming', 'up', 'Seeing', 'how', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'fact', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'shows', 'how', 'well', 'do.With', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'gunplay', 'movie', 'IS', 'named', '2', 'GUNS', 'action', 'quotient', 'one', 'should', 'fulfill', 'needs', 'adventure', 'fans', 'stars', 'show', 'ability', 'tussle', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'as', 'well', 'offer', 'gunfire', 'play', 'will', 'make', 'wish', 'two', 'were', 'team', 'need', 'ever', 'arose', 'one', 'shelf', 'Maybe', 'Not', 'mine', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'actors', 'so', ""'ll"", 'want', 'one', 'added', 'collection']",N/A

Together they steal what they think was the drug gang's money, but turn's out to be someone far more dangerous.The strength of the film is the two leads, they both look the part of their respective roles, but more importantly fit together, making this a good buddy movie. The plot of the film isn't anything special and acts simply as a vehicle for more set pieces and opportunities for the two leads to spark of each other.While the story isn't all that, the writing is pretty good, the lines between the two leads all hit the mark and provide a good slice of humour.

1631128,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYN9Q,M. Oleson,"[2, 5]","Theatrical review.  May contain spoilers.It could be just my imagination but it seems that about this time every year Denzel Washington stars in an action based film with just enough comedy in the mix to warm up to audiences.  This year is no exception.  He teams up with Mark Wahlberg who is no stranger to the genre either.Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) are seemingly a pair of bank robbing, drug runners doing business in Mexico with one of the feared cartels headed by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos).  The pair, knowing where $3 million of drug money is held, decide to rob the small bank and clean out the safety deposit box.  Little did they expect that every deposit box had cash in it, totally $43 million.It is no surprise thanks to the trailers that all is not what it seems.  Bobby is actually an undercover DEA agent and Stig is a Navy specialist also working under cover.  Neither were aware of the other's involvement.  It turns out that their bosses were both in on a complicated subterfuge and neither operative was aware.  To make things even dicier, the money actually belongs to the CIA's dirty man-in-charge (a convincingly despicable Bill Paxton).  If you're not confused enough, Bobby's sometime girlfriend Deb (drop dead gorgeous Paula Patton) is a co-worker who may or may not be involved somehow.There is one thing for sure.  There is a lot of gun play and plenty of explicit violence, but what makes it all work is the give and take between Stig and Bobby.  It is damn funny stuff.  Washington and Wahlberg have great chemistry and perfect timing.  The film is directed by Iceland's Baltasar Kormakur Samper who is also responsible for ""Contraband"" also starring Wahlberg.  I give bonus points for a pair of surprises from Ms. Patton.  The film won't be up for any Oscars, but it's a fun time at the movies.",4,3 1/2 stars.

1631135,A84FLVDK2R5JF,B00BEIYN9Q,"Nathan M. Rose ""Movie Guy from FlickDirect""","[2, 4]","Double crosses. Triple crosses. An extra helping of crosses on top of increasingly tangled numerical crosses. 2 Guns is a buddy cop genre pic in the guise of a punchy pulp comic book actioner, one that attempts to toy with convention, actively subvert every action-movie clich&eacute; in the book, and crack a few familiar, wise-crackin' skulls in the process. Trouble is director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur and screenwriter Blake Masters' adaptation of Steven Grant's original graphic novel isn't nearly as clever as it thinks it is, and never quite manages to lift Grant's colorful characters off the page. That little consolation prize instead comes courtesy of Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg and the duo's scene-chewing supporting cast, who at least make 2 Guns watchable. Entertaining even... if that is you're willing to switch off your brain and take the movie on its own flash-bang terms.Meet Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg): criminals for hire, except that they're not really criminals. Bobby is an undercover DEA agent, Stig is an undercover NCIS officer. There's just one problem... each one thinks the other is exactly what he claims to be. Soon the two join forces to steal $3 million from Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) for their respective agencies, only to discover the take is actually $43 million. The stakes are suddenly that much higher. Thirteen back-stabs and betrayals later, Bobby and Stig struggle to gain their bearings, and neither one knows who to trust. With so much cash up for grabs, the duo find themselves in the crosshairs. But who does the money belong to? And who can Bobby and Stig trust? Greco? Navy Admiral Tuway (Fred Ward)? Bobby's lover Deb Rees (Paula Patton)? Stig's commander Quince (James Marsden)? Bloodthirsty power player Earl (Bill Paxton)? Korm&aacute;kur? Masters?I couldn't help but think of Sylvain White's The Losers while sitting through 2 Guns, followed almost immediately by two-dozen other high-action shoot-em-ups; every single one of them backed by big-blockbuster casts that are far and away their films' greatest assets. Korm&aacute;kur and Masters take loving shot after loving shot at the genre to scattershot ends, dropping one-liners and shell casings as if both were going out of style. 2 Guns doesn't rise above the action-movie fray so much as it takes a turn in an already crowded firing range. It's a wild free-for-all that doesn't try to hide the Big Dumb Fun coursing beneath its surface, with Olmos, Marsden and especially Paxton having the times of their lives. But it's also a shaky, unreliable, unnecessarily convoluted misfire that would tip over if Washington and Wahlberg weren't so busy steadying it. Even when next to nothing makes sense, even when gaping plot holes threaten to swallow up what little plausibility Korm&aacute;kur tries to establish, even when their performances amount to one over-the-top round of mugging after the other, both A-listers deliver.And it's a tricky balance. Get a kick out of headliners like Washington and Wahlberg dabbling in the dark side? Willing to look the other way when plot twists are obvious and plot progression is needlessly complicated? Value comic book gunplay, colorful criminals and angsty antiheroes above... well, anything more compelling? 2 Guns is for you. There's just plenty more like it out there, and plenty more on the horizon. Escapism isn't exactly a new pastime. We've been dumping billions into the hard-R action grinder for decades. Films like 2 Guns, though, are caught between genre classicism and more contemporary, self-aware thrills, paying homage to the guilty pleasures of the '90s while taking a stab at something newer and more clever. Once in a great while, a film comes along that strikes that balance and enters the new action format. 2 Guns is not that film, fun as it is if you're able to set aside expectations, switch off your brain, and be entertained by good actors knowingly sinking their teeth into a fatty, gristly script.2 Guns takes aim with a killer 1080p/AVC-encoded video presentation that rarely, if ever, disappoints. Colors are warm and carefully saturated, black levels are exceedingly deep (with only intermittent instances of crush), and skintones look great. Detail is excellent, with crisply defined edges, well-resolved textures and exacting close-ups. Universal's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track kicks down door after door, guns blazing. Shootouts, explosions, throaty dune buggies, roaring engines and thundering helicopter attacks feature ample low-end heft, and the LFE channel makes its presence known. And with bullets ricocheting, shrapnel flying and debris scattering, the sound field is immersive and involving.2 Guns fires wide and runs out of ammo long before its double and triple crosses are exhausted, making for an R-rated popcorn shoot-em-up that's big on action and little else. Washington, Wahlberg, Olmos, Paxton and Marsden keep it all entertaining, but only just. Universal's Blu-ray release is much better, with a terrific video presentation, hard-hitting DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track, and a solid complement of special features sure to satisfy fans of the film. Even so, it's only a matter of time before 2 Guns lands in the bargain bin.",4,2 Guns fires wide and runs out of ammo long before its double and triple crosses are exhausted.,1385078400,"11 22,

1631145,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B00BEIYN9Q,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[0, 2]","This film is well produced, photographed, and acted. The cast are well cast. The action is well choreographed. What's the problem. Why did I give it but one star?The problem is that the movie has a message - a definite point of view that producers want to get across while you are being distracted by the charm of the two male leads and the razzle-dazzle of all the shootings.What is the message? Simple - there are good guys and there are bad guys. The good guts are illegal aliens. The bad guys are any kind of white government figure - the whiter the more evil and corrupt. In this fevered mindset all the traditional institutions that show up to restore moral order - the cops, the FBI, the military - are shown to be crooks and sadists.Both Washington and  Wahlberg are bent but their sponsoring organizations even more so. The really evil organization in this profoundly anti-American propaganda piece is the CIA. The script keeps hammering away at the CIA so as to make the audience conditioned to its presence the way Spielberg did with the shark in 'Jaws'. When someone says 'CIA' everyone is supposed to cringe like when you heard that driving low theme and the camera focused on the water.There never has been a screen Nazi as cruel and sadistic as Bill Paxton is as the CIA guy in this movie. He makes Anton Differing look like Mr. Rogers. What is the agenda behind this over the top characterization? Paxton whom we remember as the clear eyed cool and charismatic tornado chaser in 'Twister' or as the warm hearted bigamist (trigamist?)  on HBO, is here the essence of corruption, betrayal and cruelty.Normally the US Military has always been portrayed in the movies as a source of stability and integrity. In the alien invasion films like 'War of the Worlds' or 'Battle Los Angeles' the military are just about the only groups you can trust. They may lose the struggle, but they die trying. Here, this movie designed to corrode the audience's faith in all conventional sources of American courage and hope. The Navy, as seen here, is filled with treacherous, corrupt and feckless characters. It's as if when the cavalry rides in to save the stage coach from the Indians your best response would be to shoot the troopers and embrace the savages.In this movie the murderous Mexican drug cartel hoodlums are still among the bad guys, but they are the most honorable and sympathetic of the various bad guy groups competing for our attention. They get to blame their badness on US foreign policy.So are there no groups that are sympathetic? Yes. There is one group that is portrayed as innocent victims. We are shown their suffering and encouraged to identify with them. These are the illegal aliens, who in a gratuitous scene that has nothing to do with the plot, are shown with the two male leads walking through the desert and wading the Rio Grande. Edward James Olmos gives a little political speech to orient the audience as to whom to hate - the United States.Paula Paton takes off her top for the very tepid sex scene with Washington. She is one of those half black female stars who looks mostly white so as to be attractive to mainstream audiences, but who still is dark enough to not freak out the white audience when she cavorts naked with the fully black male lead. At this point in our cultural evolution complete black-white romance is still taboo. Eva Mendes does much the same for Will Smith in his movies. Ms. Paton provides the gratuitous sex in a movie meal where the main course is gratuitous violence.I think with possibly only one exception - every star and every supporting character in this movie is shot at sometime or other. The male pair of 'buddy cops' of course just laugh it off. In the bad old days the hero could walk through a hail of gunfire unscathed. In today's more realistic shoot-em-ups, the heroes can get shot - but it doesn't bother them much.This is the kind of movie that you would like to like, but which is so transparent in its political manipulations that you are pulled right out of the fantasy experience. The motives of the movie makers are bad.

1631149,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYN9Q,Paul Allaer,"[36, 41]","""2 Guns"" (2013 release; 109 min.) reunites director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur with Mark Wahlberg (they previously teamed up on another enjoyable crime action movie called ""Contraband""), and for good measure Denzel Washington is brought along to co-star. The plot is pretty convoluted, and I don't spoil anything when I simply say that you shouldn't accept anyone being who they say they are. Apart from that, everyone is chasing $41.125 million in drug money.Several comments: first, once in a while I need to see a great action movie, and this one certainly lives up to its billing. As the movie opens we see the characters played by Washington and Wahlberg observing a bank which they've decided to rob, from across the street in a diner. Some funny back-and-forth banter between the two ensues but before you know it we are in the middle of the hold-up, and its aftermath. Second, almost more important than the actual plot is the writing of the movie. The script is sharp from that perspective, with lots of funny exchanges between the main characters. Third, the chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg is palpable, and carries much of the movie. Seems like these guys are enjoying themselves, so why wouldn't we enjoy ourselves too while watching the movie. Fourth, there are a number of smaller roles that nevertheless add a nice touch to the movie, in particular Edward James Olmos as the Mexican drug lord (made to look incredibly old for this role, which was also the case in that other recent movie he starred in, ""Filly Brown""), and even more so drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton (a/k/a Mrs. Robin Thicke) as Washington's friend-with-benefits.Bottom line: I really enjoyed this movie quite a bit, even more than I had expected/hoped for. I couldn't believe when the final scene came around, I mean time had simply flown by! The movie's ending incidentally would seem to open the door wide for a sequel (assuming this does well at the box office), so we may well be looking at ""3 Guns"" or ""2 Guns More"" in a year or two. The screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati today was quite well attended for a late matinee, and it seemed like the crowd was enjoying it as much as I was.

1631227,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00BEIYN9Q,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","2 Guns is a fairly standard buddy action film elevated slightly on the strength of its two leads:  Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.  The film is based on a graphic novel published by Boom! Studios.  Washington plays Robert Trench, and undercover DEA Agent and Wahlberg is Michael Stigman, and under cover Naval Intelligence Officer.  The rub here is that neither one knows the other is undercover.  They each think the other is a criminal in the process of making a buy and summarily taking down a Mexican drug lord named Papi Greco (Olmos).  Their plan involves robbing a small-town New Mexico bank that Papi uses to launder money.  However when they rob the bank, they found far more money than they expected&#8230;$43 million to be exact.After the heist, Stigman follows orders to betray Trench and escape with the money.  Bus discovering Tench is in law enforcement; he merely wounds him, rather than kill him.  Stegman is then betrayed himself by his commanding officer, Quince (James Marsden) who attempts to have him killed in the desert.  Stigman manages to escape and later meets up with Trench to try and figure out what is going on.  When they kidnap and interrogate Greco, they discover that the money they stole belongs to the CIA and a psychotic Black Ops Agent named Earl (Paxton) is intent on getting every dollar back, no matter who he has to kill.  He begins the bloodbath by killing Tench&#8217;s superior and framing him for the murder.  The DEA Agent and Naval Intelligence Office have to put aside their own differences to stay alive and try to retrieve the money.2 Guns offers little new in the way of the buddy cop/odd couple formula.  As you would expect Washington plays the more straight forward role while Walhberg plays the smartass part.  But both are so enjoyable that you can overlook the run-of-the-mill plot and the other one-dimensional characters.  Olmos is laughably tame as a &#8220;ruthless&#8221; drug lord.  At one point he captures the pair and hangs them upside down to beat them with baseball bats.  Well, beat is a little harsh; he gives them a few love taps like he&#8217;s trying to bunt for a base hit.  Paxton, however, steals the show as the sadistic CIA agent who enjoys forcing those he&#8217;s interrogating to play Russian Roulette.Despite being based on a graphic novel, the film borrows a bit too liberally from the vastly superior 1973 caper film &#8220;Charley Varrick&#8221; in which Walter Matthau led a small-time band of crooks in the robbery of (again) a small-town New Mexico Bank only to find much more money than expected.  There are shootouts aplenty as you might expect from the name as Trench and Stigman manages to fire their way out of one tight situation after another, each with more impossible odds than the previous.  Director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur does a fine job with the action scenes but it&#8217;s the in-between scenes that bog things down and make the film seem even longer than 109 minutes.The ending is predictable, especially in revealing the pair managed to stash away some of the money for them but it&#8217;s mostly a fun ride getting from beginning to end.Blu-Ray ExtrasAudio Commentary with Director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur and Producer Adam SiegelClick, Click, Bang, Bang: The Making of 2 Guns (30:18) &#8211; This is a four-part making of documentary that covers some of the main material discussed in the commentary but also features interviews with the cast as well as looks at wardrobe and weapons.Deleted Scenes (11:50) &#8211; Eight deleted scenes are included although none of them are essential and in a film that is already stretched 10 &#8211; 15 minutes too long you can see why these were cut.Tim Janson Mania Entertainment",3,Decent Buddy action flick,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3734,"['2', 'Guns', 'fairly', 'standard', 'buddy', 'action', 'film', 'elevated', 'slightly', 'strength', 'two', 'leads', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'published', 'Boom', 'Studios', 'Washington', 'Robert', 'Trench', 'undercover', 'DEA', 'Agent', 'Wahlberg', 'Michael', 'Stigman', 'cover', 'Naval', 'Intelligence', 'Officer', 'rub', 'here', 'one', 'other', 'undercover', 'think', 'other', 'criminal', 'process', 'making', 'buy', 'summarily', 'taking', 'down', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lord', 'named', 'Papi', 'Greco', 'Olmos', 'plan', 'robbing', 'small-town', 'New', 'Mexico', 'bank', 'Papi', 'launder', 'money', 'However', 'when', 'rob', 'bank', 'found', 'far', 'more', 'money', 'expected', '8230', '43', 'million', 'be', 'exact.After', 'heist', 'Stigman', 'orders', 'betray', 'Trench', 'escape', 'money', 'Bus', 'discovering', 'Tench', 'law', 'enforcement', 'merely', 'rather', 'kill', 'Stegman', 'then', 'betrayed', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Quince', 'James', 'Marsden', 'who', 'attempts', 'have', 'killed', 'desert', 'Stigman', 'escape', 'later', 'up', 'Trench', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'When', 'kidnap', 'interrogate', 'Greco', 'discover', 'money', 'stole', 'belongs', 'CIA', 'psychotic', 'Black', 'Ops', 'Agent', 'named', 'Earl', 'Paxton', 'intent', 'getting', 'dollar', 'back', 'matter', 'who', 'kill', 'bloodbath', 'killing', 'Tench', '8217', 'superior', 'framing', 'murder', 'DEA', 'Agent', 'Naval', 'Intelligence', 'Office', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'own', 'differences', 'stay', 'alive', 'try', 'retrieve', 'money.2', 'Guns', 'little', 'new', 'way', 'buddy', 'cop/odd', 'couple', 'formula', 'would', 'expect', 'Washington', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'role', 'Walhberg', 'smartass', 'part', 'are', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'overlook', 'run-of-the-mill', 'plot', 'other', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'Olmos', 'laughably', 'tame', '8220', 'ruthless', '8221', 'drug', 'lord', 'one', 'point', 'pair', 'hangs', 'upside', 'down', 'beat', 'baseball', 'bats', 'Well', 'beat', 'little', 'harsh', 'few', 'love', 'taps', '8217', 's', 'trying', 'bunt', 'base', 'hit', 'Paxton', 'however', 'show', 'sadistic', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'forcing', '8217', 'interrogating', 'play', 'Russian', 'Roulette.Despite', 'being', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'liberally', 'vastly', 'superior', '1973', 'caper', 'film', '8220', 'Charley', 'Varrick', '8221', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'led', 'small-time', 'band', 'crooks', 'robbery', 'again', 'small-town', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Bank', 'only', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'expected', 'are', 'shootouts', 'aplenty', 'might', 'expect', 'name', 'Trench', 'Stigman', 'fire', 'way', 'one', 'tight', 'situation', 'more', 'impossible', 'odds', 'previous', 'Director', 'Baltasar', 'Korm', 'aacute', 'kur', 'fine', 'job', 'action', 'scenes', '8217', 's', 'in-between', 'scenes', 'bog', 'things', 'down', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'even', 'longer', '109', 'minutes.The', 'ending', 'predictable', 'especially', 'revealing', 'pair', 'managed', 'stash', 'away', 'money', '8217', 'mostly', 'fun', 'ride', 'getting', 'beginning', 'end.Blu-Ray', 'ExtrasAudio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Baltasar', 'Korm', 'aacute', 'Producer', 'Adam', 'SiegelClick', 'Click', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'Making', '2', 'Guns', '30:18', '8211', 'four-part', 'making', 'documentary', 'main', 'material', 'discussed', 'commentary', 'also', 'interviews', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'looks', 'wardrobe', 'weapons.Deleted', 'Scenes', '11:50', '8211', 'Eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'none', 'are', 'essential', 'film', 'already', 'stretched', '10', '8211', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'cut.Tim', 'Janson', 'Mania', 'Entertainment']",N/A

The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns!

It looked like a forced buddy movie that most probably was going to dump a recycled Hollywood action plot on viewers.  But it is not a traditional buddy flick.  It is not a canned action story.  In fact, it has quite a few small twists that keep the movie interesting.The acting is superb, especially because both main characters are pretending to be people they are not when they are together.  And the supporting cast is terrific.  All well-known pros who become their characters.The action is fun, intense, but not over-the-top.  It is always believable.  It keeps coming too.The plot is fun because it has so many players after the same cash.  The two protagonists have to deal with each other, each one's respective group, a cruel CIA operative and his goons, as well as a drug kingpin and his cartel brothers.So, sit back and enjoy this one.
