782203,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B0000JLLCW,Jerry McDaniel,"[17, 18]","this DVD is great for fans of Conway who maybe didn't tape the TV special the first time around. however, i've seen pieces of this special all my life (i'm 27) and when i got the DVD i didn't see his performance of ""We Did But Now You Don't""...he performed it on deck while his hair was blowing all over the place. i've been made aware that other things are edited out like the Twitty City segments and the other reviewer, a fellow fan of Conway's like i am, brought up the Barbara Mandrell segment that was edited out despite her name being on the back cover of the DVD. Conway and Charley Pride's duet is edited out as is some of Jerry Lee's songs. the things that are on here are all top notch, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Dick Clark talking about the SUN and early rock 'n' roll years. Jerry's performance of ""You Win Again"" is hilarious. Ralph Emery nearly takes over the show acting as emcee midway through. i love Ralph and enjoy his professionalism. Loretta is on here as is Tammy Wynette and George Lindsay! Conway walks along Friars Point, his birthplace, with his mother talking about the past. the DVD is 68 minutes long...52 minutes have been taken out since the original was 120 minutes, 2 hours. you've got to get this edited version from the late '80s that TNN used to air that is on this DVD while it's here...the original un-edited version may not surface for a while and we don't want any of you missing out on at least 68 minutes of the program! this DVD is better than nothing.",4,great for people who don't have the original,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,1500,"['DVD', 'great', 'fans', 'Conway', 'who', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'tape', 'TV', 'special', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'however', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pieces', 'special', 'life', 'i', ""'m"", '27', 'when', 'i', 'got', 'DVD', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'performance', 'Did', 'Now', 'Do', ""n't"", 'performed', 'deck', 'hair', 'was', 'blowing', 'place', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'aware', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'edited', 'Twitty', 'City', 'segments', 'other', 'reviewer', 'fellow', 'fan', 'Conway', 'i', 'am', 'brought', 'up', 'Barbara', 'Mandrell', 'segment', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'name', 'being', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'Conway', 'Charley', 'Pride', 'duet', 'edited', 'out', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'songs', 'things', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'including', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'talking', 'SUN', 'early', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'years', 'Jerry', 'performance', 'Win', 'Again', 'hilarious', 'Ralph', 'Emery', 'nearly', 'show', 'acting', 'emcee', 'midway', 'i', 'love', 'Ralph', 'enjoy', 'professionalism', 'Loretta', 'here', 'Tammy', 'Wynette', 'George', 'Lindsay', 'Conway', 'walks', 'Friars', 'Point', 'birthplace', 'mother', 'talking', 'past', 'DVD', '68', 'minutes', 'long', '52', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'out', 'original', 'was', '120', 'minutes', '2', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'got', 'get', 'edited', 'version', 'late', ""'80s"", 'TNN', 'used', 'air', 'DVD', 'here', 'original', 'un-edited', 'version', 'may', 'not', 'surface', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'missing', 'out', 'least', '68', 'minutes', 'program', 'DVD', 'better', 'nothing']",N/A

As a diehard Country music fan who has seen many many live concerts and has travelled the circuit a few times, I am at a loss why in this year of 2006 why we cant have available live concerts with these artists with digital picture and video quality. This formerly televised piece was produced in the 1980's. The DVD has excellent content with much dialogue with Conway and his distinguished guests. It shows Loretta and Tammy and Charlie Pride when they were in their mid career's. The audio quality is terrible with the ever present hiss of the 8-track tape technology. Although disappointed I will keep this piece for its nostalgiac look at a few of my favourite artists while in their prime.",3,Very Nice.....but,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,823,"['Maybe', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'live', 'concert', 'sure', 'would', 'appreciate', 'excellent', 'sound', 'color', 'age', 'DVD', 'technology', 'diehard', 'Country', 'music', 'fan', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'live', 'concerts', 'travelled', 'circuit', 'few', 'times', 'am', 'loss', 'why', 'year', '2006', 'why', 'cant', 'have', 'available', 'live', 'concerts', 'artists', 'digital', 'picture', 'video', 'quality', 'formerly', 'televised', 'piece', 'was', 'produced', '1980', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'content', 'much', 'dialogue', 'Conway', 'distinguished', 'guests', 'Loretta', 'Tammy', 'Charlie', 'Pride', 'when', 'were', 'mid', 'career', 'audio', 'quality', 'terrible', 'ever', 'present', 'hiss', '8-track', 'tape', 'technology', 'disappointed', 'will', 'keep', 'piece', 'nostalgiac', 'look', 'few', 'favourite', 'artists', 'prime']",N/A
782205,A12ECMHW4ETVE4,B0000JLLCW,MusicFan2011,"[0, 0]","I saw this when it first was aired in the early 1980's. Nearly 30 years ago, my memory isn't what it used to be. I wasn't aware there was a lot of stuff edited out. I remember taping it off TNN after Conway passed in 1993. The version I saw was the same as this DVD, so I didn't realize I was missing so much of the original program. Country Music programming didn't have the high budget then that it has today, so of course the sound isn't pristine like it would be today in the digital era. But stuff like this is wonderful to have because these performances are classic. Be thankful there are companies who are willing to release this classic stuff. Conway & Tammy are gone now. Dick Clark, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Pride & Loretta Lynn are up in years, so I'm thankful to have a DVD from my era to look back & remember my favorites in their prime.
