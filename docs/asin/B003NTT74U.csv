I'm so glad people have finally figured out there's an audience for these old made-for-TV movies that got a lot of attention and hype on their first run; most of the families I knew in the late 70s didn't yet have cable movie channels and of course there weren't VCRs or DVD players back then, so you were stuck with what the TV networks decided to run for home entertainment.  Like most TV movies, this one was obviously made on a limited budget, but I didn't think that took away from the story.Figure skater Carrie (Joy Le Duc) has technical skills after being pushed to succeed in the sport for years by her bitter, single stage mom, but she lacks confidence and flair.  Hockey player Peter (Jimmy McNichol), a nice kid from a normal family, gets unfairly suspended from his team and decides that pairs figure skating with a girl he kind of likes anyway might be fun to try.  Together, they might have what it takes to be national champions, something they probably couldn't achieve apart.  McNichol, the brother of the more well-known child/ teen star Kristy McNichol, steals about every scene he's in, and was clearly cast for his ability to act just like Le Duc was cast for her ability to skate.  Watching as an adult I can definitely see some scenes where a double was probably used for ""Peter"" because the technical skills would require years of training (just as the movie covers several years).  Supposedly a skating double was used in some scenes for Le Duc as well, but that was harder for me to spot.  However, Le Duc acted reasonably well for a skater and McNichol skated reasonably well in the close-up scenes.  Tony Lo Bianco as the coach also had a few good scenes.To clear up some of the comments from other reviewers:  This is really NOT an ""80s movie,"" nor does it contain lots of ""fashion faux pas.""  It was released in 1979 and covers the time span from 1975 through '78 or '79.  So the clothing styles you see throughout are 70s all the way, and frankly pretty ordinary because the kids and their families clearly don't spend a lot of money and time on their clothes, or on dressing up to go out.  All their spare time and money gets spent at the ice rink.  The filmmakers put different hairdoes on Le Duc to make her character age-progress from a young to an older teen; initially she starts out with Cindy Brady dual pigtails that are supposed to make her look young (and do so) but also make her look like a dork - which kind of suits her character as her mother doesn't let her have much of a social life, she's just supposed to skate all the time.  I do remember feeling a little let down by the film being sold as a ""romance"" when Carrie and Peter barely even kiss (trust me, young teens usually did more intense kissing than that on a normal 70s date), but that also suits their characters as being shy kids who spend most of their time seriously training to skate.I definitely thought ""Ice Castles"" ripped off this film a bit when it came out.  Although the plot lines differ, you still have the same theme of a talented girl skater being encouraged to succeed by a boyfriend who also skates.  Of the two films, ""Champions"" is much more of a realistic story.",4,Brings back memories,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,3367,"['Watched', 'TV', 'young', 'teen', 'saw', 're-run', 'once', 'twice', 'when', 'happened', 'afternoon', 'movies', 'years', 'later', 'then', 'disappeared', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'forever', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'people', 'have', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'audience', 'old', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'got', 'lot', 'attention', 'hype', 'first', 'run', 'most', 'families', 'knew', 'late', '70s', 'did', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'cable', 'movie', 'channels', 'course', 'were', ""n't"", 'VCRs', 'DVD', 'players', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'stuck', 'what', 'TV', 'networks', 'decided', 'run', 'home', 'entertainment', 'most', 'TV', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'limited', 'budget', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'took', 'away', 'story.Figure', 'skater', 'Carrie', 'Joy', 'Le', 'Duc', 'technical', 'skills', 'being', 'pushed', 'succeed', 'sport', 'years', 'bitter', 'single', 'stage', 'mom', 'confidence', 'flair', 'Hockey', 'player', 'Peter', 'Jimmy', 'McNichol', 'nice', 'kid', 'normal', 'family', 'unfairly', 'suspended', 'team', 'pairs', 'figure', 'skating', 'girl', 'kind', 'likes', 'anyway', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'try', 'Together', 'might', 'have', 'what', 'be', 'national', 'champions', 'something', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'apart', 'McNichol', 'brother', 'more', 'well-known', 'child/', 'teen', 'star', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'steals', 'scene', 'was', 'clearly', 'cast', 'ability', 'act', 'just', 'Le', 'Duc', 'was', 'cast', 'ability', 'skate', 'Watching', 'adult', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'scenes', 'where', 'double', 'was', 'probably', 'used', 'Peter', 'technical', 'skills', 'would', 'require', 'years', 'training', 'just', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'Supposedly', 'skating', 'double', 'was', 'used', 'scenes', 'Le', 'Duc', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'harder', 'spot', 'However', 'Le', 'Duc', 'acted', 'reasonably', 'well', 'skater', 'McNichol', 'skated', 'reasonably', 'well', 'close-up', 'scenes', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'coach', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'good', 'scenes.To', 'clear', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'really', 'NOT', '80s', 'movie', 'contain', 'lots', 'fashion', 'faux', 'pas', 'was', 'released', '1979', 'time', 'span', '1975', ""'78"", 'clothing', 'styles', 'see', 'are', '70s', 'way', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'kids', 'families', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'money', 'time', 'clothes', 'dressing', 'up', 'go', 'out', 'spare', 'time', 'money', 'spent', 'ice', 'rink', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'different', 'hairdoes', 'Le', 'Duc', 'make', 'character', 'age-progress', 'young', 'older', 'teen', 'initially', 'out', 'Cindy', 'Brady', 'dual', 'pigtails', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'look', 'young', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'make', 'look', 'dork', 'kind', 'suits', 'character', 'mother', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'much', 'social', 'life', 'just', 'supposed', 'skate', 'time', 'do', 'remember', 'feeling', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'being', 'sold', 'romance', 'when', 'Carrie', 'Peter', 'barely', 'even', 'kiss', 'trust', 'young', 'teens', 'usually', 'did', 'more', 'intense', 'kissing', 'normal', '70s', 'date', 'also', 'suits', 'characters', 'being', 'shy', 'kids', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'seriously', 'training', 'skate.I', 'definitely', 'thought', 'Ice', 'Castles', 'ripped', 'film', 'bit', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'plot', 'lines', 'differ', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'theme', 'talented', 'girl', 'skater', 'being', 'encouraged', 'succeed', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'also', 'two', 'films', 'Champions', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'story']",N/A
