444877,A6J8D9V5S9MBE,6305034427,Curtis G,"[3, 3]","I'll say this right up front: &quot;Full Throttle&quot; is a damn good movie. The only thing is, if you're looking for a roadracing movie where the racing is primary and the plot is secondary, try &quot;Race for  Glory&quot; instead. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; is less about bikes and more  about relationships. Namely, the relationship between Joe, the street  racing king; Annie, Joe's long-suffering girlfriend; and new guy David, and  up-and-coming racer who befriends Joe.The street-racing scenes are more  than decent, but where the movie shines is in the drama department. Andy  Lau (Joe) looks suitably tortured as he recovers from a debilitating crash,  attempts to reconcile with his father, and tries to stop sabotaging his  relationship with Annie.Without the convincing dramatic elements, the  movie would not have held up, and while I would have preferred more racing,  I found &quot;Full Throttle&quot; to be a solid piece of work. You can't  ask for more than that.",4,"Good stuff, but it's less about bikes than you might expect.",959385600,"05 27, 2000",2000,980,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'quot', 'Full', 'Throttle', 'quot', 'damn', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'roadracing', 'movie', 'where', 'racing', 'primary', 'plot', 'secondary', 'try', 'quot', 'Race', 'Glory', 'quot', 'instead', 'quot', 'Full', 'Throttle', 'quot', 'less', 'bikes', 'more', 'relationships', 'Namely', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'street', 'racing', 'king', 'Annie', 'Joe', 'long-suffering', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'guy', 'David', 'up-and-coming', 'racer', 'who', 'Joe.The', 'street-racing', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'decent', 'where', 'movie', 'shines', 'drama', 'department', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'Joe', 'suitably', 'tortured', 'debilitating', 'crash', 'attempts', 'reconcile', 'father', 'tries', 'stop', 'sabotaging', 'relationship', 'Annie.Without', 'convincing', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'racing', 'found', 'quot', 'Full', 'Throttle', 'quot', 'be', 'solid', 'piece', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more']",Full Throttle

The available audio languages are Cantonese and Mandarin.  We used the English subtitles, since we don't speak any Chinese.  This is one of the best Chinese movies that we've seen.  We enjoyed the street racing, the plot, and the development of the relationships.  It's one of those rare movies that doesn't depend on violence and sex to keep the audience's attention.  This movie is not rated and it is certainly no more than a PG rating.",5,"Good story, good motorcycles, good acting",1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,548,"['rented', 'dvd', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'bought', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'available', 'audio', 'languages', 'are', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'used', 'English', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Chinese', 'one', 'best', 'Chinese', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'street', 'racing', 'plot', 'development', 'relationships', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', ""n't"", 'depend', 'violence', 'sex', 'keep', 'audience', 'attention', 'movie', 'not', 'rated', 'certainly', 'no', 'more', 'PG', 'rating']",Full Throttle

But things turn out that David is in Joe's dad's motorcycle team. See, Joe's mom died when he was young, and Him and his dad have what you might call not so good of a relationship.And there's Joe's struggling girlfriend, Annie(Gigi Leung), she wants Joe to stop racing because she is afraid of Joe getting killed in a race.One day, Joe races David and gets into a fatal accident, Joe re-thinks of what he is doing in life and becomes scared of bike. Annie is there for Joe, taking care of him and stuff. And when he finally gets out of the hospital, Annie wants him to promise her that he will never race again.......this is one of Andy's finest, of course his dramatic weight and presence is not as much as Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung, but he was almost there in this movie. The racing scenes were more than normal( think, it was made in 96.)But Gigi was kinda....ehhh how can i put this, i believe 96 was the time she was developing as an actress. however, overall a very good movie so check it out.and Legend of SPeed starring Ekin Cheng, Kelly Lin, Cecilia Cheung is a *sequel* to this movie..see if you look at Legend of Speed opening, it says Full Throttle 2 in Chinese...",5,Full Throttle then Legend of speed......,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,1329,"['Joe', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'motorcycle', 'streetracer', 'illegally', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'One', 'night', 'young', 'racer', 'named', 'David', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'David', 'Joe', 'dad', 'motorcycle', 'team', 'See', 'Joe', 'mom', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Him', 'dad', 'have', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'relationship.And', 'Joe', 'struggling', 'girlfriend', 'Annie', 'Gigi', 'Leung', 'Joe', 'stop', 'racing', 'afraid', 'Joe', 'getting', 'killed', 'race.One', 'day', 'Joe', 'David', 'fatal', 'accident', 'Joe', 're-thinks', 'what', 'doing', 'life', 'scared', 'bike', 'Annie', 'there', 'Joe', 'taking', 'care', 'stuff', 'when', 'finally', 'hospital', 'Annie', 'promise', 'will', 'never', 'race', 'again', '.this', 'one', 'Andy', 'finest', 'course', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'presence', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'was', 'almost', 'there', 'movie', 'racing', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'normal', 'think', 'was', 'made', '96', 'Gigi', 'was', 'kinda', 'how', 'can', 'i', 'put', 'i', 'believe', '96', 'was', 'time', 'was', 'developing', 'actress', 'however', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'so', 'check', 'Legend', 'SPeed', 'starring', 'Ekin', 'Cheng', 'Kelly', 'Lin', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', '*sequel*', 'movie..see', 'look', 'Legend', 'Speed', 'opening', 'Full', 'Throttle', '2', 'Chinese']",Full Throttle

Andy Lau plays a young kid who loves to race.  After hsi friend is ina serious accident, he sort of rethinks things.  He develops a very good friendship with a rich kid but they end up becoming enemies.  Andy is part of his own racing team and his friend becomes part of another.  So now they race to see who is better, right?  Well the movie has a little more to it than that.Now I won't give anything away, but my favorite part of the movie is a certain death scene.  It is a scene where a guy gets up from under a semi after being run over and you will have to watch it and see why it is one of my top 10 death scenes ever.  I have truly never seen anything like it before.Now Andy Lau has a lot going on in his life.  He wants to go and become a real racer, his girlfriend doesn't want him to race anymore, and all that he is really worried about is defeating his former friend.  So of course the movie comes down to one final race.  I won't tell you whether it is a happy or a sad ending but will say that the ending was a very nice change to most movies you will see and I almost had to give it a 5 stars because of that. I wouldn't watch this repeated times but it was still very good and will get at least one more watch by me.",4,Very good movie,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1370,"['movie', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'movie', 'racing', 'are', 'couple', 'very', 'good', 'races', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'race', 'hsi', 'friend', 'ina', 'serious', 'accident', 'sort', 'rethinks', 'things', 'very', 'good', 'friendship', 'rich', 'kid', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'enemies', 'Andy', 'part', 'own', 'racing', 'team', 'friend', 'part', 'So', 'now', 'race', 'see', 'who', 'better', 'right', 'Well', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'that.Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'certain', 'death', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'guy', 'up', 'semi', 'being', 'run', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'top', '10', 'death', 'scenes', 'ever', 'have', 'truly', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'lot', 'going', 'life', 'go', 'become', 'real', 'racer', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'want', 'race', 'anymore', 'really', 'worried', 'defeating', 'former', 'friend', 'course', 'movie', 'down', 'one', 'final', 'race', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'happy', 'sad', 'ending', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'change', 'most', 'movies', 'will', 'see', 'almost', 'had', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'repeated', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'get', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'watch']",Full Throttle
444881,A3SOE7OSDTAT8E,6305034427,"R. Li ""roninja""","[0, 0]","This is an awesome film!!!  Andy Lau and David Wu give award-winning performances as 2 motorcycle racers who are not only rivals but unlikely friends.  At the end, friendship prevails and both characters mature in their life.  Andy Lau plays a 26 year old illegal biker who just gets his license back after being suspend for seven yrs.  David Wu plays his 25 year old unlikely best friend who eventually saves his relationship with his fiance played by 18 year old Gigi Leung.The only complaint I have is that this is a bare-bones DVD.  The subtitles are burnt into the picture although you have both the Cantonese and Mandarin language options.  The trailer is also absent.  Recently, this movie has come out in Blu-Ray, however it's very expensive.
