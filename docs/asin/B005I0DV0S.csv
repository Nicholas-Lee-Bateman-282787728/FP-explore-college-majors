1461668,A3HTV3W2AOKSYN,B005I0DV0S,Dennis S. Johnson,"[0, 0]","I bought this set of five Christmas and one Thanksgiving set movies specifically for &#34;A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES&#34; which stars the late Denham Elliott.  It's a beautiful, poetic telling and visualization of Dylan Thomas's story. I had it on VHS tape and played it every year at Christmas. Unfortunately, the tape began to show its age so I looked for a DVD of the film and found it in this collection.This is Volume 3 of Echo Bridge's collection of &#34;Holiday Collector's Sets.&#34;  Of the six films, five are made-for-TV movies that date back to 1986 (&#34;A Child's Christmas in Wales&#34;) and up to 2010's &#34;A Family Thanksgiving.&#34;  The one feature film is &#34;Music of the Heart&#34; from MIramax in 1999. It stars Meryl Streep and Aidan Quinn. Each film has a sentimental and soap-opera quality to it, as most Christmas stories do: tales of longing, lost love, redemption, overcoming obstacles, friendship, and good cheer. Because these were mostly made for TV the quality is a bit like most TV movies a tad mediocre. The most professional film here, though not the best directed, is &#34;&#34;Music of the Heart.&#34;  If you like holiday stories, the kind that run on Hallmark or Lifetime channels, you will probably enjoy this set. And if you are looking for a specific holiday movie, as I was, check out the other volumes in this series. You may find that long lost treasure as I did.

""A Christmas Without Snow"" is an older program and definitely shows - the audio/video quality is poor.But the real gem on this set is ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" - I can only describe this movie as the Welsh equivalent of ""A Christmas Story"" - this is a wonderful little program, while only about an hour in length, it completely captures your attention and makes you feel the wonder of Christmas as you might have experienced from your own childhood & warms your heart like no other holiday program I can think of.

I couldn&#8217;t take more than 25 minutes before turning it off.A Christmas without Snow is not Christmassy at all.  It was very depressing.  Another1970s era movie.  I ended it after about 15 minutes.Music of the Heart is not a Christmas movie at all.  It is the only movie on this set that was not made for TV.  It&#8217;s ok.  I suspect this DVD set was made just to showcase that movie.A Family Thanksgiving is one of those movies the Hallmark channel likes to make where they show a career woman what a big mistake she made with her life by choosing a career over a family.  I just wish for once they made a movie that showed she could have both.  Why is it one or the other.Borrowed Hearts is good and the best part of this set.  A cranky business owner hires a woman and her daughter to pretend to be his family over the holidays to impress an investor.  Of course, they fall in love.
