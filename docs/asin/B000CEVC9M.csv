Hopefully, when the Avengers live-action movie is released, we get to see the Hulk take on all the Avengers and beat them within an inch of their lives!I am a big Hulk fan, but I like Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Giant Man, Wasp, and Black Widow, but even these seven heroes cannot stop the Incredible Hulk!

I'm 41 years old and grew up immersed in the Marvel comic universe until at least twelve or more. Just seeing these superheroes before me fighting, talking, with all their powers intact as I remember them was a shear pleasure. Enough was given of charactor development for this storyline. The voices matched well to the animation, and that comes from someone who was avidly reading the Avengers when a few of you reviewers were in diapers or not even born.The Hulk fight was spectacular. That is exactly how the Hulk is supposed look, sound and smash. The animation may not have been on par with of the stuff being done today, but it still had a great Marvel ""look"". I believe this has been a long overdue effort that simply works because these charactors needed to come alive properly in a full length movie. It's always great for these guys to fight Nazi's and aliens, how deep do you want to analyze it.Watch this with the home theatre system turned up nice(especially the Hulk fight).You'd be surprised what good audio can do.

I must say that I've really enjoyed the big screen Iron Man films, and to a lesser extent Thor and Captain America. Decided to watch this one over the weekend to gear up for the big screen, live-action Avengers flick. It wasn't bad. The one thing that animation always has going for it is that you can do pretty much anything. I'll grant you that CGI is getting there, but animated features still rule the school yard in this arena.I wasn't used to seeing such a neurotic Bruce Banner, but the rest of the characters were pretty much spot on. Thor was a little flaky... But Tony Stark was the playboy alcoholic, Black Widow was the seductive, yet deadly spy. Captain America bled red, white, and blue. The team was well represented, even if there were some substitutions between the animated and live action line-ups.  The Hellicarrier was great. Nick Fury was the more modern Sam Jackson director, than the ""grey around the temples"" Fury that so many of us grew up with. To remain spoiler-free, can I say that the final conflict stretched believability just a bit, even in a superhero universe. Still, it was a fun ride.A strong voice cast, including Grey DeLisle, OLivia D'Abo, and Justin Gross really brings this animated flick home.

This new animated feature is adapted from the Ultimates Avenger comic book series as it details a modern retelling of the origins of the original Avengers team. Instead of Captain America being found in stasis during the 60's he is now found frozen in a glacier after successfully destroying a Nazi superweapon at the tail end of World War II. We then skip ahead 60 years to the present where General Nick Fury and Dr. Betty Ross discovery of a preserved Captain America puts new life into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s super-soldier project. But Captain America may not be enough to stop the growing threat from a hostile alien species whom Captain America had fought during WW2 and who have suddenly reappeared in the present. From here on in Nick Fury is ordered by his superiors to begin Project Avengers and ends up recruiting an eclectic band of new superpowered heroes for Captain America to lead. There's husband and wife team of Hank and Janet Pym aka Giant-Man and The Wasp. Billionaire industrialist playboy Tony Stark as Iron-Man. Natalia Romanoff as the secret-agent Black Widow. Rounding out this team are the two heavy-hitters in the group: an unstable Hulk and an individual who calls himself Thor, the Asgard God of Thunder.The story is pretty basic and simple as its really just an introductory tale to get all the cast of characters together to fight a looming threat. Like most stories that deal with introduction there's not much meat to the Ultimate Avengers movie, but its does handle the team's assembling, rough first mission and its triumphant teamwork in beating their enemies in the end. The film's running time of just over an hour also hinders giving the characters much time to grow. But with an Ultimate Avengers II already set for a July 2006 release date then this little flaw can be overlooked. The fight scenes from both the WW2 intro sequence and the fights in the present are drawn well with minimal CGI-animations. When CGI is used its seamlessly put together with the traditional animation work that its hard to pick them out. The main fight in the end with a surprising opponent is well choreographed and shows just how powerful and primal the Hulk can be. It's not yet on the same level as the big fight scenes in DC's Justice League Unlimited series, but I think in time it'll reach that highly set bar.For a first try at feature animations, Marvel did well in making sure Ultimate Avengers: The Movie is worthy of the cast of characters beloved by legions of comic book fans. While it's not perfect and probably will be nitpicked to death by the uber-elitist comic book fanatics, as a starting point for the rest of the fans out there it's a very good start. All I can say is that I hope there'll be more calls of ""Avengers Assemble!"" for a long time to come.",4,Avengers Assemble!,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2893,"['Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'Movie', 'first', 'animated', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'Comic', 'animated', 'features', 'division', 'new', 'animated', 'feature', 'adapted', 'Ultimates', 'Avenger', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'details', 'modern', 'retelling', 'origins', 'original', 'Avengers', 'team', 'Instead', 'Captain', 'America', 'being', 'found', 'stasis', '60', 'now', 'found', 'frozen', 'glacier', 'successfully', 'destroying', 'Nazi', 'superweapon', 'tail', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'then', 'skip', 'ahead', '60', 'years', 'present', 'where', 'General', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Dr.', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'discovery', 'preserved', 'Captain', 'America', 'new', 'life', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'super-soldier', 'project', 'Captain', 'America', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'stop', 'growing', 'threat', 'hostile', 'alien', 'species', 'whom', 'Captain', 'America', 'had', 'fought', 'WW2', 'who', 'have', 'suddenly', 'reappeared', 'present', 'here', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'ordered', 'superiors', 'begin', 'Project', 'Avengers', 'up', 'recruiting', 'eclectic', 'band', 'new', 'superpowered', 'heroes', 'Captain', 'America', 'lead', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Hank', 'Janet', 'Pym', 'Giant-Man', 'Wasp', 'Billionaire', 'industrialist', 'playboy', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron-Man', 'Natalia', 'Romanoff', 'secret-agent', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Rounding', 'out', 'team', 'are', 'two', 'heavy-hitters', 'group', 'unstable', 'Hulk', 'individual', 'who', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'God', 'Thunder.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'basic', 'simple', 'really', 'just', 'introductory', 'tale', 'get', 'cast', 'characters', 'together', 'fight', 'looming', 'threat', 'most', 'stories', 'deal', 'introduction', 'not', 'much', 'meat', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'handle', 'team', 'assembling', 'first', 'mission', 'triumphant', 'teamwork', 'beating', 'enemies', 'end', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'just', 'hour', 'also', 'giving', 'characters', 'much', 'time', 'grow', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'II', 'already', 'set', 'July', '2006', 'release', 'date', 'then', 'little', 'flaw', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'fight', 'scenes', 'WW2', 'intro', 'sequence', 'fights', 'present', 'are', 'drawn', 'well', 'minimal', 'CGI-animations', 'When', 'CGI', 'used', 'seamlessly', 'put', 'together', 'traditional', 'animation', 'work', 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'main', 'fight', 'end', 'surprising', 'opponent', 'well', 'choreographed', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'primal', 'Hulk', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'yet', 'same', 'level', 'big', 'fight', 'scenes', 'DC', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'series', 'think', 'time', ""'ll"", 'reach', 'highly', 'set', 'bar.For', 'first', 'try', 'feature', 'animations', 'Marvel', 'did', 'well', 'making', 'sure', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'Movie', 'worthy', 'cast', 'characters', 'beloved', 'legions', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'not', 'perfect', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'nitpicked', 'death', 'uber-elitist', 'comic', 'book', 'fanatics', 'starting', 'point', 'rest', 'fans', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'start', 'can', 'say', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'calls', 'Avengers', 'Assemble', 'long', 'time', 'come']",N/A

The story is just as deep as what you'd read in the comics and is very interesting from beginning to end. Being a longtime Avengers fan, I was happy to see Marvel do something with them in animated form(although I'd be even happier if they did a live action version of the Avengers). It was very entertaining.Although, I will agree with some of the other reviewers here at Amazon. I expected more out of Marvel as far as the animation goes.

When I first got it, I was expecting it to be more like the Spawn animated movies as far as animation goes.

Freeman ""collin_normal64""","[0, 0]","Back in 2005 I attended Wizard's Comicon in Rosemont, IL and was fortunate enough to sit through a preview with the Lion's Gate & Marvel Productions folks regarding a new line of straight-to-DVD animated features.  They mentioned the first would be the Avengers from the first Ultimates storyline, then Iron Man, and then a 3rd character who had hardly ever made it to the little or big screen.  At the session they screened a brief 1-2 minute clip of animation from the overseas studio who had won the contract to make the animated movie.  The clip was of Captain America and Giant-man fighting the Hulk in downtown New York, ala the first 5 issues of The Ultimates, which we were told would be the story for this first movie.Folks, I am here to tell you that this movie bears some resemblence to what we were shown and told, but it is in fact a Saturday morning or afternoon Cartoon Network version of the Avengers, plain and simple.  The animation is of such low quality for a movie, direct to DVD or not, that I am appalled.  The story is not exactly the first few issues of the Ultimates.  It is more a meshing of those issues with the next issues that featured the Ultimates fighting an alien race sent to overtake the Earth. The scene(s) we saw at Comicon do not appear in this film, and the animation snippet that we saw was at least 2-3 times better than the final product.Anything good?  Yes, the voices were okay.  But overall it reminded me of something for the 12-14 year crowd (and my apologies to anyone in that age group who feels offended by my assumption that you would really like this drek).If this is what Lion's Gate has in store for us for the upcoming DVDs, I choose to keep my money and spend it elsewhere.  After all of the good things Marvel Films has done for franchises like X-Men and Spiderman, they sure dropped the ball this time with an animated feature, something you would think a comic book company would have more knowledge and sense to have come out extremely well.Buyers beware.

Whoever decided that mashing the two storylines into a sloppy and uneven hour-long poorly directed cartoon needs to be fired before Marvel winds up with a catastrophic string of direct-to-DVD animated adaptations besmirching its finely written titles.The dialogue, the pacing, the structure, and the character development in the movie are almost entirely terrible. The details and the thematic elements that make Millar's ""Ultimates"" series sensational are all but completely dropped from the screenplay. What is left is a rushed script with a hackneyed plot populated by almost entirely flat characters and anticlimactic action sequences. As for the music, most video games today have better soundtracks than this movie's (not to mention battle scenes). The voice acting was only passable.

On the positive side, the animation is fairly solid and mostly faithful to the Hitch's ""Ultimates"" artistic vision; however, that is the only positive aspect of the movie.About thirty minutes into the viewing, I was wishing it would just end already. I am a little bit surprised that Millar allowed his name to be attached to this project, but I guess he made some decent money off of it.If you like mindless super hero action that requires no thought whatsoever (except perhaps critical), if you can stand to walk away from a movie and take nothing of value away from it, if you can allow yourself to waste time watching a movie so vapid that you forget everything about it immediately afterward, then I can sadly recommend this picture for you.For everybody else, avoid this movie at all costs.One final note: there is a preview for the upcoming ""Ultimate Avengers II"" follow-up movie included on the disc. The sequel has absolutely nothing to do with Millar's storylines and promises to be even worse than the original. So for all of you hoping that Marvel's animated team will correct the heinous mistakes it committed on this project... don't. From all appearances the creative team likely will shed any remnants of Millar's original ideas and goof about in a 1980s cartoon world mentality.Also please keep in mind that this is supposed to be the first in a series of direct-to-DVD Marvel animated adaptations. I personally shudder at the thought. Millar and Bendis (two of Marvel's most talented and influential writers) ought to slap around Avi Arad or whomever is responsible for this blunderous venture. Maybe then we can expect some quality animated movies in Marvel's future.",1,There's a reason the screenwriter didn't credit himself for this movie on IMDB,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,2855,"['writer', 'film-maker', 'self-admitted', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'was', 'greatly', 'let', 'down', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'less', 'mediocre', 'adaptation', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'work', 'Marvel', 'Ultimates', 'series', 'mashed', 'together', 'soggier', 'aspects', 'old', 'school', 'Avengers', 'title', 'Whoever', 'decided', 'mashing', 'two', 'storylines', 'sloppy', 'uneven', 'hour-long', 'poorly', 'directed', 'cartoon', 'needs', 'be', 'fired', 'Marvel', 'up', 'catastrophic', 'string', 'direct-to-DVD', 'animated', 'adaptations', 'besmirching', 'finely', 'written', 'titles.The', 'dialogue', 'pacing', 'structure', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'terrible', 'details', 'thematic', 'elements', 'make', 'Millar', 'Ultimates', 'series', 'sensational', 'are', 'completely', 'dropped', 'screenplay', 'What', 'left', 'rushed', 'script', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'populated', 'almost', 'entirely', 'flat', 'characters', 'anticlimactic', 'action', 'sequences', 'music', 'most', 'video', 'games', 'today', 'have', 'better', 'soundtracks', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'battle', 'scenes', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'only', 'passable', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'much', 'voice', 'talent', 'came', 'video', 'game', 'V.O', 'backgrounds', 'positive', 'side', 'animation', 'fairly', 'solid', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'Hitch', 'Ultimates', 'artistic', 'vision', 'however', 'only', 'positive', 'aspect', 'movie.About', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'was', 'wishing', 'would', 'just', 'end', 'already', 'am', 'little', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Millar', 'allowed', 'name', 'be', 'attached', 'project', 'guess', 'made', 'decent', 'money', 'it.If', 'mindless', 'super', 'hero', 'action', 'thought', 'whatsoever', 'perhaps', 'critical', 'can', 'stand', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'take', 'nothing', 'value', 'away', 'can', 'allow', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'vapid', 'forget', 'everything', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'then', 'can', 'sadly', 'recommend', 'picture', 'you.For', 'everybody', 'else', 'avoid', 'movie', 'costs.One', 'final', 'note', 'preview', 'upcoming', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'II', 'follow-up', 'movie', 'included', 'disc', 'sequel', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'Millar', 'storylines', 'promises', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'original', 'So', 'hoping', 'Marvel', 'animated', 'team', 'will', 'correct', 'heinous', 'mistakes', 'committed', 'project', 'do', ""n't"", 'appearances', 'creative', 'team', 'likely', 'will', 'shed', 'remnants', 'Millar', 'original', 'ideas', 'goof', '1980s', 'cartoon', 'world', 'mentality.Also', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'direct-to-DVD', 'Marvel', 'animated', 'adaptations', 'personally', 'shudder', 'thought', 'Millar', 'Bendis', 'two', 'Marvel', 'most', 'talented', 'influential', 'writers', 'ought', 'slap', 'around', 'Avi', 'Arad', 'responsible', 'blunderous', 'venture', 'Maybe', 'then', 'can', 'expect', 'quality', 'animated', 'movies', 'Marvel', 'future']",N/A

I don't think Captain America's character was translated well from the comic to the movie.  The best part of the movie is the end where they fight the Hulk.  I purchased the DVD because I'm a comic book collector and fan of the series, but the DVD was really lacking anything of value besides the movie.  There could have been a lot of extras Marvel could have put on the DVD like digital versions of some of the comics, more interviews with authors and writers, background information on the characters in the movie, and more previews about what Marvel has in the works.  I was surprised to see Elektra on the DVD as a preview.  Marvel is headed in the right direction with straight to DVD movies, but they need to dig deeper into their chests for good stories.  I do think this is the best format for the Avengers, I think it would be very hard to make the Avengers into a real live action movie like the X-Men because there are too many dominant characters on the roster.  Iron Man could have  his own movie.  This is a good start, but Marvel should take notes from DC, their animated shows are much better in almost every way.If you are die hard fan, then buy it, for everyone else, rent it.I still don't understand how the UMD can cost just as much if not more than the DVD.

That being said, perhaps I've been a so spoiled by the writing quality of JLU from WB that I expected much more from Lionsgate with Ultimate Avengers. I'll admit, I didn't enjoy it on first viewing but after I set my own expectations aside, I found it to be a very well done opening!In this one, we start back at the end of World War II when Captain America seemingly died after stopping a nuclear warhead from reaching its target. In reality, he fell from the exploding missle into the Atlantic Ocean where he remained frozen for 60 years! He is awakened by Nick Fury and SHIELD to help form a team of super-heroes to stop a new alien threat...........which happens to be the same threat Captain America fought back in WWII!The characters strikingly different here than in the traditional past. Captain America isn't as optimistic but still is the brave solider that we all know. Iron Man is kept about the same as he is in the comics and in other animated features of the past. Thor has no secret identity anymore of Dr. Donald Blake. He's just Thor! Henry and Janet Pym aren't the lovey dovey couple they were in the old school comics either! Janet is actually a mutant with the same ""Wasp"" powers but Henry (while still a brilliant scientist) is a big jackass here! From what I understand, their relationship in particular was toned down for this feature because in the ""Ultimates"" line of comics, Henry was actually physically abusive to Janet and even got into a fist fight with Captain America himself over her! As a result, Cap and Janet actually dated for awhile! Here, the Pyms just argue constantly but the heated tension is there to where you think something COULD happen.The Black Widow is still very much the person she is in the comics. Dr. Bruce Banner and Betty Ross have a strained relationship due to his transformations into the Hulk and Nick Fury is recast as an african-american! I was shocked by this at first but I've grown to love it though I do miss the classic Nick Fury.I thought that the animation was suspect a little but nothing bad. I agree that the way the characters are drawn are more realistic than even in Justice League. Both the men and women dress like they are going into battle instead of a costumed ball.Overall, I found this to be a watchable feature.

957836,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B000CEVC9M,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[17, 28]","For years now, post-childhood animation fans have complained that most, if not all, comic-book-based action series have been thematically hobbled by the demands of TV network executives, which rarely allow for a series to adapt the parent comic books' content `as is'.  Ultimate Avengers, produced independently of a TV network, seeks to redeem comic-book action in animated form.This movie is loosely based on the Ultimates comic book series, by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch.  The comic book offers a revisionist take on Marvel Comics' venerable superheroes such as Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Mighty Thor, and more.  Opening during Captain America's World War II origins, the film finds him flash-frozen in Arctic waters after diverting a nuclear bomb from USA shores.  Thought to be killed in action, he is accidentally discovered and revived in today's world.  General Nick Fury of SHIELD (a quasi-military US intelligence agency) recruits `Cap' to be one of his new team of `Avengers', super-powered champions who will fight against threats that the traditional authorities (including the military) can't handle.The main threat that now faces them is an alien invasion of shape-changers.  The Avengers team also includes Hank Pym, aka Giant-Man, whose super-power is self-explanatory; his girl Jan, who becomes the fairy-like Wasp;  daredevil billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man;  the vainglorious Thor, who claims to be a mythological deity; and brooding scientist Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk.  Also in the mix is the mysterious Russian expatriate called the Black Widow.The main conflict involves the team's formation with their conflicting personalities, which they must somehow get over in order to repel the alien threat; however, there is another threat bubbling underneath the surface-Bruce Banner.  Currently, his mental control over his brutish alter ego the Hulk is assured-but for how long?The specter of 90's animation pioneer Bruce Timm looms large over all comic-book related productions that have come together in his wake.  In defense of Ultimate Avengers, there are several animation veterans involved in this production, including Curt Geda and Greg Johnson, who have both worked on DC/Warner cartoons in the 90's.  The look of the characters is closely modeled after Hitch's original comics drawings, but adapted to be more fluid in animation. Produced in association with prominent indie studio Lion's Gate, Ultimate Avengers clearly makes the most of what was likely a modest budget, mostly involving cel animation combined with some CGI.  Hopefully, animation buffs aren't totally spoiled by the CGI revolution to appreciate cel productions (outside of Japanese anime'); and hopefully `toon aficionados won't be relentlessly jaded against non-Timm superhero productions.This is the first in a planned series of straight-to-dvd animated productions by Marvel & Lion's Gate.

957837,AY8C0WLCA5GD2,B000CEVC9M,Isaac J. Mahoney,"[2, 3]","While managing to introduce some famous superheroes, Ultimate Avengers feels rushed and the characters underused.  It has moments but never takes the time to develop anyone other than Captain America, Nick Fury and Bruce Banner.  This is partly due to the film itself, and partly because it was released before major motion pictures Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.  After witnessing Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man, the Tony Stark here was incredibly disappointing.  Bruce Banner is exceptionally whiny, and Thor is hardly even in the movie.  However, there are some great moments with Wasp and Giant-Man and I appreciated being introduced to Black Widow.The other aspects of the film are so-so.  The art itself works pretty well, but most of the military equipment is drawn with cgi and apparently no effort was made to blend the two styles together.  The story is adequate but its pacing helter skelter.  I'm not very familiar with the Avengers, (I've read a few of the first issues, watched a few tv episodes, etc) so I at least appreciated getting to know some lesser known heroes and seeing the characters work as a team.  I won't give away what it is, but the end fight is particularly impressive.Overall, I enjoyed watching it but left feeling empty. Ultimate Avengers is worth seeing if you're a fan or want a quick introduction to the Avengers, but nothing worth adding to your DVD library.  I'd recommend seeing Avengers just because your appreciation of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and the new Marvel films will be much, much higher.",2,"Worth Watching, but ""Ultimately"" pretty disappointing",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1547,"['managing', 'introduce', 'famous', 'superheroes', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'feels', 'rushed', 'characters', 'underused', 'moments', 'never', 'time', 'develop', 'anyone', 'other', 'Captain', 'America', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'partly', 'due', 'film', 'partly', 'was', 'released', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'witnessing', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'here', 'was', 'incredibly', 'disappointing', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'exceptionally', 'whiny', 'Thor', 'hardly', 'even', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'Wasp', 'Giant-Man', 'appreciated', 'being', 'introduced', 'Black', 'Widow.The', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'so-so', 'art', 'pretty', 'well', 'most', 'military', 'equipment', 'drawn', 'cgi', 'apparently', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'blend', 'two', 'styles', 'together', 'story', 'adequate', 'pacing', 'helter', 'skelter', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'Avengers', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'first', 'issues', 'watched', 'few', 'tv', 'episodes', 'etc', 'so', 'least', 'appreciated', 'getting', 'know', 'lesser', 'known', 'heroes', 'seeing', 'characters', 'work', 'team', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'end', 'fight', 'particularly', 'impressive.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'want', 'quick', 'introduction', 'Avengers', 'nothing', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'library', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Avengers', 'just', 'appreciation', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'new', 'Marvel', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'higher']",N/A

The result, however, is a confusing attempt to blend styles and cater to mixed audiences.  At parts I was incredibly interested, caught up in the nostalgia of Marvel comics, and at other times I was somewhat aggravated with the efforts.  Overall I'd say it's still fairly great, but there are a few aspects that don'tWhen a ""Super-Serum"" is used to turn a WWII era U.S. soldier into Captain America, the Nazis quickly meet their match.  Unfortunately for the Captain, the Nazis have aliens called the Chitauri on their side, and a nuclear warhead.  While thwarting the enemy's efforts the Cpt. Gets knocked unconscious and falls from the sky, landing in freezing water where he is preserved in a glacier.  Fast forward to the future where Gen. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. is pressing Dr. Bruce Banner to complete the serum.  After multiple failures, and a discover/dethawing of Cpt. America, Fury is forced to compile a crew of superheroes to combat the Chitauri.  Among those recruited for Project Avenger are: Cpt America, Natalia Romanov - Black Widow, Hank Pym - Ant Man (Giant Man), Janet Van Dyne-Pym - Wasp, Tony Stark - Iron Man, and Thor.Despite initial difficulties with teamwork and leadership, not to mention subsequent setbacks when encountering the Chitauri, the team - along with a little help from an unexpected, albeit angry visitor - comes together for the triumphant final battle.  Only then do they face the real battle, versus a completely enraged, absolutely P.O.'d Hulk.The story and action are great.  Good enough for an actual motion picture (perhaps when the X-Men run their course).  The characters and animation, on the other hand, are irritating and lacking, respectively.  Nick Fury, a cigar-chomping white guy, is turned into a bald black guy with an eye patch.  Completely pointless change.  And Thor is made out to be a drunken, deranged idiot, someone protesting like an indoctrinated college student.  The animation is sketchy at best.  Some scenes are flawless, while others look like they were handed off to the B-Team of animators.  Several walking scenes are painfully choppy, like flipbook animation, but other scenes - like the final battle - are absolutely epic.NOTEWORTHY SPECIAL FEATURES:*Avengers Assemble - Great history lesson of the Avengers, completely awesome and worth the viewing*The Ultimate Voice Talent Search - Mostly a collection of voice submissions by hopeless morons who better hope their videos don't make it to Youtube.

957841,A17CP110C6E9KF,B000CEVC9M,"JBizzle ""Da Fizzle Shizzle, Dizzle""","[5, 24]","Okay, maybe for those of you who just looked at all the pretty pictures in Ultimates Vol #1 this will in fact be a direct adaptation for you.  However, for those of you who actually read the book, you're probably gonna be a little dissapointed.  Read my review and you'll see why.  All these other reveiwers obviosly haven't seen the movie, they've all just read articles about how cool it's supposed to be and have hyped themselves up so high that I think they're gonna feel like crying once they've seen the actual movie.  Just so everyone knows this movie is loosely based on Marvels ""Ultimates"" series one written by Mark Millar.  I say loosely because it only takes some of the elemants from that series like costumes. Most everything else is different, even the origins of the team itself is different from in the book.  Some of the crucial parts of the series that really gave it it's originality is completly left out, such as the domestic abuse between ""Giant Man & Wasp"".  I was under the impression this movie was an animated feature geared mainly towards adults.  In some ways I suppose maybe yes, there is maybe some subject matter still left in tact, but definately still geared for a family audiance.  this is not a direct a straight adaptation of the book like I'd heard so much about, some of the visual scenes in the book are there, but not in the same context as in the book.  The other thing about this that bummed me out was the animation.  I heard all this talk about how Lions Gate was using some special state of the art animation, and what you get here is no better than your average saturday morning cartoon stuff.  It honestly looks to me like it was done by the same guys who did the X-Men, Spider Man, Iron Man, Hulk, & Fantastic 4 in the 90's & those shows weren't pretty, this movie may be a step(a small step) above those series.  Basically if you're looking for this to be Mark Millar's Ultimates you might be disapointed, the movie is still entertaining, I guess I was just hoping the film would be a little more faithful to the books original content.  We get to thank Lions Gate yet again for getting our hopes up and letting us down for another less than spectacular straight to video release. Okay I can see if this were a live action film, certain things would have to change obviously.  Comics just don't translate to film as well as we'd all hope they would.  However with this movie being animated, not to mention the fact that this book was practically written to be translated to film, there's really absolutely no excuse for altering the story here at all.  I'd have been okay if the changes were just cutting ""Naked Giant-Man"" or ""Hulk Horny"", these issue's I can see maybe changing if need be for the censor's.  They've altered the story so much; why not just call the movie The Avengers, and leave anything Ultimate out of the picture altogether?  It just really bothers me how badly Lions Gate has intentionally raped this project.  Hopefully another more competent studio will bring us a live action ""Ultimates"" in the future, until then Lions Gate can just about garuntee I'll be skipping the other 5 animated features including ""Ultimate Avengers 2""(How awful does that look?)",3,"Not A Straight Adaptation(""Josh"" is an idiot who obviously hasn't seen the movie)",1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,3228,"['Okay', 'maybe', 'who', 'just', 'looked', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'Ultimates', 'Vol', '1', 'will', 'fact', 'be', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'However', 'who', 'actually', 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'probably', 'gon', 'be', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'Read', 'review', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'other', 'reveiwers', 'obviosly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'just', 'read', 'articles', 'how', 'cool', 'supposed', 'be', 'have', 'hyped', 'so', 'high', 'think', ""'re"", 'gon', 'feel', 'crying', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actual', 'movie', 'Just', 'everyone', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Marvels', 'Ultimates', 'series', 'one', 'written', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'say', 'loosely', 'only', 'elemants', 'series', 'costumes', 'Most', 'everything', 'else', 'different', 'even', 'origins', 'team', 'different', 'book', 'crucial', 'parts', 'series', 'really', 'gave', 'originality', 'completly', 'left', 'out', 'such', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Giant', 'Man', 'Wasp', 'was', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'animated', 'feature', 'geared', 'mainly', 'towards', 'adults', 'ways', 'suppose', 'maybe', 'yes', 'maybe', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', 'left', 'tact', 'definately', 'still', 'geared', 'family', 'audiance', 'not', 'direct', 'straight', 'adaptation', 'book', ""'d"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'visual', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'same', 'context', 'book', 'other', 'thing', 'bummed', 'out', 'was', 'animation', 'heard', 'talk', 'how', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'was', 'using', 'special', 'state', 'art', 'animation', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'better', 'average', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'stuff', 'honestly', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'X-Men', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Hulk', 'Fantastic', '4', '90', 'shows', 'were', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'step', 'small', 'step', 'series', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'looking', 'be', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'Ultimates', 'might', 'be', 'disapointed', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'faithful', 'books', 'original', 'content', 'get', 'thank', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'yet', 'again', 'getting', 'hopes', 'up', 'letting', 'down', 'less', 'spectacular', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'certain', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'change', 'obviously', 'Comics', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'hope', 'would', 'However', 'movie', 'being', 'animated', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'book', 'was', 'practically', 'written', 'be', 'translated', 'film', 'really', 'absolutely', 'excuse', 'altering', 'story', 'here', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'okay', 'changes', 'were', 'just', 'cutting', 'Naked', 'Giant-Man', 'Hulk', 'Horny', 'issue', 'can', 'see', 'maybe', 'changing', 'need', 'be', 'censor', ""'ve"", 'altered', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'call', 'movie', 'Avengers', 'leave', 'anything', 'Ultimate', 'picture', 'altogether', 'just', 'really', 'bothers', 'how', 'badly', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'intentionally', 'raped', 'project', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'competent', 'studio', 'will', 'bring', 'live', 'action', 'Ultimates', 'future', 'then', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'can', 'just', 'garuntee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'skipping', 'other', '5', 'animated', 'features', 'including', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', '2', 'How', 'awful', 'look']",N/A

He assembles new recruits like Black Widow, Thor,  Giant-Man with his wife Wasp and Tony Stark/Iron Man into the team, however Dr. Bruce Banner with Betty Ross are working for a way to control the Hulk while a a deadly race of aliens are trying to take over Earth, the Avengers must deal with the intrduers from space including with the Hulk. Next in Ultimate Avengers 2, an African prince who is now known as Black-Panther has his kingdom under threat from the same alien forces in the first movie as he wants Fury and the Avengers to battle this menace.Both movies are based on Marvel's ""The Ultimates"" by Mark Millar which which is Ultimate version of ""The Avengers"", these 2 animated Marvel movies are very entertaining and action packed. The animation in both are quite good and the storytelling is good, the first movie develops the characters we all know but very different from the original Avengers comics many Marvel fans are familar with but remember, this is based on Ultimate Avengers. Part 2 is slightly better as it introduces the underrated Marvel hero BlackPanther and has some intense moments plus drama to it but both movies are worth watching.This Blu-Ray contains both movies on one disc, the picture is terrific and the sound is sharp.

957845,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B000CEVC9M,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[1, 1]","I really do not care what other reviewers here say, I personally think this is a great little DVD. It has my favorite character of all-time, Iron Man, and also making a rare appearance in an animated cartoon, is the god of thunder himself, Thor. The story is nothing extraordinary, but the plot moves along at a great pace and has plenty of action. Of course The Hulk steals the show at the end when he destroys everything in sight and no one can stop him.Captain America is discovered frozen in ice and is revived. Not because SHIELD misses him and the world needs a hero, but because the alien threat that was aiding the Nazis in World War II are back and they need Captain America's help. On a side note SHIELD also needs Captain America's DNA to create more super soldiers, because no one could figure out how to replicate him. Dr. David Banner is entrusted to lead the program, but unknown to everyone, he is really working on a way to control The Hulk, and he thinks Captain America's DNA is the key.General Fury recruits attempts to recruit a team to battle the aliens, but no one seems interested, not Iron Man, Thor, or Giant Man, but eventually they come together. However they blow their first assignment because no one wants to take orders from Captain America, instead of being a team, they all work on their own. This causes the aliens to steal all of SHIELDS data and get away.The final fight has the aliens attacking the city. The Avengers are fighting them off pretty good, but it is The Hulk that flattens them and their ships. The Hulk goes on a rampage and no one can stop him, not even Thor. Hulk throws Thor and then actually picks up his hammer to use against him, Iron Man is beaten until he looks like an old tin can, Captain America gets thrown all over the place, Giant man gets a broken knee and is choked. WASP goes into Hulks ear to distract him long enough for a sedetive to be administered, and it still takes Dr. Banner's pretty assistant to finally calm him down.So if you are looking for a good comic book type story with plenty of action, I highly recommend this. Great to watch with the kids.

Even if the animation wasn't the greatest, it is still the first animated Marvel project that doesn't treat its audience like children.Like many of you, I am a huge fan of the Ultimates series. I think it is the best thing to happen to comics this decade. But Ultimate Avengers was never supposed to be an adaptation of the comic books; it was supposed to be based on the comics. In that respect, the DVD succeeded. With the possible exception of Thor, the characters all remained faithful to the comic, and the better aspects of Mark Millar's storyline were present on the DVD as well. Naturally the animation was a letdown, but it would have taken a huge budget to even attempt to replicate what Bryan Hitch accomplished with his Ultimates artwork.Look at what you're getting with Ultimate Avengers - a nearly feature-length animated feature with a great story, dynamic characters that have real personalities and aren't just caricatures (except for Thor), and an approach that doesn't assume the audience is full of A - children, or B - idiots. Plus, that massive fight at the end kicked all sorts of a**!

957855,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CEVC9M,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","""Ultimate Avengers"" is an interesting combination of the new and improved 21st century version of the Avengers written by Mark Millar and penciled by Bryan Hitch, and a revitalization of the 1980s style of animation.  Now, ""The Avengers"" was the one Golden Age Marvel comic book that never really impressed me growing up.  I liked the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, so it was not a question of not liking superhero groups.  But the roster of the Avengers went from one extreme to the other.  They started out power heavy with Thor, Iron Man and the Hulk, and then went ultra light with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch.  Either way there was always a problem with coming up with super villains for the Avengers to fight, and only the Vision really captured my interest.Then Millar and Hitch came up ""The Ultimates,"" the Avengers counterpart for the Ultimate series Marvel came up with the rework its superheroes for the 21st century.  On balance, I like the Ultimates more than the Avengers, even though the way they play off of the ""real"" Marvel Universe does not always work (e.g., Hank Pym having Hawkeye's personality, Thor's divine delusion).  ""Ultimate Avengers: The Movie,"" is a direct-to-video effort that covers the same group as the first Ultimate's storyline, ""Super-Human,"" which had to do with the formation of the group and their first collective effort to bring down the Hulk.  The idea is that Bruce Banner's days as the Hulk are behind him and he is in charge of the government's effort to update the super-solider formula that created Captain America way back when. In charge of the proceedings is General Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.The story begins with the final mission of Captain America during World War II, but after that point all of the superheroes who make up the Ultimates already recognized as superheroes, albeit with one large exception. The Captain America thread is the best of the bunch, with Steve Rogers getting caught up on his life 57-years later and free from that annoying guilt over the death of Bucky Barnes, but the movie moves so quickly (it is only 70 minutes long) that there is no time to give depth to Rogers or any of the other characters.  The key difference from the comic books is that in addition to having to deal with the Hulk, when he finally shows up, the Ultimate Avengers have to contend with aliens.  These aliens were around at the end of World War II and have apparently waited for Earth to develop advanced weapons and superheroes before launching their attack.  But the advantage with aliens is that there are a whole bunch of them, they do not spout corny super villain dialogue, and the Ultimate Avengers can wale on them big time.If they had added another 20 or even 10 minutes to this ""movie"" and expanded the characterizations beyond the bare bones, the retro-animation style would certainly be more acceptable and perhaps almost endearing.  But that complaint comes from my adult perspective and clearly Marvel is aiming this at a much younger audience.  That makes it more of a recruitment effort as well as a first foray in the direct to video market.  But that is not to say the older audience is ignored.  You can turn on the Avengers Trivia Track, so you can access trivia about the characters and the world of the Avengers which watching the film.  This covers not only information about the characters, but also the World War II, the production company, and what scenes are lifted from the comic book.  ""Avengers Assemble"" looks at the history of the group from September 1963 when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Avengers, to the creation of the Ultimates by Millar.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[3, 4]","Ultimate Avengers: The Movie is an engrossing animated feature that brings to life the Marvel magazine of the same name.  However, creative changes have been made, and these may annoy some hardcore fans of the Avengers characters.  Besides changes of race to Nick Fury and Janet Pym (Wasp), I can't say another biggie.Some reviewers complained about a) not enough character development and b) poor animation.  Both these claims are bogus, as the animation is excellent in both line drawing, color, and depth.  Character development is enhanced if you turn on the English subtitles.  Instead of dialouge, there are trivia balloons that pop up periodically with intriguing information about the History of the Avengers, specific changes made for the animated feature, and character information.  This is especially useful for someone unfamiliar with the series.There is a lot of violence and sexuality.  The two female superheroes have huge perky breasts, and one scene involves blatant seduction.  In battle scenes, soldiers die.  An astronaut desperately screams she is ""burning up"" as aliens attack a space station.  In some of the most violent cartoon scenes I have ever seen, the Hulk goes bananas on his teammates, going for blows to the head, the knee, the throat.  This is not kid stuff.  Neither is the poignant story of the return of Captain America to a modern world, one in which he meets his former fiancee who is now elderly.  Intelligent adults with a grasp of WWII will appreciate this storyline.The voice acting is terrific.  Extras include dubbing in Spanish (although there are no English dialouge subtitles), a ""which Avenger are you?"" quiz, and an interview with longtime Marvel Avengers illustrator George Perez and current writers.My only complaint is that the aliens were not developed well.

957863,A2FS6OGMZMALTD,B000CEVC9M,Mojo Jojo,"[3, 5]","Let's get a couple things out of the way.  ONE:  Marvel has never been a match for DC when it comes to animation.  TWO:  I don't really care much for this new age of bickering heroes.  THREE:  This is an adaption of an adaption, meaning its resemblance to the classic comic material is fleeting at best.  AND FOUR:  This is actually a pretty good film.Oh, it has its flaws.  The biggest is the animation, which while really fairly good is just lacking in style and finesse.  The story is good, too, and the characters are well-defined.  There's some nifty action as well, and the dialogue straddles that fine line between family friendly and adult.BONUS POINTS:  There's a couple of things that I really liked about this film.  For one, people actually die.  When you've got an evil alien invasion, it just seems realistic.  For another, the dialogue is damn clever in places.  And the final battle between the Hulk and the rest of the team is pretty cool.NEGATIVES:  Like I said, I get tired of bickering heroes.  If you take away much of that, the film would be even shorter.  And the ending seems a little sudden.  The alien invasion never seems to be well-organized, and is destroyed a little too easily.  Also, I just didn't care for Thor's voice in this.  It seemed to match his old, traditional persona.  He should've sounded more like a hippie.OVERALL:  This is worth renting.  I probably wouldn't recommend buying it.  But at least it's a step in the right direction for Marvel.  Who knows?

I love the Batman animated straight to DVD movies, and recently The Batman vs. Dracula animated film.  When I heard about Ultimate Avengers I was excited to see Marvel coming into the light of great animated films.  I was wrong.  What a disapointment this movie is.  Although a good film for any comic book fan, but not great.  Marvel animation needs work.  The animated shows they put out in the 90's were good.  Spider-Man: the new animated series (MTV) was fantastic.  What went wrong?  If Marvel is trying to compete with DC in the animation genre then they have A LOT of work ahead.Here's what I thought worked:  It's the Avengers.  I'm a Avenger fan so the time for an Avenger movie (even if it's animated) is over due.  great!Here's what I thought didn't work:  Everything else.  The quality of the animation is just not good.  Nowhere near the animated quality of Teen Titans, Justice League Unlimited, and Spider-Man: New Animated Series.  Even The Batman animation is better and I don't like the way they character design.  Marvel should of picked the classic Avengers line up.  Where was Thor in his red cape and winged helmet. Where was She-Hulk, Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Knight?  The team that made up THE AVENGERS.  I like the Ultimate Avengers, but they shouldn't of picked that version of the team for the start of their animated line up.  Ultimate Avengers is dark and mature.  This film is light and family based.  Much like the original team.What also didn't work is the voices they picked.  They sounded generic and dry.  I thought none of the voices matched the characters.  Thor's accents was just terrible.where was the plot?  It didn't have one.  I understand it was character development and introduction to the team, but where was the plot?  There was this alien invasion coming, so Nick Fury had to gather the earth's mightiest heros to stop them.  This battle lasted all of about 1 chapter.  The climax of the film came when the Avengers battled the Hulk.Some of the fight scenes with the Hulk were good.  I think Justice League Unlimited and Teen Titans have better fight scenes.  Marvel needs to watch those and take some notes.I would recommend renting before buying.  $14 in stores is a waste of money.  if you can find the film for $10 or less, buy it.  I'm going to buy when it drops in price so I can add it to my Comic/Superhero library.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[9, 13]","I went into Ultimate Avengers with low expectations after all the mixed reviews I'd heard, but thankfully this little animated flick is surprisingly good.  Based on Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's superb Ultimates comic series (which is pretty much a modern update of the classic Avengers lineup, hence the title of the DVD), Ultimate Avengers begins with the discovery of legendary WWII hero Captain America, who has been frozen in ice for over 60 years.  When he's thawed out, he is teamed with Nick Fury, Iron Man, the Wasp, Giant Man, Black Widow, and eventually Thor, to combat the same shape shifting aliens that Cap fought back in the war.  The story and dialogue aren't what you'd expect from Warner Bros. superb DC animated titles, but the animation is crisp and clean, and no other cartoon has blended traditional animation with CGI better to date.  The story stays surprisingly close to Millar's comic, even though the volitale relationship between Giant Man and Wasp is downplayed here, but it's the use of Bruce Banner/Hulk where Ultimate Avengers really shines.  All in all, if you're a fan, new or old, check this out, and while you're at it, check out the recently released sequel as well, which is even better.",4,Surprisingly good,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1225,"['went', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'low', 'expectations', 'mixed', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'heard', 'thankfully', 'little', 'animated', 'flick', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Based', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'Bryan', 'Hitch', 'superb', 'comic', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'modern', 'update', 'classic', 'Avengers', 'lineup', 'hence', 'title', 'DVD', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'discovery', 'legendary', 'WWII', 'hero', 'Captain', 'America', 'who', 'been', 'frozen', 'ice', '60', 'years', 'When', 'thawed', 'out', 'teamed', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Wasp', 'Giant', 'Man', 'Black', 'Widow', 'eventually', 'Thor', 'combat', 'same', 'shape', 'shifting', 'aliens', 'Cap', 'fought', 'back', 'war', 'story', 'dialogue', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'superb', 'DC', 'animated', 'titles', 'animation', 'crisp', 'clean', 'other', 'cartoon', 'blended', 'traditional', 'animation', 'CGI', 'better', 'date', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'close', 'Millar', 'comic', 'even', 'volitale', 'relationship', 'Giant', 'Man', 'Wasp', 'downplayed', 'here', 'use', 'Bruce', 'Banner/Hulk', 'where', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'really', ""'re"", 'fan', 'new', 'old', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'check', 'out', 'recently', 'released', 'sequel', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'better']",N/A

The story starts off very well with a brief history of Captain America then around 3/4 of the way through, I lost interest.  I still enjoyed the movie but I guess I was expecting more.I guess my main disappointment was with the characters.  I liked Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor.  Black Widow was okay but I didn't really see how she fit in with a group of ""super"" heroes.  I found the characters of Bruce Banner and Hank Pym to be extremely annoying with all their whining.  The Wasp was also a questionable character.  I don't have any really problem with her but neither did I really like her.  I wish they had chosen another Avengers line-up to do a movie about.  I'd rather have seen Ms. Marvel, Spider-Woman, or the Scarlet Witch.The animation and voice actors were good.  The WWII battle scenes and the final fight scene are really well done.  The storyline is interesting but the ending seemed a little rushed.  One minute the team is in a sort of training phase and everyone is bickering then, all of a sudden, its the final fight sequence.  My favorite parts are those featuring Thor.  The dramatic opera music that plays when he is in action is just perfect and he seems to be the funniest/most entertaining of all the heroes.  Unfortunately, he only appears for a few minutes, altogether, and I'd really love to see more about him.As for special features, there is a Trivia Track that you can play during the movie.  Instead of having an audio commentary, there are bubbles that pop up containing facts about The Avengers comic books, the characters, or the making of the movie.  For me, they made the movie a little more enjoyable.  There is also a featurette, called ""Avengers Assemble,"" which really has nothing to do with the movie.  It features comic book artists and writers discussing The Avengers comic books.  It's somewhat interesting but I suspect that long-time Avengers fans will appreciate it more than the average viewer.""The Ultimate Voice Talent Search"" features videos of Avengers fans submitting auditions for the film.  Some are a bit strange but most are funny.  There is a brief preview for the sequel, Ultimate Avengers II, which has commentary by the film's creators.  There is also a DVD-Rom game, ""What Avenger Are You?"" which asks you a series of questions.  Based on your answers, it tells you which Avenger you most resemble.  I took the test 3 times, giving slightly different answers and came up with Mantis, Mockingbird, and Starfox.Overall, it's a decent production but I'm hoping that future releases will be better.",3,Animated Avengers,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2685,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'animated', 'superhero', 'shows', 'jumped', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'story', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'brief', 'history', 'Captain', 'America', 'then', '3/4', 'way', 'lost', 'interest', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'more.I', 'guess', 'main', 'disappointment', 'was', 'characters', 'liked', 'Captain', 'America', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'Black', 'Widow', 'was', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'how', 'fit', 'group', 'super', 'heroes', 'found', 'characters', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hank', 'Pym', 'be', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'whining', 'Wasp', 'was', 'also', 'questionable', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'really', 'problem', 'did', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'chosen', 'Avengers', 'line-up', 'do', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Ms.', 'Marvel', 'Spider-Woman', 'Scarlet', 'Witch.The', 'animation', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'WWII', 'battle', 'scenes', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'ending', 'seemed', 'little', 'rushed', 'One', 'minute', 'team', 'sort', 'training', 'phase', 'everyone', 'bickering', 'then', 'sudden', 'final', 'fight', 'sequence', 'favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'featuring', 'Thor', 'dramatic', 'opera', 'music', 'when', 'action', 'just', 'perfect', 'be', 'funniest/most', 'entertaining', 'heroes', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'altogether', ""'d"", 'really', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'him.As', 'special', 'features', 'Trivia', 'Track', 'can', 'play', 'movie', 'Instead', 'having', 'audio', 'commentary', 'are', 'bubbles', 'pop', 'up', 'containing', 'facts', 'Avengers', 'comic', 'books', 'characters', 'making', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'featurette', 'called', 'Avengers', 'Assemble', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'artists', 'writers', 'discussing', 'Avengers', 'comic', 'books', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'suspect', 'long-time', 'Avengers', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'average', 'viewer', 'Ultimate', 'Voice', 'Talent', 'Search', 'videos', 'Avengers', 'fans', 'submitting', 'auditions', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'strange', 'most', 'are', 'funny', 'brief', 'preview', 'sequel', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'II', 'commentary', 'film', 'creators', 'also', 'DVD-Rom', 'game', 'What', 'Avenger', 'Are', 'series', 'questions', 'Based', 'answers', 'Avenger', 'most', 'resemble', 'took', 'test', '3', 'times', 'giving', 'slightly', 'different', 'answers', 'came', 'up', 'Mantis', 'Mockingbird', 'Starfox.Overall', 'decent', 'production', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'future', 'releases', 'will', 'be', 'better']",N/A

Howard ""seishin""","[12, 18]","Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.Step up to the plate, Marvel.

957885,AX9ZYSNJKJJK6,B000CEVC9M,R. Wolfe,"[7, 8]","I don't know what some of these people are whining about.  This is a great product with excellent animation and a compelling story.  I suspect this flick will suffer review-wise from fanboys with an imaginary stake in the final product who are groaning because they would have changed some aspect or another if--magically--Marvel had only let THEM do the movie instead of Avi Arad and friends, who have consistently brought us some truly great superhero material over the past several years.It's an animated superhero flick.  It harkens back stylistically to the Spiderman the Animated Series, though it's more crisp and the colors are more vibrant.  It's not Japanese anime art, though, I'll give you that.  It's American cel animation and it looks on par with anything impressive that's come out of that market.  It's about 70 minutes long, but it is satisfying and doesn't leave you feeling like you got short-changed.  There is a lot going on and quite a few characters to bring together--all while ramping up the conflict in this story.  They do a good job multitasking with these challenges so the film doesn't suffer from boring beginning syndrome.  The fight choreography is exciting and the sparing use  of integrateed CGI in the 2D cel animation that dominates fits right in.I haven't read comic books in many years, so I'm sure that this movie creates something of a new continuity in some ways (I know Nick Fury of SHIELD was not a black man, for one thing--one thing which, while possibly an unnecessary change obviously meant to inject some diversity, really didn't bother me).  So if you're all about the Ultimates comic this is supposedly based on, I'm sure you'll find some offense.  However, it's all good with Marvel, just like every other continuity change that has riddled all comic book companies forever always were and will be.  They're par for the course, and nothing here is glaring or in the face of the spirit of the heroes focused on.Before seeing the movie, I was not psyched about the particular heroes focused on besides Cap and Iron Man, actually. Giant Man has never really captured my imagination.  Even so, he was really great, and I'm now a fan.  Same goes for the Wasp.  Hulk was more interesting the way they did it than he could have been; he wasn't all ""Hulk smash"" and conveniently Banner gets mad at the right place at the right time.  There was a running thread there that worked well, and they even did it without stepping all over Hulk's usual deal (because Hulk smash is still awesome . . .).  Banner got a slightly different treatment, but it worked for me in the end.There's a sequel in the works, and not too far off in the future it will be in stores.  This movie does not need a sequel to feel complete, and the sequel supposedly will fly on it's own even if you haven't seen this flick first.Look, for the like 12 or 14 bucks this thing's gonna cost you, it's a great buy.  If it was even 25 bucks or so, I might say wait and see if you can rent it or see a friend's copy before you invest.  But this thing comes with extras, and it's a great ride for a cheap price.  All gravy.  The feature with the long time writers and artists was great.  The pop-up video style factiods you can turn on are nice, though absolutely riddled with typos and spelling errors.  (It's almost embarassing, really.)I am a big fan of the DC animated stuff like the box sets of Batman the Animated Series, Superman's series, and I'm all over Justice League when it comes out. I don't seem to be too excited by the new The Batman series, but I'm probably going to pick up Batman Beyond when it hits.  If you're like me, you love this stuff.  There was not much Marvel going on DVD-wise in this genre up until now, but they hope to change that apparently, and if this is how they started things off, I can't wait to see how awesome a whole movie on Iron Man is going to be.

957888,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000CEVC9M,Sean Pasek,"[6, 8]","I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a good, fun, and entertaining movie that sticks fairly closely with the characters from the comics.The animation is high quality, in my opinion.  The people look like people.  While I also greatly enjoy the Justice League, I find that their animation quality isn't as good as here in the Avengers.  Batman and Superman seem to have concrete blocks for faces.  In the Avengers, everyone looks distinct and realistic.The Avengers are much like DC's Justice League; an assembly of heroes to fight against global problems.  And while overall, the Avengers may not be quite as powerful as the Justice League, they are formidable in their own right.This first film deals with the origin of the Avengers.  It brings in heroes such as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, Hulk, and still others in Nick Fury (who puts the team together) and Black Widow.  I collected comics for nearly 15 years, and the Avengers was always one of my favorite, mostly because my favorite character was in it: Iron Man.The film is a parallel to the comic.  Some reviewers have stated that there isn't much character development.  This is true.  However, this is a movie and not an episodic series like the Justice League.  Also, in the comic, you're expected to know these characters already from their individual books.  And for good or bad, this film seems to expect that as well.  And in the limited 70 or so minutes, there just isn't much time for character development.  Most people should already be familiar with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor.  The ones that people may be less familiar with are Giant Man and Wasp.The Avengers are asked to defend against an extraterrestrial invasion that began back during World War II.  After 60 years, these aliens have resurfaced by knocking out one of America's satellites/detecting systems.The team is shakey the first time out.  They don't listen to Captain America.You might think that the climax is a battle between ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" and these Aliens.  But it's not.  It is actually between the Avengers and the Hulk.  Bruce Banner injects himself with Captain America's Super-Soldier Serum with the hopes of controling the rage of the Hulk.  It back-fires, and a huge all-out fight ensues.  You get an idea of just how powerful the Hulk is (arguably the comic industry's strongest character).They make Thor a little over-the-top cheesy, but it is a small glitch that is easliy overlooked as he's barely in this film.

However, with both of those teams getting their own live action movies, and loving super hero animation, I couldn't resist checking this out.The Avengers team is a little different than I remembered.  My first reaction was, where's Ant-Man, Hawkeye, The Vision?  But I suppose this is Ultimate Avengers and this particular team has always had a rotating roster.The animation was great, always pleasing to the eye, and very anime style.  The voice acting was really solid too and they were able to sneak a little personality into the characters amongst the action.  Speaking of the action, it was pretty solid.  Without giving away too much, the best part being when the Hulk goes on a rage induced rampage.  I really enjoyed the new spin on Captain America's history as well.  Keeping his origin the way it was, but enabling him to move fluidly into the modern age.The primary villain however are my least favorite aspect of the movie.  I will say this, the primary plot of this movie is seeing how the Avengers team assembled.  But in any good super hero storyline, your villain has to be just as interesting as your heroes, and that's not the case here.  The nemesis is this case being aliens, and they're just not interesting.  Yeah, they may look cool, but how many times can you do a story about alien invasion before it starts to feel stale?Overall, a lot of good aspects to it, but I can only hope that now that the team is formed, the sequel has a lot more in store for us.",3,Good superhero action,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1601,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'superheroes', 'stuck', 'more', 'X-men', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'as', 'far', 'super', 'teams', 'went', 'However', 'teams', 'getting', 'own', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'loving', 'super', 'hero', 'animation', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'checking', 'out.The', 'Avengers', 'team', 'little', 'different', 'remembered', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'where', 'Ant-Man', 'Hawkeye', 'Vision', 'suppose', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'particular', 'team', 'always', 'had', 'rotating', 'roster.The', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'always', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'very', 'anime', 'style', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'solid', 'too', 'were', 'able', 'sneak', 'little', 'personality', 'characters', 'amongst', 'action', 'Speaking', 'action', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'best', 'part', 'being', 'when', 'Hulk', 'rage', 'induced', 'rampage', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'new', 'spin', 'Captain', 'America', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'Keeping', 'origin', 'way', 'was', 'enabling', 'move', 'fluidly', 'modern', 'age.The', 'primary', 'villain', 'however', 'are', 'least', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'primary', 'plot', 'movie', 'seeing', 'how', 'Avengers', 'team', 'assembled', 'good', 'super', 'hero', 'storyline', 'villain', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'heroes', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'nemesis', 'case', 'being', 'aliens', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'Yeah', 'may', 'look', 'cool', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'do', 'story', 'alien', 'invasion', 'feel', 'stale', 'Overall', 'lot', 'good', 'aspects', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'now', 'team', 'formed', 'sequel', 'lot', 'more', 'store']",N/A

Produced by Ari Avad and Stan Lee.When a group of shape shifting aliens NOT called the Skrulls(Why??? WHY???) who were the secret force behind Nazi Germany during the Second War reappear 60 years later, Gen Nick Fury---now inexplicably a Negro and in charge of an organization called SHIELD but whose initials do NOT stand for Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law Enforcement Division(Why? WHY??? WHY??) attempts to revive the super soldier program that created the legendary hero Captain America by finding the frozen body of the hero and defrosting him.........and unexpectedly reviving him and commissioning a certain scientist named Bruce Banner to recreate the formula.However when the aliens not called the Skrulls go on the offensive, Fury is ordered to activate the Avengers protocol which is to form a team of super heroes to combat the threat. Said heroes...Iron Man, the Black Widow, Giant Man, Thor and the Wasp do not get along especially well nor do they appreciate being put under the command of the 60 year old out of date Captain America.And then Bruce Banner becomes angry and afraid.................Pretty much...save for a detail or two...a partial dry run for the proposed live action CAPTAIN AMERICA and AVENGERS films and can serve very well as a sequel to the live action 2008 Iron Man and Hulk films. And save for the continual...and one believes simply peevish tendency to make stupid changes for the sake of irritating people, not a terribly bad animated film. Along with the above described silly changes, Thor is presented as possibly only thinking that he is the norse god of thunder and all of his powers being in his hammer rather than in his person. During his fight with the Hulk, he is portrayed as not having anywhere near the monster's physical strength and at one point, the Hulk picks up Thor's hammer and knocks him out with it. Both big whoppers in the Thor adaptation sweep stakes. Thor is also a member of Greenpeace and spends his time trying to save the whales. Hank--Giant Man--Pym comes across as a childish infantile jerk. The alien plot line is underwriiten.....and was presumably elaborated in the sequel ULTIMATE AVENGERS 2 which I have not seen. Also the whole idea of the Avengers being controlled by the United States Govt is a perversion of the book which had major story lines concerning how the Avengers was an independent organization and resisted strongly any attempts of Govt control. The film's raisin de tant(spelling) is basically Steve Rogers coping with being a man out of time, the team learning to come together and the battle royal with the Hulk. The alien subplot should have been removed altogether and such lower tier heavies as the Lava Men or the Space Phantom used to provide the plot justifications.On the other hand, the film nails Captain America mostly as well as the Hulk, Iron Man, the Wasp and the Black Widow. SHIELD does have a helicarrier and the animation is generally excellent. The women---the Wasp and the Black Widow---are the hottest animated chicks I have ever seen and move the film very close to the adult shelf just by walking across the screen. YOWSA!!! Can we have an animated film where the Wasp and the Black Widow discover they are lesbians and take long hot soapy showers together.......ah.........never mind.Anyway.So yes. Annoyances aplenty.

I loved this series because of its humanity and heroicness. That being said, I am going to review this dvd first, as a fan and then as an audience.AS A FAN: The story is the summary of the ULTIMATES vol. 1, #'S 1-12. The movie starts with CAPTAIN AMERICA in combat with the nazis in WW2. Steve Rogers discovers that the Nazis are backed by a group of aliens who plan to destroy humanity. This threat is even abundant in the 20th century that is why the U.S. has developed a super-soldier program headed by Bruce Banner(HULK).Banner has his own agenda and is using the funds to find a way to control the Hulk. In the comic, he uses the Hulk to combat the ULTIMATES so the team can justify its existence. However, as in the comic, they did unleash the brute to combat the aliens.ULTIMATES # 6- nominated for WIZARD'S GREATEST COMIC MOMENT:CAPTAIN AMERICA TAKES DOWN THE HULK. If you will compare the THE ULTIMATES COMIC, THE MOVIE would be ROTTEN. The comic is dark with all their realistic and probable conspiracies that relate to politics. The dvd is a lighter tone of the Ultimates.Characterization was poor. Hank Pym brash and overconfident in the film?! What's up with that?! Hulk able to lift the enchanted Hammer of Thor? Granted that the Ultimates version of Thor is weaker, but this is stupid!! Recently, in ULTIMATES 2 # 6 it wasrevealed that THOR is the actual Norse God of Thunder. All in all I think the studios must be preparing to make another Hulk movie to allow this. As a fan, I am very disappointed.As an Audience: The film was well animated. It tried to take the time for character development. The film is kid-friendly which makes the action good but not violent and the script is a bit cheesy at times because they producers know kids will be watching it. I only wish they made it in the same style as JUSTICE LEAGUE and BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM.In spite of all its inaccuracies, the movie was ok. If you are a comic book veteran, you will be disappointed. Just take as it is, A KID FRIENDLY family movie. The effort I spent to buy it wasn't worth it since I had to go to 3 stores to find it.
