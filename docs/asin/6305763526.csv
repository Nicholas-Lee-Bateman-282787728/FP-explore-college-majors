All three stories are excellent, but I especially liked the last one involving a bizarre biker ritual to revive their dead protector played silently by J.J. North.  Someone who looks as good as J.J. does not have to speak!  The real star is Debbie Rochon.  Her character drips violence and the ending will make you say wow.  This film was originally shot in 1997.  Troma was smart to pick it up.  This pic went over big at the annual Chiller Theatre convention in NJ. Joe Bob Briggs loved it, and it will pave the way for Debbie Rochon to climb to the top of the scream queen list.",4,Three times the scares,974160000,"11 14, 2000",2000,715,"['film', 'trilogy', 'tales', 'related', 'deathrow', 'inmate', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'executioner', 'Gunnar', 'Hansen', 'original', 'LeatherFace', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'liked', 'last', 'one', 'involving', 'bizarre', 'biker', 'ritual', 'revive', 'dead', 'protector', 'played', 'silently', 'J.J.', 'North', 'Someone', 'who', 'as', 'good', 'J.J.', 'not', 'have', 'speak', 'real', 'star', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'character', 'drips', 'violence', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'say', 'wow', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', '1997', 'Troma', 'was', 'smart', 'pick', 'up', 'pic', 'went', 'big', 'annual', 'Chiller', 'Theatre', 'convention', 'NJ', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'Briggs', 'loved', 'will', 'pave', 'way', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'climb', 'top', 'scream', 'queen', 'list']",N/A

Just to gaze upon the beauty of Tara (Debbie Rochon) is worth {it}.So the deal is this - Tara is on deathrow awaitng execution. She has penned 3 horror stories that she claims spirits in the prison had told her. She then tells the executioner each of these tales of terror. All three stories are pretty good and funny if you have a slightly twisted sense of humor as I do.I had never heard of Debbie Rochon before but she certainly cast a spell on me.  She seems to be a good actress and is hot as the Texas sun. Her exchange with the executioner between stories 1 and 2 was classic.The first story is pretty tame but the second has lots of foul language and the third has foul language and some nudity.Debbie Rochon does NOT show skin but I've got a great imagination.Bottom line is if you like horror movies this should be in your collection. You will watch it more than once.,4,Hellblock 13 delivers.............,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,925,"['only', '10', 'dollars', 'movie', 'must', 'buy', 'Just', 'gaze', 'beauty', 'Tara', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'worth', 'deal', 'Tara', 'deathrow', 'awaitng', 'execution', 'penned', '3', 'horror', 'stories', 'spirits', 'prison', 'had', 'told', 'then', 'executioner', 'tales', 'terror', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'funny', 'have', 'slightly', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'do.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'certainly', 'cast', 'spell', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'hot', 'Texas', 'sun', 'exchange', 'executioner', 'stories', '1', '2', 'was', 'classic.The', 'first', 'story', 'pretty', 'tame', 'second', 'lots', 'foul', 'language', 'third', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity.Debbie', 'Rochon', 'NOT', 'show', 'skin', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'imagination.Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",N/A
476994,A30T36G88X4RLG,6305763526,"CaptHowdy ""Tell us about yourself!""","[12, 12]","This anthology of stories feels like a collection of three Tales From The Crypt episodes.The first story is a 'missing children' one.  It revolves around the mother of the lost children and follows her interviews with the  police and the time she spends with her boyfriend.  After approximately two  minutes into the story you pretty well know what the ending will be.  It  would have been nice if the ending wasn't so blantantly obvious.  Pretty  descent makeup effects though.The second story is about a young married  couple (stereotypical southern trailer trash).  Because of how the  characters are played you end up laughing at some of their 'southern'  personalities.  This one is the best of the trilogy.  Heidi Mae is an  abused housewife.  I found myself cringing watching her husband beat the  hell out of her.  Man, do you ever sympathise with her character FAST.  This one had better twists and turns in the story and just when you are  thinking 'ah, this ending is as easy to guess as the last one' it smacks  you in the face with something different.The last story follows a biker  gang on it's way to Mexico on a drug run.  A superstitious bunch, they stop  to pay their respects (in their 'special' way) to a former biker chick  (J.J. North) who apparently looks after them from beyond the grave.  This  one had a larger cast than the others and they are perfect in their roles.  The ending is pretty predictable though, but not as easily as the first  story.  It would have been nice to hear J.J. speak or something, perhaps a  bigger role, because she looked hot!All three of these stories are  written by Tara (Debbie Rochon)while on death row.  She reads these stories  to her prison guard/executioner (Gunnar Hansen) while waiting to get taken  away to die.  They are basically the 'Cryptkeepers' of this anthology and  help it flow from one story to the next.  Debbie plays a perfect  psychopath.  She gets some great lines like 'They remember Poe, Lovecraft,  and they'll remember Tara!'  Her giggling at the end of the film will spook  me for a long time.  Gunnar's role was limited, but his line are pretty  cool.  His name-calling and put downs to Debbie were pretty funny (in sick  sort of way I suppose).The DVD contains a few trailers for Troma films.  Other than that, there isn't anything else.Overall a good anthology  for Tales From The Crypt fan types who like indie films.  Debbie Rochon  fans will like this too.",4,"Good Anthology, Two Out Of The Three Stories Were Cool.",958348800,"05 15, 2000",2000,2449,"['anthology', 'stories', 'feels', 'collection', 'three', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'episodes.The', 'first', 'story', ""'missing"", 'children', 'one', 'mother', 'lost', 'children', 'interviews', 'police', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'approximately', 'two', 'minutes', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'blantantly', 'obvious', 'Pretty', 'descent', 'makeup', 'effects', 'though.The', 'second', 'story', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'stereotypical', 'southern', 'trailer', 'trash', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', ""'southern"", 'personalities', 'one', 'best', 'trilogy', 'Heidi', 'Mae', 'abused', 'housewife', 'found', 'cringing', 'watching', 'husband', 'beat', 'hell', 'Man', 'do', 'ever', 'sympathise', 'character', 'FAST', 'one', 'had', 'better', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'thinking', ""'ah"", 'ending', 'easy', 'guess', 'last', 'one', 'face', 'something', 'different.The', 'last', 'story', 'biker', 'gang', 'way', 'Mexico', 'drug', 'run', 'superstitious', 'bunch', 'stop', 'pay', 'respects', ""'special"", 'way', 'former', 'biker', 'chick', 'J.J.', 'North', 'who', 'apparently', 'grave', 'one', 'had', 'larger', 'cast', 'others', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'ending', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'not', 'as', 'easily', 'first', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'J.J.', 'speak', 'something', 'perhaps', 'bigger', 'role', 'looked', 'hot', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'written', 'Tara', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'death', 'row', 'stories', 'prison', 'guard/executioner', 'Gunnar', 'Hansen', 'waiting', 'get', 'taken', 'away', 'die', 'are', 'basically', ""'Cryptkeepers"", 'anthology', 'help', 'flow', 'one', 'story', 'next', 'Debbie', 'perfect', 'psychopath', 'great', 'lines', ""'They"", 'remember', 'Poe', 'Lovecraft', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'Tara', 'giggling', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'spook', 'long', 'time', 'Gunnar', 'role', 'was', 'limited', 'line', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'name-calling', 'put', 'downs', 'Debbie', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sick', 'sort', 'way', 'suppose', '.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'trailers', 'Troma', 'films', 'Other', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else.Overall', 'good', 'anthology', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'fan', 'types', 'who', 'like', 'indie', 'films', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'too']",N/A

The movie is mainly about a women sentence to die and she tells of three stories to the jailer before she is about to be electricuted. The three sub-stories are weak and have very little plot just like the entire movie. There is about 15 seconds of topless nudity. Though the female killer gets the last laugh.

Going mostly from Memory, Debbie Rochon plays a Death Row inmate whoose horrific tales have a profound effect on her soon to be executioner ( Gunnar Hansen) & exacts a measure of revenge on him. Troma known for specifically throwing everything in but the kitchen sink in terms of extras, this time throws in virtually nothing & believe me this movie needed as much help as it could get. Aside from the brief, boring & under-achieving Radiation March & a handful of Troma Trailers thats pretty much it. Is it scary? not really, is it funny? not really, is it sexy? not really. Don't get me wrong though. Debbie Rochon is a superb actress & she has/had a reputation for being a method actress who could ply her skills to any script. She did a good job given the script. Yet it limited her ( in my opinion). Sitting in a cell,marked up & bloodied, sometimes visable other times withdrawn in terms of full physical appearance doesn't work for me especially since that's the formula for the whole film. It was nice to see JJ North in her tale but I can't go beyond that. This movie was blip free on my entertainment radar. Troma didn't deliver the goods this time.
