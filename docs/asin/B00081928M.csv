898042,A29PRUAD8RK2WX,B00081928M,Buffalohump,"[4, 6]","This is a tricky one. I gave it four stars, but I need to qualify that. On the one hand, its hard to fault the material found here. Each one of these songs is a gem. If you're a Lucinda fan (and I'm a big one) you'll already be in love with this material. So the song selection is top notch and gets five stars. However, as a live show, I sincerely hope this is not a typical Lucinda Williams performance. She only really gets into the spirit of the thing three quarters of the way through, forgets to introduce the band, says nothing to the audience throughout (apart from the above-mentioned band intro) and generally doesn't look hugely moved by the whole experience. So only three stars there. I just wish the record companies would wake up to the fact that the concert DVD now offers a far more comprehensive portrait of the artist than just a plain old CD. So if you release a live album - as Lucinda just has - then for crying out loud, RELEASE IT ON DVD as well. How hard can it be to get a decent recording of a live show in this age of digital wizardry? We want the genuine Lucinda live experience. Despite the quality of the material here and the high technical standard, this is far too sterile a show for someone of Lucinda's calibre.

Lucinda is outstanding, most of the songs she performs were written by her. She is an wonderful performer also. The band is excellent and very guitar oriented.Musicians include: Lucinda on vocals, and guitar; Kenny Vaughan who is phenomenal on the electric guitar; John Jackson on guitar; Richard ""hombre"" Price on bass guitar; Randy Leago on Hammond b3 organ and accordian; Fran Breen on the drums; and Jim Lauderdale on acoustic guitar.The entire concert is phenomenally great, but some highlights I liked include: ""Car Wheels on a gravel road""; ""Lake Charles"" (This is Lucinda's home town); ""Jackson"" -this is her song, not the Johnny Cash song; ""Changed the Locks"" - this is a classic!; ""Passinate Kisses""; and a very awesome extended performance of ""Joy"". The performance of ""Joy"" is just outstanding, its difficult to describe just how good it is.This is a 5 star concert dvd, well worth having. Its a classic that will stand the test of time.

898044,A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00081928M,hyperbolium,"[31, 31]","Williams' folk-country cult status expanded into the mainstream with Patty Loveless' 1990 cover of ""The Night's Too Long,"" and her back catalog became highly sought after when Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1993 cover of ""Passionate Kisses"" hit the top five, and won the songwriter a Grammy. But it was another five years before Williams finished and issued her followup, ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,"" and it's at the point of that 1998 re-emergence that she made this appearance, her third, on Austin City Limits.After all the misfires and arguments with her labels, Williams launched into this tour with a lot of pent-up artistic energy, and she pulled together a tremendous band that featured a guitar army augmenting her own acoustic, with Kenny Vaughn and John Jackson on electrics and Jim Lauderdale on second acoustic. The stereo and multichannel mixes winningly separate the players so that the contribution of each (particularly Vaughn and Jackson's array of unusual axes) can be heard distinctly. With bass, drums, organ and accordion, there's still a surprising amount of room for Williams' vocals and Lauderdale's harmonies.The song list draws heavily from ""Car Wheels,"" including all but three of the album's titles. The set is filled out with tracks from ""Lucinda Williams"" and ""Sweet Old World,"" as well as a cover of Lil' Son Jackson's ""Disgusted"" that dates back to Williams' 1979 Smithsonian Folkways album, ""Ramblin'."" It's a balanced portrait of the sweet, sad and sandpaper sides of Williams' catalog, and a deep helping of her Southern-grounded songwriting.Williams is visually transported throughout the performance. The close-ups of her at the microphone find her gazing without focus, lost in the stories of her lyrics. Terse song introductions and a quick round of band introductions are her only interaction with the audience. Her interplay with the band is purely musical, as she never seems to engage them visually; Jim Lauderdale can often be seen in the background singing harmony, watching Williams as she looks straight ahead.The set reaches an emotional peak with a hypnotic 8-minute version of ""Joy"" on which Jackson's battle-worn Telecaster gets a fine slide workout, and Vaughn answers back with a blistering solo of his own. The electric catharsis appears to liberate Williams from her introspective trance as she launches into the closing ""Can't Let Go."" Crisp video and Stereo/DTS/5.1 audio tracks make this a must-have for Williams' fans, and a strong introduction for those just finding her as an artist.

Her voice to her songs, as well as her band, who are all top-notch professionals, are just phenomenal, but her stage presence is sometimes not easy on the eyes. It took full 6 songs til' the first few smiles came across as Lucinda just stood there without much action as if she was in some sort of pain and she sang her songs. Her guitarist Kenny Vaughan was more lively and added extra juice to her performance. Also, one of her guitarists looks like Eric Clapton, although it's not Clapton, and he too also plays pretty good, and that was a nice little touch on the side.Her live performance on this DVD sounds very similar to her studio version of the songs and at the end Lucinda delivered an extended version of ""Joy"" and an abbreviated version of ""Can't Let Go."" I think the studio version of ""Can't let go"" was much better on the album (Car Wheels on a Gravel Road), and it would have been nice if they had extended ""Can't let go"" instead of ""Joy"", but that's probably a matter of taste.Since it's the only DVD of Lucinda Williams out there, it is a ""must"" for every Lucinda Williams collection; and I also recommend her new and first live CD (2 CDs) ""Live at the Fillmore"" which is really excellent as it was recorded in November 2003, although the CD is a little bit on the edge side, but the ""Fillmore CD"" is a great CD.",4,Excellent Performance! -- DVD lacks features,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1738,"['would', 'have', 'loved', 'give', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'features', 'meaning', 'are', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'option', 'Widescreen', 'etc', 'yes', 'know', 'was', 'recorded', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'TV', 'December', '1998', 'actually', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'just', 'photography', 'high', 'quality.It', 'basic', 'Lucinda', 'Williams', 'concert', '16', 'then', 'created', 'songs', 'voice', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'top-notch', 'professionals', 'are', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'stage', 'presence', 'sometimes', 'not', 'easy', 'eyes', 'took', 'full', '6', 'songs', 'til', 'first', 'few', 'smiles', 'came', 'Lucinda', 'just', 'stood', 'there', 'much', 'action', 'was', 'sort', 'pain', 'sang', 'songs', 'guitarist', 'Kenny', 'Vaughan', 'was', 'more', 'lively', 'added', 'extra', 'juice', 'performance', 'Also', 'one', 'guitarists', 'looks', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'not', 'Clapton', 'too', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'nice', 'little', 'touch', 'side.Her', 'live', 'performance', 'DVD', 'very', 'similar', 'studio', 'version', 'songs', 'end', 'Lucinda', 'delivered', 'extended', 'version', 'Joy', 'abbreviated', 'version', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Let', 'Go', 'think', 'studio', 'version', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'album', 'Car', 'Wheels', 'Gravel', 'Road', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'extended', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'instead', 'Joy', 'probably', 'matter', 'taste.Since', 'only', 'DVD', 'Lucinda', 'Williams', 'there', 'must', 'Lucinda', 'Williams', 'collection', 'also', 'recommend', 'new', 'first', 'live', 'CD', '2', 'CDs', 'Live', 'Fillmore', 'really', 'excellent', 'was', 'recorded', 'November', '2003', 'CD', 'little', 'bit', 'edge', 'side', 'Fillmore', 'CD', 'great', 'CD']",N/A

And if you are familiar with her albums -- you know this high standard is the norm. Williams sings about real people in an American geography that is both familiar and intimate.  Memphis, Lake Charles, Greenfield, and car wheels on a gravel road. Whew. You can practically hear the laughter, see the beer bottles rolling on the floorboard, feel the summer night breeze on your face, and the tender kiss may come with it.
