40619,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0782008348,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","High Noon 40th, 1952 filmThe film begins with a man sitting and waiting. Another comes to join him. Then a third man, and they ride into town. People notice them. Pierce, Miller, and Colby ask about the train schedule. Will Kane and Amy Fowler wed. Kane is the Town Marshal, but intends to quit. A telegram brings news of Frank Miller's pardon! [Some kind of payoff in those days?] Kane is advised to leave town. [Can every problem be avoided as a solution?] No, Kane decides to return; he doesn't even have a gun! [Unbelievable.] Kane could never be safe as long as those four were after him. ""I'm not trying to be a hero."" With special deputies he will outnumber them. Amy asks him to choose between her whims and his experience and judgment. The judge decides to skip town. Deputy Harvey goes to see Marshal Kane, he wants the job and a recommendation.We learn about the past relationships of Harvey, Kane, and Frank Miller! Mrs. Ramirez wants to sell her store quickly so she can leave on the noon train. Will the hotel be more prosperous when Frank Miller is back? Harvey is in the saloon. Ben Miller drops in for a bottle. Kane asks for help in the saloon, none volunteer. [Why?] Neither does a friend. Jimmy asks to join, he used to be good with a gun. Kane goes to the church to ask for all the special deputies he can get to help him. The church members argue over what must be done. Time is running short. Can a problem be solved by ""deferred maintenance""? ""They just don't care."" [Why?] Mark says he is too old. Mrs. Kane visits Mrs. Ramirez for help, but she is leaving too. Amy's personal experiences are explained. [A clue to the future?] ""A smart man knows when to back away."" Harvey talks to Kane. [Does this fight make sense? Note the bruises.] One man had volunteered, but Herb doesn't like the odds. The clock strikes noon. The steam train whistles its approach. Kane writes a holographic Last Will and Testament.Marshal Kane walks into Main Street and watches the wagon leave for the train station. Frank Miller detrains and joins those three men. Breaking glass warns Kane. Shots are fired, not it is three against one. The hunting goes on, one man runs into the barn. Now it is two against one. The stable is set afire. Kane frees the horses and escapes. One man is shot from behind! [I won't tell who did it.] Only Frank Miller is left. Then Kane appears in the street. It is over at last. Will and Amy are reunited. Will tosses his tin star into the dust.""The Making of High Noon"" follows. Monochrome is used to reduce costs, as in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", when an unconventional movie is produced. This story is based on ""The Tin Star"", a 1947 story in Collier's Magazine. Carl Foreman was an ""unfriendly witness"" before HUAC, a man who stood for what he believed in. The script was an excellent drama. The low budget excluded the usual padding. Western movies show the pioneers who overcame adversity; this provides hope for the common people.The story takes place in virtually real time. This is a morality play where a good man triumphs over villains. It doesn't give the background from five years ago when Frank Miller was convicted of manslaughter. Was he involved in the running of that ""hotel"" and a gambling casino? Did Will Kane move in to take over? In the 19th century the local Committee of Vigilance would have eliminated robbers and murderers. A Town Marshal was elected by the voters, but the local power elite would have selected a man to do their bidding. A Marshal who best represented the people would have no problem in getting special deputies. This story goes against these historical facts. Having a woman with a firearm is also unconventional, but few dared to comment on this. This one-man army is similar to the later ""Rambo"" movies.",5,A Drama About Personal Responsibilities,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,3782,"['High', 'Noon', '40th', '1952', 'filmThe', 'film', 'man', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'join', 'Then', 'third', 'man', 'ride', 'town', 'People', 'Pierce', 'Miller', 'Colby', 'ask', 'train', 'schedule', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Amy', 'Fowler', 'wed.', 'Kane', 'Town', 'Marshal', 'quit', 'telegram', 'news', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'pardon', 'kind', 'payoff', 'days', ']', 'Kane', 'advised', 'leave', 'town', '[', 'Can', 'problem', 'be', 'avoided', 'solution', 'Kane', 'return', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'gun', '[', 'Unbelievable', ']', 'Kane', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'safe', 'as', 'long', 'four', 'were', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'hero', 'special', 'deputies', 'will', 'outnumber', 'Amy', 'choose', 'whims', 'experience', 'judgment', 'judge', 'skip', 'town', 'Deputy', 'Harvey', 'see', 'Marshal', 'Kane', 'job', 'recommendation.We', 'learn', 'past', 'relationships', 'Harvey', 'Kane', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Mrs.', 'Ramirez', 'sell', 'store', 'quickly', 'can', 'leave', 'noon', 'train', 'Will', 'hotel', 'be', 'more', 'prosperous', 'when', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'back', 'Harvey', 'saloon', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'bottle', 'Kane', 'help', 'saloon', 'none', 'volunteer', '[', 'Why', ']', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'join', 'used', 'be', 'good', 'gun', 'Kane', 'church', 'ask', 'special', 'deputies', 'can', 'get', 'help', 'church', 'members', 'argue', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Time', 'running', 'short', 'Can', 'problem', 'be', 'solved', 'deferred', 'maintenance', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Why', ']', 'Mark', 'too', 'old', 'Mrs.', 'Kane', 'Mrs.', 'Ramirez', 'help', 'leaving', 'too', 'Amy', 'personal', 'experiences', 'are', 'explained', '[', 'clue', 'future', ']', 'A', 'smart', 'man', 'when', 'back', 'away', 'Harvey', 'talks', 'Kane', '[', 'fight', 'make', 'sense', 'Note', 'bruises', ']', 'One', 'man', 'had', 'volunteered', 'Herb', ""n't"", 'like', 'odds', 'clock', 'strikes', 'noon', 'steam', 'train', 'approach', 'Kane', 'holographic', 'Last', 'Will', 'Testament.Marshal', 'Kane', 'walks', 'Main', 'Street', 'wagon', 'leave', 'train', 'station', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'detrains', 'joins', 'three', 'men', 'Breaking', 'glass', 'Kane', 'Shots', 'are', 'fired', 'not', 'three', 'one', 'hunting', 'one', 'man', 'barn', 'Now', 'two', 'one', 'stable', 'set', 'afire', 'Kane', 'horses', 'escapes', 'One', 'man', 'shot', '[', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'did', 'Only', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'left', 'Then', 'Kane', 'street', 'last', 'Will', 'Amy', 'are', 'reunited', 'Will', 'tosses', 'tin', 'star', 'dust', 'Making', 'High', 'Noon', 'Monochrome', 'used', 'reduce', 'costs', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'when', 'unconventional', 'movie', 'produced', 'story', 'based', 'Tin', 'Star', '1947', 'story', 'Collier', 'Magazine', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'was', 'unfriendly', 'witness', 'HUAC', 'man', 'who', 'stood', 'what', 'believed', 'script', 'was', 'excellent', 'drama', 'low', 'budget', 'excluded', 'usual', 'padding', 'Western', 'movies', 'show', 'pioneers', 'who', 'overcame', 'adversity', 'hope', 'common', 'people.The', 'story', 'place', 'virtually', 'real', 'time', 'morality', 'play', 'where', 'good', 'man', 'triumphs', 'villains', ""n't"", 'give', 'background', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'was', 'convicted', 'manslaughter', 'involved', 'running', 'hotel', 'gambling', 'casino', 'Did', 'Will', 'Kane', 'move', 'take', 'over', '19th', 'century', 'local', 'Committee', 'Vigilance', 'would', 'have', 'eliminated', 'robbers', 'murderers', 'Town', 'Marshal', 'was', 'elected', 'voters', 'local', 'power', 'elite', 'would', 'have', 'selected', 'man', 'do', 'bidding', 'Marshal', 'who', 'best', 'represented', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'getting', 'special', 'deputies', 'story', 'historical', 'facts', 'Having', 'woman', 'firearm', 'also', 'unconventional', 'few', 'dared', 'comment', 'one-man', 'army', 'similar', 'later', 'Rambo', 'movies']",N/A

The first thing that the audience notices is the great cast, everybody did a great job, there isn't a single weak performance. ""High Noon"" has 2 superstars from that decade: Gary Cooper & Grace Kelly.The plot of the movie is very good and interesting, and as the film moves forward it gets more and more interesting. By the way, ""High Noon"" was filmed in &quot;real time&quot;, because everything happens according to the time in the watch.During the last 25 minutes of the movie, the suspense grows increasingly until the movie reaches the climax, so the film gets better every minute. For these and other reasons, &quot;High Noon&quot; is a classic that must be seen, it's one of the most popular westerns ever made.",4,ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WESTERNS OF ALL TIME.,1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,845,"['quot', 'High', 'Noon', 'quot', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'appealing', 'first', 'thing', 'audience', 'notices', 'great', 'cast', 'everybody', 'did', 'great', 'job', ""n't"", 'single', 'weak', 'performance', 'High', 'Noon', '2', 'superstars', 'decade', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Grace', 'Kelly.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'film', 'forward', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'way', 'High', 'Noon', 'was', 'filmed', 'quot', 'real', 'time', 'quot', 'everything', 'according', 'time', 'watch.During', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'suspense', 'increasingly', 'movie', 'climax', 'film', 'better', 'minute', 'other', 'reasons', 'quot', 'High', 'Noon', 'quot', 'classic', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
40621,A23L2BR07AOBG1,0782008348,alex bushman,"[1, 2]","It also contains arguably the best music video style use in a motion picture.  The film opens with three men riding on horses together confidantly and with a purpose that isn't immediately apparent.  You start to think that this is going to be a good shoot em up film.  That mislead is a great thing that this film gets right.  To the person seeing it a second time (and hopefully not reading this review first) it dramatizes the incoming story well.  What you end up getting is a story about what is necessary to provoke action and whether ideals and quality of life are things worthy to fight for, whether fighting is necessary at all.  To a certain extent, the film becomes increasingly dry leading up to the ending, but I don't think the portions that take their time are bad in any way, they seem very real.  These portions are why people think this film is crap today, but back then the film came out around the time of the red scare and a number of people involved in the film were blacklisted.  The film also presents a hero who has to ask for help and doesn't really get any.  This flies in the face of all the Western fantasy of what a hero is like.  In the common Western the hero inspires by example, doesn't have to ask, always comes out on top, never breaks a sweat, and is always believed by the common folk in the film to be in the right.  ""High Noon"" is what is referred to as a revisionist western and John Wayne with his director friend Howard Hawks took the same idea and changed around the results creating the epic  ""Rio Bravo."" To restate the differences between the two films, this film is not an epic, but a story about underlying questions of principle in everyday life.  I imagine what most people disliked about this film was that it's a critique of society and presents all parties involved in a less than sterling light.  To me, the movie stands the test of time well because it's smart, it sticks to certain motif's throughout (the sense of dread through clocks), the opposition of the main character by his wife who's a Quaker.  Also, it separates itself from being a formulaic western thriller by not constantly keeping the water boiling and giving the audience time to consider the underlying principles and rationally judge the situation, just like the hero.  Interestingly, the film ends with the hero coming out on top, but it's not a positive thing here, it's almost an afterthought.  So, in summary, this is not an action western, it's a ponderous one, so if that's what you want, well you can rent/buy ""Rio Bravo.""

An instant classic, in recent years this film has been maligned. From what I understand, most of the negative feeling is because the movie has been so hyped. It is unfair to hype a movie so much since it raises impossible expectations. I was fortunate enough to have somehow missed the hyping. (Odd, since I love old movies) So when I saw this movie at the rental store, I vaguely remembered hearing it was good so I got it.The plot involves a lawman who will not leave town when he hears a killer he put in jail is released and will arrive on the noon train. His life falls apart, his friends abandon him, his wife leaves him but his honor will not allow him to leave. If this plot sounds cool, you will probably enjoy this movie. If not, you may want to try something else. You either accept the concept or you don't.Watching the movie, several things impressed me.First, I was impressed by Gary Cooper's acting. This was the first movie I ever saw him in and his anguish and nobility are just great. He richly deserved his oscar. The other standout is Katy Jurado as Cooper's old flame. While some racial bariers were coming down in the 50s, it was still very refreshing to see a Mexican character played by a Mexican actress in a movie of that time. She adds a note of authenticity to the movie that would not have been there otherwise and her performance is flawless.Second, I enjoyed the fact that movie was black and white. Color films of the era were candy colored, almost too bright, which is fine for a comedy or a musical but kind of ruins historic movies for me.Third, the suspense kept me glued to the screen until the last moment. And the ending was just great.Whew! I guess I can see why so many critics hyped this movie! Well, don't let anyone else influence you.

Good thing the men who fought for us in the Revolutionary War didn't refuse to join the Army because they ""got a wife and kids"".And make no mistake, the U.S. Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment in the base of our political system as a way for the citizenry to remain armed in order to oppose tyranny.  Now it may be true that they were worried more about tyranny from oppressive governments both foreign and domestic, but just how good would the people of Kane's town be against tyranny on a national scale when they couldn't even be bothered to stand up against it in their own back yard?In High Noon Will Kane eventually finds help from his own wife who comes to see that she owes more loyalty to her vows to her husband than to some goofy religious belief that says that to fight evil you lie down in front of it and spread your legs -- figuratively, if not literally.In Rio Bravo the sheriff says upholding the law is the job of professionals, then what does he do?  Like his friend says, he employs a drunk and a cripple, and then decides he needs more help and looks to a teenager and deputizes the kid.  LOL  Said cripple, by the way, who so unprofessionally shoots and nearly blows the head off of a fellow deputy and can't even admit it when he made a mistake.  (""How was I supposed to know the Dude was gonna go and git hisself duded up?  Huh?...  HUH???"")  And then when Feathers tries to sit guard in the lobby of the hotel and falls asleep Chance treats her tenderly for her effort and carries her off to bed.  Looks like Wayne and Hawks couldn't make up their minds just what it was they believed!  Sort of schizoid, IMO.Too bad for them, but no reason for us to not take away some important lessons from both of these movies, one of which is that it seems it is never comfortable or convenient nor can we expect the timing to be ""right"" when we are called upon to stand up against evil; and having one's personal demons going on inside is no excuse to bow out of the fray, turn inward, and forsake the common good.",5,High Noon vs. Rio Bravo,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,2767,"['High', 'Noon', 'vs.', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Should', 'think', 'competition', 'when', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'was', 'made', 'protest', 'way', 'Will', 'Kane', 'had', 'go', 'around', 'town', 'looking', 'special', 'deputies', 'only', 'get', 'turned', 'down', 'behind-the-scenes', 'talk', 'John', 'Wayne', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'had', 'contempt', 'High', 'Noon', 'way', 'protagonist', 'went', 'looking', 'help', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'Guess', 'two', 'guys', 'never', 'heard', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'even', 'special', 'deputies', 'posses', 'Actually', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'movies', 'have', 'messages', 'worth', 'learning', 'One', 'should', 'see', 'true', 'life', 'experiences', 'High', 'Noon', 'town', 'people', 'had', 'excuses', 'why', 'helping', 'out', 'marshal', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'moment', 'Good', 'thing', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'did', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'join', 'Army', 'got', 'wife', 'kids', '.And', 'make', 'mistake', 'U.S', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'included', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'base', 'political', 'system', 'way', 'citizenry', 'remain', 'armed', 'order', 'oppose', 'tyranny', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'were', 'worried', 'more', 'tyranny', 'oppressive', 'governments', 'foreign', 'domestic', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'would', 'people', 'Kane', 'town', 'be', 'tyranny', 'national', 'scale', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'back', 'yard', 'High', 'Noon', 'Will', 'Kane', 'eventually', 'help', 'own', 'wife', 'who', 'see', 'more', 'loyalty', 'vows', 'husband', 'goofy', 'religious', 'belief', 'fight', 'evil', 'lie', 'down', 'front', 'spread', 'legs', 'figuratively', 'not', 'literally.In', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'sheriff', 'upholding', 'law', 'job', 'professionals', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'friend', 'drunk', 'cripple', 'then', 'more', 'help', 'teenager', 'kid', 'LOL', 'Said', 'cripple', 'way', 'who', 'so', 'unprofessionally', 'shoots', 'nearly', 'head', 'fellow', 'deputy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'admit', 'when', 'made', 'mistake', 'How', 'was', 'supposed', 'know', 'Dude', 'was', 'gon', 'go', 'git', 'hisself', 'duded', 'up', 'Huh', 'HUH', 'then', 'when', 'Feathers', 'sit', 'guard', 'lobby', 'hotel', 'asleep', 'Chance', 'tenderly', 'effort', 'off', 'bed', 'Wayne', 'Hawks', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'believed', 'Sort', 'schizoid', 'IMO.Too', 'bad', 'reason', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'important', 'lessons', 'movies', 'one', 'never', 'comfortable', 'convenient', 'can', 'expect', 'timing', 'be', 'right', 'when', 'are', 'called', 'stand', 'up', 'evil', 'having', 'one', 'personal', 'demons', 'going', 'inside', 'excuse', 'bow', 'fray', 'turn', 'inward', 'forsake', 'common', 'good']",N/A

Next, the Special Features are engrossing, with a new documentary about the making of the legendary Western, including appreciations by a number of actors and fans (including ex-President Bill Clinton), and a long-overdue look at the remarkable Oscar-winning Dimitri Tiomkin score and song, ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'"", and it's iconic performer, Tex Ritter, plus a 'live' Ritter performance (on radio), and much more. Finally, the packaging is beautiful, so nice that you may be tempted to keep it on the coffee table rather than on the shelf!That the film was ever made is the stuff of legend...A producer better known for contemporary 'message' films (Stanley Kramer), a European director who had never made a Western (Fred Zinnemann), a screenwriter about to be blacklisted for refusing to buckle under the paranoia of the times (Carl Foreman), and an ailing, aging superstar who was considered 'washed up' after a string of flops (Gary Cooper), combined their talents for a film that flew against all the 'rules' for a successful Western...filmed in black and while, in near-documentary style, with no sweeping vistas, and at nearly 'real' time...and stirred immediate controversy with it's less-than-flattering portrayal of a town's cowardice, incurring the anger of no less than John Ford, Howard Hawks, and John Wayne.

Meadows,"[3, 4]","Most reviews focus on the inner-turmoil/conflict of Gary Cooper's character and how he deals with this inner-turmoil/conflict; however, many reviews neglect completely to consider the extreme moral conflict experienced by the Grace Kelley character. Obviously, Cooper is THE star of the film while Kelley was still basically a new-comer to films. It has to be remembered that Kane's life has been one in which violence/death has been a major component.  His moral conflict is significantly different from that of his new wife. Kane is a world-weary realist who has no pretenses about the harsh, ugly, and often brutal realities of the world. On the other hand, his young and idealistic wife who was raised in the cloistered Quaker community has yet to see the extremely gross underside of humanity. She doesn't yet realize that survival is often based on violence; and that violence is the only ""language"" some people understand.I'm of the school of thought that Kelley's character experiences a greater moral dilemma than that of Kane. She is forced to completely abandon her beliefs, code of ethics, and self-sacrificing mentality to save the life of the man she loves--both a noble and self-serving act. She is painted into a corner by circumstances in which she is forced to make agonizing life-choices; trying desperately to adhere to religious beliefs that involve the denial of self. Like Kane at the start of the film who can't run away and live with himself, Kelley's character can't run away at the end of the film and live with herself.  She has to go back and have her own personal showdown.Because Cooper gets the bulk of screen-time, the viewer has a tendency to forget about Kelley's character and what's churning inside her. BOTH Kane and Kelley's character experience parallel conflicts/choices basically alone. Kelley's character is--in some ways--more alone because she is a stranger to the town. She has no one to turn to for counsel, except Kane's former romantic interest. What a terrible spot to be in.

Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because ""I have to,"" and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and ""courage under fire,"" a character who says in the novel that ""abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene""? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing.It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like ""24,"" and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either.

When I read a plot summary of this movie, I could not wait to get it home and watch.  I could not believe how  disappointed I was.  The plot had so many details and layers that could  have been explored, but no.  It fails on almost every level.  The only  saving grace is that Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly look good in it. Also, I  appreciated the unself conscious approach to references to an interracial  romance that ended before the beginning of the movie, something quite  remarkable for a movie from the early fifties.  Everything else is just off  the mark.  I still can't believe that Tiomkin's song became so popular.  There are so many holes in this most boring of scripts.  What really  shocked me was the subpar cinematography and production values, especially  for a film that they obviously had spent a lot of money on.  The story  takes the course of a single day, but there were so many continuity  problems in terms of lighting(i.e. 5pm looked like noon and noon looked  like dusk).  Grace Kelly spends the entire film wandering around and  pouting.  Cooper and Lloyd Bridges were absolutely disappointing.  I gave  it two stars only because it was a very influential film and became its own  archetypes for many films to come.  This movie represents all the ills that  come from a film industry that was oppressed by production codes and  McCarthyism.  Don't waste your time.

Aside from a brief tussle between Cooper & Bridges, there is no action until roughly the last 10 minutes of the movie.It is interesting how widely perceptions vary with this movie.  To me, that is the hallmark of good work, because the answers aren't in black & white.  Again, not the typical Western.  We know that the outlaws are the bad guys, but are the townspeople also villains, or are they simply trying to do the best they can to protect their own collective self-interest by choosing the past of least resistance?  Is Will Kane a hero, or is he too proud to run --- or is he, like the townspeople, simply calculating what is in his best interests?  After all, he has a better chance of protecting himself within the city limits than he does out on the open prairie --- he says as much himself.  He takes the gamble that enough townspeople will appreciate the job he has done as marshal & will help him face the outlaws --- as it turns out, he guesses wrong and has to face the music.  It would have made a most interesting outcome if Will Kane had been gunned down in the streets, and the townspeople also made to face the music for their own decisions.As has been said time and again, this started out as a subtle allegory of the failure of intellectuals to stand up to the persecutions of HUAC and McCarthy, but the themes of the film now transcend those topical references and keep it from being dated.  Of course, it is the definitive Gary Cooper role --- in many ways more vulnerable than heroic.  One can see in his face that he knows damned well that he'll probably be dead in a few minutes, and it makes his character all that much more compelling as a result.Everybody should be able to identify with this story --- at one time or another, we've practically all been a Will Kane or a citizen in the town, and we've had to make the tough decisions.

That is has become so lauded, even as it was a low budget project, with almost no great nor spectacular battle scenes, is another reason so many of the classic Western film lovers have railed at it. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby does a good, if not spectacular, job. There is one infamous goof that he and film editors committed, and that is in a crane shot, late in the film, where the camera pulls back and up to reveal the town deserted and Kane alone. Unfortunately, in the upper left hand corner of the film, telephone poles and wires are clearly visible. Crosby's mot notable touch was in not fetishizing the Western tableaux, instead not filtering the light reflected from the surroundings, which led to a blanched, dessicated look to the black and white cinematography; along the lines of then contemporary documentary films.The DVD, put out by Lionsgate, comes with two disks. Disk one is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the transfer is spotless. The remastering of the film is superb. It scintillates with clarity. It also includes an audio commentary by the progeny of many of the people involved- the late actor, John Ritter, Carl Foreman's son, Jonathan, Fred Zinneman's son, Tim, and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper-Janis. As in most commentaries featuring non-experts, this one quickly descends into meaningless banter and anecdotes, and many, `Gee, whiz, wasn't dad great' moments. The only comment of any worth comes when it's mentioned that, before he kills the first of the desperadoes, Kane calls out Miller's name, and shorts the man, therefore not plugging him in the back. The comment states this displays Kane's personal code of ethics, and while this is true, it is also one of the weaker moments in the film, because it goes against many of the other realistic moments (as does the plethora of 1950s-speak: Gollys and Gee whizzes abound)- a fact unmentioned in the commentary. But, good observations as this are rare on the track. Given the film's stature as a Western classic, one would have hoped for at least one expert commentary, by a noted historian of cinema. The second disk features a 50 minute making of film, Inside High Noon, and a shorter making of featurette. There is a featurette on singer Tex Ritter; a clip of Ritter singing the Oscar winning song Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' on the Jimmy Dean tv show, a featurette called Behind High Noon, and a radio broadcast featuring Ritter. All of these features are useful, but none is really standout, nor top of the line, compared to the best DVD features. The real killer, as mentioned, is no expert commentary track.High Noon is certainly a classic, and with a few better decisions scriptwise and characterwise, and with a few better decisions technically, it would truly have been a great film. Greatness and classicality, however, are unrelated beasts. This film is classic melodrama stripped to its naked rot, and plays out almost like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. Its narrative bears down upon the viewer like the train that carries Frank Miller. It has moments of poignancy (see the looks between Kane and Helen), black humor (see when the hotel clerk asks Kane if he can find Helen's room when the marshal ascends the stairs), and mythos (scan the characters' names and personal traits for counterparts in assorted mythologies); as well as an ability to amplify these characteristics (note how every shot of the clocks, which visually builds tension, is accompanied by a slightly strumming sound). Technically, the film is top notch, but its fundamentals sag a bit. If only the bulk of films today could display such vices and virtues, what a wonderfully mortal art the masses could wallow in.",4,Good,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4023,"['Critically', 'film', 'was', 'innovative', 'structure', 'avoiding', 'most', 'real', 'Western', 'action', 'end', 'film', 'avoided', 'number', 'stereotypes', 'popularized', 'higher', 'profile', 'filmmakers', 'John', 'Ford', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Western', 'icon', 'John', 'Wayne', 'derided', 'un-American', 'as', 'well', 'worse', 'things', 'become', 'so', 'lauded', 'even', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'project', 'almost', 'great', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'scenes', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'Western', 'film', 'lovers', 'have', 'railed', 'Cinematographer', 'Floyd', 'Crosby', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'job', 'one', 'infamous', 'goof', 'film', 'editors', 'committed', 'crane', 'shot', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'back', 'up', 'reveal', 'town', 'deserted', 'Kane', 'alone', 'Unfortunately', 'upper', 'left', 'hand', 'corner', 'film', 'telephone', 'poles', 'wires', 'are', 'clearly', 'visible', 'Crosby', 'mot', 'notable', 'touch', 'was', 'not', 'fetishizing', 'Western', 'tableaux', 'instead', 'not', 'filtering', 'light', 'reflected', 'surroundings', 'led', 'blanched', 'dessicated', 'look', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'lines', 'then', 'contemporary', 'documentary', 'films.The', 'DVD', 'put', 'out', 'Lionsgate', 'two', 'disks', 'Disk', 'one', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'transfer', 'spotless', 'remastering', 'film', 'superb', 'clarity', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'progeny', 'many', 'people', 'involved-', 'late', 'actor', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Fred', 'Zinneman', 'son', 'Tim', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'Cooper-Janis', 'most', 'commentaries', 'featuring', 'non-experts', 'one', 'quickly', 'meaningless', 'banter', 'anecdotes', 'many', 'Gee', 'whiz', 'was', ""n't"", 'dad', 'great', 'moments', 'only', 'comment', 'worth', 'when', 'mentioned', 'first', 'desperadoes', 'Kane', 'out', 'Miller', 'name', 'man', 'therefore', 'not', 'plugging', 'back', 'comment', 'Kane', 'personal', 'code', 'ethics', 'true', 'also', 'one', 'weaker', 'moments', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'realistic', 'moments', 'plethora', '1950s-speak', 'Gollys', 'Gee', 'abound', 'fact', 'unmentioned', 'commentary', 'good', 'observations', 'are', 'rare', 'track', 'Given', 'film', 'stature', 'Western', 'classic', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'least', 'one', 'expert', 'commentary', 'noted', 'historian', 'cinema', 'second', 'disk', '50', 'minute', 'making', 'film', 'Inside', 'High', 'Noon', 'shorter', 'making', 'featurette', 'featurette', 'singer', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'clip', 'Ritter', 'singing', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'song', 'Do', 'Not', 'Forsake', 'Me', 'Oh', 'My', 'Darlin', 'Jimmy', 'Dean', 'tv', 'show', 'featurette', 'called', 'Behind', 'High', 'Noon', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'featuring', 'Ritter', 'features', 'are', 'useful', 'none', 'really', 'standout', 'top', 'line', 'compared', 'best', 'DVD', 'features', 'real', 'killer', 'mentioned', 'expert', 'commentary', 'track.High', 'Noon', 'certainly', 'classic', 'few', 'better', 'decisions', 'scriptwise', 'characterwise', 'few', 'better', 'decisions', 'technically', 'would', 'truly', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'Greatness', 'classicality', 'however', 'are', 'unrelated', 'beasts', 'film', 'classic', 'melodrama', 'stripped', 'naked', 'rot', 'out', 'almost', 'episode', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'narrative', 'bears', 'down', 'viewer', 'train', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'moments', 'poignancy', 'see', 'looks', 'Kane', 'Helen', 'black', 'humor', 'see', 'when', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'Kane', 'can', 'find', 'Helen', 'room', 'when', 'marshal', 'stairs', 'mythos', 'scan', 'characters', 'names', 'personal', 'traits', 'counterparts', 'assorted', 'mythologies', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'amplify', 'characteristics', 'note', 'how', 'shot', 'clocks', 'visually', 'tension', 'accompanied', 'slightly', 'strumming', 'sound', 'Technically', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'fundamentals', 'sag', 'bit', 'only', 'bulk', 'films', 'today', 'could', 'display', 'such', 'vices', 'virtues', 'what', 'wonderfully', 'mortal', 'art', 'masses', 'could', 'wallow']",N/A

This movie plays to our emotions, on so many different levels.  It's reaffirmation of a man, doing his duty as a man.  Much like the patriot, who fights for God and country! To watch it again, is to once again reaffirm your own manliness and resolve.  It's a study of different male natures, and raw motivations. Those who would join the fight if they were to benefit.  Friends, who are there for you until circumstances look a bit too dire.  The nave young boy, who would enter the fight without knowing the consequences. To the political arm of the town who tried to convince Kane to run, knowing the trouble would likely follow him, and pass them by.The women in the story are just as interesting.  You have the Pure young Quaker wife, (who's religious convictions would normally preclude violence of any kind) reluctantly coming to grips with reality of the situation.  You have the scarlet woman, who recognizes the rare value of Kane's heroic nature. They've had an obvious relationship in the past, but likely she could never meet him on equal grounds of morality. The wives who hide out in the church, and help squelch any male support from the townsmen.  Their motivation is simple enough, they know someone will likely get shot, and they'd rather their men did not participate.This particular edition is not released yet as I write this, so I haven't confirmed this.  I do believe one of the commentaries (some which have aired on TV before) mentions the unlikely case this could have happened at the time presented in the film.  If I recall, they explained that most towns of this type were full of ex-civil war vets, who would have had no qualms what-so-ever about taking up guns, to help the Marshall. This may be true, but it's not the point of the film.  In the end, Kane drops his tin star in the dirt, and appears to turn his back on the town in disgust.  I had some thoughts about that, but always believed that his disgust was not over the betrayal of the town.  I thought he believed that the town betrayed themselves, and was disgusted with the thought of it.I did wonder one more thing at the end of the movie.  Since Kane's' wife jumped off the train, just as it was leaving the station, how did she get all her luggage back, and loaded up in that wagon right after the gunfight?  The airlines could use baggage handlers that good!",5,Classic Western is a must for any fans DVD library.,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2831,"['very', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'most', 'have', 'seen', 'likely', 'more', 'once', 'best', 'thing', 'try', 'do', 'here', 'justifying', 'purchase', 'one', 'thing', 'clean', 'digitized', 'version', 'original', 'negative', 'Not', 'DVDs', 'are', 'many', 'regret', 'buyers', 'lot', 'extra', 'interviews', 'making', 'specials', 'often', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'film', 'again', 'know', 'inside', 'stuff', 'film', 'so', 'watchable', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'movie', 'emotions', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'reaffirmation', 'man', 'doing', 'duty', 'man', 'Much', 'patriot', 'who', 'God', 'country', 'watch', 'again', 'once', 'again', 'reaffirm', 'own', 'manliness', 'resolve', 'study', 'different', 'male', 'natures', 'raw', 'motivations', 'who', 'would', 'join', 'fight', 'were', 'benefit', 'Friends', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'circumstances', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'dire', 'nave', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'would', 'enter', 'fight', 'knowing', 'consequences', 'political', 'arm', 'town', 'who', 'tried', 'convince', 'Kane', 'run', 'knowing', 'trouble', 'would', 'likely', 'follow', 'pass', 'by.The', 'women', 'story', 'are', 'just', 'interesting', 'have', 'Pure', 'young', 'Quaker', 'wife', 'who', 'religious', 'convictions', 'would', 'normally', 'preclude', 'violence', 'kind', 'reluctantly', 'coming', 'grips', 'reality', 'situation', 'have', 'scarlet', 'woman', 'who', 'rare', 'value', 'Kane', 'heroic', 'nature', ""'ve"", 'had', 'obvious', 'relationship', 'past', 'likely', 'could', 'never', 'meet', 'equal', 'grounds', 'morality', 'wives', 'who', 'hide', 'out', 'church', 'help', 'squelch', 'male', 'support', 'townsmen', 'motivation', 'simple', 'enough', 'know', 'someone', 'will', 'likely', 'get', 'shot', ""'d"", 'rather', 'men', 'did', 'not', 'participate.This', 'particular', 'edition', 'not', 'released', 'yet', 'write', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'confirmed', 'do', 'believe', 'one', 'commentaries', 'have', 'aired', 'TV', 'unlikely', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'time', 'presented', 'film', 'recall', 'explained', 'most', 'towns', 'type', 'were', 'full', 'ex-civil', 'war', 'vets', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'qualms', 'what-so-ever', 'taking', 'up', 'guns', 'help', 'Marshall', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'end', 'Kane', 'tin', 'star', 'dirt', 'turn', 'back', 'town', 'disgust', 'had', 'thoughts', 'always', 'believed', 'disgust', 'was', 'not', 'betrayal', 'town', 'thought', 'believed', 'town', 'betrayed', 'was', 'disgusted', 'thought', 'it.I', 'did', 'wonder', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'end', 'movie', 'Kane', 'wife', 'jumped', 'train', 'just', 'was', 'leaving', 'station', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'luggage', 'back', 'loaded', 'up', 'wagon', 'right', 'gunfight', 'airlines', 'could', 'use', 'baggage', 'handlers', 'good']",N/A

Right after his marriage to his new wife, news comes that an old enemy of Will Kane&#65533;s (Cooper) is coming to town to settle an old score.  So, instead of going on his honeymoon, Kane decides to stay in town, intending on getting help to defend against the man and his three goons.But everyone turns him down, and the more people back out, the harder it is to get help.  Even a man who had volunteered, upon finding there was no one else to assist, crawls back home to his wife and kids.  Kane is left to defend the town alone against four men who mean for him to die.  Not that you ever wonder if he&#65533;ll triumph, but the film is very suspenseful when it comes time for the showdown.This is presented in &#65533;real time&#65533; and there are clocks all over town to let you know how long until &#65533;high noon.&#65533;  The suspense builds as the minutes tick away.Another problem Will has is that his new wife (Grace Kelly) is a converted Quaker, and is therefore against violence in any form; so she does not support his decision to stay and fight, hoping he will at last choose to leave with her.Cooper is wonderful and deserved his Academy Award for this role, as he shows us the myriad emotions that a man deserted by his friends and faced with his imminent death experiences.  In a probable first for a western, he even lays his head down and cries at one point in despair.  And throughout the film he wears a mixed expression of worry, anger, and defiance.My one beef with this film is the ending.  There is all this drawn-out suspense building throughout the film and after the gunfight is over, the film ends too quickly.  There is no chance for us to assimilate what has happened or to be relieved at its outcome.  I felt jarred and wanted a bit of a tie-up with the events.  We should have at least been able to see him ride off in the coach for a while before the &#65533;The End&#65533; jumped up at us.So, I remove one star for the ending, but then add it back for Gary Cooper&#65533;s amazing performance of a real human being, not a caricature of a western hero.

40655,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0782008348,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 6]","Tex Ritter's Oscar-winning theme song is heard throughout reflecting the abandonment Marshal Will Kane feels when the town of Hadleyville refuses to help him face down some gunmen itching for revenge.  The aerial shot of him standing alone in the streets of Hadleyville exemplifies the struggle he faces.Thing is, he didn't have to go back.  He just got married to Amy, a nice Quaker woman, handed in his badge on his retirement day, and was about to embark on a new life until he gets word that three gunmen are awaiting the noon train bringing home Frank Miller, an outlaw Kane once arrested and sent to prison, now released.  However, Kane feels a burning responsibility to face them, and he returns, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One, even if he did flee, they would track him down, being the vindictive men they are.  Two, Kane's replacement won't arrive until tomorrow, and he doesn't want even a &quot;dirty little village in the middle of nowhere&quot; to become embroiled in chaos for even one day under Miller.However, not a finger is lifted to help him.  Harvey, a deputy sheriff, is sore at Kane for not being selected as the latter's replacement.  Others are friends of Miller.  Most of the time, they acknowledge the great service Kane has done for them as marshal, but at the same time, they say he was stupid for coming back, thinking that it would be the new marshal's responsibility to handle Miller and his thugs.  They're also scared &lt;rhymes with witless&gt; as well.That brings open the question of responsibility.  The citizens of Hadleyville bicker about whether it's the local government or the state government that's responsible for stopping criminals.  And if no one is willing to do so due to cowardice or denial, who else will?  Kane thus seems to be the only person willing to take that burden.  As Helen Ramirez, a former flame of Kane, points out, &quot;When he dies, this town will die too.&quot;  Despite her heart of steel, she does show some support for Kane in the end.Then there's the issue of pacifism versus self-defense.  It brings the question, when is it right to resort to violence?  When one is attacked?  When you see someone being attacked?  Also, the complaint that the judges and juries set free criminals captured by lawmen still rings true today.Gary Cooper deservedly won the Best Actor statue for his role as Will Kane.  And I'm not exactly a big fan of Grace Kelly but she did remarkably well in her first starring role.  Maybe it's because she played a Quaker and I lean towards non-violence, or that line of hers on guns:  &quot;I don't care who's right or who's wrong.  There's got to be some better way for people to live.&quot;Given his resemblance to a certain contemporary White House occupant, Lloyd Bridges's portrayal of Harvey made me cringe somewhat.  However, Katy Jurado as the resolute, steel-hearted Helen Ramirez gets honours as a fiercely independent woman who has to struggle with being a Mexican amid whites and a business owner as well.Many of the other supporting cast are worth mentioning.  Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin, Will's old mentor is one.  Harry Morgan, later to become Colonel Potter in MASH, has a small role as Sam Fuller.I also had fun keeping track of the time on the various clocks, be it the courthouse, barber shop, or Helen's room.  Obviously, all three don't tell the exact same time, but I kept time there was a ten-minute discrepancy on my clock from the time in the courthouse, 10:40 AM, to noon.

40658,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0782008348,Dennis Littrell,"[43, 52]","This is the quintessential Hollywood western.  It will continue to represent the genre for many decades to come.It stars Gary Cooper, one of the most beloved of leading men who personified soft-spoken heroic courage in scores of important films, including Beau Geste (1939), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Along Came Jones (1945), The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955), etc., and Grace Kelly in her debut role.  Directed by Fred Zinneman, whose credits include From Here to Eternity (1953), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Julia (1977) and a dozen more, High Noon tells the story of Will Kane, a small town marshal who, on his wedding day faces a man just let out of prison with three of his outlaw friends who are aiming to get revenge for his being sent up.The enduring image of the film is Gary Cooper walking tall in the deserted streets of the town in a black Western hat, a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt, black string necktie, watch chain, boots, and low slung holster and two belts, while off to the side inside the wooden buildings we see ""that big hand move along, nearin' high noon""--which is when the train arrives carrying the freed prisoner.Will Kane has cleaned up the town, but now the gunslingers return and he is their target.  His wife of less than an hour (Kelly) demands that he leave town.  The town itself, in fear of the gunmen, also wants him to leave town, hoping to take the fight away from them.  He tries to recruit deputies but everyone is afraid.  Even his lone deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him.  In the background is Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting ballad, sung by Tex Ritter: ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling (On This Our Wedding Day).""  Both Cooper and the song won Oscars.  Noteworthy was the fine performance by Kay Jurado as ... Ramirez, Cane's ex, a shrewd barroom lady and proprietress.What is interesting about the moral conflict (from the story, ""The Tin Star"" as interpreted for film by screenwriter Carl Foreman), that of facing your enemy rather than running, is that Kane's rationale is logical.  If he runs they will only come after him again and again.  Only two people get this, Kane and Ramirez.  The larger moral issue of whether to fight to defend yourself (Grace Kelly is cast as a Quaker and does not believe in killing) is resolved during the climatic shootout by Grace Kelly's character herself in a manner that did not set well with Quakers.How well does this black and white classic Western play today?  The town people seem cliches and the outlaws are quickly drawn, but Gary Cooper as Will Kane seems entirely believable, admirable, heroic in the best sense of the term as a man who knows the dangers, feels the fear, and yet must act, and he does.  He is no shallow, two-fisted, machine-gun hero so often seen in Hollywood productions, but a man of maturity whose ""grace under pressure"" (a fine definition of courage) tells us and himself who he really is.See this for Gary Cooper whose ""slow-talking, slow-walking,"" (lyrics from the Coaster's hit song from the fifties, ""And Along Came Jones""), and soft-spoken heroics delighted and enthralled a couple of generations of film-goers.",5,The tin star in the dust,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,3152,"['quintessential', 'Hollywood', 'western', 'will', 'continue', 'represent', 'genre', 'many', 'decades', 'come.It', 'stars', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'leading', 'men', 'who', 'personified', 'soft-spoken', 'heroic', 'courage', 'scores', 'important', 'films', 'including', 'Beau', 'Geste', '1939', 'Pride', 'Yankees', '1942', 'Along', 'Came', 'Jones', '1945', 'Court', 'Martial', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', '1955', 'etc.', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'debut', 'role', 'Directed', 'Fred', 'Zinneman', 'credits', 'include', 'Here', 'Eternity', '1953', 'A', 'Man', 'All', 'Seasons', '1966', 'Julia', '1977', 'dozen', 'more', 'High', 'Noon', 'story', 'Will', 'Kane', 'small', 'town', 'marshal', 'who', 'wedding', 'day', 'man', 'just', 'let', 'prison', 'three', 'outlaw', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'aiming', 'get', 'revenge', 'being', 'sent', 'up.The', 'enduring', 'image', 'film', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'walking', 'tall', 'deserted', 'streets', 'town', 'black', 'Western', 'hat', 'black', 'vest', 'long-sleeved', 'white', 'shirt', 'black', 'string', 'necktie', 'watch', 'chain', 'boots', 'low', 'slung', 'holster', 'two', 'belts', 'side', 'wooden', 'buildings', 'see', 'big', 'hand', 'move', 'along', 'high', 'noon', 'when', 'train', 'carrying', 'freed', 'prisoner.Will', 'Kane', 'cleaned', 'up', 'town', 'now', 'gunslingers', 'return', 'target', 'wife', 'less', 'hour', 'Kelly', 'leave', 'town', 'town', 'fear', 'gunmen', 'also', 'leave', 'town', 'hoping', 'take', 'fight', 'away', 'recruit', 'deputies', 'everyone', 'afraid', 'Even', 'lone', 'deputy', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'background', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'haunting', 'ballad', 'sung', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'Do', 'Not', 'Forsake', 'Me', 'Oh', 'My', 'Darling', 'Wedding', 'Day', 'Cooper', 'song', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Noteworthy', 'was', 'fine', 'performance', 'Kay', 'Jurado', 'Ramirez', 'Cane', 'ex', 'shrewd', 'barroom', 'lady', 'proprietress.What', 'interesting', 'moral', 'conflict', 'story', 'Tin', 'Star', 'interpreted', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'facing', 'enemy', 'rather', 'running', 'Kane', 'rationale', 'logical', 'will', 'only', 'come', 'again', 'again', 'Only', 'two', 'people', 'get', 'Kane', 'Ramirez', 'larger', 'moral', 'issue', 'fight', 'defend', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'cast', 'Quaker', 'not', 'believe', 'killing', 'resolved', 'climatic', 'shootout', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'character', 'manner', 'did', 'not', 'set', 'well', 'Quakers.How', 'well', 'black', 'white', 'classic', 'Western', 'play', 'today', 'town', 'people', 'seem', 'cliches', 'outlaws', 'are', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Will', 'Kane', 'entirely', 'believable', 'admirable', 'heroic', 'best', 'sense', 'term', 'man', 'who', 'dangers', 'fear', 'yet', 'must', 'act', 'shallow', 'two-fisted', 'machine-gun', 'hero', 'so', 'often', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'man', 'maturity', 'grace', 'pressure', 'fine', 'definition', 'courage', 'who', 'really', 'is.See', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'slow-talking', 'slow-walking', 'lyrics', 'Coaster', 'hit', 'song', 'fifties', 'Along', 'Came', 'Jones', 'soft-spoken', 'heroics', 'delighted', 'enthralled', 'couple', 'generations', 'film-goers']",N/A

I'll simply add a personal experience in support of my vote that this is probably the best film of all time.I first saw the film with my parents at a drive in.  I was six.  That was 50 years ago. I was fascinated by the movie and the music at the time and remain so to this day.I make it a point to watch High Noon again at least once a year and never tire of it.  If anything, it gets better with repeated viewing.  Repeated viewing provides an appreciation of the lesser things that help make this such a masterpiece--the great job the supporting actors did, the use of the music, the clock, the chair, etc. to build the tension until it becomes almost unbearable by the time the first whistle of the noon train sounds.One of my favorite scenes--In a role often overlooked, Katy Jurado as Helen Ramirez telling Harve, played by Lloyd Bridges, &quot;You are a nice looking boy, Harve.  You have beeg, strong shoulders.  But it takes more than beeg, strong shoulders to make a man.  Will Kane is a man.&quot;  Wow! Every line, every glance, every moment of this film is exceptional.At that first viewing 50 years ago, when the moment came when Kane fingers his badge and looks at the approaching townspeople, my quiet, proper mother blurted loudly at the screen, &quot;Throw it down in the dirt!&quot;  You had to know my mother, but a film which could get her to do that is truly powerful.Has the film aged well?  Allow me to offer as evidence that it has, the repeated references to it by none other than Tony Soprano in HBO's The Sopranos.  &quot;Whateva happened to Gary Coopa?  The strong, quiet type.  Just do what hadda be done.&quot;  The first time Tony makes this statement, you think he means Gary Cooper the actor in his common quiet, but strong roles. By season four, however, Tony adds to his repeated, &quot;Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?&quot; line, &quot;He faced down the Miller gang when none of those blankety blanks from town would help him.&quot;  You realize then that Tony means, not Gary Cooper, but Will Kane in High Noon.

His only choice is to stay and fight, hoping against all odds that he will still be alive when it is over.As I watched the film, I could sense that Kane must have had serious doubts as noon approached. Too late to run, even if it could have done any good. The townspeople - his so-called ""friends"" - abandoning him in his hour of need. One minute they are grateful for all that he has done for them and the next minute, they are writing him off for dead and making plans on how to live with Miller and his gang after they kill the marshall. Okay, not ALL the townspeople turned their backs on him. There was a young boy who Kane would not allow to fight, being so young. Another was a drunk, who doubtless truely wished to help, but would have ben no real good to the marshall. There was an eager volunteer who backed-out once he realized that it would only have been the two of them against Miller and his gang. Lastly, there were a few men who did volunteer to assist Kane, only to back-out after being talked out of it by their fellow townspeople. So, in the end, Kane stood all alone on an empty street. He even watched as his wife and former girlfriend rode past him on their way to board the very same train that Miller arrived on!Even though I knew how it would all end, having read about this film and never having seen it before, I had this strong feeling of tension as noon approached. I could even feel the twisting knot in my stomach as I saw the camera pan back, showing Kane standing alone on the street, with no one else around. Suspending disbelief, I wondered what Kane was thinking as the showdown approached.In the end, of course, Kane was alive and as he boarded his coach to leave town for the final time, I could also feel the strong sense of disgust at the townspeople for their cowardice and I could easily understand why he dropped his badge in the dust before boarding the wagon. If just four men had positioned themselves with rifles in windows overlooking the street, the fight could have been over in seconds, with only the outlaws getting killed and no one else hurt or endangered. Despite their superiority of numbers and the fact that had superior firepower over the outlaws, if only they had utilized it, they still cowered behind their doors and waited until the end.John Wayne's feeling towards this movie notwithstanding, this is a true American story: one man, standing alone against evil, despite all odds and having been abandoned by everyone he thought he could trust to help him.If only we all could be as courageous as Marshall Will Kane when the time comes.",5,Trapped Like A Rat In A Cage...,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,2759,"['how', 'Kane', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'Miller', 'will', 'chase', 'down', 'kill', 'fight', 'townspeople', 'will', 'not', 'lift', 'finger', 'help', 'only', 'choice', 'stay', 'fight', 'hoping', 'odds', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'when', 'over.As', 'watched', 'film', 'could', 'sense', 'Kane', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'serious', 'doubts', 'noon', 'approached', 'Too', 'late', 'run', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'townspeople', 'so-called', 'friends', 'abandoning', 'hour', 'need', 'One', 'minute', 'are', 'grateful', 'done', 'next', 'minute', 'are', 'writing', 'off', 'dead', 'making', 'plans', 'how', 'live', 'Miller', 'gang', 'kill', 'marshall', 'Okay', 'not', 'townspeople', 'turned', 'backs', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Kane', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'fight', 'being', 'so', 'young', 'was', 'drunk', 'who', 'doubtless', 'truely', 'wished', 'help', 'would', 'have', 'ben', 'real', 'good', 'marshall', 'was', 'eager', 'volunteer', 'who', 'backed-out', 'once', 'realized', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'Miller', 'gang', 'Lastly', 'were', 'few', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'volunteer', 'assist', 'Kane', 'only', 'back-out', 'being', 'talked', 'fellow', 'townspeople', 'So', 'end', 'Kane', 'stood', 'alone', 'empty', 'street', 'even', 'watched', 'wife', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'rode', 'way', 'board', 'very', 'same', 'train', 'Miller', 'arrived', 'Even', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'having', 'read', 'film', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'had', 'strong', 'feeling', 'tension', 'noon', 'approached', 'could', 'even', 'feel', 'twisting', 'knot', 'stomach', 'saw', 'camera', 'pan', 'back', 'showing', 'Kane', 'standing', 'alone', 'street', 'one', 'else', 'Suspending', 'disbelief', 'wondered', 'what', 'Kane', 'was', 'thinking', 'showdown', 'end', 'course', 'Kane', 'was', 'alive', 'boarded', 'coach', 'leave', 'town', 'final', 'time', 'could', 'also', 'feel', 'strong', 'sense', 'disgust', 'townspeople', 'cowardice', 'could', 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'dropped', 'badge', 'dust', 'boarding', 'wagon', 'just', 'four', 'men', 'had', 'positioned', 'rifles', 'windows', 'overlooking', 'street', 'fight', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seconds', 'only', 'outlaws', 'getting', 'killed', 'one', 'else', 'hurt', 'endangered', 'superiority', 'numbers', 'fact', 'had', 'superior', 'firepower', 'outlaws', 'only', 'had', 'utilized', 'still', 'cowered', 'doors', 'waited', 'end.John', 'Wayne', 'feeling', 'towards', 'movie', 'notwithstanding', 'true', 'American', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'standing', 'alone', 'evil', 'odds', 'having', 'been', 'abandoned', 'everyone', 'thought', 'could', 'trust', 'help', 'him.If', 'only', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'courageous', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Kane', 'when', 'time']",N/A
40665,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,0782008348,Edward,"[1, 3]","By the time the strong, soft-spoken &quot;High Noon&quot; was released in 1952, Westerns had become increasingly thoughtful. Facing the villain may have been a necessity, but it was done with doubts or drawbacks, even recriminations. In &quot;High Noon&quot; the respected marshal of a small, isolated town must face the return of a convict being released from the prison term to which the marshal had sent him. The marshal has just married a Quaker woman and is retiring from his post to run a store in a distant town. Knowing that the ex-con's primary objective in coming to town is to kill the marshal, the population (including venerable character actors Thomas Mitchell, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney, Jr.) would just as soon the marshal leave as quickly as possible and let nature take its course. (I THINK the idea is the ex-con and his henchmen will ride into town, ...,  maybe rob the bank, then be on their way.) The marshal, however, feels morally compelled to stand his ground against the threat, asking only for a little support. Slowly, the whole town turns against him. Carl Foreman's tight screenplay sets up the situation expertly, and the fine craftsman Fred Zinneman was chosen to direct. The picture opens on the plains outside town, and the first close-up belongs to Lee Van Cleef, which is perfect. He had the meanest eyes in movies: one glance and you knew somebody was in deep trouble. When the story moves into town, there are constant references to time, with a wall clock visible in three opening interiors. Because the story is told in &quot;real time&quot;, the editing and continuity are crucial, and the editors deservedly won an Oscar, as did Dimitri Tiomkin's theme song, sung by Grand Ole Opry star Tex Ritter. Gary Cooper won his second Oscar playing the marshal. He was obviously old enough to play the heroine's father, not her bridegroom; but I think his maturity heightens the film's sense of impending mortality. The marshal is a man with death on his mind, so there is a minimum of that goofy shyness that was a part of Cooper's romantic shtik. In contrast to the marshal is his deputy, played by a young Lloyd Bridges, whose bland good looks and slightly puzzled expression cause the other characters to dismiss him as immature. And the sultry Katy Jurado is suppose to be his mistress!? She treats him like cookies and milk. Completing the contrast is Katy Jurado's brunette mystery against the pellucid beauty of Grace Kelly. This was Grace Kelly's second picture -- she gets fifth billing. She had made her film debut the year before in a psychological study called &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot;, which evidently is not available for home viewing. (As I recall, a distraught Richard Basehart is threatening to jump from a high building ledge, unaware of how he is affecting other lives, including that of Grace Kelly's character, a young socialite seeking a divorce at her lawyer's office in a nearby building.) In &quot;High Noon&quot;, once the ex-con and his gang enter town, the climax is succinct and surprisingly cynical.

Hornaday,"[1, 2]","Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly are spectacular in what is considered one of the best westerns ever made, but should be ranked as one of the greatest films ever produced because it easily transcends its genre.A morality play that was deliberately produced in stark black-and-white to heighten the mood, the story revolves around Cooper's character, the aging Marshal of Hadleyville who, when the film begins, weds Kelly's character. Cooper has retired and plans to return after his honeymoon as a store keeper because his wife is a Quaker and a pacifist. Plans immediately go awry, however, when it is discovered that a notorious killer whom Cooper had arrested and was expected to have been executed, was instead pardoned. The killer is expected to arrive back in town on the noon train to take revenge on Cooper. Three of his equally savage gang have already arrived and are waiting for him at the train station.The townspeople urge Cooper to flee with his new wife, but as he starts out of town, he stops, then returns, convinced that he has a responsibility to protect the town and bring the outlaws to justice. Pinning the marshal's badge back on, Cooper tries to deputize residents, but no one will help him and he is forced to stand alone. In powerful scenes, Cooper is forced to ask for help time-after-time but is turned down by residents who refuse to accept civic responsibility or acknowledge the debt they owe Cooper, rationalizing their decision not to act.Kelly doesn't understand her new husband and threatens to leave on the same noon train if he persists in remaining as the marshall this one last time. Kelly eventually begins to understand what drives Cooper but only after forming an unlikely friendship with his former girlfriend, who teaches Kelly about loyalty and character. Ironically, it is Kelly the pacifist who saves Cooper's life by picking up a .45 and killing one of the gunmen.In the last scene, the steets are utterly deserted until the gunmen are killed, then the townspeople, who had been hiding, flock around Cooper and Kelly. Without a word, Cooper removes his badge and drops it in the dirt. He and Kelly leave together.Throughout the movie, the stirring music and the real-time focus of the minutes ticking by until High Noon, serve to increase the movie's tension. The film combines elements of love, trust, duty, honor and courage in unexpected ways that are both thought-provoking and entertaining.

It is fascinating.Without Gary Cooper, I don't believe this film could or would have been made.  It required an actor who was an ambivert - not totally introverted or he could not have portrayed the role, but not totally extroverted either, or we would not have the nuances of an inner life which shown through Cooper's performance.  His was the academy award that year, and it was wholly deserved.If you haven't seen this film, don't hesitate.

40673,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0782008348,"""flickjunkie""","[67, 71]","""High Noon"" is frequently mentioned among the best Westerns and even among the best films ever made.  It is rated #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 of the 20th century.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including best actor for Gary Cooper, best song and best editing.  But, was it really that good?  After all, it was a bare bones black and white Western in an age of Technicolor spectaculars.It was that good and more.  ""High Noon"" was not really a Western as the genre had been defined to that point.  It was more of a character study of the human condition.  It just happened to be set in the American West.  Westerns at that time were action films with white hats and black hats.  There were fistfights and gunfights throughout the entire film.  They clearly differentiated good guys, on the side of justice and righteousness, from bad guys who spurned laws and sneered at those who obeyed them.  The heroes were always noble and fearless, typified by actors like John Wayne and Roy Rogers.  Moreover, the good guys always stuck together, despite all odds, to prevail against the outlaws.""High Noon"" was the complete antithesis of this formula.  Kane is a flawed hero who is proud to a fault.  Although it is clear who the villain is, we never see him until the last ten minutes of the film.  The story is not about good and evil in the larger sense.  Instead, it is about conviction and integrity on a personal level.  Kane is portrayed as stubbornly putting his own feelings above the safety of the town.  He stands against everyone, willing to sacrifice his marriage, his friendships, his good name and his life for his honor and self-respect.  The biggest departure from the formula was his unabashed manifestations of fear.  This was unheard of for a Western hero.Controversy swirled around this film, released in 1952 amid the Red Scare and the McCarthy Era.  The fearful and selfish townspeople who turned their backs on Kane were seen to be allegorical of the movie industry that abandoned those who were blacklisted as communists.  Many in the industry saw it as smug slap in the face.  John Wayne called the film ""un-American"", preferring to think that Americans would always stick together to fight injustice, ignoring the reality of numerous branded actors who couldn't get work.  Stanley Kramer, in an interview forty years later, continued to deny that there was any hidden agenda.  He said it was a film about human nature, and the coincidental fact that there was such a striking parallel was just an indication that human nature doesn't change.The vanguard direction by Fred Zinnemann was nothing short of brilliant.  Zinnemann eschewed the Western formula and struck out in a completely different direction.  He chose black and white to give it a stark look.  The sky was overcast rather than sunny and blue.  The entire film was shot for only $700,000 (an extremely small sum even for 1952) almost completely on a studio lot.  This was the first Western, (and possibly the first film) to tell a story in real time (the story transpires in roughly the same amount of time as the length of the film).  The villainous Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) was known only through dialogue and he did not actually appear until the end of the film.  Zinnemann hung the pall of Miller ominously in the air like an evil spirit who was feared but unseen.  This made the villain bigger than life and added to the suspense.  Even when Miller finally arrived on the noon train, Zinnemann didn't let us see his face for a full two or three minutes, showing him strapping on his guns from behind and talking to his gang.  Finally, there was no action until the very end of the film.He uses two very effective techniques to build suspense.  The first is the use of clocks.  In the beginning of the film, they were small clocks in the background that had short pendulums that swung quickly.  As we got closer to noon, the clocks got bigger and the pendulums swung more slowly making them more menacing.  At noon, the clock took up the entire screen as we waited for the last tick and the train's whistle.The second technique was the repeated use of a static vista looking down the railroad tracks from ground level with no train.  This was a constant reminder that Frank was coming.  This created an extraordinary amount of tension.  Tinnemann's use of reaction shots and the editing by Harry Gerstad and Elmo Williams (who won an Oscar) were also brilliantly done.The use of music was also innovative.  Rather than a full orchestra pumping out heart pounding adventure music, we had a simple ballad featuring a harmonica and the voice of country great Tex Ritter.  This haunting tune emphasized the loneliness of Kane's situation.The acting was marvelous.  Gary Cooper is masterful as the tormented Marshall who stands against the entire town and his own fear to face down the Miller gang.  This film launched Grace Kelly's career.  She was not only shockingly beautiful but gave a fantastic performance as Kane's wife, who all but abandons him.  Lloyd Bridges also shines as the hotheaded deputy.  Other notables included Lon Chaney, Harry Morgan, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef.This film redefined an entire genre.  It has been called the quintessential Western, but that is too narrow in its praise.  It is quintessential filmmaking, a perfect 10.  It is required viewing for film buffs who appreciate the creative aspect of the art.  Besides that, it's great entertainment.",5,Masterful filmmaking,973382400,"11 5, 2000",2000,5517,"['High', 'Noon', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'best', 'Westerns', 'even', 'best', 'films', 'ever',

It tells a very simple story but it is in fact so powerful simply because of the hero it depicts. In its time it also served as a condemning allegory of the finger pointing going on in Hollywood. The film tells the story of Marshall Will Kane who is willing to face his foes even when no one else will help him. Gary Cooper plays the newlywed lawman who must flee town or face the killer coming on the noon train. He resolves to do just that despite the pleas of his loving wife. The sheriff scrambles against the clock to get help. However no one is brave enough to face the enemy with him. Even with the odds against him he faces them in a showdown. Cooper is outgunned but not outmatched and heroically prevails. This is film is so powerful because it is full of human emotions and it feels so real since the events unfold almost in real time.

This is because the themes are recurring and just as it was then, it is still the same now with regards human nature.  The parable of the Good Samaritan covers it and so does this wonderful classic film about the sins of omission being just as bad as sins of commission.  Is it okay to let a man go to his death because it is none of your business or is it just as good as if you had pulled the trigger yourself?  Here, Gary Cooper plays a very capable marshall who has managed to selflessly keep his town safe but when it comes to the marshall himself needing some help, the townspeople make up excuses to avoid putting themselves in danger when the marshall himself had been doing this on their behalf for years.  How often do we commit sins of omission ourselves by making excuses to not do the right thing?  This sad and sorry aspect of human nature was present in the parable of the good samaritan, this film and will probably continue to exist today and ever after.Cooper's performance is brilliant and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar for this film.  People confuse courage with having no fear which is a mistake.  Courage is doing the right thing especially when you are afraid and to do so the more afraid that you are, the more courageous you are.  To have no fear ever is not courage but insanity.  I especially love the part when Cooper admits to Bridges that he was afraid and yet continued to do the right thing.  There are lots of lessons here that we can all learn that are timeless and for this reason, this film will continue to be a classic and relevant for ages to come.The only problem is with the DVD; the special features consist of a good but not great documentary concerning the making of High Noon.  Although the sound has been THX mastered, the sound quality isn't noticeably much better and could have used a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround treatment or better.  The picture quality is not very good either with imperfections ala white spots and vertical lines every couple of seconds or so of footage.  Although I've seen worse picture quality on other dvds, you'd expect better for a classic film like this one.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-Ray, they will take advantage of the opportunity to properly restore the picture and improve the sound quality options.Great must-have movie in any film buff's library but you may want to wait for a much better restored version either in Blu-Ray or standard format.",3,Among the Top 5 Westerns of All Time!

40678,A2II64KQ6ESWRX,0782008348,Gary Cooper Fan,"[7, 10]","I can't believe people are giving this new dvd release bad ratings before it's release.  I have heard from several sources that this release will have the restored by Paramount from the original negative film version that has never been released in the states.  I have not seen this version but have read rave reviews on it's extremely clean and sharp look with perfect brightness and contrast.  This print was not allowed to be loaned out for the previous two releases and an inferior print was used. In addition, a friend of mine John Mulholland has done a 50 minute documentory on this movie and he is an expert on both Gary Cooper and High Noon, so it is worth an upgrade just for that.  Below is an excerpt from John on High Noon:""HIGH NOON was hailed upon its release in 1952 as an instant classic. It won several Academy Awards, including one for its legendary star, Gary Cooper. It was named the year's best picture by the New York Film Critics Society. And yet, even though it's high on the American Film Institute's 100 Best Films of the Century, HIGH NOON's respect has been hard won, indeed. Perhaps no other classic film has had such a rocky road as this ""simple little western.""Decried by influential auteurist critics and academics, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being untrue to the western genre - read anti-populist; for being ""middle-brow"" (whatever that might mean); for being social drama hiding behind the western genre - and muddled social drama, at that; for being the most un-American film ever made (courtesy of John Wayne), etc.However, 56 years after its release, HIGH NOON still powerfully resonates with audiences around the world. When Solidarity needed a universal image to promote democracy and the right to vote in Poland in 1987, they chose Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, a ballot in his hand rather than a gun. Conservatives and liberals both manage to cite HIGH NOON on the floor of Congress as a metaphor for their competing political ideals. Political cartoonists and headline writers inevitably use HIGH NOON as reference for countless crises. President Eisenhower cited High Noon as his favorite film, as have President Clinton and former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizuma.On one hand, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being a conservative, damaging portrait of arrogant male paternalism. On the other hand, HIGH NOON is praised for challenging entrenched notions of gender, for exploring masculine anxiety, masculinity as a construct. Feminist critics and academics are offering intriguing and complex new readings to HIGH NOON.Example: Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) is having her new husband, Marshall Will Kane (Cooper), quit his career, leave his town, leave his friends, marry outside his church, and open a store of her choosing (wearing, perhaps, an apron?). Does Will Kane take on the villains at noon as a final gasp of masculine protest, as a declaration of independence from his wife's control?Ernest Hemingway compared a story's meaning to an iceberg - like the iceberg, 7/8th of which lies hidden beneath the surface, 7/8th of a story's meaning lies beneath the surface.Carl Foreman's bare-to-the-bones script and Fred Zinnemann's equally spare direction are a perfect film correlative to Hemingway's iceberg theory. This taut, seemingly straightforward little suspense western is complex, multi-layered, and perhaps even more relevant today than when it opened 56 years ago.John Mulholland, writer/directorINSIDE HIGH NOON""",5,This dvd will be worth the upgrade,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,3476,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'new', 'dvd', 'release', 'bad', 'ratings', 'release', 'have', 'heard', 'several', 'sources', 'release', 'will', 'have', 'restored', 'Paramount', 'original', 'negative', 'film', 'version', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'states', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'version', 'have', 'read', 'rave', 'reviews', 'extremely', 'clean', 'sharp', 'look', 'perfect', 'brightness', 'contrast', 'print', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'loaned', 'out', 'previous', 'two', 'releases', 'inferior', 'print', 'was', 'used', 'addition', 'friend', 'mine', 'John', 'Mulholland', 'done', '50', 'minute', 'documentory', 'movie', 'expert', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'High', 'Noon', 'upgrade', 'just', 'Below', 'excerpt', 'John', 'High', 'Noon', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'was', 'hailed', 'release', '1952', 'instant', 'classic', 'won', 'several', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'one', 'legendary', 'star', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'named', 'year', 'best', 'picture', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Society', 'yet', 'even', 'high', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', '100', 'Best', 'Films', 'Century', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'respect', 'been', 'hard', 'won', 'indeed', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'classic', 'film', 'had', 'rocky', 'road', 'simple', 'little', 'western', 'Decried', 'influential', 'auteurist', 'critics', 'academics', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'been', 'attacked', 'being', 'untrue', 'western', 'genre', 'read', 'anti-populist', 'being', 'middle-brow', 'might', 'mean', 'being', 'social', 'drama', 'hiding', 'western', 'genre', 'muddled', 'social', 'drama', 'being', 'most', 'un-American', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'courtesy', 'John', 'Wayne', 'etc.However', '56', 'years', 'release', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'still', 'powerfully', 'audiences', 'world', 'When', 'Solidarity', 'needed', 'universal', 'image', 'promote', 'democracy', 'right', 'vote', 'Poland', '1987', 'chose', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'ballot', 'hand', 'rather', 'gun', 'Conservatives', 'liberals', 'manage', 'cite', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'floor', 'Congress', 'metaphor', 'competing', 'political', 'ideals', 'Political', 'cartoonists', 'headline', 'writers', 'inevitably', 'use', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'reference', 'countless', 'crises', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'cited', 'High', 'Noon', 'favorite', 'film', 'have', 'President', 'Clinton', 'former', 'Japanese', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Junichiro', 'Koizuma.On', 'one', 'hand', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'been', 'attacked', 'being', 'conservative', 'damaging', 'portrait', 'arrogant', 'male', 'paternalism', 'other', 'hand', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'praised', 'challenging', 'entrenched', 'notions', 'gender', 'exploring', 'masculine', 'anxiety', 'masculinity', 'construct', 'Feminist', 'critics', 'academics', 'are', 'offering', 'intriguing', 'complex', 'new', 'readings', 'HIGH', 'NOON.Example', 'Amy', 'Fowler', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'having', 'new', 'husband', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Cooper', 'quit', 'career', 'leave', 'town', 'leave', 'friends', 'marry', 'church', 'open', 'store', 'choosing', 'wearing', 'perhaps', 'apron', 'Does', 'Will', 'Kane', 'take', 'villains', 'noon', 'final', 'gasp', 'masculine', 'protest', 'declaration', 'independence', 'wife', 'control', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'compared', 'story', 'meaning', 'iceberg', 'iceberg', '7/8th', 'hidden', 'surface', '7/8th', 'story', 'meaning', 'surface.Carl', 'Foreman', 'bare-to-the-bones', 'script', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'equally', 'spare', 'direction', 'are', 'perfect', 'film', 'correlative', 'Hemingway', 'iceberg', 'theory', 'taut', 'seemingly', 'straightforward', 'little', 'suspense', 'western', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'when', 'opened', '56', 'years', 'ago.John', 'Mulholland', 'writer/directorINSIDE', 'HIGH', 'NOON']",N/A

In fact, I saw it six times and the house was packed at each showing.  Many powerful images have stayed in my head since then, and they are just as impressive today.  Recall that the ""controversy"" behind this classic was its timing at the height of McCarthy's Red scare; the writers and directors, their creativity stymied by myopic thinking and fears of the day, pulled quite a stunt; the hero Will Kane marches to a different drummer in the face of a skittish and conformist environment.  Politics aside, of course, this is just a rattling good movie.  It started a new trend, which in those days was referred to as the ""adult"" Western, which in turn meant it dealt with ideas, principles, real-world emotions, not just horses and guns.

Even its presentation style was a rule-breaker: starts with Tex Ritter droning ""Do Not Forsake Me O My Darlin'"" in the background, after which every Hollywood Western had to have a Western singer in the credits (unfortunately, it was usually a near-screaming, echo-chambered Frankie Lane with a blaring symphony orchestra backup! Good grief).  The 1952 masterpiece was followed by countless imitations -- and how many Eastwood movies feature High Noon-style confrontations ?  It's a landmark film so well done, it defies imitation.  The DVD print is quite good, but the ""digitized"" sound is awful, as usual (turn it off, play it in the original mono).  Catch the fight scene with Cooper and Bridges, and the scenes with skillful Katy Jurado and her competing suitors; it doesn't get any more real than this, and veteran director Zinnemann outdoes himself here.  Every performance is tight and right-on.  And note: the action occurs in real time.  You can synchronize your wrist watch to the brief glances at the clocks on the walls.  And dig that camera work; black and white was an art in those days, and has become a lost art since.  A stirring, original, and unique work in every way.

It stars Gary Cooper as the town Marshall and Grace Kelly as his new bride.The movie opens with the Marshall getting married and concomitantly the telegraph operator receiving an alarming telegraph.  The telegraph operator writes out the message, the Justice of the Peace reads the wedding ceremony.  Will the Marshall get married before the telegraph message can be delivered? The telegraph operator finishes and runs out the door toward town,.  ""He's moving pretty fast for a Sunday"" comments a bystander  The telegraph operator runs, the Justice of the Peace reads, will he make it?  Yes, they're pronounced Man and Wife.  Yeah!The telegraph operator burst into the room.  ""Marshal, Marshal, you have a telegram"" The Marshal reads that a murderer who he helped arrest just got pardoned.  Probably by a` Democrat Governor.  Remember Bill Clinton's pardons?  The murderer, Frank is expected on the noon train.  Close up of the clock, eighty-four minutes from now.  Meanwhile three of Frank's friends ride into town and wait for the noon train.  Pretty obvious what they're waiting for.  Meanwhile the townspeople try to bundle the Marshall and his bride out of town on a buckboard.  The Marshall makes it a ways out of town, then stops the buckboard and turns to his bride and says ""  I just can't do it""  I can't run away .  His bride, a Quaker, disagrees with him and wants him to run away.  When they get back to town.  His bride lays out an ultimatum.  Choose, either leave town or lose me,  The Marshall stays.For the next sixty minutes or so the Marshal has all his ""friends"" turn against him, one after the other.  Nobody is willing to help.  It looks like it `s going to be four against one, with the Marshall being the the one.  The suspense slowly builds until there is a mighty climax at the end.You'll just have to watch the movie to see how it ends.  It's worth it.Highly recommended for fans of the old fashion Western movie.Gunner  June,2007",5,"Don't forsake me Oh,my darling",1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,2073,"['Do', ""n't"", 'forsake', 'Oh', 'darlingHigh', 'Noon', 'DVD', 'High', 'Noon', '1952', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'Western', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'town', 'Marshall', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'new', 'bride.The', 'movie', 'Marshall', 'getting', 'married', 'concomitantly', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'receiving', 'alarming', 'telegraph', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'out', 'message', 'Justice', 'Peace', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'Will', 'Marshall', 'get', 'married', 'telegraph', 'message', 'can', 'be', 'delivered', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'finishes', 'out', 'door', 'town', 'moving', 'pretty', 'fast', 'Sunday', 'comments', 'bystander', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'Justice', 'Peace', 'reads', 'will', 'make', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'pronounced', 'Man', 'Wife', 'Yeah', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'burst', 'room', 'Marshal', 'Marshal', 'have', 'telegram', 'Marshal', 'murderer', 'who', 'helped', 'arrest', 'just', 'got', 'pardoned', 'Probably', 'Democrat', 'Governor', 'Remember', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'pardons', 'murderer', 'Frank', 'expected', 'noon', 'train', 'Close', 'clock', 'eighty-four', 'minutes', 'now', 'Meanwhile', 'three', 'Frank', 'friends', 'ride', 'town', 'wait', 'noon', 'train', 'Pretty', 'obvious', 'what', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'Meanwhile', 'townspeople', 'try', 'bundle', 'Marshall', 'bride', 'town', 'buckboard', 'Marshall', 'ways', 'town', 'then', 'buckboard', 'bride', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'bride', 'Quaker', 'run', 'away', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'town', 'bride', 'out', 'ultimatum', 'Choose', 'either', 'leave', 'town', 'lose', 'Marshall', 'next', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Marshal', 'friends', 'turn', 'one', 'other', 'Nobody', 'willing', 'help', 's', 'going', 'be', 'four', 'one', 'Marshall', 'being', 'one', 'suspense', 'slowly', 'builds', 'mighty', 'climax', 'end.You', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'worth', 'it.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'old', 'fashion', 'Western', 'movie.Gunner', 'June,2007']",N/A

40692,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,0782008348,H. Snyder,"[1, 1]","High Noon is an American classic that has stood the test of time. If you can accept or ignore the unlikely premise that the populace of a post-Civil War western town would cower at the approach of four thugs, the film is immensely enjoyable, packed with fine performances, skillful direction and artful photography. The fast-paced action is facilitated by the real-time presentation, wherein the entire storyline takes place in just the 85 minutes depicted on the screen. And then there's the music by Hollywood veteran Dimitri Tiomkin, one of the most spare and iconic movie scores of all time, and one of the most effective. The Academy Award winning score includes the song ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"", with lyrics by Ned Washington. This simple but haunting melody is sung by Tex Ritter, and recurs throughout the film.The Olive Films 2012 Blu-ray release of the 1952 movie offers a noticeable improvement in both video and audio as compared to the Republic Pictures DVD releases of 2001 and 2002. However, considering its niche-market price and its dearth of special features (just the Leonard Maltin making-of video and a theatrical trailer, and no subtitles) this release is only for those who really love the film, or do not yet have a DVD version. And if you do have the DVD hang on to it, because it has more special features than does the new Blu-ray.Gary Cooper won his second Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Town Marshal Will Kane, in a performance featuring many close-ups of his craggy and expressive face. The emotional impact of this film is enormous, concentrated by the black-and-white photography, compact running time, unobtrusive musical score, and consistently fine acting.

40695,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0782008348,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","That's a simple western film, just before the renaissance of the genre with Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone and a few others. It is a classic of that period (1952) and in a way a turning point. A criminal was caught and sent to prison because one marshal and the population of a township did what they had to do. The criminal should have hanged but some law from Washington changed the game and he only got five years of prison. Five years later he comes back to kill those who had tried to have him hanged. The town learns about it when they see three of his associates come for the noon train, and it is confirmed by telegraph that the criminal, a certain Miller, is on the train. The city has a little more than one hour to do what they can to solve the problem. The marshal had just gotten married thirteen minutes earlier and he was to leave on his honeymoon and he was no longer the marshal and a new marshal was arriving on the following day only, slightly too late. The marshal comes back to assume the situation. He tries to get six deputies and the only he gets are a family man with two kids (he volunteers because he is convinced many more are going to come and he will step back when he finds out no one else has volunteered), then a one-eyed saloon customer who does not realize he is not fit for it, and a fourteen year old boy who is definitely too young and untrained. All the others refuse and even ask him to leave for Miller to do nothing. His newly-wed wife leaves on the noon train, or at least gets on it, though she will get off at the last minute. The judge leaves as soon as he can. The mayor asks in church the marshal to leave, while the parson refuses to commit himself (thou shalt not kill). All his friends avoid him or just plain say no. Alone he is and alone he will have to deal with the four outlaws who are trying to kill him. He will of course succeed. the details of his simple strategy and opportunistic tactics are in the film and you will have to go check them. And the film reveals how cowardly people can be and how they consider law and order is not their problem but that of the professional they pay to take care of it. That's the only really positive point that is different from the standard vision of traditional older western films. It is not blind gunfights and it is not everyone against the criminal. It shows the psychology of people in a crisis situation is very often divided and their reflex is often to hide their heads in the sand or run to cover behind the first bush they can find, senior or junior, who cares, provided it is not a burning bush.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,A classic that survives time,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2709,"['simple', 'western', 'film', 'just', 'renaissance', 'genre', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'few', 'others', 'classic', 'period', '1952', 'way', 'turning', 'point', 'criminal', 'was', 'caught', 'sent', 'prison', 'one', 'marshal', 'population', 'township', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'criminal', 'should', 'have', 'hanged', 'law', 'Washington', 'changed', 'game', 'only', 'got', 'five', 'years', 'prison', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'back', 'kill', 'who', 'had', 'tried', 'have', 'hanged', 'town', 'when', 'see', 'three', 'associates', 'come', 'noon', 'train', 'confirmed', 'telegraph', 'criminal', 'certain', 'Miller', 'train', 'city', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'hour', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'solve', 'problem', 'marshal', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'married', 'thirteen', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'was', 'leave', 'honeymoon', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'marshal', 'new', 'marshal', 'was', 'arriving', 'following', 'day', 'only', 'slightly', 'too', 'late', 'marshal', 'back', 'assume', 'situation', 'get', 'six', 'deputies', 'only', 'are', 'family', 'man', 'two', 'kids', 'convinced', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'will', 'step', 'back', 'when', 'out', 'one', 'else', 'volunteered', 'then', 'one-eyed', 'saloon', 'customer', 'who', 'not', 'realize', 'not', 'fit', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'definitely', 'too', 'young', 'untrained', 'others', 'refuse', 'even', 'ask', 'leave', 'Miller', 'do', 'nothing', 'newly-wed', 'wife', 'noon', 'train', 'least', 'will', 'get', 'off', 'last', 'minute', 'judge', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'mayor', 'church', 'marshal', 'leave', 'parson', 'commit', 'thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'kill', 'friends', 'avoid', 'just', 'plain', 'say', 'Alone', 'alone', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'four', 'outlaws', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'will', 'course', 'succeed', 'details', 'simple', 'strategy', 'opportunistic', 'tactics', 'are', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'check', 'film', 'how', 'cowardly', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'consider', 'law', 'order', 'not', 'problem', 'professional', 'pay', 'take', 'care', 'only', 'really', 'positive', 'point', 'different', 'standard', 'vision', 'traditional', 'older', 'western', 'films', 'not', 'blind', 'gunfights', 'not', 'everyone', 'criminal', 'psychology', 'people', 'crisis', 'situation', 'very', 'often', 'divided', 'reflex', 'often', 'hide', 'heads', 'sand', 'run', 'cover', 'first', 'bush', 'can', 'find', 'senior', 'junior', 'who', 'provided', 'not', 'burning', 'bush.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

Adams ""History buff""","[13, 57]","When commie Carl Foreman wrote this, he was following in the footsteps of his fellow Communists in blurring, blending, twisting and ultimately distorting the age old story of good vs. evil. Many of the reviews of this movie over the decades have said that this movie was a way for Foreman to portray himself vicariously as Cooper in standing up for what is right when he lied before the House Un-American Committee about his Communist ties. His testimony occurred long before Senator Joe McCarthy showed up, but this film is somehow an attack on ""McCarthyism"" and McCarthy, who never served in the House of Representatives or on HUAC. It is a classic example of how the communists were so successful in infiltrating the US opinion makers. The recent revelations of the KGB have shown that McCarthy was essentially correct, and that Communists in the USA took their orders from Moscow during the Cold War.The good part of the movie is that the USA has historically had men and women who have stood up for what is morally right. The bad part of this movie is that the extraordinary country that the USA is had been co-opted in many ways by a very smart and very smarmy Communist like Foreman, who steals the ideal, and like the rat that he was, contaminates it to make it something closer to his goal of using good motives for evil purposes. Try to find a movie that exposes the fact that Stalin murdered millions more than Hitler in his evil program to advance communism. You won't find one because the ethos of Hollywood is still steeped in the tradition of supporting communism as these multi-millionaires have their chauffeurs drive them to the studio from their seaside mansions in Malibu or Beverly Hills.Cooper is great in this movie, but it is defiled by the legacy that its author was yet another commie agent who viewed the masses as stupid and easily subject to manipulation. Kind of like a Cold War Moore.

That such a dark, bleakly cynical movie should remain so popular is at first thought surprising. Of course, there are  obvious reasons why this is so. It is a terrifically tense story. Has  involving characters, tight script, splendid direction, wonderful editing,  cinematography, soundtrack, and a towering performance from Cooper (and not  due to his suffering with an ulcer while it was filming, as some would have  you believe). But it is reaching new audiences, especially women. Indeed,  it is being taught in many feminist courses in college. And the feminist  approach to Cooper and his dilemma and his reaction to it is very  intriguing. Here's a man who is the king of the town, the toughest man  around, lord of his realm. However, he meets a younger woman, falls in love  and marries her. Then comes word that four men are coming on the noon  train, and very likely are coming with one purpose, to kill him. His wife  wants him to leave and they start out. But he stops and says he can't  leave: &quot;They're making me run and I've never run from anyone  before.&quot; Back they go to town. Everytime he is asked why he isn't  leaving, his only response is: &quot;I don't know.&quot; The feminist take  on this makes perfect sense: Here's the lord of his realm newly married,  and his wife has him quitting his job, leaving his town, his friends, and  moving to a town of her choice, where he will open a store (her choice) and  help her run it (her choice). He is no longer his man, he is her man. By  staying and facing his would-be killers, this man is rebelling, making a  last-ditch stand to preserve his &quot;masculinity&quot;, to show himself  and others -- and his wife! -- that he is still in control. This adds a  rich new dimension to every situation and character conflict throughout the  film. Watch it from this perspective and you'll see an entirely new film.  Entirely new and still one of the grand all-time classics. Interesting  sidebar: During the filming, Cooper became friendly with writer Carl  Foreman. They agreed to form a company, Cooper would star, Foreman write,  Stanley Kramer produce. But John Wayne, Ward Bond and others wanted Foreman  blacklisted. They put pressure on Cooper and director Fred Zinneman to  quit, or their careers would be ruined. Cooper and Zinneman refused,  sticking by Foreman. When liberal Kramer caved in, Cooper threatened to  walk, which meant there'd be no film, since it was an independent  production, and a Salinas lettuce grower had invested only if Cooper would  star. Eventually, Wayne and the others got their way and Foreman was  blacklisted. Kramer backed out of the company. Cooper offered to go public  with Foreman about the company, even offered to go to Washington to testify  on Foreman's behalf before the House Un-American Activities Committee (this  from a man who was a deservedly awkward and embarrassed friendly witness in  1947, even though he named no names and said he wanted no-one hurt). But  Foreman finally threw in the towel, was blacklisted, and moved to London.  But ever after, he always said that Cooper was the only &quot;big one&quot;  who stood by him. He also sent to Cooper for first consideration all of his  scripts after this, including: BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, THE KEY and GUNS  OF NAVARONE. John Wayne's despicable role in the Hollywood blacklist is  something which is rarely talked about.

Mr Kane will now retire as a marshall, and head to a new and peaceful life. Or will he? At the telegraph station the postmaster gets a cable stating that a dangerous bandit (Frank Miller) will arrive in the twelve o'clock train. At the train depot, three of Miller's gunmen are wating for him. When he arrives, they will seek revenge against the one man that tried, unsuccessfully, to convict Miller of a capital crime: Mr Kane himself.During these 90 minutes, Gary Cooper will try to get help from the local population, old friends, and a man who wants to be the next sheriff (Lloyd Bridges). But it will not be an easy task. Add to that the fact that his brand new wife abhorres violence, and threatens to leave him less than two hours after the marriage - in fact she says she'll leave in the train that brings the outlaw Miller to town.People think this is a western classic. Wrong. ""High noon"" is surely a classic, but not a western. It only happens to be set in the old west. To say the truth,  ""High noon"" is more like a thriller with a Hitchcockian feeling to it. The western setting (violence, lack of respect for the laws, gunfights, dry and sun-scorched landscape, etc.) is present to add to the mounting tension and suspense that grow with each shot depicting the face of a clock and the relentless passage of time towards noon and the train arrival.What makes this movie great is the seemingly dead-end situation, the great dialogues, and very good acting by Gary Cooper (which earned him an Oscar, when the Academy Awards were not given for political reasons), Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, among others (and Lee Van Cleef, the infamous ""Angel Eyes"" from ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" - he doesn't say a word, but those eyes are surely creepy).I will not give ""High noon"" five stars because I felt the script could be a little more developed. The ending is too rushed and kind of unsatisfying. But this is an excellent movie nonetheless.

40724,A1KT1GWCW8F80,0782008348,K. Gittins,"[3, 5]","""High Noon"" is the classic western movie about a marshall facing down four badmen alone after the townsmen refuse to help him. Although it has a western setting, it could have easily been most any other locale because the psychological and social aspects are the important themes, not the old West, or riding horses. Made during the time of McCarthy and the Communist witch hunt, many have read political undertones into the movie.A seemingly unusual cast includes Gary Cooper (""Sergeant York"", ""Pride of the Yankees"") as the good-guy out-going marshall, Grace Kelly (""Rear Window"") as his new wife, Lloyd Bridges (""Sea Hunt"", ""Airplane"") as the deputy, Lee Van Cleef (the ""bad"" of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"") as one silent badguy, Lon Chaney (""The Wolfman""), and Henry Morgan (""MASH"").The movie proceeds in nearly real time - it starts about 10:30 AM and ends shortly after noon - and clocks are increasingly prominent in nearly every scene. The leader of the badmen, Frank Miller, who was sent to prison by the marshall under a death sentence but was released, is now coming to town on the noon train to kill marshall Kane. Three of his friends are waiting at the station to greet and assist him in killing the marshall. That same morning, Kane is getting married to a violence-abhoring Quaker woman and is going to give up being marshall because of it. After learning Frank Miller is coming to town, the wife convinces Kane to essentially skip town and they leave, but the marshall gets his sense of duty back and returns to town. He and his wife argue, and she is determined to leave on the noon train. The judge also packs his things and leaves town. The marshall's deputy also quits. Kane goes around town trying to organize a posse, but only one capable man volunteers (the other is a one-eyed drunk) but he subsequently backs out.Kane is forced to face the men alone. I won't spoil the ending.At a time when movies (even bad ones) were being made in color, ""High Noon"" was shot in black-and-white, trying to get an unglamorous look to it modeled after Matthew Brady's photographs of the civil war, and succeeds. There is no beautiful sky and clouds, or cactus and sunsets. It is great cinematography however. Oscars for Best Actor, Editing, Song and Score.Reasonably-priced DVD picture and sound are good. It has an average commentary by daughter of actor, son of singer, son of writer and son of director. Also has a short documentary, a fair behind-the-scenes, and a 5-plus minute radio interview with singer Tex Ritter.",4,High time for High Noon,1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,2537,"['High', 'Noon', 'classic', 'western', 'movie', 'marshall', 'facing', 'down', 'four', 'badmen', 'alone', 'townsmen', 'refuse', 'help', 'western', 'setting', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'most', 'other', 'locale', 'psychological', 'social', 'aspects', 'are', 'important', 'themes', 'not', 'old', 'West', 'riding', 'horses', 'Made', 'time', 'McCarthy', 'Communist', 'witch', 'hunt', 'many', 'have', 'read', 'political', 'undertones', 'movie.A', 'seemingly', 'unusual', 'cast', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'good-guy', 'out-going', 'marshall', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Rear', 'Window', 'new', 'wife', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'Airplane', 'deputy', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'bad', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'one', 'silent', 'badguy', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Wolfman', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'MASH', '.The', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'nearly', 'real', 'time', '10:30', 'AM', 'shortly', 'noon', 'clocks', 'are', 'increasingly', 'prominent', 'nearly', 'scene', 'leader', 'badmen', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'prison', 'marshall', 'death', 'sentence', 'was', 'released', 'now', 'coming', 'town', 'noon', 'train', 'kill', 'Kane', 'Three', 'friends', 'are', 'waiting', 'station', 'greet', 'assist', 'killing', 'marshall', 'same', 'morning', 'Kane', 'getting', 'married', 'violence-abhoring', 'Quaker', 'woman', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'marshall', 'learning', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'coming', 'town', 'wife', 'convinces', 'Kane', 'essentially', 'skip', 'town', 'leave', 'marshall', 'sense', 'duty', 'back', 'returns', 'town', 'wife', 'argue', 'determined', 'leave', 'noon', 'train', 'judge', 'also', 'things', 'town', 'marshall', 'deputy', 'also', 'Kane', 'around', 'town', 'trying', 'organize', 'posse', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'man', 'volunteers', 'other', 'one-eyed', 'drunk', 'subsequently', 'out.Kane', 'forced', 'face', 'men', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending.At', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'color', 'High', 'Noon', 'was', 'shot', 'black-and-white', 'trying', 'get', 'unglamorous', 'look', 'modeled', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'photographs', 'civil', 'war', 'beautiful', 'sky', 'clouds', 'cactus', 'sunsets', 'great', 'cinematography', 'however', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Editing', 'Song', 'Score.Reasonably-priced', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'good', 'average', 'commentary', 'daughter', 'actor', 'son', 'singer', 'son', 'writer', 'son', 'director', 'Also', 'short', 'documentary', 'fair', 'behind-the-scenes', '5-plus', 'minute', 'radio', 'interview', 'singer', 'Tex', 'Ritter']",N/A

40728,A2UMMUAS16L4DX,0782008348,Laurence Levine,"[1, 1]","We are dealing with a town that was run by the Frank Miller gang.  Despite murders and lawlessness, certain unsavory elements preferred Miller to Kane who with the help of several deputies, cleaned up the town.  As Marshal, Kane was disliked by many (some who preferred Miller).  The movie opens with Frank Miller, who had been condemned to death - being pardoned and the four main members of the gang going after Kane.  Afterward, they would presumably run the town.  (SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)  Kane and his newlywed wife are sent out of town to protect them.  Kane speculates that even if they evade Miller, somehow Miller will find him wherever he goes.  He figures that he can get deputies and track down the four.  His wife wonders why he is making it his fight rather than letting others deal with Miller.  The new marshal is due the next day.  Those who want Miller stopped don't want to fight the gang of four.  No one realizes that once you have enough people, there will be no fight.  The deputy is willing to fight if Kane puts in a good word for him.  Kane believes he is too immature.  If had had agreed, there would have been at least three people.  Some of the towns people believe that stopping Miller through a gunfight will make the town less hospitable to investors.  Illogic galore.  Those who won't deal with Miller will be conquered by him.  At the end, it is Kane alone against the others.  Earlier he refused to arrest the three others because that would be unlawful, even though he dooms the town.  What if the others were put in jail and Miller too?  Probably they would talk about their plans and could be put in jail.  In any event we see a whole town where the anti-Miller side is afraid of FOUR men.  Many looked for twelve men to go after Miller's four.  A  town full of cowards and idiots.  Kane's inability to work with people made it impossible for him to win converts.  Matt Dillon, he is not.Even so it is a strangely compelling top movie.",5,five stars despite lack of logic,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1971,"['are', 'dealing', 'town', 'was', 'run', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'gang', 'murders', 'lawlessness', 'certain', 'unsavory', 'elements', 'preferred', 'Miller', 'Kane', 'who', 'help', 'several', 'deputies', 'cleaned', 'up', 'town', 'Marshal', 'Kane', 'was', 'disliked', 'many', 'who', 'preferred', 'Miller', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'condemned', 'death', 'being', 'pardoned', 'four', 'main', 'members', 'gang', 'going', 'Kane', 'Afterward', 'would', 'presumably', 'run', 'town', 'SPOILERS', 'THROUGHOUT', 'Kane', 'newlywed', 'wife', 'are', 'sent', 'town', 'protect', 'Kane', 'even', 'evade', 'Miller', 'somehow', 'Miller', 'will', 'find', 'wherever', 'can', 'get', 'deputies', 'track', 'down', 'four', 'wife', 'wonders', 'why', 'making', 'fight', 'rather', 'letting', 'others', 'deal', 'Miller', 'new', 'marshal', 'due', 'next', 'day', 'who', 'want', 'Miller', 'stopped', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'gang', 'four', 'one', 'once', 'have', 'enough', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'fight', 'deputy', 'willing', 'fight', 'Kane', 'good', 'word', 'Kane', 'too', 'immature', 'had', 'had', 'agreed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'three', 'people', 'towns', 'people', 'believe', 'stopping', 'Miller', 'gunfight', 'will', 'make', 'town', 'less', 'hospitable', 'investors', 'Illogic', 'galore', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deal', 'Miller', 'will', 'be', 'conquered', 'end', 'Kane', 'alone', 'others', 'Earlier', 'refused', 'arrest', 'three', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'unlawful', 'even', 'town', 'What', 'others', 'were', 'put', 'jail', 'Miller', 'too', 'Probably', 'would', 'talk', 'plans', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'jail', 'event', 'see', 'whole', 'town', 'where', 'anti-Miller', 'side', 'afraid', 'FOUR', 'men', 'Many', 'looked', 'twelve', 'men', 'go', 'Miller', 'four', 'town', 'full', 'cowards', 'idiots', 'Kane', 'inability', 'work', 'people', 'made', 'impossible', 'win', 'converts', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'not.Even', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'top', 'movie']",N/A
40729,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0782008348,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""High Noon"" is the film that has been screened most often at the White House for the President of the United States.  Given that this is the story of a man who stands up to considerable opposition to do the right thing, even when he is abandoned by everyone who should be rushing to his side, the idea that this is a perennial Presidential favorite is rather reassuring (as opposed to the legend of Richard Nixon watching ""Patton"" before deciding to invade Cambodia).  You can imagine that ""High Noon"" has been screened at the White House once or twice in the last three years.Regardless of any impact on America's political and military history, ""High Noon"" is a seminal film in the genre of Western movies.  Until 1952 Hollywood was producing what we would know call the traditional western, where the good guy in the white hat defeats the bad guy in the black hat.  In this format we not only followed the adventures of the Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, and Hopalopng Cassidy, but we also knew the names of their horses (Silver, Trigger, and Topper, respectively).  However, with ""High Noon"" (and ""Shane"" the following year), we had the creation of the Adult Western, which introduced the notion of moral doubt and had a hero that was going to end up kissing a woman rather than his horse.  In these westerns the hero remains the moral leader of the community, but now he can make mistakes, although they are rarely fatal errors.  Ironically, the hero's flawed character actually makes him even more heroic, because he has to struggle against himself as well as against the bad guys.Director Fred Zinnemann's film contains the same elements as the Traditional Western, but with significant differences.  Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is the moral lawman who protects the town of Hadleyville, but he is about to marry Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who insists that he give up his job as the marshal of his western town.  There is the big gunfight with the bad guys, but it takes place at the climax of the film.  Except for one brief fistfight, this is much more of a psychological drama than an action film until the final scene.  But the suspense of the film, especially as the clock is ticking down to twelve, becomes quite intense, helped by Elmo Williams' editing.  There is a sense in which the final gunfight is almost anti-climatic, because whether Will Kane lives or dies he has made his main point. But the gunfight is also subversively different, because it is not played out in the main street of town but in the barns and back alleys, more like guerilla warfare than the traditional mano-e-mano contest.Less than two hours after the wedding, convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is arriving on the noon train.  Miller is coming to town to kill Kane, the man who sent him to prison, and a trio of his henchmen are waiting for their boss at the station.  Everyone in town, the mayor (Thomas Mitchell), the judge (Otto Kurger), and even the former marshal (Lon Chaney), all want Kane to run away.  His deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him and even when Kane goes to a church to ask for help he is turned down.  His new wife will leave him and he will have to stand by himself against Miller and his gang, but Kane cannot run away.  The quintessential camera shot in ""High Noon"" is when Kane is standing alone in the street.  Cinematographer Floyd Crosby (who had won an Oscar in 1931 for ""Tabu""), begins with a close up of Kane, sweat streaming down his face, and his hand shaking; then the camera pulls back on a crane shot to show the marshal standing all alone in the deserted street of his town.Cooper deservedly won his second Oscar for this role and the fact that it Gary Cooper that was up there on the silver screen showing that he was afraid made all the difference in the world.  Will Kane was afraid, but he went ahead and did his job.  For audiences raised on westerns up to that time it was a shocking idea, although those who had fought in World War II could probably identify with the notion.  ""High Noon"" redefines the notion of heroism in an important way.  A man can be afraid, and still act bravely.  It is, in simple terms, a more adult conception of heroism.  This movie is also the ""24"" of its time, taking place pretty much in real time.  The wedding happens after 10 and all the clocks we see throughout the film ticking down to noon are in the ballpark, although I admit I have never timed them.  This is just a landmark film on so many levels.  For example, ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh, My Darlin'"" was the first song from a non-musical film to ever win the Oscar for Best Original Song.There are lots of stories that have sprung up about ""High Noon.""  There are those who read ""High Noon"" as an allegory regarding those who stood up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era and refused to cooperate with their blacklisting efforts.  Screenwriter Carl Foreman, cinematographer Floyd Crosby, and actor Lloyd Bridges were all blacklisted shortly after this film came out, which gives credence to the allegory idea although it would constitute more of a prediction.  Then there is the story that John Wayne declared the film to be ""Un-American,"" but then he picked up Cooper's Oscar for him at the Academy Awards the next year and apparently complained that he had not been offered the part (which actually had been offered to Gregory Peck first).  I am not sure that Wayne could have pulled it off, though it would have been interesting to see him try.  Jimmy Stewart did a similar role opposite the Duke in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.""",5,The classical film that was the first Adult Western,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,5606,"['High', 'Noon',

40730,A2K97HCY2OLW61,0782008348,Lee Buchenau,"[5, 7]","The film is hands down my favorite western and features many of the genre conventions, but also brings many progressive sensibilities to the genre. It is primarily a psychological western, not the shoot um ups that reigned in the past. What makes high noon such a masterpiece is the incredible perfection of its craft. It is truly one of the most tightly constructed films ever made. Not a single frame is wasted in the telling of its story and its conveying of mood. The film should be mandatory viewing for budding filmmakers, so they can learn the importance of lean, fat free editing. Kurosawa said he only shot footage so he could edit and high noon is truly a brilliant example of the power of concise editing. Many films today love to draw out their endings with multiple resolutions, high noon proves the power of speed and simplicity in its powerful closing scene.The high noon dvd is presented in full frame format since the film was not shot in widescreen. Picture is amazing for a film that is over 50 years old. Contrast and sharpness are gorgeous and the print is one of the best of a film of this age. Sharpness is truly stunning. Shimmering and flicker is present on some objects and there are occasional tiny spots on the image. The spots were so small and infrequent i didn't even notice them ever until a second viewing. Shimmering on trees is present quite a bit especially if you have a cheaper dvd player. These are minor points, because i was stunned at the beauty of the tranfer.Sound is presented in regular and enchanced audio. Regular sometimes has cooper's dialogue a little low. Enchanced has more kick, but they may have toyed with the original mix. A commentary is including with relatives of the cast and crew. I didn't listen to all of it, it is presented in a group conversational manner.Extras are interesting with a informative leonard maltin backstory on the film. I'm not a maltin fan and find his narration annoying, but he points out intriguing notes on the film's production. The best part is oncamera interviews from several years ago with zinneman and other real cast/crew member. Zinneman tells a great story about how the train ran over the camera when they were shooting the railroad track shots. Also another weird note is that the cinematography floyd crosby is david crosby's father! David is interviewed about his dad's work. A new series of interviews are collected with the surviving children of the cast/crew in the &quot;behind&quot; doc. Cooper's daughter is very obviously reading a teleprompt and i quit watching at that point.

40734,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0782008348,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 19]","This 1952 western is a classic.  It earned Gary Cooper and academy award and also won for best film editing, best song and best musical score. I was very young when I first saw it and I remember being impressed.  And I don't think I can ever forget the song. Now, fifty years later, it's time to revisit it.Well, one thing is clear.  I still love the song.  And it's no wonder that it's so memorable.  It's performed over and over throughout the film.  The words tell the whole story, simply and completely. The melody is haunting and a perfect background for the story, which also seems simple but deals with big themes - the struggle between good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, courage and cowardice and what it is to be a man.Gary Cooper is cast in the role of the Sheriff, who has just wed his bride, Grace Kelly, and is giving up his badge because she is a Quaker.  He's been a good sheriff, brought peace and prosperity to the town.  But now, a man he had sent to jail five years previously has been pardoned instead of being hanged and has sworn to kill the sheriff.  Now he's coming back to town on the noon train. There's tension in the air, especially since three of the killer's outlaw friends have just ridden into town. The film is shot in real time, as the audience experiences the ticking of the clock as the big hands move towards the inevitable showdown.Of course there are complications.  Grace Kelly refuses to support her new husband and buys a ticket on the train out of town.  A young hotshot deputy, Lloyd Bridges, who is romancing Cooper's former girlfriend, brilliantly played by Katy Jurado, gets into a fistfight with him. But mostly, it's the townspeople who turn away from him in his hour of need and most of the film consists of Cooper going from barroom to church trying to enlist a posse to help him.  Everyone turns their backs on him.  And when the showdown comes he's all alone.  It's a brilliant performance as we see the disappointment on his face over and over again and his expression of determination to stand tall and refuse to run away.  Cooper was 51 years old at the time and shows every bit of it.  There are lines in his face, bags under his eyes and looseness to his flesh. It's a refreshing reality in these days of plastic surgical perfection.  Grace Kelly, who was 23 at the time, is pretty but her performance rather stiff.  This was her first big role though and brought her the attention she needed as she established her career.I felt the tension as the clock ticked away, enjoyed the clarity of the story.  I, too, counted the minutes till the whistle of the train and the bad guy stepped off.  However, at that point I fell asleep and when I awoke the film had just ended.  I was annoyed with myself.  But I glad this was a video and I could re-wind and watch it again.  And so I did, forcing myself to stay awake.  I then realized that it wasn't just because I was sleepy that I fell asleep.  The actual showdown was boring to me.  Fifty years of watching movies since then has spoiled me.  I just can't feel tension in this kind of gun battle in which the conclusion is evident.  This of course is not the fault of the film.  In the context of its time, it must have been great.  And it still holds up as a classic and that's why I give it an unqualified recommendation.  It's just a little hard to go back into a 1952 mindset.",4,"Recommended, but it's hard to go back to a 1952 mindset",1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,3386,"['1952', 'western', 'classic', 'earned', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'academy', 'award', 'also', 'won', 'best', 'film', 'editing', 'best', 'song', 'best', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'remember', 'being', 'impressed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'ever', 'forget', 'song', 'Now', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'revisit', 'it.Well', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', 'still', 'love', 'song', 'wonder', 'so', 'memorable', 'performed', 'film', 'words', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'simply', 'completely', 'melody', 'haunting', 'perfect', 'background', 'story', 'also', 'simple', 'deals', 'big', 'themes', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'courage', 'cowardice', 'what', 'be', 'man.Gary', 'Cooper', 'cast', 'role', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'just', 'wed', 'bride', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'giving', 'up', 'badge', 'Quaker', 'been', 'good', 'sheriff', 'brought', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'town', 'now', 'man', 'had', 'sent', 'jail', 'five', 'years', 'previously', 'been', 'pardoned', 'instead', 'being', 'hanged', 'sworn', 'kill', 'sheriff', 'Now', 'coming', 'back', 'town', 'noon', 'train', 'tension', 'air', 'especially', 'three', 'killer', 'outlaw', 'friends', 'have', 'just', 'ridden', 'town', 'film', 'shot', 'real', 'time', 'audience', 'ticking', 'clock', 'big', 'hands', 'move', 'inevitable', 'showdown.Of', 'course', 'are', 'complications', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'support', 'new', 'husband', 'ticket', 'train', 'town', 'young', 'hotshot', 'deputy', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'who', 'romancing', 'Cooper', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'fistfight', 'mostly', 'townspeople', 'who', 'turn', 'away', 'hour', 'need', 'most', 'film', 'Cooper', 'going', 'barroom', 'church', 'trying', 'enlist', 'posse', 'help', 'Everyone', 'backs', 'when', 'showdown', 'alone', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'see', 'disappointment', 'face', 'over', 'again', 'expression', 'determination', 'stand', 'tall', 'refuse', 'run', 'away', 'Cooper', 'was', '51', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'bit', 'are', 'lines', 'face', 'bags', 'eyes', 'looseness', 'flesh', 'refreshing', 'reality', 'days', 'plastic', 'surgical', 'perfection', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'who', 'was', '23', 'time', 'pretty', 'performance', 'rather', 'stiff', 'was', 'first', 'big', 'role', 'brought', 'attention', 'needed', 'established', 'career.I', 'felt', 'tension', 'clock', 'ticked', 'away', 'enjoyed', 'clarity', 'story', 'too', 'counted', 'minutes', 'till', 'whistle', 'train', 'bad', 'guy', 'stepped', 'off', 'However', 'point', 'fell', 'asleep', 'when', 'awoke', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'ended', 'was', 'annoyed', 'glad', 'was', 'video', 'could', 're-wind', 'watch', 'again', 'so', 'did', 'forcing', 'stay', 'awake', 'then', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'was', 'sleepy', 'fell', 'asleep', 'actual', 'showdown', 'was', 'boring', 'Fifty', 'years', 'watching', 'movies', 'then', 'spoiled', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tension', 'kind', 'gun', 'battle', 'conclusion', 'evident', 'course', 'not', 'fault', 'film', 'context', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'still', 'up', 'classic', 'why', 'give', 'unqualified', 'recommendation', 'just', 'little', 'hard', 'go', 'back', '1952', 'mindset']",N/A

This movie was Gary Cooper's finest effort and as a man in trouble, he was totally believable and totally real. But I have to take John Wayne's perception on this movie and states that its not as great as the hype made it up to be. Cooper played a sherriff of this town who is awaiting recently released gunmen from prison. They are professional gunsligners and Cooper's character wanted amatuer townsmen to aid him. Professional killers needs professional lawmen to deal with, Cooper is that man and the burden fall on him. His effort to induced untrained townsmen who are not fit to support him into this situation sounds pretty weak and perhaps in the western mode...unmanly. His new wife played by Grace Kelly only further do damage by trying to make a coward out of a man she married. She failed to see that if she secceded, she would have ruin the man she love by making him what he wasn't. But despite of his doubts, fears and lack of support, Cooper's character does his job effectively and with honor. Maybe it is a great western after all.Unlike many reviewers before me, I take a very different view of this film. Many believed that Gary Cooper is some sort of victim forced into a confrontation against all odds. I see it differently. Many western fans often compared this with Rio Bravo where the sherriff refused help from town's people he believes to be unfit to do the job, thus keeping them from harm's way - which is his job as well as the job of Will Kane.",4,Cooper's greatest role but is this is a good story?,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1654,"['enjoyed', 'High', 'Noon', 'quite', 'bit', 'desire', 'do', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'others', 'who', 'wrote', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'finest', 'effort', 'man', 'trouble', 'was', 'totally', 'believable', 'totally', 'real', 'have', 'take', 'John', 'Wayne', 'perception', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'hype', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'Cooper', 'played', 'sherriff', 'town', 'who', 'awaiting', 'recently', 'released', 'gunmen', 'prison', 'are', 'professional', 'gunsligners', 'Cooper', 'character', 'wanted', 'amatuer', 'townsmen', 'aid', 'Professional', 'killers', 'professional', 'lawmen', 'deal', 'Cooper', 'man', 'burden', 'fall', 'effort', 'induced', 'untrained', 'townsmen', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fit', 'support', 'situation', 'pretty', 'weak', 'perhaps', 'western', 'mode', 'unmanly', 'new', 'wife', 'played', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'only', 'further', 'do', 'damage', 'trying', 'make', 'coward', 'man', 'married', 'failed', 'see', 'secceded', 'would', 'have', 'ruin', 'man', 'making', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'doubts', 'fears', 'lack', 'support', 'Cooper', 'character', 'job', 'effectively', 'honor', 'Maybe', 'great', 'western', 'many', 'reviewers', 'take', 'very', 'different', 'view', 'film', 'Many', 'believed', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'sort', 'victim', 'forced', 'confrontation', 'odds', 'see', 'differently', 'Many', 'western', 'fans', 'often', 'compared', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'where', 'sherriff', 'refused', 'help', 'town', 'people', 'be', 'unfit', 'do', 'job', 'thus', 'keeping', 'harm', 'way', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'job', 'Will', 'Kane']",N/A

Nominated for 7 Academy Awards and winner of 4. Also, AFI Top 100 of all time. Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just said his wedding vows with his new bride (Grace Kelly) and is about to turn in his badge as sheriff and leave the town he had singlehandedly cleaned up, with his pacifist Quaker wife. As they're about to ride out of town in their buckboard limo, three tough hombres ride into town and let it be known that Frank Miller is arriving on the noon train-it's now 10:40 AM. Will leaves but just out of town turns around and comes back.  He can't leave now.  He's responsible for arresting Frank Miller and sending him up to prison.  He was supposed to be executed but instead he's paroled and coming back to get even. Will believes he can round up a posse to defend the town during the next hour as the film progresses in real time. The plot is simple but the acting is terrific and the scenes are tight and tense as he tries to recruit help as well as keep his new bride. All this leads up to the showdown at HIGH NOON and the final, climactic scene-a great one. More than just a good western, there are some underlying themes of courage (and lack thereof) as well as the issue of pacificism and 'standing by your man'. This is the role that got Grace Kelly's career on track.  One interesting note-on Netflix there's a commentary on issues for parents to judge whether a film is suited for children and what age. Under the category of SOCIAL BEHAVIOR it says ""Women are exceptionally intelligent and respected"". Apparently that was not the norm for films back then. Everyone should see this at least once.

Many reviews of this movie may leave you with the impression that no one is willing to help the marshal meet the vengeful band of gunslingers, but there are a few - unfortunately for the marshal, none of them are suitable.You may also have the impression that Marshal Kane is fearless - not so.  Kane passes through two moments of weakness.  The first occurs when he learns, after turning in his badge after the wedding, that a dangerous criminal, who swore to get him, is arriving on the noon train.  At the urging of the wedding party, he and his new wife flee town in their buckboard, but Kane can't escape his sense of duty and returns to town.

40742,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,0782008348,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 8]","The House Committee on Un-Amewrican Activities (HUAC) was created in 1938 as a means to investigate people suspected of Communism and supporting Communism. Its first major attack was on the Hollywood film industry. Blacklisting of Hollywood writers, actors, producers, directors, and others suspected of Communist affiliations began with the committee's hearings in October 1947 and flourished throughout the 1950's, a period known as the Red Scare. Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted ""witch hunts"" in an attempt to find and eliminate suspected Communists. The Committee began its hearing with ""friendly witnesses"" who shared the opinions of the HUAC. Each witness provided answers the Committee wanted to hear in order to set the tone for later witnesses who might resist giving information. The ""unfriendly"" witnesses became known as The Hollywood Ten, who were cited for contempt of Congress and jailed for failure to cooperate with the House Committee.HIGH NOON has been called a parable for the situation of those Americans who stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Investigating Committee and to the House of UnAmerican Activities Commitee during the Red Scare. It became an American classic, not only for its stylistic innovations, but also as an allegory to the McCarthy era. HIGH NOON is said to have reformultated the traditional Western and became a successful box-office surprise, breaking house records.The movie takes place within the course of a few hours, in the small town of Hadleyville, New Mexico, as Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is being wed to his beautiful young bride, Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly). The entire town has turned out for the event, that is, until news arrives that a band of ex-cons working for convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) have returned to settle a score with Kane after their arrests under his law landed them in prison.The script was written by Carl Foreman, who was blacklisted as a result of the Red Scare. It is said that Foreman's Blacklisting and his betrayal at the hands of his colleagues defined and shaped the motion picture. What should have been the high point of Foreman's career was nothing more than a lonely exile for him. Shut away from family and friends, Foreman was excluded from most of the production on HIGH NOON and faced serious bouts with depression. His old partner, Stanley Kramer, betrayed him by severing their business ties and removing his credit as producer of the film, due to the Blacklist, instead of helping his friend fight. To look at the script, its characters, and its situations, is to realize the resemblance of the situation to the plight of those who populate the film itself.Consider Cooper's Kane, for example. His desperation quickly grows when it becomes clear that no one in the town is willing to take a stand by his side once noon arrives. In less than two hours, he's gone from being commended and applauded at his wedding to being the center of attention as the cause of the town's tensions and dangers, all because of doing his everyday work. Whether or not screenwriter Foreman was intentionally trying to reveal something about our society at this period in time is uncertain, but the film definitely mirrors his own predicament and the betrayal he felt.Throughout the duration of the film, which takes place in real time, Foreman and director Fred Zinnemann also examine the effects of the impending danger on certain members of the townsfolk. The film's elements of loyalty, betrayal, trust and mistrust, are all factors that came into play during McCarthyism, and tie in brilliantly with reality. Kane's bride, Amy, is torn between her fear of violence and bloodshed and her devotion to her husband, while many of the townsfolk grapple with the choice of standing behind their Marshall or finding an excuse to hide, as seen in an interrupted church service, where a pleading Kane is shot down by his own citizens. These are people struck by fear, and out of that fear they are willing to leave Kane to fend for himself.HIGH NOON is about loyalty and betrayal. Loyalty on Kane's part - even when everyone deserts him, he stands his ground, though it seems inevitable that the action will cost him his life. And betrayal on the town's part. Many of the locals are agreed that they owe their prosperity to Kane, but they will not help him or defend him, because they believe his cause to be hopeless. In the end, Kane is forced into the showdown on his own, until, at a crucial moment, Amy proves herself to be a worthy wife, fighting to protect her husband.Without support from the townsfolk, Kane will no longer be their leader. Silently, without a backward glance or goodbye, he and Amy ride off into the distance from the community of weak, fickle onlookers. The contemptible crowd that was unwilling to fight to preserve its law and order remains silent as the buckboard goes out of view, accompanied by the title song's famous melancholy ballad. A parallel to other ""hostile witnesses"" who wound up abandoning their careers? Perhaps.",3,Worth watching for the history,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,5065,"['House', 'Committee', 'Un-Amewrican', 'Activities', 'HUAC', 'was', 'created', '1938', 'means', 'investigate', 'people',

40743,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0782008348,Martin Asiner,"[8, 12]","Gary Cooper is one of an handful of actors whose strong moral compass never fails to ring true. From his earliest films in the silent era right up till his last works, Gary Cooper continually shows the viewer some lessons right out of Acting 101. He makes it look so easy, how to radiate controlled fear while disguising it as bland bravery. In HIGH NOON, Cooper learns a brutal lesson that everyone in the film well knew. In a moment of crisis, you can't count on ordinary folk for help. Ironically, it is the evil ones who are made of the required stern stuff to face a six-gun.When Cooper, who plays Marshall Will Kane, learns that a recently released from prison convict is returning to town to settle a grudge against him, Cooper tries to enlist the aid of anyone who can help. His friends, his deputy, even his wife fail to recognize the code that forms the bulk of his core. Just as his friends feel they cannot help him, Cooper is just as impelled to the opposite. By movie's end, he meets the bad guys, kills them, and then is stunned to realize that as this external battle has ended, a far more complex internal one is just beginning.HIGH NOON stands out as a masterpiece, partly due to Cooper, but also to a fine supporting cast which acts as universal lightning rods to attract a swirling torrent of fear, from which not even Cooper is immune. Lon Chaney as the cowardly politician, LLoyd Bridges as the equally cowardly deputy, Katy Jurado as the Mexican woman who once loved Kane but has lost him to Grace Kelly all shine in roles that require them to walk a fine line between bouncing off Kane with just the right force to serve as a dramatic foil and yet not divert the audience's attention for too long as Kane sees who they are and what he must be.HIGH NOON is no subtle exploration of the different essences that separate hero from villain from coward. This movie delineates in a starkness that matches the black and white filming the need for even a brave man to look within to find the strength that others routinely know is missing in them but take for granted in him.",5,High Noon: One Of The Best Of All Time,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,2091,"['Gary', 'Cooper', 'one', 'handful', 'actors', 'strong', 'moral', 'compass', 'never', 'ring', 'true', 'earliest', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'right', 'up', 'till', 'last', 'works', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'continually', 'viewer', 'lessons', 'right', 'Acting', '101', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'how', 'radiate', 'controlled', 'fear', 'disguising', 'bland', 'bravery', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'Cooper', 'brutal', 'lesson', 'everyone', 'film', 'well', 'knew', 'moment', 'crisis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'help', 'Ironically', 'evil', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'made', 'required', 'stern', 'stuff', 'face', 'six-gun.When', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Kane', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'convict', 'returning', 'town', 'settle', 'grudge', 'Cooper', 'enlist', 'aid', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'friends', 'deputy', 'even', 'wife', 'fail', 'recognize', 'code', 'bulk', 'core', 'Just', 'friends', 'feel', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'Cooper', 'just', 'as', 'impelled', 'opposite', 'movie', 'end', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'stunned', 'realize', 'external', 'battle', 'ended', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'internal', 'one', 'just', 'beginning.HIGH', 'NOON', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'partly', 'due', 'Cooper', 'also', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'universal', 'lightning', 'rods', 'attract', 'swirling', 'torrent', 'fear', 'not', 'even', 'Cooper', 'immune', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'cowardly', 'politician', 'LLoyd', 'Bridges', 'equally', 'cowardly', 'deputy', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'loved', 'Kane', 'lost', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'shine', 'roles', 'require', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'bouncing', 'off', 'Kane', 'just', 'right', 'force', 'serve', 'dramatic', 'foil', 'yet', 'not', 'divert', 'audience', 'attention', 'too', 'long', 'Kane', 'sees', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'must', 'be.HIGH', 'NOON', 'subtle', 'exploration', 'different', 'essences', 'separate', 'hero', 'villain', 'coward', 'movie', 'starkness', 'black', 'white', 'filming', 'need', 'even', 'brave', 'man', 'look', 'find', 'strength', 'others', 'routinely', 'know', 'missing', 'take', 'granted']",N/A

Film critics and film historians as well as other directors have all called it one of the greatest films of all time(#27) according to the latest AFI survey. Another AFI survey ranked Gary Cooper's portrayal of Marshall Will Kane as the #5 film hero of all time(Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockinbird"" was voted #1). The film was made on a small budget($730,000) and had a 28 day shooting schedule. Written by Carl Foreman, produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by the great Fred Zinnemann, it can rightly be called a classic. I have owned every version of the film starting with the 40th Anniversary VHS from 1992 and the 50th Anniversary DVD Collector's Edition from 2002, both put out by Republic. I've never liked the picture quality of either of these, particularly the 2002 DVD Edition. When I heard that Paramount Pictures had purchased the Republic catalog my hopes were that they would release a Blu-ray edition in time for ""High Noon's"" 60th Anniversary in 2012. Paramount is releasing it's Republic catalog thru Olive Films for all their blu ray releases and ""High Noon"" is one of the first. I finally received it yesterday in the mail and watched it last night. Then I did a comparison with the 2002 Dvd edition. To be honest, there is no comparison. Olive Films has done a superb job with this edition and ""High Noon"" has never looked better. I was worried at first because this is my first experience with Olive Films. All that worry was in vain because this is the best version of ""High Noon"" in any format that I've ever seen. I won't go over the plot of the film. Nearly every film buff knows the story by now. Let's just say that this new blu ray version brings out the tension in all the characters even more. The close-ups of Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Katy Jurado, Lloyd Bridges and the rest of the cast are amazing in blu ray. I recently bought the blu ray of ""To Catch a Thief"" and not only does does Grace Kelly look beautiful in color, but looks even better in black and white. You can also feel all the emotion and pain in Cooper's face. Admittedly, he was really in pain during the shooting suffering from a bleeding ulcer. But he deservedly won the Best Actor Academy Award that year for his fine performance. Fred Zinnemann probably had something to do with that. He was an underrated director(along with Michael Curtiz) and very rarely gets mentioned when anyone talks about the great Hollywood directors. But the facts are certainly there. Pictures that Zinnemann directed amassed a total of 65 Academy Award nominations with 24 wins! He directed actors that appeared in his films to a total of nineteen Oscar nominations. It's remarkable because he didn't direct that many films compared to some of today's directors like Steven Speilberg, Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood. He's right up there with William Wyler, Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston and John Ford to mention just a few. I'm looking forward to future blu ray releases by Olive Films and will be ordering their two John Garfield releases ""Body and Soul"" and ""Force of Evil"" when they come out next week. Hopfully we'll get a 60th Anniversary blu ray of John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" later in the year considering how bad the transfer was for Republic's 50th Anniversary Edition in 2002. Until then, I highly recommend this blu ray release thru Olive Films.

What's worse is that after the train arrives the director, who has made the audience sit through 90 minutes of soul-searching by the pacifist sheriff, stages a poorly done gunfight.

40751,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,0782008348,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[1, 2]","A classic film that was not well received by its audiences (for not fitting the Western archetype with chases, lots of gunfights and epic scenery) but which was later recognized as AFI's 2007 list of great films. Eisenhower and Clinton cited this picture as their favorite film of all time and the latter is cited as having screened this one 17 times at the White House. Some might call that irony. The tale focused upon a newlywed sheriff torn between the love for his pacifist wife and his duty to stop some baddies coming into town. He decides that duty wins and goes about trying to get help from a mostly ambivalent town. Many considered this film to be an allegory of the Hollywood blacklisting of the old days. John Wayne was cited as calling this film ""Un-American"" and teamed up with Howard Hawkes to film RIO LOBO as a conservative response. Producer Carl Foreman was later blacklisted by Hollywood. When the Academy Awards came about and this movie lost it created one of the greatest uproars and many believed this was a way to appease Senator McCarthy who was hunting for Communists in Hollywood. Gary Cooper won an Oscar for Best Actor but was not there to receive it because of all the controversy. Ironically, John Wayne received it on behalf of Cooper. The film seemed to take the stance that pacifism is only useful up to a certain degree. The character's choice of a wife seemed strange compared to his former mistress who was more like him but then opposites sometimes attract (and a pretty white blonde is going to get more people in the seat than a minority woman I suspect for those times). Mexican actress Katy Jurado picked up Best Supporting Actress from the Golden Globves for her role and was thus the first Mexican American to ever win such an award.

Using the film's running time in actual time adds to the urgency and growing desperation of Sheriff Will Kane as the clock ticks closer to noon when he will be in a duel with four men on the streets of the town he feels a moral responsibility to single-handedly protect.It is quite well known that Gary Cooper was very ill with an ulcer problem during the making of the film, and that certainly added to his performance, for which he won his second Oscar (the first was for Sergeant York).  The almost visibly shaking of a man deserted by his friends to face four deadly killers is best reflected in his eyes, nervous but trying not to appear that way to others.The Blu-ray is definitely superior to the previous DVD release.  It is extremely sharp, and I find it hard to believe it even looked this good on the original movie screen.Audio, on the other hand, is where the Blu from Olive comes up way short.  They have chosen a mono audio that plays only on a center speaker.  I prefer the choice of an enhanced audio on the original DVD.Also, the extras are, unfortunately, not all brought over from the DVD.  I realize Olive Films is infamous for having no extras on their Blu releases, and I guess we should be happy that we did get a documentary on the making of the movie from the previous DVD release, but there were others on that DVD release it would have been nice to get (a commentary and another documentary about the film).Oh, well, despite the audio and extras setback, I recommend Olive's High Noon release enthusiastically.",4,"Excellent Blu video presentation, but weak on audio and extras",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1684,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Olive', 'Film', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'High', 'Noon', 'movie', 'still', 'suspenseful', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'released', '1952', 'Using', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'actual', 'time', 'urgency', 'growing', 'desperation', 'Sheriff', 'Will', 'Kane', 'clock', 'ticks', 'closer', 'noon', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'duel', 'four', 'men', 'streets', 'town', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'single-handedly', 'protect.It', 'quite', 'well', 'known', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'very', 'ill', 'ulcer', 'problem', 'making', 'film', 'certainly', 'added', 'performance', 'won', 'second', 'Oscar', 'first', 'was', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'almost', 'visibly', 'shaking', 'man', 'deserted', 'friends', 'face', 'four', 'deadly', 'killers', 'best', 'reflected', 'eyes', 'nervous', 'trying', 'not', 'appear', 'way', 'others.The', 'Blu-ray', 'definitely', 'superior', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'even', 'looked', 'good', 'original', 'movie', 'screen.Audio', 'other', 'hand', 'where', 'Blu', 'Olive', 'up', 'way', 'short', 'have', 'chosen', 'mono', 'audio', 'only', 'center', 'speaker', 'prefer', 'choice', 'enhanced', 'audio', 'original', 'DVD.Also', 'extras', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'brought', 'DVD', 'realize', 'Olive', 'Films', 'infamous', 'having', 'extras', 'Blu', 'releases', 'guess', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'did', 'get', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'were', 'others', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'film', '.Oh', 'well', 'audio', 'extras', 'setback', 'recommend', 'Olive', 'High', 'Noon', 'release', 'enthusiastically']",N/A

Gary Cooper stars as Will Cain, a sheriff of small town Hadleyville, NM, who has just gotten married to Amy played by Grace Kelly.  Amy is a Quaker and in deference to her pacifist beliefs, Will is turning in his badge.  But just as the newlyweds are preparing to leave town for a new life, Will learns that a criminal, Frank Miller, he put behind bars is being paroled and arriving in town on the 12 noon train for a showdown.  Tension fills the air as the anticipated showdown draws closer.  Amy begs for Will to leave with her, but he knows he can't run away.  He must stay and defend the town and his honor.  Will finds himself alone in the battle as everyone in town, including his deputy sheriff Harvey Pell, played by Lloyd Bridges, have turned away from him.  The film is just a little over 80 minutes long and it unfolds in essentially real time on the screen.  Director Fred Zinnemann effectively uses clocks to convey the time ticking away towards the battle.  The movie is filled with tension as the showdown draws near and Mr. Cooper brilliantly plays his part for which he won his second Best Actor Oscar.

And it has been on the AFI's top 100 off and for a long time. So I expected some real magic here. But the film is really very simple. A very good character study and a film that doesn't depend on action and violence to tell it's story. The entire film is building it's way up to an unavoidable showdown that Gary Cooper's character will face. It's about honor and duty. While cooper is the epitome of the classic hero, he's also unsure of him self, scared, and desperately looking for some men to join him as deputies to take on a ruthless man he had put away years before that was just released from prison and will arrive on a train at twelve noon in this small town, looking for some payback. Cooper's character has plenty of chances to leave town but he doesn't. Even his wife can't convince him to leave. The idea is that he's determined to stand for his town no matter what the cost even though he's truly freightened. The acting is great and production values are not something special like an Orson Welles sort of thing, but very good. Other than that this film is sort of dull and uneventful. By the time the showdown happens it isn't like I was expecting at all. Cooper doesn't bravely stand in the middle of the town square like so many westerns have their heroes do, but instead cooper creeps around and hides and takes each bad guy out one at a time. I found the film marginally interesting but wonder what all the praise is about. I can't understand why it's a classic. I wasn't tremendously impressed with Citizen Kane either, and it's considered the greatest movie ever made.

40772,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0782008348,Randy Keehn,"[2, 2]","One of my favorite movies of all time is this suspenseful Western starring Gary Cooper.  It is a simple tale told in a complex and artistic manner.  A man retires as the town Marshall and marries a Quaker (the main reason for his retirement).  On the day of their wedding, word comes that a man he sent away to prison (Frank Miller) has been released and is heading to his town to settle the score.  The ex-Marshall, Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), first leaves with his new bride but turns around to meet the challenge.  He initially assumes that he will not have to meet Frank Miller alone.  However, when he looks to put together some deputies, only one man volunteers and once that man realizes that he is the only volunteer, he quits as well.  Knowing that Frank Miller will be accompanied by two henchmen, Kane is face with the reality that he will have to face the challenge alone and out-gunned.  The stage is thus set for a suspenseful gun battle.Naturally, good triumphs over evil; this is a 1952 movie afterall.  However, the movie shows that not all is well within what we consider to represent good.  Why was Kane left to meet this fight alone?  Even his newlywed bride gave him an ultimatim of her of the shootout.  This concept of one man standing alone amidst cowardice and apathy angered the likes of John Ford and John Wayne (although it didn't keep the Duke from accepting Cooper's Best Actor Oscar on his behalf).  World War II was still vivid in everyone's memory and it was a memory of America coming to the rescue; not kicking and screaming but marching proudly.  Yet this movie was not an analogy of WWII but of the McCarthy Era where the suggestion was that fear intimidated the populace and kept them from speaking up when individuals were challenged.Irregardless of your thoughts on the film's deeper meaning, this is a tour-de-force by Cooper. His stoic strength in the face of fear is a preformance for the ages.  Cooper does not come across as a man full of himself.  He shows that he has weaknesses but he struggles, successfully, to confront them.  He is Everyman who must face his fears, not some Superman who has no fear.  The movie builds in suspense as he becomes increasingly aware of his lonely mission.  Then the suspense jump-starts to a higher level as everything awaits the arrival of Frank Miller on the noon train.  I can hear the music of the soundtrack accentuate the suspense and the train whistle blowing the arrival of Fate.  The shoot out itself is subdued somewhat in scope reminding us that it is Everyman and not Superman who is battling the enemy.  The final scene is as dramatic in symbolism as the shoot-out was in action.As time, tastes, an technology move on, many once-great movies fall by the wayside.  &quot;High Noon&quot; is a movie for all ages and all times.  The acting, directing, musical score, supporting acting, writing et. al. are all superb.  If you haven't scene this movie, you're missing a classic.

This particular DVD release, however, may be a bit disappointing for some.  The ""collector's edition"" features some film commentary and behind-the-scenes discussion, but almost all of it is focused on drawing parallels between the film's storyline and the hearings on Un-American acitivities that occurred about the same time the movie was made.While some comparison between the two is legitimate, the feature-length commentary virtually ignores other allegorical interpretations.  What makes ""High Noon"" a classic is that, besides simply being a story about duty and integrity when the chips are down, it can represent different things to different people.If one is hell-bent on viewing it allegorically, one can find it representative of World War II, the Cold War, the war on terrorism, a conflict between the domestic and the foreign, a struggle for gender or racial equality, etc. etc.  Heaven forbid one should simply like it as a story of a good guy whippin' the bad guys.But to view its symbolism only within the confines of a parable about internecine politics is narrow-minded and diminishes its status as a classic work of photographic, dramatic, and narrative art.  Very little is said of these aspects of the film in the course of the commentary; the conversation always comes back to the Hollywood blacklist.  I would like to have learned more about how this or that technical problem was solved, and less repetitive annotation about Carl Foreman's political persecution.So to sum up -- great movie, and no doubt many will be delighted with this release, but the collector's edition may not be for everybody.

First of all it is an American Western of the best kind.  But High Noon is more than a Western, it is a great movie, so much so that I rank this movie in the top three of all time.The plot involves a longtime marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) of Hadleyville in the New Mexico Territory who has recently retired after his marriage to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) who happens to be a Quaker.  The story goes that as Kane was ready to leave when he was informed on Sunday morning that the train due in at 12:00 noon had old nemeses Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) a criminal whom Kane brought to justice years ago.  In fact Miller was to be hanged for his crimes but due to legal technicalities his sentence was changed and he was subsequently released.Kane was told by all his friends and some enemies in fact that he should take his leave with his new bride.  Kane refuses to budge and does not go and he considers this as unfinished and a matter of personal honor that he confront not only Miller but three of his sidekicks who are in fact waiting at the Hadleyville railroad station for the arrival of Miller.As the story develops further we see Kane trying to gather deputies to combat these four gunmen and of course he finds that many of his friends are not about to put themselves in harm&#8217;s way.  It is at this time in the movie when the props of the clock ticking and the sounds of a train whistle charging forward to the railroad station take on a haunting meaning.The movie is not just a great Western, but tells a greater story about how a man faces a crisis when everyone including his wife abandons him.  As the clocks ticks and the whistle blows to the inevitable showdown there is the greatest scene in film history as the camera fades up and over Kane as he walks to face the four gunmen.

Though off the professional hook because of his newly-wed status and a new life in a world away from law enforcement, Will Kane could not easily avoid taking on armed responsibility one last time.&quot;High Noon&quot; perfectly defined timeless if unpleasant elements of human behavior that can at times infuriate, confuse, frustrate,  and even sabotage the best of honorable intentions. When people herd, they can always find a way of rationalizing aversion to getting involved for the greater good and can become quite clever in explaining away personal cowardice. As the noon hour drew closer, Kane finally sought out the help of his long time mentor and retired fellow lawman who succinctly noted that &quot;deep down, people don't care, they just don't care.&quot; Anyway, age and arthritic hands made his armed support a moot point.This film is a relevant today as when released just over 50 years ago.  In some ways, even more so.  Few films capture so elegantly what it is to find ones self in dire circumstances so utterly alone.Facing such a defining moment takes an uncommon courage and a real character to fight long odds of probable defeat.

Howard Hawks and John Wayne hated this movie and made Rio Bravo as a right-wing response to blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman and the film's message to Hollywood for the failure of the Hollywood people to stand up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era.  Wayne and Hawks hated that Will Kane ran around town like a ""chicken with his head cut off.""  Wayne's political views aside, the plot stands up.  Spineless townspeople is a Western staple, Kane could not run away because the killer would catch up to him and kill his new wife, too (is it really so terrible that the hero is not super-human?).  So, after calling in favors that didn't come through, he stands alone in one of the most famous shots in cinematic history (the crane shot of Kane standing alone in the middle of the street).

40780,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0782008348,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","High Noon (Fred Zinnemann, 1952)Note: here be spoilers. On the off chance that you haven't seen or heard anything about the movie, you may want to skip this review.There's a scene in High Noon that just makes it for me. It's pretty close to the end, right at the point where Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has realized that no one in town is going to help him fight Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and his gang, and resigned to his fate, he leaves his office and heads up to the depot to confront Miller. As he walks down the street, the camera pulls away from him to an aerial view, but there's nothing smooth about the pullback; it's jerky and swerving and jolting, as if the whole town is about to fall down around Kane's ears, or as if to simulate what must be going on in Kane's stomach, or both. How often do you see that in a movie nowadays? (,he says just after writing reviews for No Country for Old Men and The Dreamers.) It's not so much the symbolism of the thing as the fact that it seems so natural, as if someone on the set said, ""hey, we've got a pullback here, wouldn't it be neat if we did this with it...?"".It's probably inexcusable for someone who fancies himself a media critic to have seen as few Gary Cooper movies as I have in my lifetime, but after finally seeing High Noon, I plan to watch a lot more of them. Cooper is as laconic as he is iconic, the plain-spoken good guy who realizes he's got a job to do whether anyone wants to help him with it or not. He comes off as a bit dour, which makes me wonder why his new Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) would have married him in the first place, but that's a minor thing. Kane's demeanor sets him apart not only from the bad guys (and a fine batch they were-- MacDonald is backed up by country singer Sheb Wooley, prolific character actor Robert Wilke, and a young lee van Cleef), but from the townsfolk; not a coincidence, one thinks, especially given the film's oft-noted red scare subtext (the subtext that caused John Wayne to remark that High Noon was the most anti-American movie ever made).Honestly, now that I've opened that door, I can't see the red scare subtext as valid to criticism of the movie any more. It was half a century ago, and we all realize it was idiotic (at least, I hope we do). Ignore it when watching the movie now. There are so many other reasons to like the movie. Zinnemann's casting was dead-on for almost every role, even in the places where he ended up using his fifth or sixth choice for a role (Gary Cooper was far from Zinnemann's first choice for Kane, for example). Cooper and Kelly are fantastic, and their odd lack of chemistry is offset by the fact that the two have very few scenes together. The rest of the townsfolk are uniformly excellent, as is to be expected when one's talent pool contains such notables as Harry Morgan, Lon Chaney Jr., Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado. Zinnemann's direction is excellent, coupled with Floyd Crosby's groundbreaking cinematography, which is played up quite nicely with Elmo Williams' editing (Williams is responsible for the real-time aspect of the film, which was originally meant to run a good deal longer; Crosby was the guy who figured out how to make the film look so sere. No, you're not watching a faded print). A number of very talented folks worked on this movie, and they all brought their A games.

40781,AZRW9KDV2X8E8,0782008348,Robert C. Graham,"[23, 27]","In 1952 writer Carl Foreman, director Fred Zinnemann, cinematographer Floyd Crosby and producer Stanley Kramer created a one-off recipe for a new kind of western.  The ingredients; Gary Cooper, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Grace Kelly, Lon Chaney, Henry and Otto Kruger interwoven with an unforgettable ballad written by Dimitri Tiomkin/Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter. The result is a movie with every second to be savoured.Made at a time when sprawling landscaped Technicolor shoot-em-up westerns were the norm, High Noon was filmed in high contrast black and white.Much of the film`s tension and excitement is due to the fact that each desperate minute that passes on screen is virtually equal to real time heightened by ever closening shots of clocks as noon approaches.Marshall Will Kane is played faultlessly by Gary Cooper in probably his finest role.  Kane,  afraid, yet courageous and dutiful to his friends and townsfolk finds that, in his hour of need, they turn their backs on him. Kane`s anguished face was not all acting because Gary Cooper was suffering from a bleeding ulcer during filming and was concerned over the fight scene with Lloyd Bridges because of back problems.A film of loyalty and of betrayal in which Kane is torn between his new wife, Amy (Grace Kelly) and his duty when he tells herKane:They`re making me run.  I`ve never run from anybody before.Amy: I don`t understand any of this.Kane: (looking at his vest watch) Well, I haven`t got time to tell ya.Crucially, as time passes and tension builds, she speaks to Kane`s old flame, Helen Ramirez (played by Katy Jurado)Helen: If Kane was my man, I`d never leave him like this.  I`d get a gun. I`d fight.Amy:  Why don`t you?Helen:  He is not my man. He`s yours.When Kane does win through, with, finally,  Amy`s help, his so-called friends then rally round to congratulate him. With contempt he throws his star in the dust and drives off with Amy.1952 was also `McCarthy` time. To some, unfortunately very influential people, High Noon was seen as `un-American`.  Not long after writing the script, Carl Foreman was blacklisted. Listed too was Lloyd Bridges who didn`t work for a few years after and of course Floyd Crosby (after all he had filmed it!).High Noon is not only one of the best westerns ever made but one of the finest films ever created. Beautiful photography, outstanding minimalistic direction and taught editing with a screenplay magnificently performed by a superb cast.There can be few people who have not seen High Noon and even fewer who can recall the outstanding original theatrical print having viewed it only on VHS or as a tv broadcast.This DVD has transferred the sparkling high contrast images seen on the original 35mm negative. The image and sound quality of this DVD  breathes new life into a classic making it as fresh and thrilling as it ever was.Robert C Graham (UK)",5,HIGH TIME FOR HIGN NOON ON DVD,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2888,"['1952', 'writer', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'director', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'cinematographer', 'Floyd', 'Crosby', 'producer', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'created', 'one-off', 'recipe', 'new', 'kind', 'western', 'ingredients', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Henry', 'Otto', 'Kruger', 'interwoven', 'unforgettable', 'ballad', 'written', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin/Ned', 'Washington', 'sung', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'result', 'movie', 'second', 'be', 'savoured.Made', 'time', 'when', 'sprawling', 'landscaped', 'Technicolor', 'shoot-em-up', 'westerns', 'were', 'norm', 'High', 'Noon', 'was', 'filmed', 'high', 'contrast', 'black', 'white.Much', 'film', 's', 'tension', 'excitement', 'due', 'fact', 'desperate', 'minute', 'screen', 'virtually', 'equal', 'real', 'time', 'heightened', 'ever', 'closening', 'shots', 'clocks', 'noon', 'approaches.Marshall', 'Will', 'Kane', 'played', 'faultlessly', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'probably', 'finest', 'role', 'Kane', 'afraid', 'yet', 'courageous', 'dutiful', 'friends', 'townsfolk', 'finds', 'hour', 'need', 'turn', 'backs', 'Kane', 's', 'anguished', 'face', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'suffering', 'bleeding', 'ulcer', 'filming', 'was', 'concerned', 'fight', 'scene', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'back', 'problems.A', 'film', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'Kane', 'torn', 'new', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'duty', 'when', 'herKane', 're', 'making', 'run', 've', 'never', 'run', 'anybody', 'before.Amy', 'don', 't', 'understand', 'this.Kane', 'looking', 'vest', 'watch', 'Well', 'haven', 't', 'got', 'time', 'tell', 'ya.Crucially', 'time', 'passes', 'tension', 'builds', 'Kane', 's', 'old', 'flame', 'Helen', 'Ramirez', 'played', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'Helen', 'Kane', 'was', 'man', 'd', 'never', 'leave', 'd', 'get', 'gun', 'd', 'fight.Amy', 'Why', 'don', 't', 'not', 'man', 's', 'yours.When', 'Kane', 'win', 'finally', 'Amy', 's', 'help', 'so-called', 'friends', 'then', 'rally', 'round', 'congratulate', 'contempt', 'star', 'dust', 'off', 'Amy.1952', 'was', 'also', 'McCarthy', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'influential', 'people', 'High', 'Noon', 'was', 'seen', 'un-American', 'Not', 'long', 'writing', 'script', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'Listed', 'too', 'was', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'who', 'didn', 't', 'work', 'few', 'years', 'course', 'Floyd', 'Crosby', 'had', 'filmed', '.High', 'Noon', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'Beautiful', 'photography', 'outstanding', 'minimalistic', 'direction', 'taught', 'editing', 'screenplay', 'magnificently', 'performed', 'superb', 'cast.There', 'can', 'be', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'High', 'Noon', 'even', 'fewer', 'who', 'can', 'recall', 'outstanding', 'original', 'theatrical', 'print', 'having', 'viewed', 'only', 'VHS', 'tv', 'broadcast.This', 'DVD', 'transferred', 'sparkling', 'high', 'contrast', 'images', 'seen', 'original', '35mm', 'negative', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'new', 'life', 'classic', 'making', 'fresh', 'thrilling', 'ever', 'C', 'Graham', 'UK']",N/A

I thought about that when recently seeing this film again. In brief, here's the situation. Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) learns that Frank Miller has been released from prison and will arrive on the noon train when it stops in Hadleyville. Joined by others, Miller then intends to locate the marshall and kill him. For various reasons, everyone in town abandons Kane...including his newlywed wife Amy (Kelly) and his deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges). Of course, Kane is tempted to leave with his new bride before noon and avoid Miller...but he doesn't. As high noon approaches, he finds himself alone and facing almost certain death. Cooper received and deserved his Academy Award for best actor. His performance in this film may well have been the best in his entire career. Especially effective use is made of the theme song ""Do Not Forsake Me [The Ballad of High Noon]"" co-written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington (sung off-camera by Tex Ritter), the key component of Tiomkin's music score which received an Academy Award. The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Bridges, Katy Jurado (Helen Ramirez), and Lon Chaney, Jr. (Martin Howe). Working with Carl Foreman's screenplay, director Fred Zinnemann focuses on what was (more than 50 years ago) a very controversial idea: that otherwise good people would refuse to support their marshal when he and their town are threatened by cold-blooded killers. John Wayne was among those who called this film ""Un-American."" Several of the townspeople can be accused of cowardice but that is not true of Amy Kane, a pacifist whose principles require her to oppose her husband's decision to remain. The final scene in the street is unforgettable. Whatever we may think, today, of Kane's decision and of those who oppose it or who remain neutral, we can nonetheless agree that this film still attracts and then sustains our interest; also, that our sense of dramatic tension increases with each passing moment.",5,What to Do?,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2088,"['Divine', 'Comedy', 'Dante', 'reserves', 'last', 'worst', 'ring', 'hell', 'who', 'moral', 'crisis', 'preserve', 'neutrality', 'thought', 'about', 'when', 'recently', 'seeing', 'film', 'again', 'brief', 'here', 'situation', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Cooper', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'will', 'arrive', 'noon', 'train', 'when', 'Hadleyville', 'Joined', 'others', 'Miller', 'then', 'locate', 'marshall', 'kill', 'various', 'reasons', 'everyone', 'town', 'abandons', 'Kane', 'including', 'newlywed', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Kelly', 'deputy', 'Harvey', 'Pell', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'course', 'Kane', 'tempted', 'leave', 'new', 'bride', 'noon', 'avoid', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'high', 'noon', 'approaches', 'alone', 'facing', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'Cooper', 'received', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'performance', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'entire', 'career', 'Especially', 'effective', 'use', 'made', 'theme', 'song', 'Do', 'Not', 'Forsake', 'Me', 'Ballad', 'High', 'Noon', ']', 'co-written', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'Ned', 'Washington', 'sung', 'off-camera', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'key', 'component', 'Tiomkin', 'music', 'score', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'notably', 'Bridges', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'Helen', 'Ramirez', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'Martin', 'Howe', 'Working', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'what', 'was', 'more', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'very', 'controversial', 'idea', 'otherwise', 'good', 'people', 'would', 'refuse', 'support', 'marshal', 'when', 'town', 'are', 'threatened', 'cold-blooded', 'killers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'who', 'called', 'film', 'Un-American', 'Several', 'townspeople', 'can', 'be', 'accused', 'cowardice', 'not', 'true', 'Amy', 'Kane', 'pacifist', 'principles', 'require', 'oppose', 'husband', 'decision', 'remain', 'final', 'scene', 'street', 'unforgettable', 'may', 'think', 'today', 'Kane', 'decision', 'who', 'oppose', 'who', 'remain', 'neutral', 'can', 'nonetheless', 'agree', 'film', 'still', 'then', 'interest', 'also', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'increases', 'passing', 'moment']",N/A
40784,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,0782008348,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[4, 5]","For many, Gary Cooper was the Westerner par excellence--cool, taciturn, courageous and just; skilled with a gun but slow to use it; gentlemanly, generous and shy, appealing to men as much as to women... This image reached its culmination in ""High Noon"" with his characterization of Marshal Will Kane, the brave and stubborn ex-marshal standing alone against the forces of evil, and the prototype for countless Western heroes ever since...Highly-stylized, carefully and beautifully shot, ""High Noon"" possibly owes its great popularity to a combination of three things--It's a suspense film in the real sense; the dearly beloved set-piece climax of the gun duel never got better or more thoughtful treatment; it has a theme tune that persistently whines its way into the subconscious... Most people first remember the Dimitri Tiomkin theme tune, then Gary Cooper stalking down the lonely street... The bits and pieces gather from there... The film also ties a small town of do-nothings showing their cowardice by turning their backs on trouble, integrity, and an elected representative...""High Noon"" is also distinguished by many fine images from the incidental (the brief close-up of the wagon wheel revolving against the town's facades as Cooper and Kelly leave the community); to the poignant ( Zinneman's camera drawing back from Cooper's face to show him standing vulnerable and alone in the dust of a deserted main street); to the deliberately melodramatic (Cooper bitterly grinding his marshal's badge in the dirt before riding away for good ).By means of rapid cross-cutting, Fred Zinnemann gives shots--repeatedly--of the pendulum of the clock, of the empty railroad tracks, and in rapid succession, shots of tense faces--taken at close range--of the townsfolk in the church, in the local saloon, then of the worried face of the marshal, his wife, and of the three criminals ready for the approaching train...""High Noon"" is the simple and forceful tale of an aging lawman on his day of retirement and also on his wedding day...Will Kane, on a blazing June morning in 1875, has just married a pretty young Quaker girl... The bride feels doubly blessed... She's got her man, and this is the day he will hang his guns... She has firm Quaker convictions and never did imagine herself as a lawman's wife...But, while it's all being celebrated a badly shaken stationmaster (Ted Stanhope) bursts in with quite the wrong kind of wedding telegram... It states that an outlaw Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) whom Kane had put behind bars six years ago for terrorizing the town has been released... The stationmaster adds that three members of his old gang are already awaiting his arrival at the depot--their object a reunion with the pardoned man who will get off the train at noon, and presumably settle the score with Kane...The marshal, like a sensible man, does, in fact, put his wife in the buggy, but then like a man of honor but also a sensible man (for the gang will surely hunt them down wherever they go) changes his mind and heads the horses back to town...A bride, especially a Quaker bride, can't quite see it this way on her wedding day so she hands him her own ultimatum--if he won't go away with her she'll go alone by train--the one that leaves at twelve...Everything on this torrid, dusty morning therefore hinges on midday--therefore Kramer's insistence on his clocks. From this point onwards High Noon, although it remains completely classic in Western terms, faithful to period and concerned with an indicative historical situation, takes on wide and profound implications...It's about group cowardice and short-term interest--particularly the treachery of so-called 'good' people... 'Law abiding,' you feel, doesn't mean what it should mean... When a group of people decide that they must passively refuse to support the law for reasons of personal preservation, who, in fact, are the outlaws?Thus the marshal's predicament... He is an embarrassment to everyone, from Judge (Otto Kruger)--he's leaving town--to the humblest citizen of Hadleyville... Only one is ready to give assistance and he melts away when he finds there'll be no other volunteers... The marshal's immature deputy (Lloyd Bridges) is willing to take over his job--again, provided Cooper leaves town... But this is absolute ambition at work...The build-up of tension as the lawman prepares to meet the four thugs and makes fruitless attempts to recruit help from the cowardly citizens has never been handled better, and it is sustained right up to and through the climactic gunfight as the lawman's bride finds herself trapped in the crossfire...Filmed in Black and White, ""High Noon"" is among the ten Best Westerns ever made... The film achieved the shape of a democratic allegory which reached people in much the same way and for the same reasons that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" had done... Its cutting suspense was the hallmark of Zinneman's mastery of the movie medium...Gary Cooper's performance, as the very vulnerable, worried man, won him the year's Oscar...",5,"Gary Cooper: The

40785,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,0782008348,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[0, 0]","This is an ""adult"" western in that the townpeople act like townspeople.  When faced by the possibility of an attack by five desperados, they prefer to do nothing and hope for the best.  The movie may have also had a political viewpoint.  We were locked in a deadly cold war with the Soviet Union.  Many people, just as the townpeople in ""High Noon"", reckoned that disarmament and coexistence was a safer policy than confrontation.Gary Cooper, as the resigning marshal of this small town, expects support--in terms of a posse--from the townsfolk.  United they will outnumber the desperados many times and should be able to kill or capture them.  One by one, however, the would-be posse peals away.  Some won't fight for religious reasons, some for personal reasons, some for diability reasons and one, would be hero, is a drunk.Cooper is left without allies and a bitter pill it is.  Even his beautiful wife [Grace Kelly] won't stay.  She wants them both to run. The only person who shows some guts is Katie Jurado who wants to fight for the marshal [and we know she would] but he belongs to another woman and so she gets out too.Cooper, with every expectation of death on a dusty street, waits for the outlaws to arrive on the noon train.  Hollywood style, he manages to gun down his enemies and then, in front of the assembled townsmen, throws down his badge in total disgust.It's a powerful film of a brave man and of human frailty.Ron Braithwaite author of Mexican Conquest novels, ""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God.""",5,a brave man facing certain death,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,1520,"['adult', 'western', 'townpeople', 'act', 'townspeople', 'When', 'faced', 'possibility', 'attack', 'five', 'desperados', 'prefer', 'do', 'nothing', 'hope', 'best', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'had', 'political', 'viewpoint', 'were', 'locked', 'deadly', 'cold', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Many', 'people', 'just', 'townpeople', 'High', 'Noon', 'reckoned', 'disarmament', 'coexistence', 'was', 'safer', 'policy', 'confrontation.Gary', 'Cooper', 'resigning', 'marshal', 'small', 'town', 'support', 'terms', 'posse', 'townsfolk', 'United', 'will', 'outnumber', 'desperados', 'many', 'times', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'kill', 'capture', 'One', 'one', 'however', 'would-be', 'posse', 'peals', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'religious', 'reasons', 'personal', 'reasons', 'diability', 'reasons', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hero', 'drunk.Cooper', 'left', 'allies', 'bitter', 'pill', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'wife', '[', 'Grace', 'Kelly', ']', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'run', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'guts', 'Katie', 'Jurado', 'who', 'fight', 'marshal', '[', 'know', 'would', ']', 'woman', 'so', 'out', 'too.Cooper', 'expectation', 'death', 'dusty', 'street', 'waits', 'outlaws', 'arrive', 'noon', 'train', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'gun', 'down', 'enemies', 'then', 'front', 'assembled', 'townsmen', 'down', 'badge', 'total', 'disgust.It', 'powerful', 'film', 'brave', 'man', 'human', 'frailty.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'Mexican', 'Conquest', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God']",N/A

40787,A1K94LXX833JTT,0782008348,Sanpete,"[102, 110]","Lionsgate has announced a new DVD release of High Noon with new special features.  There is what appears to be a reliable report, though unconfirmed, that it will include a new transfer of the film, restored by Paramount.  The current and older DVDs are only of average video and audio quality.This a true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors.Town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is caught between his new pacifist Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) and a felt duty to face down evil men coming on the noon train to take revenge on him (and presumably cause whatever other trouble they please).  Most of the drama takes place in the lead-up to a climactic battle, as the townspeople choose whether to support Kane with action or to let him stand alone.  Amy too must choose between her spouse and her own moral beliefs.  The tension builds relentlessly as we see clocks ticking towards noon.  The innovative black and white cinematography emphasizes the dramatic points, while the internal drama is captured in Cooper's face.The new DVD features are these:-- ""Inside High Noon,"" a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (see below for more on this)-- ""Tex Ritter: A Visit to Carthage, Texas,"" on the Tex Ritter Museum-- the full performance of ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'"" from the Jimmy Dean TV ShowThe features carried over from the current release are:-- commentary with Gary Cooper's daughter Maria Cooper Janis, screenwriter Carl Foreman's son Jonathan Foreman, director Fred Zinneman's son Tim Zinnemann and Tex Ritter's son John Ritter-- ""The Making of High Noon"" featurette-- ""Behind High Noon"" featurette-- radio broadcast with Tex RitterWhether the new features will warrant an upgrade is a matter of personal preference, of course.  A 50-minute documentary could be quite interesting, if it's well done.It does sound interesting.  The ""new"" documentary, actually made a couple years ago but shelved until now, is by film and Gary Cooper expert John Mulholland.  It's expected to cover, among other things, the conflict between Cooper and John Wayne over the participation of the blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman.  Given that the film is intended in part as an allegory of the public's acquiescence in the Red Scare, this will have more than the usual gossipy behind-the-scenes relevance.  It includes interviews with three of the children of the principles who participated in the DVD audio commentary: Cooper's daughter Maria, director Zinneman's son Tim, and Foreman's son Jonathan.  There are also interviews with Grace Kelly's son Prince Albert of Monaco, Western and film historians Brian Garfield, Lee Clark Mitchell, Stephen Prince and Meir Ribalow, and High Noon fan President Bill Clinton.  The narration is by actor Frank Langella.Lack of agreement between Paramount and Lionsgate prevented the earlier release of a restored transfer and the documentary, in case you're wondering why this didn't come out before.(Amazon has a habit of removing or not even accepting outside links, but if you want to read more about this, some of the more interesting tidbits are from a discussion at hometheaterforum.  Just do a web search for ""high noon"" plus ""ultimate collector's edition"" or ""inside high noon"" and such keywords to find the links--easy to find.)A parting note on the ethical side of the film.  While everyone can appreciate the strength of Cooper's character and the contrast to the weakness of others, which is no doubt the intended moral focus, we can wonder why the seemingly parallel choices facing Will and Amy are treated differently, with one portrayed heroically for choosing perceived broader duty over duty to spouse, while the other is seemingly approved in doing the opposite (those who have seen the movie will be able to see how that is).  I'm not sure writer Foreman saw that parallel as I put it here, and maybe there are good reasons to argue they aren't really parallel.  It could be a statement about the limits of pacifism, or it could be a reflection of other cultural mores that Foreman didn't question.  Or it could be largely motivated by the need for a certain kind of ending.  I'm not a film historian, so maybe these questions have already been addressed.  If so, feel free to leave a comment about it.",5,"New High Noon 2-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition due out June 10th, 2008!",1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,4411,"['Lionsgate', 'announced', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'High', 'Noon', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'what', 'be', 'reliable', 'report', 'unconfirmed', 'will', 'include', 'new', 'transfer', 'film', 'restored', 'Paramount', 'current', 'older', 'DVDs', 'are', 'only', 'average', 'video', 'audio', 'quality.This', 'true', 'classic', 'combining', 'traditional', 'Western', 'themes', 'contemporary', 'concerns', 'popular', 'acquiescence', 'evil', 'done', 'gripping', 'unusual', 'nearly', 'real-time', 'way', 'great', 'actors.Town', 'marshal', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'caught', 'new', 'pacifist', 'Quaker', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'felt', 'duty', 'face', 'down', 'evil', 'men', 'coming', 'noon', 'train', 'take', 'revenge', 'presumably', 'cause', 'other', 'trouble', 'please', 'Most', 'drama', 'place', 'lead-up', 'climactic', 'battle', 'townspeople', 'choose', 'support', 'Kane', 'action', 'let', 'stand', 'alone', 'Amy', 'too', 'must', 'choose', 'spouse', 'own', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'tension', 'relentlessly', 'see', 'clocks', 'ticking', 'towards', 'noon', 'innovative', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'dramatic', 'points', 'internal', 'drama', 'captured', 'Cooper', 'face.The', 'new', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'Inside', 'High', 'Noon', '50-minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'see', 'more', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'Visit', 'Carthage', 'Texas', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'Museum', 'full', 'performance', 'Do', 'Not', 'Forsake', 'Me', 'Oh', 'My', 'Darlin', 'Jimmy', 'Dean', 'TV', 'ShowThe', 'features', 'carried', 'current', 'release', 'are', 'commentary', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'Cooper', 'Janis', 'screenwriter', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Foreman', 'director', 'Fred', 'Zinneman', 'son', 'Tim', 'Zinnemann', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'son', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Making', 'High', 'Noon', 'featurette', 'High', 'Noon', 'featurette', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'Tex', 'RitterWhether', 'new', 'features', 'will', 'warrant', 'upgrade', 'matter', 'personal', 'preference', 'course', '50-minute', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'well', 'done.It', 'sound', 'interesting', 'new', 'documentary', 'actually', 'made', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'shelved', 'now', 'film', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'expert', 'John', 'Mulholland', 'expected', 'cover', 'other', 'things', 'conflict', 'Cooper', 'John', 'Wayne', 'participation', 'blacklisted', 'screenwriter', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'Given', 'film', 'intended', 'part', 'allegory', 'public', 'acquiescence', 'Red', 'Scare', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'usual', 'gossipy', 'behind-the-scenes', 'relevance', 'interviews', 'three', 'children', 'principles', 'who', 'participated', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Cooper', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'director', 'Zinneman', 'son', 'Tim', 'Foreman', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'son', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Monaco', 'Western', 'film', 'historians', 'Brian', 'Garfield', 'Lee', 'Clark', 'Mitchell', 'Stephen', 'Prince', 'Meir', 'Ribalow', 'High', 'Noon', 'fan', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'narration', 'actor', 'Frank', 'Langella.Lack', 'agreement', 'Paramount', 'Lionsgate', 'prevented', 'earlier', 'release', 'restored', 'transfer', 'documentary', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'Amazon', 'habit', 'removing', 'not', 'even', 'accepting', 'outside', 'links', 'want', 'read', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'are', 'discussion', 'hometheaterforum', 'Just', 'do', 'web', 'search', 'high', 'noon', 'ultimate', 'collector', 'edition', 'inside', 'high', 'noon', 'such', 'keywords', 'find', 'links', 'easy', 'find', 'parting', 'note', 'ethical', 'side', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'strength', 'Cooper', 'character', 'contrast', 'weakness', 'others', 'doubt', 'intended', 'moral', 'focus', 'can', 'wonder', 'why', 'seemingly', 'parallel', 'choices', 'facing', 'Will', 'Amy', 'are', 'treated', 'differently', 'one', 'heroically', 'choosing', 'perceived', 'broader', 'duty', 'duty', 'spouse', 'other', 'seemingly', 'approved', 'doing', 'opposite', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'how', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'writer', 'Foreman', 'saw', 'parallel', 'put', 'here', 'maybe', 'are', 'good', 'reasons', 'argue', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'parallel', 'could', 'be', 'statement', 'limits', 'pacifism', 'could', 'be', 'reflection', 'other', 'cultural', 'mores', 'Foreman', 'did', ""n't"", 'question', 'could', 'be', 'largely', 'motivated', 'need', 'certain', 'kind', 'ending', ""'m"", 'not', 'film', 'historian', 'so', 'maybe', 'questions', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'addressed', 'so', 'feel', 'free', 'leave', 'comment']",N/A
40788,A97THPN6OPN9U,0782008348,"Scott Emery ""Striving to Understand""","[0, 2]","Made on a low budget on a standard set, Fred Zinnemann (director), Carl Foreman (writer), Elmo Williams and Harry Gerstad (editors) nonetheless thoughtfully ask questions related to human nature in difficult situations as they carefully build tension in this 85-minute 1952 western.  The film broke the mold of superficial all-action westerns that preceded it, having more in common with the taut, realistic and dialogue-driven dramas that were one of the highest forms of achievement from late 40s and early 50s Hollywood (unless they swerved too heavily into melodrama).  The major weakness in this film is the relationship between sheriff Kane, played to stoic perfection by Gary Cooper, and of Amy Kane, portrayed by the much younger Grace Kelly.  It is not the age difference nor the particularities of the acting that fail, but rather relates to the implausibility of them being together in the first place and the consequent detriment to the logic of the plot and theme as the movie unfolds.The plot is relatively straightforward, but contains several details that are important to note.  Sheriff Kane learns of the prison release and near-term train arrival of the dastardly Frank Miller, a guy he arrested and judge (and jury, we presume, but where are those members?) Mettrick sent to prison a few years ago.  Frank vowed his revenge, we learn as we look at the chair in which he sat upon conviction, and three toughs with which he ran are now in town waiting for Frank to arrive on the Sunday noon train.  When Frank and the boys reunite, they will return to murder Kane and Mettrick.  Kane, by chance, was going to quit as Sheriff the next day, as it so happens he was married that same day, just prior to learning that Miller and the gang (one of whom is played by the squinty and glinty-eyed Lee Van Cleef, already distinctive).  We learn that he married the young blonde and bonneted Quaker Amy Fowler, who arrived in town from who knows where and apparently knows little of Kane's past - and not just the Miller affair.  Will Kane and his new bride start to leave town, but he is overcome with some sort of moral responsibility that, true to the code of the west, he cannot articulate but we understand - Amy does not - and he returns to the fictional Hadleyville, somewhere in the New Mexico territory, to gather volunteer deputies to face the Miller threat.  Significantly and rather absurdly, the Quaker Amy - did she not realize the kind of man he is, did he not realize her strict code of anti-violence? - decides to leave him on the spot because of this decision, vowing to leave on the train that will have just dropped off his would-be killer.He does not have long to accomplish this.  The film paces itself in near real-time, as Zinnemann provides consistent and periodic shots of large pendulum clocks that seem to be in every room to increase the tension.  Kane and Amy were married around 10:30, the train arrives at noon. We are also periodically provided with low-angle shots of the train track, the tiny depot in the background, creating a sense of the empty loneliness of the place and the situation, particularly, as it turns out, for Will Kane.  In a series of encounters that do not require description - but are repetitively and annoyingly accompanied by the much praised but relatively hokey film score by Dimitri Tiomkin, Kane travels from saloon to church and to a few residences as well in his effort to round up deputies that will help him, but to no avail. Additionally, the film ultimately brings us scenes of the morally and emotionally strong Mexican businesswoman, Helen Ramirez (played brilliantly by the smoldering Katy Jurado), who had been Kane's lover, and the headstrong Quaker, Amy.  Their dialogue and their difference defines the key moral choice involved in this situation - does killing a killer really solve anything, or does evil need to be confronted, violently if necessary, for civilization to progress? We also learn that Amy's brother and father died violently, and we learn that Helen does not much like Kane anymore, though her defense of him to Amy is vigorous.  What fractured the relationship of Helen and Will, the two strongest characters in this little town?  We are left to only guess.The encounters with the various people in the town are instructive.  While the good God-fearing people of the church initially support deputization enthusiastically, their natural fear, combined with the notion that this, after all, is not their quarrel, allows them to not only back down from supporting Kane, but with Kane's supposed pal, Mayor Jonas Henderson (a solid Thomas Mitchell) leading the way, suggest that Kane leave town pronto to save himself as well as the residents of Hadleyville.  The mayor apparently believes Frank Miller and the gang, who used to raise hell and own the town back in the day, will search fruitlessly and forever for Kane and never come back to disrupt the town.  Such, accurately portrayed, are the justifications of men under great duress.  The owners of the saloon and the hotel are also interesting, but less convincing.  They are apparently concerned only about commerce, and the subdued nature of the town post Kane's vanquish of the Miller gang has left them with less business volume - though the saloon sure seems pretty busy for a Sunday morning. I guess that old notion of a stable community, allowing for the influx of those middle-class capabilities and yearnings and dollars has somehow not paid off for these businessmen, who would rather have drunken brawlers and shoot-ups drive the local economic engine.  In any event, there is no support for Kane in town, not even from his hot-headed erstwhile deputy Pell, a role unconvincingly written and impatiently portrayed by Lloyd Bridges, whose distrust of Kane is not authentically developed by writer, director or actor.When the moment of truth arrives, the critical decisive action is that taken by Amy, apparently motivated by love and persuaded by Helen.  It is heavily foreshadowed in the shootout scene, but nonetheless leaves us believing that she does in fact have the American pragmatic moral conviction, most specifically that of the West, her clever-sounding but weak-kneed non-violent idealism left wanting in the face of the hard realities of life.  The film contains thoughtful suggestions of both the ugly blacklist era, of which writer Carl Foreman was a victim, depicted in the isolation experienced by the Kane and those who refused to testify against peers in the rush to judge who was truly American and not, and of the lessons of World War II, in which pacific notions of isolation and a willingness to dance away from the horrors of the early forties were not consonant with what was required to save free societies.  Because of those well-conceived and convincingly-portrayed ideas, High Noon is a commendable film worth viewing more than once.  If only Zinnemann and Foreman would have provided some scenes to explain the manner in which Will and Amy incongruously came together, why Helen and Will broke apart and even the antagonism between Will and deputy Pell - while still providing the foundation for the elucidation of those worthy themes - one might regard it as a master parable for postwar America.  Perhaps they worried that the sense of tension would be lost by including such explanatory scenes, but 15 minutes added to this relatively short film in the context of what the viewer knows is to come at the end might actually have enriched, rather than diminished, the climax.A work of great craft and substance, but it might have even been better.",4,"Taut and Thoughtful, but Important

40789,A2RMH46E7TDI0C,0782008348,"Sean Aune ""Slacker""","[2, 3]","1952's High Noon is considered by many to be the first ""adult"" Western.  A Western that finally addressed bigger subjects than simple good vs. evil, white vs. black.Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just married a Quaker named Amy (Fowler) Kane (Grace Kelly) and is giving up his post as Marshall in Hadleyville to appease his pacifist wife.  Just as he's hung up his gun and star, the news comes that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald),  a man the Marshall had sent away 5 years ago, has been paroled and is on his way back on the Noon train to make good on his threat of revenge against Kane.Kane's first impulse is to grab Amy and run from the town, but his sense of obligation kicks in and he heads back to Hadleyville with the intention of forming a posse to confront Miller and his gang.  Upon getting back to town, Amy informs Will that she will have no part of this and is leaving on the train if he is going to do this.  He says he has no choice, and heads out to get the help of the townspeople.What follows is a tension filled hour where citizen after citizen informs Kane that they would like to help, but.....  After years of service to the town, after being told repeatedly how he made the town safe, the town deserts him in his moment of need.This is an unsettling film in that it shows how the majority of men will talk a good game, but don't ever ask them to actually do anything.  Even Amy is a victim of this as she proclaims her peaceful ways for the entire movie, but in the end, even she has no choice but to go against the game she talks.Fred Zinnemann crafts as fine an amount of tension as I have ever seen.  The lingering shots of clocks, showing Kane's time ticking away.  The silent moments of staring down the straight train tracks, knowing that soon they will bring violence.  The gut wrenching moment when the train whistle blows, filling you with a mix of dread and relief that the anticipation has ended.  All of these deliver the desired emotional responses, which is not always an easy task for a filmmaker.  And the idea that this was shown in close to real time must have been a jaw dropper of an idea back in the 1950's.At times this almost feels like a modern day indie film.  The use of visuals is in unusual for a movie of this time period. the concept of playing out over real time and the amount of symbolism is astonishing.  Pay close attention to how Cooper treats his Marshal badge when he first hangs it up to the end of the film, and you will witness a truly gorgeous example of a nuanced performance.The DVD itself has two nice little documentaries about the production of the film.  If you watch closely, you can also catch Leonard Maltin in an amusing slip of facts.  He states that Gary Cooper won his only Oscar for this film...um...Leonard...Cooper won 2 Oscar's, this was #2.  Amusing when you consider what an expert on films he is supposed to be.  I would have liked to have seen one or two more extras, but overall, a nice package.4 out of 5 stars for the film3 out of 5 stars for the DVD",4,1952's version of an indie film,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,3042,"['1952', 'High', 'Noon', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'first', 'adult', 'Western', 'Western', 'finally', 'addressed', 'bigger', 'subjects', 'simple', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'white', 'vs.', 'black.Marshal', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'just', 'married', 'Quaker', 'named', 'Amy', 'Fowler', 'Kane', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'giving', 'up', 'post', 'Marshall', 'Hadleyville', 'appease', 'pacifist', 'wife', 'Just', 'hung', 'up', 'gun', 'star', 'news', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Ian', 'MacDonald', 'man', 'Marshall', 'had', 'sent', 'away', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'paroled', 'way', 'back', 'Noon', 'train', 'make', 'good', 'threat', 'revenge', 'Kane.Kane', 'first', 'impulse', 'grab', 'Amy', 'run', 'town', 'sense', 'obligation', 'kicks', 'back', 'Hadleyville', 'intention', 'forming', 'posse', 'confront', 'Miller', 'gang', 'getting', 'back', 'town', 'Amy', 'informs', 'Will', 'will', 'have', 'part', 'leaving', 'train', 'going', 'do', 'choice', 'out', 'get', 'help', 'townspeople.What', 'tension', 'filled', 'hour', 'where', 'citizen', 'citizen', 'informs', 'Kane', 'would', 'like', 'help', '..', 'years', 'service', 'town', 'being', 'told', 'repeatedly', 'how', 'made', 'town', 'safe', 'town', 'moment', 'need.This', 'unsettling', 'film', 'how', 'majority', 'men', 'will', 'talk', 'good', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'ask', 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'Even', 'Amy', 'victim', 'peaceful', 'ways', 'entire', 'movie', 'end', 'even', 'choice', 'go', 'game', 'talks.Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'crafts', 'fine', 'amount', 'tension', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'lingering', 'shots', 'clocks', 'showing', 'Kane', 'time', 'ticking', 'away', 'silent', 'moments', 'staring', 'down', 'straight', 'train', 'tracks', 'knowing', 'soon', 'will', 'bring', 'violence', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'moment', 'when', 'train', 'whistle', 'blows', 'filling', 'mix', 'dread', 'relief', 'anticipation', 'ended', 'deliver', 'desired', 'emotional', 'responses', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'task', 'filmmaker', 'idea', 'was', 'shown', 'close', 'real', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'jaw', 'dropper', 'idea', 'back', ""1950's.At"", 'times', 'almost', 'feels', 'modern', 'day', 'indie', 'film', 'use', 'visuals', 'unusual', 'movie', 'time', 'period', 'concept', 'playing', 'out', 'real', 'time', 'amount', 'symbolism', 'astonishing', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'how', 'Cooper', 'Marshal', 'badge', 'when', 'first', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'witness', 'truly', 'gorgeous', 'example', 'nuanced', 'performance.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'nice', 'little', 'documentaries', 'production', 'film', 'watch', 'closely', 'can', 'also', 'catch', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'amusing', 'slip', 'facts', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'won', 'only', 'Oscar', 'film', 'um', 'Leonard', 'Cooper', 'won', '2', 'Oscar', 'was', '2', 'Amusing', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'expert', 'films', 'supposed', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'extras', 'overall', 'nice', 'package.4', '5', 'stars', 'film3', '5', 'stars', 'DVD']",N/A

I will thus only add a small personal impression. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself. This is not what we were expected to see from Western heroes. Also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win. Also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person. If he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly Mexican woman?I am only speaking about my own naivete of course.I too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety.This is to say that while I sensed somehow the movie is 'good' I could not because of the perplexity I felt , enjoy it.The good guy does not run. He does stand up and alone face the bad guys.

40795,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,0782008348,Simon Davis,"[2, 2]","The classic 1952 version of ""High Noon"", is an exceptional film in so many ways and totally measures up to all the praise that has been heaped on it since it's first release. Brilliantly written, with many finely drawn characters, it was an amazingly adventurous production for the time in deliberately not fitting into the standard and much loved western formula of the evil bad guys wearing th eblack hats with the fearless and in control good guy with his white hat.

Gary Cooper gives a powerfully restrained performance as Will Kane, a man of conscience whose decision to stand his ground against three outlaws results in the desertion of nearly everyone in his life.  That the story is a thinly-veiled assault on McCarthyism is beside the point; it also serves as a reminder of the brittle patina of community that unites mainstream American culture.  As in the typical modern suburb, the townspeople here go through the motions of civility, only to quickly devolve into me-first survivalism when their public notions of camraderie are tested.  Told in ""real time,"" the film hits all the right marks:  great script, straightforward direction, ""real time"" pacing, and a haunting score by Dimitri Tiomkin (with vocals by Tex Ritter, who actually sounds like Gary Cooper singing, matching the sense that the songs are Kane's conscience).  Supporting performances by Grace Kelly, Katie Jurado, Harry Morgan, and Lloyd Bridges (as a wormy deputy) are terrific, as is what amounts to a cameo by Lon Chaney, Jr.  In fact, though audiences tend to remember most Kelly's role as Kane's conflicted wife, it's really Jurado's performance that stands out, as she ably plays the streetsmart Mexican immigrant who is shunned by the community (the subtext being that running the local saloon and brothel is the only work the community permits an ""outsider"" like her to do.)  That films like ""Rio Bravo"" and the ""Dirty Harry"" series would essentially take the Kane character and give him a different political slant is a testament to the endurance of Fred Zinnemann's western outting.

He considers running away, more from a desire to avoid unnecessary trouble than from cowardice - though he is afraid - but he realizes that running is not a solution in this case. Kane doesn't overcome fear; he faces it. Each man in town has his own reasons for not helping Kane, displaying various aspects of passivity, apathy, fear, greed, and rationalization.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 7]","Fred Zinnemann's ""High Noon"" is a Western that looks at loyalty, cowardice, and the use of violence from a different perspective.  Do not bother to look for any heroic masculine feats in this film for there are none to be found.Trouble ensues soon after Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) marries Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly).  Waiting at the railroad station are three henchmen who are awaiting the arrival of  Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a killer that Kane had sent to prison.  Miller has been recently freed and is scheduled to arrive on the noon train.  The townspeople know that the former convict is out for revenge so they urge Kane to flee.  However, the lawman decides to stand his ground even though no one else is willing to help him.One can clearly see the influence of the McCarthy hearings at work in Carl Foreman's screenplay for ""High Noon.""  The film's townspeople are clearly more interested in self-preservation than courageously standing up to the evil that is about to descend upon them.  One by one, they give in to their base fears and paranoia until Kane is left all by himself to face his foes - a victim of circumstances.  Further distinguishing this film is its determination to de-mystify the Old West.  Preceding Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992) by decades, ""High Noon"" covers much of the same ground by shining its spotlight on the less desirable aspects of human nature and looking upon frontier violence with disdain.

An aging lawman gets married to a sweet angelic woman and decides to give up his dangerous life chasing lawbreakers. But on the same day that he gets married and is supposed to give up his star, a man he sent up the river (and naturally vowed to kill him one day) is arriving in town on the noon train. And he ain't alone. Not a bad premise for a western. But that's just the start.This movie also has a truly perfect cast who all give great performances. In fact, many people's carreers in movies started or were greatly furthered by this film. But great acting deserves great direction, cinematography, and editing. And that my friends, is where this movie truly shines. Practically every time you enter a room, you can see a clock on the wall, ticking away the time till noon. From the time that the Marshall enters the town the second time, everything practically unrolls in real time. And as his situation gets more and more desperate and the time of reckoning gets closer and closer, the tension is fantastic.The music (which won a well-deserved academy award) is the icing on the cake. The movie opens with a ballad pretty much telling you the entire plot in a few verses. This song plays again and again in key sequences. This may seem redundant to some, but to me this just heightens the emotional pull. And when the marshall walks into the saloon and the same song is being played on the piano...it's just perfect. This song is the theme of the movie, and adds a great surrealistic element to an already awesome movie.Of course this review would not be complete if I did not at least one or two words about the dvd itself. Well the sound is excellent. Crisp and clean. But the picture is amazing. This movie and the French version of Beauty and the Beast (released by the mighty Criterion) are the two finest examples of black and white picture perfection I have ever seen. The picture is so CLEAN. There are some who feel that dvds can actually surpass the quality of movies seen in a theater, dvds like this are the reason why.

40806,A2D63RN5LF14R2,0782008348,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[7, 8]","Olive Film's 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition of High Noon (1952) presents this critically lauded, still controversial western masterpiece in a Hi-Def transfer that renders all other home video versions obsolete.The Stanley Kramer production, tightly directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman, earned the hatred of 1950s McCarthyists, including John Wayne and Howard Hawks, who were so outraged they made Rio Bravo (1959) as a right-wing response. Wayne went further than that, teaming up with Hollywood Gossip mogul Hedda Hopper and the House Un-American Activities Committee to run Foreman out of the country. Foreman moved to England and never returned. Wayne forever boasted of forcing the writer into exile. Kramer, responding to accusations that High Noon was anti-American, tried to get Foreman's name taken off the credits. Gary Cooper intervened on Foreman's behalf, making Kramer's effort unsuccessful, but Kramer had better luck forcing Foreman to sell his part of their company. So much for loyalty under pressure: ironic, given the film's theme of civic morality.The biggest offense of the film, for Wayne and his fellow extremist kooks, was the final shot of Will Kane supposedly dropping his marshal's badge in the dust and stomping on it. Wayne saw symbolism aplenty, but his faulty vision was filtered through a lens of Cold War paranoia and exaggeration.[1] Will Kane merely dropped the badge. He never stepped on it. The other offense was the portrayal of the townspeople as a greedy, self-cannibalizing lot, a hypocritical church community who argue their way out of communal (and personal) loyalty. Wayne and Hawks' Rio Bravo depicted, in sharp contrast, a town full of old-fashioned buddy-buddy camaraderie. If Wayne and Hawks were alive today they might have rethought their depiction, because High Noon could served as an apt snapshot of contemporary division. It's a good thing that actor/director team didn't live to see the 21st century, though, because despite the intent behind Rio Bravo, and despite its occasional tendency towards sentimental phoniness, it remains, along with High Noon, one of the standout westerns in the genre's greatest decade.[2]One cannot approach High Noon without addressing its political themes, both within the film's text and those raised in its aftermath. Along with writer Formean, co-star Lloyd Bridges and cinematographer Floyd Crosby were also awarded with temporary blacklists until the FBI cleared them of Communist affiliations. The fifty-one year old Gary Cooper was engaged in an affair with his twenty-three year old co-star Grace Kelly (putting an end to Coop's affair with Patricia Neal.) Kelly's fling with the long established Republican protected her from McCarthyism's scrutiny. Cooper was friendly with the HUAC, and testified before them (without ever naming names), but he only did what was expected of him, then returned to his top priority of resuming his romance with a future princess.Cooper was in Europe by the time the Academy Awards Ceremony rolled around and asked Wayne to accept the award of Best Actor on his behalf, should he happen to win. Of course, he did, and the Duke did a prompt, public about-face in his acceptance speech: ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of. Coop and I have been friends hunting and fishing for more years than I like to remember. He's one of the nicest fellows I know. And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off horses in pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport about all this sportsmanship, I'm going back and find my business manager, agent, producer, and three-name writers and find out why I didn't get High Noon instead of Cooper.""[3]The speech renders Wayne a hypocrite, since seeing potential red from the outset, it was he who first refused the role of Marshal Will Kane, thus paving the path for Gary Cooper in the part.[4] Yet, despite Wayne's standing as a precursor of Rush Limbaugh's pharisaical aggression, he can, perhaps, best be summed up in an assessment I was privy to in a screening of Red River (1948). The host, an erudite writer, had this to say about Wayne: ""I met the Duke's son Patrick. Unlike his dad, Patrick is a thorough gentleman; pleasant and courteous. Unfortunately, he also differs from his dad when it comes to acting because Patrick's a lousy actor. His dad was a great actor and that's not really up for argument.""However, as skilled an actor as he was, Wayne as Will Kane would have been a loose right-wing cannon. Gary Cooper's brand of authentic conservatism merged seamlessly with his marshal. Cooper's laconic, weathered portrayal of internalized integrity shines through Zinnemann's opulent artistry.[5]Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower were among the film's fans. Reagan saw positive American values in the theme of an individual placing the safety of his peers above his own personal interests. When I first saw the film in my youth, prior to readings of political allegories, my interpretation of the film paralleled Reagan's.If Wayne has come to embody our idea of the snarling, mythological Westerner, Gary Cooper is our moderate, amorous Rino cowpoke. We readily accept his pairing with Grace Kelly's Quaker Amy Fowler (the ""darling Clementine"" of the film's theme song). Amy is a model of another form of extremism.  Amy's tragic past has rendered her a pacifist with a checklist, adhering to each dogmatic bullet point. Will cannot violate his conscience to succumb to any extreme ideology. We genuinely root for their reconciliation. Oddly, it is in its climax that we find High Noon is, in fact, a paradigm for conservative mythology. Once faced with physical threat, Amy's militant pacifism is, in fact, submitted as a futile, theoretical interpretation of Christian tenets. The townspeople, led by Mitchell, have their own ideological creeds, dictated primarily by the potential capital gains Frank Miller and his gang bring by their return to Hadleyville.Katy Jurado's Helen Ramirez is the literary female counterpart to Kelly's pure Virgin Mary. Helen, the tainted Magdalene, is, of course, a necessary contrast, and she steals every scene she is in, despite Zinnemann's efforts to highlight Kelly. Not unexpectedly, there was rivalry between the two actresses on set. Lon Chaney, Jr. shines in his role as the arthritic former lawman and Kane mentor, Martin Howe. Chaney acts with such effective pathos that one wished producers had realized his greater potential as a character actor, rather than as a B grade horror star. Lloyd Bridges' portrayal of self-serving deputy Harvey Pell is less effective, occasionally stiff in line readings, and a noticeable case of miscasting. Lee van Cleef,  debuting here, was originally cast in the role of Pell, but he would not surgically alter his nose, which producers thought ""too villainous looking.""  Instead, Cleef was relegated to playing one of the thugs, setting him on the path to a wonderfully typecast career.Editor Elmo Williams' work here is exemplary and, with much ballyhoo, he cut the film to play out in real time. Dmitri Tiomkin's score is perfectly synchronized, and Tex Ritter's theme song, which sold over a million copies, is so iconic that every singer tackling it since then has rendered a pale imitation.Zinnemann and Crosby intentionally shot High Noon in stark black and white. Zinnemann valiantly fought to keep media mogul Ted Turner's filthy colorizing hands off the film. Alas, Zinnemann lost and Turner, with Republic Pictures, produced an asinine colorized version for television. Therein lies the difference between celluloid and the corporal world. In the latter, sometimes the bad guys win.*Due to John Wayne's interpretation of this scene, he and fellow right wing extremist Ward Bond bullied Gary Cooper into backing out of a planned independent production company with Forman and producer Robert Lippert. [&#8617;]*The American Film Institute lists High Noon second in its list of top ten westerns. First is John Ford's The Searchers (1956) with Wayne. Two other films starring Wayne made the list: Red River at number five and Ford's Stagecoach (1939) at number nine. [&#8617;]*The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was as hypocritical as Wayne, awarding the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B. DeMille's dreadful The Greatest Show On Earth (1952), in order to appease Joseph McCarthy and the right-wing campaign launched against High Noon. This snub is, justifiably, seen as one of the many examples of the Academy's irrelevancy. [&#8617;]*Gregory Peck was next offered the role after Wayne refused it. Peck also declined the part, feeling it too closely resembled The Gunfighter (1950), which he had just made. Peck later counted the decision as his biggest career mistake. However, Peck, ever the gentleman, admitted he could not have played the part as well as Cooper. Charlton Heston, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and Kirk Douglas were also offered the role and declined it. [&#8617;]*Zinnemann and makeup artist Gustaf Norin gave Cooper no makeup in order accentuate the actor's inherent sense of anguish.

40807,A2VGV2WOEPDPRW,0782008348,The Curmudgeon,"[2, 3]","This traditional western with its iconic title is the best American movie ever made, both cinematically and culturally.Cinematically, the movie enhances the suspense by using its now famous techniques of the ticking clock and the empty railway station waiting for the main criminal to arrive.  Gary Cooper does a great job in playing the stoical marshal.  The realism is enhanced by accidental events such as when the marshal and the criminals confront each other.  The music adds to the effect by employing a catchy theme song instead of an overbearing orchestra.But the main effect of the movie is cultural.  The movie evokes a mythical past of the lone American hero confronting evil.  In real life many of the townspeople, if not most, would have supported the marshal.  But the rugged individualism the movie portrays is a part of American culture that is rapidly disappearing.There is also a romantic subplot where the marshal resists his new bride's nagging to leave town and this may have been the last time any man in America was able to resist any nagging.  The new bride initially leaves but then returns and helps the marshal kill the criminals at the very end.Today individualism is being replaced by group identity where the favored groups are race (except white), gender (except male), sexual orientation (except heterosexual), religion (except Christianity), and ethnicity (except European).",5,LESSON IN AMERICAN CULTURE,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,1407,"['traditional', 'western', 'iconic', 'title', 'best', 'American', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'cinematically', 'culturally.Cinematically', 'movie', 'suspense', 'using', 'now', 'famous', 'techniques', 'ticking', 'clock', 'empty', 'railway', 'station', 'waiting', 'main', 'criminal', 'arrive', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'stoical', 'marshal', 'realism', 'enhanced', 'accidental', 'events', 'such', 'when', 'marshal', 'criminals', 'confront', 'other', 'music', 'effect', 'employing', 'catchy', 'theme', 'song', 'instead', 'overbearing', 'orchestra.But', 'main', 'effect', 'movie', 'cultural', 'movie', 'mythical', 'past', 'lone', 'American', 'hero', 'confronting', 'evil', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'townspeople', 'not', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'supported', 'marshal', 'rugged', 'individualism', 'movie', 'part', 'American', 'culture', 'rapidly', 'also', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'where', 'marshal', 'new', 'bride', 'nagging', 'leave', 'town', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'last', 'time', 'man', 'America', 'was', 'able', 'resist', 'nagging', 'new', 'bride', 'initially', 'then', 'returns', 'marshal', 'kill', 'criminals', 'very', 'end.Today', 'individualism', 'being', 'replaced', 'group', 'identity', 'where', 'favored', 'groups', 'are', 'race', 'white', 'gender', 'male', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'heterosexual', 'religion', 'Christianity', 'ethnicity', 'European']",N/A

The west looks desolate in this movie. And little action. That's a warning to all teens who think that something has to blow up every few minutes.This a Frank Capra western, except unlike ""It's A Wonderful Life"" where the friends come to rescue to hero, everyone forgets the heroe. The emphasis is placed on building suspense and great characterization.  Sure they talk about what a good man he is, but noone wants to help except...  It has a short documentary as an extra. It's a shame that an audio commentary couldn't be provided by the some living character actors. Also I wish they could have shown two scenes that were deleted from the film.

Itwent something like this:""'High Noon?'  I hate that movie.""The interviewer did a double take.  Why? he asked.""Because the Gary Cooper character is a joke.  He's notserious about his work.  He's not a professional.  Grace Kellysaves his lily-livered guts.""Aha!Mr. Hawks and I are not the only ones dissatisfiedwith 'High Noon.'  I recall that screenwriter William Goldman('Adventures In The Screen Trade') also holds it in low esteem.Now I'm not overly fond of the ""unbeatable"" heroes of theso-called Spaghetti westerns.  Nor am I favorable to JohnWayne's overbearing screen persona when the film ismediocre.  ""Unbeatable"" western heroes are just too darn, well,unbeatable.  Not to mention too unflappable.  Not to mentiontoo expert at their trade by half, able to hit bad guys all daylong and half a mile away with a rusty Colt peacemaker.  But, atthe same time, no other western has ever had a hero as pale andinsufferable as Gary Cooper in 'High Noon.'Sure, if three guys were coming to kill me, I'd do justwhat he does in the movie.  I'd run around looking for help, andwhen I didn't get it, I'd end up just like Mr. Cooper; I'd bepretty worried.  Scratch that.  I'd be wetting my boots.So it's a perfectly reasonable argument that 'High Noon' isone darn realistic western.But who wants to watch Gary Cooper run around like that fortwo hours?Sheesh.PEOPLE WHO'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE: someone who has never seenany other sort of western; Grace Kelly sure is pretty to lookat.PEOPLE WHO WONT LIKE THIS MOVIE: action fans.",2,Another Well-Reviewed Movie I Didn&#65533;t Like.,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1755,"['April', '6', '2002I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exact', 'quote', 'once', 'saw', 'adocumentary', 'filmmaker', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'wherein', 'greatdirector', 'finally', 'explained', 'why', ""'High"", 'Noon', 'onesupposedly', 'classic', 'western', 'have', 'patience', 'Itwent', 'something', 'Noon', 'hate', 'movie', 'interviewer', 'did', 'double', 'take', 'Why', 'asked', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'character', 'joke', 'notserious', 'work', 'not', 'professional', 'Grace', 'lily-livered', 'guts.', 'Aha', 'Mr', 'Hawks', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'dissatisfiedwith', ""'High"", 'Noon', 'recall', 'screenwriter', 'William', 'Goldman', 'Screen', 'Trade', 'also', 'low', 'esteem.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'unbeatable', 'heroes', 'theso-called', 'Spaghetti', 'westerns', 'am', 'favorable', 'JohnWayne', 'overbearing', 'screen', 'persona', 'when', 'film', 'ismediocre', 'Unbeatable', 'western', 'heroes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'well', 'unbeatable', 'Not', 'mention', 'too', 'unflappable', 'Not', 'mentiontoo', 'expert', 'trade', 'half', 'able', 'hit', 'bad', 'guys', 'daylong', 'mile', 'away', 'rusty', 'Colt', 'peacemaker', 'atthe', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'western', 'ever', 'had', 'hero', 'pale', 'andinsufferable', 'Gary', 'Cooper', ""'High"", 'Noon', ""'Sure"", 'three', 'guys', 'were', 'coming', 'kill', ""'d"", 'do', 'justwhat', 'movie', ""'d"", 'run', 'around', 'looking', 'help', 'andwhen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'just', 'Mr.', 'Cooper', ""'d"", 'bepretty', 'worried', 'Scratch', ""'d"", 'be', 'wetting', 'boots.So', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'argument', 'Noon', 'isone', 'darn', 'realistic', 'western.But', 'who', 'watch', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'run', 'around', 'fortwo', 'hours', 'Sheesh.PEOPLE', 'WHO', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seenany', 'other', 'sort', 'western', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'sure', 'pretty', 'lookat.PEOPLE', 'WHO', 'WONT', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'action', 'fans']",N/A

40817,AP3B615GM191G,0782008348,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Despite the fact that ""High Noon"" is highly regarded as one of the greatest western films of all-time, it took me a long time to actually spin it up in the DVD player.  Probably because, to be honest, I was afraid it would be little more than a ""stock western"".  When I did ""give in"", however, I now completely understand the praise.For a basic plot summary, ""High Noon"" is a story about an Old West town that is about to see the return of Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a convicted gunslinger freshly released and ready to wreak havoc on the town that sent him ""up the river"".  Waiting for him is a posse led by fellow no-gooder Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef).  In the town itself, Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just been wed to his beloved Amy (Grace Kelly) and about to begin the honeymoon when he gets news of Frank Miller's return.  Kane's high moral standards compel him to stick around for the confrontation, but will he be able to rally the town around him to clean up the streets once again?There are two reasons why I consider this movie to be a cinematic classic:First, it is actually a very complex film in terms of thematic material.  It is most definitely NOT the traditional 1950s western flick.  The movie really delves into themes of humanity and how people react in times of great stress.  Seemingly every single person or group of people in the film have their own set of values, and at some point they are all called into question as the intensity ratchets up.Secondly, the tension just continues to pick up as ""high noon"" (the train's destination time) approaches.  With every passing moment, the weight of the day pushes down harder on Marshal Kane.The acting in this movie is also top-notch.  Besides those already mentioned above, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado play great auxiliary roles, adding their own little niches to the overall tapestry.Overall, I really had no expectations going into this movie and by the time the credits rolled I was thoroughly impressed by the human drama.  This is one of the most entertaining westerns ever made, provided you enjoy movies with great character interactions.  Yes, you do get the gunfights and the typical western iconic landmarks, but you also get top-notch drama to boot.",5,An Exercise In Filmmaking,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2262,"['fact', 'High', 'Noon', 'highly', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'western', 'films', 'all-time', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'actually', 'spin', 'up', 'DVD', 'player', 'Probably', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'stock', 'western', 'When', 'did', 'give', 'however', 'now', 'completely', 'understand', 'praise.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'High', 'Noon', 'story', 'Old', 'West', 'town', 'see', 'return', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Ian', 'MacDonald', 'convicted', 'gunslinger', 'freshly', 'released', 'ready', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'town', 'sent', 'river', 'Waiting', 'posse', 'led', 'fellow', 'no-gooder', 'Jack', 'Colby', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'town', 'Marshal', 'Will', 'Kane', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'just', 'been', 'wed', 'beloved', 'Amy', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'begin', 'honeymoon', 'when', 'news', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'return', 'Kane', 'high', 'moral', 'standards', 'compel', 'stick', 'around', 'confrontation', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'rally', 'town', 'around', 'clean', 'up', 'streets', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'cinematic', 'classic', 'First', 'actually', 'very', 'complex', 'film', 'terms', 'thematic', 'material', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'traditional', '1950s', 'western', 'flick', 'movie', 'really', 'themes', 'humanity', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'times', 'great', 'stress', 'Seemingly', 'single', 'person', 'group', 'people', 'film', 'have', 'own', 'set', 'values', 'point', 'are', 'called', 'question', 'intensity', 'up.Secondly', 'tension', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'high', 'noon', 'train', 'destination', 'time', 'approaches', 'passing', 'moment', 'weight', 'day', 'down', 'harder', 'Marshal', 'Kane.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'also', 'top-notch', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'play', 'great', 'auxiliary', 'roles', 'adding', 'own', 'little', 'niches', 'overall', 'tapestry.Overall', 'really', 'had', 'expectations', 'going', 'movie', 'time', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'human', 'drama', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'provided', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'great', 'character', 'interactions', 'Yes', 'do', 'get', 'gunfights', 'typical', 'western', 'iconic', 'landmarks', 'also', 'get', 'top-notch', 'drama', 'boot']",N/A

I was expecting a good Western, but I was not expecting a multi-layered, metaphorical and psychological drama.  This is genre storytelling at its finest, using the setting of a Western to tell a more far-reaching story.Short, ringing in at only 84 minutes, &quot;High Noon&quot; manages to capture a complete tale in glances, unspoken dialog, gestures and implied content.  Filmed in real time, there is a tense urgency as well as a melancholy finality.  The clock ticks towards high noon, and nothing will stop it.Gary Cooper is excellent as a retiring hero, past his prime but still willing to stand up for his principles.  He is a living example of the saying &quot;better to light a single candle than to curse the darkness.&quot;  He risks everything to light his candle.  Grace Kelley is just beautiful.
