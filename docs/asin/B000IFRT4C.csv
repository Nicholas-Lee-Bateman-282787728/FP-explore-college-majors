1020326,A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B000IFRT4C,G. Kroener,"[35, 42]","Here we are, almost 11 years after Seinfeld's 7th season first aired, and it's as fresh and as vibrant as ever.This is Larry David's last season as a producer/writer for the series, and what a ride he gives us as a farewell gift! I think it's fair to say that Seinfeld's 7th year rivals the 4th in the race for Best Season.It doesn't have the amateurish charme of the first two, neither does it have the great blossoming of all the characters like season 3, nor has it moments of pure genius like in season 4.But the great merit of this one is that it's as consistently funny as maybe no other season. It feels like watching a single 8 hours episode, and this is just great.Plus, season 7 has an arc, which is just as huge and ambitious as the one from season 4. Honestly, when George uttered the line ""Will you marry me?"", I was a little worried, but my fears were proven unjustified.After the pretty outlandish, almost cartoon- like storylines from season 6, I was a little worried that the engagement- storyline wouldn't be taken serious enough, but I was surprised: it was handled with such sensitivity that the result is Seinfeld's most mature, yet hilarious, season. I realised how different this season was going to be right in ""The Engagement"", when George is sitting at the beach, watching other married couples being happy, and I suddenly felt this enormous burst of honest compassion for him. Or when George yells ""Please! I have so little!"" in ""The Seven"".This refreshing maturity also is the consequence of centering the entire season around George, who is clearly the most complex and developed character.Jerry always was almost exclusively there to function as a springboard for stories, to sum them up and deliver the terse comedic punch. You base an arc on him, you get exactly the same, only stretched over an entire season. Exactly that was season 4, the creation of the Jerry show was a springboard for all kind of stories.But basing an arc on George is different. His character is purely based on his psychology, his way of thinking, so putting him in the centerfold very much affects the writing and the storylines. The consequence is that over the course of season 7, his paranoia and cynicism becomes the spirit of the show; and obviously this was so successful that it stayed like this.And that also meant a return to the down-to-earth tone of seasons 1-4, which is very much a contrast to the sometimes silly edgyness of seasons 6 and parts of season 5.The difference is that earlier years were about ""nothing"", and season 7 is about ""nothing, the way you see it when you're engaged"". Who could forget the ""worlds colliding"" episode? ""They're KILLING Independent George!""Of course the other characters are still there and very much alive. Elaine is now working for the J. Peterman catalogue, and Jerry, as usual, is just there to give the storylines a certain drive. His stellar moments are again the face-to-face conversations with George.Kramer is Kramer, what else can you say? But it's worth noting that his ""action"" storylines are becoming alot more elaborate, like in ""The Secret Code"", where he's becoming a fireman.Another character change happens with Newman. He used to be there as some sort of device for a ""quick kill"", a sort of comedic sidekick to Kramer or a deus ex machina (like in ""The Raincoats""). Here he's often used as a parody on the godfather or generally a funny fat version of a mafia boss.Generally, let me say that the writers were at that point very aware that the show was famous for its merciless cynicism and its selfish characters. And they took full advantage of that. The show became snappier than ever. Seinfeld's final two season could have also been as great as season 7, but their fatal mistake was that they had snappiness for the snappiness' sake, but the stories themselves weren't snappy.When George says ""So what?"" and Jerry answers ""You're right, I forget who I'm talking to"", the show parodises itself.But season 7 is brilliant, it's Seinfeld's last truly great year, and yadda yadda yadda, make sure you pick it up!",5,"When ""Seinfeld"" became ""Costanza""",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,4088,"['Here', 'are', 'almost', '11', 'years', 'Seinfeld', '7th', 'season', 'first', 'aired', 'fresh', 'as', 'vibrant', 'ever.This', 'Larry', 'David', 'last', 'season', 'producer/writer', 'series', 'what', 'ride', 'farewell', 'gift', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'Seinfeld', '7th', 'year', '4th', 'race', 'Best', 'Season.It', ""n't"", 'have', 'amateurish', 'charme', 'first', 'two', 'have', 'great', 'blossoming', 'characters', 'season', '3', 'moments', 'pure', 'genius', 'season', '4.But', 'great', 'merit', 'one', 'as', 'consistently', 'maybe', 'other', 'season', 'watching', 'single', '8', 'hours', 'episode', 'just', 'great.Plus', 'season', '7', 'arc', 'just', 'huge', 'ambitious', 'one', 'season', '4', 'Honestly', 'when', 'George', 'uttered', 'line', 'Will', 'marry', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'fears', 'were', 'proven', 'unjustified.After', 'pretty', 'outlandish', 'almost', 'cartoon-', 'storylines', 'season', '6', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'engagement-', 'storyline', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'enough', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'handled', 'such', 'sensitivity', 'result', 'Seinfeld', 'most', 'mature', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'season', 'realised', 'how', 'different', 'season', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'Engagement', 'when', 'George', 'sitting', 'beach', 'watching', 'other', 'married', 'couples', 'being', 'happy', 'suddenly', 'felt', 'enormous', 'burst', 'honest', 'compassion', 'when', 'George', 'Please', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'Seven', '.This', 'refreshing', 'maturity', 'also', 'consequence', 'centering', 'entire', 'season', 'George', 'who', 'clearly', 'most', 'complex', 'developed', 'character.Jerry', 'always', 'was', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'function', 'springboard', 'stories', 'sum', 'up', 'deliver', 'terse', 'comedic', 'punch', 'base', 'arc', 'get', 'exactly', 'same', 'only', 'stretched', 'entire', 'season', 'Exactly', 'was', 'season', '4', 'creation', 'Jerry', 'show', 'was', 'springboard', 'kind', 'stories.But', 'basing', 'arc', 'George', 'different', 'character', 'purely', 'based', 'psychology', 'way', 'thinking', 'so', 'putting', 'centerfold', 'very', 'much', 'writing', 'storylines', 'consequence', 'course', 'season', '7', 'paranoia', 'cynicism', 'spirit', 'show', 'obviously', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'stayed', 'this.And', 'also', 'meant', 'return', 'down-to-earth', 'tone', 'seasons', '1-4', 'very', 'much', 'contrast', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'edgyness', 'seasons', '6', 'parts', 'season', '5.The', 'difference', 'earlier', 'years', 'were', 'nothing', 'season', '7', 'nothing', 'way', 'see', 'when', ""'re"", 'engaged', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'worlds', 'colliding', 'episode', ""'re"", 'KILLING', 'Independent', 'George', 'course', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'Elaine', 'now', 'working', 'J.', 'Peterman', 'catalogue', 'Jerry', 'usual', 'just', 'there', 'give', 'storylines', 'certain', 'drive', 'stellar', 'moments', 'are', 'again', 'face-to-face', 'conversations', 'George.Kramer', 'Kramer', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'worth', 'noting', 'action', 'storylines', 'are', 'becoming', 'alot', 'more', 'elaborate', 'Secret', 'Code', 'where', 'becoming', 'fireman.Another', 'character', 'change', 'Newman', 'used', 'be', 'there', 'sort', 'device', 'quick', 'kill', 'sort', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'Kramer', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'Raincoats', 'Here', 'often', 'used', 'parody', 'godfather', 'generally', 'funny', 'fat', 'version', 'mafia', 'boss.Generally', 'let', 'say', 'writers', 'were', 'point', 'very', 'aware', 'show', 'was', 'famous', 'merciless', 'cynicism', 'selfish', 'characters', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'show', 'became', 'snappier', 'ever', 'Seinfeld', 'final', 'two', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'as', 'great', 'season', '7', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'was', 'had', 'snappiness', 'snappiness', 'sake', 'stories', 'were', ""n't"", 'snappy.When', 'George', 'what', 'Jerry', 'answers', ""'re"", 'right', 'forget', 'who', ""'m"", 'talking', 'show', 'itself.But', 'season', '7', 'brilliant', 'Seinfeld', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'year', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'make', 'sure', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

This season is best known as the season where George would enter the long term engagement with Susan but thankfully this storyline would not go into sugary sweet territory like it would on other sitcoms. The most memorable episode for the casual fan is &#34;The Soup Nazi&#34; and while this is a fantastic episode, there are several on the same level, some even on the same disc such as &#34;The Maestro&#34; and the &#34;Hot Tub&#34;, as well as the other discs such as &#34;The Caddy&#34;, &#34;The Secret Code&#34;, &#34;The Rye&#34;, &#34;The Doll&#34;, and both two-part episodes, &#34;The Cadillac&#34; and &#34;The Bottle Deposit&#34;. Always a memorable character, Kramer became even more ridiculous, performing great scenes as the Movie Phone guy, his banter with both Newman and Jackie Chiles, and the funky scene where he wears the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Like the other discs, the special features are top notch with tons of bloopers and commentaries. All told, Season 7 of Seinfeld is a classic and a must own.",5,Their last fantastic season,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,1307,"['Season', '7', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'hit', 'park', 'was', 'also', 'creator', 'Larry', 'David', 'season', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'offered', 'plenty', 'great', 'episodes', 'was', 'last', 'one', 'where', 'nearly', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'memorable', 'season', 'best', 'known', 'season', 'where', 'George', 'would', 'enter', 'long', 'term', 'engagement', 'Susan', 'thankfully', 'storyline', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'territory', 'would', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'most', 'memorable', 'episode', 'casual', 'fan', '34', 'Soup', 'Nazi', '34', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'are', 'several', 'same', 'level', 'even', 'same', 'disc', 'such', '34', 'Maestro', '34', '34', 'Hot', 'Tub', '34', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'discs', 'such', '34', 'Caddy', '34', '34', 'Secret', 'Code', '34', '34', 'Rye', '34', '34', 'Doll', '34', 'two-part', 'episodes', '34', 'Cadillac', '34', '34', 'Bottle', 'Deposit', '34', 'memorable', 'character', 'Kramer', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'performing', 'great', 'scenes', 'Movie', 'Phone', 'guy', 'banter', 'Newman', 'Jackie', 'Chiles', 'funky', 'scene', 'where', 'Amazing', 'Technicolor', 'Dreamcoat', 'other', 'discs', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'tons', 'bloopers', 'commentaries', 'told', 'Season', '7', 'Seinfeld', 'classic', 'must', 'own']",N/A
1020338,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000IFRT4C,Jonathan Appleseed,"[0, 1]","Season 7 was arguably Seinfeld's best season. I recently finished watching it straight through, episode-by-episode, and found myself still, a decade and several hundred syndication views later, laughing my head off. The Soup Nazi was just as funny today as he was when the episode aired on November 2, 1995The season started strong, with Jerry and George realizing that ""we're not men"", that their lives were pathetic, and that they were doomed to live for eternity alone, single, and making silly, meaningless conversation at the coffee shop. George took this to heart, and to everyone's great surprise, asked his ex-girlfriend Susan (""I thought she was a lesbian?"" ""It didn't take"") to marry him. To our greater surprise, she said yes, and when George called his parents to tell them of his engagement, Susan told Estelle that she was very much in love with her son, to which Estelle replied, ""May I ask why?"" It was a clear bell announcing to Seinfeld's fans that their comic timing was still spot on.And it was. While already having displayed brilliance in past seasons, they seemed to reach their apex here, where the requisite multiple story-lines all tied in together, built off of each other, *made sense*, the end result being a near perfect show. This was a quality the show would lose the very next season.Jerry didn't begin and end every show with his stand-up, and that was welcome for me. I have never cared for his stand up. I don't think he's funny outside of the TV show. The 4.5 star rating of his final Broadway show demonstrate that others think differently. To each their own.Looking back, it's hard to imagine that Julia Louise-Dreyfus only walked away with one Emmy win (seven nominations) in nine years. But when you consider just some of her competition over the years: Christine Baranski from Cybill, Lisa Kudrow from Friends, Kristen Johnsen from Third Rock from the Sun, and Lauire Metcalf from Roseanne, it becomes easier to appreciate the difficulty of winning that award when these actresses were portraying such memorable characters.The extras on this DVD set really make it stand out. The inside looks offer fascinating insight, although the extras weren't captioned or subtitled. Some deleted scenes were better left deleted, while others were stronger and if time wasn't a factor (as it isn't on HBO and Showtime, for example) might have made a stronger show. You'll have to be the judge of that. I didn't listen to the Notes About Nothing. You *really* have to be an in-too-deep Seinfeld fan to watch an episode just to hear actor/writer/director commentary (not that there's anything wrong with that).Allow me to digress for a moment and step outside the purview of this review. The only thing that hangs over the DVD release (and all Seinfeld DVD releases) and that which mars its perfection is knowing that Jerry Seinfeld's three co-stars had to push and shove to negotiate for residuals for doing the extra material on the DVDs. It's bad enough that they receive only standard Screen Actors Guild residuals for the reruns in syndication, which have netted the three co-stars each roughly $[...] (according to Jason Alexander in 2004). Compare that to the hundreds of millions that their brethren receive for similar work in lesser sitcoms, the five hundred million that Larry David made off the series, and Seinfeld's net worth of $[...] billion dollars. Not that Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld don't deserve the lions share - they created the show, and Larry's contributions to the show were immeasurable. However, without the talents of each individual actor, the fans of Seinfeld wouldn't have had such a marvelous treasure. The show wouldn't have been the same without their unique chemistry. There should have been some parity.",5,Arguably Seinfeld's very best season,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,3772,"['Season', '7', 'was', 'arguably', 'Seinfeld', 'best', 'season', 'recently', 'finished', 'watching', 'straight', 'episode-by-episode', 'found', 'still', 'decade', 'several', 'hundred', 'syndication', 'views', 'later', 'laughing', 'head', 'Soup', 'Nazi', 'was', 'just', 'funny', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'episode', 'aired', 'November', '2', '1995The', 'season', 'started', 'strong', 'Jerry', 'George', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'not', 'men', 'lives', 'were', 'pathetic', 'were', 'doomed', 'live', 'eternity', 'alone', 'single', 'making', 'silly', 'meaningless', 'conversation', 'coffee', 'shop', 'George', 'took', 'heart', 'everyone', 'great', 'surprise', 'asked', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Susan', 'thought', 'was', 'lesbian', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'marry', 'greater', 'surprise', 'said', 'yes', 'when', 'George', 'called', 'parents', 'tell', 'engagement', 'Susan', 'told', 'Estelle', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'son', 'Estelle', 'replied', 'May', 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'clear', 'bell', 'announcing', 'Seinfeld', 'fans', 'comic', 'timing', 'was', 'still', 'spot', 'was', 'already', 'having', 'displayed', 'brilliance', 'past', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'reach', 'apex', 'here', 'where', 'requisite', 'multiple', 'story-lines', 'tied', 'together', 'built', 'other', '*made', 'sense*', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'near', 'perfect', 'show', 'was', 'quality', 'show', 'would', 'lose', 'very', 'next', 'season.Jerry', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'end', 'show', 'stand-up', 'was', 'welcome', 'have', 'never', 'cared', 'stand', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'funny', 'TV', 'show', '4.5', 'star', 'rating', 'final', 'Broadway', 'show', 'demonstrate', 'others', 'think', 'differently', 'own.Looking', 'back', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Julia', 'Louise-Dreyfus', 'only', 'walked', 'away', 'one', 'Emmy', 'win', 'seven', 'nominations', 'nine', 'years', 'when', 'consider', 'just', 'competition', 'years', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Cybill', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Friends', 'Kristen', 'Johnsen', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Lauire', 'Metcalf', 'Roseanne', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'difficulty', 'winning', 'award', 'when', 'actresses', 'were', 'portraying', 'such', 'memorable', 'characters.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'inside', 'offer', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'extras', 'were', ""n't"", 'captioned', 'subtitled', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'better', 'left', 'deleted', 'others', 'were', 'stronger', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'factor', ""n't"", 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'example', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'stronger', 'show', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'judge', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Notes', 'Nothing', '*really*', 'have', 'be', 'in-too-deep', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'watch', 'episode', 'just', 'hear', 'actor/writer/director', 'commentary', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', '.Allow', 'digress', 'moment', 'step', 'purview', 'review', 'only', 'thing', 'DVD', 'release', 'Seinfeld', 'DVD', 'perfection', 'knowing', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'three', 'co-stars', 'had', 'push', 'shove', 'negotiate', 'residuals', 'doing', 'extra', 'material', 'DVDs', 'bad', 'enough', 'receive', 'only', 'standard', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'residuals', 'reruns', 'syndication', 'have', 'netted', 'three', 'co-stars', 'roughly', '[', ']', 'according', 'Jason', 'Alexander', '2004', 'Compare', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'brethren', 'receive', 'similar', 'work', 'lesser', 'sitcoms', 'five', 'hundred', 'million', 'Larry', 'David', 'made', 'off', 'series', 'Seinfeld', 'net', 'worth', '[', ']', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Not', 'Larry', 'David', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'lions', 'share', 'created', 'show', 'Larry', 'contributions', 'show', 'were', 'immeasurable', 'However', 'talents', 'individual', 'actor', 'fans', 'Seinfeld', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'marvelous', 'treasure', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'unique', 'chemistry', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'parity']",N/A
1020339,AF93CIG6EZUWU,B000IFRT4C,Jonathan Luysterborghs,"[18, 23]","If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 70's.The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.

""Seinfeld"" follows the funny misadventures of stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld (Himself) and his close group of eccentric friends going through everyday life in New York City. In this hilarious season, Jerry's thoughtful gift lands his father under investigation for embezzling funds. George proposes to his former girlfriend Susan and desperately tries to postpone the engagement. Elaine adjusts her screening process to find worthy boyfriends when her method of birth control goes off the market. Kramer sues a gourmet coffee franchise over burns he suffered from sneaking hot coffee into a movie theater. ""Seinfeld"" was the popular creation of producer Larry David and stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld. In its seventh season, the NBC comedy sitcom continued to draw big ratings and become the top comedy sitcom on television. The episodes have some fun storylines, terrific humor and memorable recurring secondary characters. The seventh season features such standout episodes as ""The Sponge"", ""The Soup Nazi"" and the two-parter ""The Cadillac"".Like the previous volumes, Sony puts a lot of effort into ""Seinfeld: The Complete Seventh Season"". All 22 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 4-disc box set contains a well enhanced picture quality and a clear 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. The DVD menus are creative and appealing.

I like the arc of this season better than season six: the concept of George's engagement hovers omnipresent in the background during the entire season, and I think it works exceptionally well as a comic medium (I am especially enamored with Susan's ultimate departure from the cast.)Aside from the engagement arc, there are other works of comedy genius here that rival the best of the other seasons. ""The Soup Nazi"" has to be my personal favorite of the season, but ""The Shower Head"" provides the cast with wonderful opportunities for physical comedy (albeit through the unlikely medium of their hair), while ""The Rye"" and ""The Cadillac"" worked sublimely in combination. I found Michael Richard's character (and the Kramer-driven plotpoints) to become a bit more monotonous this season, but that may be due to the contrast with the exceptional characterizations from the other three principals.Of course there are plenty of extras (I especially like the ""Notes About Nothing"" feature) all of which are worth watching.

1020359,A1DANN3R216NBI,B000IFRT4C,"Snorre Smari Mathiesen ""Snorri Smari""","[1, 1]","First aired in 1995-96, season 7 of SEINFELD is often thought of as the pinacle of the show, made at a time when the characters were long since fully formed and being the last season in which co-creator Larry David was directly involved. In my opinion, season 7 also arguably contains the first few signs of the show's gradual demise towards the end, but these are still so far and between that the season, as a whole, still may be regarded as the most memorable, and funniest.First of all, of course, there's the ""arc"" aspect; though it's evident that the writers strove to make each episode capable of standing alone (with much success), throughout the season we follow George's engagement to Susan, which has its origins in a serious talk (!) between George and Jerry in the first episode, where they both declare that they are ""not men"" and would like to do something more with their lives, but which eventually leaves George more frustrated than ever before. It's interesting to notice how George invariably seems to be the character whose bad decisions and mishaps most visibly drive the show forward in new, unexpected directions; Kramer always has his new things going on, of course, but his projects seldom last for more than one episode at a time (that's part of the point with him and what makes him Kramer). Had the engagement story involved Jerry, Kramer or Elaine, it couldn't have been stretched as far; part of this may be explained with that George is the least sympathetic of the four major characters, but he is also, as many critics and reviewers have pointed out before me, the most versatile and recognizably human of them.Other than the continuity story, season 7 quite simply offers some of the very very best episodes; I do wonder if it's theoretically possible to possess even a tiny sense of humor and not laugh till it hurts with episodes like ""The Engagement,"" ""The Soup Nazi,"" ""The Seven,"" ""The Cadillac"" and ""The Invitations."" Things like George getting obsessed with the thought of naming his first-born child Seven, and becoming exasperated when someone else steals his idea...it's just so brilliant. Or the whole deal with ""The Rye"" (somehow, you may miss the opening credits of that episode and still sense that it's written by Larry David).It is true, I think, that season 7, despite all hilarity, provides some moments which come across as a tad ""cartoonish"" if one compares with the earlier seasons. Fortunately, these still involve Kramer and Newman for the most part, such as the former driving the back of a fire-truck. It would become a more serious problem in the last couple of seasons, after Larry David's departure, when such material increasingly revolved around the other, less exaggerated major characters; this is synonymous with virtually every other sitcom, as the creators simply feel a need to go further than before in search for new ideas, and this often affects the credibility of the characters. Even so, the situation is still far from critical in season 7 of SEINFELD, and it has provided me with perhaps more loud laughs than any of the others (though it's hard competition).",5,"Some moments a tad ""cartoonish,"" but all in all perhaps their very best",1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,3136,"['First', 'aired', '1995-96', 'season', '7', 'SEINFELD', 'often', 'thought', 'pinacle', 'show', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'characters', 'were', 'long', 'fully', 'formed', 'being', 'last', 'season', 'co-creator', 'Larry', 'David', 'was', 'directly', 'involved', 'opinion', 'season', '7', 'also', 'arguably', 'first', 'few', 'signs', 'show', 'gradual', 'demise', 'end', 'are', 'still', 'so', 'far', 'season', 'whole', 'still', 'may', 'be', 'regarded', 'most', 'memorable', 'funniest.First', 'course', 'arc', 'aspect', 'evident', 'writers', 'strove', 'make', 'episode', 'capable', 'standing', 'alone', 'much', 'success', 'season', 'follow', 'George', 'engagement', 'Susan', 'origins', 'serious', 'talk', 'George', 'Jerry', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'declare', 'are', 'not', 'men', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'lives', 'eventually', 'George', 'more', 'frustrated', 'ever', 'interesting', 'notice', 'how', 'George', 'invariably', 'be', 'character', 'bad', 'decisions', 'mishaps', 'most', 'visibly', 'drive', 'show', 'forward', 'new', 'unexpected', 'directions', 'Kramer', 'always', 'new', 'things', 'going', 'course', 'projects', 'seldom', 'last', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'time', 'part', 'point', 'what', 'Kramer', 'Had', 'engagement', 'story', 'involved', 'Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'stretched', 'far', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'explained', 'George', 'least', 'sympathetic', 'four', 'major', 'characters', 'also', 'many', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'most', 'versatile', 'recognizably', 'human', 'them.Other', 'continuity', 'story', 'season', '7', 'quite', 'simply', 'very', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'do', 'wonder', 'theoretically', 'possible', 'possess', 'even', 'tiny', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'till', 'episodes', 'Engagement', 'Soup', 'Nazi', 'Seven', 'Cadillac', 'Invitations', 'George', 'getting', 'obsessed', 'thought', 'naming', 'first-born', 'child', 'Seven', 'becoming', 'exasperated', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'idea', 'just', 'so', 'brilliant', 'whole', 'deal', 'Rye', 'somehow', 'may', 'miss', 'opening', 'credits', 'episode', 'still', 'sense', 'written', 'Larry', 'David', '.It', 'true', 'think', 'season', '7', 'hilarity', 'moments', 'come', 'tad', 'cartoonish', 'one', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Fortunately', 'still', 'involve', 'Kramer', 'Newman', 'most', 'part', 'such', 'former', 'driving', 'back', 'fire-truck', 'would', 'become', 'more', 'serious', 'problem', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'Larry', 'David', 'departure', 'when', 'such', 'material', 'increasingly', 'revolved', 'other', 'less', 'exaggerated', 'major', 'characters', 'synonymous', 'virtually', 'other', 'sitcom', 'creators', 'simply', 'feel', 'need', 'go', 'further', 'before', 'search', 'new', 'ideas', 'often', 'credibility', 'characters', 'Even', 'so', 'situation', 'still', 'far', 'critical', 'season', '7', 'SEINFELD', 'provided', 'perhaps', 'more', 'loud', 'laughs', 'others', 'hard', 'competition']",N/A

The set has a season long story arc that starts with George getting engaged to former flame Susan, and ends with, well, if you don't already know, I'm not going to tell you.Everyone's seen the episodes so I'll get straight to the features.  There's a pretty good documentary on Larry David and why he chose to leave after this season.  There's also a mash up of all the clips Larry has appeared in throughout his run on the show.  Plus there are some deleted scenes of the real George Steinbrener who was supposed to make an appearance as himself, but they wisely cut him out.  The Inside Looks are interesting as always and makes you appreciate the craft of writing and putting together ideas for a sitcom that's not like any other.It seems like it took them a little longer to release this season, but overall, the features were worth the wait.  I've discovered one Easter Egg so far.  When you click Episodes on disc 2 (Elaine's disc) Select the silver item in the lost and found box and there's an additional short documentary on the supporting characters of the show and how being on Seinfeld affected their lives and careers.  Overall, a great season of a great show.On a side note, it dissapoints me that people are tagging this dvd set with words like racist, bigot and boycott.  I realize people aren't going to forget what happened this past year, but I hate to think that it puts that kind of taint on a show that ended its run long before the incident.

The three guys look a little thicker in particular George. (It may have been the fault of the show for George. It seems like everytime he was in Jerry's apartment this season he was eating and who knows how many takes they went through.) And Elaine's glamour makover makes her seem like a different person. It is as if the actress playing Elaine retired after season six and they hired a model that kind of looked like the original Elaine. That said, I do not think I will every get tired of this series, and also by the way, it is the best put together TV cd set I have ever seen, thanks.

1020369,A2CN5L2RZXXQ3H,B000IFRT4C,Yoav Fain,"[0, 0]","after purchasing and watching the whole seasons of the series and ""plowing""(watching million times) some of the seasons(seasons 4-9),i came to a definite conclusion that season 7 is the BEST season of the show and the most watchable too.unlike other seasons,which surely carry some briliant funny moments of their own,in this season every episode is an EPIC with its writing,great moments of laughs,ideas,the actors,the acting, and everything else that an episode can offer to the viewer. this results in that i enjoy watching every and each episode of this season for thousands of times and enjoy it to the fullest every time like i watch it first time-this happens to me only by watching this season cause in other seasons there are always few episodes that are lil bit weak in their whole story lines or only in some of the story line in an episode...its really easy to get hooked to this season for me.also in this season,Elaine is actually turning into a REAL WOMAN by all means.first,she got a brand new feminine look that including a pretty sexy hairdo of a real woman(not that boring wall of hair that ran 6 seasons),an hairdo that started to develope a lil bit in season 6's episode ""the face painter"" but reach its climax in season 7 and continue thru the rest of the seasons.Elaine also have really nice outfits in all the episodes of this season,especially some noteable outfits in ""the sponge"",""the caddy"",and ""the gum"" episode which makes her look like a real sexy woman.after being a weak,crying baby in season 6(especially in the last episode ""the understudy""),in season 7 Elaine becomes a strong assertive woman that knows what she wants and also a revengeful one in 2 episodes-""the soup nazi"" when she tells jerry assertively to get out of her way when he tries to convince her not to drive the soup nazi out of business with his recipes,and the last scene when she comes to the soup stand and confront the soup nazi,""the wig master"" when the seller from the clothes shop sleep at her house and she discovers that he deceived her by talking on the phone with his boss,she takes out scissors and looks in a vicious revengeful look(i really like that look on her face)at his pony tail and u can guess what she is goin to do...i really love the new fully developed Elaine character in this season,and she really makes this season for me.kramer is also gets revengeful in this season,revenging the cable guy in ""the cadillac"" episode-its an interesting side of kramer that unravel in this season.in addition,one of the genius ideas in the whole show appears in ""the calzone"" episode-Elaine meets a guy that have a genius method(""a dating loophole"") how to date a woman without getting rejected-he makes a bet on dinner with her,which he will eventually lose,and the woman will surely go to that dinner cause its the prize of the bet and isnt considered a date to her this way she wont refuse or reject the guy-this is one great method that can actually be excuted in reality and i was amazed from it lolin bottom line-this is the #1 season of the show,and season 6 is the #2(cause in season 6 the characters and storylines are not fully developed or deep).i mostly recommend watching season 7 in order to understand why seinfeld is the best show in tv history.the other seasons have some noteable episodes too,but they dont have awsome episodes in a row like in season 7,which made me(and still making me)watching this season over and over again-thank god its in a dvd format cause if it was in VCR like in old days,the cassettes would be ruined from watching so many times:)",5,the BEST season in the whole series,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3589,"['purchasing', 'watching',
