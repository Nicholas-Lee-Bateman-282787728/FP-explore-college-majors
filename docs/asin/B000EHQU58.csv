Clendenin,"[0, 0]","The case of this DVD boasts five festival awards and the promise of ""redemption"" for its characters, but I was left wondering why on both counts. There are at least nine suicide scenes in this film, mainly imagined, but one of which is very real. Teenager Mason grows up in a horribly dysfunctional family where dinners are characterized by a raging father (Luke), a people-pleasing, pill-popping, and alcoholic mother (Leila), and a crazy uncle (Bobby) who thinks that World War II is raging and who dies in an asylum. A tragic accident strikes that feeds on their dysfunction. Enter a young girl (Danny) whose mom is a passive-aggressive, drifter single parent. Danny enjoys drugs, alcohol, and admits that she has ""a thing for things that aren't good for me."" But put Danny and Mason in a lush meadow with a brilliant blue sky, undulating grass, and an idyllic pond, and what do you get? Redemption? No. On an improbable fishing trip with his son Mason, father Luke described every character in this film: ""You wake up one day and nothin's the way it's supposed to be. So you try to keep goin', takin' down the people you love the most right with ya. And for some reason you can't admit that until you've already lost them.""",4,losing those we love,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1227,"['case', 'DVD', 'five', 'festival', 'awards', 'promise', 'redemption', 'characters', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'counts', 'are', 'least', 'nine', 'suicide', 'scenes', 'film', 'mainly', 'imagined', 'one', 'very', 'real', 'Teenager', 'Mason', 'up', 'horribly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'where', 'dinners', 'are', 'characterized', 'raging', 'father', 'Luke', 'people-pleasing', 'pill-popping', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Leila', 'crazy', 'uncle', 'Bobby', 'who', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'raging', 'who', 'asylum', 'tragic', 'accident', 'strikes', 'feeds', 'dysfunction', 'Enter', 'young', 'girl', 'Danny', 'mom', 'passive-aggressive', 'drifter', 'single', 'parent', 'Danny', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'thing', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'put', 'Danny', 'Mason', 'lush', 'meadow', 'brilliant', 'blue', 'sky', 'undulating', 'grass', 'idyllic', 'pond', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Redemption', 'No', 'improbable', 'fishing', 'trip', 'son', 'Mason', 'father', 'Luke', 'described', 'character', 'film', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'nothin', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'try', 'keep', 'goin', 'takin', 'down', 'people', 'love', 'most', 'right', 'ya', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'already', 'lost']",Dandelion
973007,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B000EHQU58,Hulka,"[0, 0]","Fans of Vincent Karthieser will enjoy this movie and his portrayal of a sensitive young man dealing with a dysfunctional family in rural Idaho. But the movie doesn't rise to the dramatic quality of Kartheiser's other movies, ""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia"" or ""The Unsaid"", or his recent appearance in the TV series, ""Angel"".This is probably the worst script Vincent's had to deal with since the terrible ""Heaven Sent"". Many of Vincent's roles border on the melodramatic, but this script goes over the top. Also, Kartheiser's co-star, Tara Manning is another mis-match for Kartheiser. The problem is not Manning, but the script. Manning is believable as the stereotypical poor white ""trailer park"" girl she is asked to play, it's unbelievable that a girl like that would find anything in common with the sensitive, quiet dreamer that Kartheiser plays.Another problem is that roles like this are getting a bit repititious for Kartheiser, and this lousy script doesn't offer Kartheiser anything new to work with. I've been bewitched by Vincent Kartheiser's on-screen personae for a long time. Vincent's movies and TV roles have this re-occurring theme of sensitive loner (most suburban teenaged) boy struggling with teenage alienation and angst. Crime and Punishment in Suburbia, The Unsaid, TV series Angels...all the same thing. This script just seems to reinforce the stereotype, and poor Kartheiser can't rise above script and his performance comes off as a rip-off of earlier roles.Another problem is that Kartheiser is getting a little ""long in the tooth"" to play roles like this. As Kartheiser gets older, he's losing the androgenous beauty that has fascinated viewers in the past, and we see the tell-tale facial hair that we've not seen before in his other movies. While Kartheiser still got the ability to move us with the sincerity and honesty of his portrayals of the alienated, tortured suburban teenage boy, at some point, he's got to move on to more adult roles.Despite the defects, I felt it was still worth it to spend another 90 odd minutes with Vincent, and I think you'll feel the same!",4,Vincent Kartheiser fans will love this movie despite it's limitations,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,2107,"['Fans', 'Vincent', 'Karthieser', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'dealing', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'rural', 'Idaho', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rise', 'dramatic', 'quality', 'Kartheiser', 'other', 'movies', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Suburbia', 'Unsaid', 'recent', 'appearance', 'TV', 'series', 'Angel', '.This', 'probably', 'worst', 'script', 'Vincent', 'had', 'deal', 'terrible', 'Heaven', 'Sent', 'Many', 'Vincent', 'roles', 'border', 'melodramatic', 'script', 'top', 'Also', 'Kartheiser', 'co-star', 'Tara', 'Manning', 'mis-match', 'Kartheiser', 'problem', 'not', 'Manning', 'script', 'Manning', 'believable', 'stereotypical', 'poor', 'white', 'trailer', 'park', 'girl', 'asked', 'play', 'unbelievable', 'girl', 'would', 'find', 'anything', 'common', 'sensitive', 'quiet', 'dreamer', 'Kartheiser', 'plays.Another', 'problem', 'roles', 'are', 'getting', 'bit', 'repititious', 'Kartheiser', 'lousy', 'script', ""n't"", 'offer', 'Kartheiser', 'anything', 'new', 'work', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bewitched', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'on-screen', 'personae', 'long', 'time', 'Vincent', 'movies', 'TV', 'roles', 'have', 're-occurring', 'theme', 'sensitive', 'loner', 'most', 'suburban', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'struggling', 'teenage', 'alienation', 'angst', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Suburbia', 'Unsaid', 'TV', 'series', 'Angels', 'same', 'thing', 'script', 'just', 'reinforce', 'stereotype', 'poor', 'Kartheiser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rise', 'script', 'performance', 'off', 'rip-off', 'earlier', 'roles.Another', 'problem', 'Kartheiser', 'getting', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'play', 'roles', 'Kartheiser', 'older', 'losing', 'androgenous', 'beauty', 'fascinated', 'viewers', 'past', 'see', 'tell-tale', 'facial', 'hair', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'Kartheiser', 'still', 'got', 'ability', 'move', 'sincerity', 'honesty', 'portrayals', 'alienated', 'tortured', 'suburban', 'teenage', 'boy', 'point', 'got', 'move', 'more', 'adult', 'roles.Despite', 'defects', 'felt', 'was', 'still', 'worth', 'spend', '90', 'odd', 'minutes', 'Vincent', 'think', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same']",Dandelion

973009,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000EHQU58,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 9]","Love stories about teenagers (although the people in this movie are more like...18, which still makes them a teenager but whatever) are usually pretty bad. In fact, almost all of them are. Rarely does a movie come around that really captures any of the emotion or raw angst of young love. Don't get me wrong, there are some...But few. This movie does that in it's own weird way. It's disturbing, haunting, beautiful, poignant, and true. And that's freaking talent, OK? Vincent Kartheiser ('Another Day in Paradise') plays Mason, a silent teenager who keeps to himself and watches his parents fight constantly and watch his uncle sink into an abyss probably caused by Vietnam. One day Mason meets Danny (Taryn Manning, 'Hustle & Flow') and it affects him. But then an accident takes Mason away for a couple years; when he returns, nothing is really different and Danny is still in town. She reveals to him that she's thought about him, the feeling's mutual and two begin to date. Add more some more tragedy and a wonderful semi-ending, you have ""Dandelion."" Since this won't give away anything, in the very beginning of the movie we're treated to an opening scene with Mason walking through a field before putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. This scene works and yet it doesn't. It prepares you for the worst, but then in the next 15 minutes the scene is repeated twice giving us the feeling that Mason may be imagining it. It does work as a way of telling you ""This is not a happy-feel good movie."" But at the same time, it drops a few hints. Mason's killing himself? Something bad must happen...Could it be? Hmm. A lot of people may figure out the end, but that really doesn't matter. The last young love story I saw that was this good was ""All the Real Girls"" (although that film was far superior), even though both films are completely different while tackling almost the same subject matter. Although, for the record, there are no (even possibly imagined) suicides in ""All the Real Girls."" Anyway, that film definitely captured conversations, fascinations, and quirks about young love; and this film is definitely...Well, a movie. They both tackle the subject in an intelligent, poignant way. Some of the dialogue between Mason and Danny is a little too movieish, and Danny's character needed more screen time. But, and I know I'm repeating myself, this a beautiful film that deserves an audience.GRADE: A",5,A Beautiful Film,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,2425,"['Love', 'stories', 'teenagers', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'more', '18', 'still', 'teenager', 'are', 'usually', 'pretty', 'bad', 'fact', 'almost', 'are', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'come', 'really', 'emotion', 'raw', 'angst', 'young', 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'few', 'movie', 'own', 'weird', 'way', 'disturbing', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'true', 'freaking', 'talent', 'OK', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'Day', 'Paradise', 'plays', 'Mason', 'silent', 'teenager', 'who', 'watches', 'parents', 'fight', 'constantly', 'watch', 'uncle', 'sink', 'abyss', 'probably', 'caused', 'Vietnam', 'One', 'day', 'Mason', 'Danny', 'Taryn', 'Manning', ""'Hustle"", 'Flow', 'then', 'accident', 'Mason', 'away', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'nothing', 'really', 'different', 'Danny', 'still', 'town', 'thought', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'two', 'begin', 'date', 'Add', 'more', 'more', 'tragedy', 'wonderful', 'semi-ending', 'have', 'Dandelion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', ""'re"", 'treated', 'opening', 'scene', 'Mason', 'walking', 'field', 'putting', 'gun', 'mouth', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'scene', 'yet', ""n't"", 'worst', 'then', 'next', '15', 'minutes', 'scene', 'repeated', 'twice', 'giving', 'feeling', 'Mason', 'may', 'be', 'imagining', 'work', 'way', 'telling', 'not', 'happy-feel', 'good', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'few', 'hints', 'Mason', 'killing', 'Something', 'bad', 'must', 'happen', 'Could', 'be', 'Hmm', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'figure', 'out', 'end', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'last', 'young', 'story', 'saw', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'Real', 'Girls', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'even', 'films', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'tackling', 'almost', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'record', 'are', 'even', 'possibly', 'imagined', 'suicides', 'Real', 'Girls', 'Anyway', 'film', 'definitely', 'captured', 'conversations', 'fascinations', 'quirks', 'young', 'love', 'film', 'definitely', 'Well', 'movie', 'tackle', 'subject', 'intelligent', 'poignant', 'way', 'dialogue', 'Mason', 'Danny', 'little', 'too', 'movieish', 'Danny', 'character', 'needed', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'know', ""'m"", 'repeating', 'beautiful', 'film', 'audience.GRADE']",Dandelion

I have to return it to the library tonight.The movie is sad, and artistically so. This sadness it presents is very quiet, lingering sadness, and people who are naturally tuned into emotion of others will be affected most by it. By the way, I do not glorify sadness, yet, every now and then it's OK to taste it, only to keep one's capacity to feel sadness alive.The movie is about  a bunch of dead-end people, in a somehow dead-end community/town. Very depressing, stagnant surrounding. A psychotherapist will find a lot of areas that the characters can work on. The movie has quite a few stereotype, small town scenes--the lame parties, teenage drugs, broken families, single mother competing with the pubescent daughter, and series of painful outcomes which could easily have been avoided in a different set up of life.The ending could be a scene to desperation as well as a hope of new beginning.The movie has the vibe of a short story, that takes one to a different world, to lives of others and makes one feel sorry about vulnerability of human heart. If you are as sensitive as I am, you would think about similar characters around you, and wished you could do something.Recommended to those who are mature enough to observe sadness without being overwhelmed by it.Otherwise, the overall desolation of heart-space may linger too heavily on some.By the way,the prairie scene was beautiful.Seeing two young love birds getting close and finding each other cute as well.I am not a love-story type person, but I was touched by quite a few scenes.",4,Beautiful pieces of sadness,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1651,"['did', 'not', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'finished', 'type', 'credits', 'are', 'still', 'screen', 'have', 'return', 'library', 'tonight.The', 'movie', 'sad', 'artistically', 'so', 'sadness', 'very', 'quiet', 'lingering', 'sadness', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'naturally', 'tuned', 'emotion', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'most', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'glorify', 'sadness', 'yet', 'now', 'then', 'OK', 'taste', 'only', 'keep', 'one', 'capacity', 'feel', 'sadness', 'alive.The', 'movie', 'bunch', 'dead-end', 'people', 'somehow', 'dead-end', 'community/town', 'Very', 'depressing', 'stagnant', 'surrounding', 'psychotherapist', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'areas', 'characters', 'can', 'work', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'stereotype', 'small', 'town', 'scenes', 'lame', 'parties', 'teenage', 'drugs', 'broken', 'families', 'single', 'mother', 'competing', 'pubescent', 'daughter', 'series', 'painful', 'outcomes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'different', 'set', 'life.The', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'scene', 'desperation', 'as', 'well', 'hope', 'new', 'beginning.The', 'movie', 'vibe', 'short', 'story', 'one', 'different', 'world', 'lives', 'others', 'one', 'feel', 'sorry', 'vulnerability', 'human', 'heart', 'are', 'as', 'sensitive', 'am', 'would', 'think', 'similar', 'characters', 'wished', 'could', 'do', 'something.Recommended', 'who', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'observe', 'sadness', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'it.Otherwise', 'overall', 'desolation', 'heart-space', 'may', 'linger', 'too', 'heavily', 'some.By', 'way', 'prairie', 'scene', 'was', 'beautiful.Seeing', 'two', 'young', 'love', 'birds', 'getting', 'close', 'finding', 'other', 'cute', 'well.I', 'am', 'not', 'love-story', 'type', 'person', 'was', 'touched', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes']",Dandelion
973011,A11RDKJK0VCA0K,B000EHQU58,katherine,"[2, 4]","Set in the rolling fields of the Midwest, Dandelion chronicles the brief romance of two unhappy teenagers in a small town. Mason (Vincent Karthesier) is a suicidal teen with a dysfunctional family life. His angry father (Arliss Howard) is running for county council in a futile attempt to give meaning to his life; his mother is passive-aggressive, and takes her husband's emotional abuse with the repressed anger of 50s housewife, she also has a drinking problem and is a pill-popper; Mason's uncle, a Viet vet who's still traumatized, also lives with them. In the scenes with the family we get a sense of how deeply decayed this town has become and how that has infected the people. it's a dead end and everyone is clawing away at the last chance of happiness.Into this world, moves Danny, a girl with a single mother, who constantly puts her down. Danny at first seems well-adjusted enough, but we soon sees she's also trying to escape an unhappy home life. Danny and Mason start a flirtation. But then Mason goes to jail. When he returns it seems to be a new start, he and Danny become a couple, he starts to get along better with his parents...but as the opening scene hints...this happiness isn't going to last long.The film opens with a scene of Mason putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. That scene instantly pulls you in, but the rest of the film feels slightly limp because of it never caught captures the raw emotion of the first scene. The problem is the unoriginality of the premise. Perhaps if it had been made a few years earlier, this film would have been considered great. But there's been a trend in indie drama the last couple of years, of langorous films showcasing self-destructive youth, with dysfunctional families, in the seemingly idyll milieus (e.g. Tully, American Beauty, Mean Creek). Dandelion suffers as a result of that comparison, as well as from a rather weak script. There are also too many emotional land-mines; it seems everyone has a problem and an emotionally climatic scene. In a film this intimate, this seems forced. Losing one or two of those scenes would have made the dramatic impact of the others much more powerful.Still, Dandelion is worth a watch. As on it's own it's a good drama. It also has great performances from the entire cast, mostly the supporting ones. Arliss Howard is particularly noteworthy as the father, who's uncontrollable anger is something that repulses him and the audience, yet he still manages to garner sympathy. He resembles Kevin Spacey but without the sarcastic defense mechanism. Mare Winningham is perfect as mason's unhappy mother, who tries too hard to be perfect. The two leads aren't really required to do much.

I'm all for depressing movies, the issue I had with this was more so that it seemed a little forced... these people weren't depressed for reasons I could relate to in any way; their conditions seemed largely self imposed.This is the type of film you need to watch when you're in the right mood, and I'll fully admit that it's a possibility if I'd have watched this another time (maybe when I was a tad more on the reflective side) I might have liked it quite a bit more.

973013,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000EHQU58,Timothy Kearney,"[10, 10]","A young teenaged boy has a gun in his hand, tears in his eyes, and pulls the trigger. This is the alarming image we encounter at the beginning of DANDELION. It captures our attention and keeps it throughout the entire film. We want to know what happens, hoping for the best but fearing the worst.DANDELION is the story of Mason Mullich, a young man living a lackluster life in the wheat belt. We get a sense his life is going nowhere. His only friend Eddie is the younger brother of a drug addict who tortures the two. His mother Layla is an alcoholic and his father Luke is a Willie Lowman-esque type who believes he's bigger than his small life. Things begin to change for the better for Mason when a young woman named Danny moves to the town but  positive changes get quickly thwarted when Mason finds himself being charged for a crime he did not commit. Things once again improve for Mason who begins to know love through his relationship with Danny, but the film ends with an unexpected tragedy.In the hands of some  actors, DANDELION could be either deadly or clich&eacute;. A strong cast keeps this from happening. Vincent Kartheiser gives a compelling performance as Mason. He is at times edgy and at other times innocent. We believe he experiences first love and feel for him in his loss. We wonder how someone who is constantly used and betrayed can still be so loving and forgiving, but Kartheiser makes it all believable. Mare Winningham as Layla, Mason's troubled mother is believable. In some ways she seems to be perfect when she's cast as a mistreated woman. Arliss Howard is well cast as Luke, Mason's father. We wonder how he can live with himself, yet he does and while we can revile him at times, we do feel some sympathy. Taryn Manning is well cast as Danny. Her character may not be the best developed in the film (the women can be caricatures at times), she does have a certain sweetness which makes us feel for her and understand why Mason is drawn to her. This is the first film for director Mark Milgard and it's an excellent effort.
