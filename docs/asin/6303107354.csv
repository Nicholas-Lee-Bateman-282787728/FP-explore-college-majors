357091,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6303107354,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","This bleak, sparse film from Ingmar Bergman focuses on a disillusioned, increasingly skeptic Lutheran priest called Thomas (Gunnar Bjorstrand, who's excellent) administering the gospel in a Swedish village to a very small congregation. He's unable to accept the love offered him by the plain school teacher Marta (Ingrid Thulin, also very good), and incapable to offer the conviction of his faith to save from suicide a fisherman called Jonas (Max von Sydow) troubled by the prospect of a nuclear war(incidentally, this was filmed just before the Cuban missile crisis).This must have been a very personal film by Bergman (the son of a stern Lutheran priest, the director lost his religious faith as a young man). There are a lot of biblical allusions and religious discussions (we have a doubting Thomas, a fisherman called Jonas). One can nitpick here and there (one could wonder why the younger Marta is so attracted to the middle aged, aloof Thomas, or whether Jonas motivation to kill himself is credible), but if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, the minimalist direction and the great acting made for a powerful movie. Reportedly this was Ingmar Bergman choice as the favorite film he made.",4,Powerful Bergman,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1205,"['bleak', 'sparse', 'film', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'disillusioned', 'increasingly', 'skeptic', 'Lutheran', 'priest', 'called', 'Thomas', 'Gunnar', 'Bjorstrand', 'who', 'excellent', 'administering', 'gospel', 'Swedish', 'village', 'very', 'small', 'congregation', 'unable', 'accept', 'love', 'offered', 'plain', 'school', 'teacher', 'Marta', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'incapable', 'offer', 'conviction', 'faith', 'save', 'suicide', 'fisherman', 'called', 'Jonas', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'troubled', 'prospect', 'nuclear', 'war', 'incidentally', 'was', 'filmed', 'just', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', '.This', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'Bergman', 'son', 'stern', 'Lutheran', 'priest', 'director', 'lost', 'religious', 'faith', 'young', 'man', 'are', 'lot', 'biblical', 'allusions', 'religious', 'discussions', 'have', 'doubting', 'Thomas', 'fisherman', 'called', 'Jonas', 'One', 'can', 'nitpick', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'could', 'wonder', 'why', 'younger', 'Marta', 'so', 'attracted', 'middle', 'aged', 'aloof', 'Thomas', 'Jonas', 'motivation', 'kill', 'credible', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'minimalist', 'direction', 'great', 'acting', 'made', 'powerful', 'movie', 'Reportedly', 'was', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'choice', 'favorite', 'film', 'made']",Winter Light VHS
357092,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303107354,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I have been steadily becoming a huge Ingmar Bergman fan, and my adoration for him grows with almost every new film I see of his.  With `Nattvardsgasterna' (or `Winter Light' for us English speakers) he has turned that adoration into full blown love.  The film is delightfully simple yet undeniably profound.  Bergman effortlessly delivers to us a remarkable tale of faith (or lack thereof) and the heavy weight that it can bring down on a person.The film takes place over a single day, in between a morning and an evening sermon.  Tomas Ericsson, the Pastor at a small (and rapidly dwindling) church is battling his own inner demons (his faith is a subject of major debate) but he is still called upon by a local parishioner who feels as though his anxieties have gotten the better of him.  Fearing a nuclear holocaust will befall him, he craves to end his life.  Unable to help him, Ericsson is soon troubled by knowledge that this young man did indeed take his life, causing the Pastor to confront his internal struggles head on in the films brilliant second half.Not only is the Pastor dealing with his personal relationship with God, but he has to contend with the affections of the local schoolteacher, Marta Lundberg.  His relationship with Marta is complicated (there love is a bitter one), and this is brought to a head as they confront each others feelings head on.Their final confrontation is as brutal as they come.The performances here really make this film a must see.  Both Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Bjornstrand are flawless, captivating the audience by creating two very human portraits.  It has been stated that Bjornstrand in particular loathed the character of Tomas, but I feel that it was in that loathing that this tremendous tour-de-force was born.  You can see the struggle on his face to accept who he is, and that struggle is not forced but a very real interpretation.  Perhaps it is the depiction of Gunnar's own struggle with accepting this character, but the turmoil that is present is beyond words.  Thulin is also a force here as the conflicted and confused Marta.  Her desires for Tomas are destroying her internally, and she wears that very well.Like I said, their final confrontation is devastating.I want to also make a quick mention of Max von Sydow, who is all sorts of phenomenal here.  He barely says a word, yet his performance is unforgettable.  Such a rich and truly emotionally gut-wrenching portrayal of personal abandonment.The film may be simple as far as actual plot points are concerned, but the emotional gamut runs very deep here.  The subject of faith is attacked head on in a very subtle yet powerful manor.  As Tomas battles his own hypocrisy we, the audience, are given the opportunity to relate (and yes, we can relate) to his plight.  Religion is a huge part of life, but who has not at one time or another begun to doubt our faith?  Bergman portrays that human struggle for closure masterfully here.  There are few films so honest they make us ashamed of our feelings.  This is one of those kinds of films.",5,I love it when a director realizes that less can be so much more...,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3061,"['have', 'been', 'steadily', 'becoming', 'huge', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'fan', 'adoration', 'almost', 'new', 'film', 'see', 'Nattvardsgasterna', 'Winter', 'Light', 'English', 'speakers', 'turned', 'adoration', 'full', 'blown', 'love', 'film', 'delightfully', 'simple', 'yet', 'undeniably', 'profound', 'Bergman', 'effortlessly', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'faith', 'lack', 'thereof', 'heavy', 'weight', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'person.The', 'film', 'place', 'single', 'day', 'morning', 'evening', 'sermon', 'Tomas', 'Ericsson', 'Pastor', 'small', 'rapidly', 'dwindling', 'church', 'battling', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'faith', 'subject', 'major', 'debate', 'still', 'called', 'upon', 'local', 'parishioner', 'who', 'anxieties', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'Fearing', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'will', 'befall', 'end', 'life', 'Unable', 'help', 'Ericsson', 'soon', 'troubled', 'knowledge', 'young', 'man', 'did', 'indeed', 'take', 'life', 'causing', 'Pastor', 'confront', 'internal', 'struggles', 'head', 'films', 'brilliant', 'second', 'half.Not', 'only', 'Pastor', 'dealing', 'personal', 'relationship', 'God', 'contend', 'affections', 'local', 'schoolteacher', 'Marta', 'Lundberg', 'relationship', 'Marta', 'complicated', 'love', 'bitter', 'one', 'brought', 'head', 'confront', 'others', 'feelings', 'head', 'final', 'confrontation', 'as', 'brutal', 'come.The', 'performances', 'here', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'Gunnar', 'Bjornstrand', 'are', 'flawless', 'captivating', 'audience', 'creating', 'two', 'very', 'human', 'portraits', 'been', 'stated', 'Bjornstrand', 'particular', 'loathed', 'character', 'Tomas', 'feel', 'was', 'loathing', 'tremendous', 'tour-de-force', 'was', 'born', 'can', 'see', 'struggle', 'face', 'accept', 'who', 'struggle', 'not', 'forced', 'very', 'real', 'interpretation', 'Perhaps', 'depiction', 'Gunnar', 'own', 'struggle', 'accepting', 'character', 'turmoil', 'present', 'words', 'Thulin', 'also', 'force', 'here', 'conflicted', 'confused', 'Marta', 'desires', 'Tomas', 'are', 'destroying', 'internally', 'very', 'said', 'final', 'confrontation', 'devastating.I', 'want', 'also', 'make', 'quick', 'mention', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'sorts', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'barely', 'word', 'yet', 'performance', 'unforgettable', 'rich', 'truly', 'emotionally', 'gut-wrenching', 'portrayal', 'personal', 'abandonment.The', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'as', 'far', 'actual', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'concerned', 'emotional', 'gamut', 'very', 'deep', 'here', 'subject', 'faith', 'attacked', 'head', 'very', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'manor', 'Tomas', 'own', 'hypocrisy', 'audience', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'relate', 'yes', 'can', 'relate', 'plight', 'Religion', 'huge', 'part', 'life', 'who', 'not', 'one', 'time', 'begun', 'doubt', 'faith', 'Bergman', 'human', 'struggle', 'closure', 'masterfully', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'so', 'honest', 'make', 'ashamed', 'feelings', 'one', 'kinds', 'films']",Winter Light VHS

I haven't seen this movie on TV or video, but I know that on a small screen this effect would be lost and only the story would be left.And the story is a typical Bergman tale of nihilism, in this case a small village parish priest has lost most of his congregation and his own faith, and is unable to deal with his own problems, let alone those of his flock.  But he still carries on, an empty shell unwilling to leave the church and face the world, or the love of the woman who cares for him.

His wife, whom he has loved more than anything, has died 5 years ago, and with her went his own desire to live. Another woman who loves him cannot win his love in return. A man deeply troubled by the threat of nuclear annihilation comes to him for help; he can only speak to him of his own desolation - the man commits suicide. The parson ends up giving a service to an empty church, except for the hapless (or saintlike: could she be a Christ figure?) woman who loves him. Present is the typical Bergman bleakness, questioning passionately why we exist at all, why there is suffering, why God is silent. The final scene in the empty church except for the woman who loves him is thought-provoking, because we can't tell for sure whether the parson has failed as a preacher or not, but perhaps the best scene is the one in the car as the train passes drowning out what the parson is saying and panning to the coal cars that look like coffins.

357095,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,6303107354,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","NATTVARDSGAESTERNA (""The Communicants"", given the odd title ""Winter Light"" in English) was released in 1962 and is the second of Ingmar Bergman's ""chamber films"", a trilogy of separate efforts all marked by streamlined plots and a small cast exploring religious faith. Note that this film is available in aCriterion Collection box setalong with the other two films of the trilogy.NATTVARDSGAESTERNA is perhaps the smallest Bergman film in scale, taking place only over a single Sunday afternoon. As the film opens, the priest Thomas (Gunnar Bjoernstrand) presides over Sunday services with a meagre congregation. In a bold extended scene, Bergman captures the entire Lutheran liturgy from the ""Lamb of God"" to the dismissal. While the parishioners are mainly bored or distracted, Thomas seems iron-cast in his faith. But subsequent events reveal his tormenting uncertainty on the existence of God and the meaning of life. He proves unable to comfort a parishioner (Max von Sydow) consumed by fear of nuclear war, nor is he able to sustain his long but rocky relationship with the village schoolmarm Marta (Ingrid Thulin).While the characters experience great pain due to their inability to see God and relate with their fellow human beings, this is not an entirely bleak film. I have always seen an element of reconciliation in the closing shots, the one time in Bergman's oeuvre where hope is still clearly alive. This was, however, the last time he dealt with religious faith in any overt way. In TYSNADEN (""The Silence""), the last film of the chamber trilogy, any discussion of God is notable by its complete absence. Then, following the chamber trilogy, Bergman shifted his focus dramatically from religious faith to human relationships.Bergman broke new ground in cinematic storytelling here, and not only in the opening scene. When Thomas reads a letter from Marta, the text is delivered by her in soliloquy, speaking directly to the camera in two long shots. Indoor scenes are driven by dialogue, while in outdoor scenes, reflecting the grim Swedish winter, there is little talking at all.I consider this Bergman's greatest film not only in its flawless screenplay, but also in the achievements of his collaborators. The acting is superb, with Bjoernstrand giving the most convincing performance of his career. Sven Nykvist's camera work successfully conveys the emotions of the characters and the bleakness of their winter surroundings. The real power of the film to me is evident in that, though I've seen this film several times over the years, the questions it raises still provoke much thought.",5,"Perhaps Bergman's most thought-provoking film, and achieved with a remarkably spare cast and span",1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2606,"['NATTVARDSGAESTERNA', 'Communicants', 'given', 'odd', 'title', 'Winter', 'Light', 'English', 'was', 'released', '1962', 'second', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'chamber', 'films', 'trilogy', 'separate', 'efforts', 'marked', 'streamlined', 'plots', 'small', 'cast', 'exploring', 'religious', 'faith', 'Note', 'film', 'available', 'aCriterion', 'Collection', 'box', 'setalong', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'trilogy.NATTVARDSGAESTERNA', 'perhaps', 'smallest', 'Bergman', 'film', 'scale', 'taking', 'place', 'only', 'single', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'film', 'priest', 'Thomas', 'Gunnar', 'Bjoernstrand', 'Sunday', 'services', 'meagre', 'congregation', 'bold', 'extended', 'scene', 'Bergman', 'entire', 'Lutheran', 'liturgy', 'Lamb', 'God', 'dismissal', 'parishioners', 'are', 'mainly', 'bored', 'distracted', 'Thomas', 'iron-cast', 'faith', 'subsequent', 'events', 'reveal', 'tormenting', 'uncertainty', 'existence', 'God', 'meaning', 'life', 'unable', 'comfort', 'parishioner', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'consumed', 'fear', 'nuclear', 'war', 'able', 'sustain', 'long', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'village', 'schoolmarm', 'Marta', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'characters', 'experience', 'great', 'pain', 'due', 'inability', 'see', 'God', 'relate', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'entirely', 'bleak', 'film', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'element', 'reconciliation', 'closing', 'shots', 'one', 'time', 'Bergman', 'oeuvre', 'where', 'hope', 'still', 'clearly', 'alive', 'was', 'however', 'last', 'time', 'religious', 'faith', 'overt', 'way', 'TYSNADEN', 'Silence', 'last', 'film', 'chamber', 'trilogy', 'discussion', 'God', 'notable', 'complete', 'absence', 'Then', 'following', 'chamber', 'trilogy', 'Bergman', 'shifted', 'focus', 'dramatically', 'religious', 'faith', 'human', 'relationships.Bergman', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'opening', 'scene', 'When', 'Thomas', 'letter', 'Marta', 'text', 'delivered', 'soliloquy', 'speaking', 'directly', 'camera', 'two', 'long', 'shots', 'Indoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'driven', 'dialogue', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'reflecting', 'grim', 'Swedish', 'winter', 'little', 'talking', 'all.I', 'consider', 'Bergman', 'greatest', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'flawless', 'screenplay', 'also', 'achievements', 'collaborators', 'acting', 'superb', 'Bjoernstrand', 'giving', 'most', 'convincing', 'performance', 'career', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'camera', 'work', 'successfully', 'emotions', 'characters', 'bleakness', 'winter', 'surroundings', 'real', 'power', 'film', 'evident', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'questions', 'still', 'provoke', 'much', 'thought']",Winter Light VHS
357096,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303107354,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 3]","Winter Light (Nattvardsg&auml;sterna- literally The Communicants) is the middle film in Ingmar Bergman's Spider Trilogy (as it too references the God as a spider imagery), following Through A Glass Darkly, and preceding The Silence. Made in 1963, it represents a dramatic notching upward from the well made, but often melodramatic and symbolic, Through A Glass Darkly. Where the first film of the trilogy suffers from the overacting of Harriet Andersson, and some over the top displays of incest (for sex is a subject that the cerebral Bergman is at his weakest in handling) Winter Light is simply one of the greatest Socratic dialogues ever put to film, and as close to perfect a screenplay as a mortal is likely to produce. The acting, in every single role, is pitch perfect, yet Bergman regular Ingrid Thulin gives one of the great dominant female performances in film history, as M&auml;rta Lundberg, an atheistic substitute school teacher in a small town with a now unrequited love for a Lutheran Pastor named Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand), head of a church whose congregation has dwindled to a handful. The gorgeous Thulin is at her frumpiest and dowdiest looking in this film, and it seems that after an illness, she lost the affection of Tomas, with whom she had lived with for two years.Even Tomas does not believe any longer. His is a rote life, ever since the death of his wife four years earlier. He gives communion to a congregation that is bored- a boy licks the pews, others try to stay awake- including the church organist who checks his watch and reads, and the church hierarchy is dominated by money hungry apparatchiks, and M&auml;rta's swooning over Tomas is part of local gossip, which discomfits him. As he ends his noontime ceremony he is confronted by a fisherman, Jonas Persson (Max Von Sydow in a curly permanent wave) and his wife Karin (Gunnel Lindblom). The man is suffering from depression, ostensibly over the Chinese getting the atomic bomb. Of course, this is just a pretense, for we know Jonas is an unemployed fisherman, with three children and a fourth on the way, and even in the 1960s people were not so detached from reality to off themselves over an abstraction. Wisely, Bergman never reveals his true fears, as Tomas brushes him off and tells him to come back later, for a man to man talk. The Perssons leave, and then Tomas reads a letter M&auml;rta wrote him, confessing her love. It is a brilliant scene, shot with Thulin reading the words in two long takes, interspersed with a brief flashback. She addresses the camera so comfortably yet frankly that it puts the viewer in the place of Tomas, and we can later identify with his discomfit around this sincere, but needy and not altogether `there' woman, who has suffered from a variety of ills which she feels had led Tomas to be repulsed by her. Yet, we are also drawn to her by the quiet brilliance with which she utterly guts religion with her atheistic views.Bergman, apparently, has always stated that this was his only perfectly realized film, and while others may add to that number, there is no denying the excellence of this filmic masterwork, which shows that while Bergman had his roots in the theater, he also knew exactly how to use the filmic medium. The original Swedish title, as The Communicants, would seem to be better title for this film, which deals with connections and communications, and their fragility. While Through A Glass Darkly deals with people on an island, this aloneness is handled even more deftly here, where winter seems to be the defining metaphor- whether as the winter of religiosity or human kindness. Winter Light ranks with Wild Strawberries and Shame as one of Bergman's greatest works, which makes them essentials as films. It does not indulge in the technical masturbation of some later works, not does it rely too much on stagy overacting, as it deftly balances the inner and outer worlds of film and life. It is a truly great work of art.",5,Masterpiece,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,3992,"['Winter', 'Light', 'Nattvardsg', 'auml', 'sterna-', 'literally', 'Communicants', 'middle', 'film', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Spider', 'Trilogy', 'too', 'God', 'spider', 'imagery', 'following', 'A', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'preceding', 'Silence', 'Made', '1963', 'dramatic', 'notching', 'upward', 'well', 'made', 'often', 'melodramatic', 'symbolic', 'A', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'Where', 'first', 'film', 'trilogy', 'suffers', 'overacting', 'Harriet', 'Andersson', 'top', 'displays', 'incest', 'sex', 'subject', 'cerebral', 'Bergman', 'weakest', 'handling', 'Winter', 'Light', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'Socratic', 'dialogues', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'screenplay', 'mortal', 'likely', 'produce', 'acting', 'single', 'role', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'yet', 'Bergman', 'regular', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'one', 'great', 'dominant', 'female', 'performances', 'film', 'history', 'M', 'auml', 'Lundberg', 'atheistic', 'substitute', 'school', 'teacher', 'small', 'town', 'now', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Lutheran', 'Pastor', 'named', 'Tomas', 'Ericsson', 'Gunnar', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rnstrand', 'head', 'church', 'congregation', 'dwindled', 'handful', 'gorgeous', 'Thulin', 'frumpiest', 'dowdiest', 'looking', 'film', 'illness', 'lost', 'affection', 'Tomas', 'whom', 'had', 'lived', 'two', 'years.Even', 'Tomas', 'not', 'believe', 'longer', 'rote', 'life', 'ever', 'death', 'wife', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'communion', 'congregation', 'bored-', 'boy', 'pews', 'others', 'try', 'stay', 'awake-', 'including', 'church', 'organist', 'who', 'watch', 'reads', 'church', 'hierarchy', 'dominated', 'money', 'hungry', 'apparatchiks', 'M', 'auml', 'rta', 'swooning', 'Tomas', 'part', 'local', 'gossip', 'noontime', 'ceremony', 'confronted', 'fisherman', 'Jonas', 'Persson', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'curly', 'permanent', 'wave', 'wife', 'Karin', 'Gunnel', 'Lindblom', 'man', 'suffering', 'depression', 'ostensibly', 'Chinese', 'getting', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'course', 'just', 'pretense', 'know', 'Jonas', 'unemployed', 'fisherman', 'three', 'children', 'fourth', 'way', 'even', '1960s', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'detached', 'reality', 'off', 'over', 'abstraction', 'Wisely', 'Bergman', 'never', 'true', 'fears', 'Tomas', 'off', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'man', 'man', 'talk', 'Perssons', 'leave', 'then', 'Tomas', 'letter', 'M', 'auml', 'rta', 'wrote', 'confessing', 'love', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'shot', 'Thulin', 'reading', 'words', 'two', 'long', 'interspersed', 'brief', 'flashback', 'camera', 'so', 'comfortably', 'yet', 'frankly', 'viewer', 'place', 'Tomas', 'can', 'later', 'identify', 'discomfit', 'sincere', 'needy', 'not', 'altogether', 'there', 'woman', 'who', 'suffered', 'variety', 'ills', 'feels', 'had', 'led', 'Tomas', 'be', 'repulsed', 'are', 'also', 'drawn', 'quiet', 'brilliance', 'utterly', 'guts', 'religion', 'atheistic', 'views.Bergman', 'apparently', 'always', 'stated', 'was', 'only', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'film', 'others', 'may', 'add', 'number', 'denying', 'excellence', 'filmic', 'masterwork', 'Bergman', 'had', 'roots', 'theater', 'also', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'use', 'filmic', 'medium', 'original', 'Swedish', 'title', 'Communicants', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'better', 'title', 'film', 'connections', 'communications', 'fragility', 'A', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'deals', 'people', 'island', 'aloneness', 'handled', 'even', 'more', 'deftly', 'here', 'where', 'winter', 'be', 'defining', 'metaphor-', 'winter', 'religiosity', 'human', 'kindness', 'Winter', 'Light', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'Shame', 'one', 'Bergman', 'greatest', 'works', 'essentials', 'films', 'not', 'indulge', 'technical', 'masturbation', 'later', 'works', 'not', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'stagy', 'overacting', 'deftly', 'inner', 'outer', 'worlds', 'film', 'life', 'truly', 'great', 'work', 'art']",Winter Light VHS

This one of an alleged trio of Bergman films (known as ""The Ingmar Bergman trilogy"")--since I am not a big fan of Bergman, nor very knowledgeable, I can only tell you I'm glad I watched this film. It gives perspective on what Scandinavia was doing in the 1950s and early 1960s, something that is also not a specialty of mine.In this stark, quiet film, an Episcopalian priest, Pastor Ericsson (the marvelous Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand) is suffering mightily from a bad cold and the winter doldrums which I know are vicious in Sweden and Norway. He has been a widower for four years, and seems to be suffering a huge crisis of Christian faith. While he throws off the attentions of a former love (Marta, a weirdly intense performance by Ingrid Thulin) he pesters others about the nature of faith and belief.A very young Max von Sydow plays a suicidal father of three--when he goes to talk with the priest, he is instead assaulted by the priest's pain and lack of faith. ""I'm a bad priest,"" Pastor Ericsson whines to von Sydow. The priest is in such crisis that he chases von Sydow away!This was shot in a place called Dalarnas l&auml;n, which as I understand it is a village outside Stockholm. It was Bergman's intention to study life at these tiny church parishes and this film is his rendition of what he saw, a sort of depressed postcard of pure anguish that I notice is a hallmark of Swedish film. A blunt, emotionless indifference is also a Swedish hallmark I see in abundance here.Since I adore Swedish film but hardly see much of it, and as I said, I certainly missed the chance to grow up with these old European films, I'm kind of at a loss other than to compare it with American film--in fact, it is better compared with American TV. This is happily without music or a soundtrack to interrupt the meditative nature of why we need religious faith. Bergman also seems obsessed with one priest's journey into the dark night of the soul.Well, I am certainly happy I got to see and absorb this film. As a priest I just could not delve into Pastor Ericsson's world though I certainly understood all his feelings and his stated difficulties. When I look at the asking price for Criterion's release, as usual with Criterion I weep bitter tears and ask, ""Why so much?!""",3,"I agree with Bergman's wife: ""It's dreary...""",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,2378,"['WINTER', 'LIGHT', 'Orig', 'Nattvardsg', 'auml', 'sterna', 'Dir', 'Ingmar', 'Bergson', '1963', '83', 'minutes', 'Swedish', 'subtitles', 'one', 'alleged', 'trio', 'Bergman', 'films', 'known', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'trilogy', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Bergman', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'can', 'only', 'tell', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'film', 'perspective', 'what', 'Scandinavia', 'was', 'doing', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'something', 'also', 'not', 'specialty', 'mine.In', 'stark', 'quiet', 'film', 'Episcopalian', 'priest', 'Pastor', 'Ericsson', 'marvelous', 'Gunnar', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rnstrand', 'suffering', 'mightily', 'bad', 'cold', 'winter', 'doldrums', 'know', 'are', 'vicious', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'been', 'widower', 'four', 'years', 'be', 'suffering', 'huge', 'crisis', 'Christian', 'faith', 'attentions', 'former', 'love', 'Marta', 'weirdly', 'intense', 'performance', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'others', 'nature', 'faith', 'belief.A', 'very', 'young', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'suicidal', 'father', 'three', 'when', 'talk', 'priest', 'instead', 'assaulted', 'priest', 'pain', 'lack', 'faith', ""'m"", 'bad', 'priest', 'Pastor', 'Ericsson', 'whines', 'von', 'Sydow', 'priest', 'such', 'crisis', 'von', 'Sydow', 'away', 'was', 'shot', 'place', 'called', 'Dalarnas', 'l', 'auml', 'understand', 'village', 'outside', 'Stockholm', 'was', 'Bergman', 'intention', 'study', 'life', 'tiny', 'church', 'parishes', 'film', 'rendition', 'what', 'saw', 'sort', 'depressed', 'postcard', 'pure', 'anguish', 'notice', 'hallmark', 'Swedish', 'film', 'blunt', 'emotionless', 'indifference', 'also', 'Swedish', 'hallmark', 'see', 'abundance', 'here.Since', 'adore', 'Swedish', 'film', 'hardly', 'see', 'much', 'said', 'certainly', 'missed', 'chance', 'grow', 'up', 'old', 'European', 'films', ""'m"", 'kind', 'loss', 'other', 'compare', 'American', 'film', 'fact', 'better', 'compared', 'American', 'TV', 'happily', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'interrupt', 'meditative', 'nature', 'why', 'need', 'religious', 'faith', 'Bergman', 'also', 'obsessed', 'one', 'priest', 'journey', 'dark', 'night', 'soul.Well', 'am', 'certainly', 'happy', 'got', 'see', 'absorb', 'film', 'priest', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'delve', 'Pastor', 'Ericsson', 'world', 'certainly', 'understood', 'feelings', 'stated', 'difficulties', 'When', 'look', 'asking', 'price', 'Criterion', 'release', 'usual', 'Criterion', 'weep', 'bitter', 'tears', 'ask', 'Why', 'so', 'much']",Winter Light VHS
357099,AO4A961ZKHJPL,6303107354,"Enrique Torres ""Rico""","[1, 2]","For the most part I enjoyed this movie as it raises  many interesting questions concerning the  human existence and our at times, helplessness. The questions of faith, hope and the meaning of life are addressed and the viewer is left to ponder the meanings, as it seems the main character, pastor Thomas, has few answers. The story evolves around the widowed pastor Thomas, his small congregation which includes a woman named Marta, who is determined to be his new woman. Marta is on a quest, Thomas has self doubts about his life and whether or not God is a benevolent being who has the answers or if he is manifesting them through him. The movie seems to take an anti-war stance and the  religious ramifications are always presented, metaphysical questions abound. At one point the pastor addresses a frightened congregation members  concern over the A-bomb and China and he replies &quot;we're all haunted by the same fears, we must trust God.&quot; The problem is he has many doubts. He's a bit a hypocrite who is insecure possibly because of the loss of his wife. Marta, who is non-christian , loves the pastor but sees him as nuerotic and obsesssed and feels he is indifferent to Christ. The pastor has many issues to deal with including the suicide of a congregation member. The drama acted out for the three hour time period in the movie is pretty amazing. It starts slow, building eventuallly to the point where the viewer is amazed that so little time as passed in the story, it seems like it should have been a longerspan of time . Considering the time period that the film was made in, the height of the cold war, this piece of celluloid does take a stance but the metaphysical questions dominate the theme of the movie. When it is  over the affirmation of our own human frailities are more clearly evident. The movie is short, by todays standards anyway, and holds your interest long enough to see the Pastor Thomas in oneself and all humans.

Its the lgiht of analysis that burns sentiment away, leaving nothing behind.This short, powerful film is like that.  It briefly and tersely examines the life and faith of a country pastor living in rural Sweden during the fifties; that is, precisely, in the new Atomic Age, when the threat of the spread of atomic warfare frightened the Europe-dominated world.  Indeed, one of the film's few characters in this spare story is driven to despair and suicide by the threat of the Chinese, armed with such weapons, sweeping over the face of the earth.  A people, he says, ""Who have nothing to lose.""A people with nothign to lose is afraid of nothing, therefore it follows that a people with everything to lose is afraid of everything.  For the timid, security is overturned at every hand by Nihilism.  But sentient reality is determined at least in part, by fear, is it not?  Traditional belief depends on one's fear of god and the ghastly punishments he threatens.  But modern or Existential philosophy arises from our fear of everything but god, and god, starved of our dread, withers and dies, therefore, in and of our indifference.This is an unusual film of great simplicity and beauty.  It does not preach at all -- though its central figure is a preacher -- rather, through him is demonstrated the ineffectuality, the uselessness of preaching; certainly of preaching any sentiment no matter how noble, that one does not feel.Here, Bergman's usual handfull of actors, all very good, and a screenplay of stupendous courage, nobility and intelligence.  Not, perhaps, a bowl of popcorn and a sixpak kind of movie, but eminently worth watching -- and wathcing more than once or twice -- if only because one must try to imagine a plane of existence somewhere, anywhere beyond today's twin poles of lifetime gluttony and eventual gastric bypass surgery; a plane where ethical concerns outweigh superficialities.",5,SPOTLIGHT ON THE DISSECTIONIST'S TABLE,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2081,"['WINTER', 'LIGHT', 'cold', 'neutral', 'kind', 'light', 'hides', 'flatters', 'anything', 'perception', 'anything', 'be', 'distorted', 'mist', 'illusion', 'lgiht', 'analysis', 'sentiment', 'away', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'behind.This', 'short', 'powerful', 'film', 'briefly', 'tersely', 'life', 'faith', 'country', 'pastor', 'living', 'rural', 'Sweden', 'fifties', 'precisely', 'new', 'Atomic', 'Age', 'when', 'threat', 'spread', 'atomic', 'warfare', 'frightened', 'Europe-dominated', 'world', 'Indeed', 'one', 'film', 'few', 'characters', 'spare', 'story', 'driven', 'despair', 'suicide', 'threat', 'Chinese', 'armed', 'such', 'weapons', 'sweeping', 'face', 'earth', 'people', 'Who', 'have', 'nothing', 'lose', 'people', 'nothign', 'lose', 'afraid', 'nothing', 'people', 'everything', 'lose', 'afraid', 'everything', 'timid', 'security', 'overturned', 'hand', 'Nihilism', 'sentient', 'reality', 'determined', 'least', 'part', 'fear', 'not', 'Traditional', 'belief', 'one', 'fear', 'god', 'ghastly', 'modern', 'Existential', 'philosophy', 'arises', 'fear', 'everything', 'god', 'god', 'starved', 'dread', 'withers', 'dies', 'therefore', 'indifference.This', 'unusual', 'film', 'great', 'simplicity', 'beauty', 'not', 'preach', 'central', 'figure', 'preacher', 'rather', 'demonstrated', 'ineffectuality', 'uselessness', 'preaching', 'certainly', 'preaching', 'sentiment', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'noble', 'one', 'not', 'feel.Here', 'Bergman', 'usual', 'handfull', 'actors', 'very', 'good', 'screenplay', 'stupendous', 'courage', 'nobility', 'intelligence', 'Not', 'perhaps', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'sixpak', 'kind', 'movie', 'eminently', 'worth', 'watching', 'wathcing', 'more', 'once', 'twice', 'only', 'one', 'must', 'try', 'imagine', 'plane', 'existence', 'somewhere', 'anywhere', 'today', 'twin', 'poles', 'lifetime', 'gluttony', 'eventual', 'gastric', 'bypass', 'surgery', 'plane', 'where', 'ethical', 'concerns', 'outweigh', 'superficialities']",Winter Light VHS

357105,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6303107354,Kerry Walters,"[0, 0]","At one point in this best of all Bergman films, the despairing pastor Tomas (Gunnar Bjornstrand) realizes that life would be comprehensible if there is no God.  All the paradoxes and dilemmas of faith would vanish, and evil, revealed to be meaningless and nonpurposeful, would at least no longer be mysterious.  This realization immediately leads into Tomas' final loss of the last shreds of his faith.  The silence of God which has been tormenting him is at least seen to be a necessary silence, and that realization gives him a momentary sense of liberation.But it also leads to a troubling existential quandary:  when God goes silent, once and for all, how does one lead one's life?  How can broken, lonely, and frightened people make meaningful contact with one another?  How can long-held habits of relying on what Tomas comes to call an ""echo God""--an imagined deity who tells you exactly what you want to hear--be broken?  How does one manage not, as Marta says, to ""hate yourself to death""?Bergman's ""Winter Light"" is an exploration of these questions (and surely is as autobiographical as it is philosophical).  There are no definitive answers here.  A life liberated by God's silence is still a life full of ambiguity and suffering, disappointment and unfulfillment.  The silence of God--of ultimate meaning and purposefulness to the universe--is still a Christ-like passion many of us must endure in our own Gethsemanes.

The very first scene suggests an equivalence between a person's faith and his or her involvement in ritual: pastor Tomas, in the middle of a spiritual crisis, conducts a service without much conviction. Later, Bergman will show us that only a man who has faith (the disabled church employee) can give liturgy all of its meaning. This parallel can also be extended to the main cause of Tomas' crisis: God's silence. It is this same silence that feeds the faith of that other man. While the film initially appears to emphasize the futility of faith (especially during the first church service and Tomas' ensuing conversations with his mistress and the fisherman), careful viewing points to the contrary: it is when Tomas abjures his faith that his already unstable situation deteriorates - his understated reaction to the fisherman's suicide is all the more startling since this event's consequences will prove to be crucial. And it is when Tomas listens to the employee late in the film that he finds the force to conduct a service even though no one attends it; he is conducting it for himself as a further step in his ongoing spiritual quest.",4,"Faith, reason and silence...",1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,1223,"['introspective', 'film', 'acutely', 'tension', 'faith', 'reason', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'equivalence', 'person', 'faith', 'involvement', 'ritual', 'pastor', 'Tomas', 'middle', 'spiritual', 'crisis', 'service', 'much', 'conviction', 'Later', 'Bergman', 'will', 'show', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'faith', 'disabled', 'church', 'employee', 'can', 'give', 'liturgy', 'meaning', 'parallel', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'extended', 'main', 'cause', 'Tomas', 'crisis', 'God', 'silence', 'same', 'silence', 'faith', 'other', 'man', 'film', 'initially', 'emphasize', 'futility', 'faith', 'especially', 'first', 'church', 'service', 'Tomas', 'ensuing', 'conversations', 'mistress', 'fisherman', 'careful', 'viewing', 'points', 'contrary', 'when', 'Tomas', 'faith', 'already', 'unstable', 'situation', 'understated', 'reaction', 'fisherman', 'suicide', 'more', 'startling', 'event', 'consequences', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'crucial', 'when', 'Tomas', 'employee', 'late', 'film', 'force', 'conduct', 'service', 'even', 'one', 'conducting', 'further', 'step', 'ongoing', 'spiritual', 'quest']",Winter Light VHS

Regardless if one believes in God or not, there is always a question about (un)certainty of his existance.  What makes this film remarkable is that Ingmar Bergman is having a small town minister loosing faith.  His own doubt is so intense, that even his parishiners seem to sense that something is off.  As a result, only a few attend his masses and those few are desparate in their loneliness, depression and sadness.  They are seeking some consolation in the church and their pastor is unable to provide them with because he is having his own doubts. His trouble comes from the fact that he has lost his wife five years ago and cannot get over her death.  Her life and being was his sole happiness and without her presence and reassurance he is completely lost.  Even his two year romance with the local school teacher is  not bringing him any relief from grief; he has no hope as God is simply not responding to his prayers any more.  The priest is dead spiritually and he is a shadow of himself; he has no compassion for his (former) lover and is not capable of empathy for his parishiners.  His inability to help leads one of his parishiners to commit suicide.  But, he is true to his vocation, so no matter how many people do show or do not show for the mass, he prays to God because the show must go on.  It is a show because the priest does not have an ounce of humanity left in him.  He is a shadow of his former self dwindling slowly towards his own old age and death.  He is completely and utterly alone not because everyone has deserted him , but because he chooses so.",4,Spirituality crisis,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,1694,"['do', 'not', 'believe', 'human', 'being', 'out', 'there', 'point', 'did', 'not', 'question', 'existance', 'God', 'Regardless', 'one', 'God', 'not', 'always', 'question', 'un', 'certainty', 'existance', 'What', 'film', 'remarkable', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'having', 'small', 'town', 'minister', 'loosing', 'faith', 'own', 'doubt', 'so', 'intense', 'even', 'parishiners', 'seem', 'sense', 'something', 'off', 'result', 'only', 'few', 'attend', 'masses', 'few', 'are', 'desparate', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'sadness', 'are', 'seeking', 'consolation', 'church', 'pastor', 'unable', 'provide', 'having', 'own', 'doubts', 'trouble', 'fact', 'lost', 'wife', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'death', 'life', 'being', 'was', 'sole', 'happiness', 'presence', 'reassurance', 'completely', 'lost', 'Even', 'two', 'year', 'romance', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'not', 'bringing', 'relief', 'grief', 'hope', 'God', 'simply', 'not', 'responding', 'prayers', 'more', 'priest', 'dead', 'spiritually', 'shadow', 'compassion', 'former', 'lover', 'not', 'capable', 'empathy', 'parishiners', 'inability', 'help', 'leads', 'one', 'parishiners', 'commit', 'suicide', 'true', 'vocation', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'mass', 'God', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'show', 'priest', 'not', 'have', 'ounce', 'humanity', 'left', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'dwindling', 'slowly', 'towards', 'own', 'old', 'age', 'death', 'completely', 'utterly', 'alone', 'not', 'everyone', 'deserted', 'so']",Winter Light VHS
357110,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6303107354,Westley,"[2, 3]","""Winter Light"" follows ""Through a Glass Darkly"" in Ingmar Bergman's ""faith trilogy"" and was followed by ""The Silence.""  Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand portrays a pastor in a small Swedish village; the film follows his crises on one bleak mid-winter afternoon.  He's confronted by his mistress (Ingrid Thulin) as well as a struggling parishioner (Max von Sydow); however, his ultimate confrontation involves his own faith, which had been severely tested by the loss of his beloved wife.Bergman wrote the screenplay for ""Winter Light,"" which is at times absolutely devastating.  The film is perhaps Bergman's most overtly religious one, and it's an obtuse movie experience in many ways.  However, even though the dramas experienced by the main characters largely involve religion, the film isn't intended for exclusively religious audiences.  In fact, atheists will probably find as much to admire about the film - of course their interpretation is likely to be vastly different, which demonstrates Bergman's extraordinary writing skill.Every aspect of ""Winter Light"" is superlative.  Bergman's direction is particularly extraordinary - each scene is composed with such care and detail.  In a memorable scene, Thulin reads a letter while the camera remains on her stark face - an absolutely riveting moment.  The film's cinematographer, by the legendary Sven Nykvist, looks surprisingly unpolished, but it adeptly conveys the bleak and austere world of these characters.  The casting and acting is also ideal.  Bjornstrand starred in many Bergman films, but this one contains perhaps his best role and performance.  Ingrid Thulin is another Bergman favorite, and her icy persona is put to perfect effect as the independent but needy schoolteacher who pursues Bjornstrand.  ""Winter Light"" doesn't generally receive as much attention as many other Bergman films, which is a shame because it's a nearly perfect film.  Most highly recommended.DVD extras: The DVD contains the original US trailer, which surprisingly gives away a major plot detail.  In addition, a nine-minute conversation with Bergman scholar Peter Cowie is included.  He discusses the film in the context of the ""faith trilogy"" as well as other key aspects of ""Winter Light.""",5,Pitch-Perfect Cinema,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2230,"['Winter', 'Light', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'faith', 'trilogy', 'was', 'followed', 'Silence', 'Gunnar', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rnstrand', 'pastor', 'small', 'Swedish', 'village', 'film', 'crises', 'one', 'bleak', 'mid-winter', 'afternoon', 'confronted', 'mistress', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'as', 'well', 'struggling', 'parishioner', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'however', 'ultimate', 'confrontation', 'own', 'faith', 'had', 'been', 'severely', 'tested', 'loss', 'beloved', 'wife.Bergman', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Winter', 'Light', 'times', 'absolutely', 'devastating', 'film', 'perhaps', 'Bergman', 'most', 'overtly', 'religious', 'one', 'obtuse', 'movie', 'experience', 'many', 'ways', 'However', 'even', 'dramas', 'experienced', 'main', 'characters', 'largely', 'involve', 'religion', 'film', ""n't"", 'intended', 'exclusively', 'religious', 'audiences', 'fact', 'atheists', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'as', 'much', 'admire', 'film', 'course', 'interpretation', 'likely', 'be', 'vastly', 'different', 'Bergman', 'extraordinary', 'writing', 'skill.Every', 'aspect', 'Winter', 'Light', 'superlative', 'Bergman', 'direction', 'particularly', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'composed', 'such', 'care', 'detail', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Thulin', 'letter', 'camera', 'stark', 'face', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'moment', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'legendary', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'surprisingly', 'unpolished', 'adeptly', 'bleak', 'austere', 'world', 'characters', 'casting', 'acting', 'also', 'ideal', 'Bjornstrand', 'starred', 'many', 'Bergman', 'films', 'one', 'perhaps', 'best', 'role', 'performance', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'Bergman', 'favorite', 'icy', 'persona', 'put', 'perfect', 'effect', 'independent', 'needy', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'Bjornstrand', 'Winter', 'Light', ""n't"", 'generally', 'receive', 'much', 'attention', 'many', 'other', 'Bergman', 'films', 'shame', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'film', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended.DVD', 'extras', 'DVD', 'original', 'US', 'trailer', 'surprisingly', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'detail', 'addition', 'nine-minute', 'conversation', 'Bergman', 'scholar', 'Peter', 'Cowie', 'included', 'film', 'context', 'faith', 'trilogy', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'key', 'aspects', 'Winter', 'Light']",Winter Light VHS
