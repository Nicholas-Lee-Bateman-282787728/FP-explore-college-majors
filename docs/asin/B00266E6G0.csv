A hoary old concept - someone is re-creating the Jack the Ripper murders - done with style, high production values, and filled with Ripper lore.Detective Inspector Chandler, a foppish and ambitious member of an elite group within the London police force, is promised he will get a promotion if he solves the brutal murder of a woman in the Whitechapel district. He takes over a resentful and rumpled squad of experienced detectives. A Ripper tour guide comes to him and points out the murder matches exactly the circumstances of the Ripper's first victim. His experienced detectives scoff at him, reminding him that every stabbing in Whitechapel is called a Ripper copycat. All too soon it is clear that the theory is correct and more murders will follow on the exact dates that the Ripper murders occurred. Chandler and his squad must try to stop the killer, and soon his career is in peril as his colleagues distance themselves from him.Chandler is no flawless hero: he suffers from OCD and seems incapable of forming relationships, especially with his squad, who at first disrespect and attempt to undercut him. He does not believe in his own abilities, but is drawn in by the case's mysterious allure.This is not family viewing, but the gruesome shots are very quick and not entirely clear. The atmosphere is great and the suspense relentless. The climax of the final episode is heartstoppingly suspenseful.

1251056,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00266E6G0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","History's enduring fascination with the gruesome crimes of Jack The Ripper continues unabated with yet another example of popular fiction being inspired by the legendary murderer. Truthfully, I have read enough books, seen enough television, and watched enough movies that cast Jack The Ripper into a central role that I feel like he's an old friend--albeit one I wouldn't want to invite home to dinner. So wearily and warily, I sat down to ITV's three part suspenser ""Whitechapel: The Ripper Returns."" Within minutes, however, I was hooked! Moody and stylish, ""Whitechapel"" is an expertly assembled crime drama that posits a familiar scenario where a modern day maniac is duplicating the crimes of the notorious Ripper. And while we've seen this exact set-up countless times before, it works grandly yet again. By concentrating on the police procedural aspects of the investigation as opposed to the crimes, this becomes a tense race against time to try to outwit and outmaneuver a killer by using clues from historical records. It's both well paced and well acted--and, in only three parts, it is a concise and scary little story.Beginning with a vicious murder, the case is afoot. Rupert Penry-Jones plays an ambitious detective inspector who gets his first big murder case without initially realizing the magnitude of what will unfold. He is clued into the similarities to Jack the Ripper by a Ripper expert/enthusiast played perfectly by Steve Pemberton. Bringing the theory back to his new squad, they treat it with skepticism. In fact, the officers (led by the terrific Phillip Davis) are generally dismissive of the younger inexperienced man. However, as the pattern continues to prove correct, a grudging form of respect starts to develop and everyone is intent of catching the copycat before time elapses on the last murder. Again, the first two episodes are near perfection establishing colorful characters and genuine tension. ""Whitechapel: The Ripper Returns"" does, however, feel a bit rushed for its final act. It's not necessarily a fatal flaw, but so much is stuffed into the last thirty minutes--it doesn't build to the excruciating confrontation that I had been hoping for and expecting.Still, if you are a fan of these British mysteries or crime procedurals, there is a lot to recommend ""The Ripper Returns."" I really liked Penry-Jones (but I usually do), but it is Pemberton that brings an unexpected pathos to the piece. Quite literally, he steals every scene that he's in. There are a lot of elements that you've seen before--The Ripper, office politics, copycat crimes--but they are assembled into a tight and cohesive plot. Fabulously entertaining and appropriately dark, I'm certainly glad I checked this out. The same team has already put together another three episode arc for season two and have a promised return in 2012 for season three. (Gotta love British TV--three episodes constitutes a season!) I will be front and center for these new crimes!

Newly promoted Detective Inspector Chandler, tall, handsome and untried must prove to the men in his division that he has what it takes and is not simply an expert in three day courses and police politics, i.e. boot-licking.The members of his division sneer at him at first as he successfully orders them to wear neckties, put their trash in bins and tidy up their office and take a shower now and then. Slovenly policemen do not get respect. Chandler's chief opponent is Sergeant Inspector Miles, who is the proverbial hard-boiled cynical detective. The men obey Chandler, they have to but their grumbles subside as they see their new boss develop into a leader commanding their respect. They clean up their office, don neckties, albeit garish ones,put their trash in bins, stop belching and chewing gum and lolling on desks.A Ripperologist warns that a copycat Ripper is on the lose who will one by one imitate the ghastly mutilations of 1888. Edward Buchan, the Ripper enthusiast, conducts Ripper tours and Chandler joins one of them.Buchan predicts where the killer will strike next, the officers go to that area, lounge around all night and then they hear a terrible scream....Not only are the distinct and interesting characters beautifully played but the camera crew create absolutely fantastic scenes, sometimes garish, sometimes shimmering like a mirage, sometimes lunging back and forth to portray tension, brilliant color suddenly giving way to immensely moody and terrifying thready darkness where you think you see something awful. (You do). The camera hones in on the faces, too, so close the emotions are vividly portrayed, almost in slow motion. The camera loves Chandler's beautiful hands, moving in often on his restless fingers, hands that could grace a violin.&#8220;Whitechapel&#8221; is exciting, taut and fast-moving yet strangely intimate with sharp stabs of gallows humor to alleviate the tenseness of a murder scene.

The &#34;hook&#34; of this show, is the cases mirror distinct cases in history. (Can you guess where this is going? I bet you can!) The first season details the assignment of D.I. Joseph Chandler, a fastidious if not downright OCD impaired, well connected &#34;up and comer&#34; to the homicide division. Having no legitimate field experience, he is met with resistance, if not outright disdain from his detectives. The first case he encounters looks to be a Jack the Ripper copycat.  (Hence the name, Whitechapel) The mere mention of Jack the Ripper sends his detectives into fits, as their experience has shown that such cases (rightfully labeled or not) bring looneys and self proclaimed &#34;ripperologists&#34; out of the woodwork.The full season deals with the handling of this one case, slowly unraveling the complexities of D.I. Chandler and his relationship with his staff. Chandler, faced with a lack of cooperation, is forced to fall back on his personal brand of dogged determination, is revealed to be fiercely loyal and dedicated in addition to suffering from serious OCD. His team is shown to be hardworking and dedicated despite their sorely lacking first impression.Whitechapel's unique premise is entertaining but, the writing is somewhat lacking. There are occasional &#34;gaps&#34; in the writing that make the detectives and the police dept.  seem a bit bumbling at times. In order to move the script along, the major players are required to make some very unrealistic leaps of faith.As I watched the first season I remember thinking:&#34; This show deserved better writing. It won't last long with this treatment.&#34;The concept of a crime drama that deals with historically relevant crimes in a modern setting, requires some serious talent all around the table.It seems I was right (although, I wish I wasn't).

In Whitechapel though, Penry-Jones finds himself playing a very different role indeed. He is still dashing, and smartly-dressed in Savile Row suits, but his rank as a newly-minted DI on the fast track inadvertently places him on a case that turns out to be a serial murder mimicking the gruesome crimes of Jack the Ripper.DI Joseph Chandler is being groomed for the HQ and as part of this training, is expected to pay his dues with a brief stint as a DI on a case that initially appears to be open and shut. The DI finds himself in unfamiliar territory and is looked upon with derision by the cynical DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis) and the other members of the team. The series is broken up into three episodes and each episode sees the team puzzling out the case which gets even more complicated when the team realizes that this is indeed a copycat killing of the Jack the Ripper murders, which means more victims will be targeted soon enough.Over the course of the three episodes, DS Miles and the other team members come to a grudging acceptance of DI Chandler and even accord him some measure of respect especially when his hunches prove true. Chandler is also assisted during the course of the investigation by a self-avowed Ripperologist Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton) who prides himself on his vast knowledge about the Ripper murders and delights in the macabre Ripper tours he conducts in London's Whitechapel district.The show's appeal partly lies in the plausible interweaving of the past events and the parallels with the present-day crimes. Then there's the all-consuming question of the modern Ripper's identity - will reading about the past crimes yield any clues at all about the present-day murderer's identity? There's a sense of suspense throughout and the viewer is left puzzling out the case along with Chandler and his team and trying to unmask the killer. The sense of menace is palpable throughout as viewers get a view of some of the gory details of the past crimes and present.
