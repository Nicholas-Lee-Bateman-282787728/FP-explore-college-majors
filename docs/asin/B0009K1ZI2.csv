Villanueva,"[0, 0]","I love ""ethereal"" music and opera, from Tristan and Isolde to King Roger or The Birds, but L'Amour de Loin touches deep into my literary interests as well, being based on the life of a real French troubador from the XII century, whose works I now aim to find.  As regards this particular piece, let me address the production first: never have I seen something on stage so infinitely sophisticated and yet infinitely simple. The use of a reflecting pool and a spiral staircase was an inspired choice.  The voices literally float on the water.  Sellars has outdone himself.With only three main characters on stage at all times, attention is focused on the singers who, must not  only be in prime vocal condition, but be personable enough for closeups and the prying eyes of the cameras.  So, they also have to be great actors. Dawn Upshaw, Gerald Finley and Monica Groop more than fit the bill.

Where do we draw a line?Alas, this modern performance conjures up another fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, so fitting to productions like this one:""...""I am quite ready,"" announced the Emperor, and he looked at himself again in the mirror, turning from side to side as if carefully examining his handsome attire.The courtiers who were to carry the train felt about on the ground pretending to lift it: they walked on solemnly pretending to be carrying it. Nothing would have persuaded them to admit they could not see the clothes, for fear they would be thought stupid or unfit for their posts.And so the Emperor set off under the high canopy, at the head of the great procession. It was a great success. All the people standing by and at the windows cheered and cried, ""Oh, how splendid are the Emperor's new clothes. What a magnificent train! How well the clothes fit!"" No one dared to admit that he couldn't see anything, for who would want it to be known that he was either stupid or unfit for his post?None of the Emperor's clothes had ever met with such success.But among the crowds a little child suddenly gasped out, ""But the Emperor has nothing on at all!""How much MUSIC could be funded with this budget! Yet indeed, The Emperor's New Clothes never go out of fashion.

907023,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B0009K1ZI2,Christopher Culver,"[25, 30]","In the mid-1990s Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho became attracted to the poetry of Jaufre Rudel, the 12th-century troubadour and lord of Blaye who wrote striking poems of love to a woman far away whom he couldn't and, possibly, never even did meet. In ""Lonh"" for soprano and electronics (1996), she set one of his songs for Dawn Upshaw to sing, and then she wrote her first opera L'AMOUR DE LOIN (""Love from Afar"") on the theme. This 2004 performance is by the Finnish National Opera. It's conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, a long-time proponent of Saariaho's music, having known her since their days at school. This staging is directed by Peter Sellars, whose quirky stage design actually agrees with the composer's intentions this time (imagine that).According to Rudel's unreliable biography, his love was for the Countess of Tripoli, whom he never saw but to whom he nonetheless pledged his eternal love. Amin Maalouf's libretto treats precisely this part of his life. In the first act, Rudel (a baritone, here Gerald Finley) in his castle reflects how he's stuck in a rut, no longer able to show daring skill with women and make other men jealous. A pilgrim comes and tells him of a woman he saw on the other side of the sea, who is everything Rudel says he desires. The troubadour decides to desire only her, and yet he knows he cannot even see her. The pilgrim is an androgynous persona, treated as male but sung by a woman (a mezzo-soprano, here Monica Groop). This pilgrim moves back and forth across the sea, speaking individually to the Countess of Tripoli (a soprano, here Dawn Upshaw), and then Rudel again. Eventually, Rudel decides to travel with the pilgrim to Tripoli, meeting his destiny in a tragic ending. Maalouf is a fantastic librettist, I can think of few scenes in opera as moving as the duet between Rudel and the Countess in Act IV. And although there are only three characters (and an unseen chorus representing the young men of Blaye and the young women of Tripoli), there is never that there's not enough going on; dramatic tension stays high throughout.Saariaho's music is quite systematic. The part of Rudel is subtle, full of small steps. The soprano is characterized by wide leaps on a diatonic scale. Strikingly, the song of the pilgrim changes based on who she is addressing, reflecting her role as intermediary. The orchestral music is concerned mainly with timbre, with occasional flashes of vibrant colour as in Messiaen or Debussy. The unseen chorus, consisting as it does of kinsmen and kinswomen who try to bring Rudel and the Countess to their senses, are accompanied by music of disruption: percussion blasts, pizzicato. The music is generally impressive, but some portions prevent me from giving this opera a five-star rating. After the middle of the 1990s, Saariaho's writing changed noticeably, and she began to eschew electronics and write overt melodies, a turn for the worst compared to her masterpieces of the early '90s, such as ""Amers"", ""Du cristal"", and ""Six Japanese Gardens"". Most of the opera holds its own against this early great pieces, and electronics happily abound (many sounds realized at IRCAM). Yet certain moments are all too typical of what she is writing now. Take, for instance, the beginning of act IV, as the pilgrim is sitting in his ship. The music of the scene (written also as an individual piece, the first movement of her ""Oltra Mar"" for choir and orchestra), is trite and bombastic and like something of out a 1970s sci-fi soundtrack. Or the scene near the end where the people of Tripoli admonish the countess, music so banal and simplistic one would hardly suspect it the work of Saariaho.I'm never one to review well the sound and video possibilities of DVDs, as I watch them on a laptop screen and listen with headphones, but this is no poor print and the sound seems impeccable. The DVD contains a ""bonus"" of three interviews, with Saariaho, Salonen, and Sellars. One regrets that there's no interview with Maalouf, who bears such a great part of the responsibility for this work.In spite of some minor complaints, any fan of contemporary music, or even general opera (there's little of the ""weird modernism"" or ""dissonance"" that could frighten traditional listeners) should see this fascinating work. Among the operas of the last 30 years, L'AMOUR DE LOIN will certainly rank among the most universally accessible (it's certainly no Ligeti's ""Le Grand Macabre"").",4,"A moving opera with a fantastic libretto, though Saariaho's music is uneven",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,4445,"['mid-1990s', 'Finnish', 'composer', 'Kaija', 'Saariaho', 'became', 'attracted', 'poetry', 'Jaufre', 'Rudel', '12th-century', 'troubadour', 'lord', 'Blaye', 'who', 'wrote', 'striking', 'poems', 'love', 'woman', 'far', 'away', 'whom', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'never', 'even', 'did', 'meet', 'Lonh', 'soprano', 'electronics', '1996', 'set', 'one', 'songs', 'Dawn', 'Upshaw', 'sing', 'then', 'wrote', 'first', 'opera', ""L'AMOUR"", 'DE', 'LOIN', 'Love', 'Afar', 'theme', '2004', 'performance', 'Finnish', 'National', 'Opera', 'conducted', 'Esa-Pekka', 'Salonen', 'long-time', 'proponent', 'Saariaho', 'music', 'having', 'known', 'days', 'school', 'staging', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Sellars', 'quirky', 'stage', 'design', 'actually', 'composer', 'intentions', 'time', 'imagine', '.According', 'Rudel', 'unreliable', 'biography', 'love', 'was', 'Countess', 'Tripoli', 'whom', 'never', 'saw', 'whom', 'nonetheless', 'pledged', 'eternal', 'love', 'Amin', 'Maalouf', 'libretto', 'precisely', 'part', 'life', 'first', 'act', 'Rudel', 'baritone', 'here', 'Gerald', 'Finley', 'castle', 'how', 'stuck', 'rut', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'show', 'daring', 'skill', 'women', 'make', 'other', 'men', 'jealous', 'pilgrim', 'woman', 'saw', 'other', 'side', 'sea', 'who', 'everything', 'Rudel', 'troubadour', 'desire', 'only', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'pilgrim', 'androgynous', 'persona', 'treated', 'male', 'sung', 'woman', 'mezzo-soprano', 'here', 'Monica', 'Groop', 'pilgrim', 'back', 'forth', 'sea', 'speaking', 'individually', 'Countess', 'Tripoli', 'soprano', 'here', 'Dawn', 'Upshaw', 'then', 'Rudel', 'again', 'Eventually', 'Rudel', 'travel', 'pilgrim', 'Tripoli', 'meeting', 'destiny', 'tragic', 'ending', 'Maalouf', 'fantastic', 'librettist', 'can', 'think', 'few', 'scenes', 'opera', 'as', 'moving', 'duet', 'Rudel', 'Countess', 'Act', 'IV', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'unseen', 'chorus', 'representing', 'young', 'men', 'Blaye', 'young', 'women', 'Tripoli', 'never', 'not', 'enough', 'going', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'stays', 'high', 'throughout.Saariaho', 'music', 'quite', 'systematic', 'part', 'Rudel', 'subtle', 'full', 'small', 'steps', 'soprano', 'characterized', 'wide', 'leaps', 'diatonic', 'scale', 'Strikingly', 'song', 'pilgrim', 'changes', 'based', 'who', 'addressing', 'reflecting', 'role', 'intermediary', 'orchestral', 'music', 'concerned', 'mainly', 'timbre', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'vibrant', 'colour', 'Messiaen', 'Debussy', 'unseen', 'chorus', 'consisting', 'kinsmen', 'kinswomen', 'who', 'try', 'bring', 'Rudel', 'Countess', 'senses', 'are', 'accompanied', 'music', 'disruption', 'percussion', 'blasts', 'pizzicato', 'music', 'generally', 'impressive', 'portions', 'prevent', 'giving', 'opera', 'five-star', 'rating', 'middle', '1990s', 'Saariaho', 'writing', 'changed', 'noticeably', 'began', 'eschew', 'electronics', 'write', 'overt', 'melodies', 'turn', 'worst', 'compared', 'masterpieces', 'early', ""'90s"", 'such', 'Amers', 'Du', 'cristal', 'Six', 'Japanese', 'Gardens', 'Most', 'opera', 'own', 'early', 'great', 'pieces', 'electronics', 'happily', 'many', 'sounds', 'realized', 'IRCAM', 'certain', 'moments', 'are', 'too', 'typical', 'what', 'writing', 'now', 'Take', 'instance', 'beginning', 'act', 'IV', 'pilgrim', 'sitting', 'ship', 'music', 'scene', 'written', 'also', 'individual', 'piece', 'first', 'movement', 'Oltra', 'Mar', 'choir', 'orchestra', 'trite', 'bombastic', 'something', '1970s', 'sci-fi', 'soundtrack', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'people', 'Tripoli', 'admonish', 'countess', 'music', 'so', 'banal', 'simplistic', 'one', 'would', 'hardly', 'suspect', 'work', 'Saariaho.I', ""'m"", 'never', 'one', 'review', 'well', 'sound', 'video', 'possibilities', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'laptop', 'screen', 'listen', 'headphones', 'poor', 'print', 'sound', 'impeccable', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'three', 'interviews', 'Saariaho', 'Salonen', 'Sellars', 'One', 'interview', 'Maalouf', 'who', 'great', 'part', 'responsibility', 'work.In', 'spite', 'minor', 'complaints', 'fan', 'contemporary', 'music', 'even', 'general', 'opera', 'little', 'weird', 'modernism', 'dissonance', 'could', 'frighten', 'traditional', 'listeners', 'should', 'see', 'fascinating', 'work', 'operas', 'last', '30', 'years', ""L'AMOUR"", 'DE', 'LOIN', 'will', 'certainly', 'rank', 'most', 'universally', 'accessible', 'certainly', 'Ligeti', 'Le', 'Grand', 'Macabre']",N/A

Believe me. It has a slight undertone of the medieval. For such a minimal plot things really heat up once the Pilgrim has returned to tell of the Countess response and our hero is distressed by the apparent failure of the Pilgrim's mission. The orchestral writing is subtle and mystical in support of the singers and when called for gets quite dramatic with the expected contemporary masses of sound. I would expect Wagner's music was like this to the ears of the public when his operas premiered. Plenty of people felt it wasn't music at all so give this a chance.

Having had no expectations from a Finnish composer of whom I had never heard, the opera had no standards of mine to meet. I took what came.  Whatever ones taste, one can see objectively that there is a high degree of complementarity among scenic design, bodily movements, music and song. They fit closely.  I cannot imagine how the production was perceived by the live audience so heavily was the action geared to the camera's eyes. Closeups were the order of the day, faces, features of faces, bodies, features of bodies filled the screen. In essence, I found the entire opera to be made up of a series of fixed images flowing one into another, with the camera lovingly embracing each gesture, each image of color, the few pieces of scenery, the light, the water onstage; at the same time, the music gives  each image its nuance, its emphasis, its body.  On the other hand,  it is a ceremonial piece,  living images flow slowly before us with almost stately or sacred quality, a sort of stream of static audio-visual snapshots.Well, it wasn't Verdi or Puccini, it was moving but without much movement. Not at all to everyone's taste; perhaps, to the taste of only a few. That is why I suggest that before laying out whatever the price may be, you watch a generous sample, preferably the whole thing.

907027,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009K1ZI2,Grady Harp,"[41, 44]","Kaija Saariaho is rapidly becoming one of the more daring and creative of our current crop of contemporary composers.  Hailing from Finland, she has good colleagues in this country who consistently provide audiences with the rare beauties of her compositions.  One of her most ardent supporters is fellow composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen who indeed conducts the performance of her opera ""L'Amour de Loin"", leading the Finnish National Opera and superb soloists Dawn Upshaw, Gerald Finley, and Monica Groop.  The bizarre aspect of this release is that the DVD of the opera was released before the CD of simply the music.  One viewing will explain that choice.The opera is based on a 12th Century tale of love as filtered through the experiences and musings and dreamings and illusions of a countess, a troubadour and a  wandering pilgrim.  The staging is simple, built around a tower from where the object of love is seen and sees and the characters weave in and out of this simplicity of stage design created by the inimitable Peter Sellars by means of fascinating lighting schemes.  There is no 'big story', just 'reflections on love from afar' as the new fairly frequently performed excerpts are called.Gerald Finley is a brilliant and handsome baritone who not only has a voice of great beauty and clarity but one who is a committed actor as well (he is currently premiering the lead role of Robert Oppenheimer in John Adams' new opera 'Dr. Atomic' with the San Francisco Opera).  He is magnificent to hear and to see.  Dawn Upshaw and Monica Group take the women's roles and while everyone is aware of the quality of emersion in new work that accompanies the mention of Upshaw's name, Monica Groop prove herself to be in the same echelon.  This gorgeous music, perfectly sung and acted, masterfully conducted by Salonen, and the DVD is of the highest quality.  While it is a gift to be introduced to Saariaho's fine opera via DVD, it will be good to have the recording of the music alone to grow into what seems to merit entry into the standard repertoire.
