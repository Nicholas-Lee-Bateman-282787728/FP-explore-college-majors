1554000,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008IG0DJQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Oh, right, that old gripe. The one where you sulk because there's no original programming anymore, nothing new on Earth anymore when it comes to plot lines. This applies exceedingly well to holiday pictures. The plot is familiar, the sentiment borders on cloying. The hope lies in the execution and on the likability of the cast. Once upon a time, Melissa Gilbert was a likable child in Little House on the Prairie. That jarring swerve I felt when I saw her in The Christmas Pageant, seeing her all grown up and playing a nasty-tempered Broadway director, is why I stuck around.Vera Parks (Gilbert) just got her third sacking of the year, this time for inadvertently pushing the playwright during a dispute. Vera refers to herself as ""abrasive"" and ""dictatorial,"" whereas her friend would rather dish out more damning adjectives (such as ""opinionated"" and ""insulting""). But Vera gets another crack at employment when she's hired to direct a small-town theatre production of a holiday pageant. Off she goes to Ashton Falls in upstate New York, dreading that this town would prove so provincial it probably won't have peppermint tea, her sip of choice.She meets the Ashton Falls City Players and she isn't impressed. She's also not taken with the cramped chamber in which they'll be rehearsing AND holding the play. But at least the town has peppermint tea.There's an old tradition that dates back to 1893, Vera is told (and you can see her trying hard not to roll her eyes). In 1893, President Grover Cleveland was scheduled to pass thru Ashton Falls the week before Christmas and so the town organized a Christmas pageant in his honor. Except that the President ran behind schedule and so his train never did stop (he did wave at the good citizens, though). Anyway, there's been an annual Christmas pageant since.In Ashton Falls, Vera unexpectedly runs into an old flame, this guy Jack Harmon (Robert Mailhouse), now a widower and father to Kristen, a little girl with whom Vera forms an immediate bond. And those are the principals in terms of characters and narrative. I guess I could mention that one grouse in the theatre troupe, her what's a stickler for tradition and always undermining Vera's efforts to spruce up the production. We anticipate Vera's settling in and, as always goes with these kinds of movies, learning that she's actually content in Ashton Falls. And then there's that thing that comes up to provide that one final dramatic conflict.I rate this a better-than-average 3 out of 5 stars. 2011's The Christmas Pageant is oh-so-predictable, but so what? Them rubes from Ashton Falls are so over-the-top corny, but so what? The cast is amiable. The story is sweetly told. It's the holidays, yo! And it's fun to eyeball Melissa Gilbert in (for me, anyway) unfamiliar territory. She handles the comedic moments just fine, even the farcical bits just fine. And Lennon Wynn - the little girl who plays Kristen - is very charming, and you can see why even someone as demanding and temperamental as Vera would thaw in her presence. Theirs is the relationship to savor. The romance between Vera and Kristen's dad is strictly of the ho-hum persuasion. So, yeah, The Christmas Pageant, look into it. It's a diverting enough slice of holiday hokum. There are even snicker doodles.",3,Laura Ingalls is a snooty theatre director,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3289,"['Oh', 'right', 'old', 'gripe', 'one', 'where', 'sulk', 'original', 'programming', 'anymore', 'nothing', 'new', 'Earth', 'anymore', 'when', 'plot', 'lines', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'holiday', 'pictures', 'plot', 'familiar', 'sentiment', 'borders', 'cloying', 'hope', 'execution', 'likability', 'cast', 'Once', 'time', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'likable', 'child', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'jarring', 'swerve', 'felt', 'when', 'saw', 'Christmas', 'Pageant', 'seeing', 'grown', 'up', 'playing', 'nasty-tempered', 'Broadway', 'director', 'why', 'stuck', 'around.Vera', 'Parks', 'Gilbert', 'just', 'got', 'third', 'sacking', 'year', 'time', 'inadvertently', 'pushing', 'playwright', 'dispute', 'Vera', 'refers', 'herself', 'abrasive', 'dictatorial', 'friend', 'would', 'rather', 'dish', 'out', 'more', 'damning', 'adjectives', 'such', 'opinionated', 'insulting', 'Vera', 'crack', 'employment', 'when', 'hired', 'direct', 'small-town', 'theatre', 'production', 'holiday', 'pageant', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'dreading', 'town', 'would', 'prove', 'so', 'provincial', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'peppermint', 'tea', 'sip', 'choice.She', 'meets', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'City', 'Players', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'also', 'not', 'taken', 'cramped', 'chamber', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rehearsing', 'AND', 'holding', 'play', 'least', 'town', 'peppermint', 'old', 'tradition', 'back', '1893', 'Vera', 'told', 'can', 'see', 'trying', 'hard', 'not', 'roll', 'eyes', '1893', 'President', 'Grover', 'Cleveland', 'was', 'scheduled', 'pass', 'thru', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'week', 'Christmas', 'so', 'town', 'organized', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'honor', 'President', 'ran', 'schedule', 'so', 'train', 'never', 'did', 'stop', 'did', 'wave', 'good', 'citizens', 'though', 'Anyway', 'been', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'since.In', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'Vera', 'unexpectedly', 'old', 'flame', 'guy', 'Jack', 'Harmon', 'Robert', 'Mailhouse', 'now', 'widower', 'father', 'Kristen', 'little', 'girl', 'whom', 'Vera', 'immediate', 'bond', 'are', 'principals', 'terms', 'characters', 'narrative', 'guess', 'could', 'mention', 'one', 'grouse', 'theatre', 'troupe', 'what', 'stickler', 'tradition', 'always', 'undermining', 'Vera', 'efforts', 'spruce', 'up', 'production', 'anticipate', 'Vera', 'settling', 'always', 'kinds', 'movies', 'learning', 'actually', 'content', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'then', 'thing', 'up', 'provide', 'one', 'final', 'dramatic', 'conflict.I', 'rate', 'better-than-average', '3', '5', 'stars', '2011', 'Christmas', 'Pageant', 'oh-so-predictable', 'so', 'what', 'Them', 'Ashton', 'Falls', 'are', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'corny', 'so', 'what', 'cast', 'amiable', 'story', 'sweetly', 'told', 'holidays', 'yo', 'fun', 'eyeball', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'anyway', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'comedic', 'moments', 'just', 'fine', 'even', 'farcical', 'bits', 'just', 'fine', 'Lennon', 'Wynn', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Kristen', 'very', 'charming', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'even', 'someone', 'demanding', 'temperamental', 'Vera', 'would', 'thaw', 'presence', 'Theirs', 'relationship', 'savor', 'romance', 'Vera', 'Kristen', 'dad', 'strictly', 'ho-hum', 'persuasion', 'So', 'yeah', 'Christmas', 'Pageant', 'look', 'diverting', 'enough', 'slice', 'holiday', 'hokum', 'are', 'even', 'snicker', 'doodles']",The Christmas Pageant

When all else fails, her manager (played well by veteran singer Steve Lawrence), lands her a job as director of a Christmas pageant in a small town. Shortly after arriving she encounters her former boyfriend, Jack, in the local coffee shop, which he owns. After her first disastrous meeting with her cast of characters (and you can apply that in two ways), she packs back up and calls a taxi to come get her so that she can catch a train back to New York. But with encouragement from the perceptive owner of the B&B; where she was lodging, she remains.She alienates herself from some of the townspeople by her desire to change things and endears herself to others by bringing out their hidden talents. And along the way she is enchanted by Jack's young daughter (who is charming) and her heart is touched by the genuine warmth and acceptance of the community.*Spoiler Alert*Then her manager calls with a too-good-to-be-true offer to direct back in New York--starting in two days. Vera is torn, but feels like she would be crazy to turn down such a career opportunity. Much to the disappointment of her cast, Jack and his daughter, she returns to New York. But this is a feel-good Christmas movie, so you know there is a happy ending.This is basically a family-friendly movie. I caught one use of the Lord's name in vain.

We love her, and she delivers once again with this familiar Christmas tale of finding what's truly important in life.Gilbert's character is a Broadway director with all the right stuff to succeed but floundering because of personality problems.  She pursues her profession without regard to anything else.  Now, because no one wants to hire her, her agent forces her to take a menial job directing a small town Christmas pageant.  Not only that, but her ex-fiance, with a cute daughter, recommended her.Yes, yes, a thousand times yes, we know where all this is headed; however, such is the nature of these family friendly, part romantic comedy, part mushy drama, with endearing oddball characters, small town folksiness, overly sentimental, but gotta love them anyway, type flicks.It's well filmed and acted for the genre.  Pot-bellied Edward Herrmann plays a jolly innkeeper. The story's fine and fun.  The cons: There's too much sappy music throughout- after a while we just toned it out, and characters are somewhat stereotyped and one dimensional.  May I also say, it's not as good as ""A Holiday for Love""- which is one of our favorite Gilbert and Holiday movies.I'm saying all this to be as critical as possible so you know what you're in for.  If you hate predictablity and goofy, gooey stories- seek other forms of entertainment.  We're suckers for it, and for our family movie night, it's right on the money for all ages.
