In this video, Bryant pushes his athletes beyond the brink, far beyond the realm of sanity.  If coaches,now, began training camp like this, they would be fired before training camp ended; however, the Junction Boys gives us an idea of how far Bryant would push the envelope, and more importantly, how the boys would respond.  The ending shows the respect the players had for their coach decades later; it is apparent that both sides grew in understanding of the human spirit as time passes.An excellent film...",5,Bear Bryant: The Beginning of a Legend,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,613,"['Coach', 'Bear', 'Bryant', 'began', 'storied', 'career', 'Texas', 'A', 'M', 'moving', 'University', 'Alabama', 'video', 'Bryant', 'athletes', 'brink', 'far', 'realm', 'sanity', 'coaches', 'now', 'began', 'training', 'camp', 'would', 'be', 'fired', 'training', 'camp', 'ended', 'however', 'Junction', 'Boys', 'idea', 'how', 'far', 'Bryant', 'would', 'push', 'envelope', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'boys', 'would', 'respond', 'ending', 'respect', 'players', 'had', 'coach', 'decades', 'later', 'apparent', 'sides', 'grew', 'understanding', 'human', 'spirit', 'time', 'passes.An', 'excellent', 'film']",The Junction Boys

He was without a doubt one of the toughest college coaches in the history of football.  The Junction Boys is about Coach Bryants tenure at Texas A&M.;  Sure some critics say that this movie focused more on the brutal treatment of player rather than football, but thats is what set coach Bryant apart from other coachs.  His practices were brutal, maybe to the point of torture.  But maybe his long hard practices are part of what made him one of the winningest coaches in college football history!  If your going to cry about this not being a football film, go watch Remember The Titans instead.  But if you want a true insite on the icon that is Paul Bear Bryant, and what he was like as a man, this movie is a must have!

The selflessness that these boys learned became a virture that carried them through life.  Even though that lesson was learned from brutal challenges, most of them did not seem bitter.

758763,A2GEB05H8G2Z5A,B00009W5F7,Rolltide,"[4, 5]","There is nothing about this movie that sugar coats what happened at junction in 1954. Even coach bryant knew that he went too far and was too rigid with his rules and standards. So rigid that even players who were sick and injured from the ordeal were not allowed to stay on the team if they couldn't practice. After A&M; lost their first game in a blow out bryant said ""that one was on me"" because the players were too beat up. That 1-9 season was bryant's only losing season ever! Understand the historical significance? The greatest college coach ever had a 1-9 team because of junction!We need to have a historical perspective here. First of all texas a&m; was not a small school. It is a big time major football school with a long history of winning. Back in the 1950s and even into the 60s it was not uncommon for coaches to work their players half to death in searing heat with no water. They believed then that it toughened them up. Read about bud wilkinson at oklahoma and you see the same thing. Also at that time you had a lot of walk ons. Students who played high school football but didn't get a scholarship trying out for the team. These walk ons were treated very cruel as a means of thinning them out quickly. That happened here but it happened everywhere.This is a movie about survival under incredibly tough circumstances. The fact that those circumstances were forced upon them doesn't change that. Bryant loved those 35 men because he knew he pushed them too hard; because he knew he went too far. That is why he wore that ring to his grave And most of those 35 men loved him. The movie depicts a legendary 70 year old coach nervous like a school girl ready to meet these men 25 years later. He doesn't know how many would be there or how they would respond to him. Most were there and most were successful in life and credited junction with preparing them for that success.It is uncertain how bryant's legendary status effected the opinion these men had of him 25 years after the ordeal. We do know that junction is not just an ""appalling"" story.
