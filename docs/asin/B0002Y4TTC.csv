850398,A1J4UEQFQG9WL,B0002Y4TTC,AndyPratt,"[0, 0]","first off i must say i was extremely excited to find that upon recieving this wonderful dvd via mail, that there were 2 discs inside. One with extra commentaries (with english subtitles) along with extra songs not shown on the first disc, and the main disc containing 20 amazing BG songs, all of which I love!Blind Guardian had a marvelous and magical night when this concert was filmed (by at least 20 cameras if i remember correctly) and thus it shows thanks to the wonderful displays of musicianship and vocal talents of Hansii, oh yeah, and the other great things such as the light spectacular, pyro technics, and wonderful use of a catwalk for Hansii. I have never seen that done before for a band (i believe it must have been done by alot of others) but Blind Guardian in my opinion are the only band that should incorporate a catwalk. Hansii seemed to give a more personal connection to the audiance, and the sense that many stories were being told was created better by giving Hansii this freedom to move into the crowd, kind of like a story teller explaining a wonderful fantasy creation via campfire or in a tavern somewhere far beyond.Overall everything from the visuals to the sound quality is remarkably amazing, and i can not get over the wonderfull track listing for the concert. Expecially with ""And Then There Was Silence"" which i never would of imagined BG attempting to do on stage, but not only did they attempt playing it but they succeded in presenting it even better than it is on the cd ""Night of the Opera"" for the most part.all in all this dvd should get 10 out of 5 stars, and if you are a fan of Blind Guardian, either die hard or just appreciate them, then you should view this wonderfull display of creative genius.",5,"thank god, finally the band is presented the way it deserves",1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,1745,"['first', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'i', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'find', 'recieving', 'wonderful', 'dvd', 'mail', 'were', '2', 'discs', 'inside', 'One', 'extra', 'commentaries', 'english', 'subtitles', 'extra', 'songs', 'not', 'shown', 'first', 'disc', 'main', 'disc', 'containing', '20', 'amazing', 'BG', 'songs', 'love', 'Blind', 'Guardian', 'had', 'marvelous', 'magical', 'night', 'when', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'least', '20', 'cameras', 'i', 'remember', 'correctly', 'thus', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'displays', 'musicianship', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Hansii', 'oh', 'yeah', 'other', 'great', 'things', 'such', 'light', 'spectacular', 'pyro', 'technics', 'wonderful', 'use', 'catwalk', 'Hansii', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'done', 'band', 'i', 'believe', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'alot', 'others', 'Blind', 'Guardian', 'opinion', 'are', 'only', 'band', 'should', 'incorporate', 'catwalk', 'Hansii', 'seemed', 'give', 'more', 'personal', 'connection', 'audiance', 'sense', 'many', 'stories', 'were', 'being', 'told', 'was', 'created', 'better', 'giving', 'Hansii', 'freedom', 'move', 'crowd', 'kind', 'story', 'teller', 'explaining', 'wonderful', 'fantasy', 'creation', 'campfire', 'tavern', 'somewhere', 'far', 'beyond.Overall', 'everything', 'visuals', 'sound', 'quality', 'remarkably', 'amazing', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'wonderfull', 'track', 'listing', 'concert', 'Expecially', 'Then', 'Was', 'Silence', 'i', 'never', 'would', 'imagined', 'BG', 'attempting', 'do', 'stage', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'attempt', 'playing', 'succeded', 'presenting', 'even', 'better', 'cd', 'Night', 'Opera', 'most', 'part.all', 'dvd', 'should', 'get', '10', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'fan', 'Blind', 'Guardian', 'either', 'die', 'hard', 'just', 'appreciate', 'then', 'should', 'view', 'wonderfull', 'display', 'creative', 'genius']",N/A

All the best songs are on there (except for Twilight Hall, but thats in the bonus DVD)They dont show much of the bassist or the keyboardist very much at all, and at times theres a serious lack of enthusiasm from the band, but the crowd loves every second of it !!!The problem I had with it is that it has a subtitle option for the concert DVD and all it shows is the name of each song.. In between songs he talks a lot and its all in german, and I was hoping/expecting that the subtitles were of what hes saying, not just the name of the songs...All in all a great first Blind Guardian DVD, I just hope the next one has subtitles of what hes saying !!!!",4,Overall A Great BG DVD !!!,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,736,"['DVD', 'concert', 'great', 'audio', 'amazing', 'picture', 'even', 'better', 'best', 'songs', 'are', 'Twilight', 'Hall', 'thats', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'dont', 'show', 'much', 'bassist', 'keyboardist', 'very', 'much', 'times', 'serious', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'band', 'crowd', 'second', 'problem', 'had', 'subtitle', 'option', 'concert', 'DVD', 'name', 'song..', 'songs', 'lot', 'german', 'was', 'hoping/expecting', 'subtitles', 'were', 'what', 'hes', 'saying', 'not', 'just', 'name', 'songs', 'great', 'first', 'Blind', 'Guardian', 'DVD', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'one', 'subtitles', 'what', 'saying']",N/A
850401,A1KYHRUYFY0STD,B0002Y4TTC,"Orlando G. Alonzo Perez ""ogalonzo""","[1, 3]","3 and a half stars, actually.Let me explain what I didn't like first: specifically, Hansi Kursch's performance. I don't know if he had some trouble with his voice, or if he just simply can't sing what he sings in the studio; lower notes he can reach, but the high pitched stuff he can not. After watching the second DVD I'm thinking that he had some trouble with his voice during the concert on the first DVD, since the four bonus songs sound perfect. With the exception of Hansi's voice, the rest of the band is perfect. Marcus Siepen guitar work is simply amazing, and Thomas Stauch is nothing short of an athlet and a very, very good drummer, and last but not least there's Andr&eacute; Olbrich, wich makes almost all the background guitars. The guest musicians, the keyboardist and bass player don't get much attention from the camera.Some people mentioned BG's members as being very still...personally, I don't care about this, as I don't require the members of a band to be a Freddie Mercury or a Paul Stanley, but...it's true: man, they are *stiffs* onstage!Some minor glitches: at some points the camera shifts views a lot, with pointless views, by the way, and the guest musicians don't get much camera attention.Now, the things I like:As I wrote above, band performance. The set list: covering most of BG's albums, there's a song for almost every fan; hell, even ""And then, there was silence"" is played complete (well, Hansi forgets to sing a line from the song heheh, but that's *one error* in a 14 minute song!). The extras are very good, specially the four bonus songs (I was going to be very angry if I didn't get to see ""Into the storm"", heheh). Did I mention the crowd? hearing all of 'em singing the chorus of the songs it's wonderful! I'm not going to delve into sound and video quality: they're both acceptable, nothing exceptional here.Last but not least, packaging is very good looking.Overall, a pretty good DVD from BG.",3,Very good,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,1942,"['3', 'half', 'stars', 'actually.Let', 'explain', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'specifically', 'Hansi', 'Kursch', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'trouble', 'voice', 'just', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'what', 'studio', 'lower', 'notes', 'can', 'reach', 'high', 'pitched', 'stuff', 'can', 'not', 'watching', 'second', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'had', 'trouble', 'voice', 'concert', 'first', 'DVD', 'four', 'bonus', 'songs', 'sound', 'perfect', 'exception', 'Hansi', 'voice', 'rest', 'band', 'perfect', 'Marcus', 'Siepen', 'guitar', 'work', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Thomas', 'Stauch', 'nothing', 'short', 'athlet', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'drummer', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Olbrich', 'wich', 'almost', 'background', 'guitars', 'guest', 'musicians', 'keyboardist', 'bass', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'camera.Some', 'people', 'mentioned', 'BG', 'members', 'being', 'very', 'still', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'members', 'band', 'be', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'Paul', 'Stanley', 'true', 'man', 'are', '*stiffs*', 'onstage', 'minor', 'glitches', 'points', 'camera', 'lot', 'pointless', 'views', 'way', 'guest', 'musicians', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'camera', 'attention.Now', 'things', 'like', 'wrote', 'band', 'performance', 'set', 'list', 'covering', 'most', 'BG', 'albums', 'song', 'almost', 'fan', 'hell', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'silence', 'played', 'complete', 'well', 'Hansi', 'sing', 'line', 'song', 'heheh', '*one', 'error*', '14', 'minute', 'song', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'specially', 'four', 'bonus', 'songs', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'angry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Into', 'storm', 'heheh', 'Did', 'mention', 'crowd', 'hearing', 'singing', 'chorus', 'songs', 'wonderful', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'delve', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', ""'re"", 'acceptable', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'here.Last', 'not', 'least', 'packaging', 'very', 'good', 'looking.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', 'BG']",N/A
850402,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B0002Y4TTC,S. Morales,"[17, 28]","After all these years, BG has released their first DVD! Now, I was as excited about this one as anyone else, but though I feel I got my money's worth in terms of extras, I don't feel this DVD really went deep into BG as people or wasn't as diverse in terms of the content.The first dvd is a live concert they played in Germany during their last tour as part of a festival they had set up, and it's 20 tracks long. Thier playing skills were fine, and some songs stuck out better than others, but they aren't really a ""showy"" type band, which means that you're not going to see a whole lot of running around or talking, and on top of that, a lot of times the band just doesn't seem into the music, they're just playing for the sake of finishing a song. The band seems to become more relaxed about halfway into the concert, where the show gets a lot better (I was blown away at their ability to play ""...And then there was silence"" the 14 minute diverse as hell track from their latest album,they performed it brilliantly to say the least). But other than the concert, the first disc has nothing else. The picture is very sharp and looks fantastic, but the sound quality was a little rough, although that might have been either the recording, or the band just being somewhat sloppy at playing. they're able to pull off their older thrash metal songs MUCH better than their later songs. Those older tracks are a lot quicker, louder, heavier, and ""fuller"" thus really getting the crowd excited, whereas the newer stuff they hardly played any of and when they did there seemed to be more ""holes"" w/in the guitar lines taking away from the fast and furious excitment. On top of that, the newer stuff calls for a lot more high pitched elongated vocals, which Hansi cannot pull off live, taking a huge bite out of the excitement.The second disc has got a pretty long ""making of"" section. But it's not the ""making of"" any album or anything studio, but actually showing the band setting up for the festival and going into technical jargon on what their roadies are doing (which is pretty uninteresting), although there were a few scenes of BG hanging out w/ fans before the festival, which was fun. One important thing to point out, since this was all filmed in Germany, EVERYTHING, except for the songs themselves is spoken in german, you can set up subtitles but sometimes it isn't enough. There is also a BG interview where they get asked really only a handful a questions which are pretty boring and unneccessary (ex: how do you stay fit? does touring take a tole on your family life? how do you set up before playing?). BG didn't elaborate all that well on answers either, which makes the one part of the DVd where you actually get to know the band pretty much wasted. There is also a boring slideshow which has nothing but far away shots of the concert itself.the thing that bothered me the most was the german speak. During the ""making of"" section, BG basically narrated what they filmed and a lot of times there would be scenes w/ them hanging out together but the subtitles wouldn't show up so you heard them making jokes and stuff but unless you speak german, you have no idea what the hell was going on. There is lastly a few bonus live songs (4 of them) taken from 2 other concerts which were pretty cool and I enjoyed.So though this is cool to watch maybe a couple of times (the first DVD really) I was upset at the diversity of the disc. In Opeth's ""Lamentations"" DVd you at least got to konw the band a little better by going into the studio and having depthful questions being asked and interviewing the members individually. This BG dvd is all about the festival though, and though it was a good show, I simply cannot see the replay value of this, even though there are a handful of good moments. Plus, the $22+ sale price is a bit too much for what you get in return. Not bad, but not great either, just pretty good.
