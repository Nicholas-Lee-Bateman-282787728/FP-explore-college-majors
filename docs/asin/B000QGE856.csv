My first tape recorder did not have sound on sound or multi-track ability. My second had both. Getting the point here? Maybe it's my age group, but Les Paul and his work meant so much on so many levels and here comes a riveting doc on his life. How could I resist it? And well I should not.Les Paul Chasing sound is an awesome story told first hand by an awesome man who changed the course of music and the music business so dramatically. Not only as a player/performer, but as a recording enthusiast and inventor of tools to better record music. That's on the story level.On the production level, PBS and American Masters may very well have outdone themselves with Chasing Sound. I enjoy all of the American Masters profiles from Ella to Bernstein to Rockwell, but this production is simply the best one ever. Maybe it's all the first hand story-telling. Maybe it's all the incredible guitar playing. Maybe it's going into Les' house to see the old stuff laying around and to hear his 'this is how I did it' tales. I can only say that 2 hours into this production I was still sitting tight being entertained by Les Paul... who to this day remains incredibly personabable and insanely entertaining.",5,Awesome,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1278,"['first', 'guitar', 'was', 'knock', 'off', 'gold', 'top', 'Les', 'Paul', 'second', 'was', 'real', 'deal', 'first', 'tape', 'recorder', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sound', 'sound', 'multi-track', 'ability', 'second', 'had', 'Getting', 'point', 'here', 'Maybe', 'age', 'group', 'Les', 'Paul', 'work', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'here', 'riveting', 'doc', 'life', 'How', 'could', 'resist', 'well', 'should', 'not.Les', 'Paul', 'Chasing', 'sound', 'awesome', 'story', 'told', 'first', 'hand', 'awesome', 'man', 'who', 'changed', 'course', 'music', 'music', 'business', 'so', 'dramatically', 'Not', 'only', 'player/performer', 'recording', 'enthusiast', 'inventor', 'tools', 'better', 'record', 'music', 'story', 'production', 'level', 'PBS', 'American', 'Masters', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'outdone', 'Chasing', 'Sound', 'enjoy', 'American', 'Masters', 'profiles', 'Ella', 'Bernstein', 'Rockwell', 'production', 'simply', 'best', 'one', 'ever', 'Maybe', 'first', 'hand', 'story-telling', 'Maybe', 'incredible', 'guitar', 'playing', 'going', 'Les', 'house', 'see', 'old', 'stuff', 'laying', 'around', 'hear', ""'this"", 'how', 'did', 'tales', 'can', 'only', 'say', '2', 'hours', 'production', 'was', 'still', 'sitting', 'tight', 'being', 'entertained', 'Les', 'Paul', 'who', 'day', 'incredibly', 'personabable', 'insanely', 'entertaining']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound
1076197,A969VLBBX8LQ7,B000QGE856,George McAdams,"[14, 14]","This DVD is such a joyous celebration of Les Paul and his life, his influence on the recording industry and his influence on musicians, that for a reviewer, especially a novice one like myself, with so many positives aspects to discuss about this DVD, it would probably be best if I just said, ""Buy it.""But, I can't...  because there just aren't that many quality biographical DVD's out there that have no flaws.In ""Les Paul Chasing Sound,"" you have the life of guitarist extraordinaire Les Paul and his amazing story of taking his guitar talents first to Chicago, and all its jazz clubs, then to New York City, and finally to Hollywood.  As he takes this journey, he shares with the viewer the reasons for his choices, and how each one built upon another.  The editing is superb, with the director choosing clarity for the viewer over continuity, as pieces of interviews conducted in several environments are interwoven to give the viewer an excellent, well thought-out story.Then, there is the story of Les Paul the inventor, as he recounts the set-backs he encountered in developing a solid core electric guitar, first for Epiphone, then Gibson.  It was only after Leo Fender developed the Fender Strat in the early 1950's did Gibson come a calling for Les to show them what his solid body guitar do for them. It is disputed between McGinty of Gibson and Les Paul as to Paul's actual involvement in the process, but there is not doubt that having the name ""Les Paul"" on the head stock didn't hurt sales any.The story isn't always a happy one, the automobile accident on a snowy road broke his right arm so badly that the doctor wanted to cut-it-off; however, another doctor said, ""This man is an amazing musician. We cannot end his musical career that way.""  So, it was decided to set his arm in such as way to allow him to continue to play the guitar.The late 40's and early to mid-50's were glorious times for Les Paul and his wife Mary Ford (original name Colleen Summers, but renamed by Les so that her name would be short in length, like his, and it would fit better on the billboards), as they had Top-Ten hit after hit.  Then, Rock-and-Roll came and his music fell out of favor.I could go on-and-on about the program, but I won't, why should I tell you  everything, but what I will tell you is that this DVD is worth its price just for the extras: the clips of Les playing with Keith Richards, Chet Atkins, Kay Starr, et. al., the full-length performances of him and the Les Paul Trio playing at he Iridium Jazz Club in New York City, clips from TV appearances, and extended conversations featured in the movie that you can view easier as an extra to the DVD.Finally, there's one other reason music lovers and musicians, guitarist or otherwise, should buy and listen to this DVD on Les Paul, there is the exuberance that Les Paul, at 90 years young, still shows for life.I entitled this review ""A Joyous Celebration of Sounds Caught and Thrown Back to Others,"" because, to me, Les Paul took and developed those recording sounds we take for granted today...  sound-on-sound, sound with sound, echo, over-dubbing, and he, like one of those fishermen on a TV fishing show does when he catches a 10 pound bass, throws those concepts back so that others can learn them and make better recordings.This DVD is a celebration, it is a joy to watch, and it gives us so much insight into Les Paul, the evolution of music, especially jazz, in the mid-1900's.",5,A Joyous Celebration of Sounds Caught and Thrown Back to Others,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,3456,"['DVD', 'such', 'joyous', 'celebration', 'Les', 'Paul', 'life', 'influence', 'recording', 'industry', 'influence', 'musicians', 'reviewer', 'especially', 'novice', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'positives', 'aspects', 'discuss', 'DVD', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'just', 'said', 'Buy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'quality', 'biographical', 'DVD', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'flaws.In', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Chasing', 'Sound', 'have', 'life', 'guitarist', 'extraordinaire', 'Les', 'Paul', 'amazing', 'story', 'taking', 'guitar', 'talents', 'first', 'Chicago', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'then', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'finally', 'Hollywood', 'journey', 'shares', 'viewer', 'reasons', 'choices', 'how', 'one', 'built', 'editing', 'superb', 'director', 'choosing', 'clarity', 'viewer', 'continuity', 'pieces', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'several', 'environments', 'are', 'interwoven', 'give', 'viewer', 'excellent', 'well', 'thought-out', 'story.Then', 'story', 'Les', 'Paul', 'inventor', 'set-backs', 'encountered', 'developing', 'solid', 'core', 'electric', 'guitar', 'first', 'Epiphone', 'then', 'Gibson', 'was', 'only', 'Leo', 'Fender', 'developed', 'Fender', 'Strat', 'early', '1950', 'did', 'Gibson', 'come', 'calling', 'Les', 'show', 'what', 'solid', 'body', 'guitar', 'do', 'disputed', 'McGinty', 'Gibson', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'actual', 'involvement', 'process', 'not', 'doubt', 'having', 'name', 'Les', 'Paul', 'head', 'stock', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'sales', 'any.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'always', 'happy', 'one', 'automobile', 'accident', 'snowy', 'road', 'broke', 'right', 'arm', 'so', 'badly', 'doctor', 'wanted', 'cut-it-off', 'however', 'doctor', 'said', 'man', 'amazing', 'musician', 'can', 'not', 'end', 'musical', 'career', 'way', 'So', 'was', 'decided', 'set', 'arm', 'such', 'way', 'allow', 'continue', 'play', 'guitar.The', 'late', '40', 'early', 'mid-50', 'were', 'glorious', 'times', 'Les', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'original', 'name', 'Colleen', 'Summers', 'renamed', 'Les', 'so', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'short', 'length', 'would', 'fit', 'better', 'billboards', 'had', 'Top-Ten', 'hit', 'hit', 'Then', 'Rock-and-Roll', 'came', 'music', 'fell', 'favor.I', 'could', 'go', 'on-and-on', 'program', 'wo', ""n't"", 'why', 'should', 'tell', 'everything', 'what', 'will', 'tell', 'DVD', 'worth', 'price', 'just', 'extras', 'clips', 'Les', 'playing', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'Kay', 'Starr', 'et', 'al.', 'full-length', 'performances', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Trio', 'playing', 'Iridium', 'Jazz', 'Club', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'clips', 'TV', 'appearances', 'extended', 'conversations', 'featured', 'movie', 'can', 'view', 'easier', 'extra', 'DVD.Finally', 'one', 'other', 'reason', 'music', 'lovers', 'musicians', 'guitarist', 'otherwise', 'should', 'buy', 'listen', 'DVD', 'Les', 'Paul', 'exuberance', 'Les', 'Paul', '90', 'years', 'young', 'still', 'life.I', 'entitled', 'review', 'Joyous', 'Celebration', 'Sounds', 'Caught', 'Thrown', 'Back', 'Others', 'Les', 'Paul', 'took', 'developed', 'recording', 'take', 'granted', 'today', 'sound-on-sound', 'sound', 'sound', 'echo', 'over-dubbing', 'one', 'fishermen', 'TV', 'fishing', 'show', 'when', '10', 'pound', 'bass', 'concepts', 'back', 'so', 'others', 'can', 'learn', 'make', 'better', 'recordings.This', 'DVD', 'celebration', 'joy', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'insight', 'Les', 'Paul', 'evolution', 'music', 'especially', 'jazz', 'mid-1900']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound

Power ""nlp trainer""","[1, 1]","Quite often the word genius is bandied about, and given to people who barely deserve it, people who will be little noted nor long remembered.  Let it not be so with Les Paul, one of the most musically innovative people of the twentieth century, whose innovations with sound have inspired generations of musicians.When you listen to the Rolling Stones or The Beatles or Eric Clapton or many other recording artists, the guitar sound you are listening to may be coming from a Les Paul Gibson guitar, or a Les Paul designed pick, one of the first electric guitars ever made, which enabled a revolution in sound, and the evolution of rock and roll.If you listen to The Beatles Eleanor Rigby, Paul McCartney double tracking his own vocals, with 'Ah, look at all the lonely people,' this is thanks to Les Paul's innovation in creating multitrack recording.  Similarly, when Michael Jackson multi tracks his own vocals on 'Leave Me Alone'.  Similarly Paul McCartney's first albumMcCartneywas entirely recorded on a 4 track Studer multi track recorder, with McCartney playing all the instruments.Les Paul started out as a musician, and became an outstanding one, learning his craft as a jazz musician with greats such as Django Reinhardt, and then becoming a recording artist, even collaborating with Bing Crosby, and having numerous hits with his own wife Mary Ford. He had  a desire to multilayer his own musicianship, and his wife's singing, and this inspired his many innovations in sound.You may be familiar with one of his number one hits 'How high the moon,' and if you listen, you can notice his riffs are so quick, dazzlingly fast.  If you're like me, you may find this movie inspiring, and next time you listen to a recording you may wonder what aspect of it may have been made possible by an inventiness and enterprise, and the genius of Les Paul.I hope this review is helpful to you, and I hope you enjoy the movie.",5,It does not get much more inspiring than this.,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1919,"['Quite', 'often', 'word', 'genius', 'bandied', 'given', 'people', 'who', 'barely', 'deserve', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'noted', 'long', 'remembered', 'Let', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'Les', 'Paul', 'one', 'most', 'musically', 'innovative', 'people', 'twentieth', 'century', 'innovations', 'sound', 'have', 'inspired', 'generations', 'musicians.When', 'listen', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Beatles', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'many', 'other', 'recording', 'artists', 'guitar', 'sound', 'are', 'listening', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Gibson', 'guitar', 'Les', 'Paul', 'designed', 'pick', 'one', 'first', 'electric', 'guitars', 'ever', 'made', 'enabled', 'revolution', 'sound', 'evolution', 'rock', 'roll.If', 'listen', 'Beatles', 'Eleanor', 'Rigby', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'double', 'tracking', 'own', 'vocals', ""'Ah"", 'look', 'lonely', 'people', 'thanks', 'Les', 'Paul', 'innovation', 'creating', 'multitrack', 'recording', 'Similarly', 'when', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'multi', 'own', 'vocals', 'Me', 'Alone', 'Similarly', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'first', 'albumMcCartneywas', 'entirely', 'recorded', '4', 'track', 'Studer', 'track', 'recorder', 'McCartney', 'playing', 'instruments.Les', 'Paul', 'started', 'out', 'musician', 'became', 'outstanding', 'one', 'learning', 'craft', 'jazz', 'musician', 'greats', 'such', 'Django', 'Reinhardt', 'then', 'becoming', 'recording', 'artist', 'even', 'collaborating', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'having', 'numerous', 'hits', 'own', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'had', 'desire', 'multilayer', 'own', 'musicianship', 'wife', 'singing', 'inspired', 'many', 'innovations', 'sound.You', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'one', 'number', 'one', 'high', 'moon', 'listen', 'can', 'notice', 'riffs', 'are', 'so', 'quick', 'dazzlingly', 'fast', ""'re"", 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'next', 'time', 'listen', 'recording', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'aspect', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'possible', 'inventiness', 'enterprise', 'genius', 'Les', 'Paul.I', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound

We follow him through his earliest country/hillbilly music phase through his baptism into the Chicago Jazz scene, and off from there to California and New York.  Les on his early on-stage schooling by his great contemporaries:  ""Charlie [Christian, in Harlem] just nailed me right to the wall.  I got beat by everybody.  And rightfully so.  And that's why I learned.  I got the privilege to play with the all greats in their prime.""  Along the way, many of the personalities incidental to American music pop in for well-produced commentary.  I found Les' relationship with one-time wife Mary Ford and his partnership with Chet Atkins to be among the most heartwarming parts of the story.The crafters of the excellent documentary also take full advantage of the music of the era as well as film, video and stills.  This has got to be the definitive film story of the life of this American original, Les Paul, and is a very good companion to other great American music histories.",5,"Les Paul, Sound Pioneer, Still Kicking",1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,1391,"['occasion', 'Les', 'Paul', '90th', 'birthday', 'filmmakers', 'chronicle', 'not', 'just', 'fascinating', 'life', 'inventor', 'hardbody', 'electric', 'guitar', 'slew', 'music', 'technologies', 'life', 'American', 'music', 'most', '20th', 'century.We', 'first', 'mischievous', 'questing', 'Les', 'Polsfuss', 'Wauskeshaw', 'Wisconsin', 'mom', 'phone', 'radio', 'amplify', 'local', 'performances', 'follow', 'earliest', 'country/hillbilly', 'music', 'phase', 'baptism', 'Chicago', 'Jazz', 'scene', 'California', 'New', 'York', 'Les', 'early', 'on-stage', 'schooling', 'great', 'contemporaries', 'Charlie', '[', 'Christian', 'Harlem', ']', 'just', 'nailed', 'right', 'wall', 'got', 'beat', 'everybody', 'rightfully', 'so', 'why', 'learned', 'got', 'privilege', 'play', 'greats', 'prime', 'way', 'many', 'personalities', 'incidental', 'American', 'music', 'pop', 'well-produced', 'commentary', 'found', 'Les', 'relationship', 'one-time', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'partnership', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'be', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'parts', 'story.The', 'crafters', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'also', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'music', 'era', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'video', 'stills', 'got', 'be', 'definitive', 'film', 'story', 'life', 'American', 'original', 'Les', 'Paul', 'very', 'good', 'companion', 'other', 'great', 'American', 'music', 'histories']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound

The interviews with him, alongside original guitars and recording equipment (some now in the Smithsonian) are fascinating. His recollections of working with big names such as Bing Crosby, Mary Ford, and Gibson are priceless. Speaking of Mary Ford - I had never really heard her like this. She was incredibly talented; a female Bing Crosby! Excerpts from Les demonstrating multi-tracking and stories of how he and Mary recorded in the bathroom, the car, and anywhere else where he could get the sound he wanted, make you feel like a part of it all. Les's exuberance for life (I don't think there is one moment in this video where he is not smiling!) continued to the end and this video aptly reveals that. Before I bought this video I thought - Yeah, people say Les Paul did a lot of things... Now I have some idea of the depth and breadth of his contributions.

1076203,A2U30WE12S7YJ9,B000QGE856,NC,"[1, 1]","Now I have to say that this film is NOT a biography about Les Paul. But it does give you a brief insight to his humble beginnings from a small town to his working relationship to Mary Ford and eventually marrying her. (Which the film did not really cover. A fact that I learn only through the historic video that was included in the film.) The film actually does focus on Les Paul and his accomplishment. But to hear the beginnings of his work from the man himself is like sitting in the room with him and feeling history. Lets not forget, the man can still play even in his late age. More importantly you can see and hear it in his music.What's great about this film was that it does illustrate how much of an inventor Les Paul was (like his early works in developing a 4-track recording system)!Overall, this is definitely a great DVD to own, regardless if you're a Gibson lover or a Fender lover.

1076206,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000QGE856,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","I was amazed at how much about Les Paul I learned from this documentary.  I thought I was pretty knowledgeable, since I have a couple of Les Paul and Mary Ford albums.  I was completely unaware how long Les had been active as a professional musician before that.  I vaguely knew that he had played a fair bit for Bing Crosby, but not much more than that.  And of course I was aware of how crucial he had been for the development of recording techniques.  Many regard Tom Dowd as perhaps the most important recording engineer of the past half century, but he was quite upfront that while he took recording technology to the levels that made the recordings of the fifties and sixties and beyond possible, he became aware of the possibilities of the technology from the pioneering work of Les Paul.Although much of the documentary focuses on a recent concert by the Les Paul Trio, fronted by Les shortly after his ninetieth birthday (the man has been a professional musician for over seventy years!), there is a wonderful amount of vintage or archival footage, photos of Les playing guitar with Art Tatum, or footage with Bing Crosby.  As I said, I was amazed at how much he had accomplished before meeting Mary Ford.  But the bits with Mary Ford were exceptionally enjoyable.  I personally think that female pop singing has in recent decades gone completely into the toilet.  I blame Whitney Houston, partly just to have someone to blame but partly because she was one of the singers to popularize taking a syllable and using 6 or 7 notes to express it.  Or as one of the commentators in this documentary might express it, she popularized ""bending"" the notes.  I am, on the other hand, vastly more impressed by purer singers, who can sing a note without the use of needless artifice, and sing in clear, undiluted tones.  Linda Thompson is a singer of this type.  So was Sandy Denny.  And Mary Ford certainly was.  Her voice is so lovely that she doesn't have to use vocal tricks to make what she is singing interesting.The film features a host of really interesting commentators, from music authorities like Gary Giddens to friends to fellow musicians.  Some of them are thrown in simply because they are prominent, even though they have little interesting to say, but several definitely enlighten the topics under discussion.I was a bit surprised that the documentary held off so long in dealing with the one thing about Les Paul that nearly everyone knows about:  his Gibson guitar and how it came about.  They do get to it, but only as the entire affair is beginning to come to a close.  The documentary thus displays the three major ways that Les Paul has had an impact on modern music:  1) the pioneering of sound on sound recording; 2) the creation of the Gibson Les Paul guitar, which is still -- along with the Fender Stratocaster -- the most widely used solid body guitar by professional musicians; and 3) his own music, whether performed as part of the Les Paul Trio, with Mary Ford, or with someone else.On top of all this, the documentary makes him seem like an extraordinarily nice man.  I've seen him interviewed before (for instance, once on Conan O'Brien, where he presented Conan with his very own signature Les Paul guitar) and every time I've seen him he does indeed seem enormously likable.  All in all, this is a fine documentary, celebrating the man, his music, and his enormous contributions to modern music.",5,A wonderful documentary on a seminal figure in music,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,3429,"['was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'Les', 'Paul', 'learned', 'documentary', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'knowledgeable', 'have', 'couple', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'was', 'completely', 'unaware', 'how', 'long', 'Les', 'had', 'been', 'active', 'professional', 'musician', 'vaguely', 'knew', 'had', 'played', 'fair', 'bit', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'course', 'was', 'aware', 'how', 'crucial', 'had', 'been', 'development', 'recording', 'techniques', 'Many', 'regard', 'Tom', 'Dowd', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'recording', 'engineer', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'was', 'quite', 'upfront', 'took', 'recording', 'technology', 'levels', 'made', 'recordings', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'possible', 'became', 'aware', 'possibilities', 'technology', 'pioneering', 'work', 'Les', 'Paul.Although', 'much', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'recent', 'concert', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Trio', 'fronted', 'Les', 'shortly', 'ninetieth', 'birthday', 'man', 'been', 'professional', 'musician', 'seventy', 'years', 'wonderful', 'amount', 'vintage', 'archival', 'footage', 'photos', 'Les', 'playing', 'guitar', 'Art', 'Tatum', 'footage', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'said', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'accomplished', 'meeting', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'bits', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'enjoyable', 'personally', 'think', 'female', 'pop', 'singing', 'recent', 'decades', 'gone', 'completely', 'toilet', 'blame', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'partly', 'just', 'have', 'someone', 'blame', 'partly', 'was', 'one', 'singers', 'popularize', 'taking', 'syllable', 'using', '6', '7', 'notes', 'express', 'one', 'commentators', 'documentary', 'might', 'express', 'popularized', 'bending', 'notes', 'am', 'other', 'hand', 'vastly', 'more', 'impressed', 'purer', 'singers', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'note', 'use', 'needless', 'artifice', 'sing', 'clear', 'undiluted', 'tones', 'Linda', 'Thompson', 'singer', 'type', 'So', 'was', 'Sandy', 'Denny', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'certainly', 'was', 'voice', 'so', 'lovely', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'vocal', 'tricks', 'make', 'what', 'singing', 'interesting.The', 'film', 'host', 'really', 'interesting', 'commentators', 'music', 'authorities', 'Gary', 'Giddens', 'friends', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'are', 'thrown', 'simply', 'are', 'prominent', 'even', 'have', 'little', 'interesting', 'say', 'several', 'definitely', 'enlighten', 'topics', 'discussion.I', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'documentary', 'held', 'off', 'so', 'long', 'dealing', 'one', 'thing', 'Les', 'Paul', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Gibson', 'guitar', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'do', 'get', 'only', 'entire', 'affair', 'beginning', 'come', 'close', 'documentary', 'thus', 'three', 'major', 'ways', 'Les', 'Paul', 'had', 'impact', 'modern', 'music', '1', 'pioneering', 'sound', 'sound', 'recording', '2', 'creation', 'Gibson', 'Les', 'Paul', 'guitar', 'still', 'Fender', 'Stratocaster', 'most', 'widely', 'used', 'solid', 'body', 'guitar', 'professional', 'musicians', '3', 'own', 'music', 'performed', 'part', 'Les', 'Paul', 'Trio', 'Mary', 'Ford', 'someone', 'else.On', 'top', 'documentary', 'seem', 'extraordinarily', 'nice', 'man', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'interviewed', 'instance', 'once', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'where', 'presented', 'Conan', 'very', 'own', 'signature', 'Les', 'Paul', 'guitar', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'indeed', 'seem', 'enormously', 'likable', 'fine', 'documentary', 'celebrating', 'man', 'music', 'enormous', 'contributions', 'modern', 'music']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound

Rest assured that Les is no, not yet at least, mere icon or totem.  Far from a barely preserved specimen wheeled out on stage in a rocker, he maintains his balance on a precarious stool and serves as ringmaster for the Monday night festivities at the Iridium.  Of course, he's surrounded by and partly carried by some ace New York musicians, who enable Les to bask, deservedly, in the spotlight and evade anything resembling breakneck virtuosity on the instrument.This is a five-star DVD for the 90-minute PBS history alone--OR for the 90 minutes worth of extras, such as the Iridium set.  Add the two together, factor in the bargain price, and this disc is nothing less than 180 minutes of indispensable, must viewing.  The audio fidelity and production values are first rate, whether the music is vintage Lester or his more recent musical activities which, for the most part, have gone unrecorded for the past 30 years.  The extras include ""honest"" musical exchanges with Keith Richards and a rare opportunity to see and hear a latter-day Kay Starr, no worse for wear than Les, singing ""Exactly Like You.""  Then there's Merle Haggard and Les doing ""Pennies from Heaven,"" both of them practically honoring the tune's simple melody.  And a delightful duet on ""Avalon"" with Chet Atkins circa 1990 (The secret's out.  The supposedly ""intuitive"" musician Les knows keys! Rather than holding down one finger to signal one flat, he mouths ""F"" to the piano player for his solo turn).One can only hope that some of the guitarists on the ""American Made/World Played"" CD will discover this DVD and subsequently go to some of the pre-1948 Les Paul recordings.  He may not have been a harmonic-melodic genius, but he was a superb technician and tasteful musician in the Django tradition.  His early trio recordings are 2-3 minute masterpieces, and as the featured jazz guitarist to appear at the first Jazz at the Philharmonic in 1944, he and fellow headliner Nat King Cole managed to bring down the house, whether on up-tempo blues or the challenging but always welcome (in fact, the most-recorded pop standard of all time) ""Body and Soul.""",5,"He's not taxidermized, but he's still electrifying.",1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2348,"['ridiculous', 'tribute', 'seemed', 'more', 'cover-up', 'American', 'Made/', 'World', 'Played', 'was', 'beginning', 'suspect', '90-year-old', 'now', '92', 'legend', 'was', 'illusion', 'more', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Wizard', 'Waukesha', 'Rest', 'assured', 'Les', 'not', 'yet', 'least', 'mere', 'icon', 'totem', 'Far', 'barely', 'preserved', 'specimen', 'wheeled', 'out', 'stage', 'rocker', 'balance', 'precarious', 'stool', 'serves', 'ringmaster', 'Monday', 'night', 'festivities', 'Iridium', 'course', 'surrounded', 'partly', 'carried', 'ace', 'New', 'York', 'musicians', 'who', 'enable', 'Les', 'bask', 'deservedly', 'spotlight', 'evade', 'anything', 'resembling', 'breakneck', 'virtuosity', 'instrument.This', 'five-star', 'DVD', '90-minute', 'PBS', 'history', 'alone', 'OR', '90', 'minutes', 'extras', 'such', 'Iridium', 'set', 'Add', 'two', 'together', 'factor', 'bargain', 'price', 'disc', 'nothing', 'less', '180', 'minutes', 'indispensable', 'must', 'viewing', 'audio', 'fidelity', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'music', 'vintage', 'Lester', 'more', 'recent', 'musical', 'activities', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'gone', 'unrecorded', 'past', '30', 'years', 'extras', 'include', 'honest', 'musical', 'exchanges', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'see', 'hear', 'latter-day', 'Kay', 'Starr', 'worse', 'wear', 'Les', 'singing', 'Exactly', 'Then', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'Les', 'doing', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'practically', 'honoring', 'tune', 'simple', 'melody', 'delightful', 'duet', 'Avalon', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'circa', '1990', 'secret', 'out', 'supposedly', 'intuitive', 'musician', 'Les', 'keys', 'Rather', 'holding', 'down', 'one', 'finger', 'signal', 'one', 'flat', 'F', 'piano', 'player', 'solo', 'turn', '.One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'guitarists', 'American', 'Made/World', 'Played', 'CD', 'will', 'discover', 'DVD', 'subsequently', 'go', 'pre-1948', 'Les', 'Paul', 'recordings', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'harmonic-melodic', 'genius', 'was', 'superb', 'technician', 'tasteful', 'musician', 'Django', 'tradition', 'early', 'trio', 'recordings', 'are', '2-3', 'minute', 'masterpieces', 'featured', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'appear', 'first', 'Jazz', 'Philharmonic', '1944', 'fellow', 'headliner', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'managed', 'bring', 'down', 'house', 'up-tempo', 'blues', 'challenging', 'always', 'welcome', 'fact', 'most-recorded', 'pop', 'standard', 'time', 'Body', 'Soul']",Les Paul - Chasing Sound
