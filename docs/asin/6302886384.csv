Like 84 charing cross road or the goodbye girl or say anything.  this one was underrated when it came out I think. I love the taxi driver scene.  Way to make a bit part stand out.

""coals2n""","[1, 2]","This is a complete gem of a film - funny dialogue, adorable characters, quoteable moments, with a sweetness that runs through the whole thing. This is one of those films I'm glad to own...it never disappoints. Bad day + The Night We Never Met = Much, much better day. Be sure to set yourself up by getting some good cheese and wine and a couple other gourmet snacks before watching - seeing Matthew Broderick at the cheese counter in Dean and Deluca will make you crave something exquisite.",5,Fully satisfying...and delicious!,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,490,"['complete', 'gem', 'film', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'adorable', 'characters', 'quoteable', 'moments', 'sweetness', 'whole', 'thing', 'one', 'films', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'never', 'Bad', 'day', '+', 'Night', 'Never', 'Met', '=', 'Much', 'much', 'better', 'day', 'Be', 'sure', 'set', 'up', 'getting', 'good', 'cheese', 'wine', 'couple', 'other', 'gourmet', 'snacks', 'watching', 'seeing', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'cheese', 'counter', 'Dean', 'Deluca', 'will', 'make', 'crave', 'something', 'exquisite']",N/A
