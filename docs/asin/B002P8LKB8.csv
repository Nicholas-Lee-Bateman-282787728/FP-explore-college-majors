1282602,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B002P8LKB8,&#308;&#308;,"[29, 29]","This dancing workout is different from all of the other DWTS workouts.  I was expecting it to be like ""DWTS: Dance Off the Pounds"" but it was totally different.  While in ""Dance Off the Pounds"" each of the three dances was a full routine, some of these dances were not full routines.  Yet, they weren't just moves taught to you.  Let me explain. . .There is no warm-up so you go directly to the first workout.Latin-This 15 minute workout is divided into three 5 minute workouts.  The first one is Rumba, the second Cha-Cha, and the third was a Cha-Cha/Merengue mix.  The back of the box said to expect Mambo, but I didn't really see any Mambo steps except for maybe one.  Maybe.  The Rumba is easy and beginners could probably do it.  Cha-Cha is a bit quicker and it slightly resembles the Cha-Cha routine on the ""Cardio Dance"" DVD.  The Cha-Cha Merengue was nice, but it features some moves that are more ab toning and less dance.  Kym Johnson leads this, and she is a better instructor than in the other video.  However, this section just seemed too feminine.  There were no male backups and the moves were a little slinky.  Focuses on toning abs.Tango-I LOVED this section!  Led by Dmitry Chaplin, it had the same format as the Latin with three 5 minute workouts.  The moves were SO fun.  The music was GREAT!  You really felt like you were really dancing!  Unfortunately, this routine has no real purpose except for teaching some really fun steps.  It is not cardio at all, and while it tries to tone legs, it fails.  At least it does for me.Freestyle-This routine, led by Lacey Schwimmer IS a full routine.  It has NO toning whatsoever, but it takes Jive, Latin, and other steps and adds a hip-hop style to them.  This was a lot of fun, and it was the one routine on the DVD that really got my heart rate up.  It is the only routine on the DVD that I could actually call a workout.Cool Down-Once again, there are no male dancers-not even Dmitry.  I dunno, I think Cal Pozo (the director/choreographer) was going for just women on this DVD.  The stretching wasn't that great.  It was more of just relaxing moves.  You don't stretch ANY muscles except the glutes, and for a split second the hamstrings.  Great choreography in this video.  Unfortunately, it only has light cardio/toning benefits.",4,Toning?

1282605,A3IKFQC64SS4WO,B002P8LKB8,mcel,"[13, 13]","I purchased this with the other DWTS DVD. I definitely prefer ""Dance off the Pounds"" to the ""Dance Body Tone"" DVD.However, it was hard to go into DVD with an open mind since I loved ""Dance Off the POunds"" so much, but if you do, you will find that it is actually a good workout, if you put the energy the instructors have for these moves into it.The first section was Latin dance with Kym. It's called an ""ab blast"" but honestly, I didn't feel as though I was doing anything really strenuous. There is Rhumba, Cha Cha and Merengue here. The moves are pretty good, not fast paced and easy to get down on the first try. But that was the problem I had. It felt more like I was swaying my hips continuously for 15 mins and that's all. I was a little let down with this section and worried that they were reverting back to the older DWTS DVDs. But I was pleasantly surprised that the next day, my abs and hips did feel like they were worked, albeit not sore exactly, but ""stretched out"". So this section DID serve it's purpose.Second up was the Tango/Argentine Tango section with Dmitry. This section was a lot of fun and I felt sexy doing it. I didn't work up a huge sweat since the tango is not a fast dance, and the moves are broken down slowly. But doing the leg flicks you see them do on the show was a lot of fun. Great little section but I really didn't think it was toning anything. Well here I am the day after and let me tell you, was I wrong! My legs and butt are a little sore and I am really surprised. The thing with this section is, you are doing a lot of lunges and steps that you ""sit in"" so you are doing a lot of thigh and glute work! And you don't realize that. So it was a really pleasant surprise.Last up was the Freestyle section with Lacey. Like a previous reviewer said, this was the only section that had a routine all the way through and broke down the moves as you go. This section was a lot of fun and had some cute moves. It got my heart rate up since it was pretty much straight on cardio. This was really the only section that made me tired.Finally there is a 5-6 minutes cool down and stretch to top everything off.Overall this is a good workout. As I was doing it, while it was fun, I wasn't extremely impressed. And I wasn't nearly as exhausted after doing this as I was after the ""Dance off the Pounds"" workout. But I did feel it the next day, so that was a plus. It's nice to know I didn't waste 50 minutes on a workout that did nothing. I think the key here is to REALLY get into the moves and execute them correctly, otherwise you will not get any benefit from this.While I won't reach for this DVD nearly as much as I will the ""Dance Off the Pounds"" workout, this is good for those lighter days when you don't want to workout but really want to do SOMETHING.",4,Better workout than it appears!,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2793,"['purchased', 'other', 'DWTS', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'Dance', 'Pounds', 'Dance', 'Body', 'Tone', 'DVD.However', 'was', 'hard', 'go', 'DVD', 'open', 'mind', 'loved', 'Dance', 'Off', 'POunds', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'will', 'find', 'actually', 'good', 'workout', 'put', 'energy', 'instructors', 'have', 'moves', 'it.The', 'first', 'section', 'was', 'Latin', 'dance', 'Kym', 'called', 'ab', 'blast', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'doing', 'anything', 'really', 'strenuous', 'Rhumba', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'Merengue', 'here', 'moves', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'fast', 'paced', 'easy', 'get', 'down', 'first', 'try', 'was', 'problem', 'had', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'swaying', 'hips', 'continuously', '15', 'mins', 'was', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'section', 'worried', 'were', 'reverting', 'back', 'older', 'DWTS', 'DVDs', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'next', 'day', 'abs', 'hips', 'did', 'feel', 'were', 'worked', 'not', 'sore', 'exactly', 'stretched', 'out', 'section', 'DID', 'serve', 'purpose.Second', 'up', 'was', 'Tango/Argentine', 'Tango', 'section', 'Dmitry', 'section', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'felt', 'sexy', 'doing', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'up', 'huge', 'sweat', 'tango', 'not', 'fast', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'slowly', 'doing', 'leg', 'see', 'do', 'show', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'Great', 'little', 'section', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'toning', 'anything', 'Well', 'here', 'am', 'day', 'let', 'tell', 'was', 'wrong', 'legs', 'butt', 'are', 'little', 'sore', 'am', 'really', 'surprised', 'thing', 'section', 'are', 'doing', 'lot', 'lunges', 'steps', 'sit', 'are', 'doing', 'lot', 'thigh', 'glute', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'really', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Last', 'up', 'was', 'Freestyle', 'section', 'Lacey', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'only', 'section', 'had', 'routine', 'way', 'broke', 'moves', 'go', 'section', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'cute', 'moves', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'cardio', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'section', 'made', 'tired.Finally', '5-6', 'minutes', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch', 'top', 'everything', 'off.Overall', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'impressed', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'exhausted', 'doing', 'was', 'Dance', 'Pounds', 'workout', 'did', 'feel', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'plus', 'nice', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', '50', 'minutes', 'workout', 'did', 'nothing', 'think', 'key', 'here', 'REALLY', 'get', 'moves', 'execute', 'correctly', 'otherwise', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'benefit', 'this.While', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reach', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'will', 'Dance', 'Off', 'Pounds', 'workout', 'good', 'lighter', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'workout', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'SOMETHING']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Body Tone
1282606,A1UCONV2T9LSGE,B002P8LKB8,M. Montalti,"[2, 3]","I borrowed this DVD from the library to preview it before I purchased it.  Some other reviewers commented on the lack of a warm up and the type of instructions given.  I do have to agree with these comments.  The DVD does have a cool down, which is a plus.  First up is Kym, who leads some Latin-style moves.  Not too inspiring, just a lot of hips swaying; I wasn't sure if it really counted as a dance or a workout.  This segment was quite disjointed.  Next was Dmitri, who leads a tango style routine.  His instructions are clear and he does go slow- at least 3 times so you get it.  His routine is more of a routine, but I didn't feel too challenged.  Last is Lacey with Freestyle.  Now, while I didn't care for this style of dance, sort of hip-hop/jive/bouncy, it IS the best workout.  First, it's VERY aerobic and secondly, it is a whole little routine from start to finish.  She breaks it into sections and builds upon what was done.  Then she goes through the whole routine several times.  There's some jumping, so it's not quite low impact.  Of the 3 dances, this one made me feel like I was working out.All in all, I was disappointed and a, glad that I did not purchase this DVD.What I do recommend is the DWTS Latin Cardio with Maks and Cheryl.  It's not perfect and sometimes her instructions are a bit fast, but you feel like you've exercised.  There is a nice warm up and cool down and 4 dances to choose from.",3,Could be better...A little disappointed,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1423,"['borrowed', 'DVD', 'library', 'preview', 'purchased', 'other', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'lack', 'warm', 'up', 'type', 'instructions', 'given', 'do', 'have', 'agree', 'comments', 'DVD', 'have', 'cool', 'down', 'plus', 'First', 'up', 'Kym', 'who', 'Latin-style', 'moves', 'Not', 'too', 'inspiring', 'just', 'lot', 'hips', 'swaying', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'really', 'counted', 'dance', 'workout', 'segment', 'was', 'quite', 'disjointed', 'Next', 'was', 'Dmitri', 'who', 'tango', 'style', 'routine', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'go', 'slow-', 'least', '3', 'times', 'so', 'get', 'routine', 'more', 'routine', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'challenged', 'Last', 'Lacey', 'Freestyle', 'Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'style', 'dance', 'sort', 'hip-hop/jive/bouncy', 'best', 'workout', 'First', 'VERY', 'aerobic', 'secondly', 'whole', 'little', 'routine', 'start', 'finish', 'sections', 'builds', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'Then', 'whole', 'routine', 'several', 'times', 'jumping', 'not', 'quite', 'low', 'impact', '3', 'dances', 'one', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'working', 'out.All', 'was', 'disappointed', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'purchase', 'DVD.What', 'do', 'recommend', 'DWTS', 'Latin', 'Cardio', 'Maks', 'Cheryl', 'not', 'perfect', 'instructions', 'are', 'bit', 'fast', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'exercised', 'nice', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', '4', 'dances', 'choose']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Body Tone
1282607,A1I610BOEJMTGP,B002P8LKB8,Rayna,"[0, 0]","These people cannot teach, the dances are boring, and in general, the dances on this DVD just aren't a lot of fun. And they should be, because besides a workout, that's what dance DVDs are for. They should be fun, just challenging enough to keep them exciting, but not so challenging that you're spending more time standing there confused than dancing. But this one just doesn't have it.Let's start with Kym's section: she seems to confuse talking slowly with teaching well, which is kind of ridiculous. She talks very slowly and calmly, then she does some complicated step without explaining it all--in one instance, she just states the name of a move again and again and does the steps really fast, like all of the audience knows exactly what steps that move entails. Another instance she takes a move too fast when it would've been so much simpler to just slow it down/break it down to explain it, then speed it up.*That's* how you teach people to dance. Also she keeps talking about ""the core"" over and over again...it's like, we get it. You're trying to point out that this is good for your stomach muscles. You're obviously trying really hard to justify this DVD, but it's not working. It's just annoying. And the other two women doing the dance with her look like they think they think they're too good for the DVD or something; the one has the snottiest face the whole time and they're just unpleasant to watch. I guess they couldn't find back up dancers who were fun and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Is that really too much to ask?Then the next dance, with Dmitry, is just boring. It's not active enough or fun enough to get into; I couldn't even finish it out. I didn't feel like I was working out at all. He teaches a bit better, but he frustrated me by constantly using the phrase ""take it from the top"" without clarifying what ""the top"" was...because it was hardly ever the beginning of the dance, but rather some recent arbitrary point. I wanted to say to him, ""Look, you can't say 'take it from the top' every few minutes and start at a different point. It just doesn't work that way.'"" Instead, I thought to myself, ""Who cares? This is boring anyway,"" and went on to the last dance on the DVD.I found the last dance on the DVD boring and the moves kind of silly. And it was weird; she would refer to moves done in the earlier dances on the DVD but then do them differently. It was confusing. And the worst part was I didn't even feel the least bit tired or sweaty after finishing up. I almost always get sweaty and tired doing dance DVDs but this one just left me feeling like I could've gotten more of a workout from a walk.And one more complaint, this not just about this DVD as about too many dance DVDs out there: people buy these to practice in their homes. Now maybe I'm in a tiny minority, but I just don't have the room in my living room to be flying all over the dance floor like they do. You'd think people who choreograph these videos would take that into account but they never seem to. It makes it a lot harder for me to get into a dance when I have to stop halfway through the steps because I ran out of room or stumbled into the couch. Just saying.Anyway, if you're trying to get fit through dance, I would definitely not recommend this or any of The Dancing With the Stars series (I have one other that's as bad as this one). I do have a hip-hop DVD that I really like called 10 Minute Solution Hip Hop Dance Mix so I would recommend that to anyone who's looking for a good dance DVD.",1,One of the worst dance DVDs I've done so far...,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,3521,"['people', 'can', 'not', 'teach', 'dances', 'are', 'boring', 'general', 'dances', 'DVD', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fun', 'should', 'be', 'workout', 'what', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'just', 'challenging', 'enough', 'keep', 'exciting', 'not', 'so', 'challenging', ""'re"", 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'standing', 'there', 'confused', 'dancing', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'it.Let', 'start', 'Kym', 'section', 'confuse', 'talking', 'slowly', 'teaching', 'well', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'very', 'slowly', 'calmly', 'then', 'complicated', 'step', 'explaining', 'one', 'instance', 'just', 'name', 'move', 'again', 'again', 'steps', 'really', 'fast', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', 'move', 'instance', 'move', 'too', 'fast', 'when', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'simpler', 'just', 'slow', 'down/break', 'down', 'explain', 'then', 'speed', 'up', ""*That's*"", 'how', 'teach', 'people', 'dance', 'Also', 'talking', 'core', 'over', 'again', 'get', ""'re"", 'trying', 'point', 'out', 'good', 'stomach', 'muscles', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'trying', 'really', 'hard', 'justify', 'DVD', 'not', 'working', 'just', 'annoying', 'other', 'two', 'women', 'doing', 'dance', 'look', 'think', 'think', ""'re"", 'too', 'good', 'DVD', 'something', 'one', 'snottiest', 'face', 'whole', 'time', ""'re"", 'just', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'back', 'dancers', 'who', 'were', 'fun', 'seemed', 'be', 'enjoying', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Then', 'next', 'dance', 'Dmitry', 'just', 'boring', 'not', 'active', 'enough', 'fun', 'enough', 'get', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'bit', 'better', 'frustrated', 'constantly', 'using', 'phrase', 'take', 'top', 'clarifying', 'what', 'top', 'was', 'was', 'hardly', 'ever', 'beginning', 'dance', 'rather', 'recent', 'arbitrary', 'point', 'wanted', 'say', 'Look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'take"", 'top', 'few', 'minutes', 'start', 'different', 'point', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'Instead', 'thought', 'myself', 'Who', 'boring', 'anyway', 'went', 'last', 'dance', 'DVD.I', 'found', 'last', 'dance', 'DVD', 'boring', 'moves', 'kind', 'silly', 'was', 'weird', 'would', 'refer', 'moves', 'done', 'earlier', 'dances', 'DVD', 'then', 'do', 'differently', 'was', 'confusing', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'least', 'bit', 'tired', 'sweaty', 'finishing', 'up', 'almost', 'always', 'get', 'sweaty', 'tired', 'doing', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'one', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'more', 'workout', 'walk.And', 'one', 'more', 'complaint', 'not', 'just', 'DVD', 'about', 'too', 'many', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'there', 'people', 'buy', 'practice', 'homes', 'Now', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'tiny', 'minority', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'living', 'room', 'be', 'flying', 'dance', 'floor', 'do', ""'d"", 'think', 'people', 'who', 'choreograph', 'videos', 'would', 'take', 'account', 'never', 'seem', 'lot', 'harder', 'get', 'dance', 'when', 'have', 'stop', 'halfway', 'steps', 'ran', 'room', 'stumbled', 'couch', 'Just', 'saying.Anyway', ""'re"", 'trying', 'get', 'fit', 'dance', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'series', 'have', 'one', 'other', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'do', 'have', 'hip-hop', 'DVD', 'really', 'called', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Dance', 'Mix', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'good', 'dance', 'DVD']",Dancing With The Stars: Dance Body Tone
1282608,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B002P8LKB8,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[0, 0]","Very basic menu of each of the dances (custom) or play all (with or without instruction)No warmup.Latin (15 min)Kym Johnson  & 2 backup women -she starts & does the most of the Cucaracha (figure 8 w/step out), also goes over Rumba step, pada berets w/seductive single hip roll, Cumbia, cha-cha variations like the New Yorker & a tight double step twist step & Merengue w/hip roll. Those who never had lessons or haven't tried other Latin dance dvds w/instruction may get lost as she never goes slower then normal tempo & the camera will move away from the feet often. This is mostly lean a step & practice & kinda build into a routine, but I like the practice style more then needing a routine.Tango (15 min)Dimitry Chaplin w/2 women & 2 men -More a balancing/very easy toning, it's slower movements, you won't increase your heart rate. There are almost no leg lifts, just a lot of pointing out & some turns. The music was better here, but the moves felt more like for those with little balance ability, very basics & bit dull. Dimitry actually shows you the moves in 1/2 time once, & what to expect which is refreshing after Kym's lack of teaching.Freestyle (15 min)Lacey Shwimmer w/2 women & 2 men -This is a modified easy combo of some of the moves from the previous sections as well as Hip Hop, Jive, Latin, Broadway, etc. with three different song beats, some more rock & roll, some more Jive, etc. Lacey explains the move beforehand once & shows it in 1/2 time 1x like Dimitry which helps a lot.  This one is the least dull because there is less emphasis on tight control, more looseness & faster tempo in music.Cool Down (5 min)Lacey Shwimmer & Kym Johnson  w/2 women -Basic head & should rolls, chest contractions/rolls, body sways/folds, ballet style side bends, hip bumps & figure 8s, standing fwd bends, yoga seated twist, etc.This series really needs the option of different music or NO music (consumer can play music through other system or headphones w/instruction) & separate section of teaching the moves so the main part is mostly 1/2 tempo & full tempo practice.  Again, the music here & everyone seems very bored/stiff still except maybe Lacey in Freestyle. You don't need fake banter/talking, but you do need to sense the instructors/dancers ARE enjoying or least getting into the moment of the dance even some spontaneity & in the moment comments. THAT'S waht motivates/seems fun to us.
