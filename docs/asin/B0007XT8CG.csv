The first time I heard her with 10,000 maniacs I was interested and began to reflect upon how far her vocal abilities could take her. I find that she often stays at a low whisper, but if you already know of her style, your waiting for that whisper to become a belting cry based in rock & roll. In this Storytellers dvd she mostly succeeds and brings out the Natalie Merchant we all want.The set is short as has been pointed out but it didn't need to be made to look shorter. Yes it was only an hour or more show but did the editors have to do exactly what the broadcast editors did with a chop job. ""These Are Days and ""Life Is Sweet"" are stuck in some corner like they didn't take place in the succession of the concert. The only reason ""These Are Days"" gets a half intro when pressing play is because the original broadcast people wanted to get you going with an upbeat song already in progress.When you select the ""special features"" you get to watch both songs in their entirety but most would prefer to watch a show in sync especially since Natalie says, ""and I'm your storyteller"", but unfortunately it then just ends and you have to go to the menu again to watch some more of the show (which is also not in true succession). Stupid editing. Well now that I've gotten the complaints behind me, the real highlights are ""Carnival"", ""Wonder"", ""Whats The Matter Here"" and ""These Are Days"". When she ratchets up her voice, on a good home system, it smokes. The musicians are mega tight.The horns and prominent strings are nice but may not please everyone. Personally I like Natalie when she sticks to a drums, guitar and keys sound (which she holds mostly to on ""Carnival""). The songs outside of the ones I mentioned are slow burners more geared to a nightclub but with Natalie's voice you can't complain too much.Her Italian girl next store to die for presence hooked into her vocals adds a big plus to the show. Add this dvd to your Natalie Merchant collection (not that there's many shows available) for periodic moments of ""wow.""",4,"Natalie is poetic, sensitive, unique and hot.",1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,2181,"['Natalie', 'Merchant', 'one', 'artists', 'stirs', 'up', 'emotion', 'quadaries', 'life', 'ease', 'voice', 'rips', 'mind', 'first', 'time', 'heard', '10,000', 'maniacs', 'was', 'interested', 'began', 'reflect', 'how', 'far', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'could', 'take', 'find', 'often', 'low', 'whisper', 'already', 'know', 'style', 'waiting', 'whisper', 'become', 'belting', 'cry', 'based', 'rock', 'roll', 'Storytellers', 'mostly', 'out', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'want.The', 'set', 'short', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'made', 'look', 'shorter', 'Yes', 'was', 'only', 'hour', 'more', 'show', 'did', 'editors', 'have', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'broadcast', 'editors', 'did', 'chop', 'job', 'Are', 'Days', 'Life', 'Sweet', 'are', 'stuck', 'corner', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'succession', 'concert', 'only', 'reason', 'Are', 'Days', 'half', 'intro', 'when', 'pressing', 'play', 'original', 'broadcast', 'people', 'wanted', 'get', 'going', 'upbeat', 'song', 'already', 'progress.When', 'select', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'watch', 'songs', 'entirety', 'most', 'would', 'prefer', 'watch', 'show', 'sync', 'especially', 'Natalie', ""'m"", 'storyteller', 'unfortunately', 'then', 'just', 'ends', 'have', 'go', 'menu', 'again', 'watch', 'more', 'show', 'also', 'not', 'true', 'succession', 'Stupid', 'editing', 'Well', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'complaints', 'real', 'highlights', 'are', 'Carnival', 'Wonder', 'Matter', 'Here', 'Are', 'Days', 'When', 'up', 'voice', 'good', 'home', 'system', 'musicians', 'are', 'mega', 'tight.The', 'horns', 'prominent', 'strings', 'are', 'nice', 'may', 'not', 'please', 'everyone', 'Personally', 'like', 'Natalie', 'when', 'drums', 'guitar', 'keys', 'sound', 'mostly', 'Carnival', 'songs', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'are', 'slow', 'burners', 'more', 'geared', 'nightclub', 'Natalie', 'voice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much.Her', 'Italian', 'girl', 'next', 'store', 'die', 'presence', 'hooked', 'vocals', 'big', 'plus', 'show', 'Add', 'dvd', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'collection', 'not', 'many', 'shows', 'available', 'periodic', 'moments', 'wow']",N/A

Natalie opens the set with a short version of These Are Days (the full length performance is also included on the set).  Her Storytellers segment is more musical than stories as she alternates between performances with high lighting to other performances with low lighting to set the mood. Remember, Storytellers is a one hour show, so don't expect outfit changes and real extended versions of the song.  The bonus tracks on the DVD are the full performance of ""These Are Days,"" and ""Life is Sweet.""  Another bonus is that you can choose your audio setting and choose the music only setting.  It's a great intimate setting and the set list is okay. Personally, I would have loved to see Natalie sing ""Like The Weather,"" or ""Trouble Me,"" since a few songs from her 10,000 Maniacs days made the set list, but oh well.  It's great though and one thing I thought was cool is on the back of the booklet included inside of the set is a Natalie Merchant discography as well as a VH-1 Storytellers Timeline.",5,"Natalie Merchant Storytellers is Cool, Good Set List",1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,1138,"['priced', 'just', 'right', 'release', 'perfect', 'gift', '10,000', 'Maniacs', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'fan', 'have', 'DVD', 'think', 'great', 'Natalie', 'set', 'short', 'version', 'Are', 'Days', 'full', 'length', 'performance', 'also', 'included', 'set', 'Storytellers', 'segment', 'more', 'musical', 'stories', 'performances', 'high', 'lighting', 'other', 'performances', 'low', 'lighting', 'set', 'mood', 'Remember', 'Storytellers', 'one', 'hour', 'show', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'outfit', 'changes', 'real', 'extended', 'versions', 'song', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'DVD', 'are', 'full', 'performance', 'Are', 'Days', 'Life', 'Sweet', 'bonus', 'can', 'choose', 'audio', 'setting', 'choose', 'music', 'only', 'setting', 'great', 'intimate', 'setting', 'set', 'list', 'okay', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Natalie', 'sing', 'Weather', 'Trouble', 'Me', 'few', 'songs', '10,000', 'Maniacs', 'days', 'made', 'set', 'list', 'oh', 'well', 'great', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'back', 'booklet', 'included', 'set', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'discography', 'as', 'well', 'VH-1', 'Storytellers', 'Timeline']",N/A
