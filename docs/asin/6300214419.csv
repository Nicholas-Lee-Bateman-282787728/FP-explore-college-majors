212751,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,6300214419,a gentle sound,"[2, 3]","""Mountain Dance"" played Sunday on Jango, a radio player on the internet, and suddenly -bang-I was on a train in New York. And I couldn't remember if  it was ME on a train crossing into thoughts of someone I feel in love with, or if I was recalling a book, or movie and it was so delightful. Honestly what could possibly do that to a human? The music affected it instantly.  I played the piece over and over on youtube until I figured it out. Remembering this movie, recalled watching forever ago-who I was with-the times I saw it in. As I came to CA. It's been so many hard and complicated years ago. But it does seem amazing something could stay with you so long. Like a Mancini tune, say in Silver Streak, this charming piano piece, put me back into my memories of New York when I knew it in the 1970's.This is a romance, complicated by infidelity, about feelings, longings that irrationally can happen in falling in love. It will definitely upset someone who experienced being hurt by infidelity, and it has stayed with me in that strange emotional memory that is outside of my control. I rooted for DeNiro and Streep and I don't know why.  I still like the music, still enjoyed remembering seeing them together in the film and I love train movies. I utterly love movies like this- partially because of the train imagery.No matter what I do the thing I can't bring up is how it ended. I recall how I wanted it to end.

Frank (Robert De Niro,Godfather II) is an architect,in a seemingly happy marriage to Ann (Jane Kaczmarek,Malcolm in the Middle) In the meantime, commercial artist Margaret (Meryl Streep,Silkwood/Bridges of Madison County) is in a cold,unhappy marriage,dealing with the loss of her infant daughter and impending loss of her father. Frank and Margaret meet by chance during Christmastime.""Falling in love"" shows the characters' relationship develop over time. It starts as an innocent friendship--they go to Coney Island, Chinatown,coffee shops. Unlike the four-day affair of Bridges of Madison County,their relationship is in a slow cooker. They struggle with themselves,and the guilt of already being married. Frank confides in his friend (Harvey Keitel,The Piano);Margaret confides in her lusty coworker Isabelle (Dianne Wiest,The Lost Boys) The pair attempt to consummate their relationship-but Margaret puts a stop to it. When she sees Frank's wife and sons,she shamefully covers her face,realizing she is the Other Woman. Patient,long-suffering Ann suspects her husband is drifting away.""Falling in love"" is masterfully done. In most movies these days,adultery is portrayed as a simple,relaxed affair.

212763,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6300214419,Bobby Underwood,"[128, 130]","There is a romantic glow to this very undervalued film. It is a throwback to films of the 40's and 50's. Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep give old style performances to match the story's atmosphere, which is sweet and sentimental. It does not make light of the subject matter of having an affair but instead is a film about finding love itself. In keeping with that theme, the romantic feelings of the two leads are never allowed to reach their natural conclusion. The love that gently blossoms is one of the heart.Frank Raftis (DeNiro) and Molly Gilmore (Streep) are going about their mundane and uninspiring lives amidst the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season in New York when they literally run into each other at a bookshop. Both are married and when they meet again on the train to work, a friendship begins. Even the small prospect of riding to work together is handled gingerly as both are good people who would not want to hurt their spouses.As they become more dependent on each other the moral dilema escalates. There are charming scenes as each almost misses the train, and the chance to talk. Her father is sick and Molly's response is to call Frank. It is the little things that separate this film from others. Frank and Molly fall in love for the reason we all do; because of how we feel about ourselves when we are with that person.When they finally can not stand it anymore they have a clumsy and aborted attempt at making love. Both DeNiro and Streep are wonderful at capturing the moral dilema of two people already married who have found the love of their life. Dianne Wiest has a nice turn as Molly's best friend Isabelle and Harvey Keitel as DeNiro's pal Ed is engaging. Jane Kaczmarek, of television's Malcolm in the Middle fame, gives a nice performance as Franks's wife Ann.This film begins at Christmas and ends at Christmas a year later. It is a sweet and charming film about falling in love and finding happiness. Dave Grusin helps the atmosphere with a nice score that perfectly captures the sweet exhilaration and anguish of Frank and Molly's love. If you enjoy films that deal with love instead of lust, then chances are you'll fall in love with this one. It's a very nice film to own.",5,A Love of the Heart,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,2220,"['romantic', 'glow', 'very', 'undervalued', 'film', 'throwback', 'films', '40', '50', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'give', 'old', 'style', 'performances', 'match', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'not', 'make', 'light', 'subject', 'matter', 'having', 'affair', 'instead', 'film', 'finding', 'love', 'keeping', 'theme', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'reach', 'natural', 'conclusion', 'love', 'gently', 'one', 'heart.Frank', 'Raftis', 'DeNiro', 'Molly', 'Gilmore', 'Streep', 'are', 'going', 'mundane', 'uninspiring', 'lives', 'amidst', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'Christmas', 'season', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'literally', 'run', 'other', 'bookshop', 'are', 'married', 'when', 'meet', 'again', 'train', 'work', 'friendship', 'Even', 'small', 'prospect', 'riding', 'work', 'together', 'handled', 'gingerly', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'hurt', 'spouses.As', 'become', 'more', 'dependent', 'other', 'moral', 'dilema', 'escalates', 'are', 'charming', 'scenes', 'almost', 'train', 'chance', 'talk', 'father', 'sick', 'Molly', 'response', 'call', 'Frank', 'little', 'things', 'separate', 'film', 'others', 'Frank', 'Molly', 'fall', 'love', 'reason', 'do', 'how', 'feel', 'ourselves', 'when', 'are', 'person.When', 'finally', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'anymore', 'have', 'clumsy', 'aborted', 'attempt', 'making', 'love', 'DeNiro', 'Streep', 'are', 'wonderful', 'capturing', 'moral', 'dilema', 'two', 'people', 'already', 'married', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'nice', 'turn', 'Molly', 'best', 'friend', 'Isabelle', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'DeNiro', 'pal', 'Ed', 'engaging', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'television', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'fame', 'nice', 'performance', 'Franks', 'wife', 'Ann.This', 'film', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'year', 'later', 'sweet', 'charming', 'film', 'falling', 'love', 'finding', 'happiness', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'score', 'perfectly', 'sweet', 'exhilaration', 'anguish', 'Frank', 'Molly', 'love', 'enjoy', 'films', 'deal', 'love', 'instead', 'lust', 'then', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'own']",N/A
212764,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,6300214419,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[3, 3]","I ordered ""Falling in Love"" several months ago because of the very fine review by Ed Uyeshima, which I recommend (its one of the more ""helpful"" reviews below).  Most of my reviewing recently has been for ""Vine Program"" books.  Because of my increased reading, it took me a while to get around to watching the film.  Ed's review is more complete and better than mine.  The only reason I'm writing today is to mention a few additional points which contribute to the value of this odd little film.First, I wondered about the level of improvisation which occured between Streep and De Niro during their most important scenes.  The acting is extraordinary and goes well beyond what could possibly be contained in a screenplay or in the best direction.  If you want to see a dozen or so very high quality scenes, you should see this film, watch carefully, and enjoy what these two can do together.  Pay attention to their eye contact (or lack thereof), their timing, and how they both portray a variety of anxiety-ridden situations.Second, because the director did such a nice job with pace and reality, many reviewers were troubled by the apparent disconnection between the scenes of love and affection (after all, the title is ""Falling in Love""), and the very accurately portrayed anxiety, guilt, hurt, and self serving behavior.  This I think is why the movie was interesting to me.  Before someone becomes unfaithul, they have to weigh a thousand times the consequences of deciding (in or out) of fidelity - to their spouse, their children, their friends, and to their personal history of everything which came after they started their lives with the spouse.I could easily imagine Meryl Streep wanting to leave her husband.  He seemed very creepy to me with his odd, stiff, and insensitive behavior.  And how about that ugy 70's beard?  Having unsuccessfully dealt with the loss of a baby made the disfunction of this childless marriage seem realistic.However, the portrayal of De Niro's spouse by Jane Kaczmarek seemed so genuine and decent, that it was difficult to imagine De Niro cheating on her emotionally or physically.  Either way, she still slapped him, and he deserved it.  ""Falling in Love"" wants you to imagine these star-crossed ""lovers"" as wonderful people who are just in bad relationships.  But by the end of the movie, its impossible to associate many decent qualities to either person, particularly the De Niro character. What about his kids?Finally, Meryl Streep is literally gorgeous in this role.  I suppose this is why many men cheat, and it makes his poor behavior more believable.  So they go far enough into the ""affair"" to successfully destroy their existing relationships, but apparently let the resulting discomfort prevent moving into this new relationship.  Then by chance (the same way they met), they meet again and presumably follow through, now that the past relationships have been cleansed.So, as many reviewers raved about the genuine love and affection portrayed throughout this movie, there was also plenty of the selfish as well, so that by the time it ended I felt relieved to be me back in my own life, and not one of these two people.",5,Odd Little Film with Interesting Flaws,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3175,"['ordered', 'Falling', 'Love', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'very', 'fine', 'review', 'Ed', 'Uyeshima', 'recommend', 'one', 'more', 'helpful', 'reviews', 'Most', 'reviewing', 'recently', 'been', 'Vine', 'Program', 'books', 'increased', 'reading', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'watching', 'film', 'Ed', 'review', 'more', 'complete', 'better', 'mine', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'writing', 'today', 'mention', 'few', 'additional', 'points', 'contribute', 'value', 'odd', 'little', 'film.First', 'wondered', 'level', 'improvisation', 'occured', 'Streep', 'De', 'Niro', 'most', 'important', 'scenes', 'acting', 'extraordinary', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'contained', 'screenplay', 'best', 'direction', 'want', 'see', 'dozen', 'so', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'scenes', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'watch', 'carefully', 'enjoy', 'what', 'two', 'can', 'do', 'together', 'Pay', 'attention', 'eye', 'contact', 'lack', 'thereof', 'timing', 'how', 'portray', 'variety', 'anxiety-ridden', 'situations.Second', 'director', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'pace', 'reality', 'many', 'reviewers', 'were', 'troubled', 'apparent', 'disconnection', 'scenes', 'love', 'affection', 'title', 'Falling', 'Love', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'hurt', 'serving', 'behavior', 'think', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'someone', 'unfaithul', 'have', 'weigh', 'thousand', 'times', 'consequences', 'deciding', 'fidelity', 'spouse', 'children', 'friends', 'personal', 'history', 'everything', 'came', 'started', 'lives', 'spouse.I', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'wanting', 'leave', 'husband', 'seemed', 'very', 'creepy', 'odd', 'stiff', 'insensitive', 'behavior', 'how', 'ugy', '70', 'beard', 'Having', 'unsuccessfully', 'dealt', 'loss', 'baby', 'made', 'disfunction', 'childless', 'marriage', 'seem', 'realistic.However', 'portrayal', 'De', 'Niro', 'spouse', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'seemed', 'so', 'genuine', 'decent', 'was', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'De', 'Niro', 'cheating', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'way', 'still', 'slapped', 'deserved', 'Falling', 'Love', 'imagine', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'wonderful', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'relationships', 'end', 'movie', 'impossible', 'associate', 'many', 'decent', 'qualities', 'person', 'particularly', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'What', 'kids', 'Finally', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'literally', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'suppose', 'why', 'many', 'men', 'cheat', 'poor', 'behavior', 'more', 'believable', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'affair', 'successfully', 'destroy', 'existing', 'relationships', 'apparently', 'let', 'resulting', 'discomfort', 'prevent', 'moving', 'new', 'relationship', 'Then', 'chance', 'same', 'way', 'met', 'meet', 'again', 'presumably', 'follow', 'now', 'past', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'cleansed.So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'raved', 'genuine', 'love', 'affection', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'plenty', 'selfish', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'ended', 'felt', 'relieved', 'be', 'back', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'people']",N/A

212777,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300214419,Ed Uyeshima,"[43, 45]","I have a certain fondness for this movie, and twenty years later, it still gets to me. I first saw this movie in a theater during a bleak Chicago winter, and the coziness of this romantic fable warmed me at the right time. Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro - probably at the height of their respective careers in 1984 as respected, Method-style actors and bankable stars - have certainly had more challenging roles to play than the two married suburbanites here, Molly and Frank, who develop a strong attachment to one another by way of train rides back and forth  from Westchester to Manhattan. In fact, this movie does not even have the emotional gravity of Noel Coward's ""Brief Encounter"", which screenwriter Michael Cristopher is apparently mimicking with a mid-eighties sensibility. There are even excellent actors in supporting roles - Harvey Keitel as Frank's best friend going through his own transition, Dianne Wiest as Molly's sex-obsessed best friend, Jane Kaczmarek as Frank's content but guarded wife, David Clennon as Molly's emotionally unavailable husband - but none are given much to do, other than to be left to their own unstated thoughts and observe what's going on with the main characters.Yet the film has a certain pervasive charm and a subtle sense of intimacy that makes it seem more substantial than it has any right to be. There is a certain improvisational element to the two lead performances that contributes to this feeling and makes the characters easy to like despite upscale lifestyles that appear more appropriate in a Pottery Barn catalog. You do believe these two characters are hesitantly falling in love, and the scene where they try to make love for the first time has an aching honesty that deepens the story at the right moment. Leave it to Streep and DeNiro to make it all look so authentic in spite of some silly Hollywood story conventions, such as the ""boy meets girl"" meeting over a passel of Christmas packages at Rizzoli's or the one-year-later denouement that ends naturally on a crowded commuter train...as if there was real suspense in how the story would end.  Even putting ""The End"" on the screen induces an aura of Hollywood artifice.Regardless, the little moments are what provide the most pleasure here....the way Molly explains how she has made mu-shu pork with Aunt Jemima's pancake mix; how Frank practices his line for the ""accidental"" run-in with Molly; the montage of silly, Dallas/Dynasty-era outfits that Molly tries on to look good for Frank. These moments provide a nice counterbalance to the more predictable scenes of regret and guilt that are inevitable with this story. Ulu Grosbard directs the actors with a sure hand, though the pacing drags at times, especially toward the end when he suddenly tries to build some suspense with a speeding car in a downpour. Dave Grusin provides a nice, FM-lite score highlighted by ""Mountain Dance"", the syncopated theme that plays throughout the movie. This film is definitely recommended for those seeking Hollywood-style romance with two acting heavyweights who inject some nice realism into a slight story.",4,"Streep, DeNiro and Little Moments Transcend Formula Romance",1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,3115,"['have', 'certain', 'fondness', 'movie', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'bleak', 'Chicago', 'winter', 'coziness', 'romantic', 'fable', 'warmed', 'right', 'time', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'probably', 'height', 'respective', 'careers', '1984', 'respected', 'Method-style', 'actors', 'bankable', 'stars', 'have', 'certainly', 'had', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'play', 'two', 'married', 'suburbanites', 'here', 'Molly', 'Frank', 'who', 'develop', 'strong', 'attachment', 'one', 'way', 'train', 'rides', 'back', 'forth', 'Westchester', 'Manhattan', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'emotional', 'gravity', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Cristopher', 'apparently', 'mimicking', 'mid-eighties', 'sensibility', 'are', 'even', 'excellent', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Frank', 'best', 'friend', 'going', 'own', 'transition', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Molly', 'sex-obsessed', 'best', 'friend', 'Jane', 'Kaczmarek', 'Frank', 'content', 'guarded', 'wife', 'David', 'Clennon', 'Molly', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'husband', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'be', 'left', 'own', 'unstated', 'thoughts', 'observe', 'what', 'going', 'main', 'characters.Yet', 'film', 'certain', 'pervasive', 'charm', 'subtle', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'seem', 'more', 'substantial', 'right', 'be', 'certain', 'improvisational', 'element', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'feeling', 'characters', 'easy', 'like', 'upscale', 'lifestyles', 'appear', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Pottery', 'Barn', 'catalog', 'do', 'believe', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'hesitantly', 'falling', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'try', 'make', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'aching', 'honesty', 'story', 'right', 'moment', 'Leave', 'Streep', 'DeNiro', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'authentic', 'spite', 'silly', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'conventions', 'such', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'meeting', 'passel', 'Christmas', 'packages', 'Rizzoli', 'one-year-later', 'denouement', 'naturally', 'crowded', 'commuter', 'train', 'was', 'real', 'suspense', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'end', 'Even', 'putting', 'End', 'screen', 'aura', 'Hollywood', 'artifice.Regardless', 'little', 'moments', 'are', 'what', 'most', 'pleasure', 'here', '.the', 'way', 'Molly', 'how', 'made', 'mu-shu', 'pork', 'Aunt', 'Jemima', 'pancake', 'mix', 'how', 'Frank', 'practices', 'line', 'accidental', 'run-in', 'Molly', 'montage', 'silly', 'Dallas/Dynasty-era', 'Molly', 'look', 'good', 'Frank', 'moments', 'provide', 'nice', 'counterbalance', 'more', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'regret', 'guilt', 'are', 'inevitable', 'story', 'Ulu', 'Grosbard', 'actors', 'sure', 'hand', 'pacing', 'drags', 'times', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'suddenly', 'build', 'suspense', 'speeding', 'car', 'downpour', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'nice', 'FM-lite', 'score', 'highlighted', 'Mountain', 'Dance', 'syncopated', 'theme', 'movie', 'film', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'seeking', 'Hollywood-style', 'romance', 'two', 'acting', 'heavyweights', 'who', 'inject', 'nice', 'realism', 'slight', 'story']",N/A

If you are into complete 100% realism, then you would have a bone to pick with this film. I mean true love... if you believe in love at first sight; you could probably believe that two strangers' chance meeting could be the beginning of something beautiful. Or if hardened by cynicism, you'd probably say, nay it'd never happen --it's just boredom in life's routine. But one thing that can't be ignored is the acting. Any two actors might've played Frank and Molly in this low-keyed way (and been as good), but it is the fact it's De Niro and Streep together (reunited from ""The Deer Hunter"") that keeps the picture watch able. The minimal mundane dialogue and what they did with the material was a moving portrayal in this film.Ms. Streep portrays Molly Gillmore, a doctor's wife and commercial artist; and De Niro, Frank Raftis, a construction foreman, husband and father of two young boys. Fate brings the two together on a Metro North commuter train from Westchester County into Manhattan, in New York. Molly and Frank are good, moral suburbanites who just happen to be ""Falling In Love,"" all the time struggling to remain loyal to their respective families.Maryl Streep, to me mainly, has done her part on this film. She is not only natural and luminous, but you even don't think that she's acting! She's lived this whole life through! The way she's hesitating whether she should stop the affair with a married man (DeNiro) or just let it all be. The way she struggles herself and this new feeling that doesn't allow her to lead her normal life anymore is believable as well. You won't doubt a minute that she's feeling all this. As for De Niro even though he's an actor he always embodies such charisma and sex appeal, he's able to carry himself as such a regular simple man-all that there is to him is that he is in love with a married woman other than his wife.I also liked how the film does not try to justify adultery at the same time. There are some nice nostalgia vis-a-vis sumptuous New York winter bustle scenes of Grand Central Station, Rizzoli's on Fifth Ave, hot dog vendors, high-eighties hair and clothing fashions. The score by Dave Grusin (Mountain Dance) completed this movie and is just amazing till this day.

Their marriage values translates into guilt, as their respective marriages, now barren of love, fall apart and they put geography between them. But an unplanned meeting at the place of their first encounter revives their mutual love in a heart-stopping final scene in which they are determined to let nothing stand in their way again.

It was so romantic! My grandmother too loved the film when she saw it on video and it has become like a practice for us to see the film every once in a while on DVD especially when it is Christmas time to relive how wonderful and heartwarming this movie is which is timed at Christmas. I became an instant Meryl Streep fan when I first saw this movie. A very underrrated film I must say but one of her best. I simply love how this film shows how two people meet by chance and then later on when they decide to meet by choice and framed within a New York setting during Christmas time when people are going through the holiday rush. The music by Dave Grusin (I loved how he used Mountain Dance throughtout the film) is perfect and the magnificent ending is really one for the books - one of the best endings I have ever seen in the movies. The film also captures Meryl and Robert at their youthful best! Meryl was so beautiful in this film and Robert was really leading man handsome which spelled magic in their wonderful scenes together. This film ranks among my favorite films of all time because of its simplicity and beauty.

It is a different kind of love story though..the two main protagonists played by Robert de Niro and Meryl Streep are married to other people, yet a chance encounter leads to another meeting, and eventually a friendship develops...this later moves on to something more deep, an attraction and love that transcends everything else. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore...there is no gratutious sex or foul language, just a slow simmering attraction that grows from strength to strength. The two leads are good people who don't really want to hurt their respective spouses, and so their moral dilemma...how do they realise their true feelings for each other whilst not hurting their spouses? Adultery is such a delicate subject, yet is handled here with gentleness and finesse. De Niro & Streep give exacting performances, with tremendous depth and insight into the psyche of a pair of 'lovers' who desire to be with each other yet also want to remain faithful to their marriage vows.
