710833,A3LRFGYJVXKPDI,B00006BS6Z,Bennett Turk,"[9, 20]","""In Memoriam"" is a 1 hour HBO documentary about the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on NYC.  It has former mayor Rudolph Giuliani talking about what he and his co-workers did that day, and for a few days afterwards.  There is a lot of camera footage showing the planes crashing into the World Trade Centers; people falling to their deaths, and the buildings coming down.  There is film of ""ground zero"", (where the WTC came down), and the numerous funerals that followed. The personal loss of 9-11 is shown when numerous friends of his, as well as the husband of a female assistant, are among the 3000+ killed. Almost nothing is said about the Pentagon, or Shanksville, PA.  There is no footage of the empty pit where the WTC used to stand.  Extras are limited to a map of lower NYC, where various events took place, and not much else.  Nothing is said about an apparently accidental plane crash that occured in Rockaway, NYC in Oct. 2001, which also affected relatives of the victims of 9-11. No metion is made of the anthrax attacks on the USA, either. I do recommend this video, but, I feel it is much too short to do 9-11 justice.  The ideal 9-11 documentary should be at least 3 hours long, and have a lot more information.  This is more of a personal recollection of 9-11 by Mr. Giuliani, and how he, (and some others in NYC), reacted to the 9-11 attacks.",4,"Excellent, but, much too short and too limited focus.",1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,1355,"['Memoriam', '1', 'hour', 'HBO', 'documentary', '9/11/01', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'NYC', 'former', 'mayor', 'Rudolph', 'Giuliani', 'talking', 'what', 'co-workers', 'did', 'day', 'few', 'days', 'afterwards', 'lot', 'camera', 'footage', 'showing', 'planes', 'crashing', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centers', 'people', 'falling', 'deaths', 'buildings', 'coming', 'down', 'film', 'ground', 'zero', 'where', 'WTC', 'came', 'down', 'numerous', 'funerals', 'followed', 'personal', 'loss', '9-11', 'shown', 'when', 'numerous', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'husband', 'female', 'assistant', 'are', '3000+', 'killed', 'Almost', 'nothing', 'said', 'Pentagon', 'Shanksville', 'PA', 'footage', 'empty', 'pit', 'where', 'WTC', 'used', 'stand', 'Extras', 'are', 'limited', 'map', 'lower', 'NYC', 'where', 'various', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Nothing', 'said', 'apparently', 'accidental', 'plane', 'crash', 'occured', 'Rockaway', 'NYC', 'Oct.', '2001', 'also', 'affected', 'relatives', 'victims', '9-11', 'metion', 'made', 'anthrax', 'attacks', 'USA', 'either', 'do', 'recommend', 'video', 'feel', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'do', '9-11', 'justice', 'ideal', '9-11', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'least', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'information', 'more', 'personal', 'recollection', '9-11', 'Mr.', 'Giuliani', 'how', 'others', 'NYC', 'reacted', '9-11', 'attacks']",N/A

Probably the biggest attack to occur against Americans since Pearl Harbor back in 1941 9/11 would become an event of bewildering confusion and terror as four commercial airliners were hijacked by Muslim terrorists with the intent to crash them into buildings of importance. Two of the airplanes would crash into the twin towers in New York City known as the World Trade Center. One of the airplanes would be sent to crash into the Pentagon outside Washington DC. The fourth airplane never made it to its destination, believed to be either the White House or the Capitol Building, and crashed instead in a field in Pennsylvania when the passengers on board rose up to take on the terrorists and try to take over control of the aircraft.""In Memoriam"" was made by HBO and deals exclusively with the events that took place in New York City and the World Trade Center. They had exclusive access to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his executive staff who talked about what happened and what they went through that day dealing with the worst catastrophe to ever occur in the city. Through out the documentary in between interviews with Mayor Giuliani and his staff HBO uses different video shots from various news agencies showing the events as they unfolded as well as from civilians who were there that morning. Still photos again both from news agencies and civilians are also shown as well and many of the videos and pictures are not pleasant to look at. But no matter how gruesome some of the visuals may be they all come together to form and document not only the horror and tragedy but the heroic acts as well as people took the time and risk trying to help others to get away from the inferno that was going on all around them. For all the gory scenes that may be seen in this documentary it is important not to forget just what happened as we remember those who perished that day.There have been some great documentaries produced dealing with that morning in New York but ""In Memoriam"", along with the Gedeon Brothers documentary ""9/11"", is I think the best of the best in describing what was occurring that day.

It shows raw footage of first one, then another plane crashing into the World Trade Center towers.  It includes footage taken from an NYPD helicopter that circled the tower but was unable to land on the roof.  A man is shown waving a towel from one of the open windows on a very high floor, but there was nothing they could do to rescue him.  It has disturbing footage of people jumping to their deaths, as then mayor Rudolph Guiliani and others watch in horror.  It shows the first tower collapsing as the person filming it keeps yelling, ""Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!""  It shows the next tower collapsing and the huge cloud of smoke and debris speeding down the street as people run for their lives.  The aftermath of the attacks is also included, showing the streets and people covered with soot and choking for air.REFLECT:  The courage of the police, the firefighters, and all emergency workers shines through the dark smoke and rubble, as they rush to the scene to try and save as many lives as they can.  The strength of mayor Guiliani and his staff, as they try to restore order to the chaos, is remarkable.  The grief and sadness while watching a succession of funerals is heartbreaking.  Watching this DVD documentary stirs up many strong emotions, as the wounds from those events have not fully healed.RESPOND:  We can't forget the unjustified terrorist attacks that occurred on American soil on that fateful day.  We can respond by donating time and money to September 11 charitable foundations to help America recover from these vicious terrorist attacks.  Net proceeds from the sale of this DVD are donated to the Twin Towers fund.

It is only fitting that having taken place in the 21st century, the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center is the most documented event in history. ""In Memoriam- New York City, 9/11/01"" tries to compile as much footage and information possible for a 60 minute film to give us a visual documentation of what took place on that dark, unforgettable day. For many who weren't in New York on September 11 this will be one of the first films that will truly give you a sense of what it was like to be there, some viewers probably won't realize the actual extent of the attack and damage until they view this film. The interviews and eyewitness accounts are priceless and important, one of the key uses of film as a whole is to preserve events and memories for future generations so they can know what happened and what they should prevent from happening. The images are incredible, the film shows us in chronological order the sequence of events. Each event ranging from the first airplane crash to the final tower collapse is shown from various angles, some close, some far away. The original sound is preserved and so when the second plane hits the WTC, we hear the actual crash and explosion, never has such documentary footage sent a chill down my spine. One of the most haunting moments is the section dealing with victims who threw themselves from out of the towers as they burned, the use of ""Adagio For Strings"" gives this sequence a heartwrenching, visceral feel and you begin to realize the extent of the horror of what people saw. Rudolph Guliani's comments are fascinating and very heartfelt as well as the commentary from members of his staff. What ""In Memoriam"" does for viewers who are only familiar with the events of September 11 through news broadcasts is give them a true feel of the enormous scope, emotional and historical, of the attacks. It is not a political film, it is not biased (in fact, the filmmakers include a shot of a Muslim funeral for one of the attack victims), it is simply a document of what happened in New York City. This is one of those films that must be shown in schools and sought after by anyone trying to inform themselves.
