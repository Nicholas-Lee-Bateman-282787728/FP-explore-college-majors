I also am disturbed by the fact that you are getting only 8 episodes with no extras (not even an episode guide), but are paying full price. I can only suggest you do as I did and wait until someone puts it on sale. I bought my copy for $12 during a sale on Amazon a few weeks back (a very short sale - the sale price was only up for a few hours) and so don't feel I overpaid. I would not pay full price for this set.As far as the show itself - it is great. More of the crazy action you have come to expect from Eureka along with great tension and plot lines. If you enjoy off beat stories and being able to escape into a really fun world for a few hours, you should pick up Eureka.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[96, 107]","There's some not-so-pleasant changes in store for the little town of Eureka.""Eureka Season 3.0"" (meaning the first half of the third season a la ""Battlestar Galactica"") provides plenty of those, which adds some new tension to geniustown (including some rather shocking cast changes and a new ""love-to-hate"" person). It's kind of disconcerting to only have eight episodes, but they have the signature mixture of warm comedy and intriguing sci-fi mystery.Among the changes in store: Alison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) and Nathan (Ed Quinn) contemplate remarriage, and Henry is in jail. And the DOD sends in a corporate ""fixer"" named Eva Thorne (Frances Fisher) arrives to cut the deadwood from Global Dynamics. But then an anti-missile VIPER drone goes AWOL during a flight test and starts threatening Eureka, while Thorne decides to embed herself in Global Dynamics as one of the new bosses.And while Eva ruthlessly makes GD ""profitable,"" the usual sci-fi disasters crop up. Carter has to deal with bizarre transformations in a sealed biosphere, a wedding-day timeloop, exploding biomemetic dogs, an impossible volcano brewing under Eureka (and which sprays gross fluids on people), an inept spandex-wearing ""Captain Eureka,"" a mayoral election heated up by an artificial supernova, and a swarm of ancient Egyptian insects.In the meantime, Thorne is snooping around Eureka in search of something. Her quest leads to the discovery of a vast military base, and some bodies dead since 1939 -- and a bizarre substance that threatens Zoe's life after she slips and falls in it.Apparently the once all-important Artifact is yesterday's business, because the dark subplot of ""Eureka Season 3.0"" is the mystery prewar bunker and whatever Thorne wants destroyed. It adds a nice undercurrent of conspiracy and tension to this season, though the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff, and how he tries to deal with the Horrific World-Ending Scientific Crisis of the day.That's a nice balance, because the rest of the season flows in a river of gentle humor and extreme scientific problems. Plenty of weird inventions (cloud sculpting, flying rabbits and robot pooches), fun tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""They killed the infected and burned the city to the ground."" ""Let's call that Plan B""), and hilarious comedic moments. And Carter's always in the middle of it, trying to unravel a way to fix things.But it's worth noting that while the Disasters Du Jour and the bunker plots are dealt with by the eighth episode, the half season ends with a cliffhanger for one character. Just sayin'.Ferguson does a brilliant job as Carter, the down-to-earth Everycop who just wants to do his job (""It's all fun and games until someone gets cursed""). But Carter has some new problems in this season -- his new-agey, pregnant sister moves in with him, and Zoe continues to spread her wings with a job and boyfriend. Erica Cerra's Jo experiences some relationship woes, while Richardson-Whitfield's Alison is put in the position of being pretty powerless. Sadly, a longtime cast member also exits the scene early on.This season also sees the return of Henry, whose skills turn out to be too invaluable for him to rot in prison -- and he even gets a new job on top of his old one.  And Fisher turns out to be a great addition: she initially makes a great steely-eyed corporate dictator, but the facade cracks as time goes on, and we get to see that she's haunted by something terrible in the past.""Eureka Season 3.0"" is way too short (new episodes coming in July), but it still has the fresh mix of out-there sci-fi and small-town comedy.

In any event, I feel that it's irrelevant for fans of the series. For us, the content here is still outstanding, and we will gladly watch the ongoing adventures of Carter, Zoe, Henry, Lupo, Fargo, and friends. This season featured a really strong story arc (a first for the show). Although the climax is somewhat disappointing (the grand ""secret"" did not blow my socks off), it's still an enjoyable story. More important, the weekly crises that occur every episode are as enjoyable as ever.My favorite of this season was ""Show Me The Mummy"". One of the great things about this SyFy show is that it always finds a clever way to insert scientific theory into the crisis that besieges the town, even when it's something like classic monster mythology on the menu.I purchased the first two seasons, but now I just watch them on Netflix streaming. The reason? It's the only way to watch Eureka in HD. For some reason, this show has never been made available for purchase on Blu-ray, and consumers are forced to purchase it on DVD.

Would they print this show on VHS, if they had a warehouse full of old tapes? And then tell us we had to buy it on THAT?

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Because I always say: When you can't think of a punchy review title, go 'head and quote those Danny Elfman lyrics.Hidden somewhere in the Pacific Northwest is the remote (and top secret) tiny town of Eureka, home to America's most brilliant and eccentric scientists, all of whom are poking a curious collective finger into the mysteries of the universe. In Eureka, first impressions play false. A 9-year-old girl, for her school project, creates a dwarf star. The maintenance guy is the guy who maintains time. The dry cleaning woman once conducted research on invisibility (okay, this last one's from Season 2). Sheriff Jack Carter, who comes across as just regular folks, doesn't have the smarts to match Eureka's high-IQ'd populace, but he does have a knack for keeping the peace and digging up world-shattering secrets and for saving the day time and again. A single dad, Jack even finds time to raise his precocious 17-year-old daughter Zoe.Like it or not, EUREKA - SEASON 3.0 collects only the first eight episodes of the third season, but that's still enough to keep Sheriff Carter up to his neck in busy. Maybe the most significant thing to happen early on is the arrival of Eva Thorne a.k.a. the Fixer. Thorne is a corporate performance evaluator and she's come to make Global Dynamics more cost-effective. This translates to the scrapping of the more unproductive projects at G.D. and also to staff downsizing. The word ""redacted"" is used so many times, you could launch a drinking game off it. And with stats indicating that incidents have only spiked since Jack's arrival, Thorne doesn't think much of the town Sheriff. And needless to say, the Fixer is nursing a hidden agenda which factors in Eureka's past, a sprawling underground complex 'neath the town, and also a mysterious purply substance called ""Element X."" That there is our thru-storyline for these eight episodes.Catching up with our cast: The love triangle is just about winding down, what with Jack stepping aside gracefully as Allison and Nathan plan for their wedding. Henry Deacon, incarcerated for about three minutes, is simply too valuable to languish behind bars, and he's soon back in Eureka, all pardoned and, we assume, back to his good guy ways. Zoe gets a job at Cafe Diem, and it's really nice to see how she's developed into a normal teenager. Eureka is truly her home now.The show's writers are really brilliant at making the hard science accessible enough to the viewers. They're also very good at injecting that cool sci-fi/fantasy element. Strong storytelling aside, Sheriff Carter is the key ingredient, acting as our surrogate eyes and pretty much behaving as we of average intellect would when some big brain is trying to explain away the science mumbo jumbo. Jack usually responds with a befuddled look or a remark like: ""I'm sure I'd be impressed if I knew what that meant."" And I love that.Sheriff Jack Carter's case files are a bit more bizarre and challenging than just nabbing two good ol' boys driving a rebel red Dodge Charger or a truck driver and his chimpanzee (if you know your '80s shows). If Jack were to list his outlandish job experiences in Eureka on some future resume, his prospective employer would, well, call security. Where else can a Sheriff investigate a locked room mystery in a sealed bio-sphere? Or end up living the same day over and over? Or go up against a sentient robot attack drone... named Martha? Or receive an unwanted assist from a bumbling superhero called Captain Eureka? And, really, Pharaohpalooza? And Best In Show for robot dogs? And that's not even half of the mad science that greets Jack in these first eight episodes. The poor residents of Eureka are forced to evacuate so many times they must have perpetual whiplash.What else? Putting a crimp in Jack's family life, his exasperating hippie sister, Lexy, shows up. Eureka gets a new mayor, and it's not Zoe's 17-year-old boyfriend (who did campaign for the job). And a central character dies. Episode 8 - ""From Fear to Eternity"" - reveals the mystery behind Eva Thorne, and is anyone at all surprised that there's a doomsday device in the equation? This isn't even half the season over.One sort of misses the tame days when the enigmatic Artifact was the big McGuffin. (And, oh yeah, whatever happened to the Artifact?) Maybe we find out in Season 3.5. And maybe we don't. In Eureka, expect the unexpected.Sarah, the Carters' sassy smart house, continues to be one of my favorite characters.Bonus stuff: Audio Commentary on ""Bad to the Drone"" (with executive producer Jaime Paglia and Visual Effects Producer Matthew Gore); Podcast Commentaries from this and that producer and writer on 5 episodes (""Bad to the Drone,"" What About Bob?"", ""Best in Faux,"" ""I Do Over,"" and ""Show Me the Mummy""); Deleted Scenes for all 8 episodes; and the ""Creating A Musical Personality"" featurette focusing on the musical scoring of the show (00:18:30 minutes long).",4,"""Plastic tubes and pots and pans, bits and pieces and magic from the hand.

1249200,ADVRSHBI35H97,B00242KD1S,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[36, 39]","Due to the writers' strike two years ago, all scripted shows were unfortunately shortened, resulting in seasons where it was months between new episodes. For some shows, the wait was too long and some were eventually cancelled due to poor ratings.Luckily, for fans of Eureka, the creators simply split the season into two parts; an eight episode arc, which aired last July, and the second one, which premieres this July. The result is a longer season spread over two years, much like Battlestar Galactica. Some may call the upcoming episodes Season Four, but it's technically the second half of Season 3.In any event, the first half of Season 3 is now out on DVD, just in time for the premiere of the remaining season. And while short on episodes, the show was at the top of it's game this season. I don't know about you, but to me this show is like comfort food. I love the characters and I love the world they inhabit. A perfect cast led by Colin Ferguson get the most out of the sometimes unbelievable situations. I won't go into the whole story arc, suffice to say that there is a new arrival in Eureka, who harbors a big secret about the town's past. And as the saying goes, out with old and in with the new, as SPOILER ALERT! a regular cast member departs midway through.So while it might be frustrating to only have eight episodes here (and I watched all of them in one afternoon!), I personally prefer quality over quantity. My only grief with this set is a lack of an episode guide. That, and it would have been great to have the musical promo they did before the first episode last year! It was terrific and it's kind of a tease that they mention it in the music featurette and show a clip of it too, but not the whole thing.

1249202,A1ER7YUQG62RQ5,B00242KD1S,JD,"[4, 4]","I was sorry to see the ratings of this incredible funny, fast paced, sometime almost slapstick show brought down by reviewers who are upset because of the split season need to buy the show in two separate, dare I say, tranche.  The reviewers do not address what a great and entertaining series this is.  Although the network runs it at odd times, like 6 months apart, it is well worth the wait for the next season, be it part one or part two.That said, Eureka takes place in a mythical town financed by the Department of Defense to develop weapons and technology for use in defense as well as the betterment of mankind, however the later use somehow always ends up like a weapon and threatens to blow the town apart.  Jack Carter, the sheriff, is hilarious in his role as the stumbling cop lacking the brilliance of all the Nobel laureates in the town or the understanding of the technology that nearly kills him in each episode, much less his ability to ever pronounce it correctly.  However, in every episode he is the one that puts all the parts together to prevent near Armageddon when the technology runs amok and he saves the day.His interactions with Zoe, his daughter and the various characters at Global Dynamics are well played and full of subtle and not so subtle irony as this non-technocrat saves the day while the rest of the cast looks like a scatter pattern.  The writers and directors have done a brilliant job of taking something that is borderline science with a lot of fiction and making folly and fodder out of what we would like to think are brilliant ideas and inventions.There is a serious side to the show that forms the backbone around which all the antics take place.  Season two was the most serious with the death of Henry's wife.  I found some of the episodes to be a bit on the dark side but this was all undone in season three.  Attributing malicious intent from one of the major characters towards Carter and the town just did not work for me.If you have not watched this series do give it a try and take it for what it is, a slight drama with a lot of comedy, some just plain whacky stuff.",5,This is the funniest whackiest show,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,2123,"['was', 'sorry', 'see', 'ratings', 'incredible', 'funny', 'fast', 'paced', 'sometime', 'almost', 'slapstick', 'show', 'brought', 'down', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'upset', 'split', 'season', 'need', 'buy', 'show', 'two', 'separate', 'dare', 'say', 'tranche', 'reviewers', 'do', 'not', 'address', 'what', 'great', 'entertaining', 'series', 'network', 'odd', 'times', '6', 'months', 'apart', 'well', 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'be', 'part', 'one', 'part', 'said', 'Eureka', 'place', 'mythical', 'town', 'financed', 'Department', 'Defense', 'develop', 'weapons', 'technology', 'use', 'defense', 'as', 'well', 'betterment', 'mankind', 'however', 'later', 'use', 'somehow', 'always', 'up', 'weapon', 'blow', 'town', 'apart', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'sheriff', 'hilarious', 'role', 'stumbling', 'cop', 'lacking', 'brilliance', 'Nobel', 'town', 'understanding', 'technology', 'nearly', 'episode', 'much', 'less', 'ability', 'ever', 'pronounce', 'correctly', 'However', 'episode', 'one', 'parts', 'together', 'prevent', 'Armageddon', 'when', 'technology', 'amok', 'day.His', 'interactions', 'Zoe', 'daughter', 'various', 'characters', 'Global', 'Dynamics', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'full', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'irony', 'non-technocrat', 'day', 'rest', 'cast', 'scatter', 'pattern', 'writers', 'directors', 'have', 'done', 'brilliant', 'job', 'taking', 'something', 'borderline', 'science', 'lot', 'fiction', 'making', 'folly', 'fodder', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'are', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'serious', 'side', 'show', 'backbone', 'antics', 'take', 'place', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'most', 'serious', 'death', 'Henry', 'wife', 'found', 'episodes', 'be', 'bit', 'dark', 'side', 'was', 'undone', 'season', 'three', 'Attributing', 'malicious', 'intent', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'towards', 'Carter', 'town', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'me.If', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'series', 'do', 'give', 'try', 'take', 'what', 'slight', 'drama', 'lot', 'comedy', 'just', 'plain', 'whacky', 'stuff']",Eureka: Season 3.0

I hope they don't cancel the show but come out with a creative way to solve this problem. The writers should have been ashamed of themselves. As much as I do think they deserve to get a part of the sales of the DVD's etc. they need to demand that in their writers contract per network or movies or all they write. If the network wants good writers which they invariably do then they will sign them writers up with these perks and residuals. But by punishing the viewers...who are as much a victim of the game as anyone it's just unfair.

1249233,A3NSD5S76N2F8I,B00242KD1S,Shawn S.,"[5, 5]","Recently had the TV on the SciFi channel, not paying a whole lot of attention to it and then found myself being pulled into a couple Eureka episodes that ran concurrently.  So I ordered Season 1.  And then Season 2.  And a couple minutes ago, after watching the episodes back-to-back, I finished season 3.What a great find this show is!  Ensemble shows, well executed, are a special treat.  The actors of Eureka have excellent chemistry with one another, each and every one of them.  These are terrific characters making the most of the unique and fascinating premise behind the town and there is a good balance between stand-alone stories and continuing arcs.At first glance on TV, Eureka seemed a bit goofy for my tastes.  I watch few TV shows.  Favorites of the past decade have been The X-Files, Battlestar Gallactica, Lost and Jericho.  Epic, even dark, shows.  What Eureka has in common with these shows is a cast that you cannot help but care about as they come to care about one another.  Eureka is an extraordinary town populated by extraordinary people and that makes for compelling television.Considering what going to a film costs, less than $20 for several hours of this fantastic show is a tremendous bargain.  And all the Season DVDs have a lot of deleted scenes that are interesting to watch.  It's so great to discover a show that's already got a couple seasons out on DVD.  But now I'm all caught up and eagerly awaiting the July 10 season premiere.",5,My new favorite show!,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,1467,"['Recently', 'had', 'TV', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'not', 'paying', 'whole', 'lot', 'attention', 'then', 'found', 'being', 'pulled', 'couple', 'Eureka', 'ran', 'concurrently', 'ordered', 'Season', '1', 'then', 'Season', '2', 'couple', 'minutes', 'ago', 'watching', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', 'finished', 'season', '3.What', 'great', 'find', 'show', 'Ensemble', 'shows', 'well', 'executed', 'are', 'special', 'treat', 'actors', 'Eureka', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'one', 'one', 'are', 'terrific', 'characters', 'making', 'most', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'town', 'good', 'balance', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'continuing', 'arcs.At', 'first', 'glance', 'TV', 'Eureka', 'seemed', 'bit', 'goofy', 'tastes', 'watch', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'Favorites', 'past', 'decade', 'have', 'been', 'X-Files', 'Battlestar', 'Gallactica', 'Lost', 'Jericho', 'Epic', 'even', 'dark', 'What', 'Eureka', 'common', 'shows', 'cast', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'care', 'come', 'care', 'one', 'Eureka', 'extraordinary', 'town', 'populated', 'extraordinary', 'people', 'compelling', 'television.Considering', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'costs', 'less', '20', 'several', 'hours', 'fantastic', 'show', 'tremendous', 'bargain', 'Season', 'DVDs', 'have', 'lot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'so', 'great', 'discover', 'show', 'already', 'got', 'couple', 'seasons', 'out', 'DVD', 'now', ""'m"", 'caught', 'up', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'July', '10', 'season', 'premiere']",Eureka: Season 3.0

But, you have to remember the writer's strike and they want to get the old episodes out there before new ones start up again. I'm almost positive they won't do that with season 4.
