720086,A24D0BK3BX8ID8,B00006L93Q,"BDT ""Prey 4 Gina""","[12, 14]","It was easy to get through this entire movie, don't get me wrong. It is just definitely not worth a second viewing because you know you didn't miss anything. This is a documentary focusing on boys going to the be-all end-all circuit party, the White Party (or is it White Ball?). They got a group of three guys (Scott, Jason and Todd) who, while interesting, really don't add much to the overall point of the movie. The Jason has and Scott IS dating Todd when the movie is filmed. If anything they show us the most average experience one might have at a circuit party. Their personal drama is what makes their segments interesting but in the end does nothing more than prove something that could have happened at any club or watering hole anywhere.The next boy is Tone (prounounced Tony and hereafter spelled Tony cuz spelling Tony as Tone is just stupid). He is the junkie of the experimental grouping. We have all heard tales of how bad the drugs are at these parties and he is supposed to be the posterboy for that addiction. If he is the worst of it, I am not nearly as worried as I was. He was, at best, a part-time junkie. Don't get me wrong, Tony does have a drug problem, but did not seem nearly as profound as we are led to believe.The last boy is Brandon, who is the one who has never been to one of these circuit parties before. Again, nothing profound. His segment does show how even a straight lace like Brandon can easily give into the ""atmosphere"" of those parties which was interesting.Overall, this movies does not offer anything about circuit parties that you do not already know. I am saying that as someone who has never even thought about going to one. But, as someone who has never gone it was interesting to see some of the inner-workings and what not. The non-stop scenes full of shirtless hotties does help this movie's case. All of the five main boys are pretty cute, too.One thing about this movie is the selection of those five main boys. It introduces more guys but does not go into their 'characters' too much, which is a shame. I wanted to know more about all the second class characters as the main boys I had figured out early on. The movie limited itself far too much, it should have been longer and more indulgent on the ugly side of circuit parties.If you have been to a circuit party (even a minor one, I am guessing) you don't need to see this movie. You already know. If not, it is worth a look but just don't go out of your way to see it.",3,Didn't fly close enough to the sun,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,2478,"['was', 'easy', 'get', 'entire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'just', 'definitely', 'not', 'second', 'viewing', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'documentary', 'focusing', 'boys', 'going', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'circuit', 'party', 'White', 'Party', 'White', 'Ball', 'got', 'group', 'three', 'guys', 'Scott', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'who', 'interesting', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'point', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'IS', 'dating', 'Todd', 'when', 'movie', 'filmed', 'anything', 'show', 'most', 'average', 'experience', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'circuit', 'party', 'personal', 'drama', 'what', 'segments', 'interesting', 'end', 'nothing', 'more', 'prove', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'club', 'watering', 'hole', 'next', 'boy', 'Tone', 'prounounced', 'Tony', 'hereafter', 'spelled', 'Tony', 'cuz', 'spelling', 'Tony', 'Tone', 'just', 'stupid', 'junkie', 'experimental', 'grouping', 'have', 'heard', 'tales', 'how', 'bad', 'drugs', 'are', 'parties', 'supposed', 'be', 'posterboy', 'addiction', 'worst', 'am', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'worried', 'was', 'was', 'best', 'part-time', 'junkie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Tony', 'have', 'drug', 'problem', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'nearly', 'as', 'profound', 'are', 'led', 'believe.The', 'last', 'boy', 'Brandon', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'circuit', 'parties', 'Again', 'nothing', 'profound', 'segment', 'show', 'how', 'even', 'straight', 'lace', 'Brandon', 'can', 'easily', 'give', 'atmosphere', 'parties', 'was', 'interesting.Overall', 'movies', 'not', 'offer', 'anything', 'circuit', 'parties', 'do', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'am', 'saying', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'thought', 'about', 'going', 'one', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'gone', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'inner-workings', 'what', 'not', 'non-stop', 'scenes', 'full', 'shirtless', 'hotties', 'help', 'movie', 'case', 'five', 'main', 'boys', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'too.One', 'thing', 'movie', 'selection', 'five', 'main', 'boys', 'more', 'guys', 'not', 'go', ""'characters"", 'too', 'much', 'shame', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'second', 'class', 'characters', 'main', 'boys', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'early', 'movie', 'limited', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'more', 'indulgent', 'ugly', 'side', 'circuit', 'parties.If', 'have', 'been', 'circuit', 'party', 'even', 'minor', 'one', 'am', 'guessing', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'look', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'see']",When Boys Fly

Humphries,"[5, 6]","I was not remotely interested in seeing a documentary about pretty party boys, but as a result of circumstances beyond my control see it I did.  I was quite surprised to find a rather watchable film which provided a skimming-the-surface view into a world that I am quite unfamiliar with.The not very deep nature of the investigation is entirely appropriate given the topic and the utterly vague and vacuuos nature of the people that the filmmaker chose to focus on.  You can't help but watch this sometimes bizarre, always self-absorbed and yet compellingly vacant group of people talking earnestly to the camera as though they are providing important anthropological insights - and, ironically, perhaps they are.It does not make the people or the parties look particularly appealing, and it generated a lot of laughs from the audience that I saw it with, but I do think that many young gay men will identify with the topics of the film.

Though not all agree that its always a true case with everyone that loves to go to the dance parties for the love of the music and the scenery. It can be said that for a few that get caught up of the mystery of addiction, drugs, and sex when all get mixed up in one setting, that it can take a toll of friendships, relationships and the human body.
