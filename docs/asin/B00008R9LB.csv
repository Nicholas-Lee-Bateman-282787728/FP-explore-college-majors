Second, he is drunk most of the film.  I confess knowing little about Shane and the Pogues history, so this caught me by surprise.  To his fans, this is no biggee.  But I gradually got pulled into the story - both his life and his music. By end of film I was sold. A great story & facinating man.  Just when you think all his brain cells are gone, he says or does something that surprises you.  And the music is fun too.  I'm now buying his old albums (best of) and a solo effort (the snake), and many of the songs are featured on this dvd.  As I have told many friends, Shane is a combination of Keith Richards, Tom Waits, and Ozzy Osborne, all rolled into one.  No kidding. Bottom line, you'll either love it or scratch your head and say ""who the hell is this sorry bastard!  Most of the interviews drunk and chain smoking (note the yellow fingers). And a laugh that sounds like a tire going flat....but all I can say is I started out rating it one star, and ended up giving it four.  After a few whiskeys I give it a 5.

Shane has this reputation as Ireland's greatest alcoholic artist since Brendan Beehan.  When the film started i thought 'damn, can't understand a word the guy's saying! he's drunk all the time!' then you realize A)his teeth are all screwed up and B)he has a heavy accent so even stone cold sober you probably can't understand half of what he says till you're used to it!As for the GREAT DEBATE - did he quit the Pogues or was he thrown out? - who cares? every divorce has two conflicting stories. And besides, the Pogues reunited this year for a tour.Now to the meat. While no documentary can function as a definitive picture of an individual, this one gives a us a solid view of shane's early years and family life. I remember some people slagging him off as 'not really Irish' because he grew up in London as a teenager. That's a ridiculous statement and the proof of it is that you can't find Londoners sitting around the kitchen table of the family cottage in Co. Tipperary with three generations all hugging and talking and laughing. The scenes of Shane back home are truly touching and blow away the public personna of the wreckless alcoholic.Just watching Shane as he ambles through his day, writes a song at home, poses for pictures with fans, etc. is worth the price of admission because there is absolutely NO pretense with this guy. What you see is what you get. What you get isn't always pretty, but it's honest.Good insights into who and what the Pogues were from guitarist Phil Chevron, nice comments from Shane's dad and altogether worthwhile. And what a crazy laugh the guy has!

I may be biased because I have a thing for Shane MacGowan and find him to be a person of great intellect, magnetism and appeal.  With that being said, I just love this documentary.  It's a great blend of music clips, concert footage and introductions to Shane's life and family.  Yes there are some disconcerting facts that come with Shane's life but there are disconcerting facts in all of our lives.  I mostly found this documentary to be very uplifting and was pleased to be in the midst of him enjoying a night out and spending time with his family and friends.  In fact he seems like such an amicable soul and a kind one to others that you almost want to jump in the DVD and join him.  There are interviews with Shane, Nick Cave, Philip Chevron (who is very eloquent) and Shane's family and friends.  I know it doesn't seem possible to present such a well-rounded blend in the given time but this documentary does it succesfully.  It even finds time to relate information from Shane's time with the Nips.  I think any huge fan of Shane MacGowan would enjoy this - personally from me it drew sympathy for Shane's low times and great joy for the fact that he has such a beautiful family, great friends, and is someone who upholds his culture and is who he is with the greatest of hearts.  I've always loved the Pogues and have found the Popes to be an excellent band and I'm of the firmest belief that Shane MacGowan is the one in a million poet with the golden voice - I know fans of this music will not be dissapointed.  I've found it a bit difficult to acquire other things such as The Great Hunger and the concert at the Town and Country but I wish there was far more on dvd to be seen.",5,WELL ROUNDED AND VERY SUCCESSFUL,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1765,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'become', 'favorite', 'thing', 'watch', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'have', 'thing', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'find', 'be', 'person', 'great', 'intellect', 'magnetism', 'appeal', 'being', 'said', 'just', 'love', 'documentary', 'great', 'blend', 'music', 'clips', 'concert', 'footage', 'introductions', 'Shane', 'life', 'family', 'are', 'disconcerting', 'facts', 'come', 'Shane', 'life', 'are', 'disconcerting', 'facts', 'lives', 'mostly', 'found', 'documentary', 'be', 'very', 'uplifting', 'was', 'pleased', 'be', 'midst', 'enjoying', 'night', 'out', 'spending', 'time', 'family', 'friends', 'fact', 'amicable', 'soul', 'kind', 'one', 'others', 'almost', 'want', 'jump', 'DVD', 'join', 'are', 'interviews', 'Shane', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Philip', 'Chevron', 'who', 'very', 'eloquent', 'Shane', 'family', 'friends', 'know', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possible', 'present', 'such', 'well-rounded', 'blend', 'given', 'time', 'documentary', 'succesfully', 'even', 'time', 'relate', 'information', 'Shane', 'time', 'Nips', 'think', 'huge', 'fan', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'would', 'enjoy', 'personally', 'drew', 'sympathy', 'Shane', 'low', 'times', 'great', 'joy', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'family', 'great', 'friends', 'someone', 'who', 'culture', 'who', 'greatest', 'hearts', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Pogues', 'have', 'found', 'Popes', 'be', 'excellent', 'band', ""'m"", 'firmest', 'belief', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'one', 'million', 'poet', 'golden', 'voice', 'know', 'fans', 'music', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', ""'ve"", 'found', 'bit', 'difficult', 'acquire', 'other', 'things', 'such', 'Great', 'Hunger', 'concert', 'Town', 'Country', 'wish', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'dvd', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

Elizabeth Pietrzak ""driftingcloud""","[19, 40]","If I Should Fall From Grace, The Shane MacGowan Story provides a rare glimpse into the phenomenon that was Shane MacGowan and The Pogues. Shane is presented here in raw form, with all of the real effects of the heavy alcohol and drug use showing unabashedly their deadly effects on the human body. If nothing else, this DVD shows what the real effects of the rock and roll lifestyle are in a long term prognosis. Either you clean up at some point or you pass the point of no return. MacGowan has long passed the point of no return. The talented and charismatic song writer and performer is reduced to the latter glory of a mumbling rambling caricature. He has become at best one of the boys on the ""Old Main Drag"" and has no recourse but to accept his fate.MacGowan receives a recognizable welcome wherever he goes, a sort of Irish hero, but when the camera pulls back, reality shows that he is an anti-hero. The locals who are fawning all over him are turning him into a myth. The myth becomes obvious when MacGowan's post-Pogues clips are shown. MacGowan is not the fantastic songwritier so many claim him to be. He may have been so at one point, but he is no longer. And his replacement backup band, The Popes come off as amateur players unable to give a single lick a moment of life. What few glimpses of the Pogues we get from live footage and videos, by comparison, underline what a massive force this 9 piece team really was. Remove one player, as the Pogues did for the last two albums, and the edge is lost but talent remains. Remove eight players, as what happened with MacGowan, and the magic completely disappears. This footage underscores the power and magic that was the Pogues and how the breakup of the band came too late to save MacGowan.This DVD provides rare footage of early Pogues and even earlier footage of  The Nipps; also included is footage from Elvis Costello's producing sessions of Rum, Sodomy and the Lash. Interviews include Philip Chevron of the later Pogues line-up, The Pogue's tour manager, and Nick Cave, who is a close friend of MacGown and a groundbreaking songwriter in his own right. But realize that this DVD is about MacGowan. Pogues fans will not get enough of the Pogues that they want. And there is this constant push from everyone around MacGowan to make him bigger than he really was. Add to that the fact that the voices of 10 years of Pogues band members are mysteriously missing. The Shane MacGowan story has huge holes without the direct contributions of the rest of the Pogues' former line-up. Save your money on this one. Rent it if you need to see some Pogues history. Or rent it if you need to do a character study of a broken man. Otherwise, pass on this and get any one of the Pogues albums. Pick one, any one, pre- or post-MacGowan. You can't go wrong. There hasn't been a single Irish band since the Pogues to compete with the fluidity and the raw energy. This band was a once in a century phenomenon, and glorifying one member of the band over the rest will not change that fact.",2,Mixed reviews of this history,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,3039,"['Should', 'Fall', 'From', 'Grace', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'Story', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'Pogues', 'Shane', 'presented', 'here', 'raw', 'form', 'real', 'effects', 'heavy', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'use', 'showing', 'unabashedly', 'deadly', 'effects', 'human', 'body', 'nothing', 'else', 'DVD', 'what', 'real', 'effects', 'rock', 'roll', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'long', 'term', 'prognosis', 'clean', 'up', 'point', 'pass', 'point', 'return', 'MacGowan', 'long', 'passed', 'point', 'return', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'song', 'writer', 'performer', 'reduced', 'latter', 'glory', 'mumbling', 'rambling', 'caricature', 'become', 'best', 'one', 'boys', 'Old', 'Main', 'Drag', 'recourse', 'accept', 'fate.MacGowan', 'recognizable', 'welcome', 'wherever', 'sort', 'Irish', 'hero', 'when', 'camera', 'back', 'reality', 'shows', 'anti-hero', 'locals', 'who', 'are', 'fawning', 'are', 'turning', 'myth', 'myth', 'obvious', 'when', 'MacGowan', 'post-Pogues', 'clips', 'are', 'shown', 'MacGowan', 'not', 'fantastic', 'songwritier', 'so', 'many', 'claim', 'be', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'one', 'point', 'longer', 'replacement', 'backup', 'band', 'Popes', 'come', 'off', 'amateur', 'players', 'unable', 'give', 'single', 'lick', 'moment', 'life', 'What', 'few', 'glimpses', 'Pogues', 'get', 'live', 'footage', 'videos', 'comparison', 'underline', 'what', 'massive', 'force', '9', 'piece', 'team', 'really', 'was', 'Remove', 'one', 'player', 'Pogues', 'did', 'last', 'two', 'albums', 'edge', 'lost', 'talent', 'remains', 'Remove', 'eight', 'players', 'what', 'happened', 'MacGowan', 'magic', 'completely', 'footage', 'power', 'magic', 'was', 'Pogues', 'how', 'breakup', 'band', 'came', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'MacGowan.This', 'DVD', 'rare', 'footage', 'early', 'Pogues', 'even', 'earlier', 'footage', 'Nipps', 'also', 'included', 'footage', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'producing', 'sessions', 'Rum', 'Sodomy', 'Lash', 'Interviews', 'include', 'Philip', 'Chevron', 'later', 'Pogues', 'line-up', 'Pogue', 'tour', 'manager', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'who', 'close', 'friend', 'MacGown', 'groundbreaking', 'songwriter', 'own', 'right', 'realize', 'DVD', 'MacGowan', 'Pogues', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Pogues', 'want', 'constant', 'push', 'everyone', 'around', 'MacGowan', 'make', 'bigger', 'really', 'was', 'Add', 'fact', 'voices', '10', 'years', 'Pogues', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'Shane', 'MacGowan', 'story', 'huge', 'holes', 'direct', 'contributions', 'rest', 'Pogues', 'former', 'line-up', 'Save', 'money', 'one', 'Rent', 'need', 'see', 'Pogues', 'history', 'rent', 'need', 'do', 'character', 'study', 'broken', 'man', 'Otherwise', 'pass', 'get', 'one', 'Pogues', 'albums', 'Pick', 'one', 'one', 'pre-', 'post-MacGowan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'been', 'single', 'Irish', 'band', 'Pogues', 'compete', 'fluidity', 'raw', 'energy', 'band', 'was', 'once', 'century', 'phenomenon', 'glorifying', 'one', 'member', 'band', 'rest', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'fact']",N/A

I have always had a healthy respect for Irish music (in different forms), and theirs is certainly different.  This is an excellent presentation of Shane's life (with and without the Pogues) with many insightful interviews with family and friends, as well as some outstanding music clips and videos I had never seen.  Interviews with the man himself reveal much more than what you see on the surface.  On the one hand, it's sad to see someone in the constant state he's in, which ranges from tipsy to downright bombed.  On the other hand, he still has a fairly quick wit and some really great memories to share.  One would hope that he's still got some tunes in him somewhere, although he hasn't put out any new material in about 7 years.  He seems to have patched up his differences with his former mates, The Pogues, and does the occasional tour with them as well.  How much longer will he be with us?

We are of course, speaking of the one and only Shane Macgowan.  Through much of the documentary it is quite obvious that our subject is teetering on the edge of passing out, but that doesn't prevent him from some brilliant moments of clarity and poetic commentary.The documentary takes us through Shane's early days as a troublemaker at school, abusing pain pills, and eventually dropping out to later form the Nips (shortened from their true name so as not to appear sexist) where he fist began performing in England.  Next we move on to the earliest days of the pogues and the real meat & potatoes of their repetoire.  Shane and the other commentators give insight to how the songs came about, their production, and the eventual toll touring took on the band's health.Next we move onto the Pogues at their peak, the ""If I Should Fall from Grace with God"" era, which is treated just as so in the film.  Then begins the rapid decline of Shane's health, the band breaks up, yadda-yadda-yadda.  Differing viewpoints are given, but nevertheless, Shane was put out to pasture.While the film is chock full of great music videos and live performances with and without the Pogues, I feel that the director did not give any time to Shane's new band, the Popes.  I had the pleasure of seeing them perform at Guinness Fleadh '98, and they are an equally vibrant band that seems to fit well with Shane's continuing self-abuse through chemistry.  Perhaps their inclusion would have merely reinforced Shane's continued debauchery, but interviewing ex-Pogues, and none of the current line-up makes the film feel somewhat incomplete.Nick Cave's commentary throughout the film was probably the most brilliant of all offerings, especially as we see Shane skipping lines and even nearly whole songs altogether (in bits & pieces) in the latter quarter of the film.Interspliced throughout the film are bits of ""Shane about town"".  Some scenes are very moving, in that he hasn't forgotten the down-and-out, or his family.  Still, the film, especially the end, plays like a reason not to abuse substances.All-in-all, I highly recommend this film.  The good, the bad, and certainly the ugly are all rolled into one.

746844,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B00008R9LB,S. Harris,"[23, 29]","This may be the best rock documentary ever made. If it isn't, it's certainly in the top 3.  ""If I Should Fall from Grace,"" is an excellent introduction to McGowan and the Pogues. It also cements in the viewer's mind the group's importance.  I use the term ""group"" pretty generously.  This was MacGowan's group, and he was the engine, as much as the other members thought it some sort of democracy (and there does seem to be bitterness between McGowan and the group).""If I Should Fall from Grace"" is also a sad affair. McGowan is a waste case, and in a shocking way. The only time he really lights up, shows there's still a brain left in that stew, is when he talks, quite intellegently, about the importance of the Sex Pistols, and the whole music scene of that time. Another interesting aside, is how McGowan views ""Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash,"" which is a favorite album of mine. He's very so-so on it. Elvis Costello produced it, and McGowan essentially overprodued it. But you wonder if this is sour grapes, since Costello would take away the Pogue's bass player, Cait O'Riorden, and marry her. The rest of the present time in the documentary McGowan shuffles along, a lot like Ozzy Osbourne, mumbling, drinking, laughing like Aqualung on a park bench, with bottle nearby.  McGowan's mate, Victoria Clark, seems less a lover now, and more a nursemaid. In contrast, interviews with Nick Cave, an admiring friend and contemporary of McGowan's, who was also a bad boy rocker, shows who made the right choice regarding drugs and booze. McGowan choice will probably send him to an early grave. It's impossible to imagine he has any music left in him.  The video probably should had an R rating due to the awful state of McGowan's teeth, which seem to be rotting out of his head.
