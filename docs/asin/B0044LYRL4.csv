I truly thought that the stuff shirt ""man"" of the house"" was very funny and acted the part of Topper very well so when I saw they were available I purchased it. I stil love it. The acting is understated and his reactions to the ""spirits"" are really quite funny. The supporting cast is excellent, as is the script. This is better then the Cary Grant movie (which is enjoyable, just different). If you saw that you will enjoy this. This is not for everyone however as times have changed and I am not sure that all will see and understand the humour in it however it is well worth a try. The video is old however I found the series to be fine to watch.",5,A great old TV series from my youth.
