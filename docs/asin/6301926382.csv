272510,AA7W0CFRXF46L,6301926382,elfdart,"[2, 2]","Lantern Hill is based on the novel Jane of Lantern Hill by L.M. Montgomery, the same author who wrote Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon. The movie was produced by Sullivan Entertainment, like Anne was, and just like Anne, this movie is a great find. I'm actually surprised I hadn't heard of it before acquiring it by chance and watching it. It really is very good.The story follows a girl named Jane who lives in Toronto with her mother in the early 1900's. Her mother comes down with a serious illness however and Jane is forced to leave her middle class home to move in with her very wealthy grandmother while her mother recovers. Jane doesn't fit in very well here and, much to her grandmother's horror, would much rather spend her time in the kitchen or doing housework than socializing with other girls from elite families. She is also frequently bullied by her cousin who one day tells her that her father, whom she was told passed away, is alive. Her grandmother receives a letter soon after that from her father, requesting that Jane comes to live with him for a time in Prince Edward Island. Fearful of legal issues that could arise, her grandmother has no choice but to send her away. Jane of course goes along and, like many heroines in LMM books we get the sense that she isn't really wanted or needed (unlike many heroines though she does have both parents alive). Jane arrives and is picked up by her father's sister, who Jane seems not to gel with immediately. Jane meets her father, who is a writer, and he's a scatter brained person with a big dog and a house by the sea on Lantern Hill. At first she feels just as ostracized and out or place as she did back in Toronto, but as her relationship with her father gets a little better and she slowly settles into island life she feels happy. She also finds out that there is a potential woman in her father's life now, but he has never remarried since her mother. Jane of course wants her parents to reunite.This movie is fantastic. It has the same level of production as Anne of Green Gables, but the story and character types are different so it has a different feel to it. Jane is a really great heroine. She's a good heroine because even though she loves doing domestic things (unpopular even today as something a woman should aspire to or even enjoy in some circles) she doesn't give in to the situations she's thrust into. She isn't very vocal about what she wants, but she stubbornly stays true to herself.Also, a young Sarah Polley has a role in the film as a young scullery maid who befriends Jane. As fans may know, Sarah Polley stars in another successful Sullivan production called Road to Avonlea, which is a series featuring the town Anne was a part of, though she's not in the show at all.",5,great,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2777,"['Lantern', 'Hill', 'based', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Lantern', 'Hill', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'same', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Emily', 'New', 'Moon', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'Anne', 'was', 'just', 'Anne', 'movie', 'great', 'find', ""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'acquiring', 'chance', 'watching', 'really', 'very', 'good.The', 'story', 'girl', 'named', 'Jane', 'who', 'Toronto', 'mother', 'early', '1900', 'mother', 'down', 'serious', 'illness', 'however', 'Jane', 'forced', 'leave', 'middle', 'class', 'home', 'move', 'very', 'wealthy', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'recovers', 'Jane', ""n't"", 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'much', 'grandmother', 'horror', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'spend', 'time', 'kitchen', 'doing', 'housework', 'socializing', 'other', 'girls', 'elite', 'families', 'also', 'frequently', 'bullied', 'cousin', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'father', 'whom', 'was', 'told', 'passed', 'away', 'alive', 'grandmother', 'letter', 'soon', 'father', 'requesting', 'Jane', 'live', 'time', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Fearful', 'legal', 'issues', 'could', 'arise', 'grandmother', 'choice', 'send', 'away', 'Jane', 'course', 'along', 'many', 'heroines', 'LMM', 'books', 'get', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'wanted', 'needed', 'many', 'heroines', 'have', 'parents', 'alive', 'Jane', 'arrives', 'picked', 'up', 'father', 'sister', 'who', 'Jane', 'not', 'gel', 'immediately', 'Jane', 'father', 'who', 'writer', 'scatter', 'brained', 'person', 'big', 'dog', 'house', 'sea', 'Lantern', 'Hill', 'first', 'just', 'ostracized', 'place', 'did', 'back', 'Toronto', 'relationship', 'father', 'little', 'better', 'slowly', 'island', 'life', 'happy', 'also', 'out', 'potential', 'woman', 'father', 'life', 'now', 'never', 'remarried', 'mother', 'Jane', 'course', 'parents', 'reunite.This', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'same', 'level', 'production', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'story', 'character', 'types', 'are', 'different', 'different', 'feel', 'Jane', 'really', 'great', 'heroine', 'good', 'heroine', 'even', 'doing', 'domestic', 'things', 'unpopular', 'even', 'today', 'something', 'woman', 'should', 'aspire', 'even', 'enjoy', 'circles', ""n't"", 'give', 'situations', 'thrust', ""n't"", 'very', 'vocal', 'what', 'stubbornly', 'true', 'herself.Also', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'role', 'film', 'young', 'scullery', 'maid', 'who', 'Jane', 'fans', 'may', 'know', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'stars', 'successful', 'Sullivan', 'production', 'called', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'series', 'featuring', 'town', 'Anne', 'was', 'part', 'not', 'show']",Lantern Hill VHS

This film was produced by the same people as Anne, written by the same author and shown here originally on PBS' Wonderworks and then The Disney Channel.  Mairon Bennett plays Jane Stuart who has been living a sheltered life with her Grandmother and mother when her father ""allegedly"" died.  When she learns he is still alive, she does everything she can with the help of a mystic (Colleen Dewhurst of Anne of Green Gables 1 and 2 fame) to reunite her family.  Sam Waterston (The Great Gatsby [1974] and Law and Order (1994 to the present) is great as her long last father, and future star of the Road to Avonlea (just Avonlea here) Sarah Polley stars as a young tramplike jill of all trades named Jody who helps Jane in her quest.  This is enjoyable piece of work that you may have to order from the manufacturer themselves (Sullivan Boutique: the online home of all Kevin Sullivan films) but I was lucky to get it in the mail from an Amazon ""client"" today.

272513,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301926382,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 10]","I was always rather surprised that when Kevin Sullivan decided to turn to another Lucy Maud Montgomery novel after doing the first four Anne of Green Gables novels in a couple of celebrated mini-series he turned to ""Jane of Lantern Hill."" I would have thought the ""Emily of New Moon"" trilogy would come up next (it is currently a Canadian television series) and would not have minded seeing ""Magic for Marigold"" adapted, but Sullivan selected ""Jane of Lantern Hill"" instead.Montgomery's novel is distinct from all of the others because both of the heroine's parents are still living. However, Jane Stuart is an emotional orphan because her overbearing maternal grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) has psychologically battered Jane's mother, Robin (Patricia Phillips) into submission and the family has led Jane to believe her father is dead. However, Andrew Stuart (Sam Waterston) is not only alive, he is insisting on his parental rights and wants Jane sent to him on Prince Edward Island. Despite the chasm between them, father and daughter quickly bond, and Jane begins to question why her parents having been living apart. Meanwhile, Jane becomes involved with the spunky young vagrant, Jody Turner (Sarah Polley), and old Hepzibah (Colleen Dewhurst), the local ""witch"" lady.The adaptation of Montgomery's novel by Fiona McHugh holds true to the emotional center of the story while collapsing the narrative's period of time and jettisoning most of the domesticity as well. Unfortunately this means that one of my favorite scenes from the novel, where Jane finally gets in the face of Grandmother Kennedy, is lost. The performances in the production are so wonderfully understated except for Polley, who pours it on thick with the accent, although Dewhurst does get to ham it up a little bit at Hepzibah. Bennett gives a quiet performance that speaks to the fragility of Jane's relationship with her family while Waterston exhibits a simple, natural charm from start to finish with his estranged daughter that cannot help but win her over. In the end, it is Jane's simple determination to set her world in order that brings all the plot threads together in a satisfactory conclusion. Fans of Montgomery and/or Sullivan will not be disappointed by this quiet little film.Note: Young Mairon Bennett did the audiotape version of ""Jane of Lantern Hill"" and did an exceptional job. Given how restrained her performance necessarily was in the film to suit Jane's character, Bennett shows marvelous interpretative range for someone who, at the time, was so young. If you enjoyed the television movie and stumble across the audiotape, then make a point of picking it up so you can give it a listen.",5,Kevin Sullivan brings another L. M.

The combination of misunderstandings through unspoken feelings between a husband and wife, plus the interference of relatives of each of them, and the longing of a young daughter to bring her parents together, all make for a need-a-hankie-near-by story.  A sweet and satisfying ending wraps up the story just fine. I love stories that stir the emotions, especially romantic ones.  Don't want to give away any plot lines; this movie is one we'll watch several times.  The main reason we bought this video was because it starred Sam Waterston.

They are believable, well done characters.I loved Jane, her character was done very well.  The mother of Jane, well, how can I say??..was horrible.  She talked in a weak whisper, was spineless and watched as her daughter was humiliated and mistreated saying ""dahling it will be different someday"", with this insipid, confused look.  She just was not believable at all.  She also seemed way to old for the part. . Her character never varied, and one had to wonder why Sam Waterson was ever in love with her. She had no personality, none.  I think they left a lot of the story out at this point.  Sarah Polley took on too much with her Cockney accent, and at times struggled between 3 accents, but she was a joy to watch anyway. I liked the movie, and watched it all the way through, but as I said except for a few of the roles..the acting was like an over dramatic soap opera..  The sisters who live with Hepzebah were reduced to cartoon characters.The story was good, and I loved Colleen Dewhurst!
