402445,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6304113420,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 4]","Quick to capitalize on the skyrocketing success of Shirley MacLaine's '83 bestselling book `Out on a Limb' Shirley and ABC Network released this 160 minute miniseries of the same name in '87. `Out on a Limb' was highly anticipated television event aired on two consecutive nights, January 18-19 (that was a Monday and Tuesday if I remember correctly).I was one amongst a multitude of fans who couldn't wait for this show to air and made sure I had sent the allotted time set aside to view without interruption. Hard to believe as it may seem, that was before the advent of home recording devices so you were at the mercy of Network scheduling. You either watched at the appointed time or missed out (yes, it was a primitive time to be alive).The miniseries lived up to my every expectation. After all it's rather difficult to be disappointed with an autobiographical story about a contemporary person with that person in the starring role. Also considering the fact that I had enjoyed the book and was fascinated with the subject matter, there wasn't going to be much objectivity in judging its merits of this cinematic production.My Rating: Worth a watch? Absolutely!

402448,A234H4HFNHIOHM,6304113420,"Henry Erlenwein ""Staten Island""","[10, 15]","There are 2 versions of this film. This review is based on the 160 minute TV version as opposed to the 234 minute video that was released afterwaeds.First and foremost is the prologue disclaimer that some characters are composites of the actual events. Bella Abzug and Mort Viner were real people and obviously not in this category. Since the British politician provides the catalyst and title for her journey one can assume he is not a composite unless you choose to believe Ms. Maclaine has had numerous affairs with the English politic. The two Mystics are again real people and played themselves. That leaves David. If his character, superbly played by John Heard, is representative of many it somewhat distorts the viability of the journey. One man and his faith is quite different than that of many and gives the impression Ms. Maclaine jumped around till she found suitable finality to her quest.The plot beckons us with Synchroncity, Reincarnation and then delves into various forms of New Age philosophy and incidents involving Andes mineral baths, ET driven vehicles, and a superfluous amount of meditation. The finality of this baptizes Shirley as the chosen one to spread the word and tell the world of her new life discovery. But there is no real satisfactyion for the viewer unless you are a vibrant Shirley Maclaine fan. It leaves you a bit unsettled with another walk on the Malibu beach.One looks for a common denominator in the paranormal and here we have The Silver Thread which is demonstrated quite profoundly. Many OBE and Remote Viewing subjects include this phenomena with similar definition.Perhaps there is more truth and finality in the four hour version.

The first tape was interesting.  The usual love affair that cannot be climaxed because the guy is married. OK.  No big deal.  Happens in lots of movies.  This guy, however is in politics and is running for a high office, so the relationship is fuzzy from the start.  Shirley MacLaine keeps wondering why they are involved? To solve this problems she begins looking into esoteric answers. Doesn't everyone wonder about a shaky relationship?  But this affair is impossible because they are both well known people and their love affair must be kept secret from the press.  Shirley has come to think it strange that she got herself into such a difficult love affair. Not unusual.  Love is often blind especially in a movie film.The 2nd tape was different.  In fact, it was ridiculous.  Now she's into ESP and trance channelers, who probably did it for her free because of the publicity it would bring them when the film came out. Beyond that, idiots would pay tons of money to hear him talk about their lives.  His usual fee, I read was about $250.00. No mention of his fee in the film.  She takes a trip to Peru in the mountains where her esoteric buddy whom she met in the first film took her and tells her about lots of flying saucers that people who live in the mountains have seen.  And not only that, but his girl friend is from another planet who visits him!  Shirley's car get's stuck somewhere far up in the mountains, and is rescued by her friend whose car can drive at any speed on dangerous curvy mountain roads when his hand is not on the steering wheel.  Too much.  I didn't even feel like watching the 2nd tape this time.  I'd seen it years before, and even then doubted that any of it was true. Now I felt even more dubious, so I just took out the tape and put it away.",2,Fairy Tales can be told .....,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1916,"['bought', 'Out', 'Limb', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'morning', 'first', 'tape', 'was', 'interesting', 'usual', 'love', 'affair', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'climaxed', 'guy', 'married', 'OK.', 'No', 'big', 'deal', 'lots', 'movies', 'guy', 'however', 'politics', 'running', 'high', 'office', 'relationship', 'fuzzy', 'start', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'wondering', 'why', 'are', 'involved', 'solve', 'problems', 'looking', 'esoteric', 'answers', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'wonder', 'shaky', 'relationship', 'affair', 'impossible', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'people', 'love', 'affair', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'press', 'Shirley', 'come', 'think', 'strange', 'got', 'difficult', 'love', 'affair', 'Not', 'unusual', 'Love', 'often', 'blind', 'especially', 'movie', 'film.The', '2nd', 'tape', 'was', 'different', 'fact', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Now', 'ESP', 'trance', 'channelers', 'who', 'probably', 'did', 'free', 'publicity', 'would', 'bring', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Beyond', 'idiots', 'would', 'pay', 'tons', 'money', 'hear', 'talk', 'lives', 'usual', 'fee', 'read', 'was', '250.00', 'mention', 'fee', 'film', 'trip', 'Peru', 'mountains', 'where', 'esoteric', 'buddy', 'whom', 'met', 'first', 'film', 'took', 'lots', 'flying', 'saucers', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'mountains', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'girl', 'friend', 'planet', 'who', 'Shirley', 'car', 'get', 'stuck', 'somewhere', 'far', 'up', 'mountains', 'rescued', 'friend', 'car', 'can', 'drive', 'speed', 'dangerous', 'curvy', 'mountain', 'roads', 'when', 'hand', 'not', 'steering', 'wheel', 'Too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'watching', '2nd', 'tape', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'years', 'even', 'then', 'doubted', 'was', 'true', 'Now', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'dubious', 'just', 'took', 'out', 'tape', 'put', 'away']",Out on a Limb VHS

402454,ATQTLLURVJA60,6304113420,W. Christie,"[83, 98]","I've had OUT ON A LIMB on video tape since the original showing in 1987. Tonight for some reason I pulled it out to watch after an absence of at least 10 years (I have hundreds of video tapes so it was easy for this to recede into the darker corner of the closet).I am most amazed at Shirley's incredible courage (others might call it arrogance or gall) to present material that is so antagonistic to the mainstream middle American mind set. After watching this excellent time capsule of New Age Thought from the mid 1980's, I felt a wee bit sad, since I realize this mini-series could never be shown  on network TV today! After decades of Republican rule and the subtle but merciless pressure of right wing Christian religion in the US, the beliefs that Shirley presented in this film are much MORE controversial today than they were back in the benignn 1980's.  How dare she have an affair with a married man? How dare she claim to be God? How dare she hobnob with channelers who are in the hands of Satan? I can hear all the babble on TV and right wing talk radio if that poor woman were to try this today!Even if every concept presented in this film is false, it is a tremendously rewarding adventure.However, I do have to state that after this film was made, Shirley admitted on a talk show that the book/film are NOT literally true! She created composite characters like David to represent her spiritual research. So it might come down to her NOT having any personal metaphysical adventures at all outside the confines of her book reading, but she created such adventures, e.g., having an invisible alien drive a truck in Peru that she and the make-believe David were in, to jazz up the topic a bit.  I think a lot of people lost faith in Shirley when she made the confession that her books are NOT literally true!Nonetheless, Kevin Ryerson is a trance channeler and is still out there charging $275 for a 90 minute consultation. Why go to law school when you can charge prices like that for your services?I may seem like a skeptic. Well, I am skeptical of some of the more cartoonish aspects of the so-called New Age. We have grown more jaded since 1987. However, there are underlying spiritual truths within the film/book that make it worthwhile, although this film/book certainly contains no revelations that cannot also be found in a bounty of spiritual oriented books on the market today.So in one sense, you may enjoy this film/book as a nostalgic throwback to a time when the New Age was ""new"", not the butt of comedians and the horror of fundamentalists. To call someone ""new age"" now is considered practically an insult, like calling someone a ""liberal"". That shows how reactionary and scared our culture has become since those heady times.Take time from worrying about terrorism and the fact that George Bush believes that his fundamentalist Old Testament God is telling the US to invade other countries.
