When I purchased it, it turned out to be five episodes of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Why couldn't they just call it that. What sucks is that the live action part of the show is completely gone with just the cartoon shows left. The episode included are Star Koopa, Toad Warriors, Robo Koopa, On Her Majesty's Sewer Service, and Raiders of the Lost Mushroom. The show is pretty funny if extremely corny, but if you are a fan of the show I suggest searching for a boxed set instead of this.",2,Where's the live-action part?,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,569,"['found', 'bargain', 'bin', 'store', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'When', 'purchased', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'five', 'episodes', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'Super', 'Show', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'call', 'What', 'live', 'action', 'part', 'show', 'completely', 'gone', 'just', 'cartoon', 'left', 'episode', 'included', 'are', 'Star', 'Koopa', 'Toad', 'Warriors', 'Robo', 'Koopa', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Sewer', 'Service', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Mushroom', 'show', 'pretty', 'funny', 'extremely', 'corny', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'suggest', 'searching', 'boxed', 'set', 'instead']",Super Mario Bros. - Mario's Movie Madness
