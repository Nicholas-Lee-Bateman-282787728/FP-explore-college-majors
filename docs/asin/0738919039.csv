1794,A1HOWR14J49JRN,0738919039,"Bruno L. Garzon ""adriannepieczonkafan""","[11, 11]","This DVD of Mozart's Don Giovanni is a really good one by my standards. The top-notch cast, brilliant scenery and costumes, and wonderful orchestra make this one of my favorite Don's ever. I personally don't like Herbert von Karajan, but I learned to tolerate him. Samuel Ramey as the vile Don was a great casting decision. He blends vivacity and vileness it one very impressive package. Anna Tomowa-Sintow is a brilliant Donna Anna. Her high notes are absolutely stunning and sings with a firm foundation. The Don Ottavio of Gosta Winbergh is stunning, but he lacked something. Nevertheless he was very pleasing. The Commendatore of Paata Burchuladze is good for all that he's in. Now for the best: Julia Varady as Donna Elvira. I think she was Karajan's substitute for Agnes Baltsa but Varady surpasses her in EVERY way. She is velvety-voiced and gives light to the aguishly played Elvira. The Leoporello of Ferrucio Furlanetto is very pleasing. Kathleen Battle as Zerlina was also a good casting call. Alexander Malta as Masetto is a little guff now and then but gives a solid performance.

This review isn't for the seasoned experts, it's for the person who wants to explore opera but needs recommendations.So, I like a traditional staging. I don't want some S&M; interpretation or any other modernizations. I once saw the Shakespearean play Henry V ""modernized"" and it was an insult to the writer---I don't want to see things too minimal. I hate these new spartan sets with no staging.This performance delivers. The singing is excellent. All around really good singing. Von Karajan delivers---he brings a snap to every performance that Levine lacks.If you're wading through reviews and trying to decide if you want to try opera, here you go. It's a great investment. You will watch it repeatedly and you will enjoy it. It's well done, fun, great music, great costumes and sets.I highly recommend to any beginners.

1797,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,0738919039,Dan Sherman,"[75, 77]","This is a fine film record of Mozart's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s. It is a nicely paced, well-staged production with some excellent singing.  Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well.  The staging is pretty much traditional.  I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.

1798,A13OFOB1394G31,0738919039,"E. A. Lovitt ""starmoth""","[101, 102]","Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of ""Don Giovanni.""  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.",5,Hoggamus Higgamus,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,4507,"['Oh', 'first', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'production', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'have', 'video', 'same', '1987', 'Salzburg', 'Festival', 'production', 'taped', 'TV', 'technical', 'quality', 'DVD', 'order', 'magnitude', 'better', 'can', 'see', 'mute', 'Commendatore', 'funeral', 'who', 'never', 'noticed', 'most', 'scenery', 'was', 'built', 'black', 'marble', 'just', 'blended', 'right', 'wall', 'video', 'version', 'can', 'also', 'now', 'see', 'singers', 'sneaking', 'peeks', 'prompter', 'especially', 'Ferruccio', 'Furlanetto', 'Leporello', 'master', '2,065', 'conquests', ""'Madamina"", 'role', 'Donna', 'Anna', 'sung', 'Bulgarian', 'soprano', 'Anna', 'Tomowa-Sintow', 'association', 'Salzburg', 'Festival', 'Maestro', 'Karajan', 'been', 'long', 'fruitful', 'years', '1973', '1991', 'was', 'permanent', 'guest', 'Salzburg', 'Festivals', 'was', 'one', 'Karajan', 'favorite', 'singers', ""'ll"", 'know', 'why', 'when', 'listen', 'DVD', 'Tomowa', 'soprano', 'big', 'never', 'out-of-control', 'fine', 'crystal', 'spite', 'size', 'heavy', 'demands', 'Mozart', 'music', 'role', 'rape', 'near-rape', 'victim', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'attacker', 'glassy', 'thousand-yard', 'stare', 'trauma', 'survivor', 'very', 'glassy', 'watching', 'DVD', 'wondered', 'was', 'wearing', 'contact', 'lenses', 'first', 'time', '.The', 'basso', 'buffo', 'role', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'servant', 'Leporello', 'Italian', 'bass', 'Ferruccio', 'Furlanetto', 'as', 'closely', 'pair', 'master', 'discarded', 'unmentionables', 'turn', 'angrily', 'aware', 'inferior', 'position', 'sort', 'embryonic', 'Figaro', 'slavishly', 'obedient', 'suspiciously', 'so', 'lecherous', 'primly', 'lecturing', 'master', 'whom', 'harbor', 'real', 'fondness', 'understand', 'Furlanetto', 'Ramey', 'alternated', 'roles', 'master', 'servant', 'have', 'trouble', 'imagining', 'former', 'Giovanni', 'such', 'perfect', 'Leporello.According', 'Peter', 'Conrad', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'archetype', 'not', 'entirely', 'human', 'singer', 'must', 'display', 'own', 'personality', 'inhabiting', 'role', 'so', 'Sam', 'Ramey', 'pantherish', 'mercurial', 'ultimately', 'friendly', 'lover', 'When', 'festivities', 'ballroom', 'are', 'full', 'swing', 'Zerlina', 'ravish', 'were', 'only', 'teasing', 'What', 'really', 'do', 'dunk', 'fountain', 'throw', 'slipper', 'wall.Ruggero', 'Raimondi', 'was', 'joyless', 'scowling', 'satyr', 'Joseph', 'Losey', 'movie', 'opera', 'Most', 'dons', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stage', 'Michigan', 'Opera', 'Theatre', 'were', 'ribald', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'types', 'who', 'mounted', 'servant', 'girl', 'two', 'just', 'Stone', 'Guest', 'rumbled', 'Dang', 'Don', 'supposed', 'be', 'eating', 'dinner', 'scene', 'not', 'rutting', 'boar', 'know', 'too', 'However', 'Ramey', 'Giovanni', 'elegant', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'somehow', 'very', 'American.The', 'thankless', 'role', 'Don', 'Ottavio', 'sung', 'Swedish', 'tenor', 'G', 'ouml', 'Winbergh', 'who', 'studied', 'structural', 'engineering', 'played', 'rock', 'band', 'pursuing', 'operatic', 'career', 'was', 'sorry', 'hear', 'unexpected', 'death', 'last', 'year', 'perfect', 'foil', 'slightly', 'hysterical', 'Donna', 'Anna', 'performance', 'noble', 'kind', 'stodgy', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'stage', 'were', 'sleepwalker.Julia', 'Varady', 'thoroughly', 'intelligent', 'elegant', 'Donna', 'Elvira', 'who', 'desperately', 'love', 'Don', 'even', 'when', 'killing', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'character', 'described', 'hysteric', 'have', 'seen', 'played', 'slut', 'Varady', 'performance', 'light', 'years', 'characterizations', 'real', 'anguished', 'woman.Swiss', 'bass-baritone', 'Alexander', 'Malta', 'dignified', 'Masetto', 'hate', 'see', 'played', 'clownish', 'simpleton', 'who', 'older', 'new', 'bride', 'cynical', 'motives', 'hanging', 'around', 'Don', 'Malta', 'big', 'teddy', 'bear', 'guy', 'wonder', 'how', 'Zerlina', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'false', 'glamour', 'aristocratic', 'would-be', 'seducer.Kathleen', 'Battle', 'lyric', 'soprano', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'stage', 'presence', 'made', 'wonder', 'character', 'Zerlina', 'were', 'marrying', 'beneath', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'self-conscious', 'over-dressed', 'be', 'playing', 'role', 'peasant', 'Don', 'dead-on', 'initial', 'scene', 'together.Karajan', 'tempi', 'were', 'somewhat', 'funereal', 'especially', 'overture', 'overall', 'world-class', 'performance', 'old', 'maestro', 'fully', 'worthy', 'being', 'conducted', 'city', 'Mozart.P.S', 'Raimondi', 'Don', 'out', 'DVD', 'too', ""'d"", 'buy', 'one', 'first']",N/A

I  recommend it whole-heartedly for the great moments of lush, wonderful sound it delivers. Varady, Tomowa-Sintow, Ramey, Battle are well-cast and all perform admirably.  I certainly found myself breathless at several places hearing this Divinely inspired score so wonderfully sung.  But you should be warned, this production takes itself mighty seriously.  There are places where you may even find yourself a little bored.  Despite a fabulous comic turn by Ferlinetto as Leporello, this production is a bit leaden. The Met version with Ramey and Battle had a better balance of comedy and drama in my opinion and was better-acted. When Giovanni was carried off to Hell at the end, it came as a genuine surprise and the subtlety  of the drama's structure seemed much more ingenious that way.

Nothing has espaced through Karajan's attention, every single detail is so correct.

1801,A2NHAEBGH1TWSJ,0738919039,"""jgarcia112""","[13, 14]","This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.

Specially Samuel Ramey and Ferrucio Furlanetto. Kathleen Battle is also a lovely Zerlina.However, in spite of the singers, I would only recommend this opera if you like to think of opera as a series of &quot;separate&quot; arias or pieces (which seems to me is what the other reviewers like). Because this is exactly what Karajan does here. The opera is never remotely fluid, seeming to drag on forever, and full of Karajan's mannerisms. In fact, if you turn it off at the middle of an act and return to it later, you'll find there's no problem, nothing is lost, because there was never anything to begin with!Believe me, there are better versions available, even if the singers are not as good as here. But then again, if you're one of the people who likes Karajan's egocentrical recordings during the 80's, or if you think of opera as separate pieces which don't necessarily have to be connected to the rest, then you might like this one.

The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming, even though the light background showing the city was very well done.

Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable.

Karajan has done a magnificent job with the orchestrated music and the performers are top notch (acting as well as singing). I found the setting perfectly suited to the style and mood of this great work: dark, seductive and secretive. The camera angles are well placed and the audio is superb.Samuel Ramey is a perfect Don G. Unrelenting in his persuit of the fairer sex and unrepentant as well: great voice and obviously enjoys his role as the world's number one philanderer.Julia Varady is the frequently scorned and forever forgiving damsel. Her non singing part in Leporello's ""Madamina"" is delightful to watch.Kathleen Battle plays a coquettish Zerlina and her arias and the duet with Ramey are magnificent to behold.My favorite performance however, is by Ferruccio Fulanetto as the roguish Leporello; playing the role of a scoundrel who knows he should know better but is having too much fun to stop.One final point: I liked the menu on this DVD. Giving you the option to play the entire concert or go to a particular scene. Also the choice of language for the subtitles was nice as well: although I speak English only, I find that once you get used a particular opera, it really is nice to follow along the voices in the recorded language, in this case Italian. I must admit that my favorite opera language is Italian.The true measure of pleasure an opera gives me is how often I listen to my favorite sections and it comes as no surprise that I play several sections very often.  It seems every time I observe something  new.If you were considering getting Don Giovanni I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD.

Tomowa-Sintow is a handsome woman with an opulent voice...too opulent for Mozart I feel but she does a good job.  Varady is committed and sings well.  Don Ottavio sings beautifully and looks like the stiff that he is supposed to be.  Battle's Zerlina has been criticized but I see no reason for that.  The voice is extremely well produced and she is musical.  Her acting is certainly as good as the rest of the cast.  Massetto cannot be faulted in this somewhat thankless role.  The trouble is that Von Karajan was not in his element in directing the production.  It does not satisfy.  Perhaps we see too much of the aging maestro during the overture and his body language trumpets his legendary egotism to an offensive degree.  It doesn't put one in a mood of eager expectation.
