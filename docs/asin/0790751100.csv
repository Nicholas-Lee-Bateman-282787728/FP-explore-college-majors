Either he is too out of place for a film noir or he needs a better director. Some of the aspects causing City Heat to fail are: too much gunplay, bad acting, non-existent story, feigned film noir try, and yes...Burt Reynolds. He is simply horrendous. What I don't like about City Heat are the two forces: one showing an actor to make a joke of himself and the other one showing an actor trying to be serious in an Unforgiven way. There is ridiculously so much gunplay in the film that wasted a lot of time, and it makes the film to look cheap. I can't believe how lame Burt Reynolds was acting. I ask him this question: ""Are you serious?"" Throughout City Heat, I pretty much have no clue what the movie is all about. I suppose it is some black guy who stole records, tried to sell them, and died along the way. Then, the two guys show up and try to retrieve them. That is as far as I understand of the plot. I mean, that's not film noir at all. No...the director has to pretend by throwing a specific look of it. Suppose I take that away and make the picture be present-day of 1984, then surely there is no film noir aspect of the picture because nothing else is working out. Gosh darn it, I still can't get over the fact how Burt Reynolds embarrassed himself in City Heat.",1,"Wow, Burt and Clint in the Same Picture.

""Pink Cadillac"" proved to me that if he tries to be anything besides a silent brute, he's out of his element.  Watching his attempt at being funny in a zany action-comedy is nothing short of embarrassing; not to say he's never been an amusing character for his other films, but his humor mostly stems from cynicism, and him trying to sash-talk his way against a spunky love-interest in this film didn't work for him.  From dressing a rodeo clown and a casino king (who looks like a bleached John Waters) to mocking a woman's voice, his delivery towards these 'funny moments' are poorly handled.The film is about a master-of-disguise bounty hunter named Tommy Nowak, though he called himself a 'skip tracer' but if he's off chasing criminals so he can sent them to court for cash, that sounds like work of a bounty hunter to me.  He reluctantly goes after an escape fugitive named Lou Ann (Bernadette Peters), who was inexplicably involved in collecting counterfeit money which were actually responsible by her jerk of a husband and the Birthright, a type of Aryan brotherhood.  The money's in her [movie title], which the Birthright was after, but Nowak found her first. He decided to protect her and keep her hidden from the law, presumably because she was cute in ""The Jerk""; otherwise, he had no real reason to have a change of heart from being a typical stern bounty hunter besides romantic convenience.  He gets involved in the Aryan's battles, leading into weak car chases and a haphazard conclusion.Although this probably Eastwood's weakest film in his repertoire, the film is not bad.  It's simply corny, particularly with the acting.  Again, Eastwood's comedic performance didn't go in his favor and Peters tried to be compelling with her sugary lisp voice, and the result of that is quite sour. The biggest offense were the bad guys, who were reaching the expertise of B-level cinema.  Malposo-produced films usually have cold and relentless antagonists, but the enemies in this movie are cartoonishly evil that they put me at a distance.  The leader of the Birthright, Alex, is so over-the-top, it's like I'm watching an bad 80s action film.  Maybe that's the idea of this film, but it didn't succeed in delivering the camp factors.  The whole film felt like a middling effort, but at least it had the grace of showing a young Jim Carrey doing stand-up, which showed how little he changed over the years.",3,One Too Many Wacky Disguises,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2576,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'man', 'when', 'act', 'intimidation', 'would', 'be', 'traditional', 'cowboy', 'cop', 'retired', 'boxer', 'racist', 'war', 'veteran', 'Pink', 'Cadillac', 'proved', 'be', 'anything', 'silent', 'brute', 'element', 'Watching', 'attempt', 'being', 'funny', 'zany', 'action-comedy', 'nothing', 'short', 'embarrassing', 'not', 'say', 'never', 'been', 'amusing', 'character', 'other', 'films', 'humor', 'mostly', 'cynicism', 'trying', 'sash-talk', 'way', 'spunky', 'love-interest', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'dressing', 'rodeo', 'clown', 'casino', 'king', 'who', 'bleached', 'John', 'Waters', 'mocking', 'woman', 'voice', 'delivery', ""'funny"", 'moments', 'are', 'poorly', 'handled.The', 'film', 'master-of-disguise', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Nowak', 'called', ""'skip"", 'tracer', 'off', 'chasing', 'criminals', 'so', 'can', 'sent', 'court', 'cash', 'like', 'work', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'reluctantly', 'escape', 'fugitive', 'named', 'Lou', 'Ann', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'who', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'involved', 'collecting', 'counterfeit', 'money', 'were', 'actually', 'responsible', 'jerk', 'husband', 'Birthright', 'type', 'Aryan', 'brotherhood', 'money', '[', 'movie', 'title', ']', 'Birthright', 'was', 'Nowak', 'found', 'first', 'decided', 'protect', 'keep', 'hidden', 'law', 'presumably', 'was', 'cute', 'Jerk', 'otherwise', 'had', 'real', 'reason', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'being', 'typical', 'stern', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'romantic', 'convenience', 'involved', 'Aryan', 'battles', 'leading', 'weak', 'car', 'chases', 'haphazard', 'conclusion.Although', 'probably', 'Eastwood', 'weakest', 'film', 'repertoire', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'simply', 'corny', 'particularly', 'acting', 'Again', 'Eastwood', 'comedic', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'favor', 'Peters', 'tried', 'be', 'compelling', 'sugary', 'lisp', 'voice', 'result', 'quite', 'sour', 'biggest', 'offense', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'reaching', 'expertise', 'B-level', 'cinema', 'Malposo-produced', 'films', 'usually', 'have', 'cold', 'relentless', 'antagonists', 'enemies', 'movie', 'are', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'put', 'distance', 'leader', 'Birthright', 'Alex', 'so', 'over-the-top', ""'m"", 'watching', 'bad', '80s', 'action', 'film', 'idea', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'delivering', 'camp', 'factors', 'whole', 'film', 'felt', 'middling', 'effort', 'least', 'had', 'grace', 'showing', 'young', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'showed', 'how', 'little', 'changed', 'years']",N/A

He has made many great films, and will continue to do so.This is not one of them.This is Clint's worst film, one of his few real duds.  It's a long movie at 121 minutes, but even if Clint had edited it down a bit, it still wouldn't be very good.  I couldn't help but think that Clint didn't really care about this film too much, as he looks bored throughout, and while Bernadette Peters (I think this was the last starring role she had before she went full time on Broadway) tries to spice things up (and has good on screen chemistry with Clint), it's still a very poor film.  There are major plot holes, the biggest of Clint's career.  The tone of the film is rather jarring, switching from light comedy to crude one liners to harrowing gun fights with white supremacists.  Basically, it's just a mess.There are a few (just a few) good things.  It's shot on location in the Sierras, there is a good chase scene at the end, Jim Carrey appears as an Elvis impersonator, and there is some funny situations at the beginning of the film (Clint's first arrest here is very funny).  Clint didn't direct this film, but his production company produced it and Buddy Van Horn directed it.

A lot of humor is well represented in this film as well as some good action as Speer and Murphy reluctantly work together to solve the case involving two rival gangsters Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) and Leon Coll (Tony Lo Bianco) and their accomplices.Some of the songs contained in the movie were co-written by Irene Cara who stars as Swift's girlfriend and entertainer Ginny Lee who also sings a George and Ira Gershwin melody. Though not quite her best role, the late Madeline Kahn played the daughter of a wealthy businessman and girlfriend of Murphy who was Pitt's kidnap victim, holding her until he got the goods. Probably the best parts of the film were the gunfight scenes where Murphy gets tangled up between two of Pitt's soldiers and two of Coll's soldiers spraying bullets everywhere under the watchful eye of Speer as Murphy takes cover, and in Pitt's hideout inside a garage shows Murphy pulling out a long gun when Speer gets the better end by drawing out an even longer gun as they exchange gunfire with Pitt and his soldiers with a little mechanic running back and forth in panic seeking cover and dodging bullets.Not really the best movie, but it's worth a look.",3,Simply Not the Best but Fun,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,1468,"['time', 'Prohibition', 'rival', 'gangsters', 'speakeasies', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'stars', 'police', 'Lieutenant', 'Speer', 'who', 'tangled', 'up', 'former', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Murphy', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'quit', 'force', 'begin', 'own', 'private', 'detective', 'agency', 'together', 'partner', 'Dehl', 'Swift', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'lot', 'humor', 'well', 'represented', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'action', 'Speer', 'Murphy', 'reluctantly', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'case', 'involving', 'two', 'rival', 'gangsters', 'Primo', 'Pitt', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Leon', 'Coll', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'accomplices.Some', 'songs', 'contained', 'movie', 'were', 'co-written', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'who', 'Swift', 'girlfriend', 'entertainer', 'Ginny', 'Lee', 'who', 'also', 'George', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'melody', 'not', 'quite', 'best', 'role', 'late', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'played', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'girlfriend', 'Murphy', 'who', 'was', 'Pitt', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'holding', 'got', 'goods', 'Probably', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'gunfight', 'scenes', 'where', 'Murphy', 'tangled', 'up', 'two', 'Pitt', 'soldiers', 'two', 'Coll', 'soldiers', 'spraying', 'bullets', 'everywhere', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Speer', 'Murphy', 'cover', 'Pitt', 'hideout', 'garage', 'Murphy', 'pulling', 'out', 'long', 'gun', 'when', 'Speer', 'better', 'end', 'drawing', 'out', 'even', 'longer', 'gun', 'exchange', 'gunfire', 'Pitt', 'soldiers', 'little', 'mechanic', 'running', 'back', 'forth', 'panic', 'seeking', 'cover', 'dodging', 'bullets.Not', 'really', 'best', 'movie', 'look']",N/A

The plot isn't terribly exciting and the acting didn't raise any eyebrows but there was just enough humor and a few goofy situations to keep it from total destruction.It's the 1930's and the time of prohibition, gangland activity, and all the nefarious activity that goes with it.  Eastwood plays the seasoned, grizzled lieutenant in the police department trying to keep a hold on his city while Reynolds is his former partner now turned private eye who just can't seem to stay out of trouble.  These two trade wisecracks and insults throughout the film and put themselves into some corny predicaments that merit a few laughs here and there.  It seems that they're both trying to outdo each other also so that distracts a little but not too much.  They finally team up together to save the day and roust the gangsters in a predictable and unexciting ending.There's not a whole lot of saving graces other that what has already been mentioned but at least you can see some different, although hollow, acting performances by Madeline Kahn, Rip Torn, Richard Roundtree, Jane Alexander, and Irene Cara.

He plays a modern-day bounty hunter by the name of Tommy Nowak that uses skill rather then a gun to catch his suspects, although he does carry a gun briefly here. Bernadette Peters plays this little curly-haired blonde who lives in a trailer with her dead-beat husband and his speed-freak friends. Her husband owns a pink cadillac and she drives off in it with her baby and a bag of money. Nowak is then sent to bring her back from a casino before her husband's gang finds her first. When they do, and kidnap the baby, Nowak and Peters bond when they give chase to get it back.The movie is red-neck and full of trailer trash stereotypes in every way. It also helps define the classic example of the woman that takes the bad boy, but then learns her lesson when she finds Nowak. But the movie has poor acting. Clint's chessy impressions, including an imitation of a drunken red-neck, do little to raise any laughs. The gang of army wannabe's don't make the film any more dramatic. The whole concept of ""Don't mess with a man's automobile"" is literally worn out.Despite the semi-colorful cast of Peters, Frances Fisher, and even Jim Carey, and an expansive soundtrack, this romantic comedy falls short of anything close to a classic. It's a good thing that Eastwood didn't direct this himself; Buddy Van Horn took the rap instead. This is the only film of Eastwood's career that did not receive a theatrical release in the UK, and it remains his lowest-grossing to date. Sorry folks, but Pink Cadillac never starts.

The presence of the star's green t-shirt and blue jeans outfit from Every Which Way But Loose clearly signposts it as one of his periodic redneck comedies, but unlike the superior Honkytonk Man and Bronco Billy, there's no depth of feeling here. It's all on the surface and ambles along predictably, but doesn't really have an ending, with action scenes that are decidedly tame and lame and a main villain who's decidely unthreatening (for all their posturing, the bad guys don't really do much more than waste their time on target practice).A more restrained Peters than we're used to gives better than she gets from the script, but Clint is clearly having a whale of a time with a part that enables him to show a lot more range and extrovert good-humoured charm than much of the rest of his career put together. That said, some of his disguises are a bit hard to take - especially when he dons shades, spats, gold lame suit and Charlie Parker jive - although he does make a worryingly convincing inbred Southern gumby at one point. With the Malpaso stock company represented by Geoffrey Lewis (as a spaced-out hippy that really should have been played by Dennis Hopper), Bill McKinney and Mara Corday and with bit parts from Jim Carrey as a casino entertainer and James Cromwell as a none-too-bright desk clerk, this is clearly one for the money rather than one from the heart.
