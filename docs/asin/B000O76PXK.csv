I'd say it's worth renting because it is somewhat interesting in that it deals with a taboo subject and a famous American icon. Should they put up a better barrier or leave this beautiful monument unmarred by an unsightly structure? Save lives or preserve the aesthetic character of the Golden Gate Bridge? That was one interesting issue that is raised. I say leave the bridge alone. There are other barriers that these individuals break through before getting to the bridge. Society's failures as well as those of the individual are what lead people to take that leap and the bridge jumpers should force people that care to look at those. There is nothing wrong with the bridge.,3,the bridge,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,713,"['Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'d"", 'say', 'worth', 'renting', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'taboo', 'subject', 'famous', 'American', 'icon', 'Should', 'put', 'up', 'better', 'barrier', 'leave', 'beautiful', 'monument', 'unmarred', 'unsightly', 'structure', 'Save', 'preserve', 'aesthetic', 'character', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'was', 'one', 'interesting', 'issue', 'raised', 'say', 'leave', 'bridge', 'alone', 'are', 'other', 'barriers', 'individuals', 'break', 'getting', 'bridge', 'Society', 'failures', 'as', 'well', 'individual', 'are', 'what', 'lead', 'people', 'take', 'leap', 'bridge', 'jumpers', 'should', 'force', 'people', 'care', 'look', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'bridge']",The Bridge

I had believed that you would see the majestic, technical and mechanical elements of the San Francisco bridge.  It is not about that, it is all about the use of the bridge as a tool to end your life.  You will see and feel the desperation and anguish that leads someone to take advantage of the bridge - to end their life here, and to use this bridge as the means just because it is there!Come to grips with the endThis lengthy 2004 documentary is a study of the people who come to grips that this is the method to accomplish that.  Pay close attention to the stories of family and friends of the dead.  You may get confused about the people the interviewees speak of.  Heartbreaking stories of family and friends interweave with footage of people on the bridge.GraphicIn the yearlong study, photographers captured the people on the bridge.  You will see actual jumps!  Some footage is plentiful, while other jumps are not as graphic.  And, that is one of the most painful things to watch, the leap from that bridge, the leap that is the end.  You will hear how a young man changed his mind and lived to tell about it.Not exploitiveSome might feel that this graphic view of suicide jumps is exploitive, but the film allows the viewer to FEEL for the person jumping.  The healthy minded person can't imagine climbing that rail knowing the horrendous outcome.  But to the mentally ill or depressed person, it comes without much thought.  It is an educational insight for anyone who may recognize the signs of desperation.Special FeaturesThe extra feature here is the role photographers play in recording daily the people, watching out for the loner and their telltale signs.  You will see some people get pulled away, and at times you can only believe they wanted to be stopped.Fortunately, I have not had an experience with someone who attempted or mastered suicide.

1062502,A2KSWHGL7NT5TW,B000O76PXK,Andrew D. Dixon Jr.,"[48, 48]","I spotted this film by randomly surfing my channel guide on Sat TV and watched it on IFC May 8. The program description actually left me in a state of disbelief; there's no way they could do an entire documentary on suicidal plunges from this bridge, can they? They sure did. It's an amazing piece of journalism into what others have already described as taboo in normal journalism. The comments from the families and friends of the jumpers weave the story together incredibly. The documentary was inspired by a New Yorker magazine article called ""Jumpers"" about the same subject matter. The Golden Gate Bridge has more suicides at that one location than any other place on earth. Morbid at times as others described here, but relentlessly compelling as we watch the film progess and try to figure out why in the hell this bridge has a strange and fatal attraction for those who are so mentally disturbed, they'll hurl themselves over to a watery death. Incredibly, one attempt is thwarted by a tourist taking pictures that is captured on film. And one jumper who actually survived (his jump was not caught on film) tells what it's like to fall from such a staggering height into the bay. He describes how when he let go of the rail of the bridge, he immediately regretted his decision to jump and as he fell he readjusted his body hoping to have the least impact when he hit the water in the hopes of somehow surviving, which he did. But the fatal leaps interspliced with real life perspectives from those who knew the jumpers are in fact strangely fascinating. Fascinating mostly because the local and national media normally just don't care to report suicides with justified reasons. It's a glimpse into an area that is largely ignored, yet intriguing to look at because it is so rare to hear from the associates of those who choose to end their own lives. And some of the footage of the leaps, we really haven't seen such gripping, horrifying and again, morbidly compelling footage since the dark days of Sept. 11, 2001, when victims of the terrorist attacks in the Twin Towers jumped to their deaths for obviously different reasons.",4,"Wow, into the hearts of darkness",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2137,"['spotted', 'film', 'randomly', 'surfing', 'channel', 'guide', 'Sat', 'TV', 'watched', 'IFC', 'May', '8', 'program', 'description', 'actually', 'left', 'state', 'disbelief', 'way', 'could', 'do', 'entire', 'documentary', 'suicidal', 'plunges', 'bridge', 'can', 'sure', 'did', 'amazing', 'piece', 'journalism', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'described', 'taboo', 'normal', 'journalism', 'comments', 'families', 'friends', 'jumpers', 'weave', 'story', 'together', 'incredibly', 'documentary', 'was', 'inspired', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'article', 'called', 'Jumpers', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'more', 'suicides', 'one', 'location', 'other', 'place', 'earth', 'Morbid', 'times', 'others', 'described', 'here', 'relentlessly', 'compelling', 'watch', 'film', 'progess', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'hell', 'bridge', 'strange', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'mentally', 'disturbed', ""'ll"", 'hurl', 'watery', 'death', 'Incredibly', 'one', 'attempt', 'thwarted', 'tourist', 'taking', 'pictures', 'captured', 'film', 'one', 'jumper', 'who', 'actually', 'survived', 'jump', 'was', 'not', 'caught', 'film', 'what', 'fall', 'such', 'staggering', 'height', 'bay', 'how', 'when', 'let', 'go', 'rail', 'bridge', 'immediately', 'regretted', 'decision', 'jump', 'fell', 'readjusted', 'body', 'hoping', 'have', 'least', 'impact', 'when', 'hit', 'water', 'hopes', 'somehow', 'surviving', 'did', 'fatal', 'leaps', 'interspliced', 'real', 'life', 'perspectives', 'who', 'knew', 'jumpers', 'are', 'fact', 'strangely', 'fascinating', 'Fascinating', 'mostly', 'local', 'national', 'media', 'normally', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'report', 'suicides', 'justified', 'reasons', 'glimpse', 'area', 'largely', 'ignored', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'look', 'so', 'rare', 'hear', 'associates', 'who', 'choose', 'end', 'own', 'lives', 'footage', 'leaps', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'such', 'gripping', 'horrifying', 'again', 'morbidly', 'compelling', 'footage', 'dark', 'days', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'when', 'victims', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'jumped', 'deaths', 'obviously', 'different', 'reasons']",The Bridge

You can say it reflects the personality of the city.  It's a magical place, an enduring engineering marvel...and a suicide magnet.It's that last feature that drew Producer/Director Eric Steel to this project (though it's in question just how open he was with the Golden Gate Bridge Authority in regards to his proposed subject matter).It would have been easy for Steel to piece together a sensational or voyeuristic film given the nature of the footage he collected while filming at the bridge for a year.  Instead, he's put together an unsettling but ultimately deeply moving work that seeks to define bridge jumpers as real human beings, not just statistics.  Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film aren't the ones at the bridge; they're the emotional, affecting interviews with friends and family of the jumpers. It's clear they're still reeling from the events.Adding to the brooding, ruminative feel of the film is a brilliant score by Alex Heffes.

1062505,A7NSC373W0W01,B000O76PXK,"ARWoollock ""We are limited only by our imagin...","[8, 39]","Where documentary-makers significantly differ from film-makers can be expressed in two areas. Firstly in their responsibility and secondly in the fact that once a documentary has been shot it can never really be returned to and re-made; not in the way a regular film can. If a documentary, therefore, both squanders its opportunity and negates its responsibility, it represents a double tragedy. That is what this 'documentary' is and does.The actual subject matter for this film could have been quite sound indeed and had massive potential to open both doors and discussions on a very real and engaging subject. Because of the general aversion to documentaries on death, dying and especially suicide, what 'director' Eric Steele had potentially stumbled upon here, was of the last chances in documentary-making to tread on virgin territory, yet another travesty.Essentially what Steele offers up is ultimately no more than any film student on a B.A. course anywhere could have done. That is to imply that this effort suffers from weaknesses in five main areas. Areas which one might correlate to inexperience and youthful inadequacies when applied to an under-graduate, however, weaknesses that point to genuine shortcomings when applied to a supposed professional. Those weaknesses in no order of importance are:i) A sever lack of cohesion, no real central thesis. Something which seems to have had the brief written after the shoot.ii) Inferior image quality and selection of shots.iii) Incompatible, and dull soundtrack, inappropriate choice of music and improper linking of music and images.iv) Inclusion of much that is irrelevant. Again, linking with the first point. There sees to be a lot of 'winging' it here, going with the flow, found imagery and all that terminology which really means lack of planning and preparation, lack of foresight and imagination.v) Dishonesty and lack of professionalism.Anyone who knows anything about reading films or has encountered and engaged with deconstructing the documentary as a means of communicating the Truth, will immediately spot the aforementioned in this really quite mediocre effort. That said the last point may not be self-explanatory and so it is to that I would briefly like to turn and elaborate.Steel was given permission by the Bridge Authority to film, because he said he was making a film which aimed ""to capture the powerful, spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge. He did not, it did not. I would say that was dishonest.In a BBC interview (freely available on YouTube), Steel said that he did not inform the loved ones of the deceased, that he had footage of their final moments, because he did not want people then heading to the bridge and jumping in an attempt to immortalise themselves on celluloid. As the relatives and friends were interviewed after their nearest and dearest had perished this makes no logical sense. It is a totally incoherent and irrational argument, in fact it is not even an argument per se. I therefore concur that he mislead these individuals and tricked them into co-operating. And here he was doubly deceitful because he starts to play an afterthought excuse that he was interested in mental-health issues, when he clearly was not because he brought nothing to the table on such a debate.N.B. By stringing out the last jumper's pacing up and down and mixing that footage with interviews filmed with his friends, all of which was spread throughout most of the film and then by finally showing his very spectacular and showman-esque demise; the MOST spectacular..., one feels obliged to question if Steele, by his editing and his cinematic choices, did not achieve that posthumous immortalise ation for that last individual who was shown so graphically committing suicide.To summate. Exceptionally poor documentary making. A tragic waste of a one time opportunity to face and deal with many issues and then lead society through the tragedy to further discussion and debate and ultimate understanding and progress.",1,Dishonest Documentary-maker Delivers Disappointingly Dull Document.,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,4071,"['Where', 'documentary-makers', 'significantly', 'differ', 'film-makers', 'can', 'be', 'expressed', 'two', 'areas', 'Firstly', 'responsibility', 'secondly', 'fact', 'once', 'documentary', 'been', 'shot', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'returned', 're-made', 'not', 'way', 'regular', 'film', 'can', 'documentary', 'therefore', 'squanders', 'opportunity', 'responsibility', 'double', 'tragedy', 'what', ""'documentary"", 'does.The', 'actual', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'sound', 'indeed', 'had', 'massive', 'potential', 'open', 'doors', 'discussions', 'very', 'real', 'engaging', 'subject', 'general', 'aversion', 'documentaries', 'death', 'dying', 'especially', 'suicide', 'what', ""'director"", 'Eric', 'Steele', 'had', 'potentially', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'here', 'was', 'last', 'chances', 'documentary-making', 'tread', 'virgin', 'territory', 'yet', 'travesty.Essentially', 'what', 'Steele', 'up', 'ultimately', 'more', 'film', 'student', 'B.A', 'course', 'anywhere', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'imply', 'effort', 'suffers', 'weaknesses', 'five', 'main', 'areas', 'Areas', 'one', 'might', 'correlate', 'inexperience', 'youthful', 'inadequacies', 'when', 'applied', 'under-graduate', 'however', 'point', 'genuine', 'shortcomings', 'when', 'applied', 'supposed', 'professional', 'weaknesses', 'order', 'importance', 'are', 'i', 'sever', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'real', 'central', 'thesis', 'Something', 'have', 'had', 'brief', 'written', 'shoot.ii', 'Inferior', 'image', 'quality', 'selection', 'shots.iii', 'Incompatible', 'dull', 'soundtrack', 'inappropriate', 'choice', 'music', 'improper', 'linking', 'music', 'images.iv', 'Inclusion', 'much', 'irrelevant', 'Again', 'linking', 'first', 'point', 'be', 'lot', ""'winging"", 'here', 'going', 'flow', 'found', 'imagery', 'terminology', 'really', 'lack', 'planning', 'preparation', 'lack', 'foresight', 'imagination.v', 'Dishonesty', 'lack', 'professionalism.Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'reading', 'films', 'encountered', 'engaged', 'deconstructing', 'documentary', 'means', 'communicating', 'Truth', 'will', 'immediately', 'spot', 'aforementioned', 'really', 'quite', 'mediocre', 'effort', 'said', 'last', 'point', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'self-explanatory', 'would', 'briefly', 'turn', 'elaborate.Steel', 'was', 'given', 'permission', 'Bridge', 'Authority', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'aimed', 'capture', 'powerful', 'spectacular', 'intersection', 'monument', 'nature', 'place', 'day', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'dishonest.In', 'BBC', 'interview', 'freely', 'available', 'YouTube', 'Steel', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'inform', 'loved', 'ones', 'deceased', 'had', 'footage', 'final', 'moments', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'people', 'then', 'heading', 'bridge', 'jumping', 'attempt', 'immortalise', 'celluloid', 'relatives', 'friends', 'were', 'interviewed', 'nearest', 'dearest', 'had', 'perished', 'logical', 'sense', 'totally', 'incoherent', 'irrational', 'argument', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'argument', 'se', 'therefore', 'concur', 'mislead', 'individuals', 'tricked', 'co-operating', 'here', 'was', 'doubly', 'deceitful', 'play', 'afterthought', 'excuse', 'was', 'interested', 'mental-health', 'issues', 'when', 'clearly', 'was', 'not', 'brought', 'nothing', 'table', 'debate.N.B', 'stringing', 'out', 'last', 'jumper', 'pacing', 'up', 'down', 'mixing', 'footage', 'interviews', 'filmed', 'friends', 'was', 'spread', 'most', 'film', 'then', 'finally', 'showing', 'very', 'spectacular', 'showman-esque', 'demise', 'MOST', 'spectacular', 'one', 'feels', 'obliged', 'question', 'Steele', 'editing', 'cinematic', 'choices', 'did', 'not', 'achieve', 'posthumous', 'immortalise', 'ation', 'last', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'shown', 'so', 'graphically', 'committing', 'suicide.To', 'summate', 'Exceptionally', 'poor', 'documentary', 'making', 'tragic', 'waste', 'one', 'time', 'opportunity', 'face', 'deal', 'many', 'issues', 'then', 'lead', 'society', 'tragedy', 'further', 'discussion', 'debate', 'ultimate', 'understanding', 'progress']",The Bridge

So many visitors go to the Golden Gate bridge and let their video cameras just run and run that a fair amount of raw footage over the years has caught people taking the jump.  This documentary doesn't just cover the actual suicide though but goes further by delving into the survivors and the stories they have to tell about the jumpers and then themselves in the aftermath.  This documentary isn't for everyone as it is a pretty grim topic and there is no upside to the story.

I argued with him about watching such a depressing film and pretty much begged him to find something else on TV.  I had no interest in watching people leap to their deaths and then listen to their families as they morn their lost loved ones.As is usually the case in remote control wars in my home, I lost.  So I grabbed my book and settled in to ignore the tube.  Five minutes into it, my book was forgotten and I was riveted.  As silly as this may sound, it wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be.  It's shocking, disturbing, sad and tragic, but more than that it's fascinating.  I could not believe how many people have killed themselves on that bridge.  It's frightening.I was really against watching this film as I have had two people I have loved deeply commit suicide.  There isn't a pain on this earth that is comparable to the pain that friends and family experience after someone kills themselves.  I didn't want to watch others go through what I have already gone through, I thought it would be too hard.  Surprisingly the friends and families are at a place in the grieving process where they have accepted what happened and some even understand why it happened.  A lot of the people who jumped had a history of mental illness or some sort of long term problems.  One father seemed to find his peace by thinking his son was finally got what he wanted, that he was finally happy.The absolute desperation these people must have felt to take such a terrifying leap is palpable.  It's impossible to not feel empathy for all those involved.  Despite the subject matter, it's not a gory film and it doesn't glorify, over dramatize, or try to play with the sympathies and emotions of the viewer.  I am not sure what purpose this film serves, but for me it helped me see the suicides of my loved ones in a little different light, maybe I won't be so angry anymore, maybe I can find my peace in their peace.Cherise Everhard, May 2008",4,"While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die. - Leonardo da Vinci",1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2071,"['When', 'asked', 'husband', 'what', 'movie', 'were', 'watching', 'tonight', 'gave', 'films', 'description', 'was', 'immediately', 'repulsed', 'argued', 'watching', 'such', 'depressing', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'begged', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'TV', 'had', 'interest', 'watching', 'people', 'leap', 'deaths', 'then', 'listen', 'families', 'morn', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones.As', 'usually', 'case', 'remote', 'control', 'wars', 'home', 'lost', 'grabbed', 'book', 'settled', 'ignore', 'tube', 'Five', 'minutes', 'book', 'was', 'forgotten', 'was', 'riveted', 'As', 'silly', 'may', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'depressing', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'sad', 'tragic', 'more', 'fascinating', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'killed', 'bridge', 'frightening.I', 'was', 'really', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'loved', 'deeply', 'commit', 'suicide', ""n't"", 'pain', 'earth', 'comparable', 'pain', 'friends', 'family', 'experience', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'others', 'go', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'gone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'Surprisingly', 'friends', 'families', 'are', 'place', 'grieving', 'process', 'where', 'have', 'accepted', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'understand', 'why', 'happened', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'jumped', 'had', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'sort', 'long', 'term', 'problems', 'One', 'father', 'seemed', 'find', 'peace', 'thinking', 'son', 'was', 'finally', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'finally', 'happy.The', 'absolute', 'desperation', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'take', 'terrifying', 'leap', 'palpable', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'empathy', 'involved', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'gory', 'film', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'dramatize', 'try', 'play', 'sympathies', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'purpose', 'film', 'helped', 'see', 'suicides', 'loved', 'ones', 'little', 'different', 'light', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'angry', 'anymore', 'maybe', 'can', 'find', 'peace', 'peace.Cherise', 'Everhard', 'May', '2008']",The Bridge

For me, at the beginning of the film, there is a comparison made between ""a celebration of life"" (a wind surfer riding the waves beneath the Golden Gates, celebrating one of the most beautiful places on the face of our earth) and someone above feeling the exact opposite and acting upon their own set of feelings. The opening of this film took me be surprise despite knowing what the film was about when it started.The Bridge is about ""place"". How can ONE place be chosen so often for an activity such as suicide?The Bridge is about 'time'. How can ONE place be chosen time and time again to 'end time'?The Bridge is about ""decision"". Seeing people... really seeing people, make and commit to a decision to end their lives has a chilling effect for sure. And while going to the bridge may be a decision in and of itself, that final moment, that moment that is less than a split second in length, is a moment of self-decision unlike any other.

All I knew then was that the majestic bridge was awe-inspiring, and walking its length was one of the highlights of my west coast trip. Recently, though, my feelings about that fabled location changed, most likely forever, and I attribute that up to Eric Steel's documentary The Bridge.I credit Steel with the lack of sensationalism in this disturbing but somehow dignified film. It is the work of an entire year of patient filming alongside the Golden Gate Bridge, and it is an undertaking which I'm sure will never be duplicated by any other American filmmaker. The entire tone of the movie is one of hushed, subdued stillness, and Steel does not intrude with commentary or judgment, merely focuses in on each death and provides a background to these individual tragedies. There is horror here in this subject, and yet I, someone highly vulnerable to the effects of sad events caught on tape, could not help but look on during each frame of this production, start to finish. I looked on, even as I felt the weight of loss steal into me and set my heart pounding. There was not one suicide Steel showed during which I did not want to cry out and somehow wish away what I was seeing before me, these people who were one moment alive and then they were not. ""Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it,"" I kept thinking. And yet during the run-time nearly two-dozen people jumped and died.I literally did not sleep the night I saw this DVD.The Bridge is among the most powerful examples of filmmaking I have witnessed, and it is life-changing. I can honestly admit that now, a year after my first visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, I'm not sure I'd want to go back. And if I did I could never again walk across that soaring space without a keen awareness that I was passing across a site on which over 1200 people knew such misery that they threw themselves outward into death: a concept that smothers me with incomprehensible dread.The Bridge deserves five stars.

It's sad but not mopey, interspersing long, lingering frames of the bridge in various weather conditions (often punctuated by a sudden, jarring splash beneath the span) with reflections upon the jumpers' troubled lives by their friends and family members. In a way it's heartening that so many of the subjects are calm, collected and rational about the event, having properly worked their way through the various stages of grief and come out the other side. They're changed, but they're also intact. Footage of the jumps themselves, collected through a year-long observation via telephoto lens, offer a vivid glimpse into these poor souls' most private moments. They vary from startling to heartbreaking, and often border on the voyeuristic. In one sense, it feels improper to share that intimate moment of climactic decision with strangers, but in another it lends their stories a sense of magnitude. These aren't just names in a list, empty faceless stories without a tether to our own reality - they're distinct individuals, emotively struggling to cope with something that's too large for their own conscience. As we hear the tale that led them to such a dark pit of despair, we see them quite physically grappling with that maddening choice.

1062519,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000O76PXK,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 10]","Even at a fleet 94 minutes, this infamous 2006 documentary feels overlong and rather padded despite the visceral shock of witnessing a man throwing himself off the Golden Gate Bridge. This wide-angle, long-distance shot opens Eric Steel's oddly uninvolving study of the twenty-four people who decided to use the fatalistic landmark to end their lives in 2004. Twenty-three succeeded, and Steel's multiple camera set-up captured most of them. In his eerie film, he focuses on a handful of the victims and lets the grieving families speak about them. Apparently, they were unaware that the filmmaker had the footage in his possession, a deliberate decision in that Steel did not want to encourage any further suicide attempts due to the film. At the same time, there is something undeniably exploitative about his approach.Although the images on the bridge are startling with a sense of foreboding that I personally found unbearable, the interviews with the friends and relatives are not all that engaging probably because their comments start to feel repetitive no matter whom the victim is. In attempting to capture the human spirit in crisis, especially with the presence of Alex Heffes' (Dear Frankie) melancholic music to underscore the shots, Steel maintains a perspective that feels too myopic since the testimonies in themselves cannot give the full story behind the motivations of the so-called jumpers. Consequently, there is no palpable sense of intimacy with the victims. Moreover, Steel consciously avoids contextual discussions with city officials or psychiatric professionals. They could have lent a broader perspective on the issue, especially when it comes to the constant debate over installing suicide barriers.The one exception is Kevin Hines, a young man with bipolar disorder who was the only survivor in 2004. Only he is able to describe what it was like to have jumped off the bridge. He survived because he decided to shift feet-first when he regretted his decision in mid-jump. The most disheartening aspect of Hines' account is how he gave obvious signs of his hopelessness to indifferent passers-by for forty minutes only to be accosted by a German tourist to take a picture.

If they end up using it to convince San Francisco to stop letting anyone walk or bike over the bridge, erect suicide barriers or have security all over the bridge, then add a star.  Having the one guy who survived the jump might be a good story to scare someone from doing it.  But is this a dvd you want to buy? In a way this is part snuff film, part documentary. The reason a lot of people will want to see this is out of morbid curiosity to see people jump. The same reason they rent Faces of Death. I rented it and watched it tonight and it was extremely difficult to watch, especially to see the first person jump. I yelled in horror when I saw it. And I've seen everything. Those of you saying that ""everyone"" should watch this film are out of your minds.  There is a reason that suicides are usually not reported on.  The reason is that everytime the media does so others follow suit.  That is my main reason for giving this a low rating.  That and the fact that it is so depressing to watch and you are not going to want to see it a second time so why buy it?  If you have to see it, rent it. Or go to the arthouse cinema. But if you do find it playing somewhere- trust me - don't bring a date.I am not equating the work here from a cinematic perspective to Faces of Death (or it's sequels and spin-offs) and I do not believe that the director and crew made this with bad intentions.

The subject is people who jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.  It is a very poignant documentary about people who commit suicide off this grand structure and the effect their deaths have on the ones left behind.  Be forewarned.  This film documents 23 of the known 24 suicides in year 2004.  Some one called this a snuff film and I admit it has the shocking effect of a snuff film but I am convinced beyond a doubt that it was not Eric Steel's intention to create a snuff film when he made this movie.  With camera's strategically placed, Eric and his staff documented suicides in progress.  Some successful, some rescued.  His staff often intervened to try and rescue the jumpers before they jumped.It is a disturbing film and it is also heart wrenching.  There are in depth interviews with some of the friends and family left behind.  Those left behind are always so stunned.  Even if they had an inkling of the suicide's intention, they are always shocked, stunned, full of guilt.  A co-worker of mine committed suicide in 2000 and I remember feeling all those emotions.  Those emotions rocked me to the core and her suicide haunted me for years.  I was left wondering, why didn't she say something?  She was always smiling!  Then last year my ex-husband's favorite brother committed suicide and again I felt those over-powering emotions of shock and surprise.Seeing this movie literally horrified me that people can be so severely depressed and insomnia-ridden that they choose to die rather than live.  It's like they don't realize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.I cannot understand why this bridge does not have a suicide barrier.  Yes the politician's arguments may seem valid, but when people are easily climbing over a bridge's 4 foot barrier and jumping to their deaths, it's obvious something HAS to be done.I would recommend this movie if for it's educational purpose alone.

The film makers captured 23 of the 24 suicides that took place from the bridge in 2004, and show the stories and footage from some of those who jumped to their death as well as a survivor and a rescue.While the subject matter is very dark and bleak, the stories run the full spectrum from awe inspiring and forgiving to maddeningly depressing. It is an eye opening look at something that we as a society choose not to see, or choose not to think about.Eric Steele directs the documentary while conducting interviews with witnesses and family members of those who are no longer with us. Some have found an understanding and carry with them a forgiveness for those who chose to end their lives while others are still questioning and baffled by the loss. For anyone who has dealt with mental illness in their lives, whether it be through a family member, friend, or even themselves, there is a very real feel to the stories that one can easily understand. For those who have never experienced something as chaotic as mental illness, the film offers great insight into the human psyche and just how far we all are and feel from time to time.From the thermals that warp the footage on hot days to the clouds and fog that roll into the bay and shroud the bridge in a mist, the film brings the viewer right up to the cold damp railing and lets you experience the rumble that vibrates through it as well as the bounce that you feel when you stand upon the bridge as a truck drives by. From the people who refuse to look up from their shoes as they walk by someone sitting on the railing to those who stop and try to talk to them, there is a sense of tragic loneliness as well as heroic interception that the film brings to the screen so beautifully in an agonizing way.",4,Beautifully Agonizing,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,1882,"['Bridge', 'documentary', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'tragic', 'loss', 'life', 'voluntary', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'makers', 'captured', '23', '24', 'suicides', 'took', 'place', 'bridge', '2004', 'show', 'stories', 'footage', 'who', 'jumped', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'survivor', 'rescue.While', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'dark', 'bleak', 'stories', 'run', 'full', 'spectrum', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'forgiving', 'maddeningly', 'depressing', 'eye', 'opening', 'look', 'something', 'society', 'choose', 'not', 'see', 'choose', 'not', 'think', 'about.Eric', 'Steele', 'documentary', 'conducting', 'interviews', 'witnesses', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'have', 'found', 'understanding', 'carry', 'forgiveness', 'who', 'chose', 'end', 'lives', 'others', 'are', 'still', 'questioning', 'baffled', 'loss', 'anyone', 'who', 'dealt', 'mental', 'illness', 'lives', 'be', 'family', 'member', 'friend', 'even', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'stories', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'something', 'as', 'chaotic', 'mental', 'illness', 'film', 'great', 'insight', 'human', 'psyche', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'feel', 'time', 'time.From', 'thermals', 'warp', 'footage', 'hot', 'days', 'clouds', 'fog', 'roll', 'bay', 'shroud', 'bridge', 'mist', 'film', 'viewer', 'right', 'up', 'cold', 'damp', 'railing', 'experience', 'rumble', 'as', 'well', 'bounce', 'feel', 'when', 'stand', 'bridge', 'truck', 'drives', 'people', 'who', 'refuse', 'look', 'up', 'shoes', 'walk', 'someone', 'sitting', 'railing', 'who', 'stop', 'try', 'talk', 'sense', 'tragic', 'loneliness', 'as', 'well', 'heroic', 'interception', 'film', 'screen', 'so', 'beautifully', 'agonizing', 'way']",The Bridge

1062529,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000O76PXK,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[81, 88]","One of the pure joys (a word I use intentionally considering its disturbing connotations in this context) of the documentary is the element of challenge--to undertake a concept that brings up more questions than answers, more complexity than simplicity.  When the proper challenge is identified, it is the talented film maker who explores rather than concludes, who looks for the range of possibility and concern, the mirror of real life if you will, rather than find an oversimplified answer to everything.And this is where this film succeeds immensely.The Golden Gate Bridge is evidently one of the most popular spots for suicide in the world.  In 2004, when this film was shot, 24 people threw themselves from it.  And Eric Steel, shooting the bridge from various angles during this year, caught several of those suicides.There is an ethical discussion to be had about the premise of the film alone, an effort to capture suicides on film rather than prevent them from happening.  But Steel's handling of these events is far more human and considerate than the manipulative handling of so-called reality shows, where the people are but spectacles who can be maneuvered and edited in any which way to get a pre-desired end.  Steel takes these suicides and studies them by talking to the deceased's relatives and friends, or people who witnessed the event, to look at not only the impact of suicide and mental illness, but also the effects of relationships, of living through the day-to-day and not wanting (or not expecting) such events of drama in their lives.The ranges of attitudes regarding mental illness alone are well worth watching this movie for.  From a couple of kiters who are so into their sport that they cannot relate at all to a person's desire to hurl himself to his own death, to parents who have to live with the fact that their own son will most likely find a way to kill himself (and eventually does).  People who live with regret for their own actions (or lack thereof) or anger at a loved one for leaving them in that way.  The suicides in this film are not presented in any way to glorify them.  Instead, each and every person who jumps (or who attempts to jump) comes across as scared and confused.  The jumper who survives his attempt describes it best when he says how he was determined to die until his hands actually let go of the rail, at which point he knew that he didn't want to die anymore.  Every jumper in this film comes across as a frightened and confused person, even a guy who seems to be talking almost casually on a phone before he climbs up onto a rail, crosses himself and goes.The story of Gene, the thread that is carried through the movie as we see a man in black with a long mop of curly hair pace back and forth along the bridge as though either looking for the right spot or trying to convince himself to finally go through with it, is probably the most compelling for the essence of painful tragedy involved.  His death caps off the film perfectly--it is both sad and shocking, and definitely a punch in the gut.

Their opinions are liberally peppered with `you know', which has become America's most frequently expression.The camera work is also practically shoddy. The first leap that is shown in medium shot is completely missed by the cameraman. The filmmakers create `the tension', by the threat of showing someone jump to their death, which I find rather sick and voyeuristic.With all that is going on in the world could these manipulative filmmakers not have chosen a safer topic to shoot?

It left me empty.. I think the interesting thing about the filming is exactly how most of the suicides are shown as just a splash in the water.. even the people shown in their full trajectory are done so until the last second, then the camera moves away to not portray the impact. Why? For the same reason the people who were interviewed distanced themselves from the reality of the jumpers. After all, people pretend to be all-knowing about what goes on inside the heads of everyone else.. if someone kicks me in the shin, they may imagine it is hurting and maybe even titrate the imaginative scale of pain according to whatever past experiences they may have had.. but they won't know how much it hurts to me.. nobody will, except me...  And I find it interesting how cavalier even the family members were in their discourse. Similar to the story about Samuel Beckett visiting a psychiatric facility and meeting a schizophrenic. His description was ""he was like a hunk of meat, there was no one there"".  And this is a Nobel Prize winner... Anyway, it is disappointing to see ourselves reduced to a splash in obscure waters or encapsulated within the spectrum of mental illness. It certainly keeps the ""normal"" people away from such a nefarious reality. Truth be told, interviews with many people who survived jumping off bridges reveal that most of them immediately regretted their decision. The desire for life is present in everyone, but we create layer upon layer of denial and repression to suffocate it.. living an inane life and smirking about random death is a horrendous way to live.. so the question is, what extreme jolt would it take to remove you from your own powerfully repressed psychotic universe?

I live in Seattle and damn near drove to Portland when I saw it was playing there in February.  Instead, I awaited the release and arrived at the video store as it opened on May 12th.Maybe my expectations were too high but the hype and the incredible trailer did not live up to the film itself.  It wasn't so much a film about the bridge or even about the jumpers but about the people that knew the jumpers.  It offered no real insight into the bottomless topic of suicide.  The HBO documentary called Suicide is extremely compelling and haunting but this just didn't have the sense of despair it should.  Yes, the footage of the people on the railing, those who jumped and almost jumped were quite striking.  For that alone I recommend the film.  Yet more background would have enhanced this movie.  Like doctors, security officers who work the bridge, the writings or drawings of the suicidal, something else to give The Bridge more dimension.  And what ever happened to the girl who was rescued?  I would have loved to hear the aftermath.Suicide is a great topic and, as Camus said, ""The only true philosophical problem.""  In  some way, The Bridge just didn't have that gut wrenching sorrow that it really needed.  As well, on the special features, I thought having Kevin ""what's his name"" (the survivor) talk about getting help and showing the suicide hotline number was tacky at best.

Steel was able to capture nearly all the suicides that took place in 2004 by setting up cameras and letting them run. Steel then interviewed friends and family members of people who jumped. What emerges is a story about intense pain and desperation, people who felt they were somehow on the outside of life. What also emerges is a story about the rest of us who really don't want to know about such things because they bring us pain.It's been nearly week since I saw the film, and I'm still haunted by the images, the people. I can't shake the thought that I witnessed their last act. One of them was a young man named Gene. I keep seeing him in my mind's eye, walking up and down the railing, his long black hair flying in the wind, waiting, searching, for the right moment to jump.This, of course, is Eric Steel's intent: I'm not supposed to be able to shake the images. I'm supposed to be disturbed by them.Watching, I thought of W.H. Auden's poem, ""Musee des Beaux Arts"":About suffering they were never wrong,The Old Masters; how well, they understoodIts human position; how it takes placeWhile someone else is eating or openinga window or just walking dully along;How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waitingFor the miraculous birth, there always must beChildren who did not specially want it to happen, skatingOn a pond at the edge of the wood:They never forgotThat even the dreadful martyrdom must run its courseAnyhow in a corner, some untidy spotWhere the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horseScratches its innocent behind on a tree.In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns awayQuite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman mayHave heard the splash, the forsaken cry,But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shoneAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the greenWater; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seenSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.1940Steel wants viewers to make the connection to Auden's poem, I think.  The spirit of the poem is suggested in the imagery several times.  Steel shows us that suffering takes place all around us. Yet we don't notice because we have ""somewhere to get to."" We sail ""calmly on.""If you're looking for light entertainment or factual documentary, this film is not for you.  I love dark themes and thought-provoking material, and I don't think anything else I've ever seen matches the intensity of this film.  _The Bridge_ will encourage viewers to think deeply about artistic and social responsibility.

Recovery of the bodies by the shore patrol was not shown because it was simply not necessary.The film certainly gives the rest of us a lot to think about:  how fortunate we are if we never consider suicide; how much we have to be grateful for if we do not suffer from constant disappointment and despair; how hard it is to have, or to live with someone who has, a mental or emotional illness, which can be extremely difficult to treat and a terrible burden for all concerned.",5,"Compassion, sensitivity, and no exploitation",1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1092,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'filmmakers', 'showed', 'great', 'deal', 'compassion', 'sensitivity', 'low-key', 'speaks-for-itself', 'documentary', 'people', 'who', 'commit', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'Kudos', 'also', 'families', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'courageous', 'enough', 'speak', 'losses', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'driven', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'kill', 'way.Only', 'couple', 'jumps', 'are', 'shown', 'entirety', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'graphic', 'jumpers', 'hit', 'water', 'very', 'fast', 'obviously', 'corpse', 'blood', 'shown', 'afterwards', 'Recovery', 'bodies', 'shore', 'patrol', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'necessary.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'rest', 'lot', 'think', 'how', 'fortunate', 'are', 'never', 'consider', 'suicide', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'be', 'grateful', 'do', 'not', 'suffer', 'constant', 'disappointment', 'despair', 'how', 'hard', 'have', 'live', 'someone', 'who', 'mental', 'emotional', 'illness', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'treat', 'terrible', 'burden', 'concerned']",The Bridge

My community also has two large bridges but suicide attempts off of them are almost unheard of.  ""The Bridge"" is an excellent account of what drives mentally ill people to take their lives and also shows the effect their suicides has on those that they leave behind.  The Golden Gate Bridge has had more suicides off of it than any other man-made structure and it attracts jumpers from all over the world---in the documentary one of the victims traveled all the way from North Carolina for his jump.  The filmmakers used telescopic lenses to film the bridge for all of 2004 from various angles and caught on film 22 of the 24 jumpers.  The filmmakers were in ethically murky territory.  They did not want anyone to learn of the real purpose of their project lest it encouraged more people to jump.  They filmed from such a long distance that they could not personally intervene in stopping the suicides although they did telephone the authorities if they spotted someone who appeared likely to jump.  The cameramen had to develop a sense of who they were trying to find among the thousands of pedestrians who cross the bridge every day.  Who looked distraught or whose behavior seemed out of the ordinary and suspicious.  What was bizarre is that some of the jumpers climbed over the railings with people walking right by either oblivious or unwilling to intervene.The film interviews the surviving friends and family of the jumpers and pretty much without exception all of the jumpers were suffering from severe, long-term mental illness.  Many of these people isolated themselves away from their concerned friends and family and no doubt others had no friends or family involved with them anymore.  I've seen that a lot in my psychiatric law practice, that many people with long-term mental illness just end up driving their remaining friends and family away, the people just too exhausted to keep helping these suffering people",5,excellent look at the causes and repercussions of suicide,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2124,"[""'ve"", 'represented', 'clients', 'psychiatric', 'commitment', 'hearings', '15', 'years', 'now', 'great', 'many', 'clients', 'are', 'hospital', 'will', 'due', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'threats', 'My', 'community', 'also', 'two', 'large', 'bridges', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'are', 'almost', 'unheard', 'Bridge', 'excellent', 'account', 'what', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'take', 'lives', 'also', 'effect', 'suicides', 'leave', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'had', 'more', 'suicides', 'other', 'man-made', 'structure', 'jumpers', 'world', '-in', 'documentary', 'one', 'victims', 'traveled', 'way', 'North', 'Carolina', 'jump', 'filmmakers', 'used', 'telescopic', 'lenses', 'film', 'bridge', '2004', 'various', 'angles', 'caught', 'film', '22', '24', 'jumpers', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'ethically', 'murky', 'territory', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'anyone', 'learn', 'real', 'purpose', 'project', 'encouraged', 'more', 'people', 'jump', 'filmed', 'such', 'long', 'distance', 'could', 'not', 'personally', 'intervene', 'stopping', 'suicides', 'did', 'telephone', 'authorities', 'spotted', 'someone', 'who', 'appeared', 'likely', 'jump', 'cameramen', 'had', 'develop', 'sense', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'thousands', 'pedestrians', 'who', 'cross', 'bridge', 'day', 'Who', 'looked', 'distraught', 'behavior', 'seemed', 'ordinary', 'suspicious', 'What', 'was', 'bizarre', 'jumpers', 'climbed', 'railings', 'people', 'walking', 'right', 'oblivious', 'unwilling', 'intervene.The', 'film', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'friends', 'family', 'jumpers', 'pretty', 'much', 'exception', 'jumpers', 'were', 'suffering', 'severe', 'long-term', 'mental', 'illness', 'Many', 'people', 'isolated', 'away', 'concerned', 'friends', 'family', 'doubt', 'others', 'had', 'friends', 'family', 'involved', 'anymore', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'psychiatric', 'law', 'practice', 'many', 'people', 'long-term', 'mental', 'illness', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'remaining', 'friends', 'family', 'away', 'people', 'just', 'too', 'exhausted', 'keep', 'helping', 'suffering', 'people']",The Bridge
