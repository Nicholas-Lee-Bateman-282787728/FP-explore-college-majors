308898,A2EOFYRFB292KS,6302371376,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[9, 10]","Why was Valentino the ultimate movie star?? Here is the answer to this query, you can see it in all his films, but particularly here: Charisma and sexual energy are combined in this movie in an unforgettable performance.Valentino prances into the casino like a tiger in the hunt. His first look at Lady Mayo would have torn the skin off a she-bear! That look of his was loaded with amunition: sexual desire, passion, allure, and a quite a bit of uncontrolled testosterone. No wonder he was such a legend. Who has all of that in one body? He did. The scenes of passion are much more important for what they leave up to the imagination. Now we are too literal, but back then in the world of silent cinema one look, one touch could detonate an explosion. If you watch closely, the way his beautiful large hands hold her is pure poetry and the concentration that he lavishes on her with a gaze fixed in obsession, would make any woman believe she was the center of his world instantly. Now what sets this movie off from the others is the locale, and the mythology of exoticism: The tents in the desert are stocked with luxurious rugs and cushions, an incense burner is never too far away, and horses run wildly in the sands every other minute as a metaphor of unbridled animal instinct.Valentino is fully clothed in Arab exotica, yet there are moments when he stands in attitude that you can swear you can see him naked in your mind's eye, so intense is the animal magnetism he projects. We don't see the rape scene, yet we KNOW it happened, this is the master stroke of the director: Everyone can fancy their own and hence keep on thinking and dreaming about this scenario of lust and desire in innumerable different ways. The reason he drove women insane back then was that he looked like he wanted to do it right then and there, and that was something that culturally, was brand new in America. In this movie, the fact that he is a 'savage' Arab is 90% of the appeal. Eventhough it is explained that he has been educated, he still looks too dark, and too ethnic  when next to the demure Lady Mayo that looks like her stock got that white from eating a particular kind of tea biscuit for several generations. Her gesturing is equally repressed, at times ackward when contrasted with his feline grace, the Arab Sheik is a lion of freedom by comparison.We understand why Lady Mayo soon enough starts writing in the sand ""I love you Ahmed"". Here is a gamble for someone of her station and 'purity of blood' to land a wild beast of uncertain heritage, and taste from the very source of sensuality, and tame it through love. There is a scene where he finds out by accident that she cares about him, and his look of satisfaction, then love, transform the torrid attraction into a romance. That was the subtext, the 'hidden thought'  that produced the blockbuster, and apparently truckloads of crazed English and American women that traveled to Arabia after the movie was released, hoping to be ensnared or at least raped by a similar savage chief. The cultural mentality of the time ascertained that the darker skinned humans were more enslaved by their passions and lusts than the other races. It also had created an elaborate mythology of their sexual prowess as well as the shape and size of their equipment in this area. This movie opened the door into the possibilities of an interacial horizon, with all the images of  wildness that these creatures could muster in more civilized brains.Here is the legendary Latin Lover in the flesh, the very incarnation of the legend come alive in a better way than it could now, because the very silence of the media put aside any other way of communication (or language barrier) and enhanced the visual so much more. A historical movie, a fascinating adventure into sociological and cultural perspectives that have not changed all that much today, as this area of the world continues to cast a spell of mystery, wildness and danger in American audiences of today, but above all, a love story of passion and ecstasy that has endured.",5,"Still The World's Greatest Lover: A study in unbridled, animal desire",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,4068,"['Why', 'was', 'Valentino', 'ultimate', 'movie', 'star', 'Here', 'answer', 'query', 'can', 'see', 'films', 'particularly', 'here', 'Charisma', 'sexual', 'energy', 'are', 'combined', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'performance.Valentino', 'prances', 'casino', 'tiger', 'hunt', 'first', 'look', 'Lady', 'Mayo', 'would', 'have', 'torn', 'skin', 'she-bear', 'look', 'was', 'loaded', 'amunition', 'sexual', 'desire', 'passion', 'allure', 'quite', 'bit', 'uncontrolled', 'testosterone', 'wonder', 'was', 'such', 'legend', 'Who', 'one', 'body', 'did', 'scenes', 'passion', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'leave', 'up', 'imagination', 'Now', 'are', 'too', 'literal', 'back', 'then', 'world', 'silent', 'cinema', 'one', 'look', 'one', 'touch', 'could', 'detonate', 'explosion', 'watch', 'closely', 'way', 'beautiful', 'large', 'hands', 'hold', 'pure', 'poetry', 'concentration', 'gaze', 'fixed', 'obsession', 'would', 'make', 'woman', 'believe', 'was', 'center', 'world', 'instantly', 'Now', 'what', 'movie', 'others', 'locale', 'mythology', 'exoticism', 'tents', 'desert', 'are', 'stocked', 'luxurious', 'rugs', 'cushions', 'incense', 'burner', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'horses', 'run', 'wildly', 'sands', 'other', 'minute', 'metaphor', 'unbridled', 'animal', 'instinct.Valentino', 'fully', 'clothed', 'Arab', 'exotica', 'yet', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'attitude', 'can', 'swear', 'can', 'see', 'naked', 'mind', 'eye', 'intense', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'projects', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'rape', 'scene', 'yet', 'KNOW', 'happened', 'master', 'stroke', 'director', 'Everyone', 'can', 'fancy', 'own', 'hence', 'keep', 'thinking', 'dreaming', 'scenario', 'lust', 'desire', 'innumerable', 'different', 'ways', 'reason', 'drove', 'women', 'insane', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'looked', 'wanted', 'do', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'was', 'something', 'culturally', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'America', 'movie', 'fact', ""'savage"", 'Arab', '90', '%', 'appeal', 'explained', 'been', 'educated', 'still', 'too', 'dark', 'too', 'ethnic', 'when', 'next', 'demure', 'Lady', 'Mayo', 'stock', 'got', 'white', 'eating', 'particular', 'kind', 'tea', 'biscuit', 'several', 'generations', 'gesturing', 'equally', 'repressed', 'times', 'ackward', 'when', 'contrasted', 'feline', 'grace', 'Arab', 'Sheik', 'lion', 'freedom', 'comparison.We', 'understand', 'why', 'Lady', 'Mayo', 'soon', 'enough', 'writing', 'sand', 'love', 'Ahmed', 'Here', 'gamble', 'someone', 'station', ""'purity"", 'blood', 'land', 'wild', 'beast', 'uncertain', 'heritage', 'taste', 'very', 'source', 'sensuality', 'tame', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'accident', 'look', 'satisfaction', 'then', 'love', 'transform', 'torrid', 'attraction', 'romance', 'was', 'subtext', ""'hidden"", 'thought', 'produced', 'blockbuster', 'apparently', 'truckloads', 'crazed', 'English', 'American', 'women', 'traveled', 'Arabia', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'hoping', 'be', 'ensnared', 'least', 'raped', 'similar', 'savage', 'chief', 'cultural', 'mentality', 'time', 'ascertained', 'darker', 'skinned', 'humans', 'were', 'more', 'enslaved', 'passions', 'lusts', 'other', 'races', 'also', 'had', 'created', 'elaborate', 'mythology', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'as', 'well', 'shape', 'size', 'equipment', 'area', 'movie', 'opened', 'door', 'possibilities', 'interacial', 'horizon', 'images', 'wildness', 'creatures', 'could', 'muster', 'more', 'civilized', 'brains.Here', 'legendary', 'Latin', 'Lover', 'flesh', 'very', 'incarnation', 'legend', 'come', 'alive', 'better', 'way', 'could', 'now', 'very', 'silence', 'media', 'put', 'aside', 'other', 'way', 'communication', 'language', 'barrier', 'enhanced', 'visual', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'historical', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'adventure', 'sociological', 'cultural', 'perspectives', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'much', 'today', 'area', 'world', 'cast', 'spell', 'mystery', 'wildness', 'danger', 'American', 'audiences', 'today', 'love', 'story', 'passion', 'ecstasy', 'endured']",N/A

308900,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,6302371376,Amazon Customer,"[37, 37]","Why do people still love Rudolph Valentino after all these years? This DVD provides an ideal way to get acquainted with the great leading man in his most famous roles.After the phenomenal succes of The Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse, studio execs were unsure what to do with the darkly handsome Valentino. At last, he landed the lead role in Paramount's The Sheik. Based on the ""scandalous"" best-seller, it was romantic melodrama in it's purest form.It's the story of a young English woman, Diana (Angnes Ayres) who crosses paths with the desert chieftan Sheik Ahmed ben Hassan. Fascinated by her spunk, he abducts her to become his wife. Diana is not too thrilled with the concept and resists. Thus begins the battle of wills.From a coldly logical standpoint, the Sheik is not a very good movie. Valentino's acting is not as good as in his later work. The script is somewhat disjointed. In fact, it was a predicted bomb when it was first released. However, the movie posesses a kitchy, innocent charm that is probably as fascinating now as it was then. It is one of those movies you find yourself enjoying even though you don't know why.The version on this DVD is a tinted print in pretty good shape. Some of the titles vary slightly from the VHS release (for example, Diana is referred to as the daughter of a poet in the VHS and the daughter of a peer on DVD) Some scenes are added or cut. People who own the VHS release may chose to make their own comparisons.The soundtrack is electronic/orchestral. It is a selection of music that was available to organists at the time and probably some of the music was used when the Sheik was first released. The music generally does not sound too electronic though it may bug purists (though the VHS edition has an obvious synth score). I enjoyed it.The second film on the DVD is the sequel, Son of the Sheik. Valentino plays both father and son. Unlike The Sheik, which followed the book it was based on, Son of the Sheik changed the plot considerably (and I feel for the better). Valentino is Ahemed jr. who meets and falls in love with Yasmin (Vilma Banky) They plan a secret rendezvous but Yasmin's corrupt family follows her and captures Ahmed for ransom. Because he will not give his name he is tortured. His friends rescue him but he is very depressed. He believes poor Yasmin betrayed him. So, when opportunity arises, he steals away with her for his own brand of revenge.Son of the Sheik is a well directed, well acted movie. While on a smaller scale that the Sheik, it had a much larger budget. There is much comedy added. Valentino and Banky absolutely set the screen on fire as a pair of lovers who now hate each other. However, for all it's charms, it does not posess the oddball charisma that made the Sheik such a fun movie.The print used is black and white, the music can either be the new electronic/orchestral score or the original re-release orchestral score. The latter has a lot of static and I found it annoying so I used the newer score instead.Whichever one of these movies is your favorite, I am sure you will enjoy the presentation.Also included on the DVD:Three Valentino short films including footage from his funeral. Rather depressing.A great DVD to round out your collection, to introduce yourself to Valentino or for comparative purposes.

It might not have the same type of sweeping panoramic shots of the desert, but the plot and acting are much more complex.  By today's standards, 'The Sheik' seems more like a fun period piece, with some campy hokey moments.  The plot really isn't that complex; independent woman wants to take a tour alone into the desert, winds up kidnapped by a sexy young sheik, fights against her new role, and just when she's fallen in love with him she's kidnapped by another man and has to be taken back.  And though it might be his best-known movie, Rudy does little more than leer or gaze at Agnes Ayers's character of Diana for much of the movie (though the look on his face when he  confronts Omair to take back what's his is incredible!).  The acting in the sequel is much more fluid and evolved.  By comparison, though the plot starts out simply enough, there are far more complex developments and twists and turns.  I also loved the short guy (Son of an Owl?), who seemed like the comic relief.

It's amazing what five years (the time between the making of the original and the sequel) did for Rudolph Valentino's acting. In my opinion, he was one of the finest actors of the time. While he starts out a little over the top in The Sheik he quickly improves. Perhaps part of the melodrama was due to the director, who's to say? Either way both movies are thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly action packed. They're well acted with only mild melodrama. And of course Rudolph Valentino's presence doesn't hurt anything.When it comes to Valentino himself I prefer The Eagle to the Sheik movies but they still rank second on my list. He was actually quite good at humor and I'm glad that The Son of the Sheik capitalized on that. He obviously had fun playing his own father and it's great to watch. It's too bad he wasn't able to make more movies. I'm sure they would have been just as great.If you're interested in silent movies (or movies in general) I highly recommend both Sheik movies.

After taking an interest in silent films, I decided to buy this dvd and see what he was all about.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.  The Shiek and The Son of the Shiek are two amazing and surprisingly intriguing films though the latter is superior and was definitely my favorite.  The first is the story of a shiek who becomes entranced by a strong-willed woman he kidnaps and from there on the story unfolds.  In the second, he plays dual roles, father and son, and there is quite a bit more action.  Still, both movies are great and worth watching.As for Valentino, he was an amazing presence on film.  To me, he is ""the"" sex symbol that is incomparable to any from his era to now.  In the first movie, his mannerisms and facial expressions are more dramatized, but the second film, he is more natural and its in that one he was even more beautiful.  I can see why people are still entranced with him after all this time.  Count me in as one of those.As for the DVD, both of the films are good prints and the music fits the film.  You also get to see the Pathe newsreel showing his funeral which is very sad.  Most interestingly you get to see him judge a beauty contest and there is a clip called ""The Shiek's Physique"" which is a clip of him sunbathing on the beach.  He is gorgeous in that as well.All in all, its a great deal and a good bargain to get to see one of the most amazing actors.

I also hadn't seen a silent film in years, so I tried to take a step back in time and imagine the magic this film conveyed to a 1921 audience.It was surprising to see how much time was spent on costumes and the sets. I wondered where the desert scenes were filmed since they looked so much like a real desert as opposed to southern California deserts. There seemed to be a cast of hundreds in Arabic clothing and on horseback and camelback. This film must have enthralled its audience back then.I can see the charm and allure in Rudolph Valentino depsite the heaven silent film make-up. He is a powerful sheik and falls in love with an Englishwoman. So he just takes her. Lady Diana Mayo, played by Agnes Ayres, is an independent and feisty woman. The two are at ends but you can guess the outcome.It was fascinating to go more 90 years back in time so see what movies were like. It's odd to have to read dialogue cards after someone ""speaks."" Of course, what other choice was there? The written descriptions seem odd and archaic in a strange, flowerly manner. I also didn't realize that when a new character was introduced and described, the name of the actor was on the bottom. I finally made the connection.I can only imagine the AWE that this epic inspired in moviergoers in 1921. The print was good but seemed to have an orange color to it and I realize it was tinted. Also, the music could be overwhelming and uninspired at times. It didn't seem to match what was happening on screen. I almost think no music would have been better.The three included shorts were fun to watch. RUDOLPH VALENTINO AND HIS 88 AMERICAN BEAUTIES has him judging a beauty contest of 88 women representing cities across the US and Canada. We can see what beauty was in the 1920's--the women's hair, make-up and clothes styles.THE SHEIK'S PHYSIQUE is a funny short of Valentino dressing for the beach. His tragic death at 31 shocked a nation and we see his funeral on a Pathe newsreel and scenes of him lying in state.I wonder if Valentino would have made the transition to sound film.

He was very muscular all over and must have worked out all the time which movie stars in those days didn't seem to do much. I'm always surprised at how skinny the arms are on male hero stars in the 40s and 50s. Well, Rudy was ""built"". Surprisingly, I didn't really miss dialogue as I expected to. Maybe it was because I'd read the book but I could follow what was happening very well. They changed the story around some at the first to include her running around in a harem girl costume which was not in the book at all and seemed a pretty stupid thing to add to the film. Also, they changed the ending quite a bit but same happy ending.  It was a pretty long movie for those days. I sat there and watched it all the way through so it wasn't boring for sure. I can imagine that the story alone must have been quite a sensation back in those days. However, I was surprised that they never actually ""admitted"" that she had been raped by him.  No idea why as the codes hadn't yet come into being then and it was certainly in the book.

The Sheik vs the Son of the Sheik, the 2nd is a better quality of film, and the difference in the facial acting is much improved. In the first film Valentino acted with his eyes, improved in the 2nd film. He is captivating in both. I was also made aware of the times, when The Sheik was about to marry his true love. He has been rasied as an Arab, and she knows him as The Sheik but when she is about to marry him, the expanation of his heritage is he is not an Arab but a mix of spanish and french by birth and adopted and raised as an Arab son by the ruling Sheik. It was interesting how they explained this as the cultures of ""the day"" did not mix.I really enjoyed both movies, I was also impressed in the Son of the Skeik how well the makeup was done on the older Sheik, of course Valentino played both parts. Also the scenes of father and son together, were shot very well, again for the times.The extras included in the DVD are all very informatative. I recommend this DVD to film buffs.

For some reason this is the film that is most identified with Rudolph Valentino even though it is not even close to being his best film (""The Son of the Sheik"" is much better, mainly because the sequel enjoyed much more of a budget than did the 1921 original).  The story is rather basic: Valentino plays Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, who casts his compelling gaze upon fesity British socialite Lady Diana Mayo (Agnes Ayres) and steals her to his remote desert encampment.  Lady Diana resists the Sheik's advances, although clearly she really, really, really wants to succumb.  But it is not until she is kidnaped by desert bandits and rescued by her hero that she gives herself completely to Ahmed.""The Sheik"" is passable entertainment, especially for a silent film, but I want to again remind everyone this is not Valentino's best film, just his most famous (""The Eagle"" is probably his best).  This is simply one of those classic silent films that you should see at least once, even if it proves not to catch your fancy.  The cast includes Patsy Ruth Miller as Zilah, a Marriage Market prospect, George Waggner as the tribal chieftain Yousaef, Frank Butler as Sir Aubrey Mayo, and you can even spot Adolphe Menjou as Raoul de Saint Hubert.Most Romantic Line: In a silent movie?  Just imagine stenciling dotted lines on the screen between Valentino's eyes and the object of his desire.If you like ""The Sheik,"" then check out these other films on the AFI's list: #56 ""The English Patient.""  Why?  Because it also takes place in the desert.  Sort of.  The only other real possibility would be #2 ""Gone With the Wind"" because after Valentino's untimely death it was the gaze of Clark Gable that made most women want to swoon.

308923,A39AN1E0VZGPB9,6302371376,Polkadotty,"[8, 9]","Another review by PD's daughter.I was given this movie from one of moms friends (which I am sooo very happy that I got it!!) but even before that I was mightily curious as to what created such an insane craze and obsession in the 1920's.  Now I know.  His name was Rudolph Valentino.I had read ""The Sheik"" (well the condensed version by Barbara Cartland, but it followed the original story never the less) a few months ago and was really captured by this ruthless Spanish-Brit mix desert sheik.  The Sheik Ahmed was cruel, and seemingly heartless (brutal really, but I guess it would be called animal brutality, if you know what I mean..), stating ""an Arab takes what he wants""  What the Sheik really wanted was Diana, the spoiled yet beautiful aristocratic brit whose room he had snuck into and switched her bullets for blanks and later kidnapped on the desert dunes.  Well the Sheik got Diana and wanted to ""break her"" to his will.  And he did so quite violently (as could be seen in Valentino's face, which, ohmygod, he had done so effectively, but I'll talk about Rudy later..)The one part I really enjoyed was when The Sheik releazed how cruel he was really acting and Rudy's face changed from twisted lust to a look of compassion (it was such a magical part and my mother said ""rewind that part!"" and so we watched it again)The Sheik pivoted Valentino's career into the ""he'll never be forgotten for ever"" mode and really made the 1920's. All the ladies became shebas and the guys sheiks...and everyone from the farm girls to flappers were in love with Rudy.Now there are 2 movies on this DVD and the second is my FAVORITE!! The Son of the Sheik, where Valentino was the son Ahmed and the father from the original picture, was a far better backdrop for Valentino's acting skills.  The special effects were amazing (for that time peroid I mean, today I'd laugh and point and say ha! you must be joking!) in the sense of how the two Valentino's were juxtaposed together (like the part where he has his arm on his other self... creepy cool), it must of cost a fortune to do.  In this picture the younger Ahmed falls passionately (passionately I say because he was very .... well I felt it to be very romantic even for today's standards and back then I'm not sure how the older mama's would have acted to his fevered kisses) with a beautiful dancer of a circus troope.  The young Ahmed is captured by the jealous ""bad guy"" of the troope and is whipped (I really didn't see that coming!) and tied to bars (it was horrible and I was very upset at this point) and then the guy lays a horrendous lie at his already bound feet and WELL I can't tell you that because it is the major conflict of the movie (but it's good and I was upset even more).The DVD has special features.  One includes the ""Valentino Beauty Pageant"" which was creepy but very fasinating for historical reasons. One was a silly skit Valentino did (which made no sense what so ever buuut I did get to see him run around in his bathing suit :Ogasp!) and the last is a short film of the publics reaction to his death (to think there was a report of mass suicides afterwards!)The one thing I really liked about the DVD was the choice of the soundtrack you wanted to use.  It gave you the option of a new sythisized version or the original music they would have used in the theaters (which I personally prefer better). It really adds to the ""Sheik"" experience.Overall (finally!) I really LOVED this DVD collection and LOVE Valentino. Why you may ask?? He's in incredible actor!! His expressions are amazing and very naturally changable... he can smoothly transition expressions in a scene that it puts the topgal to shame and makes her almost invisable.  But (of course) Rudolph Valentino was extremely attractive and wonderfully handsome (see Son of the Sheik where there is a part where his headgear is stripped off and his shirt is opened ohmy!)Valentino was certianly bad for his time and my favorite photograph of all time is by him.... where (in the son of the sheik) he is wearing all black with his hood over his head and a cigarette in between his ringed fingers... glaring...Valentino screams HOTTNESS!!!",5,Rudy is My Valentine - O,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,4176,"['review', 'PD', 'daughter.I', 'was', 'given', 'movie', 'one', 'moms', 'friends', 'am', 'sooo', 'very', 'happy', 'got', 'even', 'was', 'mightily', 'curious', 'what', 'created', 'insane', 'craze', 'obsession', '1920', 'Now', 'know', 'name', 'was', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino.I', 'had', 'read', 'Sheik', 'well', 'condensed', 'version', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'followed', 'original', 'story', 'never', 'less', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'really', 'captured', 'ruthless', 'Spanish-Brit', 'mix', 'desert', 'sheik', 'Sheik', 'Ahmed', 'was', 'cruel', 'seemingly', 'heartless', 'brutal', 'really', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'animal', 'brutality', 'know', 'what', 'mean..', 'stating', 'Arab', 'what', 'What', 'Sheik', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'Diana', 'spoiled', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'aristocratic', 'brit', 'room', 'had', 'snuck', 'switched', 'bullets', 'blanks', 'later', 'kidnapped', 'desert', 'dunes', 'Well', 'Sheik', 'got', 'Diana', 'wanted', 'break', 'will', 'did', 'so', 'quite', 'violently', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Valentino', 'face', 'ohmygod', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'effectively', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'Rudy', 'later..', 'one', 'part', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'when', 'Sheik', 'releazed', 'how', 'cruel', 'was', 'really', 'acting', 'Rudy', 'face', 'changed', 'twisted', 'lust', 'look', 'compassion', 'was', 'such', 'magical', 'part', 'mother', 'said', 'rewind', 'part', 'watched', 'again', 'Sheik', 'pivoted', 'Valentino', 'career', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'ever', 'mode', 'really', 'made', '1920', 'ladies', 'became', 'shebas', 'guys', 'sheiks', 'everyone', 'farm', 'girls', 'flappers', 'were', 'love', 'Rudy.Now', 'are', '2', 'movies', 'DVD', 'second', 'FAVORITE', 'Son', 'Sheik', 'where', 'Valentino', 'was', 'son', 'Ahmed', 'father', 'original', 'picture', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'backdrop', 'Valentino', 'acting', 'skills', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'time', 'peroid', 'mean', 'today', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'point', 'say', 'ha', 'must', 'be', 'joking', 'sense', 'how', 'two', 'Valentino', 'were', 'juxtaposed', 'together', 'part', 'where', 'arm', 'other', 'self', 'creepy', 'cool', 'must', 'cost', 'fortune', 'do', 'picture', 'younger', 'Ahmed', 'passionately', 'passionately', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'felt', 'be', 'very', 'romantic', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'back', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'older', 'mama', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'fevered', 'kisses', 'beautiful', 'dancer', 'circus', 'troope', 'young', 'Ahmed', 'captured', 'jealous', 'bad', 'guy', 'troope', 'whipped', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'tied', 'bars', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'point', 'then', 'guy', 'horrendous', 'lie', 'already', 'bound', 'feet', 'WELL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'major', 'conflict', 'movie', 'good', 'was', 'upset', 'even', 'more', '.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'One', 'Valentino', 'Beauty', 'Pageant', 'was', 'creepy', 'very', 'fasinating', 'historical', 'reasons', 'One', 'was', 'silly', 'skit', 'Valentino', 'did', 'made', 'sense', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'buuut', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'run', 'around', 'bathing', 'suit', 'Ogasp', 'last', 'short', 'film', 'publics', 'reaction', 'death', 'think', 'was', 'report', 'mass', 'suicides', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'DVD', 'was', 'choice', 'soundtrack', 'wanted', 'use', 'gave', 'option', 'new', 'sythisized', 'version', 'original', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'theaters', 'personally', 'prefer', 'better', 'really', 'Sheik', 'experience.Overall', 'finally', 'really', 'LOVED', 'DVD', 'collection', 'LOVE', 'Valentino', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'incredible', 'actor', 'expressions', 'are', 'amazing', 'very', 'naturally', 'changable', 'can', 'smoothly', 'transition', 'expressions', 'scene', 'topgal', 'shame', 'almost', 'invisable', 'course', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino', 'was', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'wonderfully', 'handsome', 'see', 'Son', 'Sheik', 'where', 'part', 'where', 'headgear', 'stripped', 'off', 'shirt', 'opened', 'ohmy', 'Valentino', 'was', 'certianly', 'bad', 'time', 'favorite', 'photograph', 'time', 'where', 'son', 'sheik', 'wearing', 'black', 'hood', 'head', 'cigarette', 'ringed', 'fingers', 'glaring', 'Valentino', 'HOTTNESS']",N/A
