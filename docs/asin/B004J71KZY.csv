I love the approach this director takes on the religious movies he makes, which makes the films entertaining and respectful to the saint or religious topic he shows. Of course there are quite a few parts about this movie that aren't true, but let's face it, how many religious movies out there are 100% true to every fact they portray? Very few. If this movie had shown St.Bakhita in an irreverent manner, then I would have to say don't waste your money on this, BUT TRUST ME IT DOESN'T!

1411383,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B004J71KZY,K. Ostrowski,"[109, 115]","Recently, our current pope, Pope Benedict, saw this movie and said that it was ""beautiful.""  While you'll never find me disagreeing with his holiness on any matter of Catholic Doctrine, or on the beauty of this movie, I don't feel it would be right of me to reccomend it.To start with, I feel I should point out the first and most glaring flaw of this movie; it's about as faithful in depicting the events of Bakhita's life as ""the Neverending Story; Part 2"" was in depicting the events of the second half of the book it was based on.  In fact, I'd say this movie bares much in common with your typical, Hollywood, book-to-movie transition, in that virtually nothing of the original story survives, except the name of the main character.In this movie, Bakhita is kidnapped by slavers when she's young, raised as a slave by a rich, african slave-trader, and kept until rebels attack.  An italian named Federico Marin saves her from the rebels and takes her to Italy as his own slave, where she becomes the nanny of his daughter; Aurora.In reality, the slavers who kidnapped Bakhita was arabs; not africans, and they forced her to convert to Islam when they enslaved her.  She had several ""masters"" in Africa; not one, and the rich italian was her fifth ""master;"" not her second.  Furthermore, his name was Callisto Legnani, not Marin, and she was given by him as a gift to the wife of another man; named Augusto Michieli.  It was Michieli's daughter Alice; not Aurora, who Bakhita became the nanny of, and they didn't spend all their time in Italy.  They went back to the Sudan together for a while.In the movie, Marin lost his wife while she was giving birth to Aurora, and bore an old wound from his loss.  Bakhita eventually ran away from him and sought shelter in a church, where she first learned about Jesus, and was given sanctuary, eventually, by the Canossian sisters.In reality, Michieli and his wife were both alive, and both together, when Bakhita entered their household.  They bought a hotel at Suakin; the largest port of the Sudan at the time, and left to manage it, leaving Bakhita and Alice in the care of the Canossian sisters.In the movie, Bakhita spends a long time in Marin's village, caring for sick people during a smallpox epidemic, in a Mother Theresa-like way.  She's eventually offered a free ride to Venice by Marin, and eventually accepts, once the epidemic is over.  Once there, however, she decides to become a Canossian sister, instead of rejoining Marin and his family.  Marin raises a fuss about it in the courts, but they decide in her favor.In reality, Bakhita spent no time caring for smallpox victims before deciding to become a nun, though there was a legal battle with Michieli, which was eventually decided in her favor.At this point, the movie pretty much ends.  Marin turns over a new leaf, and makes peace with being forced to leave Bakhita behind, which could well have happened to Michieli as well, though we can't know for certain.  In reality, many more things happened to Bakhita while she was a sister, but that's a story for another time.I just don't see the point of changing so much about the life story of such a great person.  I mean, she's already canonized.  This movie's lies can be found out by five minutes on wikipedia, and won't do much to prop up her entry in the anals of hagiography, simply because they are, of course, lies.There's a strong sense that this film made such an effort to reconstruct Bakhita's life out of wholecloth, just so that it could promote the agendas of those who funded its production, though again, I can't prove anything.  I will say, however, that the total removal of the forced Islamic conversion from the movie seems suspiciously like a direct injustice to a very saintly woman, just to ""keep muslims happy.""  Furthermore, there's a scene at the beginning, dwelled on much too strongly throughout the film, in which a witchdoctor proclaims that she's ""lucky,"" almost as though the film was attempting to encourage non-Catholic superstitions.  Lastly, the whole smallpox subplot seems to have been inserted, as if to remind everyone of the church's role in social wellfare.  Problem is, that's not the church's main role.  It's to lead souls to Heaven; not full stomachs.Why did they change the names of so many of the other characters?  I'm not really sure.  Maybe they figured they'd already warped so much of the story that it wouldn't hurt.Now, the question is just this; if it's so unfaithful and disrespectful to the life and history of this great woman, why didn't I hate it?The truth is, the movie really isn't that bad.  I bemoan the changes made, seemingly out of a secular, accomodationist view, but as a fictional story (which, let's be honest here, is what this movie is,) it's actually very touching and inspiring.  It's moving, beautiful and well-paced.  The settings are well-rendered, the costumes are wonderful, and nearly every actor did their job incredibly.  It's a beautiful story about a woman who touches the hearts and souls of those around her, with her gentleness, compassion and faith.At the start of this review, I said that it wouldn't be right to reccomend this movie, but thinking it over again, I don't think that's true.  If you can accept that this movie is just fiction, and take it as such, there's no real harm in watching it, and you might even enjoy it.  Just don't let anyone fool you into thinking it's a biography.",3,Lies and Deceptions...

However, I felt that the story of Saint Bakhita was dramatic in itself and did not need further dramatization, which, this movie does. As mentioned by the previous reviewer, there is a departure from the facts that surrounded Saint Bakhita's life (otherwise knows as artistic license!)The factual accounts are dexterously intertwined with the fiction that differentiating the two, is rather problematic. This could be a blessing in disguise, for there arises a need to gain more knowledge on this remarkable lady which should lead the viewer to study her life in depth.The actress who plays the role of Bakhita does a remarkable job in portraying her. St. Bakhita was known for her charity and kindness to one and all and this is wonderfully portrayed by Fatou Kine Boye. She emits a serenity and peace, so much so, it seems that Bakhita is right in front of you! The African scenes are realistic and beautiful. But the most important aspect of this movie is the unveiling of the ills that have afflicted human kind from the beginning: racism, loneliness, selfishness, hypocrisy, pride, cruelty. And for these ills Bakhita's spirituality and character is the balm, for she repays these with love, meekness, selflessness, humility, charity,understanding i.e. the practice of heroic virtue. This film also carries a pro-life message. Look for it! It is both direct and subtle.There is are very disturbing aspects of racism in this movie, which does make one wince. However, the booklet from Ignatius press which is enclosed states ""..Some scenes in the film exaggerate the mistreatment of Bakhita by the Italians.This, perhaps, is a visual meditation on the evils of racism, using Bakhita's life as a vehicle rather than a destination"".The afore mentioned booklet contains the following:1)Film overview2)Prayer to obtain graces from St.Bakhita3)Biography of St. Josephine Bakhita4)Chronology of the life of the saint5)Sayings of St. Bakhita6)The Canossian sisters7)Two popes on St. Bakhita and8)scene selection.There are also several beautiful pictures of scenes from the film.This movie is in Italian with English and Spanish subtitles and runs for 190 minutes.In addition I also recommend watching the docu-drama 'Two suitcases' for further study.To summarize, I use the words of the Holy Father Benedict XVI ....'A VERY BEAUTIFUL FILM.....'",5,An exalted soul!,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,2446,"['was', 'great', 'eagerness', 'awaited', 'release', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'felt', 'story', 'Saint', 'Bakhita', 'was', 'dramatic', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'further', 'dramatization', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'departure', 'facts', 'surrounded', 'Saint', 'Bakhita', 'life', 'otherwise', 'artistic', 'license', 'factual', 'accounts', 'are', 'dexterously', 'intertwined', 'fiction', 'differentiating', 'two', 'rather', 'problematic', 'could', 'be', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'need', 'gain', 'more', 'knowledge', 'remarkable', 'lady', 'should', 'lead', 'viewer', 'study', 'life', 'depth.The', 'actress', 'who', 'role', 'Bakhita', 'remarkable', 'job', 'portraying', 'St.', 'Bakhita', 'was', 'known', 'charity', 'kindness', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Fatou', 'Kine', 'Boye', 'serenity', 'peace', 'so', 'much', 'Bakhita', 'right', 'front', 'African', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'beautiful', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'movie', 'unveiling', 'ills', 'have', 'afflicted', 'human', 'kind', 'beginning', 'racism', 'loneliness', 'selfishness', 'hypocrisy', 'pride', 'cruelty', 'ills', 'Bakhita', 'spirituality', 'character', 'balm', 'love', 'meekness', 'selflessness', 'humility', 'charity', 'understanding', 'i.e', 'practice', 'heroic', 'virtue', 'film', 'also', 'pro-life', 'message', 'Look', 'direct', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'aspects', 'racism', 'movie', 'make', 'one', 'wince', 'However', 'booklet', 'Ignatius', 'press', 'enclosed', 'states', '..Some', 'scenes', 'film', 'exaggerate', 'mistreatment', 'Bakhita', 'Italians.This', 'perhaps', 'visual', 'meditation', 'evils', 'racism', 'using', 'Bakhita', 'life', 'vehicle', 'rather', 'destination', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'booklet', 'following:1', 'Film', 'overview2', 'Prayer', 'obtain', 'graces', 'St.Bakhita3', 'Biography', 'St.', 'Josephine', 'Bakhita4', 'Chronology', 'life', 'saint5', 'Sayings', 'St.', 'Bakhita6', 'Canossian', 'sisters7', 'Two', 'popes', 'St.', 'Bakhita', 'and8', 'scene', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'beautiful', 'pictures', 'scenes', 'film.This', 'movie', 'Italian', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'runs', '190', 'minutes.In', 'addition', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'docu-drama', ""'Two"", 'suitcases', 'further', 'study.To', 'summarize', 'use', 'words', 'Holy', 'Father', 'Benedict', 'XVI', 'VERY', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'FILM', '..']",N/A

She never seems to let her abusers get the best of her.  Bakhita learns of God, and through her selfless life, grows in sanctity giving all of herself to God.  She is released from captivity and takes her vows as a religious, eventually even climbing to the heights of Sainthood.  This is a very long movie....but it is well worth the watch.  It is a beautiful, stunning, inspirational film.",5,Fantastic Drama,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,804,"['bought', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'kind', '34', 'run', 'mill.', '34', 'Boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'story', 'Bakhita', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'village', 'sold', 'slavery', 'resold', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'enduring', 'much', 'abuse', 'hands', '34', '34', 'torments', 'always', 'humble', 'kind', 'hardworking', 'generous', 'person', 'never', 'let', 'abusers', 'get', 'best', 'Bakhita', 'God', 'selfless', 'life', 'sanctity', 'giving', 'God', 'released', 'captivity', 'vows', 'religious', 'eventually', 'even', 'climbing', 'heights', 'Sainthood', 'very', 'long', 'movie', '.but', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'stunning', 'inspirational', 'film']",N/A

1411395,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B004J71KZY,Thomas Zabiega,"[2, 2]","This is simply a heart-warming, beautiful movie that is not only great for any Catholic, but simply great for anyone to see of any faith.  The theme of the movie is basically that one can love even those who persecute you, mistreat you, and misunderstand you, and that this true love can lead to miracles in both the person who is being persecuted and in those who persecute them.  And that love doesn't end no matter what those persecuting Bakhita do to her.  She loves everyone, even her slave owners to the end and shows absolutely no hatred towards anyone.  No victim mentality in this movie;  Bakhita doesn't cry over herself, over the horrible encounters she has experienced through life, she simply transforms those experiences into even greater compassion.  The performance of Fatou Kine Boye as St. Bakhita is simply Oscar winning (if Oscars still were given to the right movies and actors, which they are not), and Fabio Sartor (known to most people as the Centurion in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"") is stunning as a slave owning, selfish character that Hollywood would make into someone completely evil, but this movie portrays as simply a confused soul who lacks love and therefore cannot love himself.In regards to remarks by K. Ostrowski on this movie from the most popular review on this film:  I understand that a movie like this may have more fiction than fact in how it portrays the life of Saint Bakhita, and I myself prefer accuracy, but if that is the case, we should throw out a lot of great Catholic-themed movies.  For example, ""For Greater Glory""(a simply stunning movie) does not portray accurately the lives of Saint Jose Sanchez del Rio or General Gorostieta and combines two priest-generals into one character.  ""The Agony and the Ecstasy,"" another amazing movie, does not portray Michelangelo and Pope Julius II exactly like they were, nor does ""The Reluctant Saint"" portray the life of Saint Joseph of Cupertino exactly as it happened, nor are any of the excellent Italian Catholic movies released through Saint Ignatius Press completely accurate. And ""Quo Vadis,"" one of the greatest Christian movies ever made, is not very much in step with Henryk Sienkiewicz's great Nobel Prize winning novel by that same name.  This doesn't make any of these movies not worth watching, and I would recommend wholeheartedly every single one of them.  They are all masterpieces and so is ""Bakhita.""  It will simply stun you with its powerful message of love--because the cruelty and prejudice it portrays is part of everyone's life and has never gone away (in fact people are worse today and have less excuse to be since they are better educated and should know better).Also, yes, the people who kidnap Bakhita in this movie are Arabs and K. Ostrowski simply cannot recognize that through lack of knowledge of anthropology.  The Muslims who rule northern Sudan to this day consider themselves to be Arabs, though they are much darker than the Arabs in Syria or Iraq and most people, since they are not familiar with ethnic differences, will not be able to make a distinction. That is why the world couldn't understand the massacre of Africans by Arabs in Darfour (both Muslims), because they both looked black to Westerners.  Yet the Sudanese slave owner of Bakhita and his family have facial features of Arab Sudanese, which are features of a mixed race,including a straight nose, vs. the African Sudanese portrayed in this movie who have more obvious, pure African features.  So, though this movie doesn't portray the issue of Muslim Arabs enslaving pagan Africans, the dress of the slave holders is obviously Arab and associated with Islam.  But the point of the movie is love, not hatred for Muslims or anyone else.  Also, Bakhita having a memento from a witch doctor throughout the movie is not a sign of supporting paganism in the movie.  Catholicism has been wonderful in being able to take certain cultural symbols, often quite pagan, and making them Christian.  For example, the Christmas tree is a symbol of everlasting life given to us by the birth of Christ, yet it is directly descended from the sacred tree cults of the druids of the pre-Christian pagan era in Europe.  Bakhita's necklace simply reminds her of the home she came from, as her only link to freedom, the freedom that she does not actually find in its fullness until she encounters Jesus Christ and His Church.  The Catholic imagery of this movie is unmistakable and there is nothing secular about it.  The priests, the nuns, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice are shown with great nobility and true Christian love.  One feature that impressed me was how it was actually the beauty of Catholic art that brings Bakhita in this movie to the Catholic faith and to her final decision about becoming a nun.  A plain, Protestant church would not have converted Bakhita--it was the stark image of a crucifix and the beauty of a Madonna with Child which bring her to these life changing events.This is a tear-jerker and everyone should enjoy it.  Because of some graphic scenes of violence and cruelty, this movie is not appropriate for small children, though teenagers should be encouraged to see this amazing movie.",5,A captivating movie about
