Some kids shows you enjoy as a kid but when you grow up you look back and ask &#34;why did I watch this?&#34; but this isn't the case.  Fraggle Rock, like many Jim Henson Productions is both entertaining for young children but has enough humour and intelligence to appeal to an adult audience.  It also delivers great morals and lessons which unlike some other children's shows don't come across as (what TV tropes calls:  Anvilicious, morals and lessons so unsubtle you might as well engrave the message into an anvil and drop it on the viewer's head).The special features are really good too.  I like the feature talking about the different &#34;Doc and Sprocket&#34; segments filmed for different countries.  It's an interesting look at how an international co-production works, especially in today's age where everyone seems to want the &#34;original version&#34; and is quick to scream, &#34;It's been re-edited/dubbed!  They've ruined it!&#34;.  I also loved the &#34;All around the world&#34; music video for Travelling Matt, so much I put it on my itunes.",5,brings back memories,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,1157,"['Growing', 'up', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'remember', 'watching', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'CBC', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'kids', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'kid', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'look', 'back', 'ask', '34', 'why', 'did', 'watch', '34', ""n't"", 'case', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'many', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Productions', 'entertaining', 'young', 'children', 'enough', 'humour', 'intelligence', 'appeal', 'adult', 'audience', 'also', 'great', 'morals', 'lessons', 'other', 'children', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'what', 'TV', 'tropes', 'Anvilicious', 'morals', 'lessons', 'so', 'unsubtle', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'engrave', 'message', 'anvil', 'drop', 'viewer', 'head', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'feature', 'talking', 'different', '34', 'Doc', 'Sprocket', '34', 'segments', 'filmed', 'different', 'countries', 'interesting', 'look', 'how', 'international', 'co-production', 'works', 'especially', 'today', 'age', 'where', 'everyone', 'want', '34', 'original', 'version', '34', 'quick', 'scream', '34', 'been', 're-edited/dubbed', ""'ve"", 'ruined', '34', 'also', 'loved', '34', 'world', '34', 'music', 'video', 'Travelling', 'Matt', 'so', 'much', 'put', 'itunes']",Fraggle Rock: Complete Second Season

The spend the first year getting the characters nailed down and figuring things out.  In this case-- it isn't just that.  Saving set the ground rules for the series, Jerry Juhl and the other writers then set out to break a few of them.  The Gorgs no longer appear in almost every episode.  They're still around but they are a lot more episodes with entirely internal conflicts- either amongst where character or the Fraggle Community.  Second- there are episodes without Gobo or Uncle Matt.
