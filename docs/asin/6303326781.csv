Perhaps the characters' design took only a couple hours - or the film's &quot;cute&quot; kids were copied from a box of some obscure off-brand cereal - they are sickeningly cheesy.  The final shots of Manhattan being strangled by these predatory lianas building by building look as a horror film culmination. I do not want to elaborate on the songs and gags - it's all very inferior.I am no big fan of Disney, but at least they have a basic idea of the quality control - I can not remember any obvious flops leaving their assembly line.

I know this movie is intended for toddlers, but I know for a fact if I saw this movie as a kid, I'd have turn it off because it's so blasted cutesy and just plain idiotic.  I mean, take a classic family picture like the Wizard of Oz, and what do you get out of it? It's funny, exciting, and has such clever, whimsical writing that even adults will watch and enjoy it.  And it's got good morals--to believe in yourself and to try not to be unselfish, and caring.  I, myself,  at the age of 30 still love The Wizard of Oz. But this movie is a form of cinematic torture for adults, or at least it should be.  What does it offer? It offers nothing but an hour and a half of smiling, singing, and dancing.  That's it.  And as far as the 'lesson', it tries to tell the importance of having a dream, but it does so in such a convoluted manner, it's preposterous. Not only that, I find it actually a tad bit condescending that this movie offers the same amount of mindless, pandering drivel as an episode of ""Barney and Friends"". Why do adults look down their noses so much at children to think they will watch anything? Look, I'm not saying that a little cuteness is bad for a kid, as long as it's done correctly.  Take Seseme Street(or what used to be Seseme Street before it turned into the Elmo Show), its cute.  But at least something like Sesame Street teaches your kids Math, the Alphabet, counting, equality, and even other languages (I learned how to count 1-10 in Spanish on that). All I can say is, view at your own risk.  I know that parenting skills vary from house to house, all I can say is, if you want to show your kids this, fine. I just wouldn't recommend it.",1,"A Troll in Central Park: OR, Brightly Colored Candy Confections for Kids",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1750,"['.and', 'possible', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'total', 'bomb.Ok', 'look', 'know', 'movie', 'intended', 'toddlers', 'know', 'fact', 'saw', 'movie', 'kid', ""'d"", 'have', 'turn', 'off', 'so', 'blasted', 'cutesy', 'just', 'plain', 'idiotic', 'mean', 'take', 'classic', 'family', 'picture', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'funny', 'exciting', 'such', 'clever', 'whimsical', 'writing', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'got', 'good', 'morals', 'believe', 'try', 'not', 'be', 'unselfish', 'caring', 'age', '30', 'still', 'love', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'movie', 'form', 'cinematic', 'torture', 'adults', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'What', 'offer', 'nothing', 'hour', 'half', 'smiling', 'singing', 'dancing', 'as', 'far', ""'lesson"", 'tell', 'importance', 'having', 'dream', 'so', 'such', 'convoluted', 'manner', 'preposterous', 'Not', 'only', 'find', 'actually', 'tad', 'bit', 'condescending', 'movie', 'same', 'amount', 'mindless', 'pandering', 'drivel', 'episode', 'Barney', 'Friends', 'Why', 'do', 'adults', 'look', 'down', 'noses', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'think', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'Look', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'little', 'cuteness', 'bad', 'kid', 'as', 'long', 'done', 'correctly', 'Take', 'Seseme', 'Street', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Seseme', 'Street', 'turned', 'Elmo', 'Show', 'cute', 'least', 'something', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'teaches', 'kids', 'Math', 'Alphabet', 'counting', 'equality', 'even', 'other', 'languages', 'learned', 'how', 'count', '1-10', 'Spanish', 'can', 'say', 'view', 'own', 'risk', 'know', 'parenting', 'skills', 'vary', 'house', 'house', 'can', 'say', 'want', 'show', 'kids', 'fine', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Troll in Central Park VHS
