This is one of those rare tween movies that appeal to both boys and girls (unlike High School Musical which seems to target girls).  As a parent, I am happy that Disney is making appropriate entertainment for this age group. I think if your kids enjoy ""Hannah Montana"", ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"", and of course, ""Cory in the House"", they will certainly like this movie. I enjoyed this one as much or more than most of the Disney Channel Original Movies.",5,"""This is my FAVORITE movie!!!""",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,550,"['When', 'gave', 'movie', '11', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'said', 'FAVORITE', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'tween', 'movies', 'appeal', 'boys', 'girls', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'target', 'girls', 'parent', 'am', 'happy', 'Disney', 'making', 'appropriate', 'entertainment', 'age', 'group', 'think', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Suite', 'Life', 'Zack', 'Cody', 'course', 'Cory', 'House', 'will', 'certainly', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movies']",Minutemen
1143997,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B0013ND3MK,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[7, 7]","This Disney Channel movie about time travel is really very well made and will hold your attention. 3 high school geeks band together to create a time-travel machine. Initially, one of their first attempts to use it is to buy a lottery ticket that will make them rich. I thought, ""What a snooze; same old story, same old schtick."" However, they are quickly foiled, and decide instead to help geeky kids be popular by preventing the humiliating experiences often thrust upon them by the popular set. There are lessons learned along the way, and our heroes soon find it is best to let life play out the way it is supposed to (cause a big Black Hole is about to swallow up the world due to their time machine). The cast is great (includes Jason Dolley from ""Corey in The House"") and has good chemistry. This movie is ""safe"" for the whole family; great to see a movie that doesn't have to rely on violence, nudity, or profanity. The Director, Lev L. Spiro, seems to have a very good understanding of fun and what makes a light and breezy movie such as this. This DVD also includes a featurette ""The Making of Minutemen,"" which gives you details on how the movie was made (including the stunts and special effects). There is also a music video by Corbin Bleu (""High School Musical"") of the song ""Rung It Back Again."" The usual batch of Disney DVD/Movie previews are also here. The movie is 92 minutes.

Neither were  parents like us, who found the film entertaining with plenty of twists and turns in the tried-and-true time travel genre.Using Disney Channel's trusty ""Archie"" storytelling model, this movie chronicles the adventures of three high school misfits, one of whom finds a way to travel into time just enough to solve problems.  Dolley, whose character in this film is a little more savvy than his ""Newt"" persona, uses the device to become popular and so doing, loses what is really important. Everyone learns a valuable lesson and all is well.Like so many of these films, the young stars benefit from strong support from fine actors including J.P. Manoux, known to prime-time grownups as Henshaw, the cranky surgeon on ""E.R.,"" and to cartoon fans as the voice of Kuzco on ""The Emperor's New School.""There's also a groovy (oh I am sooooo old) music video with the talented Corbin Bleu of ""High School Musical"" and ""Jump In.""",4,Above-average Disney Channel fantasy adventure tween movie,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,1046,"['Jason', 'Dolley', 'fans', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'premiere', 'Minute', 'Men', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'were', 'parents', 'who', 'found', 'film', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'twists', 'turns', 'tried-and-true', 'time', 'travel', 'genre.Using', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'trusty', 'Archie', 'storytelling', 'model', 'movie', 'adventures', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'misfits', 'one', 'whom', 'way', 'travel', 'time', 'just', 'enough', 'solve', 'problems', 'Dolley', 'character', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'savvy', 'Newt', 'persona', 'device', 'become', 'popular', 'so', 'doing', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'Everyone', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'well.Like', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'young', 'stars', 'benefit', 'strong', 'support', 'fine', 'actors', 'including', 'J.P.', 'Manoux', 'known', 'prime-time', 'grownups', 'Henshaw', 'cranky', 'surgeon', 'E.R.', 'cartoon', 'fans', 'voice', 'Kuzco', 'Emperor', 'New', 'School', 'also', 'groovy', 'oh', 'am', 'sooooo', 'old', 'music', 'video', 'talented', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Jump']",Minutemen

1144005,A396ZTRHMSQ1WS,B0013ND3MK,Valerie Rutherford,"[0, 0]","I was always been a huge fan of Disney Channel movies growing up. Understandably, they started to fall a bit off my radar as I got older, and I only watched a couple between 2003 and 2008. I heard about High School Musical and all the hype around it (and later enjoyed it), but this is the movie that pulled me back into the loop.Virgil Fox's embarrassing first day of high school still follows him around into his senior year. He stood up for Charlie Tuttle, the young genius who'd skipped a few grades, leading them both to be dressed as cheerleaders and hung from the school's mascot. Now, they've spent three years eating at the &#34;dork table&#34;, while Charlie does experiments and Virgil misses his middle school friends and tries to figure out a way to be popular like they are.Things get interesting when Charlie discovers a way to time travel. With help from shop class tough guy, Zeke, they build the time machine at school under the guise of a Back to the Future club. Virgil wants to use the time machine to get popular (and rich), but eventually, Charlie convinces him to put time travel to a more selfless use: saving fellow dorks from pranks and humiliation. Equipped with gear from Charlie's obsessed fangirl, Jeanette, the three boys become known as the snowsuit guys. Unfortunately, the vice-principal forms a vendetta against the snowsuit guys for ruining his school replica and upsetting the status-quo, as the typical dorky kids start to get popular - and obnoxious. And then, there's the FBI and co., watching out for suspicious activity.I think Minutemen is a great family movie. Is it wacky and cheesy? Definitely. It brought me back to the days of Genius, one of my very favorite Disney Channel movies. And I was honestly obsessed with this movie for a while. It's great to just have something fun and sweet to watch. Since then, I've paid more attention to Disney Channel movies and found that there's still some magic to be had in this format. I would just really love it if they started releasing more of the older Disney Channel movies.
