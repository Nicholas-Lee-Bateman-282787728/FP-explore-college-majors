743389,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B00008K76R,Brian Camp,"[0, 0]","Despite the title, FIGHT, ZATOICHI, FIGHT (1964) is not a film of violence or action. There are a couple of short, quick bursts of swordplay, with a slightly longer confrontation at the end, but for the most part, Zatoichi, the famed blind Japanese swordsman, takes great pains here to avoid fighting when he can. And it's a better film because of it, thanks to the richer portrait we get of Zatoichi, one of the most appealing and enduring figures of popular Japanese cinema.  The chief reason for Zatoichi's sudden caution is his responsibility for the care of a baby boy after the baby's mother was mistakenly killed by hired swordsmen seeking Zatoichi. As a result, Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) feels morally obligated to travel to the baby's father in Miyagi, a town 60 miles away, and deliver the baby to him. Along the way, he gets help from various people, including a female pickpocket who joins him for a time posing as his wife. When Zatoichi finally locates the baby's father, he's in for a rude surprise.The movie was directed by Kenji Misumi, who directed five other Zatoichi films, as well as four ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" films through which he became associated with a flashier style of action filmmaking, characterized by abundant carnage and delirious, over-the-top violence. This film, however, is shot with austere beauty, with long, uninterrupted takes of character interaction and simple, beautiful compositions utilizing the deep focus photography that was a trademark of the best Japanese films from the 1950s and '60s. Such an approach gives star Katsu the opportunity to focus on his character and bring out sides of him we don't often see in other Zatoichi films, particularly in his scenes with the baby and his encounters with the women he meets.There's a funny scene where Zatoichi hires a prostitute to take care of the baby for the night while he tries to get some sleep, yet he keeps getting up and startling the prostitute in order to check on the baby. Later, we meet Miss Ko (Hizuru Takachiho), the pickpocket, and Zatoichi recruits her to help him with the baby on the final stretch of the trip to Miyagi and agrees to pay her for her trouble provided she doesn't steal anything. They have some interesting arguments along the way, culminating in her threatening to walk out, but then offering to stay with him and join him in raising the baby as their own. These are moments of honest human behavior not usually experienced in a format more likely to be filled with frequent challenges designed to explode into bloodshed. Plus, it helps that the baby is so adorable.If you're a fan of Japanese cinema and enjoy Katsu's portrayals of Zatoichi, you owe it to yourself to see this one. If you watch these films only for the violence, then you may be disappointed. To those viewers, I suggest watching these films for more than just the action. You'll get more out of them that way.",4,"Above-average Zatoichi movie focused on character, not bloodshed",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,2909,"['title', 'FIGHT', 'ZATOICHI', 'FIGHT', '1964', 'not', 'film', 'violence', 'action', 'are', 'couple', 'short', 'quick', 'bursts', 'swordplay', 'slightly', 'longer', 'confrontation', 'end', 'most', 'part', 'Zatoichi', 'famed', 'Japanese', 'swordsman', 'great', 'pains', 'here', 'avoid', 'fighting', 'when', 'can', 'better', 'film', 'thanks', 'richer', 'portrait', 'get', 'Zatoichi', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'enduring', 'figures', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'chief', 'reason', 'Zatoichi', 'sudden', 'caution', 'responsibility', 'care', 'baby', 'boy', 'baby', 'mother', 'was', 'mistakenly', 'killed', 'hired', 'swordsmen', 'seeking', 'Zatoichi', 'result', 'Zatoichi', 'Shintaro', 'Katsu', 'morally', 'obligated', 'travel', 'baby', 'father', 'Miyagi', 'town', '60', 'miles', 'away', 'deliver', 'baby', 'way', 'help', 'various', 'people', 'including', 'female', 'pickpocket', 'who', 'time', 'posing', 'wife', 'When', 'Zatoichi', 'finally', 'baby', 'father', 'rude', 'surprise.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Kenji', 'Misumi', 'who', 'directed', 'five', 'other', 'Zatoichi', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'four', 'Lone', 'Wolf', 'Cub', 'films', 'became', 'associated', 'flashier', 'style', 'action', 'filmmaking', 'characterized', 'abundant', 'carnage', 'delirious', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'film', 'however', 'shot', 'austere', 'beauty', 'long', 'uninterrupted', 'character', 'interaction', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'compositions', 'utilizing', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'was', 'trademark', 'best', 'Japanese', 'films', '1950s', ""'60s"", 'approach', 'star', 'Katsu', 'opportunity', 'focus', 'character', 'bring', 'out', 'sides', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'other', 'Zatoichi', 'films', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'baby', 'encounters', 'women', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Zatoichi', 'prostitute', 'take', 'care', 'baby', 'night', 'get', 'sleep', 'getting', 'up', 'startling', 'prostitute', 'order', 'check', 'baby', 'Later', 'meet', 'Miss', 'Ko', 'Hizuru', 'Takachiho', 'pickpocket', 'Zatoichi', 'help', 'baby', 'final', 'stretch', 'trip', 'Miyagi', 'pay', 'trouble', 'provided', ""n't"", 'steal', 'anything', 'have', 'interesting', 'arguments', 'way', 'culminating', 'threatening', 'walk', 'out', 'then', 'offering', 'stay', 'join', 'raising', 'baby', 'own', 'are', 'moments', 'honest', 'human', 'behavior', 'not', 'usually', 'experienced', 'format', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'filled', 'frequent', 'challenges', 'designed', 'explode', 'bloodshed', 'baby', 'so', 'adorable.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'enjoy', 'Katsu', 'portrayals', 'Zatoichi', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'one', 'watch', 'films', 'only', 'violence', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'viewers', 'suggest', 'watching', 'films', 'more', 'just', 'action', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'way']","Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman, Vol. 8 - Fight, Zatoichi, Fight"

The film begins with a tragedy, [what else is new?] involving Ichi. He takes a ride in a palanquin; however, hearing a woman with a child in dire need of help, he gives her his seat in the palanquin and decides to walk the rest of the way. Unknown to him, a group of assassins is lurking nearby for him. Tragically, they attack the woman in the palanquin thinking that Ichi is inside. Feeling responsible, Ichi sets out to find the father of the infant. All the while these low-life samurai assassins are trailing him.This clan of samurai assassin's tell Ichi that they have never failed a job yet. Little do they know that Zatoichi is no ordinary swordsman. Therefore, Ichi must hurry to his destination and get the baby to his father while eluding the paid killers. These killers have no scruples whatsoever: even trying to kill Ichi when he is changing the baby's diapers. So much for the Bushido code. There are many comical elements thrown in the film in regard to Ichi, the baby and a female pickpocket he teams up with on the road. Meanwhile, the journey Ichi undertakes in locating the father is fraught with peril.When Ichi finally locates the father of the baby, Unosuke. The father denies the baby is his; and even denies the slain woman, Toyo, was his wife. Therefore, what is Ichi to do? Zatoichi has to deal with a  confrontational father, decisions concerning the childs welfare, and the assassins still on his trail. What will become of the father? What about the baby? It all makes for a tragic conclusion. I will let you see for yourself, as this is a terrific Zatoichi episode.
