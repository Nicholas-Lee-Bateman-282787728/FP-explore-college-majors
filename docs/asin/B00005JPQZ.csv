If your a diehard Simpsons fan you probably loved it, or at least like it.Been a Simpsons fan since the beginning. For years as everyone knows there was talk of a full length movie. I read somewhere Matt Groening saying that they were waiting for ""the right story"". For about two years Groening and a small group of the central writters worked on a script and unsatisfied with the results kept throwing it out. During the process Groening and company were concerned with fan expectations as well as how the film would relate to the history of the show. At one point they decided to not worry about all that and instead just make a Simpsons movie that would be a showcase for all the voice actors as well an opportunity for animators to take the animation up a couple levels.Groening said they didn't want the movie to be ""a high-velocity,'Simpsons'-style TV episode"" and that's maybe why it wasn't that funny, imho. They ended up wanting to do a more conventional type story - or as Groening put it ""a real story""- that people could follow easily and be involved with. Obviously they made sure to include many elements that make up the quirky Simpsons universe (which would have been insane not to). They also wanted to get back to some of the earlier episodes. I think the best years aren't the first couple. Honestly I'm not looking to get ""choked up"" when I watch ""The Simpsons"", which is something they wanted us to experience.As for the story they did go with, well, it felt kinda familiar, like I'd almost seen it before. And of coarse we have pretty much seen it all before during the almost twenty year, 400 episode run. What continues to make it funny is the way the same old themes are explored and re-explored. But if we're going to get all sappy and really serious over Homer and Marge's same old problems it's boring at this point. I guess I like ""The Simpsons"" to be ""high-velocity"",'Simpsons'-style TV episode""(s). I like ""Simpsons style"" and love when it is irreverent. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is not as entertaining as most episodes. Some people here use the word ""flat"" to describe the movie and that was my experience too. The show will probably continue to be good.

That's what I kept thinking as the first scenes played out into the remaining four-fifths of 'The Simpson's Movie'.  Wisely, I took the advice of fellow reviewer, Chris Pandolfi*, who shared that 'The Simpson's Movie' is meant for the big screen.  He's right.  That transformation happens, though, with more than the animation.There are many advantages to seeing this movie in addition to episodes in the series.  First starting off with the slapstick elements since 'The Simpsons' was an animated short on 'The Tracy Ulman Show,'  the series went from a witty dysfunctional family sitcom to a full-blown satire.  The same evolution occurs within the movie.Bart and Homer start fixing the roof with the same ""Doh's"" and needling cut down humor.  Later, Homer's selfish buffoonery gets him into all kinds of trouble when he acquires a pig pet and dispenses its waste in Lake Springfield, reversing all the civic initiatives that put their town on the map for its environmental turnaround.  Turning the tide again, President Schwartenegger zeroes in on Homer's disaster and domes off the toxic town.  With implications of economic and environmental disaster, the citizens turn on Homer with clubs and torches reminiscent of a 'Frankenstein' movie.Homer the louse drags his family to Alaska, where he means to hide from his quarantined kinsfolk.  Stuck in a cabin, we get an excellent parody of Disney, dispensed before 'Enchanted,' and a Marge who's at the end of her patience.  Homer, who has disenfranchised all, must prove himself semi-decent enough to return home and mend fences for his family and friends.Distinctively, `The..Movie' showcases the Simpsons as sharp and slick as ever.  Drawing upon the best aspects of the show, they remain true to their sense of humor with a story that is focused and funny.  Hardly ever disappointing, `The...Movie' should be put in the same category as `Knocked Up' and `Superbad' as one of the funniest movies of the year.(*I recommend Chris's review if you're looking for something longer and more insightful.)",4,The Bigger Picture,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2192,"['scene', ""'The"", 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'ventures', 'wreckage', 'tornado', 'technicolor', 'world', 'enchantment', 'what', 'kept', 'thinking', 'first', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'remaining', 'four-fifths', ""'The"", 'Simpson', 'Movie', 'Wisely', 'took', 'advice', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Chris', 'Pandolfi*', 'who', 'shared', ""'The"", 'Simpson', 'Movie', 'meant', 'big', 'screen', 'right', 'transformation', 'though', 'more', 'are', 'many', 'advantages', 'seeing', 'movie', 'addition', 'episodes', 'series', 'First', 'starting', 'off', 'slapstick', 'elements', ""'The"", 'Simpsons', 'was', 'animated', 'short', ""'The"", 'Tracy', 'Ulman', 'Show', 'series', 'went', 'witty', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'sitcom', 'full-blown', 'satire', 'same', 'evolution', 'movie.Bart', 'Homer', 'start', 'fixing', 'roof', 'same', 'Doh', 'needling', 'cut', 'down', 'humor', 'Later', 'Homer', 'selfish', 'buffoonery', 'kinds', 'trouble', 'when', 'pig', 'pet', 'waste', 'Lake', 'Springfield', 'reversing', 'civic', 'initiatives', 'put', 'town', 'map', 'environmental', 'turnaround', 'Turning', 'tide', 'again', 'President', 'Schwartenegger', 'Homer', 'disaster', 'off', 'toxic', 'town', 'implications', 'economic', 'environmental', 'disaster', 'citizens', 'turn', 'Homer', 'clubs', 'torches', 'reminiscent', ""'Frankenstein"", 'movie.Homer', 'louse', 'family', 'Alaska', 'where', 'hide', 'quarantined', 'kinsfolk', 'Stuck', 'cabin', 'get', 'excellent', 'parody', 'Disney', 'dispensed', ""'Enchanted"", 'Marge', 'who', 'end', 'patience', 'Homer', 'who', 'disenfranchised', 'must', 'prove', 'semi-decent', 'enough', 'return', 'home', 'mend', 'fences', 'family', 'friends.Distinctively', 'The..Movie', 'Simpsons', 'sharp', 'slick', 'ever', 'Drawing', 'best', 'aspects', 'show', 'remain', 'true', 'sense', 'humor', 'story', 'focused', 'funny', 'Hardly', 'ever', 'disappointing', 'Movie', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'same', 'category', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'year', '*I', 'recommend', 'Chris', 'review', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'longer', 'more', 'insightful']",N/A

I have been watching The Simpsons since The Tracy Ullman Show.  Twenty years and counting.  The series has had it's highs and lows.  The formula still remains consistent.  What I can't understand is how people love to criticize this show and now movie.  I will lay it out for you.  Should you watch this movie or not and why you should watch it.The Simpsons Movie begins like so many of their shows.  The starting is never where it will go.  Plot twists are all part of the scenario.  First off for those who aren't familiar with Bart Simpson, where have you been the past twenty years?  The movie won't get to involved in the characters lives which is great.  Keeping the story funny and simple is what it's all about.Generally you get a feeling that this movie is trying to send a message.  A message about pollution and the environment that could only be done Simpsons style.  Since that is only one of the many messages that comes from this movie.  Family and community are important elements as they always are.  What makes The Simpsons great is they are never preachy.So who should and shouldn't watch this movie:1. If you are a Simpsons fan this is a definate yes.2. If you don't know who The Simpsons are then probably forget it.3. If you are looking for Oscar material forget it.4. If you laugh at everything then go for it.I have viewed this movie on Blu-ray and I must say stick to the DVD version.

I can understand fans who have been anticipating this for the years it took to get made, but I think the direction of the show should've been enough indication of how bad this movie would be. So, to let those of you who haven't seen the movie and don't watch the show know, the show is now an unfunny and scattered mess of creativity. There is no unifying vision except for the fact that episodes revolve around the characters we know by heart.  The last time I watched a new Simpsons episode I was shocked at how strange and unfunny the content of it was which shocked me because I like strange and absurd humor.  This show used to contain all types of it until the last few years of the show. This movie is just like the show except without the unfunny strangeness. Let me make one exception: the time when they go to Alaska is bizarre in a way that could've been funny, by isn't. The rest of the movie is chocked full of jokes that work, have never been funny, or attempts at humor that just aren't successful, like telling a poop joke just for the sake of telling it without regard to the relevance of the story and that's what this is.  The good jokes are good, but are stuck in the midst of a mass of other jokes that never were and shouldn't have been used for this film. It makes the whole thing lukewarm and boring. I must say that I have really enjoyed the Simpsons in various times of their existence, the times when they were rude and funny, when they were just dysfunctional and character driven, the times of sharpest wit and genre to the absurd humor.  In my mind, the Simpsons were the popular heel of American animation and became the forefront. As a result of this transistion they were forced to grow up and experiment and have now gotten away from what made them unique in any of their phases. They need to give it a rest and let the fans watch their DVD's, or the reruns.  This is just sad and I don't see it ever turning around.

With more than 400 TV shows in a wonderfully successful series, why risk it?  Indeed!  But risk it they did and the outcome is one truly brilliant film!This movie is clever, razor sharp and moves at a cracking pace.  The humour works on two levels; one level for the kids and a separate level for adults.  And this is part of the reason for its success.  Both adults and children can enjoy the show.  When was the last time that Hollywood pulled of this stunt?By now, many or perhaps most will have heard the basic plot.  However, if you haven't seen the film, don't let this knowledge discourage you.  Having to pay the price of admission rather than just watch it for free on TV is no big deal.

655285,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,B00005JPQZ,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[3, 6]","Have to tell you I was concerned about this movie. For those old enough to remember, when the Simpsons first aired 18 years ago the humor was a lot more risque, more in-your-face ""potty-mouth."" As the show grew and matured the humor, while still bordering on the ""potty"" style, didn't depend on it, and because of the move to be more subtle became much funnier. So when I heard that they were making a film I wondered if the writers would revert back to the in-your-face style of humor.I didn't have to worry. Although there were a few questionable scenes (the naked skateboard ride to name one) in most cases we were treated to a classic Simpson episode, just extended. The dry wit was exceptional, all your favorite characters had their moment, and the plot, although typically campy, fit perfectly. I can not say enough about the writing. And for once, the best and funniest scenes were not in the previews and TV commercials. Of course every one in the theater was waiting for the Spiderpig scene and all cheered when it appeared. Loved the variations of the Spiderpig theme that popped up occasionally.To even attempt to describe the plot would not even come close to doing it justice so I won't. But be assured that if you are a Simpson fan you will not be disappointed. And, by the way, hang around through the credits. A couple of extra scenes are included that are a hoot.I would recommend this to most families, although again there are a couple of parts that pushed the envelope of good taste.

When I heard that a movie was coming out about TV's favorite family I was both excited that the crew finally got around to doing one but also skeptical as to what took so long.

However, I can't deny the nagging feeling that it isn't epic-enough to escape the long-episode perception. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and recommend it to fans of the Simpsons or animated comedy in general, but I think a better movie could've been produced had it been done around seasons 5-7; when the hands down best episodes were being written, though the animation wouldn't have been as good so it would be a trade-off.",4,What took so long?,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,827,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Simpsons', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'beginning', 'show', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'TV', 'favorite', 'family', 'was', 'excited', 'crew', 'finally', 'got', 'doing', 'one', 'also', 'skeptical', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'now', 'not', 'long', 'show', 'aired', '500th', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', 'movie', 'ten', 'times', 'still', 'pleasure', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'nagging', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'epic-enough', 'escape', 'long-episode', 'perception', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'loved', 'movie', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Simpsons', 'animated', 'comedy', 'general', 'think', 'better', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'produced', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'seasons', '5-7', 'when', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'episodes', 'were', 'being', 'written', 'animation', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'trade-off']",N/A

In lieu of biting satire or outright brilliance, the writing frequently devolves into a parade of dumb grossout jokes and simplistically mean-spirited humor, usually at Homer's expense, making the show seem at times what it studiously avoided being in its early years: an animated version of ""Married With Children."" It has its moments, and it's still usually better than most other network fare, but it ain't quite what it used to be.The first ""Simpsons"" movie is okay, but it also continues in this vein, with Homer reduced to a dundering, ill-tempered simpleton, and the other characters all safely in their niches as well. Bart, in particular, seemed underused (though his nude scene was brilliant). The sad fact is I only laughed out loud twice while watching this flick... I snickered once, twisted the corner of my mouth into a wry smile six or seven times, and saw it all coming a mile away.  Of course, that's about the same batting average of a typical new episode of the TV show, so I suppose it was up to the current standards -- I had expected more, though.I admit, I should have seen this one in the theaters -- you can tell, even on TV, how many of the gags are made with a live, moviehouse audience in mind: with a room full of Comic Book Guys to guide you, you'll be brought to laughter, and will be able to share the communal experience.  The many self-referential, ""hey-we're-making-a-movie!"" jokes doubtless play better on the big screen, but that being so, you also can't help but wonder why the writers chose to limit the movies appeal to such a great degree.  This doesn't really play well as a home movie, even though that's how most people, ultimately, will experience it -- the script isn't as sharp as it should have been, and the compensatory visual humor doesn't translate well on TV.  It's not a total bust, and though it will mostly appeal to diehard fans, we normals can enjoy it as well.

655290,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JPQZ,B. E Jackson,"[2, 4]","I'm going to start off this review by stating something right away- it is NOT true that the Simpsons movie is nothing but one Homer painful gag after another (such as being electrocuted, stabbed, whatever).  Sure, it happens, but it's not for the majority of time.There's a well told story taking place with plenty of solid jokes.  PLENTY of jokes for people who love the TV show.  I'm really surprised at the quality of the story-telling and the careful creativity that was involved when making the jokes.  Well done.Sure, there's sometimes a certain amount of calmness to allow time to build up the storyline, but that's a good thing because a movie is supposed to have a detailed and exciting story in order to stand tall.The animation is of course, absolutely brilliant.  Very colorful, and beautifully well done animation.  Just like the TV show.The only bad parts are that not every single person from the town of Springfield that we've grown to love over the years made an appearance.  Some of them didn't say anything at all.  Here's the list of characters and how often they appeared in the movie-Abe Simpson- appeared quite often, which is surprising considering lately on the TV show we haven't been seeing him as often compared to the older days when he'd frequently have his own episodes.  He was pretty funny.Agnes Skinner- didn't appear at all.  Didn't see her anywhere.Apu- disappointing he only said one or two lines and that was IT.  He deserved more time in the movie than that.Arnie Pie- didn't appear at all.Artie Ziff- didn't appear at all.Barney- appeared a few times, and was quite funny.Bart Simpson- obviously, he took up a majority of the film.  He was absolutely great too.The Bumblebee Man- he actually appeared during a scene on TV.Carl- appeared a couple times.Chief Wiggum- appeared the appropriate amount of times, and had a couple funny lines.Cletus- only appeared twice.  When he appeared, I was laughing hard though.The Comic Book Guy- appeared a few times and didn't deserve it, in my opinion.  He's not that great of a character.Cookie Kwan- thank God she didn't appear.The Crazy Cat Lady- appeared a few times, and was great.  I don't get all the hatred for her character from the TV show.Disco Stu- you know, I don't remember seeing him anywhere.Dolph- yeah, I think.Drederick Tatum- yup, in one scene.Dr. Hibbert- yup, in one or two scenes.  Didn't speak much though, which is REALLY a shame.Dr. Nick Riviera- yup, he appeared once in a funny scene.Duffman- nowhere to be seen.Edna Krabappel- VERY disappointed that she appeared once or twice, but didn't speak at all.Fat Tony- appeared once, and had one funny line.Gil- didn't appear at all.  Surprised.Groundskeeper Willie- I don't think he appeared at all either.  REALLY surprised.Hans Moleman- appeared briefly.Helen Lovejoy- nope, not that I remember.Homer Simpson- you better BELIEVE he appeared quite often!  He appeared more than any other character which makes perfect sense, doesn't it?Itchy- yup, in the beginningJasper- nope, nowhereJimbo- yup, for one or two scenes.Judge Harm- nope, absolutely nowhere.Judge Snyder- once again, not in the movie.Kang- absent.Kearney- yup, briefly.Kent Brockman- yeah, pretty often.  Pretty funny.Kirk Van Houten- not anywhere.Kodos- absent.Krusty the Clown- appeared for one or two segments.  He could have been funnier.The Lawyer- nowhere.Lenny- yeah, appeared a few times.  Very funny when he appeared.Lindsay Naegle- nowhere.Lisa Simpson- oh yeah, but not as much as you'd probably expect.Lou- yeah, appeared a couple times.  Sort of funny.Luann Van Houten- nope, nowhere.Luigi Re Soto- appeared nowhere.Maggie Simpson- you better believe it!  Very adorable baby too.Manjula- wasn't in the movie.Marge Simpson- yup, quite regularly.Martin- appeared a few timesMaude Flanders- ha!  No.Mayor Quimby- appeared once or twice.Milhouse- appeared once or twice.  Wasn't funny.Miss Hoover- appeared, but didn't say anything.Moe- appeared quite often.  Very funny when he talked.Mona J. Simpson- I thought *maybe* she'd appear, but no.Mr. Burns- surprisingly, appeared only two or three times.  Wasn't funny either.Mr. Teeny- nope.  Well unless you count that one scene where Homer was picturing a monkey that resembled Mr. Teeny.  Otherwise, no.Ned Flanders- appeared regularly.  Very funny and very calm.Nelson- appeared a few times.  He was hysterical like always.Otto- appeared once or twice with only one funny line.Patty- I can't remember her being in the movie.Principal Seymour Skinner- only appeared once but didn't say anything.  Shocking indeed.Professor Frink- had a few funny lines.Rainier Wolfcastle- I think he was there.Ralph Wiggum- appeared once or twice and was funny.Reverend Lovejoy- appeared a couple times and was sort of funny.  He's usually really funny, though.The Rich Texan- wasn't in the film.Rod and Todd Flanders- both appeared often.Santa's Little Helper- appeared two or three times but didn't do anything really interesting.Sarah Wiggum- didn't appear.The Sarcastic Salesman- didn't appear in the movie.Scratchy- appeared in the very beginning.The Sea Captain- appeared, but didn't say anything.Selma- I can't remember seeing her in the movie at all.Sherri and Terri- nowhere at all.Sideshow Bob- nope, unfortunately.  Wasn't anywhere in the film.Siedshow Mel- yeah, a few times.Snake- nope, he wasn't around for some reason.  Disappointing.  He must have been off robbing someone.Snowball- nowhere.The Squeaky Voiced Teen- appeared at the end during the credits.Superintendent Chalmers- nope, he was nowhere to be found.Uter- not in the movie.Waylon Smithers- appeared when Mr. Burns appeared, which is only a few times.  Didn't say anything worthwhile.The ""Yes"" Guy- thank goodness he wasn't around.Also, they could have had more locations such as inside Bart and Lisa's school inside, the hospital, and inside Apu's store.  Instead, it was mostly about Moe's bar, the town church and the Simpsons house/back yard.  The majority of locations took place outside either in Springfield, the town lake, or Alaska (you'll find out why when you see the movie).  Only one or two scenes involving Burns mansion as well.Otherwise, the movie was really great.  One thing that surprised me was hearing Marge and Ned Flanders talk in a mellow voice, that almost totally changed the sound of their voices.  You'll hear these voices during a few segments.  It looks like I'm disappointed but I'm actually surprised the quality of humor, the story-telling, and everything else was very good overall.",5,Simpsons brilliance!!!!!,1199491200,"01 5,

655296,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005JPQZ,Bookphile,"[11, 16]","I used to be a very passionate Simpsons fan but the show kind of lost me and this movie made me realize why: it's been done.  I would certainly say that The Simpsons has been one of the most subversive, one of the most clever, and one of the most entertaining shows in television history.  Still, it is inevitable that any show, no matter how good, will reach saturation point and I feel this is the case with The Simpsons.  There's really nothing in this movie that hasn't been seen before--with the exception of Spiderpig.  And I agree with the reviewer who said you won't get that song out of your head--you won't.The plot of the movie centers around an act of heinous stupidity committed by Homer that causes Springfield to be encased in a dome from which only the Simpson family is able to escape thanks to a handy sinkhole that Homer has failed to fix.  Homer is normally my favorite character but I felt he crossed the line too much in this movie.  Usually his problems stem from his stupidity but in this case he was fully aware that what he was doing was spectacularly wrong.  I was also bothered by the truly cavalier way in which he treats his family after the town starts baying for Homer's blood.  That Homer is insensitive and self-centered is undeniable but the show usually does a good job of showing that he does have some genuine goodness.  This movie, however, does not.  In fact, he is downright callous and I found myself truly disliking Homer, so much so that I did not want the rest of the family to reconcile with him.There were some good points of the movie, though.  Lisa finding her perfect mate was definitely a highlight and the animation was really fun to look at, particularly the scenic views of Alaska.  Bart's new take on the Flanders family was amusing, though Ned didn't seem quite as colorful to me as he usually is.  I also really enjoyed the crowd shots as they caused me to marvel at the seemingly endless number of vivid characters that have populated the series throughout its run.

Most comedies really need to be 90 minutes or less to keep from collapsing under their own weight, and the producers of this one manage to hold the movie under that magic number - no small feat given the sheer number of characters and plots that could have been explored.

655301,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPQZ,Caleb Williams,"[2, 4]","This film was bound to get mixed thoughts and reviews from those who were fans of old and hate the new generation Simpsons. After about Season 10 the simpsons simply slid into comic oblivion as most episodes simply lost that making fun of popculture intelligence that made it famous. One reason as to why the Simpsons series may have lost its comic touch is the loss of what could be argued as its best writers like Mike Reiss. Or the loss of its early years producers like John Swartzwelder or Jon Viti. These returned to add their classic touch to this movie and it's blatantly obvious that they played a massive part in this film.To be honest all the blame can be issued out to anyone about the slow and painful downfall of the Simpsons series, but it's simply something that was inevitable. When you have a series that runs as long as the Simpsons, it's bound to take a slide. The Movie, however, picks up were around season 10 left off when it comes to comedic intelligence or satiring pop culture. This movies hot topic is the environment and how hysterical some people have become over the whole issue.Most TV series such as the Family Guy Movie could be described as just 2 or 3 episodes planted together, and that was certainly the expectation when I first went into watching this film. I was very much surprised to see that it was nothing of the sort, it was as if it had started from scratch and gave us a true feature length movie that carried smoothly from start to finish. This left no stone un-turned when it came to making a mockery, politics, celebrities, the environment, religion, everything was made fun of in one way or another, in this movie and it was truly something that made me reminisce about the good ol' days.The animation has obviously received an upgrade, much like every other TV to Movie cartoon series as it seems to be a healthy mixture of both CG and conventional animation. I honestly wish this was just something they could incorporate into the series as it would make it look a whole lot better. The voice acting is the typical great voice acting that we've come to expect from the Simpsons cast, adding on a few cameos of Green Day and Tom Hanks as the typical celebrity inclusion. I'm actually surprised they never had more of a celebrity influence in the movie considering they have a celeb in almost every episode. I would have enjoyed a cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger as President Schwarzenegger.The story is quite zaney and does what the original Simpsons did best and that's take an unreal story and have each character become included in their own way that perfectly matches their classic personality. Homer is obviously the catalyst that leads to the whole town buying for his blood. Lisa is obviously the morale side of the family trying to keep it all together alongside Marge. Bart also is the typical troublemaker of the movie who doesn't really care, but in the end wants to help out if he can.I honestly loved this film and it was surprising how witty and nostalgic it became. These writers & producers from the old days of the series, who returned for this movie, should be brought back again for the series as you could genuinely see the difference in the writing and production when you compare it to the show with the usual writers of the current series'.",5,If Only I Could Give It 10,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3315,"['film', 'was', 'bound', 'get', 'mixed', 'thoughts', 'reviews', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'old', 'hate', 'new', 'generation', 'Simpsons', 'Season', '10', 'simpsons', 'simply', 'slid', 'comic', 'oblivion', 'most', 'episodes', 'simply', 'lost', 'making', 'fun', 'popculture', 'intelligence', 'made', 'famous', 'One', 'reason', 'why', 'Simpsons', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'comic', 'touch', 'loss', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'best', 'writers', 'Mike', 'Reiss', 'loss', 'early', 'years', 'producers', 'John', 'Swartzwelder', 'Jon', 'Viti', 'returned', 'add', 'classic', 'touch', 'movie', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'played', 'massive', 'part', 'film.To', 'be', 'honest', 'blame', 'can', 'be', 'issued', 'out', 'anyone', 'slow', 'painful', 'downfall', 'Simpsons', 'series', 'simply', 'something', 'was', 'inevitable', 'When', 'have', 'series', 'as', 'long', 'Simpsons', 'bound', 'take', 'slide', 'Movie', 'however', 'up', 'were', 'season', '10', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'comedic', 'intelligence', 'satiring', 'pop', 'culture', 'movies', 'hot', 'topic', 'environment', 'how', 'hysterical', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'whole', 'issue.Most', 'TV', 'series', 'such', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'just', '2', '3', 'episodes', 'planted', 'together', 'was', 'certainly', 'expectation', 'when', 'first', 'went', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'surprised', 'see', 'was', 'nothing', 'sort', 'was', 'had', 'started', 'scratch', 'gave', 'true', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'carried', 'smoothly', 'start', 'finish', 'left', 'stone', 'un-turned', 'when', 'came', 'making', 'mockery', 'politics', 'celebrities', 'environment', 'religion', 'everything', 'was', 'made', 'fun', 'one', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'something', 'made', 'reminisce', 'good', 'ol', 'days.The', 'animation', 'obviously', 'received', 'upgrade', 'much', 'other', 'TV', 'Movie', 'cartoon', 'series', 'be', 'healthy', 'mixture', 'CG', 'conventional', 'animation', 'honestly', 'wish', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'could', 'incorporate', 'series', 'would', 'make', 'look', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'voice', 'acting', 'typical', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Simpsons', 'cast', 'adding', 'few', 'cameos', 'Green', 'Day', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'typical', 'celebrity', 'inclusion', ""'m"", 'actually', 'surprised', 'never', 'had', 'more', 'celebrity', 'influence', 'movie', 'considering', 'have', 'celeb', 'almost', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'cameo', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'President', 'Schwarzenegger.The', 'story', 'quite', 'zaney', 'what', 'original', 'Simpsons', 'did', 'best', 'take', 'unreal', 'story', 'have', 'character', 'become', 'included', 'own', 'way', 'perfectly', 'classic', 'personality', 'Homer', 'obviously', 'catalyst', 'whole', 'town', 'buying', 'blood', 'Lisa', 'obviously', 'morale', 'side', 'family', 'trying', 'keep', 'together', 'alongside', 'Marge', 'Bart', 'also', 'typical', 'troublemaker', 'movie', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'end', 'help', 'out', 'honestly', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'surprising', 'how', 'witty', 'nostalgic', 'became', 'writers', 'producers', 'old', 'days', 'series', 'who', 'returned', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'again', 'series', 'could', 'genuinely', 'see', 'difference', 'writing', 'production', 'when', 'compare', 'show', 'usual', 'writers', 'current', 'series']",N/A

I just wanted to point out at an interview Matt Groening gave, probably to prepare the release of the movie. He said kind of proudly his staff of writers right now grew up watching The Simpsons. And that's the key to understand such a phenomenal low in the history of the show: The first writers actually grew up NOT watching The Simpsons, but watching decades of good and bad American TV. They grew up watching Hitchcock, Kubrick, Bu&ntilde;uel, Hieronymus Bosch, Picasso, ""Tron"" and every conceivable movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. Oh, and reading, yes, comic books, but also Poe, The Bible or Stephen King.... And not just watching The Simpsons. Or Family Guy. These days the difference hardly matters, except that Family Guy is less patronizing. The rest is just cheap excuses: This is a bad show an hour too long with the visual muscle of Futurama. And it just proves you can have all the firepower in the world, but it takes good work to make a good movie. If you still think it's a good idea to buy an animated feature to watch with the family, go get Isao Takahata's ""My neighbors the Yamadas"". That way you'll also get a cultural reference The Simpsons will never give you. Why two stars and not just one? Well, I actually liked the Spider Pig Song, so there's a star for Mr. Paul Francis Webster and H.

Just like the show, The Simpsons family explores a new concept in every show, and in the movie it is no different. You get to see every character that was in the show make a brief 20 second appearance in the movie.

655308,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPQZ,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 3]","What can be said about a film adaptation of a long running, funny, satirical, and overall brilliant television series like ""The Simpsons""? As with most such adaptations, plenty can be said about how one format is superior to the other; some may feel that the silver screen can tell a better story, while others may feel that a TV series should remain on TV. I have no doubt that both arguments can be made in the case of ""The Simpsons Movie,"" a film that many devoted fans--myself included--have been longing for since its 1989 television premier (I'm exempting the shorts appearing on ""The Tracy Ullman Show""). There's no question that this is a funny movie, filled to the brim with biting wit, physical gags, and inside jokes aimed mostly at the Fox Network and the American government. I laughed out loud more than once, and I happily applauded when the end credits started to roll. It's definitely a lot of fun.The biggest drawback, I think, is that the intimacy associated with watching the show at home is lost. The filmmakers took great pains to craft a ""Simpsons"" storyline that was both big enough for theatrical release and different enough to be unsuitable for TV. I mean this in more ways than one; let's just say that it's rated PG-13 for a reason. I can't say whether or not such changes will live up to everyone's expectations. I know that it generally worked for me, despite the story occasionally being too big for its own good. I owe most of my amusement to the over the top yet intelligent sense of humor, a ""Simpsons"" staple for nearly twenty years. It helped that the ad campaign kept the plot tightly under wraps; I was able to view the film without any preconceived notions, and because of that, the jokes were even funnier.I'm compelled to be just as secretive, which is odd, considering how I always include a thorough plot summary in my reviews. But I have a feeling that I'm supposed to keep my mouth shut in this case. It's much like watching the show: you have no real idea what you'll see until the episode airs. Indeed, the film's plot is very similar to a television episode--the only difference is that it's on a larger scale. I will say that, because of Homer Simpson's stupidity (and this should not surprise anyone), the entire family will go on their biggest adventure yet. On the way, they will be chased by angry mobs, hunted by the American government, and forced to relocate to the snowy mountains of Alaska. They will also have to save their beloved hometown of Springfield from certain destruction.If you don't appreciate my vagueness, then I'm sorry. Not that it matters a great deal; ""The Simpsons Movie"" exists in part to appease diehard fans of the TV series, for who plot matters little. It's more about the intentional goofiness, the sheer delight in knowing that, at some point, someone is going to do something funny. We get an example of this as soon as the Twentieth Century Fox logo appears on screen; Ralph Wiggum stands within the gigantic zero, innocently singing along to Alfred Newman's triumphant fanfare. This is, we soon discover, but one level of comedic awareness; soon afterwards, Homer sits in a movie theater, saying that he paid good money to see something he could have seen at home for free. The film has a knack for pointing at itself and laughing, as if to say, ""We know this is a movie, and we want you to know that we know."" Sure, it's a little distracting at times, but you still have to give the filmmakers credit. Few would have the guts to do this.The film also exists as a showcase, with virtually every character from the show included at some point. Whether it's angry figures like Moe Szyslak, Krusty the Clown, and C. Montgomery Burns, disciplinary figures like Seymour Skinner and Chief Wiggum, or odd personality figures like Kent Brockman, Otto, and Ned Flanders, every character adds something to this film, if only for a moment (not much time can be given if your film is less than ninety minutes long). Of course, no one is featured more prominently than the title family, the hilariously dysfunctional Simpsons. We delight in Homer's idiocy just as much as we delight in Marge's fretfulness, Bart's underachievement, Lisa's youthful passion, and Maggie's hidden intelligence. The TV show has taught us to expect all this, which is both good and bad as far as the movie is concerned. On the one hand, their comedic personalities are prominently featured. On the other hand, they're eventually overshadowed by some genuinely touching moments. I can't say I was prepared for them.Nonetheless, this is a film that definitely gets the job done, for fans and non-fans alike. You can't help but admire the work that went into ""The Simpsons Movie,"" especially in terms of the voice work. Dan Castellaneta, Juile Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Marcia Wallace, Tress MacNeille, and Pamela Hayden give (and have already given) everything they've got for their characters. When special guest voices such as Albert Brooks, Tom Hanks, and Billie Joe Armstrong are factored in, a fun time is definitely waiting to be had. This is true even if the television format is preferred. But regardless of the format--be it television or theatrical--""The Simpsons"" will always be entertaining.",4,Mmm ...

655309,AN9J46667D80O,B00005JPQZ,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","""The Simpsons Movie"" plays out like a large-scale, decent episode of the show. It's not in the same category as the best episodes, but far from the worst. It is, in it's way, entirely acceptable.The movie centers around a bizarre series of events that results in the Simpsons being attacked by an angry mob after the city is covered by a giant dome (""Peasants Under Glass"" as the Springfield news broadcast puts it in a deleted scene).There's some decent comedic gold to be mined in this plot idea, and a lot of it does work, but the best moments of the show come before they leave town and end up in Alaska. The film moves at a decent place, but kind of slows down at that point.Really, the fact the movie takes the characters out of Springfield is somewhat to its detriment. We got to see some of Otto, Moe, Apu, Krusty, Sideshow Mel, Cheif Wiggum, Mayor Qumiby, Comic-Book Guy, Professor Frink, Edna Crabappel, Superintendent Chalmers, Fat Tony, Principal Skinner, Patty, Selma, Mister Burns, Smithers, and Groundskeeper Willie, but not enough. Of course, given how large that list is, I don't know that they could have ever included enough screen time for each character, but moving the film out of Springfield didn't help.Also for the life of me I don't know why this film was rated PG-13. Yes, Marge says something vaguely naughty. Yes, Homer flips the bird. Yes, Otto smokes some weed. Yes, we see Bart's penis. But still. In other countries this all would get it the equivilant of a PG rating, but not here. Not in the country that experiences the ""Terror of Janet Jackson's Nipple"", or the ""Crisis of Brittney Spears' Sister Getting Pregnant!"" Ah, America. The most liscentious society since Rome, and the most puritanical ever...The DVD extras are pretty nice. I haven't heard the commentary yet, but the deleted scenes were good and, for the most part, should have been left in. I'm assuming they had some pretty tight time restrictions, but still.Ultimately I recommend the film. It has great animation, an alright story line and some very, very funny moments (I never really wanted to see Bart's penis, but having seen it, I can say that it was a funny thing to behold). The voice acting is top-notch, as always, and, well, basically it's like an episode of the TV show only bigger, longer and uncut (as it were). For what it is, it's pretty darn good and far better than much of the dreck out there on DVD (including Seasons 3, 5 and 6 of ""The Dreck Squad"". It really went downhill after that...

655312,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPQZ,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","When the Simpsons movie was finally given the go-ahead, many people were either anxiously anticipating it or wanting to watch it with a feeling of caution since the later seasons of the TV show haven't been exactly stellar. But the film came out and proved to be a hit with audiences saying it was the funniest the show has been in awhile and I can honestly say it was. Sure, some gags don't work and there's a ""firing on all cylinders"" feel to some of the jokes like they hope at least ONE of them will make you laugh but I did quite enjoy watching the film.With constant polluting of Lake Springfield, the town grows closer to an environmental crisis and with the help of Homer and his new pet pig, the lake becomes incredibly polluted and a plot is conceived by the government: encase the town in a giant dome. On the run, the Simpson family head to Alaska to start a new life but with the town in danger, they have to return and clean up the mess they made...literally.One knock against the film and it's one several people have mentioned is that it doesn't feel all that different than a normal Simpson TV episode. Bart wants a better father figure, Lisa's still unsuccessfully campaigning for better things and Homer and Marge's marriage is in trouble. But with sharper animation, including some CG uses and an even funnier script, the film feels like it belongs on the big screen and can work at home as well.The jokes as well are practically season 9-12 quality with many, such as Ralph's singing the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare, Spiderpig and Bart's nude skateboard ride feeling just as memorable as anything from the show. With the help of Green Day, Albert Brooks (the french bowler Jacques or Hank Scorpio, the Bond-esque villain from the show) and Tom Hanks, the film's at least a winner a good chunk of the time which is surprising considering the actual show's output lately.With the recent Futurama film out as well as this, it proves for all their troubling practices, Fox can still do some quality viewings now and then and hopefully the film will make the show as good as it was.",4,Solid spiderpiggy goodness,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,2100,"['When', 'Simpsons', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'given', 'go-ahead', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'either', 'anxiously', 'anticipating', 'wanting', 'watch', 'feeling', 'caution', 'later', 'seasons', 'TV', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'exactly', 'stellar', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'proved', 'be', 'hit', 'audiences', 'saying', 'was', 'funniest', 'show', 'been', 'awhile', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'Sure', 'gags', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'feel', 'jokes', 'hope', 'least', 'ONE', 'will', 'make', 'did', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film.With', 'constant', 'polluting', 'Lake', 'Springfield', 'town', 'closer', 'environmental', 'crisis', 'help', 'Homer', 'new', 'pet', 'pig', 'lake', 'incredibly', 'polluted', 'plot', 'conceived', 'government', 'encase', 'town', 'giant', 'dome', 'run', 'Simpson', 'family', 'head', 'Alaska', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'town', 'danger', 'have', 'return', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'made', 'literally.One', 'knock', 'film', 'one', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'feel', 'different', 'normal', 'Simpson', 'TV', 'episode', 'Bart', 'better', 'father', 'figure', 'Lisa', 'still', 'unsuccessfully', 'campaigning', 'better', 'things', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'marriage', 'trouble', 'sharper', 'animation', 'including', 'CG', 'uses', 'even', 'funnier', 'script', 'film', 'feels', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'work', 'home', 'well.The', 'jokes', 'well', 'are', 'practically', 'season', '9-12', 'quality', 'many', 'such', 'Ralph', 'singing', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'fanfare', 'Spiderpig', 'Bart', 'nude', 'skateboard', 'ride', 'feeling', 'just', 'as', 'memorable', 'anything', 'show', 'help', 'Green', 'Day', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'french', 'bowler', 'Jacques', 'Hank', 'Scorpio', 'Bond-esque', 'villain', 'show', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'least', 'winner', 'good', 'chunk', 'time', 'surprising', 'considering', 'actual', 'show', 'output', 'lately.With', 'recent', 'Futurama', 'film', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'troubling', 'practices', 'Fox', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'quality', 'viewings', 'now', 'then', 'hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'show', 'as', 'good', 'was']",N/A

In fact, this film is just about exactly the length of 4 episodes strung together.... So what's the point of making (or seeing) a Simpson's movie?Unfortunately, this film doesn't really answer the question.  Obviously there is a story arc that must extend over the time alotted, but the story is long because the movie is 90 minutes, not because a story was created that needed 90 minutes to be told.  It doesn't bring anything particularly new to the Simpsons universe.  In fact, there are so many internal rip-offs that repeated viewings may make the most forgiving fan cynical (especially the extended scene of Homer ""finding himself"", which was done better and more efficiently in the Season 8 episode ""El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer"", or the idea of Marge leaving Homer, more poignantly protrayed in Season 5 in ""Secrets of a Successful Marriage"").So why give the film 4 stars?  Because it's funny.  It's funnier than just about any other film out there.  The writers of the Simpsons take their craft very seriously, and fill the time with wall-to-wall jokes.  There's also the added interest of some very impressive shots that would never be possible with the time and budget constraints of the TV series.  For example, there is a shot that sweeps through an angry mob coming after Homer - there must be a thousand characters, all individually rendered and distinct, and it's very impressive!This Blu-ray edition is pretty simple, but I, for one, appreciate that.  Since the disc does not use all the bells and whistles of the Blu-ray software, it actually loads up quickly and even remembers its place if the power is turned off (so it can resume playing from where it was automatically).  The extras are pretty thin - a couple of commentaries (they are pretty interesting, for commentaries) and a few deleted scenes.

655319,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JPQZ,Dave. K,"[0, 1]","A lot of TV shows that make it big there is always talks of a possible movie and with the exception of the X-Files it turns out to be nothing, but talk. The biggest problem faced is getting a plot that you would have trouble making into an episode. The Simpsons Movie in my opinion was an excellent movie and while I wouldn't say it was great despite my rating it's one of those movies that is just so entertaining that any flaws that can be found are easy to ignore.The first half of the movie I found to be the best and it was really just so funny, but the 2nd half doesn't work as well, but it's always funny and always entertaining. Though at times it does sort of feel like an extended episode in my opinion, but again despite any problems I never found anything not to work. Like I stated The Simpsons Movie is just one of those flicks that is so much fun that any flaws can easily be ignored. This is some of the most fun I had watching a movie. The plot does sort of play out like an episode and that's why I said it does sort of feel like an extended episode.Homer does something that can possibly destroy Springfield, Marge gets fed up and leaves with the kids and in the end Homer does the right thing. We've seen this done countless times on the show, but it still works well and The Simpsons Movie is just a blast to watch from beginning, middle to end.There were far too many writers to list them all 11 in total and all the writers write for the TV series. Though I have to wonder why it took 11 to write the script, but regardless the script was very solid. As I stated in this review the first half was the best of the movie and the writing was really great. Even in the 2nd half when I felt the movie to slightly lack it was still well written. Watching the TV series I knew what to expect out of the writers, but I think the movie was a lot better written than I thought it would be. I mean I wasn't expecting a bad script or anything, but the script did turn out a lot better than I thought it would.David Silverman serves as director and like the writers he also works for the show. Obviously someone from the show would direct seeing as who would know better? When it comes to TV shows turned into feature films the best director is always someone involved with the show, people often come up with a wish list, but just because someone is a great director doesn't mean they can turn a TV show into a movie. You still need to stay true to the concept of the show.In films it's more about the director than writers, where as TV is more about the writers since directors normally don't have much control unless they write or produce the show. So there won't be as much creative freedom and again you have to stay true to the concept. If you watch the show you should know what to expect. Like TV shows, The Simpsons Movie is more driven by the writers, but Silverman does a solid job at taking this from TV series to feature film.People often underrate Voice actors and the cast of the Simpsons are terrific. All of them really bring so much to the role and Dan Castellaneta is just too funny as Homer. As funny as the writing is it really is Dan Castellaneta's voice for Homer that makes it work so well.Pretty much all the characters from the show appear and some like Ned Flanders plays a nice size role while others like Principal Skinner is just sort of there, but with only 90-minutes compared to about 22-episodes it's a lot tougher to work in the other characters. But even with screen time lacking for some everything still works out well.Overall despite the flaws, The Simpsons Movie is just so much fun to watch and even though the 2nd half slumps slightly its never boring and always fun.",5,"Ok so maybe not a perfect film, but I stand by my rating",1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,3719,"['lot', 'TV', 'shows', 'make', 'big', 'always', 'talks', 'possible', 'movie', 'exception', 'X-Files', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'talk', 'biggest', 'problem', 'faced', 'getting', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'making', 'episode', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'great', 'rating', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'entertaining', 'flaws', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'easy', 'ignore.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'best', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'so', 'funny', '2nd', 'half', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'funny', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Though', 'times', 'sort', 'feel', 'extended', 'episode', 'opinion', 'again', 'problems', 'never', 'found', 'anything', 'not', 'work', 'stated', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'just', 'one', 'flicks', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'flaws', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'ignored', 'most', 'fun', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'plot', 'sort', 'play', 'episode', 'why', 'said', 'sort', 'feel', 'extended', 'episode.Homer', 'something', 'can', 'possibly', 'destroy', 'Springfield', 'Marge', 'fed', 'up', 'kids', 'end', 'Homer', 'right', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'show', 'still', 'well', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'just', 'blast', 'watch', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end.There', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'writers', 'list', '11', 'total', 'writers', 'write', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'took', '11', 'write', 'script', 'regardless', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'stated', 'review', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'writing', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'Even', '2nd', 'half', 'when', 'felt', 'movie', 'slightly', 'lack', 'was', 'still', 'well', 'written', 'Watching', 'TV', 'series', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'writers', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'written', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'bad', 'script', 'anything', 'script', 'did', 'turn', 'out', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'Silverman', 'director', 'writers', 'also', 'show', 'Obviously', 'someone', 'show', 'would', 'direct', 'seeing', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'better', 'When', 'TV', 'shows', 'turned', 'feature', 'best', 'director', 'always', 'someone', 'involved', 'show', 'people', 'often', 'come', 'up', 'wish', 'list', 'just', 'someone', 'great', 'director', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'turn', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'still', 'need', 'stay', 'true', 'concept', 'show.In', 'films', 'more', 'director', 'writers', 'where', 'TV', 'more', 'writers', 'directors', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'control', 'write', 'produce', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'much', 'creative', 'freedom', 'again', 'have', 'stay', 'true', 'concept', 'watch', 'show', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'TV', 'shows', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'more', 'driven', 'writers', 'Silverman', 'solid', 'job', 'taking', 'TV', 'series', 'feature', 'film.People', 'often', 'underrate', 'Voice', 'actors', 'cast', 'Simpsons', 'are', 'terrific', 'really', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'role', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'Homer', 'As', 'funny', 'writing', 'really', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'voice', 'Homer', 'work', 'so', 'well.Pretty', 'much', 'characters', 'show', 'appear', 'like', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'nice', 'size', 'role', 'others', 'Principal', 'Skinner', 'just', 'sort', 'there', 'only', '90-minutes', 'compared', '22-episodes', 'lot', 'tougher', 'work', 'other', 'characters', 'even', 'screen', 'time', 'lacking', 'everything', 'still', 'out', 'well.Overall', 'flaws', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', '2nd', 'half', 'slumps', 'slightly', 'never', 'boring', 'always', 'fun']",N/A

So it was with great fanfare and hoopla that THE SIMPSONS MOVIE was released in the summer of 2007 (and I was one of the fans hooping).  I should have written a review of the theatrical version, because on the big screen the visual clarity and crisp animation was extraordinary.  But now that this entertaining film is on DVD I still heartily recommend it; fans of the series won't be disappointed, and the antics of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie should attract new fans, too.The movie version is basically an extended television episode--only with even more subplots and sight gags (Bart's nude skateboard adventure, for instance) hurled at the viewer in rapid-fire, ADD fashion.  Which was my one problem with the film:  There is just so ""much"" when it comes to visuals and shenanigans I at times found it difficult to put my arms around it all.  Still, the main plot--in typical Simpsons fashion--is silly and lame, and Homer manages to resolve it in his usual dysfunctional manner, and Springfield is saved yet once again.  All the secondary characters (and there are legions of them) we have come to know and love each make their own distinct contributions, and creator Matt Groenig's THE SIMPSONS MOVIE more than holds its own as a satisfying entertainment experience.--D.

But seriously, my love for the Simpsons faltered around the 9th or 10th seasons of the show when the quality of the writing and character development dropped noticeably, though in the last few years the show has made a recovery. When I heard that this movie was finally being released after several years of development, I was feeling interested but not too fanatical. But lo and behold, the Simpsons have justified my two decades of love, and this movie is the pinnacle of everything the show has reached for over its long and accomplished history. The animators and designers have made full use of the cinematic medium, and this film is visually stunning from begin to end. Note that probably every single character who has ever been in the show is featured at one time or another, especially in the mob scenes. Most importantly, the movie is downright hilarious in the best Simpsons tradition.But even better, the writing team has brought together all of the past strengths of the show into a powerhouse of utterly subversive satire and social commentary, precise comedic timing, and empathy for the characters. Best of all, Homer is once again both a slapstick screwball and a decent family man like he should be. (The deterioration of Homer's dense loveableness into shallow stupidity has been my biggest complaint about the latter seasons of the TV show.) While Lisa and Maggie don't get too much stretching room here, there are great developments with Marge and Bart, who truly reinforce their complex relationships with the family. And ultimately, the social satire and reckless hijinks boil down to true Simpson family values (thanks also to the film's unsung hero, Ned Flanders). The Simpsons survive nearly insurmountable internal and external struggles in ways that are far more believable than the shallow family values of political pundits and lowest-common-denominator sitcoms. After 20 years on the scene, and a strong TV history with a few bumps and bruises, this movie brings together everything that is great about the Simpsons, and proves why they are such a classic and lovable component of American culture.

655330,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPQZ,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Credited to no less than fifteen writers, this 2007 big-screen version of the still-running animated series (unbelievably in its 19th season) is fast, frenzied and funny. I haven't watched an episode ofThe Simpsonssince the mid-1990's when I started to sense retread, but the movie directed by David Silverman reminds me how furiously clever the show can be with its unique mix of political incorrectness and pop-culture savvy. Moreover, at 87 minutes, or nearly four times the length of a regular episode, the plot never really flags, a startling accomplishment in itself. That's not to say the story doesn't sputter in spots from its own ambitious scope, especially in the last third, but the familiar characters seem revitalized by a plot that not only takes well-deserved potshots at organized religion and the EPA but reexamines the relationships within the nuclear family with surprising poignancy.An elaborateItchy & Scratchyspace adventure starts the movie, and then the plot begins in earnest as Green Day performs on a barge disintegrating from all the toxic substances in Lake Springfield. Community apathy has turned the once-bucolic setting into a life-threatening cesspool, reason enough for Simpson daughter Lisa to reignite her social activism. At the same time, Homer continues to eschew fatherhood, this time in favor of a pig he has decided to adopt and serenade (""Spider-Pig"" is an instant classic). He decides to accumulate the pig's waste in a gigantic silo, the aromatic ingredients of which he dumps into the lake. This sets off a natural disaster so monumental that EPA head Russ Cargill (a doppelganger for the Katrina-confused Michael Brown) quarantines the entire town under a giant dome. The townspeople of Springfield become an angry mob out to lynch Homer, and the rest of the movie follows his circuitous journey toward community responsibility and environmental awareness.Simpsons fans can rest assured that all five principal characters - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie -  are intact, and the voice actors have completely defined their characters with special mention going to Julie Kavner's frog-voiced drawl as Marge and Dan Castellaneta's buffoonery personified as Homer. Except for Ned Flanders, who becomes Bart's unctuously sensitive replacement father, most of the familiar supporting characters are relegated to cameos. Albert Brooks provides the voice of the Machiavellian Cargill, and Tom Hanks has a funny bit as his avuncular self. Although there are several amusing sequences, my favorite has to be the Disney-inspired foreplay scene between Homer and Marge out in the Alaskan wilderness. Most importantly, the writers successfully magnify and even exaggerate the human dimensions of these all-too-familiar characters in a way that feels fresh and textured.The primary draw of the 2007 DVD are the two commentary tracks offered - the first with producer and series creator James L Brooks, Simpsons creator Matt Groening among others and the second a more technically oriented discussion with Silverman and several of the sequence directors.

A mixture of zany action and pop culture satire, the show was a huge hit--and some twenty years later is still going strong.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE finds the family in their usual spate of comic chaos, including Grandpa's prophecy at church and Homer's acquisition of a pet pig.  Unfortunately, when Homer dumps a silo full of pig crap into Lake Springfield, rendering it toxic, he attracts the attention of the EPA and makes Grandpa's prophecy come true.  Is Springfield domed?  Er, doomed?There's a lot to like about THE SIMPSONS MOVIE.  It's well crafted, the characters have lots of off-the-wall bits, and when it scores it scores big.  But series fan who complain that the series has lost some steam over the years have a point: although its amusing and clever and lots of fun, The Simpsons just don't have the same bite they did back in the day--and this is as true of the film as it is of the series.  It's more akin to the pop culture it mocks than to the satire-sharp show it used to be.The DVD release, which is available in both full screen and widescreen, comes with several bonuses.

The basic premise of the movie is that environmental concerns plague the town of Springfield, after Grampa Simpson has strange revelations in church in front of a shocked congregation, and the EPA steps in and declares the very polluted town lake an environmental disaster area and builds a wall around it to prevent dumping. Meanwhile, Homer saves a pig from death at Krusty The Clown's fast-food restaurant and he and the pig become close, perhaps too close. When questioned by Marge as to where the pig's waste material is being put, he shows Marge a silo where he puts not only the pig's, but his own waste material. He then is asked to get rid of the silo, which he first takes to the Waste Management facility, but there is a long line so he drives to Springfield Lake and dumps the silo, causing an environmental crisis. The town is then put underneath a large dome, and when it is found out that Homer is the cause, the entire town storms the Simpson house to attempt to carry out mob justice on the entire family. The family escapes outside the dome and Homer suggests they move to Alaska, which they do, but then an unforeseen solution to the environmental problem in Springfield inspires a return to the town by the Simpson family. I will not give away too much more, but it is a hilarious and inspired satirical look at modern society and a commentary on American culture. Guest voices consist of Albert Brooks as the head of the EPA and cameos from Tom Hanks and the band Green Day, who meet their unfortunate demise in the polluted Springfield Lake at the beginning of the film.

The caustic satire and lampooning of politics that even the worst episodes of the show are laced with are utterly absent here. After 158 drafts by 15 different writers whatever original, worthy ideas they might have had are all carelessly mashed together, neutering all of them in the process.When Lisa points out that Lake Springfield is dangerously polluted to the point of crisis, Mayor Quimby orders a clean-up. Homer disobeys and dumps a silo of pig feces in it, causing an immediate toxic surge. The EPA seal the town in a giant dome to contain the pollution, proving Grandpa's vision in church to be true. The Simpsons escape the wrath of townsfolk and flee to Alaska for a new life.Wow! How about THAT for a horribly convoluted plot synopsis. I mean...Alaska? How could it take 18 years to come up with this? The comedic timing is just...wrong. The movie is broken on so many levels, it feels nothing like the TV show.

The scope widescreen composition is very good however, and Hans Zimmer provides a truly wonderful score which is far better than his other more popular efforts in recent years.The Simpsons Movie is not something I can watch again and again, it lacks the vital spark of the show while at the same time feeling like a 3-episode arc.

The TV series is funny, caustic, at times slightly gore and trashy, in short it is titillating us in the few spots where we are always itchy, in secret of course. We were waiting for Bart's eating his shorts as usual and we only got a very prudish s&eacute;ance of streaking on a skate board. The main theme is pollution and we had been told that it was going to be awfully gory and we got Al Gore, well wrapped up in his fat and  becoming an ecological terrorist in the hand of some bureaucrat of some environmental agency under the guidance of a president who was supposed to drag us down into the darkest layers of the political world and as for blackness and darkness we get a Swharzenegger that does not know how to read. Alaska is nicely polluted by oil companies. Sledge dogs rebel and abandon their master in the middle of nowhere. And we even get the seesaw humdrum banal triteness of ""in American you can always make as much money as you want."" The housing bubble is there to prove it: you can for sure make as much money as you want even with slimy loans, but then everyone in the world has to foot the bill when the enterprising individuals who did it crash and hit the bottom of a bottomless abyss.

One side character who is prominent throughout is Ned, and the movie take on him and his religious fervor is, by series standards, surprisingly touching and almost moving in places.Not up to the classic peaks of, e.g. Johnny Cash voicing a coyote, but a must for anyone who has enjoyed Springfield's First Family throughout the years.",4,"Not the Finest, Just Fine",1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,765,"['Simpsons', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'hopes', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'worth', 'seeing', 'More', 'movie', 'felt', 'least', 'extended', 'series', 'episode', 'very', 'nuclear', 'Simpson', 'family', 'centric', 'fair', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'supporting', 'characters', 'especially', 'dear', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'friend', 'Smithers', 'One', 'side', 'character', 'who', 'prominent', 'Ned', 'movie', 'take', 'religious', 'fervor', 'series', 'standards', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'almost', 'moving', 'places.Not', 'up', 'classic', 'peaks', 'e.g', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'voicing', 'coyote', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Springfield', 'First', 'Family', 'years']",N/A

I would have to agree, but I don't think that should be taken as a critical review of the movie but a favorable view of the show.  The Simpsons has always been one of those rare television shows that keeps you laughing from the start to the finish.  The movie does the exact same thing.Oh yes, this is a funny movie.  The theater was laughing from beginning to end.  It is filled with the usual Simpson's humor that makes the show a delight to see, especially their spoofs and satire on modern day events (for instance, when Lisa holds a town meeting on polluting the local lake there is a sign hanging up that reads, ""An Irritating Truth""... a typical Simpson dig).  I was a bit surprised that the movie didn't have more celebrities since most episodes feature a famous voice, but we do get to see cartoon versions of Tom Hanks and even Green Day singing The Simpsons Theme Song.  I can't think of the last time I've laughed out loud at a movie like I did with this one.Yes, there are some shock moments (cartoon kiddy porn, anybody?) but this is, after all, the Simpsons.  The show has always been right at the edge of the line of controversy since its inception and the movie pushes it a little bit further.  I must admit, I'm rather pleased that the writers held back and didn't turn this into a movie littered with the F-Word.  In fact, that doesn't get used once (unless you count one instance of a double-barreled birdie to the entire town of Springfield).  To me, the balance was just about right though I wished they could have toned down the homosexual references.  I'm just glad that the writers tried more for real humor than trying to shock the audience with dialog fresh from The Aristocrats.This movie does go out of its way to earn its PG-13 movie and I would not recommend bringing young children with you.  My 10-year-old is very mature for his age but I would never let him see this movie.The plot isn't too complicated.  The Simpsons' town of Springfield is deemed the country's most polluted city and is encased within a large, glass dome after Homer throws some pig manure into the local lake.  Will Homer do what is needed to not only save the town, but his relationship with his family as well?If you are a Simpsons fan then there is no reason to not rush out and check out this movie (unless you are a young Simpsons fan).

I'm not sure why, they had to show us Bart's thingy, but they did. I guess I laughed, but my God, did we need that? There are many reasons that The simpsons will leave you scratching your head, but the good news is this: It's a pretty good movie with fun visuals, and a musical opening that is worth the price of admission alone.If there is another, major grip, that I have, it's that there weren't enough cameo's for me. I would have loved a homage more to the volume of its characters. I believe this was one of the major strengths for the old show still running. We knew the entire town, as if it were some guffy version of our hometown. But here, it's all about the simpsons, and the disasters that go with them. I think it was the first time where I was laughing, yes, but also where I wanted them to stop, and wise up a bit. Stop being, well, so moronic like a newborn child. The stupid humor of the old days were just a tool used by a rather smart script and magnificently set up jokes. There is none of that still, even with all the feelings of good ol' Simpsons school here. But, then again, there is something that we fans have always wanted, and finally got, and that is a movie screen with our Simpsons on it. It would have been sad to never have at least one movie, and I'm glad that they did manage to fit one.I stopped watching the Simpsons about four seasons ago. But I was in tune to the inner jokes and God did I feel that it was deserving to the near twenty years or so of being on air. I laughed out loud at the endless supply of stupid and also witty jokes.

I was fully aware of the decline of the show but the movie was just so awful that I read a book to keep me entertained until it ended (I was determined to make it to the end). Bart's nude skateboard ride was completely out of place and utterly unnecessary. The humor was not the usual humor of the Simpsons--part of the reason that I love the series is the numerous old historical jokes about Grover Cleveland or old film strips--it was more similar to later episodes of South Park: feces and a subtle political undertone. There has been so little toilet humor in the Simpsons that I wonder why the writers thought it would be entertaining now. Many episodes used to have wonderful parodies of older films (Citizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange, The Godfather) or were genuinely touching. None of that occurred here.Normally, I have something redeeming to say about most movies or books, but for this I have none.The series needs to end before it gets worse. An episode I saw a few weeks back had Homer fantasizing about Marge making out with Lindsey Nagele. Patty has become a lesbian. Mr. Burns is no longer the ruthless villain he once was. Smithers no longer has a cloak of ambiguity. Lisa rarely acts like a little girl any longer.

It also makes good points about how people just don't wanna admit that there's a Global Warming. But rather than this movie changing their viewpoints they'll just leave satisfied that they had a good laugh. Especially when Homer is probably at his funniest and strangest.

655355,A1493DD8LRGOKC,B00005JPQZ,J. Kim,"[4, 6]","Heads up: This is a review of the DVD as a DVD, as much as it is a review of the actual film.I'm a big fan of the show (and the TV DVDs) and saw the Simpsons Movie on opening night and loved it. Very glad I bought it on DVD, and *almost* gave it 4 Stars, but I'm giving it 3 for two reasons:1) The film didn't stand up to repeat viewings as well as I thought it would. This could just be my own eccentricity or a simple matter of feature-length fatigue, but it didn't seem as fresh on 2nd/3rd viewing as a Top-10 Simpsons episode (Lisa the Vegetarian, Bart Sells His Soul, The Cartridge Family are a few of mine).One explanation could be that there isn't a focused writerly tone throughout the script due to the sheer number of writers at the table. This is a golden group writers, and their jokes are as sharp as ever, but by necessity, the film lacks a signature tone that, say, a classic Schwartzwelder or Maxtone-Graham episode might have.  But some might prefer it this way, as it does appeal to more casual viewers/those who aren't quite so fond of Schwartzwelder's old-timey humor as I am.As far as animation goes, it is a visually stunning achievement (a refreshing lack of bizarrely realistic CGI).  Signature Simpsons hidden details abound, which makes it a luxurious viewing experience for fans. I just didn't think the dialogue and plot played as well as I expected the second time around.2) The DVD extras are average.  Simpsons DVD fans are both agonized and spoiled--agonized by the years-long wait for each season's DVD to release, and spoiled by the depth and breadth of the commentary and extras per season.While the movie includes both a writers/actors and directors commentary, they are definitely not as lively or informative as the TV DVDs.  One reason for this is that the commentary tracks were taped close to the theatrical release date, so there aren't years of fan/hate mail, Internet forums, etc. for the writers/actors/directors to reflect on.  Like I said, we've been spoiled, and we can't have it both ways. The demands of the marketplace (and the holiday season) rushed this product to the shelf, so that they got two full commentaries on there is pretty darn good.The bigger disappointment for me was the lack of good deleted scenes.  There are a few on there, but overall it's a pretty skimpy selection.But I'd still recommend this to a friend, and have bought a few for Christmas gifts already! Overall, I'd give this DVD--based on its merits as a feature film and a Simpsons DVD product--3.5 Stars.",3,"""Why does everything I whip leave me?""",1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,2534,"['up', 'review', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'as', 'much', 'review', 'actual', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'saw', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'opening', 'night', 'loved', 'Very', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', '*almost*', 'gave', '4', 'Stars', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'two', 'reasons:1', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'would', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'own', 'eccentricity', 'simple', 'matter', 'feature-length', 'fatigue', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fresh', '2nd/3rd', 'viewing', 'Top-10', 'Simpsons', 'episode', 'Lisa', 'Vegetarian', 'Bart', 'Sells', 'Soul', 'Cartridge', 'Family', 'are', 'few', 'mine', '.One', 'explanation', 'could', 'be', ""n't"", 'focused', 'writerly', 'tone', 'script', 'due', 'sheer', 'number', 'writers', 'table', 'golden', 'group', 'writers', 'jokes', 'are', 'as', 'sharp', 'ever', 'necessity', 'film', 'signature', 'tone', 'say', 'classic', 'Schwartzwelder', 'Maxtone-Graham', 'episode', 'might', 'have', 'might', 'prefer', 'way', 'appeal', 'more', 'casual', 'viewers/those', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'fond', 'Schwartzwelder', 'old-timey', 'humor', 'am.As', 'far', 'animation', 'visually', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'refreshing', 'lack', 'bizarrely', 'realistic', 'CGI', 'Signature', 'Simpsons', 'hidden', 'details', 'abound', 'luxurious', 'viewing', 'experience', 'fans', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'expected', 'second', 'time', 'around.2', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'average', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'fans', 'are', 'agonized', 'spoiled', 'agonized', 'years-long', 'wait', 'season', 'DVD', 'release', 'spoiled', 'depth', 'breadth', 'commentary', 'extras', 'season.While', 'movie', 'writers/actors', 'directors', 'commentary', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'lively', 'informative', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'One', 'reason', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'were', 'taped', 'close', 'theatrical', 'release', 'date', 'are', ""n't"", 'years', 'fan/hate', 'mail', 'Internet', 'forums', 'etc', 'writers/actors/directors', 'reflect', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways', 'demands', 'marketplace', 'holiday', 'season', 'rushed', 'product', 'shelf', 'got', 'two', 'full', 'commentaries', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good.The', 'bigger', 'disappointment', 'was', 'lack', 'good', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'overall', 'pretty', 'skimpy', 'selection.But', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'friend', 'have', 'bought', 'few', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'already', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'give', 'DVD', 'based', 'merits', 'feature', 'film', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'product', '3.5', 'Stars']",N/A

I'm a pretty big Simpsons fan, but the jokes in this movie are so constant that it leaves you thinking...""Give me a break"" again and again. I thought the whole Spider Pig thing was going to be the main plot in the movie, but it was only one insignificant scene where Homer was making the pig walk on the ceiling. If this was a regular episode of the Simpsons, I would consider it one of the more boring episodes...simply because I don't think that the plot was very well thought out. Lake Springfield was already contaminated, yet just because Homer dumped the pig's waste into the lake, HE gets blamed for the the whole thing, and that's the whole plot of the movie.The whole ""sealing Springfield in a bubble dome"" plot was kinda dumb and ridiculous! Even some of my least favorite episodes of the Simpsons is better than this movie!I don't mean to sound so harsh, but I just feel that this movie should have been a helluva lot better than it was, especially since it was the first actual ""MOVIE"". The only shocking differences that sets the movie apart from the series is When Homer flips a double middle finger, Bart's penis is briefly revealed, and Marge shouts out the G D word near the end of the movie...which I found very shocking!Personally, I would have prefered even MORE shocking stuff than what the movie contained.

It feels overworked, yet at least one draft away from the kind of breezy sharpness you expect. The violence in it is a little too strong for the characters, felt in a way it never has been before (I notice a Cohen brother was a consultant). And due to a plot point that doesn't really land, you get a film about an evil nuclear bent Environmental Protection Agency - no doubt Rupert Murdock approved of that (it may have been intended to say this is what Republican rule has done to the EPA, but that's my stretch of what I saw).The vocal talent keeps it from really sinking, and there were several really good laughs and a paltry handful of surprises, but I suspect it will be looked back on as the film where they made their mistakes leading to a really good sequel. At least Maggie and I hope so. Most disheartening is the textbook 'deepening' of Bart, Homer and Lisa a little too - they didn't need it, they already had us before we walked into the theater. Hopefully Colin will turn up on TV.It needed the same kind of guts it took to button the Halloween episode where Kang and Kodos took over the world with the line, ""You said we'd be welcomed as liberators!"".

The ""Simpsons Movie"" is the absolute rock bottom of what used to be the greatest TV show ever.  This movie has zero resemblance to the brilliant Simpsons of old. Rather than laugh, I had the urge to vomit in terror and cry at the disgrace my beloved Simpsons is now reduced to.None of the satire, cleverness, vocabulary, creativeness, heart, charming cartoonery and hilarity remains.  All that's left are shells of jokes that used to be funny, random pointless nonsense trying to fool people that ""it"" is still there.  And of course the ever present yelling of Homer, often while hurting himself, which is beyond tedious now.  Then throw in a bunch of slick looking yet completely unfunny CGI, politicize the show and of course add a plethora of awkward and lame celebrity guest stints and you'll have the Simpsons Movie.Groening himself seems pleased as pie at the shameful train wreck the Simpsons has become.  Come to think of it, I've never heard Groening say anything funny at all.  His commentary on the DVDs is self satisfied and annoying.  Giving Groening credit for the Simpsons' greatness is like accrediting every website to the person who invented HTML.  His drawings are great and became the vehicle of very talented writers.  Talented writers have been absent from the Simpsons for nearly a decade, all that's left are shameful hacks that couldn't write their way out of a wet paper bag.There was a time when the thought of the Simpsons ending would terrify me.  No more, the Simpsons should have been laid to rest many, many years ago.  The Simpsons now is a corpse with makeup, being puppeteered by Groening, keeping the franchise on life support to earn a few extra million debauching it in the process.

655362,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00005JPQZ,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***With ""The Simpsons"", we don't have just a mere earthly empire, we have a universe. ""The Simpsons"" reputation for raucous, insouciant, yet human and insightful social commentary has been indelibly established. Only a global criminal scandal along the lines of Rupert Murdock's ""News of the World"", or a catastrophic flop could annihilate this universe. Therefore, I don't think there was excessive ""flop"" sweat and pressure among the ""The Simpsons Movie"" (hereafter TSM) animators, writers, producers, and directors to generate a flawless movie. Oh, I'm sure they cared enough to generate at least a respectable movie. But they also weren't primed to jump off any skyscrapers if TSM didn't win any Academy Awards. The Simpsons universe is cool - almost Bugs Bunny cool. But it also isn't afraid to make fun of itself as well as everything else (hence the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" cartoon and Homer's subsequent dismissal of people watching something they can get for free). The Simpsons Universe survives because it does not take itself TOO seriously -- just seriously enough.Now, did the ""TSM"" creators manage to make a cool, respectable movie? I think they did, and rather more than respectable. Is TSM essentially any extended ""Simpsons"" TV episode? I think so. But that's good, because I have always considered even the most mediocre ""Simpsons"" episodes (at least the ones I've seen) to be above-average mini-cinematic events, densely packed with detailed characters and story lines. TSM merely allows more time and breathing room to present its variation of ""Homer screws up, then has to save the day"". It would be redundant to spell out the plot here. Other posters have already done that. Suffice it to say that a lot of the trademark ""Simpsons"" TV characteristics appear in the movie.For example, we have the way a ""Simpsons"" plot never directly emerges, but has to be backed into. How can you predict that Homer's adoption of a pig initially destined for Krusty Burger slaughter would set in motion an environmental disaster, a federal quarantine, and even imminent destruction? As a second example, we witness the impulsive behavior of a 239-pound id as Homer bonds with a pig, dumps pig feces into Springfield lake even after it's protected from pollution, and prompts the whole town to exile him and his family as a result. As a third example, we see the deeply buried but true affection the Simpson family members have for each other, even at their worst and most despairing. In Alaska, Marge takes the kids and leaves Homer, perhaps permanently, unless he learns to care for others.Within the confines of a movie, even the Simpsons universe can't give you everything. It can't showcase every Springfield citizen in detail for example (you'll have to wait for sequels). The movie was correct to focus on the Simpson family itself and their individual problems, to remind both Simpson fans and newcomers of the real reason why many people adore these crazy people. It goes beyond the jokes, the satire, and the pratfalls (and TSM has more than its share). Again, even when things seem lost, the Simpsons (especially Homer) pull together and acquit themselves well. And they're so cool when they do! TSM does not break new ground, or try to be profound. It would have been terribly wrong to do so.

As a child, I always wondered what a live action Simpsons movie or an animated one would look like. I own seasons one through six on DVD. As of 2011, The Simpsons is still on the air. Never doubt the efficacy of prayer. In 2007, the producers of the show delivered The Simpsons Movie! It has that sweet Simpsons spirit and it delivers in showmanship. It's also packed with side-splitting jokes and gags. Homer puts a ""SOP"" sign on a road. Homer pollutes a river in Springfield with pig feces and The Simpsons must hide in Alaska. When the EPA tries to destroy Springfield with a giant dome and a bomb, Homer must redeem himself and return to save Springfield. The Simpsons Movie earned its PG-13 rating. There's a sight gag with Bart Simpson riding nude on a skateboard! Marge yells a mild curse word! There's plenty of fan service. The derelict, wrecked, 19 year old ambulance from Bart The Daredevil is still under a tree. The film opens with an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. You can hear Ralph Wiggum humming Alfred Newman's 20th Century Fox fanfare!Hans Zimmer's music score for The Simpsons Movie is very good. Series regular Alf Clausen got the short end of the wedge. Danny Elfman's Simpsons theme music can be heard in the film's score. The cameos by Green Day and Tom Hanks are the only ones still in the movie. An Edward Norton cameo was deleted. It's nice seeing 2-D animation in a contemporary film. CGI and 3-D animation have dominated the industry in the last decade. The Simpsons Movie feels like a movie. It starts out as semi-full screen and the film is in anamorphic widescreen after Professor Frink flies past the screen. There's the usual self-parody. Homer complains that people are paying money to watch something that they can watch for free on television! The Simpsons Movie spoofed one of the most depressing eras of our lives! It's also nice to hear songs by The Turtles and The Carpenters on the soundtrack. Some of the animation in this movie is visually stunning. I sat on the edge of my seat as Homer rode a motorcycle up the walls of the dome and shattered glass covered the screen! The novelty song 'Spider Pig'(a spoof of the Spiderman theme) is already a cult classic. The Simpsons Movie was referenced on the TV show with Marge yelling, ""One Simpsons movie was enough!""

Al Jean, a returning showrunner who once was at the helm during its heyday, to me had basically ruined the show by reverting to a kind of issue-laden dumbness.  It was like the show was catering to its youngest viewers and that the writers, now family men, had gone soft.So it was with slight trepidation that I watched this movie, but I'm happy to report that ""The Simpsons"" movie is very, very funny -- the funniest ""The Simpsons"" has been in quite a while.I'm not sure it will ever be as good as in those prime days -- when you were likely to do a spit-take at some sort of brilliant madness -- but this is fairly close.  It's also amazing just how well plotted the film is -- it's coherent and smart.  Unlike the latter episodes, which were deliberately random and wasteful, this film has a straightforward storyline that it sticks to.Like the series DVDs, extras are skimpy here (five minutes of deleted scenes with no explanation, two commentary tracks and a few skits).Watching this DVD made me nostalgic for the old days, when ""The Simpsons"" was the funniest cartoon on TV.A definite must for ""Simpsons"" fans.

From Bart's skateboard scene to the disconnect felt among all the family members, it just didn't feel right.

655368,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B00005JPQZ,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[3, 5]","It is always a win-win situation to make a feature film about a well known sitcom like The Simpsons. The cartoon is too famous and beloved by many fans worldwide that creating a film makes total sense. We basically get a glorified episode about ""saving the environment"" with tons of jokes with dark humor, spoofs and a bit of drama--and I'm saying this as a compliment. Everything you would expect from this dysfunctional American family that seems to get better with age. The Simpsons Movie is one of the best comedies of 2007. If you're a fan of the show, what are you waiting for? I guarantee it won't disappoint you.Brief Intro Story (might contain some spoilers):After a catastrophic Green Day concert, the Simpsons go to Sunday church like they normally do--Homer as always complaining about going there. As they are ""listening"" to the priest, Abraham ""Grampa"" Simpson has a vision and starts talking about a prophecy. At first, they don't think too much of it, but that's about to change.There is a big environmental problem in Springfield. People are just dumping garbage into the lake and Lisa Simpson is the only one who is trying to warn the population without any success. Meanwhile Barn is riding his skateboard naked around the city--because Homer wanted to know if he could do it. Finally they all ended up in a fast food restaurant where Homer sees a pig. He decides to bring the pig home, and this move makes Bart jealous.After few days, the people of Springfield realize that the pollution problem is a clear and present danger to their health, so they decide to clean up the lake and add a barrier along with hundreds of signs to stop the ""not so intelligent"" of them. Meanwhile Homer needs to get rid of the pig's excrement--he has it in a huge container in his backyard. Because he wanted to get some donuts quick, he dumps the nasty container into the lake. This is the prophecy. The lake becomes extremely contaminated--even the pollution mutates docile animals--that the leader of the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and the President Arnold Schwarzenegger put a gigantic glass dome to cover the entire city. Springfield is now sealed from the outside world. The citizens soon find out that Homer is responsible for this tragedy and lynching him is the solution. Homer and his family manage to escape but bigger problems are in the horizon.Review:Faithful to the sitcom, The Simpsons Movie takes us to a very enjoyable movie experience. Traditional enough with the endless jokes and known trademarks--even the ""news ticker"" which I found quite amusing--but this time around we get deeper into the characters fears, dreams and serious personal issues. Like Barn feeling angry about his father, Maggie is having second thoughts about her husband, Homer trying to do the right thing for once, and Lisa finding a new friend who shares her believes. These situations give the characters life and personalities that is hard to find from some ""real"" Hollywood actors. The movie displays some political and environmental issues of today, but all within its limits. ""Save the earth"" is something that Lisa Simpson has been and advocate and we get to share her views again here.Technically the look and feel of the movie is virtually the same as the TV show. There are no ground-breaking new especial effects tricks to speak of--exactly like one of the earlier teaser said ""in 2D."" What really makes the film so enjoyable? It's not the graphics, but the situational jokes, celebrity spoofs and the interaction with the characters. An old formula that is like wine--or perhaps Duff Beer--it gets better with age.The Verdict:The Simpsons will go down in history as one of the greatest cartoons ever. Its legacy will remain strong for many years to come. Probably the only dysfunctional American family we don't want to change a bit. Some might complain about the latter seasons, but make no mistake about it. The army of writers has done it right this time.

Sherman ""The Critic""","[3, 5]","After 20 years of endless wacky adventures, America's favorite dysfunctional family gets the big-screen treatment, complete with fluid animation, 3D effects, and earth-shattering explosions.  This just in: while in church, Grampa Simpson receives a bad omen of massive proportions.  And when that happens, you know that Homer has something to do with it; actually, it's all his fault.  In other news, Marge heeds Grandpa's warning but, of course, fails to warn Homer.  In her quest to clean up Springfield river (where special guest stars Green Day perform), Lisa meets a cute Irish boy.  Bart, who is neglected by his father, warms up to next-door neighborino Ned Flanders.  Back to Homer: when his latest blunders land all of Springfield in trouble, the Simpsons skip town.  After that, the family races against time to save the day and some how, some way, by some miracle, find it in their hearts to forgive Homer.  Coming up next: Bart skateboards naked, Moe becomes emperor of Springfield, and Maggie speaks!But what gives this film its edge is that it's not only bigger, better, and uncut, but that it's 100% unfooled-around-with.  No changes in roles, no risky attempts at a live action production, and appearances by President Arnold Schwarzenegger (yup, he's the president in this film) are kept to a minimum.  You get the same look and the same great taste of the TV series (except that the movie leaves out those mono-eyed aliens from all those Halloween specials).  If you're a fan of the show, you'll still get that same comedy goodness.

Swagman,"[2, 4]","we've been hearing rumors of a Simpsons movie for years, and eagerly, but cautiously, awaiting it's release for just as long.I say cautiously because everyone knows the junkyard is littered with TV show movies that just couldn't make the transition to the big screen hour and a half. And cartoon TV shows are usually the worst for this.I was reading on-line once that Matt Groenig and the creators of ""The Simpsons"" were delaying making a film because they wanted to wait until they had an idea good enough to justify making the audience go to the theaters.Well, if true it is very idealistic of them, but I think they failed to meet their own criteria. It's not a bad Simpsons, but it's not anything spectacular either. It is essentially just an hour and a half long episode of ""The Simpsons"".I did catch myself laughing a lot during this movie, but I think  if you just take 3 episodes from the Golden Age of ""The Simpsons"" and tie them together, it would be a lot funnier than this film was. This film was funny, but if you're expecting something spectacular you're going to be disappointed.I also found myself squirming in my seat a little bit near the end of the movie.The plot wasn't bad, but it could have been better. For my money, it retread familiar ground too much. (Homer screws up, Marge looses her faith in him and the marriage hits a low point, Homer does something to redeem himself). Granted it's on a bigger scale than ever before this time, but the basic formula is something we've seen over and over again in many Simpsons episodes already.Like ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"" or any summer movie event with a huge following, this movie was bound to disappoint and be a victim of high expectations.

It is not that I dislike them, but I just never got into them; although, I have enjoyed the occasional episode.  Recently, however, due to circumstances my control, my husband showed THE SIMPSONS MOVIE to our 4 and 1/2 year old daughter...and she LOVED it.  At this point, I would say that she has watched it in whole or in part over 25 times.  She can quote quite large portions of the script verbatim, and of course, she can sing the Spider Pig song...loudly.  So, obviously, I needed to screen THE SIMPSONS MOVIE personally. (Better late than never!)And, much to my surprise, I found THE SIMPSONS MOVIE to be very fun and quite entertaining;  truly much better than I had expected.  THE SIMPSONS MOVIE has a fun story, many humorous and memorable moments, and is true to itself - what more could I ask for?  There is nothing particularly bad or unsavory in this movie; nothing that will corrupt my four year old.  (There are, however, a few things that go over her head:  she had to asked her dad what a ""doodle"" was! Then again, she asked me to define ""epiphany"" for her.  So, I guess you take your vocabulary words where you can get them.) The rest of my family, my husband and my 12 year old daughter, also really enjoys THE SIMPSONS MOVIE.So, quite surprisingly, I am recommending THE SIMPSONS MOVIE as an entertaining family flick.

655377,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B00005JPQZ,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[2, 5]","The term ""Worst.  Movie.  Ever."" is likely to be the most overused catchphrase from Simpsons fans who walk into ""The Simpsons Movie,"" and want to give a ""critique"" that makes them sound more clever then they really are.  Like Jay Sherman giving a bad review of ""Sleepy Hallow"" on his show (saying the movie is ""both sleepy AND hallow"") just for the sake because it's too good a pun to pass up, I expect many others will be quoting the Comic Book Guy's most famous quote from this week to sometime in September, the time where the DVD will arrive on store shelves if recent trends are to be believed.  Still, if people are to claim this the worst movie ever in an attempt to sound clever, then I am afraid ""The Simpsons Movie"" is going to be very, VERY shorthanded this year!  If anything, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a movie that delivers not only a very satisfying movie going experience, but it is also a movie that is worthy of respect.That may sound like a strange recommendation about a movie where the storyline is held together by pig crap, but it's absolutely true.  Like the TV show of the same name, ""The Simpsons Movie""really isn't held together by it's storyline.  On the contrary, the movie is much like the TV show in that it begins with one thing only to change focus and turn into something else midway through the film.  As mentioned before though, all the major events in this movie start when Homer Simpson, fresh having adopted a pet pig named Spider-Pig/Harry Plopper, dumps all of the little porkers dumpings into Springfield's lake, therefor causing the US Government to declare Springfield a health hazard and seal the town in a large glass dome.This doesn't sit well with anyone in Springfield really, but it sits the worst with Homers (very patient) wife Marge, who received a spiritual message from God prophesying this event, and warning of more danger to come from it.  And while we're talking about spirituality, it appears that the passages about a father needing to take care of his family proves to be very true in this movie.  It's not just Marge who Homer tends to neglect, as his own son Bart is craving the attention of a proper father figure after a particularly humiliating event involving a skateboard, a dare, and a little yellow doodle.  With Homer not filling the shoes of a responsible father figure, Bart ends up looking at neighbor Ned Flanders in a new and caring light.  This comes as news to  Bart, who previously felt Flanders was nothing more then a conservative loser who didn't really have any fun.Lisa meanwhile is mad at her dad for polluting the lake, a serious offense in her book seeing how much of an environmentalist she is.  Oh, and she has a new Irish boyfriend that I'm willing to bet will disappear once season nineteen airs on Fox in November (just in time for the annual Halloween episode to air one week after Halloween).  As for Maggie...well, she's the one member of the family who says the least, yet seems to understand more then everyone else in the movie.  As with the TV show (depending on who you ask), ""The Simpsons Movie"" delivers so many laughs you might need a spread sheet database so you can keep track of all the jokes, the first of which has Homer watching a movie version of Itchy and Scratchy, and complaining loudly ""I think everyone in this theater are a bunch of suckers for paying for something they can watch on TV for free.""We then have a President Schwarzenegger making all the wrong decisions now that he's in the White House.  I'm wondering whether or not I should mention the big name celebrity who guest stars...nah, I'll leave that for you to see.  With eleven writers on the screenplay, ""The Simpsons Movie"" has as many writers as ""Meet The Robbisons"" did, twice as many writers as all the summer sequels, yet it's one of the most intelligent scripts of the year.  It reminds us why the Simpsons have been on the air for so many years, and why we continue to watch even when the quality of the show has been spotty the last couple of years: Because when this show nails it, it nails it hard.What is the ""it"" I refer to?  Everything.  It hits with the humor, so it's laugh a minute.  It hits with the action, so that it's exciting when it needs to be.  But most importantly, it hits on the heart.  The characters may be stereotypical at times, but they are real human beings.  Human beings who make mistakes, want more from life, and question the choices they make.  It's this key difference that makes shows like ""Family Guy"" look like the cheap productions they are.  While ""Family Guy"" is content to laugh at the characters, ""The Simpsons Movie""gives us characters we can laugh with and, at times, share an emotional moment or two with.  Maybe that's why whenever Homer does something stupid we sympathize with Marge and the kids so much.  We love Homer.  Why wouldn't we like Homer?He's generally a nice guy.  The problem is he's an idiot.  He's a MAJOR idiot!  Yet we forgive him and all his flaws because we see he tries so hard to be good, it's just that his human failings bring him down, as they do everyone else.  Rounding out the experience is a wonderful musical score by Hans Zimmer.  I don't normally bring up musical composers in my print reviews of movies, but I think this is interesting to note because Hans Zimmer is one of my personal favorite musical composers and one of the most acclaimed in Hollywood right now.  That said, he's not who I had in mind for scoring a Simpsons movie.  His best scores are that of epic's such as ""Gladiator,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" and ""Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End.""  His comedic scores for movies such as ""Shark Tale"" and ""Madagascar"" are pretty weak though.To say I was a little concerned about the music would be putting it mildly.  Thankfully the music is a revolution in itself.  Working with a bigger canvas the script for ""The Simpsons Movie"" aims for a higher emotional reach and succeeds spectacularly.  The score reaches the same epic heights while still getting the low key moments perfectly.  It's sounds like Simpsons music, but more mature.  A perfect sound for this movie.  I'm not sure if a review for ""The Simpsons Movie"" is really something the world needs.  I don't know if people who don't regularly watch""The Simpsons"" are even all that interested in seeing this movie, and faithful viewers will watch it anyway.  So regardless of my high praise, and three hours time it takes to review this movie are, ultimately, a futile effort.

Finally, The Simpson's have a movie made about them. This is a great movie too. All the great comedy of the television show is slam packed into this great movie.Much like many of the Simpson's shows, the story is slowly crept into. You think the plot will be about other things until you finally realize what the show is about. What this one comes down to is Homer Simpson throwing a septic tank into the already extremely polluted lake. The septic tank is the final amount of pollution that the lake can take. The government chooses to contain this disaster by putting Springfield under a huge glass dome. The mob comes after Homer, but he and his family escape the dome. From there they move to Alaska. Springfield is in jeopardy though. Will Homer and his family return to save the day? I don't want to spoil the movie too much.One thing that truly stands out is the amazing animation. It really is an incredible step up from the television series. You will see parts of the movie that look like they are in 3-D.There is a great mix of stupid humor and satirical humor used that work really well together. The wall that was used to stop anyway from getting to the lake is a joke about the Mexican/American border wall. You also get all the crazy antics of Homer Simpson.This movie really has no flaws, but it just doesn't feel perfect. This is a great movie to buy and I recommend it to anyone.

Homer adopts a pig and basically gives it his undivided attention.  Bart, hurt, seeks another father figure and finds that with his religious neighbor, Ned Flanders.  Lisa is head over heels with a newcomer, Collin.Well, the pig is a mess to the point where Homer has to build a silo to dispose its wastes.  Meanwhile, Lisa and Collin are environmental activists and raise an awareness among the citizens of Springfield.  They're successful with saving their local dying lake from environmental catastrophe.Predictably, Homer has to get rid of the silo which is filled to the brim.  One thing leads to another where the silo ends up the lake and Homer just kinda looks the other way.The EPA gets involved and determines that the Simpsons are responsible.  The people of Springfield are mad and want to execute this family.  The Simpsons have no choice but to escape.A new life sounds fun, right?  Well, we can always rely on Homer to mess things up as well as not owning up to his mistakes.  This causes stress on his marriage with Marge and estrangement with his children.

Being a long time Simpsons fan and owner of most of their season box-sets, i have to say i enjoyed this movie a great deal.  I thought it was funny(except for any scene with Homer on the rooftop) and would recommend it to Simpsons fans and film-goers in general.  The only time i thought it was bogged down as 'just a tv show on the big-screen' was during the more personal and quiet alaska segment.  Everything else had a big scope to it that was worthy of the big-screen.  Some good inside jokes, cameos of beloved characters, spider-pig theme, brisk pacing, great opening and closing credits and just overall entertaining is why i recommend it.  It's not the 'best episode ever' or 'best movie ever', so if that's your main criteria then go ahead and pass on this.If you get the dvd like i did though, you can enjoy 2 good commentaries(the writers/performers' one that's more interesting to listen to and the directors/animators' one which is more on the informative side).  You get deleted scenes(mostly good yet brief), a bunch of trailers for the film in sequence, and some other extras, previews, and a few easter eggs.  The 'special extras' are actually disappointing as they are just brief promotional stuff like Homer doing a monologue on Leno, or some bit for american idol.  Commentaries are actually better than the other extras if you're interested in that sort of thing(i was kinda hoping for a commentary featuring the voice actors in character, that would be fun).

Homer adopts a pig who's run away from Krusty Burger.  Krusty tried to have him slaughtered,  and Homer names him  ""Spider Pig.""  We see Homer walking the pig on the ceiling.  A complicated plot (as usual in Simpsons TV) starts evolving and it moves along at a good clip with wacky and interesting twists and turns.  We come to the lake and Spider Pig's waste filling up a silo in two days. Homer has some problems and can't get to the dump very fast, so he backs the silo in the lake, polluting it. The EPA, and a bad boss named Cargill (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gives Homer four choices, and somehow we come to putting a dome over Springfield to prevent anyone leaving town.Homer, though, gets out along with his family.  We watch hoping that Springfield survives evil plans of destruction.  The story goes on in many directions, including a trip to Alaska.The Simpson's movie holds up well and many hidden jokes and wry laughs throughout.

But never did it ever reach any of the heights of even the most unfunny of Simpsons episodes.  It made me laugh, but only on the inside, and they were just little, stupid chuckles that were pretty infrequent.  The movie was flat, it felt like one season finale stretched over an hour and a half, it wasn't fast paced enough like the show is, and the only entertaining part was Bart's nude skateboarding through Springfield.  But that is the kind of stuff that's really the problem, because in the show, beyond the fact that I would find that sort of thing really funny, there would always be an equally great counter joke or punchline that would be the point of the scenes.  So there are plenty of fun scenes in this movie, but there are no punchlines, no bizarre moral family lessons.  Just boring boring boring.  This is nothing special, but it should have been.  It's the Simpsons for crying out loud.  They've been around almost as long as I've been alive(I'm 23).  The writers failed. The direction was off.

The packaging itself is extremely poor and disappointing. The back of the case is less of a description of the movie itself and more of a sale of Blu-Ray technology. Sadly, upon playing the disc, this Blu-Ray does a poor job of selling Blu-Ray as there is much left desired in both special features and even the capabilities of Blu-Ray... The pop-up menu is buggy which is, imo, the number one selling point of either of the next-gen media formats.My copy of The Simpsons Movie came with no insert either... No paper advertisements flooding out of the case, not even a menu list inserted. I feel as if I bought this movie on the street bootleg from both the back description of the case and lack of any insert.The $35 price tag of this movie at Best Buy, $30 at Target, less here, is incredibly high in comparison to many other Blu-Ray movies, especially new releases. The packaging, or lack of, and sheer laziness in the compiling of the menu makes it a major waste of money. This product was entirely rushed to milk consumers during the Christmas season. A special edition will undoubtedly hit stores in some months from now with full offering of special features as it's been said there are over 90 minutes of footage that never made the final cut... In this offering we get a very few deleted scenes.As for the movie itself... The Simpson's Movie did not fail to disappoint  a fan who continues to watch the show as it's a sunday night Fox line up tradition, who just couldn't imagine a sunday night without a new Simpsons episode, but much rather prefers the early seasons. Just because it's The Simpsons did I see it in theaters and why I bothered purchasing the Blu-Ray.The movie spends no time with anyone from Springfield other than Flanders and of course, The Simpson family. Lisa had an interesting love story going but the movie doesn't dwell too much on that nor really wraps it up. The whole movie is a big environmentalist message about global warming and the like.... I might as well had seen ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" would've walked out of the theater having had a few more laughs as he was actually serious... And the audience was seriously going to see a movie about a man's inflated ego talking for over an hour.The release of this movie is extremely poor from the packaging to the special features to the design of the menu. The movie itself is a far cry from the original Simpsons episodes we all know and miss.If you haven't seen the movie: Rent it. This isn't something you can really sit through more than once or twice. For those who are fans of The Simpsons, such as I, and must have a complete library... Wait for a special edition release.

Here we are all those years later and not only is that network still up and running, the series still on (and though I could be wrong I believe it's the longest running series in history) and a feature film of that series makes its way this week to DVD. The series? THE SIMPSONS.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, as the series, has a simple plotline. Homer Simpson dumps waste into the local lake, it creates creatures and the EPA in turn places a dome over the town of Springfield to contain everyone. Simple though it may be it provides tons of opportunities for some hilarious sequences.The first actually appears in the warning shown prior to any DVD. This time around not only does the FBI warn you not to pirate copies of the film, the EPA lets you know that they are no way as portrayed in this film.Sight gags are everywhere, in particular the one that got so much attention on the films release where eternal bad boy Bart Simpson takes his dad dare and rides through town on his skateboard - naked! The sequence had him riding with everything from water hoses to French fries covering up his exposed willy. Everything except a cut in a hedge that shows off his animated manhood, briefly. It's a cartoon for goodness sake so don't get too riled.Jokes about the government (now headed by President Arnold Schwarzenegger), pollution, global warming, Alaska and more are treated with the irreverence that we have come to expect from the Simpsons. Each and every joke offers us something to laugh at. And laugh is what you'll do when watching this movie.Is it family friendly? For adults yes, for the more mature youngsters sure, for small ones maybe not. It does offer great entertainment though and would make a perfect addition to your DVD collection.I wandered away from THE SIMPSONS years ago when time constraints and schedules made me miss the series.

Though opinions differ about when the TV-show started going downhill, fans seem to agree that the latest seasons achieve nowhere near the brilliance of earlier instalments. So it would have been surprising if the movie did, and of course it doesn't. The story line seems awfully thin for 83 minutes, and the density and substance of jokes is equally meagre. Though most of the familiar characters put in a brief appearance, none of them play a role of any significance, and most get hardly a single line of text.Like in the later TV-episodes, there is much reliance on violent slapstick humour, most of it gratuitous. There are occasional flashes of the old spirit: Bart's naked skateboard ride is the highlight of the entire film, and the scenes in Schwarzenegger's Oval Office contain some observations on the nature of power that are hilariously accurate.

There are so many gags that there's bound to be jokes in this movie that will amuse just about anyone!The action starts when Lake Springfield is practically destroyed by excessive pollution; and so the town must clean it up. They do! Unfortunately, however, things don't stay that way--and there begins the REAL plot of this film. Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) decides to take on a pig for a house pet. When Marge (voiced by Julie Kavner) casually asks Homer what he's doing with the pig's ""leavings;"" Homer takes Marge out back and shows her his ""silo"" full of pig ""droppings."" Marge isn't too happy; and eventually Homer realizes he MUST get rid of the festering silo. Naturally, where does Homer go to get rid of the silo? Lake Springfield! Once again the lake is unbelievably contaminated.Russ Cargill (voiced by Albert Brooks) is in charge of the EPA and he sets out to rectify the problem. What happens? Springfield is enwrapped by a huge, impenetrable dome--and then wiped off the map. The residents of Springfield are furious at Homer; and sooner rather than later The Simpsons must flee. They go to Alaska in search of freedom from the infuriated residents of Springfield.Worse yet, Russ Cargill and President Schwarzenegger (voiced by Harry Shearer) hatch a plan to bomb Springfield so that it will never again pose a problem. This really raises the stakes.From here the plot can go anywhere. What will Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie do? Will they stay in Alaska where it's safe or will they return to Springfield to try to rescue the people there from being killed by the bomb? Will Homer and Marge's marriage be tested by all this strife? What will Bart think of Homer after this all becomes one huge mess? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!The animation couldn't be better. I was very impressed by the clarity and the sharpness of the images and colors. The voiceovers were outstanding as well. It seems like Matt Groening, director David Silverman and their crew can do no wrong.In addition, the DVD comes loaded with a plethora of extras considering this is all on one single DVD. There are several deleted scenes; and there's a very funny but brief extra entitled ""Let's All Go To The Lobby.""

No more are we hearing some classic-porn music as Bart and students watch the bunnies' honeymoon.  No more are we seeing Bart mooning people while humming an American anthem.  No more is there any sacrilege of the church by Homer.  No...now it's just another cartoon that's safe for kids.What?  I said it's safe for kids.  The TV show I'm talking about.  The movie? It's just as tame.  There's one questionable part where one character is fully nude, but nothing is shown until the end of this part...where it shows some anatomy briefly.Therein lies the problem with this movie.  It's too tame.  ""Tame"" is not what got Simpsons popular.  Simpsons became popular because they pushed the envelope.  ""King of the Hill"" and even that other show with the baby are a lot more risque than this, and that's sad, considering the price you're forced to pay to see this, which was literally YEARS in the making, only to end up, as so many reviewers have so aptly mentioned, a ""longer version of a regular episode"".So that's complaint #1.  Complaint #2 is the lack of character depth.  The other selling point of the Simpsons is the sheer variety of memorable characters.  The issue with the movie is that 99% of these characters aren't even explored.  The movie centers around Homer, Bart, Flanders and Marge.  Burns/Smithers get a 2 minute quick spot; Comic Book Guy says 2 lines and that's it; Bain is renamed to Schwarzenegger, which kills the original joke; Santa's Little Helper shows up inexplicably at the end of the movie; etc etc etc.  All of the other characters are just thrown in there for their one little piece of the spotlight and that's it.  I don't even remember seeing Apu.  Oh, and by the way, three of the funniest characters on the show were not to be seen; Skinner, Krabappel, and Chalmers.HOWEVER...The picture quality of this movie is top notch.  It's not just the clean appearance of the animation, even though it's absolutely striking, it's the animation technique.  The regular Simpsons used blurry transitions and ""film strip"" methods to transition between scenes.  If you recall the intro with the Simpsons name, and how that's animated, this whole movie is animated the same way; it comes across a lot better than the show.Buy it?  No.  Not unless you're a Blu-ray collector like myself.",3,Quality of Blu-ray: Excellent (Mr. Burns).  Quality of Movie?

655400,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JPQZ,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[2, 3]","I've never avidly watched the Simpsons, in any particular way. I've seen quite a few episodes, but I've never been inclined to go and out and buy the boxsets. I hated the animation in the very early seasons, but what do you expect? It's so much better now. Saying that, I do have a favourite episode - Lisa's Wedding. It's been my favourite episode since they had a Simpsons night on TV a few years back. It's quite bad that I can say that a TV animated episode made me cry.I never got the chance to go to the cinema to see this when it came out, although a couple of people I know went, and absolutely raved about it. It sounded good, and I'd picked it up a couple of times in the shops, but always put it back down again. After seeing the first Family Guy movie, I was very wary, because that was just three episodes stringed together, with obvious 'breaks' where each episode ended. When I got given this for my birthday, I was very surprised, not only had I never mentioned wanting it, but I did want it!I watched it within a few days of my birthday, and was left feeling empty and disappointed - but I did like the end credits, it was interesting to find out who'd voiced each character, complete with pictures. Pretty much, it was an extended, unfunny episode, with all the could-have-been best bits, been hyped up to the max already. The Spider Pig song, Bart's naked skateboard ride, everyone went on about this as soon as it was released, that by the time I got round to watching it, they bored me.I just thought that after x amount of years that the Simpsons has been running, the writers could have come up with a better movie and better lines, and better laughs. It wasn't as funny as some of the TV episodes I've seen. It was predictable, there was no laughter from me, and I was bored throughout.So why am I giving it three stars? Firstly, I do feel some loyalty to the Simpsons. It's always that TV show that you can pick up at any point in the show, and you'll know what's going on. Also, I do feel that I could watch this again at sometime in the future, when I'm bored, and probably enjoy it. Simply because it's the Simpsons. Apart from the fact it's not funny, it's an easy movie to watch, and you don't really need to switch the brain on in order to understand it. (I like those movies.) There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, apart from the unfunniness, it's just an extended episode of the Simpsons. Nothing wrong with that.Although it wasn't what I was hoping, the Simpsons Movie isn't really a must have if you're not a Simpsons fan, but if you are, add it to your collection.",3,Did we really need it?,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2606,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'avidly', 'watched', 'Simpsons', 'particular', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'inclined', 'go', 'buy', 'boxsets', 'hated', 'animation', 'very', 'early', 'seasons', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'now', 'Saying', 'do', 'have', 'favourite', 'episode', 'Lisa', 'Wedding', 'been', 'favourite', 'episode', 'had', 'Simpsons', 'night', 'TV', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'quite', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'TV', 'animated', 'episode', 'made', 'cry.I', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'go', 'cinema', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'couple', 'people', 'know', 'went', 'absolutely', 'raved', 'sounded', 'good', ""'d"", 'picked', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'shops', 'always', 'put', 'back', 'down', 'again', 'seeing', 'first', 'Family', 'Guy', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'wary', 'was', 'just', 'three', 'episodes', 'stringed', 'together', 'obvious', ""'breaks"", 'where', 'episode', 'ended', 'When', 'got', 'given', 'birthday', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'never', 'mentioned', 'wanting', 'did', 'want', 'watched', 'few', 'days', 'birthday', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'disappointed', 'did', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'who', ""'d"", 'voiced', 'character', 'complete', 'pictures', 'Pretty', 'much', 'was', 'extended', 'unfunny', 'episode', 'could-have-been', 'best', 'bits', 'been', 'hyped', 'up', 'max', 'already', 'Spider', 'Pig', 'song', 'Bart', 'naked', 'skateboard', 'ride', 'everyone', 'went', 'about', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'got', 'round', 'watching', 'bored', 'me.I', 'just', 'thought', 'x', 'amount', 'years', 'Simpsons', 'been', 'running', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'movie', 'better', 'lines', 'better', 'laughs', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'TV', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'predictable', 'was', 'laughter', 'was', 'bored', 'throughout.So', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'Firstly', 'do', 'feel', 'loyalty', 'Simpsons', 'always', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'point', 'show', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Also', 'do', 'feel', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'sometime', 'future', 'when', ""'m"", 'bored', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Simply', 'Simpsons', 'Apart', 'fact', 'not', 'funny', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'switch', 'brain', 'order', 'understand', 'like', 'movies', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'apart', 'unfunniness', 'just', 'extended', 'episode', 'Simpsons', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'must', 'have', ""'re"", 'not', 'Simpsons', 'fan', 'are', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

It is very, very funny throughout, but it is true that many of the best gags of the whole movie were given away during the trailers (Spider Pig anybody?)

It's funny that SOOOOOO many people on here say that this film should have come out ten years ago, when it actually would have mattered and could have possibly been funny, because I was thinking the exact same thing! What does that tell you? People have too much emotional attachment to the show to admit that this film is awful. They mindrape themselves into thinking anything and everything with the Simpsons' faces plastered on it is good, much like female fans of Johnny Depp do. If the film was 90 minutes of the Simpsons sitting on the couch and blinking their eyes, they would say ""oMg BeSt MoViE eVeR!"". How pathetic! Yes, it's been said already many times, but I'm thinking it so I'm saying it; it is straight up a 90 minute episode of the godawful past 11 seasons. Cheap and forced jokes, bowel movement references, lots of obnoxious loud noises, and just plain lame, unfunny nonsense. Topical humor that will be outdated in a few short years, pointless celebrity cameos and references, and anything else catering to the modern pulse. Too bad the generation after us won't relate to any of the humor so that damns the film into not being timeless at all! Hmm, how many borrowed clich&eacute;s from the show did we see? Marge threatening to leave Homer, Springfield on the brink of disaster, an angry mob, the Simpsons on the run, Homer falling in love with something not human, discord between Bart and Homer, Lisa falling for a boy...

655404,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JPQZ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 7]","There's a predictable path to pop culture icons that start on television.  The Simpsons went from animated shorts on the Tracy Ulllman show to their own series and finally, to this movie. All that's missing is the live-action version and the Broadway play.With a PG-13 rating, there's an opportunity for the Simpsons to stretch their legs a bit and do naughty things they couldn't do on television, like nudity, language, violence - you know, all the fun stuff.  But there's got to be more than that.The Simpsons is a richly detailed universe with characters that actually evolve, from the passing of Flanders' wife to Apu's massive brood. These characters are what make the Simpsons so much fun; there are stereotypes that are a reflection of every aspect of American life.  They're us.  Fatter, dumber, louder, uglier...but they're us.What does the Simpsons movie do?  It drops a dome over the city of Springfield and then separates the Simpsons from the rest of the cast.  The rest of the film then involves a villain never-before introduced, a random helpful character (a busty Eskimo lady), and a love-interest for Lisa that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.The plot involves the EPA and pollution. Which is odd, since Lisa, arguably the biggest opponent of pollution on the show, doesn't have much to say or do here.  In fact, she's occupied with her love interest.  Bart's supposedly having a crisis over Homer being a bad father (unbelievable, given that Homer's behavior borders the insane).  And Marge reconsiders her marriage.  For the eighth time.For some reason, someone thought the idea of Homer becoming obsessed with a pig was funny.  This in turn morphs into Homer turning the pig into ""Spider-Pig.""  And that one-off joke, which at most gets a mild chuckle, turns into the tent pole supporting the Simpsons.  It's in Homer's dream quest.  It's in the DVD menu.  I mean, seriously, the idea of Spider-Pig is cute the first time.  But it's hardly movie material.  In fact, after starting the chain of events that are the crux of the Simpsons movie, the stupid pig disappears entirely. Even the writers knew the pig was a dumb idea.It's not that the Simpsons movie isn't funny.  It's that it's extremely uninspired, given the fine pedigree of writers for the show.  The mutant squirrel that becomes the symbol of Springfield's pollution best sums up the lack of inspiration.  There already is a mascot of Springfield's solution: the three-eyed fish.  The fact that the movie didn't use it shows just how underutilized the Springfield cast really is.",3,D'oh!,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2574,"['predictable', 'path', 'pop', 'culture', 'icons', 'start', 'television', 'Simpsons', 'went', 'animated', 'shorts', 'Tracy', 'Ulllman', 'show', 'own', 'series', 'finally', 'movie', 'missing', 'live-action', 'version', 'Broadway', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'opportunity', 'Simpsons', 'stretch', 'legs', 'bit', 'do', 'naughty', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'television', 'nudity', 'language', 'violence', 'know', 'fun', 'stuff', 'got', 'be', 'more', 'that.The', 'Simpsons', 'richly', 'detailed', 'universe', 'characters', 'actually', 'evolve', 'passing', 'Flanders', 'wife', 'Apu', 'massive', 'brood', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'Simpsons', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'reflection', 'aspect', 'American', 'life', ""'re"", 'Fatter', 'dumber', 'louder', 'uglier', ""'re"", 'Simpsons', 'movie', 'do', 'dome', 'city', 'Springfield', 'then', 'Simpsons', 'rest', 'cast', 'rest', 'film', 'then', 'villain', 'never-before', 'introduced', 'random', 'helpful', 'character', 'busty', 'Eskimo', 'lady', 'love-interest', 'Lisa', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'plot.The', 'plot', 'EPA', 'pollution', 'Which', 'odd', 'Lisa', 'arguably', 'biggest', 'opponent', 'pollution', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'do', 'here', 'fact', 'occupied', 'love', 'interest', 'Bart', 'supposedly', 'having', 'crisis', 'Homer', 'being', 'bad', 'father', 'unbelievable', 'given', 'Homer', 'behavior', 'insane', 'Marge', 'marriage', 'eighth', 'reason', 'someone', 'thought', 'idea', 'Homer', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'pig', 'was', 'funny', 'turn', 'morphs', 'Homer', 'turning', 'pig', 'Spider-Pig', 'one-off', 'joke', 'most', 'mild', 'chuckle', 'tent', 'pole', 'supporting', 'Simpsons', 'Homer', 'dream', 'quest', 'DVD', 'menu', 'mean', 'seriously', 'idea', 'Spider-Pig', 'cute', 'first', 'time', 'hardly', 'movie', 'material', 'fact', 'starting', 'chain', 'events', 'are', 'crux', 'Simpsons', 'movie', 'stupid', 'pig', 'entirely', 'Even', 'writers', 'knew', 'pig', 'was', 'dumb', 'idea.It', 'not', 'Simpsons', 'movie', ""n't"", 'funny', 'extremely', 'uninspired', 'given', 'fine', 'pedigree', 'writers', 'show', 'mutant', 'squirrel', 'symbol', 'Springfield', 'pollution', 'best', 'sums', 'lack', 'inspiration', 'already', 'mascot', 'Springfield', 'solution', 'three-eyed', 'fish', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'just', 'how', 'underutilized', 'Springfield', 'cast', 'really']",N/A

While there have been so many, others haven't delivered like Evan Almighty, and Harry Potter. Surprisingly, animated films have all been overlooked for the past several years, but with films like Shrek The Third have been funny and entertaining. One of the biggest surprises of course has been from television. The Simpsons have been one of the most entertaining cartoon series of all time, but the past several years, the show has lost its luster needs of a jolt. Homer, Bart and company have finally made it to the big screen, but is this what the series needed to new fans and die hard Fox fans wanted?The Simpsons movie, really delivers more of the irreverant and laughable humor that has been needed from what The Simpsons has missed out on awhile on television. This film, mainly shows Homer, Bart, Marge & Lisa looking for life and love in all the strange but weird places. The movie plays out like a full-length episode of the series well. The story of the movie is that during the day the clan heads off to church, where they are criticized for being late, and Grandpa Simpson predicts an warning sign of the end of Springfield. Along the way, Homer takes in a pig who he loves and endures as a replacement for Bart. Bart finds solice with his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his kids. As Homer's love for his pig comes into play, he abruptly cleans up the pigs' droppings by dumping it into Lake Springfield. Suddenly, the town is declared a hazardous waste site by the EPA, and gets shielded into a dome to keep the town into isolation from the world.Abruptly, the town turns to rioting against The Simpsons and they flee out of the dome, and head to Alaska to try a new life, but with the town in shambles from food and supplies, Homer feels the blame, and Marge, Lisa and Bart put the heat on Homer, by heading back home to help the town out. Feeling the guilt, Homer heads back and helps out and tries to save his town, and the people who love him from an outrageous bomb threat that would destroy the town, and would've turned Springfield into the second Grand Canyon. Although, I was wishing from more interaction from the reliable cast with The Simpsons clan including more from Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, and the cast of characters that made the show just as goofy as we've grown up with, but it works nicely.All In all, The Simpsons Movie is so far one of the best films to check out this Summer that really is worth the wait, and keeps the joyous laughter nicely and revives it most of the way. Even a surprise guest appearance from Green Day at the beginning, performing the theme song their way, and getting booed for talking about the environment is handled with joy and humor as funny as you'd expect delivers. I absolutely was reminded how much I forgot about the love and warmth The Simpsons was missed for so long, and I really like the film. See it at the big screen.

Though each season has been great in my opinion, the idea of a Big Screen debut for The Simpsons was always a lingering, tantilizing possibility.  With the release of the 'South Park' movie a few years back, as well as an extended episode of Fox's other ""family"" cartoon show released on DVD, Simpsons fans' appetites were further whetted.Then came the news that all Simpsons fans were yearning to hear, from long term fans (like myself) to new fans of the series: 'The Simpsons Movie' would finally be made, scheduled for a Summer 2007 release.  Of course, then came the anxiety of waiting for its release, all the while wondering whether it would be a flop or ""the"" movie we'd been waiting for.  After seeing it on the night of its release and here, only a few shorts months until its DVD release, it is safe to say that it is the latter.'The Simpsons Movie' lives up to its hype; it is the result of endless hours of brainstorming by many of the show's writers, both current and old.  It includes in-jokes and returning characters that long term fans will appreciate while implemeting a fluid and consistent story line throughout.  The jokes within are some of the series' finest, and yet it does not feel like an extended episode, a common concern shared by many.  Overall, it is a fantastic creation by the many genius minds behind this genius series.Fans of this show that have yet to see this film, rest assured, it does not disappoint.  To close, the rumored DVD Special Features list is vast, including several deleted scenes, interviews, TV spots, and more.

Who would of thought it would still be on to this day. Both The Simpsons and Family Guy are my favorite.The movie which was rumored for a while, finally comes to the big screen. I remember when it first came out, there was a big banner hanging from the Multiplex. Mmmmmm. Simpsons on the big screen! argharghargharghahr!The  DVD has a good number of extras on the DVD including one of my favorities, deleted/extra footage. The picture looks great and you can't beat the price for a good amount of goodies on the DVD. No bare bones DVD here. If you want a bare bones DVD, move along! Nothing to see here! Please disperse!The Simpsons Movie follows the dysfunctional Simpsons of Sprinfield Illinois. Anyone familiar with the cartoon will notice that the voices haven't changed. The characters haven't changed either. You get Chief Wiggums (the police officer), Moe (the owner of Moe's Tavern), Flanders and his 2 children (they live next door to the Simpsons and of course, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. Poor Homer can't catch a break and when his father, Abe, creates an embarassing moment where he shouts that the end of Springfield is near, no one listens. Homer brings home a pig (Spider Pig) and Marge gets nervous because of Abe Simpsons rant about the pig. It seems like when Abe had a light shining on him in church, he for a moment was ""possessed."" Kind of like premonitions and the pig was one of them. Lisa also is on a quest to clean up the lake in Springfield. When the citizens listen; eventually, Homer dumps Spider Pig's ""leftovers"" in the lake and pollutes it beyond belief. This sets off a series of disasters for Springfield which can ultimately spell the end of Springfield. The Environmental Protection Agency closes down Springfield and the citizens of Springfield find out who caused the EPA to enclise Springfield in a large bubble which was delivered by the very very very expensive Osprey. The EPA then hunts down the Simpsons as Homer takes his family and runs away to Alaska. Trouble ensues as the EPA hasn't given up their pursuit of the Simpson family. Marge gets fed up with Homer constantly not listening to her and Homer after talking to a Native American eventually realizes the error of his ways. Perhaps the ""Evil Trees"" tearing him apart piece by piece and slapping him to guide him in the right direction had some effect on Homer. Soon a bomb is placed in the Springfield bubble to erase Springfield off the map. Can Homer Simpson change? Will Marge forgive him? can he save his family and Springfield too?All in all, this was a funny movie. Even if you have never saw the Simpsons on TV, you probably will find it funny. Matt Groenig, the creator of The Simpsons hasn't shyed away from conspiracies or poking fun and pretty much anything. This movie is no exception. The government not listening to its people, a president not thinking things clearly and the list goes on. All poking fun and making jabs. If you like comedies and of course, The Simpsons, this was very funny.

655408,A1SLVQKERJUS16,B00005JPQZ,Mike Smith,"[9, 14]","I have loved watching The Simpsons for years, but I cannot express how disappointed I was by this movie.  Everyone I asked about it who saw it before I did, and nearly every review I read, was so kind to it and told me how great it was, and I now have to wonder if every single one of them was lying.Because I feel lied to.This movie is, at best, like a moderately funny episode of the show.  In no way does it equal even one of the best episodes, or justify at all its more-than-$60-million-dollar budget.  It structure is uneven and choppy, its jokes are too few, and at times it even blatantly rehashes jokes and scenes from the show without altering them at all.The film is loaded with the cheesiest and most forced sorts of Simpson-esque jokes; the kind that usually only appears about once every episode is absolutely rampant here.  The beginning (set in a movie theater) doesn't flow into the scenes that follow, and the scenes at the very end jump back in time to before the movie's climax.  The jokes could be so much funnier, the story could be smoother, the satire could have been much less heavy-handed, and that much-lauded ""Spider-Pig"" song would be a lot funnier if it was only used once and not brought out over and over.The movie was just so disappointing to me, and to a lot of discerning Simpsons fans I know, in part because I really thought it could have been great.  Instead, it was so much less than great--just okay--disappointing enough that I haven't really wanted to watch the show much since seeing this.",2,A kick in the crotch for loyal fans,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1532,"['have', 'loved', 'watching', 'Simpsons', 'years', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'asked', 'who', 'saw', 'did', 'nearly', 'review', 'read', 'was', 'so', 'kind', 'told', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'now', 'have', 'wonder', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'lying.Because', 'feel', 'lied', 'to.This', 'movie', 'best', 'moderately', 'funny', 'episode', 'show', 'way', 'equal', 'even', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'justify', 'more-than-', '60-million-dollar', 'budget', 'structure', 'uneven', 'choppy', 'jokes', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'times', 'even', 'blatantly', 'jokes', 'scenes', 'show', 'altering', 'all.The', 'film', 'loaded', 'cheesiest', 'most', 'forced', 'sorts', 'Simpson-esque', 'jokes', 'kind', 'usually', 'only', 'once', 'episode', 'absolutely', 'rampant', 'here', 'beginning', 'set', 'movie', 'theater', ""n't"", 'flow', 'scenes', 'follow', 'scenes', 'very', 'end', 'jump', 'back', 'time', 'movie', 'climax', 'jokes', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'smoother', 'satire', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'heavy-handed', 'much-lauded', 'Spider-Pig', 'song', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier', 'was', 'only', 'used', 'once', 'not', 'brought', 'out', 'over.The', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing', 'lot', 'discerning', 'Simpsons', 'fans', 'know', 'part', 'really', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Instead', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'great', 'just', 'okay', 'disappointing', 'enough', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'show', 'much', 'seeing']",N/A
655409,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JPQZ,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 3]","Springfield will never be the same when Homer J. Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) dumps a silo of pig crap into the rivers, rather than drop it off at the recycling plant, so he could get free donuts. His mistake haunts him as the quaint town is covered by a dome under orders of EPA leader Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks), and the townspeople rightfully put the blame on Homer. Eventually, he and his family - Marge (Julie Kavner), Bart (Nancy Cartwright), Lisa (Yeardley Smith), and Maggie (Nancy Cartwright) - escape from their wrath and take residence in Alaska. Things aren't too problematic until president Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) is mistakenly fooled by Cargill into blowing up Springfield to make room for a monumental canyon gap. Now it's up to the Simpsons, especially the disgraced Homer, to get back on the town's good graces by saving the day.If there's any hit TV show that never hit the big screen yet, it's the classic animated sitcom ""The Simpsons"". Even before ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"", the classic cartoon from writers Matt Groening and James L. Brooks (director of any film starring Albert Brooks or Jack Nicholson) was the originator of biting satire, political commentary, and plain old sitcom hijinks that we've come to love (bratty boys, insecure girls, fat husbands, neurotic wives, crazy Christians, botox-addicted news announcers, raspy-voiced sisters, stoner bus drivers, hardened educators, etc.). And where do we go from there? The silver screen, that's where.Directed by series producer David Silverman, and written by nearly everyone from the show, ""The Simpsons Movie"" doesn't really need to expand upon their formula, considering that they've pretty much done it all (hence a familiar quote from ""South Park"": ""Simpsons did it.""). Following a flat-out hilarious ""Itchy & Scratchy"" short that's basically a classic Disney short with twisted slapstick, we're given a very familiar opening of the show that highlights all of the main characters of the show, concluding with a memorable performance by punk rock legends Green Day. Stuff like that is a sign for ""Simpsons"" die hard fans that they're definitely gonna have yet another good time, and I can't lie there.Of course, that doesn't mean it's another walk in the park with a PG-13 rating. Bart's nudity often covered in ""Austin Powers""-type fashion? Marge taking the Lord's name in vain? Otto enjoying his last toke session at Doomsday? Sure, it ain't much, but the comic timing of the material is what makes it all work, especially any other gags.It was wise for the entire cast to join in on the proceedings, and everyone gives sharp line readings. Homer is front and center of this picture, the lazy dad character with such likeability and charm for us to follow with him, and no other talented voice actor like Dan Castellaneta (who juggles other roles including town drunk Barney, Donald Trump surrogate Mayor Quimby, kids TV show duo Krusty the Clown and Sideshow Mel, and various others) could give the character whatever personality it calls for. Also joining Castellaneta with equal comic timing are Hank Azaria (Doctor Nick, Drederick Tatum, Apu, Bumblebee Man, Carl, Cletus, Chief Wiggum, Comic Book Guy, Moe, Lou, Professor Frink, Sea Captain), Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson, Maggie Simpson, Nelson, Ralph, Todd Flanders), Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson), Harry Shearer (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dr. Hibbert, Kent Brockman, Lenny, Montgomery Burns, Ned Flanders, Otto, Principal Seymour Skinner, Skull, Smithers), Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson), and so much more that could fill nearly 1,000 pages. There's also cameos from the likes of Green Day, Albert Brooks, Tom Hanks (as himself, promoting a new gap in Springfield and poking fun at his high-popular image - seeing him in his first comedic role in three years is a welcome respite from ""The Da Vinci Code"" and such), and many more.The Simpsons isn't necessarily a long movie (it's about 85 minutes). But there's plenty of material that the audience will crave.

Like many, I found it amusing but because of the anticipation and the hype it seemed a little flat.  Recently, I acquired a copy of the DVD and my impression changed dramatically when seeing it again, at home.  This is a great movie.The Simpsons TV show has always satirized the heartwarming family saga that is the mainstay of American television while paradoxically being the best heartwarming American family saga on TV. The longer length of the movie allows for bigger and better satiric riffs on contemporary culture.There's some great stuff here: Bart's skateboard ride, spiderpig and the send-up of the Disney animated features as Marge and Homer get ready for bed in the Alaskan cabin.The commentary by the creators about the need for balancing Homer's character throws an insightful look at the creative process in general and gives hint at why this movie took so long to make.  Much of the humor stems from Homer's comic failings which mirror the worst in American culture: he's obese, lazy and self-centered.  The commentary on making him bad enough to be funny but not so bad as to lose the audience's sympathy is one of the best of the special features on the DVD.",5,Worth a Second Look,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1240,"['saw', 'movie', 'summer', '2007', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'found', 'amusing', 'anticipation', 'hype', 'seemed', 'little', 'flat', 'Recently', 'acquired', 'copy', 'DVD', 'impression', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'when', 'seeing', 'again', 'home', 'great', 'movie.The', 'Simpsons', 'TV', 'show', 'always', 'satirized', 'heartwarming', 'family', 'saga', 'mainstay', 'American', 'television', 'paradoxically', 'being', 'best', 'heartwarming', 'American', 'family', 'saga', 'TV', 'longer', 'length', 'movie', 'bigger', 'better', 'satiric', 'riffs', 'contemporary', 'culture.There', 'great', 'stuff', 'here', 'Bart', 'skateboard', 'ride', 'spiderpig', 'send-up', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'Marge', 'Homer', 'get', 'ready', 'bed', 'Alaskan', 'cabin.The', 'commentary', 'creators', 'need', 'balancing', 'Homer', 'character', 'insightful', 'look', 'creative', 'process', 'general', 'hint', 'why', 'movie', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'make', 'Much', 'humor', 'Homer', 'comic', 'failings', 'mirror', 'worst', 'American', 'culture', 'obese', 'lazy', 'self-centered', 'commentary', 'making', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'lose', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'one', 'best', 'special', 'features', 'DVD']",N/A

I remember hearing stories about the upcoming Simpsons movie from when the show first debuted.Well, the Simpsons movie is here, but for better or worse, it's just a very long, average quality episode. That was probably a smart move, translating a cartoon into a full-length movie usually doesn't work. (The South Park movie was an exception.)The movie begins on the perfect note: Homer criticized the audience for seeing something at the movies that they could have seen at home for free. Several threads emerge: Grandpa goes into a religious trance at church and prophecizes doom, Bart streaks through Springfield and becomes a third son for Ned Flanders, Lisa sparks a cleanup of Lake Springfield after it consumes Green Day, and Homer adopts a pig.Homer then dumps a silo filled with the pig's manure into the lake, triggering an environmental disaster. The EPA then drops a dome over the city, sealing it from the world. The Simpsons escape and embark on a trip of Alaska, but return once Springfield is threatened with destruction.The film entertains like the Simpsons we know and love, but absolutely nothing distinguishes the movie from what could have been a multi-part episode. I have to say I was suprised it did well in the box office, I suspected it wouldn't sell at the theaters but turn into a DVD hit.P.S. Springfield should be Springfield, KENTUCKY.

655429,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00005JPQZ,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 1]","First things first: The Simpsons Movie is nothing more than a longer version of the show.  But is that really a bad thing, provided it's a quality longer version of the show?  Truth be told, this is quality stuff, and while it doesn't break any new ground, it milks the Simpsons name for what its worth and also harks back to some of the Simpsons golden days.Besides being a gag-ridden tour de force complete with a the now infamous spiderpig song, the story has elements from some of best of the earliest Simpsons moments.  Specifically, the film focuses highly on the family's relationships, something that was done to a tee til roughly about season 10 or 11.  Since then it's been a slew of gags (mostly funny ones though).  The story involves the Simpsons getting kicked out of Springfield because Homer has been resposible for over polluting the city.  It is pretty basic, but it allows for, believe it or not, focus on Marge and the kids trying to rectify their relationship with Homer.  It's done pretty well and reminds me of some of those earliest episodes.But besides the story, oh is it funny!  There is self deprecating humor (why would anyone pay to see something they could see on TV for free).  There is a number of jabs at the government and a hilarious cameo by a certain two time academy award winner.There have been a few people who have griped about the extras, but that's to be expected from die hard fans.  There are two commentaries and are just as entertaining and informative as the commentaries that have accompanied the series box sets.  And remember those trailers we saw in theaters before the movie was released?  Those are here (I like the bunny ones).  There are some mildly amusing deleted scenes and a couple other goodies.So will the Simpsons movie be put on a pedestal of great cinema?  Probably not.  It's probably the best thing the Simpsons have had in awhile.  Also, like any good Simpsons episode, it allows for repeated viewings and there's numerous little in jokes to catch when you go back.

I saw THE SIMPSONS MOVIE in a packed theater and the laughs were few and far between. The storyline was bland and the dialogue did not rise above the perfunctory. There were moments of amusement here and there but the whole project seemed to languish as a reminder of how this material has lost it's incisive edge.

655438,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPQZ,RMurray847,"[1, 3]","It's tough to review a film like this, because it is for such a particular audience.  If you know and love the Simpsons...you simply MUST go.  If you've never seen the Simpsons, you probably wouldn't go to the movie anyway...but if you did, you'd certainly miss out on most of the fun.  The movie TOTALLY assumes you already know all the people...there's no introduction, no easing into it.  It's basically like 4 great episodes strung together.But that's too simple.  To me, the makers of the film had to overcome the obstacle of how to bring an 18 year old series to the screen and make it seem worthwhile...not just charging money to see something that we could see at home.  So how did they succeed so well?To me, many, many episodes of the Simpsons revolve around Homer screwing up something so bad that he's seriously in the dog-house with Marge, and must then try to win back her affections.  Well, in the movie, Homer mananges his BIGGEST screw-up ever and it results in much, much more than simply ticking Marge off.  Their marriage is truly threatened.  When that moment sinks in for the two of them...it's touching filmmaking indeed.  When did a couple of hapless cartoon characters become capable of bringing us to tears?  (Years and years ago, actually...but the film drives it home).Also, the animation is kicked up a notch...mostly because the backgrounds are much richer than the TV show.  It's the Springfield we know...but it's also more textured.  And there are a couple of scenes so monstrously huge (I don't want to spoil anything, but they involved Homer on a motorcycle inside a giant glass dome) that they BEG to be enjoyed on a big screen.  It's kinda like wondering why a PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie is better on a big screen.  Just look at it, and you know why.Also, even without these elements, I would now say that seeing a Simpsons ""episode"" in a theatre with a few hundred other fans is a beautiful experience.  That alone was worth the money.  It was a communal event.  One drawback...I must now see the movie again, because we were all laughing so hard at times that I know I missed some stuff!!The movie is funny, touching and inventive.  It's a wonderful effort and I had a GREAT time!!Couple of little things that seem to be of concern to some of the reviewers here.  Remember, the movie is PG-13 and it should be.  Don't take a five year old or ten year old.  Do they fully appreciate the humor of the Simpsons anyway.  But just so you know...Homer gets to flip the bird (VERY funny), Marge let's out a non-TV friendly obscenity and in a jaw-droppingly funny scene, Bart skateboards in the nude and we briefly see a bit more than we expected!!

655442,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPQZ,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 12]","***1/2With an extended running time of one hour and twenty-six minutes and a wide screen ration of 2:35 instead of the usual 1.33:1, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is longer and bigger than the average series episode to be sure...but is it funnier?  Well, not quite.  That's a caveat I feel obliged to offer for those expecting this to be the laugh-riot sensation of all time.  It isn't.  Still, compared to most of the big screen comedies that have come our way this season, ""The Simpson Movie"" is one heck of a funny and entertaining movie - provided you don't go into it expecting more than the movie itself can reasonably deliver.The plotting, which is normally pretty freeform and surrealistic to begin with, has been ratcheted up even further in that direction for the movie.  The story has Homer causing a major environmental catastrophe in the town of Springfield when he thoughtlessly dumps a massive container of pig manure in the local lake, turning it into a sludgy toxic swamp.  To deal with this emerging national threat, President Schwarzenegger has a huge glass dome placed over the city, trapping the understandably irate citizenry inside.  There's no point in revealing anything more about the storyline except to say that it is up to Homer to save the day, which, of course, he does, in his own inimitable way.Fans of the series will be happy to know that ""The Simpsons Movie"" effortlessly captures the manic energy, sophisticated satire and devil-may-care spirit that have been its hallmarks from the very beginning.  Homer's good-natured bumbling, Marge's exasperated pragmatism, Lisa's unquenchable optimism, and, of course, Bart's fresh-faced mischievousness are all on full display in the movie (along with something else of Bart`s that is very much on display as well).  The other favorites who show up on screen include the perennial toddler, Maggie, Grampa Simpson, Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Millhouse, Krusty the Clown and others too numerous to mention.A team of well over a dozen writers - headed by series creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks - has come up with some hilarious situations and one-liners, enough, in fact, to compensate for the very few ideas or jokes that flame out or misfire.  The zinger-to-dud ratio is one of the best we`ve encountered in quite some time at the movies, though it's not as high, perhaps, as the best work in the series.  As with most feature-length comedies, the concept does feel a little stretched at times and the humor itself runs a trifle thin.  Still, with this much talent plugging away at the movie, it would be impossible for it to miss or disappoint its fans in any major way.  And, of course, there's the instantly familiar and outstanding voice work from regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria to get us into the spirit of the enterprise.The animators have chosen not to tamper too much with the look of the film for its big screen presentation.  There may be a bit more elaborate movement in some of the shots, but, for the most part, this is the same uncluttered, two-dimensional Simpsonian world familiar to us from the series.Indeed, the defining philosophy of those who made the film seems to be, ""Why mess with a sure thing?,"" an approach that can be both a strength and a weakness depending on how one looks at it. For unlike the ""South Park"" movie, which used its jump to the big screen to expand the scope of its vision and carry the series to a new level, ""The Simpsons Movie"" feels more like an extended version of a single episode, simply blown up to a more impressive size and length.  Thus, those looking for this to be the best and greatest ""Simpson"" episode ever may find themselves disappointed with what they find here.  Ditto for those who expect it to provide something different from what they've already seen on TV.  However, those who just want a few good laughs at the expense of everyone's favorite lovably dysfunctional adult and his wise guy son will have a rollicking good time at the movie.",3,not great but very good,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,4059,"['extended', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'hour', 'twenty-six', 'minutes', 'wide', 'screen', 'ration', '2:35', 'instead', 'usual', '1.33:1', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'longer', 'bigger', 'average', 'series', 'episode', 'be', 'sure', 'funnier', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'caveat', 'feel', 'obliged', 'offer', 'expecting', 'be', 'laugh-riot', 'sensation', 'time', ""n't"", 'Still', 'compared', 'most', 'big', 'screen', 'comedies', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'season', 'Simpson', 'Movie', 'one', 'heck', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'more', 'movie', 'can', 'reasonably', 'deliver.The', 'plotting', 'normally', 'pretty', 'freeform', 'surrealistic', 'begin', 'been', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'even', 'further', 'direction', 'movie', 'story', 'Homer', 'causing', 'major', 'environmental', 'catastrophe', 'town', 'Springfield', 'when', 'thoughtlessly', 'massive', 'container', 'pig', 'manure', 'local', 'lake', 'turning', 'sludgy', 'toxic', 'swamp', 'deal', 'emerging', 'national', 'threat', 'President', 'Schwarzenegger', 'huge', 'glass', 'dome', 'placed', 'city', 'trapping', 'understandably', 'irate', 'citizenry', 'inside', 'point', 'revealing', 'anything', 'more', 'storyline', 'say', 'Homer', 'save', 'day', 'course', 'own', 'inimitable', 'way.Fans', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'effortlessly', 'manic', 'energy', 'sophisticated', 'satire', 'devil-may-care', 'spirit', 'have', 'been', 'hallmarks', 'very', 'beginning', 'Homer', 'good-natured', 'bumbling', 'Marge', 'exasperated', 'pragmatism', 'Lisa', 'unquenchable', 'optimism', 'course', 'Bart', 'fresh-faced', 'mischievousness', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'movie', 'something', 'else', 'Bart', 's', 'very', 'much', 'display', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'favorites', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'include', 'perennial', 'toddler', 'Maggie', 'Grampa', 'Simpson', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'Millhouse', 'Krusty', 'Clown', 'others', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention.A', 'team', 'well', 'dozen', 'writers', 'headed', 'series', 'creators', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'come', 'up', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'one-liners', 'enough', 'fact', 'compensate', 'very', 'few', 'ideas', 'jokes', 'flame', 'out', 'misfire', 'zinger-to-dud', 'ratio', 'one', 'best', 've', 'encountered', 'quite', 'time', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'perhaps', 'best', 'work', 'series', 'most', 'feature-length', 'comedies', 'concept', 'feel', 'little', 'stretched', 'times', 'humor', 'trifle', 'thin', 'Still', 'much', 'talent', 'plugging', 'away', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'miss', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'major', 'way', 'course', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'outstanding', 'voice', 'work', 'regulars', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'Nancy', 'Cartwright', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'get', 'spirit', 'enterprise.The', 'animators', 'have', 'chosen', 'not', 'tamper', 'too', 'much', 'look', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'presentation', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'elaborate', 'movement', 'shots', 'most', 'part', 'same', 'uncluttered', 'two-dimensional', 'Simpsonian', 'world', 'familiar', 'series.Indeed', 'defining', 'philosophy', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'be', 'Why', 'mess', 'sure', 'thing', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'strength', 'weakness', 'depending', 'how', 'one', 'South', 'Park', 'movie', 'used', 'jump', 'big', 'screen', 'expand', 'scope', 'vision', 'carry', 'series', 'new', 'level', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'more', 'extended', 'version', 'single', 'episode', 'simply', 'blown', 'up', 'more', 'impressive', 'size', 'length', 'Thus', 'looking', 'be', 'best', 'greatest', 'Simpson', 'episode', 'ever', 'may', 'find', 'disappointed', 'what', 'find', 'here', 'Ditto', 'who', 'expect', 'provide', 'something', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'TV', 'However', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'expense', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'lovably', 'dysfunctional', 'adult', 'wise', 'guy', 'son', 'will', 'have', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'movie']",N/A

Also I initially wasn't sure how this would expand to the movie screen - what works so well as a tightly plotted 22 minutes is bound to drag at 87 minutes right?Wrong.Why did I worry? I loved it! In many ways, this movie reminded me why I loved ""Classic Simpsons"" so much. Many of the old writers had been brought back to work on it - even those not working on the show anymore. I won't spoil the plotline for you, but there were so many scenes that had me laughing out loud, recalling great moments from seasons past (for example Homer and Bart jump Springfield Gorge, again!)A scene where Bart goes nude skateboarding (don't ask) drew some of the biggest laughs when I saw it in the cinema.Oh, and of course there was the scene we'd all been waiting for.. *Spider-Pig*, and Homer's obsession with the pig is hilarious.I know some of my friends said it was a bit like an extended episode (it's almost exactly as long as 4 episodes joined together), but I dont think this is a bad thing because early Simpsons was just so good. What also elevated the movie for me was there was some great emotional content and sad/serious moments too, where you really CARE for these characters.However, there were one or two niggles. Perhaps more secondary characters could have been given more screen time (where were Kang or Sideshow Bob?) - and I didnt like the Lisa part of the story much - it didnt advance the story, and I don't like her character as much, though this may be due to my general dislike of Lisa episodes of the series. I suppose Lisa is like the opposite of Bart (intelligent as opposed to troublemaker) but they compliment each other, just like Marge and Homer.Despite these flaws, they are not enough to hurt the film at all.Go and see it!

Let me distract you from that 'untruth' with this shiny object. Oohhh look at it sparkle!Anyway - It took 20 odd years for the Simpsons Movie to happen, the obvious question is: was it worth the wait?The problem with taking any popular half-hour TV show and stretching it to film length is that you fundamentally alter the formula that made the series successful. The quick pace of the TV-show gives it snap and momentum and frees it from the necessity of plot and even believable continuity.Though the Simpsons movie manages  more than a half-hours worth of clever jokes it doesn't come close to hilarity of some of the series' best episodes. The remaining time is filled with rehashed plot-lines:  Marge and Homer's marital difficulties, Homer and Bart's father son difficulties, and Lisa's boy difficulties. I will say that the animation is gorgeous - easily several notches better than on TV.For a fan of the Simpsons this is must see - but it should have been more memorable. The movie gets 4 stars - the lack of extras on the DVD is why I ended up giving it 3.

And, after all these painful years, it happened. Any Simpsons fan, new or old, should find something they love about this movie. For me, it's the fusion of all Simpsons jokes, both old and new. Bart with his ever-funny way of making people insult themselves without realizing it. And most of all, Homer's ofe-like personality yet still a loving father. There are conflicts in the movie, like there always are, but in the end they do get solved after Homer and Bart stop the bomb from exploding on the city. But possibly the best part is that almost every Simpsons character ever shown in the series is present, though I was surprised that Sideshow Bob was never shown. Nonetheless, they make sure to cover the majority of the characters, even Itchy and Scratchy in the beginning of the movie, as well as the usual guest stars (all 3 members of Green Day).Another great aspect of the movie is whenever the scene gets emotional (like when Bart won't forgive Homer for all of his mistakes when he tries to save the city from the bomb on a motorcycle), you get the ol' ""Oh, by the way, here's a joke"" gag that's been a trademark in the show (I'll let you hold the bomb...""). Of course, the town is saved by Bart and Homer, but who saves them from Russ Cargill? Maggie! I believe this is roughly the 4th or 5th time she has saved members of her family (not to mention when she saved the rest of the Simpsons from the mob using the sinkhole in the backyard, also in the movie!). If you ask me, she's sort of the movie's unsung heroe.Besides the full-frontal nudity shot from Bart, possibly the most shocking thing in the movie is near the end, when a huge piece of the dome squashes Dr. Nick and he says, ""Bye-Bye, everybody!"" (y'know, instead of his usual catch phrase...). It made me and my friend (who saw it with me)wonder, ""Is he dead?"" I sure hope not! He's easily one of the best backing characters in the show.Well, whether he is or he isn't, I don't know. But I know one thing: The Simpsons movie is an essential part of the family's long, illustrious catalogue, and should go down as the great family comedy of all time. Clocking in at just nearly 90 minutes, it gets quite a bit done, yet at the same time, it doesn't feel rushed.

655455,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00005JPQZ,S. Rhodes,"[14, 21]","Let's get one thing straight from the get go.  The Simpsons is one of the most beloved TV shows in the world.  Let's also get another thing straight, the show has been around for nearly twenty years and has actually caused a divide among fans.  Those who believe the show is still good (or sometimes better than ever) and still has legs; and those who believe the show has been declining in quality for years.  I warn you of two things before you read on.  The first: I am one of the Simpsons fans who believes the show has been declining for years.  I still sit down and watch the show, but in all honesty, the last good season was probably season 10.  The second: Because of my stance, this review is heavily biased.  I love the Simpsons.  I've sat down and watched it since the first episode aired.  But sometimes even fans have to realize when their favorite show churns out something that doesn't live up to the standards of fans.  Perhaps its because I've been with the show since the beginning that it's easier to find fault with the newer episodes.Despite that, this movie will please people from both sides of the specturm.  Whether you think the show is is better than ever or you think it has declined in quality as I have, there's something here for you and it's partly because every writer who has ever been a part of The Simpsons chipped on.The movie begins in Springfield where Green Day is giving a concert at Lake Springfield.  Unfortunately the lake is so polluted that the stage Green Day is singing on (it's floating on the lake) that it eats away at the stage and it sinks taking Green Day with them.  This forces Lisa Simpson to hold a town meeting where she presents her lecture entitled ""An Irritating  Truth,"" (obviously a parody of Al Gore's documentary).  In addition, Homer and Bart have some fun (a moment so hilarious you'll miss out on some of the dialog because you'll be laughing too hard) which eventually lands them in Krusty Burger where Krusty is doing a shoot for a commercial.  When its over he orders the Pig be killed... and Homer can't let that happen.  So instead he saves the pig's life and takes him home.The citizens of Springfield agree to stop dumping trash in the lake.  Of course, there is one man who will dump something in there, of course... Homer Simpson.  When Marge asks him just Homer has been doing with the pig's ""leavings"" he shows her a silo aptly marked: Pig Crap.  Of course, Marge is disgusted and says that Homer still has to do something about it.  So what does Homer do?  Dumps it in Lake Springfield which causes a series of events that soon reach Washington D.C. and a corrupt politician. In the end, Springfield gets encased in a giant glass dome.  When they wonder why, they eventually find out that Homer is to blame.  Through strange circumstances the family manages to escape Springfield and go to Alaska where they no longer have to worry about Sprigfield's state.  What they find out later, of course, is that the corrupt politician (voiced brilliantly by Albert Brooks) plans to destroy Springfield.  Its up to The Simpsons to save the day.The movie is complete with all the humor you'd expect from the show itself.  Parodies, clever and witty dialog (there are some keepers here), physical abuse of Homer, Bart's shenanigans, Lisa's unpopularity... even the over the top zaniness that some from my side of the spectrum have come to loathe.  And of course, the movie pokes fun on a political and religious scale.  The whole plot of the movie is based around environmentalism and corrupt politicians while they also do their share to make fun of religion.  The Simpsons has never been shy about tackling controversial issues and this movie is no different.  Take some things too seriously and you'll surely be offended.Still, it's actually a very funny movie.  Especially the first twenty minutes.  There wasn't a single person in the theater not laughing at what was happening.  This movie is fun of memorable moments.  The infamous Spider-Pig is but one ingenious example.And then there are some bits of the movie that just fall flat.  This would be the humor that has been coming out within the past couple of seasons.  There are some parts that so over the top in stupidity that you'll either love them or hate them.  Homer's character is also unbalanced.  Homer has always been an oaf but at some moments he is unreasonably stupid.  At others he's not nearly as dumb.  In other words, the mesh of Classic Simpsons vs. Newer Simpsons is all too obvious in many areas.There are some other nit-picky things.  Some stories just aren't complete.  Lisa, for example meets a boy who she falls head over heels with, but the movie never completes this story arc.  Another nit-picky fan gripe is that a lot of the film just isn't in Springfield to begin with.  This means that while you see many of the residents, you don't spend much time.  Most of the Springfield denizens we've come to love (Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Chief Wiggum etc.) are on camera for mere seconds and hardly say or do anything.  It's almost like playing ""Where's Waldo"" only with The Simpsons cast.  It's not too big of a gripe, however.  With so many residents in Springfield you couldn't expect to see them all.  Just the same we don't really explore Springfield to begin with.  We don't go inside the school or the police station or anything.  Most of it is spent either at The Simpson's home or various places you've never seen in the show.But the biggest gripe?  That this is a Simpsons movie where Mr. Burns is not the main villain.  While watching this, I couldn't get over the fact that you only see Mr. Burns twice.  He's one of the most malicious characters in the show.  He's been involved in some of The Simpsons best lived moments, but here he doesn't even use his famous, ""Excellent"" phrase.  Not that the corrupt politician voiced by Brooks is bad, but it would've been far better had Mr. Burns been the main adversary.The final thing is that the movie is rather short and feels more like an extended episode rather than a full blown movie.  At 87 minutes it goes by in a flash.  And yet, despite which side you fall on: Classic vs. New, you yearn for the movie to be longer because regardless of anything, it's funny.  But it's also because you wish you could see more.It can't be easy to make a movie to a series that's been around for nearly two decades.  Especially with expectations so high.  The Simpsons Movie succeeded by having a successful run at the box office.  However, if you're from my side of the woods: Meaning you love the classic Simpsons episodes a lot... there's something to be desired that isn't there.For what it's worth it IS a good movie.  It's just a movie that had so much potential to be so much better.",3,A LIttle of the Good Mixed With a Little of the Bad,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,6796,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight',

The obese woman standing in front of me dropped her two Value Pepsi drinks on the floor and it got all over her, and the guy behind the snack bar said dully ""Thanks for putting this much more excitement into my life"" and called for a mop. Because this is exactly something that would happen to me normally, I couldn't help laughing until I took my seat in the theater. Little did I know I was in luck for more.Seriously, I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard in my life. I have been a die-hard, hardcore, extremely loyal Simpsons fan for most of my life, and there has been nearly no better treat this summer to me than watching America's ""first family of comedy"" on the big screen. If you're like me, you've probably noticed the last few seasons (ok, more than few, more like eight seasons) of the Simpsons have been less funny, less charming, less witty, ect. Usually whenever someone mentions a good episode of the Simpsons, it's been one of the old episodes from the early 90s. Let me one of many to tell you straight and upfront: the comedy is back. Paired up with hysterical references to the real world, classic spoofs on FOX itself (like the show is famous for), HUGE celebrity cameos (including a very popular rock band that tragically drowns in a river) even making fun of movie theaters and watching a TV show adaptation on the big screen, and even some tear-shedding tragedy--The Simpsons Movie has it all. The answer is finally true to me, and it will be to you after seeing the movie: the reason the recent seasons have been disappointing is because Matt Groening and his team of absolute GENIUSES have been bottling up a storm of side-splitting, spleen-bursting, voice-loosing, eye-tearing, stomach-bleeding, popcorn-crunching gold that would, to our surprise, be unleashed on July 27th, 2007, like a tank of Mentos in an ocean of Diet Coke. Quite simply, the funniest film I've had the pleasure of watching since ""Anchorman.""Yes, it's THAT good.Oh, and there's a lot more to it too.

Relying far too heavily on 'who's guest voice is it this week' it has gone from a show that had heart to one of stupidity and boredom.  While it doesn't even come close to the magic of what the TV show once, the movie has its moments with some great one liners. The first half sees jokes coming in thick and fast with some terrific moments, what Bart writes on the board, Homer's prayers in church about Flanders, Ralph's comment after seeing Bart's naked skateboard ride, Chief Wigam's retort to Lou after the Fat Tony scene. It's the second half where it falls flat and splutters, like the recent episodes, into the really stupid and ridiculous. The writers once again forget about the humour and bring in the over sentimental tones of Homer reconciling with his family and Lisa preaching about the environment.There is nothing wrong with this, but I couldn't help but wonder where is the cultural criticism that once made the show so great?

Sadly this movie leaves you wondering what all of the fuss about Blu-ray is all about.  Other films do a better job of showing off Blu-ray Disc's features and improved video quality better and perhaps cheaper as well since this disc is a bit pricey (actually it's priced at about what I would expect to have to pay for a season set of the show).Devotees of the show will certainly enjoy this one, but personally I'd recommend giving a spot in your video collection to Futurama: Bender's Big Score over this one.

655465,A24L13Q1GJAS6U,B00005JPQZ,"The Cruelly Mad Emperor Caligula ""Little Boots""","[5, 23]","Ahhhhh...the Simpsons...I vividly remember watching the series on which this movie's based back when I was just another know-nothing, nave and misdirected child/teenager. I used to loyally watch said series and never miss a weekly installment of it; I was what you'd call a ""fan,"" what everyone who subserviently fawns about this movie and series is, too. However, some time after I hit 18 and legally became a man, something correspondingly occurred which instantly curbed my level of interest rightly away from the Simpsons. This ""something"" is called mental and emotional maturity, a blessing that comes with the onset of adulthood; as I became an adult, I starkly realized the epiphany that the Simpsons appeals to the lowest common denominator of society: immaturity, crudeness, and grossly redundant stupidity.Frankly, the sickness that explains the worrisome and totally questionable interest of primarily adults in the Simpsons franchise is their monstrous lack of aforementioned adulthood!!!! The adults who still enjoy the Simpsons may want to re-examine their social conscience and take a page from my textbook by realizing that the Simpsons can truly only be enjoyed by kids/teens because at that age, one's brain is still puerile, therefore making it receptive to the low-minded elements of the Simpsons. For adults, I see no justification at all in enjoying the Simpsons, unless they admit to being unsophisticated, lowbrow and generally juvenile.My thesis (in case you were too unobservant to identify it) is the Simpsons Movie and series are so profanely juvenile that only kids/teens should be watching it, and adults watching it are developmentally stunted. I'll now present concrete, inarguable examples from scenes in the film itself to support my thesis. This is how it's done in the adult's world. This way, you, the adult, Simpsons viewer will be forced to acknowledge how childish you are and forced to face your denial.The Simpsons Movie wrongs the viewer on three levels: intelligence, decorum and originality, all of which tie into my opening paragraphs. Regarding intelligence, there's only so many times a normal, well-adjusted adult (not a child living in a man's or woman's body!) can take the shortcoming Simpsons jokes about Homer's chronic dumbness. For instance, as in Homer falling through the roof after preparing to hit Bart's fingers after Bart's rolled down the roof and wound up hanging from the gutter. Still, there's the part where Bart childishly fires a BB gun at Homer who's carrying bricks (so Jacka$$-like). Or, how about the eternally annoying line by that nuisance Nelson: ""Ha-ha!?"" All this is stupid, and if you're an adult and disagree, then you're so sophomoric that it's not even cute anymore!!!!Regarding decorum, again, there's only so many times any sane, well-adjusted adult (man or woman) should be able to tolerate coarse references that are commonplace in Simpsons land. In example, Bart's caught drinking by Marge while in a motel, and he chugs down the whole bottle while being chased; the bus driver smokes pot from a bong upon thinking the end is near; and the town drunk, Barney, is dumped into the lake along with beer bottles, celebrating the unsophisticated joke that he's so inebriated, he's raiding even a stash of empty beer bottles. One would think that most adults would be able to proverbially sophisticate themselves to a point where lowlife jokes about drunkenness don't seem that sharp or funny anymore.Regarding non-originality, well-adjusted adults shouldn't accept the redundancy of the characters/plot lines. Cletus being portrayed as a southern-sounding, slack-jawed hick/yokel which blatantly insinuates an attack on conservatives, as Groening glaringly sees red-staters like this; Homer the fata$$ imbecile who always screws up (in the movie's case by dumping toxic waste into the lake); Bart continuously being the troublemaker by committing mischief such as nude skateboarding; and jeering at organized religion (Grampa having a religious experience of ecstasy while at church) are all a derivative and boring rehashing of tangents seen on the TV show years ago. If you're over 18 and still entertained by this, you must have attention deficit disorder or something.Another, equally indisputable implication against this film that proves my thesis of its profane juvenility is the overkill of unwholesomeness together with obscenities of a grade-school level. For instance, there's many references to slang terms for male genit*ls (wiener and doodle, slang terms for female mammary glands (b*obs), uses of ""a$$,"" the word ""cr*p,"" and even some G*damns just for sport. On the unwholesomeness side, fat kid Ralph is hoisted up a flagpole so we see his bare buttocks, two men kiss before rushing into a hotel room to flagrantly get busy in g*y sex (this occurs when Marge assumes two cops have arrived to catch her), and Homer sophomorically commenting, ""More than two shakes and you're playing with yourself (relating to shaking off one's p*nis after urination).""Bottom line and conclusion: I've now utterly substantiated my thesis that only kids/teens or puerile adults are ones who should naturally get gratification out of the Simpsons. If you're grown-up and defy this fact, you're likely developmentally retarded.",1,"Title: Is it Juvenile...D-OH, YES! Is it beneath a well-adjusted Adult's Mentality...D-OH, YES!

655466,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00005JPQZ,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 3]","""The Simpsons"" is the longest-running TV sitcom ever.  Its network run has surpassed those of ""M*A*S*H"" (11 seasons), ""My Three Sons"" (12 seasons), and even ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" (14 seasons).  About to enter its nineteenth season in prime time, this cartoon series shows no signs of old age.With the proliferation of animated films that has come to multiplexes in recent years, it was inevitable that Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, Maggie Simpson and their friends and neighbors would find themselves in a feature film.  ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a very funny continuation of the family's adventures, complete with Homer's buffoonery, Bart's devilishness, Lisa's do-goodedness, and Maggie's virtuosity on the pacifier.Homer brings a pig home for a pet, stores its droppings in a homemade silo in the back yard and then, prompted by Marge to get rid of the leaking eyesore, dumps it into Lake Springfield, causing an environmental emergency so dire that the government steps in with an iron hand and questionable efficiency.  The plot includes a giant dome, an angry mob, and a touchy-feely session with an Inuit with magical powers during a journey to the ""country"" of Alaska.As in the weekly TV series, the movie has its share of witty barbs directed against governmental expediency, abuse of authority, political correctness, and even Fox's own in-your-face promotion.  But these are blended in with the movie's many gags, visual and verbal.  Sitting in the theatre, laughing vigorously along with the rest of the packed audience, I realized why we love the Simpsons.  The family is not the average American family, as so many sitcoms have tried to represent.  Rather, the Simpsons are a comically dysfunctional family bonded by their love and perseverance to get through the day, no matter what.  This is something we can all identify with.Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, and Hank Azaria provide the familiar voice talent.  Guest voice star Albert Brooks plays officious EPA bigwig Russ Cargill.What makes the film so engaging is the focus on the five family members, rather than sprinkling subplots in a million directions to include every character who's ever appeared on the show. I confess, however, that I did miss the sullen personalities of Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma.  Salary demands?  The story is cohesive, easy to follow, and has its share of suspense as well as hilarious moments.There are a number of self-targeted jokes in the movie.  As the 20th Century-Fox logo looms majestically, little Ralph Wiggum, standing atop the logo, vocally accompanies the fanfare.  Homer turns to the audience shortly into the film and exclaims, ""I can't believe anyone would pay for something they can see on TV for free.""  Bart writes on the blackboard, ""I will not illegally download this movie.""  And so it goes.If you recall the 1980 film, ""Airplane!,"" you'll have an idea of the film's structure:  zillions of gags with a basic story line tossed in.  The story is more clearly defined in ""The Simpsons Movie,"" but the final film looks as if huge emphasis was placed on keeping things light and funny.  The writers and director David Silverman have succeeded in making ""The Simpsons Movie,"" joke for joke, one of the funniest films of 2007.Simpsons fans simply must see the movie.  For the rest of us, it's a true romp -- a wickedly clever movie that can be enjoyed on many levels.  It's great fun for kids, who will feel superior to and chuckle at Homer's lamebrained exploits, and adults will appreciate the bits of satire and cultural references.Rated PG-13 for its irreverence, ""The Simpsons Movie"" offers viewers a comedy roller-coaster ride.  At under ninety minutes, the film leaves us laughing without overstaying its welcome.

655468,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPQZ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[15, 25]","""The Simpsons Movie"" is, in a word, hilarious.I had a number of fears when I first heard they were finally bringing the animated television sitcom to the big screen.Frequently, when a half-hour long sitcom does an hour long ""special"", the longer format is made up of two episodes strung together. Would ""The Simpsons Movie"" be simply three episodes strung together to masquerade as a feature length film? Thankfully, it isn't. They have taken a larger theme, the pollution of the environment, and give each of the characters an overall piece of this main story while they deal with problems and situations of their own. Most of these are also connected to the environment. This allows them to tie all of the stories together and to give all of our favorite characters a piece of the pie.Would the film reflect the quality of the series currently or actually be funny?The environment? ""Well, that sounds awfully ""After School Special"" you might say. You would be wrong.  One of the things I love about the first, oh say, ten years of the series, is how madcap the series was. Big emphasis on `was'. One moment, the family would be doing one activity, lampooning a handful of different pop culture references, then they would be on to another madcap thing, lampooning a whole different set of pop culture references. Better yet, the story connected these moments Now, the story movies from point A to point B with a couple of jokes thrown in.In ""Movie"", they use the environment as a framework allowing all of the characters in the family and the entire town of Springfield, to interact and highlight their comic personalities. The story drives the film, allowing the characters to bring their own personalities to the dilemma. This brought back memories of some of my favorite episodes, episodes in which Homer & Marge visit a candy convention and Homer becoming the poster child for sexual perverts everywhere, or Homer deciding he doesn't want to go to church and starting his own religion something God apparently approves of, or Lisa's need for braces driving Homer to become the head of his union and going head to head with Mr. Burns. There are so many classic episodes of ""The Simpsons"" it would be impossible to list them all. What do these classic episodes have in common? They take no prisoners. One moment, they might be making fun of Hollywood, the next religion, and it all works because they have created a story that can handle wildly divergent ideas. ""Movie"" follows this formula. Using the environment as an overall theme, they take jabs at religion, celebrity spokespeople, Hollywood, politics and ""An Inconvenient Truth"".""Movie"" is hilarious and has a lot of laughs packed into its 90 minute running time. But it isn't a laugh a minute. There are a couple of moments when the story takes over and the filmmakers try to make Marge and Homer's relationship dramatic. These moments work, but they cut through the comedy like a knife through butter.The filmmakers have taken the familiar landscape of Springfield and our favorite television characters and given them a suitable big screen upgrade. They have maintained the largely 2-D look and feel of the series but have given it a larger depth. Some scenes have striking shadows added to give the film a more artistic look. The family travels to a new state and this area is depicted in a beauty that would not have been possible with the constraints of a television schedule or budget.They have even incorporated the use of CGI. Much like in a Disney film, the animators use CGI to control the crowds or to give the action a little more fluidity in certain scenes. In one scene, the camera tracks through an angry mob and this was done with the aid of CGI. The characters are also given a slightly different appearance. The lines used to draw them appear thicker, giving them a slightly more rounded quality.""Movie"" tries to incorporate all of the characters at some point or another and this gives the entire great voice cast an opportunity to show off their skills. Because this is a feature length film, the story explores the relationships between certain characters more fully and allows the voice actors to show off why they have helped to make the series so memorable for so many years.The story?

655469,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPQZ,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 5]","I have not laughed this hard in a theater in years. Yes, The Simpsons' big screen debut is really that good. While it isn't as mind-boggling as ""South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut,"" it kicks off with Homer snidely blowing off all of us in the movie seats and never lets down the momentum. Where the South Park movie took its screen time to move past the 30-minutes of formulaic writing (and was brilliant because of that), ""The Simpsons Movie"" is basically an extended episode, with Bart flashing the crowd and Marge uttering a curse word.Not that there's anything wrong with that. The plot is basic Simpsons. Homer screws up, Marge doubts their marriage, Lisa finds love, Bart and Homer save the day. But the real revelation is that Ned Flanders becomes a sympathetic character. Bart gets despondent when Homer takes on Spider Pig, and discovers the world of parenting by running to Ned's door. In the past, Ned has been the object of derision, and for the first time he is given an extensive fleshing out. It's probably this film's greatest expansion.Of course, Ned doesn't get the final say. That belongs to Bart and Homer (and in the very funny closing credits - DON'T LEAVE TILL THEY ARE DONE - Maggie), and Homer and Marge. The usual cascade of satire and irreverence flows non-stop and all the characters show up. (I did miss Shawn Colvin's bit as Ned's girlfriend, though.) Pop culture jokes are everywhere, so the gamut of ""funny"" runs from slapstick that the little ones will laugh at to slightly more risque things for us grown-up types. (Like the evil empire rodent crack, or Homer flipping through a Bible and shouting ""This book doesn't have any answers!"")I even must admit that I have not watched much of the last few seasons of The Simpsons on TV. But this still made me laugh long and hard. All the Saturday Night Live knock-offs and creepy loser redneck movies have not been consistent enough to hold the laughs (sorry, Larry the Cable Guy and Will Ferrell) at any sustainable level. With so few movies able to make me do that anymore, ""The Simpsons Movie"" deserves all five of its stars.",5,"Ned Flanders, Super Dad?",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2107,"['have', 'not', 'laughed', 'hard', 'theater', 'years', 'Yes', 'Simpsons', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'really', 'good', ""n't"", 'as', 'mind-boggling', 'South', 'Park', 'Bigger', 'Longer', 'Uncut', 'off', 'Homer', 'snidely', 'blowing', 'off', 'movie', 'seats', 'never', 'down', 'momentum', 'Where', 'South', 'Park', 'movie', 'took', 'screen', 'time', 'move', '30-minutes', 'formulaic', 'writing', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'basically', 'extended', 'episode', 'Bart', 'flashing', 'crowd', 'Marge', 'uttering', 'curse', 'word.Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'plot', 'basic', 'Simpsons', 'Homer', 'up', 'Marge', 'doubts', 'marriage', 'Lisa', 'love', 'Bart', 'Homer', 'save', 'day', 'real', 'revelation', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Bart', 'despondent', 'when', 'Homer', 'Spider', 'Pig', 'world', 'parenting', 'running', 'Ned', 'door', 'past', 'Ned', 'been', 'object', 'derision', 'first', 'time', 'given', 'extensive', 'fleshing', 'out', 'probably', 'film', 'greatest', 'expansion.Of', 'course', 'Ned', ""n't"", 'get', 'final', 'say', 'Bart', 'Homer', 'very', 'funny', 'closing', 'credits', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LEAVE', 'TILL', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'DONE', 'Maggie', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'usual', 'cascade', 'satire', 'irreverence', 'non-stop', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'did', 'miss', 'Shawn', 'Colvin', 'bit', 'Ned', 'girlfriend', 'though', 'Pop', 'culture', 'jokes', 'are', 'everywhere', 'gamut', 'funny', 'runs', 'slapstick', 'little', 'ones', 'will', 'laugh', 'slightly', 'more', 'risque', 'things', 'grown-up', 'types', 'evil', 'empire', 'rodent', 'crack', 'Homer', 'flipping', 'Bible', 'shouting', 'book', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'even', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'much', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'Simpsons', 'TV', 'still', 'made', 'long', 'hard', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'knock-offs', 'creepy', 'loser', 'redneck', 'movies', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'consistent', 'enough', 'hold', 'laughs', 'sorry', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'sustainable', 'level', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'able', 'make', 'do', 'anymore', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Lobascio,"[1, 3]","Given Hollywood's ongoing desire to turn every hit TV show into a movie-- it's hard to believe that it took something as popular as The Simpsons 18 years to make their first leap onto the big screen...And all I can say is: It was worth the wait...The Simpsons Movie finds Homer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), rescuing a pig from certain death, bringing it home to raise as a house pet--over the objections of Marge (voiced by Julie Kavner). One leaky silo full of pig poop into the town's water supply later - and you have an environmental disaster the likes of which Springfield has never seen. Soon the entire town turns into a vengeful mob, heading straight for the Simpson household. As the family makes a narrow escape, they soon finds themselves divided by conflict.The citizens of Springfield have every reason to be very angry. The events triggered by Homer has drawn the attention of U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger (voiced by Harry Shearer) and Environmental Protection Agency chief Russ Cargill (voiced by Albert Brooks). Cargill tells the president that he has a plan to contain the disaster.The ""plan"" Cargill puts into motion means the end of Springfield...Can Homer save his marriage, repair his fractured family, and rescue the town he calls home from certain doom?The movie is a riot! Written by series creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks--along with a gaggle of the show's most talented writers--the screenplay offers us plenty of good old fashioned belly laughs. I think the film does the impossible: It will please not only fans who have been with the show since day one--but also those folks who may have been away for awhile and new fans as well. The main plot of the film works because those responsible didn't mess with the tried and true formula of their past success.Many of the best episodes of the series have Homer screwing up and then having to make good--The film does just that--but with a much bigger canvas. The PG-13 rating also allows for a few more adult oriented gags--seeing Bart (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) buck naked on his skateboard for example. Thank goodness the flick also has plenty of that wicked topical satire that is a staple of the series..Subplots involving Lisa (voiced by Yeardley Smith) finding a boyfriend and neighbor Ned Flanders getting closer to Bart provide a few chuckles. You'll also hear vocal cameos from Billie Joe Armstrong, Tre Cool, Mike Dirnt--Better known as the rock band Green Day--and Oscar winner Tom Hanks...I have to say, I expected there to be a few more star studded cameos given the circumstances though...The film is a winner! It's only fault is that it does drag a bit in the middle but fortunately the pace picks right back up and it's conclusion is worth it. To get the most bang for your movie buck--Be sure to stay right through the end credits for truly funny stuff.I close with one suggestion as the producers move forward--More Mr. Burns and Smithers in the sequel!

You can touch it, feel it. You can see it. Your friends can see it, so it's really there. You can experience it any time. You dreamed about it, but you never thought it would be there. The countless fans of ""The Simpsons"" have been dreaming of a theatrical film for more than a decade, and now, 18 years after the debut of one of television's most beloved series, it makes the leap to the big screen perhaps more gracefully than any TV show has ever done.Part of the appeal of the film is that it feels like you're watching a long episode of ""The Simpsons,"" and yet what you're watching is unmistakably a genuine film. For one thing, the animation's changed; computers were used in part to animate the film. It hasn't changed too much, though; fans may rest. Otherwise, though, everything you love about ""The Simpsons"" remains intact: all your favorite characters, from Apu to Chief Wiggum, all your favorite places, from Springfield's church to Monty Burns' estate, and all that moronic yet inexplicably brilliant humor.Like the episodes of the series, the plot of ""The Simpsons Movie"" takes a number of absurd twists and turns, but in its most nonsense-resistant form, it involves Homer Simpsons polluting Springfield's water to the point where the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) places an indestructible dome over the town, trapping its colorful residents within. It doesn't sound like it could last through a feature-length film, but there's more than enough jokes and similar ridiculousness to keep you laughing well through the film. In fact, very, very few of the jokes fall flat, a worry of those fans who admit that the series' hilarity has been decreasing over the past few years.

The creators and writers said they wanted to make sure that when they brought America's favorite prime time animated family to the big screen that it would be done right.  Many past writers were brought back to flesh out the story and enliven the characters.  Most of it was done under a veil of secrecy.  Over 150 different drafts were written and copies of scripts were shredded after each scene was taped.  It was a massive undertaking, but for a show that has grown to include a massive cast of secondary characters it had to be that way.  And for the most part, the efforts to create THE SIMPSONS MOVIE were a success.In THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, Homer almost single handedly destroys Springfield while also threatening the existence of life on the rest of the planet.  Things start off simply enough with a Green Day concert that turns into a disaster.  Then the next day at church Grampa Simpson makes a prophecy of doom that seems to be a message sent by God.  Marge believes the message and tries to decipher the meaning while everyone else thinks Grampa was just rambling like the old man he is.  Lisa finds love with a new boy named Colin who shares the same passions as she does.  Meanwhile, Homer dares Bart to skateboard naked to Krusty Burger and Bart bares his ""doodle"" for the whole world to see.  It turns out to be the most embarrassing moment of Bart's life.  He starts to view Homer in a negative light and see Ned Flanders as the kind, loving, and caring father that he is.  Later, Homer saves a pig from being slaughtered by Krusty and names him Spider-Pig. Ignored by many, the pig is part of Grampa's prophecy and signals a terrible government sanctioned disaster that forces the Simpsons to become fugitives in Alaska and wipe out all life in Springfield.  Homer finds himself at a major crisis.  He realizes that since he's the cause of all the trouble, he's the only one who can save Springfield and in doing so perhaps restore his relationship with his family.I enjoyed THE SIMPSONS MOVIE. I thought it was both funny and witty.  I especially enjoyed some of the nods and touches to long time fans of the series.  The movie basically feels like a super-extended episode of the show, but with clearer and brighter visuals.  That is perhaps the movie's biggest draw and its biggest flaw at the same time.  Non-fans of the show might become attracted to the show through the film, but die-hard fans of the show might feel disappointed because overall the movie doesn't appear more than an extended regular episode of the show that just looks better.

While the film no doubt seeks to offer some upbeat action, a humourous satire/take at environmentalism, and take risks in being a film that might have ""family"" appeal but get away with situations best suited for PG-rated films from the 70s and early 80s. The insanity is said to be within seasons 1-9 but the feel of the film has something of modernity and hinted commercialism with its general appeal, uninteresting Spider-Pig gags, lack of involvement with some of the other secondary characters, and sometimes very fast pace.While this viewpoint is not something everything will not agree with, especially those who have only seen about 10 or 30 episodes in their lifetime, the grand scale and popularity of The Simpsons universe should have at least extended to about 95 to 110 so minutes long.

(Die hard for Curly,,, but equally as happy to watch Shemp...) Would you ever recommend to your friends that they rush out and catch SNOW WHITE MEETS THE THREE STOOGES?  I don't think you would. (For fun go to that movie on Amazon and see what kind of reviews that film got, you may just have to punch yourself in the head ) The reason is that Snow White Meets The Three Stooges,,, or any of the other full length Stooge movies, released a dozen years too late, are a mess. Filled with rehashed jokes and uninspired carbon copies of carbon copies of the once brilliant  once GREAT Three Stooges.Now, I will tell you how since the tender age of six I awaited a Simpson movie. In fact, I have a poster that I made myself, sometime around 1990 with some crude intrepreted drawings of Americas first family. Me and millions of fans waited. 18 years... Telling Matt G and co. that they were crazy for not making a movie. They kept saying ""no way."" Or at best giving us small doses of false hope for their own amusement.. (""The movie will be made when the series ends"" they said, knowing full well that the series would never end...)Now the movie has been made, run, released on DVD and available on cable. I feel like I did the first time I flipped on TNT to see that Snow White and The Three Stooges movie. Sure it was a grand spectacle in full color, but those vibrant reds and greens only gave more light to the fact that The Stooges were long past their prime. (And probably should have just stuck to the old time  black and white one reelers.I think that The Simpsons still deserve to be on TV, (yes they have settled for being just okay, and even being downright dull on occasion,, instead of being earth shatteringly brilliant like their hey day, but they still deliver a great every now and again...) The movie just used up way too much gas for me. Didn't like it and could hardly even pretend. My five year old kid likes it, so I don't mind watching it with him on FX,,, but I feel I'm doing him a disservice in some way. I was bored!

That's a very long time for fans to wait for a feature length movie, but the movie lived up to my expectations.  Some people are likely to view it as just a long episode; however, releasing it in theaters has allowed ""The Simpsons"" to push the envelope a bit.  Not that they haven't been doing so for 20 years!The plot is fairly linear, although it has enough side steps to satisfy fans of the show.  Springfield once again courts disaster - this time by having the most polluted lake in the country.  This premise is spun off into various directions that allow for tons of slapstick and sight gags, as well as some pointed comments on environmentalism and politics.  Most of the supporting characters that fans have come to love over the years have at least a few lines, but the Simpson family is front-and-center throughout.The theater I saw the movie in was packed with families, even though it's rated PG-13.  Some of the jokes appealed more to younger kids, such as Homer hammering himself in the eye and the ""Spiderpig Song.""  Some of the more sophisticated jokes scored with the adults.  Finally, there were enough gags that crossed all lines, particularly a rather risque shot involving Bart skate-boarding that drew gasps.  ""The Simpsons Movie"" probably isn't appropriate for very young children, what with a couple of sexual jokes, but it's not much worse than what is seen on tv regularly.""The Simpsons Movie"" is a real winner, which will appeal to many fans.

655484,A2MY72ANJ0Z1R1,B00005JPQZ,William Rozell,"[7, 13]","After season 7, the jokes of The Simpsons started to get stale and disappear, becoming the dry, preachy animated sitcom it is today. Well, it seems all the jokes that were missing from the contemporary seasons all turned up in the movie.Like most contemporary comedies, The Simpsons Movie is very funny for the first 30 minutes, then tapers off. The first half-hour is non-stop laughter--rather than spread all their ideas out, The Simpsons Movie is non-stop, one after the other, laugh out loud laughs until the brakes are suddenly slammed to a screeching halt. Once the main plot becomes more visible, the jokes die down, it becomes dramatic and definitely too preachy. You are forced to watch the unfunny events of the Simpsons family for the remainder of the flick while having the not-so-subtle political commentary shoved down your throat.The first part of the movie could be compared to early Treehouse of Horror episodes, where zany, non-canon, no-reason humor just comes at you non-stop, and would still be funny after the test of time. The remainder of the movie can be compared to the contemporary Treehouse of Horrors, where the jokes are more based on current events and won't be funny after a few years (the ""spiderpig"" joke stopped being funny after the first 50 times I saw it in the trailers). They also break the forth wall (commentating that they're in a TV show/movie) which is not funny when done by the Simpsons.Fans of Krusty, Monty Burns, Moe, Apu, and other secondary characters (as they often have the best jokes on the show, after Homer), look elsewhere. The movie focuses primarily on the 5 Simpson family members, and the remainder of the time usually on the new characters created for the movie (such as the unnecessary and unconvincing villain). Sideshow Bob fans, don't even bother.Worth a rental to see the beginning of the movie, once. Worth owning? Not unless you're a die-hard Simpsons fan (who still believes the show is funny even after season 7, when they jumped the shark with the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" cliffhanger).",2,"Funny the first 30 minutes, then dies off",1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,2055,"['season', '7', 'jokes', 'Simpsons', 'started', 'get', 'stale', 'disappear', 'becoming', 'dry', 'preachy', 'animated', 'sitcom', 'today', 'Well', 'jokes', 'were', 'missing', 'contemporary', 'seasons', 'turned', 'up', 'movie.Like', 'most', 'contemporary', 'comedies', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'very', 'funny', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'then', 'off', 'first', 'half-hour', 'non-stop', 'laughter', 'rather', 'spread', 'ideas', 'out', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'non-stop', 'one', 'other', 'loud', 'laughs', 'brakes', 'are', 'suddenly', 'slammed', 'screeching', 'halt', 'main', 'plot', 'more', 'visible', 'jokes', 'die', 'down', 'dramatic', 'definitely', 'too', 'preachy', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'unfunny', 'events', 'Simpsons', 'family', 'remainder', 'flick', 'having', 'not-so-subtle', 'political', 'commentary', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'early', 'Treehouse', 'Horror', 'episodes', 'where', 'zany', 'non-canon', 'no-reason', 'humor', 'just', 'non-stop', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'funny', 'test', 'time', 'remainder', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'contemporary', 'Treehouse', 'Horrors', 'where', 'jokes', 'are', 'more', 'based', 'current', 'events', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'few', 'years', 'spiderpig', 'joke', 'stopped', 'being', 'funny', 'first', '50', 'times', 'saw', 'trailers', 'also', 'break', 'forth', 'wall', 'commentating', ""'re"", 'TV', 'show/movie', 'not', 'funny', 'when', 'done', 'Simpsons.Fans', 'Krusty', 'Monty', 'Burns', 'Moe', 'Apu', 'other', 'secondary', 'characters', 'often', 'have', 'best', 'jokes', 'show', 'Homer', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'primarily', '5', 'Simpson', 'family', 'members', 'remainder', 'time', 'usually', 'new', 'characters', 'created', 'movie', 'such', 'unnecessary', 'unconvincing', 'villain', 'Sideshow', 'Bob', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother.Worth', 'rental', 'see', 'beginning', 'movie', 'once', 'owning', 'Not', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Simpsons', 'fan', 'who', 'still', 'show', 'funny', 'even', 'season', '7', 'when', 'jumped', 'shark', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'cliffhanger']",N/A

Now, I have never really considered the simpsons a kids cartoon (tv PG) with some adult humor and references, but the movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, it definitly has the adult content, taking certain things we assume from the TV show and actually showing them (i don't want to spoil them for anybody).
