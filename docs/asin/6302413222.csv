Conner ""earthsleep""","[0, 0]","I cannot begin to imagine all of the movies my moving eyes have gazed at while my hungry mind cringed at the idea of ever viewing again.  The number dare I say seems limitless but perhaps a couple times a year at best I come across something special; a movie that transcends its decade and speaks to something we can all identify with which is our fragility and need for a secure place our lives can be stationed in.  This is in fact what Final Approach is about (among other things).The film is about a test pilot of a new kind of aircraft for his day that finds himself after what seems to be a crash in one of those experimental aricraft in a doctor's office unable to recall his situation, his wherabouts, or even his name.  What proceeds is a personal journey into discovering not only the numerous details of his life and history but also what it was all for.Some may find the movie predictable but I nor any with me did not.  I can't say that the idea of the ending hadn't crossed my mind, but the details of the finale I was nowhere even close to predicting.If you love the bombastic explosions and hot bullets frying through tender tissues then you might wish to move along to another unsuspecting movie on that video shelf, however, if you desire something truly original, thought inspiring, and creative then may I suggest Final Approach.",5,Unique  Creative  Special,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1349,"['can', 'not', 'begin', 'imagine', 'movies', 'moving', 'eyes', 'have', 'gazed', 'hungry', 'mind', 'cringed', 'idea', 'ever', 'viewing', 'again', 'number', 'dare', 'say', 'limitless', 'perhaps', 'couple', 'year', 'best', 'come', 'something', 'special', 'movie', 'decade', 'speaks', 'something', 'can', 'identify', 'fragility', 'need', 'secure', 'place', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'stationed', 'fact', 'what', 'Final', 'Approach', 'other', 'things', '.The', 'film', 'test', 'pilot', 'new', 'kind', 'aircraft', 'day', 'what', 'be', 'crash', 'one', 'experimental', 'aricraft', 'doctor', 'office', 'unable', 'recall', 'situation', 'wherabouts', 'even', 'name', 'What', 'personal', 'journey', 'discovering', 'not', 'only', 'numerous', 'details', 'life', 'history', 'also', 'what', 'was', 'for.Some', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'predictable', 'did', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'idea', 'ending', 'had', ""n't"", 'crossed', 'mind', 'details', 'finale', 'was', 'nowhere', 'even', 'close', 'predicting.If', 'love', 'bombastic', 'explosions', 'hot', 'bullets', 'frying', 'tender', 'tissues', 'then', 'might', 'wish', 'move', 'along', 'unsuspecting', 'movie', 'video', 'shelf', 'however', 'desire', 'something', 'truly', 'original', 'thought', 'inspiring', 'creative', 'then', 'may', 'suggest', 'Final', 'Approach']",N/A

It was recommended by a friend and I have to say I was put off a bit reading the back of the video box - it made it seem like an ordinary action film. No way - the opposite - an intelligent, sometimes funny but ultimately cool film. The acting, along with the script is superb but I would say its not for everyones taste.",5,Not many films like this!,990316800,"05 20, 2001",2001,345,"['Wow', 'What', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'bit', 'reading', 'back', 'video', 'box', 'made', 'seem', 'ordinary', 'action', 'film', 'way', 'opposite', 'intelligent', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'cool', 'film', 'acting', 'script', 'superb', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'everyones', 'taste']",N/A

310754,A2L7WYA5OENV03,6302413222,Reticuli,"[12, 12]","This is the first all digital sound film ever made, originally developed as just a test bed for new digital sampling, editing, and ADR technologies; it developed into a psychological film with surprisingly good acting.  Everything about it actually gets better and better the further in you get.  By the time we're at the scenes with his wife and the bathtub, the directing of the actors is spot-on realistic.  The radio chatter is probably the most authentic of its type you'll ever hear, including references to the Tonopah Test Site where stealth tests have actually taken place.  There's probably more high quality SR-71 stock footage in this than any other tape you'll find.  My only complaint is that some of the ADR cockpit stuff is for a pilot who obviously doesn't look like the actor.  But that's something that can be overlooked on an experimental film with such a small budget.  There have since been other films that have used the same general story concept, but with a different framework, including a non-scifi French film that came out the year after this one did.  While some have said that one is a bit subtler, I'd still have to say Final Approach is even more of the art house picture.  The recent big budget incarnations of this concept, in my opinion, have just been horrible.  It's too bad this film might never get released on nonrental DVD...",5,Great Little-Known Experimental Film,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,1367,"['first', 'digital', 'sound', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'originally', 'developed', 'just', 'test', 'bed', 'new', 'digital', 'sampling', 'editing', 'ADR', 'technologies', 'developed', 'psychological', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'acting', 'Everything', 'actually', 'better', 'better', 'further', 'get', 'time', ""'re"", 'scenes', 'wife', 'bathtub', 'directing', 'actors', 'spot-on', 'realistic', 'radio', 'chatter', 'probably', 'most', 'authentic', 'type', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'including', 'references', 'Tonopah', 'Test', 'Site', 'where', 'stealth', 'tests', 'have', 'actually', 'taken', 'place', 'probably', 'more', 'high', 'quality', 'SR-71', 'stock', 'footage', 'other', 'tape', ""'ll"", 'find', 'only', 'complaint', 'ADR', 'cockpit', 'stuff', 'pilot', 'who', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'look', 'actor', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'experimental', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'used', 'same', 'general', 'story', 'concept', 'different', 'framework', 'including', 'non-scifi', 'French', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'one', 'did', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'bit', 'subtler', ""'d"", 'still', 'have', 'say', 'Final', 'Approach', 'even', 'more', 'art', 'house', 'picture', 'recent', 'big', 'budget', 'incarnations', 'concept', 'opinion', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'horrible', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'might', 'never', 'get', 'released', 'nonrental', 'DVD']",N/A
