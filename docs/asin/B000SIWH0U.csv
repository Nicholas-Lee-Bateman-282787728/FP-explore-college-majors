1086380,A26ZZAVN3C96P0,B000SIWH0U,Cookie Crawford,"[11, 12]","WARNING******************* THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS  ****************I like ""Macbeth"" the best of Shakespeare's plays, partially because at least I can understand it. I'm college educated but not an academic, and unfortunately, with Shakespeare I usually only get about half of what's being said. (I'm sorry; I'm not so up on my 17th Century allusions.) But the play ""Macbeth"" is swift, clear, comparatively short, and the piece's themes are within grasp. Also, if properly done, its scary...which is involving.I like when Shakespeare's plays are transported into non-traditional settings...THAT WORK. Moving this particular play to a modern-day, drug cartel environment -- as this version does -- doesn't quite snap into place, however.The main problem with this adaptation is its actors, all of who, I am sure, have been or will be effective in other roles. But if this play is about Macbeth, then it seems to me you should have a very strong personality playing that role. Sam Worthington is handsome-ish, which is always nice, but seems too placid and withdrawn. Even if this king needs prodding from his wife to seize the day, he's still supposed to be a hungry and driven type. Worthington is neither of those things. The characterization of Lady M laid out here doesn't serve Victoria Hill any better. First she's shown weeping at her dead son's grave, which is an interesting touch...but then how does that merge with her later (famous) claim that she's sooner dash that baby's brains out than break a promise to her husband? There is simply no dynamic between this couple that conveys a deep partnership or shared destiny. Or even a mutual, morbid greed.Just about the only addition to this version I liked was that King Duncan is put up in a separate guest house on the Macbeth's property when he visits, which allows for some sneaking around in the dark, and explains why the other guests don't hear anything. But in an example of how this setting doesn't serve the text, since everyone else is killed with guns, why would Macbeth and his wife choose to stab their guest to death??? It just seems awkward. (And why does everyone think it's natural for Banquo's sons to turn into a long line of drug ""kings""; aren't most cartels wiped out before they become multi-generational?) Similarly, how can Macbeth repeatedly call the three witches ""hags"" when they're nubile centerfolds rolling around in bed with him? And how did all the gross ingredients get into Macbeth's kitchen for the ""Double double / Toil and trouble"" scene? It makes more sense if Macbeth travels to meet them on their own turf for that, as originally written. (There's also something more sinister and isolated about his having to travel into an otherworldly wasteland to see them.)The final problem (which also crops up in Roman Polanski's FAR FAR superior version) is that many of the monologues are superimposed in voice-over while we watch closeups of the actors. There's something transporting and glorious about watching really well-trained actors dive into these speeches...but to watch a solemn face as the lines are recited on a separate track? Why bother?",2,Something Ho-Hum This Way Comes.....,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3149,"['WARNING*******************', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', '****************I', 'Macbeth', 'best', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'partially', 'least', 'can', 'understand', ""'m"", 'college', 'educated', 'not', 'academic', 'unfortunately', 'Shakespeare', 'usually', 'only', 'get', 'half', 'what', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'up', '17th', 'Century', 'allusions', 'play', 'Macbeth', 'swift', 'clear', 'comparatively', 'short', 'piece', 'themes', 'are', 'grasp', 'Also', 'properly', 'done', 'scary', 'involving.I', 'when', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'are', 'transported', 'non-traditional', 'settings', 'WORK', 'Moving', 'particular', 'play', 'modern-day', 'drug', 'cartel', 'environment', 'version', ""n't"", 'quite', 'snap', 'place', 'however.The', 'main', 'problem', 'adaptation', 'actors', 'who', 'am', 'sure', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'be', 'effective', 'other', 'roles', 'play', 'Macbeth', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'personality', 'playing', 'role', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'handsome-ish', 'always', 'nice', 'too', 'placid', 'withdrawn', 'Even', 'king', 'prodding', 'wife', 'seize', 'day', 'still', 'supposed', 'be', 'hungry', 'driven', 'type', 'Worthington', 'things', 'characterization', 'Lady', 'M', 'laid', 'out', 'here', ""n't"", 'serve', 'Victoria', 'Hill', 'better', 'First', 'shown', 'weeping', 'dead', 'son', 'grave', 'interesting', 'touch', 'then', 'how', 'merge', 'later', 'famous', 'claim', 'sooner', 'dash', 'baby', 'brains', 'out', 'break', 'promise', 'husband', 'simply', 'dynamic', 'couple', 'deep', 'partnership', 'shared', 'destiny', 'even', 'mutual', 'morbid', 'greed.Just', 'only', 'addition', 'version', 'liked', 'was', 'King', 'Duncan', 'put', 'up', 'separate', 'guest', 'house', 'Macbeth', 'property', 'when', 'sneaking', 'around', 'dark', 'why', 'other', 'guests', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'example', 'how', 'setting', ""n't"", 'serve', 'text', 'everyone', 'else', 'killed', 'guns', 'why', 'would', 'Macbeth', 'wife', 'choose', 'stab', 'guest', 'death', 'just', 'awkward', 'why', 'everyone', 'think', 'natural', 'Banquo', 'sons', 'turn', 'long', 'line', 'drug', 'kings', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'cartels', 'wiped', 'out', 'become', 'multi-generational', 'Similarly', 'how', 'can', 'Macbeth', 'repeatedly', 'call', 'three', 'witches', 'hags', 'when', ""'re"", 'nubile', 'centerfolds', 'rolling', 'around', 'bed', 'how', 'did', 'gross', 'ingredients', 'get', 'Macbeth', 'kitchen', 'Double', 'double', '/', 'Toil', 'trouble', 'scene', 'more', 'sense', 'Macbeth', 'meet', 'own', 'turf', 'originally', 'written', 'also', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'isolated', 'having', 'travel', 'otherworldly', 'wasteland', 'see', 'final', 'problem', 'also', 'up', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'FAR', 'FAR', 'superior', 'version', 'many', 'monologues', 'are', 'superimposed', 'voice-over', 'watch', 'closeups', 'actors', 'something', 'transporting', 'glorious', 'watching', 'really', 'well-trained', 'actors', 'dive', 'speeches', 'watch', 'solemn', 'face', 'lines', 'are', 'recited', 'separate', 'track', 'Why', 'bother']",Macbeth
1086381,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000SIWH0U,Grady Harp,"[33, 34]","It is refreshing to rest assured that Shakespeare remains a viable writer and no matter how his plays are manipulated or 'updated' or altered or interpreted, his majesty of the English language remains intact and the impact of his ideas and words sustain even the most bizarre reconsiderations.  Such, for this viewer, is the case of MACBETH as condensed for the screen by writer/actress Victoria Hill and directed with intensity and sensitivity of communication by Geoffrey Wright.  The result may seem to be a bloody mad feud suggesting a majority of the teen driven films of today, but consider the source: imagining Shakespeare's MACBETH without the gore would mean the meat had been removed.Transferred from Scotland to Melbourne, Australia, the well-known fight for kingship among the Scots is transposed to be the turf struggle for supremacy in the underworld gangland of Melbourne.  The script and the direction make this transposition work, using the original dialog from the play, placing it in the voices and bodies of an all-Australian cast, to the point that the allegiance of the actors as to place is far less important than the telling of a powerful tale of ambition.  Sam Worthington makes an enigmatic yet strong Macbeth, well paired by Victoria Hill as his conniving and ultimately mad wife Lady Macbeth: the two form a chemistry that serves the original intent of the author well.  The many characters who rise and fall in the wake of the ambition of Macbeth tend to blend a bit because of the condensation of the script, but Gary Sweet as the doomed Duncan, Steve Batoni as Banquo, and Lachy Hulme as Macduff are particularly fine. The three witches whose predictions drive the play here become nude seductresses and are well interpreted by Miranda Nation, Chloe Armstrong, and Kate Bell.The battle scenes are appropriately gruesome and the musical score that accompanies this film is an odd mixture of rock and piano transcriptions of Beethoven symphony movements.  With the bracing cinematography by Will Gibson it all works well.  Unfortunately the Shakespearean language can become lost with the heavy Aussie accents and subtitles would have been helpful.  But if your television set has that subtitle option available, this small defect can be overcome.  Yes, it helps to know the original play well in order to fully appreciate the transposition, but the script and cast and director make a fine case for involving even the uninitiated  into the power of MACBETH.

Unlike many of the Bard's other great plays, this one achieves much of its tremendous power through its focus and economy, which brings me to Worthington's version. Naturally I went to see it in the theater, not knowing what to expect. I was blown away. For years I had pondered writing a contemporary version of the Scottish play but this movie beat me to it. I think everything about it works really well. My only criticism is that the famous ""Tomorrow"" speech is relegated to the end of the movie and it is shortened. This is the only choice I did not appreciate. Otherwise, this version may attract converts to what I think is the greatest play ever written.

One of the best films I've seen in recent years.

1086393,A1ABOWFWGL9HQC,B000SIWH0U,"wahzoh ""wahzoh""","[1, 1]","I know that's an odd title for a review of ""MacBeth"", but it's true -- this particular production really brought home to me that long, long after I am dead and gone, new generations of actors and directors will be ""doing their thing"" with the Bard.  That is strangely comforting - a sort of brush with eternity.  I like, for example, that modern adaptations such as this one allow the actors to use their own native speech patterns - in this case, Aussie accents.  I appreciate that not everyone is trying to sound as if they're from the British Midlands, whether theyre Australians or Americans, or even Irish.This productions is a very different vision of the play, set in a drug-infested Australian gangland.  MacBeth is a sort of evil, impish fellow with greasy hair, and his wife is a twisted cheerleader.  Both are quite young.  Some of the ""updates"" are interesting, as when MacBeth returns to consult with the witches (here played as a trio of vandal high school ""bad girls"") and finds himself hooking up for a pretty steamy threesome.  Hoo-yah!  You won't be seeing that action on American network TV - on cable, maybe.I think it's interesting that so many ""modern"" adaptations of Shakespeare have armed their characters to the teeth with firearms (Luhrman's ""Romeo + Juliet"", the abominable Ethan Hawke ""Hamlet"", and this version of ""MacBeth"").  It sort of make me wonder if acting schools will even be teaching swordplay in the 21st century, or if classical actors will only learn how to jump out from behind a wall, blasting and grimacing. Or maybe the new generation of young directors has just had their heads so filled up with gunplay that they can't imagine any other kind of fight to the death.  I dunno.Some of the supporting actors in this were quite good, including MacDuff, Lady MacDuff, and Malcolm.  The violence can get pretty intense -- no punches are pulled with Duncan's assassination, or with the deaths of Lady MacDuff and her son.Good for a rent, I would say, but not something I'd buy.",3,Strangely Comforting,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,2016,"['know', 'odd', 'title', 'review', 'MacBeth', 'true', 'particular', 'production', 'really', 'brought', 'home', 'long', 'long', 'am', 'dead', 'gone', 'new', 'generations', 'actors', 'directors', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'thing', 'Bard', 'strangely', 'comforting', 'sort', 'brush', 'eternity', 'like', 'example', 'modern', 'adaptations', 'such', 'one', 'allow', 'actors', 'use', 'own', 'native', 'speech', 'patterns', 'case', 'Aussie', 'accents', 'appreciate', 'not', 'everyone', 'trying', 'sound', ""'re"", 'British', 'Midlands', 'theyre', 'Australians', 'Americans', 'even', 'Irish.This', 'productions', 'very', 'different', 'vision', 'play', 'set', 'drug-infested', 'Australian', 'gangland', 'MacBeth', 'sort', 'evil', 'impish', 'fellow', 'greasy', 'hair', 'wife', 'twisted', 'cheerleader', 'are', 'quite', 'young', 'updates', 'are', 'interesting', 'when', 'MacBeth', 'consult', 'witches', 'here', 'played', 'trio', 'vandal', 'high', 'school', 'bad', 'girls', 'hooking', 'up', 'pretty', 'steamy', 'threesome', 'Hoo-yah', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'action', 'American', 'network', 'TV', 'cable', 'maybe.I', 'think', 'interesting', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'adaptations', 'Shakespeare', 'have', 'armed', 'characters', 'teeth', 'firearms', 'Luhrman', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'abominable', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Hamlet', 'version', 'MacBeth', 'sort', 'make', 'wonder', 'acting', 'schools', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'teaching', 'swordplay', '21st', 'century', 'classical', 'actors', 'will', 'only', 'learn', 'how', 'jump', 'out', 'wall', 'blasting', 'grimacing', 'maybe', 'new', 'generation', 'young', 'directors', 'just', 'had', 'heads', 'so', 'filled', 'up', 'gunplay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'other', 'kind', 'fight', 'death', 'dunno.Some', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'including', 'MacDuff', 'Lady', 'MacDuff', 'Malcolm', 'violence', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'intense', 'punches', 'are', 'pulled', 'Duncan', 'assassination', 'deaths', 'Lady', 'MacDuff', 'son.Good', 'rent', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'buy']",Macbeth
