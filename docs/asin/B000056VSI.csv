The only thing that threatens to ruin his fun is his dad, who approves of surfing just as much as Johnny would approve of being bitten by a shark.  When the Kapahaalas make an unexpected move to Vermont, Johnny's father encourages him to make friends and do well at his new school.  But Johnny would rather daydream about surfing, and talk to his grandpa in Hawaii while wishing that he was there to surf under the sun, too.  Will Johnny ever get used to his new oceanless home?  Maybe, just maybe, he could find a way to surf WITHOUT the water.This is an okay movie.  Some parts were pretty unrealistic, and the whole ""father just doesn't understand"" thing can get just a teeny bit old sometimes, even though it makes things interesting.  There was nothing ""special"" about this movie.  It's mostly just a movie that you watch when there's nothing better to do.  Overall, I would only buy this movie if you're a die hard fan of Kirsten Storms (she's in it) or one of the other actors in it.  There are better tween movies out there, not to mention that you can watch them and ""Johnny Tsunami"" on Disney Channel for free.",3,Johnny Tsunami,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,1200,"['Johnny', 'Kapahaala', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'friends', 'beach', 'awesome', 'surfing', 'only', 'thing', 'ruin', 'fun', 'dad', 'who', 'surfing', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Johnny', 'would', 'approve', 'being', 'bitten', 'shark', 'When', 'Kapahaalas', 'make', 'unexpected', 'move', 'Vermont', 'Johnny', 'father', 'make', 'friends', 'do', 'well', 'new', 'school', 'Johnny', 'would', 'rather', 'daydream', 'surfing', 'talk', 'grandpa', 'Hawaii', 'wishing', 'was', 'there', 'surf', 'sun', 'too', 'Will', 'Johnny', 'ever', 'get', 'used', 'new', 'oceanless', 'home', 'Maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'surf', 'WITHOUT', 'water.This', 'okay', 'movie', 'parts', 'were', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'whole', 'father', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'just', 'teeny', 'bit', 'old', 'sometimes', 'even', 'things', 'interesting', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'movie', 'mostly', 'just', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Overall', 'would', 'only', 'buy', 'movie', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Kirsten', 'Storms', 'one', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'tween', 'movies', 'there', 'not', 'mention', 'can', 'watch', 'Johnny', 'Tsunami', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'free']",Johnny Tsunami VHS
