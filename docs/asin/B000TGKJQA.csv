It took me about 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie before I could get interested in the story. I also thought the acting seemed too scripted at times. I, however, did appreciate the message of the movie, which was to embrace life, and not let the past rule your future. Charlie from the ""Christmas Shoes"" is all grown up, but the death of his mother, and a fear he has had since 10 years old of losing his dad is keeping him stuck in the past.

However, some of the other reviewers mentioned that it didn't live up to The Christmas ShoesThe Christmas Shoes.  I agree with that as well.The story is not as deep as TCS was.  It is definitely worth renting to watch it through once.  After that, you can decide if you want to add it to your collection.  As for me, I am not sure if I will or not.  There are plenty of other horrible ""Christmas"" movies out there (Deck the Halls, Happy Feet, Christmas in Handcuffs, Christmas Do-Over, A Very Muppet Christmas and other low life trash), so this is definitely a better choice than those that I have listed.** SPOILERS - DO NOT READ FURTHER IS YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT **The one disappointing aspect of this story was Charlie's Dad.  He was never totally developed as a character.  He was also left 'hanging' at the end of the movie.  It seemed like everybody else was set for a Christmas Blessing except the Dad:- Nathan's Dad was getting his life back.- Nathan's Dad was also looking at new relationship.- Nathan and his girl were looking forward to a life together.- Nathan was returning to be a doctor- Charlie died but not in vain as his death gave somebody new life.Charlie's Dad lost everybody and everything.  It seems that he was going to wander off to continue his life as a lone drifter.  I realize that this is reality in life, but I was hoping for more since this is a Christmas movie (life can be depressing enough as it is).Watch it, enjoy it (as I do think it is worth watching) and then decide if you want to add it to your Christmas collection.",3,Worth renting - up to you as to owning it,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1649,"['rented', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'yesterday', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'status', 'However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Christmas', 'ShoesThe', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'agree', 'well.The', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'TCS', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'renting', 'watch', 'once', 'can', 'decide', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'horrible', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'there', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Christmas', 'Handcuffs', 'Christmas', 'Do-Over', 'A', 'Very', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'other', 'low', 'life', 'trash', 'so', 'definitely', 'better', 'choice', 'have', 'listed', '**', 'SPOILERS', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'FURTHER', 'IS', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'SEEN', 'IT', '**The', 'one', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'story', 'was', 'Charlie', 'Dad', 'was', 'never', 'totally', 'developed', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'left', ""'hanging"", 'end', 'movie', 'seemed', 'everybody', 'else', 'was', 'set', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'Dad', 'Nathan', 'Dad', 'was', 'getting', 'life', 'back.-', 'Nathan', 'Dad', 'was', 'also', 'looking', 'new', 'relationship.-', 'Nathan', 'girl', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'life', 'together.-', 'Nathan', 'was', 'returning', 'be', 'doctor-', 'Charlie', 'died', 'not', 'vain', 'death', 'gave', 'somebody', 'new', 'life.Charlie', 'Dad', 'lost', 'everybody', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'wander', 'off', 'continue', 'life', 'lone', 'drifter', 'realize', 'reality', 'life', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'depressing', 'enough', '.Watch', 'enjoy', 'do', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'then', 'decide', 'want', 'add', 'Christmas', 'collection']",The Christmas Blessing

Lane,"[44, 58]","Last night my sister found this at our local movie rental, and I was really excited because The Christmas Shoes broke my heart . . . in a good way. After watching this, however, all I can say is that it's interesting, enjoyable, and -- in a few places -- genuinely touching. I really wish they had done a better job with this. The plot is unfocused and flimsy. This guy Nathan (Neil Patrick Harris) loses a teenage boy on the operating table and is suddenly ready to give up his career as a doctor to return to his hometown and work in his widowed father's auto shop. To me, the motive for this sudden change was too weak. Perhaps if there had been a series of setbacks and dissapointments with his job . . . but they didn't make time for it. Soon he is attracted to a spunky young schoolteacher and starts dating her, not knowing that her health is in jeporady due to a bad liver. She is a lot like his mother was -- very compassionate, loves kids and helping people, etc; etc. His insecurities keep him from sharing with her about his decision to quit being a doctor, which causes problems in their relationship when she finds out later. Meanwhile Nathan and his dad have trouble understanding each other's needs, so there is some drama from that quarter. There are several underdeveloped and distracting sub-plots, the dialog is trite, and the scenes that were meant to be heartwarming usually get bogged down in syrip. But Neil Patrick Harris's bad acting during the last leg of the movie is the straw that breaks the cammel's back. He is able to potray Nathan as being attracted to his love interest, but he entirely fails to potray the emotions Nathan would have expirienced upon finding out she was very likely to die. There was no passion, no agony. . . just frusteration. They should have chosen a straight man for the role. I also missed the beautiful Christmas carols that were in The Christmas Shoes.

It's one thing to edit a book down to keep the movie within time guidelines, it's another to take a movie and start snipping away characters and plots for the sake of simply making a movie version.  Why make a movie version at all if you aren't going to stick with the author's characters and plot lines.  By the time all the snipping away of characters and plot lines were done with the book, a person who read the book had to not only take a double look...but a triple and a quadruple. The movie version has so many holes, it looked like swiss cheese.  Gone was Nathan's Grandma, gone was his sister Rachel, gone was Megan's parents, gone was Charlie's mother, gone was the fact that Nathan took new red shoes to his Mom's gravesite every year, gone was the fact that Nathan's dad was fixed up with Lydia by his Mother-In-Law (whom he lived with), gone was the lady with the neon cap that Meghan raced with...and her meaning in the story, gone was the fact that Meghan was younger than Nathan...and those are just some of the holes in the swiss cheese. Nor do I remember any bar scenes in the book and I don't believe that it was necessary for that to be put in the movie when there was a wealth about Charlie's Dad from the book that could have been used to identify who he was and what he was feeling.I am very grateful that I had read the book before I had seen this movie.  Otherwise, there is so much story and characters that I would have never known were missing....things than made added into the richness of ""The Christmas Blessing"" in the book form.  This was a cheesy, cheaply remake of a book that deserved so much more.  I can hardly believe that the author would sign her work over so that it could get so badly chopped up.Do yourself a favor.  Buy & read the book over wasting money on this dvd...you will be rewarded with a wonderful and meaningful story, as opposed to buying a cheaply made dvd.  Usually I donate movies that I don't want to keep to the library for either their use or for their sales to buy new books.  This dvd just may go in the trash can instead of the library donation pile.",1,So Disappointing If You Read The Book,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2220,"['reading', 'book', 'movie', 'such', 'disappointment', ""n't"", 'staying', 'dvd', 'collection', 'one', 'thing', 'edit', 'book', 'down', 'keep', 'movie', 'time', 'guidelines', 'take', 'movie', 'start', 'snipping', 'away', 'characters', 'plots', 'sake', 'simply', 'making', 'movie', 'version', 'Why', 'make', 'movie', 'version', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'stick', 'author', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'time', 'snipping', 'away', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'were', 'done', 'book', 'person', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'double', 'look', 'triple', 'quadruple', 'movie', 'version', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'looked', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'Gone', 'was', 'Nathan', 'Grandma', 'gone', 'was', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'gone', 'was', 'Megan', 'parents', 'gone', 'was', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'gone', 'was', 'fact', 'Nathan', 'took', 'new', 'red', 'shoes', 'Mom', 'gravesite', 'year', 'gone', 'was', 'fact', 'Nathan', 'dad', 'was', 'fixed', 'up', 'Lydia', 'Mother-In-Law', 'whom', 'lived', 'gone', 'was', 'lady', 'neon', 'cap', 'Meghan', 'raced', 'meaning', 'story', 'gone', 'was', 'fact', 'Meghan', 'was', 'younger', 'Nathan', 'are', 'just', 'holes', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'do', 'remember', 'bar', 'scenes', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'put', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'wealth', 'Charlie', 'Dad', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'identify', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'feeling.I', 'am', 'very', 'grateful', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'were', 'missing', '.things', 'made', 'added', 'richness', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'book', 'form', 'was', 'cheesy', 'cheaply', 'remake', 'book', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'author', 'would', 'sign', 'work', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'so', 'badly', 'chopped', 'up.Do', 'favor', 'Buy', 'read', 'book', 'wasting', 'money', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'wonderful', 'meaningful', 'story', 'opposed', 'buying', 'cheaply', 'made', 'dvd', 'Usually', 'donate', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'keep', 'library', 'use', 'sales', 'buy', 'new', 'books', 'dvd', 'just', 'may', 'go', 'trash', 'can', 'instead', 'library', 'donation', 'pile']",The Christmas Blessing
1089981,AXVKMYWNIHK7W,B000TGKJQA,"Terri ""3kids-at-home""","[12, 14]","I bought this movie because I already own The Christmas Shoes, and wanted to see the sequel. This movie was disappointing to me. It was okay, but mostly it didn't have anything to do with the first one. For one thing, on the Christmas Shoes, the shoes are left on Nathan's mother's grave at the end, and yet on the Christmas Blessing they are given to Good Will on accident while the father of Nathan is cleaning out his closet. This story involves Nathan, all grown up and being a doctor.. When Nathan loses a patient on the table, he decides to go home and visit his father. He becomes involved with a woman there, and then decides not to be a doctor anymore, and lies to her about his career. The movie jumps around too much, and doesn't get you absorbed until the end. Nathan meets Rob Lowe, the man who helped him pay for the red Christmas shoes at the ending. The movie is explained kind of choppy, like this review. I guess sometimes we just have to draw our own conclusion without watching the next movie. This one was one I wish I would've missed. Even my 8 year old liked the Christmas Shoes better than this movie.",2,The Christmas Blessing,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1125,"['bought', 'movie', 'already', 'own', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'wanted', 'see', 'sequel', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'okay', 'mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'thing', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'shoes', 'are', 'left', 'Nathan', 'mother', 'grave', 'end', 'yet', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'are', 'given', 'Good', 'Will', 'accident', 'father', 'Nathan', 'cleaning', 'out', 'closet', 'story', 'Nathan', 'grown', 'up', 'being', 'doctor..', 'When', 'Nathan', 'patient', 'table', 'go', 'home', 'visit', 'father', 'involved', 'woman', 'there', 'then', 'not', 'be', 'doctor', 'anymore', 'career', 'movie', 'around', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'get', 'absorbed', 'end', 'Nathan', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'pay', 'red', 'Christmas', 'shoes', 'ending', 'movie', 'explained', 'kind', 'choppy', 'review', 'guess', 'sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'watching', 'next', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Even', '8', 'year', 'old', 'liked', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'better', 'movie']",The Christmas Blessing
