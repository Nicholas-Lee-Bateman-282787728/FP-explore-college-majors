I couldn't remember where it was shot, but luckily enough, the description here on Amazon listed the location, so I had to get the DVD.This is a fun stand-up, and Sinbad talks about relationships, black culture (don't worry, you'll still get it even if you're white), family, and various other realms.  The comedy holds up well after all these years, but some younger kids may not fully get where Sinbad's coming from.  Regardless, everyone will get a kick out of this show.  You'll find it rather enjoyable, and for the cheap price, if you're thinking about getting it, you might as well go for it.

Not one swear word or inappropriate innuendo, totally family friendly, but so darned FUNNY that this left me in stitches.  Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out.  Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material.  This guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying, ""Yep, that's me!"" or ""I've done that!"" while rolling on the floor cracking up. The only thing that surprised me was that he didn't use ""We Want the Funk"" by Parliament as the song when he was musically describing what ""Funk"" was. But the song he used, ""To Be Real"" was good anyway.

Fresh always brings the funk so the end was great, but the rest of the DVD was even better. Sinbad is his most hilarious when just telling everyday conversations but he's even better when he's on vacation. This video made me once again confirm that I have GOT to get out of America to celebrate my next birthday (11/11/11 turning 30) and Aruba sounds pretty nice. Then again, it seems like Sinbad brings the party wherever he goes. (Judging from a recent celebrity travel article I read about him by Jae-Ha Kim, he really DOES have fun wherever he goes. I love that he enjoys visiting Chicago, too.) He talked about couples separating, leaving each other, sneaking and glancing at other fine people, the ratio of men to women, and all other fun stuff to laugh about on vacations. I laughed nonstop through this whole video, and I'd highly recommend buying it to watch again. I felt his pain about the post office workers, too, and I've been in that situation more times than I'd like to count. The vacation spot looked beautiful, and everybody looked like they were having a good time. I wish I was there to see it live.
