1264939,A1Q0CZZ4CUP748,B002E9HML0,David Stockett,"[5, 5]","I bought Hero of the Rails for my 2-year old.  He is an absolute Thomas fanatic!This movie does not dissappoint.  Initially, I was not a fan of the CGI.  After watching what seemed like endless hours of Thomas minatures and voiced-over character dolls in the older shows, it seemed that was the only proper way to watch Thomas.  The CGI would simply cause ""confusion and delay"".Was I wrong!  CGI breathes new life into this series.  The characters have lost that ""homey"" feel of the minatures, but this is more than made up for by the quality of the graphics.  The scenes flow very well, and I must admit, they hold your attention better than ""The Great Discovery"".The storyline is very believable: a broken-down and forgotten engine is made new again.  This seems to be a recurring theme in many Thomas episodes: Something old is made new.  Or, something old is worth keeping around, e.g., steam engines in the age of diesel.The characters are great!  Some of the voices are bit overboard, such as Gordon's ""High & Mighty"", and Henry's whine.  Spencer's voice is perfect, as are Hiro's and Emily's.  Personally, I don't care for Thomas's voice.  It seems a bit too youngish, but considering who this DVD is aimed at, it works for kids.  As was mentioned in an earlier post, Victor and Kevin are a match made in Heaven: the seasoned veteran and the new kid in the shop.  Perfect!Without getting too specific and spoiling the movie for all, I will just say this movie is great for kids and adults.

1264950,AJGTSAVL2W9M1,B002E9HML0,MeleKalikimaka,"[4, 4]","Hero of the Rails is a surprisingly effective movie that demonstrates the potential the Thomas series still has.Breaking from the usual plot formula of the show, Thomas finds an old engine left for scrap, and tries to repair him in secret. Meanwhile visiting engine Spencer is feeling sore from his competition with the Sodor engines, trying to sabotage them in any way possible.For a show that was admired for its trainset-come-to-life imagery, changing Thomas to a CGI show seems like a controversial move. However, Hero of the Rails shows the new medium being used to its full potential - wonderful scenery, dynamic ""camera"" work like tracking shots, and a new sense of scale in Thomas' world. In fact, one new setting is the Steamworks - a giant workshop modeled on several installations from the glory days of steam.There are new characters, too, and while often Thomas introduces new characters with little purpose other than merchandising potential, these seem like natural extensions of the Sodor world: Victor, the even-tempered workshop engine; Kevin, the Steamworks' accident-prone mobile crane, and Hiro, the abandoned engine whom Thomas and friends hope to restore.The movie's not without its flaws. For instance there's little regard for actual railway practice, which the older shows almost always adhered to. Finally there are times when the narrator keeps talking even though it's perfectly clear through the characters and on-screen action what's happening. It's not really adding anything other than repetitive rhyming and alliteration.Still, Hero of the Rails is a refreshing chapter in Thomas' history, and deserves a look.",4,Revitalizes a childhood classic,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,1644,"['Hero', 'Rails', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'movie', 'potential', 'Thomas', 'series', 'still', 'has.Breaking', 'usual', 'plot', 'formula', 'show', 'Thomas', 'old', 'engine', 'left', 'scrap', 'tries', 'repair', 'secret', 'Meanwhile', 'visiting', 'engine', 'Spencer', 'feeling', 'sore', 'competition', 'Sodor', 'engines', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'admired', 'trainset-come-to-life', 'imagery', 'changing', 'Thomas', 'CGI', 'show', 'controversial', 'move', 'However', 'Hero', 'Rails', 'new', 'medium', 'being', 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'wonderful', 'scenery', 'dynamic', 'camera', 'work', 'tracking', 'shots', 'new', 'sense', 'scale', 'Thomas', 'world', 'fact', 'one', 'new', 'setting', 'Steamworks', 'giant', 'workshop', 'modeled', 'several', 'installations', 'glory', 'days', 'are', 'new', 'characters', 'too', 'often', 'Thomas', 'new', 'characters', 'little', 'purpose', 'other', 'merchandising', 'potential', 'seem', 'natural', 'extensions', 'Sodor', 'world', 'Victor', 'even-tempered', 'workshop', 'engine', 'Kevin', 'Steamworks', 'accident-prone', 'mobile', 'crane', 'Hiro', 'abandoned', 'engine', 'whom', 'Thomas', 'friends', 'hope', 'restore.The', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'instance', 'little', 'regard', 'actual', 'railway', 'practice', 'older', 'almost', 'always', 'adhered', 'Finally', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'narrator', 'talking', 'even', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'characters', 'on-screen', 'action', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'really', 'adding', 'anything', 'other', 'repetitive', 'rhyming', 'alliteration.Still', 'Hero', 'Rails', 'refreshing', 'chapter', 'Thomas', 'history', 'look']",Thomas & Friends: Hero of the Rails - The Movie

(All the little kids bouncing around... popcorn flying... energy level sky-high...)But for the home, what you should know is that like in ""Thomas and the Great Discovery""Thomas & Friends: The Great Discovery, Thomas makes a discovery in this film, but this time it's not a place but a person that he finds!  The venerable Hiro, Master of the Rails.  Hiro, is an absolute delight, by the way.  He's an engine from Japan that came to Sodor before any other engines.  Unfortunately, because he was first, and because he came from so far away, when he broke down they put him on a sideline where he was soon forgotten. And this is where Thomas finds him.What makes Hiro delightful is that he finds the good in everyone: imperious Gordon, vain James, it doesn't matter.  This trait, of course, brings him friends.  And soon, all of our favorite steamies are trying to locate parts for him in an effort to make him whole-and-useful-- because they are afraid that he'll be scraped if they fail.Missing in this one is a certain devious diesel, so the crews' opposition is provided by egotistical Spencer, who annoys everyone with his boasting and shenanigans.  He turns out to be a pretty effective foil, having his way right up to the end, when Thomas emerges victorious and Spencer is not only humbled, but comes to regret his previous behavior.So as it turns out, ""Hero of The Rails"" is a story of friendship and trust, and redemption.Talking Points:::Moms like me will delight in the positive messages that are in this Thomas movie.  Thomas is hardly cheeky at all, and in fact, is patient, a good-sport, and even manages to 'turn the other cheek' when Spencer insults him.Though it's strange to see the human characters move, it is really great to see more than the Steamies' eyes move.  And though the animation is not Lucasfilms quality, the production features some great shots, like having a train roll over you, and seeing from Thomas' prospective what it looks like to go barreling down the tracks.The Music is awful, and that's all I'll say about that.  The voices, however, for the Steamies are good, although there could be more distinction between them.There are a few new characters.  Victor at the Works.  His fumbling assistant, Kevin, who isn't an engine, and Hiro, of course.All in all, this is a must-have flick at this point, because Thomas, Percy, Toby and the rest of the Crew are more alive than ever.Pam T!mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews",5,Bust My Boiler!
