313737,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,6302458900,"Astral ""Astral""","[2, 3]","I loved Don Bluth's movies as a kid, every single one up until Rock-a-Doodle.  It didn't interest me then, I found it to be quite boring and a jumbled mess when compared to his other films.  While searching for something to watch with my two girls (ages 5 and 7), I came across this and was hoping time would be kinder.  The movie is still a hodgepodge mess.This is a mishmash of the classic play about farm animals and the rooster that crows the sun up, Chantecler, and an Elvis musical.  These two things should have gone together better than the execution here.  If it had stuck more to the plot of Chantecler, it could have been a much more entertaining film, and again, if it had decided to be more firmly rooted in musical territory, it would have also succeeded more.  As it is, the plot is as weak as the limp-as-a-noodle songs.  The movie is heavily narrated by the basset hound farm dog (voiced by Phil Harris - who previously was the voice of Baloo in ""The Jungle Book"" and appeared in other Disney films).  He narrates over the songs, which kind of ruins the musical feel of the movie, not that the songs were worth noting in the first place.The characters are forgettable and the designs even worse, from Sandy Duncan's voice coming out of an unattractive mouse with huge glasses and bloomers to the avian rejects from The Secret of NIMH. Killer from ""All Dogs go To Heaven"" is reincarnated here as a tiny owl, the nephew to the main villain named The Duke.  The same voice actor doing the same character (Charles Nelson Reilly) and still just as useless and unamusing.  Our lost ""hero"", Chanticleer, has an Elvis pompadour hairstyle, huge upper body and comically tiny from the hips down.  Despite a great voice, both speaking and singing by Glen Campbell, his character comes off as being rather one dimensional and doesn't get a lot of screen time.  The story is more concerned with where he is, and where he should be than actually following its main character.  Most of the screen time is based around a real live boy turned kitten and thrown into his fairy tale book.  Apparently the rooster quitting his day job of singing the sun up, has not only affected the story world, but the real world as well.  The inclusion of the boy/kitten from the real world (who goes on and on about how small and useless he is) is a strange subplot that detracts from what's going on.  Why is he here?  Why are the animals helping him?  Why can the villainous owl shoot shapes out of his beak, grow to huge sizes and turn children into animated animals?  Why is the cat wearing a fringe jacket and a raccoon cap and looking like Davey Crockett?  None of this is particularly explained... despite the rambling narration that tries to fill in the gaps.The ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" connection doesn't show up in just the live/animated mixtures (which are seldom used, and when done, it's awkward to see).  The rooster's romantic interest is a watered down Jessica Rabbit with feathers and a squeaky voice.The stage rock productions could have been a saving grace, but even those are saddled with poor songs, and interruptions.  The plot is silly, the resolution isn't much better, none of the characters are likeable (even Sandy Duncan's mouse isn't memorable, and she always comes off as being as sweet as can be).  Rock-A-Doodle is sadly a film that has little direction in what it wants to be, and ends up being good at none of the thing it strive for, making it easy to see why it flopped in the first place.However, from a kid's perspective, my 5 year old enjoyed the movie, and went to bed with a smile on her face after watching it.  While little of the movie made sense to me, she had no problem with the bare bones of the plot and had few questions afterwards (why question a magic owl that wants eternal rain and night?).  The kids enjoyed it, and that's all that really matters, just don't expect a masterpiece with this one.",2,"Didn't Like it as a Kid, and It Hasn't Improved With Age...",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,3936,"['loved', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'movies', 'kid', 'single', 'one', 'up', 'Rock-a-Doodle', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'then', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'boring', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'searching', 'something', 'watch', 'two', 'girls', 'ages', '5', '7', 'came', 'was', 'hoping', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'kinder', 'movie', 'still', 'hodgepodge', 'mess.This', 'mishmash', 'classic', 'play', 'farm', 'animals', 'rooster', 'sun', 'up', 'Chantecler', 'Elvis', 'musical', 'two', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'together', 'better', 'execution', 'here', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'plot', 'Chantecler', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'again', 'had', 'decided', 'be', 'more', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'musical', 'territory', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'succeeded', 'more', 'plot', 'as', 'weak', 'limp-as-a-noodle', 'songs', 'movie', 'heavily', 'narrated', 'basset', 'hound', 'farm', 'dog', 'voiced', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'who', 'previously', 'was', 'voice', 'Baloo', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'appeared', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'songs', 'kind', 'ruins', 'musical', 'feel', 'movie', 'not', 'songs', 'were', 'worth', 'noting', 'first', 'place.The', 'characters', 'are', 'forgettable', 'designs', 'even', 'worse', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'voice', 'coming', 'unattractive', 'mouse', 'huge', 'glasses', 'bloomers', 'avian', 'rejects', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'Killer', 'All', 'Dogs', 'go', 'Heaven', 'reincarnated', 'here', 'tiny', 'owl', 'nephew', 'main', 'villain', 'named', 'Duke', 'same', 'voice', 'actor', 'doing', 'same', 'character', 'Charles', 'Nelson', 'Reilly', 'still', 'just', 'useless', 'unamusing', 'lost', 'hero', 'Chanticleer', 'Elvis', 'pompadour', 'hairstyle', 'huge', 'body', 'comically', 'tiny', 'hips', 'down', 'great', 'voice', 'speaking', 'singing', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'character', 'off', 'being', 'rather', 'one', 'dimensional', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'story', 'more', 'concerned', 'where', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'actually', 'following', 'main', 'character', 'Most', 'screen', 'time', 'based', 'real', 'live', 'boy', 'turned', 'kitten', 'thrown', 'fairy', 'tale', 'book', 'Apparently', 'rooster', 'quitting', 'day', 'job', 'singing', 'sun', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'affected', 'story', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'inclusion', 'boy/kitten', 'real', 'world', 'who', 'how', 'small', 'useless', 'strange', 'subplot', 'what', 'going', 'Why', 'here', 'Why', 'are', 'animals', 'helping', 'Why', 'can', 'villainous', 'owl', 'shoot', 'beak', 'grow', 'huge', 'sizes', 'turn', 'children', 'animated', 'animals', 'Why', 'cat', 'wearing', 'fringe', 'jacket', 'raccoon', 'cap', 'looking', 'Davey', 'Crockett', 'None', 'particularly', 'explained', 'rambling', 'narration', 'fill', 'gaps.The', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'connection', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'just', 'live/animated', 'mixtures', 'are', 'seldom', 'used', 'when', 'done', 'awkward', 'see', 'rooster', 'romantic', 'interest', 'watered', 'down', 'Jessica', 'Rabbit', 'feathers', 'squeaky', 'voice.The', 'stage', 'rock', 'productions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saving', 'grace', 'even', 'are', 'saddled', 'poor', 'songs', 'interruptions', 'plot', 'silly', 'resolution', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'even', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'mouse', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'always', 'off', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'sweet', 'can', 'be', 'Rock-A-Doodle', 'sadly', 'film', 'little', 'direction', 'what', 'be', 'up', 'being', 'good', 'none', 'thing', 'strive', 'making', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'flopped', 'first', 'place.However', 'kid', 'perspective', '5', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'went', 'bed', 'smile', 'face', 'watching', 'little', 'movie', 'made', 'sense', 'had', 'problem', 'bare', 'bones', 'plot', 'had', 'few', 'questions', 'afterwards', 'why', 'question', 'magic', 'owl', 'eternal', 'rain', 'night', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'matters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'one']",Rock-A-Doodle VHS

313746,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6302458900,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[4, 9]","I don't know what Don Bluth was thinking when he made this silly, nonsensical animated musical about a singing rooster, but I know what I'm thinking:  ""Why?""  ROCK-A-DOODLE isn't as depressing or dreary as Bluth's previous ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN, but it's not much better.The film tells the story of Chanticleer, a barnyard rooster with a golden voice whose crooning -- sorry, crowing -- makes the sun rise every day.  One morning, however, Chanticleer is attacked by a bully rooster; in the process he neglects his crowing duties and the sun comes up anyway.  After being laughed at by his friends, the disgraced rooster heads off to the city.  Then it starts to rain, and before long, all the animals are terrorized by both floods and the evil Grand Duke of Owls, who, it turns out, actually set up the whole thing simply because he dislikes the sun.  In arguably one of the few memorable lines this movie offers, he also sneers, ""I positively LOATHE rock and roll.""Naturally, the animals head off to the city to find Chanticleer, who, by this point, has become a famous star dubbed ""the King,"" with a greedy manager and a reluctant girlfriend, Goldie.  If the animals can bring Chanticleer back to the farm, the sun will once again rise and the floods will stop.  To prevent this, the Duke sends his clumsy (and unfortunately not very funny) nephew, Hunch (whose vocabulary mostly consists of rhyming with the word ""annihilation"") after the animals.The plot, such as it is, doesn't make the least amount of sense and is likely to baffle even the most intelligent of grown-ups.  Working against ROCK-A-DOODLE as a whole, however, is the haphazard and confusing execution.  It also suffers from the problem of a major identity crisis:  on one hand it tries to be a simplistic fairy tale, on the other it attempts to be a musical parody of Elvis (Chanticleer's rock star persona and his songs are very closely modeled after the legendary singer, from the slick hairdo to the deep voice and the mannerisms). However, it ultimately comes across as a hodgepodge of ideas crashing into each other.Furthermore, the characters, in addition to being unattractively designed, are not particularly compelling.  Chanticleer, while supplying a dead-on impression of Elvis Presley down to the voice and the singing (courtesy of Glen Campbell), is a two-dimensional lead.  His barnyard friends, which include Patou, a droopy canine unable to tie his shoes, Peepers, a bespectacled and lisping mouse, and Snipes, a zany magpie, do little to emerge as anything memorable, although the first two are well voiced by Phil Harris and Sandy Duncan, respectively.  Hunch, as mentioned, is unfunny, and useless.  That leaves the character of Goldie, Chanticleer's love interest, who is supposed to be a tough girl that eventually falls in love with our hero, but the screenplay doesn't give her much to do.  One suspects that she was included in this film just for the sake of a love interest.  As for the Grand Duke, he's little more than your typical scary, nasty, scheming bad guy, despite having the voice of Christopher Plummer.  And don't even get me started on where his supernatural powers (that enable him to grow to enormous size or transform anybody) came from.Where ROCK-A-DOODLE really falls apart is in its attempt to bookend the movie with live-action sequences.  The idea is to include a real-life little boy, Edmond, as one of the story's major protagonists.  Actually, he spends much of the film transformed as an animated kitten (a transition that feels very awkward and unnatural).  And whining about how he is unable to do anything as a result of being small.  Constantly.  This subplot feels like it was tacked onto the story, hence one gets the feeling that it came out of nowhere.There are also two live-action/animation sequences in the movie, but unlike WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, they come across as very patchy and unconvincing--the real-life surroundings don't mesh well with the drawings, and it looks especially bad at the song and dance finale when the kid actor playing Edmond, Toby Scott-Granger, is brought back to the cartoon world.  Speaking for the animation itself, it's pretty much below par, even for a Bluth production.Equally distracting is the narration that supplies most of the film.  Phil Harris has a great voice and does a credible job (although some might find it strange that the dog is recounting the whole thing).  The problem is that he narrates CONSTANTLY, even going far to chime in over some catchy songs sung by Chanticleer.  Considering that this film is supposed to be a musical, having Harris chime in every two minutes proves to be very distracting.  (The narration was apparently added on to prevent audiences from being confused, but why did they have to overdo it?)Probably the only things that come clean out of this mess are the voice work and the musical score by Robert Folk.  Campbell, Harris, Duncan, Plummer, and squeaky Ellen Greene (as Goldie) all do the best they can with their characters, although Toby Scott-Granger's childish speech impediment does get in the way of his portrayal of Edmond (although considering how weak his character is, it's no surprise he doesn't give a memorable performance).  The underscore, as mentioned, is also beautiful, far better than this movie has any right to be.  T.J. Kuenster's dozen songs, on the other hand, are mediocre to bad, particularly the owls' Bach-style numbers, although the ones for Chanticleer are admittingly a lot of fun.As entertainment, ROCK-A-DOODLE is mostly harmless fare for younger kids.  It has its funny moments, but anyone else older will find this to be uninspired and chaotic.  Considering that this is from the director of THE SECRET OF NIMH, AN AMERICAN TAIL, and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, though, its a disappointing endeavor.  Regrettably, after this movie, Bluth's output would only get worse, with the exceptions of THUMBELINA and ANASTASIA.",2,Rock-A-Doodle-What?

I used to watch this movie when I was younger and loved it, so I thought I'd give it another try. This movie was almost as good as I remembered. It is in the same vein as the other Don Bluth films, including All Dogs Go to Heaven, and is just a cute little movie that is really not well known. I heard that it has been discontinued, so if you stumble upon a copy like I did I recommend you snap it up quick (if you like that type of film). The animation is cute and the songs are kind of catchy. It doesn't have too many famous voices (except Phil Harris) but the voice acting is done very well. I plan on sharing this movie with my kids, both because it is enjoyable and because it shows how friends and confidence in yourself are important.
