Well that is my take on Joan Rivers view of her daughter, Melissa.I am a Joan Rivers fan.  I respect the longevity of her career and believe her to be a bright and talented comedienne and businesswoman.  What I do have a problem with is the foisting of Melissa Rivers on the general public.  I do understand that many celebs spawn children who go on to become celebs in their own right and some of them actually have genuine talent or something the general public wants to see but for the life of me, I don't understand why Joan has insisted for years in trying to make Melissa an on screen personality. Melissa, who seems to be an intelligent and well educated person just does not belong in front of the camera.  It's cool that Mom gives her producing jobs and has included her in her fashion critiquing shows but honestly would Melissa be anywhere in the entertainment biz as a personality if not for her Mom?  I've never seen a celebrity Mom who has gone through such lenghths to make her daughter into something she is not.  With that said, it's an enjoyable show even with Melissa.",4,"Good, Even with Melissa",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1263,"['How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'watch', 'videos', 'someone', 'annoying', 'kid', 'parent', 'child', 'fascinating', ""'re"", 'only', 'fascinating', 'parent', 'Well', 'take', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'view', 'daughter', 'Melissa.I', 'am', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'fan', 'respect', 'longevity', 'career', 'believe', 'be', 'bright', 'talented', 'comedienne', 'businesswoman', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'foisting', 'Melissa', 'Rivers', 'general', 'public', 'do', 'understand', 'many', 'celebs', 'spawn', 'children', 'who', 'go', 'become', 'celebs', 'own', 'right', 'actually', 'have', 'genuine', 'talent', 'something', 'general', 'public', 'see', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Joan', 'insisted', 'years', 'trying', 'make', 'Melissa', 'screen', 'personality', 'Melissa', 'who', 'be', 'intelligent', 'well', 'educated', 'person', 'just', 'not', 'belong', 'front', 'camera', 'cool', 'Mom', 'producing', 'jobs', 'included', 'fashion', 'critiquing', 'shows', 'honestly', 'would', 'Melissa', 'be', 'anywhere', 'entertainment', 'biz', 'personality', 'not', 'Mom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'celebrity', 'Mom', 'who', 'gone', 'such', 'lenghths', 'make', 'daughter', 'something', 'not', 'said', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'even', 'Melissa']",Joan and Melissa: Joan Knows Best?
