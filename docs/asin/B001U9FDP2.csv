I think that would be helpful and he could sell more DVDs....If you want to Squat, etc., (not ""squat....""), learn from the video and read Rip's works.",4,Excellent Book Companion,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,515,"['Rip', 'decoded', 'major', 'lifts', 'word', 'now', 'video', 'accompany', 'it.This', 'video', 'NOT', 'powerlifters', 'etc', 'Rip', 'teaching', 'various', 'sizes/types', 'people', 'Basics.The', 'ONLY', 'bone', 'can', 'pick', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Rip', 'select', 'various', '~3', 'sized', 'lifters', 'using', 'proper', 'form', 'analyze/explain', 'lifters', 'mechanics', 'using', 'working', 'weights', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'could', 'sell', 'more', 'DVDs', '.If', 'want', 'Squat', 'etc.', 'not', 'squat', 'learn', 'video', 'read', 'Rip', 'works']",Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training

I wanted to get back into lifting but wanted to learn the correct methods.I'm older now and didn't want to hurt myself with bad technique. When I first popped this into my DVD player I said ""what the...."".It's just the basic weight lifting moves. Bench, squat, press ect.Then I listened to what the trainer was saying and realized that was all that mattered.I realized that what I had been taught years ago by the local gym know-it-alls and others were wrong.Don't look at the quality of the video listen and watch what is being taught here.It would cost hundreds for an experienced personal trainer to teach you what you will learn in this DVD.It's better to learn correct technique now than try to fix it later.I'm very satisfied and I think you can learn something from this video if you are a beginner or have been lifting all your life.The video also features ladies learning too. So women should enjoy this also if they want to learn how to properly lift.",5,Really Great Video,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,999,"['had', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', '20', 'years', 'wanted', 'get', 'back', 'lifting', 'wanted', 'learn', 'correct', 'methods.I', ""'m"", 'older', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'bad', 'technique', 'When', 'first', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'said', 'what', '.It', 'just', 'basic', 'weight', 'lifting', 'moves', 'Bench', 'squat', 'press', 'ect.Then', 'listened', 'what', 'trainer', 'was', 'saying', 'realized', 'was', 'mattered.I', 'realized', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'taught', 'years', 'ago', 'local', 'gym', 'know-it-alls', 'others', 'were', 'wrong.Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'quality', 'video', 'listen', 'watch', 'what', 'being', 'taught', 'here.It', 'would', 'cost', 'hundreds', 'experienced', 'personal', 'trainer', 'teach', 'what', 'will', 'learn', 'DVD.It', 'better', 'learn', 'correct', 'technique', 'now', 'try', 'fix', 'later.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'satisfied', 'think', 'can', 'learn', 'something', 'video', 'are', 'beginner', 'have', 'been', 'lifting', 'life.The', 'video', 'also', 'ladies', 'learning', 'too', 'women', 'should', 'enjoy', 'also', 'want', 'learn', 'how', 'properly', 'lift']",Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training

It is very useful to have both it and the book too.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.
