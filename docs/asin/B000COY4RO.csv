Suffering with the loss of relationship between parent/child or man/woman is just as great a loss and struggle. Christmas brings the loss back, but sometimes with HOPE. This Hallmark Hall of Fame story, taken from the novel by Lauanne Rice, is such a story of loss and hope, of loss and struggle, of loss and the miracle of recovery. That is also what Christmas is.  Christmas is about finding ""Silver Bells"" in life when life's path is difficult.It doesn't take a Christmas tree farmer to discover hope.  Can Christy?  Christy Byrne is the macho but lovable tree farmer with two children, trying to hide his struggle after losing his wife by her death.  Along the journey into the street of New York City, to sell his trees, with the help of his son and daughter, they all encounter others, each with a need, a loss, a relationship needing hope.It is a love story, made delightful through the written words of best-selling author Luanne Rice.  It is also a hope story made perfect by Hallmark, who never fails to product ""the very best.""My wife and I LOVE this movie. It is one for us to watch each year.
