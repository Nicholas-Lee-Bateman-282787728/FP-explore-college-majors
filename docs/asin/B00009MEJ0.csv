However, because so many people wrote praising reviews on this MGM adaptation, I thought it would be worth purchasing. I was wrong.This adaptation is horrible. Why? Because it does not make sense and does not make sense regardless of whether you have read Dickens' novel. (In fact, it probably makes less sense if you have not read the novel.)The problem with this film may simply be the lack of time to create a really effective adaptation. Telling the story of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" in under 3 hours is a challenge. That said, I feel that many unnecessary scenes were included that did nothing to advance the plot-line at the detriment of the film as a whole.For example, about 6 minutes of the film are dedicated to rescuing Smike after he is captured. The whole scene is frankly stupid and does not make sense. (For example, David and Smike could have jumped from the second story balcony rather than twisting their way back past the alleged danger of Mr. Squeers and company.

The British Channel 4 produced a longer (by one hour) rendition of the novel a year or two before this one, but that version suffers from several weaknesses: Nicholas looks too weak, the whole atmosphere is too dark and gloomy, Kate looks bitchy, Smike seems a tad too old, the set is unattractively realistic, etc.  This American production has none of these faults.  In fact, the biggest problem with the British version is that it is way too heavy on the dark side, when Dickens's book is intended to be balanced between tragedy and comedy.  This movie strikes this balance very well without losing the pathos.  The quality of the DVD is also good.For time's sake the director omits the Mantalinis altogether (the British version has that all right), perhaps thinking that this is marginal to the main story itself.  It would have been great if the film had dealt with the question of why exactly Ralph Nickleby never gave a moment's thought that Smike might have been his own son.

754592,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00009MEJ0,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is an excellent film adaptation of the over-the-top novel Nickolas Nickleby by Charles Dickens. Dickens has strengths and weaknesses. His ability to create eccentric unique three dimensional characters is outstanding but his plots often are resolved around unrealistic coincidences, accidents, and hidden facts. This is exactly what you get with this film, a cast of excellent actors play unique odd characters in a plot that has so many coincidences that it is comical.Charlie Hunnam is well cast as the handsome upright energetic Nicholas who is a psychologically sound person if her ever was one. Dickens has the ability to create warped and evil characters but he also has an instinct for psychological health and Nicholas is honest and ethical,  innovative and willing to work, optimistic and hopeful, giving and generous, and most important, loving. Romola Garai plays sister Kate Nickleby who avoids the entrapments of their evil uncle Ralph. Christopher Plummer is outstanding as black hearted Ralph Nickleby who ironically speaks the most sincere lines in the movie when he says that people don't have to like him personally to pay for and depend upon his investment advice. Anne Hathaway is beautiful as Madeline Bray, the love of Nickolas. Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson are highly entertaining as the evil Squeers, terrible exploitive folks who prey on school children and their families. Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming are clever as traveling actors. It is Jamie Bell who almost steals the film in the role of abused child Smike.  With names like Squeer and Smike, the viewer wonders where Dickens gets all these wild names.The film never lags for a second since there is more story and characters here than can fit into 2 hours but neither does the viewer ever get lost by too much information provided too quickly.

754593,AB34G6VKP28L,B00009MEJ0,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[122, 131]","I can honestly say that ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is my favorite of Dickens' works. His sinister villain, his earnest, upright, innocent hero, and the beautiful Kate and their plight for financial independence from their evil uncle Ralph have the foundation of a classic. I've seen several adaptations, including the more faithful Bravo version, but I like this one the best. I believe Douglas McGrath, who tastefully brought ""Emma"" to the silver screen, has taken an already impressive work and improved on it. The movie moves at a nice pace without becoming drenched in melodrama or lingering over the ""darker"" side of the story; but neither does it shy away from the meaner aspects of Dickens' characters. Uncle Ralph, if possible, is even more wicked than Dickens wrote him. It does this in a perfectly tasteful and intelligent manner and also incorporates much if the sardonic humor found in the books, something I've found the Bravo adaptation lacks.In case you're unfamiliar with the story, the film revolves around the life of young Nicholas Nickleby and his sister Kate. Their father has died, leaving them in the hands of his older and much more financially-minded brother Ralph. Desiring to be rid of Nicholas, Ralph seeks him employment with Wackford Squeers, the owner of a boys' school in the north country. The institution puts on a good public face but is in reality a squalor where the boys are mistreated and abused while Squeers and his wife pocket what little income they can provide. While attempting to teach at this ""school,"" Nicholas meets the crippled Smike, an orphan whom the Squeers keep on out of ""the goodness of their hearts."" Eventually his friendship with Smike will have a vast impact on not only his life, but that of his uncle Ralph as well.The casting for this film is nothing short of exquisite. Douglas McGrath isn't afraid to cast British actor but American-unknown Charlie Hunnam in the lead. The young actor has a fluid intelligence in his performance and looks ideal in a period setting. Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries"") plays his love interest, and ""Daniel Deronda's"" Romola Garai is a beautiful and sweet Kate Nickleby. Throw in Christopher Plummer (whose snarling Uncle Ralph should have won an Oscar), Nicholas Rowe, Edward Fox, Jamie Bell, Nathan Lane, and Alan Cumming, and you have a well-rounded, top-notch cast. The roles are all performed with intelligence and insight, the costuming is lovely, and the script never lags.From a family -- and indeed a Christian perspective -- I'm happy to report that McGrath's screenplay maintains the height of decency. Even when dealing with tedious and ""offensive"" elements, such as Sir Mulberry Hawke's pursuit of Kate, the film does its best to present the scenario in a way which won't offend mainstream audiences. There are some intense scenes at the Squeers' school, where children are flogged, but these scenes are kept to a minimum and never overly graphic. I particularly enjoyed seeing Nicholas defend the honor of Smike, Madeline, and his sister Kate. For those who haven't read the novel, the story ends with a surprising twist with little clues planted along the way to point you toward the truth. For those who do know the ending, it's handled beautifully and has great screen impact.I was fortunate enough to see this on the big screen in a little theatre in the heart of the city while others were flocking to much bigger and less enthusiastic releases. I've looked forward to owning the DVD for a long time.",5,"""The very definition of goodness.""",1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,3513,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'favorite', 'Dickens', 'works', 'sinister', 'villain', 'earnest', 'upright', 'innocent', 'hero', 'beautiful', 'Kate', 'plight', 'financial', 'independence', 'evil', 'uncle', 'Ralph', 'have', 'foundation', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'adaptations', 'including', 'more', 'faithful', 'Bravo', 'version', 'like', 'one', 'best', 'believe', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'who', 'tastefully', 'brought', 'Emma', 'silver', 'screen', 'taken', 'already', 'impressive', 'work', 'improved', 'movie', 'nice', 'pace', 'becoming', 'drenched', 'melodrama', 'lingering', 'darker', 'side', 'story', 'shy', 'away', 'meaner', 'aspects', 'Dickens', 'characters', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'possible', 'even', 'more', 'wicked', 'Dickens', 'wrote', 'perfectly', 'tasteful', 'intelligent', 'manner', 'also', 'much', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'found', 'books', 'something', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Bravo', 'adaptation', 'lacks.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'film', 'life', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'sister', 'Kate', 'father', 'died', 'leaving', 'hands', 'older', 'much', 'more', 'financially-minded', 'brother', 'Ralph', 'Desiring', 'be', 'rid', 'Nicholas', 'Ralph', 'employment', 'Wackford', 'Squeers', 'owner', 'boys', 'school', 'north', 'country', 'institution', 'good', 'public', 'face', 'reality', 'squalor', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'mistreated', 'abused', 'Squeers', 'wife', 'pocket', 'what', 'little', 'income', 'can', 'provide', 'attempting', 'teach', 'school', 'Nicholas', 'crippled', 'Smike', 'orphan', 'whom', 'Squeers', 'keep', 'goodness', 'hearts', 'Eventually', 'friendship', 'Smike', 'will', 'have', 'vast', 'impact', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'uncle', 'Ralph', 'well.The', 'casting', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'exquisite', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'cast', 'British', 'actor', 'American-unknown', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'lead', 'young', 'actor', 'fluid', 'intelligence', 'performance', 'ideal', 'period', 'setting', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'love', 'interest', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'Kate', 'Nickleby', 'Throw', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'snarling', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Nicholas', 'Rowe', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'have', 'well-rounded', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'roles', 'are', 'performed', 'intelligence', 'insight', 'costuming', 'lovely', 'script', 'never', 'family', 'indeed', 'Christian', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'McGrath', 'screenplay', 'height', 'decency', 'Even', 'when', 'dealing', 'tedious', 'offensive', 'elements', 'such', 'Sir', 'Mulberry', 'Hawke', 'pursuit', 'Kate', 'film', 'best', 'present', 'scenario', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'are', 'intense', 'scenes', 'Squeers', 'school', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'flogged', 'scenes', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'never', 'overly', 'graphic', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Nicholas', 'defend', 'honor', 'Smike', 'Madeline', 'sister', 'Kate', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'story', 'surprising', 'twist', 'little', 'clues', 'planted', 'way', 'point', 'truth', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'ending', 'handled', 'beautifully', 'great', 'screen', 'impact.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'little', 'theatre', 'heart', 'city', 'others', 'were', 'flocking', 'much', 'bigger', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'releases', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'forward', 'owning', 'DVD', 'long', 'time']",N/A

Featuring an all star cast (although the stars are more Royal Shakespeare Company than People Magazine) and lovely locales and sets, this film manages to distill Dickens' rather complex story into a coherent and surprisingly playful cinematic experience.Young Nicholas Nickleby has just lost his father, and desperate for help he takes his mother and innocent sister to London to seek their rich uncle. Unfortunately, said uncle is Christopher Plummer, and he's evil. He packs off Nicholas to teach at a miserable boy's school and sets about trawling the sister through the wealthy London bachelor scene for his own monetary gain. The story follows Nicholas as he mutinies at the school, finds true blue friends, rescues his sister, and faces his uncle while finding first love himself, all as a result of his inherit goodness.A well made film with excellent performances from all, with particular kudos to Heather Goldenhersh as the loopy Fanny Squeers and Nathan Lane as theater maestro Vincent Crummles. There is also, of course, Juliet Stevensen as the villainous Mrs. Squeers. Watch for the scene where she tells Nicholas to stay out of her plots, ""or we will fall out, in a way that will spoil your beauty"".

I have not read that book, so this story was new to me and I couldn't help but be impressed.Hopefully, most people are still satisfied to see good people triumph in the end.  With a Dickens story, you know there will be a lot to overcome, too, and lots of suffering and heartache along the way to a happy ending.Douglas McGrath-did a fine job directing this film. Dick Pope, director of photography (cinematographer) made England look as beautiful as any Merchant-Ivory film I've seen.  Start-to-finish the landscape of England never looked prettier.  Pope performed the same kind of magic two years later in ""The Illusionist,"" a gorgeous-looking movie. Kudos to Rachel Portman for a magnificent score, too, with a beautiful, sweeping theme song.  This movie is a treat for the ears, as well.Charlie Hunnam as Nicholas Nickleby was adequate; Christopher Plummer as his Uncle Ralph was very good and Jamie Bell as the unforgettable ""Smike"" was excellent.  It's hard to believe he's the same kid who played ""Billy Elliott"" just a couple of years ago.Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevens as the wicked, evil husband-and-wife-team who run DotheBoys Hall, a boys boarding school, were also memorable. Dickens also had cruel people mistreating little boys and these two personify cruelty.Two beautiful women: Anne Hathaway's as Nicholas' love ""Madeline Bray"" and Romola Garai as his sister ""Kate"" were both pleasant and easy on the eyes. As for supporting actors, I enjoyed them all as well, getting an extra smile from Timothy Spall and Gerald Horan and ""Charles and Ned Cherryble""  The same can be said for Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming, who provide much-needed comic relief and whimsey.One other thing that was fun to observe in this film: everyone's vocabulary!  I loved how they expressed themselves, the good and the bad peopleOf the many well-put sentences delivered in this well-intentioned and high-minded film, I remember Nickleby saying near the end, ""Weakness is tiring, but strength is exhausting.""",5,Good Triumphs Over Evil,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2165,"['Stunning', 'photography', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'story', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', '2002', 'adaptation', 'famous', 'book', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'story', 'was', 'new', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed.Hopefully', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'satisfied', 'see', 'good', 'people', 'triumph', 'end', 'Dickens', 'story', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'overcome', 'too', 'lots', 'suffering', 'heartache', 'way', 'happy', 'ending.Douglas', 'McGrath-did', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'Dick', 'Pope', 'director', 'photography', 'cinematographer', 'made', 'England', 'look', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Start-to-finish', 'landscape', 'England', 'never', 'looked', 'prettier', 'Pope', 'performed', 'same', 'kind', 'magic', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Illusionist', 'gorgeous-looking', 'movie', 'Kudos', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'magnificent', 'score', 'too', 'beautiful', 'sweeping', 'theme', 'song', 'movie', 'treat', 'ears', 'well.Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'was', 'adequate', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'unforgettable', 'Smike', 'was', 'excellent', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'ago.Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Juliet', 'Stevens', 'wicked', 'evil', 'husband-and-wife-team', 'who', 'run', 'DotheBoys', 'Hall', 'boys', 'boarding', 'school', 'were', 'also', 'memorable', 'Dickens', 'also', 'had', 'cruel', 'people', 'mistreating', 'little', 'boys', 'two', 'personify', 'cruelty.Two', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Nicholas', 'love', 'Madeline', 'Bray', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'sister', 'Kate', 'were', 'pleasant', 'easy', 'eyes', 'supporting', 'actors', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'extra', 'smile', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Gerald', 'Horan', 'Charles', 'Ned', 'Cherryble', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'who', 'provide', 'much-needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'whimsey.One', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'fun', 'observe', 'film', 'everyone', 'vocabulary', 'loved', 'how', 'expressed', 'good', 'bad', 'peopleOf', 'many', 'well-put', 'sentences', 'delivered', 'well-intentioned', 'high-minded', 'film', 'remember', 'Nickleby', 'saying', 'end', 'Weakness', 'tiring', 'strength', 'exhausting']",N/A
754599,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00009MEJ0,Craig MACKINNON,"[10, 10]","Charles Dickens wrote the novel of Nicholas Nickelby as an indictment of the infamous ""Yorkshire Schools"" - English public schools in Yorkshire where unwanted children (bastards, etc.) were sent to be ""educated"" for the lowest possible price.  One headmaster was jailed on account of his cruelty.  With the purpose of denouncing these schools, Nicholas Nickelby shines forth with Dickens's trademark ironic wit.  I'm happy to report that this film adaptation is faithful to the spirit of the original work - dark and monstrous when portraying evil at work, bright and cheerful when good triumphs.It's been some time since I read the book, but from what I remember, the film follows pretty closely with the action.  Of course, it's necessarily abbreviated, but not detrimentally so (but see below).  Nicholas, his sister Kate, and their mother have recently lost the patriarch of the family, and travel to London to see if his (extremely rich and selfish) uncle can help them get through their financial difficulties.  Uncle promptly sends Nicholas off to teach as Dotheby's Hall, run by the notorious Squeers.  He befriends a poor orphan named Smike, who is constantly abused by Squeers and his wife.  Eventually, Nicholas has had enough and flees the school with Smike, setting up further adventures as he makes his way back to London to be with Kate and his mother.Jamie Bell's performance as Smike is the absolute highlight of the film.  He cowers, limps, and somehow folds himself into the very representation of a crippled, malnourished, and abused boy.  Christopher Plummer's scenery-chewing Uncle Ralph is also impressive, as are the performances of the principles and the entire supporting cast.  The direction is sure, London is suitably dank and smokey (although, oddly, the mud and filth doesn't seem to get onto the characters' clothes), and the score is quite nice.Although the story follows relatively closely to the book, there are times when Dickens's irony is instead shown as melodrama - one of the problems with adapting Dickens is that his sardonic wit is often part of the narration, not part of the characters.  Apart from the Squeers family, Nicholas Nickelby's original sarcasm is buried.  Likewise, with the cutting of characters, it's the comic relief characters that are sacrificed (e.g. Tim Linkwater (?) and Miss Lacreevy).  The movie simply isn't as funny as the book, but still, full marks for what must have been a tough adaptation from a 750 page book!  For my money, Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is still the best film made from a ""classic"" English novel.  This film is quite close, though.The DVD edition is quite nice - the director is unusually candid and well-spoken, so the behind-the-scenes featurettes and the director's commentary are quite good.",4,"A good adaptaion, alternately humourous and dark",1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2793,"['Charles', 'Dickens', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Nicholas', 'Nickelby', 'indictment', 'infamous', 'Yorkshire', 'Schools', 'English', 'public', 'schools', 'Yorkshire', 'where', 'unwanted', 'children', 'bastards', 'etc', 'were', 'sent', 'be', 'educated', 'lowest', 'possible', 'price', 'One', 'headmaster', 'was', 'jailed', 'account', 'cruelty', 'purpose', 'denouncing', 'schools', 'Nicholas', 'Nickelby', 'shines', 'forth', 'Dickens', 'trademark', 'ironic', 'wit', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'film', 'adaptation', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'original', 'work', 'dark', 'monstrous', 'when', 'portraying', 'evil', 'work', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'when', 'good', 'triumphs.It', 'been', 'time', 'read', 'book', 'what', 'remember', 'film', 'pretty', 'closely', 'action', 'course', 'necessarily', 'abbreviated', 'not', 'detrimentally', 'so', 'see', 'Nicholas', 'sister', 'Kate', 'mother', 'have', 'recently', 'lost', 'patriarch', 'family', 'travel', 'London', 'see', 'extremely', 'rich', 'selfish', 'uncle', 'can', 'help', 'get', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'Uncle', 'promptly', 'Nicholas', 'teach', 'Dotheby', 'Hall', 'run', 'notorious', 'Squeers', 'poor', 'orphan', 'named', 'Smike', 'who', 'constantly', 'abused', 'Squeers', 'wife', 'Eventually', 'Nicholas', 'had', 'enough', 'school', 'Smike', 'setting', 'up', 'further', 'adventures', 'way', 'back', 'London', 'be', 'Kate', 'mother.Jamie', 'Bell', 'performance', 'Smike', 'absolute', 'highlight', 'film', 'limps', 'somehow', 'folds', 'very', 'representation', 'crippled', 'malnourished', 'abused', 'boy', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'scenery-chewing', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'also', 'impressive', 'are', 'performances', 'principles', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'direction', 'sure', 'London', 'suitably', 'dank', 'smokey', 'oddly', 'mud', 'filth', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'characters', 'clothes', 'score', 'quite', 'story', 'relatively', 'closely', 'book', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Dickens', 'irony', 'instead', 'shown', 'melodrama', 'one', 'problems', 'adapting', 'Dickens', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'often', 'part', 'narration', 'not', 'part', 'characters', 'Apart', 'Squeers', 'family', 'Nicholas', 'Nickelby', 'original', 'sarcasm', 'buried', 'Likewise', 'cutting', 'characters', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'e.g', 'Tim', 'Linkwater', 'Miss', 'Lacreevy', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'book', 'still', 'full', 'marks', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'adaptation', '750', 'page', 'book', 'money', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'still', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'classic', 'English', 'novel', 'film', 'quite', 'close', 'though.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'quite', 'nice', 'director', 'unusually', 'candid', 'well-spoken', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'quite', 'good']",N/A

Some of the characters are well-played, and the writing is a decent adaptation of the original book, in its way.  Jamie Bell renders an appealing, disarming Smike, for instance. while Juliet Stevenson's portrayal of Mrs. Squeers is completely believable, completely human--not an easy feat with such an unbelievably heartless character.  In fact, the Squeers are easily the most Dickensian, appealingly horrible characters in the film, thanks to their actors.  Sir Mulberry Hawk's heavy-handed attempts to seduce the young, guileless Kate Nickleby may simply owe their creepiness to Edward Fox's decidedly older, jaded appearance, but whatever; it works.  Nicholas himself is easy on the eyes, I guess, butOverall, this is a lighter, prettier incarnation of Dicken's tale than the one that appears on the page, somewhat like director Douglas McGrath's 1996 film &#34;Emma&#34;, based on the Jane Austen novel of that name.  With characters like Wackford Squeers and his wife inhabiting the storyline, &#34;Nicholas Nickleby&#34; couldn't be the confection that &#34;Emma&#34; was, but for a Dickens' novel, this version comes pretty close to it.  If a bit of froth's what you want in your movie-Dickens (and there's no reason why it can't be), then this film version is your stopping-place.Why the three stars, then?  Well, personally, I like my Dickens as gritty as written, and as complex. I prefer a Smike who deserves love but is almost too difficult to look at; his suffering and the perverted cruelty visited upon him layered over his skin like a loathsome tattoo.  I like it with all the idealism left in place, as well.  Nicholas' should absolutely believe every one of his gentlemanly, honorable speeches.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThis 2002 film production of Charles Dickens' ""Nicholas Nickleby"" deserves most of the praise it is given.  It is very intelligent and modern, while retaining a certain literary detail that also elevates it above being a simple pop knock-off of Dickens.Starring Charlie Hunnam, Christopher Plummer, and also featuring Nathan Lane, ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is really a coming-of-age story for its title character.  At the death of his father, he is the patriarchal figure of his family, being very young himself.  He must continually balance being a good-hearted young man while dealing with the evil surrounding him, the chief agent of which, in the beginning of the story and throughout, is his uncle Ralph Nickleby.  Played by Christopher Plummer with a cold distance and frightening indifference to suffering, Ralph Nickleby may have been a forerunner to Ebenezer Scrooge. The difference between the characters is that Nickleby is arguably even colder and more tragic. Nicholas Nickleby himself is not a vanilla character, as he shows genuine righteous passion.  However, he always maintains good motivations which makes him an unwavering hero.  Nathan Lane is perfect as Vincent Crummles, the flambuoyant leader of an amateur theatrical group that Nicholas and his traveling companion Smike briefly join.  Mr. Lane also narrates the movie.The biggest failure of this adaptation is that it runs out of narrative steam and chutzpah as it is nearing the conclusion of the movie.  The thread of Madeline Bray and her sick father is a little too easily tidied up, and the movie even deletes the controversial and ancient Arthur Gride as a suitor for Madeline, preferring to trot out the tired Sir Mulberry Hawk instead.Also starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Broadbent, this adaptation of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is an unexpectedly solid film.",4,Very good movie of one of Dickens' most modern and accessible stories,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1844,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThis', '2002', 'film', 'production', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'most', 'praise', 'given', 'very', 'intelligent', 'modern', 'retaining', 'certain', 'literary', 'detail', 'also', 'being', 'simple', 'pop', 'knock-off', 'Dickens.Starring', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'also', 'featuring', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'really', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'title', 'character', 'death', 'father', 'patriarchal', 'figure', 'family', 'being', 'very', 'young', 'must', 'continually', 'balance', 'being', 'good-hearted', 'young', 'man', 'dealing', 'evil', 'surrounding', 'chief', 'agent', 'beginning', 'story', 'uncle', 'Ralph', 'Nickleby', 'Played', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'cold', 'distance', 'frightening', 'indifference', 'suffering', 'Ralph', 'Nickleby', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'forerunner', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'difference', 'characters', 'Nickleby', 'arguably', 'even', 'colder', 'more', 'tragic', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'not', 'vanilla', 'character', 'genuine', 'righteous', 'passion', 'However', 'always', 'good', 'motivations', 'unwavering', 'hero', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'perfect', 'Vincent', 'Crummles', 'flambuoyant', 'leader', 'amateur', 'theatrical', 'group', 'Nicholas', 'traveling', 'companion', 'Smike', 'briefly', 'join', 'Mr.', 'Lane', 'also', 'movie.The', 'biggest', 'failure', 'adaptation', 'narrative', 'steam', 'chutzpah', 'nearing', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'thread', 'Madeline', 'Bray', 'sick', 'father', 'little', 'too', 'easily', 'tidied', 'up', 'movie', 'even', 'controversial', 'ancient', 'Arthur', 'Gride', 'suitor', 'Madeline', 'preferring', 'trot', 'out', 'tired', 'Sir', 'Mulberry', 'Hawk', 'instead.Also', 'starring', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'adaptation', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'unexpectedly', 'solid', 'film']",N/A

The score by Rachel Portman is also top-notch. From the magnificent opening credits until the very end, you are hooked, and the story never compromises faithfulness to the text for a fast pace. Of course, the novel goes into greater detail of events than the movie does, so I strongly recommend that you read the novel first before viewing the film. Charlie H., Christopher Plummer & Anne Hathaway (doing a spot-on British accent) are the stand-out performers here, with Nathan Lane doing a hilarious job as Vincent C., Romala Garai exuding innocence and love as Nicholas' sister, Jaime Bell absolutely warming your heart as the doomed Smike, Juliet Stevenson (Sense And Sensibility) & Jim Broabent wonderfully menacing, and Edward Fox, Nicholas Rowe (Young Sherlock Holmes), Tom Courtenay (Doctor Zhivago), Timothy Spall and Gerard Horan rounding out the main cast. There's nothing offensive in the film, Biblically speaking, apart from very brief nudity from a baby at the beginning and some mild violence. The director (who also wrote the script) is to be commended for making a compelling film version of an excellent novel suitable for family audiences.Rated PG (thematic elements and mild violence).",5,"Well-Acted, Written & Directed Adaptation Of Another Classic Novel By Charles Dickens.",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1476,"['Note', 'saw', 'movie', 'XFinity', 'Demand.Based', 'classic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'adaptation', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'grand', 'screen', 'version', 'equally', 'impressive', 'novel', 'came', 'silver', 'screen', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'score', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'also', 'top-notch', 'magnificent', 'opening', 'credits', 'very', 'end', 'are', 'hooked', 'story', 'never', 'faithfulness', 'text', 'fast', 'pace', 'course', 'novel', 'greater', 'detail', 'events', 'movie', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'Charlie', 'H.', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'doing', 'spot-on', 'British', 'accent', 'are', 'stand-out', 'performers', 'here', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'doing', 'hilarious', 'job', 'Vincent', 'C.', 'Romala', 'Garai', 'exuding', 'innocence', 'love', 'Nicholas', 'sister', 'Jaime', 'Bell', 'absolutely', 'warming', 'heart', 'doomed', 'Smike', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Jim', 'Broabent', 'wonderfully', 'menacing', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Nicholas', 'Rowe', 'Young', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Gerard', 'Horan', 'rounding', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'film', 'Biblically', 'speaking', 'apart', 'very', 'brief', 'nudity', 'baby', 'beginning', 'mild', 'violence', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'be', 'commended', 'making', 'compelling', 'film', 'version', 'excellent', 'novel', 'suitable', 'family', 'audiences.Rated', 'PG', 'thematic', 'elements', 'mild', 'violence']",N/A

754613,ADX5JX5LKLC22,B00009MEJ0,Intro Spective,"[15, 16]","I beg to differ with the previous reviewer. Firstly, the young and very charismatic Charlie Hunnam CARRIES the film.  That'staking into account the ASTONISHINGLY impressive cast of practically every working actor in the UK.  This young actor should not unfairly have his great performance commented upon in any way as relates to how he looks.  That is unjust.  The boy was superb and is a star in the making.  Brilliantly emotive, striking just the balance between angelic hero, and strong force to be reckoned with, his was the strongest performance in the film.That said, the rest of the performances were just as noteworthy, especially Jim Broadbent, the vastly underrated Timothy Spall, (if you want to see another overlooked GEM, buy Still Crazy on DVD now while it's still available), Edward Fox in a key supporting role, and, providing some much needed comic relief, the inspired performances of Alan Cumming and Nathan Lane.  JAMIE BELL deserves an Oscar nod for this MOST SUBTLE OF PERFORMANCES of what must surely be a difficult part to nail down.Naturally, Christopher Plummer is superb and flawless as ever, he wouldn't have it any other way, and only he can make this truly evil, vile character sympathetic.The plot is Dickens of course, full of subplot, subcontext, dead-on characterization, and moral meaning.  This is my favourite Dickens tale, one of family, and what constitutes family, and loyalty, and most of all, strength of character.  It's got it all.  RUN TO SEE IT.  Please do not be swayed by all the drivel that is out there this season, with a few exceptions, (that means you, Mr. Spielberg).These quality movies need to be seen, so that they will continue to be made.  And we do need films like this to prevent our childrens heads from turning to mush by all the horrid material that is out there.  So please let's all see this movie, and enjoy it with our kids who are over 10 or so. (Very sad at times, and not quite sure younger children won't be TOO saddened by these parts.  There was much sniffling and blowing of young noses during our New Years Eve viewing).BUT ALL IN ALL, SUPERB QUALITY, PRODUCTION VALUES, WONDERFUL RACHEL PORTMAN SCORE, AS ALWAYS, GORGEOUS CINEMATOGRAPHY, AND ALL AROUND EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY.If the mass market moviegoer can't appreciate this type of film, more's the pity, but there's always XXX for those people, andpeople of taste should see this one.

Nicholas is a tall, square-jawed, blond, brave, noble and principled hunk that approaches being boringly predictable. Certainly, the best reasons to see the film are the villains. Of course, there's Uncle Ralph, the man you love to hate. Then there are Wackford Squeers and his wife (Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson respectively), who run a rural boarding school for boys that is, for its hapless pupils, a grim and terrible prison. And there's the old scoundrel Sir Mulberry Hawk (Edward Fox), who has lecherous designs on the lovely Kate's pulchritude. Mrs. Squeers, a witch with a vengeance, received too little screen time - for me, she was the most interesting of all.Of Nickleby's friends and allies, the most winning was Vincent Crummles (Nathan Lane), the owner of a traveling theater company. More pathetic than engaging is Smike (Jamie Bell), on whose behalf Nicholas confronts the evil Squeers duo. Smike is a completely wretched figure, the perfect foil for Nickleby's Dudley Doright persona.If you're a Charles Dickens fan, then NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a must-see period piece that will attractively visualize the story for your mind's eye.

The abominable Squeers (Jim Broadbent and Juliette Stevenson) and Uber Creep Sir Mulberry Hawk (the great Edward Fox) were deliciously sinister.

I expected less but was so pleasantly surprised!I read Nicholas Nickleby years ago and have no plans to read it in the near future.  That said, I had forgotten much of the story.  It is obvious, though, that even without remembering much of the book nor the story, there is much that has been left out of the movie.  No matter. What is left here is perfect.  Although we may never know why Ralph Nickleby lost his ten thousand pounds just by watching the film, we understand that there must have been some behind-the-scenes scheming going on and that's perfectly fine.Although definitely a drama, the comedic elements work so well here to lighten the desperate dark Dickensian times.The film is perfectly cast. Charlie Hunnam as Nicholas is delightful-- moral, upright, brave.  Christopher Plummer was unbelievable. Although he's not seen too much of late, it's great to see him in such a plumb role here. He's marvelous-- nasty and cruel with a small amount of humanity left in him (very small and easy to dismiss) to make him extremely complex rather than a caricature.  Nathan Lane was a scene stealer and added a large dose of much needed relief from the darkness. And Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson were incredible-- Juliet Stevenson especially.  She delivered each of her lines with perfection.  At one point, her husband, the evil Mr. Squeers, tells her that she alone could take away any man's pride more quickly than anyone else in England. Recognizing the statement for the compliment it was meant to be, she responds adoringly.I cannot recommend this highly enough. Highly watchable!

One day his father decided to begin to speculate, which at that time was analogous to playing the stock market, as his older brother Ralph Nickleby made a great fortune in this manner.  However, as for most speculators Mr. Nickleby was led into financial ruin and an early death instead of to a great fortune.  On the brink of poverty the family seeks out their uncle Ralph, who helps the family, but with ulterior motives.  The uncle sends Nicholas to a boarding school as a teacher where he is forced to witness the abusive Mr. Squeers assault the students, in particularl the young and crippled boy Smike.  This turns into a turning point in Nicholas's life as he was raised to shelter happiness and spread joy of life.Nicholas Nickleby is based on Charles Dickens third book with the same name, and this adaptation is remarkably well planned as it offers the same interesting characters and  intrigue where Nicholas sets out to find the means to help his family.  On his journey Nicholas encounters several different individuals of questionable and honorable character, which is a frequent theme in Dickens' writing as can be observed in Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield.  Nicholas is one of these honorable characters and the story is based around his good qualities as others attempt to corrupt or injure his persona.  McGrath does a terrific job in creating an atmosphere where good and evil are evident allowing the story to be learned by young as well as old.  In the end, Nicholas Nickleby offers a good cinematic experience that has something for everyone.",4,Dickens' wish to share joy and happiness shines through...,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1706,"['family', 'where', 'happiness', 'ruled', 'where', 'always', 'had', 'enough', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'grew', 'up', 'One', 'day', 'father', 'decided', 'begin', 'speculate', 'time', 'was', 'analogous', 'playing', 'stock', 'market', 'older', 'brother', 'Ralph', 'Nickleby', 'made', 'great', 'fortune', 'manner', 'However', 'most', 'speculators', 'Mr.', 'Nickleby', 'was', 'led', 'financial', 'ruin', 'early', 'death', 'instead', 'great', 'fortune', 'brink', 'poverty', 'family', 'out', 'uncle', 'Ralph', 'who', 'family', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'uncle', 'Nicholas', 'boarding', 'school', 'teacher', 'where', 'forced', 'witness', 'abusive', 'Mr.', 'Squeers', 'assault', 'students', 'young', 'crippled', 'boy', 'Smike', 'turning', 'point', 'Nicholas', 'life', 'was', 'raised', 'shelter', 'happiness', 'spread', 'joy', 'life.Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'based', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'third', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'adaptation', 'remarkably', 'well', 'planned', 'same', 'interesting', 'characters', 'intrigue', 'where', 'Nicholas', 'out', 'find', 'means', 'help', 'family', 'journey', 'Nicholas', 'several', 'different', 'individuals', 'questionable', 'honorable', 'character', 'frequent', 'theme', 'Dickens', 'writing', 'can', 'be', 'observed', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Nicholas', 'one', 'honorable', 'characters', 'story', 'based', 'good', 'qualities', 'others', 'attempt', 'corrupt', 'injure', 'persona', 'McGrath', 'terrific', 'job', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'evident', 'allowing', 'story', 'be', 'learned', 'young', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'end', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'something', 'everyone']",N/A
754626,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00009MEJ0,Lawyeraau,"[39, 41]","This is a concise adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel of the same name. It is a quintessential Dickensian tale. A doting father and loving husband lives in the country with his beloved family. Needing money for their sustenance, he speculates with the little money that he has, at his wife's insistence, and loses all. Dying of a broken heart, he leaves his wife (Stella Gonet) and daughter, Kate (Romola Garai), in the care of his nineteen year old son, Nichols Nickleby (Charlie Hunnam). Left penniless, they are forced to seek succor from their father's cruel but wealthy  brother, Ralph Nickleby (Christopher Plummer), who lives in baronial splendor in London.When they arrive in London, Nicholas, not knowing his uncle's proclivity for cruelty,  entrusts his mother and sister into his uncle's care. He allows himself, at his uncle's behest,  to be sent as a schoolmaster at a Yorkshire boarding school run by Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent), while his sister is to be apprenticed to a dressmaker. An innocent lamb being led to the slaughter, Nicholas goes off to the school, only to find cruelty of a type that he never would have imagined.  The school is a run with an iron fist by both Mr. Squeers and the love of his life, the indomitable Mrs. Squeers (Juliet Stevenson), whose idea of a good meal for the boys in their care and custody is a steady diet of brimstone and treacle. Harsh corporal punishment and  a spare and unpalatable diet take their toll on the boys, who live in a state of total fear and squalor at the school.The physical labor needed at the school is provide by a crippled, teenage orphan named Smike (Jamie Bell), a former student. It seems that payments for Smike's education and board stopped some time ago, so Mr. and Mrs. Squeers have kept him on as a sort of indentured servant, heaping every imaginable physical and emotional cruelty and privation upon this unfortunate lad. Nicholas forms a bond with Smike, befriending him in the promise and emerging as his champion, incurring Smike's enduring devotion. Together, Smike and Nicholas flee the school, emerging from darkness into light when they meet up with thespians, Vincent Crummles (Nathan Lane) and his wife, Mrs. Crummles (Barry Humphries), and their traveling band of actors.Meanwhile in London, Kate and her mother live in penury, while Kate is fairing little better than her brother. It seems that her uncle, under the guise of being avuncular, is intentionally subjecting her to the offensive overtures of a potential client of his, the salacious Sir Mulberry Hawk (Edward Fox). Acting as procurer for his wealthy friends and potential clients, Uncle Ralph continues to put Kate into the most compromising and unpleasant of situations for one so gently brought up, treating her as if she were little more than a strumpet.  Kate is beside herself with humiliation at the state to which she has been reduced and the position in which she finds herself.  She manages, however, to stand up for herself to her uncle, remaining resolute in her desire to retain her dignity and her reputation.Unbeknownst to Uncle Ralph, however,  his appalled assistant, Newman Noggs (Tom Courtenay), a gentleman who has fallen upon hard times due to his penchant for liquor, has been affronted by his employer's treatment of the Nickleby family. Noggs apprises Nicholas Nickleby of all that has transpired and of his Uncle Ralph's intent to ruin them, so Nicholas seeks to avenge his family.  While doing so, Nicholas makes the acquaintance of beautiful Madeline Bray (Anne Hathaway), another one of his uncle's victims. In avenging his family, Nicholas will manage to right what has gone wrong for her, as well. What follows is pure cinematic magic. This is a beautifully acted film and excellent adaptation of the Dickens novel.Charlie Hunnam is perfectly cast as the innocent Nicholas Nickleby who initially has the wool pulled over his eyes but, when faced with the reality of his situation, rises to the forefront as an avenging angel for all who have been smitten by evil. Christopher Plummer is simply sensational as the crafty and evil uncle, Ralph Nickleby, who in an ironic plot twist has his punishment fit his crimes. Jamie Bell infuses the role of the faithful Smike with just the right amount of pathos. Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson are perfectly cast as Mr. and Mrs. Squeers, the cruel and evil couple who, ironically, coo at each other, as lovebirds are wont to do. Romola Garai is excellent as the much put upon Kate. Edward Fox is terrific as the smarmy Sir Mulberry Hawk. Tom Courtenay is affecting in the role of the disgusted assistant, Newman Noggs.  Anne Hathaway, finding herself among such a distinguished cast,  manages to hold her own in the role of Madeline Bray, while affecting a proper English accent.  Nathan Lane shines in the role of the kindly thespian, Vincent Crummles.  The most inspired bit of casting, however, is that of Barry Humphries, also known as Dame Edna, in the role of the bustling Mrs. Crummles.Director Douglas McGrath has deftly directed this film, exacting meticulous performances from his stellar cast. He has also written an excellent screenplay, as it brilliantly and succinctly adapts the Dickens novel, keeping its essence intact. This is simply a beautiful film with first class production values. It is a film that will hold great appeal for those who are fans of Charles Dickens, as well as for those who love period pieces.",5,I WILL STRIKE HIM UNTIL HE CAN BE STRUCK NO MORE...,1126742400,"09

754627,A28VE4C1TXPLOC,B00009MEJ0,L. Delaney,"[0, 0]","I'd put off watching Nicholas Nickleby for quite a while and, now that I've seen it, I can't imagine why. I don't know what I was expecting but definitely not the sweet greatness that is this movie.Nineteen year old Nicholas Nickleby's father has just died, leaving Nicholas as the head of his little family which consists of his mother and his beautifully sweet sister Kate. The Nickleby trio is unable to stay at their beloved country house, and so they use the last of their money to travel to London, seeking the help of their father's/husband's much older and wealthy brother Ralph. This is the beginning of a hard journey of growth for Nicholas and, to a lesser degree, his sister Kate.Nicholas is sent by Ralph to teach at the Dotheboys Hall boarding school which is run by Wackford Squeers and his detestable wife. The boys live in horrible conditions, are beaten, and almost starved. Nicholas is horrified but where else is he to go? He needs money to support his mother and sister. At the school there is a teenage boy by the name of Smike, crippled and mistreated the worst of all the boys by the Squeers. Smike and Nicholas become fast, faithful, and loyal friends. Nicholas grows the most through his friendship with Smike. Smike has no one in the world but Nicholas and Nicholas is the best version of himself so that he can be worthy of Smike's devotion. The friendship between Smike and Nicholas was the best part of the story for me. Plus, I absolutely LOVED Smike. He's this boy who is just so...wonderful. He's been beaten, mistreated, and treated like a slave but there is something sweet and innocent about him that has survived every injustice he has been done.While Nicholas is at the Squeers' school, Kate has been placed in a seamstress apprentice position in London by Ralph. Evil, evil Ralph as we find out because to Ralph, Kate is a plaything that he throws to the mercy of his detestable, wealthy friends. He puts Kate in the worse situations and I just wanted to smack him so many times and then hug Kate. But Nicholas hears, from Ralph's servant Noggs, that Kate is in need of help and returns to London. We see Nicholas become a champion again as he defends his sister's honor, gives Smike a home and family, and supports as many people as he can.Oh! Let's talk about Ralph's servant, Noggs. Noggs was brilliant, just brilliant. He hates Ralph and is maybe the most defiant servant ever while still managing to keep his job. He helps the Nicklebys and basically spys for Nicholas. He's a key player in the justice that happens at the end of the story. He lets Kate know that she has someone in her corner. At one point in the movie he helps save Smike.

754633,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B00009MEJ0,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[5, 6]","This is a nice effort by director Douglas McGrath, who also brought us the excellent film adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;Emma.&quot;It has light and airy feel to it with lovely and talented stars, beautiful cinematography and a partly comedic and partly dramatic treatment to Charles Dickens' story.  Big kudos would go to the talented cast composed of Charlie Hunnam, Christopher Plummer, Anne Hathaway, Romola Garai, Juliet Stevenson and Jamie Bell.There are, however, some notable shortcomings.  Having seen the 2001 tv version (&quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;) starring James D'Arcy (which is also available on DVD), I feel that this adaptation pales in comparison.  For one, Charlie Hunnam (as Nicholas) feels a little out of place in this period piece.  He just has such a modern look that he seems slightly awkward in this Victorian tale.  James D'Arcy, on the other hand, seems natural to play Nicholas.  He has that intensity and earnestness that makes you want to root for him from the start (and he is beautiful to watch, too).  Christopher Plummer is always good in everything he does but to my eyes he pales in comparison to Charles Dance's excellent portrayal of Ralph Nickleby.  Mr. Plummer's Ralph is mean spirited and cranky while Mr. Dance gives a more chilling and believable portrayal as Nicholas' greedy, heartless uncle.Another problem is the time constraints between film vs. tv.  Clearly this version feels fairly rushed. I like to think of it as the &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; version. There is little time to deal with character development and certain characters (such as the eccentric Mantalinis and the scheming Arthur Gride) and plot lines were lopped off.  The tv version has the advantage of being able to stay more faithful to the story and introduce us to a colorful range of characters that makes for a richer adaptation.I enjoyed this version of Nicholas Nickleby.  It is well worth renting on dvd.  However, if I had a choice between this or the tv version, I would far prefer seeing the tall, handsome and talented James D'Arcy (who will soon be seen in Russell Crowe's &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;) play Nicholas over Charlie Hunnam.  In short, this is nice to watch once in awhile but the 2001 tv version is the one I prefer to keep in my dvd library and watch again and again.",4,Nicely done........but the James D'Arcy version is better.,1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,2375,"['nice', 'effort', 'director', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'who', 'also', 'brought', 'excellent', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Emma.', 'quot', 'light', 'airy', 'feel', 'lovely', 'talented', 'stars', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'partly', 'comedic', 'partly', 'dramatic', 'treatment', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'story', 'Big', 'kudos', 'would', 'go', 'talented', 'cast', 'composed', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Jamie', 'Bell.There', 'are', 'however', 'notable', 'shortcomings', 'Having', 'seen', '2001', 'tv', 'version', 'quot', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'quot', 'starring', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'feel', 'adaptation', 'comparison', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Nicholas', 'little', 'place', 'period', 'piece', 'just', 'such', 'modern', 'look', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'Victorian', 'tale', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'other', 'hand', 'natural', 'play', 'Nicholas', 'intensity', 'earnestness', 'want', 'root', 'start', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'too', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'always', 'good', 'everything', 'eyes', 'comparison', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Ralph', 'Nickleby', 'Mr.', 'Plummer', 'Ralph', 'mean', 'spirited', 'cranky', 'Mr.', 'Dance', 'more', 'chilling', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'Nicholas', 'greedy', 'heartless', 'uncle.Another', 'problem', 'time', 'constraints', 'film', 'vs.', 'tv', 'Clearly', 'version', 'fairly', 'rushed', 'like', 'think', 'quot', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'quot', 'version', 'little', 'time', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'certain', 'characters', 'such', 'eccentric', 'Mantalinis', 'scheming', 'Arthur', 'Gride', 'plot', 'lines', 'were', 'lopped', 'off', 'tv', 'version', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'stay', 'more', 'faithful', 'story', 'introduce', 'colorful', 'range', 'characters', 'richer', 'adaptation.I', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'well', 'worth', 'renting', 'dvd', 'However', 'had', 'choice', 'tv', 'version', 'would', 'far', 'prefer', 'seeing', 'tall', 'handsome', 'talented', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'quot', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'quot', 'play', 'Nicholas', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'short', 'nice', 'watch', 'once', 'awhile', '2001', 'tv', 'version', 'one', 'prefer', 'keep', 'dvd', 'library', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A

754635,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B00009MEJ0,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[4, 5]","Going by the comments I've read it is not advisable to view this film if you're not a Dickens fan. You are likely to find many characters absurd and unbelievable, and plotlines ridiculously convoluted. They are - that's Dickens for you. But if you are a fan (I am) I think you will like this production very much. I only knew Nickleby from the excellent 1977 TV adaptation starring Nigel Havers, so I can't judge how true this version is to the book. But the atmosphere is thoroughly Dickensian: a colourful mix of comedy and tragedy played out by an equally colourful and engaging cast of characters. It seems to me McGrath's stylistic approach is well  suited to Dickens's larger than life story (his earlier adaptation of Austen's far more subtle and subdued ""Emma"" I found somewhat slick and overly technicoloured). Extravagant scenes like those in Mr Crummles's traveling theatre company are brought to life with relish, and only deepen the sense of squalor surrounding the Squeeres's Yorkshire school and the gloom, evilness, and eventual tragedy suffusing the sphere of Uncle Ralph.I've seen reviewers complain about Hunnam's title role as a serious miscast- ""surfer dude lost in a period drama,"" said one; ""delivers his lines like a schoolboy in his first play,"" said another. I don't agree, and found his acting just as convincing as that of other cast members - his only problem is that Nicholas exclusively represents the forces of good, which always makes for somewhat flat characterisation; but that would be Dickens's fault, not Hunnam's. In that respect it is a good thing that the scriptwriter has stressed the vengefulness of the character, gloating as he does over his uncle's downfall: it only helps to make him believable, and also to make him a powerful presence in the story rather than an impassive stander-by. Admittedly there is one rather gratuitous shirtless scene in which Hunnam displays a physique one would not likely have found in an impoverished mid-nineteenth century schoolmaster, but on the other hand: who would complain?The rest of the cast is universally excellent, with Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliott"") taking the laurels for his truly heart-rending depiction of Smike: here's one great actor in the making - the death scene is simply crushing. Christopher Plummer is fantastic as Uncle Ralph; Tom Courtenay portrays a most endearing Newman Noggs; and Edward Fox a most horrible Sir Hawke - to mention just a few. Among female roles Romola Garai stands out as a sweet and dignified Kate. The tongue-in-cheek casting of Barry Humpries (aka Dame Edna Everage, and thus credited in the end titles) as Mrs. Crummles is bound to provoke smiles.Of course, to fit the 800+ page novel into two hours, a lot of sideplots and characters had to go. On the plus side, this keeps things moving at a pace sometimes lacking in Dickens's novels (though I was still bothered by one or two scenes that seemed to lack action; e.g., when Nicholas adminsters a well-deserved caning to Squeeres, the subtly deranged Mrs. Squeeres meekly stands by, even though she is holding a torch she might easily have used to ward off the attacker. But these are minor details).D&eacute;cor and costumes are lavish to say the least, and combine with imaginative cinematography to make this a true feast for the eyes. To top it all off there is the terrific musical score by Rachel Portman with a delightful title tune that will stay with you for days. So if you like period drama, I would say this is a must-see!",5,Delectable Dickens,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,3513,"['Going', 'comments', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'advisable', 'view', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'Dickens', 'fan', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'many', 'characters', 'absurd', 'unbelievable', 'plotlines', 'ridiculously', 'convoluted', 'are', 'Dickens', 'are', 'fan', 'am', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'production', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'knew', 'Nickleby', 'excellent', '1977', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Nigel', 'Havers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'how', 'true', 'version', 'book', 'atmosphere', 'thoroughly', 'Dickensian', 'colourful', 'mix', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'played', 'out', 'equally', 'colourful', 'engaging', 'cast', 'characters', 'McGrath', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'well', 'suited', 'Dickens', 'larger', 'life', 'story', 'earlier', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'subdued', 'Emma', 'found', 'somewhat', 'slick', 'overly', 'technicoloured', 'Extravagant', 'scenes', 'Mr', 'Crummles', 'traveling', 'theatre', 'company', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'relish', 'only', 'deepen', 'sense', 'squalor', 'surrounding', 'Squeeres', 'Yorkshire', 'school', 'gloom', 'evilness', 'eventual', 'tragedy', 'suffusing', 'sphere', 'Uncle', 'Ralph.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'Hunnam', 'title', 'role', 'serious', 'miscast-', 'surfer', 'dude', 'lost', 'period', 'drama', 'said', 'one', 'lines', 'schoolboy', 'first', 'play', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'found', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'convincing', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'only', 'problem', 'Nicholas', 'exclusively', 'forces', 'good', 'always', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'characterisation', 'would', 'be', 'Dickens', 'fault', 'not', 'Hunnam', 'respect', 'good', 'thing', 'scriptwriter', 'stressed', 'vengefulness', 'character', 'gloating', 'uncle', 'downfall', 'only', 'make', 'believable', 'also', 'make', 'powerful', 'presence', 'story', 'rather', 'impassive', 'stander-by', 'Admittedly', 'one', 'rather', 'gratuitous', 'shirtless', 'scene', 'Hunnam', 'physique', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'likely', 'have', 'found', 'impoverished', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'schoolmaster', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'would', 'complain', 'rest', 'cast', 'universally', 'excellent', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'taking', 'laurels', 'truly', 'heart-rending', 'depiction', 'Smike', 'here', 'one', 'great', 'actor', 'making', 'death', 'scene', 'simply', 'crushing', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'fantastic', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'most', 'endearing', 'Newman', 'Noggs', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'most', 'horrible', 'Sir', 'Hawke', 'mention', 'just', 'few', 'female', 'roles', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'out', 'sweet', 'dignified', 'Kate', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'casting', 'Barry', 'Humpries', 'aka', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'Everage', 'thus', 'credited', 'end', 'titles', 'Mrs.', 'Crummles', 'bound', 'provoke', 'smiles.Of', 'course', 'fit', '800+', 'page', 'novel', 'two', 'hours', 'lot', 'sideplots', 'characters', 'had', 'go', 'plus', 'side', 'things', 'moving', 'pace', 'sometimes', 'lacking', 'Dickens', 'novels', 'was', 'still', 'bothered', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'lack', 'action', 'when', 'Nicholas', 'well-deserved', 'caning', 'Squeeres', 'subtly', 'deranged', 'Mrs.', 'Squeeres', 'meekly', 'stands', 'even', 'holding', 'torch', 'might', 'easily', 'have', 'used', 'ward', 'off', 'attacker', 'are', 'minor', 'details', '.D', 'eacute', 'cor', 'costumes', 'are', 'lavish', 'say', 'least', 'combine', 'imaginative', 'cinematography', 'make', 'true', 'feast', 'eyes', 'top', 'terrific', 'musical', 'score', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'delightful', 'title', 'tune', 'will', 'stay', 'days', 'So', 'like', 'period', 'drama', 'would', 'say', 'must-see']",N/A

Dickens, the storyteller, however, is still a great deal of fun in the right hands. Many of us are familiar with the numerous film versions of &#65533;A Christmas Carol&#65533;, &#65533;David Copperfield&#65533;, &#65533;Oliver Twist&#65533;, &#65533;A Tale of Two Cities&#65533; and &#65533;Great Expectations&#65533;. Dicken&#65533;s lesser known and very long &#65533;Nicolas Nickleby&#65533; is a hard book to tackle by any standards. Writer/director Douglas McGrath has done an admirable job of turning this ponderous tome into a sumptuous, entertaining movie that runs just over two hours. Sadly, the film, released last Christmas, fell under the radar, and very few people saw it. Perhaps on video and DVD it will find a wider audience.Nickleby [Charlie Hunnan] is a young man whose loving father has recently died in poverty, leaving Nickleby in charge of providing for his sister and mother. They journey to London to seek the help of their only other living relative, Ralph [Christopher Plummer], the dead father&#65533;s brother. Ralph is a rich, conniving, unscrupulous entrepreneur, who makes his money by convincing rich Londoners to invest in various schemes. He has scant interest in his family. He provides in a small way for the mother and daughter, but sends Nicholas off to the country to work in a dreadful boys&#65533; school run by the wicked Wackford Sqeers [Jim Broadbent] and his hideous wife [Juliet Stevenson]. Though appalled by conditions at the school, Nicholas tries hard to do a good job. He befriends a poor lad named Smike [Jamie Bell], who was once a student but is now virtually the Squeers&#65533; slave. Eventually, Nicholas and Smike leave the school, and Nicholas sets out to right the wrongs done to his family and to Smike.Wisely, McGrath injects much energy and humor into the movie. The tale may be dark, but the telling is not. The cast is uniformly excellent, and the supporting cast includes such great performers as Edward Fox, Tom Courtney, Nathan Lane, Alan Cumming, and even Barry Humphries, better know as Dame Edna.All in all, one of the better British imports in the last few years.",5,"Elegant, fast-paced version of the Dickens novel",1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,2351,"['Charles', 'Dickens', 'was', 'great', 'storyteller', 'witty', 'commentator', 'social', 'injustices', 'mid-19th', 'Century', 'England.150', 'years', 'later', 'class', 'Great', 'Britain', 'are', 'interest', 'mainly', 'historians', 'Dickens', 'storyteller', 'however', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'right', 'hands', 'Many', 'are', 'familiar', 'numerous', 'film', 'versions', '65533', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', '65533', '65533', 'David', 'Copperfield', '65533', '65533', 'Oliver', 'Twist', '65533', '65533', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', '65533', '65533', 'Great', 'Expectations', '65533', 'Dicken', '65533', 's', 'lesser', 'known', 'very', 'long', '65533', 'Nicolas', 'Nickleby', '65533', 'hard', 'book', 'tackle', 'standards', 'Writer/director', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'turning', 'ponderous', 'tome', 'sumptuous', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'Sadly', 'film', 'released', 'last', 'Christmas', 'fell', 'radar', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'saw', 'Perhaps', 'video', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'wider', 'audience.Nickleby', '[', 'Charlie', 'Hunnan', ']', 'young', 'man', 'loving', 'father', 'recently', 'died', 'poverty', 'leaving', 'Nickleby', 'charge', 'providing', 'sister', 'mother', 'journey', 'London', 'seek', 'help', 'only', 'other', 'living', 'relative', 'Ralph', '[', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', ']', 'dead', 'father', '65533', 's', 'brother', 'Ralph', 'rich', 'conniving', 'unscrupulous', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'money', 'convincing', 'rich', 'Londoners', 'invest', 'various', 'schemes', 'scant', 'interest', 'family', 'small', 'way', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Nicholas', 'country', 'work', 'dreadful', 'boys', '65533', 'school', 'run', 'wicked', 'Wackford', 'Sqeers', '[', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', ']', 'hideous', 'wife', '[', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', ']', 'Though', 'appalled', 'conditions', 'school', 'Nicholas', 'hard', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'poor', 'lad', 'named', 'Smike', '[', 'Jamie', 'Bell', ']', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'student', 'now', 'virtually', 'Squeers', '65533', 'slave', 'Eventually', 'Nicholas', 'Smike', 'leave', 'school', 'Nicholas', 'out', 'right', 'wrongs', 'done', 'family', 'Smike.Wisely', 'McGrath', 'much', 'energy', 'humor', 'movie', 'tale', 'may', 'be', 'dark', 'telling', 'not', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'such', 'great', 'performers', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Tom', 'Courtney', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'even', 'Barry', 'Humphries', 'better', 'know', 'Dame', 'Edna.All', 'one', 'better', 'British', 'imports', 'last', 'few', 'years']",N/A

He is, of course, beautiful beautiful but he's also a wonderful actor. He's able to pull off a starched England, old-school young gentleman, a love interest, a best friend and an almost super-hero to those he loves. He delivers his lines well and I plan on searching for other movies he's been in after I write this review. I was shocked to see someone didn't care for his acting! The only person that 'brought me out of the movie' a little by less-than-great acting was actually Anne Hathaway. Perhaps because I think of her as the typical ding-dong turned princess parts? Or perhaps because she delivers romantic lines as if she is reading a storybook to a child?I've been in a real victorian age/Dickens/English/BBC kind of mood for about a month now. I've reviewed quite a few of them in case you are in the mood to choose a few yourself! Well, NN (Nicholas Nickelby) was one of the last in my stack because of the name, it doesn't really grab your attention. Well, it turned out to be one of my favorites. There is something for everyone; humor (the uncle cracks me up with his dry, rude wit), romance, family values. The attention to detail as for knick-knacks (as many of us look for with victorian style movies) was nice. Nothing out of time, but no real fun items either. The lighting was wonderful, the quality of the film, a blessed relief from the older movies!  The homes were beautiful, the streets dark and depressing..perfect. It will make you want a bowl of punch with cucumber slices, however. Nathan Lane, who plays a theatre troop owner and performer is AWESOME. INSPIRED! This role was just perfect for him, again, it's got some very funny lines but you need to focus or you might miss them. No pity, watch it again!I watched this for the first time alone, then the second time with my kids (who are ages 14, 11 and 17) who loved it! This week I watched it for the third time with my hubby and..get this..by 14 year old son watched it for the second time. It's really, that good.

Every scene he was in was the soo good. I felt like reaching out to put my arms around the poor boy and comfort him. I almost never cry in a movie but I did with this one. Christoper Plummer was wonderful in this movie too, he played the evil uncle very well. It wasn't over done but no where near too soft,it's interesting how just at the end you feel a little sorry for him because of the horrible life he's lead.I loved Nicholas's sister she was the very perfect picture of the woman Dickens loved and respected, her sweet face and diginty were beautiful. I also loved the acting of the Squeers even though their were sooo evil,they played their parts so well. When Nicholas was beating Mr.Squeers my 21 year old brother was like ""yeah go go go"". I was so afraid he was just going to stand here doing nothing to save Smike. Thankfully I was wrong.Anne Hathaway was good but only good because her acent was almost none existent sometimes. I loved all of Noggs lines and his hand rubbing was right in line with the book. Alan Cummings was great with his Highland Fling as was Nathan Lane.

Prior to seeing this movie I knew nothing of the story. From the previews in the theater it looked interesting. The film more than lived up to my expectations. I was blown away by this movie (especially the surprise ending which had me in tears). Beautifully crafted, Nicholas Nickleby has everything going for it. A great story, perfect casting, colorful cinematography, and a beautiful soundtrack.Briefly, the story involves the fate of Nicholas after the death of his father. He is forced by his cruel uncle to leave his sister and mother to attend a terrible boarding school, which is more like a prison. Talk about child abuse!He manages to escape with Spike, a sickly attendee who almost gets beaten to a pulp prior to their escape. As the story unfolds a strong friendship forms between Nicholas and Spike which portrays human dignity at it's highest level. I'll say no more in fear that I may give away too much of the story.The strong cast includes Christopher Plummer, Jim Broadbent and even a cameo by Nathan Lane. The DVD should be outstanding, I can hardly wait. Sadly, this amazing movie wasn't in the theaters for a long time. Great films rarely appeal to the general movie going public, which is a crime.

I bought that version because of Charles Dance, and he was great; HOWEVER, I really preferred this Christopher Plummer version.It has been many years since I read the novel Nicholas Nickleby, so I can't judge which is more true to the book, but for pure entertainment purposes, I prefer this version.Usually, with a Dickens DVD, I consider the longer, the better.  I can't get too much Dickens.  However, the portions added in the other version to extend the length seemed to me only to confuse the story or make it less enjoyable.  I cite three:  The scene with Mrs. Nickleby and the dressmakers, the dining scene with the two couples, and the (to me) unnecessarily long segment dealing with the acting troupe.In this version, I loved the scene where the horseman rushes up to Nicholas and Smike and surprises them.  In the other version, it is so very tame (and also diluted by the aforesaid dining scene).The two brothers here were absolutely delightful.  In the other, they were just more characters.I thought Smike was better in this Plummer version.

Rather, this simple story is told simply with stellar casts from both the States and UK.  I'm delighted to say that all stars mastered their accents well & the performances were effortless & captivating to watch.  A story about a young man who's forced by circumstances to grow up quickly to fend for his family.  Amid those hardships, Nicholas Nickleby refused to undermine his moral codes & rather than thinking of his own good, he's thinking about the common good and happiness of all people.  In the end, he's rewarded handsomely by people who's gratified for his integrity by showering him with their loyalty and love.

Some are done better than others and director Doug McGrath did a really good job with this one. I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the film to the book but the film felt complete in itself--I didn't sense that anything essential to the story was missing.Everything about this is well done- the script, the settings, costumes, music, all of it.  The cast is superb--a really fine group of established, talented actors and it's a pleasure to watch them.  Some reviewers here didn't like the lead actor, Charlie Hunnan, but I thought he was perfect for the role--young, innocent (the director said he was looking for someone ""lamblike"") and certainly handsome.  I quickly became engaged in the character, Nicholas, due to the qualities of this young man--his charm and earnestness.  Tall, blond, with great cheekbones, he is the essence of a romantic hero, at least in my book.The crippled orphan, Slake, is brilliantly played by Jamie Bell.  It's a hard part, I think and the temptation to overdo the pathos is great.  He did it just right and won the hearts of most all viewers, as you can read here. I felt that Anne Hathaway was the weakest link but she's not bad and fortunately, she's only in the last part.Having seen quite a few hyper-arty films lately that seem to eschew any real action, emotion or....God forbid....an ending that offers real emotional resolution, I found this to be a wonderful relief.

(Keeping in mind angels can be both comforting and fierce, as needed.) He gives a beautiful, vulnerable performance, and it's hard to drag your eyes away from him whenever he's on screen - even when he's opposite Jamie Bell or Christopher Plummer. He's just fascinating to watch, and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of him in years to come. Indeed, we would have already if he weren't so choosy about his roles.Also, I'd like to point out, he is British not American as some reviewers here have claimed. He is from Newcastle, in England.Romola Garai is sweetly dignified as Kate and, to her credit, a bit easier to engage with than Kate is in the book. Jamie Bell is heartbreakingly authentic as Smike, as is Christopher Plummer - albeit in a very different way - as Uncle Ralph. Bell's physical transformation is moving in itself.Alan Cumming is a delight as always, and Timothy Spall radiates goodness and happiness as Mr. Cheeryble, which is a nice change of pace from his usual roles. Heather Goldenhersh (Lina in TV's ""The Class"") is a wonderful, funny surprise as Fanny Squeers, and Kevin McKidd's John Browdie is hilarious. The fantastic David Bradley (lately Filch in the Harry Potter films) has a small role as Mr. Bray, too, which delighted me no end.Amazingly, the movie does not suffer much from being under two hours long. As a fan of the book though, as well as most of the people in the cast, I wished it could have been longer. I just didn't want it to end so soon. Only the special features seemed lacking. The director's commentary was surprisingly boring. I'd have liked to see more of the cast in the cast segment and heard full-length commentary from some of them as well - particularly Hunnam, Bell or Plummer.The sets and costumes are first rate as is the writing. I particularly enjoyed Nicholas and Madeline's scene towards the end. (Trying not to spoil it for anyone by being too specific.) Dickens leaves their conversation to the imagination, but McGrath fills it in surprisingly well. It's believable (and refreshingly open and honest) of the characters in a private moment and completely relatable for a modern audience. It's also utterly, sweetly endearing due to the performances of Charlie Hunnam and Anne Hathaway.

I was especially interested to see this production because I was amazed to discover that it stars Charlie Hunnam, who now plays the lead character, Jax, in Sons of Anarchy, and I was equally amazed to discover that Hunnam is British. So kudos to him for being so utterly convincing as an American biker. But here he is a very young man just learning the acting craft, it seems, and it seems he was chosen in large part for his boyish blonde good looks. The whole production is kind of cutesy. It fails to capture the intense humor of the book; moreover it fails to capture the grittiness of Dickens' portrayal of life in England in the 1830s. Everything is prettified. While I love Christopher Plummer, I think he is tremendously miscast as Ralph Nickleby. Ralph is shown in a sumptuous estate, to let us know his wealth, but in the novel he is a miser, and lives in pretty grotty circumstances. Plummer gives the character an air of refinement, which is completely untrue to the book. Ralph is a horrible, crude, cruel man in the book, utterly unrefined. I would like to see Jim Carter, who plays Carson on Downton Abbey, play this role--while Carson is a perfectly upright character on Downton Abbey, to me Carter has the right look for the role of Ralph, and he appears to be such a fine actor that I bet he could do Ralph justice.

754664,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00009MEJ0,Robert Moore,"[2, 4]","This is an excellent version of Charles Dickens's classic novel.  Any film adaptation of any of Dickens's longer novels runs up against an inescapable fact:  too little time, too many pages.  As a result, almost all film versions of Dickens end up as frantic sprints rather than leisurely strolls, which is the experience one has actually reading the novels.  So, in a sense, any film version is doomed to fail from the beginning.  Despite that, this film, despite the overall sketchiness and sense of parts either missing or only partially filled in, contains many excellent moments.Overall, the cast is excellent, with a couple of irritating decisions.  Charlie Hunnam, in the opinion of all in my group that saw this, was good but almost too good looking for the title role.  He was, in fact, a bit of a bore, but that is as it should be since the least interesting character in most of Dickens's novels is his hero, the great characters all being the minor ones.  Anne Hathaway is fetching as Madeline Gray, but spends an amazingly small amount of time onscreen.  Jamie Bell, who garnered a well deserved Oscar nomination in BILLY ELLIOT, and stunned people with his physical prowess as a 12-year-old, here plays the cripple Smike.  Bell does a very decent job, in that he plays the part pretty much as written, but the character of Smike recalls Oscar Wilde's quip that it would take a man with a heart of stone to cry at the death of Little Nell in THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP.  I always find the characters upon whom Dickens most wants us to focus our sympathies to be utterly unbearable.So, the lead characters aren't so terribly compelling.  But this is a version of Dickens, which means that the villains and secondary characters dominate throughout.  Christopher Plummer is one of the most underrated actors of his time, and hands in a marvelous performance as Ralph Nickleby, Nicholas's evil uncle.  Even better in the role of the sadistic school master Wackford Squeers is Jim Broadbent, who in the past two years in films like IRIS (for which he got an Oscar) and MOULIN ROUGE (playing the owner and manager Harold Zidler) and THE GANGS OF NEW YORK (as Boss Tweed) has established himself as a character actor of prodigious talent and almost unchartable range.  Nathan Lane shines as the narrator and the leader of the troupe of itinerant actors Vincent Crummles.  Unfortunately, his part nearly gets squeezed off the screen by time restrictions.  Many, many other actors and actresses manage superb small parts, too many to mention here.  Again, the problem with the leads is not that they don't do a good job (they are all quite good), but that Dickens's best characters are his eccentrics and villains.As long as one doesn't expect a completely fleshed out version of the Dickens's novel, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film.  Yes, much gets left out, and too often you get the sense that things are being pushed faster than you would like to see, but in the end you are introduced to a number of fascinating characters.  I will add one last thing.  No movie can ever hope to capture that which makes Dickens truly great:  his prose.  Although the film can, of course, capture lines of dialogue, we lose the thousands of superb descriptions and narrative moments that make Dickens one of the great English novelists.

754665,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00009MEJ0,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","Writer/director Douglas McGrath has done a splendid job bringing Charles Dickens' delightful novel ""Nicholas Nickleby"" to the big screen.""Nickleby"" is quintessential Dickens in its mixture of sentiment and satire; its finely drawn characters and caricatures; its clear cut delineation of good and evil, hero and villain; its melodramatic and coincidence-ridden plotting; and its championing of the downtrodden underclass of 19th Century England.  Like many of Dickens' protagonists, Nicholas is a young man who is forced by circumstances (in this case the death of his father) to leave the comfort and security of his home and family and to venture forth to make his way in the world.  On his journey he meets many vivid and colorful characters, all of whom reveal to him both the goodness and the cruelty inherent in human nature.  These picaresque tales almost always end up with the hero a bit wiser and less nave for his experiences - but more committed than ever to righting wrongs and seeking justice for those less able to do so on their own.  And ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is no exception.In his approach to the material, McGrath has employed an amazing economy that allows him to effectively compress a 500-page novel into a 2 hour and 12 minute film.  With so much storyline to work with, McGrath wastes no time in setting the scene and defining the characters, then moving merrily along from one dramatic incident and encounter to the next.  Yet, the film never feels rushed or telescoped as movies derived from lengthy novels so often do.  Each character, whether major or minor, is given the opportunity to make his or her mark on the scene.  It's true that, in Dickens' world, the villains and eccentrics are generally far more intriguing and memorable than the comparatively pallid heroes and heroines, but McGrath has succeeded in making even those latter characters moving and interesting.  Above all, the film is blessed with a cast made up of first-rate performers who bring each of the author's creations to vivid life.  Charlie Hunnam, despite his having to embody a character who is a fairly one-dimensional, conventional ""pretty boy,"" manages to make Nicholas a bit more active and a bit less passive than he might have become in lesser hands.  Nathan Lane and Barry Humphries make a delightful couple as Mr. and Mrs. Crummles, the leaders of the fifth-rate theatrical troupe that, for a short while, becomes a family for young Nicholas.  Jim Broadbent enacts a fine comic villain as Mr. Squeers, the brutal but henpecked schoolmaster with whom Nicholas quite literally comes to blows.  The film's finest performance comes from the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer as Nicholas' evil Uncle Ralph.  Plummer understands that the key to conveying villainy effectively is by underplaying the role.  By doing so, he helps to ground the film with a much-needed center of gravity.Special recognition should go to the handsome production and costume design, to the fine cinematography and to the lovely score by Rachel Portman.  In fact, everyone involved in the making of ""Nicholas Nickelby"" should take a bow for converting such a fun, entertaining novel into such a fun, entertaining film.

754667,AEM0D3OFOR9RQ,B00009MEJ0,Sara,"[7, 7]","Let me start off by saying that I never read the book upon which this film is based. But it must have been a difficult one for Douglas McGrath to pare down to a sizable feature. He pulls it off with visual flair and elegant character acting. The film is as sumptious and enjoyable as McGrath's other adaptation 'Emma' from 1996 with Gwyneth Paltrow. Charlie Hunnam, whom I had only seen on the short lived Fox series 'Undeclared', gives an honorable performance as Nicholas Nickleby, the lead character in this ensemble piece. Nicholas unwittingly becomes head of his family at age 19 when his Father passes, leaving his family with little money. They travel to London to seek the help of their sinister Uncle Ralph (Christopher Plummer in an amazingly cold performance) who gets Nicholas a job at a frightening school run by the cruel Mr. and Mrs. Squeers (Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson, both almost stealing the show). There he meets the crippled Smike (Jamie Bell from 'Billy Elliot') whom he promises to protect. There's tons more but I'll leave the rest for you to discover should you decide to see the film.Just about every actor on screen is magnificent. Hunnam, Plummer, Broadbent, Stevenson, even Nathan Lane(!) bring such life to the screen. But my favorite performance was from 17-year-old Bell with the difficult role of Smike. He pulled it off masterfully and is sure to become a huge star in years to come. The one qualm I had with the picture was that Anne Hathaway as Nickleby's love interest had so little to do that her character was hardly of interest to me. Admittedly some things must be sacrificed when adapting from Dickens and I think it was much better on McGrath's part to focus on the relationship between Nickleby and Smike. McGrath himself does a great job directing. The film is perfectly set with glorious landscapes and colors. It is interesting how the scenes in the school house have hardly any color at all but once Nickelby and Smike escape, things start becoming bright again. All in all, it's a beautiful picture that definately deserves to be watched again and again.

The problem is essentailly Hunman (Nathan from the UK ""Queer as Folk""). He just does not have the ability to lead the film, his accent is his own (the slighty posh Geordie he always is, whether he is supposed to be a 21st century Mancunian Gay Man or a 19th century home counties Gentleman!) and he makes no attempt to become the mild mannered Nickelby. Moreover he is bullish, intense to point of being silly and the crassness of the scene when he ditches his shirt to reveal his muscles is beyond measure. It seems to demonstrate nothing more than the director's attempt to remind you of why Hunman became famous, the afore mentioned ""Queer as Folk""; the sad thing is that even in that programme Hunman was always out of his depth, unable to blend or assimilate and just a little too aware of his own ego at the expense of the performance. Unfortunately he behaves similarly in this film and it translates as a 21st century thug having taken over the spirit of Nickelby.

Charlie Hunnam as Nicholas is wonderfully young but does not shrink from the challenges before him.  Jamie Bell (&quot;Billy Elliot&quot;) is so good as the abused and crippled Smike he makes me weep -- proving that his mesmerising performance in &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; was no fluke.  This young man is the real thing, and I'll be first in line when his next movie (&quot;Undertow,&quot; with Josh Lucas and Dermot Mulroney) is released. The supporting characters are flawlessly cast and add the humor needed to prevent drowning in the depressing darkness of Dickens' world.  The butler to Nicholas' uncle has the most wickedly droll lines in the entire movie and will move you to fits of laughter at a couple of points.Nicholas Nickelby is a young man of nineteen when his father dies, thrusting him from his happy life into a world of grief and adversity, and leaving him responsible for the wellbeing of his young sister and his mother.  Together they travel to London, accurately depicted as the dark, dreary, and even scary place it was in the nineteenth century, to seek help from their only other living relative, Nicholas' Uncle Ralph Nickelby.  Ralph, very well portrayed by the always fabulous Christopher Plummer, is a cold-hearted old codger, evocative of Ebenezer Scrooge from &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; interested only in furthering his own fortune any way he can, even if it means harming others.  He only begrudgingly helps his dead brother's family, shipping Nicholas off to teach in a Yorkshire boys' &quot;school&quot; that is more like a prison camp, and obtaining employment for Nicholas' sister and mother as seamstresses.  His behaviour grows even more heinous when he attempts to prostitute his niece, inviting her to his home ostensibly to act as a hostess, but in reality as a potential plaything for his lascivious business cohorts.  Meanwhile, Nicholas finds himself doing the best job he can under very distressing circumstances, but eventually escapes the school, rescuing the crippled Smike and taking him under his wing.If you've read the book you already know the rest, but out of consideration for those who don't know the story, I won't tell any more of it.  This movie is beautifully photographed and visually rich; I wish I had seen it in the theatre.  I highly recommend this film for anyone over six years old, although sensitive children might be disturbed by the malicious mistreatment of the students in the boys' school.  It's also a great way to introduce reluctant students to the classic storytelling of Charles Dickens.  I find that as a homeschooler, my own children are inspired to read far more difficult literature than they otherwise would if they have seen a really good film adaptation first.",5,Delightfully humorous for such a dark tale...,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,2964,"['love', 'Dickens', 'same', 'reason', 'love', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'good', 'always', 'triumphs', 'evil', 'something', 'see', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'real', 'life', 'adaptation', 'quot', 'Nicholas', 'Nickelby', 'quot', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Nicholas', 'wonderfully', 'young', 'not', 'shrink', 'challenges', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'quot', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'quot', 'so', 'good', 'abused', 'crippled', 'Smike', 'weep', 'proving', 'mesmerising', 'performance', 'quot', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'quot', 'was', 'fluke', 'young', 'man', 'real', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'line', 'when', 'next', 'movie', 'quot', 'Undertow', 'quot', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'released', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'flawlessly', 'cast', 'add', 'humor', 'needed', 'prevent', 'drowning', 'depressing', 'darkness', 'Dickens', 'world', 'butler', 'Nicholas', 'uncle', 'most', 'wickedly', 'droll', 'lines', 'entire', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'fits', 'laughter', 'couple', 'points.Nicholas', 'Nickelby', 'young', 'man', 'nineteen', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'thrusting', 'happy', 'life', 'world', 'grief', 'adversity', 'leaving', 'responsible', 'wellbeing', 'young', 'sister', 'mother', 'Together', 'travel', 'London', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'dark', 'dreary', 'even', 'scary', 'place', 'was', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'seek', 'help', 'only', 'other', 'living', 'relative', 'Nicholas', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'Nickelby', 'Ralph', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'always', 'fabulous', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'cold-hearted', 'old', 'codger', 'evocative', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'quot', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'quot', 'interested', 'only', 'furthering', 'own', 'fortune', 'way', 'can', 'even', 'harming', 'others', 'only', 'begrudgingly', 'dead', 'brother', 'family', 'shipping', 'Nicholas', 'teach', 'Yorkshire', 'boys', 'quot', 'school', 'quot', 'more', 'prison', 'camp', 'obtaining', 'employment', 'Nicholas', 'sister', 'mother', 'seamstresses', 'behaviour', 'grows', 'even', 'more', 'heinous', 'when', 'prostitute', 'niece', 'inviting', 'home', 'ostensibly', 'act', 'hostess', 'reality', 'potential', 'plaything', 'lascivious', 'business', 'cohorts', 'Meanwhile', 'Nicholas', 'doing', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'very', 'distressing', 'circumstances', 'eventually', 'school', 'rescuing', 'crippled', 'Smike', 'taking', 'wing.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'already', 'know', 'rest', 'consideration', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'visually', 'rich', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'theatre', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'sensitive', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'disturbed', 'malicious', 'mistreatment', 'students', 'boys', 'school', 'also', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'reluctant', 'students', 'classic', 'storytelling', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'find', 'homeschooler', 'own', 'children', 'are', 'inspired', 'read', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'literature', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'adaptation', 'first']",N/A
754674,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00009MEJ0,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 8]","One of the reasons why I love Dickens but I hateOliver Twistis because Oliver Twist is TOO good. There's too much of the innocent child who is never besmirched by the criminals around him and never thinks of committing any crimes. He's one of the most irritating deadly dull characters in fiction. Not even the more interesting Artful Dodger or Fagin can save him. Granted,Slumdog Millionaireproved that basic story of an innocent staying innocent through poverty and corruption is still compelling (especially when the main character actually DOES steal to live) but Oliver Twist is still my least favorite Dickens book.Until now. Well, actually I have the book. It might be better than this. However, I don't have high hopes. Like Oliver Twist, the main character is deadly dull. He's virtuous. He always does the right thing. He even has a sister to protect. And it doesn't help matters that the actor playing him is one of the most wooden actors I've seen in a long time. He looks like Heath Ledger and he's playing the kind of part that Heath Ledger would have played at the time; but he's nowhere near as charismatic as Ledger was inA Knights Tale - Movie Poster - 11 x 17. He's dull. And he's peevish. And the entire movie rests on the audience relating to him.We don't.The sad part of the movie is the amount of talent that surrounds him. Anne Hathaway is the girlfriend. Jim Broadbent is the comically evil orphanage manager. Christopher Plummer is the seriously evil uncle. Nathan Lane is the theater manager. And they are all really trying to get the most out of their roles. But every single one of them must bow to the black hole of non-personality that is the main actor. And don't get me started on the terrible music that is from the film score standards of uplifting music. And like all canned uplifting music, it's almost as dull as the main actor.There are other versions of Nicholas Nickleby out there, including one with the always beautiful Sophia Myles, but I will wait until I read the book to see if it's any good.

It begins by asking the viewer about what would you do if you weren't under the protection of your parents basically-that totally hooked my kids. Next came some of very scary adventures at the nasty boys school which totally horrified my children, the deep friendship between Smike and Nicholas that ended up making my 8 year old cry towards the end, and a satisfying ending that made them understand that even when the world is a cruel and heartless place, you can still make your way with dignity and charity, and form relationships and ""families"" with the good people who inevitably meet up with you along the way. My children were genuinely touched-we actually did some research on the fact that many NOrthern England schools were ghastly in their treatment of the children in the care, and that Squeers was actually modeled after a real man! This movie was a great starting point for my children to think about life in a philosophical context, and to wonder about life for others in different places and times. And heck, it made them a little more aware that they have it pretty good and that whining about not having the newest game system seems pretty lame in comparison to the true trials other children endured before them and even sadly, presently in many areas of the world today.

754676,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00009MEJ0,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Despite being overlooked on release, Douglas McGrath's wonderful 2002 version of Dickens' tale of good rewarded captures both the feel and the sound of Dickens remarkably well. This world is indeed lived in, and the characters are vividly realised. The underplayed theatricality of Nathan Lane's opening and closing narration, allied to a strong sense of the cinematic sets the perfect tone right from the start, and its reprise at the ending is almost a well-deserved bow from the filmmakers.It's even good enough to overcome the void at its center that is Charlie Hunnam, clearly cast for his looks since acting isn't a strong point. Indeed, it's bizarre that in a film with so many Americans, Canadians and Australians in its cast, the most unconvincing accent comes from a Brit, but Geordie Hunnam's curiously Scouse accent sticks out like a sore thumb, not only at odds with the rest of his family but also making him sound like a bored Beatle throughout - a kind of benign George Harrison without the `tache or the personality.Thankfully his blandness is more than compensated for by some excellent work by Christopher Plummer's villainous uncle, avoiding the usual caricature the role inspires, and Jim Broadbent, Juliet Stevenson and Heather Goldenhersch (boasting such a perfect English accent I was surprised to find she was American) as the hideous Squeers family, embracing it and pulling it off magnificently, while Nathan Lane and Dame Edna Everidge are truly inspired casting as the open-hearted but financially challenged theatricals Mr and Mrs Crummles. There's fine work from Timothy Spall, Tom Courtenay, Phil Davis and, most surprising of all, even Edward Fox as well. It doesn't avoid the sentimentality but manages to turn it into genuine emotion, not least because no-one falls into the trap of wildly overplaying - even Dame Edna.All in all an unexpectedly delightful, genuinely likeable, sincerely heartwarming film that deserved more success than it found - but as Mrs Crummles notes, in the great struggle between ""those aged combatants art and commerce... art, it would appear from the receipts, is in its usual position of jeopardy.",5,Virtue - and audiences - rewarded,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,2161,"['being', 'overlooked', 'release', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'wonderful', '2002', 'version', 'Dickens', 'tale', 'good', 'rewarded', 'captures', 'feel', 'sound', 'Dickens', 'remarkably', 'well', 'world', 'indeed', 'lived', 'characters', 'are', 'vividly', 'realised', 'underplayed', 'theatricality', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'opening', 'closing', 'narration', 'allied', 'strong', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'perfect', 'tone', 'right', 'start', 'reprise', 'ending', 'almost', 'well-deserved', 'bow', 'filmmakers.It', 'even', 'good', 'enough', 'overcome', 'void', 'center', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'clearly', 'cast', 'looks', 'acting', ""n't"", 'strong', 'point', 'Indeed', 'bizarre', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'Canadians', 'Australians', 'cast', 'most', 'unconvincing', 'accent', 'Brit', 'Geordie', 'Hunnam', 'curiously', 'Scouse', 'accent', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'not', 'only', 'odds', 'rest', 'family', 'also', 'making', 'sound', 'bored', 'Beatle', 'kind', 'benign', 'George', 'Harrison', 'tache', 'personality.Thankfully', 'blandness', 'more', 'compensated', 'excellent', 'work', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'villainous', 'uncle', 'avoiding', 'usual', 'caricature', 'role', 'inspires', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Heather', 'Goldenhersch', 'boasting', 'perfect', 'English', 'accent', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'was', 'American', 'hideous', 'Squeers', 'family', 'embracing', 'pulling', 'off', 'magnificently', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'Everidge', 'are', 'truly', 'inspired', 'casting', 'open-hearted', 'financially', 'challenged', 'theatricals', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Crummles', 'fine', 'work', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Phil', 'Davis', 'most', 'surprising', 'even', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'sentimentality', 'turn', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'not', 'least', 'no-one', 'falls', 'trap', 'wildly', 'overplaying', 'even', 'Dame', 'Edna.All', 'unexpectedly', 'delightful', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'sincerely', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'deserved', 'more', 'success', 'found', 'Mrs', 'Crummles', 'notes', 'great', 'struggle', 'aged', 'combatants', 'art', 'commerce', 'art', 'would', 'appear', 'receipts', 'usual', 'position', 'jeopardy']",N/A

But the original book contains more than 800 pages in paperback, so what can you do?  If you are a purist (and I'm not blaming you for that), and if you want the 'complete' film adaptaion of this huge novel of Dickens, see Royal Shakespear's stage producition (which runs more than 8 hours).Even though you spent only 120 minutes of your life, this 'Nicholas' has one great part in it -- its cating.  Charlie Hunnam as Nicholas, Romola Galai as Kate, Anne Hatherway as Madeline, Christopher Plummer as Ralph, Tom Courtenay as Newman Noggs, Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson as Mr.and Mrs. Squeers, Jamie Bell as Smike, and Nethan Lane as Vincent Crummles.  You also see Alan Cumming and Timothy Spall, so what do you want for more?The story is shortened to speed up the whole story, and you don't see some of the most interesting characters in the original novel (no annoying neighbour to Mrs Nickleby or Mr. Mantalini and his 'Dammit').  But the film wisely retains most of the impressive episodes, and the director Douglas McGrath makes it a point that 'Nicholas Nickleby' is a comedy (and it was nonimated for best comedy in Golden Globe Award).  His decision is right, for it is a comedy.  Even though the poor kids at Mr. Squeers' Dotheboys School are treated so badly with treacle, it still is a comedy, and Dickens wrote that way.Though Charlie Hunnam and Anne Hathaway are not bad -- actually they are talented actors -- these two characters are too weak to interest the viewers.  This is simply because Nicholas and Madeline are weaker creations in Dickens's original.But the good supports offer precious help, especially from perfectly cast Nathan Lane and Jamie Bell.  Jamie Bell's Smike is better than the original (which is drawn, I think, with patronizing tone) and Christopher Plummer's Ralph is also an admirable interpretaion in a sense that after doing so many wicked things, he can be a sympathetic character.No one can translate Dickens's gigantic story into 2 or 3 hours without cutting.  What matters is how to cut, and I for one think this film did it pretty well.  And it's good to see Dickens on big screen, for these days, many adaptaions, good as they are, are made for TV.

754680,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00009MEJ0,Westley,"[21, 29]","This adaptation of Dickens' NICHOLAS NICKLEBY was directed by Douglas McGrath, who also did 1996's excellent ""Emma.""  Nicholas is played by Charlie Hunnam (""Abandon,"" TV's ""Undeclared"" and UK version of ""Queer as Folk"").  The story begins after the death of Nicholas' father and the family's retreat to London.  In London, they seek the help of Uncle Ralph, whose lack of empathy leads him to farm out poor Nicholas as a teacher at a sadistic boy's school.  Nicholas soon breaks free of his servitude, bringing along his new friend, Smike.  As the story continues, Nicholas meets a succession of corrupt people, but he slowly builds a family and ""all ends well,"" in typical Dickens' fashion.The supporting cast is incredible, with many veterans of the stage and cinema appearing.  Christopher Plummer is suitably menacing as the evil uncle; Jim Broadbent (Oscar winner for ""Iris"") and Juliet Stevenson (""Truly, Madly, Deeply"") are sinister but oddly appealing as the Squeegs; and Tom Courtenay (""The Dresser"") is touching and funny as Noggs.The younger actors are also quite good.  Romola Garai (""I Capture the Castle"") is radiant as Nicholas' sister; American Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries"") does well with her accent; and Heather Goldenhersh (""The Believer"") is hilarious as the amorous Fanny Squeeg.  More unexpectedly, Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliott"") gives an extraordinarily touching performance as the sickly Smike, building on the promise he has already shown.Unfortunately, Charlie Hunnam is only ok, although he does bring an admirable degree of emotionality to the role.  Ultimately, he's too contemporary and delicate to fully pull off a period piece of this nature.  NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is quite enjoyable at times and has some very good attributes, but it also has some flaws.Why doesn't it work better?  I think the main reason is that the film obviously only presents a portion of Dickens' sprawling novel, but tries to include too many supporting characters and side-plots.  Dickens' plot machinations and dependence on coincidences simply don't work when taken too much out of context.  The film ultimately feels like a series of well-produced scenes that don't gel into a cohesive whole.  A number of stars (e.g., Nathan Lane, Alan Cummings, Dame Edna) also pop up in cameos that are, by and large, distracting.  A most admirable effort, but it falls short.DVD EXTRAS: Include an interesting director's commentary and a detailed behind-the-scenes documentary.",3,"Enjoyable, But Flawed Adaptation",1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,2479,"['adaptation', 'Dickens', 'NICHOLAS', 'NICKLEBY', 'was', 'directed', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'who', 'also', 'did', '1996', 'excellent', 'Emma', 'Nicholas', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Abandon', 'TV', 'Undeclared', 'UK', 'version', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'story', 'death', 'Nicholas', 'father', 'family', 'retreat', 'London', 'London', 'seek', 'help', 'Uncle', 'Ralph', 'lack', 'empathy', 'farm', 'out', 'poor', 'Nicholas', 'teacher', 'sadistic', 'boy', 'school', 'soon', 'breaks', 'free', 'servitude', 'bringing', 'new', 'friend', 'Smike', 'story', 'Nicholas', 'succession', 'corrupt', 'people', 'slowly', 'family', 'well', 'typical', 'Dickens', 'fashion.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'incredible', 'many', 'veterans', 'stage', 'cinema', 'appearing', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'suitably', 'menacing', 'evil', 'uncle', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Iris', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'are', 'sinister', 'oddly', 'appealing', 'Squeegs', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Dresser', 'touching', 'funny', 'Noggs.The', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'Capture', 'Castle', 'radiant', 'Nicholas', 'sister', 'American', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'well', 'accent', 'Heather', 'Goldenhersh', 'Believer', 'hilarious', 'amorous', 'Fanny', 'Squeeg', 'More', 'unexpectedly', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'extraordinarily', 'touching', 'performance', 'sickly', 'Smike', 'building', 'promise', 'already', 'shown.Unfortunately', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'only', 'ok', 'bring', 'admirable', 'degree', 'emotionality', 'role', 'Ultimately', 'too', 'contemporary', 'delicate', 'fully', 'pull', 'off', 'period', 'piece', 'nature', 'NICHOLAS', 'NICKLEBY', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'very', 'good', 'attributes', 'also', 'flaws.Why', ""n't"", 'work', 'better', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'obviously', 'only', 'portion', 'Dickens', 'sprawling', 'novel', 'tries', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'side-plots', 'Dickens', 'plot', 'machinations', 'dependence', 'coincidences', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'taken', 'too', 'much', 'context', 'film', 'ultimately', 'series', 'well-produced', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'number', 'stars', 'e.g.', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'also', 'pop', 'up', 'cameos', 'are', 'large', 'distracting', 'most', 'admirable', 'effort', 'short.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Include', 'interesting', 'director', 'commentary', 'detailed', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary']",N/A
