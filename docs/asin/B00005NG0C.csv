Since I am no fan of foggy darkness or modern dress, and my aesthetic sense is gravely offended by sparse sets in all shades of grey, I will pass over the production itself. Nor do I wish to elaborate on Kline's direction which is accomplished in a conventional sort of way. Let's concentrate on the acting and the characters, especially considering the relatively uncut nature of this version that offers you virtually all material Shakespeare thought necessary to invest in his characterisation.Kevin Kline is a very interesting but very uneven Prince. The main cause of my disappointment with his Hamlet is the same as with Branagh's: too much ham. The ''antic disposition'' is rife with the most violent histrionics. No matter how funny these may be - and there are some positively hilarious moments during the charade with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern or the inset play - they quickly become tedious. In some of the ''serious'' scenes - most notably the confrontation with Ophelia and the Closet Scene, but to a lesser extent almost everywhere else - Kline resorts to dreadful overacting that reduce my sympathy for the Dane to nearly non-existent levels. Dramatic intensity and sweeping passion may very well be achieved without shouting at the top of your voice or doing frantic gymnastics that gibbon could envy. I do not know if Hamlet's instructions to the players in Act III, Scene 2, are Shakespeare's own thoughts how acting should be done. But it's an excellent advice anyway.""Nor do not saw the airtoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and begeta temperance that may give it smoothness.""In those relatively rare moments when Kevin Kline is kind enough to avoid the blatant hamming up of each line, he is a force to be reckoned with. ''To be, or not to be'' and ''How do all occasions conspire against me'' are two fine examples how effective, indeed how shattering, calmness, restraint and, above all, carefully inflected delivery of the text can be. However, even here Kline's interpretation is sometimes compromised by haste, monotony or indifference. Any of these is harmful to a part in which every word matters so much.The rest of the cast is the same perplexing mixture as the protagonist. The not-so-young-as-she-looks Diane Venora easily steals the show as a genuinely tragic Ophelia, almost strong enough to stand against her father but ultimately crushed by Hamlet's cruelty. The ''mad scene'' is completely insane, not inappropriately so, and the rest is singularly natural, coherent and convincing portrayal. Of all others only Brian Murry made any impression on me, Polonius, Gertrude and Laertes being insignificant cameos, rather than vivid characters. I do think Claudius is the hardest part in the whole play - after Hamlet, of course. He has, though admittedly on a smaller scale, the same duality that makes the Prince such a magnetic creature. The King does have conscience that troubles him, but that should not be overstressed, for then his late and ruthless plans to eliminate Hamlet become implausible. I admire Brian Murry's performance because he conveys something of this complexity.Taken as a whole, Kevin Kline's ""Hamlet"" is certainly worth-seeing, especially as a preparation for other rather long versions, such as Jacobi's (1980) or Branagh's (1996) for example, that use much fewer cuts than usual and present the Prince as a volatile creature prone to put on his ''antic disposition'' every few minutes. It is essential to distinguish these portrayals from that of Richard Burton, the most histrionic, but also the most consistent, of all. As far as the production, the direction, and the rest of the cast are concerned, excluding Ophelia and Claudius of course, they have to be endured rather enjoyed.",3,"Interesting ""Hamlet"" from the Histrionic School",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,4126,"['Hamlet', '1990', 'TV', 'Great', 'Performances', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'HamletBrian', 'Murry', 'ClaudiusDana', 'Ivey', 'GertrudeDiane', 'Venora', 'OpheliaJosef', 'Sommer', 'PoloniusMichael', 'Cumpsty', 'LaertesDirected', 'Kevin', 'Kline.Colour', '182', 'min.As', 'Hamlet', 'adaptations', 'go', 'one', 'quite', 'mixed', 'bag', 'am', 'fan', 'foggy', 'darkness', 'modern', 'dress', 'aesthetic', 'sense', 'gravely', 'offended', 'sparse', 'sets', 'shades', 'grey', 'will', 'pass', 'production', 'do', 'wish', 'elaborate', 'Kline', 'direction', 'accomplished', 'conventional', 'sort', 'way', 'Let', 'concentrate', 'acting', 'characters', 'especially', 'considering', 'relatively', 'uncut', 'nature', 'version', 'virtually', 'material', 'Shakespeare', 'thought', 'necessary', 'invest', 'characterisation.Kevin', 'Kline', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'uneven', 'Prince', 'main', 'cause', 'disappointment', 'Hamlet', 'same', 'Branagh', 'too', 'much', 'ham', 'antic', 'disposition', 'rife', 'most', 'violent', 'histrionics', 'matter', 'how', 'funny', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'positively', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'charade', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'inset', 'play', 'quickly', 'become', 'tedious', 'serious', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'confrontation', 'Ophelia', 'Closet', 'Scene', 'lesser', 'extent', 'almost', 'everywhere', 'else', 'Kline', 'resorts', 'dreadful', 'overacting', 'reduce', 'sympathy', 'Dane', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'levels', 'Dramatic', 'intensity', 'sweeping', 'passion', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'achieved', 'shouting', 'top', 'voice', 'doing', 'frantic', 'gymnastics', 'gibbon', 'could', 'envy', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Hamlet', 'instructions', 'players', 'Act', 'III', 'Scene', '2', 'are', 'Shakespeare', 'own', 'thoughts', 'how', 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'excellent', 'advice', 'anyway', 'do', 'not', 'saw', 'airtoo', 'much', 'hand', 'thus', 'use', 'gently', 'very', 'torrent', 'tempest', 'may', 'say', 'whirlwind', 'passion', 'must', 'acquire', 'begeta', 'temperance', 'may', 'give', 'smoothness', 'relatively', 'rare', 'moments', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'kind', 'enough', 'avoid', 'blatant', 'hamming', 'line', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'How', 'do', 'occasions', 'conspire', 'are', 'two', 'fine', 'how', 'effective', 'indeed', 'how', 'shattering', 'calmness', 'restraint', 'carefully', 'inflected', 'delivery', 'text', 'can', 'be', 'However', 'even', 'here', 'Kline', 'interpretation', 'sometimes', 'compromised', 'haste', 'monotony', 'indifference', 'harmful', 'part', 'word', 'matters', 'so', 'much.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'same', 'perplexing', 'mixture', 'protagonist', 'not-so-young-as-she-looks', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'easily', 'show', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'Ophelia', 'almost', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'father', 'ultimately', 'crushed', 'Hamlet', 'cruelty', 'mad', 'scene', 'completely', 'insane', 'not', 'inappropriately', 'so', 'rest', 'singularly', 'natural', 'coherent', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'others', 'only', 'Brian', 'Murry', 'made', 'impression', 'Polonius', 'Gertrude', 'Laertes', 'being', 'insignificant', 'cameos', 'rather', 'vivid', 'characters', 'do', 'think', 'Claudius', 'hardest', 'part', 'whole', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'course', 'though', 'admittedly', 'smaller', 'scale', 'same', 'duality', 'Prince', 'magnetic', 'creature', 'King', 'have', 'conscience', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overstressed', 'then', 'late', 'ruthless', 'plans', 'eliminate', 'Hamlet', 'become', 'implausible', 'admire', 'Brian', 'Murry', 'performance', 'something', 'complexity.Taken', 'whole', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Hamlet', 'certainly', 'worth-seeing', 'especially', 'preparation', 'other', 'rather', 'long', 'versions', 'such', 'Jacobi', '1980', 'Branagh', '1996', 'example', 'use', 'much', 'fewer', 'cuts', 'usual', 'present', 'Prince', 'volatile', 'creature', 'prone', 'put', 'antic', 'disposition', 'few', 'minutes', 'essential', 'distinguish', 'portrayals', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'most', 'histrionic', 'also', 'most', 'consistent', 'As', 'far', 'production', 'direction', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'concerned', 'excluding', 'Ophelia', 'Claudius', 'course', 'have', 'be', 'endured', 'rather', 'enjoyed']",Hamlet / New York Shakespeare Festival

668045,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00005NG0C,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[2, 2]","This 1990 version of Hamlet, starring Kevin Kline in the title role, was filmed from an actual Broadway production. On one hand it means this is perhaps as close as you could get to the ""authentic Shakespeare feel"" in a movie. They are not taking advantage of gorgeous landscapes or thousands of extras. They are acting on a stage, live in front of an audience, bounded by its stage walls just as in Shakespeare's time. On the other hand, Kevin chose to move the setting forward into a much more modern time period. The actors are wearing suits and military uniforms, and seem to be in the 1940s.I'm generally not a fan of ""adjusting Hamlet's time"". I understand the desire to shake things up a bit, to not simply re-tell a tale that's been told thousands of times before. Still, it is jarring to see Hamlet's uncle looking almost like Captain Kirk in his ribbons. I admit I do like Ophelia's gentle dress, so there is some good in what they've done. The set tends towards the stark, concrete pillar look. I would have liked it to look more regal, more like a castle that had been lived in and loved for centuries.The thing that stands out most about this performance is the over-the-top emotions. Hamlet is wriggling around on the stage, tears streaming down his face. He's picking up Ophelia and flinging her around in circles. He's falling backwards off of platforms, being caught by others. Oddly, then there are other lines which I would have thought warranted such emotion - and they are given with barely a flicker of interest. It's a bit jarring.My boyfriend had problems because of Kline's very distinctive voice. We've seen him in so many other movies that my boyfriend almost expected Kline to break out of character sometimes and do a new accent. I didn't have this problem myself, but I could see how it might happen. Kline doesn't ""submerge"" himself well into this character.  He seems like an antic Kline playing a part.That being said, I did feel new poignancy at several lines, where they really nailed a certain emotion. Still, somehow they trimmed out some of my favorite lines too. I do like that they kept in the Fortinbras storyline, even having him arrive at the end to sort of ""end the loop"" since Hamlet was born when Fortinbras' father was slain.Where in other versions there would be one or another of the ""supporting cast"" that stood out to me, in this one none of them did, which I felt was a shame. Horatio, one of my favorite characters, was very mild here, almost stilted to me. Ophelia seemed a bit too willful given her dutiful daughter dialogue. Both the mother and uncle were lacking in presence, especially the uncle who supposedly had talents of charisma. Even Laertes seemed a bit wooden to me.I'm not saying they were ""stagey wooden"" - I have certainly seem versions where it seemed like everyone was nervously reciting the words by rote as they marched from spot A to spot B. There were some good emotions shown on some lines. Still, in general the characters didn't seem ""real"" - they seemed parts being played.I definitely own this and would recommend other Hamlet fans have it in their library. However, it's not one I go back to for the pure pleasure of watching and enjoying it, of listening to the words roll.",4,Worth Including in your Library,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,3256,"['1990', 'version', 'Hamlet', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'filmed', 'actual', 'Broadway', 'production', 'one', 'hand', 'perhaps', 'as', 'close', 'could', 'get', 'authentic', 'Shakespeare', 'feel', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'taking', 'advantage', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes', 'thousands', 'extras', 'are', 'acting', 'stage', 'live', 'front', 'audience', 'bounded', 'stage', 'walls', 'just', 'Shakespeare', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'Kevin', 'chose', 'move', 'setting', 'forward', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'time', 'period', 'actors', 'are', 'wearing', 'suits', 'military', 'uniforms', 'seem', 'be', '1940s.I', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'adjusting', 'Hamlet', 'time', 'understand', 'desire', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'not', 'simply', 're-tell', 'tale', 'been', 'told', 'thousands', 'times', 'Still', 'jarring', 'see', 'Hamlet', 'uncle', 'looking', 'almost', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'ribbons', 'admit', 'do', 'Ophelia', 'gentle', 'dress', 'good', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'set', 'stark', 'concrete', 'pillar', 'look', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'look', 'more', 'regal', 'more', 'castle', 'had', 'been', 'lived', 'loved', 'centuries.The', 'thing', 'out', 'most', 'performance', 'over-the-top', 'emotions', 'Hamlet', 'wriggling', 'around', 'stage', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'picking', 'up', 'Ophelia', 'flinging', 'around', 'circles', 'falling', 'backwards', 'platforms', 'being', 'caught', 'others', 'Oddly', 'then', 'are', 'other', 'lines', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'warranted', 'such', 'emotion', 'are', 'given', 'barely', 'flicker', 'interest', 'bit', 'jarring.My', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'problems', 'Kline', 'very', 'distinctive', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'boyfriend', 'almost', 'expected', 'Kline', 'break', 'character', 'sometimes', 'do', 'new', 'accent', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'happen', 'Kline', ""n't"", 'submerge', 'well', 'character', 'antic', 'Kline', 'playing', 'part.That', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'feel', 'new', 'poignancy', 'several', 'lines', 'where', 'really', 'nailed', 'certain', 'emotion', 'Still', 'somehow', 'trimmed', 'out', 'favorite', 'lines', 'too', 'do', 'kept', 'Fortinbras', 'storyline', 'even', 'having', 'arrive', 'end', 'sort', 'end', 'loop', 'Hamlet', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'Fortinbras', 'father', 'was', 'slain.Where', 'other', 'versions', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stood', 'out', 'one', 'none', 'did', 'felt', 'was', 'shame', 'Horatio', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'very', 'mild', 'here', 'almost', 'stilted', 'Ophelia', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'willful', 'given', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'dialogue', 'mother', 'uncle', 'were', 'lacking', 'presence', 'especially', 'uncle', 'who', 'supposedly', 'had', 'talents', 'charisma', 'Even', 'seemed', 'bit', 'wooden', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'were', 'stagey', 'wooden', 'have', 'certainly', 'seem', 'versions', 'where', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'was', 'nervously', 'reciting', 'words', 'rote', 'marched', 'spot', 'spot', 'B', 'were', 'good', 'emotions', 'shown', 'lines', 'Still', 'general', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'seemed', 'parts', 'being', 'played.I', 'definitely', 'own', 'would', 'recommend', 'other', 'Hamlet', 'fans', 'have', 'library', 'However', 'not', 'one', 'go', 'back', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'listening', 'words', 'roll']",Hamlet / New York Shakespeare Festival

Rozencrantz & Guildenstern, for instance, were kept in, as well as Fortinbras.  There are important scenes and stories with both so I was glad to see them there.I also like Kevin Kline's Hamlet.  At first I thought I wouldn't, because in his first scene (""little more than kin & less than kind""), he didn't seem bitter enough to my taste.  I also though that, as an actor, Kline sometimes over did the crying.  But as he eased into the role and I grew used to it, I began to like his interpretation.  He was very good at personifying Hamlet's merry but oh so bitter madness.Everyone else was, I thought, well cast, which the exception of Ophelia.  How lamentable, especially when her brother was so well played!  Apparently she was trying to give a new interpretation of an Ophelia more wayward and rebellious than usual...but Shakespeare wrote Ophelia, and he made her gentle,not wild (until that madness sets in and that's for contrast); timid, not self-assured.  ""I will the effect of this good lesson keep"" was spoken with sarcasm!  Sarcasm to Laertes from Ophelia?  What is the point in life?  Admirably, however, Laertes and Hamlet both played their scenes with her excellently in spite of her shortcomings.  There was a LOT of physical action during Hamlet's scenes both with his mother & Ophelia; a bit more than I'm used to, but it seems to be Kline's strong point.I have to admit that modern dress in Shakespeare always gets under my skin.  Why are they in post-victorian dress and speaking in ""thees & thous""?  The grandeur of Elizabethan costume that so sweeps the audience in is not good enough for them?  But this Hamlet was very well performed, and though the clothing still clashes with its historical context, I had forgotten about it fifteen minutes into the play.Oh, dear, I'm giving this four stars.  I'm just so in love with Hamlet I can't nitpick such a good production apart.
