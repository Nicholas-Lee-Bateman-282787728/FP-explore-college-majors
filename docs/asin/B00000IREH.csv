505099,A3PQ38JCLF3I93,B00000IREH,Anaguma,"[19, 20]","This is the first movie by Japanese director Juzo Itami, depicting the Japanese perspective on a subject that most of us would like to avoid.  However, with a humorous eye, he presents a universally appealing approach, showing that humankind, despite cultural differences, is the basically the same:  the funeral is for the family and friends as much as for the deceased.I purchased the DVD because it took forever to find a copy of the VHS, and didn't want to miss the chance.  However, the Fox-Lorber FLV5109 release is little improvement over the VHS.  The video portion is sharper.  However, it is still a cut down version with the subtitles occasionally disappearing off the screen (this happens on the VHS also).  The subtitles are burned into the video track so you can't turn them off.  The sound to me sounds mono, whereas the VHS is stereo.  This could just be my poor hearing ;).Conclusion:  The film is well worth owning.  However, if you already have a VHS copy, the only reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; is for a slightly sharper image or having it on a more durable format.  The DVD also gives a filmography for the main actors, about the only plus.  If you don't own it, you can get almost the same quality on the VHS....  If money is no object, the DVD is OK; just don't expect anything beyond owning  VHS quality with fast scene selection. ...",3,Itami's first deserves better!!,979257600,"01 12, 2001",2001,1358,"['first', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Juzo', 'Itami', 'depicting', 'Japanese', 'perspective', 'subject', 'most', 'would', 'like', 'avoid', 'However', 'humorous', 'eye', 'universally', 'appealing', 'approach', 'showing', 'humankind', 'cultural', 'differences', 'basically', 'same', 'funeral', 'family', 'as', 'much', 'deceased.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'took', 'forever', 'find', 'copy', 'VHS', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'chance', 'However', 'Fox-Lorber', 'FLV5109', 'release', 'little', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'video', 'portion', 'sharper', 'However', 'still', 'cut', 'down', 'version', 'subtitles', 'occasionally', 'disappearing', 'off', 'screen', 'VHS', 'also', 'subtitles', 'are', 'burned', 'video', 'track', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'mono', 'VHS', 'stereo', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'poor', 'hearing', '.Conclusion', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'However', 'already', 'have', 'VHS', 'copy', 'only', 'reason', 'quot', 'quot', 'slightly', 'sharper', 'image', 'having', 'more', 'durable', 'format', 'DVD', 'also', 'filmography', 'main', 'actors', 'only', 'plus', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'can', 'get', 'almost', 'same', 'quality', 'VHS', 'money', 'object', 'DVD', 'OK', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'owning', 'VHS', 'quality', 'fast', 'scene', 'selection']",The Funeral

Some elements of the humor were universal... and I still could appreciate the Itami Juzo's dry surrealism... but after seeing the film I came to live in Japan on and off for 9 years and went through the experience, watching the film went beyond &quot;interesting and sometimes funny&quot;... one one had it was incredibly cathartic... on the other hands, uncomfortably hillarious... Its one of those films that if you'd just been through the experience and you watched it, it would definitely serve as a cathartic dose of laughter... - - Too many scenes, unfortunately, parody experiences and rituals (sometimes seemingly senseless, others incomprehensibly complex) that you'd really have to experience to appreciate...  If you haven't been through them, those scenes might be a bit boring... for this reason my advice is this : read up on the subject first... and also, watch the film with an understanding that Japanese funerals are very different than Western funerals... The strange scenes in this film in many way present Japanese funerals as they are, and in other ways parody them...All in all, having been lucky to have gone 9 years without any close personal losses in Japan, but recnetly having lost an important member of our family, I can't tell you how thankful I am that Juzo Itami made this film !",5,Cathartic and Hillarious if...,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,1570,"['order', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'experience', 'reason', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'not', 'get', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'really', 'knew', 'very', 'much', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'elements', 'humor', 'were', 'universal', 'still', 'could', 'appreciate', 'Itami', 'Juzo', 'dry', 'surrealism', 'seeing', 'film', 'came', 'live', 'Japan', '9', 'years', 'went', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'went', 'quot', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'quot', 'one', 'one', 'had', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cathartic', 'other', 'hands', 'uncomfortably', 'hillarious', 'one', 'films', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'experience', 'watched', 'would', 'definitely', 'serve', 'cathartic', 'dose', 'laughter', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'unfortunately', 'parody', 'experiences', 'rituals', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'senseless', 'others', 'incomprehensibly', 'complex', ""'d"", 'really', 'have', 'experience', 'appreciate', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'boring', 'reason', 'advice', 'read', 'up', 'subject', 'first', 'also', 'watch', 'film', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'funerals', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Western', 'funerals', 'strange', 'scenes', 'film', 'many', 'way', 'present', 'Japanese', 'funerals', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'parody', 'having', 'been', 'lucky', 'have', 'gone', '9', 'years', 'close', 'personal', 'losses', 'Japan', 'recnetly', 'having', 'lost', 'important', 'member', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'thankful', 'am', 'Juzo', 'Itami', 'made', 'film']",The Funeral
505101,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00000IREH,Ernest Jagger,"[0, 0]","First of all, I would like to comment on the DVD itself. I purchased this film some time ago, and hopefully someone can do a better job at restoring the films cinematic quality which it deserves. The spotlight reviewer addresses this problem in his review. This is one of a few Fox Lorber DVDs of Japanese films I own, and it appears they really do not believe in putting any effort into the films they transfer to DVD. Therefore, for those viewers who wish to purchase this film, be aware that the DVD is lacking in many areas. And the top spotlight reviewer mentions all of them in his review.I never really thought that this film was a comedy. But more of a subtle and nuanced humor. [Although there are humorous elements in the film] I believe that because Fox put this as a dark-comedy on their cover, they figured it might sell better. Some of the reviewers skewer this film, however, I liked it. There are many different levels of emotions going on in this film. First and foremost is the tragedy of having to deal with death. And how one responds to the death of a family member: In this case the recently deceased father. I found the film sad in how the characters go through the traditional rituals expected of them in a modern Japan, that they must view videos on the proper responses such as the right greetings; and have to hire experts on what direction the coffin must be placed.It's as if the deceased father is taking a back seat to a ritual, where the emotional pain and stress of having someone close to them is placed at an arms length: A sort of emotional supression. The death of any loved one is difficult enough for any of us to have to go through. And yet we all must face these realities at some point in our lives. However, director Juzo Itami did a great job [his first film] in a very nuanced way, in trying to show this critque of a funeral in Japanese society. Therefore, this film, and Juzo Itami he must be given credit for giving a very honest critique of Japanese culture, and how death is handled by the Japanese: The absurd, ridiculous, selfish, emotional and loving.

505104,A1210LB3L9GD4J,B00000IREH,Patrick Mc Coy,"[0, 0]","I think that Departures owes a debt to Juzo Itami's assured directing debut, The Funeral (1984). Itami went onto make several other impressive films including Tampopo and A Taxing Woman, with essentially the same roster of lead actors. The tone of this film vacillates between drama and farce. This film looks at the entire process of a funeral that includes finding a coffin, transporting the body, hiring a priest, following etiquette, and putting on a wake for the deceased. It is also a study of relationships among the family, neighbors, and mistresses. There is a scene in which the deceased daughter and husband watch videotape on etiquette on what to do at the funeral that is mirrored in Departures.  I am assuming the focus of the rituals was inspiration al to that film as was the moving short silent black and white film made by a family friend film that punctuates the narrative. It is a dramatically moving piece that has a string orchestra score in the background, which predates the cello based orchestra score of Departures. Itami's debut has some impressive set pieces and cinematography and shows a director already in control of his craft, my only complaint would be that it could have been shortened somewhat.",4,"Before ""Departures"" There Was ""The Funeral""",1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,1230,"['think', 'debt', 'Juzo', 'Itami', 'assured', 'directing', 'debut', 'Funeral', '1984', 'Itami', 'went', 'make', 'several', 'other', 'impressive', 'films', 'including', 'Tampopo', 'A', 'Taxing', 'Woman', 'essentially', 'same', 'roster', 'lead', 'actors', 'tone', 'film', 'drama', 'farce', 'film', 'entire', 'process', 'funeral', 'finding', 'coffin', 'transporting', 'body', 'hiring', 'priest', 'following', 'etiquette', 'putting', 'wake', 'deceased', 'also', 'study', 'relationships', 'family', 'neighbors', 'mistresses', 'scene', 'deceased', 'daughter', 'husband', 'watch', 'videotape', 'etiquette', 'what', 'do', 'funeral', 'mirrored', 'Departures', 'am', 'assuming', 'focus', 'rituals', 'was', 'inspiration', 'al', 'film', 'was', 'moving', 'short', 'silent', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'made', 'family', 'friend', 'film', 'narrative', 'dramatically', 'moving', 'piece', 'string', 'orchestra', 'score', 'background', 'cello', 'based', 'orchestra', 'score', 'Departures', 'Itami', 'debut', 'impressive', 'set', 'pieces', 'cinematography', 'director', 'already', 'control', 'craft', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'somewhat']",The Funeral

Having spent four years in Japan I wanted to see for myself what all the controversy was about surrounding 'The Funeral'. Well, I really liked this film, and found it had a lot to offer. From start to finish there is a lot going on at all levels of the emotional spectrum. I found it very touching, a little sad, a little funny, and very human. The quiet love and dignity of the widow and her daughter are the glue that hold the family and friends together.

505107,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00000IREH,Zack Davisson,"[10, 10]","There are times when death has been appropriate and hilarious material for a comedy. The juxtaposition of the seriousness of a funeral with wacky hijinks and hootenannies makes for funny stuff. But don't expect to find any of that in Itami's social commentary, ""The Funeral"" (""O-soshiki"").It is, in fact, an incredibly insightful exposition of the meaninglessness of tradition and ritual in modern Japan. A family, so far removed from the society that first created these traditions, tries to struggle though an ""appropriate"" funeral for the deceased father. They rent videos on appropriate greetings and responses, they hire experts to tell them what direction the coffin should face, and how many sticks of incense to light. The ritual has far more importance too the family than the actual loss of the father, as does presenting a proper face.The elderly, as the vanguard of the traditions, are the only ones who care. In fact, the dead man's daughters are shocked and impressed when one of their father's friends shows actual sorrow at the loss. ""That's the way to do it,"" they say. Money is the symbolism for the loss of tradition, the idol that has replaced emotion at the altar. The Buddhist priest is made a gift of Italian tiles for his garden, and the climax of the film is when a case of money opens up to the wind, and the family grasps at it desperately.While rough in nature, and clearly a first film, Itami manages to artfully wrap these various elements together, without stating the message directly. In the Japanese style, much is implied and little is said. A particularly capturing moment, is a black and white home movie of the family laughing and having fun, while a sad lament plays in the background. The pace is slow and patient.The critique of Japanese culture is honest and authentic, and I highly recomend this film to anyone who wants to see real Japanese people living real Japanese lives.",4,A wry commentary on the loss of meaning in traditions,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,1919,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'death', 'been', 'appropriate', 'hilarious', 'material', 'comedy', 'juxtaposition', 'seriousness', 'funeral', 'wacky', 'hijinks', 'hootenannies', 'funny', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'Itami', 'social', 'commentary', 'Funeral', 'O-soshiki', '.It', 'fact', 'incredibly', 'insightful', 'exposition', 'meaninglessness', 'tradition', 'ritual', 'modern', 'Japan', 'A', 'family', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'society', 'first', 'created', 'traditions', 'tries', 'struggle', 'appropriate', 'funeral', 'deceased', 'father', 'rent', 'videos', 'appropriate', 'greetings', 'responses', 'hire', 'experts', 'tell', 'direction', 'coffin', 'should', 'face', 'how', 'many', 'sticks', 'incense', 'light', 'ritual', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'too', 'family', 'actual', 'loss', 'father', 'presenting', 'proper', 'face.The', 'elderly', 'vanguard', 'traditions', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'care', 'fact', 'dead', 'man', 'daughters', 'are', 'shocked', 'impressed', 'when', 'one', 'father', 'friends', 'actual', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'way', 'do', 'say', 'Money', 'symbolism', 'loss', 'tradition', 'idol', 'replaced', 'emotion', 'altar', 'Buddhist', 'priest', 'made', 'gift', 'Italian', 'tiles', 'garden', 'climax', 'film', 'when', 'case', 'money', 'up', 'wind', 'family', 'grasps', 'desperately.While', 'rough', 'nature', 'clearly', 'first', 'film', 'Itami', 'artfully', 'wrap', 'various', 'elements', 'together', 'stating', 'message', 'directly', 'Japanese', 'style', 'much', 'implied', 'little', 'said', 'particularly', 'capturing', 'moment', 'black', 'white', 'home', 'movie', 'family', 'laughing', 'having', 'fun', 'sad', 'lament', 'plays', 'background', 'pace', 'slow', 'patient.The', 'critique', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'honest', 'authentic', 'highly', 'recomend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'real', 'Japanese', 'people', 'living', 'real', 'Japanese', 'lives']",The Funeral
