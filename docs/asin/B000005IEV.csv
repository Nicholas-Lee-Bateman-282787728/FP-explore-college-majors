There is nothing quite like showing it to a friend or date who has never heard of it nor seen it. Without exception, they've always been as thrilled with and moved by this masterpiece as I was upon discovering it for myself back in days of video tape. It is one of those rare works of film art that demands repeated viewings; even now I still get something new from it with each added showing. After all this time, LILIES still leaves me in awe.A cinematic ""play within a play,"" it is superb example of the filmmaker's mastery of technique. Transitions between past and present, between prison and real life, between costume-wearing inmates and actual characters ... all of these segues are as smooth as the surface of the glass from which a movie camera's lens is made.The actors are as close to perfection as actors can be.While leaving a few minor puzzles in its wake (I've never fully understood the matricide scene but great films SHOULD leave questions in our minds), the script effortlessly sweeps the viewer along through joy and ultimate heartbreak to the stunning and open-ended denouement of the cowardly Bishop Bilodeau forced to exact a self-inflicted penance of his own choosing while Simon walks away from him in disgust.LILIES is a truly beautiful experience depicting a great tragedy of star-crossed male lovers.

I had read many positive reviews before ordering the DVD, but still I was not prepared for how good this movie is; the film could not possibly have won all the awards it deserves.Simply put, Lilies is captivating from the opening sceneThe cast is excellent, particularly the two leads, Jason Cadieux as the young Simon and Danny Gilmore as Vallier, but there isn't a weak character in the film. Matthew Ferguson turns in a powerful performance as the young Bilodeau and Brent Carver is magnificent as the Countess in delicious supporting roles.The transitions from present day to flashback and back again transpire so beguilingly you find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is exceptional, to say the very least. This is good filmmaking, regardless of the subject matter.Lillies is not my sentimental favorite gay film, however; in fact, it's a bit of a downer. The love story within the story is beautiful, as well as being beautifully told and acted. Most focus on the extraordinarily handsome Cadieux as the young Simon, but the real heart of the story is Vallier, without whom Simon is just another pretty boy, as he comes to realize. The character of Vallier is nailed, absolutely, by Gilmore, who is fetching in his own right. His confrontation of Simon in the bathtub scene at the end is as powerful a scene as any in gay cinema. The intensity of passion and nuances of emotion Gilmore brings to this scene, as well as his entire role, are riveting.But the confrontation between the older Simon and Bilodeau is less uplifting. I am not a Catholic, so I am not being defensive, but I found this twist of the story a bit too easy, a bit too much of a cliche, and I did not feel the older Simon's need for revenge nearly as strongly as I felt the passion of the young Vallier.These objections having been stated however, if John Greyson (or anybody for that matter) has ever made a better gay film, I would like to know about it.",5,Riveting.,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2142,"['Lilies', 'be', 'best', 'gay', 'film', 'overall', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'struggling', 'words', 'adequately', 'express', 'appreciation', 'other', 'urge', 'others', 'see', 'had', 'read', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'won', 'awards', 'deserves.Simply', 'put', 'Lilies', 'captivating', 'opening', 'sceneThe', 'cast', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'two', 'leads', 'Jason', 'Cadieux', 'young', 'Simon', 'Danny', 'Gilmore', 'Vallier', ""n't"", 'weak', 'character', 'film', 'Matthew', 'Ferguson', 'powerful', 'performance', 'young', 'Bilodeau', 'Brent', 'Carver', 'magnificent', 'Countess', 'delicious', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'transitions', 'present', 'day', 'flashback', 'back', 'again', 'transpire', 'so', 'beguilingly', 'find', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'soundtrack', 'exceptional', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'regardless', 'subject', 'matter.Lillies', 'not', 'sentimental', 'favorite', 'gay', 'film', 'however', 'fact', 'bit', 'downer', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'beautifully', 'told', 'acted', 'Most', 'focus', 'extraordinarily', 'handsome', 'Cadieux', 'young', 'Simon', 'real', 'heart', 'story', 'Vallier', 'whom', 'Simon', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'realize', 'character', 'Vallier', 'nailed', 'absolutely', 'Gilmore', 'who', 'fetching', 'own', 'right', 'confrontation', 'Simon', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'end', 'as', 'powerful', 'scene', 'gay', 'cinema', 'intensity', 'passion', 'nuances', 'emotion', 'Gilmore', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'role', 'are', 'confrontation', 'older', 'Simon', 'Bilodeau', 'less', 'uplifting', 'am', 'not', 'Catholic', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'defensive', 'found', 'twist', 'story', 'bit', 'too', 'easy', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'cliche', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'older', 'Simon', 'need', 'revenge', 'nearly', 'as', 'strongly', 'felt', 'passion', 'young', 'Vallier.These', 'objections', 'having', 'been', 'stated', 'however', 'John', 'Greyson', 'anybody', 'matter', 'ever', 'made', 'better', 'gay', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'know']",Lilies VHS

491931,A12CDH9CPI8KUL,B000005IEV,Chad Biederman,"[33, 38]","The story goes like this: a bishop is held captive in a prisonchapel and is forced to watch a re-enactment of a romanticrelationship between two young men that took place years ago--and is forced to deal with the repercussions of it's tragic end.Quite frankly, the greatest strength in &quot;Lilies&quot; is it's clever presentation, and it's efforts to put a slightly different spin on what might otherwise be a predictable story.  Since all the parts being played in the re-enactment are portrayed by prison inmates, all the women are actually men in drag.  Add to that, the segues between the confines of the prison stage to the authentic locale of the flashbacks we're witnessing are seamless to the point of being unnoticable.  I've never seen flashbacks presented in such a way, and it's very much appreciated (thank you, John Greyson).  Also, while it would be easy to take pot-shots at organized religion in such a story, &quot;Lilies&quot; doesn't take that route.  Human weakness, not religion, is the villain in this film.  Rather than the church being the tool of the tragedy which unfolds, it winds up being a refuge.All the actors do a decent job, but Jason Cadieux is a stand-out as Simon.  He does a great job at conveying the turmoil he feels (and he's damn sexy, too!).  The one glaring weakness in the story is the character of Simon's lover's mother.  At no point does this woman make any sense to me at all.  In short, she's a loon and I don't know what real purpose she serves.However, &quot;Lilies&quot; isn't about her.  It's about the bishop and a love he took part in destroying.

491934,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000005IEV,D. Litton,"[77, 81]","&quot;Lilies&quot; is actually two stories going on at the same time. One is the story of a prison convict who asks for a priest to hear his confession, only to bewilder the priest with events from their shared past. The other story is one of love and passion, of betrayal and mistrust, of devotion and connection; the list goes on. The visual integrity is a vision beyond that of any love story I've seen to date, making this a very convincing and masterful production.The film begins with an elderly Bishop making his way to a prison to hear the confession of an inmate. Once in the prison church, it strikes him as odd that a private confession have so many witnesses in the chapel, but once he makes his way to the confession box, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary religious procedure. The convict, Simon, has a plan of revenge for the Bishop, and the chapel is transformed into a stage, the prisoners its actors.The story is that of Simon's life before prison, from his teenage years to the events that brought him to confinement. Simon is a sexually confused adolescent with whom the waifish Vallier is madly in love. Vallier is thin, pale and very emotional, and becomes severely depressed once Simon decides he must start &quot;liking girls.&quot; He goes along to the charms of a French countess, who desperately holds onto him to fulfill her fantasy of love.But a forced love never lasts, and Simon soon learns this. His willingness to satisfy his father's expectations are a burden to him, as is young Bilodeau, who regards his behavior with Vallier as sick. Simon soon gives in to his heart, realizing that he loves no other than Vallier. So how does the Bishop tie into the story? This I will not reveal. It is easy to guess what part he plays in the overall scheme of things.But this predictable story twist makes the movie's love story no less affecting. This is a story of a love that could never be torn apart, a love that knew no bounds, one that met its match and won. And on the emotional side, it's quite touching to see scenes involving the two lovers handled in a less-explicit manner than most other films.The movie makes convincing transitions from the past to the present, and even some crosses between the two. The past is brought to life by the actors of the prison, and certain scenes are staged like a play in the chapel while others are seen in Simon's mind's eye. Director John Greyson brings visual flare to the film, though some will find it difficult to make the transition. But if you're on Greyson's wavelength, then the film takes on a sumptuous and tasteful appeal.And the cast is a work of art in its own. Young Simon is played by Jason Cadieux, who shares an electric chemistry with Danny Gilmore, playing Vallier. The two are believable as lovers, and equally as moving when they are separated from one another. Older Simon, played by Aubert Pallascio, is hardened by silent rage over his lost love, while the Bishop, played by Marcel Sabourin, is convincing in his fear over the situation. And Matthew Ferguson makes Bilodeau such an annoyance that we know he will come into play later into the film.&quot;Lilies&quot; is a visually sumptuous treat that many will dismiss, but others will love. There is fire within the romance of Simon and Vallier, one that cannot be matched by many other romances in mainstream films. The present day story is a nice outlet for the memories of a man haunted by his first and only love, and the silent hatred for his enemy.",4,Tender and emotional; a surprising work of art!,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,3509,"['quot', 'Lilies', 'quot', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'One', 'story', 'prison', 'convict', 'who', 'priest', 'hear', 'confession', 'only', 'bewilder', 'priest', 'events', 'shared', 'past', 'other', 'story', 'one', 'love', 'passion', 'betrayal', 'mistrust', 'devotion', 'connection', 'list', 'visual', 'integrity', 'vision', 'love', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'making', 'very', 'convincing', 'masterful', 'production.The', 'film', 'elderly', 'Bishop', 'making', 'way', 'prison', 'hear', 'confession', 'inmate', 'Once', 'prison', 'church', 'odd', 'private', 'confession', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'witnesses', 'chapel', 'once', 'way', 'confession', 'box', 'clear', 'ordinary', 'religious', 'procedure', 'convict', 'Simon', 'plan', 'revenge', 'Bishop', 'chapel', 'transformed', 'stage', 'prisoners', 'actors.The', 'story', 'Simon', 'life', 'prison', 'teenage', 'years', 'events', 'brought', 'confinement', 'Simon', 'sexually', 'confused', 'adolescent', 'whom', 'waifish', 'Vallier', 'madly', 'love', 'Vallier', 'thin', 'pale', 'very', 'emotional', 'severely', 'depressed', 'once', 'Simon', 'must', 'start', 'quot', 'liking', 'girls.', 'quot', 'along', 'charms', 'French', 'countess', 'who', 'desperately', 'fulfill', 'fantasy', 'love.But', 'forced', 'love', 'never', 'Simon', 'soon', 'willingness', 'satisfy', 'father', 'expectations', 'are', 'burden', 'young', 'Bilodeau', 'who', 'behavior', 'Vallier', 'sick', 'Simon', 'soon', 'heart', 'realizing', 'other', 'Vallier', 'So', 'how', 'Bishop', 'tie', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'easy', 'guess', 'what', 'part', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things.But', 'predictable', 'story', 'twist', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'less', 'affecting', 'story', 'love', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'torn', 'apart', 'love', 'knew', 'bounds', 'one', 'met', 'match', 'won', 'emotional', 'side', 'quite', 'touching', 'see', 'scenes', 'involving', 'two', 'lovers', 'handled', 'less-explicit', 'manner', 'most', 'other', 'films.The', 'movie', 'convincing', 'transitions', 'past', 'present', 'even', 'crosses', 'two', 'past', 'brought', 'life', 'actors', 'prison', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'staged', 'play', 'chapel', 'others', 'are', 'seen', 'Simon', 'mind', 'eye', 'Director', 'John', 'Greyson', 'visual', 'flare', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'difficult', 'make', 'transition', ""'re"", 'Greyson', 'wavelength', 'then', 'film', 'sumptuous', 'tasteful', 'cast', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'Young', 'Simon', 'played', 'Jason', 'Cadieux', 'who', 'shares', 'electric', 'chemistry', 'Danny', 'Gilmore', 'playing', 'Vallier', 'two', 'are', 'believable', 'lovers', 'equally', 'moving', 'when', 'are', 'separated', 'one', 'Older', 'Simon', 'played', 'Aubert', 'Pallascio', 'hardened', 'silent', 'rage', 'lost', 'love', 'Bishop', 'played', 'Marcel', 'Sabourin', 'convincing', 'fear', 'situation', 'Matthew', 'Ferguson', 'Bilodeau', 'such', 'annoyance', 'know', 'will', 'come', 'play', 'later', 'film.', 'quot', 'Lilies', 'quot', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'treat', 'many', 'will', 'dismiss', 'others', 'will', 'love', 'fire', 'romance', 'Simon', 'Vallier', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'matched', 'many', 'other', 'romances', 'mainstream', 'films', 'present', 'day', 'story', 'nice', 'outlet', 'memories', 'man', 'haunted', 'first', 'only', 'love', 'silent', 'hatred', 'enemy']",Lilies VHS
491935,A3LA8WLE0RQ4MB,B000005IEV,"D. Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[4, 4]","This movie is a ""play within a film"" that juxtaposes two time periods, often combining the two. The film begins in Quebec in 1952, where a Bishop has been summoned to a prison to hear an inmate's confession. The chapel is filled with other inmates, and the Bishop goes to the Confessional. While there, the rest of the inmates, plus the Chaplain, lock the Bishop inside the confessional so that he can view the inmates acting out a re-creation of the events that intertwine the Bishop and the convict's lives.We discover that the convict, Simon, knew the Bishop as a young boy in 1912, when they were students at a boy's school. Simon was in love with a fellow student, Valier, but the future Bishop also lusted after the enticing Simon. Simon is punished by his father for loving another boy, and agrees to a sham marriage. But, ultimately, he is drawn back to his true love, Valier. This leads to the conflict, the death of Valier, and Simon being falsely imprisoned for murder of his great love, all due to the bitterness of the Bishop.This film is highly unusual in that you see the inmates performing the play in the chapel, then you see the same actors sent back in time to 1912, playing the same parts. Then, you will see the Bishop and the older Simon observing the events of 1912. There are no women in this film. Even in the flashbacks, the inmate-actors portray both male and female characters.This is not an explicit gay film, by any means. Although there is one very tender, passionate scene of the young Simon and Valier kissing intensely, while naked in a bathtub. The majority of the film is about Simon's past, and bringing the truth out to the dupilicitous Bishop. The acting and photography are excellent, and while the story may be a bit difficult to follow at first, you will need to keep in mind that we are seeing the convicts portraying this tale, even when we go back in time.It is a very romantic, very well-made, and also a very tragic film.",4,"A well-acted, romantic yet tragic film",1039478400,"12 10, 2002",2002,1968,"['movie', 'play', 'film', 'two', 'time', 'periods', 'often', 'combining', 'two', 'film', 'Quebec', '1952', 'where', 'Bishop', 'been', 'summoned', 'prison', 'hear', 'inmate', 'confession', 'chapel', 'filled', 'other', 'inmates', 'Bishop', 'Confessional', 'there', 'rest', 'inmates', 'Chaplain', 'Bishop', 'confessional', 'so', 'can', 'view', 'inmates', 'acting', 'out', 're-creation', 'events', 'intertwine', 'Bishop', 'convict', 'lives.We', 'discover', 'convict', 'Simon', 'knew', 'Bishop', 'young', 'boy', '1912', 'when', 'were', 'students', 'boy', 'school', 'Simon', 'was', 'love', 'fellow', 'student', 'Valier', 'future', 'Bishop', 'also', 'lusted', 'enticing', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'punished', 'father', 'loving', 'boy', 'sham', 'marriage', 'ultimately', 'drawn', 'back', 'true', 'love', 'Valier', 'conflict', 'death', 'Valier', 'Simon', 'being', 'falsely', 'imprisoned', 'murder', 'great', 'love', 'due', 'bitterness', 'Bishop.This', 'film', 'highly', 'unusual', 'see', 'inmates', 'performing', 'play', 'chapel', 'then', 'see', 'same', 'actors', 'sent', 'back', 'time', '1912', 'playing', 'same', 'parts', 'Then', 'will', 'see', 'Bishop', 'older', 'Simon', 'observing', 'events', '1912', 'are', 'women', 'film', 'Even', 'flashbacks', 'inmate-actors', 'male', 'female', 'characters.This', 'not', 'explicit', 'gay', 'film', 'means', 'one', 'very', 'tender', 'passionate', 'scene', 'young', 'Simon', 'Valier', 'kissing', 'intensely', 'naked', 'bathtub', 'majority', 'film', 'Simon', 'past', 'bringing', 'truth', 'dupilicitous', 'Bishop', 'acting', 'photography', 'are', 'excellent', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow', 'first', 'will', 'need', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'seeing', 'convicts', 'portraying', 'tale', 'even', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'time.It', 'very', 'romantic', 'very', 'well-made', 'also', 'very', 'tragic', 'film']",Lilies VHS

Williams ""MisterEd""","[4, 5]","When I first starting watching ""Lilies"" I began wondering what the heck I was getting myself in to as a prison bishop is held hostage in a confessional and is forced to watch what appears to be a play being staged in the chapel.  But sticking with it, this film turns out to be an amazing gem of a movie that uses a unique style to tell what is ultimately a very tragic story.The play turns out to be about the younger lives of the Bishop and the prisoner that has taken him hostage.  The film switches back and forth between the prison chapel and the same actors playing people in the real-life world of the protagonist's youth.  Being a group of prisoners, both the male and female roles are played my men - sometimes playful and sometimes tragically dramatic.Gorgeously photographed, artfully acted, cleverly staged, the film draws you in until you can't stop watching.  The love story between Simon and Vallier is very sweet and is accompanied with a couple of beautiful and romantic lovemaking scenes, and of course Jason Cadieux and Danny Gilmore in those roles are not at all hard to watch.An engaging, beautiful and luxurious film.

491940,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000005IEV,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","LILIES, based on a Canadian play 'Les feluettes' by Michel Marc Bouchard, has been adapted to the screen by Bouchard and placed in the sensitive hands of director John Greyson, an artist who is able to indulge in surrealism with reality and make it work well.  This very beautiful film is cast entirely with men despite the fact that there are women roles in the story. How does he make that work successfully without pandering to artiness? View this little film and make the discovery for your self.Set in Quebec in a prison, Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin) has been summoned form the outside to hear the confession of 'a very sick man' who has been imprisoned for 40 years for a murder. Upon the Bishop's arrival the audience knows something is amiss: despite the atmosphere of the prison as a stage accompanied by choral singing of plainsong (The Hilliard Ensemble) there are props and images that seem out of place in a grim prison.  The Bishop is ushered into the confessional booth and when he opens the window to hear confession, the person in the seat is Simon (Aubert Pallascio) the 'very sick' man who has planned for the bishop to watch a play depicting the 40 year old crime - a reverse on the confessional stance.Through a small aperture in the bishop's now locked confessional, the Bishop is forced to watch a reenactment of the incident 40 years ago when two young boys, Simon (Jason Cadieux) and Vallier (Danny Gilmore) were in love and the young future Bishop (Matthew Ferguson) was jealous of Vallier's attention from Simon and played a key role in 'murder' of Vallier that resulted in Simon's being accused and imprisoned.  The atmosphere leading up to this act includes the reaction from the small town's homophobia and to Simon's sexual ambiguity that involves a strange lady Lydie-Anne (Alexander Chapman) who arrives form Paris via an air balloon.  It is the interaction of the boys with the townsfolk, the new lady arrival who desires Simon's affections, and Vallier's understanding and self-sacrificing mother Countess De Tilly (Brent Carver) that leads to the fateful death of Simon.  How the story ends in the confessional booth reversal is the beauty of the film that must be left unsaid for the drama to affect potential audiences of this movie.The cast is all male because the whole story is a mise-en-scene, a play within a play, where all parts are acted by the prisoners for the sake of displaying truth to the Bishop.  There is no pretense at making the men look like women except for the costumes and this enhances the message of the story. The actors are excellent and the impact of the story is powerful.  Yes, this is a highly honored gay-themed film, but it is really more about the power of love both in youths and in thwarted adults that makes it a film for all audiences.  Highly Recommended.

Though in the first few minutes of the play there may be a few unanswered questions, everything becomes clear--more than clear; poetic.The acting is this film is beautiful.  With a cast of mainly unknown actors, the subject matter is handled sensitively with a delicate touch.  The central relationship of Simone and Valier is well defined and very well acted.

491950,A3SH2OT200EUO6,B000005IEV,"Paul G. Bens, Jr.","[2, 2]","One of the best films -- let alone one of the best gay films -- of the last 15 years, Lilies is, at its heart, a love story.It is 1952 and Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin) arrives at a Quebec prison to hear the last confession of Simon (the amazing Aubert Pallascio) a dying man who, forty years ago, was tried, convicted and imprisoned for the murder of another man in a small, rural town. When the Bishop takes his place in the prison confessional, he comes face to face with Simon, hardly dying and, as the Bishop comments, much older than when they had last seen one another.The stage is set for an impressive story. The remainder of the prisoners (with the implicit permission of the prison guards and the prison chaplain), lock his holiness in the confessional and what ensues is a trip back to 1912 where we learn that the Bishop and Simon knew each other all too well. Bilodeau is forced to watch as the prisoners reenact his and Simon's past and the events that led up to Simon's incarceration.In a nod to the age of Shakespeare, the prisoners assume the roles of both males and females, showing Bilodeau the truth of those days: how young Simon (Jason Cadieux) was befriended by young Bilodeau (Matthew Ferguson, with a maniacal intensity), who desperately wants Simon to join him in the seminary; how Simon has a befriended another young man named Vallier (performed with heartbreaking honesty by the spectacular Danny Gilmore), the son of an eccentric countess (Brent Carver) who has lost everything in life but her adoring son; how the triangle of three men -- two in love with the beautiful Simon -- can only lead to tragedy.Greyson as director doesn't confine us to the prison. The film moves fluidly from the cold gray stones of incarceration to the breathtaking beauty of the French Canadian countryside as a lady of means, Lydie-Anne (Alexander Chapman, wonderfully warm, yet icy), arrives by balloon and sets her sights on Simon. Torn between wanting to better his station by marrying Lydie-Anne and his fearful, honest love of Vallier, Simon finds himself in the middle of a powder keg as Lydie-Anne and young Bilodeau set in motion the events that will tear apart his life.Cadieux, as the young Simon, is definitely the bee-stung lips eye-candy of the piece, and the movie would have been made better with a stronger actor. Still, he is quite effective and, for those who keep score of these things, you get some rear nudity. The standout is Danny Gilmore as Vallier who should be a massive star. The most moving moment for me is when Vallier, alone in his room, professes his love for Simon in a poem, and is discovered by his mother who mistakes the ode as being dedicated to a long lost father. Gilmore is also very easy on the eyes and you do get to see all of him (literally and figuratively). The script does get a tiny bit muddled in the end, but the photography, the performances, and the directing are spectacular from beginning to end.

491951,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B000005IEV,P. Walker,"[3, 4]","Lilies is a play, made into film, centering around inmates acting out a play in a prison. Seemingly complex, the simple premise of the play is of actual events concerning a couple of the characters forced to confront sins of the past. Overlaying surrealistic imagery into the play allows the viewers to experience the events but anchors them in the actual setting, the prison. As with most plays, it is vitally important to pay attention to the dialog. However in this film, the imagery competes creating a perfect symbiotic relationship so that we can see clearly the internal struggles of each ""player"". This is exemplified in the initial scene which identifies the institutions of prison and church as being the same. Both locking ""threats"" in and/or out while at the same time forcing conformity to a set of preconceived social structures and forcing repentance on those held in these boxed environments. Dealing with ghosts of the past, created by intense hurt and obsessions, the characters are forced to reckon with reality, no matter the price to pay. It is obvious we are dealing with forbidden love and obsession, but it is the struggle itself that is the focal element. Beautifully well crafted, the film exposes, then challenges, the delusions we internalize in order to conform and be accepted by family, society, and ourselves.The imagery of Lydie-Anne dropping from the heavens as one sent from God (Eve created for Adam) to counterbalance Simon's real and enduring love for Vallier is perfect. As well as the pious conflicted Bilodeau crying out to an indifferent God at the balloon alter, which represents, at least in his mind, God's will manifest. And like many frustrated hypocritically religious people do, decides to become the judge, jury, and executioner of those who exemplify the conflict he has within himself. Replete with symbolism, the film is a pleasure to watch and should be viewed again to see what may have been missed the first time.

Everything about this film works: the script, the directing, the cast, the look. This film gives new meaning to the gay feature film genre.Based on a play, Lilies retains a stage feeling as the premise is a play-within-a-play. Whereas the audience is not required to use it's imagination as much while watching the film as it was when watching the play, the film does require an open mind and the ability to suspend disbelief. If you allow it, Lilies will take you on a very special ride as seldom films do or can.The chemistry between Jason Cadieux (a much under-used young actor) and Danny Gilmore (mainly known from French-Canadian television) is remarkable, making their tragic love-story all the more moving.
