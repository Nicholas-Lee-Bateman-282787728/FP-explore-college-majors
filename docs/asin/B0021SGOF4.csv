For me, this was an introduction to Seraphine de Senlis' artwork, and I felt myself captivated by each piece and by the progression of her talent.

Clendenin,"[2, 2]","In this dramatization of a true story, during the summer of 1914 the famous German art critic and collector Wilhelm Uhde rents a home in the French countryside. Three times a week a frumpy and eccentric housekeeper named S&eacute;raphine attends to his cooking and cleaning. In a twist of fate, Uhde learns that the peasant woman not only paints at night, but that she's a savant following her religious visions, voices and votive candles. Germany's invasion of France separates the two for 10 years. Then fate strikes again, when Uhde's sister reads an article in a paper about an exhibition of local artists in S&eacute;raphine's home village of Senlis. He assumes that she's dead, but the patron and peasant reconnect, and plan a Paris exhibition. But S&eacute;raphine's eccentricities turn into insanity; she is forcibly removed to an asylum until her death in 1942, cared for by the ongoing generosity of Uhde. Today her paintings are in museums around the world. The film is long, simple and slow-moving at 131 minutes, but in 2008 it won seven C&eacute;sar awards, including best actress and best picture.

1248864,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0021SGOF4,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","S&eacute;raphine de Senlis - born S&eacute;raphine Louis (1864- 1942) - may not be a painter well known to the entire art world today, but the story of her life makes a compelling film.  Writer Marc Abdelnour and writer/director Martin Provost have extracted all of the significant aspects of S&eacute;raphine Louis' life and have created a work of art as a film, much in the style of the way she created her life in art.S&eacute;raphine Louis (Yolande Moreau) was born in 1864 in Arcy to a poor family and worked as a shepherdess until 1881 when she accepted the position as a domestic worker for the Sisters of Providence in Clermont: her life with the nuns enhanced her profoundly religious approach to her personal philosophy. In 1901 she left the convent, in part due to a communication with her angel that she must paint, to become a housekeeper for middle class families in Senlis.  In her quiet manner she scrubbed floors and did laundry by day, using the pittances of income to procure some supplies so that she could paint her images of fruits, flowers, and leaves by candlelight at night in her tiny room.  Self taught, she used pigment from strange sources - blood from the butcher, melted wax from the votives at the cathedral, pollen from the flowers of the fields, her only 'purchased' component was gesso and white paint from the artist supply shop in Senlis.In 1914 the German art collector and critic Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) took a room in the house owned by Mme Duphot (Genevi&egrave;ve Mnich), one of the houses where S&eacute;raphine worked, and when Wilhelm discovered a painting by S&eacute;raphine he immediately recognized a painter of great promise and provided S&eacute;raphine with the first response to her artistic efforts.  Wilhelm and S&eacute;raphine became friends and Wilhelm bought all of her art, insisting that she devote her time to creating art instead of scrubbing floors. With the backing of a collector and friend, S&eacute;raphine began painting in earnest, showing locally and selling art under Wilhelm's sponsorship, until 1914 when with WW I breaking out, Wilhelm had to flee France, leaving behind his collection of paintings as well as the close bond the two had formed. Mistakenly S&eacute;raphine thought Wilhelm's departure was to marry his roommate Anne-Marie (Anne Bennett), only to discover that Anne-Marie was Wilhelm's sister and fellow supporter of S&eacute;raphine: Wilhelm informed her he would never be able to marry a woman.S&eacute;raphine continued painting as she lead her eccentric life in Senlis and in 1927 Wilhelm returned to France with his paramour - young painter Helmut Kolle (Nico Rogner) who suffered from tuberculosis - rediscovers S&eacute;raphine's art in a local Senlis exhibition,  and  realizes that she had survived and her art had flourished. Under Wilhelm's patronage, S&eacute;raphine began painting large canvases as large as two meters high, and she achieved prominence as the nave painter of her day. In 1929, Wilhelm organized an exhibition, 'Painters of the Sacred Heart', that featured S&eacute;raphine's art, launching her into a period of financial success she had never known - and was ill prepared to manage. Then, in 1930, with the effects of the Great Depression destroying the finances of her patrons, Wilhelm had no choice except to stop buying her paintings.  S&eacute;raphine's spending habits cause concern and in 1932 her psychotic behavior resulted in placement in the psychiatric ward in Clermont hospital where she spent the rest of her days, alone and without friends or admirers of her gift of art.The simplicity of the manner in which this story is related with very little dialogue, atmospheric scenery as captured by cinematographer Laurent Brunet, and a musical score by Michael Galasso that combines sacred chants with idiomatic instrumental music of French ancestry.  Yolande Moreau glows with a special radiance as the simple, spiritual,  artistically driven S&eacute;raphine and Ulrich Tukar is the perfect balance as his own driven, unique 'first true collector'.  This film is a little masterpiece and one that deserves the attention of everyone who cares about the lives of artists and the emergence of genius from strange vessels.

When I saw it yesterday, there was only a handfull of folks out.  Quelle dommage!This film is incredibly touching, the true story of an actual French housekeeper who, in her late 40's, while cleaning in a convent, heard her Guardian Angel tell her to paint.  As a simple, devout peasant, she did what she was told, and began painting on small panels, all that she could afford.  She skimped on food and coal in order to pay for white paint and varnish.  She made the colors from blood, stolen from the butcher, flowers and plants and wax taken from votive candles in the church.  She had no training and only painted what she loved, the flowers and trees in her beloved countryside.Into her life, as if by the hand of the Angels, came a German art dealer who lived in nearby Paris.  He was probably one of the few people on the planet at that time who would appreciate Seraphine's work.  He had collected some Picassos and Braques and was interested in the paintings of Henri Rousseau and other primitives.  He was amazed when he saw the small, simple painting of Seraphine's which had been left in the home of the woman for whom she cleaned house.Thus begins the fascinating story of how these two lives intertwine.  I won't spoil it for you by telling what happens.  The film is beautifully told, containing much humour as well as pathos.

1248873,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0021SGOF4,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[16, 16]","Absorbing and beautifully made film with a compelling performance by Yolande Moreau as early 20th-century French painter Seraphine Louis. In addition to the many comments already made here by other appreciative viewers, I would add that the length of the film (2 hours) affords ample opportunity to represent the role of a single, working class woman in France during the period, 1910s-1920s. As a housekeeper and laundrywoman, paid little for her services and regarded typically with disdain by the more moneyed people for whom she works, Seraphine could easily have stepped from the pages of a Victor Hugo novel. The pastoral scenes, the great houses, the cobbled streets, and the costuming represent a world and a social order lingering on from the previous century.The film makes clear the lot of one born poor and female into such a world. The work required to keep soul and body together is endless, grueling, and mind-numbing. Anyone else would drop from exhaustion at the end of such a day, yet with renewed energy drawn from her angelic forces and a deep love of the woods and fields, Seraphine is somehow able to paint by candlelight at night. While some viewers familiar with her story may find the film slow, what it wants us to care about is the hopelessness of a woman in her social position. Without the kindness of a handful of others and the chance discovery of her artistic gifts by a visiting German art critic and collector, Wilhelm Uhde, she would have disappeared into oblivion and all her breathtakingly inspired paintings with her.The film also emphasizes her isolation. It underscores this theme with the parallel story of Uhde, who for unexplained reasons has retreated to this rural French town from his life in Germany. There are allusions to his homosexuality (the ""blemish"" of the film mentioned by another reviewer), but the film suggests that there is a connection here to his taking refuge far from what would be the center of his professional life in Berlin. A story Seraphine reveals of a long-lost love shows the two as similar in their sorrows and losses, each of them alone in the world. This is a lovely, meditative film. Without the narrative force of a Hollywood-style biopic to drive it forward and hold interest, you have to meet it half-way, but accepted on its own terms, it does not disappoint.",5,Deserves every award it has won . . .,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2340,"['Absorbing', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Yolande', 'Moreau', 'early', '20th-century', 'French', 'painter', 'Seraphine', 'Louis', 'addition', 'many', 'comments', 'already', 'made', 'here', 'other', 'appreciative', 'viewers', 'would', 'add', 'length', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'affords', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'represent', 'role', 'single', 'working', 'class', 'woman', 'France', 'period', '1910s-1920s', 'housekeeper', 'laundrywoman', 'paid', 'little', 'services', 'regarded', 'typically', 'disdain', 'more', 'moneyed', 'people', 'whom', 'Seraphine', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'stepped', 'pages', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'pastoral', 'scenes', 'great', 'houses', 'cobbled', 'streets', 'costuming', 'represent', 'world', 'social', 'order', 'lingering', 'previous', 'century.The', 'film', 'clear', 'lot', 'one', 'born', 'poor', 'female', 'world', 'work', 'required', 'keep', 'soul', 'body', 'together', 'endless', 'grueling', 'mind-numbing', 'Anyone', 'else', 'would', 'drop', 'exhaustion', 'end', 'such', 'day', 'yet', 'renewed', 'energy', 'drawn', 'angelic', 'forces', 'deep', 'love', 'woods', 'fields', 'Seraphine', 'somehow', 'able', 'paint', 'candlelight', 'night', 'viewers', 'familiar', 'story', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'slow', 'what', 'care', 'about', 'hopelessness', 'woman', 'social', 'position', 'kindness', 'handful', 'others', 'chance', 'discovery', 'artistic', 'gifts', 'visiting', 'German', 'art', 'critic', 'collector', 'Wilhelm', 'Uhde', 'would', 'have', 'disappeared', 'oblivion', 'breathtakingly', 'inspired', 'paintings', 'her.The', 'film', 'also', 'isolation', 'theme', 'parallel', 'story', 'Uhde', 'who', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'retreated', 'rural', 'French', 'town', 'life', 'Germany', 'are', 'allusions', 'homosexuality', 'blemish', 'film', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'film', 'connection', 'here', 'taking', 'refuge', 'far', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'center', 'professional', 'life', 'Berlin', 'A', 'story', 'Seraphine', 'reveals', 'long-lost', 'love', 'two', 'similar', 'sorrows', 'losses', 'alone', 'world', 'lovely', 'meditative', 'film', 'narrative', 'force', 'Hollywood-style', 'biopic', 'drive', 'forward', 'hold', 'interest', 'have', 'meet', 'half-way', 'accepted', 'own', 'terms', 'not', 'disappoint']",Seraphine

1248877,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B0021SGOF4,"technoguy ""jack""","[9, 9]","Seraphine is a magnificent film of what was to me an unknown French artist,Seraphine Louis,an impoverished cleaner,who was an extraordinary nave painter.Self-taught,inspired by her religious faith,she had an inner compulsion to express divinely inspired visions through painting,reflections of a psyche walking a tightrope between ecstasy and mental illness.Alongside her arduous day jobs,Seraphine(Yolande Moreau) painted by candlelight,largely in secret isolation,until her considerable body of work was discovered by William Uhde(Ulrich Tukur),German art collector,who was mesmerized.For most of her life, S&eacute;raphine painted in total obscurity, scrimping together enough money from the various types of menial labor on which she subsisted to buy a few art supplies. She mixed these with pigments of her own devising, colors distilled from plant and animal sources familiar to S&eacute;raphine from years of tending flocks and other outdoor work. These vibrant colors, which struck Uhde's eye as so unusual, are one of the hallmarks of her work. The subject of almost all of her paintings is the flora of the region where she lived, generally viewed from close up and refracted through the bizarre lens of S&eacute;raphine's inner vision. She claimed that heavenly voices directed her to paint, visions that later became delusions strong enough to land her in a mental asylum in Clermont, where she died after a long incarceration. These plants, often dotted and striped like caterpillars or other insects, seem to quiver with life, making them seem more like the fauna of a psychotic landscape.His support had barely begun to lift her horizons when he was forced to leave France in August 1914; the war between France and Germany had made him an unwelcome outsider in Senlis, much as S&eacute;raphine was, given her eccentric persona. They only reestablished contact in 1927 when Uhde - back in France and living in Chantilly - visited an exhibition of local artists in Senlis and, seeing S&eacute;raphine's work, realized that she had survived and her art had flourished. Under Uhde's patronage, S&eacute;raphine began painting large canvases as large as two meters high, and she achieved prominence as the nave painter of her day. In 1929, Uhde organized an exhibition,""Painters of the Sacred Heart,"" that featured S&eacute;raphine's art, launching her into a period of financial success she had never known - and was ill prepared to manage. Then, in 1930, with the effects of the Great Depression destroying the finances of her patrons, Uhde had no choice except to stop buying her paintings.In 1932, S&eacute;raphine was admitted for ""chronic psychosis"" to the psychiatric ward of a geriatric hospital at Clermont, where her artistry found no outlet. Although Uhde reported that she had died in 1934, S&eacute;raphine actually lived until 1942 in a hospital annex at Villers-sous-Erquery, where she died friendless and alone[. (Some sources still state she died in 1934.) She was buried in a common grave.Yolande Moreau's performance touches the heart, witness the scene in the special asylum when she touches the chair on the balcony of her room.Ulrich Tukur(Lives of Others) is superb as Uhde. If I have one criticism it's that I thought many of the interior scenes were too darkly lit,although this enhances realism,I couldn't see the paintings with enough clarity.A winner of 7 French Academy awards,with best actress and best picture.",5,"The heart in hiding stirred..the acheive of,the mastery of the thing!",1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,3452,"['Seraphine', 'magnificent', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'unknown', 'French', 'artist', 'Seraphine', 'Louis', 'impoverished', 'cleaner', 'who', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'nave', 'painter.Self-taught', 'inspired', 'religious', 'faith', 'had', 'inner', 'compulsion', 'express', 'divinely', 'inspired', 'visions', 'painting', 'reflections', 'psyche', 'walking', 'tightrope', 'ecstasy', 'mental', 'illness.Alongside', 'arduous', 'day', 'jobs', 'Seraphine', 'Yolande', 'Moreau', 'painted', 'candlelight', 'largely', 'secret', 'isolation', 'considerable', 'body', 'work', 'was', 'discovered', 'William', 'Uhde', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'German', 'art', 'collector', 'who', 'was', 'mesmerized.For', 'most', 'life', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'painted', 'total', 'obscurity', 'scrimping', 'together', 'enough', 'money', 'various', 'types', 'menial', 'labor', 'subsisted', 'buy', 'few', 'art', 'supplies', 'mixed', 'pigments', 'own', 'devising', 'colors', 'distilled', 'plant', 'animal', 'sources', 'familiar', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'years', 'tending', 'flocks', 'other', 'outdoor', 'work', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'struck', 'Uhde', 'eye', 'so', 'unusual', 'are', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'work', 'subject', 'almost', 'paintings', 'flora', 'region', 'where', 'lived', 'generally', 'viewed', 'close', 'up', 'refracted', 'bizarre', 'lens', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'inner', 'vision', 'claimed', 'heavenly', 'voices', 'directed', 'paint', 'visions', 'later', 'became', 'delusions', 'strong', 'enough', 'land', 'mental', 'asylum', 'Clermont', 'where', 'died', 'long', 'incarceration', 'plants', 'often', 'dotted', 'striped', 'caterpillars', 'other', 'insects', 'seem', 'quiver', 'life', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'fauna', 'psychotic', 'landscape.His', 'support', 'had', 'barely', 'begun', 'lift', 'horizons', 'when', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'France', 'August', '1914', 'war', 'France', 'Germany', 'had', 'made', 'unwelcome', 'outsider', 'Senlis', 'much', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'was', 'given', 'eccentric', 'persona', 'only', 'reestablished', 'contact', '1927', 'when', 'Uhde', 'back', 'France', 'living', 'Chantilly', 'visited', 'exhibition', 'local', 'artists', 'Senlis', 'seeing', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'work', 'realized', 'had', 'survived', 'art', 'had', 'flourished', 'Uhde', 'patronage', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'began', 'painting', 'large', 'canvases', 'as', 'large', 'two', 'meters', 'high', 'achieved', 'prominence', 'nave', 'painter', 'day', '1929', 'Uhde', 'organized', 'exhibition', 'Painters', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'featured', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'art', 'launching', 'period', 'financial', 'success', 'had', 'never', 'known', 'was', 'ill', 'prepared', 'manage', 'Then', '1930', 'effects', 'Great', 'Depression', 'destroying', 'finances', 'patrons', 'Uhde', 'had', 'choice', 'stop', 'buying', 'paintings.In', '1932', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'was', 'admitted', 'chronic', 'psychosis', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'geriatric', 'hospital', 'Clermont', 'where', 'artistry', 'found', 'outlet', 'Uhde', 'reported', 'had', 'died', '1934', 'S', 'eacute', 'raphine', 'actually', 'lived', '1942', 'hospital', 'annex', 'Villers-sous-Erquery', 'where', 'died', 'friendless', 'alone', '[', 'sources', 'still', 'state', 'died', '1934', 'was', 'buried', 'common', 'grave.Yolande', 'Moreau', 'performance', 'heart', 'witness', 'scene', 'special', 'asylum', 'when', 'chair', 'balcony', 'room.Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'Lives', 'Others', 'superb', 'Uhde', 'have', 'one', 'criticism', 'thought', 'many', 'interior', 'scenes', 'were', 'too', 'darkly', 'lit', 'realism', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'paintings', 'enough', 'clarity.A', 'winner', '7', 'French', 'Academy', 'awards', 'best', 'actress', 'best', 'picture']",Seraphine
1248878,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B0021SGOF4,The Guardian,"[1, 1]","POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE TRUE STORYThis is an unusual, slow-paced and absorbing biopic about Seraphine Louis, a poorly-educated and deeply religious single woman living in the town of Senlis in eastern France in the first decades of the 20th century. Despite great adversity, Seraphine eventually became a highly regarded `nave' artist of some renown whose work had a distinctive style and is now featured in any comprehensive history of 20th century art.Written and directed by Martin Provost (Cocoon, Le Ventre de Juliette) `Seraphine' won a number of French Film Academy awards. Yolande Moreau plays the somewhat eccentric but deeply sympathetic Seraphine to perfection, creating a complex and secretive character whose private life and motivations are slowly uncovered as the film progresses. The hard, unglamorous life of a poorly educated single woman in the early 20th century is portrayed very well, where every sous she earns from laborious hours as a domestic cleaner is needed for food and to buy the materials from which she manufactures her own paints - also using the wax from votive candles taken from the church, animal blood from the butcher and pigments pressed from wild flowers she gathers. Driven by an inner passion and religious fervour, she paints at night in the privacy of her rented room, by candlelight, and shows her paintings to no-one. Even the viewer is not shown the paintings until well into the film.The story of the discovery of Seraphine's extraordinary paintings by German art critic Wilhelm Uhde is brilliantly told. Being German, he has to flee France in the summer of 1914 but returns 10 years later. Eventually, by accident, he finds Seraphine again, begins to champion her work and bring it to international attention.Life did not end happily for the eccentric and child-like Seraphine. Psychiatric instability - possibly a causative factor in her extraordinary artistic visions and the driving energy behind her painting - eventually led to her detention and incarceration. Uhde continued to care for her welfare and ensured she had the maximum comfort possible with a private room and access to the garden, but she never left institutional care and died in 1942.This is a touching true story, and a very good (if not exactly `feel-good') film. The dialogue is not too wordy, so for non-French speakers reading the subs is no problem. The cinematography is beautiful and overall it's a quality piece of work with serious and unusual subject matter. For me, it drops a star only because of the rather downbeat ending to what was ultimately a rather tragic story.

1248879,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0021SGOF4,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0S&eacute;raphine is a French-Belgian production about the housekeeper turned artist of the same name, who first gained fame between the last two World Wars. Creating films about famous artists are difficult since they're inherently not very dramatic. Highlighting the beauty of the artist's creation is one thing but designing a full-fledged drama concerning the artist and his/her interactions with the people they knew, could be problematic.While I would not call the story of S&eacute;raphine a gripping tale where you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, it does manage to hold your interest, despite its languid pace. It's in fact, a very well- crafted biopic, that features some sensational cinematography.The story is rather simple. S&eacute;raphine is a devoted Catholic, middle-aged housekeeper who also happens to be a talented painter. She collects some of the ingredients for her paint from unusual sources including wax from candles in her local church, soil from plants and blood from a dead pig. One of the lodgers in a house she services is Uhde, an up and coming art critic and collector from Germany, who recognizes S&eacute;raphine's potential, despite disparaging remarks made about her artwork by the local gentry. Uhde even buys a few of S&eacute;raphine's paintings but eventually loses all his art possessions when World War I begins and he's forced to flee France, back to Germany.When Uhde returns to France between the wars in 1927, he looks S&eacute;raphine up again and notes her skills have improved a hundred fold. Now she's creating large works of art on giant canvasses. For a time, Uhde is able to have S&eacute;raphine's artwork shown in well-known galleries and pays her money where she's able to rent her own apartment. The onset of the Depression causes the art market to collapse and Uhde is no longer able to provide S&eacute;raphine with financial support. This perhaps precipitates the onset of her mental illness and eventually S&eacute;raphine has to be hospitalized. Her treatment at the hospital is not good and she falls deeper into psychosis. Uhde finally is able to sell some of S&eacute;raphine's paintings by around 1935 and uses the proceeds to make her more comfortable at the hospital.As noted above, 'S&eacute;raphine' is a slow-moving affair. Nonetheless, the method by which she creates her paintings, her religious zeal and her unusual relationship with Uhde, is enough for us to remain interested throughout.
