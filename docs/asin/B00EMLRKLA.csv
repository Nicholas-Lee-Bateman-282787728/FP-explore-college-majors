1667835,A5N992ESD6UHW,B00EMLRKLA,"Jonny Lee ""Boothill Gunslinger""","[4, 13]","Getting a little tired of these guys, and I am also very weary of hearing about how rich they are. I could really give a rat's you-know-what! I will give the show two stars, however, for the entertainment factor only.Firstly, I believe their so-called worth is over-inflated, over-exaggerated, and not anywhere near the truth. At an average of $40 a pop for a duck call, especially when there is no need for a hunter to continue replacing them on a regular basis, the numbers simply don't add up to millions upon millions upon millions. If a million hunters all bought Duck Commander brand duck calls, that would equal $40 million. However, three things come into play here. Not ALL hunters hunt duck. As a matter of fact, most hunt deer. Duck calls rarely need to be replaced, so there are very few repeat buyers, AND there are other brands out there. Duck Commander is not a monopoly. There are also product costs, marketing costs, overhead costs, payroll costs, insurance costs, tax, etc., etc., etc. Sorry, folks, those are the numbers. These guys aren't as rich as they'll have you believe.Secondly, and even more glaring, is that not ONE of them has a lick of business sense. They make serious professional mistakes and blunders in every episode--one after another, after another, after another, after another, after another ...There is no possible way to make that kind of money when you do not receive dedication and respect from your employed staff. I never see the workers buckling down and getting to business. They're always pushing against the grain, causing upheaval, and defiling themselves and their employer. The neighbors and town-folk even have to come in to help, sometimes, because, instead of dutifully performing their required tasks, the idiots in the work area are out making a redneck theme park or drinking beer, while on the clock, and soaking in a pick-up bed swimming pool, or driving a sleeping, bearded crazy-man in a trailer out into the middle of the woods. (That was a lie, by the way. Unless he was drugged, there is no way he could have remained asleep with all that jostling around. Trailers are VERY bouncy).When you are making millions, there is no time or place for those types of shenanigans. These sorts of behaviors in business do not make millionaires, friends. I would have fired each and every one of them a long, long time ago, especially the boss-Robertson, who lacks any and all authority. He is a pushover in the midst of ill-placed dissension.I have an MS in business administration and management. I know from experience that this whole show is a big joke, and there isn't a lick of truth behind their income claims.One last note: If they were so darn rich, they wouldn't have to rely on public/fan-misleading, cash-grabs like this release. The whole thing can be seen on the Season Two release. It's all smoke & mirrors.Lastly, to candy-coat the misbehavior by having some quiet prayer around a dinner table for ten or fifteen seconds at the end of each sin-loaded episode is hypocritical. As the bible says, people, ""It is better to be hot or cold, than to be lukewarm."" Flaunting wealth goes against all Christian values.Two stars for the entertainment factor only.
