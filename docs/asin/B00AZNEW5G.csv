We all know the basics of this plot, so how these events are presented and tied together becomes vitally important to maintaining viewer interest.  This film simply presents a series of disjointed events.  I was left asking, &#34;So what?&#34;  There was no development of the story that leads to the conclusion.  There is also very minimal character development.  Was the real Maya this shallow?  I can't believe that Jessica Chastain was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I never experienced a suspension of disbelief in this portrayal, whether Maya is stridently admonishing a tortured terrorist suspect to &#34;be truthful&#34; or stridently admonishing her boss about how many days he is taking to evaluate a situation or tearfully (glycerin tears) recognizing that this phase of her life has ended and the future is unclear.

The Americans in the film were mostly lifeless, without personality, and always found a way to use curse words un-necassarily.The depictions of Muslims in the movie had some inaccuracies.  For example, many of the Pakistani's or Taliban characters seemed like long haired pretty boy actors they were trying to convert into some hard-core &#34;terrorists&#34;.  They ended up looking more like a band of thugs involved in the drug trade than religious zealots.  Nearly everyone of them smoked cigarettes for example, whereas a Muslim extremist would be very unlikely to smoke cigarettes, especially from regions such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.Still, at the end of the day it was somewhat informative.  It showed what may have went on in the background of the search for Bin Laden, and some of what may go on within the CIA.  The scenes that were taken abroad looked very real and are engaging to the viewer.Without getting to political on everyone, I will say it could have been worse.",2,"Bad characters all around, but somewhat interesting and informative.",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,1045,"['characters', 'one', 'were', 'bad', 'board', 'Americans', 'film', 'were', 'mostly', 'lifeless', 'personality', 'always', 'found', 'way', 'use', 'curse', 'words', 'un-necassarily.The', 'depictions', 'Muslims', 'movie', 'had', 'inaccuracies', 'example', 'many', 'Pakistani', 'Taliban', 'characters', 'seemed', 'long', 'haired', 'pretty', 'boy', 'actors', 'were', 'trying', 'convert', 'hard-core', '34', 'terrorists', '34', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'band', 'thugs', 'involved', 'drug', 'trade', 'religious', 'zealots', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'smoked', 'cigarettes', 'example', 'Muslim', 'extremist', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'unlikely', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'especially', 'regions', 'such', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan.Still', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'somewhat', 'informative', 'showed', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'went', 'background', 'search', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'what', 'may', 'go', 'CIA', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'abroad', 'looked', 'very', 'real', 'are', 'engaging', 'viewer.Without', 'getting', 'political', 'everyone', 'will', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse']",N/A

1619894,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B00AZNEW5G,Ace Reader,"[2, 5]","This film has captured 5 Academy Award Nominations. I knew as soon as I heard that Kathryn Bigelow had directed a new film concerning the discovery and elimination of Osama bin Laden, I was an instant fan. You may recall she's the brilliant Academy Award winning Director of ""The Hurt Locker"". Again she and writer Mark Boal have created a masterpiece. This film is better (in my opinion) then ""The Hurt Locker"". It is because of it's subject matter and the total execution in making this entire film. I found nothing in it to complain about. It's a beautiful thing to watch in every way. This film is entertaining and fast-paced. Depicting nitty-gritty realism about the intensive search (manhunt) and discovery of one of recent history's most dangerous men, Osama bin Laden.The search for this dangerous man was on-going for over a decade. Osama bin Laden was living on borrowed time and now he is gone. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does a remarkable job depicting what our American information gathering spies and agents were forced to do and go through to gather information from terrorists to find bin Laden. Violently intense, realistic scenes of torture accompany excellent acting and portrayal's of said people and actions that are painful to witness even though you know it's only actors pretending, acting out a scene. I had to keep reminding myself it's not real. The make-up used was effective and realistic looking in every way.The entire cast of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has done an excellent job with all of their performance's due to their talents and it's Director Kathyrn Bigelow. Actress Jessica Chastain's performance as CIA agent Maya, has already won her a Best Actress Golden Globe Award for her part in this film. Her character Maya, who's backbone is made of steel, made strong by all her long years of hard work searching for bin Laden. Including, adding assistance during interrogation of suspected terrorist, then made stronger again when a colleague is killed. This devastating loss magnifies her desire to step-up the search for her quarry. Her character passionately believes she is the one person to find and bring down bin Laden. Religion and faith in a higher power appear in many scenes in this powerful film. Maya is shown alone, as a solitary figure throughout this film. A fact-finding sentinel that is forced many times to verbally do battle with her own superiors to complete her task which adds tension and suspense to this compelling screenplay.The extremely quiet stealth utility helicopters, the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, that are believed (no officially operating helicopters fitting this description), to have been used for the transfer of Navy Seals Team Six to bin Laden's compound to eliminate him really did sustain mechanical trouble in one of them during the operation. The team was forced to destroy it (this was not included in this film) before departing in two MH-47 Chinooks with bin Laden's remains.The hair-raising chills I experienced throughout this film were on the high side. Most of them occurring during the last quarter of this film when the Special Forces Team deploys to take out bin Laden. I believe this film affected me in this manner because I know this stories history is real and that it did affect me and every American in this country. It shows to us and the world that our country's President and military leaders will not tolerate anyone to hurt us. And if they do, retaliation definitely and swiftly will come to those who do hurt us, as soon as they (the enemy) are located. Justice will be served.Parts of this film were shot in PEC University of Technology in Chandigarh, India. Some parts were designed to look like Lahore and Abbottabad Pakistan where bin Laden was found. Locals discovered this and protested. They were insulted that their country was being made to appear as Pakistan.This films beautiful and sometimes energizing score is composed by Alexandre Desplat and is preformed by the London Symphony Orchestra. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has been nominated for five Academy Awards. They are: Best Picture, Best Actress-Jessica Chastain, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing. Update: Academy Award winner for Best Sound Editing.I highly recommend this film, but it's not for the faint of heart.It is a tough film about a tough subject.

""where exactly is abu akman living at the moment"".. then he is waterboarded again. after detainee downplays identity of courier and gives up no information, she confides in colleague that the detainee is withholding that he knows abu akman, even though ""we're throwing all we have at him"". again waterboarding is portrayed as the key to determining the truth, this time through negative inference. he's trying too hard to act like abu akman is a nobody... even with all the goodies being thrown at him.colleague warns her that she needs to watch her back, ""politics are changing"" and she doesnt' want to be ""left holding the bag"". implication, obama is going to be president, torture will now be uncool. think of the scene where robert duval's character in apocalypse now sadly says, ""some day this will all be over"", without the irony.politician says ""if you can't prove it's bin laden, at least prove it's not someone else, like a drug dealer"", asst. director ""You know we lost the ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program.. who am i supposed to ask?

1619899,A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B00AZNEW5G,"AF ""Whigs""","[0, 1]","This movie covers a lot of territory.  It tries to put the US presence in the Middle East in a small amount of context.  Much of the dialog and information rattled off by characters in the movie can be hard to follow - unless you're well-versed in Middle East history and contemporary politics (which I'm sort of, sort of not).So there's some complexity here.  It's not an action movie.  It's not an easy movie.  Torture exists in this world.  Is it ever morally justified?  Well, that's a big question you'll have to deal with as you watch.

Instead Maya stops torturing only under threat of prosecution. How heroic. How courageous. How selfless. Not.Real patriots don't torture. Torture is not only immoral but is prosecutable under both U.S. and international law for many of the same reasons that slavery and genocide are.

Besides, if we didn't prosecute and condemn torturers, where would they stop? They always rationalize torture on grounds of public security, but historically have always used it as a weapon to terrorize the public and suppress political dissent.Oblivious to all these dangers and to the truth, Bigelow glorifies a fictional torturer with a broken moral compass and ignores all the very real patriotic U.S. officials who refused to torture and who were the real heroes responsible for finding bin Laden.",1,real patriots don't torture,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1322,"['3/4/13', 'one', 'star', 'racist', 'overtones', 'refusal', 'condemn', 'torture', 'unequivocally', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'something', 'offend', 'everyone', 'Senator', 'McCain', 'right', 'when', 'ZD30', 'kinds', 'ammunition', 'forces', 'radical', 'Islam.Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'fictional', 'heroine', 'Maya', 'selfless', 'patriot', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'torture', 'time', 'Instead', 'Maya', 'torturing', 'only', 'threat', 'prosecution', 'How', 'heroic', 'How', 'courageous', 'How', 'selfless', 'Not.Real', 'patriots', 'do', ""n't"", 'torture', 'Torture', 'not', 'only', 'immoral', 'prosecutable', 'U.S.', 'international', 'law', 'many', 'same', 'reasons', 'slavery', 'genocide', 'are', 'also', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'U.S.', 'interests', 'radicalizing', 'victims', 'undermining', 'claim', 'might', 'make', 'moral', 'leadership', 'did', ""n't"", 'prosecute', 'condemn', 'torturers', 'where', 'would', 'stop', 'always', 'rationalize', 'torture', 'grounds', 'public', 'security', 'historically', 'have', 'always', 'used', 'weapon', 'terrorize', 'public', 'suppress', 'political', 'dissent.Oblivious', 'dangers', 'truth', 'Bigelow', 'fictional', 'torturer', 'broken', 'moral', 'compass', 'very', 'real', 'patriotic', 'U.S.', 'officials', 'who', 'refused', 'torture', 'who', 'were', 'real', 'heroes', 'responsible', 'finding', 'bin', 'Laden']",N/A

1619921,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00AZNEW5G,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Few films made the impact that `Zero Dark Thirty' did last year.  Not only was it critically lauded (and almost swept early critics' awards, gaining early momentum for Oscar) but the controversy surrounding the treatment of certain themes and aspects of the film (mainly the torture in interrogation) made it a popular water cooler topic, and while the film would up scoring low with Oscar (a mere 5 nominations and only 1 win) it certainly deserved the attention it garnered and stands up as one of the best films of last year.Bigelow, who reignited her career with 2009's `The Hurt Locker' (winning a slew of Oscars, including one for Bigelow as director) tackles `the greatest manhunt in history' with the same nerve-racking intensity she brought to her previous effort, this time with even greater effect.  Each frame moves at a pace that allows the audience to engage directly with the atmosphere of the scene and as the scenes bleed into one another we are brought on Maya's journey into a world that constantly fights at her every push.`Zero Dark Thirty' covers the nearly ten year persistence on the part of Maya, a CIA operative who made it her life to track down and kill Osama Bin Laden.  Starting shortly after the tragic events of 9/11, Maya is sent to spearhead the investigation in Al Qaeda, and she does so with a ferocity that ultimately helps her reach her goal.  She is accompanied on this journey by others who aid her mission, but in the end it is her constant push that gets her where she needs to be.This is Bigelow's movie.  She directs it with the perfect blend of restraint and intensity.  Personally, the weakest link to this film is the performance from Jessica Chastain, who just couldn't handle the character.  I'm glad she didn't win the Oscar for this, because she fails to fully develop the woman.  I understand that the character us more of a cypher to begin with, but there was opportunity to flesh out a burgeoning passion in her eyes.  Instead, Chastain comes across very forced in her moments of conviction.  She can stare off to the side very well, but when it comes to yelling about what she wants and angrily writing on her bosses window, she comes off like a mere pretender.  The supporting cast is marvelous though.  Jason Clarke is remarkably restrained as Dan, the chief administrator of the torturous tactics, and Jennifer Ehle is so beautifully composed and natural as Jessica.  I also loved what Kyle Chandler was able to do with his character, making him feel like far more than a hot-headed boss.  It was also really cool to see Harold Perrineau in the film.At the end of the day, `Zero Dark Thirty' lives up to much of the hype.

1619922,A2C5D9IGOXNVB9,B00AZNEW5G,Andrew Sterland,"[6, 21]","I walked into Zero Dark Thirty expecting a film with the heart pounding excitement of The Hurt Locker.  This film is marketed as a thriller but, it really is anything but.  Whilst I thought the final 20 minutes was clever filmmaking, the pace of the remainder of this 2.5 hour film is very dull, with almost no climatic moments.  The so called tense 'torture' scenes were just boring.  When the film started and we get underway with the story development, after an hour I remember thinking to myself 'okay.. now that the character development is complete, this will start ramping up, getting tense and heart pounding.' Er.. no.  Another one hour of arguing between the lead actress and a bunch of co-workers follows.  Sheesh.  Now, before you say I just like slam bam b-grade action movies, some of this year's best films have been slower moving dialogue driven films.  Take 'Argo' and 'Django Unchained' - fascinating dialogue driven movies, supported by great screenplays.  In Zero Dark Thirty the dialogue is just uninteresting and lacking any thrill.  In Zero Dark Thirty we get 2 hours of very slow and dull material, and then the staple 20 minute resolution.  Even the finale was not even the slightest bit thrilling.  The camera work was very good at capturing the mood (loved the handicam effect) but, there was no thrilling climax that great movies have.  The hunt for the fugitive was very matter of fact, what we know happens gets done in a very ho hum fashion, and the credits immediately roll.  What?  That was it?  That was an Oscar Best Picture front runner?  Please.  Ebert was spot-on with his review of this one.  If there's any justice, the white knuckled thriller Argo will get the nod this year -  a great example of a rare film that with almost no action present, creates a heart pounding movie simply from incredibly tense dialogue and situations.  (Although, I haven't seen the other favourite 'Lincoln' yet.)

1619927,ARA48345JZPZR,B00AZNEW5G,Archmaker,"[6, 11]","This is top notch filmmaking.  Not a documentary, but a movie based on fact. That means the characters are composites of many people, dialogue is invented, and chronologies shifted and arranged to tell a coherent story. When all the controversy and argument is exhausted we are left with a stunning thriller based on facts but not necessarily precisely factual. This should, of course, be understood of any historical fiction.  A movie simply cannot explain everything in detail, most especially a ten year hunt for one man among billions.This is a fine film attesting to those who toil in obscurity to keep our sorry keisters safe.  Within the confines and strictures of a 2 plus hour film it tries to capture the long, arduous, lonely work of intelligence gathering, and the frustration of the search for the proverbial needle in a haystack.  I think this does so entertainingly, and that is no mean feat.The harsh treatment of detainees depicted in the beginning of the film is appropriate if it is understood in the context of the sheer panic within the relevant institutions that another attack as terrible as 9/11 or even more so was imminent. Whether the film over emphasizes this or depicts the amount and extent of time within which this took place fairly or not, I cannot answer.  It certainly doesn't sugarcoat it nor does it celebrate this treatment.  It opts to present it clearly and unflinchingly.  I do think it errs in not clarifying that after the initial panic, and even during this time, more traditional interrogation techniques were the norm.  But let there be no doubt, this was rough business with very determined and implacable foes, and I appreciated the intercutting of newsreel footage of the bombs going off worldwide while these analysts and operators were under enormous pressure to stop the carnage.Apparently, the lead to the courier that took them to Bin Laden came from several sources, and if the film leaves the impression that it was solely through harsh interrogation that it was obtained, that is unfortunate.  The film does make it clear that the final clue, the courier's real name and not his nom de guerre was found otherwise.  Anyway, this section of the film is where the controversy lies, and none of us writing here knows the real truth of it.Past that, the movie depicts the years of sacrifice of Maya, based on a real CIA analyst and probably a composite of several.  Many people spent long and fruitless hours and years in the search for Bin Laden, often at the risk of their own lives.  I think the movie fairly captures that effort.When the film gets to the raid in Abbottabad it kicks into high gear and Kathryn Bigelow's unerring knack for directing action makes a known outcome still a pulse-pounding, tense and breathless piece of business.  Extremely well done.Jessica Chastain is terrific as the dedicated analyst with apparently no social life, unsparingly sacrificing all to the mission.  Jennifer Ehle, always great, nicely represents the senior analyst that was a crucial part of this story and I was glad her & her collegues story was represented here as I recall the headlines surrounding it.  Jason Clarke, again always great, is perfect as the operator conducting the harsh interrogations with no qualms.  He plays dirty with tough customers, but it also wears on him. Mark Strong is always a reassuring and solid presence.  No fault in any of the casting.The film makes clear that the War On Terror is truly war at its meanest, nastiest and truest.  The innocent can be harmed as well as the guilty.  And as Stan McCrystal recently said, the problem with ""torture"" is the harm it does to the perpetrator as much or more so as to the subject in that it is a path once taken, no one can be sure where it will lead.  But to forget the context of panic and terror for those charged with our security in those days following 9/11 is I believe an unfair oversight.Zero Dark Thirty very clearly depicts a determined, hardened, ruthless, pitiless enemy and the people we charge to stop them.  It also shows the extraordinary sacrifice and determination of a few of them to hunt down and bring justice to the author of so much of this maiming, death, and heartache.  That they got Bin Laden at all is still a stunning piece of work. The movie honors that work.",5,Laboring in the Dark,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,4319,"['top', 'notch', 'filmmaking', 'Not', 'documentary', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'composites', 'many', 'people', 'dialogue', 'invented', 'chronologies', 'shifted', 'arranged', 'tell', 'coherent', 'story', 'When', 'controversy', 'argument', 'exhausted', 'are', 'left', 'stunning', 'thriller', 'based', 'facts', 'not', 'necessarily', 'precisely', 'factual', 'should', 'course', 'be', 'understood', 'historical', 'fiction', 'movie', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'everything', 'detail', 'most', 'especially', 'ten', 'year', 'hunt', 'one', 'man', 'billions.This', 'fine', 'film', 'attesting', 'who', 'toil', 'obscurity', 'keep', 'sorry', 'keisters', 'safe', 'confines', 'strictures', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'capture', 'long', 'arduous', 'lonely', 'work', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'frustration', 'search', 'proverbial', 'needle', 'haystack', 'think', 'so', 'entertainingly', 'mean', 'feat.The', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'detainees', 'depicted', 'beginning', 'film', 'appropriate', 'understood', 'context', 'sheer', 'panic', 'relevant', 'institutions', 'attack', 'as', 'terrible', '9/11', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'imminent', 'film', 'amount', 'extent', 'time', 'took', 'place', 'fairly', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'celebrate', 'treatment', 'present', 'clearly', 'unflinchingly', 'do', 'think', 'not', 'clarifying', 'initial', 'panic', 'even', 'time', 'more', 'traditional', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'were', 'norm', 'let', 'be', 'doubt', 'was', 'rough', 'business', 'very', 'determined', 'implacable', 'foes', 'appreciated', 'intercutting', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'bombs', 'going', 'off', 'worldwide', 'analysts', 'operators', 'were', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'stop', 'carnage.Apparently', 'lead', 'courier', 'took', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'came', 'several', 'sources', 'film', 'impression', 'was', 'solely', 'harsh', 'interrogation', 'was', 'obtained', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'make', 'clear', 'final', 'clue', 'courier', 'real', 'name', 'not', 'nom', 'guerre', 'was', 'found', 'otherwise', 'Anyway', 'section', 'film', 'where', 'controversy', 'none', 'writing', 'here', 'real', 'truth', 'it.Past', 'movie', 'years', 'sacrifice', 'Maya', 'based', 'real', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'probably', 'composite', 'several', 'Many', 'people', 'spent', 'long', 'fruitless', 'hours', 'years', 'search', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'often', 'risk', 'own', 'lives', 'think', 'movie', 'fairly', 'film', 'raid', 'Abbottabad', 'high', 'gear', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'unerring', 'knack', 'directing', 'action', 'known', 'outcome', 'still', 'pulse-pounding', 'tense', 'breathless', 'piece', 'business', 'Extremely', 'well', 'done.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'terrific', 'dedicated', 'analyst', 'apparently', 'social', 'life', 'unsparingly', 'sacrificing', 'mission', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'always', 'great', 'nicely', 'senior', 'analyst', 'was', 'crucial', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'glad', 'collegues', 'story', 'was', 'represented', 'here', 'recall', 'headlines', 'surrounding', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'again', 'always', 'great', 'perfect', 'operator', 'conducting', 'harsh', 'interrogations', 'qualms', 'dirty', 'tough', 'customers', 'also', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'always', 'reassuring', 'solid', 'presence', 'fault', 'casting.The', 'film', 'clear', 'War', 'Terror', 'truly', 'war', 'meanest', 'nastiest', 'truest', 'innocent', 'can', 'be', 'harmed', 'as', 'well', 'guilty', 'Stan', 'McCrystal', 'recently', 'said', 'problem', 'torture', 'harm', 'perpetrator', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'subject', 'path', 'once', 'taken', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'forget', 'context', 'panic', 'terror', 'charged', 'security', 'days', 'following', '9/11', 'believe', 'unfair', 'oversight.Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'very', 'clearly', 'determined', 'hardened', 'ruthless', 'pitiless', 'enemy', 'people', 'charge', 'stop', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'sacrifice', 'determination', 'few', 'hunt', 'down', 'bring', 'justice', 'author', 'so', 'much', 'maiming', 'death', 'heartache', 'got', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'still', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work', 'movie', 'honors', 'work']",N/A

Whether this film is based mostly on facts is up for debate but it seems that most agree it leans towards fiction for the most part.  Either way it's an entertaining film with parts that are most certainly realistic such as the public transport system bombing in England in July of '05 as well as the place where Bin Laden had apparently been hiding for years.  I imagine the parts at the end where the American soldiers invade the building at night and wipe out Bin Laden to seal the deal is nowhere near as accurate as it's portrayed in Zero Dark Thirty but for what it is (Hollywood entertainment) it's a nice fitting way to conclude a movie.  Then again when we realize that children were involved and seeing everything unfold before their eyes resulting in tears, it's really not the kind of entertainment I had in mind.For the most part the film is about a CIA agent named Jessica Chastain who is *extremely* determined to bring down Bin Laden by any means necessary.  To say she has an obsession bringing down the worlds most wanted man is an understatement.  Throughout the film she interrogates and negotiates with anyone who may know where Bin Laden's hiding, or she has her team torture and threaten anyone who has ties to Bin Laden.  To put it simply, she's a terrific actress and is easily the high point of this movie.  Otherwise most of the actors and actresses, while equally determined, are somewhat dull.While the movie thankfully never drags and while it does show us several realistic events that really did occur, unfortunately the biggest problem is that it's not 100% accurate.  Of course the movie needed to sell tickets at the movie theaters and make it Hollywood-like for the viewers to keep them focused, but Dark Zero Thirty's inability to be 100% accurate is the main reason I can't give it 5 stars.

First, it just plain hard to believe that with all the resources and billions available to the CIA, it took 10 years to find and kill Bin Laden. Then they ""find"" him in a great big obvious fortress in Pakistan with barb wire on the walls after spending years torturing miscellaneous persons to get intel.  (The torture scenes are the grittiest and most gripping parts of the movie and we Americans hate to think we employ those methods.  That is also the biggest controversy about the film.)Why not just fly around Pakistan and stake out all the suspicious fortresses first.  The ""fortress"" has only 3 men in it, only one of whom is armed,Bin Laden's son and UBL himself..... and about two dozen women and kids.  No disrespect to the Navy Seals.  They are highly skilled and do as told with incalculable bravery.  I thought the movie made them look bumbling. Wouldn't there have been a big effort to catch UBL alive? Noooooo, they run in the room and blow half his face off.  I don't believe the ""official"" version of this story and the movie made the events look even more ridiculous..I find all  the ""facts"" about Bin Laden's death dubious, none more so than his burial at sea.  No photos. Rush rush and hush hush.  Who was that man in the body bag?Normally, a movie fictionalizing an actual event has the leeway to add some excitement. This version just drags as did the 10 year hunt for Bin Laden.  Chastain mostly appears in multiple scenes staring at a computer and nibbling snacks....for 10 years!  Boring.  Occasionally she gets to have a little hissy fit and drop the f-bomb.  Her character is not rounded out at all in that 10 years and of course she never ages.

It covers a time period of nearly ten years, and you feel the length of the film accordingly. Each minute wears on you as time passes by with no real headway in the search for arguably history's most wanted man, and you begin to wonder whether it was all really worth all the fuss (and time... and effort... and cost...) of watching people look for him. This movie is drama much more than it is suspense, action, or anything one could remotely consider ""light"" (there are moments of levity, but they are more brief breaks from the slow-mounting tension than anything genuinely comical).With the main characters of this movie all being CIA and military special forces, you might expect it to be an edge-of-your-seat thriller. While there are a couple moments of thrills, the vast majority is spent wondering where the thrills ran off to. Between a moderately graphic torture scene at the beginning and a raid on UBL's compound at the end, there's mostly just a lot of talking and scheming and thinking and nerve-wearing stretching of moments.If you prefer for your movies to present you with some sort of agenda, as though Hollywood is responsible for calibrating your own moral compass, this one might not do the trick. It presents its material in a surprisingly even-handed light, which has reportedly bothered some of the more negative-minded critics out there. Since this film features depictions of distasteful acts, in the opinion of some, it is the job of the filmmaker to make obvious her distaste for said acts instead of simply portraying the story unfiltered.Why you should see it:On the surface of it, Zero Dark Thirty is, in the mold of both Argo and Lincoln this year, an expertly told historical tale. It takes an event about which most of us know many of the details and still makes it a gripping film going experience. When I take a step back and think about it, I realize that it's pretty inappropriate for me to catch myself holding my breath while watching any movie, let alone one with an ending of which I am quite familiar. And yet, that's exactly what this movie did to me, even more so than either of its historical counterparts among this year's crop of nominees.I could probably talk at length about any number of things that I consider strengths of this movie. The brilliantly understated performances of every member of the cast, not least of all Jessica Chastain, which allow the film to be driven by the slow grind of the developing plot and the atmosphere it creates. The deft and even-handed treatment of the (only partially known) source material that allows the audience to draw its own conclusions regarding both the means and the end of the hunt for Bin Laden. The distinct lack of blatant Hollywood moments used to artificially amp up the suspense of each moment, which intriguingly does much more to draw the viewer into those very moments. And, not necessarily the movie itself, but - the trailer, which perfectly conveys to the viewer exactly what to expect from the movie without spoiling any of it (I seriously love this trailer, even more than I typically love trailers, which is saying a lot).But what I really want to talk about is something else entirely. Or, more appropriately, maybe it's the combination of all of the above that leads to something that has really stuck with me as a movie-going experience I'm not used to. Now switching to explicitly first person, since it's the only voice that really seems appropriate:When I was leaving the theater, I knew that I had been made to feel something, but I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Then, as I thought back through the events of the movie, I realized that I hadn't felt ""something"" at all. I had felt a number of things, and those feelings had corresponded exactly with Jessica Chastain's character Maya. And, by reflection, my own feelings on the UBL manhunt itself. Ranging from discomfort to resolve to determination to jadedness to exhaustion to relief, and, as the screen went black: emptiness. I had just devoted nearly three hours of my life to watching this movie - much like the characters devoted nearly ten years of their lives to catching Bin Laden, and the closing impression we were all left with was emptiness. Not the kind of emptiness that accompanies the depressed thoughts of ""why did I just watch this movie,"" but instead the kind of emptiness that hit Maya like a hammer when she pondered her past and wondered how that could point her to any future.In Short:To be honest, if you have seen the trailer, you should know exactly what to expect from Zero Dark Thirty (unless you're bad at watching trailers... it's not a skill everyone has). I saw in it one of the best and most evocative trailers I've ever encountered, and that's pretty much exactly the kind of movie I ended up seeing. It's subtle yet direct, clear in purpose yet uncertain in meaning.

There appears to be a lot of Hollywood &#34;license&#34; taken by the producers.  As a retired military officer, some of the unprofessional conduct displayed in this film by the CIA personnel depicted was a bit disturbing.  The female lead behaved like a spoiled adolescent brat pouting and throwing temper tantrums if she didn't get the desired actions from her superiors and the higher ups in the CIA and executive branch.  Can't believe this person got in her boss's face and wrote on his glass office window each day that no action was taken on Bin Laden.  Come on?? This was totally disrespectful, immature and unprofessional. First off, it was not his call to make.  Such decisions are made by the top leadership.  Whoever inserted this has never worked within a chain of command structure.  Can't imagine any supervisor putting up with this bratish behavior.  It also reinforced stereotypes of redheads as hot headed and out of control.  Wished the film had focused on the Special Ops community more and their preparation for the raid which deserved more film time instead of this crazy out of control lady.  The Special Operators do come off like the true professionals they are, so some credit to the film makers for that.

She gave a multi-layered and full-bodied character study of a determined CIA agent.The film is a flawlessly written, acted, directed and edited film with a complex and important storyto tell.The film's 157 min length seemed like a normal 120 min film, engaging, captivating and exciting.In my view, it is the Best Film of this year's nominated Oscar films.",5,Excellent Film of An Important Story,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,1166,"['film', 'started', 'harrowing', 'voice', 'recordings', 'victums', '911', 'black', 'screen.It', 'motion', 'American', 'government', 'efforts', 'hunting', 'down', 'Bin', 'Laden.The', 'script', 'writer', 'did', 'painstaking', 'job', 'woven', 'multi-stranded', 'stories', 'together', 'throughoutthe', 'unsuing', '10', 'year', 'period', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'capture', 'execution.All', 'characters', 'ends', 'war', 'were', 'finely', 'sketched', 'cast', 'acted.The', 'several', 'water', 'board', 'interrogation', 'sequences', 'were', 'brutal', 'courageous', 'filmmakers', 'toreveal', 'objections', 'accuracy', 'actually', 'large', 'cast', 'was', 'strongly', 'headed', 'Jessica', 'Chastian', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'awarded', ""year'sBest"", 'Actress', 'Award', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'eye', 'opening', 'performance', 'SilverLining', 'Playbook', 'gave', 'multi-layered', 'full-bodied', 'character', 'study', 'determined', 'CIA', 'agent.The', 'film', 'flawlessly', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'edited', 'film', 'complex', 'important', 'storyto', 'tell.The', 'film', '157', 'min', 'length', 'seemed', 'normal', '120', 'min', 'film', 'engaging', 'captivating', 'exciting.In', 'view', 'Best', 'Film', 'year', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'films']",N/A
1619975,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00AZNEW5G,California Dreaming,"[2, 5]","There is a scene where a couple of CIA operatives are watching TV, and Obama is speaking -- I'm sure you've seen the clips -- and Obama says something like, ""America doesn't torture people.""  Both of the operatives stare at the TV for an extended moment, look away, and then continue talking.  And I've heard that quite a few critics wrote something like, ""This movie left it up for the viewer to make a judgement about this scene.""Wrong.  The operatives had a look of complete dismissal, as they should have had, which is certainly making a statement.  If you believe that the US doesn't torture to get information, then I have some oceanfront real estate to sell you in Iowa.  Every country tortures to some degree, and the US is not surely immune from it.  And there are certainly some cases where it is justified.  (If you use some simple thought experiments, and you use logic, you should quickly agree.)But is this why Kathryn Bigelow was not nominated for best direction in this film, when either the actors were simply outstanding or she deserved to win?  (I haven't seen the film where Ben Affleck won, but she definitely should have been nominated.)  But with regards to the acting, while watching you will really feel like a fly-on-the-wall spectator, hanging by unseen and listening in on extraordinary but still everyday discussions.  Just like the film ""United 93"" -- a film that I highly recommend watching if you haven't already -- there are almost no huge-name actors here but actors who act naturally.  That is a refreshing change, and that requires excellent direction.  It is probably easy to direct when actors overact, but requires extreme restraint to let them live in the moment.Jessica Chastain is awesome here, and you get the feeling that she is Ms. Bigelow's alter ego.  (I wouldn't doubt that Ms. Bigelow probably wanted to play the part herself if she could.)  Many films come out nowadays where you get this ""strong female lead,"" but you know it's often just for political correctness reasons.  Not here.  Ms. Chastain kicks you-know-what and takes names, and she uses those names to find her way to Bin Laden.  She wants to kill him seemingly more than anyone on the planet, and she will not be denied.  But she plays it perfectly at the beginning, having the brains but not quite the stomach for it all, and it seems that she just learns to tolerate some things as time goes along to get her target.So you screwed up again by not nominating Ms. Bigelow for an Oscar, Academy?  What say you?  I say, ""Phooey!""  And I also say, ""Big recommendation on this edge-of-your-seat film.""",5,Riveting,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,2611,"['scene', 'where', 'couple', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'are', 'watching', 'TV', 'Obama', 'speaking', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'Obama', 'something', 'America', ""n't"", 'torture', 'people', 'operatives', 'stare', 'TV', 'extended', 'moment', 'look', 'away', 'then', 'continue', 'talking', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'few', 'critics', 'wrote', 'something', 'movie', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'make', 'judgement', 'scene.', 'Wrong', 'operatives', 'had', 'look', 'complete', 'dismissal', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'certainly', 'making', 'statement', 'believe', 'US', ""n't"", 'torture', 'get', 'information', 'then', 'have', 'oceanfront', 'real', 'estate', 'sell', 'Iowa', 'Every', 'country', 'degree', 'US', 'not', 'surely', 'immune', 'are', 'certainly', 'cases', 'where', 'justified', 'use', 'simple', 'thought', 'experiments', 'use', 'logic', 'should', 'quickly', 'agree', 'why', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'best', 'direction', 'film', 'when', 'actors', 'were', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'deserved', 'win', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'where', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'won', 'definitely', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'regards', 'acting', 'watching', 'will', 'really', 'feel', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'spectator', 'hanging', 'unseen', 'listening', 'extraordinary', 'still', 'everyday', 'discussions', 'Just', 'film', 'United', '93', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'are', 'almost', 'huge-name', 'actors', 'here', 'actors', 'who', 'act', 'naturally', 'refreshing', 'change', 'excellent', 'direction', 'probably', 'easy', 'direct', 'when', 'actors', 'overact', 'extreme', 'restraint', 'let', 'live', 'moment.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'awesome', 'here', 'get', 'feeling', 'Ms.', 'Bigelow', 'alter', 'ego', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'Ms.', 'Bigelow', 'probably', 'wanted', 'play', 'part', 'could', 'Many', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'nowadays', 'where', 'get', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'know', 'often', 'just', 'political', 'correctness', 'reasons', 'Not', 'here', 'Ms.', 'Chastain', 'you-know-what', 'names', 'names', 'find', 'way', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'kill', 'seemingly', 'more', 'anyone', 'planet', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'perfectly', 'beginning', 'having', 'brains', 'not', 'quite', 'stomach', 'just', 'tolerate', 'things', 'time', 'along', 'get', 'target.So', 'screwed', 'up', 'again', 'not', 'nominating', 'Ms.', 'Bigelow', 'Oscar', 'Academy', 'What', 'say', 'say', 'Phooey', 'also', 'say', 'Big', 'recommendation', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'film']",N/A

1619996,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00AZNEW5G,Chris Kennison,"[4, 7]","Kathryn Bigelow won an Oscar with ""The Hurt Locker"" and it seems she's either fascinated with the war on terror, just really good at making movies about the war on terror, or both. I'd have to go with both. The original focus of the film was supposed to be about the December 21st battle of Tora Bora, also a film about Usama Bin Laden. When they were about to begin filming, news broke of the successful raid of the Bin Laden compound in May of 2011. Bigelow immediately shelved her Tora Bora project and redirected her focus.In this review, I'm going to do a little bit of comparison between ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Argo"". They are completely different movies, but they are both historical and both are going to be mentioned a lot in the days and night leading up to Oscars. While both are factual accounts and both tried to be as accurate and true to the real events as possible, I found ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to be a cut above ""Argo"" for one glaring reason. Bigelow did not rely on Hollywood gimmicks to ramp up tension; she allowed the real events of the story do that. Affleck, with ""Argo"", I think did.Bigelow cast an extremely talented and fearless actress in Jessica Chastain who has been absolutely on fire since breaking onto the scene. After making her film debut in ""Jolene"", she continued to `wow' casting agents and landed parts in big time films like ""The Debt"", ""The Tree of Life"", ""The Help"", ""Lawless"" and ""Zero Dark"" among others in just three years time. Now, she is the favorite to take home Oscar for this film, and you will see why. Chastain, had to be tough as nails and vulnerable as well in order to pull off Maya. Maya is a CIA agent who spent 12-years in the agency doing one thing, tracking Bin Laden and risking everything on a thin and muddled lead that she had found Bin Laden's currier.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is not only incredibly accurate, it is an important piece of filmmaking that makes you question many things. The torture tactics that were used were important to finding Bin Laden, but also those tactics mixed with kindness may have played an even bigger part. The film also shows how incredibly complex and difficult it is to navigate the terror networks and as much as everybody likes to paint a yes and a no, a wrong and a right on everything done or to be done, there is nothing definitive in the war on terror.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a fantastic film that I have no doubts will make Oscar voting very difficult this year and will certainly make voting for Best Actress very difficult as well. It is an important movie about history and an inside look at the intelligence battles that our agents are fighting everyday to keep us safe.",5,HARSH REALITIES OF WAR told with truth and NO APOLOGIES,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2672,"['Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'fascinated', 'war', 'terror', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'making', 'movies', 'war', 'terror', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'original', 'focus', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'December', '21st', 'battle', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'also', 'film', 'Usama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'When', 'were', 'about', 'begin', 'filming', 'news', 'broke', 'successful', 'raid', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'compound', 'May', '2011', 'Bigelow', 'immediately', 'shelved', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'project', 'redirected', 'focus.In', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'comparison', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Argo', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'movies', 'are', 'historical', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'mentioned', 'lot', 'days', 'night', 'leading', 'up', 'Oscars', 'are', 'factual', 'accounts', 'tried', 'be', 'accurate', 'true', 'real', 'events', 'possible', 'found', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'be', 'cut', 'Argo', 'one', 'glaring', 'reason', 'Bigelow', 'did', 'not', 'rely', 'Hollywood', 'gimmicks', 'ramp', 'up', 'tension', 'allowed', 'real', 'events', 'story', 'do', 'Affleck', 'Argo', 'think', 'did.Bigelow', 'cast', 'extremely', 'talented', 'fearless', 'actress', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'been', 'absolutely', 'fire', 'breaking', 'scene', 'making', 'film', 'debut', 'Jolene', 'continued', 'wow', 'casting', 'agents', 'landed', 'parts', 'big', 'time', 'films', 'Debt', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Help', 'Lawless', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'others', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'time', 'Now', 'favorite', 'take', 'home', 'Oscar', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'Chastain', 'had', 'be', 'tough', 'nails', 'vulnerable', 'as', 'well', 'order', 'pull', 'off', 'Maya', 'Maya', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'spent', '12-years', 'agency', 'doing', 'one', 'thing', 'tracking', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'risking', 'everything', 'thin', 'muddled', 'lead', 'had', 'found', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'currier', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'important', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'question', 'many', 'things', 'torture', 'tactics', 'were', 'used', 'were', 'important', 'finding', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'also', 'tactics', 'mixed', 'kindness', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'even', 'bigger', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'difficult', 'navigate', 'terror', 'networks', 'as', 'much', 'everybody', 'paint', 'yes', 'wrong', 'right', 'everything', 'done', 'be', 'done', 'nothing', 'definitive', 'war', 'terror', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'fantastic', 'film', 'have', 'doubts', 'will', 'make', 'Oscar', 'voting', 'very', 'difficult', 'year', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'voting', 'Best', 'Actress', 'very', 'difficult', 'well', 'important', 'movie', 'history', 'inside', 'look', 'intelligence', 'agents', 'are', 'fighting', 'everyday', 'keep', 'safe']",N/A

It absolutely lives up to, if not surpasses, her previous Oscar winning effort.Bigelow&#8217;s passion for this subject is in just about every shot, with immense detail, cold bluntness, and enough humanity to keep it from being too oppressing. Actually for a two and a half hour film it&#8217;s quite efficient filmmaking, jam-packed with numerous interrogations and investigation tactics (the torture stuff that has garnered controversy is only a very small part of that) shaking real life terrorist attacks, and political wrangling, yet it&#8217;s never confused or disjointed. Even towards the end with the recreations of the raid on the compound in Pakistan done very deliberately, the pacing is never betrayed, maintaining consistent movement and direction; it&#8217;s a scene that plays out as much mystery as suspense as the seal team goes from room to room blowing out locked doors and not knowing for certain if the main target is there.The movie&#8217;s structure, with one main character, Maya a member of the CIA played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, taking a part in virtually every aspect of this manhunt, with other people revolving in their various tasks around her, was the perfect choice. If one person really did have this much impact on the manhunt we&#8217;ll probably never know for sure, but in this film it&#8217;s played out believably and compellingly, and though no one can match her neither is anyone else insignificant to how it plays out. Characters with only a few scenes have noticeable impacts. But with Maya is the emotion, determination, the sassiness and intelligence of a woman who evolves in nuanced but never uninteresting ways.Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible achievement, and in my mind candidate for best film made so far this decade. It has brought about an important debate, but more significantly it covers ten years of the war on terror in prime fashion. Bigelow plays for high realism but she also knows how to create great drama by stretching but never breaking those confines. Every scene belongs for a purpose and never does it feel like one is missing; that in itself is an incredible achievement. Credit her, the cast, and, not to forget, the great script by Mark Boal.Unfortunately the blu-ray is underwhelming with regards to any special features. Hopefully a more complete package comes out someday with commentary and more in-depth stuff. However the film is amazing and this blu-ray has among the highest caliber of picture and sound quality.

What surprised me was how quickly I got sucked into this story. A prisoner is going through only what I can describe as a rough interrogation. It became quickly evident that this movie was going to portray plenty of inhumane treatment and that the people conducting these interrogations would quickly adapt to methods that were not officially sanctioned by the U.S. government but apparently practiced by the CIA and other government agencies. Quickly propelled into these interrogatory sessions is a young security analyst named Maya. Portrayed by Jessica Chastin, Maya is smart and driven and has quite a mouth on her. Recruited straight out of high school into government service, she is a driven and dedicated woman who is seen as being obsessed with locating Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. After 9/11, it seemed as though the entire non-Arab world was trying to figure out where he was. In reality, few credible leads surfaced regarding Bin Laden's whereabouts except for plenty dead ends. However, the security community was busy with other things such as foiling terrorist attacks on the home front and foreign soil. As the movie progresses, Maya and her co-workers work a lot on the emerging threats and Maya is portrayed as hunting down Bin Laden by herself in her spare time. I found it hard not to think of Maya as a tiny vigilante working alone to bring down the giant based on the way her character is developed. As the movie progresses, world events get in the way as do government assignments and changes in leadership, but Maya perseveres with little verifiable information for her trouble. Maya finds herself thrown in harms way on a few occasions as when she gets caught in riots or when the hotel she is dining at is blown up. In the process of watching this, the viewer finds that huge bribes are offered in exchange for information and gets a sense of how information is obtained without torture.As Maya's leads begin to pay off, it becomes a waiting game regarding if and when the government plans to act. The information is circumstantial at best despite a large number of people on the ground covertly attempting to get significant information. Tension builds as the Navy Seals congregate at a desert outpost awaiting word to proceed with their daring attack which is tantalizing to the viewer but not completely explained before hand.Quite a lot of the scenes that lead up to the Seal operation to apprehend Bin Laden are interesting and provides a groundwork  as to how the intelligence community works in tandem with the military. Obviously, the part of the movie that I found most interesting was the invasion of the Bin Laden complex as the Seals scoured the property for Bin Laden. It was tense and electrifying as they moved from room to room in pursuit of the prize.  It was so intricately planned and executed that I found myself sitting on the edge of my Visually, this entire segment was really well done and justified the Seals reputation.Overall, I liked this movie. The story was told in a way that was easy to follow. The acting was good though it was clearly Jessica Chastain's trash mouth Maya who dominated this story.

1620014,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00AZNEW5G,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[6, 9]","Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal garnered Oscars for their war film The Hurt Locker a few years ago.  While planning a film on the fruitless hunt for Al Queda leader, Osama Bin Laden, the fugitive was eventually tracked down and killed after a decade.  The filmmakers subsequently expanded their film, gathered from several first-hand accounts, and the result is Zero Dark Thirty, a thoroughly detailed, complex study in the greatest manhunt in recent history.  It is a fascinating study in the tedious work of the behind-the-scenes faceless men and women whose intelligence gathering efforts and in some cases obsessive determination culminate in the most stunning of missions.As audio of frantic, desperate victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center plays in the background, we flash forward a couple of years to the Middle East and a torture scene of an Arab prisoner witnessed by newly transplanted CIA operative, Maya (Jessica Chastain), whose intelligence is matched by her sharp tongue and dogged stubbornness.  As part of a group of operatives sifting clues and leads to locate terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, she comes into conflict with  traditional, out of date methodologies.  Her theory centers on a courier who could be the link to their target, but to identify, locate and follow this suspect proves confounding and fruitless over the years as other hopeful leads fail to pan out or prove deadly. More terrorist attacks occur globally and there is a greater sense of urgency when Maya stumbles upon a crucial, misplaced piece of information.  A remarkable series of interviews in remote, secret locations and painstaking surveillance result in a possible hideout.  The question is whether to take the chance of launching a strike mission based on imperfect, yet probable data and plain, gut feelings.  What follows is a minute by minute recreation of the subsequent, military mission to end all missions.The infamous torture scenes are not so much violent as unbearable and uncomfortable.  To center on these scenes misses the point of the film.  While the story could have left out the bulk of these moments, they only serve to illustrate one of the means of collecting hard intelligence.  The film also shows the toll these acts take on the human psyche of some of the interrogators.Chastain's character is quite the rebellious analyst who is unafraid to speak her mind or display emotion.  What we don't know is her background or her family or friends.  This rough sketch of a character may serve this story adequately, but it denies the audience of more textured character development and audience empathy.  She has a deep resolve that will keep her searching for years and endless interviews often in disguise to protect her identity as she herself becomes a target, looking for the one misstep or inadvertent mention of a name or detail.  She even challenges and stands up to her superiors including the Director of the CIA (played with great effect by James Gandolfini) because of her self belief.  Hers is a female operating in essentially a male dominated profession much as Jodie Foster proves herself in similar environs in Silence of the Lambs.Bigelow excels with this intense, intricate screenplay.  She is in her element during the last half hour of the film (where there is effective use of a minimal musical score and eerie, night vision camera work) as the stealth helicopters proceed to their target and she flexes her filmic muscles, which she does as well as any action director.  John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) would be proud.As a chronicle of the remarkable mosaic of intelligence work, Zero Dark Thirty is excellent. If it lacks a little heart and soul, that's not the fault of the filmmakers so much as the source material.  While it could have easily been a thorough miniseries on television, it has been distilled to a highly engaging tale of good old fashioned detective work of the highest order. When Maya reacts to the mission's completion at the end, it is one of emotional release which the audience shares and could very well have been Bigelow's own reaction to a job thoroughly well done.",4,ZERO DARK THIRTY and the Ultimate Manhunt,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,4203,"['Director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'garnered', 'Oscars', 'war', 'film', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'planning', 'film', 'fruitless', 'hunt', 'Al', 'Queda', 'leader', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'fugitive', 'was', 'eventually', 'tracked', 'down', 'killed', 'decade', 'filmmakers', 'subsequently', 'expanded', 'film', 'gathered', 'several', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'result', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'thoroughly', 'detailed', 'complex', 'study', 'greatest', 'manhunt', 'recent', 'history', 'fascinating', 'study', 'tedious', 'work', 'behind-the-scenes', 'faceless', 'men', 'women', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'efforts', 'cases', 'obsessive', 'determination', 'culminate', 'most', 'stunning', 'missions.As', 'audio', 'frantic', 'desperate', 'victims', 'September', '11', '2001', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'background', 'flash', 'forward', 'couple', 'years', 'Middle', 'East', 'torture', 'scene', 'Arab', 'prisoner', 'witnessed', 'newly', 'transplanted', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Maya', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'intelligence', 'matched', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'dogged', 'stubbornness', 'part', 'group', 'operatives', 'sifting', 'clues', 'locate', 'terrorist', 'mastermind', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'conflict', 'traditional', 'date', 'methodologies', 'theory', 'centers', 'courier', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'link', 'target', 'identify', 'locate', 'follow', 'suspect', 'confounding', 'fruitless', 'years', 'other', 'hopeful', 'leads', 'fail', 'pan', 'out', 'prove', 'deadly', 'More', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'occur', 'globally', 'greater', 'sense', 'urgency', 'when', 'Maya', 'crucial', 'misplaced', 'piece', 'information', 'remarkable', 'series', 'interviews', 'remote', 'secret', 'locations', 'painstaking', 'surveillance', 'result', 'possible', 'hideout', 'question', 'take', 'chance', 'launching', 'strike', 'mission', 'based', 'imperfect', 'probable', 'data', 'plain', 'gut', 'feelings', 'What', 'minute', 'minute', 'recreation', 'subsequent', 'military', 'mission', 'end', 'missions.The', 'infamous', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'violent', 'unbearable', 'uncomfortable', 'center', 'scenes', 'point', 'film', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'bulk', 'moments', 'only', 'serve', 'illustrate', 'one', 'means', 'collecting', 'hard', 'intelligence', 'film', 'also', 'toll', 'acts', 'take', 'human', 'psyche', 'interrogators.Chastain', 'character', 'quite', 'rebellious', 'analyst', 'who', 'unafraid', 'speak', 'mind', 'display', 'emotion', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'family', 'friends', 'rough', 'sketch', 'character', 'may', 'serve', 'story', 'adequately', 'audience', 'more', 'textured', 'character', 'development', 'audience', 'empathy', 'deep', 'resolve', 'will', 'keep', 'searching', 'years', 'endless', 'interviews', 'often', 'disguise', 'protect', 'identity', 'target', 'looking', 'one', 'misstep', 'inadvertent', 'mention', 'name', 'detail', 'even', 'challenges', 'up', 'superiors', 'including', 'Director', 'CIA', 'played', 'great', 'effect', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'self', 'belief', 'Hers', 'female', 'operating', 'essentially', 'male', 'dominated', 'profession', 'much', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'similar', 'environs', 'Silence', 'Lambs.Bigelow', 'excels', 'intense', 'intricate', 'screenplay', 'element', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'where', 'effective', 'use', 'minimal', 'musical', 'score', 'eerie', 'night', 'vision', 'camera', 'work', 'stealth', 'helicopters', 'proceed', 'target', 'flexes', 'filmic', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'director', 'John', 'Milius', 'Wind', 'Lion', 'would', 'be', 'proud.As', 'chronicle', 'remarkable', 'mosaic', 'intelligence', 'work', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'excellent', 'little', 'heart', 'soul', 'not', 'fault', 'filmmakers', 'so', 'much', 'source', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'thorough', 'miniseries', 'television', 'been', 'distilled', 'highly', 'engaging', 'tale', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'detective', 'work', 'highest', 'order', 'When', 'Maya', 'mission', 'completion', 'end', 'one', 'emotional', 'release', 'audience', 'shares', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Bigelow', 'own', 'reaction', 'job', 'thoroughly', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Much like Hurt Locker before it, Zero Dark Thirty is notable for the quiet moments, casual conversations over chow, for example, that explode into horrific scenes of chaos and violence.  These aren't movies interested in hundreds of soldiers invading beaches through exploding rockets and machine-gun bunkers: These are modern war films, where four bullet holes through a house's front door are enough to get the job done.In both cases, Bigelow doesn't flesh-out her main characters with obvious details, but chooses to allow the audience to understand them through their actions and reactions.  It's an engrossing effect and one that gives these characters humanity while also acknowledging that these individuals - immersed in the daily business of war - will never be fully identifiable to civilians; Jessica Chastain handles the role with ease.Pretty much a pitch-perfect demonstration of post-9/11 warfare, where intelligence-gathering and intelligent operations win the day, Zero Dark Thirty may have only one slight misstep and that is Kyle Chandler's character as the ""boss who doesn't listen.""  I know there are these types in real life, but here he almost stands out as an obvious clich&eacute; in the middle of a surprising group of competent characterizations.  Not the actors' fault by any means, his performance is good as always, but his constant nagging and doubts echo too many cop-show captains to give him much believably.A great film that chooses to focus on the mechanics of a sprawling manhunt without commentary or judgment, Zero Dark Thirty is simply riveting in its execution.

The film basically follows one character's decade-long hunt for Bin Laden...scratch that: it follows her decade-long hunt for Bin Laden's courier.  So, you know, this isn't a Stallone film.But the movie manages to maintain a healthy pace.  This is thanks in large part to Jessica Chastain's performance; at times restrained, other moments over-the-top, she is the center of the film here, as the supporting cast (featuring great turns from Mark Strong, Joel Edgerton,  Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini, and others) rotates in and out.  Mark Boal's script doesn't judge, condone, or condemn; many have viewed this movie as ""pro-torture,"" but really, the film just puts it blatantly there: torture was used.  If the script has any major faults, it's that it's more focused on the procedural aspect; at times, we get a sense of how this obsession is affecting Chastain's character...but then we get right back to the case at hand.Bigelow's directing is solid and nuanced; I thought THE HURT LOCKER lacked any real personal touch from her, but we definitely feel it here, going from the intense opening torture sequences, through the bump and grind of office work, to the edge-of-your-seat raid at the finale (conducted in almost pitch darkness).  The film is ultimately a bit of a showoff, but it's hard to hold that against it.  Perhaps ZERO DARK THIRTY isn't the end-all be-all film that many critics hailed it as (Bigelow is one of those directors who seems to evoke the highest--and lowest--praise, with any middle ground usually passed over), but it's certainly a fine film, well-constructed and entertaining despite its at-times mundane subject matter.",4,4.5 Stars: a riveting procedural.,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,2142,"['watched', 'thought', 'ZERO', 'DARK', 'THIRTY', 'would', 'basically', 'be', 'spiritual', 'sequel', 'Bigelow', 'prior', 'film', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'LOCKER', 'great', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'rather', 'tedious', 'full', 'ZERO', ""n't"", 'quite', 'escape', 'shackles', 'important', 'movie', 'definitely', 'up', 'suspense', 'not', 'say', 'thriller', 'procedural', 'rooted', 'firmly', 'dirty', 'politics', 'questionable', 'morality', 'film', 'basically', 'one', 'character', 'decade-long', 'hunt', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'scratch', 'decade-long', 'hunt', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'courier', 'So', 'know', ""n't"", 'Stallone', 'movie', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'pace', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'times', 'restrained', 'other', 'moments', 'over-the-top', 'center', 'film', 'here', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'great', 'turns', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'others', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'script', ""n't"", 'judge', 'condone', 'condemn', 'many', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'pro-torture', 'really', 'film', 'just', 'blatantly', 'torture', 'was', 'used', 'script', 'major', 'faults', 'more', 'focused', 'procedural', 'aspect', 'times', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'obsession', 'affecting', 'Chastain', 'character', 'then', 'get', 'right', 'back', 'case', 'hand.Bigelow', 'directing', 'solid', 'nuanced', 'thought', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'lacked', 'real', 'personal', 'touch', 'definitely', 'feel', 'here', 'going', 'intense', 'opening', 'torture', 'sequences', 'bump', 'grind', 'office', 'work', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'raid', 'finale', 'conducted', 'almost', 'pitch', 'darkness', 'film', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'showoff', 'hard', 'hold', 'Perhaps', 'ZERO', 'DARK', 'THIRTY', ""n't"", 'end-all', 'be-all', 'film', 'many', 'critics', 'hailed', 'Bigelow', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'evoke', 'highest', 'lowest', 'praise', 'middle', 'ground', 'usually', 'passed', 'certainly', 'fine', 'film', 'well-constructed', 'entertaining', 'at-times', 'mundane', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A

1620022,APC8SNF9U2W5W,B00AZNEW5G,DANIEL,"[0, 1]","No SpoilersZero Dark Thirty (see footnote 1) is one of those movies that should win Academy Awards but probably won&#8217;t.  Oh, they will nominate it, but I would bet that most members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (i.e. Hollywood types) might be a little &#8220;gun shy&#8221; of heaping awards on a movie in which American forces kill  Muslim terrorists.  Of course,  the movie is about much more than bagging Osama Bin Laden, notwithstanding the trailer.  Like Argo, this movie delves deeply (some may think too deeply) into how the CIA and politicians ultimately make the decisions culminating in a mission like this.  The result is a movie which can&#8217;t really decide if it&#8217;s a documentary or an action film.  It&#8217;s about two-thirds the former, and one-third the latter.  Not unlike how certain flavors of coffee are created.  You have to judge a cup by the overall taste and aroma, not just the various beans used.Fans of the TV shows 24 and Homeland will appreciate this blend, but anyone paying for a ticket and expecting wall to wall fast action may be disappointed.  I can assure even these folks that the last 25 minutes of the 156 minute film will deliver in spades, assuming you are still in your seat.  That 25 minutes, by the way, is almost exactly the time used by the real life SEAL team.It goes without saying that most of us know that a strike was ordered to get Osama, and that President Obama got the credit, but what we don&#8217;t know is how long and how hard many dedicated people worked to get to the moment of giving that &#8220;order&#8221;.  Over a decade of cat and mouse, pouring over cell phone recordings and emails, scanning satellite intel, checking and rechecking every tiny bit of data, chasing people around in crowded streets, interrogating suspects with methods that are OK one day and maybe criminal the next, losing people to terrorist attacks, and finally locating that one clue that leads to the jackpot.Giving a superb performance in a long and difficult role is Jessica Chastain, as Maya, who we follow from her initial recruitment into the CIA just before 9-11 through the life changing struggle of chasing down the leader of the terrorist world.  What she has to do to achieve her goal changes her forever.  We share in the burden borne by those who keep us safe while we sleep.  Likewise, I would be remiss if I did not say how a movie like this helps us all to understand and appreciate the incredible bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers and those who support them in the intelligence gathering profession.  This is Ms. Chastain&#8217;s first film of import and will certainly put her on the charts.  I also liked Jason Clark, as Dan, another CIA type who works closely with Maya in the early part of the film.  Interestingly, Chastain got the role after the first choice, Rooney Mara (Lisbeth in the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), had to drop out.The music is very good, and for some reason the name Alexandre Desplat did not register, but he also worked with this director on Argo and he did other things you know:  Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The King&#8217;s Speech, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 2, Twilight Saga: New Moon, and Syriana, to name just a few.  He has done so many, you have surely seen one or more of his movies.  I never really noticed the soundtrack (which is good) but at times it amplified what I was seeing, so kudos to Mr. Desplat for this one.The director, Kathryn Bigelow, is very good at her job and quite attractive to boot (check out her publicity photo).  Why James Cameron gave her up is a mystery to me.  She has made some very interesting movies including The Hurt Locker, Point Break, K-19 The Widowmaker, and Strange Days.  I&#8217;ve seen them all.  Her quote is &#8220;You cast not for marquee value but for performance and talent. The right actor for the part. Anything else is a compromise.&#8221;  I would have to agree with that.  And there really aren&#8217;t any in this film who are marquee status.  That works well, because a big name actor would probably have been distracting.  An example you ask?  James Gandolfini makes a brief but memorable cameo.  I love that guy, but I was distracted enough to poke my wife and say &#8220;It&#8217;s Tony Soprano in the White House!&#8221;Having given credit to Ms. Bigelow, I would like to spend a moment on the cinematography.  If you have read my reviews, you know my pet peeve is the &#8220;unsteady&#8221; cam, in which it appears the camera man or woman is in a state from slight to severe inebriation.  This movie falls into the &#8220;slight&#8221; column, because most shots seem to be wobbling around just a bit when there is no need for it.  However, it was not nearly as bad as my all time #1 carsick poster child: District 9 (followed closely by some of the Bourne movies).  This type of camera work began with TV series like Law And Order, and was supposed to make the viewer feel as if what he or she is watching is real (like home movies I guess).A caveat for the squeamish.  As with my prior review of Django, I caution those who are easily upset by scenes of &#8220;mild&#8221; torture.  While there is no actual &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; here, similar tactics are employed, and the film spends a good deal of time showing how detainees are &#8220;persuaded&#8221; to talk.  I felt the movie spent too much time on this aspect, but you be the judge and please leave a comment.  The debate about how far we should go to obtain information that can save lives is ongoing.  I will just say that if my family was threatened, I would want them to go pretty far.  In an interesting and unusual &#8220;reply&#8221; by the CIA (quoted from IMDB):  Acting CIA Director Michael Morell issued a statement about the film emphasizing that while the production team had met with the CIA, the film is a dramatization and is not historically accurate. Morell specifically contradicted the film's assertion that &#34;enhanced interrogation techniques&#34; also known as &#34;torture&#34;, had been of significant benefit in locating Osama bin Laden. Director Morell stated, &#34;That impression is false. We cannot allow a Hollywoodfilm to cloud our memory.&#34;  So there you go.Unlike Argo, the ending did not lend itself to applause, but I think the writers wanted to leave us with the message that there are no winners in this type of ongoing war, only those who won today.Footnote 1: (from IMDB) &#34;0 dark 30&#34; is a term commonly used by the military to refer to a non-specific time when it is dark outside, either very late or very early.

1620032,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B00AZNEW5G,David W. Jones,"[3, 5]","Zero Dark Thirty, which is military talk for 12:30 AM, tells the story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden (about two-thirds of the movie), as well as his eventual take-down (the final third of the movie).  So while it features Navy SEALs in the final act, the real focus is on the intelligence agents who who pursued UBL with dogged determination for more than ten years, particularly Maya (played with intensity by Jessica Chastain).The film won a slew of awards in various categories, including best picture, best director, best actress, best screenplay, best editing and others.  It was also nominated for many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture (it lost to Argo).The blu-ray transer is what one would expect for a recent release--excellent picture and sound--with one exception.  The bin Laden take-down was done at night, and Kathryn Bigelow mimics nighttime conditions as much as possible.  This did not work so well on my TV at home.  The picture was so dark that I had to eliminate all ambient light in the house in order to make out what the SEALs were doing.  I did not remember the movie being that dark when I saw it in the theater.Parental Advisory: This is not a movie for children.  It features torture portrayed in a realistic manner.  This is very difficult to watch even for a guy like me who is used to war movies.  The movie also contains a realistic battle scene at the end of the movie, where people are shot and blood is spilled.  There is also strong language, alcohol, explosions, shootings, etc.  Parents would need to judge whether their high school students could handle it.  I would not recommend it for junior high or below.  Even some adults with sensitive consciences may be bothered.I highly recommend Zero Dark Thirty.

1620050,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00AZNEW5G,Doug Anderson,"[17, 24]","My first reaction to Zero Dark Thirty was that it was a near-great film but that it wasn't great because it didn't show that the people who do this work (relentlessly torture, hunt, and kill people) must be able to shelve their own lives/humanity for the time it takes them to accomplish their mission. This film does everything so well that it seemed a shame that director Kathryn Bigelow didn't show that Maya (Jessica Chastain) was in any way conflicted or troubled about the torture she witnessed and allowed. But then it occured to me that the people who do this kind of work do it precisely because they are not conflicted about it.  One of Maya's black ops co-workers, Patrick (Joel Edgerton), at one point decides to get away ftom the torture facility and go back to Washington, however, this is not because of any crisis of conscience, but simply because he wants to try something else for a while. So this refusal to show either Maya or Patrick as in any way conflicted about their work is actually the boldest choice Bigelow makes with this film. The people who do this work, especially Maya, are no-nonsense types and Bigelow's no-nonsense style foregrounds that quality. I don't think we can really tell by watching this film just what Kathryn Bigelow's politics might be and so they are never a distraction. I enjoyed Argo quite a lot, but saw this the day after I saw Argo and there is no comparison. Argo consistently entertains, but Zero Dark Thirty will blow you away (regardless of your politics). My revised opinion of this film is that it is a great film. Probably the only reason it didn't win any major awards is because the movie doesn't exactly condone torture but it doesn't condemn it either, it remains neutral so that you can decide for yourself how you feel about it. And this makes some viewers (who are used to being told how to feel---with music and other cinematic devices)feel uncomfortable and uncertain (which is what Bigelow wants). But don't take my or anyone's word for it, just see it.

1620051,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00AZNEW5G,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","If you are interested enough to consider seeing ZERO DARK THIRTY in the first place, you will almost certainly find it worthwhile. Just pick a time when you have 2.5 hours and a good bit of patience to spare. The acting, script, and cinematography are all quite good, and Jessica Chastain gives a strong performance as CIA Agent ""Maya,"" generally quiet and low-key but utterly driven in her pursuit of high-level Al-Queda operatives and ultimately, Osama Bin Laden himself.Two problem areas:--Pacing: The first half shows a lot of CIA interrogations, coercion, and bit-by-bit uncoverings of details over the course of eight years. The key events toward the end all happen a little too quickly, and consequently, it seems, too easily. It also stops short in some crucial spots: I don't want to spoil anything, but I think you'll see what I mean. It's entirely possible that the producers were in a hurry to get this out while the events were still fresh on people's minds, hence the lopsided feel of the film. ZERO DARK THIRTY's creators had a long, hard story to tell, but nevertheless, it seems they could have found some ways to add excitement.--Scope: Perhaps intentionally, in order to show the arduous process the CIA went through, there aren't a lot of changes in scenery here. Most of ZERO DARK THIRTY takes place in various CIA headquarters and interrogation rooms. Certain key political and military figures are conspicuously absent, omissions that I'm sure were made because of the recency of these events and a desire to avoid politicization. Still, more of an overview of the roles that other U.S.  agencies, America in general, Pakistan, and the rest of the Middle East played here would also have made this a better film.I haven't done any fact-checking, but as oversimplified as parts of this film are, I'm sure it has some major inaccuracies; e.g., Just who IS ""Maya"" anyway? Does she have a last name?Yet, for all my quibbles, I found ZERO DARK THIRTY riveting, as I think most American audiences will find it, and am glad to have seen it.

The job is not always successful - along the way she loses colleagues and  friends, the victims of terrorist bombs and/or unexpected attacks.  Nor does she obtain full co-operation from her (mostly male) superiors, who seem more concerned with feathering their own reputational nests rather than accomplishing the job in hand.  However, I do have to admit that the film's structure - the us-versus-them notion, with numerous sequences showing the CIA operatives tracking their prey, as well as spying on one another - is a familiar one, dating from the Cold War films of the Sixties and early Seventies.  Only this time the enemies are not the Soviets, but those working for Al-Quaeda.  Other clich&eacute;s also prevail, including the passing of secrets in dark places, the use of extended long shots following characters walking along corridors, and the final sequence consisting of an extended raid on the Bin Laden lair.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 5]","WARNING: I've read all the controversy about the depiction of torture in this movie, and the indignant responses from the authorities. I'm not going to judge it on those grounds -- this is strictly artistic.A few years ago, Kathryn Bigelow made a little movie called ""The Hurt Locker"" -- a raw, grimy, unromanticized look at bomb-disposal soldiers in wartime Iraq. It made her the first woman to ever win a Best Director Academy Award.So she seems like the perfect choice for a much more epic story: the tale of how Special Ops and the CIA finally hunted down and killed Osama bin Laden. It's filmed and directed in the same hyper-realistic manner as ""Hurt Locker,"" but it's clear from the beginning that this is a story with much higher stakes, with repercussions spanning whole countries.As the story opens, a young CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) is overseeing the interrogation/torture of al Qaeda prisoners in Pakistan. She learns of a man referred to as Abu Ahmed, who is the personal courier to bin Laden -- and with fierce determination, she sets out to locate this man so she can get bin Laden through him. Even when the man is reported dead, she never wavers in her determination.Over the years that follow, Maya survives being shot at, bombed, the loss of her friend and a change in administration that may ruin her career. With the help of her friend Dan (Jason Clarke), she follows the intel to a fortress-like compound in Pakistan, where the CIA soon realizes bin Laden is hiding. As the months roll by, Maya pushes for a night raid on the compound -- and when the raid goes through, the soldiers bring the decade-long hunt to its bloody conclusion.""Zero Dark Thirty"" has its fair share of fictional characters (Maya) and scenarios (waterboarding), but to be honest, it doesn't FEEL like a movie. There are no ""stirring"" moments, no melodramatics, no rousing speeches, no swell of an orchestra when something important happens. When the final raid on the compound finally happens, it's not a bombastic action sequence, but a slow-moving affair punctuated by blasts of gunfire and the screams of children.Instead, it feels more like you're trailing after the CIA agents and soldiers, through the sun-drenched, dusty Middle-Eastern cities. Most of the story simply follows Maya as she chases clues, rumors and phone numbers, and it takes her YEARS to actually get some decent results.Nothing happens fast. Time rolls by slowly, full of slow progress and frustrating setbacks -- just look at the scenes where a furious Maya scribbles numbers on her boss's window. For most directors, this slow pace and attention to realistic detail would probably end up being boring, but the sudden violent attacks by al Qaeda -- leaving innocent people dead, bloody and screaming -- reminds you WHY the characters have been chasing bin Laden for so long.Unfortunately, some of the dialogue is hokey. Exhibit A: ""What part convinced you?"" ""Her confidence."" That is some cheezy blockbuster dialogue, and does not fit in a movie filmed in such a realistic style.But despite that drawback, Bigelow draws quietly intense performances from all the actors, particularly Jessica Chastain. Apparently Maya isn't based on anyone in particular -- she's just a sort of generic CIA woman, but the ethereal-looking Chastain gives her an iron skin and flinty eyes. Her armor doesn't crack until her mission is over.And there are a lot of great performances by the rest of the cast. Clarke gives an unflinching performance as a cold, jaded soldier who regains some of his fire due to Maya's determination, along with Reda Kateb, Harold Perrineau, Kyle Chandler, and especially the underrated Jennifer Ehle as a bright-eyed, equally determined friend of Maya's.""Zero Dark Thirty"" is one of those movies that can almost convince you it's real, despite the chunks of hokey dialogue.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","""Zero Dark 30"" is an account of the CIA's decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden, culminating in the raid on his compound in Pakistan. Jessica Chastain portrays Maya, a red-haired beauty who initially appears fragile and vulnerable. As time passes, she toughens up, uses four-letter words liberally, and spits out her opinions when she is angry (which is often). Maya is obsessed with locating and killing Bin Laden, whom she calls UBL. She and her colleagues follow up every lead, no matter how flimsy, since even a courier could be the key to discovering UBL's hiding place.Kathryn Bigelow has garnered a great deal of criticism in the wake of this movie's release. First, there are the infamous scenes in which CIA operatives transport detainees to ""black sites,"" where the captors beat their prisoners repeatedly; deprive them of sleep, food, and drink; pour water over their faces to simulate the feeling of being drowned; and string them up by their wrists. Bigelow asserts that she does not personally endorse torture as a means of obtaining information. Furthermore, she insists that although the movie is based on actual events, she uses artistic license to tell her story.Is ""Zero Dark Thirty"" worth seeing? Yes, for a number of reasons, including the edgy screenplay by Mark Boal, Greg Fraser's superb cinematography, Jeremy Hindle's impressive production design, and Alexandre Desplat's evocative score. Bigelow's direction is gutsy, fast-paced, and powerful. There are no opening credits, just a dark screen with the sounds of 9/11 assaulting our senses. She then segues to the infamous and grisly torture sequences, but leaves it to us to decide whether such extreme interrogation methods can ever be morally justified.Jessica Chastain shines as a brittle and hot-tempered individual who, as far as we know, has no friends, family, or outside interests to distract her from her grim and difficult task. Jason Clarke, another CIA operative, taunts and torments detainees, but is smart enough to realize that he harms himself by engaging in such tactics. Reda Kateb is excellent as a stubborn captive who does his best to withstand degradation and pain in his determination to protect his secrets. James Gandolfini is fierce and savvy as former CIA director Leon Panetta; he demands proof of Osama bin Ladin's whereabouts, and is not content with probabilities and suppositions. Kyle Chandler, Maya's stressed-out boss, knows that he will take the fall if things go belly-up.This provocative film demonstrates how difficult it is to glean solid intelligence concerning potential terror attacks. Monitoring emails and telephone calls; following the wire transfers of known jihadists who need a steady supply of funds; and conducting video surveillance to monitor the movements of people of interest may yield useful data.

The movie makes that point clear, but goes out of its way to avoid answering the question. In the film, she is bright and tenacious without being portrayed as a savant.

1620081,A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B00AZNEW5G,Eugene Suh,"[0, 1]","This film was okay; not good, not bad, just mediocre. The first quarter starts off with an anti-ordinary scene (normally seen in Hollywood dramas about terrorism) during which the CIA interrogates and tortures, as well as kindly feeds, a &#34;terrorist&#34; (he's kindly given a cigarette after his meal). &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; is similar to all of M. Knight Shyalaman's movies because they both were slow with dragged-through-the-mud drama that bored me, although the &#34;suspenseful&#34; moments of explosions did wake me up. This film is not what you normally expect and see in Hollywood &#34;terrorist&#34; movies. What was interesting about the way the story was told was the process the main character, Maya, goes through (as well as the other CIA agents) about the agonizing, slow, but purposeful hunt for &#34;UBL&#34;. It doesn't shoot like a typical Hollywood movie (e.g. &#34;True Lies&#34;), but rather takes its time (take too much time) in developing the story and &#34;chase&#34; for the main terrorist. However, there were many negatives about this film that made many film critics question its Oscar worthiness. For example, when Maya leaves a compound in her car, she is confronted by terrorists who calmly start shooting at her vehicle. How does Maya react? She just ducks in her car without screaming or driving away and panicking (like a normal person would do) for several seconds until she finally puts the car in reverse and returns safely to the compound. That's not reality. Another negative is the way the closing scenes were filmed and shot (i.e. camera angles and lighting) when the military invades &#34;UBL's&#34; fortress. The way the scenes are black is understandable (afterall, it is night time), but rather bothersome and disorienting. What would have been better is if the scenes were shot in first-person point-of-view (i.e. from the viewpoint of any one of the military personnel that were part of the &#34;UBL&#34; fortress invasion and kill (i.e. in &#34;night vision&#34; mode) to make the scenes watchable and so we, the viewers, know what the hell is going on.Anyway, the fact that this film was nominated and won some Hollywood awards is quite ludicrous. If you're interested in watching a better film, watch &#34;Battle for Haditha&#34;, which was more dramatic, disturbing, emotional, and graphic. Note: Just because a movie does not get nominated for a stereotypical Hollywood award and/or does not have popular/famous actors, actresses, directors, and producers, does not mean it's not worth seeing or is not a good movie (case in point, &#34;Battle for Haditha&#34;).

And I didn't expect it to be basically irrelevant to the actual plot. The amount of violence in this movie seemed over the top to me. I know terrorist interrogations are not a Sunday School picnic, and I know the CIA and SEALS are not boy scouts on a walk in the woods. But I felt worn down by the constant violence. The actual discovery of where bin Laden was hiding was obscured by the over-emphasis on interrogating people who knew little or nothing.This movie raises more questions than it answers. Sitting in the audience, I saw and heard and felt a helicopter crash and numerous explosions as the team invaded the compound--but bin Laden himself was apparently in a coma or something, because he never even picked up the gun he kept over his bed. The lack of any defense at a compound hiding the man who supposedly killed thousands of people, his failure to make any move to protect his wife and kids, strains belief. But by the time you get to that, you have been bludgeoned into submission by a constant stream of torture and explosions and gunfire.The writer and director made many odd choices here. The acting was good, but the choices of what to show and what to leave out were peculiar. Much more attention to threads that led nowhere, and very little understanding of how they actually found bin Laden.

However---it does imply that torture Was a successful way of acquiring information in the 'war on terror.'  That may not be evident at first.  But it's true.  It does suggest that one person who is willing to sacrifice Everything in her life for a single end can make a difference----at terrible emotional and personal sacrifice to herself ---that point is only settled towards the very end of the movie.  The movie abstracts from the question of the network and network of networks of 'terrorists' who were left alive after the successful raid against Bin Laden.  And it abstracts from any question involving Bin Laden's links to Afghanee operations against the Soviets; and of his connection to and hatred of the Saudis and his family in Saudi Arabia; and of his displacement of this hatred towards the United States; it abstracts too from the fact that the United States had him 'cornered' near the Pakhistani border (but turned the operation over to the Afghanees---guaranteeing his escape (note: that was to have been the theme of an earlier project by the director and script writer of this film abandoned after the successful raid set forth in this film).

1620096,AOKS5JEGN6G,B00AZNEW5G,genocidal_maniac,"[0, 1]","I should have liked this movie. I have enjoyed many movies in this new &#34;War of Terror&#34; genre that American filmmaking has opened up post-9/11. The success of 24 (okay, more a TV series) was kind of the origin of this genre, United 93 was simply one of the most gripping movies I&#34;ve ever seen, period, Steven Spielberg's Munich was also very good, and the director of this movie, Kathryn Bigelowe, previously worked on the excellent Hurt Locker.There have also been some duds. Green Zone was a pretty big dud in my book. A shame, since it was made by the same team who made the very gripping United 93.And add this movie to the dud list.Off the bat, my biggest problem was that I knew what happened. There is never any doubt as to the final outcome. We know that Bin Laden was killed in a raid by Navy Seals. Beyond that though, many of the fundamental resting points of the plot I knew the outcome already. For instance, in one pivotal (SPOILER) scene, the CIA thinks that it had turned a Bin Laden lieutenant to their side. The guy arrives in the base, and blows them up with a bomb. It is a big betrayal, which was supposed to be a down &#34;all hope is lost&#34; moment in the movie. Except, I already knew that had happened, so I knew that he was a bomber. It was in the New York Times and I remember reading the article myself.(/SPOILER).You could argue the same applies for United 93. Yet, at least for me, United 93 was far more gripping, even though I knew the outcome, because --1. I was not overly familiar with the events of 9/11. I had no reason to. I, and most educated viewers, are likely broadly aware of the outline of the War on Terror. This film relies on several pivots of the actual War on Terror to alter the mood of the film. But these pivots are not a surprise if you've kept up with the news.2. United 93 was a loss. There is an underdog in the movie, and it is the passengers of the civilian plane. In this movie, you have the intelligence unit of the world's most powerful military, with the greatest killing power ever known on Earth at her disposal. Zero Dark Thirty is about an Empire swatting flies, not ordinary people struggling in an event wildly out of their control.On that note, Zero Dark Thirty is also inferior to Hurt Locker for precisely that reason. Hurt Locker was about the grunts on the ground. This movie is about a jet-setting bureaucrat. Sure, she sweats and frets in her office, and occasionally a terrorist gets close to her, broadly, but, she spends most of the time in a secure office, with the tools of a global-spanning empire at her disposal, not in the dangerous field. Stakes are higher when at stake is your actual arms and legs, not an Imperial abstraction. Hurt Locker did an especially good job of throwing the viewer off with an (SPOILER) early death (/SPOILER), and more broadly Hurt Locker succeeded because the drama of the film centered around a group of people who we know performed a very risky job, whose universe is small enough that the final outcome is in doubt. There is doubt that the heroes in Hurt Locker will survive because we know for a fact that men who served in Iraq suffered many casualties. The final outcome of Hurt Locker is a mystery. The final outcome of Zero Dark Thirty was blasted on the news several years ago, and was a big deal.So, it was a bore. I did not really feel for the protagonist.

I have seen six of the nominated films--no interest in seeing Amour, Silver Linings Playbook or Beasts of the Southern Wild--and the only ones of those two that I thought were any good were Argo and Django Unchained.  Zero Dark Thirty, is my most recent viewing of a Best Picture nominee, and needless to say, Act of Valor was a much superior film in every way (and that is no insult to AoV either, since it is a much better film that what most people give it credit for).And to quickly establish myself here, I am quite fond of Kathryn Bigelow as a filmmaker.  Point Break remains one of my favorite films of 1991, and one of my favorite films to star either Keanu Reeves or Patrick Swayze.  And The Hurt Locker was most certainly one of the three or so best films of 2008, and one of the four better choices to select for Best Picture in 2009, along with Inglourious Basterds, A Serious Man, and Up in the Air.  So, after I heard that Kathryn Bigelow wasn't going to try to connect any dots to our current occupent as a means of praising him for the death of Osama Bin Laden, I was willing to give this one a shot.And boy, is this film a letdown.  Jessica Chastain does a great job playing static and robotic, without much of a character beyond her career-long obsession with finding and killing Osama Bin Laden.  Understandably, Bigelow directed her to play it subtle to the enth degree.  But as a consequence, she is boring.  The film is over 150 minutes long.  The history behind the manhunt as it was retold to us is astronomically uninteresting.  Whereas a film like A King's Speech benefited from the lack of information on what really happened during King George's therapy sessions, this film clearly didn't have the classified intel critics were going ape$#!+ over, and did very little to nothing to help matters much.  The hunt lasted for about 10 years or so.  We heard very little of went on behind the scenes if anything at all.  And there was literally nothing Bigelow had done to try to make it exciting, intense, or interesting.  Well, until the very end when she finally tracks down where he is hiding and sends some soldiers down there to find and execute him.It's a boring 2 hour exercise with an interesting beginning and a thrilling ending.  So much could have been trimmed because the film as a whole just doesn't work.  But out of respect on the film's strongest assets, I'm willing to give this film a 4 out of 10.

1620113,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AZNEW5G,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Controversy is the main reason this film garnered so much attention in and out of the theaters. Controversy and curiosity and a degree of voyeurism. It probably is important that ZERO DARK THRITY was made: the film does help assuage the anxiety that tore through this country following the infamous 9/11 and subsequent acts of terrorism and if it helps bring closure to that decade of fear and loathing that intervened before the ultimate capture and killing of Osama bin Laden then it is worth placing before the public. By definition, the movie is 'a chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.'Many aspects of the action that takes place through this nearly three hour long film is unexplained: the meaning of the title of the film we can look up as `""ZERO DARK THIRTY is a military term for thirty minutes after midnight - as well as code for ""under the cover of darkness."" It is also the time that the Navy Seals helicopters took to the skies on their mission to eliminate the world's most wanted man [Osama bin Laden]. Finally, it serves as a metaphor for the decade long, relentless pursuit of Osama bin Laden"". Mark Boal wrote the screenplay for director Kathryn Bigelow and together they condensed activity of 10 years well. The cast is uniformly fine (it is interesting that very few critics singled out the astonishingly credible performance of Reda Kateb as Ammar, the brutally tortured focal point of the film's interrogation techniques) and of course Jessica Chastain manages to make us understand the obsession of Maya as the almost solitary person who insisted on finding and killing bin Laden. She plays the CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September 2001. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden: only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.The others in the cast are also excellent - Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong, Jennifer Ehle, Harold Perrineau, Mark Strong, James Gandolfini, Stephen Dillane, Joel Edgerton et al - but the problem this viewer has with the film is that the characters never become identifiable people and remain tropes. Another problem with the On Demand version and the DVD is that on a small screen the dialogue I so covered with extraneous noise and overlapping of lines that subtitles become necessary - and they don't function! The film is far too long (acknowledging that part of the director's intent was to show how LONG 10 years of hunting was) and it is only in the last hour that the movie `catches fire' and hold our attention.  Time will likely allow us to know if people who watch this confusing and interminable study of the decade of pursuit will understand it. The film does place before our eyes some of the uglier aspects of war (on both sides) and it is well to be reminded of that aspect of our endless unwelcome presence in the Middle East.

Some torture at the beginning may be the most interesting part; the raid at the end is mostly in too much darkness. The rest:  investigation, investigation, investigation, punctuated by a couple of explosions.The heroine, Maya, becomes insufferable. Yes, she's obsessed with finding ""UBL"". But she becomes horribly arrogant, telling the SEAL team ""You're going to kill him for me."" It's one thing to make her a bad-a**; here they overreached. After that line, I couldn't take her seriously anymore, and I didn't care about her character. Except for finding her contemptible. Near the last third of the movie she is put on such a high pedestal and praised so much - super smart, super confident, etc. etc., it's frankly quite nauseating.In another part we are treated to watching a Pollyanna-ish agent (different woman - are there really that many women in the interrogative services?) getting giddy about meeting and interviewing a potential lead, terribly endangering the people around her by insisting on relaxing security measures. Some tragedies ... are avoidable.It is interesting watching them track the cell phone user who leads them to UBL, near the end. But the raid, as I said, is botched - it's usually too dark to see what's happening, except for the night vision parts. I tried different settings on my TV, and it didn't help much.And they didn't show UBL using his wife as a human shield. A strange omission.Speaking of omissions, one character says that ""the President is a thoughtful, analytical man."" So thoughtful, in fact, that he took 13 or so hours to decide to give the go ahead, and then only after he had crafted a document to sign that absolved himself of all blame in case anything went wrong. (The blame would fall upon the military.) They left that part out. Strange.I will probably be selling my copy. Maybe that's why Amazon's not letting us sell them yet? (Like Argo.)

1620125,A3GLALCBHOR3T,B00AZNEW5G,Harry Georgatos,"[1, 1]","From a filmmaking POV ZERO DARK THIRTY and THE HURT LOCKER are crafted by a genuine filmmaker who brings a documentary type narrative to a highly controversial film that is ZDT. The film starts off with a highly disturbing interogation/torture scene that goes on for a lenghty time in finding crucial intell to the whereabouts of highly placed terrorists. One might say after 9/11 America's moral compass had become warped when it came to finding leads in the whereabouts of terrorists and potential terrorists. As for me I've always believed torture had been sanctioned throughout American history in the fight during the Cold War and Vietnam to the present day. The USA might say it doesn't sanction torture but any self-respecting and educated person can see through such lies.Getting back to ZDT the film has an absolute air of authenticity in the manner that the film is put together;through it's realistic cinematography and the fact-like manner that the script is written.Jessica Chastain is the child of post-9/11 and it has become her sole obsession in finding Bin Laden. Her performance is the heart and soul of the film and the perfect actress for audiences to relate with and go on this disturbing journey of suicide bombers, IED bombers and fanatic terrorists who would not stop at nothing to see the deaths of Americans and innocent civilians.As for conspiracy theorists one might say why Bin Laden did not have underground tunnels to make a quick getaway? Since no one has seen his body or any photo's for that matter ( photo's in todays digital age can be easily manipulated and have little credibility)sceptics would say it was a propaganda ploy for the USA and West to move onto other parts of the world and give people their catharsis in the death of Bin Laden.As for the film ZDT from a filmmaking aspect should have won best picture then ARGO. ARGO is a feel good movie and sat well with the Academy.

The actress playing the CIA agent holds the entire movie together and does a superb job.  The fact that a woman is the central protagonist in a violent movie, makes for interesting takes on the drama and feminism -  there's no off-duty whooping-up, letting off steam, at most there's a dinner with colleagues (which ends in an explosion), the scene at the end where the pilot asks `where are you headed', I presume was meant to be a question about the USA, but I came away thinking `will she be able to settle down and have a family' (sorry).There has been a lot of comment about the torture scenes, I think the film is pretty clear that the intelligence picture of Bin Laden's associates was gained by torture, and that the torture itself involved physical and psychological elements.  It looked pretty brutal to me, though its impact on the torturers seemed underplayed - surely it depraves both the victim and the inflictors?  If anything the torture sessions seemed to have been tamer versions of reality - there are some similar, though more graphic descriptions from a recent book by Stuart Couch called The Terror Courts: Rough Justice at Guantanamo Bay.I thoughts some parts of the script were a bit weak - why does the central character have to swear when she is at her first meeting with the CIA director and others after having found the safe house?  Is it really credible that the CIA would have to bribe a Kuwaiti with a sportscar, to get a telephone number?  On this one, I presumed it was too crazy not to have been true.Why does the CIA director find her in the canteen and ask her what else she has done for the CIA? When she replies `nothing', he says `you are very good at that'.  What is this about?  Is he trying to undermine her analysis ?.  It seems like a worms-eye view.  I can't see Leon Panetta doing that.  Still it was good to see Tony Soprano again, though I'm worried about his weight.These, however, are just quibbles.  The movie was excellent, the pace was terrific, the plot was very tense, the main character (on the whole) was very credible.  I would watch this again.I left the cinema thinking that we know this story so well, and its so controversial that I wouldn't be surprised if its an elaborate hoax, that Bin Laden might have been betrayed by some members of Saudi Intelligence or his extended family (a number of his wives were in the house) and that this is a cover story which protects them from retaliation.

1620143,AMG88KV31ZIIO,B00AZNEW5G,Jack Crane,"[7, 45]","Kathryn Bigelow should never make another movie again. She is awful. It's sad that she is so well-connected in Hollywood enough to get nominated for garbage that she directs. Zero Dark Thirty was an awful movie. First of all, it was boring. I was psyched to watch this movie. I like war movies, and I felt that this couldn't miss. It's all about finding Osama. How can you screw that up? I was wrong. This film was self-indulgent. There was no flow to the story line. It's a bunch of mundane scenes, one after the other, with a very bored, uncharacteristically mediocre performance from Jessica Chastain. Her character, Maya, strikes you as a very disturbed individual. She appears to have never even taken a class on Middle Eastern Studies in college. The portrayal of her character is very one-dimensional, and she comes off as a very strange individual. Her motivation to catch Osama is never genuine. She comes off as being brainwashed. You would think someone that works for the CIA would be depicted as a bit more educated and aware of the political issues in the Middle East. Nope, she's a self-indulgent, narcissistic drone. I mean, if this truly was reality, make the character more sympathetic to audiences!!! The way she was depicted turns the audience against her, hard to imagine, as an American myself.Many had issue with the torture scenes. Yes, it was strange. Was it pro-torture? Who knows. Was it awkward? Very. Just not well-integrated into the film.The final raid, well, I truly hope that was not accurate. It was like watching storm troopers in action, killing anything that moved. If this truly did happen, Bigelow should have Hollywoodized it, because it just did not look good, especially the scene in which the unarmed wife came to the aid of her fallen husband and was shot. Wow. Several more unarmed men were shot in the raid, almost like they were hunted. I understand, this was a military mission, but much of it just looked bad on film. It makes American soldiers look like monsters. Was this the intention? From what I read of the operation, there were justified reasons for their actions, but in the film, it looked like something else.On its own merits, this was just a bad movie. It was probably rushed to get the film out to theaters instead of doing a proper job. Furthermore, Kathryn Bigelow is a mediocre director, confirmed. She stinks. She has no talent whatsoever when it comes to making movies. Oh, she's been nominated for Oscars and won? Who cares, the show has no credibility anymore. The Academy routinely ignores excellent action movies and actors. Gary Oldman, anyone? Hillary Swank, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Adrien Brody, Jeff Bridges, Sean Penn, Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx, even Nicholas Cage, have won Oscars while he has been snubbed repeatedly.

1620146,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00AZNEW5G,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","With time the film has become a lot less pungent and pregnant than it was when it came out. It is nothing but a fiction documentary on an essential event of the beginning of the 21st century. There was September 11, 2001 before and now there is May 2, 2011. The ten years during which terrorism seemed to be dominating the world and the USA to be running after an uncatchable ghost, will remain the ten years during which the West ran after its own tail like a deranged dog.And Osama Ben laden was a ghost. He had managed to be ever present everywhere and to be untraceable at all in any way imaginable. No telephone link. No Internet connection; No going out of his fortress at all. A fortress well hidden right in the middle of an urban area in Pakistan, 585 feet or so from the main Pakistani military academy, their West Point. To be unseen hide in a crowd. To be invisible hide in a fortress that stands out on its surrounding neighborhood and protect it in the most standard way so that everyone may think it is the residence of a drug lord. And it would have worked if there had not been one girl who was crazy enough to believe what her reason and deduction told her with certainty though she had no material proof of the presence of her target.She was a subductive mind who built a conviction from a pile of circumstantial and partial facts and subductive she had to be to subdue all the males around her in the secret service, CIA, armed forces and other agencies of the type, subdue indeed, if not abduct their rational mind for a trip onto the other side of visible reality, the invisible side of reality. To believe is at times enough.But the film was a very scandalous film when it came out because of the torture used to get some information. The case was abducted out of reasonable behavior and intelligence. First the only TV skimpy appearance of Obama was when he declared he would put an end to torture. All the torture took place in the film before that declaration. That's an ellipse, my dear film viewers, meaning that Obama put a stop to torture. Then the film even shows how a ""tip"" was in fact a trap that led a loaded car into a military base in Afghanistan and it exploded killing many, including some CIA agents who were so happy to have invited someone in the base who was going to tell them where Ben Laden was and all that with the torture of greed, for 25 million dollars. Idiotic. Money is a very good bait for suicide bombers.So torture did not give them a lot. And money did not give them a lot. It is only crossing and crisscrossing intelligence from many sources that led to a track, a trail, a path to the man they were looking for. Nothing replaces intelligence, and I should say a vast diversity of intelligence. Nothing is better than human intelligence, I mean intellectual work, to build a conviction from a mass of data that seems to have no logic at all. No machine could reach that conviction because a machine would work on probabilities, and let me say subduction, the truth emerging from the deeper layers of the accumulated data, is irrational, illogical, absurd in many ways. That's how Homo Sapiens invented God. Today we use it in science all the time.As for the unethical side of torture, it is a very bad argument. Of course it is unethical but Guantanamo will only close when the last prisoner there dies provided they don't bring any anymore. Guantanamo nevertheless worked and works very well because of the reputation it has, the myth about it and the legend about the methods used there. Of course it is unethical but with terrorists fear is the best incentive to try anything to defy that fear, to defy reason and prudence and to get caught.Torture is ineffective as for the intelligence it brings out but it is unluckily effective in the fear it creates in some people on the wrong side of the divide of humaneness because then they get reckless, sloppy, careless and even talkative. In fact real torture is not necessary. Just a public reputation about it is enough to reach its target. And yet real torture in inhuman and unethical.But once again the manhunt of the first decade of the 21st century was constructed on real intelligence obtained through intelligent collecting and not fake intelligence obtained through torture. Was torture actually used or not? Who knows really. We can trust the perversion of some intelligence gatherers for them to turn themselves into torture-masters. But these are probably the little ones on the chain, particularly if we are speaking of physical torture. And it takes a woman to know that a woman witness to a torturing session is a lot more effective on the man who is being tortured than the torture itself because the presence of a woman becomes psychological torture that is untenable for real Islamic people from the Arab or Middle-East world. To be stripped naked in front of a woman is the worst psychological and moral torture you can invent in that situation.Christians on the other hand are used to the quasi-naked Christ tortured to death on his cross and Jesus did not wince at the presence of his own mother and Mary Magdalena at the foot of the cross, and a third Mary, at least in the conscience of Christians who even believe Jesus presented John as being her son now, directly from the cross.Torture is not what you may think it is. I am just surprised this film essentially shows physical torture and body pain caused by violence. I am sure the locking up of one torture victim in a box was a lot more effective though it was not hurting the body at all. But the mind...!!!This film has to be seen and known as a fiction documentary on an important event of our time.Dr Jacques COULARTDEAU",5,Torture is not what the critics and whistle blowers have

1620148,A168U519Q8TKZC,B00AZNEW5G,James B. Casey,"[4, 8]","This is one of the great movies of all time for some of the same reasons that LINCOLN received so much acclaim.  Nevertheless, dirty deal-making and bribery that were employed to pass the 13th Amendment in a severely divided House in 1865 must seem relatively tame compared to the depiction of nauseating and disgraceful acts of torture and humiliation inflicted on prisoners in efforts to extact information concerning the location of Bin Laden.  This movie is unappologetic in its quest for realism and detail.  However disturbing it is -- and it really is disturbing in many ways -- the search for Bin Laden and for some measure of justice or closure following the dreadful crimes of 911 is as much a part of the history of our own time as was the final, legal destruction of Slavery in 1865 for those who suffered through the Civil War.The acting was first rate as was the depiction of the assault on Bin Laden's compound.  While Maya and the leading specialists in the operation were given prime focus in this movie, it is also clear that the effort required the skill and intensely hard work by many individuals as well as a good measure of luck. One can empathize with the frantic and seemingly unhinged Maya as she scrawls numbers on the office wall of her CIA boss  ---  29, 51, 100, 129 etc. --- depicting the number of days after she unveiled the location of what she is utterly convinced is the hiding place of Osama Bin Laden before action was finally taken.You will want to buy the dvd and re-watch certain sequences as the complex and difficult process may not be easy to absorb in one viewing.",5,"Gritty, Authentic and Memorable",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1609,"['one', 'great', 'movies', 'time', 'same', 'reasons', 'LINCOLN', 'received', 'so', 'much', 'acclaim', 'Nevertheless', 'dirty', 'deal-making', 'bribery', 'were', 'employed', 'pass', '13th', 'Amendment', 'severely', 'divided', 'House', '1865', 'must', 'seem', 'relatively', 'tame', 'compared', 'depiction', 'nauseating', 'disgraceful', 'acts', 'torture', 'humiliation', 'inflicted', 'prisoners', 'efforts', 'extact', 'information', 'concerning', 'location', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'movie', 'unappologetic', 'quest', 'realism', 'detail', 'However', 'disturbing', 'really', 'disturbing', 'many', 'ways', 'search', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'measure', 'justice', 'closure', 'following', 'dreadful', 'crimes', '911', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'history', 'own', 'time', 'was', 'final', 'legal', 'destruction', 'Slavery', '1865', 'who', 'suffered', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'depiction', 'assault', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'compound', 'Maya', 'leading', 'specialists', 'operation', 'were', 'given', 'prime', 'focus', 'movie', 'also', 'clear', 'effort', 'required', 'skill', 'intensely', 'hard', 'work', 'many', 'individuals', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'measure', 'luck', 'One', 'can', 'empathize', 'frantic', 'seemingly', 'unhinged', 'Maya', 'numbers', 'office', 'wall', 'CIA', 'boss', '29', '51', '100', '129', 'etc', 'depicting', 'number', 'days', 'unveiled', 'location', 'what', 'utterly', 'convinced', 'hiding', 'place', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'action', 'was', 'finally', 'taken.You', 'will', 'want', 'buy', 'dvd', 're-watch', 'certain', 'sequences', 'complex', 'difficult', 'process', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'absorb', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

1620151,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00AZNEW5G,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[9, 15]","It's hard for most of the current world to think about the major events that took place during the course of their lives without thinking about September 11th, 2001. It was a day that marked a turning point for the whole world and the way they thought about their enemies. There was no declaration of war; there was no indication that there would be an attack, and perhaps most importantly, there was no one specific country that the world could point to say, ""This is our enemy"". This is part of what Kathryn Bigelow's ZERO DARK THIRTY is all about; it's about a quest of epic proportions to find the one man the world knows is responsible for that horrific attack, but it's a man who is hidden from the world with no real country to call his own and a seemingly endless hidden network that could and did strike at any time all over the world.This quest is given a human face in the personage of Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA case officer who has been working on one assignment since her beginnings at the Agency: Finding and killing Usama Bin Laden. Her quest begins in 2003 in the Middle East at one of the CIA's many ""black sites"", a series of undisclosed locations where terror suspects are held in secret for interrogation. The chief officer for many of the interrogations is Dan (Jason Clarke), a man whose scruffy exterior belies a cool, centered intelligence and a man who finds himself with the very unpleasant job of applying whatever pressure is necessary to get the information he needs. Throughout the first act of the film, there are incredibly unsettling scenes of what the Administration of the time so successfully rebranded as ""enhanced interrogation"", but some bits and pieces of information begin to form a pattern for Maya which brings us into the second act of the film, which is largely the pursuit of these leads and pulling on each possible thread until it comes undone to reveal the last pieces of the puzzle. The third act then gives us the fateful day that the authorization came down to utilize Seal Team Six to assault the compound in Pakistan that UBL had been hiding in.It is an incredibly hard thing to craft a suspenseful and non-melodramatic film around one of the most important moments of the last few years, and make it an incredibly tense, vital, and unromanticized film, but Bigelow and writer Mark Boal (the same team that gave us THE HURT LOCKER, the deserving winner of Best Picture at the 2009 Academy Awards) give us a film that throws the audience and its protagonists all around the world as the pursuit intensifies, then seems to fall apart, but then picks right back up. As the film opens, we see that this film is based on ""first-hand"" accounts of the incidents portrayed within, and you get the feeling right from the outset that what you're seeing on-screen not just looks, but feels totally authentic.Behind the camera, Bigelow gives again a very documentarian approach that worked so incredibly well in THE HURT LOCKER and also works well telling the story of Maya, and only really shifting points of view when major events take place. It never strays away from her story, but it allows the other key players on the board to give testimony of sorts of the jobs they're doing, whether it's awaiting the arrival of a key informant, to the tracking of one cell phone in a crowded marketplace, to the assault on the compound itself. The camera movement is jerky at times, but only in service of the story its telling. The rhythm of the editing by William Goldenberg and Dylan Tichenor works in total concert with the visual story that Bigelow is telling. Boal's writing is crisp, sharp and smart with a real ear for dialogue and interaction.This is a much more sprawling tale than THE HURT LOCKER as we get numerous characters in a number of different duties, and a who's-who of terrific character actors in these many roles: Jennifer Ehle (CONTAGION, THE KING'S SPEECH) as fellow case worker Jessica, Kyle Chandler (the TV FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) as a section chief, Mark Strong (SHERLOCK HOLMES, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) as one of Maya's superiors, Edgar Ramirez (the TV Mini-Series CARLOS) as an on-the-ground CIA operative, James Gandolfini as the director of the CIA, Stephen Dillane (SPY GAME, GAME OF THRONES) as the National Security Advisor, Joel Edgerton (WARRIOR) as ST6's lead, and even Harold Perrineau Jr. (LOST, THE MATRIX RELOADED), Mark Duplass (SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED) and John Barrowman (TORCHWOOD) in small but important roles. When all is said and done, however, the film is owned by Jessica Chastain. Her portrayal of Maya as someone who is confident and assured of her abilites and her intelligence, but often seems to be made to feel out of place in a political and covert world of powerful men. Her mostly unshaken faith in her mission, the intelligence she's received by hook and by crook, and the personal losses she's suffered at the hands of Al-Qaeda, is what drives her to an obsessive need to complete the mission. One of Chastain's strengths as an actress is that she's able to say so much by saying so little. This is a role of disappearence; while she may sport her beautiful firey red hair, she's unrecognizable and unconnectable to any of her previous work. It's a very non-showy performance and is the main reason that it works so incredibly well. Boal could have added more dramatic embellishments to her character by giving her more of a life outside the walls of the intelligence community that fall into the standard dramatic traps (Is she obsessed because she lost someone in 9/11? What's her home life like? Does she have a high-functioning autism? Does she fall for one of her co-workers? The list goes on and on), but thankfully, very little about her is revealed. We only learn about her through her words and deeds, and it's an astonishing performance. I remember predicting after her work on THE TREE OF LIFE that she was a woman who would have an Oscar before the decade was out, and it seems like it's going to come a lot sooner. Her final moment is absolutely devastating without being showy.The film is long, and it has a lot of information to digest. One major criticism I've seen of this film time and again is how ""boring"" it is and for the life of me, I can't understand that point of view. This is not your standard ""manhunt"" film. There is no ticking clock; there's no ace operative who takes it all down single-handedly; there's no ham-fisted attempt to amplify the natural drama of the material by dumbing it down to fit with a more conventional thriller. But even without those traditional Hollywood flourishes, this is an incredibly exciting and tension-packed film because despite knowing what's coming, unless you have times and dates committed to memory, you never really know what's going to happen. But even if you might find the first two acts dull, you cannot deny the final act of the assault on the compound which is, for all intents and purposes, a blow-by-blow recreation of that night, and it's stunning, heart-stopping, and brilliantly staged.ZERO DARK THIRTY is not the end-zone dance that so many expected from a political point of view, and from a cinematic point of view, it might not be as well-rounded as THE HURT LOCKER, but this is an important, vital and exceptionally well-made film that deserves to be at the top of accolades for 2012's year in film.",5,"A Cinematic Powerhouse,

1620153,A3JT3NRIAQONA4,B00AZNEW5G,James,"[0, 1]","After this movie and The Hurt Locker, I'm having a hard time getting my mind wrapped around why Bigelow gets under my skin (that's a compliment) with her no-nonsense approach.  My best guess is that it's her use of restraint.She's documentary-style, but restrains herself from shaking the crap out of the camera.  She shows violence matter-of-factly, sometimes in-your-face, but restrains herself from sensationalizing it.  She builds suspense, but she doesn't compromise a certain calmness and naturalness to do so.  Her sparse use of music (less sparse here than in Hurt Locker, but still the opposite end of the spectrum from, say, The Dark Knight Rises' bombastic score) and emotion are effective, too.  In short, there are tons of quiet choices that impress me, places where I so expected her to milk something for all it was worth but she never did.  And yet she didn't use quiet in that super-jarring way that keeps any rhythm from forming.  You see, it's really hard for me to figure out what she's doing that I like so much, but this has been as close as I've gotten.I think maybe she's borrowed (another compliment) some style points from Soderbergh, but definitely has her own voice. I'm really glad she's making films.  I don't think she's an absolute master yet (as in top 25 director of all time), but boy did she come close with this one.  I think her film beat Argo all to hell, and I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck's directing, too.I did think there was a spot in the middle where my concentration was tested by the pacing, but I can't give it less than 5 stars just because the strong parts were so very strong.

The first airplane hi-jacked, American Airlines Flight 11, with passengers aboard, by force hit into the North Tower of The World Trade Center in New York City at 8:46am. 17 minutes later, the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, hit into the South Tower. Then 34 minutes later, the very low-flying American Airlines Flight 77, hit directly into The Pentagon. Within the next 26 minutes, the fourth hi-jacked airplane, United Airlines Flight 93, had some of the most bravest passengers aboard who were trying to take over the hi-jackers. The passengers sacrificed there lives and had the plane crash in Pennsylvania. The hi-jackers wanted the plane to hit the U.S. Capitol.A fifth plane they thought was hi-jacked made contact with air-traffic controllers and landed safely in Ohio.The President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was finally captured December 13, 2003. American soldiers found him in a hole in the ground. The soldiers had passed by the hole with stuff on top of it several times. One soldier went back and removed the stuff over the hole and found Hussein inside alive. He was not shot, but taken into custody. After standing trial, he was put to death December 30, 2006.Osama bin Laden was finally located and under the order of the President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama, our troops went into this compound and quickly killed him military style, May 2, 2011. No child was harmed by the American soldiers. They were able to find OBL by following his messenger. After months of military training, our soldiers were ready and our President of the USA finally gave the word.This movie, Zero Dark Thirty, was put into pre-production and production very quickly as soon as it received the top secret information of what actually happened.

Edgerton is another Aussie.* Chris Pratt (""Money Ball"") brings his trademark genial likability to his role as part of the SEAL team. So much of their raid has them swathed in night-vision goggles and all the paraphernalia they need that they are virtually unrecognizable, but I knew his voice.* Reda Kateb (""Three Worlds"") is the operative who is subjected to water-boarding. The scene wasn't as horrific as I had feared, although I certainly wouldn't want it done to ME!* Kyle Chandler (""Super 8"") is our heroine's boss in Afghanistan. To him, she is a major pain because she doesn't know how to quit.* Jennifer Ehle (""Contagion"") is her only friend in the CIA. As a rule, Ms. Ehle speaks flawless American but one scene shocked me because there was NO attempt to disguise her British pronunciation. Hmmm.... Oh well, this was made in a rush...It's amazing how iconic a simple, three-story white building in Abbottabad, Pakistan has become. We all recognize it instantly!

1620164,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00AZNEW5G,Jean E. Pouliot,"[2, 4]","ZDT is a director Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant telling of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, starting in the sand-blown huts of various CIA dark sites and culminating in the raid on UBL's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Little is held back - depictions of torture and brutality, even the infamous practice of waterboarding - in the hunt for information about UBL's whereabouts. The section of the film that details the operation by Seal Team Six is riveting. Shot alternatively in near darkness and via night-vision goggles worn by the troops, the operation is shown second by second, with its missteps (killing the unarmed wife of a resident, the crash of one of the copters) and successes (killing bin Laden, ransacking his computers and files). But while the film depicts America's greatest success in the War on Terror, its mood is subdued -- not quite celebratory.The film's main character, Maya, a fictional female CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain (and who may represent a single person or the hundreds of analysts and agents who worked on the hunt) is a bit of a cipher. She is slight and freckled, is called a ""killer,"" and is inexplicably drawn to take down the Al Qaeda leader. Maya is hardened, or pretends to be, and unfazed by violence. But in spite of representing the desire of the American public for UBL's scalp, she's kind of hard to root for. She is taciturn, cold and driven by unknown motives. She unflinchingly watches a man beaten to provide evidence, then coolly tells him that the severity of his treatment is in his own hands. She has no backstory, though it would be easy (if clich&eacute;d) to give her one - say, that her Dad died in the Twin Towers or on Flight 93. But though the film begins with a series of desperate phone calls from 9/11, that attack seems almost beside the point to Maya -- as though her desire to take down UBL has taken on a life of its own, apart from any connection to the assault on the homeland.There are strange inklings throughout the movie that we are watching the intersection of physical reality and its underlying shadow of meaning, For instance, the search for bin Laden's courier and the raid on Abbottabad are told realistically and in detail. But the moment of UBL's death is curiously concealed, and is just-so-slightly inconsistent with written accounts. (Caution: spoilers ahead!) Two SEALS creep toward Osama's 3rd floor hideout via a narrow stairway. They hear a noise and shoot through a curtained door. When they enter, UBL is on his back, dead or nearly so, with two of his wives screaming nearby. The SEALs pump two more rounds into bin Laden to ensure his demise. An AK-47 is seen in the room, but mounted on the wall above UBL's bed, not even within arm's reach. Viewers who might want to see him die a slow and painful death - face to face with his lethal visitors, perhaps, or menacing them with an automatic weapon -- will be disappointed. His death seems anti-climactic- intricately planned and executed, to be sure -- but hardly the cinematic climax that such films promise. Does Bigelow show us what really happened? Is there a message in this her restraint at the moment of triumph? Or is she exercising poetic license to make a point? If so, what point? That exterminating this world-menacing terrorist leader was the equivalent of killing a fly with a sledgehammer?  Osama bin Laden, the most-wanted terrorist kingpin, murderer of thousands, ends up being an unarmed medieval in a robe and turban, hiding with his wives and kids in a ramshackle concrete ""fortress,"" tracked down over 10 years and the cost of how much treasure, and eliminated by the world's most disciplined, armed and technically advanced armed force of all time. If Kathryn Bigelow is trying to say something here, I can only wonder what it is.For all its realism, great writing and fine acting, ZDT is hard to applaud whole-heartedly. Maybe we have just become nuanced about our place in the world. Openly hating a militant Muslim and cheering his death is perilously close to hating everyday Muslims - our workmates and neighbors. Better not to go there. Then there's the whole speculative depiction of Operation Neptune Spear, the raid on UBL's hideout. Given the secrecy of the raid, and the reluctance of most of the participants to talk about it, we aren't completely sure what happened. We do know that Bigelow made some possibly unhistorical choices. The depictions of UBL's nasty head wound are cleaned up here. Who knows what else was doctored to make the raid more palatable? Another issue with cheering for the film is the violence and self-propelling viciousness that we are asked to accept as the means for bringing bin Laden to justice. I am not nave enough to think war and espionage are pretty. But I was unable to walk away from ZDT without a few thought about the morality of torture and ""extraordinary rendition,"" that sanitized term for sending suspects to countries where physical and mental abuse of prisoners is accepted.At the end of the film, Maya is bundled, alone, into a cargo plane. Asked where she'd like to go, she does not answer. Instead, she weeps softly. This scene brings her character closest to that of Americans reacting to the death of their number one enemy. Which is: not much at all. Whether due to war weariness or lack of confirming video, most of us did not rush into the streets when we heard the news. A decade of searching had turned UBL into a dangerous, but fairly contained evil - a devil in a glass jar. His death had little influence on those who took to heart his call for jihad against the West. As the recent Boston Marathon bombings show us, the enemies of the West do not need a living UBL to inspire them. Self-radicalization may be bin Laden's toxic legacy to the world.Why Maya's tears? Were they tears of relief at the end of a grueling, years-long effort to rid the world of an evildoer? Were they delayed tears of grief over friends who died trying to bring UBL to justice? Were they tears of lost innocence, mourning for a perhaps nonexistent time when Americans didn't torture and were not put in a position where they had to? Did the death of bin Laden, the man whose death had overtaken her entire career, leave her with a sense of lost purpose? Or did she see the death of Osama bin Laden, after so much effort and expenditure,  as insignificant in relation to her expectations? We don't know.This ambiguity - not the detailed reconstruction of bin Laden's hideout or the tactics of Seal Team 6 -- may be the film's greatest achievement, depicting events hyper-realistically, while allowing their multifaceted sorrows and joys play out in the viewer's mind long after the closing credits.",5,"Brilliant, historical and perhaps allegorical",1372809600,"07 3,

We know very little about Maya -- where she is from, what motivated her to join the CIA, and what her motivations are for doing anything really -- and what we do know does not form  a multi-dimensional character:  Maya is obsessed with finding and killing Osama bin Laden, and she's convinced she has to fight the world to get to him.  Early on in the manhunt she stumbles upon the name of bin Laden's courier, and without any proof or substantive evidence she thinks that this courier is the key to finding bin Laden.  She is ultimately vindicated, but in the process everyone around her thinks she's merely chasing a ghost and bending reality to suit her prejudice.Bigelow is a very subtle and courageous director.  She's not afraid of raising tough moral questions, and she's not afraid of testing the psychological and emotional limits of her audience.  The movie is intensely claustrophobic -- everything happens in small spaces -- so that when we are given wide angle shots we have to breathe with relief.  I suppose that close angle shots in tight narrow spaces is a hallmark of Bigelow's cinematography, but it also offers us an interior into Maya's mind -- as she must seclude herself away in Pakistan, away from friends and emotions.  There's not much violence in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" as the movie is mainly just talk and innuendo, but when it does happen it happens with great shock and effect:  the torturing of a detainee, terrorist bombings, the bullets that kill the three men in bin Laden's compound.  But the ultimate violence is inflicted by Maya on herself, as she drives herself and all those around her insane with her obsession.  The obsession becomes so integral to her identity that when she is able to stare the dead bin Laden in the face she doesn't know how to feel, and when she boards a plane by herself she doesn't know where to go, and breaks down in tears.  It's very clear from Bigelow's long close-up that these are not tears of joy -- these are real tears, tears that she had to bottle up all these years as her obsession consumed her.Like Maya herself, Bigelow is very meticulous and detail-oriented.  ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very slow, nuanced film that most viewers will find boring and aloof.

This was a gritty, realistic take on the slow, painful slog that led to the takedown of Bin Laden in Pakistan. It has a dark, forbidding atmosphere that moves slowly and painfully toward the final raid. Kathryn Bigelow has created a darkly realistic movie that looks and feels like a documentary. Unlike Argo, which is a fast paced thriller, ZDT moves slowly until the last half hour, as CIA Analyst Maya slogs through years of lost leads and bureaucratic infighting, all the while compiling bits and pieces of evidence that finally lead to Bin Laden, and the raid at the end of the film. The Navy Seal team is well portrayed, and we see their professionalism and courage as they drop in by chopper and race to get to Bin Laden before time runs out. By the time of the raid, we have almost forgotten that the success of the raid is a forgone conclusion. The final scene is riveting, realistic, and satisfying.

Dizon ""John Reinhard Dizon""","[0, 2]","Okay, I'm gonna get slammed for honking my own horn here, but it seems like I just wrote a book about something along these lines a few months ago. The first time I caught this one, it was at the fifteen-minute mark. The second time was from the beginning, and it was hard to believe I was watching a docudrama. Then again, I did know all about Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, but wasn't Barack Osama claiming he was closing all that stuff down? Of course, Obama Bin Laden does warrant an exception...but that may be what The Standard and Zero Dark Thirty have in common.The flick itself is a quality piece of work. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA agent reluctantly transferred to the Middle East after 9/11, and she is paired with expert CIA torturer Dan (Jason Clarke) to find out who knocked our lights out at the WTC. It doesn't take long for Dan to get burnt out on the job, but Maya starts following some quality leads and soon gets a laser focus on Bin Laden himself. Despite frustrating nay-saying and spineless vacillation from CIA chief Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler), she finally runs the ball straight to the White House where Bin Laden's namesake gives the Navy SEALs the go-ahead to plant Global Enemy Number One six feet under. You got to give Chandler a lot of credit here. Nailing both King Kong and UBL onscreen in the same decade is no mean feat.I suppose the soliloquy here would be about how much is too much as far as human rights goes. In The Standard, you've got Jack Gawain hacking baddies to pieces to get information in foiling a mini-nuke terrorist strike in the USA. In Zero Dark Thirty, Dan restricts himself to near-drowning the perps, ninety-six hours of sleep deprivation, and shoving them in cubicles slightly bigger than a breadbox. I mean, don't we have some kind of drugs that get these jobs done? We're all aware that sodium pentatol doesn't work well on super-geniuses like Hannibal Lecter, but that flick's almost two decades old. Street dealers have improved their products by quantum leaps in comparison. Plus we question making an exception for baddies, UBL or not.

We're all survivors of 9/11 because we all witnessed it and felt its impact in real time. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" gives you some of that real time immediacy in the assassination of Osama Bin-Laden.""Zero Dark Thirty"" starts where the hunt for Bin-Laden did with 9/11, almost. There's a black screen while we hear the final 911 phone calls of those killed, and our mind fills in the images. The movie then follows CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) as she goes on a decade long quest to find Osama Bin-Laden. She utilizes water-boarding, she loses friends to bombings, and finally tracks down Bin-Laden's whereabouts by tracking Bin-Laden's courier. Director Kathryn Bieglow (""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Point Break"") utilized government resources that were available, but like any movie that is ""based on a true story"" you have to realize that some real life characters will be condensed into one character, chronologies will be juggled for more dramatic impact, and artistic license will create scenes that may not have really happened. Despite all that, Bieglow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" breaks through the fog of war, undeclared as it was and more of an exercise in intelligence than active war, and shows the true nature of war that is ugly and reveals truths about the inhumanity we can inflict upon each other. Any movie that tells the truth about war is inherently an anti-war movie.When the Navy Seal team moves through the building that Bin-Laden is hiding in during their effort to kill him, the movie makes no real bones about that being the objective, just as it probably was in real life. As the Seals move from floor to floor it has a weird resonance back to Bruce Lee's last movie ""The Game of Death"" where each level of the building is more and more difficult and brings a greater danger. The resolution of the movie isn't very satisfying even though we know Bin-laden was killed, but the Seal team isn't sure until Maya confirms it. There's no jingoistic, flag waving ending which there could have been. The movie started with the sounds of 9/11, it could have ended with footage of people running to the White House celebrating the announcement of Bin-Laden's death. Instead, the movie shows Maya alone, without a goal in life as her raison d'etre for living for the past decade is now gone.",4,Zero Dark Thirty Cuts Through Fog of War to Reveal its Truths,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,2509,"['have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movies', '9/11', 'aftermath', 'was', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'probably', 'same', 'reason', 'survivors', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'could', ""n't"", 'talk', ""'re"", 'survivors', '9/11', 'witnessed', 'felt', 'impact', 'real', 'time', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'real', 'time', 'immediacy', 'assassination', 'Osama', 'Bin-Laden', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'where', 'hunt', 'Bin-Laden', 'did', '9/11', 'almost', 'black', 'screen', 'hear', 'final', '911', 'phone', 'calls', 'killed', 'mind', 'fills', 'images', 'movie', 'then', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Maya', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'decade', 'long', 'quest', 'find', 'Osama', 'Bin-Laden', 'utilizes', 'water-boarding', 'friends', 'bombings', 'finally', 'tracks', 'down', 'Bin-Laden', 'whereabouts', 'tracking', 'Bin-Laden', 'courier', 'Director', 'Kathryn', 'Bieglow', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Point', 'Break', 'utilized', 'government', 'resources', 'were', 'available', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'realize', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'condensed', 'one', 'character', 'chronologies', 'will', 'be', 'juggled', 'more', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'artistic', 'license', 'will', 'create', 'scenes', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'really', 'happened', 'Bieglow', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'fog', 'war', 'undeclared', 'was', 'more', 'exercise', 'intelligence', 'active', 'war', 'true', 'nature', 'war', 'ugly', 'reveals', 'truths', 'inhumanity', 'can', 'inflict', 'other', 'movie', 'truth', 'war', 'inherently', 'anti-war', 'movie.When', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'team', 'moves', 'building', 'Bin-Laden', 'hiding', 'effort', 'kill', 'movie', 'real', 'bones', 'being', 'objective', 'just', 'probably', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'Seals', 'move', 'floor', 'floor', 'weird', 'resonance', 'back', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'last', 'movie', 'Game', 'Death', 'where', 'level', 'building', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'greater', 'danger', 'resolution', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfying', 'even', 'know', 'Bin-laden', 'was', 'killed', 'Seal', 'team', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Maya', 'jingoistic', 'flag', 'waving', 'ending', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'started', 'sounds', '9/11', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'footage', 'people', 'running', 'White', 'House', 'celebrating', 'announcement', 'Bin-Laden', 'death', 'Instead', 'movie', 'Maya', 'alone', 'goal', 'life', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'living', 'past', 'decade', 'now', 'gone']",N/A

I am one of those weirdos who want what is best for our wonderful country, not what is best for some selfish, greedy politician. So, with that out of the way, this movie was spectacular, both in it's photographic perfection, and in the story it told.And what a story it was. Who knew that OBL was such a crying coward? Kathryn Bigalow did an amazing job of not only ferreting out the real story, but also showed real courage in not pandering to whatever politician brought this bad man to his necessary end. If you are on either the far left or right of the middle politically, you might not find this story satisfying simply because she did NOT give in and make it political.Perhaps, for me, the most astonishing part was finding out that a single woman in her stubborn search for the truth and in finding this vermin, finally made him pay for the thousands of innocent people he murdered. It was a very tense movie, reminiscent of Homeland in which I understand the beautiful character of Carrie in Homeland is based. Nobody in their right minds wants to see violence just for the sake of violence. But I have to say, watching this movie span 12+ years as our country underwent changes in Washington politics and the effect it had on the ""war"" on terrorism was almost as spell-binding as the search for OBL which is the main premise of this movie. Jessica Chastain as that woman put in an Oscar-worthy performance which unfortunately, didn't happen, brought her to life in a similar way that Clare Danes in Homeland does and got the Emmy for it!Well done, Ms. Bigelow.

1620223,A1PPAEHY7VZ4LB,B00AZNEW5G,"Kawa Jaan ""THE GAMER""","[3, 5]","To the men and women who made this movie: Thank you for telling us absolutely nothing useful about the so-called ""War on Terror."" Everything covered in this movie was already told - and told better - by newspapers, the Internet and news TV/radio stations. What this movie did, however, is just copy and paste the same stories and presented them in a 2  hour format, with very little background story or character development. By omitting background story and character development, this movie actually made it less believable to see and believe the movie. Not only that, but it also makes ""Zero Dark"" a very lazy way to a make a movie.So now that all this time, talent and money have been spent on telling us absolutely nothing, why don't they - the big Hollywood filmmakers - take time telling stories that matter?! If they want to tell stories about 9/11, why not start by asking questions. Questions such as: Who financed the attack? Who/which parties benefited from it? How was it possible to attack the most powerful nation on earth? What led the attackers to attack America? What was their reason for the attack? Did the fact that they were trained by the CIA to kill the Soviets - the infidels - and then allowed to keep their weapons and funding to attack the US have anything to do with 9/11? Why were the very drugs that funded terrorist operations allowed to grow and increase AFTER the US invaded Afghanistan? Why wasn't Bin Laden captured when the US had him surrounded in Afghanistan? Did Bin Laden even exist? Did he have help/support inside the US in the 9/11 attacks? Who were his connections and supporters? Are/Were any US politicians involved? What role did corporations play in the 9/11 attacks? Instead of invading the whole country of Iraq, why weren't the same tactics that got Bin Laden used to get Saddam Hussein? So on; so on, and so on...By contrast, ""Argo"" - another movie made last year about the ""actual"" events in the Mid-East - took time to do some research and tell a credible story. While some of the events may have changed in that movie, the movie itself was very entertaining and very well directed by Ben Affleck. ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" however, takes itself way too seriously, but at the end delivers none of the thrills or entertainment value it's expected to deliver.Don't get me wrong here, though, I'm not suggesting that all movies should deliver entertainment and nothing more. What I'm suggesting is that if you are not presenting all the facts (as in Zero Dark's case), or are presenting them in a way that makes them seem stupid and unbelievable, then, at least, you should deliver some entertainment value, if nothing else.Having said that, I do understand that it's difficult to make an ""entertaining"" movie about such a difficult subject - terrorism - which any way one looks at it, presents the darkest moments in human history. Darkest moments because a group of men, either driven by religious extremism/revenge/money/whatever attacked and killed thousands of innocent people, and then another group of men - a much larger one - went after them and attacked, not caring that their attack too would end up destroying many innocent lives. It's also a very dark chapter because all the facts of both the 9/11 attacks and, of what led the attackers to attack, have been kept secret from the public.So if you loved this movie, please do consider the points I presented here before commenting on my review. My main argument is that this movie took the easy way out and just retold events as they were covered by the news media. Would I be wrong to expect that the movie had taken more time to present a story with a background as to what led to the attacks in the first place? Because I believe that when those very hard questions are asked, and then when they are researched and answered as accurately as possible, that that's when a movie or story rises above the sum of its parts. Otherwise, it's just another average movie or story. And I happen to not like average movies.

Gordon,"[2, 4]","...which, historically, a lot of the best films do.For me, this film has two unusual qualities;1) Its greatest weakness is also its greatest strength. It takes pains to keep its distance, to stay neutral andunemotional. It refuses to assign easy labels, to people or issues, even (as has been much discussed) beingambiguous about the use of torture. It gives very little back-story, even of the lead character. It doesn't work to winyou to a point of view, to make you want to cheer your approval, or shake your head in shame, or even like or dislikethe characters.For most of the film I found the effect (as one might expect) oddly alienating. I was gripped by the story, but I didn'tfeel strong emotions, or care about characters in the way a 'normal' film would have made me. And while watching,this felt like a weakness. I felt distracted, disappointed, even bored at times, regardless of the dramatic nature of the story.Yet that same quality led me to feeling powerfully haunted by the film when it was over -- to ponder violence and itseffects on human beings, the thin lines between perseverance and obsession, the inability to ever have a clear moralityin time of war. By stubbornly, steadfastly refusing to spoon feed me it's own opinions,  it forced me to think, uncomfortably,messily about a lot of things, for myself.2) It's also a film where, for me, to a large degree the whole movie is redeemed by its final images,Spoiler in next line!In finally dramatizing the lost beyond words state of our lead character, suddenly all the emotionshe never allowed herself and us is paid off in seeing that hard facade crack.  We are left with the terribleemptiness of even righteous revenge and the realization that both the character (and by extensionperhaps the nation?)  are unmoored and at sea with how to deal with the world they find themselves in,and in some ways helped to create.

After all, it was based upon one of the most dramatic events in recent history and filmed by the Academy Award winning director of ""The Hurt Locker"".  But it failed to deliver on its potential.  Perhaps that's because the director and screenwriter made a decision to focus on their fictional central character - a young CIA agent portrayed by Jessica Chastain - rather than upon the ten-year arc of actual events leading to the killing of Osama bin Laden.  Thus, the film became a story of the Jessica Chastain character against the CIA bureaucracy, rather than a story of the United States versus terrorism.  And frankly, Chastain's character, over-written and over-acted though she is, simply isn't very believable or very interesting.Moreover, the valiant Navy Seals who made the raid upon bin Laden's compound in Pakistan are given very, very short shrift.  They're simply an indistinguishable group of one-dimensional figures stumbling around in the murky green half-light of starlight scopes, blowing up doors and climbing stairs.In ""Argo"", Ben Affleck took a story we all knew, with an ending that we all knew and created a gripping, fast-paced thriller.

The rest of the movie lurches to the ultimate climax of the raid and killing of the ""bad guy"". The buildup and the end is clinical, no big drama, and the actual raid is somewhat of a downer.  I thought the director's first work ""Hurt Locker"" got way too much positive credit and the same is true here. It's fairly obvious that her political leanings are towards the right, not overtly so but a definite tilt that way, which probably is a minority position given the left leanings of Hollywood in general. I'm not posturing whether one way is right or wrong, just pointing out my opinion of how this director paints her pictures (though probably muddled by her conscious effort not to appear so).

1620288,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B00AZNEW5G,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[5, 18]","This film is essentially a revenge western along the lines of ""the searchers"" or ""true grit"". Its problem is that it is by turns, long, boring and ultimately pointless. A good portion of the film consists of repetitive scenes of torture followed by capsule terrorists attacks. The film keeps hammering on the same obvious points for what seems like hours. Unlike most revenge westerns, it has no greater point to make than to just grind out the motions of the characters.The center of the film is Maya. Having no life and being passive-aggressive does not make for an interesting character. Most of the other people in the film are reduced to ciphers. The seal team, for example, is reduced to being treated like a pick-up basketball team of dumb jocks. We don't see their prepartions. We don't see the extensive planning, rehearsals and training that are well known to have went into the mission. Rather than anything real, we are given dumb unrealistic scenes like the one when they go to ""area 51"" to pick up their stealth helicopters. The politicians and hierarchy of the intelligence agencies are completely absent as well. The chain of command is maya, weak boss, obnoxous boss and apparently the president. Rather than reality, we are presented with a view of the world through the eyes of an angry child.The film also has the sense of being designed by committee with an objective of not offending anyone. The film avoids controversy by often trying to stay on all sides of an issue. This is particularly true of the torture scenes which have been designed seemingly to give everyone what they want. Of course the lack of any point of view on the torture makes the sheer volume of torture presented in the film all the more pointless.As with the worst sort of propaganda, the film gets people worked up about an issue thats in the past (torture) while not saying one word about what it was replaced with. If you wanted realism, post-torture ""Maya"" would have been shown spending most of her time writing up death lists for the ""star chamber"" to approve. What replaced torture is death by drone. But ""responsible"" people can't talk about that. At least not in a major motion picture.The raid is the opposite of thrilling. I don't find anything particularly dramatic about POV soldiers kicking down doors and going through rooms full of women and children to ultimately shoot up a bedroom.I suppose the film will appeal to the crowd who likes ultra-detailed police procedurals. But I've never liked that sort of thing myself. Its all the worse here because its a ""lone"" character procedural. Maya does everything. Maya is everywhere. When the team returns from Pakistan, almost nobody is there except for Maya. They don't even give us the natural epilogue of the burial at sea of OBL.The film is around 160 minutes but it feels like four hours. After a while, you could see the terrorism scenes coming from a mile away. But after a while, anything other than repetitive torture scenes seemed like a positive.The film is badly written and badly directed. I can't say anything bad about Chastain's performance because it appears that she was given nothing to work with in terms of the script. How a film this bad was nominated for the highest awards is beyond me. There were points to be made about revenge in a film like this but the film managed to touch not one of them.",1,a modern revenge western,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3377,"['film', 'essentially', 'revenge', 'western', 'lines', 'searchers', 'true', 'grit', 'problem', 'turns', 'long', 'boring', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'good', 'portion', 'film', 'repetitive', 'scenes', 'torture', 'followed', 'capsule', 'terrorists', 'attacks', 'film', 'hammering', 'same', 'obvious', 'points', 'what', 'like', 'hours', 'most', 'revenge', 'westerns', 'greater', 'point', 'make', 'just', 'grind', 'out', 'motions', 'characters.The', 'center', 'film', 'Maya', 'Having', 'life', 'being', 'passive-aggressive', 'not', 'make', 'interesting', 'character', 'Most', 'other', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'reduced', 'ciphers', 'seal', 'team', 'example', 'reduced', 'being', 'treated', 'pick-up', 'basketball', 'team', 'dumb', 'jocks', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'prepartions', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'extensive', 'planning', 'rehearsals', 'training', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'have', 'went', 'mission', 'Rather', 'anything', 'real', 'are', 'given', 'dumb', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'one', 'when', 'go', 'area', '51', 'pick', 'up', 'stealth', 'helicopters', 'politicians', 'hierarchy', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'are', 'completely', 'absent', 'as', 'well', 'chain', 'command', 'maya', 'weak', 'boss', 'obnoxous', 'boss', 'apparently', 'president', 'Rather', 'reality', 'are', 'presented', 'view', 'world', 'eyes', 'angry', 'child.The', 'film', 'also', 'sense', 'being', 'designed', 'committee', 'objective', 'not', 'offending', 'anyone', 'film', 'avoids', 'controversy', 'often', 'trying', 'stay', 'sides', 'issue', 'particularly', 'true', 'torture', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'seemingly', 'give', 'everyone', 'what', 'want', 'course', 'lack', 'point', 'view', 'torture', 'sheer', 'volume', 'torture', 'presented', 'film', 'more', 'pointless.As', 'worst', 'sort', 'propaganda', 'film', 'people', 'worked', 'up', 'issue', 'thats', 'past', 'torture', 'not', 'saying', 'one', 'word', 'what', 'was', 'replaced', 'wanted', 'realism', 'post-torture', 'Maya', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'writing', 'up', 'death', 'lists', 'star', 'chamber', 'approve', 'What', 'replaced', 'torture', 'death', 'drone', 'responsible', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'least', 'not', 'major', 'motion', 'picture.The', 'raid', 'opposite', 'thrilling', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'POV', 'soldiers', 'kicking', 'down', 'doors', 'going', 'rooms', 'full', 'women', 'children', 'ultimately', 'shoot', 'up', 'bedroom.I', 'suppose', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'crowd', 'who', 'ultra-detailed', 'police', 'procedurals', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'sort', 'thing', 'worse', 'here', 'lone', 'character', 'procedural', 'Maya', 'everything', 'Maya', 'everywhere', 'When', 'team', 'returns', 'Pakistan', 'almost', 'nobody', 'there', 'Maya', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'natural', 'epilogue', 'burial', 'sea', 'OBL.The', 'film', '160', 'minutes', 'four', 'hours', 'while', 'could', 'see', 'terrorism', 'scenes', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'while', 'anything', 'other', 'repetitive', 'torture', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'positive.The', 'film', 'badly', 'written', 'badly', 'directed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'was', 'given', 'nothing', 'work', 'terms', 'script', 'How', 'film', 'bad', 'was', 'nominated', 'highest', 'awards', 'were', 'points', 'be', 'made', 'revenge', 'film', 'film', 'managed', 'touch', 'not', 'one']",N/A

1620293,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AZNEW5G,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","It's hard to believe that there is a young generation out there that didn't experience 9/11 first hand. For those of us who lived through it, it doesn't seem all that long ago. So this generation can't quite grasp the importance of Osama Bin Laden's death. Still, two movies came out last year with that subject at their core. One seemed little more than a promotional piece for President Obama during an election year (going so far as to include an ill timed comment by Mitt Romney who had nothing to do with the subject matter) showing almost as much of him as the SEAL team that took Bin Laden out. The other was nominated for best picture and nearly won.ZERO DARK THIRTY was noted for taking a few dramatic liberties (such as the main character actually being a composite of several main players in what unfolded) but that doesn't detract from the story being told. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya, a young CIA agent on her first time in the Middle East as the film opens. She's there during an interrogation and sees first hand how brutal it can be. While she shies away from it she stays silent.The film moves quickly from place to place, time to time through the career of Maya. She doggedly pursues any lead that could find Bin Laden. One possible lead is a courier for messages he sends out but that falls to the wayside when he apparently is killed. It's not until later in the film that she learns he came from a family with 8 brothers and it was one of them killed not the man she was searching for.Through her career we see how things change. Her passive nature turns to a desire to catch and kill her prey. When a friend is killed in a car bombing Maya becomes even more determined. Add to that a machine gun attack on her and she won't let anyone stand in her way, not even her immediate supervisors. Maya's in your face attitude may not win her a large number of friends but it does earn her respect.No, this isn't a spoiler since we know the outcome of this story. Eventually a possible site for Bin Laden is found. When a table full of bureaucrats is asked if this is a 100% surety that Bin Laden is there they each take a turn hem hawing around with smaller percentages in mind. Only Maya has the courage to say this is as close to 100$ as they are likely to ever be.Given the go ahead the last 30 minutes or so of the film deals with the SEAL team that was sent in to capture or kill Bin Laden. While the film to this point, nearly 2 hours, dealt with what it took to find him, this 30 minutes is shown from a tactical standpoint where we see the team organize then put into action the plan to take him out in action.The thing that stands out about this film is that it seems more matter of fact than most movies made. There is no John Wayne type motivating and leading a group into the battle field. This is more what the situation was like, plain and simple. The only bad thing about that is that it plays out kind of bland.Perhaps we're all still too close to the situation than we'd like to admit. Perhaps the wounds are still too exposed. Perhaps the death of Bin Laden was too quick and sudden to accept. While the story is an important one and this film does give credit where credit was due, it's still a bit slow paced and realistic to be considered entertainment. A good movie technically yes, but for enjoyment I'm not so sure. Whether you watch this film will be determined by your outlook on the situation.

1620296,A1OHITJZJSENCZ,B00AZNEW5G,"Marvelous Mal ""The Malster""","[44, 136]","To the Movie's credit, it does a few things well. The Movie correctly portrays the fact that enhanced interrogation succeeds. Without enhanced interrogation, hundreds of dangerous terrorist murderers would still be free and killing innocent people.  The Movie also does a good job portraying our brave Navy Seals at work. As Seal missions go, this one was rather easy. There were only two armed men at the Bin Laden compound, and they were killed in short order. The rest was mop up of women and children.  The Movie also correctly portrays the fact that finding terrorists is a team effort, which requires the work of many people and a great deal of coordinated intelligence collection.Unfortunately, the Movie fails dismally by suggesting that a fictionalized female character, Maya, almost single-handedly located Bin Laden. This is nonsense. From the moment the first interrogator (not Maya) identified a Bin Laden courier, he was a major focus of ongoing efforts by the CIA and DIA. Moreover, the Movie provides false dialogue stating there were no intelligence assets on the ground near the Bin Laden compound. (Presumably, this was to inflate the importance of the fictionalized Maya character. Interestingly, in Sanskrit, Maya means illusion. Certainly, the inflated importance of the Maya character is illusory Hollywood entertainment.) In truth, there were local intelligence assets on the ground observing the Bin Laden compound for many months or longer. Also, a Pakistani physician risked his life to provide invaluable intelligence on the occupants of the Bin Laden compound. That physician remains in Pakistani prison, after the Obama administration exposed him while bragging about the mission. Moreover, local intelligence assets observed a large, bearded man at the compound, making the identification of Bin Laden almost certain.  With their pre-mission surveillance, these assists confirmed that Bin Laden never left the compound, making his presence on the night of the mission almost certain.The most preposterous claim of the Movie is that Bin Laden was still an effective Al Qaeda leader at the time of his death and killing him would put an end to Al Qaeda. Since, at least, 2005, Bin Laden had been rendered incommunicado and ineffective as a terror leader. Of course, history shows that, even after Bin Laden's death, Al Qaeda continues to threaten and kill Americans, including our U.S. Ambassador to Libya and citizens around the world. While Bin Laden was an important psychological target for the American public, his death did not represent a major military or counter-terrorism victory. If anything, Bin Laden's death and rebirth as a spiritual martyr has given new energy and inspiration to Al Qaeda around the world including, among other things, the Al Qaeda-inspired ""Arab Spring.""

1620298,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B00AZNEW5G,maskirovka,"[3, 9]","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a gripping movie that presents a fiction-informed-by-fact account of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden that concluded on 1 May 2011 with the successful raid on his safehouse in Abbottabad, Pakistan where justice finally caught up to the al-Qa'ida leader.If someone asked me, ""But what's the movie like?"" I'd ask him or her if they'd seen the movie ""the Big Red One.""  That was an excellent movie made a few decades ago that depicted what the American experience in the European Theater of World War II was like by following a fictional squad as they moved from battlefields in North Africa, Italy, France, and finally Germany itself.  After a while, you realize that the squad isn't meant to be seen as a a real one but rather symbolizes all the brave soldiers that fought for America on those battlefields.The Big Red OneIt's the same thing for ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" except the battlefields are in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other locales in the War on Terror.  And instead of bright-eyed GIs, the protagonists are the CIA operatives that spearheaded the hunt for Bin Laden and made the SEAL team raid in 2011 possible.  In particular, we see the CIA's hunt unfold through the eyes of ""Maya"" (who is modeled somewhat on a real-life CIA analyst who I have no doubt will write her own book one of these days).  As the movie unfolds, we see how the Intelligence Community was able to locate Bin Laden, by searching for a key courier who worked directly for him and then following that man back to the strange looking compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden had been hiding (almost in plain sight of the Pakistan authorities).The movie has drawn criticism from some like John McCain who seems to believe that his experience being tortured in Vietnam makes him an authority on what interrogation measures do and do not work and some ""reviewers"" here on amazon (who only get upset about torture when it is allegedly being practiced by the US...as opposed to by the Chinese, Russians, or North Koreans).  I think it is fair to say that the movie oversimplifies the issue and may make people watching it think that enhanced interrogation techniques were the only reason for the success in Abbottabad.  The truth is that there were all kinds of intelligence streams that led to the successful conclusion of the manhunt.  But arguing that the movie is pro-torture is absurd.  ""Zero Dark Thirty"" simply shows what happened and shows that yes, sometimes people did provide useful information under such duress. I suspect that the anti-torture crowd is so insistent that it DOESN'T WORK AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GETTING BIN LADEN is because they're not comfortable with making the argument simply that it's wrong on moral grounds.I only have minor criticisms of the movie apart from that.  I found myself rather skeptical that CIA operatives would discuss highly classified matters over cell phones.  I also felt that the movie gave pretty short shrift to all the other agencies out there that took part in the manhunt and whose contributions made getting Bin Laden possible.  But by and large, those are minor flaws.  So go see this movie and ignore people who condemn it (sometimes without seeing it) AS BEING PRO-TORTURE.  They're wrong.  It's pro-facts.Here are some documentaries and a book that are well-worth viewing/reading about the issues of interrogation, terrorism, and tortureWe Can Make You Talk (History Sunday)The History Channel : The Dark Art of Interrogation , Secrets of Body Language : Learn Interrogation Techniques 2 Pack CollectionThe Battle of AlgiersThe Interrogators: Inside the Secret War Against al QaedaAn article by Bruce Hoffman in the Atlantic called ""A Nasty Business"" (I'd provide the link but I don't believe amazon.com would allow that).",5,A Counterterrorism Epic,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,3784,"['Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'gripping', 'movie', 'fiction-informed-by-fact', 'account', 'hunt', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'concluded', '1', 'May', '2011', 'successful', 'raid', 'safehouse', 'Abbottabad', 'Pakistan', 'where', 'justice', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', ""al-Qa'ida"", 'leader.If', 'someone', 'asked', 'what', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ask', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Big', 'Red', 'One', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'made', 'few', 'decades', 'depicted', 'what', 'American', 'experience', 'European', 'Theater', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'following', 'fictional', 'squad', 'moved', 'battlefields', 'North', 'Africa', 'Italy', 'France', 'finally', 'Germany', 'while', 'realize', 'squad', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'real', 'one', 'rather', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'fought', 'America', 'battlefields.The', 'Big', 'Red', 'OneIt', 'same', 'thing', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'battlefields', 'are', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'Iraq', 'other', 'locales', 'War', 'Terror', 'instead', 'bright-eyed', 'GIs', 'protagonists', 'are', 'CIA', 'spearheaded', 'hunt', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'made', 'SEAL', 'team', 'raid', '2011', 'possible', 'particular', 'see', 'CIA', 'hunt', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'Maya', 'who', 'modeled', 'somewhat', 'real-life', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'who', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'write', 'own', 'book', 'one', 'days', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'see', 'how', 'Intelligence', 'Community', 'was', 'able', 'locate', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'searching', 'key', 'courier', 'who', 'worked', 'directly', 'then', 'following', 'man', 'back', 'strange', 'looking', 'compound', 'Abbottabad', 'where', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'had', 'been', 'hiding', 'almost', 'plain', 'sight', 'Pakistan', 'authorities', '.The', 'movie', 'drawn', 'criticism', 'John', 'McCain', 'who', 'believe', 'experience', 'being', 'tortured', 'Vietnam', 'authority', 'what', 'interrogation', 'measures', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'reviewers', 'here', 'amazon', 'who', 'only', 'get', 'upset', 'torture', 'when', 'allegedly', 'being', 'practiced', 'US', 'opposed', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'North', 'Koreans', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'movie', 'issue', 'may', 'make', 'people', 'watching', 'think', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'were', 'only', 'reason', 'success', 'Abbottabad', 'truth', 'were', 'kinds', 'intelligence', 'streams', 'led', 'successful', 'conclusion', 'manhunt', 'arguing', 'movie', 'pro-torture', 'absurd', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'simply', 'what', 'happened', 'yes', 'sometimes', 'people', 'did', 'provide', 'useful', 'information', 'such', 'duress', 'suspect', 'anti-torture', 'crowd', 'so', 'insistent', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'AND', 'HAD', 'NOTHING', 'TO', 'DO', 'WITH', 'GETTING', 'BIN', 'LADEN', ""'re"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'making', 'argument', 'simply', 'wrong', 'moral', 'grounds.I', 'only', 'have', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'apart', 'found', 'rather', 'skeptical', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'would', 'discuss', 'highly', 'classified', 'matters', 'cell', 'phones', 'also', 'felt', 'movie', 'gave', 'pretty', 'short', 'shrift', 'other', 'agencies', 'there', 'took', 'part', 'manhunt', 'contributions', 'made', 'getting', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'possible', 'large', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'So', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'ignore', 'people', 'who', 'condemn', 'sometimes', 'seeing', 'BEING', 'PRO-TORTURE', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'pro-facts.Here', 'are', 'documentaries', 'book', 'are', 'well-worth', 'viewing/reading', 'issues', 'interrogation', 'terrorism', 'tortureWe', 'Can', 'Make', 'Talk', 'History', 'Sunday', 'History', 'Channel', 'Dark', 'Art', 'Interrogation', 'Secrets', 'Body', 'Language', 'Learn', 'Interrogation', 'Techniques', '2', 'Pack', 'CollectionThe', 'Battle', 'AlgiersThe', 'Interrogators', 'Secret', 'War', 'Against', 'al', 'QaedaAn', 'article', 'Bruce', 'Hoffman', 'Atlantic', 'called', 'A', 'Nasty', 'Business', ""'d"", 'provide', 'link', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'amazon.com', 'would', 'allow']",N/A

1620301,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,B00AZNEW5G,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[11, 16]","The memories will haunt us forever. The horrible, gut-wrenching 9-1-1 calls made by trapped victims in the World Trade Center after the planes crashed into them but before the buildings crumbled to the ground. We have forced the recollection to the back of our minds, to the fringe of our consciousness, but they are always there. For nearly all Americans, there is no memory more vivid, no moment more easily recalled, than that fateful September morning.And that is how Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow's gritty and straightforward account of the CIA's hunt for Osama Bin Laden, begins - with the audio of those victims' calls as they vainly waited for help as the building around them burned. The opening jars viewers, unsettling them. It also immediately establishes an emotional connection with the film to the audience .The movie then fast forwards two years, to an undisclosed CIA black site somewhere in the Middle East, where detainees are being interrogated. This is where we meet Maya (played superbly by Jessica Chastain), a new CIA agent whom Washington has deemed ""a killer"". At first, Maya timidly joins the enhanced interrogations, mostly watching and taking a backseat as the more grizzled, veteran agent Dan (Jason Clarke).We watch as Dan and Maya discuss strategy on how best to break the detainees and glean valuable intelligence from them. Many tactics are used. Loud metal is played in the detainee's squalid quarters all night long. Prisoners are stripped naked and walked on a leash. They are forced into a small box. Waterboarding is used as prisoners are hooded and gallons of water poured over their face. Other times detainees are rewarded with nice dinners. It is a harsh reality, one that Bigelow looks at unflinchingly, if a bit dramatically.Bit by painstaking bit, Maya and Dan slowly extract information from a variety of sources. While this goes on, the years pass. More terrorist acts occur, some depicted with news coverage from the actual events. Often, its two steps forward and one step back, as dead end leads are followed to no avail. Dan leaves his foreign post to take a desk job back in Washington. Fellow CIA agents are killed by suicide bombers. A machine gun wielding terrorist attacks Maya as she leaves her protected residential compound in Pakistan one morning for work. Maya soldiers on.Maya's work is largely unrewarding but years of determined, dogged persistence eventually pay off, leading the audience to the now infamous small white compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden lived in obscurity.When Maya identifies the compound where she believes Bin Laden is hiding, much ado is made of the CIA brass deciding whether or not to proceed with action. While this provides the film with tension and drama, it also painted the intelligence community as reticent, afraid to take action lest it failed in the public's eye.After spending two hours with Maya, the film leaves her behind for most of the last half hour, as the viewer follows SEAL Team Six in the raid that ended with Bin Laden's killing. This conclusion to the movie is nothing less than riveting. From the ride on the stealth helicopters to the storming of the residence, everything depicted seemed refreshingly realistic, unlike too many other Hollywood action sequences that feature superhuman stunts and horrible combat tactics. While I am sure artistic license was taken, nothing was apparently out of place.Jessica Chastain's performance as Maya is remarkable. We see her transform from an almost timorous rookie into a hard-nosed, jaded veteran agent by the end of the film. Don't expect to see where she came from or learn her back story. The movie is as focused as Maya. This approach works, however, because, as I noted earlier, the audience is already emotionally invested in the movie's outcome.Bigelow's direction and Boal's screenwriting combined to make another gem. Four years ago, they collaborated together on The Hurt Locker which won the coveted Oscar for Best Picture. That year, they probably didn't deserve it. This year, they did deserve the award but were completely snubbed at the Academy Awards. Personally, I believe Chastain, Bigelow and Boal all deserved Oscars.Taking the two movies together, however, I am glad Bigelow and Boal are making films about our involvement in the Middle East. Most movie studios refuse to touch the subject with a ten foot pole, preferring to trot out movies with tired villains and plot lines involving Communists, Nazis or ambiguous European arms dealers. How refreshing it is to view movies that are actually relevant to our times!Of course, the reason the Oscars probably ignored this film (besides an unglamorous tie in sound editing) is because of the inherent political controversies embedded in a story like this. Some are miffed the enhanced interrogation techniques (e.g. waterboarding) weren't shown with medical personnel present, as allegedly all interrogations involving such measures had. Others are upset that the techniques were shown to net positive information for the CIA.I thought the scenes involving these techniques were shown for what they were: Harsh measures that were probably necessary for the occasion. Bigelow did not seem to pass judgment on the interrogation methods either way. She did her best to show them as straightforwardly as possible and let the viewers come to their own conclusions. I believe this was the best possible approach for her to take.All in all, this is an excellent movie deserving of your thought and attention. It is not light popcorn fare, though that doesn't mean it fails to entertain. It is intimate as it traces Maya's personal story and historic and sweeping in the plot's climax. It's a harsh, realistic story, one that Bigelow honestly tells. Dark, subtle, intimate, epic, magnificent.",5,"Deserved Oscar for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Actress",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,5838,"['memories', 'will', 'haunt', 'forever', 'horrible',

1620326,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00AZNEW5G,mirasreviews,"[6, 10]","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the second collaboration between action director Kathryn Bigelow and journalist-turned-screenwriter Mark Boal. The duo seem to be the darlings of Hollywood, but I'm losing my taste for Kathryn Bigelow, whose work I have liked for 20 years, on account of this partnership. Boal's scripts are meaningless and impossible to direct effectively, so they show off Bigelow's abilities very poorly. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" purports to chronicle the CIA's 9 1/2-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden following his admission to being the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. It focuses on the investigation by a relentless CIA analyst named ""Maya"", who is determined to locate and kill Bin Laden or, it seems, die trying.CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) travels to Pakistan, where a Saudi Arabian named Ammar (Reda Kateb) is being tortured by her colleague Dan (Jason Clarke), because Ammar is the nephew of someone who transferred $5000 to a 9/11 hijacker. Dan wants to know about planned terror attacks. Maya wants to know about a man named Abu Ahmed whom she believes is a courier with a direct line to Osama bin Laden. She's given an office in the embassy under the supervision of CIA station chief Joe Bradley (Kyle Chandler). Her immediate superior is a woman named Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), who is convinced that money motivates militant Islamists and can lead us to them. Maya, meanwhile, is obsessed with learning the identity of Abu Ahmed.This movie doesn't seem to be about anything. In fact, it seems to be trying very hard not to be about anything. The narrative is presented in a disjointed fashion, flitting around between Maya's obsessive search for Abu Ahmed, terror attacks, Washington, the inhospitable environment for Americans in Pakistan, strife between Maya and her superiors, another development in the Abu Ahmed investigation, more terror attacks, and so on. Critics have expressed a variety of opinions on how the film views torture, but the filmmakers try hard not to have a view on torture. Torture is presented in a fashion that makes even waterboarding seem mundane. It's effectively in the background.""Zero Dark Thirty"" implies that critical information about Abu Ahmed was discovered as a result of torture. It wasn't. It gives the impression that torture was used to extract specific pieces of information from people who were suspected of having that information. But that is not generally how the CIA or JSOC used torture. There is a scene in which a seemingly nice, educated man volunteers important information after, not during, being tortured, to avoid being tortured further. This makes no sense and did not happen. And, if you think that Ammar would not have been so easily fooled by Maya's attempt to trick him into spilling the beans in another scene, you're right. That scene is fictional. The place of torture in this narrative is fictional, but the film is indifferent to the act of torture.That's about as shrewd as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" gets in its attempts to manipulate the audience. Terror attacks around the globe are interspersed with the hunt for Osama bin Laden, giving the impression that the attacks had some connection to bin Laden or to his defunct organization in Afghanistan. Most had no such connection. That might qualify as an attempt to mislead in order to advance, or justify, a political agenda, but it seems more an attempt to bring some kind of urgency to a long, dull, disjointed story. The film's use of torture and terror attacks makes it sound like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is an apologist or even cheerleader for the CIA's methods and goals in the post-9/11 years. But the CIA actually doesn't come across well at all, worst of all the story's protagonist.The CIA officers, as presented, are neither intelligent nor rational. They're yuppies. Their primary motivation seems to be careerism. They're given too much independence to pursue any theory that they think will get them a promotion. Jessica is irresponsible to the point of criminality. Dan is a caricature of an insecure macho male. Maya is a kook who tells her colleague that she believes she was ""spared"" so that she could ""finish the job"", i.e. kill bin Laden. She's a narcissist. Her station chief accuses her of being out of her mind and criticizes her obsession with bin Laden when homeland terrorism is not the current threat. So she has a temper tantrum. Maya is a socially maladjusted individual without any particular aptitude or appealing characteristic. Her defining qualities are her obsessiveness and self-delusion. I guess being a narcissistic dullard gets you far at the CIA.This is the movie's protagonist. She's a thoroughly distasteful character, despite the filmmakers' clumsy attempt to disguise that fact. They cast the sweet-voiced, pretty Jessica Chastain to make Maya more appealing. The result is that Chastain's mannerisms completely defy her dialogue, which comes off as ridiculous and not even a little convincing. It's such a blatant attempt to whitewash her that I just assumed that the real CIA analyst on which Maya is based must have a manner completely the opposite of Chastain's in the film. There is not one sympathetic character in this movie. They are pursuing Osama bin Laden, a person responsible for thousands of murders, yet there is no one to root for, as they are all two-dimensional and repellent. How can anyone write a film this badly?The raid on the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan that took Osama bin Laden's life is presented in close to real time. The raid lasts 30 minutes, in the dark, including, inexplicably, 5 minutes watching the Navy SEALs collect harddrives and brick-a-brack in a bag. Too long. Total running time is 2 hours and 40 minutes. Way too long. If ""Zero Dark Thirty"" had been effective propaganda, it would have been entertaining and focused. If it had looked at the CIA's operations critically, it would have been thought-provoking. It's not trying to inform. It's not trying to propagandize beyond the little it needs to do to keep the White House happy. Its story-telling technique is dreadful. There is no character development. Even the title ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is trivial military slang, chosen to be meaningless. This film is badly written, badly directed, badly edited, badly cast, and badly acted.",2,"Irrespective of Politics, This Film Is Terrible.",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,6358,"['Zero', 'Dark',

Every moviegoer can answer those questions in there own way. The movie certainly doesn't gloss over the torture scenes or make light of it.Beyond that the movie is riveting. The first 90 minutes concerns itself with the tedious but vital intelligence gathering in the 9 1/2 years leading up to locating OBL. The female CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain (The Help) works tirelessly on this. She becomes convinced that a minor player in Al Qaeda, a courier, is the way forward. She and a small group of covert agents tediously and painstakingly focus on the courier. When the courier's travels finally lead them to a reclusive walled in residence she reports this up the chain of command. Because she can not offer absolute certainity that OBL is the mysterious resident the bureaucrats and politicians above her pay grade become choked with caution.

1620333,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00AZNEW5G,M. Oleson,"[5, 10]","There may be spoilers.Director Kathryn Bigelow got everybody's attention in 2008 with ""The Hurt Locker"" and while this is certainly no sequel, there are some common elements that weave their way throughout both films.  Like Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James, Golden Globe winner Jessica Chastain's Maya is a bit of a loner.  Highly focused on their mission both characters have little use for nonsense.Maya is a CIA analyst recruited out of high school trained in the unglamorous work of sifting through leads to identify the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, beginning a couple years after 9/11.  Early on she joins a CIA interrogator (Jason Clarke) interviewing captured lower level terrorists.  The first 30 minutes of the film contains most of the well-documented torture scenes.  While unnerving, I didn't find them much more squirm inducing than when Daniel Craig as James Bond got his jollies wacked by a steel ball in ""Casino Royale.""In any case, a tidbit of info was revealed which Maya locks onto and runs with it for years, much to the dismay of her boss (Kyle Chandler) in Pakistan.  He and most everybody else believe the lead is worthless.  The middle section of the film can be a bit convoluted with the unfamiliar names in this part of the world and runs like an elaborate procedural investigation that we have now become familiar with.Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal used eyewitness accounts for the basis of their film and it certainly feels honest.  Chastain's casting is interesting.  A fair skinned redhead clearly stands out in the dusty Muslim world and Maya seems distant, even from those closest to her.  Not that she has a personal life.  She does get close to another female analyst (Jennifer Ehle) who becomes a casualty.  This leads to Maya's increased focus on the courier lead she had acquired years earlier.Maya learns to be tough and vocal about her beliefs in the macho world of the CIA.  In one great scene, her superiors are briefing the Secretary of Defense (James Gandolfini) who is to make a recommendation to President Obama as to whether they believe Osama is indeed holing up in a barricaded house in Abbottabad.  One by one the various agency heads hedge their bets by giving their odds of him being there.  Maya isn't asked but shouts out 100%.  She backs off to 95% and says something to the effect of ""I know you guys don't like certainty.""  When Secretary Panetta asks ""who is this woman?"" Maya responds ""I'm the M.....f..... who found the place.""  Memorable line.The third act begins as the seal team gets the go ahead for the assault.  Even though we know the outcome, Bigelow takes us through the precision flying though mountain passes and into the Osama compound.  The house is locked up tight so explosives are needed to take down doors and barricades.  This isn't one of those typical in-and-out missions.  It is done in real time (or at least so it seems).  This is one gripping film that ultimately is about one analyst's determination to get Osama Bin Laden.

It's focus on the psychotic tension of a young female CIA case officer whose only qualification is her ego-defining pursuit of fulfilling her will by killing Bin Laden may be seen by some as a woman filmmaker trying to boost the role of women in our conciousness but it fails.  You simply don't want to see this woman CIA case officer ever again by the time she lifts the body bag and looks on the dead face of a man her willfulness has killed in his bedroom.Was Bin Laden a monster, of course.  Was the Seal team highly trained and almost mythical as they walked between reality, fantasy, and history, without a doubt.  Was the intelligence community amazingly well-wired so as to catch even off hand comments and build from those back to an understanding of a world of criminals who thought they could hide in plain sight, absolutely.

I can't believe it was nominated for even one Oscar.The acting was abominable; rote, wooden, uninspired, and cliched. Forty-five minutes into the movie, I kept wondering, ""who cares about these characters, or even if they're historically accurate and portray 'real people' ?"" The acting was just too mechanical and cliched to care.A shame. I really did want to enjoy this film. It's proof that a poor director with equally talentless actors/actresses can drag even the best subject matter down.Sure, we knew what was going to happen... I'd kept up with the 'hunt' for Al-Qaeda operatives, I knew beforehand all the AQ personalities that were mentioned. I followed the after-action news pretty intensely--just as I did with two-year investigation of Nixon and Watergate. Three masterful actors (Robards, Redford, and Hoffman) proved that one could take on an actual historical event of which the origins and outcome were known to the world (and where details were probably published even more thoroughly), and still, truly professional actors could craft great tension, suspense, and audience concern/interest for the characters they portrayed and the storyline even if it was already well-known.Not so with Bigelow and Chastain, et. al.  I was bored enough to check the time about 6x during the movie. I should have just given up and used the time more wisely.

Understanding of course, that the CIA portion was a longer period of time. I just think there was an unfair balance where we came to know the CIA analysts well, even up to how they socialized. And as this is a movie of somewhat historical proportions, with historical figures, it would have been nice to have seen a more Leon Paneta looking actor play that role, instead of Tony Soprano.Apparently, there was some rehearsal raids before the actual raid, in a 'kill house' based on the available information about the compound dwelling. This could have been depicted. Also, the chit chat en route to the compound never happened and should not have been added. I think the tension that could have been brought to the scene, traditionally known as the 'pregnant pause' was lost with the back and forth banter. But overall, a good thriller BASED on true events.As a critique of the actual DVD itself, the flight and arrival to the compound was very dark, but worked okay in a darked theatre. However, for home viewing, I find it difficult to see the images even in a darkened room.

The film does well in it's narative, and the acting, writing and plot are solid, it's just that there have been a couple of other films made on the same subject that were a lot more entertaining and just as well made, and were definately better movies. I believe Bigelow desired to tell a more accurate version of the events, and indeed has, but in doing so it made the entire afair seem a bit dull.

1620438,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AZNEW5G,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","****1/2&#8220;Zero Dark Thirty&#8221; chronicles one of the greatest successful manhunts of all time - the one that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. With a screenplay by Mark Boal and direction by Kathryn Bigelow, the movie provides a methodical, step-by-step re-enactment of the decade-long hunt as seen through the eyes of Maya Lambert, a fictional CIA analyst who is actually a composite of several female analysts who played key roles in locating the ever-elusive al Qaeda leader.Much has been made of the fact that the movie seemingly endorses the view that the use of torture led to the discovery of bin Laden&#8217;s whereabouts. This assertion caused such a controversy at the time of the movie&#8217;s release that many felt it ultimately hurt its chances of walking home with the Best Picture Oscar that year. In all fairness to the moviemakers, however, the film actually doesn&#8217;t seem to be making that case, since the scenes early on depicting torture all lead to eventual dead ends, while the piece of information that initially sets the investigators onto the right path clearly comes much later, after torture is no longer being used as a tactic. Yet, had the filmmakers NOT shown torture being used in the early stretches of the film - which take place not too long after 9/11 - they would not have been truthful to the times in which the story is set.But it is as a drama that we must ultimately judge &#8220;Zero Dark Thirty&#8221; - and, in that respect, the news is mainly positive. The movie stays intensely focused on the matter at hand, not allowing itself to get distracted by side forays into too many irrelevant factors or overly-detailed character back stories. Yet, while this is generally a virtue, it does result in a certain weakness as well, mainly, a lack of depth in the characters, particularly the main one. One need only compare &#8220;Zero Dark Thirty&#8221; to something like Showtime&#8216;s &#8220;Homeland&#8221; to see the advantages the long-form format has over the short-form when dealing with subjects as complex as this one. And one need only compare ZDT&#8217;s Maya with &#8220;Homeland&#8221;s Carrie (Claire Danes) to see how much more fully developed the latter is as a character. Maya is allowed to register fear, anger, frustration, determination, disappointment, etc., but we never feel that we really get to know her as a person. For one thing, we never see her in a single relationship with anyone other than her colleagues (or even hear of one mentioned, come to think of it), even though the movie spans nearly a decade.That being said, the movie does convey, through Jessica Chastain&#8217;s riveting performance, the very real toll exacted on individuals who dedicate their lives to a dogged pursuit of terrorists and who feel heavily the burden of heading off any attacks in the future. Perhaps the lack of any reference to Maya&#8217;s personal life is an implicit acknowledgment of that fact. Regardless, Chastain provides so luminous a beacon for us to follow along the journey that we can&#8217;t help but connect with the pursuit on a deeply human level.Chastain gets strong support from Jason Clark, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini and Chris Pratt (&#8220;Everwood,&#8221; &#8220;Parks and Recreation&#8221;)  in the atypical role (for him) of a heroic Navy Seal.In fact, the movie&#8217;s meticulous re-enactment of the Navy Seals&#8217; successful raid on the Abbottabad compound is alone worth the price of admission.

It is nigh impossible from most of the proceedings here to ascertain how the CIA actually located Bin Laden.  Jessica Chastain was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the film, and does an adequate job, although basically she is miscast.  And the role doesn't allow for any dramatic latitude, and degenerates into melodramatic shouting toward the end.  James Gandolfini appears briefly, and is also miscast.  So after sitting through more than two hours that drag on endlessly, you must then be subjected to an overlong, protracted sequence in which the Navy SEALs storm the compound and kill Bin Laden.  Not surprisingly, even this sequence lacks a sense of tension and excitement.  Someone keeps forgetting to tell Kathryn Bigelow that a movie needs to have some sort of dramatic arc.

A more realistic, descriptive title would have been ""The Hunt for Bin Laden.""I had major challenges with the depiction of CIA personnel.  During my 30-year Army career as a field artilleryman, I spent 12 years overseas including a combat tour in Vietnam and tours of duty as dense attach&eacute; in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel in New Delhi.  In both attach&eacute; assignments, I had close professional and personal relationships with the station chiefs and case officers.  These selfless Americans were generally much better mannered than the characters portrayed in the movie.  I found the profane language excessive and unrealistic.  I am not a prude, and I realize that during times of duress, folks resort to foul language that they would not necessary use on a routine basis.  But, I felt that the overuse of the F-bomb was uncalled for and did not depict how intelligence professionals actually conduct themselves.  The CIA officer in charge of the ""enhanced"" interrogation came across as unprofessional and somewhat cowboyish.While the defense attach&eacute; in New Delhi, I worked with members of JSOC during a prolonged hostage situation in Kashmir in 1995.

1620477,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B00AZNEW5G,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[12, 19]","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is a controversial, button pushing account of the manhunt and eventual assassination of Osama bin Laden and just how it all came to be. One's politics will most likely play a substancal role in their enjoyment of this film, I find far too few people are able to put such things aside.However, Zero Dark Thirty  wisely neither condemns nor condoles the actions of the CIA and United States military, it takes more of a journalist's eye view to it's subject matter, it is detached from it`s material. It is also a completely engrossing and engulfing, well paced crackerjack of a thriller that doesn't strive to please or entertain per se, but manages to do both quite nicely all the same.Told as a step by step procedural of the CIA's actions and involvement in the manhunt for bin Laden. But the focus is on the single minded resolve of the woman who courageously and audaciously led the hunt. This is one film that can't be critized for not providing a strong female character. As Maya, the determined CIA agent Jessica Chastain once more gives a strong and absorbing performance, she has been nominated for an Oscar for this role, her second in as many years. For my money she deserves the award, but most likely will not get it,  playing a strong, defiant and independent woman and not reducing her to a clich&eacute; action hero, damsel in distress or even attempting to make her a likable protagonist, she simply has a job to do and don't get in her way.All of this told through Bigelow's finely honed lens, previously only a good director of mostly routine and forgettable potboilers like Point Break  and Blue Steel, but also the underappreciated Strange Days and the excellent vampire/psychos on the open road neo-western Near Dark. In 2010 she became the surprise first woman to win an Academy Award for directing, which she richly deserved for the superb the Hurt Locker. Reteaming here with her Hurt Locker collaborator screenwriter Mark Boal, they have a riveting movie chemistry for making great dramatic thrillers.Zero Dark Thirty wants to be a conversation piece, it wants to make you uncomfortable The fact that it is also so entertaining is beside the point. The torture scenes, which have been much a source of debate, are graphic and unpleasant, which seems appropriate. The camerawork is not flashy, nor is it intrusive, it wisely serves as little more than just a bystander or as a witness.The dialogue is tough sounding, but realistic to the ears. Boal writes like a reporter, everything sounds over heard. The meetings with high ranking officals give us the feeling of a fly on the wall with top security clearance.The late French film critic and auteur filmmaker of the finest order Francois Truffett was quoted as saying that the best way to critize a movie was with the making of another movie. This used to be a favorite saying of Roger Ebert on the old Siskel & Ebert at the Movies TV show. I am surprised that so few have drawn any comparisons with the critically lambasted Act of Valor. In case you don't remember that one, it's the movie released earlier in 2012 that stared real life Marines in a fictional propaganda adventure film. It looked like an Army recruitment commercial, ""be all you can be"", ""it`s not a job, it`s an adventure"", etc. Zero Dark Thirty mages to be serious, where Act of Valor was silly, one is unflinching and ugly, the other a shameful misinformative ad.Bigelow it would seem now makes the hard hitting topical films that Oliver Stone used to make, someone like say John Wayne or Ronald Reagon would have loved Act of Valor, but would have been appalled by Zero Dark Thirty's resolute neo-patriotism.Zero Dark Thirty also serves as the greatest celebration of intelligence in the movies of late. Not just of government intelligence, but of the individual's hard work and dogged determination.The best movies of 2012 have also been the most controversial, From Tarantino's Django Unchained to Ben Affleck's Argo and the under seen Cloud Atlas. 2012 was a year that brought a lot of thoughts to movie screens, a lot of discussions raised, no easy answers to be found. I can't remember a year when so many films pushed so many boundaries and ran the risk of offending and alienating so many.But it is good to see so many thoughts put out there, so many daring films made and so many willing filmmakers. Maybe we are entering a new era where the term ""a thinking person's movie"" wont be meet with automatic scorn and fear from the masses. Then again, I could be wrong.The first thing we see on screen is a promise that what we are about to see is based on actual first hand accounts. One of the many sources of controversy and speculation. Some critics have laid the claimed that it is fabricated , or at least to some degree. Just a few months ago Fox news pundits claimed Bigelow had been given classified information in the making of this film(?). Oh well, it's tight and taunt and one thriller worth getting worked up about. Zero Dark Thirty is one movie that wont be forgotten, it's a new classic that we have been privileged of witnessing being born.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",5,not afraid to be

I know some details of the actual raid and events that happened after, but the effort that went into finding his hide out are all new to me. With that being said, Zero Dark Thirty is a fine piece of cinematic craftsmanship and a excellent espionage thriller. The film follows the efforts a female CIA agent named Maya who has made it her life's work to find and kill Bin Laden. We follow her as she assists in torturing captives, tracks down leads(some with results, most without) and slowly puts the pieces of a very complex and frustrating puzzle together. As the film progressed, I couldn't help but feel Maya's frustration. The film sticks to the script quite well, and we're made to follow Maya down every road she takes, whether that road leads to a break in the case or it's filled with road blocks or a dead end.Zero Dark Thirty does it's best to stick to the details, but it's a process that can leave many people in the dark(no pun intended) The process of discovering and following up on leads is a tedious one, viewers excepting an action packed film maybe disappointed. The film isn't without it's moments of pulse pounding tension. When Maya finally follows the lead that results in Bin Laden's discovery, the film's pace accelerates tremendously.As a casual viewer(i'm not a current events buff)I enjoyed Zero Dark Thirty immensely. I did find the first third of the film to be a little tedious but I think that's what Kathryn Bigelow and Co. were aiming for. The process of finding and eliminating Bin Laden was a slow and tedious process that wasn't very glamorous. The scenes of torture were left open to interpretation. I felt that the film wasn't pro or anti torture, but it was trying to show an honest portrayal of what the US was willing to do. The film wasn't trying to make a statement or be preachy, which I find to be a difficult task considering the subject matter.

I felt like a fly on the wall watching the grueling 10-year investigation in a matter of hours. And the lead actors really earned all of the accolades for making the viewer feel like they were watching footage of some amazing, horrible but actual events.Ultimately, the movie does conclude with one of the most memorable, intense and captivating 30 - 45 minutes of a movie that I've ever watched as SEAL Team 6 does their thing.

No, not the graphic violence, but that can't be helped with a story on the subject that this film is all about. But it did fill in the story during the 10 year period from 9/11/2011 until 2011 when Osama bin Laden was found and killed.Usually the Bluray is the only version with extra bonus features. But this time the DVD contains about 25 minutes worth. There is neither Director's commentary nor even the film's ""trailer"" but here are the four ""bonuses:No small feat - the ""making of"" featurette narrated mostly by Director Kathryn Bigelow. But it's waaaaay too short at just 3:52.The Compound - this 9-minute featurette focuses on the bin Laden compound where he was discovered and where the final 30 minutes of the 2 -hour film takes place. The replicated set was built in Jordan in three weeks and Producer/Screenwriter Mark Boal takes the viewer on a guided tour of the set. This is well worth seeingGeared Up - is a 7-minute featurette that shows how the actors were trained by Navy Seals in the mission and reveals that some of the crew in those final scenes were actual  former serviceman.Targeting Jessica Chastain - is the weakest feature. It's 5 minutes of the cast talking about how good an actress Chastain is in the role of Maya.What's missing here - besides a longer ""making of"" feature is the story behind the real life Maya character - the young CIA agent who set out to find bin Laden and capture him - dead or alive.This is not a film to watch before you go to bed - there are too many strong images.

1620503,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00AZNEW5G,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Can you make a good movie from a bad script? Yes, and that movie is called Zero Dark Thirty.Most of the film is the informative, though poorly told, story of a young woman at the CIA whose job and obsession is to find Osama Bin Laden. We are given vital pieces of information, and experience the frustrations, of this global manhunt. Along the way, unfortunately, the petty `n' plucky heroine has to constantly assert herself as correct. She just thinks something is so, and then it becomes right. She is so infallible that it is both exhausting and eye-rolling to watch her. She is also so arrogant it makes her impossible to root for; in the film's most ludicrous line, she states that she believes her colleagues died and she survived because she is ""meant"" to find Bin Laden. What?Fortunately, it all comes together in the last 30 minutes or so. The climax, a retelling of the operation that killed Bin Laden, is so well told and thrilling that it almost makes up for the rest of the film. Better yet, the information we were told throughout the film (what is Bin Laden's complex like? who will be there?) helps orient us during what is an otherwise dark and jerky sequence. This was a prime example of quality filmmaking, which most of the movie could not live up to.There has been much controversy over the film's torture sequences; I personally did not find much stock in them, but that is up to the viewer to decide. What I found interesting was how it didn't seem to take much for interrogators to resort to waterboarding; whether that is fiction or fact, I don't know.Which is what makes my critique of the film a bit reserved - without knowing the facts, I don't know how far I can criticize the film.

As a civil obligation, people should know the 9/11 events and aftermath --  whether you prefer to inform yourself through the variety of ""news shows"" or documentaries, or be entertained in the process (like this movie), this is important current history.  Given the hundreds of reviews, I can't add more to them.  The film is 2 parts --  the 10-year manhunt and the take-down.  Typically, viewers complained about the slow pace of the manhunt that resulted in a dead end.  The take-down is often described as riveting.This is not an action-thriller, but a ""docu-drama"" so I don't know how the director (Kathryn Bigelow, an ex- of James Cameron, an insufferable but talented director) could deliver anything more than what she did.The ramp-up to the mission was too long ? . . . well, my takeaway is that the director wanted to us to see that after something like 10-years and apparently no leads for 4-6 years, the US establishment looking for bin Laden became fatigued, lackadaisical or less audacious, and it took some low grade analyst(s) and mid-level bosses to undertake career ending moves to get a mission approved, and fulfilled something reportedly said to bin Laden when the 9/11 attacks happened: ""If you did that to the Americans, they will hunt you down and kill you."" (or something like that).Along with being an interesting film, there are also interesting film making stories:  it brought Megan Ellison, then 26-year old trust fund daughter of Larry Ellison of Oracle Software, recognition as movie producer that she typically avoids; how they recruited Jessica Chastain for the Maya role which Ms. Chastain could not at first accept; and even as a movie about the most signicant person/event/episode in American History since December 7, 1941, funding for this movie was not a big sell.  This is a fantastic effort to artistically record (although Mark Boal, the reporter & screen writer would prefer technical acknowledgement) this generation's most significant event which will still impact the US for many years to come.

Maya loses friends in the field.Her fanaticalpursuit of Bin Laden helps to neutralise moral qualms.Bigelow eases liberal guilt by showing the effect on the torturer's sensitivity,Maya pays a cost,having no love or relationships.Our instincts tell us there is something wrong here.To normalise torture(we see Obama saying they don't use torture),is to remove ethical principles.It directly implies the use of torure led directly to the location of OBL(Abbadabad).That said the thriller/action techniques of Bigelow(as proved in Hurt Locker),the film editing/writing are good,the chapter-like structure,the casting of Chastain where her intelligence is underscored by a ferocious determination,"" I believed I was spared so I could finish the job"".This is an emotionless and cold-hearted film so much so that the climactic raid has no energy or urgency,the role of the Navy Seals is de-emphasised,ciphers in a computer game.Sorry Syriana and Homeland did this so much better.Chastain does not carry the moral weight.",3,Political to its soulless core,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,2634,"['Saw', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'was', 'not', 'impressed.It', 'centres', 'woman', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'location', 'Pakistan', 'Afghanistan', 'pursuing', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'use', 'torture.She', 'torture', 'first', 'seen', 'flinch', 'soon', 'able', 'accept', 'female', 'heroine', 'not', 'action', 'hero', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'gung-ho', 'approach', 'male', 'directors.As', 'feminist', 'subject', 'using', 'woman.The', 'film', 'opening', 'dark', 'screen', 'phone', 'call', 'woman', 'trapped', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'burn', 'death.Then', 'film', 'immediately', 'scenes', 'torture', 'cause', 'effect.Because', 'have', 'been', 'assured', 'film', 'based', 'first', 'person', 'accounts', 'Bigelow', 'said', 'depict', 'not', 'endorse', 'are', 'made', 'feel', 'are', 'getting', 'first', 'draft', 'history', 'journalistic', 'account', 'claimto', 'apolitical', 'neutrality', 'false.Bigelow', 'patriotic', 'status', 'quo.This', 'CIA-biased', 'film', 'right', 'wing', 'core.It', 'objective', 'give', 'meaning', 'killing', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'showing', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'following', '9/11', 'Khobar', 'Towers', 'Islamabad', 'Marriott', 'as', 'well', 'unbridled', 'CIA', 'response.The', 'war', 'terror', 'seen', 'justified', 'black', 'sites', 'CIA', 'investigators', 'Dan', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'seek', 'information', 'whereabouts', 'al-Qaeda', 'leader', 'using', 'soft', 'hard', 'techniqueslike', 'water-boarding', 'giving', 'soft', 'drink', 'suspect', 'treating', 'dog', 'chatting', 'mate.To', 'depict', 'torture', 'neutrally', 'already', 'kind', 'endorsement.Bigelow', 'shown', 'be', 'side', 'torture', 'Maya', 'friends', 'field.Her', 'fanaticalpursuit', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'neutralise', 'moral', 'qualms.Bigelow', 'liberal', 'guilt', 'showing', 'effect', 'torturer', 'sensitivity', 'Maya', 'cost', 'having', 'love', 'relationships.Our', 'instincts', 'tell', 'something', 'wrong', 'here.To', 'normalise', 'torture', 'see', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'torture', 'remove', 'ethical', 'principles.It', 'directly', 'use', 'torure', 'led', 'directly', 'location', 'OBL', 'Abbadabad', 'said', 'thriller/action', 'techniques', 'Bigelow', 'proved', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'film', 'editing/writing', 'are', 'good', 'chapter-like', 'structure', 'casting', 'Chastain', 'where', 'intelligence', 'underscored', 'ferocious', 'determination', 'believed', 'was', 'spared', 'so', 'could', 'finish', 'job', '.This', 'emotionless', 'cold-hearted', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'climactic', 'raid', 'energy', 'urgency', 'role', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'de-emphasised', 'ciphers', 'computer', 'game.Sorry', 'Syriana', 'Homeland', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'better.Chastain', 'not', 'carry', 'moral', 'weight']",N/A

What this propagandist does not tell you is the fact that the movie is based on real events that the government wants you to believe.Now the cat is out of the bag.  The fact is that the scriptwriter of the film, Mark Boal, admits the CIA vetted the script for his film.  In fact, he would be in constant contact with the CIA to see how he should write an event, if they liked it, or to remove parts from the script they deemed unfavorable.So, basically, the CIA helped produce a propaganda piece that show torturers as heroes.  I guess they need cover from future prosecution.  The fact is torture never helped in locating Osama Bin Laden.  However, if you watch the film, it shows torture as one of the leading tools in aiding in the capture of bin Laden.  I wonder why that is.How saddening is it that Bigelow and Boal have allowed themselves to be used in such a horrific way?  Then again, if you are collecting the Benjamins, does it make it easier to engage in such an activity.  More importantly, what does it say about Hollywood and our mainstream media outlets?  If we can't trust the fact that the information is independent of government influence, should we even watch it?I guess their next film will be about how the NSA's spying program of all Americans is a necessary and legal thing to do.

It starts off with 9-11. Maya is a composite character. The CIA is not as dumb as this film portrays. She visits CIA black sites around the world through their revolving door. It appears as if she got all the intelligence on her own. We know this was not the case.In comparison, I must say ""Seal Team Six"" was a far better film as far as plot. What this film offers is an obsessed Jessica Chastain who borders on insanity. Her character seemed unrealistic at times, but compelling at other times.Much has been made about the politics of this film which I found they took great lengths to be non-controversial. Sometimes facts have a bias to them. There is excessive torture at the beginning of the film. Information is gathered from people that have been tortured, but not necessarily because of it, as there is a disconnect between the two events. The audience is allowed to decide on its effectiveness. Seal Team Six appears late in the film, almost as an afterthought. The other film was superior in presenting the Navy Seals.Obama and Bush aren't mentioned per se. Obama appears speaking in the background on TV. There is a new policy concerning torture that is alluded to, but the details are not given. One remark was, ""You don't want to be the one caught holding the dog collar.""There is a reluctance on the part of some to invade the Bin Laden compound due to the WMD/Iraq disaster although no blame is specifically placed.Chastain does an excellent job and is the best aspect of this feature. In an idea world she would have played Maya in ""Seal Team Six."" I found the political criticisms unwarranted as was the praise given to this film when ""Seal Team Six"" was clearly the superior production in presenting the tale.

1620525,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00AZNEW5G,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 3]","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a movie about the many individuals and agencies dedicated to locating the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.  Director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") focuses on one CIA analyst, Maya (Jessica Chastain), who is based on an actual person.The film begins with the interrogation of a terrorist and the use of various forms of torture -- principally water boarding -- by fellow agent Dan (Jason Clarke) as Maya watches emotionless.  The techniques are geared to extract information to help narrow the search for bin Laden.  Bigelow makes no editorial statement here about the morality of such means; she treats them as a standard interrogation techniques.  From this graphic opening, we are introduced to the teams of men and women who work diligently to put together bits of Internet chatter, surveillance tapes, anonymous tips, and phone conversations to postulate where bin Laden is hiding.Maya's sole assignment is the search for bin Laden and she is consumed by the task.  She has no serious relationship, no friends, and not much of a life outside her job.  She believes the key to locating bin Laden is to find and follow his trusted courier.  However, this won't be easy, since the courier is extremely careful in covering his own tracks.""Zero Dark Thirty"" rises above other political thrillers because it is not burdened with or slowed down by unnecessary romantic entangements, comic relief, or cliche.  In straightforward fashion, Ms. Bigelow takes us through the behind-the-scenes operations of the CIA as it juggles information, spends billions, and is under enormous pressure to get resultsWe see or hear of terrorist attacks that occur after 9/11 in other parts of the world:  recreations of several terrorist bombings and an attack on a CIA compound.  These scenes show the deadly result of the terrorists' perseverence, but there are many equally dramatic scenes set in offices with analysts using their computers and technical data to assemble a picture of a network that might lead to bin Laden.  There is a constant sense of urgency and determination.  These folks don't engage in idle office small talk.  They recognize the importance of their work and coordinate with field agents to close in on their prey.Ms. Chastain plays Maya as an intelligent, sometimes inappropriately outspoken team member with an amazing ability to recognize clues, piece them together, and convince her superiors to bankroll field operations that will net her the next piece of valuable information, building her quest -- one piece at a time -- for the world's foremost terrorist.Maya is heroic in a low-key manner atypical of Hollywood.  She stands by in an office or watches operations on surveillance cameras while soldiers and CIA agents do the dangerous legwork.  If this were a Sylvester Stallone or Jason Statham movie, the stars would singlehandedly find and kill bin Laden.Making the central character a person who thinks through and facilitates a plan rather than shoots her way through it may not sound exciting, but it is.  Ms. Bigelow rivets the viewer from the beginning, taking us through an elaborate procedural in which the outcome is known.  It's how it gets to the outcome that makes this movie special.Mark Boal's script chronicles the Navy SEALS operation that resulted in the death of bin Laden, but this is only one part of the picture.  Its most interesting aspect is depicting how incredibly difficult anti-terrorism is and how many sharp minds are incorporated to fight it.The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack's bonus extras include a making-of featurette, focus on the role of Maya, a tour of the movie's rebuilt compound, and footage of the cast training with authentic SEALS gear.

1620526,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00AZNEW5G,The Mysterious Traveler,"[14, 54]","So I saw ZERO DARK THIRTY yesterday and seemed to have discovered a new liberal film genre. Begining with CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, Hollywood will rewrite history so that a noble and all wise Democrat somehow saves America from enemies the Democrats spent years aiding and abetting. So here..like the very similar ARGO, we have potty talking CIA agents by way of Quentin Tarrantino defeating non-Islamic Muslim terrorists under the guidance of a noble and all wise Democrat President.Joseph Goebbells always said was the the most effective way of shoveling propaganda was to sprinkle it throughout a reasonably entertaining story. So we have it here...almost exactly the same way for the third time in a row. So under the guise of the search for Osame Bin Ladin, a group of CIA agents who speak some form of English involving copious use of the F word that only they--but unfortunately not the viewer can understand(Muslims however NEVER curse), we get subjected to the same usual rubbish against the George Bush administration involving repeated use of the word TORTURE and WMDs and IRAQ for the film's first hour then there is a pause where they quietly and humbly listen to a speech by Barack Obama about TORTURE. This is soon followed by a speech about how the Obama administration would NEVER do anything for political reasons and another one right after about how what a SUPER GENIUS Barack Obama is.Meanwhile to keep the viewer's attention away from all this indoctrination and lying, we are subjected to an incomprehensible first hour having something to do with ""couriers"" and beards. Jessica Chastain's performance is heralded but all she is doing is a Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully impersonation. No one else in the film is memorable and the director Bigelow does an incompetent job of keeping the other characters straight. There is a guy with a beard but then he shaves it off and then grows in back again. I think.FINALLY we track down Osama Bin Ladin and we are subjected to a raid sequences filmed in almost complete blackness. Literally. There are long sequences where the screen is completely dark. Guess it was a way of saving money???There has been much nonsense about Katherine Bigelow being compared to Leni Reifensthal but, after seeing the film, one must conclude this was some twisted liberal attempt to lure ""conservatives"" aka normal people into the theater since they believe that anyone NOT THEM must be Nazis and therefore would enjoy the fictional torture scenes. Of course such a comparison also implies that Miss Bigelow actually has talent as a director--which she most assuredly does not. Besides an inability to tell a complex..or indeed even a straight forward story coherently, she has nil talent at rendering character. Everyone--except Scully--is interchangable and impossible to remember or keep track of. The film is a dramtic flatline. About as moving as watching a video a frog being dissected.At the very end after she has finally killed Bin Ladin, instead of it being a triumph of American arms and capability, Scully starts crying---as I imagine Liberals in the audience were doing over the death of their great hero. Or perhaps she is blubbering to allow liberals to smirk as they shriek SEE KILLING NEVER SOLVED ANYTHING! FIGHTING THE TERRORISTS IS POINTLESS! WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?""Or maybe Scully just has to pee and there is no bathroom on the plane?Who knows?Who cares.Not a great film. Not a bad filmNice double feature with FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2...ah...I mean ARGO.Guess we can expect a film about how James Buchanan won the Civil War or how Grover Cleveland won the Spanish American War any day now?PS if Bigelow is Leni Reifensthal, that would make Obama...............................?",2,The Liberal FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,3749,"['So', 'saw', 'ZERO', 'DARK', 'THIRTY', 'yesterday', 'seemed', 'have', 'discovered', 'new', 'liberal', 'film', 'genre', 'Begining', 'CHARLIE', 'WILSON', 'WAR', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'rewrite', 'history', 'noble', 'wise', 'Democrat', 'somehow', 'saves', 'America', 'Democrats', 'spent', 'years', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'So', 'very', 'similar', 'ARGO', 'have', 'potty', 'talking', 'CIA', 'agents', 'way', 'Quentin', 'Tarrantino', 'defeating', 'non-Islamic', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'guidance', 'noble', 'wise', 'Democrat', 'President.Joseph', 'Goebbells', 'always', 'said', 'was', 'most', 'effective', 'way', 'shoveling', 'propaganda', 'was', 'sprinkle', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'story', 'have', 'here', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'third', 'time', 'row', 'guise', 'search', 'Osame', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'group', 'CIA', 'agents', 'who', 'speak', 'form', 'English', 'involving', 'copious', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'only', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'viewer', 'can', 'understand', 'Muslims', 'however', 'NEVER', 'curse', 'get', 'subjected', 'same', 'usual', 'rubbish', 'George', 'Bush', 'administration', 'involving', 'repeated', 'use', 'word', 'TORTURE', 'WMDs', 'IRAQ', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'pause', 'where', 'quietly', 'humbly', 'listen', 'speech', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'TORTURE', 'soon', 'followed', 'speech', 'how', 'Obama', 'administration', 'would', 'NEVER', 'do', 'anything', 'political', 'reasons', 'one', 'right', 'how', 'what', 'SUPER', 'GENIUS', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'is.Meanwhile', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'away', 'indoctrination', 'lying', 'are', 'subjected', 'incomprehensible', 'first', 'hour', 'having', 'something', 'do', 'couriers', 'beards', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'performance', 'heralded', 'doing', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'impersonation', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'memorable', 'director', 'Bigelow', 'incompetent', 'job', 'keeping', 'other', 'characters', 'straight', 'guy', 'beard', 'then', 'off', 'then', 'grows', 'back', 'again', 'think.FINALLY', 'track', 'down', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'are', 'subjected', 'raid', 'sequences', 'filmed', 'almost', 'complete', 'blackness', 'Literally', 'are', 'long', 'sequences', 'where', 'screen', 'completely', 'dark', 'Guess', 'was', 'way', 'saving', 'money', 'been', 'much', 'nonsense', 'Katherine', 'Bigelow', 'being', 'compared', 'Leni', 'Reifensthal', 'seeing', 'film', 'one', 'must', 'conclude', 'was', 'twisted', 'liberal', 'attempt', 'lure', 'conservatives', 'normal', 'people', 'theater', 'believe', 'anyone', 'NOT', 'THEM', 'must', 'be', 'Nazis', 'therefore', 'would', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'torture', 'scenes', 'course', 'such', 'comparison', 'also', 'Miss', 'Bigelow', 'actually', 'talent', 'director', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'inability', 'tell', 'complex..or', 'indeed', 'even', 'straight', 'forward', 'story', 'coherently', 'nil', 'talent', 'rendering', 'character', 'Everyone', 'Scully', 'interchangable', 'impossible', 'remember', 'keep', 'track', 'film', 'dramtic', 'flatline', 'as', 'moving', 'watching', 'video', 'frog', 'being', 'dissected.At', 'very', 'end', 'finally', 'killed', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'instead', 'being', 'triumph', 'American', 'arms', 'capability', 'Scully', 'crying', '-as', 'imagine', 'Liberals', 'audience', 'were', 'doing', 'death', 'great', 'hero', 'perhaps', 'blubbering', 'allow', 'liberals', 'smirk', 'shriek', 'SEE', 'KILLING', 'NEVER', 'SOLVED', 'ANYTHING', 'TERRORISTS', 'IS', 'POINTLESS', 'WHAT', 'DIFFERENCE', 'IT', 'MAKE', 'maybe', 'Scully', 'just', 'pee', 'bathroom', 'plane', 'Who', 'Who', 'great', 'film', 'Not', 'bad', 'filmNice', 'double', 'feature', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'PART', '2', 'ah', 'mean', 'can', 'expect', 'film', 'how', 'James', 'Buchanan', 'won', 'Civil', 'War', 'how', 'Grover', 'Cleveland', 'won', 'Spanish', 'American', 'War', 'day', 'now', 'PS', 'Bigelow', 'Leni', 'Reifensthal', 'would', 'make', 'Obama']",N/A

1620530,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B00AZNEW5G,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[10, 16]","Zero Dark Thirty (2012) is the best movie that I've seen in 2013. The story is gripping, the acting is outstanding, and you walk away feeling that you've witnessed something significant and moving.Jessica Chastain plays Maya, an intelligence officer obsessed with finding Usama Bin Laden (""UBL""). Maya spends about ten years of her life chasing various meandering leads, pressing her superiors to follow her research and hunches, and finally, as we know, all the zealous effort results in a monumental and historical raid and kill. Chastain is great as Maya; you won't recognize her in comparison to her performance as the ditzy, blond stay-at-home wife in The Help. The access that the filmmakers must have had to CIA and other intelligence personnel to create Maya's character made the story and character true to form, even if some of it turns out to be false.The torture scenes during the first  of the film are over-hyped. I was expecting much worse. By today's movie violence standards, the torture was tame and not gruesome. The unwarranted controversy that Zero Dark Thirty has created stems from the implication that torture led to information, which led to UBL's comeuppance. That implication is clear, but I did not walk away thinking that this film condones torture or ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" On the contrary, later in the film it becomes clear that the intelligence community's use of such tactics has been criticized publicly and politically, actually jeopardizing the license to conduct an all-out manhunt by any means. To say that a message of this film is that ""torture works"" is incorrect.UBL is only in a few minutes of this film, but Maya's obsession with finding him makes him a of pot of gold or trophy. We learn a lot about how Al Qaeda ran its operations in the 2000s, relying upon some very primitive means of communication (basically person-to-person) to spread messages between key operatives and their underlings. UBL was at the top, but he was in deep hiding for years after 9/11. The interspersing of scenes of other terrorist acts linked to or credited to Al Qaeda builds the drama and importance of bagging the trophy, UBL.The portrayal of the raid of UBL's fortress in Pakistan is brilliantly executed. It is believable. It is terrifying. It is, ultimately, gratifying. Knowing that things went wrong during the raid (a helicopter crash, for instance), leaving the top folks in U.S. government on pins and needles for dozens of harrowing, nail-biting minutes, this portion of the film has a tinge of dread throughout. You are just waiting for a Navy Seal to get shot, stabbed, or maimed. When they ""get their man,"" the reactions of relief, disbelief, pride, and a continued focus on completing the mission are great acting and filmmaking.See this film. It may not be a History Channel documentary and, therefore, its accuracy is not beyond question, but as entertainment it is top notch. You can't ask much more of your movie than to build human drama, create procedural suspense, and execute fast-moving action in a carefully constructed package.",5,Outstanding procedural drama.,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3093,"['Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', '2012', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2013', 'story', 'gripping', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'something', 'significant', 'moving.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'plays', 'Maya', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'Usama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'UBL', 'Maya', 'ten', 'years', 'life', 'chasing', 'various', 'meandering', 'leads', 'pressing', 'superiors', 'follow', 'research', 'hunches', 'finally', 'know', 'zealous', 'effort', 'results', 'monumental', 'historical', 'raid', 'kill', 'Chastain', 'great', 'Maya', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'comparison', 'performance', 'ditzy', 'blond', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'Help', 'access', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'CIA', 'other', 'intelligence', 'personnel', 'create', 'Maya', 'character', 'made', 'story', 'character', 'true', 'form', 'even', 'out', 'be', 'false.The', 'torture', 'scenes', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'over-hyped', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'worse', 'today', 'movie', 'violence', 'standards', 'torture', 'was', 'tame', 'not', 'gruesome', 'unwarranted', 'controversy', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'created', 'stems', 'implication', 'torture', 'led', 'information', 'led', 'UBL', 'comeuppance', 'implication', 'clear', 'did', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'thinking', 'film', 'torture', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'contrary', 'later', 'film', 'clear', 'intelligence', 'community', 'use', 'such', 'tactics', 'been', 'criticized', 'publicly', 'politically', 'actually', 'jeopardizing', 'license', 'conduct', 'all-out', 'manhunt', 'means', 'say', 'message', 'film', 'torture', 'works', 'incorrect.UBL', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Maya', 'obsession', 'finding', 'pot', 'gold', 'trophy', 'learn', 'lot', 'how', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'ran', 'operations', '2000s', 'relying', 'very', 'primitive', 'means', 'communication', 'basically', 'person-to-person', 'spread', 'messages', 'key', 'operatives', 'underlings', 'UBL', 'was', 'top', 'was', 'deep', 'hiding', 'years', '9/11', 'interspersing', 'scenes', 'other', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'linked', 'credited', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'drama', 'importance', 'bagging', 'trophy', 'UBL.The', 'portrayal', 'raid', 'UBL', 'fortress', 'Pakistan', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'believable', 'terrifying', 'ultimately', 'gratifying', 'Knowing', 'things', 'went', 'wrong', 'raid', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'instance', 'leaving', 'top', 'folks', 'U.S.', 'government', 'pins', 'needles', 'dozens', 'harrowing', 'nail-biting', 'minutes', 'portion', 'film', 'tinge', 'dread', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'get', 'shot', 'stabbed', 'maimed', 'When', 'get', 'man', 'reactions', 'relief', 'disbelief', 'pride', 'continued', 'focus', 'completing', 'mission', 'are', 'great', 'acting', 'filmmaking.See', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'therefore', 'accuracy', 'not', 'question', 'entertainment', 'top', 'notch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'build', 'human', 'drama', 'create', 'procedural', 'suspense', 'execute', 'fast-moving', 'action', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'package']",N/A

The final scene as Maya, all alone, boards a huge empty transport to go (where?) clearly shows that her career is toast at the CIA because she continually bucked the brass to get things done, even when she was warned to lay off. That's a cardinal sin. She will pay, and she knows it. The only reason she was able to continue her hunt was that some people in the Obama White House took an interest in her work and kept it alive. Without that angle, Langley was ready to crush her early on.Had the CIA actually been happy with her exploits, the final scene would have had her on board the CIA director's private jet, being hailed by her supportive colleagues amid popping champagne corks, flying to Langley for a celebration honoring her achievement. But no. In the end, bureaucracy always triumphs.Let it be be a lesson to would-be government employees: no matter what the agency--any agency--says its goals are, the real goals of everyone in the place is to avoid risk, avoid making waves, and getting promotions, all the while calculating the growth in one's 401Ks and maximizing vacation and retirement bennies.

On September 11, 2001 the United States was attacked by a group of terrorists taking orders from Osama Bin Laden. Following that attack the intelligence agency of the US began a man hunt for him to bring him to justice. Ten years later with the help of Seal Team 6 he was taken down. This is the story of the man hunt. I love movies that are based on real events but they are sometimes hit or miss. The hardest part for a movie like this where the events have just happened is to keep it interesting and keep you watching even though you know the end. This movie succeeded beyond all hope. Much like Apollo 13 when the climax happens you are on the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens even though you know the outcome. That is what makes this movie great. Also Bigelow has almost a Spielberg like quality to take hardcore war movies like this and Hurt Locker and transform them into movies that rely on great actors and not just the action. As great and exciting as this movie was Jessica Chastain was incredible in this and she is one of the reasons you get so involved with the story.

1620548,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00AZNEW5G,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In a way Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very ambitious movie, probably more ambitious than her previous ""The Hurt Locker"" in that her new thriller deals with a more recent event: death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.For some (or most) potential viewers, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" will not be what they expect. If you are looking for a more dramatic and action-packed fact-based thriller, you may find Bigelow's slow-paced narrative style frustrating. Sometimes there are so many details going on, that though each sequence is absorbing, the 157-film film itself feels too long and uneven.Jessica Chastain plays Maya, the film's protagonist about whom we know nothing about, except that she is determined to track down Osama bin Laden. Chastain's strong acting effectively shows us the change her character must undergo over the course of the investigation, though the reason for her determination, or obsession, is not explained.Some reviewers compare the semi-documentary approach of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to that of ""Zodiac,"" a David Fincher film made in 2007. In both, we audiences know where the film is going. We expect the process of revealing the truth to be concise and clear (possibly with a character we can identify with), while the film gives only detailed accounts of events, which mat look real but feel drawn-out.Though I prefer a more accessible approach with a faster narrative and characters with back stories, I found ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to be a rewarding experience, even though I admit I had to be very patient at times trying to follow the narrative thread.",4,(3.5 STARS) Too Long But Ultimately Rewarding Experience,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1583,"['way', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'very', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'probably', 'more', 'ambitious', 'previous', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'new', 'thriller', 'deals', 'more', 'recent', 'event', 'death', 'al-Qaeda', 'leader', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden.For', 'most', 'potential', 'viewers', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'expect', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'dramatic', 'action-packed', 'fact-based', 'thriller', 'may', 'find', 'Bigelow', 'slow-paced', 'narrative', 'style', 'frustrating', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'going', 'sequence', 'absorbing', '157-film', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'uneven.Jessica', 'Chastain', 'plays', 'Maya', 'film', 'protagonist', 'whom', 'know', 'nothing', 'determined', 'track', 'down', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Chastain', 'strong', 'acting', 'effectively', 'change', 'character', 'must', 'undergo', 'course', 'investigation', 'reason', 'determination', 'obsession', 'not', 'explained.Some', 'reviewers', 'compare', 'semi-documentary', 'approach', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Zodiac', 'David', 'Fincher', 'film', 'made', '2007', 'audiences', 'know', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'expect', 'process', 'revealing', 'truth', 'be', 'concise', 'clear', 'possibly', 'character', 'can', 'identify', 'film', 'only', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'events', 'mat', 'look', 'real', 'feel', 'drawn-out.Though', 'prefer', 'more', 'accessible', 'approach', 'faster', 'narrative', 'characters', 'back', 'stories', 'found', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'be', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'even', 'admit', 'had', 'be', 'very', 'patient', 'times', 'trying', 'follow', 'narrative', 'thread']",N/A
1620549,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AZNEW5G,Turfseer,"[3, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Emboldened by her big Oscar win for 'Hurt Locker', Director Kathryn Bigelow was determined to fry some bigger fish, by taking on the herculean task of chronicling the 10 year manhunt for America's most wanted man: Osama bin Laden. Initially, Bigelow partnered with screenwriter Mark Boal, to write about the failed attempt to catch Bin Laden at Tora Bora. Everything changed when bin Laden was caught and disposed of, so Boal scrapped the Tora Bora script and hashed out a new one rather quickly, featuring the now famous mission that resulted in bin Laden's demise.Bigelow's strategy was to create a composite character based on the exploits of numerous CIA agents who were involved in tracking down and eventually uncovering bin Laden's infamous lair. She ended up creating 'Maya' (Jessica Chastain), after hearing about one particular female CIA agent involved in bin Laden's capture. As Rex Reed correctly notes in 'The Observer,' there was no evidence that the hunt for bin Laden was the exclusive province of one woman. In Reed's opinion, Bigelow's desire to create a ""Wonder Woman"" character backfires, as it ends up that ""Ms. Chastain's stoic, textbook approach to the role does nothing to illuminate or enlighten.""The bigger problem with 'Zero Dark Thirty' that it's inherently undramatic. Maya is never pitted against a concrete antagonist, who she must butt heads with. In its place are a coterie of both individual terrorists who we get to know for only a short time (Ammar Al-Baluchi, who's water boarded due to his 9/11 connections, or faceless terrorists, such as the ones who attempt to assassinate Maya, when she attempts to drive out of the US Embassy in Pakistan). Bigelow ends up connecting her fictional Maya through sleight of hand: suddenly she just happens to be eating dinner at the Islamabaad Hotel, when it's blown up in 2008 or her good CIA friend Jessica, is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. It's all good journalism, but Maya's individual drama, feels forced. When Maya does butt heads, it's merely with one of her CIA bosses, who's slow to act on her intelligence, due to orders from above (the new Obama administration certainly is proceeding too slowly for the veteran analyst's tastes).After a series of drawn out CIA torture scenes, as well as the aforementioned historical scenes straight from the CNN breaking news play book, Bigelow's and Boal's journalistic 'research', pays some dividends when we're made privy to the way in which the CIA (Maya) tracks down bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, who eventually leads them to bin Laden himself. Perhaps the most interesting scene in the film, is the way in which Ahmed is tracked down while driving his SUV (he's located through his cell phone signals).While I would argue Bigelow is way overrated in the script department, she does know how to use a camera. The final scene, where the crack team of Navy Seals invades bin Laden's compound, and finishes him off, is expertly choreographed and actually somewhat nail biting (even though everyone knows the outcome).Still, I'll argue Ms. Bigelow is a vastly overrated director, another Hollywood 'flavor of the month' (usually 'flavors of the month', can last a good number of years, before they lose their taste). It's understandable, given the fact that there have been few female directors singled out as significant by the Hollywood powers that be, that suddenly Bigelow finds herself in the spotlight. In Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow and Boal mistakenly assumed that by merely clipping a few newspaper articles and conducting a few interviews with people connected to the CIA and then inserting a composite character into the action, that's enough to create a compelling story. Their 'mistake' still paid dividends: the overwhelming body of critics as well as a liberal general public, overjoyed by the liberal Obama administration 'win', rubber stamped an ordinary film, as a masterpiece!",2,Critics and liberal public seduced by overrated journalism exercise masquerading as compelling drama,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,3991,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', '5.0Emboldened', 'big', 'Oscar', 'win', ""'Hurt"", 'Locker', 'Director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'determined', 'fry', 'bigger', 'fish', 'taking', 'herculean', 'task', 'chronicling', '10', 'year', 'manhunt', 'America', 'most', 'wanted', 'man', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Initially', 'Bigelow', 'partnered', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'write', 'failed', 'attempt', 'catch', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'Everything', 'changed', 'when', 'bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'caught', 'disposed', 'Boal', 'scrapped', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'script', 'hashed', 'out', 'new', 'one', 'rather', 'quickly', 'featuring', 'now', 'famous', 'mission', 'resulted', 'bin', 'Laden', 'demise.Bigelow', 'strategy', 'was', 'create', 'composite', 'character', 'based', 'exploits', 'numerous', 'CIA', 'agents', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'tracking', 'down', 'eventually', 'uncovering', 'bin', 'Laden', 'infamous', 'lair', 'ended', 'up', 'creating', ""'Maya"", 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'hearing', 'one', 'particular', 'female', 'CIA', 'agent', 'involved', 'bin', 'Laden', 'capture', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'correctly', ""'The"", 'Observer', 'was', 'evidence', 'hunt', 'bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'exclusive', 'province', 'one', 'woman', 'Reed', 'opinion', 'Bigelow', 'desire', 'create', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'character', 'backfires', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Chastain', 'stoic', 'textbook', 'approach', 'role', 'nothing', 'illuminate', 'enlighten', 'bigger', 'problem', ""'Zero"", 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'inherently', 'undramatic', 'Maya', 'never', 'pitted', 'concrete', 'antagonist', 'who', 'must', 'butt', 'heads', 'place', 'are', 'coterie', 'individual', 'terrorists', 'who', 'get', 'know', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'Ammar', 'Al-Baluchi', 'who', 'water', 'boarded', 'due', '9/11', 'connections', 'faceless', 'terrorists', 'such', 'ones', 'who', 'attempt', 'assassinate', 'Maya', 'when', 'drive', 'US', 'Embassy', 'Pakistan', 'Bigelow', 'up', 'connecting', 'fictional', 'Maya', 'sleight', 'hand', 'suddenly', 'just', 'be', 'eating', 'dinner', 'Islamabaad', 'Hotel', 'when', 'blown', 'up', '2008', 'good', 'CIA', 'friend', 'Jessica', 'killed', '2009', 'Camp', 'Chapman', 'attack', 'good', 'journalism', 'Maya', 'individual', 'drama', 'feels', 'forced', 'When', 'Maya', 'butt', 'heads', 'merely', 'one', 'CIA', 'bosses', 'who', 'slow', 'act', 'intelligence', 'due', 'orders', 'new', 'Obama', 'administration', 'certainly', 'proceeding', 'too', 'slowly', 'veteran', 'analyst', 'tastes', '.After', 'series', 'drawn', 'out', 'CIA', 'torture', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'historical', 'scenes', 'straight', 'CNN', 'breaking', 'news', 'play', 'book', 'Bigelow', 'Boal', 'journalistic', ""'research"", 'dividends', 'when', ""'re"", 'made', 'privy', 'way', 'CIA', 'Maya', 'down', 'Laden', 'courier', 'Abu', 'Ahmed', 'who', 'eventually', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'scene', 'film', 'way', 'Ahmed', 'tracked', 'down', 'driving', 'SUV', 'located', 'cell', 'phone', 'signals', 'would', 'argue', 'Bigelow', 'way', 'overrated', 'script', 'department', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'camera', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'crack', 'team', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'bin', 'Laden', 'compound', 'finishes', 'off', 'expertly', 'choreographed', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'nail', 'biting', 'even', 'everyone', 'outcome', '.Still', ""'ll"", 'argue', 'Ms.', 'Bigelow', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'director', 'Hollywood', ""'flavor"", 'month', 'usually', ""'flavors"", 'month', 'can', 'last', 'good', 'number', 'years', 'lose', 'taste', 'understandable', 'given', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'female', 'directors', 'singled', 'out', 'significant', 'Hollywood', 'powers', 'be', 'suddenly', 'Bigelow', 'spotlight', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Bigelow', 'Boal', 'mistakenly', 'assumed', 'merely', 'clipping', 'few', 'newspaper', 'articles', 'conducting', 'few', 'interviews', 'people', 'connected', 'CIA', 'then', 'inserting', 'composite', 'character', 'action', 'enough', 'create', 'compelling', 'story', ""'mistake"", 'still', 'paid', 'dividends', 'overwhelming', 'body', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'liberal', 'general', 'public', 'overjoyed', 'liberal', 'Obama', 'administration', ""'win"", 'rubber', 'stamped', 'ordinary', 'film', 'masterpiece']",N/A
