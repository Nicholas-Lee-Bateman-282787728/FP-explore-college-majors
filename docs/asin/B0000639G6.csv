The characters are mentioned briefly or are in small roles here and it really isn't necessary to know the original story to enjoy this film. This film treats the secret garden as magical as the garden door simply disappears when the door is shut. Overall the story is cute, the actors are sweet, but the garden itself is disappointing.",3,Just okay,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,430,"['watched', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'original', 'characters', 'A', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'held', 'up', 'characters', 'are', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'are', 'small', 'roles', 'here', 'really', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'know', 'original', 'story', 'enjoy', 'film', 'film', 'secret', 'garden', 'as', 'magical', 'garden', 'door', 'simply', 'when', 'door', 'shut', 'Overall', 'story', 'cute', 'actors', 'are', 'sweet', 'garden', 'disappointing']",N/A

The best part of the movie is the great actress Joan Plowright!! Also the gorgeous castle Highclere that was used for the back drop of the orphanage.

Why do the Brits do so much better at children's movies than we do?  This has atmosphere, beautiful scenery, a talented cast, and is lovingly photographed.  What a joy to see David Warner in this; he is probably the most under-rated actor of the 20th century.  He is always believable, always a delight to see.  I certainly intend to buy this movie, and watch it again and again.  You will be drawn into this movie's wonderful universe at once, and never want to leave.  These days, we all need a little magic, and this movie is a powerhouse in the magic and charm departments.  When you've really arrived, you don't have to shout about it.  This movie speaks softly and carries a big stick.  A very delightful and welcome addition to any film library.  The color is ravishing.
