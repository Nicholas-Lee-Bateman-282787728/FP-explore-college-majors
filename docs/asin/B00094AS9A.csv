But of course, they aren't real, they're written by his mom (this is not a spoiler, we discover this very early in the movie.)Now the dad's ship will soon be docking and Frankie expects a visit from his dad.The kid who plays Frankie in this movie gives an extraordinary performance. He successfully conveys Frankie's tough-minded sweetness and intelligence without saying a word. The other performances are also good. We meet a mother trying to bring up her kid alone and a collection of other working-class characters who teach us what it means to be community.This movie is easy viewing but it stayed with me.

The handful of characters in this minor masterpiece are just making it, each one trying to endure the injustices life has dished out.  Lizzie (played by the irresistible Emily Mortimer) and son Frankie, are engaged in a sophisticated ritual that insulates them both from the pain initiated by Frankie's father.  We are never quite sure how completely Frankie believes the mythology about the letters, although it is certain that he desperately wants to believe.With the arrival of the actual ship his father has allegedly been working on comes the inevitable end of the masquerade, and with it, some long overdue growth. The stranger, (Gerard Butler), who Lizzie has hired to impersonate Frankie's father, brings tremendous quiet dignity to the role, and his interactions with Lizzie have an understated power that electrifies the screen.Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, this is one of those truly rare movies worth owning and watching more than once.  Dear Frankie is not remotely sentimental, but it does enrich your soul. These are real, three-dimensional people doing their best.

901338,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00094AS9A,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","For a film that appears on the outset to be ridiculously predictable, I was genuinely surprised with how few clich&eacute;s really abounded here.  Yes, there are some (you can never escape them all) but they and few and, thankfully, far in between.Get your hankies out; you'll need them.The film tells the story of a young mother named Lizzie who is constantly uprooting her young son Frankie and her mother in order to stay away from her ex-husband.  Her ex was an abusive man who did some serious damage when Frankie was young.  Because of that `damage', Frankie is now deaf.  Frankie is a very smart and inquisitive boy who remembers nothing of his father.  In order to protect her son from a past she wishes he had never had, Lizzie lies to him and tells him that his father loves him very much, but that he is a seaman who is away at sea and thus unable to really be a part of Frankie's life.  So, Frankie writes to him, and Lizzie collects the letters and then writes back, filling her son's head with the image of a loving, caring, devoted father.  Her lie starts to unravel when word gets to Frankie that the ship his father is supposed to be on is actually going to be docking in town.  Lizzie doesn't want to tell him the truth, but she seemingly has no other options.  Then she is introduced to a handsome stranger who agrees to pretend to be Frankie's father for a small sum of money.What happens next is just plain beautiful.If you are expecting the usual (man falls in love with mother and son and then son finds out he is not his father and gets mad and then they make up and live happily ever after) then you are going to be in for a treat, because `Dear Frankie' goes a route that is far more believable, far more touching and far more memorable.With moving performances by the entire cast, including a heartfelt Gerard Butler (he's more than good looks) and a beautifully fleshed out Emily Mortimer (stunning performance); `Dear Frankie' is a refreshing piece of filmmaking that the whole family will enjoy.  Be forewarned, I'm serious about the hankies; this movie is primed and ready to evoke serious waterworks.  My wife and I were bawling, but sometimes you need a good cry, and the sadness that is found in this film is beautifully replaced by a sincere happiness.UGH, and that final letter!",4,"Soft, simple and pure...",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,2314,"['film', 'outset', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'predictable', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'how', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'really', 'abounded', 'here', 'Yes', 'are', 'can', 'never', 'escape', 'few', 'thankfully', 'far', 'between.Get', 'hankies', 'out', ""'ll"", 'need', 'them.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'mother', 'named', 'Lizzie', 'who', 'constantly', 'uprooting', 'young', 'son', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'order', 'stay', 'away', 'ex-husband', 'ex', 'was', 'abusive', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'serious', 'damage', 'when', 'Frankie', 'was', 'young', 'damage', 'Frankie', 'now', 'deaf', 'Frankie', 'very', 'smart', 'inquisitive', 'boy', 'who', 'nothing', 'father', 'order', 'protect', 'son', 'past', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'Lizzie', 'father', 'very', 'much', 'seaman', 'who', 'away', 'sea', 'thus', 'unable', 'really', 'be', 'part', 'Frankie', 'life', 'So', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'letters', 'then', 'back', 'filling', 'son', 'head', 'image', 'loving', 'caring', 'devoted', 'father', 'lie', 'unravel', 'when', 'word', 'Frankie', 'ship', 'father', 'supposed', 'be', 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'docking', 'town', 'Lizzie', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'truth', 'seemingly', 'other', 'options', 'Then', 'introduced', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'who', 'pretend', 'be', 'Frankie', 'father', 'small', 'sum', 'money.What', 'next', 'just', 'plain', 'beautiful.If', 'are', 'expecting', 'usual', 'man', 'love', 'mother', 'son', 'then', 'son', 'not', 'father', 'mad', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'treat', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'route', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'far', 'more', 'touching', 'far', 'more', 'memorable.With', 'moving', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'including', 'heartfelt', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'more', 'good', 'looks', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Frankie', 'refreshing', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Be', 'forewarned', ""'m"", 'serious', 'hankies', 'movie', 'primed', 'ready', 'evoke', 'serious', 'waterworks', 'wife', 'were', 'bawling', 'sometimes', 'need', 'good', 'cry', 'sadness', 'found', 'film', 'beautifully', 'replaced', 'sincere', 'happiness.UGH', 'final', 'letter']",Dear Frankie

901344,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00094AS9A,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","DEAR FRANKIE is a heartwarming tale about the deception a parent is willing to portray in order to protect a child. Shot in Glasgow, Scotland by Director Shona Auerbach with her husband operating as a cameraman, this movie's strong characters will tug at heartstrings in a very positive way.The story is that of Frankie (Jack McElhone) and his mother Lizzie (Emily Mortimer, MATCH POINT). Recently relocating to yet another new city, Frankie immediately begins writing letters to his father again as soon as he's able. He's been doing this for years and years, never having met his father and only knowing -- via his mum -- that his dad is on a boat at sea named the Accra. Frankie's dad writes back often and Frankie keeps track of his father's movements around the world via a large map posted above his bed. In addition to lacking an active father, Frankie also can't hear, being deaf (supposedly) since birth. This is an additional challenge for him since he has to re-orient people to his handicap every time they move to a new town. Classmates, store owners, librarians, all of them have varying degrees of pity, anxiety, and teasing that easily bounce off of Frankie's prominent mental armor. He's a smart kid, and a ""champion lip reader.""But Frankie's world is about to change once he learns that his father's ship is scheduled to port at the local docks of their new hometown! Frankie is beside himself with joy, but his mother is strangely downcast. And for good reason. Frankie's father is NOT on a ship at sea and never has been. Lizzie (him mum) has been writing those letters back to Frankie, pretending to be his seafaring father. She had no idea that a ship called the Accra even existed, and now she must deal with its impending arrival and the unveiling of her lies to her son.Not willing to give-in that easily, Lizzie concocts a plan to have a ""Stranger"" pose as Frankie's father. She meets up with this dark but handsome man that we come to know only as The Stranger (Gerard Butler, BEOWULF & GRENDEL) and promises him an amount of money if he'll pose, for a day, as her son's father. The Stranger agrees, thus setting up circumstances that will lead to a love that Frankie, Lizzie, or even The Stranger thought impossible.Young Jack McElhone gives a silent yet powerful performance as Frankie, the boy who knows more than he ever lets on. His sweet role is a marvel. Emily Mortimer gives a good performance as Lizzie, Frankie's mum, but is anchored even stronger in her character thanks to the handsome Gerard Butler. Butler's distant but involved portrayal of The Stranger is pulled off exceptionally well, especially since, as the audience, we know nothing about him before, during, or after his visit with Frankie and Lizzie. We suspect several things, though (he may have had an absent father, too, or had a bad relationship that ended in divorce like Lizzie's ...although we're never given any information as such).The only downer is the side-story relating to Frankie's ""real"" father who is dying of cancer. Perhaps it would have been best to keep any firm father-figure (be it paternal or otherwise) distant from Frankie's life, or fleeting (as in The Stranger). The hospital scenes with Frankie's biological father felt forced and unnecessary.Otherwise, this is a gem of a film that'll make you smile, shed a few tears, and be grateful there are Strangers among us who can fill the ample shoes of fathers.",4,Thank Goodness For The Love Of Strangers,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,3435,"['DEAR', 'FRANKIE', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'deception', 'parent', 'willing', 'portray', 'order', 'protect', 'child', 'Shot', 'Glasgow', 'Scotland', 'Director', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'husband', 'operating', 'cameraman', 'movie', 'strong', 'characters', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'very', 'positive', 'way.The', 'story', 'Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'mother', 'Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'Recently', 'relocating', 'yet', 'new', 'city', 'Frankie', 'immediately', 'writing', 'letters', 'father', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'able', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'years', 'never', 'having', 'met', 'father', 'only', 'knowing', 'mum', 'dad', 'boat', 'sea', 'named', 'Accra', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'back', 'often', 'Frankie', 'track', 'father', 'movements', 'world', 'large', 'map', 'posted', 'bed', 'addition', 'lacking', 'active', 'father', 'Frankie', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'being', 'deaf', 'supposedly', 'birth', 'additional', 'challenge', 're-orient', 'people', 'handicap', 'time', 'move', 'new', 'town', 'Classmates', 'store', 'owners', 'librarians', 'have', 'varying', 'degrees', 'pity', 'anxiety', 'teasing', 'easily', 'bounce', 'Frankie', 'prominent', 'mental', 'armor', 'smart', 'kid', 'champion', 'lip', 'reader', 'Frankie', 'world', 'change', 'once', 'father', 'ship', 'scheduled', 'port', 'local', 'docks', 'new', 'hometown', 'Frankie', 'beside', 'joy', 'mother', 'strangely', 'downcast', 'good', 'reason', 'Frankie', 'father', 'NOT', 'ship', 'sea', 'never', 'been', 'Lizzie', 'mum', 'been', 'writing', 'letters', 'back', 'Frankie', 'pretending', 'be', 'seafaring', 'father', 'had', 'idea', 'ship', 'called', 'Accra', 'even', 'existed', 'now', 'must', 'deal', 'impending', 'arrival', 'unveiling', 'lies', 'son.Not', 'willing', 'give-in', 'easily', 'Lizzie', 'plan', 'have', 'Stranger', 'pose', 'Frankie', 'father', 'up', 'dark', 'handsome', 'man', 'come', 'know', 'only', 'Stranger', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'BEOWULF', 'GRENDEL', 'amount', 'money', ""'ll"", 'pose', 'day', 'son', 'father', 'Stranger', 'thus', 'setting', 'up', 'circumstances', 'will', 'lead', 'love', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'even', 'Stranger', 'thought', 'impossible.Young', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'silent', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Frankie', 'boy', 'who', 'more', 'ever', 'sweet', 'role', 'marvel', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'good', 'performance', 'Lizzie', 'Frankie', 'mum', 'anchored', 'even', 'stronger', 'character', 'thanks', 'handsome', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Butler', 'distant', 'involved', 'portrayal', 'Stranger', 'pulled', 'off', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'especially', 'audience', 'know', 'nothing', 'before', 'visit', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'suspect', 'several', 'things', 'though', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'absent', 'father', 'too', 'had', 'bad', 'relationship', 'ended', 'divorce', 'Lizzie', ""'re"", 'never', 'given', 'information', 'such', 'only', 'downer', 'side-story', 'relating', 'Frankie', 'real', 'father', 'who', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'keep', 'firm', 'father-figure', 'be', 'paternal', 'otherwise', 'distant', 'Frankie', 'life', 'fleeting', 'Stranger', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'Frankie', 'biological', 'father', 'felt', 'forced', 'unnecessary.Otherwise', 'gem', 'film', ""'ll"", 'make', 'smile', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'be', 'grateful', 'are', 'Strangers', 'who', 'can', 'fill', 'ample', 'shoes', 'fathers']",Dear Frankie

Having watched this film, however, I have to say that Butler is by far not the only thing that makes this wonderful story a must-see.  Set in Scotland, Dear Frankie tells the story of Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) and her struggles to keep her son Frankie (Jack McElhone) away from his father. While she does that, she wants her son, who is deaf, to think he has a loving father who is always at sea and sends him letters, though she's the one who writes the letters.  But the charade comes to an end when Frankie makes a bet with a classmate and Lizzie has to present a father to Frankie.  So she hires a stranger (Gerard Butler) to pass as his dad.  There are some twists and turns throughout the film.This is a very thought-provoking, poignant film that shows the depths of a young woman's love for her son and how far she'd go to make her child happy.  The scenes with Frankie and his pretend dad bonding are wonderful.  Again, like in The Phantom of the Opera, Gerard Butler has impressed me with his acting, with his facial expressions and ability to transmit thoughts and emotions without saying a single word.  I loved his facial expressions and the emotions he conveyed when Lizzie told him about Frankie's father and what he'd done to the kid.  He has a very expressive (and very handsome) face and I couldn't keep my eyes off him. His nameless character remains an enigma from beginning to end.  The one thing that is obvious is The Stranger's growing fondness and admiration for both Frankie and Lizzie. I was disappointed with the fact that his character doesn't enter the story until forty-five minutes into the film, but the rest of the storyline is wonderful and I was engaged throughout.  Mortimer is also wonderful and she looked familiar to me.  I finally remember where I'd seen her -- she had small roles in the movies Notting Hill and Scream 3.  Jack McElhone is very talented for his young age and he transmitted his emotions beautifully.  Overall, I loved this film and its twists at the end.  I highly recommend this film.  (I also recommend that, if you have trouble understanding the thick Scottish brogue, you read the subtitles.)  Hollywood, take note, for this wonderful flick shows that you don't need cliche and formulaic scenes to make a movie work.

901359,A1DKRJVIZLAKCE,B00094AS9A,Cristi,"[3, 3]",This movie has lots of different types a love.  Love from a mother for her child.  Love from a son for his father.  First love when you just discover the opposite sex.  Love for a friend despite flaws and failures.  The first spark of love you fell for someone who has taught you something about yourself. Even love that has become possessive and dominant.  It is a really sweet story with a happy ending that treads a narrow walkway between touching and sappy.  I think if the performances of the lead characters weren't so strong the movie would fall into melodrama.  Emily Mortimer is great as a woman who knows how to sacrifice everything and yet is so strong she could conquer the world.  Gerard Butler aside from being gorgeous does a lovely and subtle job of a going from a cynical loner to a man who suddenly discovers the possibility of life.  Jack McElhone is quietly wonderful and a boy who knows more than he is saying and an old soul.

901361,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00094AS9A,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 6]","Maybe I'm getting soft, but I was quite touched by this movie.  I don't naturally gravitate toward heartwarming dramas, but the premise of this film sounded quite interesting and, after seeing Phantom of the Opera, I've become a Gerard Butler fan.  Dear Frankie really is the kind of film we need in this increasingly cynical world.  It's all about love of the strongest kind.Frankie (Jack McElhone) is a deaf, nine-year-old boy who lives with his mother and grandmother, and the little family moves around fairly often.  Frankie's dad is a sailor; the child has no actual memories of his father, but the two exchange letters every week or two.  Actually, though, his mother Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) is the one writing the letters to Frankie, making up all the stuff his ""father"" tells him about life at sea.  She feels guilty about lying to her son this way, but she has her reasons - for one thing, she doesn't want Frankie to know that his father is no good and that the reason they move so often is to keep his father from finding out where they are; equally important, though, is the fact that she really only hears her son's ""voice"" in the letters he writes to his father.  Frankie reads lips very well, and he and his mother certainly do communicate, but he really opens up only in the letters he writes.  It looks like these letters back and forth will continue indefinitely - but then Frankie learns that his father's ship is set to dock right there in Glasgow.  His mother sort of freaks out when she learns about this (she didn't even know a ship with that name existed).  Rather than tell Frankie the truth, she finds a stranger (Gerard Butler) to be Frankie's dad for a day.  It's all rather awkward at first, as ""Davey"" clearly isn't used to interacting with a ""son,"" but he warms up to Frankie - and to Lizzie - rather quickly.The big question is, of course, how the movie will end.  Things get even more complicated as things go along, with Lizzie ultimately facing a really tough decision related to Frankie's real father.  I must say I was very happy with the conclusion, as things played out quite differently than I expected - and an already poignant film became even more emotionally compelling in the process.  It really is a wonderful ending.I would go so far as to call this a truly precious movie.  I had a little trouble with the accents, especially at first, but once my ears tuned to the thick Scottish brogue, things became a lot easier.  The acting is really so superb, though, that you could easily get swept up in the story even if you didn't understand a word anyone was saying.  Great acting does not need dialogue, and this movie offers weighty proof to that statement.  If you like a lot of action in your movies, this one isn't going to satisfy you, but for those who enjoy a well-made, heartwarming drama, Dear Frankie is far too good to be missed.",5,"A poignant, wonderfully heartwarming film",1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,2885,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'getting', 'soft', 'was', 'quite', 'touched', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'naturally', 'gravitate', 'heartwarming', 'dramas', 'premise', 'film', 'sounded', 'quite', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Phantom', 'Opera', ""'ve"", 'become', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'fan', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'really', 'kind', 'film', 'need', 'increasingly', 'cynical', 'world', 'love', 'strongest', 'kind.Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'deaf', 'nine-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'little', 'family', 'moves', 'fairly', 'often', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'sailor', 'child', 'actual', 'memories', 'father', 'two', 'exchange', 'letters', 'week', 'two', 'Actually', 'mother', 'Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'one', 'writing', 'letters', 'Frankie', 'making', 'up', 'stuff', 'father', 'life', 'sea', 'guilty', 'lying', 'son', 'way', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'want', 'Frankie', 'know', 'father', 'good', 'reason', 'move', 'so', 'often', 'keep', 'father', 'finding', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'equally', 'important', 'fact', 'really', 'only', 'son', 'voice', 'letters', 'father', 'Frankie', 'lips', 'very', 'well', 'mother', 'certainly', 'do', 'communicate', 'really', 'up', 'only', 'letters', 'letters', 'back', 'forth', 'will', 'continue', 'indefinitely', 'then', 'Frankie', 'father', 'ship', 'set', 'dock', 'right', 'there', 'Glasgow', 'mother', 'sort', 'freaks', 'out', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'ship', 'name', 'existed', 'Rather', 'tell', 'Frankie', 'truth', 'stranger', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'be', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'day', 'rather', 'awkward', 'first', 'Davey', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'used', 'interacting', 'son', 'up', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'rather', 'big', 'question', 'course', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'things', 'go', 'along', 'Lizzie', 'ultimately', 'facing', 'really', 'tough', 'decision', 'related', 'Frankie', 'real', 'father', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'things', 'played', 'out', 'quite', 'differently', 'expected', 'already', 'poignant', 'film', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'process', 'really', 'wonderful', 'ending.I', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'truly', 'precious', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'accents', 'especially', 'first', 'once', 'ears', 'tuned', 'thick', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'things', 'became', 'lot', 'easier', 'acting', 'really', 'so', 'superb', 'though', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'story', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'anyone', 'was', 'saying', 'Great', 'acting', 'not', 'need', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'weighty', 'proof', 'statement', 'like', 'lot', 'action', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'going', 'satisfy', 'who', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'heartwarming', 'drama', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'missed']",Dear Frankie

901365,AACEZE2YPTJ5D,B00094AS9A,D. Kanigan,"[1, 1]","Film set is a seaport town of Greenock, Scotland in the early 2000's.  Lizzie Morrison, is a young single mother who cares for her 9 year old deaf son (Frankie) and her elderly Mother (Nell).  Lizzie continues to move her son and Mother from town to town to hide from her former husband.  Lizzie decides to fabricate a positive role model for the boy by creating and trading letters between Father and son.  The Father being a sailor who sends the boy letters from various points of call - and the son captivated by the stories of his journeys of the sea and other lands.  The scheme hits trouble when one of Frankie's troublesome schoolmates finds out that the Father's make-be-believe ship is actually coming to Greenock - so he bets Frankie that his Father won't show.  Lizzie is torn between telling her son the truth and coming up with a solution to the predicament.  Eventually she finds a Father impersonator who agrees to play the role of Father in exchange for payment.  And the story takes off from here...The film is exceptionally well casted.  Lizzie plays the role of the caring, doting Mother.  Nell, Lizzie's Mother, is a sharp tongued, worry-wart Mother. Frankie, is quiet, determined, kind hearted and thirsts to see and have a relationship with his Father.  The film keeps you in suspense for most of the journey.  This is an emotional film about the iron ties of Mother to child...the importance of family and friends to pull you through the most difficult times...and the power of human spirit.

901369,A1W81OCSO03PYH,B00094AS9A,Dorie,"[14, 15]","I will not start with the usual plot synopsis, as other reviewers have already done that. I will just say that this is a beautiful and touching film, brought to us by a very talented cast. The nine year old boy playing Frankie, Jack McElhone, is just amazing. As the director, Shona Auerbach points out, since this is a silent part (Frankie is deaf), all of Frankie's acting has to be done through body language and facial expression. And Jack does this superbly. You hardly realize he does not speak throughout the movie, since his face and his gestures speak so much and convey so many emotions.The relationship between Frankie and the stranger who is hired by his mother to play his father for one day is very believable and very moving. The stranger, a sceptic at the outset, becomes emotionally involved and while at first he does not think much of Frankie's mother for doing this, ends up respecting her and so do we, the audience. Personally, I felt I did not like Frankie's mother at first, as her motives seem unclear. We learn about her motives with the stranger, and that's when sympathy shifts.I was also particularly impressed by the stranger's emotion in the scene where he meets Frankie: he needs to be believable, and he is very tense wondering if he has done well. I felt the tension with him. Gerald Butler is wonderful, looking handsome, tall, and reassuring, the father figure Frankie really needs.There are so many touching moments I will let you discover for yourselves, as I don't want to spoil it for you. I will just say that the entire movie is full of twists and turns, much more than you'd expect. In the second half a surprise awaits in virtually every scene to the very end , and I also cried at virtually every one of these scenes.""Dear Frankie"" is filmed in Scotland, and features some beautiful scenery. I also enjoyed listening to the Scottish accent used throughout the film.The additional material includes the director's commentary, an interview with the director, which I found quite interesting, and some deleted scenes, one of which at least actually reveals some insight into one of the minor characters. I'm thinking it's particularly clever to cut such a scene in the official release, and then add it to the deleted scenes section on the DVD, although I'm not sure this was intentional.I enjoyed the movie, and I'll certainly want to rewatch it. Even though I now know about all the twists and turns in the plot, it will actually be interesting to follow the range of emotion displayed by this talented cast with all this pre-knowledge in mind.",5,Beautiful and touching,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2588,"['will', 'not', 'start', 'usual', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'film', 'brought', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'playing', 'Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'just', 'amazing', 'director', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'out', 'silent', 'part', 'Frankie', 'deaf', 'Frankie', 'acting', 'be', 'done', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expression', 'Jack', 'superbly', 'hardly', 'realize', 'not', 'speak', 'movie', 'face', 'gestures', 'speak', 'so', 'much', 'convey', 'so', 'many', 'emotions.The', 'relationship', 'Frankie', 'stranger', 'who', 'hired', 'mother', 'play', 'father', 'one', 'day', 'very', 'believable', 'very', 'moving', 'stranger', 'sceptic', 'outset', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'first', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'doing', 'up', 'respecting', 'so', 'do', 'audience', 'Personally', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'first', 'motives', 'seem', 'unclear', 'learn', 'motives', 'stranger', 'when', 'sympathy', 'shifts.I', 'was', 'also', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'stranger', 'emotion', 'scene', 'where', 'Frankie', 'be', 'believable', 'very', 'tense', 'wondering', 'done', 'well', 'felt', 'tension', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'wonderful', 'looking', 'handsome', 'tall', 'reassuring', 'father', 'figure', 'Frankie', 'really', 'needs.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'will', 'let', 'discover', 'yourselves', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'entire', 'movie', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'much', 'more', ""'d"", 'expect', 'second', 'half', 'surprise', 'virtually', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'also', 'cried', 'virtually', 'one', 'scenes', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'filmed', 'Scotland', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'used', 'film.The', 'additional', 'material', 'director', 'commentary', 'interview', 'director', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'least', 'actually', 'insight', 'one', 'minor', 'characters', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'particularly', 'clever', 'cut', 'such', 'scene', 'official', 'release', 'then', 'add', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'intentional.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'want', 'rewatch', 'Even', 'now', 'know', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'interesting', 'follow', 'range', 'emotion', 'displayed', 'talented', 'cast', 'pre-knowledge', 'mind']",Dear Frankie

901378,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00094AS9A,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","DEAR FRANKIE is one of those rare films that tell a story (by Andrea Gibb) with such minimal extraneous effects, keeping the line of the tale clear and unfettered by bathos, and results in an emotional experience for the viewer that creates a sense of empowerment and utter commitment.  While much of this effect is due to the extraordinary talent of director Shona Auerbach (who also is the film's magical cinematographer!) and by the glorious musical score by Alex Heffes, this film boasts one of the finest casts assembled for a small movie.Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) is an itinerant resident of various towns in Scotland, living with her 9 year old deaf ('he's a gifted lip reader!') son Frankie (Jack McElhone) and her cranky, endlessly smoking mother Nell (Mary Riggans): they travel to short-time stays to escape discovery by Lizzie's abusive husband Davey (Cal Macaninch).  Out of love for Frankie, Lizzie has 'created' a father who is a sailor and always at sea and corresponds with Frankie through letters Lizzie herself writes and mails. Though Lizzie feels a bit guilty at carrying on this beneficent deceit and Nell is angered at her daughter's game, Frankie is happy knowing his father is a brave seaman who writes to him constantly.One of Frankie's new schoolmates Ricky (Sean Brown) hears that Frankie's dad's ship is soon to anchor in their town and, supposing that Frankie doesn't have a real father,  makes a wager with Frankie that his father won't show.  Frankie accepts, tells his mother, and Lizzie panics, deciding to find a stranger to pose for pay as Frankie's dad for a day.  Lizzie's friend Marie (Sharon Small) finds a man to fit the need for a stranger 'with no past, present, or future' (Gerard Butler) and the stranger consents to aid Lizzie's plight.  On the day of the ship's arrival, Lizzie arranges for the stranger to come to her flat to surprise Frankie. The intial meeting is quiet and phenomenally and subtlely touching.  Frankie and his 'Da' walk the streets, the seaside, the docks, attend Frankie's soccer game where Frankie is able to win the wager with Ricky, etc: slowly the stranger bonds with Frankie as sincerely as Frankie does with the stranger.  Lizzie softens, allows the stranger one more day posing as Frankie's dad, and in one of the most poetic doorway encounters ever produced on film, heals her emotional instability with the stranger.The ending holds surprises and other luminous encounters, each of which allow us to see the transformation in each of the characters, all due to the power of love.  No Hollywood ending here, just an understated bit of reality that pulls strongly on the heartstrings - and few viewers can resist the pull.  The performance by Jack McElhone is astonishingly fine as is the work of Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler.  The entire cast is committed to the vision of the director and the result is simply unforgettable.  Highly recommended for all audiences.

Try finding a theater or movie rental store that carried it, and you'll see how frustrating it was for many of us to see it.Shona Auerbach, the cast, and the crew are to be commended on their top-notch work on this production.I can't recall another movie I've watched in the last 10 years that made me feel so many emotions by the time the credits rolled.  This movie has it all - a talented cast, good script, evocative music, and scenery of Scotland that - when all put together - make for a tremendous movie experience.Emily Mortimer, Jack McElhone, Gerry Butler, Sharon Small and Mary Riggans give their all.  ""Acting"" has never seemed so effortless before when you watch these people interact with each other.  The boy is especially good, considering his age and the fact that he isn't deaf in real life.  Emily Mortimer has a ethereal fragility about her that's necessary for this role.  Sharon Small, who I already admire from the Inspector Lyndley mystery series, has a smaller supporting role but does it justice.  Riggans is perfectly cast as Nell, mother to Lizzie and grandmother to Frankie.  My favorite scene with her involves fingernail polish, whiskey and Barbara Stanwyck (watch it, you'll see what I mean!).And then there's Gerry Butler...the mysterious Stranger with a stoic personality that oh-so-gradually warms up over the course of his involvement with Frankie and Lizzie.  Mr. Butler is the most under-rated actor going right now.  He consistantly gives tremendous performances and his ability to use his entire face and body are what make him a cut above.There may be a slight difficulty for American viewers in following the dialogue due to the Scottish dialect, but in my opinion this enhances rather than detracts from my enjoyment of the film.  Since to my ears it is ""different"", the movie further takes on a dreamy, surreal feeling that is only enhanced by the music and the Scottish setting.No one with a heart in their chest should walk away disappointed in ""Dear Frankie"".  In fact, I urge you to rent it, borrow it, or buy it and see for yourself right now.

This film will leave you smiling.This story is about a single mother, Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), and her deaf son Frankie (Jack McElhone). Lizzie fled from an abusive marriage, taking Frankie and her mother to make sure she never went back. As Frankie gets older Lizzie is unable to tell him what a terrible man his father was, but she knows that as he gets older he is going to start asking questions about his dad. Lizzie decides to begin writing Frankie letters authored by his father telling him about life as a sailor aboard the ACCRA. Lizzie continues to write Frankie for a few years and is able to arrange a deal with the post office for Frankie to write letters back. As Frankie nears his 10th birthday the real ACCRA is due to dock in Glasgow, Scotland where they live. Lizzie has to make a decision... tell Frankie the truth, or find a man to be Frankie's dad for just one day! Lizzie's mother encourages her to tell Frankie the truth but deep down Lizzie does not want to stop the letters because reading Frankie's letters is ""the only way she can hear his voice"". Deciding to find Frankie a dad, Lizzie turns to her best friend Marie. Marie finds Lizzie a Stranger (Gerard Butler), a man with ""no past, present, future... or name"" to be Frankie's dad for just one day.This is definately a wonderful movie for anyone who is or has been a parent.

901386,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00094AS9A,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[9, 10]","Director Shona Auerbach and writer Andrea Gibbs put together a real winner with their 2004 release, ""Dear Frankie,"" an intelligent and extremely poignant film which I have had on my ""must see"" list for some time. Powerful performances from an extraordinary ensemble cast of relatively unknown actors are one of the major elements which makes this movie so special. There are some profoundly moving moments here, and absolutely no manipulative sappiness. Frankie speaks to his (supposed) dad for the first time in a superb scene toward the end. The moment could have been so overdone, but the subtlety with which it was directed and played epitomizes what is best in ""Dear Frankie.""Lizzie Morrison, (Emily Mortimer), her nine and a half year-old son, Frankie, (Jack McElhone ), and her chain-smoking mother Nell, (Mary Riggans), have moved to a small seaside town near Glasgow, Scotland, to elude Lizzie's husband, Frankie's father. They have been on the move now for nine years, never staying long in one place. The small family of three are held together by love, which is palpable, and also by a web of lies which were originally invented to protect their most vulnerable member, the child. Frankie, who is hearing impaired, believes his father is a merchant marine seaman and writes to him faithfully, tracking the progress of his ship, the Accra, as it travels the world.In fact, the boy is really corresponding with his mother. Lizzie encourages him to write his dad and then she intercepts the letters, responds to them and mails them, often enclosing international postage stamps for the child's prized collection. Frankie's letters, and the one's from his ""father"" are mailed to a central PO box which Lizzie rents whenever they move to a new place.Major problems surface when Frankie discovers that his dad's cargo ship, the Accra, (which really does exist, to Lizzie's great surprise), will be in port for a few days. He agonizes over whether his father will come to visit him. And Lizzie is besides herself with what to do. Marie, (Sharon Small), a new family friend, lends a helping hand in the form of a stranger - a sailor home on leave, played by Gerard Butler, who, for a fee, will stand in as dad for a day.The movie was filmed in and around Glasgow and the grittiness of the city, the sea, dunes, the port and ships, and the distant hills create a somewhat melancholy atmosphere. The coming and going of vessels reminds one of the transience of people and places. The scenery is not unattractive, but it is far from the picture postcard version of Scotland one usually views. Although all the actors speak with a Scottish accent, I had no trouble understanding them, which is unusual.Auerbach's pace is far from hurried. Alex Heffes's spare piano score is beautifully low-keyed and helps keep the emotion to scale. Mortimer is magnificent as Lizzie. She loves her son unconditionally, but in reality she has been given short shrift in her young life, and responsibilities, stress, and worry weigh her down. There is a moment when her face lights up gloriously, like a child's, when she hears a favorite song on a rare night out. My reaction was that it took so little to give her such joy. On another occasion, when she and Butler stand in the doorway, shy, wanting to kiss, tension builds, but quietly, before their lips finally touch. And there are unforgettable moments between mother and son. Bright-eyed Jack McElhone communicates so much with just a look or a gesture. And then there is Gerard Butler, who I would happily watch and listen to if he were reading the telephone book. He is simply the most charismatic leading man out there today.The extras include a twelve minite audio commentary with director Shona Auerbach who presents good, cogent explanations of what she was was trying to accomplish in each scene. The nine-minute featurette, ""The Story of Dear Frankie,"" includes the actors, producer, and director discussing the origins of the film and their roles in its production. There are also eight deleted scenes, with optional director commentary, etc.. English and French spoken languages are options as are Spanish subtitles, and English captions for the hearing impaired.Overall, this is a film well worth seeing.

I have to admit that at first the heavy Scottish accents were somewhat overwhelming, but once I got into the flow of the film by mid-point I didn't even notice anymore. Now this says a lot about how engrossing this film is. Previous reviewers have written wonderfully detailed story outlines, so I'm not going to repeat what this film is all about...but I still felt the need to express what a pleasure it was to see Dear Frankie. The acting is beyond exceptional...Mortimer as the mom and McElhone as Frankie were extremely expressive and moving...I for one loved Gerard Butler as ""The Stranger"". There is one scene where they are walking on a dock and he and Lizzie (the mother) are having a conversation and Butler reacts to a very poignant statement...(one that had my hand over my mouth) and his reactions is priceless, it's perfect because it's not over the top. Moments such as this are what make seeing this film an unique experience. The quiet undertone of this film fit the story beautifully because it is about a deaf boy who is ultimately trying to have his voice heard, initially we hear his voice though his letters to his father, this is his mothers one form of communication with him, what she learns in the end is that if she would listen close enough she could hear his voice through those that he touches around him as well.

The 25 mile drive I took was completely worth it.Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie, who has been writing letters under the guise of her estranged husband to her deaf son, Frankie, for years. In writing the letters many things are accomplished. Frankie gets to feel like he has some contact with his dad and Lizzie gets to hear the innermost thoughts and wishes of her son through the letters she reads and answers.When Lizzie, Frankie, and grandma Nell arrive in a new town, they befriend Marie. They also learn that the Accra--the ship on which Frankie thinks his dad lives--is docking near their town. With Marie's help, Lizzie encounters ""The Stranger"" and pays him to pretend to be Frankie's dad for one day.Now I have seen a couple of critics find fault in casting Gerard Butler as The Stranger, thinking him too cold and gruff for the role. If these critics had watched the movie closer, they would've seen that the role called for gruffness at the beginning. However, Frankie has the same affect on The Stranger as he has on everyone else--making people want to be better and thawing out their chilly dispositions.By the end of the movie everyone has learned something. Frankie has learned some truths through his mother and discovered others on his own. Lizzie learns to open up to others a little more. We learn who The Stranger actually is and, though we don't know anything about his past, we know that he has probably been emotionally shut down for a long time.Like many, I went to see it because I wanted to see Gerard Butler, but I can honestly say that once the movie started (and he doesn't appear until about 45 minutes into the film) I was so engrossed in the story that the original reason didn't even exist anymore.I have never seen Emily Mortimer in a film before (except her tiny part in Notting Hill,) but I was very impressed with the heart and realism that she brought to her role, as well as the actress who played her mother. Young Jack McElhone was especially impressive. You could see why his mother wanted to protect him so much and you could understand why The Stranger wanted to extend the time he spent with him.Critic Roger Ebert mentioned a scene in a doorway with Lizzie and The Stranger. He talked about the way a powerful scene does not need a lot of dialogue. I watched especially for that scene and completely agreed with his comments on its profundity. This was a beautiful film and I'm so glad that I saw it. It was sweet, simple, real, and powerful in many ways. It was the kind of film that will stay with you for several days. That is what good film-making is all about and it is refreshing to see one as high quality as DEAR FRANKIE.

901407,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00094AS9A,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[12, 13]","In a time of email, chatting, and text messaging, director Shona Auerbach transcends the power of written words on paper into an affectionate and poignant tale of a single parent's love for an only child.  The altruistic affection of Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) tries to accommodate a normal childhood for her deaf son, Frankie (Jack McElhone), while trying to provide a safe and nourishing upbringing for him.  Through this process she has created a father image for Frankie who always travels on the seven seas onboard the Accra.  The only means of communication between Frankie and his fictionalized father is through letters, which his mother secretively writes.What Frankie does not know is who his real father is, as Lizzie constantly tries with the help of her mother (Mary Riggans) to keep the secret alive through the made up sailor who provides Frankie with fatherly comfort.  The film opens with Frankie and Lizzie preparing for a move to a Glasgow.  In Glasgow, Frankie gets into trouble with a kid called Ricky (Sean Brown), who first tries to pick on him for being deaf, but Frankie is way too smart for a bully such as Ricky.  However, Ricky continues to pester him and reveals that Accra is coming to town.  This leaves Frankie slightly confused, as he does not understand why his father would not have told him.  Ricky tries to capitalize on his confusion by making a bet that his father is not coming to Glasgow.It is with much agony and pain that the mother tries to find a way to save the day for Frankie, as she knows about the bet and how it would make him feel on his upcoming birthday as well.  Nonetheless, Lizzie comes up with a clever solution to hire a man to pretend to be Frankie's father, which would save Frankie's face and make him very happy.  Meanwhile, Frankie's real father's family has located them, and also desire to see Frankie.  This puts Lizzie under a very stressful situation, as she cannot run due to Frankie's pretend father's arrival while trying to hide the truth for him.Initially Dear Frankie seems like a melodramatic story, but through Auerbach's attention to details and the minimal in each scene he raises the film far above average.  The success rests completely within simplicity where the appearance and action of the characters reveals far more than just a presence.  Every single character comes with words, but also actions consistent to their character.  Auerbach brings the audience's attention to the actions of the characters and not the words.  Furthermore, Frankie's deafness provides an analogy that suggests that what one see is more important than what one hears.  In the scene where Lizzie visits the real father the audience can also see his actions, see him speak for himself, and see why Lizzie left him in the first place.The many symbols within the film that come into play such as the letters, ship, deafness, and several others trigger reflexively thoughts that help driving the story in the right direction.  In addition, one cannot forget to mention the cast's wonderful performances, as they brought out the necessary elements of human interaction and affection.  Together these two are incorporated through clever scene framing that implement the mise-en-scene with a simplistic, yet inspiring intentions to provide a comprehensive view of a mother's zealousness to offer her son nurturing and affectionate care.",5,Poignant Tale of a Mother's Zealous Affection for Son...,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,3390,"['time', 'email', 'chatting', 'text', 'messaging', 'director', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'power', 'written', 'words', 'paper', 'affectionate', 'poignant', 'tale', 'single', 'parent', 'love', 'only', 'child', 'altruistic', 'affection', 'Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'accommodate', 'normal', 'childhood', 'deaf', 'son', 'Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'trying', 'provide', 'safe', 'nourishing', 'upbringing', 'process', 'created', 'father', 'image', 'Frankie', 'who', 'always', 'travels', 'seven', 'seas', 'onboard', 'Accra', 'only', 'communication', 'Frankie', 'fictionalized', 'father', 'letters', 'mother', 'secretively', 'writes.What', 'Frankie', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'Lizzie', 'constantly', 'help', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Riggans', 'keep', 'secret', 'alive', 'made', 'up', 'sailor', 'who', 'Frankie', 'fatherly', 'comfort', 'film', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'preparing', 'move', 'Glasgow', 'Glasgow', 'Frankie', 'trouble', 'kid', 'called', 'Ricky', 'Sean', 'Brown', 'who', 'first', 'pick', 'being', 'deaf', 'Frankie', 'way', 'too', 'smart', 'bully', 'such', 'Ricky', 'However', 'Ricky', 'pester', 'reveals', 'Accra', 'coming', 'town', 'Frankie', 'slightly', 'confused', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'father', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'told', 'Ricky', 'capitalize', 'confusion', 'making', 'bet', 'father', 'not', 'coming', 'Glasgow.It', 'much', 'agony', 'pain', 'mother', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'day', 'Frankie', 'bet', 'how', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'upcoming', 'birthday', 'well', 'Nonetheless', 'Lizzie', 'up', 'clever', 'solution', 'hire', 'man', 'pretend', 'be', 'Frankie', 'father', 'would', 'save', 'Frankie', 'face', 'make', 'very', 'happy', 'Meanwhile', 'Frankie', 'real', 'father', 'family', 'located', 'also', 'desire', 'see', 'Frankie', 'Lizzie', 'very', 'stressful', 'situation', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'due', 'Frankie', 'pretend', 'father', 'arrival', 'trying', 'hide', 'truth', 'him.Initially', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'Auerbach', 'attention', 'details', 'minimal', 'scene', 'film', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'success', 'completely', 'simplicity', 'where', 'appearance', 'action', 'characters', 'reveals', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'presence', 'single', 'character', 'words', 'also', 'actions', 'consistent', 'character', 'Auerbach', 'audience', 'attention', 'actions', 'characters', 'not', 'words', 'Furthermore', 'Frankie', 'deafness', 'analogy', 'what', 'one', 'see', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'one', 'hears', 'scene', 'where', 'Lizzie', 'real', 'father', 'audience', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'actions', 'see', 'speak', 'see', 'why', 'Lizzie', 'left', 'first', 'place.The', 'many', 'symbols', 'film', 'come', 'play', 'such', 'letters', 'ship', 'deafness', 'several', 'others', 'trigger', 'reflexively', 'thoughts', 'help', 'driving', 'story', 'right', 'direction', 'addition', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'brought', 'out', 'necessary', 'elements', 'human', 'interaction', 'affection', 'Together', 'two', 'are', 'incorporated', 'clever', 'scene', 'framing', 'implement', 'mise-en-scene', 'simplistic', 'yet', 'inspiring', 'intentions', 'provide', 'comprehensive', 'view', 'mother', 'zealousness', 'offer', 'son', 'nurturing', 'affectionate', 'care']",Dear Frankie

No good deed, especially if it is an act of deception in a good cause, goes unpunished.  So while we are watching everything come together in ""Dear Frankie,"" we are waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Of course it does, but not in a predictable way, which is one of the reasons this 2004 film from writer Andrea Gibb and director Shona Auerbach works as well as it does.I checked out this film because the trailer appeared on a couple of DVDs I was watching last week and I have to applaud whoever put together the trailer for ""Dear Frankie"" because there was a key detail about Frankie (Jack McElhone) that they did not reveal.  I appreciate that, so you may find out about it elsewhere on these pages but I will follow suit in setting up the situation.The situation is that Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) has been raising Frankie with the help of her mother, Nell (Mary Riggans).  All we really know about Frankie's father is that he is not on a cargo ship named the Accra, and we know this because while Frankie has been getting letters from his father, supposedly posted from ports of call from around the world (and with the appropriate stamps from other lands), it is Lizzie who has been writing the letters.  Of course Fate steps in and it turns out that there really is a ship named the Accra, and, you guessed it, it is coming to Glascow, Scotland, where Frankie lives.  A desperate Lizzie decides to hire a guy to play Frankie's dad, and the Stranger (Gerald Butler), applies for the job and takes it.Now, at this point you know enough to have reasonable expectations as to what is going to happen in the rest of this movie, and for the most part you will find you are correct.  But there are some surprises along the way and you end up caring about the characters so you are rooting for the predictable things to happen, at least, for the good ones.  However, when the inevitable bad things start happening Gibb's script keeps doing some smart things and avoids the painful predictability that often sinks stories like this one.Mortimer and McElhone invest their characters and their relationship with the requisite believability that really makes this movie work as far as I am concerned.  There is a strategic use of silences in this film as well, which is not only effective but also appropriate.  Butler went on to star in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" after doing this film, and as much as I thought he was wrong for that role (because he sings as more of a baritone than a tenor), he was perfect for this part and you can see why he is referred to as ""The Stranger.""  But beyond crediting the casting I go back to the script by Gibb or whoever was responsible for the decision to end ""Dear Frankie"" on the quiet moment that brings the film to a satisfactory and heartfelt conclusion.",5,Lizzie hires a stranger to pretend to be Frankie's da,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2876,"['One', 'thing', 'writers', 'do', 'time', 'time', 'really', 'pour', 'irony', 'good', 'deed', 'especially', 'act', 'deception', 'good', 'cause', 'unpunished', 'So', 'are', 'watching', 'everything', 'come', 'together', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'are', 'waiting', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'course', 'not', 'predictable', 'way', 'one', 'reasons', '2004', 'film', 'writer', 'Andrea', 'Gibb', 'director', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'as', 'well', 'checked', 'out', 'film', 'trailer', 'appeared', 'couple', 'DVDs', 'was', 'watching', 'last', 'week', 'have', 'applaud', 'whoever', 'put', 'together', 'trailer', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'was', 'key', 'detail', 'Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'did', 'not', 'reveal', 'appreciate', 'may', 'find', 'out', 'elsewhere', 'pages', 'will', 'follow', 'suit', 'setting', 'up', 'situation.The', 'situation', 'Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'been', 'raising', 'Frankie', 'help', 'mother', 'Nell', 'Mary', 'Riggans', 'really', 'know', 'Frankie', 'father', 'not', 'cargo', 'ship', 'named', 'Accra', 'know', 'Frankie', 'been', 'getting', 'letters', 'father', 'supposedly', 'posted', 'ports', 'call', 'world', 'appropriate', 'stamps', 'other', 'lands', 'Lizzie', 'who', 'been', 'writing', 'letters', 'course', 'Fate', 'steps', 'out', 'really', 'ship', 'named', 'Accra', 'guessed', 'coming', 'Glascow', 'Scotland', 'where', 'Frankie', 'desperate', 'Lizzie', 'hire', 'guy', 'play', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'Stranger', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'applies', 'job', 'it.Now', 'point', 'know', 'enough', 'have', 'reasonable', 'expectations', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'rest', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'will', 'find', 'are', 'correct', 'are', 'surprises', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'characters', 'are', 'rooting', 'predictable', 'things', 'happen', 'least', 'good', 'ones', 'However', 'when', 'inevitable', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Gibb', 'script', 'doing', 'smart', 'things', 'painful', 'predictability', 'often', 'stories', 'one.Mortimer', 'McElhone', 'invest', 'characters', 'relationship', 'requisite', 'believability', 'really', 'movie', 'work', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'strategic', 'use', 'silences', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'effective', 'also', 'appropriate', 'Butler', 'went', 'star', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'doing', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'role', 'more', 'baritone', 'tenor', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'referred', 'Stranger', 'crediting', 'casting', 'go', 'back', 'script', 'Gibb', 'was', 'responsible', 'decision', 'end', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'quiet', 'moment', 'film', 'satisfactory', 'heartfelt', 'conclusion']",Dear Frankie

901416,A1CROFPEPYNIZK,B00094AS9A,LKayH,"[6, 6]","The people who made this gem of a film have every right to be proud of it.  It's a beautiful story, told in a very restrained and effective way. It's wonderfully crafted artistically, and the performances are all just excellent.Much of the story is not told through the dialogue, but rather through visual images, bits of Scottish scenery that only someone who lived there would know, and through the expressions that flow across the faces of the actors. Although Shona Auerbach didn't get gimmicky about it at all, I had a sense that she wanted us to get a little feel for just how much Frankie (the title character is a deaf boy) could know what was going on, just by seeing the expressions of the people around him.For example, there's a lovely moment where, just by the way the characters chew on bits of candy, you can read volumes about what they are thinking and feeling.  In a later scene, Lizzie (the mom) reveals something shocking and painful about Frankie's history (I won't say what). There is a very long moment where the stranger doesn't say a word, but in that long moment there is this incredibly complex parade of emotions that comes across his face, from shock, to pity, to sorrow, to anger, and then to a profound respect. It's a powerful, pivotal moment in the film, and Auerbach and her cast handle it brilliantly.Emily Mortimer (Lizzie) easily sidestepped all the cliches that could have come into her role, playing this mom who has been deeply wounded, who has a HARD time trusting anyone or anything, but who is despite herself wearing her heart on her sleeve. You care about this woman and you champion her cause, even though even she knows that she's doing all the wrong things.Jack McElhone (Frankie) takes a kid who could be just a little TOO perfect, and makes him believable and real. He is a remarkable find and I look forward to seeing what he does next.As for Gerard Butler (the stranger), I think this is the best work he's done to date. He's already demonstrated uncanny versatility in other roles, and I had been thinking that he has the stuff to become a top-notch actor, given some better opportunities and the right challenges. His work here proves that he already IS a remarkable actor - not only one of the most talented working at this time, but also one of the most SKILLED.The story itself is very simple, and in less skilled hands, it could have been overly sentimental.

Truth be told, I only watched it yesterday because one friend recommended it to me...If you are in doubt whether to see this film or not, please take my advice and don't miss it. ""Dear Frankie"" is entertaining, touching, and has remarkably good actors. Also, the Scottish scenery where the story develops is extremely beautiful, probably even more so for someone that isn't familiar with it, like me. What is more, the film has a great ending, that with leave you with a smile on your face and wishing for a sequel. Finally, and as an extra bonus for all the women reading this, it has Gerard Butler as part of the cast. Butler is an excellent actor who happens to be extremely handsome and my new favourite leading man  :)I believe that Shona Auerbach, the director of this film, deserves congratulations on a wonderful movie, that is part drama and part comedy at times. The whole cast consists of wonderful actors that really become the characters they are playing, conveying what they are supposed to be feeling so clearly that it impossible not to be trapped by the story after the first few minutes.The plot of this film isn't overly complicated. Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) abandoned her abusive husband years ago, taking her little son with her. Lizzie lives with her son Frankie (Jack McElhone) and her mother (Mary Riggans) in a Scottish city near the sea. Frankie is deaf, and as he grows up, he wants to know more about the father he doesn't remember. As a result, his mother makes up a whole new personality for Frankie's father, and tells her son that his father is a sailor, visiting exotic places in the ship Accra. Frankie begins to write letters to his ""father"", and his mother answers them, trying to protect Frankie from the truth of what and who his father really is.But one day, when Frankie is nine, another kid tells him that the Accra is going to visit the city, and bets Frankie that his father won't drop by to visit him. When Lizzie finds out about that, she has no better idea that to hire someone, a stranger ""with no past and no future"", to play Frankie's dad. Thanks to the help of her friend Marie (Sharon Small), she finds someone that seems good enough, a stranger (Gerard Butler) that will only be in town for two days. What will happen? Well, if you are really interested, watch this film.All in all, I highly recommend ""Dear Frankie"" to you, unless who hate films that aren't full of action, or cannot stand the melodious Scottish accent. Personally, I don't mind the lack of fast-paced action if the story is good enough (and in this case it is), and I find the Scottish brogue enchanting.

She lies to her son about his father being at sea and continues the masquerade by writing him letters imitating what a loving father would write. She makes the mistake of using a real ship that comes to port where they live. For some reason she decides the only way out is to hire someone to play her son's father for a day.I loved all the characters. The supportive grandmother, the deaf boy, the man without a past and the protective mother. I was expecting Gerard Butler's character to have more of a pivotal role (only because I adore him). Despite being the replacement father he is not the main focus and is only in a few scenes. The focus is the relationship between the boy and his mother.

901434,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00094AS9A,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","To avoid her ex-husband, Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) moves her family often, this time settling in Glasgow, Scotland. Lizzie hadn't the heart to tell her young son Frankie (Jack McElhone) about his real father, so she told him that his dad is a petty officer on the HMS Accra, sailing around the globe. Frankie recounts his life in expressive letters to his ""father"", which his mother answers with creative stories about faraway ports and life at sea. The ruse is threatened when the HMS Accra, which Lizzie had no idea existed, is scheduled to dock in Glasgow. Frankie expects to see his father in person now. In spite of her mother's (Mary Riggans) admonitions and advice to tell Frankie the truth, Lizzie is determined to find someone to pose as Frankie's father for a day.Director Shona Auerbach makes an impressive feature film debut with ""Dear Frankie"". At first it seems as if Lizzie was wrong in lying to her son, concerned more with the image she would like Frankie to have of his family than with his needs or well-being. As the film progresses, we understand more about her motives and her decision takes on at least a little moral ambiguity. This is a character drama, so the cast has to carry this obviously contrived story into the realm of believability. And they do a fantastic job. Emily Mortimer expresses Lizzie's love for her son, fear of her past, and reluctance to form relationships without being the least bit melodramatic. Mary Riggans is blunt and endearing as Lizzie's somewhat disapproving but always caring mother Nell.  Gerard Butler plays the stranger whom Lizzie finds to pose as Frankie's father. He brings his masculine, handsome, leading man qualities to bear, but also expresses an empathy toward Lizzie and Frankie that is touching.Shona Auerbach was the cinematographer on the film as well as its director, and her husband Graeme Dunn was the camera operator. Meticulous attention to color and camera work is evident, and ""Dear Frankie"" is visually pleasant and consistent in its earthy tones. We learn about Frankie through his letters, which he narrates in voice-over. This is an interesting technique, because Frankie is deaf and does not speak in the film. The letters he writes to his father give his thoughts a voice. ""Dear Frankie"" is an engaging family drama with an attractive and talented cast that manages to avoid most of the clich&eacute;s you might expect of such an improbable story.The DVD (Walt Disney 2005): Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 8 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and an audio commentary. ""The Story of Dear Frankie"" (10 minutes) includes interviews with director Shona Auerbach, producer Caroline Wood, and the film's cast in which they talk about developing the film, story, and characters. ""Interview with Director Shona Auerbach"" (13 minutes) goes into more detail about casting, characters, themes, and visual style, as well as what attracted Auerbach to the project. In the audio commentary, Shona Auerbach provides a scene-by-scene nonstop analysis of, overwhelmingly, characters and story. She mentions an occasional technical detail, but not much information on filming. Subtitles are available for the movie in Spanish and French. Captioning available in English.

901435,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00094AS9A,Mir,"[1, 1]","I saw this film in 2006, although I've wanted to see it since it was first reviewed on television. I remember thinking, ""yes, I think this is a kind of movie I'd enjoy. Gentle and full of real people, with a dash of romance.""It took me a while to find it on DVD. I'd forgotten the name. I only remembered ""The Stranger"" and that a kid was involved.So, I finally get it, watch it, and I think, ""Oh, my. That was wonderful.""Here's why:1. Gerard Butler is a revelation. I'd seen him prior on a DVD I own, Tomb Raider: CRADLE OF LIFE, and thought he was very hot and charismatic, holding his own amazingly well against the also charismatic and physically stunning Angelina Jolie. But in DEAR FRANKIE, he delivers a lower key and layered performance. He's not just the hunk or the bad boy or the muscle-bound hero. He's the unnamed man who comes out of the blue to help a woman who needs him to pretend he's a young boy's daddy. He needs to play his part then leave. For money. But we can see something else: He's a man with secrets, and secret hurts, and deep needs that the film never reveals. No, you see it in Butler's eyes, in his body language, in his reactions. Lovely.2. Emily Mortimer. She is absolutely wonderful as the protective mom who has had a very hard time due to an abusive husband from which she flees. She portrays both determination and vulnerability and neediness and a waifishness that makes you root for her. She's believably desperate.The woman who plays Emily's mother also adds something special to the film, as does the somewhat strange air of the boy Frankie. He's deaf in the film, and he doesn't get much dialogue, so he has to make it work with gestures and expressions. He does fine. A bit wooden in spots, but for the context, it's fine.As the story unfolds and we learn things--why Frankie is deaf, who the Stranger is--and we see a believable chemistry erupt between Butler and Mortimer, all we can do is surrender to the gently-paced, emotional stroll through these wounded people's lives. And that kiss...that kiss. It's so perfectly done, mixing apprehension and desire and all the holding back and baggage and tenderness. Oh, that kiss.A lovely, lovely little film.

With their eyes, body language, understated gestures, they portray more meaning and emotion than 9 out of 10 actors working today.The story is of a mother who has been writing letters pretending to be her sons sailor father on a journey to far off ports on a ship called the Accra, a name she made up.  Now, the real Accra is to arrive in the seaside village they live in and she must find a man to pretend to be the father 'for just one day.'

They move around quite a lot, but somehow letters from his sailor father keep up with them.Frankie's penpal Dad really cares a lot about him, writing him surprisingly descriptive letters of his travels and sending him stamps to add to his collection. Frankie writes back with tales about his school, etc.As a matter of fact, those letters to his Dad are about as expressive as Frankie gets.  He's deaf and does not speak. But he's a sharp cookie, and a champion lip reader and he knows more of what's going on than people think.When the ship Frankie's Dad is on is going to dock in Glasgow's harbor, Frankie believes his father will come to visit him.  He's so convinced, he risks his prized stamp collection to a fellow classmate in a bet.That's not going to happen.  Frankie's Mom has a secret.  She's been renting a post office box and writing the letters to Frankie herself.  When she realizes how broken hearted her son will be, she opts to hire a man to play Dad for a Day.She's looking for a man with no past, no future--and who won't ask questions for the money she pays him.  She gets Gerard Butler, also a sailor, with a melancholy air that speaks of sorrows of his own.What moved both my husband and I about this story was the sheer emotion between the cast. There's obviously a bond between Jack McElhone and the two women playing his kindred.  Gerard Butler can convey more with just a glance or a gesture than most actors can get across with an entire soliloquy.The soundtrack and scenery of this film is also amazing. Music very eloquently portrays the moment without overwhelming it. In the 'making of' sequence on the DVD, the director states they'd used old paintings as their guide to reproducing the Scottish landscape and I believe that was an excellent choice. The area around Glasgow is much as I remembered it, somewhat softened by a gray haze cloaking a harsh, rocky landscape.Warnings:Have a tissue handy for the endScottish accents may necessitate the use of the Closed Captioning buttonThe Macarena",5,Dad for a Day,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2161,"['Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Scottish', 'kid', 'being', 'raised', 'Mother', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Grandmother', 'Nell', 'Mary', 'Riggins', 'move', 'around', 'quite', 'lot', 'somehow', 'letters', 'sailor', 'father', 'keep', 'up', 'them.Frankie', 'penpal', 'Dad', 'really', 'lot', 'writing', 'surprisingly', 'descriptive', 'letters', 'travels', 'sending', 'stamps', 'add', 'collection', 'Frankie', 'back', 'tales', 'school', 'etc.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'letters', 'Dad', 'are', 'as', 'expressive', 'Frankie', 'deaf', 'not', 'speak', 'sharp', 'cookie', 'champion', 'lip', 'reader', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'people', 'think.When', 'ship', 'Frankie', 'Dad', 'going', 'dock', 'Glasgow', 'harbor', 'Frankie', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'visit', 'so', 'convinced', 'prized', 'stamp', 'collection', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'bet.That', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'Frankie', 'Mom', 'secret', 'been', 'renting', 'post', 'office', 'box', 'writing', 'letters', 'Frankie', 'When', 'how', 'broken', 'hearted', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'hire', 'man', 'play', 'Dad', 'Day.She', 'looking', 'man', 'past', 'future', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ask', 'questions', 'money', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'also', 'sailor', 'melancholy', 'air', 'sorrows', 'own.What', 'moved', 'husband', 'about', 'story', 'was', 'sheer', 'emotion', 'cast', 'obviously', 'bond', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'two', 'women', 'playing', 'kindred', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'can', 'convey', 'more', 'just', 'glance', 'gesture', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'get', 'entire', 'soliloquy.The', 'soundtrack', 'scenery', 'film', 'also', 'amazing', 'Music', 'very', 'eloquently', 'moment', 'overwhelming', ""'making"", 'sequence', 'DVD', 'director', ""'d"", 'used', 'old', 'paintings', 'guide', 'reproducing', 'Scottish', 'landscape', 'believe', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'area', 'Glasgow', 'much', 'remembered', 'somewhat', 'softened', 'gray', 'haze', 'cloaking', 'harsh', 'rocky', 'landscape.Warnings', 'Have', 'tissue', 'handy', 'endScottish', 'accents', 'may', 'necessitate', 'use', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'buttonThe', 'Macarena']",Dear Frankie
901453,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00094AS9A,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 2]","This story of a single mother and her deaf son pulls at the heart strings while avoiding the cliches that would have turned it into a standard Hollywood-style romance. Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), on the run from an abusive husband, keeps alive her nine-year-old son's wish for a loving father by writing him letters from what he's led to believe is his sailor father, aboard a cargo ship sailing the high seas. Complications arise when a ship by the same name docks in the town where they are living, and she hires a sailor to impersonate the boy's father for a day.The cast is just fine, with Sharon Small from TV's Inspector Lynley series as a supportive friend to Lizzie, who helps her find a man to play Frankie's father. Meanwhile, Jack McElhone as Frankie provides an intelligent and affecting portrayal of a boy dealing manfully with his disability and life's obstacles, while protecting his mother and her illusions. Intended chiefly as a story about a mother and son, the film also touches (perhaps unwittingly, given the director's comments) on the often unsatisfied need among men for fathers who were emotionally - if not physically - more available in their young lives. In that respect, the sailor, played wonderfully by Gerard Butler, takes on an almost mythic quality. Set in Scotland and shot in and around Glasgow, the film has a coolly northern feel at times, which is appropriate for the bittersweetness of what it has to say about people and what is in their hearts.

They move frequently throughout Scotland, and thus Frankie doesn't get the opportunity to develop friendships as children do.However, Lizzie has never shared the true reason for her frequent moves.  Instead, she tells Frankie that his father is a sailor, always away on an oceanic voyage.  Frankie writes to him regularly, and Lizzie secretly writes back, describing the wonders of the voyage.  It is a cruel irony when, in truth, a ship of the same name docks in town.  Frankie is thrilled at this opportunity to meet his father.Resourceful Lizzie actually hires another sailor ((Gerard Butler)) to ""be"" Frankie's dad for a few days, knowing that he will then disappear on another voyage.But, as you might expect, things get complicated, then even more complicated.

Hebbron ""S B H.""","[3, 3]","This Film is an excellent excorsism on modern family fragmentation, violence and depravation and the damage it inflicts over time alongside a believable hope of healing. The story of a sweet and hopeful 9 year old deaf boy who is duped into a fantasy existance of his Father by his well meaning, damaged and burned out Mum. When the Mum discovers her creation is part fact, shortly after her Son's detection, she has to think quickly to keep the fantasy alive and the reality of his violent Father under wraps (his violence had in reality culmianted in the only thing he ever gave the child, his deafness) The hiring of an intially surly and brooding stranger to play the role for a day has unexpected consequences for both the child and Mother and the bleakness of their existance seems on the brink of blossoming anew. Beautifully touching, teasingly hopeful and played to great effect by the 3 leads, particularly the boy, this film will intrigue you and the gritty realism of working class Scotiish life gives it an edge which dissolves any sugar that might have otherwise crept into the production.

Good work!The first time I saw the film, I needed more help to notice the right things and ask the right questions.  For instance, I wanted more time to watch Frankie as he met with clues to his Mother's Lie.[spoilers] Later it struck me that there is an interesting parallel between Lizzie's Stranger and another Stranger who also (1) came as if from nowhere, (2) won the heart of a needy girl,  (3) showed what a ""real"" Father is like, and then (4) left -- but he is coming back.  What he did was a gift. We don't know when he will return, so we wait.  He is even a hero on a white horse.  There may be a hundred literary parallels, but you will have guessed that I'm talking about Jesus (see the writings of John and Paul in the Bible).Of course I don't mean that the parallel is perfect.  Lizzie's Stranger has his own needs; he is a pale reflection in a troubled pool.  And I don't mean to say that the writer and the director/cinematographer had the other Stranger in mind.  He was off camera; suddenly we realize he is there.Only the surface of this movie is what some people call ""realistic.""  (That's rather like our lives, isn't it?)The problem posed at the outset is Lizzie's Big Lie, and the movie never deals with it to the satisfaction of some people.  Maybe they are right.  But I see the silent mercy of God releasing Lizzie from the spider's web she has woven, the sticky web that protects and ensnares.  God, unrecognized, still cares for Lizzie and Frankie.His mercy is also for a Stranger closed in on himself.  It is even for the man who was Frankie's physical father, when the last of his capacity for self-giving love has died.A few things are done poorly, or are in poor taste.  And, sad to say, ""Dear  Frankie"" shows signs of spiritual emptiness.  Well, so do I.  Let's notice the symptoms, but let's enjoy the film for the good that is in it.Even at the end, Lizzie has something still to learn:  no one has to deserve to be forgiven.The Scottish accent was not too hard to handle, and there are subtitles.

Her mother, Nell (Mary Riggans) announces that if they move again, it will be the last time for her. As Frankie acclimates to his new school, his mom continues about her routine. She travels by bus to a post office box and retrieves the letters that Frankie writes to his dad,  a sailor that has been traveling around the world for years. She writes the letters back to her son, pretending to be the long missing father, purchasing stamps from around the world, concocting fictional travels and making up the name of his father's boat. One day, Frankie learns that his father's boat is due to dock at the Port of Glasgow. Immediately, he has doubts that his father will even want to see him. Lizzie decides to try to hire someone to play his father. Her friend, and boss, Marie (Sharon Small) helps her find ""Davey"" (Gerard Butler, he also played the Phantom in ""The Phantom of the Opera""). Davey is hired to spend one day with Frankie, `before he has to ship out again'. Growing attached to the boy, he offers to spend another day with mother and son.""Dear Frankie"", a new Scottish film directed by Shona Auerbach, is a really great little gem that you should definitely seek out. Playing at a handful of independent theaters, it will slowly roll out to the rest of the country. If you are unable to find it at a theater, catch the DVD when that is released.The beauty of ""Frankie"" is that every character seems real, like someone you might meet on the streets of Glasgow. Emily Mortimer plays Lizzie as a young, single mom who has had a hard life. Her one joy is her son, who is very intelligent, but a deaf mute. Because of the circumstances or her life, which we slowly learn as we watch the film, Lizzie has become withdrawn and feels she can only rely on her mom and son. When she meets Marie, she is reluctant to begin a friendship. But Marie realizes that Lizzie needs the friendship and offers her a part time job at the local chip shop and helps her in other ways. Her mother is a woman that has had her equal share of hard times, but she is trying to get her daughter out of the funk she is living in while protecting them at the same time. Little Frankie is also played in a very natural way by Jack McElhone. In films, children tend to be too precocious or too `adult'. Frankie is neither. As we learn more about him, we see that he is intelligent, shy, interested in a girl in his class and easy to bait into bets by another young boy in his class. His very existence and the letter writing have ensured that he will have an active imagination. But his mother has also helped him develop a strong interest in sea life and all other aquatic areas. Naturally, a little boy who has never met his father but receives regular letters from him will do whatever he can to learn more about his father's world. The walls of Frankie's room are lined with hand drawn pictures of sea life, a map of the world with pins marking the locations of each of his father's letters and more.The part of `Davey' is a difficult one to pull off. Butler brings an air of desperation to the character in the beginning. I mean, why else would a grown man agree to portray a kid's dad for a day, for probably 20 pounds, except that he is desperate for cash. As he spends time with Frankie, he realizes what a great kid he is. Thankfully, the emotions aren't `big' like they might be in a Hollywood film. He comes to this realization slowly. At the end of the day, when he asks Frankie and his mom to spend the next day with him, it makes sense. We believe that `Davey' has actually grown fond of Frankie.The key to this film is that everything is believable and natural. Nothing is played for theatrics or over the top emotion.As the film winds to it's natural climax, we begin to feel the emotion that the characters are feeling and this makes the story all the more powerful and moving.",4,A Great Film,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4019,"['Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'single', 'mother', '9', 'year', 'old', 'deaf', 'mute', 'boy', 'Frankie', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'family', 'tiny', 'family', 'Glasgow', 'mother', 'Nell', 'Mary', 'Riggans', 'move', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'Frankie', 'new', 'school', 'mom', 'routine', 'bus', 'post', 'office', 'box', 'letters', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'sailor', 'been', 'traveling', 'world', 'years', 'letters', 'back', 'son', 'pretending', 'be', 'long', 'missing', 'father', 'purchasing', 'stamps', 'world', 'concocting', 'fictional', 'travels', 'making', 'up', 'name', 'father', 'boat', 'One', 'day', 'Frankie', 'father', 'boat', 'due', 'dock', 'Port', 'Glasgow', 'Immediately', 'doubts', 'father', 'will', 'even', 'want', 'see', 'Lizzie', 'try', 'hire', 'someone', 'play', 'father', 'friend', 'boss', 'Marie', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'find', 'Davey', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'also', 'played', 'Phantom', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Davey', 'hired', 'spend', 'one', 'day', 'Frankie', 'ship', 'out', 'again', 'Growing', 'attached', 'boy', 'spend', 'day', 'mother', 'son', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'new', 'Scottish', 'film', 'directed', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'really', 'great', 'little', 'gem', 'should', 'definitely', 'seek', 'out', 'Playing', 'handful', 'independent', 'theaters', 'will', 'slowly', 'roll', 'out', 'rest', 'country', 'are', 'unable', 'find', 'theater', 'catch', 'DVD', 'when', 'released.The', 'beauty', 'Frankie', 'character', 'real', 'someone', 'might', 'meet', 'streets', 'Glasgow', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Lizzie', 'young', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'one', 'joy', 'son', 'who', 'very', 'intelligent', 'deaf', 'mute', 'circumstances', 'life', 'slowly', 'learn', 'watch', 'film', 'Lizzie', 'become', 'withdrawn', 'feels', 'can', 'only', 'rely', 'mom', 'son', 'When', 'Marie', 'reluctant', 'begin', 'friendship', 'Marie', 'Lizzie', 'friendship', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'local', 'chip', 'shop', 'other', 'ways', 'mother', 'woman', 'had', 'equal', 'share', 'hard', 'times', 'trying', 'get', 'daughter', 'funk', 'living', 'protecting', 'same', 'time', 'Little', 'Frankie', 'also', 'played', 'very', 'natural', 'way', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'films', 'children', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'precocious', 'too', 'adult', 'Frankie', 'neither', 'learn', 'more', 'see', 'intelligent', 'shy', 'interested', 'girl', 'class', 'easy', 'bait', 'bets', 'young', 'boy', 'class', 'very', 'existence', 'letter', 'writing', 'have', 'ensured', 'will', 'have', 'active', 'imagination', 'mother', 'also', 'helped', 'develop', 'strong', 'interest', 'sea', 'life', 'other', 'aquatic', 'areas', 'Naturally', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'father', 'regular', 'letters', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'learn', 'more', 'father', 'world', 'walls', 'Frankie', 'room', 'are', 'lined', 'hand', 'drawn', 'pictures', 'sea', 'life', 'map', 'world', 'pins', 'marking', 'locations', 'father', 'letters', 'more.The', 'part', 'Davey', 'difficult', 'one', 'pull', 'off', 'Butler', 'air', 'desperation', 'character', 'beginning', 'mean', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'grown', 'man', 'agree', 'portray', 'kid', 'dad', 'day', 'probably', '20', 'pounds', 'desperate', 'cash', 'time', 'Frankie', 'what', 'great', 'kid', 'Thankfully', 'emotions', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'might', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'realization', 'slowly', 'end', 'day', 'when', 'Frankie', 'mom', 'spend', 'next', 'day', 'sense', 'believe', 'Davey', 'actually', 'grown', 'fond', 'Frankie.The', 'key', 'film', 'everything', 'believable', 'natural', 'Nothing', 'played', 'theatrics', 'top', 'emotion.As', 'film', 'natural', 'climax', 'begin', 'feel', 'emotion', 'characters', 'are', 'feeling', 'story', 'more', 'powerful', 'moving']",Dear Frankie

It tells the story of Frankie, a hearing impaired boy living in working class Glasgow, Scotland being raised by Lizzie, his single mother and a loving and protecting grandmother. Lizzie does not want Frankie to know the truth about his father, and leads Frankie to believe that his father is a member of the merchant marine traveling the world. Frankie writes letters to his father, and his mother answers them, signing them from the father and enclosing stamps. The boat that Frankie's father is supposed to be sailing on is called the ACCRA and when a ship docks with the same name, Frankie gets his hopes up about meeting his father. To solve the problem, Lizzie hires a man to pose as his father ""Davey."" Frankie spends a magical two days with his pseudo-father and Lizzie finds his wonderful too.The film could easily become a clich&eacute;, which would still be an enjoyable film, but the film remains charming throughout and original to keep the viewers engaged. There is a back-story involving Frankie's true father and the ways in which Lizzie has to come to terms with all that ahs happened in her past. We get glimpses of pain and loneliness in both Lizzie's life and Davey, the man who pretends to be Frankie's father. We also see that Frankie has both strength and wisdom no one realizes. We also see glimpses of the innocence of childhood, particularly when a young girl catches the young Frankie's eyes and the rivalry and friendship Frankie has with his sometimes nemesis and sometimes best friend Ricky Monroe. The film ends leaving the viewer thinking because instead of tidying up loose ends, we wonder what will happen next, but also believe that things will turn out better for Frankie, his mother, and Davey.A wonderful script, and authentic setting, and convincing performances by Gerard Butler as Davey, Emily Mortimer as Lizzie and bets of all, young Jack Mc Elhone as Frankie make this a film that will be loved by viewers and enjoyed for years to come.",5,A Film That Is Sure To Move Your Heart,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,2147,"['DEAR', 'FRANKIE', 'elements', 'film', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'lovable', 'characters', 'pluck', 'determination', 'story', 'moving', 'believable', 'story', 'Frankie', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'boy', 'living', 'working', 'class', 'Glasgow', 'Scotland', 'being', 'raised', 'Lizzie', 'single', 'mother', 'loving', 'protecting', 'grandmother', 'Lizzie', 'not', 'want', 'Frankie', 'know', 'truth', 'father', 'Frankie', 'believe', 'father', 'member', 'merchant', 'marine', 'traveling', 'world', 'Frankie', 'letters', 'father', 'mother', 'answers', 'signing', 'father', 'enclosing', 'stamps', 'boat', 'Frankie', 'father', 'supposed', 'be', 'sailing', 'called', 'ACCRA', 'when', 'ship', 'same', 'name', 'Frankie', 'up', 'meeting', 'father', 'solve', 'problem', 'Lizzie', 'man', 'pose', 'father', 'Davey', 'Frankie', 'magical', 'two', 'days', 'pseudo-father', 'Lizzie', 'wonderful', 'too.The', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'clich', 'eacute', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'film', 'charming', 'original', 'keep', 'viewers', 'engaged', 'back-story', 'involving', 'Frankie', 'true', 'father', 'ways', 'Lizzie', 'come', 'terms', 'ahs', 'happened', 'past', 'get', 'glimpses', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'Lizzie', 'life', 'Davey', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'Frankie', 'father', 'also', 'see', 'Frankie', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'one', 'also', 'see', 'glimpses', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'particularly', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'young', 'Frankie', 'eyes', 'rivalry', 'friendship', 'Frankie', 'sometimes', 'nemesis', 'sometimes', 'best', 'friend', 'Ricky', 'Monroe', 'film', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'instead', 'tidying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'also', 'believe', 'things', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'Davey.A', 'wonderful', 'script', 'authentic', 'setting', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Davey', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Lizzie', 'bets', 'young', 'Jack', 'Mc', 'Elhone', 'Frankie', 'make', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'loved', 'viewers', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'come']",Dear Frankie

It just sounded a little too corny and cliched for my cynical little tastes.But I was seriously bowled over by how good this movie was, and the acting is what makes it so touching. The boy playing Frankie was amazing-he had this face that conveyed so much without ever speaking. His mother, played by Emily Mortimer, was heartbreaking-her slightest actions illustrated what a wounded soul she was, and yet a survivor as well. And ""the stranger""-played by Gerard Butler-really does just up the emotional ante like 10 knots. As the imposter Dad, he really does figure into the most powerful scenes of the movie with his mixed feelings of wanting to distance himself and yet connect with the loveable Frankie-as well as the mother.....This movie is a keeper-I'm buying it on amazon.com tonight cause it's one of those movies you'll easily watch more than once. While the premise sounds sorta like a lame romantic comedy set up, this isn't a romantic comedy.

901473,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00094AS9A,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler are fantastic in this small film set in Scotland.  Though some say the story is simple (at first sight, yes), I strongly recommend that you watch the film without knowing the plot, even the situations of the characters.  Trust me, there are surely some flaws and plot holes, but if you need a good-hearted, sincerely-made drama, 'Dear Frankie' is the one for you.[MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED] The film is about Lizzie and Frankie, mother and son who just moved to another city in Scotland with the grandmother.  Lizzie, she thinks, is protecting her deaf son from the painful past, which has something to do with their ever-moving lifestyle.  These secrets are not surprising, as you see, but a more important thing is to be revealed.That is the letters Frankie keeps on writing to his father, who he thinks is a sailor, always on the ship ACCRA, someday coming back to him.  The fact is, you know, the real father is not someone Frankie imagines, but for the understandable reasons Lizzie keeps on lying to her son.But what if the ship named ACCRA is really coming to the port of the city?  What if Frankie wants to meet his ""real"" father?  That's when Gerard Butler's stranger steps in, acting as Frankie's father.  What follows after that, you must see for yourself.[GOOD LOCATION AND CHARACTERS] Shona Auerbach (her feature debut), doing photography too, is successful in presenting the feeling of the Scottish city and the people, with a great help from the well-chosen locations and the talented actors.  Emily Mortimer (seen in 'Disney's 'The Kid' and others) is effective as Lizzie, but more impressive is Gerard Butler, who becomes a perfectly credible 'stranger' with a lillte bit of mystery.  As you know, he was in 'Attila' 'Dracula 2000' and yes, 'Phantom of the Opera.'  In 'Dear Frankie' he proves that he can be a good-natured, ordinary male human without losing the charisma he showed in the past.Though I disagree with the director's decision to include some characters (especially the role of Davey), and the ending could be shorter and tighter, the film is very good as it is, in not only presenting the unique story, but showing the details of the life of these people, without which the impact from the final letter would be a false one.  As it is, despite some implausible situations, 'Dear Frankie' is a small but very touching film.",4,Gerard 'Phantom' Butler Plays the Daddy with No Name: Small But Touching Film,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2386,"['Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'are', 'fantastic', 'small', 'film', 'set', 'Scotland', 'say', 'story', 'simple', 'first', 'sight', 'yes', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'film', 'knowing', 'plot', 'even', 'situations', 'characters', 'Trust', 'are', 'surely', 'flaws', 'plot', 'holes', 'need', 'good-hearted', 'sincerely-made', 'drama', ""'Dear"", 'Frankie', 'one', '[', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED', ']', 'film', 'Lizzie', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'city', 'Scotland', 'grandmother', 'Lizzie', 'protecting', 'deaf', 'son', 'painful', 'past', 'something', 'do', 'ever-moving', 'lifestyle', 'secrets', 'are', 'not', 'surprising', 'see', 'more', 'important', 'thing', 'be', 'revealed.That', 'letters', 'Frankie', 'keeps', 'writing', 'father', 'who', 'sailor', 'always', 'ship', 'ACCRA', 'someday', 'coming', 'back', 'fact', 'know', 'real', 'father', 'not', 'someone', 'Frankie', 'imagines', 'understandable', 'reasons', 'Lizzie', 'lying', 'son.But', 'what', 'ship', 'named', 'ACCRA', 'really', 'coming', 'port', 'city', 'What', 'Frankie', 'meet', 'real', 'father', 'when', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'stranger', 'steps', 'acting', 'Frankie', 'father', 'What', 'must', 'see', '[', 'GOOD', 'LOCATION', 'AND', 'CHARACTERS', ']', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'feature', 'debut', 'doing', 'photography', 'too', 'successful', 'presenting', 'feeling', 'Scottish', 'city', 'people', 'great', 'help', 'well-chosen', 'locations', 'talented', 'actors', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'seen', ""'Disney"", ""'The"", 'Kid', 'others', 'effective', 'Lizzie', 'more', 'impressive', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'perfectly', 'credible', ""'stranger"", 'lillte', 'bit', 'mystery', 'know', 'was', ""'Attila"", ""'Dracula"", '2000', 'yes', ""'Phantom"", 'Opera', ""'Dear"", 'Frankie', 'can', 'be', 'good-natured', 'ordinary', 'male', 'human', 'losing', 'charisma', 'showed', 'past.Though', 'disagree', 'director', 'decision', 'include', 'characters', 'especially', 'role', 'Davey', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'shorter', 'tighter', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'only', 'presenting', 'unique', 'story', 'showing', 'details', 'life', 'people', 'impact', 'final', 'letter', 'would', 'be', 'false', 'one', 'implausible', 'situations', 'Frankie', 'small', 'very', 'touching', 'film']",Dear Frankie

901476,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00094AS9A,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[1, 1]","A Scottish mom tries to maintain a relationship via post between her nine-year-old deaf son and a made-up father, while on the run from his real, abusive father. This won Best Picture at the Los Angeles Film Festival, awards at Heartland and Seattle International Film Festivals, two thumbs up from Ebert & Roper, and a rave review from Leonard Maltin. Independent director Shona Auerbach's brings a rare sensitivity to this her debut film.Working mom Lizzie (Emily Mortimer - Two Brothers & A Bride, Disney's The Kid) is faced with the moral dilemma of either telling her son the truth: that his absent father was abusive to him, and that is why he is now deaf; or, propagating a lie - that his father is a sailor away at sea, who writes to him regularly, expressing his love for and interest in the boy - letters which she herself writes. And Frankie, her son (Jack McElhone - Young Adam), answers them, as he tracks the path of his dad's ship on a world map hanging by his bed. Lizzie keeps telling herself that she is going to stop writing the letters and tell him the truth; but she continues. When asked why, she says, ""It's the only way I can hear his voice."" You see, Frankie has never spoken, except through his letters.This is an incredibly poignant film, which pulls on your heartstrings throughout. A crisis occurs one day when the ship that she told Frankie his father was stationed on actually shows up in port. One of the boy's friends makes a bet that his dad won't come see him; but Frankie accepts his bet, saying that he'll bring him to their next soccer match. Lizzie decides she can't let Frankie down, and that she will have to find someone to play the part of Frankie's dad for a day. After a failed attempt at finding someone in a sailors' bar, and a night of desperate depression, her friend Marie (Sharon Small - Inspector Lynley Mysteries) offers to help by giving her the name of a Stranger. The Stranger (Gerard Butler - Phantom Of The Opera, Attila) turns out to be more than Lizzie bargained for: not only is he the perfect ""father"" for Frankie, but she finds herself being drawn to him emotionally as well. There is a definite chemistry between Lizzie and the Stranger, and between the Stranger and Frankie.Now she really does face a dilemma. She has spent years building walls around her heart and life to protect herself and her son from his abusive father, as well as trying to put miles between them and him. They are literally on the run as he continues to pursue them. Now, here is a Stranger asking her to let her walls down. What should she do? And what should she tell Frankie about his father?There are no easy answers. She's going to have to give up some things in order to have certain other things. She's going to have to decide what's most important. That's not so simple in relationships where you're afraid of hurting the ones you love, and when you've been hurt and are afraid of being hurt again. I love these types of stories because they are like life: you have to give up something or someone you want for something or someone else you need or want more. Life is about choices. Will Lizzie make the right ones? It's a great dilemma, and a great film.This is an honest story that unfolds naturally and leaves you wanting more. The performances are top-notch all the way around. Production values are high, as Auerbach realizes her vision perfectly. This is a little film with a big heart that will leave men longing for their fathers and women longing for Gerard Butler, the current heartthrob, as well as an excellent actor with a promising future.Waitsel Smith",5,SWEET ROMANCE INVOLVING MORAL DILEMMA,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,3614,"['Scottish', 'mom', 'tries', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'post', 'nine-year-old', 'deaf', 'son', 'made-up', 'father', 'run', 'real', 'abusive', 'father', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Film', 'Festival', 'awards', 'Heartland', 'Seattle', 'International', 'Film', 'Festivals', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Ebert', 'Roper', 'rave', 'review', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'Independent', 'director', 'Shona', 'Auerbach', 'brings', 'rare', 'sensitivity', 'debut', 'film.Working', 'mom', 'Lizzie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'A', 'Bride', 'Disney', 'Kid', 'faced', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'telling', 'son', 'truth', 'absent', 'father', 'was', 'abusive', 'why', 'now', 'deaf', 'propagating', 'lie', 'father', 'sailor', 'away', 'sea', 'who', 'regularly', 'expressing', 'love', 'interest', 'boy', 'letters', 'Frankie', 'son', 'Jack', 'McElhone', 'Young', 'Adam', 'path', 'dad', 'ship', 'world', 'map', 'hanging', 'bed', 'Lizzie', 'telling', 'going', 'stop', 'writing', 'letters', 'tell', 'truth', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'hear', 'voice', 'see', 'Frankie', 'never', 'spoken', 'letters.This', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'film', 'heartstrings', 'crisis', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'ship', 'told', 'Frankie', 'father', 'was', 'stationed', 'actually', 'up', 'port', 'One', 'boy', 'friends', 'bet', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'see', 'Frankie', 'bet', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'next', 'soccer', 'match', 'Lizzie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'Frankie', 'down', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'someone', 'play', 'part', 'Frankie', 'dad', 'day', 'failed', 'attempt', 'finding', 'someone', 'sailors', 'bar', 'night', 'desperate', 'depression', 'friend', 'Marie', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'help', 'giving', 'name', 'Stranger', 'Stranger', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Attila', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'Lizzie', 'bargained', 'not', 'only', 'perfect', 'father', 'Frankie', 'being', 'drawn', 'emotionally', 'as', 'well', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'Lizzie', 'Stranger', 'Stranger', 'Frankie.Now', 'really', 'face', 'dilemma', 'spent', 'years', 'building', 'walls', 'heart', 'life', 'protect', 'son', 'abusive', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'put', 'miles', 'are', 'literally', 'run', 'pursue', 'Now', 'here', 'Stranger', 'asking', 'let', 'walls', 'down', 'What', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'should', 'tell', 'Frankie', 'father', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'going', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'things', 'order', 'have', 'certain', 'other', 'things', 'going', 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'relationships', 'where', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'hurting', 'ones', 'love', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hurt', 'are', 'afraid', 'being', 'hurt', 'again', 'love', 'types', 'stories', 'are', 'like', 'life', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'something', 'someone', 'want', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'need', 'want', 'more', 'Life', 'choices', 'Will', 'Lizzie', 'make', 'right', 'ones', 'great', 'dilemma', 'great', 'film.This', 'honest', 'story', 'naturally', 'wanting', 'more', 'performances', 'are', 'top-notch', 'way', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'Auerbach', 'vision', 'perfectly', 'little', 'film', 'big', 'heart', 'will', 'leave', 'men', 'longing', 'fathers', 'women', 'longing', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'current', 'heartthrob', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'actor', 'promising', 'future.Waitsel', 'Smith']",Dear Frankie

I really wanted to see Gerard Butler in this film, because I loved his portrayal of The Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera. I am a little disappointed that while his role is so touching and wonderful, he's not the lead. This movie belongs to Emily Mortimer and Jack McElhone. They played struggling mother and son, and their performances are so ""tearjerking""!Lizzie(Mortimer) lives with her mother Nell(Mary Riggans) and a 9 year old son Frankie(McElhone) who became deaf many years earlier as a result of physical abuse by her no-good ex-husband. Frankie doesn't know the truth about his absent father, and his mother pretends to be the father writing letters to Frankie from other countries. Frankie gets bullied at school, and he's hoping that his Da would come home soon. Then Lizzie starts to go out to bars in hoping to find an ideal man to pretend to be Frankie's father for a day. She meets the handsome sailor(Butler) who reluctantly agreed to help her, and he had to read some of the letters so he could be convincing when he meets Frankie.Frankie was so happy to see his ""father"" for the first time, and they spend a day on the beach and had a great time. The sailor was so moved by the affection of Frankie and insisted on playing the role for a few extra days. Lizzie and the sailor also connected to each romantically, even though he had to make his departure soon. Just when Lizzie thought she was making her life better, her bed-ridden ailing ex-husband wants to be involved in Frankie's life again. Can Frankie face the secrets and lies kept by her mother?Emily Mortimer was mesmerizing in numerous scenes, especially when she reveal the truth about Frankie's life to the sailor, and then breaking down emotionally. I also enjoyed the moments shared between Frankie and the sailor. I found that the accent spoken in this movie is very authentic and strong that I had to turn on the subtitles in order to know all the lines being delivered.

The Scottish landscape is lovely, it makes me want to visit Scotland again.  The Scottish accents are very pleasing (though I had to watch this with the subtitles the first time).  And it has Gerard Butler! I definately recommend this movie.",5,Great Romantic Movie,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,319,"['movie', 'rather', 'subtle', 'somewhat', 'slow-moving', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Scottish', 'landscape', 'lovely', 'want', 'visit', 'Scotland', 'again', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'are', 'very', 'pleasing', 'had', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'first', 'time', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'definately', 'recommend', 'movie']",Dear Frankie
