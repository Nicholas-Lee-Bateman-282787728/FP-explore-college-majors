Kelly Le Brock portrays the stunning, goddess-like woman who is denied to most of we mere mortals.  Gene Wilder plays the sort of creepy guy whom creepy guys like me aspire to be like!Theodore (Wilder), is a normal, happily married man who lives an average life.  That is, until he happens to see a breath-taking woman in red (Le Brock).  His encounter with her makes him study his life and ask the age-old question:  ""Is this all that there is?""  He decides to pursue the woman in red, but he has two problems.  (1):  He has a very jealous wife, and has seen the disastrous consequences of his friends getting caught cheating 1st hand.  (2):  As we've already said, mere mortals typically don't stand a chance to get the time-of-day from Supermodels.The film has a few ""flat"" spots, but also has a handful of classic scenes.  The late Gilda Radner is great as the poor innocent girl who gets caught in-the-middle of Theodore's gambit.  Still, this is certainly not the funniest or most-entertaining RC film I've ever seen.Perhaps the most important aspect of the film is Kelly Le Brock.  I've always been dismayed that she didn't do more films.  She ""nails"" the part of the model who is a coveted object-of-desire.  Yes, there are plenty of beautiful women in Hollywood.  However, only a small percentage of them could pull off this part.  Merely being gorgeous was not good enough for this part;  a certain ""mystery"" was required as well.  Le Brock certainly has that mystery about her that always mesmerizes creepy guys like me - and she always has had it.
