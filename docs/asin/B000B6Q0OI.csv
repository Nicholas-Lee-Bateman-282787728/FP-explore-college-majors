It includes mini interviews with class members and instructors and some nice explanations of why they do certain things in training and how that will help out Seals in real life combat situations.

Within a few minutes of starting the DVD you are immersed, up close and personal, in the SEALs version of boot camp.  You see otherwise strong and qualified trainees dropping.  The trainers are professional yet tough.  The word &#34;endurance&#34; takes on a new meaning after seeing this film.  And it can inspire people to do a lot more in their physical and intellectual endeavors (even SEALs say their training can be applied to their personal lives).  While the typical American is remote from such extreme training there are still ways to learn about determination from this film.This film was valuable enough to be featured in the opening sequence of the movie LONE SURVIVOR.

This series is completely worth your purchase, it covers the training from day one. You get to see the class whittled down bit by bit, but what is most impressive to me is the mental attitude that those who stay seem to have. The video quality is good but not Bluray quality, the sound is good as well. Phase 1 of the training is the most interesting, and you start to view the series through the eyes of the instructors, looking for who is good and who's not ready, but at the same time you are rooting for every single one of them. They're not gods, just regular guys who want to be wet, cold, miserable and put themselves in harm's way. I am generally not a fan of reality TV.

Yes, the trainees are being pushed beyond their limits, but the instructors are watching closely for any signs of a health crises.

There were a few things that Discovery could have done a better job at.(1) These videos badly need closed captioning. The audio is often garbled and I often had to figure out what was going on from the context; I missed a lot of jokes and technical details.  (2) I expected them to show the famous drown proofing evolution, where the men are expected to do various things in the pool with their hands and feet bound.  (3) Though they showed some of the O-Course workouts, the better ones, like climbing the 60 foot cargo net and shimmying across a long rope suspended high above the ground were not shown.  They never showed anyone running the entire O-Course. (4) Finally, the screen titles displayed before the beginning of each segment implied that the entire course was 8 weeks, when in fact, BUD/S lasts 6 months.You can go to the Navy SEALS website and YouTube to see videos of each segment of training, including the drown proofing evolution and seeing  an instructor run the O-Course, but these training segments should have been shown in the video.With these faults, I still recommend this video and give it 5 stars because, as far as I know, this is the only video of it's kind. It was more fun to watch than most 5 star movies.
