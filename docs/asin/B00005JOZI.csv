People that were even at historic events will say ""it was like a movie"". How can you ever know what it would be like to be on a plane that you and everyone on board knows is going to crash? You can't. It transcends waking consciousness. It still can be imagined, however. It can be portrayed in such a way as to give you the viewer *some* idea -I really believe this after seeing UNITED 93. And it is scary as hell. If you allow yourself to be absorbed by this film I feel you'll come as close as a movie can take you in having some sense -just some- of the sheer terror. You are going to die. It's over. It is over. Your life is gone. You begin to realize this. At first there is denial of coarse but one way or another reality sets in for you. You will never see your family again. You will never eat again, hug your child again, go to the park again, go to the movies again, make love again, nothing. Your going to die in the worst way. You are about to be broken, ripped apart, burned. What awaits you? Are you even able to think or you just overcome? The horror. The flood of emotion, of thoughts, images, your life flashing before you. People freaking out around you. Murderous little foreign relgious nuts, creeps with box cutters stabbing people. What are you going to do? What do you do? What can you do? You'll never really know unless your in that situation. Some people on that plane decided not to just sit there and wait to die. That's not too bad a way to go out. UNITED 93 is a fine film and does justice to this historic moment in American history. Credit is to be given to director Paul Greengrass [THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, and the upcoming GREEN ZONE(!)] for his talents in depicting real-life events in such an outstanding way.Watch it alone or with someone who can sit through a movie without running their mouth. Turn the lights off, turn the cell phone off, shut up, and sit there straight through, no interruptions. But don't buy it, it's a rental. I don't know why or how someone would want to sit through this ride multiple times. One, maybe two trips is enough.",5,feels real?,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,2227,"['want', 'reality', 'People', 'want', 'talk', 'movie', 'being', 'realistic', 'people', 'talk', 'real', 'events', 'being', 'movie-like', 'People', 'were', 'even', 'historic', 'events', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'movie', 'How', 'can', 'ever', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'plane', 'everyone', 'board', 'going', 'crash', 'ca', ""n't"", 'waking', 'consciousness', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'imagined', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'portrayed', 'such', 'way', 'give', 'viewer', '*some*', 'idea', '-I', 'really', 'believe', 'seeing', 'UNITED', '93', 'scary', 'hell', 'allow', 'be', 'absorbed', 'film', 'feel', ""'ll"", 'come', 'as', 'close', 'movie', 'can', 'take', 'having', 'sense', '-just', 'some-', 'sheer', 'terror', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'over', 'life', 'gone', 'begin', 'realize', 'first', 'denial', 'coarse', 'one', 'way', 'reality', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'family', 'again', 'will', 'never', 'eat', 'again', 'hug', 'child', 'again', 'go', 'park', 'again', 'go', 'movies', 'again', 'make', 'love', 'again', 'nothing', 'going', 'die', 'worst', 'way', 'are', 'be', 'broken', 'ripped', 'apart', 'burned', 'What', 'Are', 'even', 'able', 'think', 'just', 'overcome', 'horror', 'flood', 'emotion', 'thoughts', 'images', 'life', 'flashing', 'People', 'freaking', 'out', 'Murderous', 'little', 'foreign', 'relgious', 'nuts', 'creeps', 'box', 'cutters', 'stabbing', 'people', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'What', 'can', 'do', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know', 'situation', 'people', 'plane', 'decided', 'not', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'wait', 'die', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'way', 'go', 'out', 'UNITED', '93', 'fine', 'film', 'justice', 'historic', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'Credit', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', '[', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'SUPREMACY', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'ULTIMATUM', 'upcoming', 'GREEN', 'ZONE', ']', 'talents', 'depicting', 'real-life', 'events', 'such', 'outstanding', 'way.Watch', 'alone', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'movie', 'running', 'mouth', 'Turn', 'lights', 'turn', 'cell', 'phone', 'shut', 'up', 'sit', 'there', 'straight', 'interruptions', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'how', 'someone', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'ride', 'multiple', 'times', 'One', 'maybe', 'two', 'trips', 'enough']",United 93

The action focuses mainly on the air traffic control towers and the one flight that managed to thwart the intentions of its hijackers.  It is good that the scope was chosen as it is. The movie is focused, but frenetic, a believable presentation of that inconceivable day.  Yet, it doesn't ignore the other aspects of 9/11 either.  Some of the actual people play themselves in the movie, and the actual footage of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon give the movie a poignant presentation.  Furthermore, the events unfold in a way that is plausible and realistic.Why see this movie?  I wonder myself, 'Is it morbid curiosity that brings one to this film?' The answer is simple:  It documents the courage of Tod Beamer and other real heroes that tragic day when America was otherwise blind-sided by a small group of deluded thugs.  9/11 is still unbelievable, and four and a half years later, we need to be reawoken to the consequences of that terrible day.  Nearly everyone is shown with slow reaction time, but their incredulousness is understandable.  (Some of the bureacracy should have taught us many lessons.) The movie honors the people of United flight 93 and puts a set of faces on the tragedy.  ""United 93"" gives us another chance to grieve, appreciate, and remember.

644094,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00005JOZI,Aco,"[13, 14]","The first theatrical film to deal with 9/11, Paul Greengrass' unflinching and harrowing United 93 boldly re-creates the plane flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers thwarted the hijackers bent on crashing the plane into a DC building.The current controversy with Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, to which a cry of ""Too Soon"" echoes was also pointed at United 93. Within that uncertainty about 9/11 as film subject, Greengrass essentially has produced a terse, stomach-churning documentary, or rather dramatization, featuring the actual people in control towers, and flight control centers.As a film on it's own, United 93 could be called a horror film, a thriller, or a documentary. But 9/11 is such a monumental time in history that anyone unfamiliar with it would be even harder to find than a theatre featuring the film itself, so it's existence as film comes with a weight uncomparable to any other moment in a generation.I praise Greengrass for his attention to detail, his use of the actual people who were there and involved that day, and his ability to produce the supposed experience of the people on the plane, hi-jackers included, as well as his direction-jumping from the plane to the ground with a pacing that is very tense and emotionally jarring.Had I might avoided seeing this, I would have avoided experiencing the incredible actions of many people that day, as well as witnessed a film so well made and expressed that it's place in history must be as a landmark.",5,"Un, Un, Un, Un, UnBelievably Powerful FILM",1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,1504,"['first', 'theatrical', 'film', 'deal', '9/11', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'unflinching', 'harrowing', 'United', '93', 'boldly', 'plane', 'flight', 'crashed', 'Pennsylvania', 'field', 'passengers', 'thwarted', 'hijackers', 'bent', 'crashing', 'plane', 'DC', 'building.The', 'current', 'controversy', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'cry', 'Too', 'Soon', 'echoes', 'was', 'also', 'pointed', 'United', '93', 'uncertainty', 'about', '9/11', 'film', 'subject', 'Greengrass', 'essentially', 'produced', 'terse', 'stomach-churning', 'documentary', 'rather', 'dramatization', 'featuring', 'actual', 'people', 'control', 'towers', 'flight', 'control', 'film', 'own', 'United', '93', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'horror', 'film', 'thriller', 'documentary', '9/11', 'such', 'monumental', 'time', 'history', 'anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'harder', 'find', 'theatre', 'featuring', 'film', 'existence', 'film', 'weight', 'uncomparable', 'other', 'moment', 'generation.I', 'praise', 'Greengrass', 'attention', 'detail', 'use', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'involved', 'day', 'ability', 'produce', 'supposed', 'experience', 'people', 'plane', 'hi-jackers', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'direction-jumping', 'plane', 'ground', 'pacing', 'very', 'tense', 'emotionally', 'jarring.Had', 'might', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'would', 'have', 'avoided', 'experiencing', 'incredible', 'actions', 'many', 'people', 'day', 'as', 'well', 'witnessed', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'expressed', 'place', 'history', 'must', 'be', 'landmark']",United 93
644095,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JOZI,A Customer,"[7, 11]","I guess we can all remember what we were doing on that day five years ago. Now we have Paul Greengrass's explosive movie United 93 to yet again remind us of how that fateful day played out. Set up very much like a documentary, and taking place in real time, United 93 puts you right there onboard United Airlines Flight 93, the fourth hijacked plane on Sept. 11, 2001, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field, just short of its intended target - probably the Capitol Building.For the crew, the passengers, and indeed the air traffic controllers in both Boston and New York, the day started like any other. In New York it was a beautiful summer's morning as the intended passengers for United Flight 93 arrived at La Guardia, ready to fly home to San Francisco. The pilots make small talk, while the air stewards' joke about personal stuff. People are seen working on laptops and talking into cell phones as the plane is loaded up with jet fuel. Mark Bingham arrives late just as the plane is finishing boarding.Little do the passengers know that sitting amongst them at the departure gate are four young men of Middle Eastern descent who intent to hijack the plane and use it as a suicide missile. Unfortunately, due to heavy traffic the flight is late leaving, but once it's in the air, the hijackers seem to breath a sigh of relief. We watch as they wait and wait for it seems like forever to make their move, and then, once they do, we also observe as the passengers realize the World Trade Center has been hit after talking with their loved ones on the ground.Meanwhile, during these breathless, heart-stopping moments, the film cuts away to the desperation and confusion in airport control towers, the FAA's overwhelmed operations command center in Herndon, Va., and the military's unprepared operations center at the Northeast Air Defense Sector in upstate New York. One of the air traffic controllers in Boston suddenly realizes that American Airlines flight 11 has been hijacked after he hears what he thinks is someone speaking Arabic.His boss acts in disbelief as technicians try frantically to figure out what's happening, and only slowly does the full scale of the morning's pandemonium become viciously, dreadfully clear. For all their monitors and electronic equipment, there is a horrific, low-tech moment when controllers at Newark Airport get a perfect view across the Hudson of the second plane hitting a World Trade Center tower. No one can even speak; everyone is so numb with disbelief at what they are seeing.Using tight jump cut editing, Greengrass skips backwards and forwards between the chaos and lack of communication between the FAA and NORAD and the panicked and then determined passengers who decide to do something about the situation. Obviously, we will never know exactly what happened on the flight. There is evidence from phone calls made from the plane and that's where it ends, but at least we know something monumental took place. Greengrass does a superb job of showing us what very likely did happen.United 93 is just so deeply rooted in reality - no A-list stars here, with the actors largely unknowns. This adds to the authenticity of events as they transpire. Any conversations are overheard in fragmented snippets, and the actors often trip over their pointedly inarticulate dialogue with unrehearsed freshness. You never feel like you're watching a movie, rather you feel like you're just there. The film is indeed a masterpiece and a fitting testament to these ordinary heroes whose defiance and willingness to stand-up to the terrorists is made so palpable.

Other travelers arrive at the terminal, including the crew. The passengers are inspected for hidden weapons, none are found. The passengers board the flight to San Francisco. An air traffic controller notices a problem with Flight 11 out of Boston. [Delays cost $2,000 a minute.] The radar suddenly loses track of Flight 11 when it is near Manhattan. The see smoke coming out of the North Tower (about 8:45 AM). ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" United 175 dropped its transponder. Where is it? It crashes into the South Tower~ Flights are halted in Boston, New York, and Washington. Langley is warned about Flight 11 nearing Washington. When will they engage? The President has to make the call.On board Flight 93 one of the terrorists makes a bomb in the rest room. They start stabbing the passengers and enter the cockpit to remove the pilots. Air Traffic Controller hear the disturbance and note the change in direction. They have to get the plane before it gets withing 50 or 60 miles from Washington! ""Our time has come"" says the terrorist who is flying the plane. ""Where are those fighter jets?"" The flight attendants try to calm the passengers. ""The Vice-President can make the call."" The news tells of the attack on the Pentagon. All planes are ordered to land, foreign flights are turned back. Some of the passengers decide to fight back since they have nothing to lose. Where can they get weapons? Others make calls on the air phones. Can they come up with a plan?The passengers attack the hijackers, one goes down. They push a cart against the other terrorist and he goes down. Next the cart is used as a battering ram against the cockpit door so they can attack the last two terrorists. No one can control the airplane so the flight makes an unscheduled landing. It was the only aircraft that failed to reach its target; this saved the Capitol or the White House from attack and destruction. By the time the President authorized shooting down hijacked aircraft it was all over. US airspace was closed, no civilian airliner was in the skies.This film explains why there should be a memorial to the heroic passengers on Flight 93 - in Washington DC. The credits name the real people and the actors who portrayed them. Some actors were the real people who were involved. Could this hijacking have occurred in earlier times when the pilot was required to be armed and many passengers would also be armed? Should the US government have been more diligent? I wonder how they were able to reconstruct the events in the plane when no one survived?

The way United 93 is filmed, by using a handheld camera, and recorded in real time, lets us experience the unprecedented chaos and horror on the morning of September 11, 2001.Part of Greengrass's brilliance is that he avoids sentimentality. Rather, the film highlights the defiance of the passengers aboard United 93, by using the facts, as far as we know them, to launch into an admirable last-ditch attack on the hijackers.This film did fill me with grief and despair, but leaves one feeling why stories matter so much to us. Watching and thinking about United 93, and listening to the families of those that were passengers aboard the flight, shown in the Special Features section of the DVD, is cathartic experience.I highly recommend this film and the Special features section that accompanies the DVD. By doing this, it reminded me of the courage of the passengers aboard United 93, but also of the fortitude of the families.

I heard the only actors were the people abroad the plane but the air traffic controllers, flight attendants, and pilots were played by real people.

The filmmakers did extensive research so that the film could portray as accurate a picture of the events as possible. They talked to the families of the survivors and got them on board before making the film, consulted with them, and gave them a special showing before the film was released, so the families feelings were taken into account. There were no Hollywood type invented side stories or personal dramas added to the story line. The movie, United 93 didn't just take place on the airplane, but much of it also took place in various control towers, which was quite interesting. Also some of the people in the film were the actual people who were involved with the events at the time. If you don't mind revisiting 9/11, I would recommend this film to you. I don't think any movie could do a better, more responsible job than United 93.",4,A Tragedy Told As Close To The Way It Was As Possible,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,899,"['United', '93', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'film', 'though', 'hard', 'watch', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'extensive', 'research', 'film', 'could', 'portray', 'accurate', 'picture', 'events', 'possible', 'talked', 'families', 'survivors', 'got', 'board', 'making', 'film', 'consulted', 'gave', 'special', 'showing', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'families', 'feelings', 'were', 'taken', 'account', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'invented', 'side', 'stories', 'personal', 'dramas', 'added', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'United', '93', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'place', 'airplane', 'much', 'also', 'took', 'place', 'various', 'control', 'towers', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Also', 'people', 'film', 'were', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'events', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'revisiting', '9/11', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'more', 'responsible', 'job', 'United', '93']",United 93

Of course people are ready. Did anyone ask that question during World War 2? Hollywood was turing out movies about the war left and right. Surely audiences members had loved ones fighting abroad. Did any one say, hey wait a minute, there's a war going on, people don't want to see a movie about a war. What about films such as ""Since You Went Away"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", two of the greatest films made dealing with how the war effected the home front. Did people shout, ""too soon!"" Of course not.""United 93"" is one of the most intense, absorbing, touching, heartfelt movie going experiences I have had all year. No movie has touched me in such a profound way since ""The Passion of the Christ"". ""United 93"" is more than a movie. It transends comments such as ""best film of the year"". It is above that.It should be pointless to go over plot description, so let me discuss my reaction to the film. First of all the movie makes no moral judgements. All the movie does, similar to a documentary, is show us what happened and allow us to come up with our own thoughts. We don't need to be told what happened on September 11th was bad. We don't need to be told the people who hijacked these planes were evil. So the movies doesn't feel any need to state the obvious.But, ""United 93"" does raise some questions, only I'm not sure we are suppose to talk about them. I don't want to make ""United 93"" sound like a political film, it doesn't have a left or right point of view, but political questions will stir in your brain as you watch the movie. For instance, if the President could have been reached, what would have changed? Why couldn't the president be reached? Why did all branches involved not know what the other was doing? If every second was vital, what does the president's famous ""seven minute"" blackout tell us? Should he have done something?The truly great movies make us ask questions. Not because they have plot-holes, but because we become so involved with the characters we don't want the film to end. We linger on and on about the characters and the events. ""United 93"" makes us ask a lot of questions.Here's one more thing to think about. Remember when ""The Passion of the Christ"" came out, and groups were afraid it was going to cause anti-Semitism? I haven't heard a word from Muslim groups afraid this film would case race riots, have you? Why is that?Ever since 9/11 happened people have claimed the ""united 93"" flight was American propaganda. I don't know enough about the issue to decided whether or not it is or isn't, but, lets assume it is. If it is all a fake, a story the government created to inspire patriotic feelings within us, than strickly as a work of fiction the film is still powerful and emotionally involving. But a bigger question lies underneath all this. Is it okay to talk about 9/11 and ask questions? Will this film push forward a debate?""United 93"" is a film everyone should see. Is it difficult to watch? Yes. I'm not going to lie to you. You may have the urge to look away, but don't. This is a gripping, emotionally draining experience that will linger in your mind long afterwards. It may even take a while for you to decided if it was good or not. But that's okay. See the movie, think it over, and most importantly, ask questions.Bottom-line: The year's most emotionally draining, heartfelt, intense,and absorbing films I have seen since ""The Passion of the Christ"". I look at this work of art and feel it is more than a movie.

Beverly""","[25, 33]","Let's say only one percent of the members of the religion of peace want you dead, that's some ten million killers.  Half a percent?  Five million killers.  Since the ratio on September 11th was about a dozen to three thousand, it will only take a handful of that ten million to completely destroy the American way of life.This movie showed the raw truth, a huge chunk of the worlds population wants America gone.  Dead.  Killed.  Murdered.  The religion they use may have plenty of peaceful members but as this movie, this true story, shows; it only takes a few to murder masses of people.Why should you see this movie?  Because sometimes it takes raw emotion, raw reality to wake us up to reality.  There is a war and it's ugly.  This movie was a war movie, a real war movie.  Not a made up story, but a real story.As a movie?  Yes, as a dramatic movie it was good.  Next to the Passion, this was the most intense emotional movie I've ever seen.  Should you see it?  Yes.  Every American should see this movie, maybe twice.Did you know a self confessed liberal made this movie?  Yes, and he realizes that we are at war.  It doesn't matter if you hate Bush, hate the war, hate big oil, the bottom line is that if you don't kill terrorists they will kill you, or your neighbor, or someone you love or simply just another American like those depicted in this movie.  Regular Americans killed just for being Americans, living in the land of freedom.Liberals should see this movie twice, maybe three times.  The terrorists want you dead, no matter how much you hate Bush, they still want to kill you.  That was the message in this movie, the underlining story.  They want you dead.As a film, it's a five star, as a message it's a ten star.  They want you dead.  They can't be reasoned with.  They can't be talked to.  They don't care about freedom.  They don't care about liberty.  Perhaps if you convert and accept their leaders, they might let you live, but the bottom line here is that they want you dead.I strongly recommend this movie.  It's not too graphic (blood and gore wise) to take older kids (teens) despite the R rating, and I think, again, that every single America should see this movie.  It should effect how we vote, plan, think and behave in this new world.  The new post 9/11 world.  It wasn't enough when they bombed the trade center, it had to go down for us to get the message, and while it was a horrible act, perhaps it had to be something that big to shock us into realizing that the enemy wants us dead and gone.  This movie drives home that message.  Really drives it home.If you don't normally go to the theater, make an exception and go.  Please.  If you normally vote for the democrats, please go see this movie.  If you don't think that more death and destruction is coming, via the religion of peace, go see this movie.  Also please read A Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam.  Please.Go see this movie and remember 9/11, don't let those hero's of Flight 93 down, they died saving lives on the ground.

It's a roller coaster ride of adrenalin and jagged emotions.  It's also poignant at times and very close to the bone.  Most importantly, it's about an event that was true.I saw ""United 93"" in Sydney as part of the Sydney Film Festival where it received applause at its end.  This rarely happens in Australia.  This is a film that touches everyone.  It is a film that must be seen!Of course, we all know what happened on 11 September 2001.  Thus, the core of the film has no surprises.  However, having said this, the film so clearly reveals how ordinary people going about their own lives were suddenly thrust into a living hell.  Psychotic religious fanatics had come to believe that by hijacking planes and killing innocent people that this would somehow damage the US and heighten the spread of Islam.  Has collective lunacy ever reached such insane heights?  These criminals were not warriors, they were simply misguided killers.  Their inherent evil, unfortunately, came at the cost of so many lives.This film covers the events of that tragic day very well.  We see chaos as both individuals and government bodies simply fail to adequately comprehend the events unfolding around them.  This should come as no surprise as there would be no one who could have expected criminal stupidity on the scale that was seen on that bright September day.

644104,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOZI,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","Paul Greengrass had a hefty undertaking here.  Not even five years had passed since the tragic events of 9/11 took place before Greengrass started filming his tribute to the brave souls aboard United 93.  The horrific events were not only still fresh in the minds of the American public but the subject was sore indeed.  Greengrass was either going to succeed in bringing the American public together in their praise and admiration of his film or he was going to send them running from the theaters in aggravation and frustration and thus risked becoming the director labeled as the one who failed to do justice to such a grave subject.I think we can all agree that Greengrass succeeded marvelously here.`United 93' is a beautifully honest rendering of the tragic day known as 9/11.  Taking an honest look into not only the lives of the `victims' aboard the plane but also the hijackers and the befuddled men and women on the ground, `United 93' is able to reach into the pit of its audiences soul and extract a real connection to the events taking place on the screen.The film opens with a calm and eerie depiction of the four men responsible for this tragedy preparing themselves for their `mission'.  It's the perfect way to open the film for it automatically lets us know who these men our.  What I appreciate about what Greengrass does here is that, instead of shooting for the obvious and making this film all about how `evil' and `sadistic' these hijackers were he goes for the more intellectual route by showing us how `human' they were.  They honestly thought they were doing gods will.  It doesn't excuse their horrific actions, and of course neither does this film, but Greengrass successfully creates human `villains' for us.As effective as the opening is, it's the ending that will really stay with you.  As much as we know how this story ends we find ourselves anticipating the passengers to `save the day' so-to-speak and so when the film abruptly ends we are left heartbroken all over again, as if we are hearing about these events for the first time.Another aspect of `United 93' that is so masterful is the way Greengrass is able to depict the sudden and effortless decline into confusion and frustration, especially when concerning the men and women still on the ground.  As we are led through the events unfolding before the air traffic controllers we are instantly placed in their shoes and this overwhelming feeling of panic and desperation is etched across our bodies.  We feel tense; we feel scared; we feel alone.  By capturing this feeling Greengrass is able to keep the intensity high throughout the entire film, never losing the mood of the film.The performances by the cast of unknowns are fantastic; utterly flawless.  By casting real life airline employees he was able to capture a true human nature to the reactions of the crew as well as the passengers.  Also, but casting no-name actors he was able to capture the raw realism of the events.  There are no recognizable faces here so there is no way we can be taken out of the film so-to-speak.  This way we are always thinking about the people being portrayed and not the actor doing the portraying.I think when speaking of the acting one must point out the brilliance of the four actors portraying the hijackers.  Khalid Abdalla, Lewis Alsamari, Omar Berdouni and Jamie Harding all attacked these roles with fearlessness and confidence.  It was a brave thing, taking on the roles of men who are so loathed, feared and detested in America, but the manage to make these men real and human and thus utterly blew me away.  Ben Sliney has also received a lot of attention and praise for his performance (he played himself).  I must also mention him and his masterful performance; truly grounded and natural.In the end though, this film belongs to Paul Greengrass.

644106,A2IIC3NBR966LL,B00005JOZI,antaylor,"[7, 7]","I have to say that this film has far exceeded my expectations. The docudrama style is thankfully unsensational and believable. It was absolutely the correct direction to take and Paul Greengrass should and has been saluted for that. It would have seemed disrespectful in the extreme to have made this into some sort of bombastic, jingoistic popcorn fodder but what we are presented with here is a muted, mature, faithful legacy to those on board that doomed flight. I find it unbelievable reading comments saying the film is boring because this is about showing us the reality as far as we know it of what happened, about being a tribute to those who refused to be victims and whose spirit to fight back took over and about posing the difficult questions as to how this was able to happen. I'm sure entertainment never entered into it.Besides, I was on an emotional rollercoaster from the very start. Watching the mundane actions of the flight crew and passengers as they board and prepare for take off unaware of what lies ahead, watching the confusion and chaos in the control rooms, seeing the nervous shiftiness of the four unassuming hijackers, hearing the verbatim final messages to loved ones and the overwhelming final mutiny were all so gripping, tense and moving. Scenes throughout were so well executed with the editing deserving special mention, especially the frantic scenes on the ground between the military command room, control centres and airport towers, you get a real sense of the chaos and the bewilderment as reality dawns on those watching it all unfold.Another wise decision Greengrass took was to only make a nod to the other three hijacked flights, rather than attempt to recreate any scenes on board those planes. We only hear about them as an off trajectory flight number or see them as a moving dot on a control screen. When there is suddenly no response from that flight or worse, it simply disappears from the control screen, we can only imagine what the situation is like aboard that plane. We know what has happened and there is no need for confirmation.There is so much more that can be said but other reviews have already sung such praises. That the film won such favour with the relatives of those on board gives the film another level of added worth. It was nice to hear some of them talk about the film as being a cathartic experience and that they felt a little peace afterwards. That's a real testament to United 93's noble intentions and perfect execution. It is a terrific piece of cinema.",5,Terrific filmmaking,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2531,"['have', 'say', 'film', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'docudrama', 'style', 'thankfully', 'unsensational', 'believable', 'was', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'direction', 'take', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'should', 'been', 'saluted', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'disrespectful', 'extreme', 'have', 'made', 'sort', 'bombastic', 'jingoistic', 'popcorn', 'fodder', 'what', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'muted', 'mature', 'faithful', 'legacy', 'board', 'doomed', 'flight', 'find', 'unbelievable', 'reading', 'comments', 'saying', 'film', 'boring', 'showing', 'reality', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'being', 'tribute', 'who', 'refused', 'be', 'victims', 'spirit', 'fight', 'back', 'took', 'posing', 'difficult', 'questions', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'happen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'entertainment', 'never', 'entered', 'it.Besides', 'was', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'very', 'start', 'Watching', 'mundane', 'actions', 'flight', 'crew', 'passengers', 'board', 'prepare', 'take', 'off', 'unaware', 'what', 'ahead', 'watching', 'confusion', 'chaos', 'control', 'rooms', 'seeing', 'nervous', 'shiftiness', 'four', 'unassuming', 'hijackers', 'hearing', 'verbatim', 'final', 'messages', 'loved', 'ones', 'overwhelming', 'final', 'mutiny', 'were', 'so', 'gripping', 'tense', 'moving', 'Scenes', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'editing', 'deserving', 'special', 'mention', 'especially', 'frantic', 'scenes', 'ground', 'military', 'command', 'room', 'control', 'centres', 'airport', 'towers', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'chaos', 'bewilderment', 'reality', 'dawns', 'watching', 'unfold.Another', 'wise', 'decision', 'Greengrass', 'took', 'was', 'only', 'make', 'nod', 'other', 'three', 'hijacked', 'flights', 'rather', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'scenes', 'board', 'planes', 'only', 'hear', 'about', 'trajectory', 'flight', 'number', 'see', 'moving', 'dot', 'control', 'screen', 'When', 'suddenly', 'response', 'flight', 'worse', 'simply', 'control', 'screen', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'situation', 'plane', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'need', 'confirmation.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'sung', 'such', 'praises', 'film', 'won', 'such', 'favour', 'relatives', 'board', 'film', 'level', 'added', 'worth', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'talk', 'film', 'being', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'felt', 'little', 'peace', 'afterwards', 'real', 'testament', 'United', '93', 'noble', 'intentions', 'perfect', 'execution', 'terrific', 'piece', 'cinema']",United 93

The radio in the cab was on and the driver told me: ""You know, they say an airliner rammed into one of the twin towers in New York"". My first thought was: ""How is that possible? You can't hit a skyscraper with an airplane, they don't fly that low over NYC. Even in case of emergency they'd rather make it into Hudson river"" - as one of the characters of United 93 says. Some time later while I was still in the taxi we heard about the second plane that hit the southern tower. Right off I understood it's a terrorist attack, but still I had this feeling of irreality about what was going on. Even when I got home, turned on the TV and saw both WTC buildings on fire, I couldn't believe my own eyes. ""That's impossible - I thought - that just can't be. It only happens in movies"". 9/11 was the day everyone understood such things might happen in real life also. It was the first day that sent previous era to past - era of world's relative serenity and carelessness. From that day on we all suspect our telephone calls are being eavesdropped, we have to take off our shoes in airports, and some of us are even being bombed.This total tranquility is conveyed great in the beginning of United 93. The last calm hours or even minutes before the world changed are shown so objectively and impartially as if the filmmakers don't know themselves what's going to happen. And this lull is so frightening from today's perspective. Paul Greengrass made a great film which looks almost as a documentary and which derives much of its power from this fact. This is not a heroic, epic tale of survival and struggle, it's a quiet story about ordinary people who once woke up in hell and just like us refused to believe it all was true. But they had to fight to stay alive and these common people who were on the United 93 - managers, secretaries, sportsmen or whoever else were there - fought to stop this madness. Paul Greengrass took a viewer 5 years back and let him observe everything not from his armchair in front of the TV, but to actually BE there and to experience all the terror and anguish himself. And he succeeded indeed. There are no well-known actors in United 93 so that we can feel all the characters are real people just like us, one of the few familiar faces here is David Rasche, and we catch at him like people on the plane were grasping at him as at a straw because he (as a pilot) was their only hope to survive this nightmare. But although we hope till the very last minute that passangers will manage to win this fight, we are thrown into despair even deeper realizing we already know the outcome.United 93 is an utterly powerful and impressive picture. Probably the best way to pay the tribute to all the people who lost their lives on 9/11. And Paul Greengrass, being a good director, understood he didn't need a blockbuster with Bruce Willis to do that. He just needed a small, modest movie that almost like a documentary showed us real people in extraordinary circumstances and made us feel at least a grain of what they must have felt that day. This movie is recommended to everyone with no exceptions for it's one of the most potent pictures you'll ever see.",5,POWERFUL SMALL FILM,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3280,"['September', '11th', '2001', 'about', '5PM', 'Moscow', 'time', '9AM', 'NYC', 'took', 'taxi', 'go', 'home', 'radio', 'cab', 'was', 'driver', 'told', 'know', 'say', 'airliner', 'rammed', 'one', 'twin', 'towers', 'New', 'York', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'How', 'possible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'skyscraper', 'airplane', 'do', ""n't"", 'fly', 'that', 'low', 'NYC', 'Even', 'case', 'emergency', ""'d"", 'rather', 'make', 'Hudson', 'river', 'one', 'characters', 'United', '93', 'time', 'later', 'was', 'still', 'taxi', 'heard', 'second', 'plane', 'hit', 'southern', 'tower', 'Right', 'understood', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'still', 'had', 'feeling', 'irreality', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Even', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'turned', 'TV', 'saw', 'WTC', 'buildings', 'fire', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'own', 'eyes', 'impossible', 'thought', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'movies', '9/11', 'was', 'day', 'everyone', 'understood', 'such', 'things', 'might', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'was', 'first', 'day', 'sent', 'previous', 'era', 'past', 'era', 'world', 'relative', 'serenity', 'carelessness', 'day', 'suspect', 'telephone', 'calls', 'are', 'being', 'eavesdropped', 'have', 'take', 'off', 'shoes', 'airports', 'are', 'even', 'being', 'bombed.This', 'total', 'tranquility', 'conveyed', 'great', 'beginning', 'United', '93', 'last', 'calm', 'hours', 'even', 'minutes', 'world', 'changed', 'are', 'shown', 'so', 'objectively', 'impartially', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'lull', 'so', 'frightening', 'today', 'perspective', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary', 'much', 'power', 'fact', 'not', 'heroic', 'epic', 'tale', 'survival', 'struggle', 'quiet', 'story', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'once', 'woke', 'up', 'hell', 'just', 'refused', 'believe', 'was', 'true', 'had', 'fight', 'stay', 'alive', 'common', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'United', '93', 'managers', 'secretaries', 'sportsmen', 'whoever', 'else', 'were', 'fought', 'stop', 'madness', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'took', 'viewer', '5', 'years', 'back', 'let', 'observe', 'everything', 'not', 'armchair', 'front', 'TV', 'actually', 'BE', 'there', 'experience', 'terror', 'anguish', 'succeeded', 'indeed', 'are', 'well-known', 'actors', 'United', '93', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'just', 'one', 'few', 'familiar', 'here', 'David', 'Rasche', 'catch', 'like', 'people', 'plane', 'were', 'grasping', 'as', 'straw', 'pilot', 'was', 'only', 'hope', 'survive', 'nightmare', 'hope', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'passangers', 'will', 'manage', 'win', 'fight', 'are', 'thrown', 'despair', 'even', 'deeper', 'realizing', 'already', 'know', 'outcome.United', '93', 'utterly', 'powerful', 'impressive', 'picture', 'Probably', 'best', 'way', 'pay', 'tribute', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', '9/11', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'being', 'good', 'director', 'understood', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'blockbuster', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'do', 'just', 'needed', 'small', 'modest', 'movie', 'almost', 'documentary', 'showed', 'real', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'made', 'feel', 'least', 'grain', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'day', 'movie', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'exceptions', 'one', 'most', 'potent', 'pictures', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see']",United 93

The usual movies I end up seeing are fluffy love stories with happy endings (unless a really excellent horror movie is on) so it was interesting and yet disturbing to see a real life situation reinacted in front of our eyes. The bad parts first: The movie has far too many scenes of the flight control centre which drains the emotional connection of what this movie is really about. They lack empathy and sadness and maintain too much of their professionalism when they learn of the planes, but make extra speedy runarounds trying to locate all the other planes in the sky. You don't really get to know the characters. They are all merely passengers you'd see on an everyday flight (which I'm sure they were) but it looks like no research really went into their personalities. Far too many useless conversations with no meaning up until the point of when the plane is about to crash and everyone is telling their families how much they love them. The footage of the World Trade Centres with smoke all around only shows the actual buildings and not the people around. There were many below who were devastated, scared, confused... why are they not shown?The good points? Incredible acting. Yes, the actors and actresses are very convincing. My heart was thudding all the way through from when the terrorists were sitting in their assigned seats to when they started stabbing passengers and threatening to blow up the plane. This movie actually made me cry (which is rare), the end music of the children singing added to the impact of how devastating, frightening and above all saddening the plot and how each one of us felt whilst watching. Definately a movie to see if you can handle the truth about 9/11.On a complete random note, one of the terrorists looks much like Pete Wentz from the band 'Fall Out Boy'.

His choices throughout the film are exceptionally astute and the film is gripping, terrifying and sad.  There is a feeling of numbing dread in the early scenes of the passengers boarding the flight alongside the hijackers that is excruciating.  Normal people, going about their lives, unaware of the terror we know is about to befall them.As I said, I applaud the choices the film-makers have made, and this is a fine film that should be seen by many.  I found it stunning.I likewise find stunning several of the jaw-dropping one star reviews I have just read here, motivated by and pumped full of their ridiculous and absurd conspiracy theories.

644110,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B00005JOZI,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[5, 5]","United 93 is easily one of the ten best films of 2006.  Although it received no Oscar at the 79th Academy Award Ceremony three days ago, it is still even a better film than the year's Oscar winner The Departed in categories of Best Picture and Best Editing--where United 93 really succeeds the most.I've asked several people if they had seen the film, but I always get a no.  Well, people don't know what they're missing.  They see the cover of this box and are reminded of their responsibility to the 9/11 events.  They don't want to talk about the 9/11 horrors because it makes them think about stuff.The people who refuse to watch the movie don't get it; it's got nothing to do with the film.  It doesn't go preaching on morality or anything of the kind.  It is simply THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL FILM PRODUCTION OF 2006.If one is interested in anything, he would be interested in just peering through this window to see how air traffic control operates.  It's as realistic as film gets!  It shows what air traffic control looks like on a day-to-day affair.  Then, things start going wrong, but no matter how wrong things get, the film suspense is heightened not by cheap thrills, but by the characters' need to act immediately because other planes flying around the country still have to be directed.  After Control verifies multiple planes are hijacked, we see an air traffic controller manager tell his controllers to ground all airplanes, no exceptions.  This helps to lighten the burden of dealing with renegade and out-of-contact, hijacked aircraft.The film has three points of view.  It has the perspective of the civilian air traffic controllers, the perspective of the military air traffic controllers, and the perspective of the people on flight United 93 of both the hijackers and the innocent occupants.  None of this film is influenced by any kind of politics!  It's purely interested in the human element of those three points of view, and in how they interrelate.  There are no politics in this film.  It's completely devoid of politics!  It's a suspense film about the details of those three points of view on that day.  It's an action film because its suspense works and follows through.  It's not brainless, I promise.  When flight United 93 goes down in the film, it is so emotional, it moves one to tears.  It's because of the heroism of the civilians rebelling against the hijacking.  The people on flight United 93 saved the day with their heroism, and this film is about that heroism.  It's got nothing to do with politics.

No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors.  And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful.For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood trash, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.  I won't say this film is for everyone.  It IS hard to watch at times.  I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful, respectful manner, and many of the families affected on 9/11 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise?

644113,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00005JOZI,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","United Airways Flight 93 was a civil aircraft making a regular passenger run from Newark Airport, New York City, to San Francisco on the morning of 11 September 2001. Members of the terrorist organisation al-Qaeda seized control of four aircraft that morning, including United 93. The other three aircraft were crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The hijackers of United 93 were planning to crash their aircraft into the Capitol Building in Washington, but the plane was delayed for half an hour due to an overbooked departure window. By the time the aircraft was drawing close to Washington, news of the attacks on New York and Washington had reached the passengers on United 93. Realising that their aircraft was also going to be used as a weapon, the passengers and crew resolved to storm the cockpit and retake control of the aircraft.United 93 is one of several films based on the events of 9/11, but is the one that is based most closely on the real events of that day. The script was assembled with close attention paid to the findings of the 9/11 Commission and countless interviews with people involved in the events of the day in air traffic control centres, airport towers and in the military. In fact, during the pre-production phase director Paul Greengrass made the decision to employ a large number of these consultants in the film as actors, playing themselves. The most prominent is Ben Sliney, National Operations Manager at the Federal Aviation Administration centre in Virginia. Sliney is credited as the person who gave the unprecedented order to ground every aircraft in American airspace - over four thousand of them - in the aftermath of the attacks. The American military gave their full cooperation to the film, allowing active personnel to portray themselves. The military were caught off-guard by 9/11, which exposed significant weaknesses in the American air defence system (namely that the hijacking of aircraft was not considered a realistic threat and that only four fighter jets were available for the defence of the entire Eastern Seaboard), but they allowed these problems to be shown in the film to convey the sheer unprecedented nature of the attacks.As part of the quest for authenticity, all forty-four of the actors portraying the hijackers, passengers and crew were picked to match the real passengers as closely as possible. Many of them spent time with the families of the passengers they were portraying in an attempt to get as close as possible to their subjects. The result is a documentary-like feel to the events of the film, in stark contrast to the rather mawkish over-dramatic feel of the several other TV movies and 'docu-dramas' based on the events of the day. Performances are universally flawless, and the fact that so many of the performers in the military command post and the air traffic control centres are not professional actors is a real surprise.Structurally, the film condenses some events at the beginning of the movie in order to fit the whole story in the running time. However, from the moment Flight 93 takes off, the movie switches to real-time. Greengrass is a superb director, as seen in his previous movies, and here paces events to perfection with the growing chaos of the situation and the increasingly futile attempts by the authorities to stay on top of it vividly depicted. The moment Sliney takes charge and shuts down American airspace is notable as it's the point at which control over the situation is, to some extent at least, regained. This is also significant as Greengrass cuts away from events on the ground at that point and the rest of the movie unfolds entirely within the aircraft.Obviously, vast numbers of people watching this film will have vivid memories of 9/11 themselves, and each viewer will watch the film partially through the lens of their own experiences and feelings from that day. For this reason, Greengrass tries not to offer any kind of political or ideological commentary on events, as this would invariably skew the film and lose some of its impact. Events unfold starkly and with no attempt to interpret them. On the commentary Greengrass points out that the hijackers were devout Muslims and shows them praying before and during the hijacking, and reveals he wanted to convey a thematic idea that the terrorists were hijacking the religion to excuse their actions as well as literally hijacking the aircraft, but this idea can't come across very well in the film due to the stripping back of any kind of artistic elements in favour of the simple depiction of events. Similarly, the extraordinarily long delays in the military getting authorisation to shoot down hijacked aircraft and the collapse of many of the emergency procedures in place amongst the air controllers also passes without any kind of comment in the film. These things happened. Why they happened was up to the various post-9/11 committees and investigations to discover, and these events were outside the scope of the film, although references to the extreme length of time since the last hijacking over US airspace do convey somewhat that there were relatively few procedures in place to deal with the crisis, and none at all for the use of aircraft as suicide weapons.Given the film's excellent direction and acting, not to mention its powerful impact and intensity, I strongly considered giving it the 'classic' appreciation. However, I chose not to due to several problems that would be considered minor in other films, but in one based so closely on real events could not pass unnoticed. The most notable is the extremely questionable decision to depict German passenger Christian Adams as an 'appeaser' who urgently counsels against the decision to storm the cockpit and at one point freaks out when all of the other passengers are shown as resolute or upset, but not actually having a breakdown. Given that there is no evidence that the real Adams did any of these things, Greengrass' decision to depict him as doing them is rather unfair and possibly damaging (a somewhat similar dubious decision to the depiction of William Murdoch, the first officer of the Titanic shown gunning down panicking passengers in the Cameron movie when in fact he did no such thing). The other problem is one outside of the film producers' control. At the time of shooting the cockpit voice recordings from the plane had not been publicly released, and there were no signs they were going to be. The recordings actually were released before the movie came out, revealing that several key events in the film are erroneous (the most notable being that the passengers failed to gain access to the cockpit at all). Both of these problems would be to some extent excusable in a full work of fiction, but given the movie's extreme fidelity to the truth elsewhere, they introduce elements of doubt and misdirection to the narrative which are regrettable.Despite these issues, United 93 (****) is a powerful and affecting film. It is not easy viewing but it is certainly worth watching to get a good sense of the chaos and confusion of that day as people struggled to react to the unthinkable. The movie is available now on DVD (UK, USA).",4,"A powerful and effective movie, marred by some minor issues",1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,7265,"['United', 'Airways', 'Flight', '93', 'was', 'civil',

When 9/11 happened, I was just as stunned, fearful, and outraged as most of my fellow countrymen, I'm sure. And watching a film related to those events only a few short years after that dreadful day, I could feel those same emotions smoldering within me. Trying to objectively rate this film based solely on its merits becomes a bit sticky, simply because that emotional scar is still so fresh. But I'll do my best.The greatest thing about UNITED 93 is that it's filmed using hand-held cameras, giving the viewer an intimate sense that they are an active party within the movie. This is most effective when we're on the plane (for reasons stated earlier) and get to witness all of the passengers' interactions with each other and the hijackers. The other excellent part is that there isn't one star that we follow, nor are there any big name actors/actresses in the film. Every person is just as important as the next. I applaud director Greengrass' script interpretation and this seldom used method of filming.Another admirable item is that the film shows us how off-guard the FAA and the military was immediately following the hijackings. As the movie moves between the FAA headquarters and the military's interactions with these public offices, we get to witness the incredible chaos that ensued and feel the frustrations as they try to figure out which planes are risks, what to do about them, who has the authority to shoot them down (if need be), and the unavailability of President Bush.The big issues with the movie will obviously be very personal. Each individual will probably feel differently about it. Mine were of manipulation. Since this is still a fresh memory in the minds of most Americans (including my own), I felt as though the film makers were trying to feed off of those memories. This isn't as horrible as it sounds, though. Some of the best films play with our feelings. The risk here, however, is what we do with them. Do we continue to fear? Or hate? Or do we learn from these experiences and move ahead? This film won't give you the answers to those questions, which is both a strength and one hell of a flaw. But it is a well put together piece of cinema.",4,Good Flick But Plays On Recent Emotions,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2333,"['could', 'be', 'toughest', 'review', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'written', 'Being', 'born-and-bred', 'American', 'have', 'few', 'protective', 'sensibilities', 'regarding', 'home', 'country', 'When', '9/11', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'stunned', 'fearful', 'outraged', 'most', 'fellow', 'countrymen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watching', 'film', 'related', 'events', 'only', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'dreadful', 'day', 'could', 'feel', 'same', 'emotions', 'smoldering', 'Trying', 'objectively', 'rate', 'film', 'based', 'solely', 'merits', 'bit', 'sticky', 'simply', 'emotional', 'scar', 'still', 'so', 'fresh', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best.The', 'greatest', 'thing', 'UNITED', '93', 'filmed', 'using', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'giving', 'viewer', 'intimate', 'sense', 'are', 'active', 'party', 'movie', 'most', 'effective', 'when', ""'re"", 'plane', 'reasons', 'stated', 'earlier', 'get', 'witness', 'passengers', 'interactions', 'other', 'hijackers', 'other', 'excellent', 'part', ""n't"", 'one', 'star', 'follow', 'are', 'there', 'big', 'name', 'film', 'person', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'next', 'applaud', 'director', 'Greengrass', 'script', 'interpretation', 'seldom', 'used', 'method', 'filming.Another', 'admirable', 'item', 'film', 'how', 'off-guard', 'FAA', 'military', 'was', 'immediately', 'following', 'hijackings', 'movie', 'FAA', 'headquarters', 'military', 'interactions', 'public', 'offices', 'get', 'witness', 'incredible', 'chaos', 'ensued', 'feel', 'frustrations', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'planes', 'are', 'risks', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'authority', 'shoot', 'down', 'need', 'be', 'unavailability', 'President', 'Bush.The', 'big', 'issues', 'movie', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'very', 'personal', 'individual', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'differently', 'Mine', 'were', 'manipulation', 'still', 'fresh', 'memory', 'minds', 'most', 'Americans', 'including', 'own', 'felt', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'feed', 'memories', ""n't"", 'as', 'horrible', 'though', 'best', 'films', 'play', 'feelings', 'risk', 'here', 'however', 'what', 'do', 'Do', 'continue', 'fear', 'hate', 'do', 'learn', 'experiences', 'move', 'ahead', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'questions', 'strength', 'one', 'hell', 'flaw', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'piece', 'cinema']",United 93

I can understand that, but why in the world would you watch a movie whose subject matter is not in question?Second, to those who believe in the ""Loose-Change"" nonsense.  The LC folks can't even get their own stories straight.  In LC1, they said United 93 was shot down, then in LC2, they said the flight never crashed in PA.  Ooooookkkkk.This film is so well researched and so well shot that it borders on a documentary.  Obviously the one thing missing are the actual conversations and final details of what happened on Flight 93 as it went into the ground.After I watched the movie, I rewatched it the next day with the Audio commentary from Paul Greengrass.  Only then did I realize that many of the military and FAA players were actual FAA officials and/or air traffic controllers/military.  Some were the actual people on duty at the time.  This gives this film many steps above any others that attempt to dramatize 9/11.There is no fluff.  No side stories.  No judgement.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[3, 3]","UNITED 93 should win some Oscars, if there is any justice in the world, because this film is a great way to learn about the horrific events that took place on this doomed flight on 9/11! It is very gritty and realistic, and very informative.The film is shot in a unique way, different from standard movie storytelling. It is as if the camera is sitting or standing next to the people onscreen, and it makes it seem as if you are there, witnessing the events for yourself, with no external narration to tell you what to think or make of what you are seeing (except for what each audience member recalls from the day themselves). They shot as much as they could on location, and used as many non-actors as they could, to make it look like average, real people, not polished movie actors.UNITED 93 is rated R but it is relatively non-graphic in its violence, compared to most action or other rated R films. There are brief moments of blood and violence in UNITED 93, but they never overdo it, and just show enough to give the viewer the realistic reality of the events, never using violence gratuitously.The result is similar to what I, myself, felt on 9/11, lots of confusion and fear, multiplied a great deal by showing us actual events from the infamous day of terrorism, more than just what my day was like on 9/11, following news broadcasts only. This film follows the perpetrators, victims, and heroes of this flight, the only hijacked airplane where the average passengers would be able to fight back in time to a least save victims at the intended target site. They were able to prevent the suicidal terrorists from reaching their intended target!The director commentary is very informative, and you should watch it with that turned on, at least once. The director talks about how this film is based upon the findings of the 9/11 commission report, and points out scenes which are verbatim to the known evidence, and other scenes which are very likely to have happened that way, but nobody knows for sure.There is also a long bonus feature showing the unknown actors visiting the real life families of the 9/11 passengers of United 93, whom each actor would be portraying.There is a lesser known DVD movie about this same topic called FLIGHT 93. Actually, I think that one is slightly better, and slightly more like a conventional movie, but only slightly. The other DVD, FLIGHT 93 does a better job of conveying the terrifying, gut-wrenching, rollercoaster ride that the hijackers took the passengers on, by showing the jet from the outside; and it also has slightly stronger focuses on individual passengers and the people they were in contact with on the ground. The other movie, FLIGHT 93 also has a few scenes concerning details from after the crash, which are very informative and not shown in UNITED 93, which ends with the crash.If I had to pick just one, I would go with FLIGHT 93, but since UNITED 93 is the one being considered for Oscar Award contention, so be it, I can agree that UNITED 93 deserves all the recognition that it most certainly does deserve!",5,Academy Award Oscar-Worthy Film!

I believe that its important to know their names, where they came from, and who they were because we all need to know the loss in order to make sure it doesn't happen again, and their legacies live on in our perseverance. I thought it was time, 5 years after, to begin showing what happened either in TV or in films. The story of Flight 93, the plane that crashed in Shanksville Pennsylvania presumably on its way to hit the White House, is riveting because of the details of both its passengers and crew and the detective work it took to piece together all those details. The planes that hit the world trade centers and the pentagon gave us few glimpses as to what transpired onboard, we have very few first hand accounts to see into their last moments. There were two projects based on that day, this movie ""United 93"" put out by Universal and a TV movie called ""Flight 93"" which came on A&E 3 months before the theatrical release. I have watched both, and I prefer the A&E version over this one, now this one is well done and is visually stunning and hits you where it should, BUT the TV version in my opinion has the greatest impact emotionally, physically. United 93, tells more of the technical side, what was happening on the ground at the military and aviation centers, It does not go into the passengers and their personal struggles and their families heartache. On Flight 93 we see everything the technical, the military, the passengers, the hijackers, the families. Watching the people call their families, which is taken directly from records and interviews, broke my heart in two. Knowing these heroes through this glimpse into their final goodbyes, and seeing them rise up to confront the terrorists inspired me like no other movie ever has. United 93 didn't quite live up to that, I felt like they didn't show who these people were and what they were leaving behind.

""United 93"" focuses more on what happened behind the scenes with air traffic control and the military's frustration over the rules of engagement during the crisis. The History Channel movie focuses on what happened on the plane with the hijackers and passengers. From what I have read, the television version is amazingly accurate in dialogue and sequence of events.Personally, I much prefer the History Channel version, which I realize may cost me some votes, but I really don't care. Yes, it is a ""milder"" version, but the acting is superb and I like the fact that the dialogue is pretty exact, based on research, extensive interviews and public records. United 93, by comparison, is incredibly good and moves at a faster clip (the action part anyway, the dialogue, as I will address later, is incredibly slow), but its focus, as I mentioned before, is on the more technical end -we learn quite a bit more about what the air traffic controllers and miltary personnel went through. The scenes on the plane are brief and at times choppy.I guess it all boils down to a matter of preference. If you would prefer to learn more about what happened on the plane during this tragedy, buy ""Flight 93"". If however you want a precise technical viewpoint from the ground, then ""United 93"" is your movie.

If you're like me, you may be very hesitant to see it at first,  thinking that this is an inhuman attempt to cash in on a tragedy.  However, after visiting the web site for the film, you'll see that this film was made with the full support of the families.  As for Paul Greengrass, the film's director, the interviews with him about this film are telling.  It's very clear that he handled this project seriously and with extreme care.What's truly great about this film is that it painstakingly re-creates the tragedy of that day without getting political.  The story itself focuses, like a laser beam, upon ordinary people: passengers, flight attendants, air traffic controllors, etc.  Politicians (of all political parties) are simply absent from this portion of 9/11.This film is not about politics- it's about those brave souls who were closest to this worst day in American history.There's no agenda here. It simply tells what happens, and in so doing, forces us to reflect upon certain questions.  Are we any safer today?  How can we really know for sure?  Will there be a day in America's future that will be worse than this?  The plane was highjacked by Al-Queada operatives, and there are Al-Queada in Iraq right now where we fight.  So is the war in Iraq justified?These  are the questions that will haunt you after this film is over.  Seeing young men who are willing to commit suicide for what they believe in, and ordinary Americans willing to stop them,  raises questions about American resolve.  Is America made of the same stuff that the heroes of United 93 were made of?

It's unconventional storytelling method is quite simply, REALISM. The documentary feel. Many of the air traffic controllers and FFA tower operators played themselves, really lending to the realism of the film. The actors didn't play like actors... they are real. They do their jobs and their roles so capably, you don't think you're watching a film. You are watching the real events.Finally, UNITED 93 will pose questions. Like any great film should. Why were the heads of the FAA and the military so slow to react? Why did they doubt when they were told what was going on by a air traffic controller? Why wasn't the government brought into the loop sooner? and finally, how can Muslim men be so brainwashed, that they could believe that GOD, could condone and ask them to MURDER thousands of people who are peaceful, going to work and of many different races (many fellow Muslims) and countries.They have obviously never been to New York City to see how EVERY race, religion, creed and sex is welcomed and has been thriving peacefully for years... together.UNITED 93 is not to be missed.",5,BEST FILM OF THE YEAR,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,2006,"['Why', 'do', 'think', 'so', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Spielberg', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'what', 'have', 'incredible', 'attention', 'detail', 'realism', 'will', 'have', 'riveted', 'beginning', 'end.Each', 'frame', 'film', 'captures', 'heart-breaking', 'moments', 'passengers', 'unknowningly', 'board', 'UNITED', '93', 'not', 'would', 'occasion', 'hectic', 'job', 'air', 'traffic', 'controller', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'red', 'tape', 'numerous', 'hoops', 'people', 'had', 'jump', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'being', 'too', 'late', 'insanity', 'drove', 'CULTISH', 'Muslim', 'murder', 'thousands', 'day', 'name', 'GOD', 'ultimately', 'passengers', '93', 'realized', 'fate', 'did', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'fight', '93', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'question', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'nominee', '2006', 'Oscar', 'best', 'picture.The', 'genius', 'UNITED', '93', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'movie', 'unconventional', 'storytelling', 'method', 'quite', 'simply', 'REALISM', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Many', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'FFA', 'tower', 'operators', 'played', 'really', 'lending', 'realism', 'film', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'actors', 'are', 'real', 'do', 'jobs', 'roles', 'so', 'capably', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'events.Finally', 'UNITED', '93', 'will', 'pose', 'questions', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'Why', 'were', 'heads', 'FAA', 'military', 'so', 'slow', 'react', 'Why', 'did', 'doubt', 'when', 'were', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'air', 'traffic', 'controller', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'government', 'brought', 'loop', 'sooner', 'finally', 'how', 'can', 'Muslim', 'men', 'be', 'so', 'brainwashed', 'could', 'believe', 'GOD', 'could', 'condone', 'ask', 'MURDER', 'thousands', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'peaceful', 'going', 'work', 'many', 'different', 'races', 'many', 'fellow', 'Muslims', 'have', 'obviously', 'never', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'see', 'how', 'EVERY', 'race', 'religion', 'creed', 'sex', 'welcomed', 'been', 'thriving', 'peacefully', 'years', 'together.UNITED', '93', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",United 93
644129,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JOZI,Chris Pandolfi,"[24, 27]","It's difficult to be objective about a film like ""United 93,"" considering it's the first film to present an account of the tragedy that was September 11, 2001. I remember seeing the first teaser trailer for it at the end of 2005 (back when it was called ""Flight 93"") and immediately thinking about how the public would react to it. One of the greatest public concerns was that, because it was made only six years after the attacks, emotions would still be too raw to allow anyone to focus on anything other than the pain and frustration. I have to admit that I was one of those people; why would anyone want to capitalize on a national catastrophe so soon afterwards? But then the film was released, and I listened to a lot of the reviews, which have certainly been more than favorable. And rightly so. This is not just a movie; it's a horrific reminder of the sorrow that befell America that dark September morning, and in my opinion, it should be required viewing for all of humanity.When it comes to a film like this, it's not a matter of liking it or of finding it entertaining. If it were made with those goals in mind, it would be one of the most offensive, insulting things to ever smear itself on the silver screen. What does matter is whether or not it's an important movie, made to present the facts in an appropriate and informative way. ""United 93"" definitely delivers in that regard. Nothing is extraneous or melodramatic; it's almost like a documentary in that it's an accurate unfolding of moments that most people have not had the chance to learn about. On top of that, it's so touching that it absolutely guarantees some kind of reaction (loud, soft, or silent). I say this in regard to everyone, not just to the victims' family and friends. Unless you have ice water in your veins, you'll find this to be profoundly moving, especially when the passengers make their last phone calls.Paul Greengrass took the awesome responsibility of writing and directing this film, no small task considering the potential repercussions from the American public. He went as far as to personally appeal to the family members of the ill-fated United 93 passengers, something that took a great deal of courage and determination on his part. I can't say if they all agreed to this film being made, but apparently enough of a consensus was reached. They must have known that he wouldn't make something that exploited their loved ones' deaths; rather, he would respectfully present their final moments in honest, straightforward terms. He opted to not focus on the background stories of the passengers or hijackers (the latter of which I couldn't help but feel sorry for; they were brainwashed to believe that murdering innocent people was the only solution). The best we're given are little snippets of overheard conversations, ones that seem completely unscripted and make use of everyday language. Nothing anyone says in this film seems contrived, and for that we have more than Greengrass to thank; we also have to thank the actors for their realistic portrayals.The air traffic controllers eventually have to figure out exactly what's going on in the skies above; every moment of those scenes is hectic, emotional, and filled with frustration. Things only get worse when the military gets involved, especially since a lot of the information they receive is chaotic and conflicting. When the first plane crashes into the World Trade Center, they scramble like mad to determine whether or not it was American Airlines flight 11, and by the end of the film they still don't know for sure (some reports said that it was still in the air despite disappearing from the radar screen). By the time military action is decided on, another host of problems occur, not the least of which were the unequipped fighter jets and the inability to get hold of the President. They were thoroughly authentic scenes, made even better by the fact that many of the air traffic controllers working that day were cast to play themselves.I don't think it matters anymore if ""United 93"" was released too soon. Even before its release, some cities were forced to pull the trailer from theaters because it was still enough of a reminder. Now that it has been released, many in all likelihood will come away feeling angry, bitter, and remorseful. Of course this movie is a downer, but it's an important downer, bringing to light the story of the airplane passengers who tried but ultimately failed to take control of their hijacked flight on September 11, 2001. Everything from the casting of unknown actors to the editing all came together beautifully, and the end result is something truly powerful. It's good to know that the first movie about 9/11 was carefully and respectfully crafted. I honestly believe that years from now, people will remember this movie just as much as they remember that awful day in 2001, when so many lives were tragically cut short.",5,A Respectful Tribute to

Vries ""HRH""","[1, 2]","Because this is such a sensitive subject matter, and because all involved in the project stated that the story would be portrayed with dignity, one tends to scrutinize every scene for signs of melodrama and inaccuracies. I watched FLIGHT 93 first (a couple of months ago), and was VERY impressed with what they did and how events were portrayed in that A&E; movie. To tell you the truth, certain details were explained much BETTER in that movie than in this one.Just shows you a story can be told successfully in more than one way! But there were some moments in the TV-movie where I felt they veered very close to cheap sentimentality, especially when Titanic-esk panpipes could be heard on the soundtrack. UNITED 93 uses very little music, which I appreciated .I found UNITED 93 just as engrossing and ultimately more sad than FLIGHT 93. My only reference to a situation remotely like this was when we flew through a storm once and I remember how quiet it was. No one said a word and we all stared at each other with pale faces and wide eyes.I would recommend watching both movies (not on the same day!) as that will paint the full picture of what happened that terrible morning in 2001. Also, the extras on the UNITED 93 dvd are great, with insightful commentary by Paul Greengrass and a very emotional documentary about the families meeting the castmembers. Not a dry eye in my house.

What unfolds (shockingly) is the chaos that went on behind the scenes on this day- not a wild chaos, just an utterly baffled and lost state of affairs. Left hands didn't know what right hands were doing. In point of fact, no one had a clue what to do or whom to turn to. The movie sentimentalizes nothing. Its depiction of the events aboard United 93 feels so real that you cannot help but identify and wonder what you would have done if you'd been a passenger.

644134,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JOZI,Craig MACKINNON,"[7, 8]","United 93 is one of the most harrowing movie experiences you're likely to have. This is because, of course, it is based on a real event and the viewer will know the outcome - everyone on the plane dies.  As such, there is no way to know how many of the events depicted on the screen are factual - did the passengers overcome 2 of the hijackers and force their way into the cockpit?  Was the plane headed for the Capitol? (personally, I think it more likely it was headed to the Pentagon, just as 2 planes headed to the WTC)  Was the leader really having second thoughts?  If not, why did the hijackers take so long to make their moves, especially since they were already delayed 30 minutes before takeoff?As the writer and the director, Paul Greengrass speculates on the answers to these questions and presents a logical sequence of events, interspersed with factually verifiable events such as the timing of the WTC hits and the air traffic controllers' conversations.  These scenes recreate the confusion of 9/11 extremely effectively because, as Greengrass points out in the Director's commentary (multiple times), the use of airliners as cruise missiles was simply an inconceivable event.Most difficult to watch, however, are the phone calls home from the passengers on the plane as they call to say good-bye.  Presumably these are the actual words spoken by the passengers, and that verity is extremely personal and difficult to watch.So, if the film is not factual, and does not even claim to be factual, what does it have going for it?  Basically, it feels True.  It never dramatizes the events, and often the dialogue feels ""overheard"" (even the famous ""Let's roll"").  The passengers are scared, but in their fear they realise (perhaps the first in the country) what's going on and choose to act.  We never learn anything about them - another correct step by Greengrass, whose goal appears to be putting the film viewer on the plane with the passengers.  They are strangers to us, they are strangers to each other, but they are all in it together and trust each.  Greengrass has been criticized for humanizing the hijackers.

644136,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JOZI,Cubist,"[13, 13]","On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were hijacked by teams of terrorists and used as missiles to strike twice in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane never reached its intended target and crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. United 93 dramatizes the events leading up to and speculates on what happened on this fourth plane before it lost control and crashed into the ground killing everyone on board.The inevitable question a film like United 93 raises is, it is still too soon for a film like this to be made? And if you do make a commercial film about 9/11 what kind of approach do you take that doesn't exploit such a sensitive event and do a disservice to the people who died tragically on that horrible day? What about the families of the people who died? How would they feel about a movie dramatizing what happened to their loved ones?And so it was with much trepidation when United 93 was announced but some of the concerns were put to rest when it was revealed that Paul Greengrass would be writing and directing the movie. He had previously directed the powerful Bloody Sunday, a gut-wrenching docudrama of the Derry massacre in Ireland on January 30, 1972. If anyone could keep true to the facts and not pander to sappy sentimentalism or flag-waving patriotism it would be Greengrass.What makes this film work so well is that it was made outside of the Hollywood studio system and this allowed Greengrass to cast unknown actors, character actors and even actual people who were witness to what happened that day. By doing this we aren't distracted from what is going on in the film like an easily identifiable movie star would. Another element that stands out is the use of hand-held cameras to give a sense of immediacy commonly associated with cinema verite. It also gives a documentary feel early on when we see the plane being boarded and all the work done to get it ready. It is this kind of attention to detail that gives United 93 a certain level of authenticity.United 93 is a film you don't watch, you endure. It is very upsetting to watch (as it should) but is an important movie nonetheless because it shows, with unflinching honesty, what might have happened on that plane based on phone conversations from passengers before they died. United 93 is an important film because we must not forget what happened on 9/11 and what these people went through and the sacrifices they made. This film is a fitting tribute to them.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul Greengrass. Greengrass has a tendency to speak slowly and ponderously but is very articulate when he explains his intentions for a given scene or talks about the events of that day. He gets a little pretentious at times but does speak knowledgably about the film.""United 93: The Families and the Film"" focuses on the families of the people who died on United Flight 93. Several of them are interviewed and talk about their thoughts on the movie and how they feel about their loved ones being depicted by actors. To that end, we see some of the cast meeting with the family members of the person they portrayed in the movie and it is obviously an emotional moment for all involved.""Memorial Pages"" provides brief biographical sketches and moving tributes to each flight crew member and passenger on United Flight 93. This is a great idea and a fitting tribute to these people, amply illustrating how each and every one of them were unique and memorable with their own distinctive lives.Finally, on the 2-disc Limited Edition, there is an additional extra - ""Chasing Planes - Witnesses to 9/11,"" a documentary about the men and women who tracked all the planes on that day and how they dealt with the crisis as it was unfolding. There are interviews with many of the air traffic controllers working that day some of whom played themselves in the movie.",5,A powerful experience and a fitting tribute,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,3889,"['September', '11', '2001', 'four', 'commercial', 'airplanes', 'were', 'hijacked', 'teams', 'terrorists', 'used', 'missiles', 'strike', 'twice', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Pentagon', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'fourth', 'plane', 'never', 'reached', 'intended', 'target', 'crashed', 'field', 'Pennsylvania', 'United', '93', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'speculates', 'happened', 'fourth', 'plane', 'lost', 'control', 'crashed', 'ground', 'killing', 'everyone', 'board.The', 'inevitable', 'question', 'film', 'United', '93', 'raises', 'still', 'too', 'soon', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'do', 'make', 'commercial', 'film', '9/11', 'what', 'kind', 'approach', 'do', 'take', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'such', 'sensitive', 'event', 'do', 'disservice', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', 'horrible', 'day', 'What', 'families', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'How', 'would', 'feel', 'movie', 'dramatizing', 'what', 'happened', 'loved', 'ones', 'was', 'much', 'trepidation', 'when', 'United', '93', 'was', 'announced', 'concerns', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'would', 'be', 'writing', 'directing', 'movie', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'powerful', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'gut-wrenching', 'docudrama', 'Derry', 'massacre', 'Ireland', 'January', '30', '1972', 'anyone', 'could', 'keep', 'true', 'facts', 'not', 'pander', 'sappy', 'sentimentalism', 'flag-waving', 'patriotism', 'would', 'be', 'Greengrass.What', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system', 'allowed', 'Greengrass', 'cast', 'unknown', 'actors', 'character', 'actors', 'even', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'witness', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'doing', 'are', ""n't"", 'distracted', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'movie', 'star', 'would', 'element', 'out', 'use', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'give', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'commonly', 'associated', 'cinema', 'verite', 'also', 'documentary', 'feel', 'early', 'when', 'see', 'plane', 'being', 'boarded', 'work', 'done', 'get', 'ready', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'United', '93', 'certain', 'level', 'authenticity.United', '93', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'endure', 'very', 'upsetting', 'watch', 'should', 'important', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'plane', 'based', 'phone', 'conversations', 'passengers', 'died', 'United', '93', 'important', 'film', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', '9/11', 'what', 'people', 'went', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'film', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Greengrass', 'tendency', 'speak', 'slowly', 'ponderously', 'very', 'articulate', 'when', 'intentions', 'given', 'scene', 'talks', 'events', 'day', 'little', 'pretentious', 'times', 'speak', 'knowledgably', 'film', 'United', '93', 'Families', 'Film', 'families', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'Several', 'are', 'interviewed', 'talk', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'how', 'feel', 'loved', 'ones', 'being', 'depicted', 'actors', 'end', 'see', 'cast', 'meeting', 'family', 'members', 'person', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'obviously', 'emotional', 'moment', 'involved', 'Memorial', 'Pages', 'brief', 'biographical', 'sketches', 'moving', 'tributes', 'flight', 'crew', 'member', 'passenger', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'great', 'idea', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'people', 'amply', 'illustrating', 'how', 'one', 'were', 'unique', 'memorable', 'own', 'distinctive', 'lives.Finally', '2-disc', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'additional', 'extra', 'Chasing', 'Planes', '9/11', 'documentary', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'tracked', 'planes', 'day', 'how', 'dealt', 'crisis', 'was', 'unfolding', 'are', 'interviews', 'many', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'working', 'day', 'whom', 'played', 'movie']",United 93

I was so unimpressed with WTC (aside from Maggie Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance) that I almost (and I stress almost) forfeited watching this film.  I'm so glad I rethought that idea.  This has to be one of the most touching and emotionally nerve racking movies I've seen in recent years and is such a triumph for movie making in general.  A lot of people were distressed since it has only been five years since the horrible events that circle this film, but when done as tastefully and as honestly as `United 93' we should be able to look passed our bias and embrace it for the tribute it truly is.Approaching the attack without bias was the one thing that truly impressed me about this film, for it showed both sides of the coin.  While yes, what was done was one of the most horrific acts our country has had to endure this film also gave us a look at the attackers who, while committing a horrible crime were not doing anything wrong in their own eyes.  There were many scenes that showed these men as they came close to their attack, the concern and the worry in their eyes, the panic.  They were scared, very scared.I don't want that to sound as if I condone what they've done because I don't, I just appreciate the way this film honestly portrayed the `villains' sort-of-speak instead of making them appear heartless and confident they appeared scared and panic-ridden.  It's a very commendable thing on the part of Greengrass.  Another smart move was having the film star almost no recognizable faces, so when we are watching this film we feel as though we are watching life, not a movie.  We can't say ""oh Brad Pitt won't die"" or ""I just saw Kate Winslet talking to Oprah about how hard it was to film that scene""...all we can do is watch in horror as these unrecognizable faces deal with the unbelievable.  It's one of those movies, where even though you know the outcome your frustrated with everyone on board hoping they'll do something else, anything else to deliver a happy ending.No, this is far from a feel good film.  It will make you cry, it will make you proud (proud that we have people around us who are selfless enough to try and save others) and it will make you pray that nothing like this ever happens again.

With the exception of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" I can't remember a movie having such moving effect on me.The entire film seems to be shot with handheld cameras, and this gives it a documentary-type feel.  In fact, it is almost as if this entire thing was captured on video as it actually happened and put in the movie theaters.  I'm sure that is exactly how director Paul Greengrass wanted it to appear.When I first heard this movie was coming out, I had a mix of emotions.  I worried that the film would portray the terrorists as being successful Jihadists that had foiled all of America's best defenses.  That was not the case.  I worried that ""United 93"" would portray President Bush as a man who failed to lead at such an important time in America's history.  That was not the case - he wasn't even in the movie at all, unless I missed it when I had to leave the theater for a few seconds.""United 93"" captures the emotional trauma, the desperate decisions, and the shockingly horrid events that took place on September 11, 2001.  The film is not your classical big Hollywood production.  There are no breathtakingly choreographed, large set scenes.  There is no famous Hollywood hunk in a lead role that you will remember for years to come.  No, this is a movie on fire with raw emotion.  It is a movie that takes you where you know evil seems to have won.  This film shows how brave men and women made sure that it didn't.I'm glad I made the choice to see this film.  It has made me think about how precious life is.  It has made me wonder how people can ever view innocent people as a target of revenge, no matter where they live, no matter how they live, and no matter what they think about my God and my faith.

And I do use the word 'film' on purpose, because this heartwrenching, moving, true story is not a movie, it is a film, and there IS a difference.  We go into ""United 93"" much like ""World Trade Center,"" in that we already know the outcome of the events in the film.  In fact, we pretty much know everything that is about to take place, including the specific phone conversations held by passengers and the small crew onboard.  But we could not prepare for the emotions that will wrack us within the almost two hour film span.I am a native NYer and a filmmaker, two things which make me inherently cynical to a lot of movies about 9/11 and have me running for the History Channel and National Geographic Documentaries.  However, ""United 93"" touched a different side of me because it takes us inside the minds, hearts, and emotions of those onboard the flight in a way no other fictional depiction has yet to do.  We all can close our eyes and see the planes hit the buildings-- whether we were in lower Manhattan or Washington or just saw the coverage moments later on television-- but we can only imagine the fear inside the cabin of United 93.  Until now.And while I found myself staring at the screen, awaiting the inevitable final moments-- of the film and of the passengers' lives-- a little part of me still held onto that Hollywood lens hope: that while we watched hands fight each other and intertwine for control-- hands that in the chaos could not be told apart from each other, hands of hijackers and passengers alike-- miraculously a pair of hands would grab ahold of steering device and pull that plane up even as the fields grew larger through the cockpit windshield.

Baer,"[1, 2]","The lives of the crew and passengers of United Flight 93 were extinguished when the Boeing 757 in which they were traveling plowed into Pennsylvania farmland on September 11, 2001. UNITED 93 pays them apt tribute.This film takes a different approach than A&E;'s FLIGHT 93 - released almost simultaneously - and is in my judgment the better of two fine films. The dizzying flight from one civilian and military group trying to make sense of the incomprehensible and fast-moving events of that autumn morning helps the viewer feel in his marrow the sheer confusion that reigned. I do not think that confusion should be mistaken for incompetence in a nation unaccustomed to attacks on its own soil, and this film arguably allows the facts to stand without damning interpretation.It is horrifying to watch the passengers' reconstructed predicament on the plane, and FLIGHT 93 does not avert its gaze from the fact that not all passengers might have agreed with the plan to take aircraft back. I am still shaking minutes after the film's conclusion, which starkly mimics the stubbornness of impact.I find the juxtaposition of doomed victims praying the Lord's Prayer minutes before their death with the recitation of Koranic verse by the murderers who killed them unhelpful, but perhaps this bit of poetic license was not--as it might appear--intended to suggest a moral equivalence between those two very different acts of faith.More horrifying than the A&E; project, this film should be seen but  younger viewers are not likely to benefit from the horror it so movingly portrays.One might, I suppose, pick up this DVD for voyeuristic purposes. Alternatively, it is a good thing for one hundred twenty minutes to stare evil and innocence in the face, to distinguish clearly between the two, and then to return to real life to live out one's choice.",5,'Something relatively devastating',1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,1844,"['lives', 'crew', 'passengers', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'were', 'extinguished', 'when', 'Boeing', '757', 'were', 'traveling', 'plowed', 'Pennsylvania', 'farmland', 'September', '11', '2001', 'UNITED', '93', 'pays', 'apt', 'tribute.This', 'film', 'different', 'approach', 'A', 'E', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'released', 'almost', 'simultaneously', 'judgment', 'better', 'two', 'fine', 'films', 'dizzying', 'flight', 'one', 'civilian', 'military', 'group', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'incomprehensible', 'fast-moving', 'events', 'autumn', 'morning', 'viewer', 'feel', 'marrow', 'sheer', 'confusion', 'reigned', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'confusion', 'should', 'be', 'mistaken', 'incompetence', 'nation', 'unaccustomed', 'attacks', 'own', 'soil', 'film', 'arguably', 'facts', 'stand', 'damning', 'interpretation.It', 'horrifying', 'watch', 'passengers', 'reconstructed', 'predicament', 'plane', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'not', 'avert', 'gaze', 'fact', 'not', 'passengers', 'might', 'have', 'agreed', 'plan', 'take', 'aircraft', 'back', 'am', 'still', 'shaking', 'minutes', 'film', 'conclusion', 'starkly', 'mimics', 'stubbornness', 'impact.I', 'find', 'juxtaposition', 'doomed', 'victims', 'praying', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'minutes', 'death', 'recitation', 'Koranic', 'verse', 'murderers', 'who', 'killed', 'unhelpful', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'poetic', 'license', 'was', 'not', 'might', 'appear', 'intended', 'suggest', 'moral', 'equivalence', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'acts', 'faith.More', 'horrifying', 'A', 'E', 'project', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'younger', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'benefit', 'horror', 'so', 'movingly', 'portrays.One', 'might', 'suppose', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'voyeuristic', 'purposes', 'Alternatively', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'hundred', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'stare', 'evil', 'innocence', 'face', 'distinguish', 'clearly', 'two', 'then', 'return', 'real', 'life', 'live', 'out', 'one', 'choice']",United 93

I got a frantic call from my big sister, and when I turned on the TV to see what happened all I got was static.  I lived eight miles away from ground zero and I felt cut off from the world.  As I finally found a channel on the TV that worked I saw the Twin Towers fall on live.  I didn't hear any explosions, I just saw a picture of two giant buildings falling.  I saw smoke rise as I drove to work later that afternoon.  The world had forever changed, but except for the pictures of anguish and shots of buildings falling down  I heard no explosive sounds from my vantage point.  Do you remember a sound?  Except if you were in lower Manhattan probably not.UNITED 93 is a film about an isolated moment in the middle of extreme chaos.  It's about mundane people living their mundane lives thrust into the most horrifying event in modern history.  It's a film about what a true hero is.  It's about evil men whose true cowardice united ordinary people.  But on a deeper level it's a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound.On September 11th 2001, four planes were hijacked.  Two hit the World Trade Center, and one hit the Pentagon.  The last plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. That plane was UNITED 93, to some it could have looked like a footnote to that horrible day.  But it became a symbol, because ordinary men and women took back the plane and gave their lives to save lives on the ground. Greenglass puts us right in the middle of this life and death drama.  We meet the hijackers, we meet the flight crew, and we meet the passengers.  We don't get to know them, but in real life do you really know who's sitting next to you?The film watches as people get ready for takeoff, as tower officials look at the skies on computer monitors. We check in with the FAA, the military, and we see that on September 11th life was pretty normal.  Then we watch helplessly as every one of these people is thrown into a tailspin when a plane disappears off a computer monitor.  We watch as a tiny green blip just disappears.  That flight hit the North Tower and it had just begun.What Greenglass wisely does is not focus on the carnage.  We don't even see the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and when the second one finally does there is not a big explosion.  We see it on a TV, with the CNN tickertape moving slowly by.  We see smoke, but we see no carnage.  Only Silence.  In a more conventional film we would probably see every explosion, but even as United 93 hits the ground we hear nothing, only silence. Because for the most part things only blow up in the movies.This device works well.  It makes UNITED 93 feel real.  The people feel real.  The action feels real.  I liken it to watching a home movie.  United 93 is so simple and effective I almost looked for the time and date stamps in the corner of the screen.  It's natural and raw.  That's why it is so effective and that's why it needed to be made now.September 11th's history is still being written.  As we get further and further from it  a romantic version of these events will begin to unfold.  You want proof check out a World War II film made in the 40's and compare it to PEARL HARBOR.  UNITED 93 is a film that's effectiveness will be felt 50 years from now when that generations Michael Bay decides to make a silly film about a girl and a guy who find love on the 65 floor of the trade center as they fall.  But in the here and now UNITED 93 will stand as a record of Hero's who saved the day, of the confusion that overtook us all, and of the raw power of real life.",4,a film about big events in life and how you very rarely hear a sound,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,3667,"['Where', 'was', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Where', 'was', 'America', 'was', 'attack', 'was', 'sleeping', 'got', 'frantic', 'call', 'big', 'sister', 'when', 'turned', 'TV', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'got', 'was', 'static', 'lived', 'eight', 'miles', 'away', 'ground', 'zero', 'felt', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'finally', 'found', 'channel', 'TV', 'worked', 'saw', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'fall', 'live', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'explosions', 'just', 'saw', 'picture', 'two', 'giant', 'buildings', 'falling', 'saw', 'smoke', 'rise', 'drove', 'work', 'later', 'afternoon', 'world', 'had', 'forever', 'changed', 'pictures', 'anguish', 'shots', 'buildings', 'falling', 'down', 'heard', 'explosive', 'sounds', 'vantage', 'point', 'Do', 'remember', 'sound', 'were', 'lower', 'Manhattan', 'probably', 'not.UNITED', '93', 'film', 'isolated', 'moment', 'middle', 'extreme', 'chaos', 'mundane', 'people', 'living', 'mundane', 'thrust', 'most', 'horrifying', 'event', 'modern', 'history', 'film', 'what', 'true', 'hero', 'evil', 'men', 'true', 'cowardice', 'united', 'ordinary', 'people', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'big', 'events', 'life', 'how', 'very', 'rarely', 'hear', 'sound.On', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'four', 'planes', 'were', 'hijacked', 'Two', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'one', 'hit', 'Pentagon', 'last', 'plane', 'crashed', 'field', 'Pennsylvania', 'plane', 'was', 'UNITED', '93', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'footnote', 'horrible', 'day', 'became', 'symbol', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'took', 'back', 'plane', 'gave', 'lives', 'save', 'lives', 'ground', 'Greenglass', 'right', 'middle', 'life', 'death', 'drama', 'meet', 'hijackers', 'meet', 'flight', 'crew', 'meet', 'passengers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'sitting', 'next', 'film', 'watches', 'people', 'get', 'ready', 'takeoff', 'tower', 'officials', 'look', 'skies', 'computer', 'monitors', 'check', 'FAA', 'military', 'see', 'September', '11th', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'normal', 'Then', 'watch', 'helplessly', 'one', 'people', 'thrown', 'tailspin', 'when', 'plane', 'computer', 'monitor', 'watch', 'tiny', 'green', 'blip', 'just', 'disappears', 'flight', 'hit', 'North', 'Tower', 'had', 'just', 'begun.What', 'Greenglass', 'wisely', 'not', 'focus', 'carnage', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'first', 'plane', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'when', 'second', 'one', 'finally', 'not', 'big', 'explosion', 'see', 'TV', 'CNN', 'tickertape', 'moving', 'slowly', 'see', 'smoke', 'see', 'carnage', 'Only', 'Silence', 'more', 'conventional', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'see', 'explosion', 'even', 'United', '93', 'ground', 'hear', 'nothing', 'only', 'silence', 'most', 'part', 'things', 'only', 'blow', 'up', 'movies.This', 'device', 'well', '93', 'feel', 'real', 'people', 'feel', 'real', 'action', 'feels', 'real', 'liken', 'watching', 'home', 'movie', 'United', '93', 'so', 'simple', 'effective', 'almost', 'looked', 'time', 'date', 'stamps', 'corner', 'screen', 'natural', 'raw', 'why', 'so', 'effective', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'made', '11th', 'history', 'still', 'being', 'written', 'get', 'further', 'further', 'romantic', 'version', 'events', 'will', 'begin', 'unfold', 'want', 'proof', 'check', 'out', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'made', '40', 'compare', 'PEARL', 'HARBOR', 'UNITED', '93', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'will', 'be', 'felt', '50', 'years', 'now', 'when', 'generations', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'make', 'silly', 'film', 'girl', 'guy', 'who', 'find', 'love', '65', 'floor', 'trade', 'center', 'fall', 'here', 'now', 'UNITED', '93', 'will', 'stand', 'record', 'Hero', 'who', 'saved', 'day', 'confusion', 'overtook', 'raw', 'power', 'real', 'life']",United 93

The film plays like a documentary and is very accomplished at showing the full horror as events unfolded. The tension on the plane is unbelievable both for the hijackers and the passengers. The same is true in the air traffic control area when they start realising planes have been hijacked.While watching the film, we all know there isn't going to be a happy ending but the director and writer, Paul Greengrass, is sympathetic to the plights of everyone involved.

The Islamic nihilists are clearly shown to be evil.  The four young men who hijack the flight hate us and everything we stand for.  They are true believers who readily rationalize the brutal slaughter of innocents.  Slashing the throats of the so-called nonbelievers is totally justified in their way of looking at the world.  And no, they are not particularly unique. Millions of Muslims also agree with them.  Do they represent the majority?  There are roughly 1.2 billion believers of Islam residing on this planet.  Even a small percentage of this total is enough to cause great concern.We, of course, already know much of the story before we enter the theater.  The tragic end is not a mystery.  Nonetheless, Greenglass's creation keeps our eyes glued to the screen.  I don't recall even hearing a pin drop.  Around three initially noisy teenagers sat in front of me.  They never uttered a word during the movie.  Needless to add, United 93 is not escapist entertainment.  The passengers are doomed---and they did nothing whatsoever to place themselves in such a predicament.  It was merely the luck of the draw.  Ultimately, a number of the passengers bravely attempt to recapture the plane.  If nothing else, we now know they likely saved our nation's capitol.  I will be blunt.  Do you plan on voting in November?  If so, you are perhaps even morally obligated to view United 93.  The stakes are too high to trust the safety of the American citizenry to elected officials who fail to truly comprehend the threat of the radical Muslims.  Small children should not see United 93.  Anyone over the age of 12, however, should definitely do so.  I plan on purchasing a DVD copy.  United 93 should be seen on at least a yearly basis.

644148,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00005JOZI,David Von Pein,"[6, 10]","When I sat down to watch the DVD of ""United 93"" I knew it was going to be a very good movie (based on other reviews I'd heard about the film and hearing people talking about it) -- but I was somewhat unprepared for the large emotional impact it was going to make. (And a physical impact as well; I was practically sweating bullets by the end of this movie.)""United 93"", written and directed with flawlessly-executed craftsmanship by Paul Greengrass, is easily the most powerful, the most riveting, and the most gut-wrenching film I have ever watched in my lifetime. And I cannot imagine it being topped in those categories for quite some time (if ever).In what seems very nearly a literal way, Director Greengrass has succeeded in placing every member of the audience on board that San Francisco-bound United Airlines Boeing 757-200 (N591UA), which represented Flight #93 on the sunny morning of September 11, 2001.Every single frame of film that went through Mr. Greengrass' camera while photographing this motion picture has a ""genuine"" feel to it. It is so eerily realistic, it's almost impossible not to have your hands shaking while watching this entire movie. I felt like I was among the passengers who were trying desperately to crash into that cockpit and overtake the terrorist hijackers.The actors that the producers hired to portray the 40 passengers and crew members are each to be applauded separately (and collectively), in my personal opinion, for their realistic and spot-on performances in this movie. It's really hard to describe how good this whole cast is. All of the performances from the men and women who share this cast roster will move you to tears. The terror on board that aircraft is so real during this movie, it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.I'm finding it difficult typing this review, after just now having watched the film for the very first time, and having been transfixed by the impeccable way that Mr. Greengrass has brought this horrifying true story to the big screen in a thoroughly respectful, non-exaggerated, and non-exploitative manner.This movie is hard to watch, that is for sure. Knowing that the brutal things we're seeing unfold on the screen actually (and incredibly) did take place above the eastern United States on 9/11/01 is enough to make your head swim, and to literally take your breath away at times too. I found myself having to breathe deeply many times just to make it through the intense scenes of stark terror.It's difficult to watch, yes....but it's also impossible NOT to keep watching this remarkable motion picture once you've taken a look at just the first few minutes.And as far as being technically well-made....this film is probably second to none as far as the subject of ""aviation"" is concerned. I've seen quite a few movies centering on the subject of airplanes and aviation, but ""United 93"" is by far the most ""technically accurate"" movie I have ever seen from the standpoint of realistic airplane footage.In the many scenes that take place aboard the plane which represents the Boeing 757 twin-jet airliner that plunged into a Pennsylvania field at more than 500 MPH at 10:03 AM on September 11th, I felt as if I was watching a real-life hijacking unfold inside the cabin and flight deck of a 757 in flight. The way the plane moves, the way the sky looks outside the cabin windows, the view from the cockpit....everything was absolutely perfect....and extremely realistic-looking. It's as if Mr. Greengrass was somehow able to actually film the hijacking in progress on 9/11. Just incredible.------------------In addition to providing a sparkling Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) print of ""United 93"", the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD set from Universal Studios offers up some nice bonus supplements too, including......1.) A director's Audio Commentary track with Paul Greengrass.2.) ""Chasing Planes: Witnesses To 9/11"" -- A 48-minute documentary/featurette (only available on the Limited Edition DVD). This is a program focusing on the military and the air-traffic controllers and their response to the national emergency on 9/11.Ben Sliney of the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, is featured prominently throughout this well-done bonus documentary. Sliney, who was the National Operations Manager for the FAA on 9/11, plays himself in ""United 93"" (in what is a fairly big part), and he's excellent in the film too.Incredibly, September 11, 2001, was Mr. Sliney's very first day on the job as the FAA's National Operations Manager. He was the man who initially gave the order to halt all U.S. air traffic at approximately 9:45 A.M. (ET) on 9/11, just a few minutes after American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.""Chasing Planes"" also features a unique high-angle video clip of United Flight 175 approaching and hitting the south tower of the World Trade Center. It's footage of that horrible moment in history that was taken from an angle that I had previously never seen before.By the way, the ""Chasing Planes"" documentary on Disc #2 of the ""LE"" DVD is shown in Anamorphic Widescreen, even though the packaging incorrectly indicates ""Full Frame 1.33:1"".3.) ""United 93: The Families And The Film"" -- A very good 60-minute documentary centering on the families of several of the victims of Flight 93. (Anamorphic Widescreen; approx. 1.85:1.)4.)

I saw World Trade Center earlier this year and felt it was so so (Maybe if they left out celebrity casting like this gem does, it would've been better). Donna and I had recorded Flight 93 on television, and I actually still don't know what the difference is between that and United 93. I do know that this one hit closest to home for me, literally. United 93 crashed in Somerset County less than 2 hours from my hometown. And we can postulate that it was a darn good thing it crashed since it was supposedly headed for D.C. Now I am not going to conspiracy theorize of anything with you, but how do we really know? Greenglass does a fine job of making a tasteful movie, but the only thing we know for sure that happened on that plane was what passengers said to people who they called before they all blew up and died. And Greenglass made his film around that.I'll admit. I cried. I sit here writing this, looking at the small TV where I watched the second plane crash into the WTC on CNN, and I watched my daughter play around me as I watched the movie earlier. She will never know a world without 9/11. She will never know the taken for granted freedoms we once had. It bugged me that Greenglass almost seemed to attempt to get into the psyche of the terrorists in the film, as if he knew what they were thinking. And how white everyone but the terrorists were in the film. The film bugged me. It bugged me that as with my grandparents before me who know where they were when Pearl Harbor was bombed or my parents who know where they were when Kennedy was shot, and now I won't forget where I was in Sept 11, 2001. I was in my bedroom in our first apartment getting ready for work watching on a small Emerson CRT television. And I sit here writing this, I wonder where my daughter will be when the next big catastrophe happens.Greenglass has a snowballs chance in hell for the directing nod, but maybe if the Academy wants to throw the auteur a bone it'll come in the shape of a film editing Oscar, even though there are some heavy hitters there, as well. We will see if the five year old largest catastrophe on American soil, and the third film about it, can come away with a solitaire award on Oscar night.",3,Average movie,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2324,"['live', 'cave', 'Tibet', 'know', 'film', '9/11', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'saw', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'earlier', 'year', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'Maybe', 'left', 'out', 'celebrity', 'casting', 'gem', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Donna', 'had', 'recorded', 'Flight', '93', 'television', 'actually', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'difference', 'United', '93', 'do', 'know', 'one', 'hit', 'closest', 'home', 'literally', 'United', '93', 'crashed', 'Somerset', 'County', 'less', '2', 'hours', 'hometown', 'can', 'postulate', 'was', 'darn', 'good', 'thing', 'crashed', 'was', 'supposedly', 'headed', 'D.C.', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'conspiracy', 'theorize', 'anything', 'how', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'Greenglass', 'fine', 'job', 'making', 'tasteful', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'know', 'sure', 'happened', 'plane', 'was', 'what', 'passengers', 'said', 'people', 'who', 'called', 'blew', 'up', 'died', 'Greenglass', 'made', 'film', 'that.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'cried', 'sit', 'here', 'writing', 'looking', 'small', 'TV', 'where', 'watched', 'second', 'plane', 'crash', 'WTC', 'CNN', 'watched', 'daughter', 'play', 'around', 'watched', 'movie', 'earlier', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'world', '9/11', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'taken', 'granted', 'freedoms', 'once', 'had', 'bugged', 'Greenglass', 'almost', 'seemed', 'attempt', 'get', 'psyche', 'terrorists', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'how', 'white', 'everyone', 'terrorists', 'were', 'film', 'film', 'bugged', 'bugged', 'grandparents', 'who', 'know', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'was', 'bombed', 'parents', 'who', 'know', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'shot', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'where', 'was', 'Sept', '11', '2001', 'was', 'bedroom', 'first', 'apartment', 'getting', 'ready', 'work', 'watching', 'small', 'Emerson', 'CRT', 'television', 'sit', 'here', 'writing', 'wonder', 'where', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'next', 'big', 'catastrophe', 'happens.Greenglass', 'snowballs', 'chance', 'hell', 'directing', 'nod', 'maybe', 'Academy', 'throw', 'auteur', 'bone', ""'ll"", 'come', 'shape', 'film', 'editing', 'Oscar', 'even', 'are', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'there', 'well', 'will', 'see', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'largest', 'catastrophe', 'American', 'soil', 'third', 'film', 'can', 'come', 'away', 'solitaire', 'award', 'Oscar', 'night']",United 93

644153,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,B00005JOZI,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[16, 20]","In United 93, director Paul Greengrass has made this year's best film to date. Come to think of it, this film will be remembered in years to come as a classic and deservedly so.The film tells the story of the plane that was hijacked along with three others on 9/11. Unlike the other planes, United 93 did not hit its intended target because of the courageous action of its passengers and surviving crew. Instead it crashed into a field, killing all on board, after the passengers staged a mid air revolt against their captors and stormed the cockpit, to try and gain control of the plane from the hijackers.Greengrass approaches his subject with a neutral and restrained manner. He recreates the Air Traffic Control on the day and it is populated by working people who are just going about their business amid the hubbub of a normal day at the office. Tragically this routine is disrupted by first one plane, and then another, followed by another going incommunicado and disappearing off the radar screens. Speculation and confusion is rife at this point, and then the impacts on the Twin Towers occur, and oh so slowly the realisation dawns among this workforce that today is a day unlike no other. No attempt is made to airbrush away the confusion and communication failures that occurred at all levels that day whether at the FAA or military, or even higher. Instead you have a well realised vision of large numbers of people doing their best to cope with the unthinkable.The hijackers themselves are neutrally depicted. They are nervous and eager to get on with the job in hand. Ruthless when it comes to killing people, their increasing fear of the passengers is brilliantly depicted as slowly they start to realise that the individuals that they had cowed earlier on, are becoming a cohesive unit, with the intention of fighting back.Death is depicted in real time and it is both protracted and messy. People simply do not die quickly when stabbed or bludgeoned, and Greengrass depicts this with chilling realism.The passengers themselves are portrayed as everyday people undergoing the routine of a flight. At the beginning, as usual no one talks to each other apart from when necessary. When the hijack kicks off, they become cowed and terrified, as the hijackers kill one of their number, plus some of the Flight Crew.Huddling together in terror, they learn the awful truth via mobile phones as to what is going on outside. Then the stronger individuals among them stand forward and plan the fight back....I do not know just how close this was to reality but Greengrass creates the effect of almost putting you among these people and sharing their terror. The use of hand held cameras and the grainy look to the film, give it a gritty realism which just adds to the overall viewing experience.Be warned this is not an easy film to watch, and at times I could see other people in the audience becoming visibly uncomfortable and upset by what they were seeing on the screen. At times, I too became uncomfortable with what was being depicted.See this film for what it is, a harrowing depiction of ordinary people trying to cope in a terrifyingly extraordinary situation.The lasting legacy of those brave souls on United 93 is that they have served notice on future hijackers, that it is the ordinary person in the street that they now have to fear, not just the military.Their brave action is an example to people of all religions and all backgrounds, to come together and unite against any extreme and malevolent philosophy that basically seeks the destruction of all who do not subscribe to it.United 93, united indeed.",5,A film to remember,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,3627,"['United', '93', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'made', 'year', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'Come', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come', 'classic', 'deservedly', 'so.The', 'film', 'story', 'plane', 'was', 'hijacked', 'three', 'others', '9/11', 'other', 'planes', 'United', '93', 'did', 'not', 'hit', 'intended', 'target', 'courageous', 'action', 'passengers', 'surviving', 'crew', 'Instead', 'crashed', 'field', 'killing', 'board', 'passengers', 'staged', 'mid', 'air', 'revolt', 'captors', 'stormed', 'cockpit', 'try', 'gain', 'control', 'plane', 'hijackers.Greengrass', 'subject', 'neutral', 'restrained', 'manner', 'Air', 'Traffic', 'Control', 'day', 'populated', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'business', 'hubbub', 'normal', 'day', 'office', 'Tragically', 'routine', 'disrupted', 'first', 'one', 'plane', 'then', 'followed', 'going', 'incommunicado', 'disappearing', 'off', 'radar', 'screens', 'Speculation', 'confusion', 'rife', 'point', 'then', 'impacts', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'occur', 'oh', 'so', 'slowly', 'realisation', 'workforce', 'today', 'day', 'other', 'attempt', 'made', 'airbrush', 'away', 'confusion', 'communication', 'failures', 'occurred', 'levels', 'day', 'FAA', 'military', 'even', 'higher', 'Instead', 'have', 'well', 'realised', 'vision', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'doing', 'best', 'cope', 'unthinkable.The', 'hijackers', 'are', 'neutrally', 'depicted', 'are', 'nervous', 'eager', 'get', 'job', 'hand', 'Ruthless', 'when', 'killing', 'people', 'increasing', 'fear', 'passengers', 'brilliantly', 'depicted', 'slowly', 'start', 'realise', 'individuals', 'had', 'cowed', 'earlier', 'are', 'becoming', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'intention', 'fighting', 'back.Death', 'depicted', 'real', 'time', 'protracted', 'messy', 'People', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'die', 'quickly', 'when', 'stabbed', 'bludgeoned', 'Greengrass', 'chilling', 'realism.The', 'passengers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'everyday', 'people', 'undergoing', 'routine', 'flight', 'beginning', 'usual', 'one', 'other', 'apart', 'when', 'necessary', 'When', 'hijack', 'off', 'become', 'cowed', 'terrified', 'hijackers', 'kill', 'one', 'number', 'Flight', 'Crew.Huddling', 'together', 'terror', 'learn', 'awful', 'truth', 'mobile', 'phones', 'what', 'going', 'outside', 'Then', 'stronger', 'individuals', 'stand', 'forward', 'plan', 'fight', 'back', '.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'reality', 'Greengrass', 'effect', 'almost', 'putting', 'people', 'sharing', 'terror', 'use', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'grainy', 'look', 'film', 'give', 'gritty', 'realism', 'just', 'overall', 'viewing', 'experience.Be', 'warned', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'times', 'could', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'audience', 'becoming', 'visibly', 'uncomfortable', 'upset', 'what', 'were', 'seeing', 'screen', 'times', 'too', 'became', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'depicted.See', 'film', 'what', 'harrowing', 'depiction', 'ordinary', 'people', 'trying', 'cope', 'terrifyingly', 'extraordinary', 'situation.The', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'brave', 'souls', 'United', '93', 'have', 'served', 'notice', 'future', 'hijackers', 'ordinary', 'person', 'street', 'now', 'have', 'fear', 'not', 'just', 'military.Their', 'brave', 'action', 'example', 'people', 'religions', 'backgrounds', 'come', 'together', 'unite', 'extreme', 'malevolent', 'philosophy', 'basically', 'destruction', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'subscribe', 'it.United', '93', 'united', 'indeed']",United 93
644154,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00005JOZI,D. Knouse,"[2, 3]","Writing the title of my review just now gave me chills.  Awesome!  This movie works on every level imaginable.  It is a masterful, technical achievement that is impressive througout under the supremely talented eye of director Paul Greengrass.  His Oscar-nomination for his work here is more than justly deserved. I sincerely hope he wins.  The characters are all humanistic and easy to care about.  Even the terrorists, who embark on a crime against humanity, come across as real people who sincerely believe in what they are doing.  Creepy.  There is the underlying tension at the beginning as passengers and crew board the doomed flight, and one cannot help but hope the plane never takes off at all, that some technical problem will keep the plane grounded and safe; the people aboard returned to their families.  The idea of using hand-held cameras throughout the movie intitially turned me off from seeing this film.  Normally, under most circumstances, I despise hand-held camera-work as it comes across as amateurish and annoying.  But in this film the increasing tension aboard the plane makes use of hand-held cameras more kinetic.

644155,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005JOZI,DonAthos,"[12, 18]","United 93 depicts the horrific events during September 11, 2001, leading up to the crash of flight United 93, which terrorists had planned to use to demolish the U.S. Capitol building as they had the World Trade Center.There are probably many who feel that this film is ""too soon"" or in other ways in bad taste (i.e. trying to capitalize on a tragedy). However, if we agree that a film should be made on this subject at all, this film did it correctly. There is nothing overtly ""cinematic"" about this movie--we're just shown what happened. It is not moralizing at us. It is not telling us how to feel about anything. Just showing what happened, kind of like a dramatic re-enactment.If there is a message to the movie, it is only because the real life events themselves contained it. Perhaps the most compelling ""theme"" is how unprepared the government was to deal with this kind of a crisis--how the only people in a position to do anything at all were the passengers on the plane. One moment of dark comedy is how, with all of their technology and power, neither the military nor the FAA could figure out what the hijackers were doing until they turned on CNN and watched the coverage along with everyone else.I imagine that some people will complain that the terrorists were not depicted as being more villainous. It is true that some of the hijackers are treated with some measure of sympathy--they are shown to be human beings. However, this is not inappropriate, as whatever else they were, the hijackers *were* human beings. We don't know, and can't know, whether any of the terrorists hesitated, as was portrayed in this movie, but it doesn't make their deeds any less heinous for it. It simply makes them more believable and realistic, which is important because that's the great strength of this movie.United 93 is not really an enjoyable movie to watch simply because it is so sad, but it is well made and very powerful. It draws its power via the fact that it presents these still-painful events  impartially and with an open eye--that it does so realistically--and the quality of the film answers any objections I had going in as to the appropriateness of its creation.",5,United 93--The Tragic Flight as it Really Might Have Happened,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,2181,"['United', '93', 'horrific', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001', 'leading', 'up', 'crash', 'flight', 'United', '93', 'had', 'planned', 'use', 'demolish', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'building', 'had', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center.There', 'are', 'probably', 'many', 'who', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'soon', 'other', 'ways', 'bad', 'taste', 'i.e', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'tragedy', 'However', 'agree', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'subject', 'film', 'did', 'correctly', 'nothing', 'overtly', 'cinematic', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'shown', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'moralizing', 'not', 'telling', 'how', 'feel', 'anything', 'Just', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'kind', 'dramatic', 're-enactment.If', 'message', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'contained', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'compelling', 'theme', 'how', 'unprepared', 'government', 'was', 'deal', 'kind', 'crisis', 'how', 'only', 'people', 'position', 'do', 'anything', 'were', 'passengers', 'plane', 'One', 'moment', 'dark', 'comedy', 'how', 'technology', 'power', 'military', 'FAA', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hijackers', 'were', 'doing', 'turned', 'CNN', 'watched', 'coverage', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'imagine', 'people', 'will', 'complain', 'terrorists', 'were', 'not', 'depicted', 'being', 'more', 'villainous', 'true', 'hijackers', 'are', 'treated', 'measure', 'sympathy', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'human', 'beings', 'However', 'not', 'inappropriate', 'else', 'were', 'hijackers', '*were*', 'human', 'beings', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'terrorists', 'hesitated', 'was', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'deeds', 'less', 'heinous', 'simply', 'more', 'believable', 'realistic', 'important', 'great', 'strength', 'movie.United', '93', 'not', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'simply', 'so', 'sad', 'well', 'made', 'very', 'powerful', 'power', 'fact', 'still-painful', 'events', 'impartially', 'open', 'eye', 'so', 'realistically', 'quality', 'film', 'answers', 'objections', 'had', 'going', 'appropriateness', 'creation']",United 93

Carter ""The Marching Bugler""","[3, 8]","While this film does a great job of portraying the horror of the events and the evil of the terrorists, I can only give it three stars out of five because of too many grievances I have with it.There were four men who made names for themselves on this flight: Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick and Mark Bingham.  Only Burnett and Glick are recognizable in this movie.  For most of the movie, I thought the actor playing Mark Bingham was supposed to be Beamer until he was swearing like a sailor which seemed out of character.  Then I thought maybe he was Glick until the Glick character said his name on a phone call.  I should not have had to do an internet search to figure out who the characters were.The biggest rallying cry of 9/11 came from Todd Beamer's, ""Let's roll,"" but when I saw this in theaters I didn't hear it at all.  On video, I had to play back the ending a second time to find out that Beamer's famous statement is whispered so quietly in this movie you can barely hear it over the engine noise.  Then, after all the passengers seem to ignore him, he says, ""Let's go"" -  and they continue to sit in their seats!  Later, it is Glick who is shown leading the charge, but not in response to ""Let's roll.""Of those four, only Glick's family is interviewed in the documentary.  In the commentary, Greengrass does not even mention Beamer's name.  He just says, ""That's the actor, David Alan Basche.""  It's up to us to figure out the character's name.  Why the subtle downplaying of the biggest folk hero on the plane?  He hardly even got any screen time.  But to watch this film, you would think every passenger in the plane was equally heroic in the fight against the cockpit.  Excuse me, but I don't honestly believe the trembling, crying women were battling the terrorists.  I'm sorry.This is why the movie did not do well at the box office.

The lack of steadycams and tracking shots lends the film an urgency and reality that was an absolute necessity for such a work. Greengrass also makes sure not to cast any established stars in any roles. To do this would be to Hollywoodise the whole situation and would take from the poignancy and realism of the picture.The portrayals of the hijackers is also done in an original and gripping way.

644162,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JOZI,Ed Uyeshima,"[31, 34]","A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized ""United 93"". At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. It also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, such controversy is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point.

644166,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JOZI,Erik North,"[4, 13]","When one thinks of September 11, 2001, one usually thinks of the War on Terror that it helped spawn.  But the politics of 9/11's aftermath are just one aspect of it, and it is something that writer/director Paul Greengrass (THE BOURNE SUPREMACY) has chosen to sidestep in favor of a gut-wrenching, humanistic approach in his film UNITED 93.United Airlines Flight 93, enroute from Newark to San Francisco on that fateful morning, was the only one of the four hijacked planes that didn't reach its intended target (which, as the film shows, was most likely the U.S. Capitol Building).  This is because the passengers onboard, knowing already that two planes had nailed the World Trade Center and a third had taken out the southwest corner of the Pentagon, quickly formulated a plan to try and take back control of the aircraft from the four Islamist terrorists who had taken it over.  Although their attempt to regain control of the aircraft was doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, their actions saved untold thousands of lives in the nation's capitol.Utilizing a docudrama approach via hand-held cameras, as well as razor-sharp editing, Greengrass, working with a cast of largely unknown actors plus some of the very civilian air traffic and military personnel who were there on that terrible day, made UNITED 93 an intense experience, but one that avoids political grandstanding.  This film is about people, pure and simple--from the people in the civilian and military air trafic control centers faced with a thoroughly impossible situation, to the fanatical hijackers, to the passengers who were determined to stop them.Of course, there are well-reasoned arguments against UNITED 93, that it is too soon for a 9/11-related film to be released now (though maybe FAHRENHEIT 9/11 slipped everyboody's mind).

If not for their bravery and courage, the plane, undoubtedly, would have reached it's target (either the White House or Congress) on that dreadful day which America was under attack.The movie is an incredible depiction of what transpired that morning on United 93.  The choreography of the movie was remarkably done.  The casting of the characters couldn't have been better.  The time frame of the movie was perfect - not too long, not too short.One of my favorite parts about this DVD is the Bonus Feature - where the characters meet the actual family members of the individuals they are playing in the movie.

I was never there, in fact, I had been in Arizona at the time over 2000 miles away, but 3 people I knew were in that buildings, and it had been just as devastating an experience as it was for people who were actually there to see it.For me, I have no problems with these movies whatsoever, but being the type of person who sees films on a regular basis, you must understand that the whole ""Based on a true story"" propaganda always reels me, especially when I saw it all and know exactly what's going on. Having already seen ""Flight 93"", the television film which had shocked me, I found no sense in seeing United 93 because I figured I was probably going to just be seeing the same thing over and just wasting my. How terribly wrong I was. I also had to consider that I wasn't going to be able to see it alone because I am 16 and the film was Rated R. Subsequent family members said there was nothing bad to it at all, and they, like me, had seen the television film as well but said this was miles above that one.On the seemingly normal morning of September 11th, 2001, several people prepared for their jobs. Whether it be ground control for the airport in New York or Washington D.C. or a business flight out of either, it was supposed to be a routine day. That was until 4 planes over the east coast were high-jacked by a group of terrorists out of the Middle East. 2 planes reached their target at the World Trade Center, 1 more also reached it's target at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. This is the story of the fourth which never reached it's target.What I appreciated most about United 93 is the way Paul Greengrass brought about the portrayal of each of the real people aboard the plane. Each was brought out with no background, no explanation to why they were on the plane in the first place, and no popular actors to play them, which is exactly the way they were in real life. Normal people with regular lives, not at all unlike us. They didn't stand out until that day, and even in the movie none of them stand out particularly. Everyone is an important part of the story. The writers did nothing to inhance the characters to make the movie, which made it so much better. Greengrass was most respectful in that aspect, and I must congratulate him in doing so.The ensemble cast of mainly unknown actors was absolutely incredible, especially since so many of them were so unexperienced. The dialogue they had to master was also difficult challenge for them I'm sure. To explain, most of the people understand that the script was written to include dialogue in which the characters interrupted and overlapped themselves on a regular basis just as people do in real life everyday, even with included ""um""s. The only direct back and forth dialogue is read by the terrorists.The shoestring budget of $15 million dollars was well spent and was exactly what the television film had. Better production values, and an ending that will leave you seeing exactly what the passengers saw when United 93 went down will leave you gasping for breath and stone cold after the film ends. Not everything is a happy ending, and it sure wasn't for these poor souls. One thing I know for sure in my heart is that United 93 is not a film that enhances the true story in anyway.

I no longer sleep well; I am unsettled psychically, jumpy and easily depressed; but it cannot be nearly as hard on me as it is on those in close contact with the lost. This movie brings that horrible day back, presented in as close to real time as possible.It was a beautiful, sparkling day,all across the U.S., which makes what happened even more stark. I can remember remarking to myself at about 7:15 a.m. my time - barely 45 minutes, New York time, before the chaos began - what a gorgeous day it was.The movie starts in that fashion - ordinary people going about their ordinary lives, engaging in light chitchat as they board, air traffic controllers attending to routine meetings and assignments, no hint that our world is about to be plunged into darkness.  The first hint comes from an alert controller in the Boston arena, who in an attempt to establish contact with AA11, intercepts what he instantly recognizes as a hijacking from the cockpit of that plane.A lot of the personnel represented in this movie are the real deal, controllers and supervisors actually involved in the activities that day. Several traffic towers are shown; NORAD is included; and the degree of confusion and uncertainty which was rampant on that day is aptly depicted. There is misunderstanding and misinformation, which is understandable; we have never undergone anything of this magnitude or evil before, couched in would-be platitudes of religious fervor. The sheer disbelief that anyone could be capable of this is visible on the faces of the controllers who watch in horror as the second plane immolates the South Tower.As the WTC is attacked, United 93 - ironically delayed in takeoff - rises from the tarmac into the sun. For some time no one is aware of danger; a message from the cockpit computer to the pilots, bewaring of cockpit intrusion, is mused about by the pilots calmly eating their breakfast. The hijackers fidgit in their seats, waiting for word from their leader, until one cannot stand it any more and rushes an attendant, starting the chaos in the plane. From there the story is told in what we know from phone conversations and the voice recorder, heartbreaking vigniettes of the terror 40 people suffered in a cramped enclosure they could not escape. The courage is unmistakable; there only appeared to be hysteria at the end, with inevitability at hand. I was proud to be an American with other Americans who acted with such fortitude as the passengers on United 93.This is a powerful film, one that should be required viewing in some college classes - not by all, perhaps; it is gutwrenching and a shock to the system. But if the families of those who were lost think it is important - and it is clear that they do, in one of the bonus features - it is the duty of those of us here now to honor the memories of those valiant passengers.",5,Black Tuesday,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2940,"['2001', 'many', 'Americans', 'days', 'surrounding', 'September', '11', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'no', 'longer', 'sleep', 'well', 'am', 'unsettled', 'psychically', 'jumpy', 'easily', 'depressed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'hard', 'close', 'contact', 'lost', 'movie', 'horrible', 'day', 'back', 'presented', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'time', 'possible.It', 'was', 'beautiful', 'sparkling', 'day', 'U.S.', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'more', 'stark', 'can', 'remember', 'remarking', 'myself', 'about', '7:15', 'a.m.', 'time', 'barely', '45', 'minutes', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'chaos', 'began', 'what', 'gorgeous', 'day', 'movie', 'starts', 'fashion', 'ordinary', 'people', 'going', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'engaging', 'light', 'chitchat', 'board', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'attending', 'routine', 'meetings', 'assignments', 'hint', 'world', 'be', 'plunged', 'darkness', 'first', 'hint', 'alert', 'controller', 'Boston', 'arena', 'who', 'attempt', 'establish', 'contact', 'AA11', 'what', 'instantly', 'hijacking', 'cockpit', 'plane.A', 'lot', 'personnel', 'represented', 'movie', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'controllers', 'supervisors', 'actually', 'involved', 'activities', 'day', 'Several', 'traffic', 'towers', 'are', 'shown', 'NORAD', 'included', 'degree', 'confusion', 'uncertainty', 'was', 'rampant', 'day', 'aptly', 'depicted', 'misunderstanding', 'misinformation', 'understandable', 'have', 'never', 'undergone', 'anything', 'magnitude', 'evil', 'couched', 'would-be', 'platitudes', 'religious', 'fervor', 'sheer', 'disbelief', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'capable', 'visible', 'controllers', 'who', 'watch', 'horror', 'second', 'plane', 'South', 'Tower.As', 'WTC', 'attacked', 'United', '93', 'ironically', 'delayed', 'takeoff', 'rises', 'tarmac', 'sun', 'time', 'one', 'aware', 'danger', 'message', 'cockpit', 'computer', 'pilots', 'bewaring', 'cockpit', 'intrusion', 'mused', 'pilots', 'calmly', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'hijackers', 'fidgit', 'seats', 'waiting', 'word', 'leader', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'more', 'attendant', 'starting', 'chaos', 'plane', 'story', 'told', 'what', 'know', 'phone', 'conversations', 'voice', 'recorder', 'heartbreaking', 'vigniettes', 'terror', '40', 'people', 'suffered', 'cramped', 'enclosure', 'could', 'not', 'escape', 'courage', 'unmistakable', 'only', 'appeared', 'be', 'hysteria', 'end', 'inevitability', 'hand', 'was', 'proud', 'be', 'American', 'other', 'Americans', 'who', 'acted', 'such', 'fortitude', 'passengers', 'United', '93.This', 'powerful', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'college', 'classes', 'not', 'perhaps', 'gutwrenching', 'shock', 'system', 'families', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'think', 'important', 'clear', 'do', 'one', 'bonus', 'duty', 'here', 'now', 'honor', 'memories', 'valiant', 'passengers']",United 93

That is, he had nothing of great import to say about his chosen subject and expected us belatedly to do the work. The result is of questionable merit. After 9/11, the need to compile and endlessly replay Twin Towers footage from every conceivable angle struck me as almost getting off on the spectacle. Likewise here, ""Roll up! Roll up! Dare yourself to climb aboard the United 93 Rollercoaster ride of a lifetime! You'll ""ooh"", you'll ""aagh"" and leave covered in sweat and tears with your stomach in your throat!"" The 'movie movie' type thriller music, especially when the second plane impacts is a dead giveaway in this regard. Since the purpose of 9/11 was to create terror in the civilian population, it seems wilfully perverse to allow oneself to be terrorized a second time, doing their work for them. It is giving them the 'oxygen of publicity' as Maggie Thatcher once put it. I'm not saying it was made purely for reasons of venality. Few films make money and this was definately a hard sell. Nevertheless, I suspect many will be going for the visceral experience alone, rather than for anything edifying (which is, in any case, not there) and must be counted as something of an own goal by the West.I was also minded of 'Hookey' in 'Zulu', whose descendants were offended by the wholly unjustified portrayal of him as a malingerer at Rorke's Drift.

I'm  gonna look at this as just a film, which seems appropriate enough, considering that that's what it is.As pretty much everyone has mentions, `United 93' manages to avoid pretty much all of the obvious potential  faults it could've had.  Realism is always of the utmost importance, and Greengrass doesn't sentimentalize the situation, and most significantly, the film is devoid of any apparent commentary or moral and simply presents the events flatly, assuming that they will speak for themselves.  I think Greengrass gets perhaps a bit too much credit for his straightforward presentation.  As far as I'm concerned this approach is a bare minimum requirement for the film to be any good at all.  Still, consider this requirement met.`United 93' is essentially two films in one, one excellent, the other okay.  These divisions come between the scenes actually on and involving United 93, and the scenes involving the FAA and air traffic controllers on the ground.  I'm less fond of the scenes on the ground, as they eventually prove to be somewhat dull and repetitive, because they consist of little more than a large number of people talking with one another, trying to figure out precisely what is going on and how to deal with it and so on.  I don't doubt that they're extremely accurate, and they are necessary to the film as a whole, seeing as how there just isn't enough going on in United 93 for it to carry a feature length film, but we definitely didn't need as much of this as we got.  Certainly, these scenes are sharply and professionally done, but there just isn't that much to them.The scenes on the plane itself are far better, though they too could probably stand to be trimmed ever so slightly.  Obviously, there's going to be an enormous amount of conjecture going on in these parts of the film, but it always feels extraordinarily real.  Greengrass does a particularly good job with the terrorists, not portraying them as utterly inhuman monsters, but not falsely trying to excuse their behavior.  The passengers themselves are realistically devoid of characterization--  There wouldn't have been any time for them to really get to know each other, so we see simply see them on the surface, identifying them by little more than their faces.Greengrass uses `documentary-style' filmmaking, meaning lotsa of wobbly, handheld camerawork to go along with some frantic editing in the confrontational scenes.  This is always a dangerous tactic cause if you do it poorly it's incredibly obnoxious, and makes the film utterly unbelievable. (i.e. Scenes shot this way often degenerate into a random juxtaposition of images with no comprehensible relation, and thus become totally cinematic and thus utterly unrealistic, on top of being just as annoying as hell.)  Fortunately, this method is used better here than in perhaps anything else I've seen, as it generates a real sense of chaos and claustrophobia while still remaining fairly easy to tell what's going on.  At it's best, particularly during the initial overthrow and the final rebellion, the film generates a sort of bleak, horrific intensity that has rarely been matched else where.  Of course, it's only operating at it's highest level in a few scenes, since most of the scenes on the plane are in anticipation of the conflict, but these other scenes are more eventful than one might anticipate, and the whole film is effectively suffused with a sense of dread and impending doom.  (One which, I believe, would still be there even if we didn't already know the outcome.)Frankly, I don't buy the assertion of so many reviewers and viewers that this is an `important' film.  How so?  To remind us or convince us that 9/11 was a very bad thing?  I must say, I already thought that.  Still, this is an intense, often fairly moving and very professionally made film that shows the potential of more realistic, less stylized and conventionalized form of cinema. Again, it could stand a few trims that would then heighten the impact, but what is here is certainly effective enough as it is.Grade: B+",4,Very Well Done,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,4233,"[""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'discussing', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'films', 'regards', 'appropriateness', 'accuracy', 'whatever', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', ""'m"", 'gon', 'look', 'as', 'just', 'film', 'appropriate', 'enough', 'considering', 'what', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'mentions', 'United', '93', 'manages', 'avoid', 'pretty', 'much', 'obvious', 'potential', 'faults', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Realism', 'always', 'utmost', 'importance', 'Greengrass', ""n't"", 'sentimentalize', 'situation', 'most', 'significantly', 'film', 'devoid', 'apparent', 'commentary', 'moral', 'simply', 'events', 'flatly', 'assuming', 'will', 'speak', 'think', 'Greengrass', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'straightforward', 'presentation', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'approach', 'bare', 'minimum', 'requirement', 'film', 'be', 'good', 'Still', 'consider', 'requirement', 'met.', 'United', '93', 'essentially', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'one', 'excellent', 'other', 'okay', 'divisions', 'come', 'scenes', 'actually', 'involving', 'United', '93', 'scenes', 'involving', 'FAA', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'ground', ""'m"", 'less', 'fond', 'scenes', 'ground', 'eventually', 'prove', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'repetitive', 'consist', 'little', 'more', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'talking', 'one', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'precisely', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'deal', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'accurate', 'are', 'necessary', 'film', 'whole', 'seeing', 'how', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'going', 'United', '93', 'carry', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'as', 'much', 'got', 'Certainly', 'scenes', 'are', 'sharply', 'professionally', 'done', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'them.The', 'scenes', 'plane', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'too', 'could', 'probably', 'stand', 'be', 'trimmed', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'Obviously', 'going', 'be', 'enormous', 'amount', 'conjecture', 'going', 'parts', 'film', 'always', 'extraordinarily', 'real', 'Greengrass', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'terrorists', 'not', 'portraying', 'utterly', 'inhuman', 'monsters', 'not', 'falsely', 'trying', 'excuse', 'behavior', 'passengers', 'are', 'realistically', 'devoid', 'characterization', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'see', 'simply', 'see', 'surface', 'identifying', 'little', 'more', 'faces.Greengrass', 'documentary-style', 'filmmaking', 'meaning', 'lotsa', 'wobbly', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'go', 'along', 'frantic', 'editing', 'confrontational', 'scenes', 'always', 'dangerous', 'tactic', 'cause', 'do', 'poorly', 'incredibly', 'obnoxious', 'film', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'i.e', 'Scenes', 'shot', 'way', 'often', 'degenerate', 'random', 'juxtaposition', 'images', 'comprehensible', 'relation', 'thus', 'become', 'totally', 'cinematic', 'thus', 'utterly', 'unrealistic', 'top', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'annoying', 'hell', 'Fortunately', 'method', 'used', 'better', 'here', 'perhaps', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'sense', 'chaos', 'claustrophobia', 'still', 'remaining', 'fairly', 'easy', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'best', 'particularly', 'initial', 'overthrow', 'final', 'rebellion', 'film', 'sort', 'bleak', 'horrific', 'intensity', 'rarely', 'been', 'matched', 'else', 'where', 'course', 'only', 'operating', 'highest', 'level', 'few', 'scenes', 'most', 'scenes', 'plane', 'are', 'anticipation', 'conflict', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'eventful', 'one', 'might', 'anticipate', 'whole', 'film', 'effectively', 'suffused', 'sense', 'dread', 'impending', 'doom', 'One', 'believe', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'there', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'assertion', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'viewers', 'important', 'film', 'How', 'so', 'remind', 'convince', '9/11', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'already', 'thought', 'Still', 'intense', 'often', 'fairly', 'moving', 'very', 'professionally', 'made', 'film', 'potential', 'more', 'realistic', 'less', 'stylized', 'conventionalized', 'form', 'cinema', 'Again', 'could', 'stand', 'few', 'trims', 'would', 'then', 'heighten', 'impact', 'what', 'here', 'certainly', 'effective', 'enough', 'B+']",United 93

If one were to sit through all of the existing footage and primary source material on the WTC attacks it would probably take a decade to watch it all. We've all witnessed the fate of the people in the first two planes, the firefighters, the hopeless victims trapped on the upper floors many times over. For that reason, I will never watch a fictionalized version of anything related to the WTC. There is simply no need.The story of those aboard United 93 has largely been overshadowed because there are no witnesses or videotapes. Actual audio has been withheld, misguidedly in my opinion, by the government. So I thought this film would be the closest thing to a factual portrayal I was going to get. And that is exactly the case. The viewer is given the opportunity to experience what the passengers experienced without a lot of emotionally manipulative moviemaking techniques. It's ordinary people on an ordinary flight.I did feel a rush of pride during the ""final charge"" and that is the best memorial that could be given to these brave people. I found myself hoping they could still pull it off, even though that was obviously impossible. I got the impression from the film that the passengers got pretty close to actually taking back control of the plane. And it is suggested that had they done so, there were a couple passengers capable of operating the plane. Another two minutes and who knows?

This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect  - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane.  Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board.  Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001.  The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events.  Highly Recommended on every level.

Given that the flight portion happens in real time, you don't get a feel for the passengers as individuals, the way you do in the book, ""Among the Heroes : United Flight 93 and the Passengers and Crew Who Fought Back,"" by Jere Longman.  For one thing, on the real flight, many phone calls were made simultaneously, so to stay true to real-time, the film could only focus on snippets.  Based on my reading of that book and articles about the event, the movie captures a likely on-plane scenario as a whole, but misses lots of details.While the passengers may have been heroes, I find the move itself overrated.  It had the typical cheesy suspense music as it cut back and forth between the bad guys and good guys.  Other than some good cinematography at the beginning and end, most was average.  Known details that would have helped capture what really went on during that flight were omitted.I thought the acting was mostly decent however, particularly flight attendant Sandy Bradshaw and the hijackers.  The hijackers were kept separate during the filming, so they wouldn't develop a rapport with the other actors, and it shows.  The actors were unknowns and little-knowns, so we're not distracted by seeing big names on screen.  However, I thought the actors showed a little too much anxiety early in the flight, before any problems became known.One interesting thing well-captured was the ordinariness of the day, such as passengers yakking on their cell phones in the airport waiting area and spacing out during the safety announcements, and typical pre-flight prep.  Any one of us could have been on that flight.  The movie serves as a reminder that any day could be our last.  And furthermore, any one of us can find ourselves in an emergency where we must make life and death decisions, and do our best with whatever materials are on-hand and incomplete information.As a movie, United 93 is average and nothing special.  But I've added a star as the movie makes an effort to cover history in a sensitive manner, and is a good guess as to what it was like to be on that flight.",4,Would have been an average movie had it not been depicting a real event,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,2225,"['United', '93', ""'re"", 'fly', 'wall', 'doomed', 'flight', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'NORAD', 'hijackers', 'hotel', 'room', 'prior', 'flight', 'Given', 'flight', 'portion', 'real', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feel', 'passengers', 'individuals', 'way', 'do', 'book', 'Heroes', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'Passengers', 'Crew', 'Who', 'Fought', 'Back', 'Jere', 'Longman', 'one', 'thing', 'real', 'flight', 'many', 'phone', 'calls', 'were', 'made', 'simultaneously', 'so', 'stay', 'true', 'real-time', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'focus', 'snippets', 'Based', 'reading', 'book', 'articles', 'event', 'movie', 'likely', 'on-plane', 'scenario', 'whole', 'lots', 'details.While', 'passengers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'heroes', 'find', 'move', 'overrated', 'had', 'typical', 'cheesy', 'suspense', 'music', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'Other', 'good', 'cinematography', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'was', 'average', 'Known', 'details', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'capture', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'flight', 'were', 'omitted.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'decent', 'however', 'particularly', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Sandy', 'Bradshaw', 'hijackers', 'hijackers', 'were', 'kept', 'separate', 'filming', 'would', ""n't"", 'develop', 'rapport', 'other', 'actors', 'actors', 'were', 'unknowns', 'little-knowns', ""'re"", 'not', 'distracted', 'seeing', 'big', 'names', 'screen', 'However', 'thought', 'actors', 'showed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'anxiety', 'early', 'flight', 'problems', 'became', 'known.One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'well-captured', 'was', 'ordinariness', 'day', 'such', 'passengers', 'yakking', 'cell', 'phones', 'airport', 'waiting', 'area', 'spacing', 'out', 'safety', 'announcements', 'typical', 'pre-flight', 'prep', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'flight', 'movie', 'reminder', 'day', 'could', 'be', 'last', 'furthermore', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'emergency', 'where', 'must', 'make', 'life', 'death', 'decisions', 'do', 'best', 'whatever', 'materials', 'are', 'on-hand', 'incomplete', 'information.As', 'movie', 'United', '93', 'average', 'nothing', 'special', ""'ve"", 'added', 'star', 'movie', 'effort', 'cover', 'history', 'sensitive', 'manner', 'good', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'flight']",United 93

It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet.

I also read of some anti-Muslim backlash after people have seen this film.  Its semi-documentary style reminds me of the classic ""The Day of the Jackel"" based on the book by Frederick Forsyth.From the opening to the very end, I was filled with tension like I've rarely felt while watching any movie.  The movie opens with one of the hijackers reading the Quraan in a hotel room.  They didn't translate what he read, but the verse he read had something to do with the believers being rewarded in the afterlife.  All of the terrorists were making du'ah (supplications) throughout the film and these were authentic du'ah read in Arabic.  Some of the du'ah was translated.  I got the imprssion that all of the terrorists were very real and they truely believed that they would die as shihadis (martyrs).  All of the actors were real Arab Muslims who knew Islam, which made it shockingly authentic.  Even the people in the air traffic control centers looked and acted real.  They didn't appear to be supermen or a bunch of geniuses, but human beings who are prone to make mistakes and overlook things.  It appeared as if they did all that they could do given the circumstances.The troubling thing about this film is that I have no reason to complain about a negative portrayal of Islam or Muslims, because by all accounts this is mostly how things happened that day.  At the same time however, I really wish people would watch films like this with an open mind and not assume all Muslims are like the ones depicted in this film.  Interestningly, all of the terrorists except for the pilot spoke exclusively in Arabic (much of which was not translated) even to say things such as ""shut up"" or ""come here"".  I think this adds shock value because most of the people don't care what they were saying and it makes it easier for the audience to associate the Arabic Language with evil.You shouldn't associate the Arabic language, Islam, Muslim prayers and all Arabs with terrorism.

The usual gamut of Hollywood special effects was not needed to get the message across that this film intends to portray to the viewer. Also, the producers chose not to center on the blood and gore so common with most films these days! The story had enough within itself to provide all that was necessary.Secondly, no well-known actors were used in its production which makes the film even more realistic...The cast could have been the actual ones who boarded United 93 on 9/11.I went to the theatre to see this film when it was first released...Even though it was intense to say the least, the full impact of this production really didn't hit home until I bought the DVD and watched it half a dozen times...It had a certain magnetism that kept drawing me to search for more that I may have missed the time before!Although it didn't seem to do well at the box office, it will probably not be recognized for its true worth as is true with most things of value as compared to more well known productions! But make no mistake, this is one of the best films on the 9/11 attacks that you will ever see.Since there were no survivors, no one really knows verbatim what actually happened aboard United 93 that day...Everything we do know for sure was portrayed in an accurate and tasteful manner.

644186,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00005JOZI,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[6, 8]","Everybody remembers exactly where he was on September 11, 2001. I was taking a photojournalism course at the Defense Information School at Fort Meade, Maryland, and--ironically--taking part in an exercise on how military reporters should cover terrorist attacks. In fact, we were discussing the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and how, by the time the bombers came to trial, its significance had been buried because Americans' attention was diverted by the O. J. Simpson ""trial of the century."" At that moment, a Navy petty officer burst into the classroom and told our Air Force instructor to turn on the television--that the World Trade Center had just been struck by an airplane.We laughed in disbelief. As Army soldiers, being suddenly thrust by cadre into ""live"" training scenarios was old hat. We thought we were going to cover a ""terrorist event"" as a practical writing exercise. But, when the projector switched from the PowerPoint slideshow to the live ""Today"" show broadcast, we knew from the ominous visual of smoke pouring from the North Tower that this was no exercise.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, rumors abounded that Fort Meade was next, because the National Security Agency is located there. By day's end, I was standing outside our barracks, rifle in hand. I will never forget the emotions and thoughts that poured through me that day--revulsion, nausea, fear, anger, hatred. And finally, relief, because I had been spared the hell so cruelly inflicted on so many of my fellow Americans. As long as I live, I never want to relive that day. None of us do.Thus, when trailers for United 93 began screening in Los Angeles theaters shortly before its release, some in the audience wailed, ""Too soon! Too soon!""  Too soon? From the morning Imperial Japan attacked the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, until she surrendered in ignominious defeat on August 15, 1945, 1,348 days had passed. On April 28, 2006, United 93's opening day, 1,689 days of the War on Terror had gone by--almost a full year longer than America's involvement in World War II. Surely time enough has passed to allow us to reflect upon and honor those who died that day.Although Americans were generally familiar with the events that took place on United Airlines Flight 93, most of what we knew had been the subject of dry news reportage and ""what if"" conjecture. Now, culling transcripts of cockpit flight recorders, 9-1-1 emergency calls, interviews with surviving family members, and eyewitness accounts, writer and director Paul Greengrass has taken the threads of innumerable and seemingly random facts, and woven them into a powerful visual narrative.In United 93,Greengrass's masterful direction gives us the feeling that we are reliving September 11 all over again. He takes us from the flight's takeover by Muslim terrorists to the events on the ground as the World Trade Center and Pentagon are hit by the three other hijacked planes. He follows United 93's doomed course, in scenes inter-cutting between the airplane and the various air traffic control towers on the East Coast; he ends with the passengers retaking control of the plane from the hijackers, and its tragic crash in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania.By transforming my theater seat into a cramped seat in coach, as the forty-first passenger alongside those who would soon die on that hijacked flight from Newark, Flight 93 thrust the events in my face with visual and aural brutality, compelling me to relive that day--and to recall its lessons.Filming in ""real time,"" much like Fox TV's popular action series ""24,"" cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and his crew skillfully captured the action with handheld cameras. It's a method I usually eschew for its forced ""realism,"" but Ackroyd made it work by avoiding show-offish, unnecessary camera movement. By shooting mostly with telephoto lenses, he instills in viewers a sense of claustrophobia that heightens the emotional anxiety. John Powell's dark, percussion-laden soundtrack pummels the ears at rapid-fire tempo, ratcheting up the tension to cardiac arrest levels. Throughout the film, my own heart was racing, my brow was sweaty, and I got that same nauseous feeling in my gut that I so vividly remember from that day.When the end credits rolled, there was nothing but dead silence in the theater where I saw it. United 93 masterfully achieved its objective of re-creating onscreen the nightmare that Americans went through on September 11th.However, despite the fact that United 93 totally connected with me emotionally as a viewer, it suffers from the primary flaw of telling much of the story from the hijackers' point of view. The viewer learns more about what motivated them to take over the plane than he will ever find out about the private motives of the passengers, whose dialogue is rather threadbare. We know that through AirFone conversations with relatives, the passengers found out that hijacked planes had already hit New York and Washington, that their own flight therefore was doomed, and that this knowledge motivated them to wrest back control of the plane. But we never really find outwhat personally inspired each of them to their valorous actions. We never really get to know the Jeremy Glicks or Todd Beamers. I agree with those critics who have pointed that their dialogue should have been beefed up, and that these heroes should have been more clearly drawn.Yet I don't think Greengrass himself fully understands what compelled the onboard rebellion. In a recent interview, he explained his film's depiction of the American passengers:I suppose what I most wanted it to explore was the relationship between individual moments and collective will...You can't lead if the group's not there with the will, and vice versa. Where does leadership come from? It comes from the desire to be led...The order of the airplane was completely subverted...They seized control of the plane, pinned everybody in the back and they were in charge, and something happened in the course of 20-25 minutes...but you've always got that challenge of: what do you do when a bunch of people take over an airplane? You can't just sit there!While acknowledging and accurately depicting the American passengers' courage, the British director, it seems, hasn't begun to grasp the spirit of independence that most Americans still regard as their birthright. What induced these men and women to action could hardly be reduced simply to some group dynamic of a ""desire to be led""--remember, these were American, not German, passengers--but rather, embodied the individualistic, ""don't tread on me"" streak that fires us up when push comes to shove.Fortunately, Greengrass's detachment does not undermine the movie's strengths. One scene in particular captures what makes the American spirit so unique and indomitable. As the passengers start attacking the hijackers to take back the plane, a frightened Swedish passenger tries to block them, standing astride the aisle like a lunch hall monitor. ""Just do what they say,"" he lectures. ""Give in to their demands...co-operate, and we will be safe."" The Americans must shove the Swedish weenie aside in order to reach their attackers and regain control of the cockpit. I have yet to see a more succinct metaphor for European dithering and condescension as obstacles to righteous American action.Another critique--that United 93 is Politically Correct--is, I think, mostly unfounded. The movie makes no bones about distinguishing its villains from its heroes; it just does so without heavy-handed sloganeering, which would have wreckedthe taut, montage narrative structure. Composer Powell's menacing and foreboding passages, especially while the terrorists are praying, underscore their vicious brutality, just as upbeat, martial music accompanies scenes of Americans fighting back. Nor does the film disguise the facts that the hijackers were motivated by Islamism, or that the passengers took back the airplane to prevent its striking the U.S. Capitol, and, they hoped, to allow them to return safely to their loved ones.A year after September 11, I spotted a bumper sticker on a passing car while driving the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Next to an image of the American flag were printed these words: ""9/11: Remember. Rebuild. Recover."" I could not help but think that there was one ""R"" missing in that slogan. United 93 does a brilliant job in reminding us that on a Boeing 757, a group of heroic citizens taughtus the response befitting a free people in the face of wanton savagery--Revenge. And the film left me experiencing another ""R"" as well: Reverence for the memories of those heroes.Every American ought to invest two hours of his life in watching United 93, because it graphically depicts the inspiring acts, courage, and hope that helped spark the flames of direct action against Islamofascism. David Beamer, father of slain hero Todd Beamer, said of United 93: ""This film is a wake-up call. And although we abhor terrorism as a tactic, we are at war with a real enemy and it is personal.""No, it is not too soon for this movie. Rather, let us hope that it is not too late.",5,United They Fought Back,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,9166,"['Everybody', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'September', '11', '2001', 'was', 'taking',

There are no monologues or dramatizations to try to frame a message or tug at heart strings. No, this movie tries to tell as accurately as possible the tale of the passengers and crew of Flight 93, the airliner hijacked by the death-worshippers of Osama on September 11th, 2001. It tells the story not in long scenes or made-up dialog but by snatches of conversations amongst the passengers and by showing the story on the ground, at Air Traffic Control NYC and NORAD's local sector command center.The people on that plane could have been any of us... they were just ordinary housewives, business men, retirees. They didn't ask or deserve to be placed in harm's way but it is the nature of terrorist to strike at those who have no reason to fear. Yet, when it became obvious that the terrorists had no intention of holding the passengers hostage or even of landing the aircraft the passengers fought back. They became heroes the same way many people become heroes... they overcome their fear to do what had to be done. They saved many lives that day, no one can guess how many.

If you saw it happening on television LIVE, you were glued to the television set.Four airplanes were hi-jacked in the same morning.At 8:46am, American Airlines Flight 11 (From Boston via LAX) deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.At 9:02am, United Airlines Flight 175 (From Boston via LAX) deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.At 9:37am, American Airlines Flight 77 (From Virginia via LAX) deliberately crashed into The Pentagon.At 9:59am, The South Tower completely collapsed to the ground.Meanwhile, the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93 was in flight from Newark to San Francisco. It was hi-jacked too. The hijackers made a flight attendant knock on the door for the pilots to open the door. The hijackers took the pilots down. One hijacker took over flying the plane.Some of the terrified male passengers got together and decided to do the most bravest act. It was their last hope. They were going to take down the hijackers all at once.We all know what happened later as it crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.They say this plane may have been intended to crash into the Capitol or The White House in Washington DC.This movie is to honor the pilots, flight attendants and passengers who perished and to honor those in the control rooms who tried their damndest.This movie is their story.Cast: Opal Alladin, David Alan Basche, Ray Charleson, Peter Hermann, Joe Jamrog, Christian Clemenson, Polly Adams, Trish Gates, Denny Dillion, Gregg Henry.Appearing as themselves: Ben Sliney, Tobin Miller, Rich Sullivan, Tony Smith, Major James Fox, Sarah Fox, Jeremy Powell, Rick Tepper, Greg Callahan, Curt Applegate, Thomas Roberts.Those who portrayed the pilot and flight attendants are actually pilots and flight attendants, some who actually have worked for United Airlines.

644191,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B00005JOZI,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[3, 5]","United 93 is a unique film in that it employs a large cast of unrecognizable actors.  This is a smart choice since the specific tale of United flight 93 revolves largely around the everyday people aboard it and those trying to save it.  To cast Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts or Nicholas Cage as the singular focal point of the film would undermine the film's entire purpose.  United 93 afterall, is not a story of one, but of many.United 93 is a film that defies genre.  It is not quite a documentary, not quite a drama, but a little of both.  It is at once riveting, chilling and often very hard to watch.  During the course of viewing the feelings of confusion and helplessness I felt that tragic day came washing back in an all too familiar way.  For recreating that, the film deserves great praise.  It's well worth the watch and is surprisingly bolstered by, not hurt by the fact that we know what will happen.Yet I have to say the film is missing something that prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars.  Perhaps it's a lack of story closure.  Indeed, as a study of human behavior during times of stress, confusion and sheer trauma, United 93 works quite well.  It remains quite neutral and avoids passing judgment on any of the players in the events of that day.  But as the film builds to the crescendo, it falls somewhat flat at this most critical juncture.  When the credits roll the viewer is left more with a feeling of incompleteness and yearning for a statement of any kind that the film might have made.  Of course I realize that we don't have full closure on the events of 9/11 as a nation either.  But as a story it seems that United 93 could have taken the film one step further to give a bit more poigniance to the machinations of a tale we already know too well.",4,"Chilling, Riveting But Is Still Missing Something...",1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1779,"['United', '93', 'unique', 'film', 'large', 'cast', 'unrecognizable', 'actors', 'smart', 'choice', 'specific', 'tale', 'United', 'flight', '93', 'revolves', 'largely', 'everyday', 'people', 'trying', 'save', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'singular', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'would', 'undermine', 'film', 'entire', 'purpose', 'United', '93', 'afterall', 'not', 'story', 'one', 'many.United', '93', 'film', 'genre', 'not', 'quite', 'documentary', 'not', 'quite', 'drama', 'little', 'once', 'riveting', 'chilling', 'often', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'course', 'viewing', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'helplessness', 'felt', 'tragic', 'day', 'came', 'washing', 'back', 'too', 'familiar', 'way', 'recreating', 'film', 'great', 'praise', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'surprisingly', 'bolstered', 'not', 'hurt', 'fact', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen.Yet', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'missing', 'something', 'giving', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'story', 'closure', 'Indeed', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'times', 'stress', 'confusion', 'sheer', 'trauma', 'United', '93', 'quite', 'well', 'quite', 'neutral', 'avoids', 'passing', 'judgment', 'players', 'events', 'day', 'film', 'crescendo', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'most', 'critical', 'juncture', 'When', 'credits', 'roll', 'viewer', 'left', 'more', 'feeling', 'incompleteness', 'yearning', 'statement', 'kind', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'course', 'realize', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'closure', 'events', '9/11', 'nation', 'either', 'story', 'United', '93', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'poigniance', 'machinations', 'tale', 'already', 'know', 'too', 'well']",United 93
644192,A10H47FMW8NHII,B00005JOZI,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","Of the four passenger jets hijacked on 9/11, United Flight 93 is the only one that didn't reach its target. This was due to the heroism of its passengers who learned about the other hijackings and the hits to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon via phone calls to loved ones after their own plane was commandeered. When they realized that they were to be used as a bomb, they took matters into their own hands. The events depicted are drawn from numerous phone calls made to friends, families and associates during the hijacking.As a former pilot, I personally prefer the footage that shows the confusion, the consternation, and ultimately the incredulity of the stunned people who manned the control towers, the flight service centers and the FAA, along with the U.S. military. Amid mounting chaos, those guys managed to land every commercial aircraft in United States airspace (approximately 4200) in just under three hours, an unprecedented action done with blinding speed and total safety. The hijacked planes had their transponders turned off so any plane still in the air would be an enemy.From the extras on the DVD (from Amazon.com), I know the actors actually called upon the families of the victims they portrayed, saw their homes, met their families and heard their voices from phone messages left just before they died. The actors are remarkably authentic in their portrayals. In addition, a number of the air traffic control officials who were on duty that morning portray themselves in the film.I had avoided seeing this when it was first released, but Seattle stage actor Cheyenne Jackson was cast as Mark Bingham, one of the heroic passengers, so naturally I wanted to see ""our guy"" on the silver screen.I'm glad I did.",4,Everyday Heroes,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1739,"['four', 'passenger', 'jets', 'hijacked', '9/11', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'only', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'target', 'was', 'due', 'heroism', 'passengers', 'who', 'learned', 'other', 'hijackings', 'hits', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'phone', 'calls', 'loved', 'ones', 'own', 'plane', 'was', 'commandeered', 'When', 'realized', 'were', 'be', 'used', 'bomb', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'events', 'depicted', 'are', 'drawn', 'numerous', 'phone', 'calls', 'made', 'friends', 'families', 'associates', 'hijacking.As', 'former', 'pilot', 'personally', 'prefer', 'footage', 'confusion', 'consternation', 'ultimately', 'incredulity', 'stunned', 'people', 'who', 'manned', 'control', 'towers', 'flight', 'service', 'centers', 'FAA', 'U.S.', 'military', 'Amid', 'mounting', 'chaos', 'guys', 'managed', 'land', 'commercial', 'aircraft', 'United', 'States', 'airspace', 'approximately', '4200', 'just', 'three', 'hours', 'unprecedented', 'action', 'done', 'blinding', 'speed', 'total', 'safety', 'hijacked', 'planes', 'had', 'transponders', 'turned', 'off', 'plane', 'still', 'air', 'would', 'be', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com', 'know', 'actors', 'actually', 'called', 'families', 'victims', 'portrayed', 'saw', 'homes', 'met', 'families', 'heard', 'voices', 'phone', 'messages', 'left', 'just', 'died', 'actors', 'are', 'remarkably', 'authentic', 'portrayals', 'addition', 'number', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'officials', 'who', 'were', 'duty', 'morning', 'portray', 'film.I', 'had', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Seattle', 'stage', 'actor', 'Cheyenne', 'Jackson', 'was', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Bingham', 'one', 'heroic', 'passengers', 'naturally', 'wanted', 'see', 'guy', 'silver', 'screen.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did']",United 93

I know the film was carefully scripted and blocked, but the sense you get is of the confusion and lack of coordination on the ground from men and women trying their best to grapple with a situation they were not prepared for. On the plane, each passenger is lovingly recreated by actors, though there is no attempt to exactly replicate situations or conversations. Even the hijackers were given realistic personalities, being jumpy, nervous and menacing as the occasion demanded.The bonus materials were great, with interviews where family members told of their loved ones and got to meet the actors playing them.If it didn't happen this way, it was pretty darned close.",5,Sensitive anatomy of a tragedy,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,931,"['Using', 'naturalistic', 'language', 'dearth', 'narrative', 'tricks', 'foreshadowing', 'United', '93', 'how', '9/11', 'developed', 'POV', 'hijackers', 'passengers', 'plane', 'flight', 'controllers', 'military', 'personnel', 'trying', 'get', 'fighters', 'air', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'carefully', 'scripted', 'blocked', 'sense', 'get', 'confusion', 'lack', 'coordination', 'ground', 'men', 'women', 'trying', 'best', 'grapple', 'situation', 'were', 'not', 'prepared', 'plane', 'passenger', 'lovingly', 'recreated', 'actors', 'attempt', 'exactly', 'replicate', 'situations', 'conversations', 'Even', 'hijackers', 'were', 'given', 'realistic', 'personalities', 'being', 'jumpy', 'nervous', 'menacing', 'occasion', 'bonus', 'materials', 'were', 'great', 'interviews', 'where', 'family', 'members', 'told', 'loved', 'ones', 'got', 'meet', 'actors', 'playing', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'was', 'pretty', 'darned', 'close']",United 93
644196,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JOZI,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[12, 14]","Director Paul Greengrass brings the story of United flight 93 to life in this fitting tribute to the heroes aboard the flight who refused to go quietly.  On September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by middle eastern terrorists.  Two of the planes were flown into the World Trade Center, one hit the Pentagon, and the fourth, flight 93, was destined for another target, most likely the White House or the U.S. Capitol, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the flight never reached its intended target.This move shows all aspects of that terrible day in September.  From the opening scenes of the terrorists preparing themselves for death to the scenes in the confused and hectic air control rooms, this film revisits one of the darkest days in our history.The story of flight 93 is inspiring and serves as a beacon of light which continues to shine today for those who remember 9/11.  The depiction of the flight in the movie is very good.  The movie begins with the passengers and crew boarding the aircraft for what initially appeared to be a normal flight from Newark to San Fransisco.  However, in the control rooms across the country, a much different story was unfolding.  One of the controllers reported hearing screams and foreign voices from one of the planes.  This turned out to be United flight 11.  The controllers cointinued to monitor the flight until, mysteriously, the plane disappeared from the screen.  This was the first plane to hit the World Trade Center.Meanwhile, aboard flight 93, the four terrorists sprung their own hijacking.  Using a homemade bomb (which was really fake) and box cutters, the terrorists managed to gain entrance into the cockpit and contol of the plane.  Immediately, the terrorists turned the plane around and began heading back east.  Several passenegrs, including the pilot and co-pilot, were stabbed by the terrorists.  Some of the passengers began making cell phone calls to loved ones on the ground, and in the process, they learned about the attacks on the WTC.  Realizing that their plane was probably going to be used in the same way as the ones which struck the WTC, the passengers began to formulate a plan to re-take the plane from the terrorists.  Despite the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the plane crashed in western Pennsylvania, about 10 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C.  No one survived.This movie serves as  a stirring tribute to those heroic souls who banded together and fought to save not only themselves, but perhaps hundreds of others as well.  I was impressed with the coverage of the air traffic controllers and how they struggled with handling the hijackings.  It was both amazing and somewhat heart-wrenching seeing these dedicated people doing their best to ensure the safety of the people aboard the hijacked planes.The acting in the movie is very good.  Christian Clemenson (Tom Burnett), Cheyenne Jackson (Mark Bingham), David Alan Basche (Todd Beamer), and Peter Hermann (Jeremy Glick) give performances worthy of their characters' names. The other actors, especially the air traffic controllers, give rousing performances, also. The story is told with realism, but the viewer gets a sense of compassion as well.I highly recommend this heroic story about forty people who sat down as strangers, but stood up as one.  This movie honors the memory of the fallen with dignity and grace, and their story of heroism in the face of certain death should serve as a message to everyone.  Watch this fine movie and see how forty ordinary people banded together as one.",5,The Ultimate Heroes,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,3603,"['Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'story', 'United', 'flight', '93', 'life', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'heroes', 'flight', 'who', 'refused', 'go', 'quietly', 'September', '11', '2001', 'four', 'commercial', 'airliners', 'were', 'hijacked', 'middle', 'eastern', 'terrorists', 'Two', 'planes', 'were', 'flown', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'one', 'hit', 'Pentagon', 'fourth', 'flight', '93', 'was', 'destined', 'target', 'most', 'likely', 'White', 'House', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'thanks', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'passengers', 'crew', 'flight', 'never', 'reached', 'intended', 'target.This', 'move', 'aspects', 'terrible', 'day', 'September', 'opening', 'scenes', 'terrorists', 'preparing', 'death', 'scenes', 'confused', 'hectic', 'air', 'control', 'rooms', 'film', 'one', 'darkest', 'days', 'history.The', 'story', 'flight', '93', 'inspiring', 'serves', 'beacon', 'light', 'shine', 'today', 'who', 'remember', '9/11', 'depiction', 'flight', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'passengers', 'crew', 'boarding', 'aircraft', 'what', 'initially', 'appeared', 'be', 'normal', 'flight', 'Newark', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'However', 'control', 'rooms', 'country', 'much', 'different', 'story', 'was', 'unfolding', 'One', 'controllers', 'reported', 'hearing', 'screams', 'foreign', 'voices', 'one', 'planes', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'United', 'flight', '11', 'controllers', 'cointinued', 'monitor', 'flight', 'mysteriously', 'plane', 'disappeared', 'screen', 'was', 'first', 'plane', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center.Meanwhile', 'aboard', 'flight', '93', 'four', 'terrorists', 'sprung', 'own', 'hijacking', 'Using', 'homemade', 'bomb', 'was', 'really', 'fake', 'box', 'cutters', 'terrorists', 'managed', 'gain', 'entrance', 'cockpit', 'contol', 'plane', 'Immediately', 'terrorists', 'turned', 'plane', 'around', 'began', 'heading', 'back', 'east', 'Several', 'passenegrs', 'including', 'pilot', 'co-pilot', 'were', 'stabbed', 'terrorists', 'passengers', 'began', 'making', 'cell', 'phone', 'loved', 'ones', 'ground', 'process', 'learned', 'attacks', 'WTC', 'Realizing', 'plane', 'was', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'used', 'same', 'way', 'ones', 'struck', 'WTC', 'passengers', 'began', 'formulate', 'plan', 're-take', 'plane', 'terrorists', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'passengers', 'crew', 'plane', 'crashed', 'western', 'Pennsylvania', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'flying', 'time', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'No', 'one', 'survived.This', 'movie', 'stirring', 'tribute', 'heroic', 'souls', 'who', 'banded', 'together', 'fought', 'save', 'not', 'only', 'perhaps', 'hundreds', 'others', 'well', 'was', 'impressed', 'coverage', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'how', 'struggled', 'handling', 'hijackings', 'was', 'amazing', 'somewhat', 'heart-wrenching', 'seeing', 'dedicated', 'people', 'doing', 'best', 'ensure', 'safety', 'people', 'hijacked', 'planes.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'Christian', 'Clemenson', 'Tom', 'Burnett', 'Cheyenne', 'Jackson', 'Mark', 'Bingham', 'David', 'Alan', 'Basche', 'Todd', 'Beamer', 'Peter', 'Hermann', 'Jeremy', 'Glick', 'give', 'performances', 'worthy', 'characters', 'names', 'other', 'actors', 'especially', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'give', 'rousing', 'performances', 'also', 'story', 'told', 'realism', 'viewer', 'sense', 'compassion', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'heroic', 'story', 'forty', 'people', 'who', 'sat', 'down', 'strangers', 'stood', 'up', 'one', 'movie', 'memory', 'fallen', 'dignity', 'grace', 'story', 'heroism', 'face', 'certain', 'death', 'should', 'serve', 'message', 'everyone', 'Watch', 'fine', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'forty', 'ordinary', 'people', 'banded', 'together', 'one']",United 93

I know very few people who have taken time to watch it because 9-11 evokes such visceral memories. I lost a childhood friend on this day and so each year his memories surface and I find it a hard day to go through when I think about my friend and then the greater tragedy and how our country changed forever. That said, UNITED 93 is respectful of those who lost their lives on that dreaded day and it honors the brave men and women on this flight who truly were heroes by preventing the final attack from reaching its appointed target. Greengrass' direction is amazingly tight and never allows the film to become overly dramatic. He deftly cuts between the air traffic controllers responding to the initial crashes and the passengers and crew taking their places on United's flght, always capturing the extraordinary ordinariness of people simply making their way in the world and responding to an unfolding crisis without fanfare. However, it's the film's final passage when the terrorists take over Flight 93 that Greengrass' masterful work truly reveals itself as you are on that flight for good until it ends. I literally crawled up the back of my couch in terror and really wanted to just run from the room--and then it made me truly understand the depth of bravery of everyone on board that flight. They did not run, they faced the evil on board with steadfast resolve to not let a bunch of scum take down our nation any further. It's a testament to Greengrass for making a film that honors and celebrates the spirit of those 40 men and women, who truly personify a level of patriotism that very few may ever display in their lifetime. The film is simply brilliant on disc and technically flawless. And each actor--even those who played the evil men--is nothing short of fantastic. I don't know that I would revisit this film any time soon, but it did inspire me to become a major donor to the Flight 93 memorial. If you've never seen it, please make a point to check it out.

We are a brave and autonomous people, and we have a lot to be proud of.My personal conclusion, aside from deep sorrow and deep admiration for the heroes of this movie, is that each of us is marked by how we treat other people.I liked the film, even though I would not call it a great accomplishment.

644206,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00005JOZI,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[9, 11]","I spent a great deal of time over the past 5 years since 9/11 speculating about what might have happened on the United 93 flight after the passengers found out about the morning's events.  Mostly, I questioned whether I would have had the courage to take action as some of the passengers evidently did, or if I would have cowered in a corner, a snivelling coward waiting to die and crying quick and hot tears over a life not lived to its fullest.Among the many emotional responses I had to this electrifying film when I saw it in a shamefully empty theatre the day it came out, ""United 93"" made me face that question again in a very aggressive and in-your-face way.  This isn't just a story of tragic events.  It is a story of human character.Equally terrified during the day's events were the various civilian and military airline control center employees.  Forced to act quickly and decisively when dealing with partial facts and a rapidly-unfolding terror timeclock, they were having to take action while the vast majority of people in the world were standing around dumbstruck and speechless.""United 93"" covers the day's events in docudrama style from multiple agencies' perspectives and every single one of them draws you in and grabs you by the throat.I could hear people in the theatre stop breathing several times.  There was more than a little crying.Much was made in the press about how it may have been ""too soon"" to tell this story again in such a frank and brutally honest way.  Well guess what -- it some ways it will ALWAYS be too soon, but that doesn't mean the story shouldn't be told.  We all need to watch this to remind ourselves of how it felt to be so scared and emotionally raw.  Don't wait until you've let Time numb you to the day's events.This movie works on every level it intended to.  The fact that it is both difficult to sit through and impossible to turn away from is a testament to not only the powerful nature of the events themselves but also to the filmmakers' unflinching and honest presentation of them.This could have been a sappy melodramatic TV movie that pulled punches and glossed over painful details.  Instead, this film feels more ""real"" than any film in recent memory.When you watch it at home, please maximize the impact of the experience by recreating the Theatrical experience as best you can:  Turn off all the lights, unplug the phone, go the bathroom in advance, and keep the chatter down.This is too important an experience to treat like just another Weekday Night on the Couch.**** In spite of the fact that I am more convinced with each passing day that the conspiracy theorists about 9/11 may actually be telling the ugly truth, I still will re-iterate that ""United 93"" is a stunningly powerful work of dramatic cinema.  Whether the significant details are even remotely true or not, it doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the story as told by this film.

644208,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00005JOZI,Jonathan Appleseed,"[4, 5]","Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) brings us United 93, a real-time rendering of the events that happened on one of the most fateful days of our lifetime. We first meet the four young men who hijacked the flight, then are introduced to the passengers on the plane, air traffic controllers, the FAA, and a military command center. The first portion of the film centers on the first three hijacked planes on 9/11; we watch, impossibly, as the FAA, air traffic controllers, and the military try and respond to a threat that literally appeared out of nowhere, and the difficult, time-sensitive decisions that needed to be made. It certainly gives one pause to think: what would *I* do if faced with such a catastrophe? When the focus switches to United 93, the film gathers considerable momentum. Although there is a relatively large ""cast"", Greengrass does an enviable job humanizing all of them. It would have been easy to sweep over each person and create a character that was close to the original but still clich&eacute;d, or worse yet caricaturized. In less skilled hands, this may have happened. But Greengrass obviously did his research, learned as much as he could about the people on that plane, and brought them to life in short time. That's not easy to do.Greengrass deserves further commendation for constraint. It would have been easy to turn this into a melodramatic affair, but instead he merely dramatized. He showed us the events as they took place, he showed us the passenger's emotions, and asked us to respond. And we responded! How could we not cheer as the passengers began their revolt? Rejoice at their bravery when they broke into the cockpit and wrested away control of the plane? Cry when we spied in on passenger's conversations with family and loved ones, especially knowing that Greengrass researched the passenger's lives extensively and that the conversations were more likely than not accurately depicted.This is a review of the DVD, and it gets extra high marks from me for the Bonus Features, particularly the interviews with family members. First, they were subtitled, which is sadly still a rarity (I'm hearing impaired, so miss out on most of the bonus/special features); most importantly, though, they reminded us that these were all real people. Next door neighbors. Friends. Co-workers. Brothers, sisters, uncles, parents.The passengers of United 93 deserve a standing ovation from all of us.

It seems like I spend half my life on airplanes and in airports, and it was easier to credit the Flight 93 passengers for what they did -- which was the definition of courage -- without thinking too much about what it might have been like. Part of me was worried about what Hollywood might do to embellish the truth. You just cannot add anything -- SHOULD not add anything.I finally rented it and I don't think I've ever been so immersed in a film. Even knowing the ending, watching the mundane airport scenes unfold put my stomach in knots. Watching the planes disappear on radar as they hit the World Trade Center, just quietly fading from the screen, is otherwordly. There's a sense of powerlessness and anger throughout the film, especially in the air traffic control scenes. It feels very real time, and in a way it gives us a chance to sort through the feelings that we had on that day. I couldn't move when I was watching it.The realism of the film, and the pacing, make it extraordinary. Thankfully, we're spared the gratuitous gore and melodrama that studios serve up in seemingly every other film. This is disturbing, but very respectful.I don't know if I would watch it more than once. United 93 is an outstanding film, and the final moments will fill you with incredible pride in, and respect for, the passengers and crew.But the reality of it makes it hard to regard as entertainment, and in fact you can't watch it passively. It's part of all of us, and we're not watching a bunch of movie stars. Any of us could have been there. You can't escape that nagging feeling, and that makes United 93 positively frightening.The film forces you to look inside yourself. What would I have done? What would you have done? How would you have used your final phone call in a plunging airplane?I think everyone should see this film once. That's enough to stay with you forever.I echo the reviewer's sentiment in hoping that the families of the passengers who fought back on United 93 regard this as a tribute to their heroism.

644216,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JOZI,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","On September 11th, 2001, our nation was changed forever. Terrorists from overseas came to our land and dealt us with a devastating blow, attacking the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As the terrorists thought we were down for the count, we did what we've done so many times before, we came back stronger and paid them back in full, and are continuing to do so through the war on terror. In 2006, two films were released that chronicled certain events from that day, one was Oliver Stone's (""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Alexander"") heartfelt tribute to the rescue efforts at Ground Zero in ""World Trade Center"", and the other was the documentary-style ""United 93"" from director Paul Greengrass (""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum""). The latter of which is the film that I will be discussing here.""United 93"" tells the powerful story of the passengers aboard the last hijacked flight who thwarted the terrorists from delivering another deadly blow to our country. As 3 hijacked planes had hit their intended targets, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane landed in a field, unsuccessfully finding its target. On that tragic morning it seemed as if nothing could stop the terrorist plot, but as the passengers aboard flight 93, via cell phone conversations with loved ones, were quickly learning of what had been transpiring on the ground, they knew they had to do something. Because the only way their flight wasn't going to be turned into another deadly weapon was for them to rise up as one, and fight back!Many people felt that even after 5 years, it was still too soon to chronicle the events of that tragic day on film. Some even thought that the events should never be put to film, because for some the wound would never heal. For those people I have nothing but sympathy for them, and I completely understand why they would not want to see this film, or ""World Trade Center"". However, for the rest of us, I believe that this film and it's counterpart serve as chilling reminders of that day, of what evil actually lurks around in our world, but also of the incredible courage and indomitable will of the American spirit.With ""United 93"", acclaimed director Paul Greengrass, serving as both writer and director for the film, has crafted a very moving, incredibly realistic account of what may have transpired aboard that flight. Many of the scenes were based on cell phone conversations between the passengers and their relatives, what was heard on the cockpit recordings, and the rest was based on family members descriptions of what their loved ones were like throughout their lives. Compiling all of these elements together, Greengrass has made ""United 93"" into a film that honors those brave souls that sat down as strangers and stood up as one.Assisting Greengrass in honoring those victims of 9/11, was a cast of extremely talented, yet unknown actors and actresses that were given the unenviable task of playing these people in this highly emotional time, and not disrespecting their memory or their surviving families. Even though the actors/actresses were not a who's-who of Hollywood, they all handled each of their parts just as good as any A-lister, delivering such heartfelt emotion and depth in every performance. A truly magnificent job on all of their parts, I honestly believe that they did an exemplary job of honoring the memory of the people they were portraying.I know that many of the families of the victims of that day may never see this movie, but should they ever see it, I believe that they will be honored by the performances of the actors, and the very realistic and moving film that Paul Greengrass has assembled. For those of you out there that feel you don't need to see this movie to remember that day, I understand you viewpoint, but I truly believe you should one day choose to watch this film so that you can remember that even in our darkest hour, there are those who will choose to be heroes.""United 93"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,"They Sat Down As Strangers, But Stood Up As One...",1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,4036,"['September', '11th', '2001', 'nation', 'was', 'changed', 'forever', 'Terrorists', 'overseas', 'came', 'land', 'dealt', 'devastating', 'blow', 'attacking', 'twin', 'towers', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'terrorists', 'thought', 'were', 'down', 'count', 'did', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'came', 'back', 'stronger', 'paid', 'back', 'full', 'are', 'continuing', 'do', 'so', 'war', 'terror', '2006', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'chronicled', 'certain', 'events', 'day', 'one', 'was', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'Alexander', 'heartfelt', 'tribute', 'rescue', 'efforts', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'other', 'was', 'documentary-style', 'United', '93', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'latter', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'discussing', 'here', 'United', '93', 'powerful', 'story', 'passengers', 'last', 'hijacked', 'flight', 'who', 'thwarted', 'terrorists', 'delivering', 'deadly', 'blow', 'country', '3', 'hijacked', 'planes', 'had', 'hit', 'intended', 'targets', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'fourth', 'plane', 'landed', 'field', 'unsuccessfully', 'finding', 'target', 'tragic', 'morning', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'could', 'stop', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'passengers', 'flight', '93', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversations', 'loved', 'ones', 'were', 'quickly', 'learning', 'had', 'been', 'transpiring', 'ground', 'knew', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'only', 'way', 'flight', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'turned', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'was', 'rise', 'up', 'one', 'fight', 'back', 'Many', 'people', 'felt', 'even', '5', 'years', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'soon', 'chronicle', 'events', 'tragic', 'day', 'film', 'even', 'thought', 'events', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'put', 'film', 'wound', 'would', 'never', 'heal', 'people', 'have', 'nothing', 'sympathy', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'However', 'rest', 'believe', 'film', 'counterpart', 'serve', 'chilling', 'reminders', 'day', 'what', 'evil', 'actually', 'lurks', 'world', 'also', 'incredible', 'courage', 'indomitable', 'will', 'American', 'spirit.With', 'United', '93', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'serving', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'crafted', 'very', 'moving', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'account', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'transpired', 'flight', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'based', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversations', 'passengers', 'relatives', 'what', 'was', 'heard', 'cockpit', 'recordings', 'rest', 'was', 'based', 'family', 'members', 'descriptions', 'what', 'loved', 'ones', 'were', 'lives', 'Compiling', 'elements', 'together', 'Greengrass', 'made', 'United', '93', 'film', 'honors', 'brave', 'souls', 'sat', 'down', 'strangers', 'stood', 'up', 'one.Assisting', 'Greengrass', 'honoring', 'victims', '9/11', 'was', 'cast', 'extremely', 'talented', 'yet', 'unknown', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'given', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'people', 'highly', 'emotional', 'time', 'not', 'disrespecting', 'memory', 'surviving', 'families', 'Even', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'not', ""who's-who"", 'Hollywood', 'handled', 'parts', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'A-lister', 'delivering', 'such', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'depth', 'performance', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'job', 'parts', 'honestly', 'believe', 'did', 'exemplary', 'job', 'honoring', 'memory', 'people', 'were', 'portraying.I', 'know', 'many', 'families', 'victims', 'day', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'should', 'ever', 'see', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'honored', 'performances', 'actors', 'very', 'realistic', 'moving', 'film', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'assembled', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'remember', 'day', 'understand', 'viewpoint', 'truly', 'believe', 'should', 'one', 'day', 'choose', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'can', 'remember', 'even', 'darkest', 'hour', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'choose', 'be', 'heroes', 'United', '93', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",United 93

644219,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JOZI,Kaya Savas,"[35, 38]","MOVIE: Film, the most powerful form of expression. Paul Greengrass' United 93 was one of the most moving, terrifying, emotional, and profound movie-going experiences in my life. The film tells the tragic tale of flight 93, the only hijacked plane that never made its target. Historical accounts presented through film are a different type of viewing experience in that we the audience know the outcome. When I watch films like Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, Schindler's List, Platoon, and other historical films I am experiencing these events for the first time. I was born in 1987, so I never lived through a great war, never experienced one firsthand even though my generation is in the middle of one right now. Sepetember 11th affected all of us, whether we lost someone or not. This is the first film that current generations will experience as a recounting of a tragic event that we lived through. We watched the towers fall, the people jump from hundreds of stories above the concrete jungle. Now Paul Greengrass brings an intimate and very real look into the lives of a few strangers who decided not to sit back and stay quiet. The film sets the tone immediately as it opens a beautiful sunny day as people arrive at the airport, talking on their phones, reading the paper, and getting ready for their flights. We never learn the names of any of the people in the movie, and all of the actors were cast as ""no name"" actors. It was done for the sole reason of not to exploit this event, and to make it seem as realistic as possible. The film uses parallel editing and jumps back and forth to the unfolding events in the plane and the events in the various control rooms of the military and air traffic control. Greengrass' style is shakey documentary style filmmaking, and those who saw The Bourne Supremacy can recall that. This style works to perfection, and creates a sense of chaos and confusion in the control rooms where 50 people are running around trying to comprehend what happened. They turn on CNN to see one of the towers in flames, later they witness the second plane hitting the next tower. Silence falls, and as I sat in my seat I began to tremble with my eyes beginning to water. We jump back to the plane where Greengrass places the camera as if it were the point of view of one of the passangers. All these passengers are strangers to each other, so they are strangers to the audience. The scenes on the airplane are terrifying, and will grip you and shake you at your core. The fear and the terror feels too real, I was so concentrated as I watched this film because it was so captivating and involving, and the only thing I can say to express my feelings is to quote one of the flight attendents on the plane, ""I don't want to be here"". The film is important, it's important because it brings new light to something so familiar. Is it too soon though? At first I thought so, but I realize now that it's not too soon at all. It still feels like it was yesterday that I watched the towers fall and the cloud of dust engulf New York City, images like that do not fade. So even 20 years from now people would still be saying it's too soon. The film doesn't deal with politics and is all about the courageous people who did the bravest thing any human being could do, and that is sacrifice their lives. Every American needs to see this film, it has to be seen no matter how uncomfortable it will make you feel. I watch movies like Saving Private Ryan to experience the past, in 20 years people my age will be doing the same with United 93. I am writing this review 4 hours after I saw the film, and I am still shaken by it. It feels like it happened all over again, but you know, it was worth it.ACTING: You won't be able to name any actors in this film, and it was casted like that for a purpose. If I was a WWII veteran and I watched Saving Private Ryan, I would probably say ""That's Tom Hanks, he's an actor, he didn't fight in WWII"". In this film you can't name any actor, and that makes it all the more real and you end up forgetting that you are watching a movie. The acting is superb, it's what drove the film. It must have been uncomfortable to film some of these scenes, the terror is genuinely real.BOTTOM LINE: ""Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night.

644221,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,B00005JOZI,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[3, 4]","Like many, I waited a good long time to see this film.  Not only was I worried about reliving the horror of 9/11 in any form again, but I was squeamish about how it would be handled, perhaps especially by a director who was not from the US himself.  Would it be a ""Blame America"" affair?  A political affair in general, either of which, I believe, would have detracted from the story of that day itself, when we had no idea of the suffering the people aboard the four planes driven to the ground and those in the Pentagon and WTC were about to undergo?Not only was I relieved, but I feel I've undergone a film class watching Mr. Greenglass' oeuvre, one on how to use the ordinary sounds and sights of what might occur on a simple business trip to show how these ordinary people went from living a normal life to taking an incredibly heroic action that might have saved many more lives90, perhaps 95% of the film takes place in the body of the airplane, in the aisle.  The flight attendants (many played by actual flight attendants) play a large role.  Shots are taken down the aisle to show the terorists in first class, sometimes sitting quietly, sometimes nervous and sweating, sometimes arguing with each other in Arabic about when is the right time to strike; and up to show the other passengers in first and coach.  Except for two of the terrorists, and the flight attendants, Greenglass has chosen not to name the passengers.  If you know the story well you will be able to recognize Todd Beamer and possibly wildlife refuge supervisor Richard Guadagno by their dialogue with others, but that's about it.Other scenes are limited to aircraft control and military centers, where immediately after we learn American Airlines 11 has been hijacked, it is clear no one, anywhere, is sure what to do, and who is in charge....and throughout the course of the film, military personnel never are sure they have permission to shoot anything down, even after all commercial airlines are grounded, even if they know an airline is being hijacked. To me, these scenes gave me more chills than anything occuring on the United flight.The choice to use actual flight attendants, flight controllers, and military personell where possible enhanced understatement and lack of hyperdrama  and  worked beautifully.  The interaction, mood, and emotional intensity was high but believable on the ground and the sense of panic is palpable without being histrionic.Of course, no one knows exactly what went on in that big aluminum tube; Greenglass extrapolated a lot between knowing passengers told loved ones during phone calls that they were going to storm the cockpit, and that the plane crashed into the ground, not into any American landmark.  So he used some artistic license to sketch what one presumes he likes about Americans, and why they chose this ending (after all, it was their choice) over several others.  One device is a German passenger who insists on a different way.  He is unceremoniously vetoed.Not that this is a xenophobic or should be seen as ""America's way and America's way only"" film.  As noted above, one must squirm to see the lack of communication  between the various flight agencies, the military, and other branches of government.  Nor is the film anti-Muslim or anti-Arabic, or does it suggest in any way that all Muslims or Arabs are terrorists (although it doesn't shy away from portraying the terrorists themselves as murderers). It is simply a film which shows us what began as an ordinary day, where a handful of people, who happened to be Americans, encountered the face of evil, and how they dealt with it.  This scenario has happened in real life over and over in the Middle East, and now in London,  Madrid, and Beslan, and Moscow.  Tomorrow, who knows?  It could be Berlin, or Buenes Aires.

This is exquisite filmaking about the toughest day in our history for many Americans. Shot in documentary style with no star power but solid acting all around. Paul Greengrass respectfully chronicles the last flight of United 93 as passengers and crew arrive and terroists prep themselves for their mission. Knowing what will happen and watching the events unfold was riveting. I felt myself unable to move. It's gutwrenching at times especially as flight controllers watch the towers get hit right across the river from them. The crew and passengers of United 93 turn from passengers to heroes as they become aware of what's going on and that other flights have been rammed into the towers and the pentagon. That American can-do spirit leaves you feeling that we can overcome any horrible terror by coming together. An unbelievable movie experience.

Loria,"[196, 222]","September 11th 2001, 4 planes were hijacked, 3 of them reached their targets, UNITED 93 is the story of the forth.JFK said ""We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth."" After 9/11, many artists chose to respond to the horror and tragedy of the events  in the way they knew best - through their craft.  They drew their own line offering  photographs, sculpture, paintings, poetry,  and film that commemorate that day.  Their work, good or bad, will forever be a part of those events. So timing and quality is important. At just under 5 years since the destruction of the Twin Towers in NYC, and the crash of United 93 in a Pennsylvania field, is the time right. Maybe, it will never be right. ""the Flight of United 93,""  although approved by the familes of the passagers, might be a story not yet ready to be told, or more accurately it might be a story not ready to be heard and seen. With public opinion of the handling of the War down, maybe the time is right for a film that depicts the courageous actions of passengers on the fourth hijacked plane.Director Paul Greengrass thoughtfully undertakes the unenviable task of telling this pivotal chapter in the events of that tragic day. Greengrass, director of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY shoots UNITED 93 almost virtually in realtime as all 40 passengers and crew gather the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 to board United's flight from Newark to San Francisco. Along with the 40, are 5 men planning to use the plane as a weapon against the U.S. Capitol. Once it ""becomes clear"" that a hijacking has occurred passengers begin to sneak mobile calls, saying their goodbyes, but also discovering that 2 planes have already been rammed into the World Trade Center, confirming their worst fears. The passengers see no other choice than to risk confronting the hijackers to gain control of the plane. Greengrass, along with his superb cast and crew, reconstruct the events from factual information gained from cell calls, flight recorders,  the memories of families and ground controllers. Casting of mostly unknowns adds weight to the film, intensifying the haunting reality of the situation.This is no TV movie of the week. It is urgent, edgy, moving and ultimately a fitting memorial for the heroic passengers of flight United 93.Approved by the families of the passengers, a portion of proceeds goes to the FLIGHT 93 MEMORIAL FUND [...] The film was well received when it premiered at the Tribeca Film festival.Rated R for language and scenes of terror and violence.",5,UNITED stands!,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2540,"['September', '11th', '2001', '4', 'planes', 'were', 'hijacked', '3', 'reached', 'targets', 'UNITED', '93', 'story', 'forth.JFK', 'said', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'art', 'not', 'form', 'propaganda', 'form', 'truth', '9/11', 'many', 'artists', 'chose', 'respond', 'horror', 'tragedy', 'events', 'way', 'knew', 'best', 'craft', 'drew', 'own', 'line', 'offering', 'photographs', 'sculpture', 'paintings', 'poetry', 'film', 'commemorate', 'day', 'work', 'good', 'bad', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'part', 'events', 'So', 'timing', 'quality', 'important', 'just', '5', 'years', 'destruction', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'NYC', 'crash', 'United', '93', 'Pennsylvania', 'field', 'time', 'right', 'Maybe', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'right', 'Flight', 'United', '93', 'approved', 'familes', 'passagers', 'might', 'be', 'story', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'be', 'told', 'more', 'accurately', 'might', 'be', 'story', 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'heard', 'seen', 'public', 'opinion', 'handling', 'War', 'down', 'maybe', 'time', 'right', 'film', 'courageous', 'actions', 'passengers', 'fourth', 'hijacked', 'plane.Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'thoughtfully', 'unenviable', 'task', 'telling', 'pivotal', 'chapter', 'events', 'tragic', 'day', 'Greengrass', 'director', 'THE', 'BOURNE', 'SUPREMACY', 'shoots', 'UNITED', '93', 'almost', 'virtually', 'realtime', '40', 'passengers', 'crew', 'gather', 'morning', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'board', 'United', 'flight', 'Newark', 'San', 'Francisco', '40', 'are', '5', 'men', 'planning', 'use', 'plane', 'weapon', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'clear', 'hijacking', 'occurred', 'passengers', 'begin', 'sneak', 'mobile', 'calls', 'saying', 'goodbyes', 'also', 'discovering', '2', 'planes', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'rammed', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'confirming', 'worst', 'fears', 'passengers', 'see', 'other', 'choice', 'risk', 'confronting', 'hijackers', 'gain', 'control', 'plane', 'Greengrass', 'superb', 'cast', 'crew', 'reconstruct', 'events', 'factual', 'information', 'gained', 'cell', 'calls', 'flight', 'recorders', 'memories', 'families', 'ground', 'controllers', 'Casting', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'weight', 'film', 'intensifying', 'haunting', 'reality', 'situation.This', 'TV', 'movie', 'week', 'urgent', 'edgy', 'moving', 'ultimately', 'fitting', 'memorial', 'heroic', 'passengers', 'flight', 'United', '93.Approved', 'families', 'passengers', 'portion', 'proceeds', 'FLIGHT', '93', 'MEMORIAL', 'FUND', '[', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'when', 'premiered', 'Tribeca', 'Film', 'festival.Rated', 'R', 'language', 'scenes', 'terror', 'violence']",United 93
644226,A3SIRH8JWGYU80,B00005JOZI,Kevin W. Koehler,"[4, 7]","Invariably, the first question people asked upon this film's release was ""is it too soon?"" Absurd, really. Whether we want it to be or not, 9/11 is the defining event of our lives. It's about time we talked about it like grownups, not bumper stickers.The second question people asked is ""why,"" as in, why make this movie? Conspiracy theorists aside, most people are fully aware of what happened that day. The heroics of United Flight 93 are well-documented - do we need the facts recounted for us one more time?Except movies are not simply recounting of facts, as much as An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge is a recounting of a hanging. The best filmmaking brings flesh to bone and there are few dancing skeletons that could use more humanity than 9/11. More a political football than a living, breathing thing, its dusty remains are trotted out for a cabaret routine every time there's photo opportunity to be had, an election to be won, or someone wants to wiretap our phones. We live under the specter 9/11, slaves to a ghost we can feel but not always see.Above all other things, Paul Greengrass' wonderful United 93 reminds us that the victims and perpetrators of 9/11 are human beings; the bin Ladens and Bushes of the world (and indeed, the participants in this film) may invoke God in their struggles, but that terrible day in September was very much the act of man. Mohammed did not hijack a plane - Mohammed Atta did. This should be obvious, but sadly, it is not. We find comfort in order, not chaos, and there are few things more chaotic to our structured existence of traffic jams, ATMs, and Starbucks than mass death played out live on CNN. 9/11 began as a day like any other; the people on United flight 93 showered, shaved, had children, ate breakfast, made small talk, and cried when faced with their own mortality. What happened on that airplane happened, not to angels, but people, and these people could very well been us.And we are quite alone.I can't help but chuckle every time I read a new 9/11 conspiracy theory when, in truth, the federal government is too bureaucratically inept to manage any complex sinister plot adequately. There is no shadowy figure pulling all the strings - indeed, President Bush is notable in United 93 for his complete absence (I interpret this is a statement rather than a lack one). It's a scary world; in a way, we're all in the cockpit of United flight 93, hurtling towards the ground, grabbing feebly at controls we don't even know how to use.Some may see this as cynical. I see it as empowering. When I was younger, I remember driving home from Yankee Stadium, peering across the river at the Manhattan skyline and thinking man was truly capable of great things. Those terrorists took part of the greatness away that day, but the passengers of flight 93 put a different kind of transcendence in its place. The nobility of gods is un-relatable; it is the nobility of man that inspires.Interesting footnote: Lewis Alsamari, an Iraqi-born British actor who plays one of the hijackers, tried to attend the U.S. premiere of United 93 but was refused a visa for having been a member of the Iraqi army. Alsamari had been conscripted into service and deserted in 1993, living in Britain under refugee status since that time.",5,it is the nobility of man that inspires,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,3272,"['Invariably', 'first', 'question', 'people', 'asked', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'too', 'soon', 'Absurd', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'not', '9/11', 'defining', 'event', 'lives', 'time', 'talked', 'grownups', 'not', 'stickers.The', 'second', 'question', 'people', 'asked', 'why', 'why', 'make', 'movie', 'Conspiracy', 'theorists', 'aside', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'heroics', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'are', 'well-documented', 'do', 'need', 'facts', 'recounted', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'recounting', 'facts', 'as', 'much', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'recounting', 'hanging', 'best', 'filmmaking', 'brings', 'flesh', 'bone', 'are', 'few', 'dancing', 'skeletons', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'humanity', '9/11', 'More', 'political', 'football', 'living', 'breathing', 'thing', 'dusty', 'remains', 'are', 'trotted', 'out', 'cabaret', 'routine', 'time', 'photo', 'opportunity', 'be', 'had', 'election', 'be', 'won', 'someone', 'wiretap', 'phones', 'live', 'specter', '9/11', 'slaves', 'ghost', 'can', 'feel', 'not', 'always', 'see.Above', 'other', 'things', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'wonderful', 'United', '93', 'victims', 'perpetrators', '9/11', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'bin', 'Ladens', 'Bushes', 'world', 'indeed', 'participants', 'film', 'may', 'invoke', 'God', 'struggles', 'terrible', 'day', 'September', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'act', 'man', 'Mohammed', 'did', 'not', 'hijack', 'plane', 'Mohammed', 'Atta', 'did', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'sadly', 'not', 'find', 'comfort', 'order', 'not', 'chaos', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'more', 'chaotic', 'structured', 'existence', 'traffic', 'jams', 'ATMs', 'Starbucks', 'mass', 'death', 'played', 'out', 'live', 'CNN', '9/11', 'began', 'day', 'other', 'people', 'United', 'flight', '93', 'showered', 'shaved', 'had', 'children', 'ate', 'breakfast', 'made', 'small', 'talk', 'cried', 'when', 'faced', 'own', 'mortality', 'What', 'happened', 'airplane', 'happened', 'not', 'angels', 'people', 'people', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'been', 'us.And', 'are', 'quite', 'alone.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'time', 'read', 'new', '9/11', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'when', 'truth', 'federal', 'government', 'too', 'bureaucratically', 'inept', 'manage', 'complex', 'sinister', 'plot', 'adequately', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'pulling', 'strings', 'indeed', 'President', 'Bush', 'notable', 'United', '93', 'complete', 'absence', 'interpret', 'statement', 'rather', 'lack', 'one', 'scary', 'world', 'way', ""'re"", 'cockpit', 'United', 'flight', '93', 'hurtling', 'ground', 'grabbing', 'feebly', 'controls', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use.Some', 'may', 'see', 'cynical', 'see', 'empowering', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'remember', 'driving', 'home', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'peering', 'river', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'thinking', 'man', 'was', 'truly', 'capable', 'great', 'things', 'terrorists', 'took', 'part', 'greatness', 'away', 'day', 'passengers', 'flight', '93', 'put', 'different', 'kind', 'transcendence', 'place', 'nobility', 'gods', 'un-relatable', 'nobility', 'man', 'inspires.Interesting', 'footnote', 'Lewis', 'Alsamari', 'Iraqi-born', 'British', 'actor', 'who', 'one', 'hijackers', 'tried', 'attend', 'U.S.', 'premiere', 'United', '93', 'was', 'refused', 'visa', 'having', 'been', 'member', 'Iraqi', 'army', 'Alsamari', 'had', 'been', 'conscripted', 'service', 'deserted', '1993', 'living', 'Britain', 'refugee', 'status', 'time']",United 93

It is a near real-time account of what happened on the doomed United flight that was headed for San Francisco but ended up in a field in Pennsylvania when its passengers overpowered the cowards who intended to use it to hit our nation's capitol.  It opens with the cowards preparing for their mission.  We are then given the seemingly mundane but all-important events of preparing a flight for take-off.  We get very brief glimpses at the lives of the pilot, co-pilot, and the steward staff.  We learn that some of them have children, some of them have been to London, and others are looking forward to a little time off.  We get hints at the lives of the passengers as well.  Some of the have dealings with Sony, some of them are going to meet family, others are planning a visit to Yosemite.  All of these things seem so simple, so ""average,"" but the viewer realizes that none of these normal, everyday events will never come to fruition due to the actions of a few others on board the flight.We also learn of the chaos that tears air traffic controllers apart as they try to determine the fate of a multitude of hijacked and possibly hijacked flights.  Who or what hit the Towers?  Where are those three other planes headed?  Why can't we get airspace clearance from the FAA.  Should we ground an entire nation's flight schedule?  Why is their no response from American 11?This is simply a moving film.  I almost didn't want to watch it because I didn't know how I'd react.  I'll admit that I cried a lot.  I was also very, very angered by the actions of the cowards on the flight.  Yet in the end I was glad to have watched this film.  It showed just how strong the American spirit can be.  Even though the brave souls on United 93 were well aware of their impending fates, they came together to save the lives of so many others.This single-disc edition provides a trailer for ""Twin Towers"" and an hour-long documentary with interviews of surviving family members of the heroes on Flight 93.  It also has a memorial with a brief biography of all of the heroes who perished defending their country and their fellow man.

644228,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JOZI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As we approached the end of 2006, everyone released their pick for the top films of that year. I do the same thing every year as I assess the movies that I've had the pleasure of viewing, either on the big screen or on DVD. 2006, in truth, wasn't the strongest year--but there were a fair share of surprises. While many of the blockbusters actually surpassed my expectations with unusual depth or sheer adrenaline, it is many of the smaller films that lingered in my memory. ""United 93"" was a moderate hit at the box office and received pretty universal critical acclaim, but there was not much expectation that it would fare well come awards season. It was released very early in the year which is usually problematic. However, to my delight--the film was remembered and honored as one of the year's top films and its reputation has endured and grown stronger.""United 93,"" for my money, was the best film of 2006. Sparse and powerful, this docudrama took about 90 minutes of real time to unfold one of the most matter-of-factly harrowing and heroic episodes put down on film. Far from being a political diatribe, the film documents a real humanity and the commonality that pulls ordinary people together in a time of crisis. Offering almost no commentary, ""United 93"" just presents the facts of the situation about that ill-fated flight. Reconstructed largely from actual participants and phone records, this is about as close to reality as a narrative film can get.In an audacious decision, director Paul Greengrass does not ask that we know the passengers or ground crew as individuals. You see them in brief, slice-of-life moments as they ready themselves for the day--but there is no backstory, no manufactured drama. It's just a cross section of regular men and women doing mundane things on what will become a most extraordinary day. You will start to know some of the individuals from their actions and their responses, but the film doesn't offer anything extraneous. This simplicity and lack of ordinary storytelling convention sets ""United 93"" apart.By allowing an objective viewpoint, the film achieves a power that is more inherently real than 99% of scripted films. There is an honor and dignity at work here that's quite unexpected. Even though the film plays with a documentary feel, it ends up almost impossible not to envision yourself in the same situation. As such, ""United 93"" strikes a real and resonant emotional chord. It's easy to only accept this film as a poignant document of that day and a tribute to those involved. And that it is. It's also easy for those who wish to dismiss it as a cover-up to conspiracy theories to do so. But what I don't want to get lost in any political debate is the fact that this is also great filmmaking.I was more affected by this film emotionally than any other film of that year. And I have reflected on it more often than any other film in recent years. For those reasons, ""United 93"" was easily my choice for best film of its year. Heartbreaking, Intelligent, Horrifying, Uplifting--It's perfect.

644229,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B00005JOZI,"kone ""kone""","[4, 5]","United 93 presents in chronological order the horrific sequence of events that occurred on 9-11-01, which resulted in the World Trade Center Twin Towers collapse, the Pentagon strike, and the crash of United 93 in a farmfield in Pennsylvania.(United 93 is the airplane that was hijacked by terrorists with the purpose of crashing it into the Capitol building (or the White House)).The movie is very well done, presented in a factual manner with little Hollywood hyperbole.  It takes the viewer from the hotel rooms of the terrorists (praying to Allah for success), to the air-traffic controllers who tried to make sense out of the events as they occurred in real time, to the boarding of the passengers of United 93, the hijacking, and the heroic, yet failed attempt to regain control of the plane by a group of United passengers.  One can viscerallty sense the profound confusion and indecision of the air-traffic controllers and the passengers that fateful day. What was going on? How to respond to it? The communications between the air-traffic controllers, the military, and the President is shown to be confused and incomplete.  Can United 93 be shot down by militry jets to prevent another major catastrophe? Our unpreparedness for this type of attack is clearly evident.While air-traffic controllers struggle to determine what to do, we also view the evolving condition on the airplane.  Step by step, as more information is obtained by passengers on furtive cell-phone calls to family members, they come to the stark realization that their plane is doomed, and that they must do something to prevent another disasterous crash.As the plane speeds headlong into its final moments, with the passengers fighting for control of the cockpit, we see the ground rapidly looming up in the windows of the plane, exactly as the passengers must have seen. It is gripping and horrible.  It feels like we are in the plane with the passengers: the fighting, the confusion, the screams, the plane lurching to and fro, the abject terror of the moment.  Then all goes dark.This production seems more like a documentary than a movie production.  For instance, the names of the 37 passengers are not given, nor is there any significant character development.  The viewer gets the sense that these 37 random people boarded the plane, knowing nothing about each other, and were forced to quickly 'unite"", communicate, and then react to the developing situation.  Despite the sparce characterizations, there is still considerable emotional impact, as the humanity of the passengers and crew is shown as they make calls to their loved ones to say a final ""goodbye"".There is historical debate whether the passengers actually entered into the cockpit.  However, there is no doubt that their actions in trying to retake the plane resulted in the crash, and saved Washington from a direct hit on a symbol of American government (the Capitol building).[...]We are nearly 8 years removed from 9-11-01, when Bin Laden boldly proclaimed war on the USA.  Although we are fortunate to not have suffered another homeland terrorist attack, Bin Laden is still at large, and no doubt has plans to strike us again.  Watching this movie reminds me that the war of terror continues, and we must be continually vigilant lest we forget the past.konedog",5,Lest We Forget,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,3317,"['United', '93', 'presents', 'chronological', 'order', 'horrific', 'sequence', 'events', 'occurred', '9-11-01', 'resulted', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'collapse', 'Pentagon', 'strike', 'crash', 'United', '93', 'farmfield', 'Pennsylvania', 'United', '93', 'airplane', 'was', 'hijacked', 'terrorists', 'purpose', 'crashing', 'Capitol', 'building', 'White', 'House', '.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'presented', 'factual', 'manner', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'hyperbole', 'viewer', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'terrorists', 'praying', 'Allah', 'success', 'air-traffic', 'controllers', 'who', 'tried', 'make', 'sense', 'events', 'occurred', 'real', 'time', 'boarding', 'passengers', 'United', '93', 'hijacking', 'heroic', 'yet', 'failed', 'attempt', 'regain', 'control', 'plane', 'group', 'United', 'passengers', 'One', 'can', 'viscerallty', 'sense', 'profound', 'confusion', 'indecision', 'air-traffic', 'controllers', 'passengers', 'fateful', 'day', 'What', 'was', 'going', 'How', 'respond', 'communications', 'air-traffic', 'controllers', 'military', 'President', 'shown', 'be', 'confused', 'incomplete', 'Can', 'United', '93', 'be', 'shot', 'down', 'militry', 'jets', 'prevent', 'major', 'catastrophe', 'unpreparedness', 'type', 'attack', 'clearly', 'evident.While', 'air-traffic', 'controllers', 'struggle', 'determine', 'what', 'do', 'also', 'view', 'evolving', 'condition', 'airplane', 'Step', 'step', 'more', 'information', 'obtained', 'passengers', 'furtive', 'cell-phone', 'calls', 'family', 'members', 'come', 'stark', 'realization', 'plane', 'doomed', 'must', 'do', 'something', 'prevent', 'disasterous', 'crash.As', 'plane', 'speeds', 'headlong', 'final', 'moments', 'passengers', 'fighting', 'control', 'cockpit', 'see', 'ground', 'rapidly', 'looming', 'up', 'windows', 'plane', 'exactly', 'passengers', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'gripping', 'horrible', 'are', 'plane', 'passengers', 'fighting', 'confusion', 'screams', 'plane', 'lurching', 'fro', 'abject', 'terror', 'moment', 'Then', 'dark.This', 'production', 'more', 'documentary', 'movie', 'production', 'instance', 'names', '37', 'passengers', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'there', 'significant', 'character', 'development', 'viewer', 'sense', '37', 'random', 'people', 'boarded', 'plane', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'other', 'were', 'forced', 'quickly', ""'unite"", 'communicate', 'then', 'react', 'developing', 'situation', 'sparce', 'characterizations', 'still', 'considerable', 'emotional', 'impact', 'humanity', 'passengers', 'crew', 'shown', 'make', 'calls', 'loved', 'ones', 'say', 'final', 'goodbye', 'historical', 'debate', 'passengers', 'actually', 'entered', 'cockpit', 'However', 'doubt', 'actions', 'trying', 'retake', 'plane', 'resulted', 'crash', 'saved', 'Washington', 'direct', 'hit', 'symbol', 'American', 'government', 'Capitol', 'building', '[', 'are', 'nearly', '8', 'years', 'removed', '9-11-01', 'when', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'boldly', 'proclaimed', 'war', 'USA', 'are', 'fortunate', 'not', 'have', 'suffered', 'homeland', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'still', 'large', 'doubt', 'plans', 'strike', 'again', 'Watching', 'movie', 'war', 'terror', 'must', 'be', 'continually', 'vigilant', 'lest', 'forget', 'past.konedog']",United 93
644230,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00005JOZI,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 7]","This is a respectful, well-acted, honest, and as scrupulously accurate a cinematic account of the tragic flight of United 93 as we are probably ever going to see. For the few of you who don't know (and for you ""Truthers"" who disrespectfully call people ""sheeple""), United 93 was the fourth plane hijacked on September 11, 2001. The plane was turned toward Washington DC by the terrorists, but it never got there, instead crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. As far as we can tell, the passengers attempted to seize the plane from the hijackers, who drove it a full speed straight into the earth. No one survived.Some of what we see onscreen is necessarily supposition, based on ambient sounds in cellphone and airphone calls made by the passengers. We'll never know if the passengers succeeded in taking the plane even for a moment, but I like to think so.People have said that this film is exploitative. They are, of course, welcome to their opinions, but there is nothing exploitative about UNITED 93, any more than there was anything exploitative about APOLLO 13. Film has become a medium for reporting history, hopefully responsibly.""9/11 Truthers,"" in love with conspiracy theories, advance the idea that the government planned the entire incident, but their ""facts"" are made of inference upon inference, skewed to acheive a particular result. Bushworld did not need 9/11 to advance it's Preemptive War Doctrine; any of a score of minor incidents would have sufficed. Hitler started World War II over a border incident at Gleiwitz, a phony incident in which German soldiers battled other German soldiers masquerading as Polish soldiers. A few phony mannequin soldiers were even ""killed.""But there was certainly nothing phony about the deaths on 9/11.The media and the establishment have made ""heroes"" out of the Flight 93 passengers, but this both embellishes and obscures the truth. Americans tend to like their ""heroes"" larger than life, infallible, brave beyond reckoning, and unblemished, the types of mythic figures of which we make statues.Yet we forget that the true heroes are everyday people, like fathers and mothers who go to work each day, return home each night, and dedicate their lives to the kids and to little things like painting the garage, and people who keep on with an exhausting and impossible task to the end no matter the result.The Flight 93 passengers are these kinds of heroes, heroes without quotation marks.After hearing the news that the World Trade Center and The Pentagon had been attacked, realizing that they themselves were doomed if they did nothing, and faced with the reality that they most likely would die anyway, they fought back against the zeal-infected hijackers with airline cutlery, hot water, and sheer determination. Flight 93 became a manned cruise missile, a kamikaze mission, and a battleground on which a group of ordinary, terrified people transcended fear in order to take back what had been taken from them, their lives. That they died in no way diminishes what they accomplished.This film is a fitting memorial to them.",5,United 93,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3098,"['respectful', 'well-acted', 'honest', 'scrupulously', 'cinematic', 'account', 'tragic', 'flight', 'United', '93', 'are', 'probably', 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'few', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Truthers', 'who', 'disrespectfully', 'call', 'people', 'sheeple', 'United', '93', 'was', 'fourth', 'plane', 'hijacked', 'September', '11', '2001', 'plane', 'was', 'turned', 'Washington', 'DC', 'terrorists', 'never', 'got', 'there', 'instead', 'crashing', 'field', 'Shanksville', 'Pennsylvania', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'passengers', 'attempted', 'seize', 'plane', 'hijackers', 'who', 'drove', 'full', 'speed', 'straight', 'earth', 'one', 'survived.Some', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen', 'necessarily', 'supposition', 'based', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'cellphone', 'airphone', 'calls', 'made', 'passengers', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'passengers', 'succeeded', 'taking', 'plane', 'even', 'moment', 'like', 'think', 'so.People', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'exploitative', 'are', 'course', 'welcome', 'opinions', 'nothing', 'exploitative', 'UNITED', '93', 'more', 'was', 'anything', 'exploitative', 'APOLLO', '13', 'Film', 'become', 'medium', 'reporting', 'history', 'hopefully', 'responsibly', '9/11', 'Truthers', 'love', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'advance', 'idea', 'government', 'planned', 'entire', 'incident', 'facts', 'are', 'made', 'inference', 'inference', 'skewed', 'acheive', 'particular', 'result', 'Bushworld', 'did', 'not', 'need', '9/11', 'advance', 'Preemptive', 'War', 'Doctrine', 'score', 'minor', 'incidents', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'Hitler', 'started', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'border', 'incident', 'Gleiwitz', 'phony', 'incident', 'German', 'soldiers', 'battled', 'other', 'German', 'soldiers', 'masquerading', 'Polish', 'soldiers', 'few', 'phony', 'mannequin', 'soldiers', 'were', 'even', 'killed', 'was', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'phony', 'deaths', '9/11.The', 'media', 'establishment', 'have', 'made', 'heroes', 'Flight', '93', 'passengers', 'embellishes', 'truth', 'Americans', 'tend', 'like', 'heroes', 'larger', 'life', 'infallible', 'brave', 'reckoning', 'unblemished', 'types', 'mythic', 'figures', 'make', 'statues.Yet', 'forget', 'true', 'heroes', 'are', 'everyday', 'people', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'who', 'go', 'work', 'day', 'return', 'home', 'night', 'dedicate', 'lives', 'kids', 'little', 'things', 'painting', 'garage', 'people', 'who', 'keep', 'exhausting', 'impossible', 'task', 'end', 'matter', 'result.The', 'Flight', '93', 'passengers', 'are', 'kinds', 'heroes', 'heroes', 'quotation', 'marks.After', 'hearing', 'news', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'had', 'been', 'attacked', 'realizing', 'were', 'doomed', 'did', 'nothing', 'faced', 'reality', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'die', 'anyway', 'fought', 'back', 'zeal-infected', 'hijackers', 'airline', 'cutlery', 'hot', 'water', 'sheer', 'determination', 'Flight', '93', 'became', 'manned', 'cruise', 'missile', 'kamikaze', 'mission', 'battleground', 'group', 'ordinary', 'terrified', 'people', 'transcended', 'fear', 'order', 'take', 'back', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'lives', 'died', 'way', 'what', 'accomplished.This', 'film', 'fitting', 'memorial']",United 93

However, we can't really say we actually know or fully understand what truely took place, or how the events really unfolded aboard all 4 airplanes. However, the good thing about this movie is that it does shed some light on the subject, and it tries to give the people some insight as to what happened. Can anyone honestly say that this movie is completely, without a shadow of a doubt, accurate? Absolutely not! Can anyone honestly say that this is how it happened? Absolutely not! But, this movie does try to give you a pretty good idea. I won't lie, at times this movie is very hard to watch especially knowing how everything turns out. I guess what mostly got to me, is the fact that I knew what I was watching wasn't a movie, or something just for entertainment, but these people actually lost their lives on this plane. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried. I cried to myself thinking that things may have turned out differently if those brave individuals would've just gotten to the cockpit of the plane a little sooner than they did. I cried about the thought of having to call my family and friends to tell them goodbye because I'm about to die. I cried because a whole lot of innocent people suffered and ultimately paid the price for something they had absolutely nothing to do with. This movie also shows you how unprepared and surprised the U.S Government officials were while these events were taking place. This movie cleared up a lot of unanswered questions for me. Like, how could guys with sharpened nail filers and small pocket knives hijack a plane full of people? I'm glad to say that this movie added plausibility to that scenario for me. I find it astonishing that I have read reviews with people complaining about the cinematography, and other useless crap like that. Let's get for real, I think this movie was done with what was important..RESPECT! For the families of the victims. I think this movie would've been extremely disrespectful if there were a lot of special effects dumbing it down. That's typical Hollywood fashion anyway. To make money off of other people's tragedies. I must say that cinematography was the furthest thing from my mind while I was watching this movie, and if I wanted special effects or cinematography I could've watched ""The Matrix"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". This movie was way too serious to make light of. I'm also glad they didn't get a whole lot of big screen actors and actresses to portray these real life people, therefore, making it a whole lot more believable in my opinion. I find it hard to believe the validity of a real life events with Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello, and Michael Pena as the stars of the movie like ""World Trade Center"". That's portraying it like it's nothing more than another action/drama movie, or some kind of made for T.V movie.

644237,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOZI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","I watched ""United 93"" a week after watching ""Flight 93"" again and while I have no problem with multiple tellings of the same story, it is interesting to compare and contrast the two films to better appreciate what is happening in this one.  Both films begin with the terrorist hijackers saying their morning prayers, a grotesque irony that continues to fuel the conflict between radical Islamic fundamentalists and the West.  But at that point writer-director Paul Greengrass sets a different tone for this theatrical film because we do not see any of the passengers and crews at their homes.  Instead we get to Newark Airport and the pilots and flight attendants walk on board the doomed flight, while the terrorists and passengers gather in the terminal.  In ""Flight 93"" we saw the names on the tickets of the passengers as they went through the final checkpoint, but in this film Greengrass makes no effort to clearly establish names (unless you turn on the subtitles, then names are identified when characters speak off camera).  You may know enough about the flight to recognize which character is Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, or any of the others, but their individuality is not necessary to the story being told.  Greengrass talks about it being a collective experience and that is clearly his approach to telling the story.For me the most memorable parts of ""Flight 93"" were with the family members on the ground who were giving information and support to the passengers on the plane.  In ""United 93"" we never see or hear those family members, so the two films compliment each other in that regard.  What Greengrass offers it is place is the air traffic controlling system dealing with the hijackings, focusing on the inability to comprehend what was going on and the confusion as the system tried to catch up with events.  While he hired actors and actresses that would not be easily recognizable to viewers for everyone on United 93, Greengrass got several of the people at the FAA, the air traffic control systems, and even with the U.S. military, to play themselves.  Of course we do not recognize any of them, but the verisimilitude is from their language and their reactions, because what is ultimately important here is that Greengrass is not trying to explain the events of 9/11.  Instead, he is trying to recreate them and to depict the confusion rather than indicting or excusing it.  I think Greengrass makes it clear that even as the bits and pieces of key information emerge as to what is going one, that there was nothing that could be done for the simple reason that events that were unfolding were beyond imagination.  It is not until the second plane hits the second tower that the obvious connection led to the ultimate realization.The use of nonprofessional actors, the refusal to even identify let alone establish key characters, and the improvisational nature of the production, all give ""United 93"" a documentary feel.  Actually, the more I think about it I would amend that to be that the film lacks a lot of what we would expect in a Hollywood dramatization, so that it does not seem like a movie.  There is a sense that we are there, which is certainly a key part of documentaries, but that the movie unfolds in real time gives it much more of a sense of immediacy.  Technical jargon is being bandied about my lots of people, without ever bothering to explain what it all means, adding to the sense of confusion.  But we know what is going to happen and so we understand the irony that minutes after United 93 took off from Newark, with the tops of the World Trade Center towers visible out the window past one of the terrorists, when American 11 disappears on the air traffic control radar what has happened.  Not that this intellectual knowledge makes the emotional impact any less, because it is out ability to connect the dots and be ahead of the people we see on the screen that provides a lot of the power of the narrative.  The final act of the film takes place entirely on the airplane, where there is a real sense of how quickly the passengers put together the information, decided to act, and then tried to regain control of the plane.In his commentary track Greengrass gets into much more of the details of what happened that day, as well as emphasizing what he was trying to do with these scenes.  So if you want more of an explanation for what was happening, Greengrass provides that to some degree.  The one new element that stood out for me was the idea that one of the passengers knew how to fly a single engine plane, so that there was the hope that with the pilots dead there was somebody who could land the plan, albeit with a lot of help from ground control.  I am not sure what I think of introducing that element of hope, because one of the key elements of the heroism of these passengers was that stopping the terrorists from their objective (certainly either the White House or more probably the Capitol building), was as important as trying to regain control of the plane.While this film does not show the families of the passengers, there is an hour-long featurette on the families and the making of ""United 93,"" so they are present on the DVD as well.  There are also memorial pages for all of the passengers and crew, posted by family members (arranged alphabetically by first name, in another nice touch).  Finally, there is a trailer for the Academy Award Winning Short Documentary ""Twin Towers.""  What you will not find here are any deleted scenes, although Greengrass talks about an alternative opening sequences set in Afghanistan.  It makes sense that a film told in real time would not have deleted scenes, but we know that there were alternate takes because of the improvisational nature of the film, so I want to applaud Greengrass for putting together his final cut and sticking with it.",5,A powerful real-time recreation of 9/11 and United Flight 93,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,5869,"['watched', 'United', '93',

Wow, was I surprised!Not only is this a movie where you'll sit there mezmerized and watch the credits at the end, but you'll then be further amazed to see how many land-based people played themselves!  No where in the whole journey did I think that the acting was cheesy or low-budget.  To the contrary, I felt like I was there -- re-living that morning of September 11, 2001.To be sure, there had to be some element of speculation as to certain details, but thanks to cell phones and air phones, this is truly a true story.One shocking aspect of the truth of what you'll see is how much incorrect information the decision-makers worked with while these historical tragedies required HUGE decisions to be made.One of the most powerful scenes was how the movie cut back and forth between the muslim terrorists praying to Allah, while the innocent passenger-heros were praying to the one true God who gave us The Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm.

644239,AYMZTWBG0V53W,B00005JOZI,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[0, 0]","Paul Greengrass's &#34;United 93&#34; is a harrowing, intense docufiction about what apparently happened inside the flight on that fateful day of 9/11 (sadly, a day that many Americans have already put behind them), and the director was brave enough to show the Americans as brave souls who were willing to fight back against the mentally ill cowards who took over the plane for a purpose that I find unspeakable--and eternally unforgivable, period. The film hurtles forward through the old clich&eacute; of &#34;real time&#34;, but in this movie it works--the editing, the sound design, the music, the acting, and the violence all work towards a brutalizing but dramatically powerful effect. The film does raise the issue of just exactly what purpose that movies should serve (the touching extra on the suffering of the American families who lost loved ones on that day is especially telling and is a must watch for everyone) today, but the story is so heartbreaking (and to me, upsetting) that it really deserves a hearing despite what my ideas about cinema's function may be. I don't know if it was ethically sound to release a film like this due to the tragedy that accompanied this unfortunate historic incident, but Greengrass isn't afraid to step on toes, and his courting of controversy shows an intrepid sensibility that I admire in filmmakers. But it will be up to you if you find it watchable or simply horrible. In any case, may the world never forget--and never forgive.The DVD is a great presentation alone, and it has terrific sound and image indeed. The picture is very clear, and I had no trouble with my copy. The widescreen presentation is perfect for catching the intense editing of this film, which helps to enhance its appeal for lovers of suspenseful film construction. I can't say that this film is a pleasant experience (Greengrass does show a talent for riling one to great heights of anger and outrage, and it's hard for me to describe the great filmmaking talent here as a result), but it is necessary viewing for all Americans, and a powerful tribute to the brave men and women who lost their lives on that day.

What good people can accomplish, even at ultimate cost, when they are driven by a single purpose.The event turned the tables on the crusades. Now it is the Arabs and Islamist fanatics that bring their convert or die mentality to western society.  These fanatics have never stopped fighting the crusades.  The word is split into a dichotomy of two worlds, black and white, or Good vs Evil, nothing in between. Either you believe in Allah, or you must be put to dealth.  It reveiled the darkness that sorrounds ignorant racist and religious fanatacism and the ultimate price that humanity must pay for not giving proper consideration to historical perspective.Much of the power of United 93 is the knowledge that there but for the grace of g-d, we were spared from this tradegy. This film allows you to experience first hand cockpit view of the world turned upside down.How the jihadists had sacrificed their claim to legitamacy by their complete disrespect for life and the senseless murder of blameless souls who were butchered on Sept 11th.It also sheds light on the very real possibility that you may be on the next hijacked jet that could be shot down by our government to prevent another tradegy.Prior to watching this film, I was concerned about losing my control to the greif and horible actions experienced.  I was amazed to find the exact opposite.  It made me proud to be part of the human race.  Not one victim lost their care and concern for those around them.  I was proud of the people wo would not give in to the terrorists.  We will never give them what they want.  We are americans, come from parents that suffered great adversity and sacrifice to get us where we are today.  Our stregnth is our multicultural heritage and our love for the opportunities this county affords us all.  G-d bless america.

I was shocked beyond what I can describe and consider ""United 93"" as one of the best real events description moments in cinema history.Paul Greengrass decided to make this film in a totally non-Hollywoodian style and he was dead right on target. No famous names, no Hollywood stars and some real air controllers who were in service on September 11 play themselves. The story keeps (as much as I can judge) strictly to the events of the day and there is no typically American alterations (no little girls waiting for transplantation, etc.). The events on board of United 93, the plane where passengers rebelled against the terrorists and stormed the cockpit, are described based on the real telephonic conversations, radio transmissions and the record from the black box. Some more conversations had to be added, but they fit very much to the rest of the story.The terrorists are very well described, including their leader (the pilot) who actually hesitates about ten minutes before giving the order of attack - it seems he was the only one of the attackers who was married and was leaving somebody behind. Even this is deduced from the real events, because United 93 was indeed hijacked later after the take off, than the three other planes. The fight on board of the plane is extremely ugly and realistic - no Hollywood usual stuff again.The incredible conversations between the military air defence command and the Supreme Headquarters of the US Air Force are one of the high points of the movie, with the general in charge begging desperately for a permission to shoot the hijacked planes before learning, that the two fighters that he managed to send in the air on such a short notice are unarmed... etc, etc. This is a great, great description of a great tragedy and possibly the best illustration of the proverbial ""fog of war"" I ever seen.As one of the previous reviewers, me too I do not think I will ever see this movie again - not because it is bad, but because it is SOOOOO good.

644243,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JOZI,magellan,"[1, 1]","This movie is sure to be controversial. Some people will like it, seeing it as a tribute to the heroes of flight 93; others will no doubt see it as opportunistic and cashing in on the tragedy of the flight. But overall I enjoyed the movie and it seemed to be a realistic enactment of what could have happened on that ill-fated flight. I also liked the fact that the director didn't use big name or professional actors, but who did very well in the movie.I had one more comment to make, but on a perhaps different or unusual topic. I am a martial arts instructor one of whose specialties is knife tactics and knife defense. The hijackers in the movie did not seem very skilled or well trained in knife fighting, which means they could possibly have been overcome by someone who was trained in empty-hand tactics against the knife. These skills are more difficult and take more time to acquire than empty-handed skills, of course, but it can be done. Even if one is a master of these arts, though, there are no guarantees, as anything can happen in a knife fight. One thing that was interesting, though, was how easily the one hijacker with the knife was overcome once the passengers decided to act together. Even a knife-wielding assailant can be overcome if they have to face multiple attackers who come at them from different sides simultaneously. He might be able to get to one or two of the incoming people, but likely not all.Another possibility is that perhaps the flight crew could be trained in the use of the Taser electrical dart/stun gun device, which, although not 100% effective if the person is wearing thick clothing, could be worth considering since it would be much safer to fire in a plane than a gun and would not cause explosive decompression like a gun if the hull was penetrated.Unfortunately, 10,000 years of ""civilization"" has shown that humans do not seem to able to live in peace, and so both individually and as a species we perpetually live in uncertain and dangerous times. And this movie is a reminder of the fact that the U.S. is a more dangerous place than it was just a few years ago. Overall, though, I thought it was a good movie and a dramatic re-enactment a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives in this tragic event.

644246,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00005JOZI,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","I can remember the first time I saw ""United 93"" - I was stunned and intensely moved. Released less than five years after the events of September 11, 2001 - the wounds were still raw. Yet the film was sentiment and opinion free - visceral to the extreme - and painfully, brutally honest - and of course all the more admirable for it.Written and Directed by PAUL GREENGRASS - it had the most difficult material in the world to deal with - fraught with all sorts of depiction dangers and accusations of a crass cash-in. And yet it succeeded on every level. Come the last 15 minutes - your hurt is pretty much uncontrollable and the tears are flowing for real.It arrived not surprisingly on BLU RAY on the 10th Anniversary of the event (Sept 2011) - and here it is again (June 2012) on a BLU RAY/DVD/DIGITAL DOWNLOAD combo-pack as part of Universal's 100th Anniversary celebrations in the generic card-wrap packaging associated with that huge series of reissues (see comment section for full list). And I'm glad to say it boasts a proper upgrade in picture quality and 'bonus material' which is not just respectful - but equal in power to the movie itself...It opens with four men in an apartment block. Dressed like a Middle Eastern businessman, the leader of the group squints underneath his immaculately clean reading glasses. But Ziad Jarrah is nervous - and as he breathily chants prayers over his Koran - even seems troubled. But a face that has no such qualms interrupts Ziad. It's Ahmed Al Haznawi - who will later hold the flight at bay with a knife he's smuggled into his belt. The al-Qaeda radical fixes Ziad with a steely gaze and says - ""It's time.""And so begins their infamous journey - driving to the airport - parking their cars - checking-in with minimal luggage - getting through the security monitors - and eventually boarding ""United 93"" - an early-morning non-stop flight from Newark International to San Francisco. Hours later - 33 passengers and 7 flight crew are fighting back - desperately trying to retake the cockpit from Ziad and Ahmed. But despite their valiant efforts - the Boeing 757 nosedives into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03 am. And of the four aircraft hijacked and sacrificed that horrible day, it was the only one 'not' to reach Osama Bin Laden's presumed target (The White House, Washington DC).Why does ""United 93"" work? First up - Greengrass begins with the everyday - the 'ordinary'. In the waiting area - Thomas Burnett makes a business call as he eyes his polished shoes - while a dehydrated Nicole Miller applies lip-gloss once on board. Equally beautiful and seated for take-off, hostess Cee Cee Lyles regrets having not brought enough magazines for her to read on a 5-hour long haul flight - while passengers Patrick Driscoll and his friend William Cashman (70 and 60) plan a hiking holiday to Yosemite National Park from a colour brochure. Hilda Marcin asks politely for a glass of water so she can swallow her medication with her breakfast - while a man opens his laptop on the seat rest in front of him with a relaxed air. A 20-year old Deora Bodley is trying to do just that - she fixes a makeshift pillow on the headrest of her seat - and leaving her headphones in - tries to get some shut-eye. And up in the cockpit while on autopilot - First Officer LeRoy Homer talks to Captain Jason Dahl as they eat their meals from plastic trays about a London holiday he's planning for his wife and their new 11-month old baby. Every scene is humdrum - and of course real - and therefore incredibly unsettling...Second is the cast. There are no big names in the lead roles (some of the actors are vaguely familiar like Christian Clemenson from ""Boston Legal"" but most are not). Greengrass then combines their largely unknown faces with real people who were actually there on the day - Ben Sliney of Herndon Air-Traffic Control, Thomas Roberts of Boston ATC, Curt Applejack of New York ATC and Major John Fox heads up the military. Along with other staff members, the effect is like watching the events unfold in front of you - but in real-time.The music by JOHN POWELL is also used sparingly - but when it's applied - it packs either an incredibly sinister punch or ups your pulse-rate big time.Then there's the astonishing editing. The camera moves behind people's heads as they run down corridors - we get momentary glimpses of worried faces through gaps in clothing - there's close-ups on sweating foreheads which then in turn pull back onto disbelieving faces. There's side profiles of personnel constantly making and answering phonecalls - desperately trying to get a grip on the escalating panic. Speech quickens as the chaos escalates - and it all ratchets up the tension to the nines. So when the horror finally comes - it's devastating.The first sign of trouble is American Airlines Flight 11, which stops responding to hails from Air-Traffic Control and then disappears off radar over New York (it's gone into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre). Then an officer examines a tape of what was transmitted from the cockpit - he works out that the word 'planes' is used and not 'plane' - as in plural. With 4000 aircraft in the sky - their terror is palpable. Then it gets really ugly. The second of the hijacked aircraft (United 175) finally appears on the New York skyline outside their observation tower. But instead of making an emergency landing - and as they watch - it flies at escalated speed and smashes directly into the South Tower - bursting into flames. Now both buildings are on fire. The moment of silent disbelief that follows in the Control Room is heart-stopping.The script is fast and punchy too. Wisely Greengrass avoided conspiracy theories in his construction but did include factual details. The American military's Airforce NORAD was conducting a drill on that morning (of all mornings) and was informed by the FAA of the hijackings. At 08:46 a.m. they scrambled four F-15 fighter planes from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts to enter New York airspace, but politicians denied them 'engage' orders. Controversy has raged ever since. But again, Greengrass doesn't discuss this. He just shows the pandemonium at every level of authority while at the same time concentrating on what matters - the 'people' - and especially their eventual bravery - when they realized they weren't going to be any negotiations and they had to stop fanatics killing even more innocents.Some words now on the bonus material - the 2006 UK single DVD had 3 'Extras' - ""United 93: The Families And The Film"" (60-minutes), a feature-length commentary by Paul Greengrass and ""Memorial Pages"" - passengers and crew remembered with 40 written biographies. However, an American 2 DVD set put out in 2007 provided more. Added on were - ""Flight 93 National Memorial"", ""Chasing Planes - Witnesses To 9/11"" and ""Twin Towers"". This BLU RAY has all 6 features. The ""Families"" documentary in particular is extraordinary - where the actors meet the families with often beautiful results. Those who've lost someone are permanently hurting people - and acknowledgement/discussion of this by anyone other than the authorities (who have to appear to care) is hugely cathartic. In between the interviews are a lot of family photos and home movies - so be prepared for sadness as well as celebration.To sum up - given the ultra-sensitivity of the material - ""United 93"" is a fantastic film and a major achievement for all involved. It's also a worthy reissue in Universal's 100th Anniversary series on BLU RAY/DVD with well thought-out and fitting extras that both enhance and inform.I just wish it hadn't taken so many lost lives to produce something of worth and beauty.

Apparently collated and posted by a fan that wanted to say something about the atrocity on its 10th Anniversary - the video uses one of this superlative Scottish band's lesser-known tunes - ""Regret"". The song originally turned up as a UK non-album B-side to the 12"" single of the ""Tinseltown In The Rain"" from 1984 on Linn Records. It's only LP/CD appearance to my knowledge is a 1991 compilation called ""The Tree And The Bird And The Fish And The Bell - Glasgow Songs By Glasgow Artists"". It's hard to find but worth hunting down.""Regret"" is played against a backdrop of black and white images from that tragic event. Recorded years before in a country some 6000 miles away (and of course about something entirely different) it somehow fits perfectly - both musically and lyrically.

644247,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JOZI,Mark,"[21, 26]","Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) had a very difficult job in making this film, especially since the film deals with a shaky topic that is still fresh in everyone's mind.  That being said, Greengrass makes all the right choices, from casting to writing to the exceptional camera work.  Most people know the basic gist of 9/11, but United 93 fills in all of the details and gives a framework and timeline of events, all while still giving the viewer just enough time to really care for the characters.  Now, it probably wasn't that tough to get viewers to care for these people, especially since 9/11 affected every United States citizen in one way or another.  The first half of the film really doesn't even deal with United Flight 93, except for showing a few short clips in between action, just to remind us that they are still there.  The first half deals with the other flights that were hijacked, namely American Airlines Flight 11 and another United flight.  There are a few different locations and traffic control centers in the movie, but the main control station, that is, the one the film spends the most time in, is the one headed by air traffic controller Ben Sliney (playing himself in the first Oscar worthy performance of the year).  The interesting thing about the control centers is that I had no idea what any of these people were saying, mainly because of all of the airline jargon going on.  However, I still knew what was happening.  No one had to tell me what was going on.  In fact, if I didn't know the context of the dialogue, I probably would have no idea of what these people are saying.  The first hour of the film is incredibly tense.  Greengrass wastes no time in getting to the action.  There is a lull after the first hour (for about thirty minutes) where nothing major happens with developing hijackings or United 93, which gave me time to notice Greengrass' camera techniques that I didn't notice before (because of the tension).  It was probably a good thing that Greengrass elevated the tension in the film, because the camera work is so out of control (it reminds me of Tony Scott's Domino) that it gave me a headache.  The cameras never fix upon a certain point for more than three or four seconds which makes it kind of hard for the brain to latch on to anything.  At first, I was kind of annoyed, but after thinking about it, the camera work made the film that much better.  It gives the viewer a chance to feel like he or she is actually in the film.  It gives a sense of urgency and panic felt by everyone in the film.  The headache is nothing compared to the feelings felt by everyone involved on the ground, as well as on United 93.  Greengrass also chose to cast unknown people in the film, another wise decision.  It alieviates some of that connection that goes along with big movie star power.  It's also a lower budget film which gives a sense of authenticity.  This is by no means a negative critique of big budget films, but rather a promotion of smaller films with smaller casts.  If you are interested in a big budget production of 9/11, Oliver Stone is releasing a blockbuster event called World Trade Center starring Nicholas Cage (The Weather Man), Michael Pena (Crash), and Maria Bello (A History of Violence) set to come out later this year.  Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece, and I should think that this is a film worthy of anyone's top ten (even mine) at the end of this year (although it is still very early and this is no way a guarantee).  United 93 is an amazing story of courage, fueled with tension, anxiety, strong emotion, and filmed with nothing but respect.",5,The best film so far this year,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,3650,"['Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'especially', 'film', 'deals', 'shaky', 'topic', 'still', 'fresh', 'everyone', 'mind', 'being', 'said', 'Greengrass', 'right', 'choices', 'casting', 'writing', 'exceptional', 'camera', 'work', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'basic', 'gist', '9/11', 'United', '93', 'fills', 'details', 'framework', 'timeline', 'events', 'still', 'giving', 'viewer', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'Now', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'tough', 'get', 'viewers', 'care', 'people', 'especially', '9/11', 'affected', 'United', 'States', 'citizen', 'one', 'way', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'deal', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'showing', 'few', 'short', 'clips', 'action', 'just', 'remind', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'first', 'half', 'deals', 'other', 'flights', 'were', 'hijacked', 'namely', 'American', 'Airlines', 'Flight', '11', 'United', 'flight', 'are', 'few', 'different', 'locations', 'traffic', 'control', 'centers', 'movie', 'main', 'control', 'station', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'headed', 'air', 'traffic', 'controller', 'Ben', 'Sliney', 'playing', 'first', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'year', 'interesting', 'thing', 'control', 'centers', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'mainly', 'airline', 'jargon', 'going', 'However', 'still', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'one', 'had', 'tell', 'was', 'going', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'context', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'incredibly', 'tense', 'Greengrass', 'time', 'getting', 'action', 'lull', 'first', 'hour', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'where', 'nothing', 'major', 'happens', 'developing', 'hijackings', 'United', '93', 'gave', 'time', 'notice', 'Greengrass', 'camera', 'techniques', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'tension', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'Greengrass', 'elevated', 'tension', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'control', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Domino', 'gave', 'headache', 'cameras', 'never', 'certain', 'point', 'more', 'three', 'four', 'seconds', 'kind', 'hard', 'brain', 'latch', 'anything', 'first', 'was', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'thinking', 'camera', 'work', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'viewer', 'chance', 'feel', 'actually', 'film', 'sense', 'urgency', 'panic', 'felt', 'everyone', 'film', 'headache', 'nothing', 'compared', 'feelings', 'felt', 'everyone', 'involved', 'ground', 'as', 'well', 'United', '93', 'Greengrass', 'also', 'chose', 'cast', 'unknown', 'people', 'film', 'wise', 'decision', 'connection', 'along', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'power', 'also', 'lower', 'budget', 'film', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'negative', 'critique', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'rather', 'promotion', 'smaller', 'films', 'smaller', 'casts', 'are', 'interested', 'big', 'budget', 'production', '9/11', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'releasing', 'blockbuster', 'event', 'called', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'starring', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Weather', 'Man', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Crash', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'set', 'come', 'out', 'later', 'year', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'think', 'film', 'worthy', 'anyone', 'top', 'ten', 'even', 'mine', 'end', 'year', 'still', 'very', 'early', 'way', 'guarantee', 'United', '93', 'amazing', 'story', 'courage', 'fueled', 'tension', 'anxiety', 'strong', 'emotion', 'filmed', 'nothing', 'respect']",United 93

It was like nothing that has happened before in human history.Much of the power of United 93 is the knowledge that while people cannot realistically imagine themselves with the Spartans at Thermopylae or the Texans at the Alamo, just about everyone has flown in an air liner. Everyone seeing this film can imagine themselves among those brave but doomed passengers, fighting with the courage of desperation for the right to get home alive.Though one knows what must happen in the film, one to the very last finds oneself praying for a different outcome, one in which the passengers seized back the plane and somehow flew it to safety at some nearby air field.

I had only moved here from the UK 8 months previous, but even so, found myself searching high and low for a US Flag to hang outside my house to show my patriotism.  This was a traumatic film to make - which may explain why it had to be made by two European Companies - Working Title & Studio Canal, rather than a US company (Yes Universal is American, but they are the Distributor, not the maker).  It is probably still to traumatic for most Americans to comprehend - let alone recreate.The movie is excellent, and it is nice to be able to see that at least two of these low-lifes were unable to see the destruction of those onboard - they got beaten to death.  Also, the fact that many of the individuals play themselves - including FAA and Military personnel.  This allows them to accurately bring their true emotions and reactions to the screen.  I truly found myself on the edge of my seat - which is a very rare occurance.It is an emotional journey, and I am glad the film was made.

644251,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B00005JOZI,M. B. Trapp,"[22, 24]","I do not know how many people will have the sort of reaction that my wife and I had after watching United 93, the new film about the ""fight that fought back"" on September 11, but I suspect there will be many. I've been mulling over how I ought to approach this review, as there are actually two main avenues I could take. I could focus either on the film as a film: the acting, the directing, the score, the quality of the overall storytelling, or I could focus on my own emotional reaction: the actual phenomenology, we might say, of watching the movie. I have decided to focus on both routes.Anyone who knows me is aware that I am a guy with a (fairly) even keel. I can count on one hand the movies that have actually made me shed a tear. And even then, it is usually one tear, perhaps two. But last night during the finale of United 93, my face was wet, and it took a tremendous effort of will not to lose my composure completely. This result was the culmination of experiencing a film that literally had a physical effect on me. I know no other way to describe it. There were moments in the movie when my body physically shook and my stomach rolled itself into knots. At the halfway point I got a painful headache in the front of my head. I'm not sure if it was due to the incredible and harrowing sense of tension the first half of the movie builds, but I would say it's possible. Walking out of the theater afterwards I was speechless. I felt as if I was in a state of mild shock. I felt physically exhausted, and I had trouble keeping my mind on the road as we drove home.Now if you think this sort of reaction is silly or overemotional, you could certainly be right. But my point is that I am rarely moved in this way, especially by a Hollywood film. I love movies, but I am also aware that 99% of the sewage that Hollywood spews out is worthless. So you could say I'm a bit jaded about the movie industry. The fact, however, is that United 93 is a masterstroke of cinema, a film of coarse emotional power and authentic human drama. It is, at its heart, a tragic story, not in the sense of a classical tragedy, of course, but in the sense of being deep down a very sad story, a story of ordinary people forced against their wills into kill-or-be-killed survival mode.As for the quality of the movie itself, I only have a few things to say. First, the director Paul Greengrass has established himself here as one of the truly great directors working today. His refusal to dramatize, fictionalize, or otherwise romanticize the events of that infamous day does not detract from the emotional potency of the film but intensifies it. He breaks a thousand and one rules of drama and yet it is precisely this rule-breaking that works. For example, a general rule of drama is that the audience must come to care about the characters, and the only way to achieve that is that they must come to know the characters. We should know their name, their background, the events in their past that have shaped them to be the people they are today, etc. Greengrass will have none of that. In fact the characters are almost anonymous; we hardly ever hear their names, and they do not address one another by name because they do not know what those names are. I had to go to IMDB to find out who each character was. The only person recognizable by his actions is Todd Beamer, who utters the infamous ""Let's roll"" line. And yet it works. Perhaps it is because these events are still so close to our minds, but I think it is also because Greengrass goes for such a real world feel. If you saw a man on the street fighting for his life and bleeding to death, would you be less affected because you did not know his family history? It is the same here. These are real people, not superheroes or kung fu masters. They are fathers in golf shirts who are pressed into an unfathomably tragic situation.Second, in portraying the circumstances of the hijacking and the violent rejoinder by the passengers, Greengrass uses the same technique that James Cameron did in Titanic: he portrays it all in real time. Thus from the moment the passengers board to the ill-fated finale, the audience experiences the events just as the passengers did. There are no quick cuts to represent the passage of time. The other planes hit their targets on the same schedule that they did on September 11. Just as it was in Titanic, this real-time drama is especially effective, and I have no idea why. It also gives Greengrass the chance to focus on the strategic decisions made by the warring parties on the planes. Had the terrorists made their move a few minutes earlier, the plane would have had a shorter trip to its target destination, the other planes would have hit their respective targets farther along in the timeline of the United 93 hijacking, the passengers would not have found out about the World Trade Center and the Pentagon from their relatives, and the plane would have hit its intended target in Washington. In its own way the story provides excellent examples, both good and bad, of leadership and strategic decision making.Third, Greengrass' use of largely unknown actors is an excellent move, and the performances by the actors themselves are remarkable. Consider their task: they must portray grown men and women who are in one moment concerned with their stocks and their jobs, and in the next must choose between shedding the blood of other men or dying themselves in the process. In their faces there is above all one emotion: fear. Even as they prepare for their attack with whatever makeshift weapons they can find, there are tears in their eyes. And when they attack there is an animal fervor to their actions; it is violence which is bred from the innate will to survive. The hijackers are perhaps the most convincing of all. Other reviews have said that Greengrass makes them ""human,"" but I do not see how. They are human in that they walk upright and wear clothes, but when they begin cutting the throats of their fellow passengers I saw them as nothing but man-devils driven by a wicked and lying ideology.The final moments of the film are unforgettable. Much has been said about the way in which Greengrass fills in the blanks of the largely unknown events, but the finale is so frenzied and chaotic it is hard to tell what is happening anyway. And yet we know exactly what is happening: men are fighting and dying as they have done for untold thousands of years, leaving behind loved ones and children and a shaken citizenry.One final note. It occurred to me while watching the film how the person who hates religion must feel. If you are raised in a secular home with little or no religion and you view the religion-fueled actions of these young men and other terrorists like them, it must seem that religion itself is an inherently dangerous thing. But of course there is another side to the story. For if God exists, then certainly not everything done in His name is done in His will. For whatever evils are done in His name, there must also be a reckoning for those evils by God Himself, at the very least for the sin of denigrating His name and His glory. The cruelty with which religious men conduct themselves does not prove that all religion is bad, but that only some manifestations of religion is. Without the rest, there could be no proper judgment of the former.",5,Moving and poignant - truly a great effort by Greengrass,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,7369,"['do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'many',

In his re-telling of the chilling and poignant story of the passengers on that fateful flight ""United 93,"" he once again has produced a detailed, obviously carefully researched story that shows us probably more than we actually want to see: for so much of it is painfully personal and tragic.One interesting choice that Greengrass makes is to stay away, almost completely, from naming anyone on board the airplane. He chooses instead to treat those that successfully overrun the terrorists as a whole: a democratic them against us mentality that robs us from completely investing emotionally in any one in particular. It's a bold move but also one that distances rather than brings us closer.""United 93"" begins very matter-of factly: the four terrorists going about their ritual cleansing and prayer in preparation of their horrible deed, at the airport people standing in line waiting to check in, the ground crew preparing the plane, the pilots and attendants kibitzing: very calm, very ordinary...only the terrorists know what is to occur. But more to the point, the ordinary passengers on flight 93 returning home, on a business trip, on vacation who think they are boarding a routine flight, have no idea what they will be forced to endure and to what they will be asked to react. Therein lays the drama of this film: people like you and I transformed, out of necessity and circumstances beyond our control, into heroes.Greengrass films this story as close to real time as possible. The drama unfolds as it happens and the film's genius is that none of this feels manipulated: when the owlish, round-faced passenger says ""no one is going to help us...we must do this ourselves"" the action unravels naturally...without pretense without manufactured ""drama.""""United 93"" is on many levels horrifying, upsetting and depressing.

644256,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JOZI,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[5, 8]","Director Paul Greengrass has accomplished the difficult task of making what will possibly be the definitive filmed version of the unthinkable events surrounding Flight United 93 on September 11, 2001.United 93 does not offer analysis or explanation. The movie just lives inside those astonished 90 minutes of horror between one moment and the next one.The film takes place in virtual real time, cutting among the events on-board United Flight 93, which was the only plane of the four hijacked that morning not to reach its target, and the escalating confusion on the ground. As much as 9/11 was a worldwide televised event, Greengrass manages to evoke new horrors by taking us inside the confusion, showing us how the scenario was slowly put together by those who were in a position to do something about it.There is a masochistic quality to watching the film, as we enter the theater knowing fully well aware of the horrors we are about to witness. For we all know, or think we know, how the story of United 93 comes out.But what happens at the end of the story? Greengrass evidently disagrees with Bush's implications that the passengers committed an act of self-immolation. In the director's vision, the passengers have a naive idea of using a passenger, a trained pilot, to bring the plane down to the ground. But it's clear that Greengrass's refuses to confirm that without the passengers' action they would have hit the Capitol. On the contrary, his script shows the terrorists making a miscalculation of their own.The film develops slowly, beginning in the early morning hours as the four hijackers prepare themselves for what they feel it's their duty. We get images of Newark airport, the passengers, unaware that they future does not behold a happy ending. The air traffic controllers, several of whom are portrayed by their real-life counterparts, are going about their everyday business until the horror shows in their screens.From there, the film escalates as we know it did, until Greengrass finally abandons the world on the ground and concentrates the film's final moments entirely on the plane. It is here that Greengrass's amazing restraint and respect shows up, as he presents the victims as a group of terrified people facing a certain death making a desperate decision to change their own fate. There are no goofy-corny subplots and made up characters. There is no sense of heroism or national duty, but rather the jittery, horrifying sense of seeing your own death approaching. It's hard, it's sad and overwhelming, but still, it's something that we should see, so we never forget the horrors those innocent human beings were exposed without any justification.",5,A respectful memorial,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2682,"['Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'accomplished', 'difficult', 'task', 'making', 'what', 'will', 'possibly', 'be', 'definitive', 'filmed', 'version', 'unthinkable', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Flight', 'United', '93', 'September', '11', '2001.United', '93', 'not', 'offer', 'analysis', 'explanation', 'movie', 'just', 'inside', 'astonished', '90', 'minutes', 'horror', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'one.The', 'film', 'place', 'virtual', 'real', 'time', 'cutting', 'events', 'on-board', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'was', 'only', 'plane', 'four', 'hijacked', 'morning', 'not', 'reach', 'target', 'escalating', 'confusion', 'ground', 'As', 'much', '9/11', 'was', 'worldwide', 'televised', 'event', 'Greengrass', 'evoke', 'new', 'horrors', 'taking', 'confusion', 'showing', 'how', 'scenario', 'was', 'slowly', 'put', 'together', 'who', 'were', 'position', 'do', 'something', 'it.There', 'masochistic', 'quality', 'watching', 'film', 'enter', 'theater', 'knowing', 'fully', 'well', 'aware', 'horrors', 'are', 'witness', 'know', 'think', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'United', '93', 'out.But', 'what', 'end', 'story', 'Greengrass', 'evidently', 'Bush', 'implications', 'passengers', 'committed', 'act', 'self-immolation', 'director', 'vision', 'passengers', 'have', 'naive', 'idea', 'using', 'passenger', 'trained', 'pilot', 'bring', 'plane', 'down', 'ground', 'clear', 'Greengrass', 'refuses', 'confirm', 'passengers', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'Capitol', 'contrary', 'script', 'terrorists', 'making', 'miscalculation', 'own.The', 'film', 'slowly', 'beginning', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'four', 'hijackers', 'prepare', 'what', 'feel', 'duty', 'get', 'images', 'Newark', 'airport', 'passengers', 'unaware', 'future', 'not', 'behold', 'happy', 'ending', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'several', 'whom', 'are', 'portrayed', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'are', 'going', 'everyday', 'business', 'horror', 'screens.From', 'there', 'film', 'know', 'did', 'Greengrass', 'finally', 'world', 'ground', 'film', 'final', 'moments', 'entirely', 'plane', 'here', 'Greengrass', 'amazing', 'restraint', 'respect', 'up', 'victims', 'group', 'terrified', 'people', 'facing', 'certain', 'death', 'making', 'desperate', 'decision', 'change', 'own', 'fate', 'are', 'goofy-corny', 'subplots', 'made', 'up', 'characters', 'sense', 'heroism', 'national', 'duty', 'rather', 'jittery', 'horrifying', 'sense', 'seeing', 'own', 'death', 'approaching', 'hard', 'sad', 'overwhelming', 'still', 'something', 'should', 'see', 'never', 'forget', 'horrors', 'innocent', 'human', 'beings', 'were', 'exposed', 'justification']",United 93

644258,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JOZI,mirasreviews,"[4, 4]","I put off seeing ""United 93"" for a long time, thinking it might be either sensational or self-pitying. But when I finally did sit down to watch this movie, I found it thoughtful and absorbing. British filmmaker Paul Greenberg wrote and directed ""United 93"" in a docudrama style that hasn't been employed this successfully in decades. He populated the film with real pilots, real flight attendants, real air traffic controllers, and real military professionals, some of them also actors, who lend authenticity to the recreations. The scenes in the air traffic control centers were filmed in real time, as the participants and actors reenacted the morning of September 11, 2001. Ben Sliney, who was in charge at the National Air Traffic Command Center that day, reprises his own role compellingly. The result is an extraordinary film that is at once riveting drama and an important contribution to the continually unfolding aftermath of 9/11.""United 93"" recreates 1 hour and 51 minutes of the morning of September 11, 2001, much of it in real time -though the beginning of the film seems compressed, as passengers and flight crew arrive at the airport and board the plane. The action shifts between United Airlines Flight 93, the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, VA, the air traffic control towers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, and the Northeast Air Defense Center (NORAD) in Rome, New York. The first hour gives us an inside look at air traffic and military professionals as they struggle to understand what is going on and implement some sort of response. The film demonstrates an acute awareness of the systems on which our modern world depend and the fragility that became apparent when a group of determined individuals decided to assault our modernity.No one knows precisely what went on on United Flight 93. Paul Greenberg assumed the delicate job of creating ""a believable truth"" for an event that is deeply steeped in politics and mythology. Greenberg was up to the task, and ""United 93"" could not be better. Sensitive without melodrama, suspenseful instead of sensational, reflective but not passive, ""United 93"" fulfills the need to understand and memorialize the events of September 11, 2001, for the families of the deceased, for Americans of all political stripes, and for a culture that still struggles to put these events in context and to decipher their implications. That's a tall order, and I could not praise ""United 93"" more highly for delivering on it.The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): In ""United 93: The Families and the Film"" (1 hour), some families of passengers who perished on United 93 talk about their loved ones and meet the actors who play their family members in the movie. ""Memorial Pages"" (text) are a list of the 30 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 with a bio of each. ""Twin Towers"" (2 min) is a promotion of a short documentary about 2 brothers, one policeman and one firefighter, who responded to the World Trade Center on 9/11. The audio commentary by Paul Greenberg is thoughtful and worthwhile, especially the first half. The second half is a bit repetitive. He talks about the film's structure, what he left out and why, technical challenges, and comments a great deal on the film's ideas. He unfortunately doesn't say which parts of the action on board Flight 93 is fact and what was extrapolated. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, Spanish.

644259,A32J48LYJ2BNNY,B00005JOZI,Monty Rainey,"[16, 36]","Prior to its release, the movie generated a fire storm of controversy. There has already been a lot of people trying to convince the world that it's too soon to release this movie. I have an answer to anyone who believes it is too soon to see this movie. DON'T WATCH IT! For the rest of the world, who believe we should remember all the victims of 9/11 every single day for the rest of our lives, do not wait any longer to see this film. There are no new revelations being told here. The movie is accurate to the letter of the information that has been previously document and memorialized of that horrific days' events. I was surprised and pleased to see that the ineptness of the FAA and nearly a decade of ambivalence towards military preparedness was accurately documented.As much as I loved seeing the movie, it cannot go without a small degree of criticism. Though the casting was pretty good, and the movie was presented without editorializing, the filming itself was below average. The somewhat ""new-age"" technique of using a shaky hand-held camera detracts from the film. Also, the ""made for TV"" dramatization of showing close-ups, which cut off the top of the head and the neck, may indeed have a certain dramatic effect for some people, but I found it rather annoying.Regardless of the movie's shortcomings, however, this is a must see movie. I was touched deeply by the portrayal of emotions the passengers of United 93 must surely have felt. I was also deeply touched by the theater audience. The ending of this movie, though we all know the tragic ending, will rip abruptly rip at your soul. It had the effect of leaving the entire audience in beleaguered and mournful silence.The fact that there are those among us who want to forget the memory of 9/11, or who want to tell us it is too soon to see a movie like this, is a sad testament to the moral decay of our society and reveals the pitiful state of the very fabric upon which our country was built. Let us never forget what happened on 9/11. And let us never forget the memories of the innocent passengers of United 93, as well as flights 11, 77 and 175.  It was a day when America lost her innocence. A day we were attacked.

While I understand those emotions, on viewingthis film, I think it is worth noting that the families ofthose involved were, judging from the commentary, positivelyinvolved in this film.To me, this film is really a variation on a theme in warmovies - the decision to engage in a high risk battle withthe hopes of ultimately minimizing casualties.

644270,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B00005JOZI,o dubhthaigh,"[24, 31]","I happened to see this film in Paris, with a largely Muslim audience. My esteem for Paul Greengrass as a director and writer is so profoundly deep that I can give you no other recommendation than that even those superficially unsympathetic to the colonial bravado of the present US regime were moved to stunned silence and mute weeping.Greengrass is the finest political docu=drama film maker since Nikos Costa-Gavres, whose increasingly accurate portrayals of what may have gone on behind the scenes of political murder made him a target in his own Greece, as well as Pinochet's Chile and Nixon's Amerika. Greengrass has distinguished himself as a first rate film director, and especially as an unflinching witness to truth with his remarkable BLOODY SUNDAY,  the very best film about what started all the bloodshed in the latter half of the 20th Century in Northern Ireland. That film upset all the guilty parties: IRA, UVF, Sinn Fein, DUP, the Brits. Innocent people were gunned down in the name of religio-political extremism. No less an authority on such matters as Jesus Christ himself warned that religion and politics don't mix. At all. Ever. He paid for refusing to politically galvanize his followers to the will of either the Pharisees, the Sanhedrin or the Romans with his life, and the world's been bollixed since.In the case of 9/11, disenfranchisement led to the usurpation of religious devotion to further an extreme fanaticism, whose motives as practiced in Afghanistan were extremely less than pure. Innocent people board a plane to go to work, go home, go visit, as uninvolved with the circumstances that led to the grievances as any group of people could be. Within minutes, at the scene of mid-air murder, they were ushered to the threshold of the ultimate ethical choice. Socrates could not have imagined a more profound moment. Men and women of the crew lay dead or dying, their throats slashed. Word had come to the passengers that they were being abducted to further more carnage as had already visited a couple of thousand busboys, waiters, potwashers, cops, firemen in NY. Their response went beyond mere heroism. To give up one's life to prevent many others from dying innocently is a sacrifice of such profound reverence that all the politics on either side of this issue are humbled.Greengrass takes raw material from various accounts and in his cinema-verite, real time style crafts the movement of courage and reverence as it rises to the task at hand. There is definitely a second hijacking going on here as well, and the Muslim actors who portray the villains do so without pandering to stereotype.And maybe that is what rattled the crowd in Paris. It must have struck the audience that how and why religious tenets that were at one point meant to direct the human spirit to the contemplation of the more essential Being could be pornographically corrupted to contemplate and execute mass murder is cause for profound sorrow. And that's as true for Islam as it is for Judaism, Christianity and Hinduism. I'll give the Buddhists a walk on this as they seem to have gotten the point of non-violence.In Greengrass's film, there is cause for tears and cause for admiration. It is painful to see the recognition of the fate before them among villains and heroes alike. That life should come to these choices is tragedy for Humanity, not just a nation or a cause.Where is the solution? As one Muslim gentleman said to me on the way out, if these passengers could find the courage to revere life and make the ethical choice, can not we also find the courage to make the ethical choice to meet and resolve our differences. Of course, years ago, this very man had authored a song called ""Peace Train.""Go see this film with your family.",5,"Reverence, the forgotten virtue",1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,3760,"['happened', 'see', 'film', 'Paris', 'largely', 'Muslim', 'audience', 'esteem', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'director', 'writer', 'so', 'profoundly', 'deep', 'can', 'give', 'other', 'recommendation', 'even', 'superficially', 'unsympathetic', 'colonial', 'bravado', 'present', 'US', 'regime', 'were', 'moved', 'stunned', 'silence', 'mute', 'weeping.Greengrass', 'finest', 'political', 'docu=drama', 'film', 'maker', 'Nikos', 'Costa-Gavres', 'increasingly', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'scenes', 'political', 'murder', 'made', 'target', 'own', 'Greece', 'as', 'well', 'Pinochet', 'Chile', 'Nixon', 'Amerika', 'Greengrass', 'distinguished', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'director', 'especially', 'unflinching', 'witness', 'truth', 'remarkable', 'BLOODY', 'SUNDAY', 'very', 'best', 'film', 'what', 'started', 'bloodshed', 'latter', 'half', '20th', 'Century', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'film', 'guilty', 'parties', 'IRA', 'UVF', 'Sinn', 'Fein', 'DUP', 'Brits', 'Innocent', 'people', 'were', 'gunned', 'down', 'name', 'religio-political', 'extremism', 'No', 'authority', 'such', 'matters', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'warned', 'religion', 'politics', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'Ever', 'paid', 'refusing', 'politically', 'galvanize', 'followers', 'will', 'Pharisees', 'Sanhedrin', 'Romans', 'life', 'world', 'been', 'bollixed', 'case', '9/11', 'disenfranchisement', 'led', 'usurpation', 'religious', 'devotion', 'further', 'extreme', 'fanaticism', 'motives', 'practiced', 'Afghanistan', 'were', 'extremely', 'less', 'pure', 'Innocent', 'people', 'board', 'plane', 'go', 'work', 'go', 'home', 'go', 'visit', 'uninvolved', 'circumstances', 'led', 'grievances', 'group', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'Within', 'minutes', 'scene', 'mid-air', 'murder', 'were', 'ushered', 'threshold', 'ultimate', 'ethical', 'choice', 'Socrates', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'more', 'profound', 'moment', 'Men', 'women', 'crew', 'lay', 'dead', 'dying', 'throats', 'slashed', 'Word', 'had', 'come', 'passengers', 'were', 'being', 'abducted', 'further', 'more', 'carnage', 'had', 'already', 'visited', 'couple', 'thousand', 'busboys', 'waiters', 'potwashers', 'cops', 'firemen', 'NY', 'response', 'went', 'mere', 'heroism', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'life', 'prevent', 'many', 'others', 'dying', 'innocently', 'sacrifice', 'such', 'profound', 'reverence', 'politics', 'side', 'issue', 'are', 'humbled.Greengrass', 'raw', 'material', 'various', 'accounts', 'cinema-verite', 'real', 'time', 'style', 'movement', 'courage', 'reverence', 'task', 'hand', 'definitely', 'second', 'hijacking', 'going', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Muslim', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'villains', 'do', 'so', 'pandering', 'stereotype.And', 'maybe', 'rattled', 'crowd', 'Paris', 'must', 'have', 'struck', 'audience', 'how', 'why', 'religious', 'tenets', 'were', 'one', 'point', 'meant', 'direct', 'human', 'spirit', 'contemplation', 'more', 'essential', 'Being', 'could', 'be', 'pornographically', 'corrupted', 'contemplate', 'execute', 'mass', 'murder', 'cause', 'profound', 'sorrow', 'as', 'true', 'Islam', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'Hinduism', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Buddhists', 'walk', 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'point', 'non-violence.In', 'Greengrass', 'film', 'cause', 'tears', 'cause', 'admiration', 'painful', 'see', 'recognition', 'fate', 'villains', 'heroes', 'alike', 'life', 'should', 'come', 'choices', 'tragedy', 'Humanity', 'not', 'just', 'nation', 'cause.Where', 'solution', 'one', 'Muslim', 'gentleman', 'said', 'way', 'passengers', 'could', 'find', 'courage', 'revere', 'life', 'make', 'ethical', 'choice', 'can', 'not', 'also', 'find', 'courage', 'make', 'ethical', 'choice', 'meet', 'resolve', 'differences', 'course', 'years', 'ago', 'very', 'man', 'had', 'authored', 'song', 'called', 'Peace', 'Train', 'Go', 'see', 'film', 'family']",United 93

As a low level technician, whose responsibilities included the main conference AV equipment, we turned on the giant screen in the main building and watched the smoke coming out of the tower on the 15 x 15 foot screen. At that moment, before the second plane hit and before anyone knew what was coming, it was all unbelievable and surreal. Who could have fathomed that men would use passenger planes to destroy so many innocent civilians? Who could have conceived what men were so willing to kill for?I watched this movie on DVD. While watching the film, I had to stop and take breaks to gather my thoughts and break the stress, even before any of the ""violence"" or ""action"" began in the film. Watching the control centers' scrambling with the unknown and unthinkable was too much like real life. I can sympathize with these men and women working in confusion. It's easy to look back with 20/20 hindsight and say, ""They should have known."" But on that day, with nothing ever happening like this before in history, you have to understand - most of us had no idea. This event was not even a horrific scenario that most of us had ever dreamt of as an option. It was ludacris. A common reaction watching this film is probably viewers like me wanting to yell back in time, ""It's for real.""""Art is the signature of civilizations."" - Beverly Sills. ""The role of art is to make a world which can be inhabited."" - William Saroyan. ""Art is the triumph over chaos."" - John Cheever. This film is a work of art. Hopefully, this film will bring more humane responses to the insane rationales men think up to hurt and kill one another.There is a scene in the movie ""Sunshine,"" staring Ralph Fiennes, where 1500 men in a concentration camp watch and do nothing as one of the prisoners is beaten, hung from a tree naked, then very slowly frozen to death with water from a garden hose. One of the prisoners is later asked, ""Why did you do nothing when there were only 14 guards?""I admire the passengers on flight United 93 who chose to fight, but who did NOT choose to be martyrs. They saw fellow passengers dying around them. They reasonably could see the hijackers were likely going to crash the plane into a building and take more lives. My guess is that if there would have been ANY other way to prevent the imminent harm, they would not have given up their lives. But when faced with the choices they had, they took the actions that might preserve their own life and almost assuredly would save many more lives. They did not want to harm or kill themselves in pursuit of a cause. They were FIGHTING TO LIVE, knowing their choice may lead to their deaths. And to fail to understand that distinction is to not give sufficient honor to their honorable choices and deaths.",5,Fighting to Live,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,2953,"['was', 'working', 'National', 'Emergency', 'Coordination', 'Center', 'morning', 'September', '11th', 'had', 'been', 'duty', 'hour', 'two', 'when', 'news', 'came', 'light', 'plane', 'had', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'low', 'level', 'technician', 'responsibilities', 'included', 'main', 'conference', 'AV', 'equipment', 'turned', 'giant', 'screen', 'main', 'building', 'watched', 'smoke', 'coming', 'tower', '15', '15', 'foot', 'screen', 'moment', 'second', 'plane', 'hit', 'anyone', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'surreal', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'fathomed', 'men', 'would', 'use', 'passenger', 'planes', 'destroy', 'so', 'many', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'conceived', 'what', 'men', 'were', 'so', 'willing', 'kill', 'watched', 'movie', 'DVD', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'stop', 'take', 'breaks', 'gather', 'thoughts', 'break', 'stress', 'even', 'violence', 'action', 'began', 'film', 'Watching', 'control', 'centers', 'scrambling', 'unknown', 'unthinkable', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'sympathize', 'men', 'women', 'working', 'confusion', 'easy', 'look', 'back', '20/20', 'hindsight', 'say', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'day', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happening', 'history', 'have', 'understand', 'most', 'had', 'idea', 'event', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'horrific', 'scenario', 'most', 'had', 'ever', 'dreamt', 'option', 'was', 'ludacris', 'common', 'reaction', 'watching', 'film', 'probably', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'yell', 'back', 'time', 'real', 'Art', 'signature', 'civilizations', 'Beverly', 'Sills', 'role', 'art', 'make', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'inhabited', 'William', 'Saroyan', 'Art', 'triumph', 'chaos', 'John', 'Cheever', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'more', 'humane', 'responses', 'insane', 'men', 'think', 'hurt', 'kill', 'one', 'another.There', 'scene', 'movie', 'Sunshine', 'staring', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'where', '1500', 'men', 'concentration', 'camp', 'watch', 'do', 'nothing', 'one', 'prisoners', 'beaten', 'hung', 'tree', 'naked', 'then', 'very', 'slowly', 'frozen', 'death', 'water', 'garden', 'hose', 'One', 'prisoners', 'later', 'asked', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'nothing', 'when', 'were', 'only', '14', 'guards', 'admire', 'passengers', 'flight', 'United', '93', 'who', 'chose', 'fight', 'who', 'did', 'NOT', 'choose', 'be', 'martyrs', 'saw', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'dying', 'reasonably', 'could', 'see', 'hijackers', 'were', 'likely', 'going', 'crash', 'plane', 'building', 'take', 'more', 'lives', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ANY', 'other', 'way', 'prevent', 'imminent', 'harm', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'lives', 'when', 'faced', 'choices', 'had', 'took', 'actions', 'might', 'preserve', 'own', 'life', 'almost', 'assuredly', 'would', 'save', 'many', 'more', 'lives', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'harm', 'kill', 'pursuit', 'cause', 'were', 'FIGHTING', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'knowing', 'choice', 'may', 'lead', 'deaths', 'fail', 'understand', 'distinction', 'not', 'give', 'sufficient', 'honor', 'honorable', 'choices', 'deaths']",United 93

There is not one wasted frame.The tragic ending that we all know is coming is nevertheless unbearable. It is so well-researched, with all the families on board before production began, that the similarity between actors and victims is eerie.  The depth and sensitivity in their depiction leave the impression the filmmakers left no detail unconsidered from the information gathered from the victims' loved ones. The terrorists are portrayed as complex people in their own right, making final calls on cell phone to their own loved ones, and praying as hard to Allah as the American passengers pray to their Christian God.

Quiet heroism and quick action, as well as critical mistakes and frightening ineptitude by key Americans on the ground, are not overlooked.United 93 is a tribute to the men and women aboard, striving to be as honest as possible based on what we know, avoiding the sensationalism of a Hollywood blockbuster.

This was a VERY powerful device as it stressed that these people could have been any American.  I don't know if the idea of the European passenger wanting NOT to act was a plot device or not, it made me smirk.The actors who played the hijackers were first rate, we of course don't know the mind of these men so the greatest liberties had to be taken with them.  It is a tough role and they pulled it off well.It is Ironic that I saw this movie with my son just after watching Tora Tora Tora.  Even though my father fought in the pacific during the war I found myself reacting very differently to the two movies.  I suspect because one group is reactive (soldiers obeying orders of Japan) and another group who could have at any time decided not to do what they set out to do.As far as my feelings about the movie, I was over a friends house  on Sept 11 playing in a tabletop baseball league.  The planes hitting the towers didn't really phase me as I assumed it was terror, when the news of flight 93 passengers fighting back and stopping that plane from it's target THAT's when it hit me.  The last 5 minutes of this movie fill me with great satisfaction.  I kept finding myself saying don't wait don't wait.

644280,A23VBURIWZPRR2,B00005JOZI,purplehaloz,"[6, 84]","The most impressive aspect of this film is the portrayal of the heroic struggle for control of the plane on the part of the passengers. More films about the tragedy need to be made. The events of 9-11 never should have happened, the people who used the planes as weapons were involved in acts of evil. We need to think very carefully about how to prevent such an occurences in the future.That said, the film itself is unfortunately mediocre from an artistic, even technical, standpoint. The script is heavy-handed, dull and belabored in its obvious reference to the mishandling on the part of those in charge, a fact of which most people are already painfully aware. It is like some children's books that preach but do not enlighten. To enlighten, an artist must instigate or provoke thought as well as stimulate genuine feelings. One without the other misses a vital component of fine art, even fine craft.The film lacks substance. The screenplay is incredibly boring until the last part. Syrupy background music is used as a manipulative crutch. The film is not even up to amateur standards of filmmaking, aside from the rather intriguing view of the plane crashing and the effectively portrayed, heroic behavior of the passengers. I'm not referring to the handheld camera. That technique was developed previously and used skillfully and with purpose on many occasions by various filmmakers including these. Unfortunately, its deft use does not make up for what is otherwise an insipid and heavy-handed screenplay. If there is one rule, it is to not bore an audience. When you have an event such as 9-11 there is so much material to work with, that boredom is quite unnecessary and is in fact a sign of a decidedly poor and lazy, hastily put together piece of work.Additionally, the belabored portrayal of the antagonists praying in Arabic is irresponsible and disrespectful. It was merely necessary to have brief scenes with the prayers, not a neverending stream of it. One must be mindful of younger viewers who may have this film as their first encounter with Arabic people, their language and customs and are especially prone to develop stereotypical views. An analytical framework is the best way to go rather than relying solely upon the shoving of stereotyped behavior of an entire group of people. There has to be a way to tastefully and accurately portray the heinous evil that these particular individuals wrought on that fateful day without resorting to heavy-handed villification of an entire religious or ethnic group. otherwise you are just crying wolf.This film didn't pull it off. No discussion, no background information or scenes with the passengers and their families, nothing new, just the belaboring of already-known points and manipulation of emotions. Again, the saving grace was most clearly the heroic acts of the passengers-turned victims, which is why it get three stars instead of one. That, and the handheld camera save it from the worst rating.More films can and should be made of the horrific events of 9-11. An event that shook this country and made it worse requires a more coherent analysis and careful, painstaking craft if we are to benefit culturally, politically and historically out of the ashes of the evil these hijackers brought to bear.",3,Not the best film on the subject,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,3281,"['most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'film', 'portrayal', 'heroic', 'struggle', 'control', 'plane', 'part', 'passengers', 'More', 'films', 'tragedy', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'events', '9-11', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'people', 'who', 'used', 'planes', 'weapons', 'were', 'involved', 'acts', 'evil', 'need', 'think', 'very', 'carefully', 'how', 'prevent', 'such', 'occurences', 'future.That', 'said', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'mediocre', 'artistic', 'even', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'script', 'heavy-handed', 'dull', 'belabored', 'obvious', 'reference', 'mishandling', 'part', 'charge', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'already', 'painfully', 'aware', 'children', 'books', 'preach', 'do', 'not', 'enlighten', 'enlighten', 'artist', 'must', 'instigate', 'provoke', 'thought', 'as', 'well', 'stimulate', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'One', 'other', 'vital', 'component', 'fine', 'art', 'even', 'fine', 'craft.The', 'film', 'substance', 'screenplay', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'last', 'part', 'Syrupy', 'background', 'music', 'used', 'manipulative', 'crutch', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'amateur', 'standards', 'filmmaking', 'aside', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'view', 'plane', 'crashing', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'heroic', 'behavior', 'passengers', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'handheld', 'camera', 'technique', 'was', 'developed', 'previously', 'used', 'skillfully', 'purpose', 'many', 'occasions', 'various', 'filmmakers', 'including', 'Unfortunately', 'deft', 'use', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'otherwise', 'insipid', 'heavy-handed', 'screenplay', 'one', 'rule', 'not', 'bore', 'audience', 'When', 'have', 'event', 'such', '9-11', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'work', 'boredom', 'quite', 'unnecessary', 'fact', 'sign', 'decidedly', 'poor', 'lazy', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'piece', 'work.Additionally', 'belabored', 'portrayal', 'antagonists', 'praying', 'Arabic', 'irresponsible', 'disrespectful', 'was', 'merely', 'necessary', 'have', 'brief', 'scenes', 'prayers', 'not', 'neverending', 'stream', 'must', 'be', 'mindful', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'film', 'first', 'encounter', 'Arabic', 'people', 'language', 'customs', 'are', 'especially', 'prone', 'develop', 'stereotypical', 'views', 'analytical', 'framework', 'best', 'way', 'go', 'rather', 'relying', 'solely', 'shoving', 'stereotyped', 'behavior', 'entire', 'group', 'people', 'be', 'way', 'tastefully', 'accurately', 'portray', 'heinous', 'evil', 'particular', 'individuals', 'wrought', 'fateful', 'day', 'resorting', 'heavy-handed', 'villification', 'entire', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'group', 'otherwise', 'are', 'just', 'crying', 'wolf.This', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'discussion', 'background', 'information', 'scenes', 'passengers', 'families', 'nothing', 'new', 'just', 'belaboring', 'already-known', 'points', 'manipulation', 'emotions', 'Again', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'most', 'clearly', 'heroic', 'acts', 'passengers-turned', 'victims', 'why', 'get', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'handheld', 'camera', 'save', 'worst', 'rating.More', 'films', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'horrific', 'events', '9-11', 'event', 'shook', 'country', 'made', 'worse', 'more', 'coherent', 'analysis', 'careful', 'painstaking', 'craft', 'are', 'benefit', 'culturally', 'politically', 'historically', 'ashes', 'evil', 'hijackers', 'brought', 'bear']",United 93

I waited for it to come to our town but I kept waiting and waiting until I finally asked the theater owner what the delay was all about.  He said that they weren't going to show it because there hadn't been any demand for it.  I said that he ought to at least show it for a week and find out for sure but it never came.  I had heard that it was intense and realistic and, of course, most of us already knew what ""United 93"" was about just from the title.  I had also heard that it was rather low-budget; no ""names"" in the cast, the camera-work seemed hand-held, and a few other comments that are usually reserved for ""B movies"".  However, despite whatever disclaimers I heard, I also understood that the film had an impact on those who saw it.I rented ""United 93"" the other night and I am still immersed it.  This movie is very professionally made and it grabs you right from the beginning.  There is a lot that we see unfolding before us that we already understand.  It is impressive how the air traffic controllers are intitially curious then mystified then appalled.  The film-makers could have just assumed the audience knew all the background (which we still do) and focus on the lives of the victims leading up to climax of the taking and retaking of the plane.  In other words, they could have made the typical Hollywood disaster film.  By retracing the events of 9/11 sequencially we relived the event and found a conclusion to the one aspect that remained a mystery.I do not know how much the film relied on second-hand witness accounts (the film reminds us of the many calls to loved ones from the passengers on board).  I don't recall if the black box was recovered in tact.  However, I was satisfied with the reaction of the paasengers and their conclusion of hijacking.  These were not people portrayed as heroic.  Rather, they were portrayed like ourselves as people independently traveling for reasons of their own.  The development of a group focus was excellently done and the ultimate sacrifice that they made for ourselves and themselves was the chaotic effort of amateurs with a cause.For many of us, 9/11 was a mixture of anger, sorrow, fear and insecurity.  Yet there was courage and pride in that mix as well.  From the NY Police Departments to the NY Fire Departments to the passengers of United 93 we had a lot to be proud of.

Epstein ""asanisimasa""","[0, 0]","I have to admit, having read the 9/11 Commission's report on the incompetency of those in the FAA and the military, I automatically assumed that they were all severely incompetent individuals. But this film unveils the humanity of these people who did their best under a system that was severely incompetent. As each horrible event unfolded that day, we see their stunned disbelief as it had been reflected in our own faces. They were seeing something they could not have imagined. In fact, when the military got word of the first hijacking on September 11th, their bewildered response was, ""in the real world?"" You see, they were running defense drills at that time against a possible Russian attack via Alaska. To say the world's greatest superpower was out of touch is putting it lightly. It would only take a person in stubborn denial to not realize that had the government who had received over a dozen memos about possible hijackings simply put that info into the official loop with the military and the FAA, the tragedies of September 11th could have been avoided. The cynicism and denial began at the top, when Condi Rice assumed that the word 'determined', as in ""Bin Laden determined to attack US"" meant the same as 'he'd like to', as in ""one day he'd like to visit Tahiti"". Citizens have the liberty to cynically toss out phrases like ""yeah, in his dreams"", but our government has to approach national security issues as if they were living in the real world, and that's what our government was completely out of touch with.But to the film at hand ... It is as streamlined as any major motion picture has ever been, and hopefully a lesson to Hollywood that less is definitely more. I kept wondering where they found so many terrific actors to give such low-key performances until I discovered that most of the performers were 'real people' who worked with the FAA or the military or United Airlines. The long lens shakycam is something that usually drives me batty but it served the film well here since it works as a window into what really happened that day. The cinematography is also outstanding in how it used saturated lighting on the plane to create that sort of everyday haze one feels when they are in the skies flying backwards against time. Every detail was real, including blink or you'll miss 'em touches like the stewardess clutching onto a seat as she was about to be killed; something that we all do in desperate but futile moments when we will grab onto anything or anyone for a feeling of something safe and familiar. And kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the film score minimalist. I would have preferred none at all, but for the most part it is non-obtrusive and thankfully non-sentimental. At the end of the day, this is an excellent chapter in what will hopefully be many chapters that will put that day into its proper context of desperation and humanity.One other note; do check out the bonus features. There are interviews with the surviving family members, and biographies on each of the passengers and crew. Despite the tears that will ensue, it will give you hope because you'll realize how many really wonderful people there are out there. The media always drowns us with details of the wicked, but they barely ever mention people like these passengers; so many of whom had dedicated their lives to saving the planet and to helping those who are less fortunate.

The stories inherent in the events of 9/11 speak for themselves. Even Hollywood has respect for that. Michael Moore, aside, of course.I finally got to see United 93 last night ... on DVD. Recently, I saw World Trade Center on the big screen. No, I didn't cry as much during United 93 as I did during my viewing of WTC ... but it was no less an emotional experience.Both films deal with relatively isolated mini-events within the whole of the terror & horror of the big story of 9-11-01.United 93 is shot with handhelds - providing a very similar viewing experience to that of The Ambush scene in The Last of the Mohicans. Far from distracting, I found it a perfect tool used by the director [Paul Greengrass] to enable the viewer to be completely immersed. It created a sense of confusion, much like the actual participants must have been going through ... was the bomb real or fake; were the 2 pilots dead or just forced to the ground? It was very effective.So, whether the scene was at an air traffic control tower, a military central command post, or on the plane itself, one felt the urgency to act and yet the inability to sometimes do so due to the ""fog of war"". I found myself wanting to shout out ... to change the course of events. It was frustrating. Just as it must have been for some of those participants. Not being able to act ... a plane disappears from radar, next thing you know CNN is showing a smoldering WTC tower.Unlike many ""disaster"" movies, this one had no fluff; no lets-get-to-know-the-characters syrupy dialog. It all just happens before your eyes. Very quickly, too. Before you even realize it has started, the movie is over. The fastest 1 hour and 51 minutes of movie viewing I have ever witnessed.Every American should see these two movies, the Twin Towers, if you will. Every American should reflect upon what they see. There was selfless, heroic action ... Particularly, when the screen finally goes black in United 93, we are reminded of the special gift those who perished on that flight gave to us all that day. They gave their lives, yes, but more importantly, they showed us the way. They came face to face with the enemy, they put any inherent differences aside, they acted ... together ... as one.And, they won.

This is not a ""pleasant"" moving-going experience.  It's wrenching because for me it brought back many of my feelings from 9/11.  Helplessness, anger, sadness.  But it also gave me new respect for the passengers on United 93, and for many of the people in the air traffic control towers who could do little beyond watch helplessly.The movie is more or less in real time.  We aren't introduced to any characters in a predictable way.  No back stories...heck, no names are given for most of the main characters.  It's as though we are ono the plane or in the tower with the people who were there.  We can't do anything but watch and cringe.Some have said it makes us feel like we're there with the passengers.  I didn't feel that, because I knew I was safe.  But I did have this amazing feeling of wishing I could change things.  I knew that in a few minutes, all these people would be dead, but I was looking urgently for the hope that the story might turn out differently.The movie is well-acted, but it's more about the editing and cinematography.  It's fast moving, and often visually a little confusing.  After all, the director, Peter Greengrass, was trying to be as faithful as possible to the real events, but we don't know what all of them are...just snippets gleaned from phone conversations and minimal transmissions.  The rest was filled in...so one way to handle the gaps in our knowledge is to throw the camera right in the middle of the action, where we're so close that much of what we see are closeups of jostling torsos, and lots of yelling and noise.It's hard to review this film, because we're very close to it still.  But what it does do is remind the viewer again that we were attacked, and that we were attacked not by a rational enemy with a negotiable aim.  We were attacked by religous zealots who truly believe that our deaths are their salvation.  It's important to remember.  It's important to remember that sometimes when we engage the enemy, we don't have perfect clarity as to what they are doing, but we DO know that inaction won't result in a happy capitulation.  I'm not trying to politicize the movie, but that's the first effect it had on me.Best of all, the cast of this movie looks like REAL people.  No great beauties or handsome hunks.  The people who took action sweated with fear or wept with terror.  They weren't commandos on a mission, they were fathers, sons, wives and children who thought first of their loved ones and then of the lives they might save by risking their own.  And they nearly pulled off saving their own lives...but we are quite sure they saved hundreds of lives who would have been lost in our capital that day.The movie is R-rated, mostly for some cussing (not too much, though) but mostly, I would say, for the intensity of the film.  One hundred years from now, when things have changed a great deal in the world, viewers will probably wonder what the fuss was about.  But for a world not even 5 years removed from the event, UNITED 93 is vital viewing.",5,A vital reminder...and a well-made film,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3180,"['moment', 'movie', 'started', 'felt', 'heart', 'start', 'pound', 'anticipation', 'being', 'upset', 'angry', 'terrified', 'generally', 'put', 'emotional', 'wringer', 'not', 'pleasant', 'moving-going', 'experience', 'wrenching', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'feelings', '9/11', 'Helplessness', 'anger', 'sadness', 'also', 'gave', 'new', 'respect', 'passengers', 'United', '93', 'many', 'people', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'towers', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'watch', 'helplessly.The', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'real', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'introduced', 'characters', 'predictable', 'way', 'back', 'stories', 'heck', 'names', 'are', 'given', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'ono', 'plane', 'tower', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'watch', 'cringe.Some', 'have', 'said', 'feel', ""'re"", 'passengers', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'that', 'knew', 'was', 'safe', 'did', 'have', 'amazing', 'feeling', 'wishing', 'could', 'change', 'things', 'knew', 'few', 'minutes', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'was', 'looking', 'urgently', 'hope', 'story', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'differently.The', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'more', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'fast', 'moving', 'often', 'visually', 'little', 'confusing', 'director', 'Peter', 'Greengrass', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'faithful', 'possible', 'real', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'just', 'snippets', 'gleaned', 'phone', 'conversations', 'minimal', 'transmissions', 'rest', 'was', 'filled', 'so', 'one', 'way', 'handle', 'gaps', 'knowledge', 'throw', 'camera', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'where', ""'re"", 'so', 'close', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'are', 'closeups', 'jostling', 'torsos', 'lots', 'yelling', 'hard', 'review', 'film', ""'re"", 'very', 'close', 'still', 'what', 'do', 'remind', 'viewer', 'again', 'were', 'attacked', 'were', 'attacked', 'not', 'rational', 'enemy', 'negotiable', 'aim', 'were', 'attacked', 'religous', 'zealots', 'who', 'truly', 'believe', 'deaths', 'are', 'salvation', 'important', 'remember', 'important', 'remember', 'sometimes', 'when', 'engage', 'enemy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'DO', 'know', 'inaction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'result', 'happy', 'capitulation', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'politicize', 'movie', 'first', 'effect', 'had', 'me.Best', 'cast', 'movie', 'REAL', 'people', 'great', 'beauties', 'handsome', 'hunks', 'people', 'who', 'took', 'action', 'sweated', 'fear', 'wept', 'terror', 'were', ""n't"", 'commandos', 'mission', 'were', 'fathers', 'sons', 'wives', 'children', 'who', 'thought', 'first', 'loved', 'ones', 'then', 'lives', 'might', 'save', 'risking', 'own', 'nearly', 'pulled', 'off', 'saving', 'own', 'lives', 'are', 'quite', 'sure', 'saved', 'hundreds', 'lives', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'capital', 'day.The', 'movie', 'R-rated', 'mostly', 'cussing', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'mostly', 'would', 'say', 'intensity', 'film', 'One', 'hundred', 'years', 'now', 'when', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'great', 'deal', 'world', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'world', 'not', 'even', '5', 'years', 'removed', 'event', 'UNITED', '93', 'vital', 'viewing']",United 93

Paul Greengrass succeeds brilliantly and beautifully in his Oscar-nominated direction of this film that is both well-made and respectful to the fallen heroes. There are no corny backstories in an attempt to gain tears from the audience. No, Greengrass takes a more effective approach by simply showing the events in real time. The casting for this film is excellent, as the ensemble of unknown actors contribute to the sense that these are average people who combat terrorism and impending doom with extraordinary bravery. The true beauty of this film is the subtle detail. For example, at the beginning, when all appears normal, a man working at a computer offscreen can be heard casually commenting that one of the soon to be found out as hijacked aircraft has turned 10 degrees offcourse.

I guess this is because, more often than not, the subject matter gets what's now called the ""inspired by actual events,"" or what I call ""movie of the week"" treatment.  It doesn't matter if the film is actually meant for television or is getting the big-screen format, the way producers feel they have to handle such things is non-offensive and by-the-numbers; there are a handful of courageous people led by one hero who, in the face of all odds, triumph over evil or disaster, even if that's not what actually happened.  The villains are unsympathetic and we're rooting for them to get the axe at the end.Thankfully, Paul Greengrass didn't allow this fact-based memorial to fall into that trap.  We don't see big-name actors portraying the people who died on United Flight 93.  Some of them are familiar faces, sure, but we've seen them all doing character pieces.  They, in fact, add to the idea that these were all common folk put into a harrowing situation that has absolutely no chance for a happy outcome.  We don't see salvation on the ground either, as the real people who manned control towers and Washington monitoring agencies on September 11, 2001, relive what, for them, was a moment of defeat - noone ever pictured a terrorist suicide mission on American soil, therefore noone had any idea how to handle it.  Certainly they did their best, but it wasn't good enough.All of this could have made for an ultimately senseless work with no redeeming qualities, but there is a quote that goes something like, ""when all that is left is death, how you face it is what matters.""  Once the passengers on the doomed flight realized how big the stakes were, they decided to fight back.  What we're left with is a factual charge-of-the-Light-Brigade based on flight voice and data recorders showing how desperately both sides fought for victory.  And yes, the hijackers were deluded murderers, but we feel a slight bit of empathy for them.  They thought was they were doing was right, and in the end, they didn't want to die either.  If there was a way out for them with what their leaders harped on them was ""honor,"" I get the feeling they would've taken it.Most of ""United 93"" is conjecture, but I feel it's educated conjecture.

644296,A3DC53MM1NGLBB,B00005JOZI,Sean,"[21, 24]","United 93 - ADirector Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible. He has made a tasteful, powerful, emotional, great and above all else respectful movie on one of the events that transpired on September 11th 2001.You all know what this movie is about so there is no need to explain it. The movie begins in the early morning hours of September 11th 2001 in the hotel room of the terrorists who hijack flight United 93. We follow them from there to the airport, to the plane, through the hijacking and right to the end. Everything in this movie is done respectfully and tastefully. There are no cartoonish bad guys, nor are there any Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipes type heroes. The music doesn't swell up or have violins playing in the background when the crew rebels. There are no dramatic slow motion shots either. This is a real movie plain and simple.The acting in this movie is surprisingly great. All the actors in this are unknowns and this helps in a big big way. If we has Nicholas Cage or Brad Pitt in this movie then that would detract from is severely. We'd look at it and know that they are acting. With the unknowns though, they feel like regular people in a terrible situation. They all give great, convincing performances and really pull you in to the movie, yes even the terrorists do. There is not one main character we follow either, rather it is symbolic of the title; they are all United as one and we care for them individually as well as a whole. We don't get to know them deeply but that doesn't deter because, essentially they are us. You get to know them gradually throughout the movie though.The music is a truly spectacular aspect of this film. As I said earlier, it isn't overly dramatic nor is it all heroic and such. It is absolutely perfect for this movie; the composer couldn't have done a better job. It's especially wonderful near the end though, truly spectacular.Greengrass uses a lot of handheld camera work here; most of the movie is in handheld format. This helps us get sucked in to the situation even more because we feel as though we are spectators and going through what the crew and passengers went through. It's very effective and it never gets annoying. Some complain that handheld cameras give them motion sickness, but if it's in the hands of the right director it works great (Mann is a good example) and Greengrass shows he is one of the ones who make it work.The visual effects are good, for the sparse amount there are in the films. Most of them are just the outlook of the plane windows but they never look hokey or out of place. They seem very natural.The imagery in this movie is wonderful. It doesn't go overboard exploiting everything that happened nor does it wallow in itself by saying ""Hey, I'm a 9/11 movie, watch how I show all the horrible images we've seen over the past 4.5 years!"" It shows what it needs to. It shows a news report of the second plane hitting, it shows the WTC in the background, smoking. It does not however show the buildings collapse nor does it show the plane exploding. It reminds us of why this is such an important event in our history, why we should never forget it. Greengrass knows that we lived through this and doesn't overdue the graphic-ness (for lack of a better word) of this subject, but he also shows enough and tells enough that future generations will be able to watch this movie and grasp what their Parents and Grandparents experienced that fateful September morning in 2001.The ending to this movie is absolutely perfect. It ends in a perfect way; right when it should end. It ends right where you expect it too as well. It ends with the plane crashing. The crash is a first person outlook from the cockpit and the ground is spiraling toward you and you really get a great sense of how fast they were really going. Right before it hits, the screen goes to black for about 5 or so seconds. Then text appears explaining what happened following the crash and the text changes about three times before saying that this movie is dedicated to all those who lost their lives on September 11th 2001. You really have to see it though; it's quite moving and is quite simply the perfect way to end this movie.United 93 is a spectacular movie. This is truly a movie for everyone. Everybody should see it, maybe not right now cause I know some people aren't ready to relive 9/11 quite yet and some think it's too early for a movie like this, but everyone should see it one day. These passengers and the crew struck the first blow in the war against terror, they were true patriots and I commend Greengrass because he didn't make this movie for money (even if that was the studio's intention) nor did he exploit the victims of this event. He made it to tell a story, a very important story of what happened 4 and a half years ago. He showed us how heroic these people are and that America is a strong nation. Honestly, I've never been more proud to be an American.",5,"""United 93 are you there?

The heroism of the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 was a major exception.The events are well known to all.  On the day when four airliners were hijacked by radical Islamic terrorists, those on this craft fought back.  After the killers took over the airplane, several of those on board spoke with their loved ones by phone.  They found out about the other airliners that were flown into the World Trade Center and decided to go down fighting.  This is their story.The creators of this movie did a great job of recreating the events of that day.  It is very well done and very powerful.

644303,A11548ZOIDAELN,B00005JOZI,S P,"[2, 3]","I am intrigued by the series of events that transpired on September 11 - many in tandem with another and in a confusing, overwhelming combination. United 93 helps make sense of a coordinated plan that set its sights not only on the World Trade Center but also the Pentagon, perhaps the White House, and even the National Mall, according to reports on the day of the attacks. (The National Mall story was later proven false - there was not a fire there.) On one level, this movie looks at the air traffic control situation and responses to alleged or confirmed hijackings. This macro focus helps explain the interplay between different reports and commands on the part of the government. At one point you see a plane disappear from radar before it hits the World Trade Center - right before the eyes of the air traffic controllers. Drawing the link between the supposedly ""removed, impersonal"" government and the people on the ground helps to humanize the situation even further (think, the FDNY firefighters.)Still, the government failed in its mission - and the variety of faulty reports and missed opportunities attests to that. The military did not deploy any anti-aircraft weapons against United 93, although the control rooms at various agencies were clearly buzzing with activity. I would best describe the response shown in the movie as ""sound and fury."" And that's exactly what is was. Thankfully, the movie lacks a socio-political agenda and portrays the events fairly. The deepest it delves into social commentary is to show the disorder and unpreparedness on the part of government, military, and aviation agencies such as the FAA and NORAD. Those are things that need to be shown - and viewers can make their own judgments.If I had to say, I would call this a September 11 movie with a focus on United Airlines flight 93 - not the other way around. With the context of the national terrorist attack, the movie hones in on the crew, passengers, and terrorists aboard the plane. They are seen arriving at the airport and ordering meals, and later calling their families for the final time and organizing a plan of attack. They are shown to be very normal people. Thus, hearing their prayers and farewells helps you appreciate the very fact that you are alive and able to read this.While touching and emotional, the movie is also tasteful. It sidesteps artistic exploitation. Indeed, the really dramatic sections of the hijacking and passenger response were confined to a few minutes in the middle of the movie and near the end. I give credit to the director for not extending or dramatizing these scenes any more than was necessary. Acts of violence arrive without any warning, helping to convey just how unexpected they really were. Everything is seen for what it is. The hijackers are shown reciting the Quran, the blood is bright red, and at the end, the grassy field in Pennsylvania draws closer and closer as the plane nosedives - and that's the end. It's an immersing experience.I highly encourage you to watch United 93.

I found myself extremely choked up when the passengers on the flight were ringing relatives to say goodbye and couldn't even begin to imagine having to do something like that.

644306,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00005JOZI,SteakSalad101,"[5, 5]","United 93 was one I skipped over last year. Last year I took the view that any film made so close after 9/11 to be distributed wide in theaters that was about 9/11 was absolutely wrong, exploited Americans, and did not deserve my ticket money. But considering the high success United 93 had, the outstanding reviews it gathered, and its popularity at the Academy Awards, I decided to give this movie a chance at Blockbuster tonight.I had read all over the place before I watched it that it was an extremely emotionally intense film. I am very attracted to these types of films because many times they cut right to the soul of you and make you wonder how lucky you are. I thought I had seen everything filmmakers had to offer in this genre. I was wrong.From the very first scene, United 93 reaches out to you and brings you back six years ago to re-witness the terror America went through on the fateful day, September 11th, 2001. In a close-to-real-time manner, we are taken through--from start to finish--the morning that America will never forget.MANY people still refuse to see this movie and others similar to it because they believe it is wrong to make such a film after the tragedy of 9/11. I can say with full confidence that ""United 93"" is not a piece of B-movie Hollywood over-dramatic crap set on the day of 9/11 to entertain audiences in a summer popcorn movie. United 93 is extremely tastefully done not to provide entertainment for its viewers...but what it does provide is something much more valuable, and that is terror. From the moment you start watching, you are pulled into your TV screen and experience every single gut-wrenching moment along with the passengers on United Flight 93. As if you were one of the passengers on the plane, you experience every ounce of terror, every single moment of fear, and every single bit of hate for the terrorists hijacking the plane. You are no longer wrapped up in a cozy blanket on your couch with your newly installed HD television set you put it into impress your successful neighbour. You're a passenger on Flight 93.Paul Greengrass delivers an exquisitely directed film (one of the best direction jobs I have seen in my years as a movie critic) and paired with extraordinarily realistic acting performances by everyone in the film. The film is shot similar to a documentary and it truly makes you feel like you are watching rare camera footage that survived the crash instead of a film made in a studio. Everything about the film is so realistic, I'm actually having trouble calling it a ""film"" in this review.Of course, United 93 is not for everyone. It is without a doubt the most emotionally powerful film I have ever watched and quite possibly the most terrifying movie I've ever sat through in all my years of seeing extreme horror films. The violence is extremely strong, very disturbing, and shockingly realistic. There are very few scenes free of peril and sometimes the emotional intensity gets so high you want to turn off the movie. But then you think of the people that really were on that plane--they couldn't just turn off the movie. They had to go keep fighting, and that thought alone will keep you watching.But even so, this is more than a film showing the absolute terror that went on in the cabin of Flight 93. This is a film that shows true American spirit, and you feel compelled to join the brave men and women who attempt to storm the cockpit. You feel compelled to take up a weapon--which is anything you can find on the plane--and join the attempted take-back of the plane. And even though everyone who watches the film will know the outcome automatically...you still see that last beam of hope inside you. The last beam of hope that maybe, just maybe, these guys can take the terrorists down. Maybe, just maybe, the storm to the cockpit will work. And that's the moment you know that United 93 is more than just a movie...it's a true masterpiece.5-Stars",5,One of the most terrifyingly realistic films ever produced...a masterpiece,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,3942,"['United', '93', 'was', 'one', 'skipped', 'last', 'year', 'Last', 'year', 'took', 'view', 'film', 'made', 'so', 'close', '9/11', 'be', 'distributed', 'wide', 'theaters', 'was', '9/11', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'exploited', 'Americans', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'ticket', 'money', 'considering', 'high', 'success', 'United', '93', 'had', 'outstanding', 'reviews', 'gathered', 'popularity', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'Blockbuster', 'tonight.I', 'had', 'read', 'all', 'place', 'watched', 'was', 'extremely', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'film', 'am', 'very', 'attracted', 'types', 'films', 'because', 'many', 'times', 'cut', 'right', 'soul', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'everything', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'offer', 'genre', 'was', 'wrong.From', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'United', '93', 'out', 'brings', 'back', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 're-witness', 'terror', 'America', 'went', 'fateful', 'day', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'close-to-real-time', 'manner', 'are', 'taken', 'start', 'finish', 'morning', 'America', 'will', 'never', 'forget.MANY', 'people', 'still', 'refuse', 'see', 'movie', 'others', 'similar', 'believe', 'wrong', 'make', 'such', 'film', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'can', 'say', 'full', 'confidence', 'United', '93', 'not', 'piece', 'B-movie', 'Hollywood', 'over-dramatic', 'crap', 'set', 'day', '9/11', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'summer', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'United', '93', 'extremely', 'tastefully', 'done', 'not', 'provide', 'entertainment', 'viewers', 'what', 'provide', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'valuable', 'terror', 'moment', 'start', 'watching', 'are', 'pulled', 'TV', 'screen', 'experience', 'single', 'gut-wrenching', 'moment', 'passengers', 'United', 'Flight', '93', 'were', 'one', 'passengers', 'plane', 'experience', 'ounce', 'terror', 'single', 'moment', 'fear', 'single', 'bit', 'hate', 'terrorists', 'hijacking', 'plane', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'wrapped', 'up', 'cozy', 'blanket', 'couch', 'newly', 'installed', 'HD', 'television', 'set', 'put', 'impress', 'successful', 'neighbour', ""'re"", 'passenger', 'Flight', '93.Paul', 'Greengrass', 'delivers', 'exquisitely', 'directed', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'direction', 'jobs', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'movie', 'critic', 'paired', 'extraordinarily', 'realistic', 'acting', 'performances', 'everyone', 'film', 'film', 'shot', 'similar', 'documentary', 'truly', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'rare', 'camera', 'footage', 'survived', 'crash', 'instead', 'film', 'made', 'studio', 'Everything', 'film', 'so', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'actually', 'having', 'trouble', 'calling', 'film', 'review.Of', 'course', 'United', '93', 'not', 'everyone', 'doubt', 'most', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'terrifying', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'sat', 'years', 'seeing', 'extreme', 'horror', 'films', 'violence', 'extremely', 'strong', 'very', 'disturbing', 'shockingly', 'realistic', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'scenes', 'free', 'peril', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'so', 'high', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'then', 'think', 'people', 'really', 'were', 'plane', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'had', 'go', 'keep', 'fighting', 'thought', 'alone', 'will', 'keep', 'watching.But', 'even', 'so', 'more', 'film', 'showing', 'absolute', 'terror', 'went', 'cabin', 'Flight', '93', 'film', 'true', 'American', 'spirit', 'feel', 'compelled', 'join', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'attempt', 'storm', 'cockpit', 'feel', 'compelled', 'take', 'up', 'weapon', 'anything', 'can', 'find', 'plane', 'join', 'attempted', 'take-back', 'plane', 'even', 'everyone', 'who', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'outcome', 'automatically', 'still', 'see', 'last', 'beam', 'hope', 'last', 'beam', 'hope', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'guys', 'can', 'take', 'terrorists', 'down', 'Maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'storm', 'cockpit', 'will', 'work', 'moment', 'know', 'United', '93', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'true', 'masterpiece.5-Stars']",United 93

And lots of questions about this movie, and whether or not that it is too soon after Septemeber 11, 2001 for a film to be made of that horrible day in September of 01. I don't think so, and plus we have had a couple of other ones before this. Just months after the day, we had G&eacute;d&eacute;on and Jules Naudet's 9/11, and Fahrenheit 9/11. And this movie got a R rating from the MPAA, and with very good reason to, so parents please don't let your kids watch this movie until they are old enough, this movie is not for them, and a lot in ths movie they should see, and don't count on a 9/11 film coming out that would even be appioate for them coming out in the future. Since this movie was released in September, tonight I finnaly got the chance to see it on dvd. This movie follows the story of United 93, that was the only hijacked airplanes on the morning of September 11, 2001 that didn't reach its target. Instead United Airlines 93 crashed into a Pennsylvania field. All the actors are unknown, and I would doubt a lot of htem you would have heard of. When this movie came out, and when I saw the full cast list, one of the names that I was surpised to see in the movie, and didn't see mentioned at all in reviews, is Cheyenne Jackson that played Mark Bingham. I know him best for being in the orginal Broadway cast of the Elvis Presley musical All Shook Up that opened up on Broadway on March 24, 2005, but because of decling tickets sales, lead the play to be closed on September 25, 2005. All the people that was on United 93 on that fateful September day died, and just by watching this film makes me glad that I wasn't on one of the 4 planes that day, otherwise I wouldn't be here writing this review. My life would have been lost, and who knows on the 3 other planes, how many people surived that day. And plus I can't even remember the last time I even had to take a plane ride. But still I have to give this a good review, and a recommendation, that if you haven't seen this film yet, that you might want to see this film, whether or not you knew a person that died on September 11th, certainly I have to be sad for the familes of September 11 victims, they didn't dereve to die this way, nor did thier loved ones derseved to lose them this way.

644308,AI5OR1HSYXCCL,B00005JOZI,Steve  Dietrich,"[3, 3]","I appreciated the movie for covering both the process and the emotions of that day. The language of the air traffic control system was reasonably close to reality. The lack of coordination between the civilian and military air controllers was real but perhaps over dramatized. Lacking was a discussion of the  pitifully small forces dedicated to the protection of our air frontiers, the time required to launch and the geometry of an air intercept.As mentioned in another of my posts I have immense appreciation for the effort of the passengers to gain control of the aircraft. The writings on the subject have, in my opinion, not devoted sufficient focus to the role of the muscle hijackers, their weapons and training. I am also of the opinion that the skill of the pilots has been grossly underestimated.To be sure we do not really not know what happened during the last few minutes of the flight. The movie takes some liberties with speculation. However, this is true with most things in movies and history. We seldom know the full story.My personal guess is that the passengers did get into the cockpit. Their they were confronted by the fundamental problem of attacking inside an aircraft.  If the crew are strapped in they can push the nose down so that the passengers are weightless and make it difficult for them to move. However, once the nose of a commercial jet ( unlike a military jet) gets too low a recovery is almost impossible. One thing that appears to have been glossed over in every account of 9-11 is the professionalism of the pilots flying the hijacked airplanes. To me there is little doubt that these were well trained pilots and that the bozos who attended flight schools in the US were simply backups.The passengers who fought for control of the airplane refused to be lead to a slaughter and it doing so may have saved thousands or perhaps even tens of thousands of lives.

This film comes at a critical point in our time.  Most people want to forget that 9/11 ever happened, but the fact remains is it did.  And we must never forget those who gave their lives to save others.  If we don't learn from history, than it is bound to repeat itself.United 93 is a minute by minute account of the doomed flight, but it also focuses on what was happening on the ground.  Many people criticize the events of that day as our being unprepared.  And we were, simply because something like this had never occured before.  In fact, the film shows that many people did a great job at trying to figure out what was going on to try and prevent it.This film features no actors you've ever heard of, because the film-maker Paul Greengrass felt that any stars would just take away from how ordinary the people were on the flight.  He was right.  That is my one complaint about Oliver Stone's new film is that he uses Nicholas Cage as one of the characters.Even though you know how the film is going to end, it is still gut wrentching to watch the people final hour and a half of life, and the fear they must have gone through, and the courage they had to give their all to stop evil.  It truely makes you think if you would have done the same thing in there place.  The film also deserves kudos on the fact that it show radical Islamic terrorist as the enemy we still need to face and that our troops still face them in Afganistan and Iraq.I'm not ashamed to admit I was bawling by the end of the film, because it struck me to the very center of my soul.

644311,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00005JOZI,Steven Hancock,"[14, 19]","Hard on the heels of last January's TV Movie ""Flight 93,"" acclaimed filmmaker Paul Greengrass brought his own variation of the fate of the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 to the screen, in the first theatrical feature to deal with the events of September 11, 2001.After seeing the television film, I thought it would be hard for any film, even a theatrical feature, to match the power and emotional charge that the first film had. But ""United 93"" succeeds with flying colors. A totally different approach all together, Greengrass depicts the events from the plane, with no dramatic imbellishment. This gives the film an immeadiacy that truly puts the viewer on the plane with these men and women. This is what gives ""United 93"" it's power. The scenes of air traffic controllers and military personnel trying to figure out what is happening on that fateful Tuesday morning are equally harrowing.The cast and crew do a fantastic job of recreating this tragic event of recent history, while showing the bravery of the men and women who fought to re-take Flight 93, and prevent possibly hundreds more from being murdered.I highly recommend this film, both as a reminder of that fateful day, and as a reminder of what we are fighting to prevent from happening again.Grade: A",5,9/11 HITS THE BIG SCREEN IN POWERFUL FILM!,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,1286,"['Hard', 'heels', 'last', 'January', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Flight', '93', 'acclaimed', 'filmmaker', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'brought', 'own', 'variation', 'fate', 'passengers', 'crew', 'United', 'Airlines', 'Flight', '93', 'screen', 'first', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'deal', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001.After', 'seeing', 'television', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'film', 'even', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'match', 'power', 'emotional', 'charge', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'United', '93', 'flying', 'colors', 'totally', 'different', 'approach', 'together', 'Greengrass', 'events', 'plane', 'dramatic', 'imbellishment', 'film', 'immeadiacy', 'truly', 'viewer', 'plane', 'men', 'women', 'what', 'United', '93', 'power', 'scenes', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'military', 'personnel', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'fateful', 'Tuesday', 'morning', 'are', 'equally', 'harrowing.The', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'recreating', 'tragic', 'event', 'recent', 'history', 'showing', 'bravery', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'fought', 're-take', 'Flight', '93', 'prevent', 'possibly', 'more', 'being', 'murdered.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'reminder', 'fateful', 'day', 'reminder', 'what', 'are', 'fighting', 'prevent', 'happening', 'again.Grade']",United 93
644312,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JOZI,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[3, 6]","Reviewing this film is difficult as there seems to be several camps at work here that will find fault with whatever one writes about this important film.  I would like to take time to address these camps as in introduction to my review.Some argue that this moment in our history is so terrible, so ungodly, so inhumane and still so raw in our memory that any attempts by Hollywood to reproduce that time is an insult to the memory of the victims and shows Hollywood for all its callousness and greed.  I agree that some passage of time is necessary for us to heal from pain, but we can't ignore that the medium of film is a form of memorial as much as any plaque, statue, or monument.  In addition, one should recognize that film can be and often is a cathartic experience that allows us to express our hurt and, thus, aid in the healing process.  Therefore, it is not, in my view, so questionable for Hollywood to make a film about a fairly recent tragedy, but it is questionable whether boycotting such films serves the purpose intended by those who believe we should.Should we boycott such films asSchindler's List,Pearl Harbor, and  all other such films based upon true tragedies because one can view them as profiteering off of another's pain?  I would think that it is more important that we never forget the various tragedies in history and film does assist with that.  How about boycotting films about natural disasters, famous murders and murderers or films about those mentally or physically challenged?  Isn't someone profitting off of these tragedies as well?  Shouldn't we boycott them too?I think this is all just too extreme.  Yes, films need to make a profit, but that doesn't mean a film is devoid of purpose or that it can't be beneficial to many outside of weighing box-office receipts.  Can these films, while making a profit, not provide a fitting tribute to those victims and the survivors, and, in the end, provide some comfort?  I think so.The other problem with Hollywood, and it's been around since the silent era, is the viewpoint or vision presented by those making a film.  As far as a film being bias with the writer's or director's unique perspective, or an actor's interpretation of a character (real or not) is a rather moot point as that is a given with ANY film and, quite frankly, any work of art.  It is THEIR take on a topic just as an impressionistic painter is creating his view of something onto canvass.  The medium is different, but both have a right to their perspective.  I do agree, however, that when dealing with great human tragedy one must be very careful in how he interprets and presents facts, but one's personal bias can rarely ever be objectively overcome no matter the medium of expression.  If this is all new to you, then you need to stop watching films completely until you come to terms with this reality as this has been around since the dawn of film making.For those that criticize Hollywood for ""taking advantage of the victims and their survivors"" let's not ignore that the families connected to this film gave their stamp of approval for it to be made (Hollywood rarely ever even asks for that) and were extremely satisfied with the end result.  Also, a portion of the money made from this film benefits them (via a memorial).  That is rarely done in Hollywood and they deserve some praise for doing that.  So much for callous greed.  This also means that boycotting this film may actually be hurtful to these families that deserve whatever we can give them either monetarily or via a memorial.The other camp in relation to making films about historical tragedies finds that any criticism of the film an insult to the memory of the people in which the film relates.  Sadly, these folks have difficulty seeing the difference between criticizing a film and criticizing people or an event.  I was a bit disappointed with Oliver Stone'sWorld Trade Centerfor cinematic reasons, but I quickly found myself defending my own patriotism in the comment section of that review (that section has since been ""edited"").  I ran into similar issues when criticizing the recent Disney TV remake ofThe Miracle Worker(the true story of Helen Keller).  Criticizing such films does not make me unamerican or intolerant of those with disabilities.  Finding fault with ""United 93"" doesn't mean one doesn't appreciate what those individuals went through that day.  The film may be based on true events, but that doesn't mean the film itself or the director's vision is flawless.Now there is one other camp at work here, and they are the ""conspiracy theorists"" who have decided to use this forum not to review a film, but rather to exploit the victims of 9/11 in a manner worse than anything Hollywood could do and indirectly cause much more harm to us than what the terrorists did on that fateful day.  We have the right to freedom of speech, but we are expected to use that appropriately too.  I can't yell ""FIRE"" in a crowded movie theater without criminal consequences.  In that light, I don't march, shout obscenities, or picket the funerals of our soldiers because I may not believe in a war our country asked them to fight as that is not MORALLY my place to exercise my so-called freedom of speech and is unnecessarily hurtful to others who are already suffering.  This is called using discretion and it's what our founding fathers expected us to use.To read on here, in what is supposed to be just reviews for a film, and find what are merely personal assertions (with little or no facts), propaganda by groups seeking ""the truth"" (as long as it fits their myopic views), and slander regarding that tragic day on 9/11 without regard for the individuals truly involved is rather disheartening and certainly self-serving by those involved who have little concept of the ""truth"" other than some website they try to direct us to which often contain little more than hearsay, doctored photographs, and other such nonsense.Even if I agreed with all these conspiracy theorists and ""9/11 Truth"" groups and I ignored any and all evidence to the contrary and sincerely believed that the events of 9/11 were the result of an ""inside job"", television special effects, government propaganda, fantasy and so forth, I would NEVER think of so vocally expressing that here, which may be my right, because if I am wrong in my assertion, the harm I would inflict on the actual families and friends of those who personally suffered from the events of 9/11 would be unthinkable to me.  I have read far too many ""this was all faked by the government"" or ""it never happened"" comments and ""reviews"" (I use the term loosely here) that I can't imagine the deep hurt experienced by those who truly did lose loved ones that day even though I am one of them.""  For me, personally, this is beyond cruel and literally inflicts more harm than anything the terrorist did that day.  Are we ALL allowed our opinion?  YES, but some discretion is called for in such extreme situations such as those connected to 9/11 and some form of decency, respect, and discretion should be paramount before we open our mouths or type on the computer.Now having addressed both camps and the conspiracy theorist group that have more than made themselves know here by commenting, sometimes viciously, on one's review I offer my perspective on this film.  ""United 93"" is an extraordinary film that plays out more as a small independent docu-drama than a traditional big-budget Hollywood film.  Paul Greengrass's direction is straight-forward, confident and unobtrusive; however, his script faults in just a few places where some stilted dialogue is present.  His brilliant casting of unknowns (actors or even the real people involved in some cases) was a respectful move in order to not promote a specific star's career and this allowed the focus to be on the real-life characters portrayed within the film with no distractions.In addition, while some have criticized the film for being overly speculative, I found it rather fair treatment of events that unfolded that day as careful analysis of cell/plane calls, witness testimonies (some even by phone), news reports, aircraft recording devices, government documents, and so forth were the foundation for much of what was presented in this film.  Contrary to the callousness of our conspiracy theorists there is no solid evidence for Greengrass to consider of United 93 being shot down or having landed in some secret location.  In fact, all the evidence concretely contradicts these ludicrous notions.  There speculative moments within the film as we can't know exactly what was said and done at all times on that flight; however,  ALL films, I'll say it again, ALL films on true events are speculative by nature and events are often open to interpretations.  I simply found this film to be realistic and fair based upon what was known about that day.  I felt good judgment was used in presenting what happened and what most likely happened that day on United 93.Our heroes, as presented in this film, where very much the way I imagine them to be: ordinary people who were scared to death.  There was no Jason Bourne or John McClane on board United 93, just everyday ordinary people placed in an extraordinary situation.  Some were too scared to do anything, some were in a state of panic, some prayed for deliverance, some just hoped for the best, and some took desperate measures.  ALL were heroes for facing what I would never want to face myself.  Facing death, even when afraid of it, is heroic, especially when it is forced upon us.The film is in ""real time"" and that heightens the tension and our appreciation for what those poor souls experienced that day.  This allows the story to move swiftly and with purpose as it demonstrates the overall feeling of confusion that occurred that day.  Most of us could not believe what was happening and it didn't matter if we were the everyday guy on the street, a government official, a pilot, or a teacher in the middle of a lesson as I was that day.  We were all caught off guard and in disbelief and this film captures that well.  There are no unnecessary diverging scenes within this film.I found this film to be generally flawless (except for some dialogue problems at times), one of the best of 2006, and a fitting tribute to those who so bravely faced what most of us would find unimaginable.  ""United 93"" is a haunting, frightening, realistic, moving film, and a triumph of the human spirit.  I know that is a cliche term, but it is most fitting here.In conclusion it important to observe that we all lost something on 9/11, some indirectly and some directly.  As former New Yorkers, my wife and I lost co-workers, friends, and a sense of security oddly found in the skyline of that great city that no longer looks as it did when we last were there.  We both worked in and around The World Trade Centers (I actually witnessed them be built).  I worked at the base in a department store and my wife worked on the 96th floor for a bank.  It's hard to imagine that most of our co-workers and friends from there are gone.  I have yet to return to New York, but I know I will one day; I must.  In the meantime, I find films like ""United 93"" to be an emotional outlet, a reminder of the fragility of life and the evil man is capable of committing, and the fight to survive that is in all of us.This is why I defend the making of such films on 9/11 and why I'm also so appalled at the callousness of some here abusing their freedom of speech by shouting such obscenities as ""this didn't happened"", ""it's a big cover-up"", or ""it's all fiction"" and back it up with websites that are an insult to the memory of those who perished that day.  I guess my friend present at the WTC didn't see that plane hit it as she said she did.  It was television special effects or a bomb planted by our government to mislead us.  I guess both the flight recorder and those who spoke to loved ones on United 93 moments before the attempt to break into the cockpit had it all wrong as well as they were ""shot down by our own Air Force"" or ""landed safely in a secret location"" as our conspiracy theorists claim or have doctored photos to ""prove it.""  My dad once told me that it is ""better to be silent and only thought to be a foul then to open your mouth and remove all doubt about it.""According to our conspiracy theorist those of us who witnessed or were otherwise connected to 9/11 have it all wrong and have been fooled by the government that set out this elaborate plan in which it would take thousands to orchestrate and keep secret) to kill thousands of American lives and destroy national landmarks in order to create a war for fun while wrecking the already financially crippled airline industry and putting a death grip on our overall economy that would take years in which to recover.  The same people who would have us believe that utter nonsense are now shouting how we should dishonor those we lost that day by pretending the events of 9/11 never happened and check out their websites to review doctored ""evidence.""  I think not.  These individuals embarrass themselves and only assist at rubbing salt in a hard to heal wound that was made by the terrorists that clear day on September 11th.  A day that should be remembered as it was and not as we would like it to have been and shame on the revisionists in our society who are nothing more than selfish attention seekers.",5,Historical

Burket ""tburket""","[1, 3]","This real-time perspective was probably about as well done as is possible, unless you wanted a completely different movie with context, backstory, and speculation about all of 9/11. There will be plenty of opportunities for those movies in the future. I am pleased that this particular movie was made by these particular people.With absolutely no coverage of events before 9/11 and nothing about the people on the flight, the movie seemed almost a tad strange given what we know now about the event and the individuals. I found myself wondering which person was Jeremy Glick, which one was Todd Beamer, and so on, and how the action would begin and play out. The film was spot-on in not being overly dramatic, not presenting the people as victims, and not distracting the story line with details about the passengers.We don't know exactly what happened on the flight, of course. My impression was that the film got right what it could get right, using interviews, transcripts, and other sources, and found reasonable choices when it had to estimate. Even the very ending was probably wise, as it avoided a potentially controversial position on the last few seconds.The film takes place in three segments: the uneventful early-day setup;  the initial hijackings and the realization among the controllers that the impossible to contemplate was actually unfolding; and 93 itself, including the implication that the delayed takeoff of 93 from Newark actually allowed the passengers to know they were part of a far bigger event and draw the horrible conclusions that prompted the action on board.The use of relatively unknown actors and actresses was another smart move, avoiding the distraction of famous faces and re-inforcing the idea of a collection of random people thrown together, still capable of doing the exception. If someone like Clint Eastwood had been on the plane, the premise would have been ruined. I didn't realize until the director's remarks that Ben Sliney, the head of the national air traffic center and the one who shut down American air space, was played by himself. Fine move and a great job by Mr. Sliney and other other real controllers in the film.The supporting material about the families is touching, and the director's commentary adds value.So why only four stars or 4.5? The documentary approach, the number of non-acting professionals, the number of hand-held shots, the lack of character development, and so on, all make this an unusual film that I can't really judge against what constitutes a normal movie.I also recommend Jere Longman's book for anybody interested in UAL 93.",4,Outstanding in conception and execution,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,2609,"['real-time', 'perspective', 'was', 'probably', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'possible', 'wanted', 'completely', 'different', 'movie', 'context', 'backstory', 'speculation', '9/11', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'movies', 'future', 'am', 'pleased', 'particular', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'particular', 'people.With', 'absolutely', 'coverage', 'events', '9/11', 'nothing', 'people', 'flight', 'movie', 'seemed', 'almost', 'tad', 'strange', 'given', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'event', 'individuals', 'found', 'wondering', 'person', 'was', 'Jeremy', 'Glick', 'one', 'was', 'Todd', 'Beamer', 'so', 'how', 'action', 'would', 'begin', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'spot-on', 'not', 'being', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'not', 'presenting', 'people', 'victims', 'not', 'distracting', 'story', 'line', 'details', 'passengers.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'flight', 'course', 'impression', 'was', 'film', 'got', 'right', 'what', 'could', 'get', 'right', 'using', 'interviews', 'transcripts', 'other', 'sources', 'found', 'reasonable', 'choices', 'when', 'had', 'estimate', 'Even', 'very', 'ending', 'was', 'probably', 'wise', 'avoided', 'potentially', 'controversial', 'position', 'last', 'few', 'seconds.The', 'film', 'place', 'three', 'segments', 'uneventful', 'early-day', 'setup', 'initial', 'hijackings', 'realization', 'controllers', 'impossible', 'contemplate', 'was', 'actually', 'unfolding', '93', 'including', 'implication', 'delayed', 'takeoff', '93', 'Newark', 'actually', 'allowed', 'passengers', 'know', 'were', 'part', 'far', 'bigger', 'event', 'draw', 'horrible', 'conclusions', 'prompted', 'action', 'board.The', 'use', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'actresses', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'avoiding', 'distraction', 'famous', 're-inforcing', 'idea', 'collection', 'random', 'people', 'together', 'still', 'capable', 'doing', 'exception', 'someone', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'been', 'plane', 'premise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'director', 'remarks', 'Ben', 'Sliney', 'head', 'national', 'air', 'traffic', 'center', 'one', 'who', 'shut', 'down', 'American', 'air', 'space', 'was', 'played', 'Fine', 'move', 'great', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Sliney', 'other', 'other', 'real', 'controllers', 'film.The', 'supporting', 'material', 'families', 'touching', 'director', 'commentary', 'value.So', 'why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', '4.5', 'documentary', 'approach', 'number', 'non-acting', 'professionals', 'number', 'hand-held', 'shots', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'make', 'unusual', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'judge', 'what', 'normal', 'movie.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'Jere', 'Longman', 'book', 'anybody', 'interested', 'UAL', '93']",United 93

I had watched the Discovery Channel docu-drama, The Flight That Fought Back at home, and paced the living room the whole time. Moistened up at both films, too.My cinematic tastes are a bit old-fashioned, I guess. The herky-jerky shoulder-mounted camera work, used throughout, was effective in the action scenes, but the rest of the time it just reminded me of early MTV videos. And we didn't get any background development of the passengers, given the you-are-there POV. (The Discovery Channel's film was much more informative--and therefore poignant--because of the relatives' onscreen interviews.  The featurette in this dvd fixes that, though).Not surprisingly, most of the acting is a series of reaction shots. The growing horror of the flight controllers as the attacks multiply is possibly the best thing about the film. That guy playing himself as the top civil aviation cheese was especially good, vis-a-vis that.It ends too abruptly for me, with a POV shot of the plane crashing. I mentally filled in some coda scenes, like someone looking up at the sound of the crash, and seeing the mushroom cloud rising over the countryside. Or more scenes of muddle at NORAD and other ATC centers, as they try to catch up with events. Or the congressional staffers, evacuated from the Capitol, slowly realizing that the Flight 93 passengers have saved their lives. But the film instead ends along with the lives of all aboard the flight.So, considered in a vacuum, it's a quote pretty good film unquote. Given the political climate in Hollywood, it's a near miracle. Recall, please: the first thing the film industry did after 9/11 was alter or delay all the major projects that showed Arabs as terrorists. Then they & the liberal news media got to work giving that celluloid string of lies Fahrenheit 9/11 a big launch.The terrorists in United 93, though they are shown praying and trying to control the butterflies in their stomachs, are clearly presented as evil. There's no social commentary at all--nor any shying away from the Islam element-- unless it was woven in too symbolically for me to catch it at first viewing.

644321,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JOZI,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[6, 7]","Director:  Paul GreengrassCast:  Christian Clemenson, Trish Gates, Polly Adams, Cheyenne Jackson, Opal Alladin, Gary Commock, Nancy McDoniel, David Allen Basche, Richard Bekins.Running Time: 111 minutesRated R for language and some intense sequences of terror and violence (although a PG-13 rating is probably more appropriate and the film's producers have appealed the initial rating).There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement that can describe the feelings you endure along ""United 93"". Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.Shot in real time, on digital camera, ""United 93"" begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves - particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behavior that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what ""Titanic"" was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-""Titanic"": there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of ""United 93"" are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Great Britain that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, ""United 93"" is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film viewer all we could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong and certainly a piece of art.",5,United 93 (2006),1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,4777,"['Director', 'Paul', 'GreengrassCast', 'Christian', 'Clemenson', 'Trish', 'Gates', 'Polly', 'Adams', 'Cheyenne', 'Jackson', 'Opal', 'Alladin', 'Gary', 'Commock', 'Nancy', 'McDoniel', 'David', 'Allen', 'Basche', 'Richard', 'Bekins.Running', 'Time', '111', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'intense', 'sequences', 'terror', 'violence', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'probably', 'more', 'appropriate', 'film', 'producers', 'have', 'appealed', 'initial', 'rating', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'notes', 'could', 'take', 'be', 'equilibrious', 'opening', 'terrifying', 'denouement', 'can', 'describe', 'feelings', 'endure', 'United', '93', 'Ample', 'publicity', 'been', 'sold', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'new', 'movie', 'debating', 'veracity', 'story', 'was', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'How', 'soon', 'too', 'soon', 'How', 'long', 'did', 'America', 'wait', 'tell', 'Vietnam', 'nightmares', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'blasphemous', 'even', 'entertain', 'idea', 'shooting', 'movie', '9/11', 'yet', 'controversy', 'United', '93', 'here', 'will', 'attract', 'audience', 'regardless', 'maybe', 'even', 'result', 'negative', 'press.Shot', 'real', 'time', 'digital', 'camera', 'United', '93', 'showing', 'terrorists', 'making', 'final', 'morning', 'prayers', 'setting', 'off', 'airport', 'are', 'handsome', 'grins', 'are', 'there', 'nasty', 'frowns', 'men', 'anything', 'look', 'more', 'terrified', 'ever', 'could', 'Their', 'intentions', 'are', 'hidden', 'obvious', 'human', 'front', 'continually', 'odds', 'then', 'shift', 'airport', 'other', 'passengers', 'none', 'are', 'ever', 'given', 'emotional', 'edge', 'film', 'visit', 'men', 'women', 'running', 'airwaves', 'particularly', 'responsible', 'what', 'should', 'happen', 'case', 'emergencies', 'Many', 'actors', 'betraying', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'tragic', 'day', 'Using', 'non-actors', 'Greengrass', 'film', 'authentic', 'breeze', 'dialogue', 'behavior', 'never', 'forced', 'embellished', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'feel', 'individual', 'character', 'believe', 'word', 'say', 'truly', 'understand', 'circumstances', 'were', 'put', 'tragedies', 'unfolded', 'learn', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'get', 'touch', 'White', 'House', 'when', 'people', 'needed', 'government', 'most', 'also', 'learn', 'confusion', 'experienced', 'planes', 'went', 'strangely', 'course', 'conclusive', 'knowledge', 'hijacking', 'had', 'been', 'established', 'film', 'biggest', 'power', 'chilling', 'reenactment', 'fate', 'flight', '93', 'forms', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'are', 'completely', 'dropped', 'can', 'feel', 'unease', 'just', 'soft', 'subtle', 'touch', 'film', 'score', 'opening', 'characters', 'act', 'man', 'would', 'types', 'totally', 'conventional', 'circumstances', 'Greengrass', 'not', 'incorporate', 'view', 'hindsight', 'audience', 'instead', 'allowing', 'film', 'flow', 'moment', 'passing', 'event', 'happening', 'characters', 'read', 'rather', 'what', 'audience', 'already', ""n't"", 'movie', 'much', 'headway', 'dramatic', 'convention', 'satisfy', 'are', 'needs', 'entertainment', 'perhaps', 'what', 'Titanic', 'was', 'aiming', 'do', 'ever', 'do', 'what', 'great', 'effect', 'tribute', 'courage', 'bravery', 'passengers', 'staff', 'aboard', 'United', '93.Paul', 'Grenngrass', 'masterpiece', 'anti-', 'Titanic', 'are', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'dastardly', 'bad', 'guys', 'romantic', 'journeys', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'poetic', 'license', 'as', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'movie', 'characters', 'United', '93', 'are', 'so', 'authentic', 'mundane', 'times', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'have', 'depth', 'are', 'meant', 'go', 'life-affirming', 'changes', 'film', 'fine', 'illustration', 'similar', 'faux-documentaries', 'Greengrass', 'directed', 'native', 'Great', 'Britain', 'documents', 'haunting', 'ordeal', 'induced', 'passengers', 'subsequent', 'bravery', 'attempting', 'foil', 'terrorists', 'final', 'sequence', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'set-pieces', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'managing', 'raise', 'strand', 'body', 'electric', 'edge', 'passengers', 'desperately', 'try', 'kick', 'down', 'cabin', 'door', 'when', 'one', 'blisteringly', 'quick', 'moment', 'hope', 'actually', 'believed', 'can', 'prevent', 'can', 'save', 'reason', 'alone', 'masterful', 'piece', 'work', 'deserving', 'highest', 'praise', 'film', 'can', 'receive', 'Regardless', 'what', 'stance', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'United', '93', 'film', 'have', 'see', 'owe', 'people', 'fittingly', 'faux-reality', 'style', 'bravery', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'ask', 'film', 'work', 'piece', 'art', 'anyone', 'should', 'ever', 'ask', 'times', 'worrying', 'distressing', 'haunting', 'terrifying', 'never', 'wrong', 'certainly', 'piece', 'art']",United 93

644324,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOZI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[15, 18]","""United 93"" is a difficult film to watch. Not only because of the difficult subject matter but also because of how director Paul Greengrass handles the material.Naturally, any film depicting any part of the horror of the events of September 11, 2001 is going to be a hot button and ""United 93' is no exception. When the previews began playing in theaters, people protested and it was pulled from at least one theater in New York.But the film is very moving and emotional. Writer and director Paul Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"") deserves a lot of credit for showing restraint. We really don't `meet' any of the characters, or learn very much about them, we merely observe them and we watch as the flight crew, the passengers, the air traffic controllers, the military and the terrorists enter the story for the first time. Greengrass begins the film as the terrorists are praying, before they leave for the airport and he doesn't stop the narrative each time someone new enters the story to introduce them, provide back story, motivation or reason. In a conventional narrative film, this is mandatory and the lack of these elements would drive me mad. But in ""United 93"", Greengrass doesn't use these elements and it forces us to watch the events as if it were a documentary or we are eavesdropping. Because of this, we witness the events unfold with clearer vision, which makes it all the more difficult to watch.Greengrass has populated the film with many less recognizable character actors; I only recognized many of the faces because I see a lot of films. He also asked a number of real life people who were involved in the events of the day to participate, allowing them to recreate their own actions. Thankfully, he chose against casting A List actors in some of the roles, allowing all of the characters to remain even and real, aiding the documentary look and feel of the film.Naturally, it will be difficult for many people to watch ""United 93"". The director has made an emotional, powerful, restrained film which will not make it easier.But it is an important film to watch. Maybe not today, next week or even next month. But we all need to see it, if for no other reason than to remind future generations because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.",4,"Restrained, Unflinching Look At Horror",1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,2294,"['United', '93', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'Not', 'only', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'how', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'material.Naturally', 'film', 'depicting', 'part', 'horror', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001', 'going', 'be', 'hot', 'button', 'United', '93', 'exception', 'When', 'previews', 'began', 'playing', 'theaters', 'people', 'protested', 'was', 'pulled', 'least', 'one', 'theater', 'New', 'York.But', 'film', 'very', 'moving', 'emotional', 'Writer', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'lot', 'credit', 'showing', 'restraint', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'characters', 'learn', 'very', 'much', 'merely', 'observe', 'watch', 'flight', 'crew', 'passengers', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'military', 'terrorists', 'enter', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'Greengrass', 'film', 'terrorists', 'are', 'praying', 'leave', 'airport', ""n't"", 'stop', 'narrative', 'time', 'someone', 'new', 'enters', 'story', 'introduce', 'provide', 'back', 'story', 'motivation', 'reason', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'film', 'mandatory', 'lack', 'elements', 'would', 'drive', 'mad', 'United', '93', 'Greengrass', ""n't"", 'use', 'elements', 'watch', 'events', 'were', 'documentary', 'are', 'eavesdropping', 'witness', 'events', 'unfold', 'clearer', 'vision', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch.Greengrass', 'populated', 'film', 'many', 'less', 'recognizable', 'character', 'actors', 'only', 'recognized', 'many', 'see', 'lot', 'films', 'also', 'asked', 'number', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'events', 'day', 'participate', 'allowing', 'recreate', 'own', 'actions', 'Thankfully', 'chose', 'casting', 'List', 'actors', 'roles', 'allowing', 'characters', 'remain', 'even', 'real', 'aiding', 'documentary', 'look', 'feel', 'film.Naturally', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'many', 'people', 'watch', 'United', '93', 'director', 'made', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'restrained', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'easier.But', 'important', 'film', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'not', 'today', 'next', 'week', 'even', 'next', 'month', 'need', 'see', 'other', 'reason', 'remind', 'future', 'generations', 'who', 'forget', 'history', 'are', 'doomed', 'repeat']",United 93
644325,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JOZI,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 3]","Watching Paul Greengrass' ""UNITED 93"" is an exercise in anxiety. We all know that the ending is not going to be pretty, and that, as much as our dream would have been for the passenger heroics to have stopped the hijackers and saved the plane; instead there is a big section of torn up field in Western Pennsylvania where the plane ultimately stopped.The question is, then, is the film created with respect and dignity, or is it just another big budget lump? The answer splits at about 90% in favor of good.By using unknown actors and people who actually were real-life participants as Sept 11 unfolded, Greengrass avoids the ticky-tacky sentiment and - in a gutwrenching way - forces these men and women to relive that horrible morning all over again. The actors cast were not picked for their dramatic skills as much as their everyday looks and behavior. They spend much of their early screen time making idle chat or calling work on their cell phones, unaware of their impending fates. The timeline cuts back and forth between the Air Traffic and FAA teams, the military and the plane itself.The story is told in real time, filmed on handheld cameras that force a lack of opinion into ""United 93"" (as opposed to the made for TVFlight 93: The Movie). Greengrass captures the confusion and panic, especially the utter horror of the Newark Airport employees as they see the second plane hit the towers. In that regard, ""United 93"" is unlike just about anything you'll ever see.That remaining 10%, you ask? ""Untied 93"" can't help but indulge in populist myth-making. Greengrass made a valiant effort to get the approval of the passenger/crews family members before embarking on this movie's production. In the bonus documentary, some of the actors meet the families of the deceased, sometimes being more emotional than I'd wager the actors were prepared for. But my guess is, because of that need for confirmation and approval from these folks, almost every person on the flight plays an active role in taking on the terrorists. (With the exception of the one semi-foreign sounding man...which I found pointless.) But we don't know what happened. We can't know what was said. Did one of the passengers really say ""I'll break his wrists""? Did the hostesses really join the charge? Or was this just Greengrass' empathy getting the better of him? And despite the fact that those herky-jerky hand-carried camera shots added to the tension and claustrophobia of the scenes inside the plane, there were moments when my inner-critic started grousing ""buy this man a dman steadi-cam, already.""That said, ""United 93"" is an affecting piece of film-making. It offers proof that not every major-studio offering gives into the lowest common denominator, and offers us, as citizen viewers, an opportunity to better comprehend the events that will forever mark our generation.

644326,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B00005JOZI,Timothy Michael Resh,"[15, 15]","Every once in awhile, a film comes along that is so understated that it blows me away, and this was such a film.  By concentrating on the mundane details that the passengers, crew, and air traffic controllers were dealing with at the time of the attacks on America, Greengrass puts together a stunningly cinema verite representation of the actual events.By using all unknown actors (as well as a few actual ATC staff, playing themselves) the director sensitively portrays the confusion, the conflict, the struggle, and the heroism that ensued.  At its core, United 93 is a human tragedy, and Greengrass' meticulous, real-time recreation of every moment from boarding to impact reminds us of the human impact of the event.The film is extremely intense and realistic, but if the viewer can handle the underlying reality of the film, it is well worth the emotional toll it inflicts on the viewer.  For a more emotionally wrenching tragic/heroic double feature, consider watching United 93 and Oliver Stone's equally intense World Trade Center in one sitting.  You'll be haunted by the ghosts of that terrible day when the world, quite literally came crashing down around us, and recall with terrible clarity your feelings from that day.Some people think it is too soon to open these wounds from which our country is still healing, but these sensitive profiles in courage stand as a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives on that terrible day in our nation's history.",5,Riveting and Gut-wrenchingly powerful,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,1471,"['once', 'awhile', 'film', 'so', 'understated', 'away', 'was', 'such', 'film', 'concentrating', 'mundane', 'details', 'passengers', 'crew', 'air', 'traffic', 'controllers', 'were', 'dealing', 'time', 'attacks', 'America', 'Greengrass', 'together', 'stunningly', 'cinema', 'verite', 'representation', 'actual', 'events.By', 'using', 'unknown', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'actual', 'ATC', 'staff', 'playing', 'director', 'sensitively', 'confusion', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'heroism', 'ensued', 'core', 'United', '93', 'human', 'tragedy', 'Greengrass', 'meticulous', 'real-time', 'recreation', 'moment', 'boarding', 'impact', 'reminds', 'human', 'impact', 'event.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'intense', 'realistic', 'viewer', 'can', 'handle', 'underlying', 'reality', 'film', 'well', 'emotional', 'toll', 'viewer', 'more', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'tragic/heroic', 'double', 'feature', 'consider', 'watching', 'United', '93', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'equally', 'intense', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'one', 'sitting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'terrible', 'day', 'when', 'world', 'quite', 'literally', 'came', 'crashing', 'down', 'recall', 'terrible', 'clarity', 'feelings', 'day.Some', 'people', 'think', 'too', 'soon', 'open', 'wounds', 'country', 'still', 'healing', 'sensitive', 'profiles', 'courage', 'stand', 'fitting', 'memorial', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'terrible', 'day', 'nation', 'history']",United 93

644329,A233QN6P2EEKPS,B00005JOZI,Tom Collier,"[28, 33]","United 93 contains many haunting moments, but one comes of great surprise. At an air traffic command center, the staff stands about, confused over reports of a hijacking. A plane has disappeared from the grid, and they don't know what to make of it. Someone brings CNN up on the large viewing screen, they stand, baffled, at the image of a smoking hole in the north tower of the World Trade Center. Reliving the beginning of the attack, only armed with the knowledge we have now, is shattering in a very unexpected way.British director Paul Greengrass' has put together a look at 9/11 with a narrow focus, but with searing strength and focus that puts the viewer in the center of the action in a way not seen since Saving Private Ryan's D-Day assault sequence. We already know the terrible outcome, but watch with curiosity and suspense, secretly hoping that perhaps history can change, if just for this one movie. Just because we know it won't doesn't make the final passenger assault any less gripping or heartbreaking.Shot in the British docu-drama style that severed the Greengrass-directed The Bourne Supremacy so well, the film never once feels like fiction, but an omnipresent insider's view of the action. The plot moves quickly but with great dread, scenes inside air command inter-cut with the doomed flight, where the four hijackers anxiously await their time to strike. On the ground, chaos runs rampant, with hundreds of people frantically trying to coordinate a response, ounces of clarity coming bundled with pounds of confusion.Many of the air control and military personnel are played not by actors, but by the real people, which some have said augments the authenticity.  I instead offer the argument that the plane sequences seem so realistic, that Greengrass could have effortlessly pulled off the same effect using a cast entirely composed of actors. The film's accuracy stems from its incredible power, not the other way around.Much has been made about the film's lack of a political stance, but all films are political, whether or not they know it. The hijackers are shown as real people, true, but it seems childish to imagine that evil men don't form relationships, shave, or get nervous. The sympathy rests exclusively with the victims, who each receive as much screen time as they require, and no more. I struggled to hear names and hints of who each passenger was, but the only one I recognized for sure was Jeremy Glick, a judo expert who the film theorizes lead the charge. Most of the passenger dialogue involves planning the attack, or very painfully, final phone calls home.One shocking moment that has received little press (as of now) comes towards the end, where a German passenger tries to alert the hijackers to the rebellion before being restrained. I researched the incident, but could find nothing to support the event, except that a German man was in fact on the plane. Was Greengrass trying to portray Americans as the people who stand up and fight back against terror, while cowards like the Germans would rather negotiate and surrender? Maybe not, but the argument could certainly be made.If the takeover of the plane is gruesome, the passenger's assault serves as a moment of bloody catharsis. It would be hard not to feel a small piece of joy as the hijackers panic, terrified that instead of becoming part of a holy missile to destroy the U.S. Capitol Building, they are going to be quite literally torn to pieces by furious passengers. I suspect that after the horrified screams of the passengers, the film's most talked about sound effect will be the sickening crunch of a fire extinguisher caving in a hijacker's skull.Endlessly talked about in the mainstream press, United 93 interestingly hasn't received as much buzz as it might amongst audiences. Many feel the film comes too soon after 9/11, while others are apprehensive about having to view the event through the eyes of the dead. Is United 93 too soon?United 93 not only isn't too soon, it hasn't arrived quickly enough. It succeeds at honoring the victims of 9/11 beyond the wildest expectation. Appropriately harrowing and terrifying, it instantly reaches a realm of importance that few films do. To avoid this genuinely relevant and amazing film out of fear would be a disservice to oneself and the memory of those portrayed within. Mark my words, there won't be a more important work of art made for a long time to come.",5,United 93 an amazing accout of a tragic day,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,4433,"['United', '93', 'contains', 'many', 'haunting', 'moments', 'one', 'great', 'surprise', 'air', 'traffic', 'command', 'center', 'staff', 'confused', 'reports', 'hijacking', 'plane', 'disappeared', 'grid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Someone', 'CNN', 'up', 'large', 'viewing', 'screen', 'stand', 'baffled', 'image', 'smoking', 'hole', 'north', 'tower', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Reliving', 'beginning', 'attack', 'only', 'armed', 'knowledge', 'have', 'now', 'shattering', 'very', 'unexpected', 'way.British', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'put', 'together', 'look', '9/11', 'narrow', 'focus', 'searing', 'strength', 'focus', 'viewer', 'center', 'action', 'way', 'not', 'seen', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'D-Day', 'assault', 'sequence', 'already', 'know', 'terrible', 'outcome', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'suspense', 'secretly', 'hoping', 'perhaps', 'history', 'can', 'change', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'Just', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'passenger', 'assault', 'less', 'gripping', 'heartbreaking.Shot', 'British', 'docu-drama', 'style', 'severed', 'Greengrass-directed', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'feels', 'fiction', 'omnipresent', 'insider', 'view', 'action', 'plot', 'moves', 'quickly', 'great', 'dread', 'scenes', 'air', 'command', 'inter-cut', 'doomed', 'flight', 'where', 'four', 'hijackers', 'anxiously', 'await', 'time', 'strike', 'ground', 'chaos', 'runs', 'rampant', 'hundreds', 'people', 'frantically', 'trying', 'coordinate', 'response', 'ounces', 'clarity', 'coming', 'bundled', 'pounds', 'confusion.Many', 'air', 'control', 'military', 'personnel', 'are', 'played', 'not', 'actors', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'augments', 'authenticity', 'instead', 'offer', 'argument', 'plane', 'sequences', 'seem', 'so', 'realistic', 'Greengrass', 'could', 'have', 'effortlessly', 'pulled', 'off', 'same', 'effect', 'using', 'cast', 'entirely', 'composed', 'actors', 'film', 'accuracy', 'incredible', 'power', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'around.Much', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'lack', 'political', 'stance', 'films', 'are', 'political', 'not', 'know', 'hijackers', 'are', 'shown', 'real', 'people', 'true', 'childish', 'imagine', 'evil', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'form', 'relationships', 'shave', 'get', 'nervous', 'sympathy', 'rests', 'exclusively', 'victims', 'who', 'receive', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'require', 'more', 'struggled', 'hear', 'names', 'hints', 'who', 'passenger', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'recognized', 'sure', 'was', 'Jeremy', 'Glick', 'judo', 'expert', 'who', 'film', 'lead', 'charge', 'Most', 'passenger', 'dialogue', 'planning', 'attack', 'very', 'painfully', 'final', 'phone', 'home.One', 'shocking', 'moment', 'received', 'little', 'press', 'now', 'end', 'where', 'German', 'passenger', 'tries', 'alert', 'hijackers', 'rebellion', 'being', 'restrained', 'researched', 'incident', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'support', 'event', 'German', 'man', 'was', 'fact', 'plane', 'Was', 'Greengrass', 'trying', 'portray', 'Americans', 'people', 'who', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'back', 'terror', 'cowards', 'Germans', 'would', 'rather', 'negotiate', 'surrender', 'Maybe', 'not', 'argument', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'made.If', 'takeover', 'plane', 'gruesome', 'passenger', 'assault', 'moment', 'bloody', 'catharsis', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'small', 'piece', 'joy', 'hijackers', 'panic', 'terrified', 'instead', 'becoming', 'part', 'holy', 'missile', 'destroy', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'Building', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'literally', 'torn', 'pieces', 'furious', 'passengers', 'suspect', 'horrified', 'screams', 'passengers', 'film', 'most', 'talked', 'sound', 'effect', 'will', 'be', 'sickening', 'crunch', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'caving', 'hijacker', 'skull.Endlessly', 'talked', 'mainstream', 'press', 'United', '93', 'interestingly', ""n't"", 'received', 'as', 'much', 'buzz', 'might', 'amongst', 'audiences', 'Many', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'soon', '9/11', 'others', 'are', 'apprehensive', 'having', 'view', 'event', 'eyes', 'dead', 'United', '93', 'too', 'soon', 'United', '93', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'too', 'soon', ""n't"", 'arrived', 'quickly', 'enough', 'honoring', 'victims', '9/11', 'wildest', 'expectation', 'Appropriately', 'harrowing', 'terrifying', 'instantly', 'realm', 'importance', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'avoid', 'genuinely', 'relevant', 'amazing', 'film', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'disservice', 'oneself', 'memory', 'portrayed', 'Mark', 'words', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'important', 'work', 'art', 'made', 'long', 'time', 'come']",United 93
644330,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOZI,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","It is a tough watch from the very beginning because we know what will happen in the next two hours of the film. `United 93' is still a film that deserves praise not only because of its subject matter, but because of the way it treats it on the screen. It is certain that this is not a film that you can casually watch; some people would never watch it (and I don't blame them for it). But if you're still wondering, all I can say is ""If not now, when?""Director Paul Greengrass's semi-documentary style with a shaky camera captures the intense atmosphere of the places. `United 93' unfolds on two levels simultaneously - both in the hijacked plane, and in the controlling room on the ground one after the other. The confusion and tension can be of course re-created in books or documentary films, but Greengrass who four years before made terrific `Bloody Sunday' based on the 1972 Irish Civil Right march and its subsequent events, knows the power of cinema, or how films can have us relate to the people in it.I must write about two things here before ending my review. Some say the detailed accounts of the incidents depicted in `United 93,' especially those on the airplane and her crew and passengers, are not entirely based on the confirmed facts. True, and God only knows what happened on United 93, or whether or not the passengers succeeded in breaking into the cockpit. But I can also say that the film is much more convincing and even truthful than those  conspiracy theories about 9/11.There has been discussion on whether or not the film is exploitation. Honestly, I don't know. But is there any other way of recording and presenting this tragedy without being `exploitive'? Or should we wait another 50 years or more to film it while we know it is about the present time and us? Ultimately it comes to this question: ""If not now, when?""Always being somber, `United 93' refuses to be sensational - all the more reason for the film to be challenging and gut-wrenching.",5,United 93 --  Challenging and Gut-wrenching,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1979,"['tough', 'watch', 'very', 'beginning', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'United', '93', 'still', 'film', 'praise', 'not', 'only', 'subject', 'matter', 'way', 'screen', 'certain', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'casually', 'watch', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', ""'re"", 'still', 'wondering', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'now', 'when', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'semi-documentary', 'style', 'shaky', 'camera', 'intense', 'atmosphere', 'places', 'United', '93', 'unfolds', 'two', 'levels', 'simultaneously', 'hijacked', 'plane', 'controlling', 'room', 'ground', 'one', 'other', 'confusion', 'tension', 'can', 'be', 'course', 're-created', 'books', 'documentary', 'films', 'Greengrass', 'who', 'four', 'years', 'made', 'terrific', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'based', '1972', 'Irish', 'Civil', 'Right', 'march', 'subsequent', 'events', 'power', 'cinema', 'how', 'films', 'can', 'have', 'relate', 'people', 'it.I', 'must', 'write', 'two', 'things', 'here', 'ending', 'review', 'say', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'incidents', 'depicted', 'United', '93', 'especially', 'airplane', 'crew', 'passengers', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'based', 'confirmed', 'facts', 'True', 'God', 'only', 'what', 'happened', 'United', '93', 'not', 'passengers', 'succeeded', 'breaking', 'cockpit', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'even', 'truthful', 'conspiracy', 'theories', '9/11.There', 'been', 'discussion', 'not', 'film', 'exploitation', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'other', 'way', 'recording', 'presenting', 'tragedy', 'being', 'exploitive', 'should', 'wait', '50', 'years', 'more', 'film', 'know', 'present', 'time', 'Ultimately', 'question', 'not', 'now', 'when', 'Always', 'being', 'somber', 'United', '93', 'refuses', 'be', 'sensational', 'more', 'reason', 'film', 'be', 'challenging', 'gut-wrenching']",United 93

One, WORLD TRADE CENTER, was a film from Oliver Stone about two first responders who were saved from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  Though WORLD TRADE CENTER is a good and solid film, it does not reach the achievement that Paul Greengrass was able to do with UNITED 93.Filmed in a style that seems to be a dreamy cinema verite (though every moment on film was carefully constructed), UNITED 93 tells the story about the one plane that went down on September 11th that didn't hit its target.  United 93 was supposed to have crashed either into the White House or the Capitol Building, but because of the bravery and courage displayed by the men and women on board, the plane never reached that area and crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  No one alive can say exactly for sure what happened aboard the plane that day.  However, UNITED 93 does an incredible job of recreating what possibly happened.Paul Greengrass and the filmmakers spent an incredible amount of time talking with the family members of those who died.  They listened intently to the tape recordings on board the plane and messages left behind.  I'm sure that hundreds of hours of research went into creating the film and it shows on film.  No big name actors were cast in the film and many of the smaller roles were played by people who had actually been involved somehow with United 93 on September 11th.  It is an ensemble cast of the truest kind.I was deeply moved while watching UNITED 93.  The outcome is already known before even putting the film into the DVD player.  Yet, the foreknowledge takes nothing away from the experience.  The people on the plane reminded me of some of my own friends and family members and even though I knew they were going to die, their actions as portrayed in the film gave me hope.  UNITED 93 is a powerful piece of cinema, testifying to what ordinary people can do when faced against extraordinary circumstances.  The Academy might have ignored it, but UNITED 93 is the best picture of 2006 and a fitting tribute to the men and women who died that day.The DVD includes a commentary with Director Paul Greengrass which I found much more interesting, intriguing, and thought-provoking than many other commentaries I have listened to.  There's also a short documentary entitled ""United 93:  The Families and the Film"" that interviews family members of those killed and their reactions to the film.  Finally, there is a biography page that includes a small picture and a written biography about the 40 people on board (not including the hijackers) who died because of the hijacking.",5,The Real Best Picture of 2006,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2684,"['2006', 'two', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'September', '11', '2001', 'were', 'released', 'One', 'WORLD', 'TRADE', 'CENTER', 'was', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'two', 'first', 'responders', 'who', 'were', 'saved', 'wreckage', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Though', 'WORLD', 'TRADE', 'CENTER', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'not', 'reach', 'achievement', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'UNITED', '93.Filmed', 'style', 'be', 'dreamy', 'cinema', 'verite', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'UNITED', '93', 'story', 'one', 'plane', 'went', 'down', 'September', '11th', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'target', 'United', '93', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'crashed', 'White', 'House', 'Capitol', 'Building', 'bravery', 'courage', 'displayed', 'men', 'women', 'board', 'plane', 'never', 'reached', 'area', 'crashed', 'field', 'Shanksville', 'Pennsylvania', 'one', 'alive', 'can', 'say', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'plane', 'day', 'However', '93', 'incredible', 'job', 'recreating', 'what', 'possibly', 'happened.Paul', 'Greengrass', 'filmmakers', 'spent', 'incredible', 'amount', 'time', 'talking', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'died', 'listened', 'intently', 'tape', 'board', 'plane', 'messages', 'left', ""'m"", 'sure', 'hundreds', 'hours', 'research', 'went', 'creating', 'film', 'film', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'film', 'many', 'smaller', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'involved', 'somehow', 'United', '93', 'September', '11th', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'truest', 'kind.I', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'watching', 'UNITED', '93', 'outcome', 'already', 'known', 'before', 'even', 'putting', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'foreknowledge', 'nothing', 'away', 'experience', 'people', 'plane', 'reminded', 'own', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'even', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'actions', 'portrayed', 'film', 'gave', 'hope', 'UNITED', '93', 'powerful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'testifying', 'what', 'ordinary', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'faced', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'Academy', 'might', 'have', 'ignored', 'UNITED', '93', 'best', 'picture', '2006', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'died', 'day.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'many', 'other', 'commentaries', 'have', 'listened', 'also', 'short', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'United', '93', 'Families', 'Film', 'interviews', 'family', 'members', 'killed', 'reactions', 'film', 'Finally', 'biography', 'page', 'small', 'picture', 'written', 'biography', '40', 'people', 'board', 'not', 'including', 'hijackers', 'who', 'died', 'hijacking']",United 93

Their courage was nothing short of remarkable.A couple of things I didn't like about the movie however, one was many of the scenes in the airport tower I couldn't hear, they had the background noise of people talking too loud and it was very difficult to decipher background noise from the main person talking.Also, I didn't care for the ending, yes it was dramatic, but there was a sense of ""is this movie really over now?""

The film's editing, camera work, and direction are all worthy of Oscar awards.  Director Paul Greengrass delivers a picture that defies Hollywood melodrama and instead pointedly recreates in real time the events that occurred on board United flight 93, the morning of Sept.11th 2001. The film kept me on edge throughout its almost 2 hour run time.  This was not done through theatrical artificiality, but through tight editing, ultra realistic performances from the actors, and the tension broiling amongst the air traffic controllers, military commanders, the terrorists and the passengers.

The only tie is Greengrass' hand-handle technique.  The presentation was disjointed.  I did not connect with any of the people.  I can make this point, because Director Greengrass snippets of various passengers in ""United 93,"" that were powerful enough to make me care very much about them.  So, I think Director Greengrass evolved in this aspect of his up close technique.As a matter of fact, I just ordered Greengrass ""United 93"" Working Script from Amazon to see exactly how Greengrass scripted the everyday actions of the passengers on the plane before terror struck as well as their individual reactions after the plane was taken over.",5,"9/11, WTC",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1355,"['came', '9/11', 'movie', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'title', 'thought', 'United', '93', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'glad', 'ordered', 'was', 'hard', 'watching', 'passengers', 'treating', 'day', 'just', 'day', 'just', 'flight', 'knowing', 'finale', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'said', 'felt', 'better', 'end', 'film', 'passengers', 'fought', 'fiercely', 'lives.Bloody', 'Sunday', '[', 'VHS', ']', ""'m"", 'working', 'backwards', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'body', 'work', 'starting', 'United', '93', 'then', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'never', 'heard', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'movie', 'event', 'happened', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'adult.This', 'event', 'was', 'horific', 'However', 'guess', 'was', 'spoiled', 'Greengrass', 'later', 'works', 'only', 'tie', 'Greengrass', 'hand-handle', 'technique', 'presentation', 'was', 'disjointed', 'did', 'not', 'connect', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'point', 'Director', 'Greengrass', 'snippets', 'various', 'passengers', 'United', '93', 'were', 'powerful', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'So', 'think', 'Director', 'Greengrass', 'evolved', 'aspect', 'up', 'close', 'matter', 'fact', 'just', 'ordered', 'Greengrass', 'United', '93', 'Working', 'Script', 'Amazon', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'Greengrass', 'scripted', 'everyday', 'actions', 'passengers', 'plane', 'terror', 'struck', 'as', 'well', 'individual', 'reactions', 'plane', 'was', 'taken', 'over']",United 93

It is brilliant in its structure (the movie is told in real time) and compassionate in its intent (director Paul Greengrass refused to make the film without the support of the families of the passengers and crew).Those who argued last spring that it was ""too soon"" for a 9/11 movie were making their arguments based on psychological wounds that, for some, haven't healed. And that is unfortunate, as I found the film quite therapeutic. I have never (NEVER) sobbed so hard at a film.But dont' get me wrong...the movie doesn't exploit, nor does it point any fingers or draw any conclusions. It simply watches events as they unfold. Greengrass' decision not to use mega-stars for this story was deliberate; as was the decision to keep away from the Hollywood formula of portraying the characters as people with histories and sappy backstories. What we know about the passengers of this doomed flight are what we would have known had we been sitting next to them: absolutely nothing, save for what they were wearing or how they styled their hair or what book they were reading.And that is what makes the staggering horror of the final moments of this film so monumental. You are right there with these passengers as they fight the ultimate fight to overtake their hijackers. American Everymen emerging from the chaos of that unbelievable morning with courage and heroism.Even five years later there are many who still exploit 9/11 for political gain or turn its history into popular myth.

Three planes found their targets.  ""United 93"" is the story of the fourth.The film covers the entire morning of September 11, with the closest thing to a ""lead"" being FAA Director of Operations Ben Sliney, whose portrays himself on his first day on the job with a remarkable performance for a neophyte actor.  Several other officials and military personal re-create their roles on that faithful day.Selecting a number of people to play themselves was the first step writer/director Peter Greengrass made to present the events in the film as they truly happened.  Greengrass allows the drama to build itself, steering clear of manufactured moments of melodrama many would expect from a movie about a doomed aircraft.The film also refuses to use hindsight in determining which facts to emphasize and has total ambivalence for the cultural impact of some people/events.  No special significance if given to Beamer's ""let's roll"" direction that became a rallying cry for America and no reference is made to the group being lead by a hulkish homosexual who helped redefine the image of effeminate gays in a pre-Brokeback world.  Even though those have been two important stories to come from Flight 93, nobody on the flight that day knew it...so the film doesn`t revise reality to acknowledge them.The brilliance of a film like this can be understood by comparing it to the film many would have made instead.  A lesser film would have Brad Pitt or Eric Bana playing Mark Bingham and Matt Damon or Tom Cruise playing Todd Beamer.  The action would have slowed for the characters to capture the focus of the audience and build cliched subplots about lifelong struggles to overcome adversity.  Their final rush to glory would have been a moment of catharsis, as they were able to overcome some fault that haunted them for years.Thankfully, ""United 93"" is not that film.  It is an unflinching, unromanticized account of the events of 9/11.  Free from conspiracy speculation or total disdain for our enemies (they are confused, naive men; not mustache twirling villains), the film offers little or no politics/values.  Michael Moore fans will most likely not enjoy this movie because it doesn't take aim directly at our government and doesn't spend time blaming America and claiming we created a world where 9/11 was inevitable.People will come away with different ideas about how the morning unfolded.  Some will unfairly say the FAA, NORAD and the military were too slow in reacting to the initial hijackings.  But I believe by showing the events in real time, audiences see how fast everything unfolded, giving little chance of preventing the terrorists from carrying out their first three missions.  The only thing standing in the way of the last were the people aboard United 93.  And on the worst day in America's history, one group of normal citizens banded together to show the resolve and bravery that continues to move a grateful nation and will forever earn them the title of ""heroes"".",5,It is as it was,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3139,"['America', 'darkest', 'day', 'terrorist', 'cells', 'commandeered', 'four', 'commercial', 'airplanes', 'aimed', 'iconic', 'symbols', 'American', 'Democracy', 'Capitalism', 'Three', 'planes', 'found', 'targets', 'United', '93', 'story', 'fourth.The', 'film', 'entire', 'morning', 'September', '11', 'closest', 'thing', 'lead', 'being', 'FAA', 'Director', 'Operations', 'Ben', 'Sliney', 'portrays', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'neophyte', 'actor', 'Several', 'other', 'officials', 'military', 'personal', 're-create', 'roles', 'faithful', 'day.Selecting', 'number', 'people', 'play', 'was', 'first', 'step', 'writer/director', 'Peter', 'Greengrass', 'made', 'present', 'events', 'film', 'truly', 'happened', 'Greengrass', 'drama', 'build', 'steering', 'clear', 'manufactured', 'moments', 'melodrama', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'doomed', 'aircraft.The', 'film', 'also', 'use', 'hindsight', 'determining', 'emphasize', 'total', 'ambivalence', 'cultural', 'impact', 'people/events', 'special', 'significance', 'given', 'Beamer', 'let', 'roll', 'direction', 'became', 'rallying', 'cry', 'America', 'reference', 'made', 'group', 'being', 'lead', 'hulkish', 'homosexual', 'who', 'helped', 'redefine', 'image', 'effeminate', 'gays', 'pre-Brokeback', 'world', 'Even', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'important', 'stories', 'come', 'Flight', '93', 'nobody', 'flight', 'day', 'knew', 'so', 'film', 'doesn', 't', 'revise', 'reality', 'acknowledge', 'them.The', 'brilliance', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'comparing', 'film', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'instead', 'lesser', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'playing', 'Mark', 'Bingham', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'playing', 'Todd', 'Beamer', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'characters', 'capture', 'focus', 'audience', 'build', 'cliched', 'subplots', 'lifelong', 'struggles', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'final', 'rush', 'glory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'moment', 'catharsis', 'were', 'able', 'overcome', 'fault', 'haunted', 'years.Thankfully', 'United', '93', 'not', 'film', 'unflinching', 'unromanticized', 'account', 'events', '9/11', 'Free', 'conspiracy', 'speculation', 'total', 'disdain', 'enemies', 'are', 'confused', 'naive', 'men', 'not', 'mustache', 'twirling', 'villains', 'film', 'little', 'politics/values', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fans', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'aim', 'directly', 'government', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'blaming', 'America', 'claiming', 'created', 'world', 'where', '9/11', 'was', 'inevitable.People', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'different', 'ideas', 'how', 'morning', 'unfolded', 'will', 'unfairly', 'say', 'FAA', 'NORAD', 'military', 'were', 'too', 'slow', 'reacting', 'initial', 'hijackings', 'believe', 'showing', 'events', 'real', 'time', 'audiences', 'see', 'how', 'fast', 'everything', 'unfolded', 'giving', 'little', 'chance', 'preventing', 'terrorists', 'carrying', 'out', 'first', 'three', 'missions', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'last', 'were', 'people', 'United', '93', 'worst', 'day', 'America', 'history', 'one', 'group', 'normal', 'citizens', 'banded', 'together', 'show', 'resolve', 'bravery', 'move', 'grateful', 'nation', 'will', 'forever', 'earn', 'title', 'heroes']",United 93
