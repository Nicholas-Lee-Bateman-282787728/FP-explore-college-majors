His theatrical broadway R & R antics just look wimpy. I still think Alice is probably a pretty cool guy, and I love HEARING his older music (KILLER is still his best album), but this DVD really sucks. It probably deserves 1 star, but I can't bear to give Alice a failing grade, so out of the kindness of my heart, I'll give him 2 stars. Stay away from this DVD.Oh yeah......they promote this DVD as extra shocking and gross........it's not, compared to today's standards.

940506,ANIC0X53E1SFX,B000BCKXT0,"Brian Ferguson ""algermilitia""","[4, 6]","Ok, here's the deal. For the most part, all the reviews written thus far for this DVD are correct. You have to remember, the year was 1973 when this concert was being done. What kind of stage performances were the norm back then, what was the typical stage setup, what was the culture of the country? By today's standards this concert is a cheesey, but fun rock 'n roll show. It's basically a straight foward concert, not a big theatrical production. During the commentary, Alice says that Unfinished Sweet was really the first theatrical performance done during any of their concerts, and it wasn't that big of a deal. The bottom line is, this concert shows you where the band actually came from. Even though Babies was their 6th album, it was their mainstream breakthrough album. In 1973 they spent 1.4 million putting this show on, and made 4.3 million off of it. This was back in the day when a ticket was only a few dollars. The footage was the typical music video styling for the era, meaning that the camera men really didn't know how to capture the performance of a concert. They had a lot of close ups on Alice's face, not much of the rest of the band, and a lot of zooming in and out. This was actually quite annoying, because there was a lot more going on in the show than just the armpit hair growing out of Alice's arm. And when Alice wasn't really doing anything, the camera men kept shooting him, even though his back was turned and he was drinking cola. This, in my opinion, was amaturish camera work. The sound remix was decent. It was actually better than the mix used on the Billion Dollar Babies SE album, which included the live concert music taken from this tour. The concert itself was dark. There wasn't a lot of lighting used since their lighting idea was more like a vegas light show rather than a bunch of gel colored projections. Because of the camera work and the few spotlights that were shown down upon Alice, this kind of made things boring from time to time, because the lights that were set up weren't used very often. It also made the rest of the band hard to see. Anyone that knows anything knows that lighting helps set the mood and sell the image. Again, 1973... typical stage performances weren't all the detailed. The video skits were quite enjoyable in my opinion, but I knew first hand, and expected them to be cheesey, which they were, so I wasn't dissappointed in them. I actually found them humorous in a subtle manner. Overall, it's a fun concert. Would have been great to have been there. But still, the best Alice concert DVD to date, by far, is the Brutally Live DVD. It's not the theatrical Welcome to my Nightmare style of a show, but there are some theatrics. What puts that DVD over the top is the outstanding musicianship, excellent sound, and by this time the camera crew and lighting, and director actually knew what they were doing.",4,"Rated PG, for Positively Gross!",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2889,"['Ok', 'here', 'deal', 'most', 'part', 'reviews', 'written', 'thus', 'far', 'DVD', 'are', 'correct', 'have', 'remember', 'year', 'was', '1973', 'when', 'concert', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'What', 'kind', 'stage', 'performances', 'were', 'norm', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'typical', 'stage', 'setup', 'what', 'was', 'culture', 'country', 'today', 'standards', 'concert', 'cheesey', 'fun', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'show', 'basically', 'straight', 'foward', 'concert', 'not', 'big', 'theatrical', 'production', 'commentary', 'Alice', 'Unfinished', 'Sweet', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'done', 'concerts', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'bottom', 'line', 'concert', 'where', 'band', 'actually', 'came', 'Even', 'Babies', 'was', '6th', 'album', 'was', 'mainstream', 'breakthrough', 'album', '1973', 'spent', '1.4', 'million', 'putting', 'show', 'made', '4.3', 'million', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'ticket', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'dollars', 'footage', 'was', 'typical', 'music', 'video', 'styling', 'era', 'meaning', 'camera', 'men', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'capture', 'performance', 'concert', 'had', 'lot', 'close', 'ups', 'Alice', 'face', 'not', 'much', 'rest', 'band', 'lot', 'zooming', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'annoying', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'show', 'just', 'armpit', 'hair', 'growing', 'Alice', 'arm', 'when', 'Alice', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'anything', 'camera', 'men', 'kept', 'shooting', 'even', 'back', 'was', 'turned', 'was', 'drinking', 'cola', 'opinion', 'was', 'amaturish', 'camera', 'work', 'sound', 'remix', 'was', 'decent', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'mix', 'used', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'SE', 'album', 'included', 'live', 'concert', 'music', 'taken', 'tour', 'concert', 'was', 'dark', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'lighting', 'used', 'lighting', 'idea', 'was', 'more', 'vegas', 'light', 'show', 'rather', 'bunch', 'gel', 'colored', 'projections', 'camera', 'work', 'few', 'spotlights', 'were', 'shown', 'down', 'upon', 'Alice', 'kind', 'made', 'things', 'boring', 'time', 'time', 'lights', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'used', 'very', 'often', 'also', 'made', 'rest', 'band', 'hard', 'see', 'Anyone', 'anything', 'lighting', 'set', 'mood', 'sell', 'image', 'Again', '1973', 'typical', 'stage', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'detailed', 'video', 'skits', 'were', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'opinion', 'knew', 'first', 'hand', 'expected', 'be', 'cheesey', 'were', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissappointed', 'actually', 'found', 'humorous', 'subtle', 'manner', 'Overall', 'fun', 'concert', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'still', 'best', 'Alice', 'concert', 'DVD', 'date', 'far', 'Brutally', 'Live', 'DVD', 'not', 'theatrical', 'Welcome', 'Nightmare', 'style', 'show', 'are', 'theatrics', 'What', 'DVD', 'top', 'outstanding', 'musicianship', 'excellent', 'sound', 'time', 'camera', 'crew', 'lighting', 'director', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing']",N/A

But I had to bite on this one. If you are a fan of the old Cooper band (the only one that matters), then this is pretty exciting to watch, as it is the only footage I know of from that era, at least professionally filmed. For anybody, like me, who did witness the bizarre spectacle of the early tours, this is a nice reminder, since it's all there - the mannequins, the stabbed baby dolls, the snake, the guillotine. And while only about an hour in length (if you choose the ""view concert only"" option), the band does cover a lot of great tunes from the early repertoire. Secondly, the sound is superb, so even as a live album, this is worth it. But to see a young and snarling Alice Cooper in his prime - well, it made me remember exactly why parents and clergy the world over considered this guy the second coming of Satan - and we all loved it!!

I was familiar with the radio hits and a friend had the ""Greatest Hits"" album but I really knew nothing of the Alice Cooper Group other than stories revealed years later.  I heard about this dvd and asked for it as a Christmas present and finally got around to watching it last night.  This concert or movie is over 30 years old. Please keep that in mind.  If you are looking for something that has been recorded in the last decade, you will not find it here.  This is just a piece of history of a band that was firing on all cylinders, definitely in their prime.  I needed to see the guillotine scene to fully understand what made this band such a monster live act.  The movie is hurt by the comedy attempts of a mad director but the bright side is you can choose to watch only the concert and that is why this is here.  The sound may not be state of the art but how could one expect that from something so old and a different technology back then.  Open up your minds and eyes and see what Alice Cooper the band was really about.  I wasn't familiar with all the songs but ""Elected"", ""Under My Wheels"". ""18"", and ""Billion Dollar Babies "" are here and that is enough for me.  I hate ""Easter Eggs"" on dvds.  Why should I have to search for the secret to access a bonus feature.

940518,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000BCKXT0,Kasey G,"[3, 3]","Let's start with the ugly: The ""story"" that wraps around the concert sequences is beyond lame, populated with actors who make the denizens of early John Waters' films look Oscar-worthy.We begin with the boys of the Alice Cooper group trashing and storming off a movie set where they were forced to wear ridiculous powder wigs and sing showtunes. This causes the tempermental and vengeful European director and his giant Nordic assistant to try and hunt down ""The Cooper Gang"". The only redeemable moment in this mess is when the boys escape via elephant (don't ask) Monkees-style in fast-motion while ""Halo of Flies"" plays in the background.Now, the bad: While it's great that Shout! Factory put this out and probably did their best with the source elements, there is plenty of dirt, debris and blemishes on the print. Those expecting Hi-Def remastering and pristine picture and sound quality will be sorely disappointed.Which brings us to the good: At least by accessing the Special Features, you can choose the ""Play Concert Only"" option and spare yourself the pain of the ""comedy"" segments.The concert itself, the 1973 Billion Dollar Babies Tour, is fantastic and must-see viewing for fans of the Alice Cooper Group. Alice sports a pair of thigh-high leopard print boots over a tattered leotard while the band look sharp in white sequined suits. There is never a dull moment as Alice frolics and molests various dismembered female mannequin bodyparts; is chased by a crazed dentist, then himself chases a dancing molar with a giant toothbrush; threatens a cocky audience member; pins a giant insect to his crotch; picks out female audience members to kiss while avoiding the jailbait; and is decapitated by a guillotine.The majority of the set list is understandably culled from ""Billion Dollar Babies"", though we are treated to ""Eighteen"", ""Under My Wheels"" and an abbreviated ""Dead Babies"". ""My Stars"" comes off much better here than on the ""School's Out"" album and is accompanied by an elaborate (for 1973) light show.My favorite moments include the ""Raped and Freezin'/No More Mr. Nice Guy"" medley, which begins with Alice, Michael, Glen and Dennis all standing shoulder-to-shoulder rocking out--something we usually never got to see as the band always had their usual positions--while Neal works his magic from a specially-built drum kit platform; and ""Sick Things"" which Alice performs while Kuchina the snake wraps herself around him (he actually needs to be ""rescued"" when the reptile obscures his face and he can't project into the mic). It ends when Alice raises the American flag and the band pummel a Richard Nixon lookalike and carry him offstage before they take their well-deserved final bows.Despite the problems of this DVD, any fan of the Alice Coooper group needs to see this. I only wish we had such a great video document of the ""Killer"" tour as the ""Love It to Death/Killer"" era with Alice in the spider makeup is my favorite and when I believe the boys were at their most creative.",5,"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly",1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,3007,"['Let', 'start', 'ugly', 'story', 'wraps', 'concert', 'sequences', 'lame', 'populated', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'denizens', 'early', 'John', 'Waters', 'films', 'look', 'Oscar-worthy.We', 'begin', 'boys', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'group', 'trashing', 'storming', 'off', 'movie', 'set', 'where', 'were', 'forced', 'wear', 'ridiculous', 'powder', 'wigs', 'sing', 'showtunes', 'tempermental', 'vengeful', 'European', 'director', 'giant', 'Nordic', 'assistant', 'try', 'hunt', 'down', 'Cooper', 'Gang', 'only', 'redeemable', 'moment', 'mess', 'when', 'boys', 'escape', 'elephant', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Monkees-style', 'fast-motion', 'Halo', 'Flies', 'plays', 'background.Now', 'bad', 'great', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'put', 'out', 'probably', 'did', 'best', 'source', 'elements', 'plenty', 'dirt', 'debris', 'blemishes', 'print', 'expecting', 'Hi-Def', 'remastering', 'pristine', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed.Which', 'good', 'least', 'accessing', 'Special', 'Features', 'can', 'choose', 'Play', 'Concert', 'Only', 'option', 'spare', 'pain', 'comedy', 'segments.The', 'concert', '1973', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'Tour', 'fantastic', 'must-see', 'viewing', 'fans', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Group', 'Alice', 'sports', 'pair', 'thigh-high', 'leopard', 'print', 'boots', 'tattered', 'leotard', 'band', 'look', 'sharp', 'white', 'sequined', 'suits', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'Alice', 'frolics', 'molests', 'various', 'dismembered', 'female', 'mannequin', 'bodyparts', 'chased', 'crazed', 'dentist', 'then', 'dancing', 'molar', 'giant', 'toothbrush', 'cocky', 'audience', 'member', 'giant', 'insect', 'crotch', 'out', 'female', 'audience', 'members', 'kiss', 'avoiding', 'jailbait', 'decapitated', 'guillotine.The', 'majority', 'set', 'list', 'understandably', 'culled', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'are', 'treated', 'Eighteen', 'My', 'Wheels', 'abbreviated', 'Dead', 'Babies', 'Stars', 'off', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'School', 'Out', 'album', 'accompanied', 'elaborate', '1973', 'light', 'show.My', 'favorite', 'moments', 'include', 'Raped', ""Freezin'/No"", 'More', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'medley', 'Alice', 'Michael', 'Glen', 'Dennis', 'standing', 'shoulder-to-shoulder', 'rocking', 'out', 'something', 'usually', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'band', 'always', 'had', 'usual', 'positions', 'Neal', 'magic', 'specially-built', 'drum', 'kit', 'platform', 'Sick', 'Things', 'Alice', 'performs', 'Kuchina', 'snake', 'actually', 'be', 'rescued', 'when', 'reptile', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'project', 'mic', 'when', 'Alice', 'American', 'flag', 'band', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'lookalike', 'carry', 'offstage', 'take', 'well-deserved', 'final', 'bows.Despite', 'problems', 'DVD', 'fan', 'Alice', 'Coooper', 'group', 'see', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'video', 'document', 'Killer', 'tour', 'Love', 'Death/Killer', 'era', 'Alice', 'spider', 'makeup', 'favorite', 'when', 'believe', 'boys', 'were', 'most', 'creative']",N/A
940519,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BCKXT0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","First, unless you were hoping that Alice Cooper would make a movie that would complete some sort of strange trilogy with ""Help!"" by the Beatles and ""Head"" by the Monkees, my best advice with this DVD is to go directly to the Special Features and find where it says just to play the concert.  That is because except for the opening where Alice and the band dress up in white and do ""The Lady is a Tramp"" on a soundstage, the comedic interludes are simply wretched.  The best that can be said for them is that they would suffice as bathroom breaks or opportunities to raid the refrigeration and switch the laundry from the washer to the dryer.  But provide entertainment value they do not (there is some lame excuse about the director being upset when the band destroys his set after performing the aforementioned music number, but it hardly justifies the pitiful scenes that follow).The ""Billion Dollar Babies"" Tour of 1973 was when Alice Cooper was at the top of the mountain, and the chief value of ""Good to See You Again, Alice Cooper"" is that it documents the stage show with the big snake, the guillotine, and the rest of the props that threatened to make the music incidental to the experience.  Filmed deep in the heart of Texas at Dallas and Houston, on April 28 and 29 respectively, this concert film reminds us that there was more to Alice Cooper that the shock theater aspects.  Before Jim Steinman started writing operatic rock songs for Meatloaf and providing the paradigmatic examples of these particular art form, it was Alice Cooper on ""Billion Dollar Babies"" that were claiming that particular patch of musical territory, as amply demonstrated by ""Elected,"" ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" and ""Hello, Hooray.""  Those actually end up being the first three songs in the concert, and then the band goes back to their first hit, ""I'm Eighteen,"" which proves they had been working towards their goal for some time (to wit, ever since Bob Ezrin became their producer).  In terms of other quantifiable hits, ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" pop up in the middle, and then ""School's Out"" and ""Under My Wheels"" are saved for the big finish.  To make sure parents are suitably offended, ""Raped and Freezin',"" ""Sick Things,"" ""Dead Babies"" and ""I Love the Dead"" are thrown into the mix.What I remember about Alice Cooper is that I liked the music, especially when turned up loud, and that I did not really care about the lyrics.  After all, you can make an argument that ""Dead Babies"" is a sort of public service announcement, but when you watch ""Good to See You Again"" there should be moments when you think Cooper is at least trying to go too far, even if you think he never gets there (be fair when you do this, and think in terms of what things were like in the 1970s and not judge Alice Cooper by their progeny, from Kiss to Marilyn Manson and beyond).  At this point in the history of the known universe watching them chop off  the head of Alice Cooper and displaying it to the crowd was as the pinnacle of rock `n' roll stagecraft.  Ultimately, the tacky comedy segments of the movie are counter-balanced by the DVD extras, which include a commentary track by Alice himself, a deleted scene, some original graphics, and a radio spot for the film to go along with the trailer.",4,"Remembering Alice Cooper on stage during the glory days of the ""Billion Dollar Babies"" Tour",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,3270,"['First', 'were', 'hoping', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'complete', 'sort', 'strange', 'trilogy', 'Help', 'Beatles', 'Head', 'Monkees', 'best', 'advice', 'DVD', 'go', 'directly', 'Special', 'Features', 'find', 'where', 'just', 'play', 'concert', 'because', 'opening', 'where', 'Alice', 'band', 'dress', 'up', 'white', 'do', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'soundstage', 'comedic', 'interludes', 'are', 'simply', 'wretched', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'would', 'suffice', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'opportunities', 'raid', 'refrigeration', 'switch', 'laundry', 'washer', 'dryer', 'provide', 'entertainment', 'value', 'do', 'not', 'lame', 'excuse', 'director', 'being', 'upset', 'when', 'band', 'set', 'performing', 'aforementioned', 'music', 'number', 'hardly', 'pitiful', 'scenes', 'follow', '.The', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'Tour', '1973', 'was', 'when', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'was', 'top', 'mountain', 'chief', 'value', 'Good', 'See', 'Again', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'documents', 'stage', 'show', 'big', 'snake', 'guillotine', 'rest', 'props', 'threatened', 'make', 'music', 'incidental', 'experience', 'Filmed', 'deep', 'heart', 'Texas', 'Dallas', 'Houston', 'April', '28', '29', 'respectively', 'concert', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'shock', 'theater', 'aspects', 'Jim', 'Steinman', 'started', 'writing', 'operatic', 'rock', 'songs', 'Meatloaf', 'providing', 'paradigmatic', 'examples', 'particular', 'art', 'form', 'was', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'were', 'claiming', 'particular', 'patch', 'musical', 'territory', 'amply', 'demonstrated', 'Elected', 'Billion', 'Dollar', 'Babies', 'Hello', 'Hooray', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'first', 'three', 'songs', 'concert', 'then', 'band', 'back', 'first', 'hit', ""'m"", 'Eighteen', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'towards', 'goal', 'time', 'wit', 'ever', 'Bob', 'Ezrin', 'became', 'producer', 'terms', 'other', 'quantifiable', 'hits', 'No', 'More', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'pop', 'up', 'middle', 'then', 'School', 'Out', 'My', 'Wheels', 'are', 'saved', 'big', 'finish', 'make', 'sure', 'parents', 'are', 'suitably', 'offended', 'Raped', 'Freezin', 'Sick', 'Things', 'Dead', 'Babies', 'Love', 'Dead', 'are', 'thrown', 'mix.What', 'remember', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'liked', 'music', 'especially', 'when', 'turned', 'up', 'loud', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'lyrics', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'Dead', 'Babies', 'sort', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'when', 'watch', 'Good', 'See', 'Again', 'should', 'be', 'moments', 'when', 'think', 'Cooper', 'least', 'trying', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'even', 'think', 'never', 'be', 'fair', 'when', 'do', 'think', 'terms', 'what', 'things', 'were', '1970s', 'not', 'judge', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'progeny', 'Kiss', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'point', 'history', 'known', 'universe', 'watching', 'chop', 'off', 'head', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'displaying', 'crowd', 'was', 'pinnacle', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'stagecraft', 'Ultimately', 'tacky', 'comedy', 'segments', 'movie', 'are', 'counter-balanced', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Alice', 'deleted', 'scene', 'original', 'graphics', 'radio', 'spot', 'film', 'go', 'along', 'trailer']",N/A

They waited so long to release this that I've kind of gotten use to the more recent videos of Alice which are far more polished and professional.This is enjoyable in an historic light but the truth is the band sounds sloppy at times and as far as theatrics go it was fun then but today it seems a bit dated. I would recommend that newer fans go with Live At Montreaux dvd or something after Alice's rehab. This is certainly enjoyable in a novel sort of way. This is from what Alice calls his ""alcoholic period"".Alice appears to forget the words to ""Raped and Freezin"" and the band seems unaware of which one one is supposed to playing lead or rhythm. The background vocals during ""Under My Wheels"" are horribly off, and that entire thing about Fred Smoot and the guy on the bicycle is really annoying. This is apparently at the height of the controversy and it's clear that they were riding high on the wave of their notoriety while they ccould, so the theatrics are emphasized here and not musianship.

This is basic photography 101. When you blow up film like that, the film gets darker.Moulty is right about a lot of things. B$B is clipped. Shout Factory apparently didn't get all the footage or didn't use it. So I guess I'll still have to keep my bootleg DVD when I want to see the complete B$B song.I agree that the filming techniques were poor. Black Oak Arkansas has a DVD out with footage filmed at Royal Albert Hall in England in 1974. That film is excellent, they actually zoom in on the guitarist when they're soloing.I thought Shout Factory would have had the whole concert on film but apparently all they did was edit the skit version so it is not seamless at all.In the actual performance, after Unfinished Suite, stobe lights flashed while ""Night on Bald Mountain"" was piped through the PA and a bunch roadies came on stage with wheel barrows full of body parts. They would beat each other with the body parts during the stobe light show and then left. Alice then began Sick Things. This is not seen on this film.I'm still glad this came out although the band is still conspicuous by their absence, yet again. They were not interviewed which might have been interesting.The Alice commentary is quite good though.",4,Finally!,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1508,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'cover', 'new', 'ground', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'addressed', 'reviews', 'real', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'dark', 'according', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'Alice', 'personal', 'assistant', 'film', 'crew', 'filmed', 'show', '16mm', 'cameras', 'then', 'blew', 'film', 'up', '35mm', 'theatrical', 'release', 'basic', 'photography', '101', 'When', 'blow', 'up', 'film', 'film', 'darker.Moulty', 'right', 'lot', 'things', 'B', 'B', 'clipped', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'So', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'keep', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'when', 'want', 'see', 'complete', 'B', 'B', 'song.I', 'agree', 'filming', 'techniques', 'were', 'poor', 'Black', 'Oak', 'Arkansas', 'DVD', 'out', 'footage', 'filmed', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'England', '1974', 'film', 'excellent', 'actually', 'zoom', 'guitarist', 'when', ""'re"", 'soloing.I', 'thought', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'whole', 'concert', 'film', 'apparently', 'did', 'was', 'edit', 'skit', 'version', 'not', 'seamless', 'actual', 'performance', 'Unfinished', 'Suite', 'stobe', 'lights', 'flashed', 'Night', 'Bald', 'Mountain', 'was', 'piped', 'PA', 'bunch', 'roadies', 'came', 'stage', 'wheel', 'barrows', 'full', 'body', 'parts', 'would', 'beat', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'stobe', 'light', 'show', 'then', 'left', 'Alice', 'then', 'began', 'Sick', 'Things', 'not', 'seen', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'came', 'out', 'band', 'still', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'yet', 'again', 'were', 'not', 'interviewed', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting.The', 'Alice', 'commentary', 'quite', 'good', 'though']",N/A

I remember umpteen years ago, I think I paid big buck$ for a so-so quality VHS video tape copy of 'Good To See...'. I was one of those true Cooper fans that simply couldn't wait ANY longer to land down a copy of this movie. Saw it in a theater when it first came out in summer, 1974. Highly appreciate this DVD's 'Watch Concert Only' option, although those old B&W snippets of vintage movies are fun to check out WHEN you have time. Tracks that this fan will have edged in the back of his mind for a long time to come are ""Hello Hooray"", ""Billion Dollar Babies"", ""Elected"", the exclusive (hadn't been played out on tour since) ""My Stars"", ""Dead Babies"", ""I Love The Dead"" and ""School's Out"". Also sort of dug the DVD's opening scene where Alice and band mock the torch song ""Lady Is A Tramp"". Thirty-three years ago, when this tour took place, the entertainment world was in fact shocked by the show's antics of a scroungy-looking rock star sticking a baby doll at the tip of a sword, humping a store mannequin, necrophilia and a beheading. This WAS excitement (and still is) for those who seek it. The extras are nice to have as well. It's amazing to think JUST how much the world has changed since the notorious 'Billion Dollar Babies' trek had infested the American youth. Prime Shock Rock here just waiting to be fully experienced.

Dean,"[4, 5]","As a Alice Cooper fan since the early '70s, I must admit that the Billion Dollar Babies show that made it onto this DVD is fantastic and totally compelling.To me, the ride these guys were on in the years from 1969 to 1974  was really special. They were entirely different from everyone else, churning out garage-rock anthems on a couple of albums per year, and bringing it home as one of the world's biggest concert draws. So why is it that their stage performances remain on shelves somewhere? I don't care about the quality of it - it's historic!!The story-line aspect is fine (for a 1973 spoof), but I'm not likely to watch it again... it's too corny and dated. If they had added (maybe on a second disc) another show or partial shows, that would have been more enjoyable, since there are times (especially during Alice's shock-rock/performance-art moments in the show) that the band's playing becomes quite cacaphonic..

There could have been no better time for Alice Cooper to appear than in the early 70s. I was just a child at the time, standing around shadowy corners of the schoolyard where second hand stories of Alice's gory live act were whispered and traded like gruesome little folklore tales. Our parents tried to protect us, but we would spend amazing amounts of effort sneaking albums and 8-track tapes of Alice around, secretly listening to the forbidden musical gems.  Anybody who saw the band live at this time must have sensed that they were witness to a historical moment in time... a moment that represented American pop-culture's bogus innocence being deflowered. These lovely blood spattered memories are now ours to cherish forever with the DVD release of ""Good to See You Again Alice Cooper"", available for the first time ever on home video.Two nights of Alice Cooper's notorious 1973 Billion Dollar Babies tour (April 28th in Dallas and April 29th in Houston) were filmed to create this rare 1974 midnight matinee film, and it's a great testament to the riotous live act that made the Alice Cooper Group a threat to concerned parents everywhere. This DVD contains the original cut of the film which includes the band starring in charming little skits scattered amongst the astonishing live footage (The more common version of the film shown in theaters included old film and newsreel footage instead of the skits). A highly amusing moment among these skits features the band playing ""The Lady Is a Tramp"". Shout! Factory lovingly provides this release with a new high-definition film transfer along with a new Surround Sound mix created from the 16-track master tapes.What uncomfortable items will Alice shove down his pants? What celebrity will be pummeled to a pulp by the band? Will the snake get out of control? Where will all the blood and spittle drip to?  Will security be able to hold Alice back from attacking and brawling with audience members? Will Alice lose his head?

I thought that I'd buy a live performance from this hard rock icon of my teenage years that I (according to my parents) was too young to actually go see during the 70s, and I was sure that I was buying the awesome, spectacular rock show that I was forbidden by my parents to go see when I was in Jr. high. Ultimately the performace in this DVD was pretty corny by today's standards.I actually found myself skipping though a lot of the songs that I thought that I'd be captivated by. Overall, a mediocre performance at best with much less than dazzling theatrics.Then after my first viewing I watched it with Alice's audio commentary turned on. And let me tell you...that watching it with the commentary on is absolutely the way this release was intended to be watched and should be watched. That is the caveat that I mentioned earlier....BE SURE THAT YOU WATCH THIS WITH ALICE'S COMMENTARY ON.If you were an Alice fan (like me) back in the day and you are over 40 (like me), and you really want to enjoy this show, watch it with the audio commentary ON. I'm sure (based on Alice's own commentary!) that Alice would recommend that you do the same.If my expectations for a great theatrical DVD were a let-down, I can say that being able to watch ""with Alice"" certainly exceeded my expectations.So if you were into Alice back in the day, be sure to watch this with Alice's commentary turned ON during your viewing. (Did I mention that?) It brought my experience to a much higher level.If you are a youngster checking out what your Daddy used to think was cool...perhaps you should watch the DVD first without the commentary (but doing this will only support your current belief that your Dad is a freak), but ultimately be sure to watch it again with the commentary on; it will really give you a better perspective of what was going on in the mind of what at the time was a very unique artist.Buy it.",4,Go Ask Alice,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2031,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'back', '70s', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'caveat', '.Funny', 'thought', ""'d"", 'buy', 'live', 'performance', 'hard', 'rock', 'icon', 'teenage', 'years', 'according', 'parents', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'actually', 'go', 'see', '70s', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'buying', 'awesome', 'spectacular', 'rock', 'show', 'was', 'forbidden', 'parents', 'go', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'Jr.', 'high', 'Ultimately', 'performace', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'corny', 'today', 'standards.I', 'actually', 'found', 'skipping', 'lot', 'songs', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'captivated', 'Overall', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'best', 'much', 'less', 'dazzling', 'theatrics.Then', 'first', 'viewing', 'watched', 'Alice', 'audio', 'commentary', 'turned', 'let', 'tell', 'watching', 'commentary', 'absolutely', 'way', 'release', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'watched', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'caveat', 'mentioned', 'earlier', '.BE', 'SURE', 'THAT', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'WITH', 'ALICE', 'COMMENTARY', 'ON.If', 'were', 'Alice', 'fan', 'back', 'day', 'are', '40', 'really', 'want', 'enjoy', 'show', 'watch', 'audio', 'commentary', 'ON', ""'m"", 'sure', 'based', 'Alice', 'own', 'commentary', 'Alice', 'would', 'recommend', 'do', 'same.If', 'expectations', 'great', 'theatrical', 'DVD', 'were', 'let-down', 'can', 'say', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'Alice', 'certainly', 'exceeded', 'expectations.So', 'were', 'Alice', 'back', 'day', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Alice', 'commentary', 'turned', 'ON', 'viewing', 'Did', 'mention', 'brought', 'experience', 'much', 'higher', 'level.If', 'are', 'youngster', 'checking', 'out', 'what', 'Daddy', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'cool', 'perhaps', 'should', 'watch', 'DVD', 'first', 'commentary', 'doing', 'will', 'only', 'support', 'current', 'belief', 'Dad', 'freak', 'ultimately', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'again', 'commentary', 'will', 'really', 'give', 'better', 'perspective', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'mind', 'what', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'artist.Buy']",N/A
