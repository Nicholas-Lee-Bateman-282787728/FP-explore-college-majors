Today a show like this would certainly be considered corny and sappy but I found it WONDERFUL. Uncle Bill (Brian Keith) was the kind of uncle or dad everyone wished they had. The children were believable and you wanted to eat them up.Mr French (S. Cabot) was FANTASTIC in the part of a gentleman's gentleman. There were moments when he provided some great comic relief. The one thing I remember the most about this show is that in each episode it ALWAYS TAUGHT A VALUBLE LESSON!The only other show that has really come close to this show was Little House On The Prairie.,5,WHOLESOME & Full Of HEART,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,675,"['have', 'very', 'vivid', 'memmories', 'Family', 'Affair', 'young', 'child.Shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'quite', 'anymore', 'Today', 'show', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'considered', 'corny', 'sappy', 'found', 'WONDERFUL', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'was', 'kind', 'uncle', 'dad', 'everyone', 'wished', 'had', 'children', 'were', 'believable', 'wanted', 'eat', 'up.Mr', 'French', 'S.', 'Cabot', 'was', 'FANTASTIC', 'part', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'provided', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'one', 'thing', 'remember', 'most', 'show', 'episode', 'ALWAYS', 'TAUGHT', 'A', 'VALUBLE', 'LESSON', 'only', 'other', 'show', 'really', 'come', 'close', 'show', 'was', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie']",Family Affair: Season 1

You aren't looking under the bed to find dirty magazines but maybe one of Jody's toys. Instead of taking the children out for their first cell phone or computer during this first season, they end up with a horse and a lamb.  The pilot episode is one that will melt the heart of any kind person.  Macho or not, keep the Kleenex nearby.  The extras are very well done and Kathy Garver's behind the scenes contribution is very interesting.  According to her website, the extras have been filmed for season two and we can expect a November release. I can't wait. I hope that all five seasons will be released and that Johnny Whitaker will participate in some of the extras.One interesting note by Kathy was that Sebastian Cabot had to temporarily leave the show for health reasons during the first season and John Williams stepped in to play Mr. French's brother Nigel.  John Williams is well known for playing the detective in Alfred Hitchock's thriller, Dial ""M' for Murder.  Thank goodness Sebastian was able to return before the end of the first season and go on to do the other four seasons as the very lovable Giles French.",5,This is One Affair Not to Miss,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1259,"['are', 'as', 'tired', 'am', 'processed', 'shows', 'one', 'will', 'gladly', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'family', 'shows', 'were', 'just', 'that', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'bed', 'find', 'dirty', 'magazines', 'maybe', 'one', 'Jody', 'toys', 'Instead', 'taking', 'children', 'out', 'first', 'cell', 'phone', 'computer', 'first', 'season', 'end', 'up', 'horse', 'lamb', 'pilot', 'episode', 'one', 'will', 'melt', 'heart', 'kind', 'person', 'Macho', 'not', 'keep', 'Kleenex', 'nearby', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Kathy', 'Garver', 'scenes', 'contribution', 'very', 'interesting', 'According', 'website', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'season', 'two', 'can', 'expect', 'November', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hope', 'five', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Johnny', 'Whitaker', 'will', 'participate', 'extras.One', 'interesting', 'note', 'Kathy', 'was', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'had', 'temporarily', 'leave', 'show', 'health', 'reasons', 'first', 'season', 'John', 'Williams', 'stepped', 'play', 'Mr.', 'French', 'brother', 'Nigel', 'John', 'Williams', 'well', 'known', 'playing', 'detective', 'Alfred', 'Hitchock', 'thriller', 'Dial', 'M', 'Murder', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Sebastian', 'was', 'able', 'return', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'go', 'do', 'other', 'four', 'seasons', 'very', 'lovable', 'Giles', 'French']",Family Affair: Season 1

Even the part played by John Williams as the other Mr. French while Sebastian Cabot was out sick is a true winner.  The colors are very vibrant and truly a show for the whole family.  Brian Keith was great as Uncle Bill, a man that took on the responsibility of taking of his brothers 3 orphaned children.  And of course not by choice, they were for lack of better wording abandoned at this front door.  This series is truly heart warming & funny at just the right moments.  Season one offers a behind the scenes interview with Cathy Garver (Cissy).  She sheds some light on how the cast was chosen.Even if you were not a fan of the show it is worth owning.

980581,A17V5NNFG7QGKS,B000EXZFS0,Eve Galewitz,"[2, 2]","Before the Brady Bunch and the Partridge Family entranced America with a family of precocious youngsters with disarmingly attractive parents and the odd character thrown into the mix, there was Family Affair.Despite the unrealistic premise (which has ""Uncle Bill"" (Brian Keith) the bachelor brother living in a swank penthouse high above NYC's Central Park, inheriting Buffy and Jody, the two most adorable little children in the world, along with their lovely teenage sister, Kathy, on the death of their parents), contrived plots and morality laden dialogue in each episode, this show remains a favorite among many cynical folks like myself.  Why?  Because in essence it taught that love makes a family, and not all families are the same.  What a concept for the 1960's (and today).Why a modern-day middle class American bachelor would require a ""butler/cook/manservant"" (played to perfection by Sebastian Cabot), defies reality.  Although , having this odd character about allows the children to have their most precious dialogue with the often perplexed Mr. French, who finds himself Nanny/Governess to Buffy and Jody.  Mr. French is likely to be admitted to the Television Hall of Fame (if it exists) as one of the most beloved characters on television.And who could ever forget Buffy's doll, a bespectacled granny in a polka dot dress, who she referred to as ""Mrs. Beezley"".  This little doll became a retail bonanza when other little girls all over the country had to have a ""Mrs. Beezley"" just like Buffy.Last but not least, was there ever a cuter child actor than Johnny Whittaker (""Jody"")?  Not in my opinion.  This little boy could act from the time he was a toddler and remained a favorite of television producers throughout his teens.  He was featured in many hits like:  ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", ""The Littlest Angel"" and had the title role in ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"".  The best quality about Johnny is that he never appeared precocious, but embodied everything wonderful about childhood:  innocence, curiosity, and with a hint of naughtiness.",5,Perhaps one of the sweetest tv shows ever made!,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,2090,"['Brady', 'Bunch', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'entranced', 'America', 'family', 'precocious', 'youngsters', 'disarmingly', 'attractive', 'parents', 'odd', 'character', 'thrown', 'mix', 'was', 'Family', 'Affair.Despite', 'unrealistic', 'premise', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'bachelor', 'brother', 'living', 'swank', 'penthouse', 'high', 'NYC', 'Central', 'Park', 'inheriting', 'Buffy', 'Jody', 'two', 'most', 'adorable', 'little', 'children', 'world', 'lovely', 'teenage', 'sister', 'Kathy', 'death', 'parents', 'contrived', 'plots', 'morality', 'laden', 'dialogue', 'episode', 'show', 'favorite', 'many', 'cynical', 'folks', 'Why', 'essence', 'taught', 'love', 'family', 'not', 'families', 'are', 'same', 'What', 'concept', '1960', 'today', 'modern-day', 'middle', 'class', 'American', 'bachelor', 'would', 'require', 'butler/cook/manservant', 'played', 'perfection', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'reality', 'having', 'odd', 'character', 'children', 'have', 'most', 'precious', 'dialogue', 'often', 'perplexed', 'Mr.', 'French', 'who', 'Nanny/Governess', 'Buffy', 'Jody', 'Mr.', 'French', 'likely', 'be', 'admitted', 'Television', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'television.And', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'forget', 'Buffy', 'doll', 'bespectacled', 'granny', 'polka', 'dot', 'dress', 'who', 'referred', 'Mrs.', 'Beezley', 'little', 'doll', 'became', 'retail', 'bonanza', 'when', 'other', 'little', 'girls', 'country', 'had', 'have', 'Mrs.', 'Beezley', 'just', 'Buffy.Last', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'there', 'ever', 'cuter', 'child', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Whittaker', 'Jody', 'Not', 'opinion', 'little', 'boy', 'could', 'act', 'time', 'was', 'toddler', 'remained', 'favorite', 'television', 'producers', 'teens', 'was', 'featured', 'many', 'hits', 'Russians', 'are', 'Coming', 'Russians', 'are', 'Coming', 'Littlest', 'Angel', 'had', 'title', 'role', 'Adventures', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'best', 'quality', 'Johnny', 'never', 'appeared', 'precocious', 'embodied', 'everything', 'wonderful', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'curiosity', 'hint', 'naughtiness']",Family Affair: Season 1

We are nearing the end of the first season and let me tell you, I now love this show. It seems kind of eerie though, watching and knowing the fate of Buffy and Uncle Bill. Still, I can't get enough. So endearing and even a bit teary-eyed at times.

Although seen in reruns throughout the early-to-mid '70's, ""Family Affair"" seemed to disappear in the '80's and was seen as passe (the death of Anissa Jones in August 1976 seemed to confirm this was all a flimsy Hollywood fantasy anyway). Still, it's too bad an entire generation missed out on the show, as it is sweet, good-hearted and exceptionally moving. Occasionally, the precociousness of twins Buffy and Jody seems a little put-on, and while the two tykes are terrific little actors, they sometimes were too-aware of the camera (which would disappear by season two). But there are many highlights, such as the Emmy-nominated pilot (a well-written and constructed episode, introducing the characters without going overboard or straining for laughter), Cissy falling for one of her teachers at Lexie High (Robert Reed!), Buffy and Jody getting lost in the Big Apple, and any episode prominently featuring wonderfully cuddly Mr. French (a delightful Sebastian Cabot, whose double-takes over a jar of marmalade are priceless).

Then there was his beyond proper,cultured manservant Mr. French. With his stuffy demeanor, he was in no way prepared to deal with kids in the house. However, they all learned and grew together, and quickly fell in love with one another.Some of the episodes make me tear up now. The kids being afraid they will be separated, and have to leave their new home. Uncle Bill's deep affection for the kids, and the struggle to effectively and properly show it. Mr. French getting caught up in the midst of it all. It's one those shows which more than likely would not work today, due to the overall cynacism of the times.I bought the first season a few years ago, and am delighted it is a part of my ever-growing collection.

Watching this saccharine trifle today, it's difficult to fathom why. Even by the standards of the day, it's so sickeningly sweet, calculatedly heart-warming and grossly unreal it makes The Brady Bunch look like The Osbournes.For an alleged comedy, it's rarely funny but almost always maudlin--in the first season every other episode hinges on one or more of the robotic orphaned kids on the verge of tears because they mistakingly believe they're unwanted by the avuncular ""Unca Bill"" (which the diction-challenged Jody adorably mangles into something sounding like ""Uncwa Bwill"").In one episode, Jody actually comes to the conclusion that he's unloved because, unlike a friend who's constantly being punished, Uncle Bill never beats him. . .so he embarks on a campaign to have Uncle Bill beat him! Mr. French (who not only arranges Uncle Bill's dates but also helps him bathe and dress as well) seems jealous of kids. Cissy appears to have the hots for her own uncle, while younger kids are always worried they're about to be shipped off to next foster home, ugh!!! Pass the Kleenex. . . and call CPS.The jarringly realistic post-show fates of several cast members--Anissa ""Buffy"" Jones died of a massive drug OD less than ten years after the show premiered (apparently due in large part to her difficulty in adjusting to post-stardom teendom); Brian ""Uncle Bill"" Keith shot himself in the head--only add to the creep factor.Still, oddly watchable in some unexplainable way--it's the sitcom equivalent of those cheesy old Big Eye art paintings of street urchins and starving dogs gazing forlornly from dirty alleyways. Or, thanks to the preponderance of bleached hair (even Unca Bill is a bottle blonde!) and monotone line readings, Children of The Damned with a laugh track.

Brain Keith does a superb job playing Bill Davis, a rich bachelor, who steps forward to do the moral and decent thing by taking in his two nieces and nephew.

The chemistry between the actors is perfect. I really didn't think much of the show when I saw it 35 years ago but I am now extremely impressed by the writing of the episodes and the high-quality production values.

I didnt remember this sitcom being heavy with jokes and punchlines, so I worried that it might have aged badly. I'm very relieved to say that the 30 episodes in this set are wonderful and the entire cast is restrained, believable and talented. This is one of those heart-warmer comedies that aren't made any more. Its humor comes from the situations rather than a goofy setup or (worse yet) impossibly adult wisecracks coming out of the mouths of young children. When bachelor Bill Davis (Brian Keith) inherits the three children of his late brother and sister-in-law (Anissa Jones, Johnnie Whittaker and Kathy Garver), he and his butler (er ""gentleman's gentleman, Mr. French, played by Sebastian Cabot)find themselves suddenly having to raise three kids. Be forewarned, the first few episodes are real tear-jerkers as the kids continually believe they will be sent away to another relative. The DVD's picture is vibrant--it was one of the first color TV shows besides BONANZA-- and the stories are captivating.The only confusing part of the DVD experience is that each episode begins with a pre-opening credits sequence--sometimes the scene that plays is a scene you'll see later in the episode and sometimes its the actual beginning of the episode, so don't be too quick to speed past the opening sequence. The DVD doesn't have chapter breaks within each episode. Sadly, there's no commentaries (only Garver and Whittaker are still alive from the core cast) but on the final disk, Garver hosts a special feature that takes you behind the scenes of the show and she's just as effusive and attractive as she was when she was first cast in the show--she was 18 when she was cast as 15-year-old Sissy. She also explains how Brian Keith agreed to do the TV show as long as he could film all his scenes one right after another (much the way Fred MacMurray did on MY THREE SONS), so he would only have to commit to a few months filming a TV show rather than a much lengthier filming period. This meant that many of the cast filmed their reaction shots to sequences weeks later. Even with this knowldge, its almost impossible to spot any odd continuity; it plays seemlessly--which is certainly high praise for William D. Russell, who directed all by the first episode.Guests stars during this first season (1966)includes Myrna Loy, with reoccurring appearnaces by Heather Angel as another nanny, Miss Faversham. John Williams appears in episodes 18--26 as Mr French's brother, who looks after the family when his brother is called away (Cabot was ill at the time--can anyone explain why Cabot is wearing a bandage on his hand for almost half of the first season's episodes?).Best episodes for season one include: the first show, ""Buffy""; ""Take Two Aspirin"" (ep #11, when Uncle Bill is in Mexico and Fench gets the flu); ""The Thursday Man"" (ep #13, which deepens the characters of Sissy and Mr French); ""All Around the Town"" (ep #17, where the twins get lost in the city); and ""Once In Love With Buffy"" (ep #21 when Aunt Fran returns and wants Buffy and Sissy to come live with her).This is a DVD set well worth owning.NOTE: One of the other reviews posted on Amazon complained that there was no list of the episodes on each disk. My set contained a glossy insert that listed all teh shows and noted which disk they were on. Maybe it was left out of his set.

980606,AJU5TQXWQ9U97,B000EXZFS0,"Russell Mariacher ""R.A.M.'67""","[1, 1]","OK....The last I saw of these were those TV Land airings, and from that time around, in contrast from sitting through reruns during the early '70s, I can now see how much of ""Family Affair"" was irregular, compared to the other Don Fedderson production of note, ""My Three Sons"" (especially when it got a breath of fresh air via the establishment of Ernie as a new son and Robbie became the ""oldest"" one with Mike gone). The inconsistencies, however, seem minor, compared to the show that became the modern day ""FA"": ""Full House""; the WEAKEST ""FA"" episode had more chuckles than the STRONGEST ""FH"" (depending on how one defines ""strong""), hands down!It helps that ""FA"" was family friendly without being gooey and sickly sweet; there's a hint of non-""political correctness"" that runs like a thread through the whole show, and that's conveyed through Brian Keith's low-key, ""gruff"" performance as Uncle Bill. He keeps things grounded in reality, so the children are never really spoiled. The THREE ""FH"" male leads could never equal ONE Brian Keith!MPI's first DVD issue of the series began with this first season set. If you want them uncut and in color that looks brighter than the TV Land airings, then this is your first sampling of a JACKPOT, DVD speaking! One could have expected more with the ""extras"", but Kathy Garver (Cissy), plus a sampling of stills is better than nothing. (Remember, all of this may yet get remastered anew, someday, including the adding on of MORE ""extras"". Blu-ray? Never say never!)The pilot, ""Buffy"", still hits me right in the heart and gut; it's unique that the show (presumably) sold, in part, on Anissa Jones' performance ALONE, as Jody (Johnny Whitaker) and Cissy only came around at the very end of the pilot! More of a surprise was finding out Brian Keith was filmed at different times so he could still have a movie career, having an arrangement like Fred MacMurray did for ""MTS""!If any CHARACTER can be labeled as inconsistent, it would be Cissy; primarily, she comes off as very bright, but often, it doesn't take much more than BOYS to have her make many a misjudgment, one would swear! Garver manages to do her part well, despite script irregularities; she's showcased in many good first season episodes, including the sentimental ""The Thursday Man"". (If I recall right, they actually tried to remake THAT episode for the notorious ""FA"" update with Gary Cole and Tim Curry!) That said, what was it with with the lighting of those shows where there was ALWAYS a shadow below Cissy's upper lip everytime she talked or smiled? Beyond that, I still think she was CUTE, particularly when she had knee socks on!Not bad, but not perfect, either. It's special, most of all, because these shows are UNCUT, and not every TV series available on Amazon (or elsewhere) can be claimed as such! Get this while you can at a sale price for your money's worth. Sturdy, compact DVD case makes for better storage and greater value! Time to look for Mrs. Beasley's glasses.

He was just darling when he kept doing bad things to get ""socked"" or severely punished to know how much his Uncle Bill loved him.Well, I'm going through these episodes pretty quickly, so I hope the powers at be won't take too long to release the remaining 4 seasons of this wonderful family classic!!!",5,BUFFY AND JODY WERE SO ADORABLE THEY WILL SIMPLY MELT YOUR HEART!!!!!,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,830,"['be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'show', 'dvd', 'quite', 'thrill', 'considering', 'been', 'years', 'show', 'been', 'seen', 'syndication', ""'d"", 'almost', 'forgotten', 'how', 'truly', 'adorable', 'Buffy', 'Jody', 'were', 'first', 'season', 'Anissa', 'Jones', 'was', 'such', 'amazing', 'talent', 'episode', 'Mrs.', 'Beasley', 'Where', 'are', 'instead', 'character', 'Buffy', 'acting', 'histerical', 'loss', 'beloved', 'Mrs.', 'Beasley', 'doll', 'had', 'amazing', 'range', 'emotion', 'sadness', 'brought', 'tears.Johnnie', 'Whitaker', 'Jody', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'darling', 'when', 'kept', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'get', 'socked', 'severely', 'punished', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'loved', 'him.Well', ""'m"", 'going', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'hope', 'powers', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'release', 'remaining', '4', 'seasons', 'wonderful', 'family', 'classic']",Family Affair: Season 1
980613,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000EXZFS0,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[9, 11]","Ok this sitcom family had as much in common with real life family issues as pliad dinasours with long purple tongues wearing ruby red lipstick do.  That said Family Affair was not meant to be super serious reality television.  Family Affair was an escape from the painful reality of life into a more perfect what if world.Granted Family Affair was syrupy and maudelin but it also helped some people.  Family Affair was among the first TV shows that dared suggest a family can be forged out of componants that did not include a traditional Mommy and Daddy.  I was raised by loving caring awesome grandparents after my parents died at age five.  Like Buffy, Jody and Cissy we learned that the true enduring quality of family life is founded on the love we invest in each other.As a black male child who grew up with two sisters all orphaned and in the loving care of his grandparents Family Affair helped us find peace and acceptance in our situation.  I always felt a lot better about myself after having watched Family Affair because, I felt less odd or alone.  Family Affair showed that the true meaning of family focused not just on blood but intensity of love shared among its members.  The lessons of Family Affair were priceless in my 1960'syouth and are of greater value in today's world of blended non-traditional families.  Blended families are not a new thing, as Family Affair shows all who watch.  Blended Non-Traditional Families can work if all who live in them invest themselves honestly which was the true message of Family Affair.I refuse to buy into the shallow minded logic that judges Family Affair by the personal life outcomes of the stars that breathed life into its characters as they are two completely seperate things.  Family Affair is a work of fiction designed to educate, uplift and entertain feats it accomplishes quite well.  Family Affair reveals the very basic equation of love that ties families together and is worth its price on those merits alone.  Add to that Family Affair is a nice walk down memory lane to boot!  Family Affairs core message is more relevent and needed today in 2006 than it was in 1960's when I was young!",5,Family Affair showcased the 60's perfect ideal of family.

I Netflixed it and I have to say it's a good show but the kids are a bit young. Reading lines somewhat distractedly, you get the feeling the show is propped up by lisps and cuteness. I must say THEY ARE the cutest kids ever but it really isn't enough. Uncle Bill is fine. French is fine. The set up is interesting. But there just isn't any thing here to elevate it to the next level.As far as nostaglia, it is errie to see the opening to this and to remember it as a child because I doubt I have seen it since I was 5 or 6. The credits are a bit of a mystery and it's hard to understand what they were going for. I think I would have preffered a tradional opening, showing the cast as opposed to flickering diamonds or whatever that was all about. The film print remastering could have used more work, many artifacts, and the sound is ""ok"", but this is all just typical MPI laziness. Better than the Hillbillies film remastering ""debacle"", but then the show is newer so that's to be expected. MPI is starting to feel like a bootlegger to me.I will pass on this as a purchase but it was a fun watch.",3,A good show but not classic,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,1191,"['may', 'be', 'classic', 'overall', 'scheme', 'Lucy', 'Honeymooners', 'Brady', 'Netflixed', 'have', 'say', 'good', 'show', 'kids', 'are', 'bit', 'young', 'Reading', 'lines', 'somewhat', 'distractedly', 'get', 'feeling', 'show', 'propped', 'up', 'lisps', 'cuteness', 'must', 'say', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'cutest', 'kids', 'ever', 'really', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'fine', 'French', 'fine', 'set', 'up', 'interesting', 'just', ""n't"", 'thing', 'here', 'elevate', 'next', 'level.As', 'far', 'nostaglia', 'errie', 'see', 'opening', 'remember', 'child', 'doubt', 'have', 'seen', 'was', '5', '6', 'credits', 'are', 'bit', 'mystery', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preffered', 'tradional', 'opening', 'showing', 'cast', 'opposed', 'flickering', 'diamonds', 'whatever', 'was', 'film', 'print', 'remastering', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'work', 'many', 'artifacts', 'sound', 'ok', 'just', 'typical', 'MPI', 'laziness', 'Better', 'Hillbillies', 'film', 'remastering', 'debacle', 'then', 'show', 'newer', 'be', 'expected', 'MPI', 'starting', 'feel', 'bootlegger', 'me.I', 'will', 'pass', 'purchase', 'was', 'fun', 'watch']",Family Affair: Season 1
