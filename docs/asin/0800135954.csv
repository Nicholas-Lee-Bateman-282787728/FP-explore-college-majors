The violence throughout the film scared me a bit like when Tristan after Samuel died brought his heart home. Eew. Some of it are bloody that it got me tense. So now I'm trying to decide about selling it and vowed not to look at it anymore. I wanted to watch this 'cause I was doing research on the late Gordon Tootoosis and that was what brought me into this and I watched a clip where Isabel Two dies.

163674,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800135954,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","`Legends of the Fall' is an easy movie to love.  It stars one of the most charming men working in film today.  It also stars a man regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation.  It is beautifully shot and very well acted; filled to the brim with sentiment and grace and an ending so emotionally gut-wrenching you'll be unable to hold back the tears.It's not perfect, but it's still very, very good.The story tells of three brothers, Tristan, Alfred and Samuel as they grow up in the wilderness with their father during the 1900's.  Their lives are affected by war, love and tradition and as the film progresses we see them build and the tear down relationships with others and with each other.  Tristan is the wild one, the one most influenced by the ways of the Native American, especially One Stab, the faithful friend of the family.  Alfred is the more mature brother, at least from a societal standpoint.  He is heavily affected by his father's love and adoration of Tristan over all else, especially since he feels as though he has earned the spot of favorite.  Samuel is the youngest and greenest of the three.  The film takes little time to really get to know him since the focal point of the film is Tristan.The film starts very strong, developing a nicely crafted character study of this family and the interwoven layers that make up their lives.  The first half of the film will just suck you right in.  The second half falters a bit as it ditches the depth it originally instituted and comes off more like a soap opera, with brothers bickering uselessly over the love of a woman.  This was a disappointment for me because I expected something a little more poignant, especially when considering the films beautiful start.  It's not a fault that will deter you though; my wife still loves this movie, and I still like it very much.The films biggest selling point is the acting, which is for the most part perfect.  Aidan Quinn is stellar as the jilted Alfred, wearing his frustrations on his sleeve without overwhelming us with clich&eacute;d emotions.  Julia Ormond is divine as Susannah, the woman who tears the family apart.  Her controlled and meaningful delivery makes her characters arc all the more devastating.  Anthony Hopkins is also fantastic here and the boy's father William.  He is one of those actors who cannot do everything, but what he can do he does flawlessly.  This is a flawless performance (and that whole `I am happy' scene just gets me every time).  Henry Thomas is a bit boring, but the film is not very interested with him.Brad Pitt gives what may be his finest performance to date here, seriously.  He totally gets Tristan and delivers a solid portrayal of a man's honest emotions; guilt, pain, love, remorse, betrayal, anger, responsibility.  I was blown away with each passing frame as he built more and more on the man he initially created.  It's such a tremendous performance; truly Oscar Worthy.So, in the end I highly recommend this film.  I give it a solid B, and I'd throw nominations the way of Pitt and Hopkins and maybe even Ormond and Zwick.  There is a lot to love here, and the end result is nothing short of memorable and entertaining.  It loosens the reigns towards the end, but it's a small grievance when you consider all that there is to enjoy.",4,Solid entertainment that's very easy to enjoy...,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3313,"['Legends', 'Fall', 'easy', 'movie', 'love', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'men', 'working', 'film', 'today', 'also', 'man', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'filled', 'brim', 'sentiment', 'grace', 'ending', 'so', 'emotionally', 'gut-wrenching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unable', 'hold', 'back', 'tears.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'good.The', 'story', 'tells', 'three', 'brothers', 'Tristan', 'Alfred', 'Samuel', 'grow', 'up', 'wilderness', 'father', '1900', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'war', 'love', 'tradition', 'film', 'see', 'build', 'tear', 'down', 'relationships', 'others', 'other', 'Tristan', 'wild', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'influenced', 'ways', 'Native', 'American', 'especially', 'One', 'Stab', 'faithful', 'friend', 'family', 'Alfred', 'more', 'mature', 'brother', 'least', 'societal', 'standpoint', 'heavily', 'affected', 'father', 'love', 'adoration', 'Tristan', 'else', 'especially', 'earned', 'spot', 'favorite', 'Samuel', 'youngest', 'greenest', 'three', 'film', 'little', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Tristan.The', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'developing', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'character', 'study', 'family', 'interwoven', 'layers', 'make', 'up', 'lives', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'suck', 'right', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'depth', 'originally', 'instituted', 'off', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'brothers', 'bickering', 'uselessly', 'love', 'woman', 'was', 'disappointment', 'expected', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'poignant', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'films', 'beautiful', 'start', 'not', 'fault', 'will', 'deter', 'wife', 'still', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'much.The', 'films', 'biggest', 'selling', 'point', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'perfect', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'stellar', 'jilted', 'Alfred', 'wearing', 'frustrations', 'sleeve', 'overwhelming', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'emotions', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'divine', 'Susannah', 'woman', 'who', 'family', 'apart', 'controlled', 'meaningful', 'delivery', 'characters', 'arc', 'more', 'devastating', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'also', 'fantastic', 'here', 'boy', 'father', 'William', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'everything', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'flawlessly', 'flawless', 'performance', 'whole', 'am', 'happy', 'scene', 'just', 'time', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'bit', 'boring', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'interested', 'him.Brad', 'Pitt', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'here', 'seriously', 'totally', 'Tristan', 'solid', 'portrayal', 'man', 'honest', 'emotions', 'guilt', 'pain', 'love', 'remorse', 'betrayal', 'anger', 'responsibility', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'passing', 'frame', 'built', 'more', 'more', 'man', 'initially', 'created', 'such', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'truly', 'Oscar', 'Worthy.So', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'give', 'solid', 'B', ""'d"", 'throw', 'nominations', 'way', 'Pitt', 'Hopkins', 'maybe', 'even', 'Ormond', 'Zwick', 'lot', 'love', 'here', 'end', 'result', 'nothing', 'short', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'reigns', 'end', 'small', 'grievance', 'when', 'consider', 'enjoy']",N/A

163677,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0800135954,Anthony Hinde,"[54, 63]","Family saga is usually the domain of female audiences but while there is no denying that &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; is a family saga, it has the power to keep any demographic,  over the age of ten, spellbound. Love  and jealousy are still the central themes and yet the characters are so  large that I doubt many people would not envy them, in some way at  least.The Ludlows are almost mythical Americans. They live a tough  but free existence in the North Country. Ruled by Colonel William Ludlow,  (Anthony Hopkins), a Father carved from granite, the family's three sons  grow up to be almost as tough. And for a man who spent his last  professional years fighting for the rights of the native American's, a son  who has absorbed native culture, along with the best of western values, has  to hold a special  place in his heart.Tristan Ludlow, (Brad Pitt),  is the focus of our attention from the start. His wild and fearless spirit  is guided by One Stab, the colonel's loyal Indian companion. It is One Stab  that narrates Tristan's story and from him we learn that Tristan's destiny  is entwined with his animal spirit, the Grizzly Bear. As a boy he dares an  enormous sleeping grizzly and they take some of each other's blood.  Interpreting his later choices through the moods of the bear is a  fascinating idea.The pace of events pick up the moment the  youngest son, Samuel, brings home his bride to be. The beautiful Susannah,  (Julia Ormond), manages to steal  the hearts of all three brothers and the  father as well, although he has the wisdom to act correctly. Samuel arrives  with more concern for the growing war in Europe than for his new love. His  desire to play his part in the fight is opposed by the Colonel, jaded by  the Government's past immoral acts. But nothing can stop a young man with a  cause. Despite his brother's protection he manages to fulfill his destiny,  opening the door to further possibilities for his brothers, with  Susannah.She manages to set the brothers against each other and  forces the eldest, Alfred, (Aidan Quinn), on a new path entirely; one that  takes him to the U.S. congress, supported by less than honorable men. All  of this makes for a heady brew, plenty of drama, powerful performances and  broken hearts. For my money, the film wouldn't have been the same without  Isabel Two, played by both Karina Lombard and Sekwan Auger. She waits  patiently for her chance with Tristan to come. She and One Stab, form the  calm center to the hurricane that is the Ludlow family. And like a  hurricane, one you've been touched, you'll never forget &quot;Legends of  the Fall&quot;.",4,"Strong men, tough times, legends.",962496000,"07 2, 2000",2000,2634,"['Family', 'saga', 'usually', 'domain', 'female', 'audiences', 'denying', 'quot', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'quot', 'family', 'saga', 'power', 'keep', 'demographic', 'age', 'ten', 'spellbound', 'Love', 'jealousy', 'are', 'still', 'central', 'themes', 'yet', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'large', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'envy', 'way', 'least.The', 'Ludlows', 'are', 'almost', 'mythical', 'Americans', 'live', 'tough', 'free', 'existence', 'North', 'Country', 'Ruled', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Ludlow', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Father', 'carved', 'granite', 'family', 'three', 'sons', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'almost', 'tough', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'professional', 'years', 'fighting', 'rights', 'native', 'American', 'son', 'who', 'absorbed', 'native', 'culture', 'best', 'western', 'values', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart.Tristan', 'Ludlow', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'focus', 'attention', 'start', 'wild', 'fearless', 'spirit', 'guided', 'One', 'Stab', 'colonel', 'loyal', 'Indian', 'companion', 'One', 'Stab', 'Tristan', 'story', 'learn', 'Tristan', 'destiny', 'entwined', 'animal', 'spirit', 'Grizzly', 'Bear', 'boy', 'enormous', 'sleeping', 'grizzly', 'take', 'other', 'blood', 'Interpreting', 'later', 'choices', 'moods', 'bear', 'fascinating', 'idea.The', 'pace', 'events', 'pick', 'up', 'moment', 'youngest', 'son', 'Samuel', 'home', 'bride', 'be', 'beautiful', 'Susannah', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'steal', 'hearts', 'three', 'brothers', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'wisdom', 'act', 'correctly', 'Samuel', 'more', 'concern', 'growing', 'war', 'Europe', 'new', 'love', 'desire', 'play', 'part', 'fight', 'opposed', 'Colonel', 'jaded', 'Government', 'past', 'immoral', 'acts', 'nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'young', 'man', 'cause', 'brother', 'protection', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'opening', 'door', 'further', 'possibilities', 'brothers', 'Susannah.She', 'set', 'brothers', 'other', 'eldest', 'Alfred', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'new', 'path', 'entirely', 'one', 'U.S.', 'congress', 'supported', 'less', 'honorable', 'men', 'heady', 'brew', 'plenty', 'drama', 'powerful', 'performances', 'broken', 'hearts', 'money', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'Isabel', 'Two', 'played', 'Karina', 'Lombard', 'Sekwan', 'Auger', 'patiently', 'chance', 'Tristan', 'come', 'One', 'Stab', 'form', 'calm', 'center', 'hurricane', 'Ludlow', 'family', 'hurricane', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'touched', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'quot', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'quot']",N/A

Brad Pitt lacks depth in Legends of the Fall because he is not serious enough to take the next step in order to expose himself in terms of characterization, so I end up watching Brad Pitt to feign himself through crying from time to time. The direction of Legends of the Fall  is somewhat stiff and unfocused. It doesn't shed light on emotions and altering relationship between the characters. It is basically see this and see that. Really, Legends of the Fall is about a family getting away with murder and nothing else. Tristan kills a lot of people, Samuel has himself killed, Alfred kills a sheriff; the supposed wife of one brother and later the wife of the other two brothers commits suicide; the father murders people; Decker waylays a cop, and One Stab, I guess, scalps many. So...yeah, it's a nice family of killers. Legends of the Fall should be titled more aptly as Killers of the Fall. It is a poor film with a laughable direction and weak everything else.4/13: Woe is me...as Susannah Fincannon reaches for her nickel-plated 0.38 snubnosed revolver and shoots herself. Does she do it because for one of the following reasons:a. Tristan wasn't interested?b. She thought she was special?c. She decided to stay in Montana for nothing?d. Isabel was prettier?e. She was of elitism class?f. She slept with three brothers?g. She was once married to Samuel?h. And also to Alfred?i. She was irrelevant?j. She can't have Tristan?k. She was just a lay to Tristan?l. Tristan wasn't interested?m. Isabel had children with Tristan?n. Tristan wasn't interested?o. She can't have Tristan?p. All of the above reasons?Whatever that is all about, she takes the cake for being the most pathetic and silliest character of the film. By the way, I haven't seen the Borzoi again after he got off the train, so what happened to the dog? Anyway, next to her, running in a close second, is Samuel. Could he have been labeled as a ""village idiot?"" The third place goes to Alfred. Poor Alfred, the colors of his eyes aren't enough to sway anyone over, mmm? The fourth is One-Stab. The funniest cornball scene is when he pretended to scalp the heads of the dead men. I am like, ""Uh...Ritalin, anyone?"" Next up is Anthony Hopkins for his usual overacting and phony magnanimousness. Finally, the last but not the least, Brad Pitt. It seems to me that during the film, either of the two things will happen: people die around him or he takes a long vacation break and comes back looking better than ever. Everybody sure wears perfectly-pressed, well-tailored clothes, and Brad's hair is perfectly posed and blond in every scene. All in all, as good as Brad Pitt is in Legends of the Fall, the cinematography is the winning feature of the film.",4,"A Funny, Melodramatic Picture.",1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2966,"['Viewed', '8/03', '1/05', '2/07', '4/13Rate', '72/07', 'ridiculously', 'made', 'picture', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'physical', 'transformations', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'sensible', 'intelligent', 'dialogues', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'depth', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'not', 'serious', 'enough', 'take', 'next', 'step', 'order', 'expose', 'terms', 'characterization', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'feign', 'crying', 'time', 'time', 'direction', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'unfocused', ""n't"", 'shed', 'light', 'emotions', 'altering', 'relationship', 'characters', 'basically', 'see', 'see', 'Really', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'family', 'getting', 'away', 'murder', 'nothing', 'else', 'Tristan', 'lot', 'people', 'Samuel', 'killed', 'Alfred', 'sheriff', 'supposed', 'wife', 'one', 'brother', 'later', 'wife', 'other', 'two', 'brothers', 'commits', 'suicide', 'father', 'murders', 'people', 'Decker', 'cop', 'One', 'Stab', 'guess', 'scalps', 'many', 'So', 'yeah', 'nice', 'family', 'killers', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'should', 'be', 'titled', 'more', 'aptly', 'Killers', 'Fall', 'poor', 'film', 'laughable', 'direction', 'weak', 'everything', 'else.4/13', 'Woe', 'Susannah', 'Fincannon', 'nickel-plated', '0.38', 'snubnosed', 'revolver', 'shoots', 'do', 'one', 'following', 'reasons', 'a.', 'Tristan', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'b', 'thought', 'was', 'special', 'c', 'decided', 'stay', 'Montana', 'nothing', 'd', 'Isabel', 'was', 'prettier', 'e', 'was', 'elitism', 'class', 'f', 'slept', 'three', 'brothers', 'g', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'Samuel', 'h', 'also', 'Alfred', 'i', 'was', 'irrelevant', 'j', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Tristan', 'k', 'was', 'just', 'lay', 'Tristan', 'l', 'Tristan', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'm', 'Isabel', 'had', 'children', 'Tristan', 'n', 'Tristan', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'o', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Tristan', 'p', 'above', 'reasons', 'cake', 'being', 'most', 'pathetic', 'silliest', 'character', 'film', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Borzoi', 'again', 'got', 'off', 'train', 'what', 'happened', 'dog', 'Anyway', 'next', 'running', 'close', 'second', 'Samuel', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'labeled', 'village', 'idiot', 'third', 'place', 'Alfred', 'Poor', 'Alfred', 'colors', 'eyes', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'sway', 'anyone', 'mmm', 'fourth', 'One-Stab', 'funniest', 'cornball', 'scene', 'when', 'pretended', 'scalp', 'heads', 'dead', 'men', 'am', 'Uh', 'Ritalin', 'anyone', 'Next', 'up', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'usual', 'overacting', 'phony', 'magnanimousness', 'Finally', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'film', 'two', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'people', 'die', 'long', 'vacation', 'break', 'back', 'looking', 'better', 'ever', 'Everybody', 'sure', 'perfectly-pressed', 'well-tailored', 'clothes', 'Brad', 'hair', 'perfectly', 'posed', 'blond', 'scene', 'as', 'good', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'cinematography', 'winning', 'feature', 'film']",N/A

The oldest brother, Alfred, is played by Aidan Quinn, who does a great job of expressing all the changes Alfred goes through. The middle brother, Tristan, is played by Brad Pitt with long hair and wild ways, in part because he was largely raised by his father's Indian friend. The youngest brother, Samuel, is played by Henry Thomas. He is charming and lovable, and so of course he's the one to die in World War One. Sam's beautiful fiance Susanna, played by Julia Ormond, waited for him at home on the ranch with his father.Where is William's wife in all this? She departed long ago, saying she hated the ranch, and is mostly known through letters she writes in her elegant Victorian parlor in some city. We never even find out what city.When Alfred and Tristan come back from the war, grieving for their brother, they both fall in love with Susanna. And lest you think I've told you too much of the plot, let's just say that all this was basically revealed on the cover of the DVD. There's more, lots and lots more. And not predictable or boring. The beautiful scenery, wonderful costumes and sets, and Brad Pitt his sexy self, certainly make this a visually stunning movie. The intensity and complexity of relationships and emotions are well done, never over done. You get the strong feeling everyone really wants to understand each other and be good to one another, but they screw up in a variety of ways.Even if Brad Pitt's naked body doesn't send you into rapture, you're still going to love this movie.",5,Wow!

In fact, you can play a drinking game with how many times the above 2-word quotes in my title were uttered throughout the film and come out totally blitzed.  Why has anyone else not noticed this, because it irritated the living fecal material out of me.  Speaking of the back door, this movie makes otherwise talented actors like Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn look like jackasses, but I'm really not intending to make them the butt of my jokes...despite the fact that the post-stroke Hopkins character looks alarmingly like David Crosby on crack.The point is that this is a movie aimed at teenagers and discontented housewives who drool over Brad Pitt any way they can get him.  Apparently this includes Brad looking just like a homeless guy who spent too many years eating hamster poop and dog chow in a garbage dumpster, the trendy au currant actor's version of a mobile home.  His love interest is the bland, big-toothed, uncharming Julia Ormond who is constantly sticking her fingers in her mouth.  My guess is she is trying to hold down the bile while barely getting through a horribly written script, backed by a music score that wants to be a knockoff of Dances with Kevin Costner, but ends up sounding less appealing than the dinner music heard throughout Little House on the Prairie's run.  She is no Audrey Hepburn, and I have dispised her since the remake of Sabrina.  Well, I've despised her MORE.  The way she says ""Tristan"" makes me want to clock her one, or is it the fact that the name Tristan makes me want to clock anyone who would give that name to a kid?Everyone is in love with bucktook Susannah, including that looney old man of theirs who wants peace, but shoots everyone after he's got a stroke.  The preachy, hypocritical message in this silly flick doesn't even compensate for the fact that this movie's real title is Brad Pitt:  The Movie.  We have Brad the Native American--whatever that is, Brad the nasty heart-stealing (literally, folks) WWI soldier, Brad the insane version of Columbus, and Brad the hot Robert Redford wannabe bootlegger.  It's Brad, pretty as can be, all clean shaven on a horsie with his long flaxen locks flowing in the wind.  It's Brad in a manly uniform avenging his dweeby little brother's death.  Brad beats up a bartender.  Brad is bearded, scuzzy, and mean to horses.  Brad looks all doped up in some foreign country, resembling a Jim Morrison clone.  Brad.  Everyone is in love with his Tristan character.  Must be the horrible smell.  I love guys who stink and don't display any personal hygiene myself, but it's even better when they abuse animals and cause misery everywhere they go.  They cry and they die in droves.

The four leading actors are good as their other films will bear witness to, however Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, and Julia Ormond can't escape from a idiotic plot and overly dramatic unrealistic script.Repeatedly in the film we see people going away while those left behind huddle together with tears in their eyes while overly dramatic music tells the viewer that something emotional is happening, even if it is not. The number of these scene where someone goes away or comes back again reach the point where the viewer just doesn't care anymore and the music used for each of these extended good-bye scenes eventually becomes so repetitive that you can't bear to finish the film.Pitt is indeed handsome and he gives the film a real acting effort. However, the film appears to be a vehicle to display Pitt in a range of activities and costumes, as a cowboy, a World War I soldier, a ship captain, a big game hunter, a whiskey bootlegger, a native man of multiple cultures, etc. We see Brad Pitt barely clothed or nude in love making scenes that seem highly orchestrated to titalate the viewer. How tiresome this all becomes.Anthony Hopkins is a superb actor as his performance in Remains of the Day should attest. However, in this film he is a two dimensional cardboard version of a strict father who becomes a stroke victim with a shotgun. This is one of those films where we are told about people's feelings rather than experience it through their acting skills. We are told that Colonel Ludlow loved a women more than she loved him but we never really understand this odd relationship between Colonol and Elizabeth Ludlow.Aiden Quinn tries his best, but his character lacks insights necessary to become more than a poorly articulated spurned man. Aiden Quinn has the third most lines in the whole film and yet lacks some sense of reality and coherence as a character.Julia Ormond plays a young woman who must be totally crazy to put up with the Ludlow family which only brings her misery. At least ten times in the film, any common-sense would have compelled her to leave the wilderness home of the Ludlows and go get a real life.The outdoor photography was excellent, of the quality of a good National Geographic nature film, but this alone does not save a film that is based on a screenplay that was pitiful.

At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing.

A tale that follows 3 men who grow up brothers but ultimately become their own man. Their father, played by Anthony Hopkins, is terrific in this film as usual. Julia Ormond plays the very credible love interest of all 3 brothers at different times in their lives. This story has it all. love, death, romance, scenics, fine acting, great casting, great music (James Horner) ... everything. I highly recommend this one to anyone. I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this film.For those who have this on vhs or laser or even the early dvd version of this film, you need this new printing. It's much better than anything before it. The colors are crisp, the images are spectacular and the sound is fantastic.I listened to the Ed Zwick and Brad Pitt commentary as well and it's great too. You can hear the love in their voices for this film. Some great anecdotes and great insight into the making of this film. Very laid back commentary with lots on info.The deleted scenes are not that great. They seem to be just tacked on to the disc to tack them on. Ultimately you can see why they were cut from the film, but I like seeing this stuff anyways. Better to have, then not.Anyways, check out this film if you have never seen it. Even if you are not really a fan of Brad Pitt's you'll like him in this role. Anthony Hopkins is great, Aidan Quinn, wow this guy can tell a story with his eyes alone and Henry Thomas is fabulous as the younger of the brood.

Hopkins' performance loses subtlety towards the end, and Brad Pitt is sometimes too expressionless, but Aidan Quinn never wavers, and Henry Thomas displays the quality of innocence which led to Spielberg casting him as the star of E.T. as a boy actor. James Horner's music is emotional and appropriate, however it is sometimes too prominent in the mix. With five major stars, the film gives them equal prominence, so it would have benefited from making the characters more sympathetic.

Edward Zwick brings a powerful story of brotherly love and conflict to the screen, a story that stays as fresh and vigorous as the majestic northern Rockies.The conflict that drives this story involves brothers Alfred and Tristan Ludlow (Aidan Quinn and Brad Pitt).  Here are two brothers torn apart by their love for the same woman, and by Alfred's resentment that Tristan is his father's favorite son.  Tristan--wild, self-destructive, guilt-ridden--must exorcise some demons of his own (and does).  The film moves relentlessly toward a compelling climax, when the brothers come to one another's aid, when a father's love for his outcast son is renewed.Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as family patriarch Colonel Ludlow.

Adventure, romance, action, war, and intense drama that will absorb you into the film, if the beautiful cinematography of the Montana mountains and rivers and James Horner's incredible score don't first.  An academy award winner for best cinematography, best sound and best art direction, Legends of The Fall also had 4 Golden Globe nominations - including best actor (Brad Pitt), best original score (James Horner), best director, and best film.The cast of Legends is strong and powerful, led by Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidinn Quinn.  All give solid performances that are convincing and powerful, and the supporting cast as well are just as strong.  Brad Pitt, though he is many times not the greatest actor, gives an emtional-driven performance as the lead charcater, Tristan.  Somewhat overdramatic at times, overall viewers will thoroughly enjoy some of the powerful scenes he is in in the film.  Anthony Hopkins, in my opinion, probably gives the most solid performance and Aidinn Quinn does a fine job too.Legends is about 3 brothers (Pitt, Quinn, and Henry Thomas) and their father Colonel William Ludlow (Hopkins) who live in a beautiful ranch in northern Montana.  The film begins with last scenes of the Indian Wars, in which William was heavily involved with.  His 3 young boys are introduced before the film skips ahead several years into their adulthood.  The drama begins, when one of the brothers, Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings his fiance' Susannah (Julia Ormond) to live with them, but it is obvious the other brothers are attracted to her and she to one of them.  Upset and frustrated with WWI overseas, the 3 brothers leave the ranch to honor their country.  After returning from war, Legends begins to unfold, leading in many directions - some predicatble and some not.  Some things happen that will leave one thrilled, some things angry, and others sad.  The emotions grow, and the great performances by the cast shine onto the audience, to the point where it felt like I was part of that family.  The end of the film is satisfying, and you'll definetly want to watch it again soon.If you have never seen Legends of The Fall, and you love films in the epic tradition such as ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Last of The Mohicans"", Legends will definetly satisy to the fullest.

Somehow she ends up in roles like this all the time... with different men fighting over her. I don't see why anyone would fight over her. Minus Ormond this film is excellent with the patriarch of the family played by an incomparable Anthony Hopkins whose forceful and important presence is felt even after his character suffers a stroke and ends up unable to speak anymore. Hopkins' character conveys the personal pain he feels over the death of the youngest son and even more reflects his pain when the middle son, and presumably the favourite (Brad Pitt) runs away. Brad Pitt plays his character with passion and conviction, and the viewer can actually feel his fraternal love as he goes to war to try to protect his younger brother from harm. You can also sense his heart being broken as he cannot save the younger brother. Also excellent in this film as the eldest brother, Aidan Quinn, who is jealous of Brad Pitt's character. Ormond plays the youngest brother's fianc&eacute;e. When the youngest brother dies, Ormond is caught between the affections of Quinn's character and Pitt's character. Ormond loves Pitt but not Quinn. Pitt eventually leaves again and travels around the world losing himself while also trying to find himself. After years pass, Ormond eventually marries Quinn's character. Pitt returns and marries a woman he loves dearly and has children with her. The strained relations between Ormond, Quinn as her husband, and Pitt are actually very well done by all three actors.

So he sets out to raise these three boys and at some point writes to his wife to say... I know how to guide men through war, but this is much harder...Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Colonel Ludlow, discharged from the war because he wanted to regain some sanity. Therefore, he hates government, he despises the drive to conquer and fight over land, and is highly protective of Indians.This family of men lives out in the wilderness, therefore, nature is the chisel that forms the character of the three boys. They are very close and the oldest two, played by Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn, are extremely caring and protective of their younger brother, played by Henry Thomas.The younger son goes away to college and there he meets Susanna, played by Julia Ormond [played Princess Guinevere in the movie First Knight]. He falls in love with her and upon returning home, brings her along to meet the family.As she enters the life of these lonely men, she captures the heart of each and everyone. The father is delighted that a refined lady has joined them because thanks to her they read, sing, and enjoy the feminine side of life.

163728,A16CZRQL23NOIW,0800135954,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[4, 5]","The major virtue of this emblematic film resides in the fiery character of their personages. Since we have born under the designs of the Trojan syndrome, it results us undecipherable certain behavior codes preserved by old legends enrooted and surrounded by the mythic paradigm.The essential core has to with the transition between the natural law and the tenet of the rules. Of course there is a notorious homage to Shakespeare's Titus and King Lear in which concerns to the well visible differences between these three brothers.From Lear we have the relationship between father and child. But Tristan ( thinking about Wagner?) is the embodiment of the irreverence, the son of nature, the alter ego of his father, a disillusioned Colonel who fought bravely in previous combats and singly detests all the related items with politics; he knows the real essence of the meaning of honor and loyalty under country' s service. But the nature is by definition, instinctive, because it has no memory. All his sons will enlist and fight as soldiers in the WW1, and through this process will face the reality of the youth's dreams. The weakest son Samuel looses the vision previous his imminent death (Remember the myth' s premise in the case of Wotan or Ragnar?). Alfred represents the new tradition, the submission and the loyal compliment of the law; he is the civilized man. But Tristan represents the wild force and definitively does not follow the tradition; he simply follows the bliss, the renaissance of the Viking' s spirit, that' s why his untamed spirit will lead him to new overseas lands and traditions.This movie must have shocked many people, because that generation of the last half of the XIX Century, wrought under nature's designs spoke another idiom and even reasoned in another level; but as well as ""The wild bunch"", this is precisely what it most liked me; the confrontation between the hunter approach of the life and the modern way of life. Obviously his author sympathizes with the wildness and Tristan's death is simply a consequence of the natural order or told in other terms, the cosmic designs.This was the film who catapulted Brad Pitt as solid actor, and one must guess that having as partner a monster actor as Anthony Hopkins it's easy understandable. What else can be added to this mesmerizing performance of the best actor of the world Sir Anthony Hopkins?. Formidable photography and sensitive direction. The masterpiece of Edward Zwick.Magnificent in every little detail. There is nothing to disapprove. But just five stars?.

The story has its share of tragedy, with a bittersweet ending. The scenery and music are beautiful and the actors portray their parts perfectly.The movie quite clearly deals with a few of the ways we can ""fall"" as humans and the anguish that results both for us and the ones who love us. The story shows we can fall by choosing to desire that which isn't good for us, and we can fall by believing that we are cursed by God and without hope. It shows how destructive those choices and beliefs can be. For this author, redemption is found in the bond of family.If it weren't for Isabel Two, I might say that the author was very negative toward women. The mother and Susannah are shown to be weak and Susannah is described as the unwitting demise of that all important family bond. She is like ""water that flows into the crack in a rock and when it freezes, breaks the rock"". I was disappointed that she seemed to not see the treasure she had in front of her and to rise up and conquer her misplaced desire. Still, the story was beautifully told and reminds us to be smarter than some of the characters!The movie paced along very well. There is quite a bit of action as well as interesting dialogue. This is not a movie that drags.  There is some sex and some violence, which might be uncomfortable.  However these scenes are no more shocking than a lot of movies out there.The bond of family was beautiful in this story, but they failed to bring in outsiders and make them family while maintaining that bond. This movie is well worth seeing if only for the complex interactions between the characters.

163733,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0800135954,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 5]","A masterpiece in its genre, post Indian war frontier films, Montana in that case. A masterpiece too because of the three sons entirely entrusted to their ex-officer of a father because of the running away of the mother who could not stand the cold winters of Montana and was afraid of grizzly bears, that loving friendly species of furry animals more or less the cousins of our home-friendly teddy bears. Then the eldest son goes to the city of his mother to study and comes back with a fianc&eacute;e, but it is 1914 and the three sons can only follow their patriotic call to go and fight in Europe on the English side. The father is furious but nothing can stop that call of the wild. The picture of the first world war is dramatic when you see these British soldiers running to the German lines with simple rifles and no helmets when the Germans have machine guns, helmets of course and gas masks against their poisonous gases. The eldest son is killed and the youngest son does what an old Indian rite tells him to do. He gets the heart of his brother out and eventually sends it back to his father for it to be buried in due place. Then he gets his Indian colors on his face and goes out to kill and scalp two German machine-gun operators, two of your teeth for one of my teeth. The middle son, wounded on one leg, is sent home and the younger son eventually comes back home. The real stake of the film then is Susanna, the fianc&eacute;e of the elder son who was killed in the war. She was in love before the departure of the three brothers and still is after the war with the younger son, a wild but thrilling personality. A competition between the two surviving brothers starts then. Susanna chooses the younger one, but his wild side, what the Indian story teller calls his bear side, calls him away and he yields to that call and leaves the ranch for several years in order to discover the world and conquer his thirst, hunger and even his ravenous greed for the unknown and the savage. When he comes back Susanna has gone to the middle brother who has become a congressman in the meantime. The younger son, Justin, then accepts the situation and marries the daughter of the main family working on the ranch, from an Indian mother and an American father. He will get two children from her but he will try to compete with the prohibition traffickers who have the full support of the local sheriff. That will lead to a drama, the death of his wife, then his vengeance as soon as he is out of prison, on bail I suspect, and the attempt of the main moonshiner with the help of the sheriff to come and kill that rebellious man. And there the plot thickens and from dramatic we jump to tragic. And the main character of the story all get the ends they deserve, the middle brother, the younger brother, Susannah, the father and all the others, including the local moonshiner and his police friends. The end of the younger brother, in 1963 mind you, is absolutely brilliant. Add to that very strong story the beautiful and breathtaking landscape and mountains of Montana and you really enjoy every single scene. And after it all, when the last die is thrown on the marble of the tombstone you keep in mind the strong images about the first world war and the no less strong discourse of the father against all kinds of war that are declared bad by principle. Are they really bad by principle? Is there nothing to save a war now and then? For this film certainly not, and that is the fault of the politicians who are ready to do any kind of profitable maneuver to keep their juicy positions in government.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,Careful!

163736,AFSQ6YUV4ZGYD,0800135954,jct456,"[5, 6]","If you understand what this movie was intended to be and surrender yourself to that intent, you will have an immensely enjoyable and emotionally satisfying movie-watching experience, with some of the most breathtaking  cinematography and scenery you will ever see, married to a beautiful musical score.  I fall in love with this movie anew each time I watch it, as has everyone to whom I've introduced it.The movie and the Harrison novella (which I highly recommend reading) draw upon a long tradition of Biblical, mythological, and literary models for character and plot.  The personnae in LOTF are archetypes of characters from this tradition, and do not need subtlety of characterization, although each is a fully realized human being in the movie despite the minimalist dialogue.LOTF echoes the stories of Cain and Abel (the Lord favoring the roaming shepherd over the settled farmer), Jacob and Essau, the Prodigal Son, the preference by Priam in the ""Iliad"" for his wild irresponsible son Paris over the responsible rule-abiding Hektor, the berserker warrior (Achilles) who lives beyond his society's norms, the medieval tradition of courtly unrequited love.  Susannah is Cathy from ""Wuthering Heights"", pining after the  brooding bipolar Heathcliffe rather than the nice English gentleman who loves her, or Scarlett pining for Ashley over Rhett.  What other posters have criticized as melodrama or plot predictability is not a fault for this type of storytelling (and I disagree about the melodrama), but very much an essential aspect of it.  The narration by One Stab and quotations from the letters capture very nicely the spare poetic prose of Harrison's novella.There is a reason the movie is called ""Legends"" (myths) of the ""Fall"" (of humanity from a state of Edenic happiness and innocence).This is a movie about the effects of mental illness and post traumatic stress disorder on family structure and personal happiness.  (Unfortunately, the  script did not make as clear as it should have the fact from the novella that Susannah suffered from manic-depression, which explains her paralysis and weepiness.)  LOTF is also a story of how the seeds of fraternal jealousy, sorrow, self-indulgence and irresponsibility are carelessly sown by parental favoritism.  It is a story of wanting to have what we think we love, instead of learning to love what we have.Even without the literary echoes, LOTF tells a powerful story of family relationships in an emotionally true way.  The acting is mostly very good.  I would especially like to commend Aidan Quinn as the older, responsible, repressed brother Alfred, who represents encroaching civilization and governmental control.  What Quinn did with Alfred's inarticulate, fumbling, utterly vulnerable declaration of love for Susannah made that scene one of the most poignant in the movie.  Quinn can say more in a look than most actors can in several lines, and his portrayal of Alfred's stoic pain, goodness, and longing for family connection was so moving that his Alfred was able to be a memorable presence despite the flamboyant and charismatic Tristan of Brad Pitt.  I am not a big Pitt fan, but I thought he did a particularly good job here and showed real emotional depth.  Anthony Hopkins' commanding, domineering, libertarian Col.

Colonel Willian Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) leaves the military over the cruelty of the US Government to the American Indians.  He is raising his three sons without his wife who couldn't bear the lifestyle in Montana where they moved.  He manages the ranch with his friend One Stab who is an Indian, who was in the military with him, and his ranch hand Decker.  William Ludlow has three sons.  Alfred is the oldest and he is an intelligent and aspiring  politician. Tristan (Brad Pitt) is the middle son and he lives a wild life and is best friends with the Indian One Stab. He lives in the wild and hunts and One Stab trains him in many Indian ways. The youngest son Samuel is attending college in the east at Harvard and returns home with his fianc&eacute;.  WW 1 breaks out and Samuel is going to Canada to join the army and fight the Germans.  His two older brothers go with him more to protect him than to really join the war effort.  Samuel is killed and......The tragedy of two surviving brothers returning home after losing their brother is a tale of sadness.  The entire family and their friends are changed for life by that event and the others that follow.

Set in the early 20th c., before and after WWI, it's the story of Captain Ludlow, a veteran of the Indian Wars, marvelously played by Anthony Hopkins, and his three sons. Brad Pitt is Tristan, the middle son, a loner and lover of the wild, incredibly sexy and the favorite. Beautiful Julia Ormond shows up on the arm of the youngest brother, Samuel, as his fianc&eacute;e, and the seclusion that the Captain has enjoyed from the turmoil of the wars is shattered. All three brothers are smitten, but reality intrudes when the idealistic Samuel decides to go to Canada to enlist, and his devoted brothers go with him to protect him. Samuel's foolish decision sets off a train of events that leaves many victims behind, except Tristan, who in the end is ""the rock against which all others break.""Brad Pitt is marvelous in this film--although a bit overwrought at times, he can convey love, sincerity, integrity and humor, as well as brutality and insanity. Aidan Quinn, who seems to do mostly TV these days, is the pained older brother, who does everything right but is never loved.

Every time the violins play and the camera goes hazy we see Brads hair and you know that there will either be a love scene or a killing.The story is melodramatic and so many ridiculous things  happen that it's hard not to laugh. When young Samuel brings his fiancee home from the East it starts a chain of trouble that goes on for the rest of the movie.Susanah, played by the always dreary Julia Ormond,  takes one look at Brad's hair and is smitten.

Why these men all fall in love with a character who is  weepy and doesn't seem to do much but be decorative isn't explained but there it is. Susanah marries Samuel who promptly gets himself killed in WWI in a scene that is so predictable that it's almost funny. Brad's character unties his hair, paints his face and flips out killing a passel of Germans in the process.Time passes. We hear the lush soundtrack, watch the pretty scenery and Brad comes home to his dad, his land and his brother's widow. This time both Brad and Julia's hair blows in the wind and they jump into bed. Alfred, the sensible brother takes the hint and goes to town to get rich on his own.So, we're about to get the happy ending right? Nope.

He takes several years (but doesn't age a bit)to do it and while he's gone Susanah who apparently wants to be a part of this family no matter what, marries poor Alfred even though she doesn't love him.We see scenery, hear the pretty music and jumping jiminy there's ole Brad again. His hair flows in the wind and now he looks happy. He's home to stay and will take care of his old dad, his land, his friends, and discovers that the cute little daughter of the housekeeper, Isabelle has grown up. He marries and gets himself a family. Happy ending now? Nope. Take a deep breath because we still have what feels like hours to go.His good, uncomplicated wife is killed by crooked cops (I'm not even going to get into that part of the plot) and Brad does the same thing he did when Samuel snuffed it. He paints the face, lets the hair go wild, gets a thousand yard stare and starts killing everyone who was involved.Susanah realizes that she's never going to have Brad all to herself and blows her head off, probably becuase there are no more brothers to marry. Alfred makes up with his brother and his father, played by the always great Anthony Hopkins.  Life goes on. Brad outlives the whole family excpet for the narrator who must be about 100 himself and gets eaten by a bear. The end.

It's a tale of an early 1900's family - a father and his 3 sons - who live on a sprawling ranch. Youngest son Samuel, played by Henry Thomas, brings home his fiance, Susannah. His brothers, Alfred and Tristan - Aidan and Brad respectively, also fall under her spell. Anthony Hopkins is the patriarch of the family as Colonel Ludlow.The story itself is very good, weaving the characters in and out of passion and success, anguish, loss and acceptance. Off to war the brothers go, with an exceptionally unforgettable scene. Reunions are bittersweet and intense. That Susannah is loved by all three brothers is actually believable given the setting.Brad Pitt is at his intense sexiest in this movie, with long hair quite appropriate for the wildness of his character. Anthony Hopkins has always been a favorite of mine, and he doesn't disappoint in this one. Julia Ormond as Susannah is lovely and tragically enraptured with Tristan (Brad). It would be difficult not to be, and yet Aidan Quinn is attractive in his more civilized way.

163758,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0800135954,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[3, 5]","Legends of the Fall is an epic family-based story set in a gorgeous landscape - the untamed lands of Montana in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Like most of these sweeping stories, it is about beautiful people and torrential passion. You don't watch these for a lot of sensical plotline and in depth dialogue. You watch for the soap-opera highs, lows and beautiful faces.Brad Pitt and his long hair are the key here. He is the oldest son - the most beloved son - out of three. He is pretty much raised by an ""Indian Chief"" who is a good friend of father Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins had been a soldier in the Indian Wars, had been sickened by what happened, and retreated to Montana to raise his family. Rounding out the family is a servant couple - a native american woman, her American husband, and their half-breed daughter.There are interesting commentaries on the Indian situation here. A pub owner refuses to serve to the chief because of his race. The servants won't send their daughter to the local school because they're worried she'd be picked on. On the other hand, the Chief is portrayed as an ""all wise"" character - one who trains Pitt to kill everything in sight and to scalp people. It made me a bit uncomfortable.But again, this isn't a movie about gripping accuracy. It's about epicness. There are thundering, rich musical interludes, and truly stunning scenery. The actors NEVER seem to age throughout the entire story. They are always young and beautiful.Women aren't treated very well by this film. There's the mom who takes off on her family without any regret. There's the ""half breed"" who is only 20 when Pitt takes her for his wife, in a move bordering on incest given how they grew up together. That's how these stories go, of course. You've got the abandoning cold one, the innocent sweet killed-too-soon one - and then of course the third ""stereotype"" - the passionate woman that everybody wants.That would be Julia Ormand. Julia falls for the youngest son first - played by Henry Thomas. When she shows up in Montana with him, the other 2 sons fall for her as well. She is lured by Pitt's manliness but dutifully restrains herself. In no time at all Thomas is running off to join in WWI, and his 2 brothers go along to protect him. Julie pleads with Pitt to protect her fiance. Unfortunately, Thomas dies rather quickly, and Pitt feels like it is his fault.So now you begin the real epicosity of the story. Aidan Quinn - the middle son - reveals his love for widow Julia. She rebuffs him, pining for Pitt. Pitt makes love to Julia and Quinn is jealous. Quinn takes off, Pitt hangs out for a while - long enough for Julia to become completely in love with him - then takes off for years and years. Julia pines and cries. Finally Julia gives in to Quinn rather than be alone. Then of course this is Pitt's cue to return and to take up with the now-barely-20 almost-a-sister. In a short period of time the new wife is killed because of Pitt's rum-running, Julia commits suicide rather than be away from him, and the remaining family (all men except the lone Indian woman) settles down again.I really love the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful actors - but I guess I just like ""realism"" too much to have fully appreciated the epic-cicity of this. Julia cries and cries and cries. She starts out as an intelligent, athletic woman who can handle horses - but ends up petulant and weak. No other female in the cast even has a chance. Quinn is great as the middle son who does his extreme best and is never respected for it, or given love. Thomas doesn't have much to work with in being the ""sweet innocent protected idealistic youngest son"" who is killed off in short order.Then there's Pitt. His main job is to look handsome and manly. He breaks wild horses. He wrangles the herd. He watches out for his younger brother. He fights with a bear. The women all adore him. He breaks down and sobs at his brother's death. This melts the heart of all female watchers :). A cowboy who can handle the rough mustangs! The soldier who can shoot straight! The man who can cry when he's sad! Plus the looks! He's set out to be a God.The ironic part is that Pitt mistreats the women he comes across - and yet because of the above qualities it's considered ""OK"" - just as when soap opera guys mistreat their women it's excused because ""well men will be men"". He hates his mom for leaving them even while his brothers accept it. He is fond of Julia - but once he has her firmly in love with him, he abandons her because he wants to be wild and free. He refuses to write to her, and when he finally does he is callous. When he comes back, he quickly climbs into the arms of the servant girl who has been pretty much a sister to him his whole life - something to me akin to a teacher agreeing to a student's embraces. He deliberately engages in risky gun-running which endangers his family, and she dies as a result. His treatment of Julia drives her to suicide. And yet somehow he emerges as the hero of the story.So while I really appreciated where this story was going, and that it was meant to be full of epicness, I didn't like much at all how it treated women - or native Americans. Both were used as extreme stereotypes. The gorgeous landscapes and gorgeous actors could have created an amazingly meaningful story - but what we got didn't quite measure up to that potential.",4,Deliberately a Beautiful Epic - but

Still, even in a work this short, there are depths that can't really be explored in a 2-hour movie, so if you liked the movie, I would strongly recommend you read the book.But I did enjoy the movie. I don't know if it's a great movie or not, but I found it oddly engrossing and with a very poignant ending. Of course, any movie with Anthony Hopkins in it is a plus, but I think the other brothers and actors did a fine job with their roles too, including Brad Pitt.In the book, Harrison has a direct but poetic style, and his male characters are well-drawn and believable.

And that's only the tip of the iceberg.Brad Pitt was too beautiful early in his career so people doubted his acting ability. Now Brad is forty years old, his face has more character, and no one doubts his acting ability. Maybe its old age or he's getting some acting lessons, whatever it is, it works.The Cinematography is amazing and reminded me of ""Lawrence Of Arabia.' The incomparable artistry and vision of David Lean is present in Edward Zwick's directing. The Academy Awards made a great choice giving `Legends of The Fall' an Oscar for Best Cinematography.In the end though I couldn't believe that Edward Zwick directed this film.He directed ""Glory"", the Great War epic that earned Denzel Washington an Academy Award.

The cinematography is captivating, the acting is superior and the story is engaging. On top of that, the chemistry among the actors was apparent. Anthony Hopkins plays the father (Col William Ludlow) and patriarch of the family whose ""city"" wife left him because she did not love the mountains and rustic living. She leaves him with his loyal companion (the indian narrator, One Stab) and three sons Alfred (Adian Quinn), Tristian (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas). The stage is set early on for an epic tale that has tragedy, betrayal, and love.Early on we find out that Tristian has the spirit of his father. He loves his brothers, the land and the indian people. He is a free spirit who even fights a bear early in life. Which is significant because this same bear (it is inferred) kills him years later.  So it is through One Stab's eyes and narrations, that we see the rest of the Ludlows Family life. We see Samuel return with a fiance' Susannah (Julia Ormond). We see the immediate attraction between her and the brothers. We find out that Tristian goes to war to protect and take care of Samuel. We see Tristian and Samuel go off to fight a war that their father opposes. We see Samuel die and Tristian return. We see how Tristian and Susannah appear to be attracted, but he leaves only to have Alfred marry her. We see her long for Tristian and the life that could have been. We see Tristian return to marry One Stab's daughter, Isabel and start a family. We see Susannah struggle with the realization that she can not have kids and wants the life that Isabel has. We see Isabel killed in a cruel twist of fate. We see Alfred realize how everything has a price even his happiness. We see Alfred survive his wife's suicide, only to realize how much family really means. And finally, we see how Tristian was always meant to be a kind spirit, with the Bear. He died as he lived, how he wanted.Although I have told you most of the movie, there is so much more. This, along with the Joy Luck Club, I love and highly recommend. Rent or purchase today.

Such people become crazy, or they become legends.""This is not a sappy chick flick whatsoever like the poster seems to indicate.  Its viewpoint is decidedly masculine.A family saga with many dimensions and profound themes. It's all anguished passion and unleashed emotion.Love, death, jealousy, revenge and redemption.The cinematography is stunning to behold.Filled with melodrama and tragedy, this sweeping  epic set in early 1900's Montana isat it's core a soap opera for guys,  a tremendously majestic journey both beautiful and brutal.Big sky country meets father/ son issues.A bold and masterfully bittersweet James Horner musical score, one of his most emotionally evocative,  wrenches all of your senses throughout. Its remarkably soulful theme will never leave you. Ever.There is no doubt that we are all splintered souls.Herein lies the haunting echoes of Cain and Abel and a brother's broken bond.And what exactly is behind a father favoring his wayward son?Warning: this motion picture may be too intense for sensitive children to be exposed to so send them to bed early. Depressed individuals beware.How quickly life passes us, almost unnoticed,  and how things taken for granted disappear before we even have a chance to glimpse their presence as they melt away.A strong Native American theme underscores this film,  hinting at our inner mystical voice.This movie is nothing less than a spellbinding feast for the soul.There's something very special here.Be prepared for unforgettable buttons to be pushed....and pushed...and pushed.This is truly a superb motion picture, a one of a kind experience that explores the dark side of the human condition. Surrender your emotions and let yourself be transported to an other time and an other place that will take you away to visit somewhere that's almost other worldly.Painful or not, happy or not, meant to be or not, destiny is rarely of our own choosing.Quote:Tristan: You know when Samuel died... I cursed God. Did I damn everybody around me as well as myself?Colonel Ludlow: No. You are not damned, Tristan...

In the past, whenever I had a collecter's version (with plenty of extras) versus say a DTS version (without the extras) I would choose the extras.  In movies such as Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan I chose the collectors versions.  I found over  time that I stop watching the extras and just watch the movies over and over.  SO, Legends of the Fall offers a great collector's version at half the price of the superbit version.  So, why get the superbit?  WEll, this is a BIG movie.  The crispness of the picture and sound are stunning.  I have over 50 DVDs and this one is right at the top with sound quality and picture quality.  The separation of the surround sound in the dts is fantastic.  A door opening, a dog howling in the distance, the battle sequence, the wind, and James Horner's music will be as clean and true as you can imagine.  The quality of John Toll's amazing cinematography is a visual jewel.  From the definition in the color of the faces to the divine imagery of the natural setting,  you won't be disappointed.  This film is as beautifully photographed as any I have ever seen.  Now, is it worth double the cost of the loaded collector's edition?  I don't know, but I bought the Superbit version and I couldn't be more pleased.  The Superbit offers none of the extras that are in the collector's edition, just a breathtaking version of a gorgeous film.  I kept finding myself thinking.. wow that's beautiful.

He represents the one faintly shimmering star that I have given this movie. That said, the rest of the film is exhausting.Of course, Brad Pitt is extremely hot. But how long can that distract you from the utter banality of this movie? The plot drags on for hours, interspersed with long, drawn out landscape shots of rolling pastures and mountains until you start asking yourself, &quot;What is this movie about, again?&quot;It's basically about Julia Ormond falling in love with 3 brothers (alternately, not simultaneously) in the wild, untamed western wilderness during WWI. Mix in a few sympathetic, if stereotypical, Native Americans, a lot of unrequited love, and some convoluted storytelling, and you've got Legends of the Fall. Almost everyone dies (at least once), and those who don't are left behind to woefully mourn their losses and realise, just a few seconds too late, &quot;what could have been&quot;.We're forced to watch the tragic affairs of Julia's love for each of the brothers in succession, as she loses them in various ways  (tragically, of course, and not always permanently), and all the time longing for Anthony Hopkins to come back on the screen.When Brad Pitt finally shows up again after a supposed 10-year-long absence, he falls in love with his almost-sister: a gorgeous, statuesque Native American girl who was a scrawny 10 years old last time we saw her (she dies later, of course). However, (OOOPS!) Brad Pitt (and EVERYBODY ELSE) looks EXACTLY THE SAME as they did 10 YEAR AGO! Well, except for Anthony Hopkins, who tragically has a stroke before Pitt returns and looks much older. But still. Come on, people. Lets keep some semblance of reality here.Of course, this is an epic in the truest sense of the word. But unlike &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, for example, it truly fails to deliver. Just when you begin to care about the characters, something so melodramatic, horrible, and implausable happens to them that you start writing them off, one by one, as hopeless causes.

163784,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800135954,Reviewer,"[83, 96]","According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness.  Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy.  They become legend.  And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  ""Legends of the Fall,"" directed by Edward Zwick, is the story of Tristan (Brad Pitt) and his brothers, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas); a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered, many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story, as well, for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), after his wife, Isabel (Christina Pickles), unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters, had left her family for the more civilized East Coast, never to return.Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) had served his country during the Indian Wars, after which, disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed, the proud people of the Indian Nations, he turned his back on the ""civilized"" ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there, on their ranch, that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian, under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three, only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it, and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced, and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow; a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.By 1914, Europe was at war, and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement, Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone, and enlist with him.  And in the desolate, muddy trenches of France, they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war-- just as their father had before them-- and by the time the war has ended for them, their lives have changed forever; Tristan's most especially.  Back home, Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch, but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go, and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery that eventually takes him, physically and emotionally, into places he never knew existed-- and away from the woman who loves him the most.Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set.  He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab, the one who saw it all unfold, first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen, and he realized it magnificently, aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography (for which he received an Oscar), Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling, dramatic score.  And most importantly, through the tremendous performances of Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond.Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard (Isabel Two), Paul Desmond (Decker), Tantoo Cardinal (Pet) and Robert Wisden (John T. O'Banion).  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, ""Legends of the Fall,"" perpetuates the tradition of classics like ""The Big Country"" and ""Giant.""

I didn't see Legends until it came onto Cable.If it had been marketed correctly I would have PAID to see it 10 times!Wow! Just about my favorite all-time movie! It starts a little slow, but builds such an emotional momentum that you're left drained at the end!Brad Pitt did an excellent job of acting. Cutting out your brother's heart so his spirit can get to heaven and feeling eternally guilt-ridden and self-destructive because he couldn't save the brother is a tough acting role. The photography is postcard beautiful all the way through and the music score has popped up everywhere because of its incredible beauty. The plot of this movie you can't guess; it goes places you never would expect, places that make you gasp with surprise.This is the way movies should be made, but alas, I think those days are  gone to be replaced by the immature comic book culture we have now.I bought the book hoping to read more about these fascinating character, but the book was a short story which was only basically an outline. What an incredible job the screenwriters did in fleshing out very psychologically intricate and complicated characters. Much better than the book could every aspire to! All of the actors were perfectly cast. Aidan Quinn as the control freak Alfred; I could see why Susanna blew her brains out after she came back from being finally spurned by Tristan only to get the 3rd degree by Alfred when she got home. Quinn did a great job depicting a man eaten by jealousy of his brother and suspicion of his wife.This is not a chick flick.

His wild ways and fierce love for his family have a ripple affect on the whole story. He has two brothers the responsible Alfred, and the awkward and naive Samuel engaged to a lovely, but weak Susannah. Though both Alfred and Samuel are just nuts about her, she truly yearns for Tristian.When Samuel dies, it changes everything. Alfred confesses his love, but she goes after Tristian. It's hard to pinpoint Tristian's feelings for Susannah. He's clearly attracted to her, but you get the sense that he's not IN love with her the way she is with him. Despite marrying her, he takes off to parts unknown to resolve his grief and restlessness, leaving Susannah abandoned. Though she still loves Tristian, (a point that she doesn't even try to hide) she marries Alfred, and tries to be content with him.When Tristian comes back, he learns of the changes, and oddly, doesn't seem to mind. He has regrets, sure, but one get's the feeling he's secretly relieved he's rid of Susannah. He's more interested in Isabel, the beautiful half indian girl who grew up loving him. Of course, Susannah still has feelings for our wild Tristian, which will lead to her downfall.This is not an epic, and it's certainly not legendary. Yet it is a moving tale of love both requited and unrequited, the strength and weaknesses of family, and the senseless tragedies life throws at us. Some things don't measure up, though.

Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Julia Ormand, Anthony Quinn, all fabulous in this. Each character gets their own story and each one just seems melancholy.

Edward Zwick is one of my favorite directors when it comes to drama and who can resist a cast that is so superb like the actors in this movie. So the canvas is really big and even when Zwick is painting in very broad strokes the film never let's you down and always delivers.,4,Hell of a fate,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,470,"['am', 'always', 'thinking', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'something', 'bad', 'previous', 'life', 'bad', 'karma', 'fate', 'so', 'many', 'tragedies', 'one', 'man', 'store', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'when', 'drama', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'cast', 'so', 'superb', 'actors', 'movie', 'canvas', 'really', 'big', 'even', 'when', 'Zwick', 'painting', 'very', 'broad', 'film', 'never', 'let', 'down', 'always', 'delivers']",N/A
