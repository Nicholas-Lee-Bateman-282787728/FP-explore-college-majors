912557,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0009U7LNK,Byron Kolln,"[5, 5]","This great version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST comes from the fondly-remembered Cannon MovieTales series.  Rebecca DeMornay and John Savage star in the lead roles, with lavish costumes and a delicate musical score.Beauty (Rebecca DeMornay), the youngest daughter of a widowed merchant, spends her days caring and tending to her lazy brothers and sisters.  When her father angers the mysterious occupant of a castle, Beauty selflessly offers to live with the hideous Beast (John Savage).  Every night, Beauty dreams of a handsome prince who begs her to find him...This version of the romantic fairytale takes it's cue from the classic 1946 French movie ""La Belle et la Bete"" (directed by Jean Cocteau) with it's lavish costumes and production design.  There are several lovely musical numbers--the main highlight being ""If You See with Your Heart"", a tender duet for the Beast and a homesick Beauty.The Cannon MovieTales series was filmed--rather economically--in Israel; you'll note that many of the films feature the same sets and costumes.  It's refreshing to see Rebecca DeMornay playing a naive innocent (years before producers began casting her as sexy psychopaths in films like ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"").Most of the Cannon MovieTales have found their way to DVD (the others include ""Hansel & Gretel"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Rumplestiltskin"", ""The Frog Prince"", ""Snow White"", and ""Red Riding Hood"").Children of the 80's rejoice!

None of the characters grow and neither do they seem to change as a result of what they go through. Beauty gets used to Beast but is convinced she has to find her Prince. She never really sees the Beast as the Prince or as her true love. From what I saw she agrees to marry Beast out of pity. Forget about the Beauty's family. Every one is self-centered and oblivious to the needs of those around them. Even her father is a lost cause --- all he cares about is the next rainbow and the next possible pot of gold. No wonder his children are rotten. Even Beast himself only sees Beauty as a means to end his curse. There is very little feeling much less love between any of the characters in this movie. I know B&B was originally a fairy tale concerning arranged marriages etc but it has come to be much more than that today. It's about seeing past appearances and first impressions, about finding the beauty inside even a beastly exterior.

912570,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0009U7LNK,Monty Moonlight,"[6, 6]","A beautiful girl who devotes all her time to caring for her wealthy family is the only one not troubled when their fortune is lost. When her father picks a rose from the garden of a mysterious beast's castle while traveling home from an unsuccessful journey, she decides to take his place as the beast's captive. The beast provides for Beauty anything her heart desires, but he also asks her, every night at the dinner table, if she loves him and will be his wife.Rebecca De Mornay stars as Beauty and John Savage as the beast in this wonderful film from the must-own Cannon Movie Tales series. If you love fairytales, this whole series of films is for you! These full-length, family features all have original songs and at least one recognizable star. The songs are often simple and forgettable, and the acting quality varies, but they are all highly entertaining nevertheless and made just right to be appreciated by all ages. I've never been smitten by Rebecca De Mornay, but I must say that in this early film of hers, she is rather breathtaking. John Savage is excellent as the beast, and the make-up effects, though a bit reminiscent of Teen Wolf at first, are rather good. These Cannon Movie Tales are not cheapy productions by any means. I own all that have been released so far, except for Rumpelstiltskin, which I have never seen in stores but is supposedly available here on Amazon. If you grew up watching these on the Disney Channel (back when it was the best channel on TV), you will definitely want these and will remember that there are two others that have not been released yet at all to DVD: Sleeping Beauty and The Frog Prince. Hey, MGM, what's the hold-up? Anyway, the others are: Puss in Boots (with Christopher Walken in a wonderful performance), Hansel and Gretel (one of the best ones), Snow White (also wonderful), Red Riding Hood (my personal favorite), and The Emperor's New Clothes (very funny). All are fullscreen, unfortunately, and each comes with its theatrical trailer.
