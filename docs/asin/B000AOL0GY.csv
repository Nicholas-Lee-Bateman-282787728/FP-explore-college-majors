930082,ADFJMD98M5HLM,B000AOL0GY,C. Andrews,"[2, 2]","Whipple Hoxworth, a sea captain like his grandfather, inherits what he takes to be a worthless plantation after he returns from a voyage to bring back Chinese immigrants.  He takes one of the Chinese as house cook, and his concubine that had been intended for the Hawaiian brothels.  After a driller finds water to make the plantation workable, Whip makes one last voyage to French Guiana in South America to steal enough pineapple seedlings to make the plantation realize it's potential.  After his 1/4 Royal Hawaiian wife Purity has a son, Noel, she goes native and returns to living on the coast away from Whip.Whip eventually takes a second Japanese wife from the next wave of immigrants, and allies himself with other business interests to bring down the last Hawaiian monarch who they deem too reactionary, and have the island seized as US Territory in 1893.  His son is involved with the torching of Chinatown in 1900 to curb the bubonic plague, and marries into the Chinese family dynasty begun by the two immigrants of his father's household.If you liked Hawaii, you will be interested in it's sequel.  There is no built in Intermission like that film, however.  The chapter breaks are random on these DVD-R discs.  If you want to break this 2 and 1/4 hour film up into two sessions, you may stop the action during chapter 9 a little more than 84 minutes in, after Whip has visited the Chinese couple on the Leper colony on Molokai to bring out their newborn daughter.  A significant amount of time passes after this point, as we see the children grown to teenagers.The nudity occurs at several points: a newly arrived woman leper has her top pulled off on the beach as she is assaulted; the Japanese workers have built a bath on Whip's plantation and he joins them; and the Chinese matriarch examines herself for signs of leprosy.  There is a delousing scene later in Chinatown, but they have covered themselves.",5,Sequel to Hawaii continues James Michener's epic story,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,1922,"['Whipple', 'Hoxworth', 'sea', 'captain', 'grandfather', 'what', 'be', 'worthless', 'plantation', 'voyage', 'bring', 'back', 'Chinese', 'immigrants', 'one', 'Chinese', 'house', 'cook', 'concubine', 'had', 'been', 'intended', 'Hawaiian', 'brothels', 'driller', 'water', 'make', 'plantation', 'workable', 'Whip', 'one', 'last', 'voyage', 'French', 'Guiana', 'South', 'America', 'steal', 'enough', 'pineapple', 'seedlings', 'make', 'plantation', 'realize', 'potential', '1/4', 'Royal', 'Hawaiian', 'wife', 'Purity', 'son', 'Noel', 'native', 'returns', 'living', 'coast', 'away', 'Whip.Whip', 'eventually', 'second', 'Japanese', 'wife', 'next', 'wave', 'immigrants', 'allies', 'other', 'business', 'interests', 'bring', 'down', 'last', 'Hawaiian', 'monarch', 'who', 'deem', 'too', 'reactionary', 'have', 'island', 'seized', 'US', 'Territory', '1893', 'son', 'involved', 'torching', 'Chinatown', '1900', 'curb', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'marries', 'Chinese', 'family', 'dynasty', 'begun', 'two', 'immigrants', 'father', 'household.If', 'liked', 'Hawaii', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'sequel', 'built', 'Intermission', 'film', 'however', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'are', 'random', 'DVD-R', 'discs', 'want', 'break', '2', '1/4', 'hour', 'film', 'up', 'two', 'sessions', 'may', 'stop', 'action', 'chapter', '9', 'little', 'more', '84', 'minutes', 'Whip', 'visited', 'Chinese', 'couple', 'Leper', 'colony', 'Molokai', 'bring', 'out', 'newborn', 'daughter', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'passes', 'point', 'see', 'children', 'grown', 'teenagers.The', 'nudity', 'several', 'points', 'newly', 'arrived', 'woman', 'leper', 'top', 'pulled', 'off', 'beach', 'assaulted', 'Japanese', 'workers', 'have', 'built', 'bath', 'Whip', 'plantation', 'Chinese', 'matriarch', 'examines', 'signs', 'leprosy', 'delousing', 'scene', 'later', 'Chinatown', 'have', 'covered']",The Hawaiians Region 2

I remember seeing this back in the 1970s and loving it. What neither of the other reviews I've read here mention is that it is primarily the story of two young Chinese who are brought to Hawaii to work on Charlton Heston's plantation. They are played (wonderfully) by Tina Chen and a very young Mako.  They eventually marry and have five sons. When Mako's character contracts leprosy and is sent to the leper colony on Molokai, his wife follows him there, stays with him and nurses him till he dies, then returns and begins (through clever investment, saving of every penny and a brilliant business sense) to build an empire of her own. When one of her sons responds to one of her suggestions with ""I'm sorry - That's impossible,"" she draws herself up and fiercely spits back ""Impossible come back from Molokai!"" (A genuine friendship gradually builds between this remarkable woman and Charlon Heston's character - based on mutual respect for each other's ambition and determination.)It's the third section of Mitchner's ""Hawaii"" book, which deals with ALL the cultures (Polynesian, New Englanders, Chinese and Japanese) who eventually created the ""Golden Men"" - the modern Hawaiians.",4,I want to see this movie again - In English!,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,1323,"['too', 'am', 'irritated', 'only', 'available', 'copies', 'Hawaiians', 'are', 'Spanish', 'format', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'played', 'American', 'machines', 'remember', 'seeing', 'back', '1970s', 'loving', 'What', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'mention', 'primarily', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'Chinese', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'Hawaii', 'work', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'plantation', 'are', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Tina', 'Chen', 'very', 'young', 'Mako', 'eventually', 'marry', 'have', 'five', 'sons', 'When', 'Mako', 'character', 'contracts', 'leprosy', 'sent', 'leper', 'colony', 'Molokai', 'wife', 'there', 'stays', 'till', 'then', 'returns', 'begins', 'clever', 'investment', 'saving', 'penny', 'brilliant', 'business', 'sense', 'build', 'empire', 'own', 'When', 'one', 'sons', 'one', 'suggestions', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'impossible', 'up', 'fiercely', 'back', 'Impossible', 'come', 'back', 'Molokai', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'gradually', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'Charlon', 'Heston', 'character', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'other', 'ambition', 'determination', 'third', 'section', 'Mitchner', 'Hawaii', 'book', 'cultures', 'Polynesian', 'New', 'Englanders', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'who', 'eventually', 'created', 'Golden', 'Men', 'modern', 'Hawaiians']",The Hawaiians Region 2
930090,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000AOL0GY,Kevin Killian,"[27, 28]","Isn't it crazy how you can only get this film on DVD from Spain, and with a Region 2 ratio slapped on it so that unless you've got a multi-region player you won't be able to view any of THE HAWAIIANS?  Well boys and girls, remember, this is the sequel to HAWAII, and you'll recall the trouble we had seeing that one in proper form for so many years, and if truth be told the correct roadshow version is still out of print, and the version on DVD is still the same old cut print pretty much, spruced up a little of course.In the case of THE HAWAIIANS, it is amusing to listen to this film with the Spanish track turned up.  The actors on screen are speaking a combination of languages, and certainly Charlton Heston and Geraldine Chaplin do not sound like they're from the same country, and by the way has anyone ever been able to figure out what country John Philip Law is from?  (I know it's some angelic space like Venus.)  Heston must have felt a sense of deja vu for his role, that of the autocratic owner of a pineapple plantation, is markedly similar to the part he played in the superior NAKED JUNGLE of 1954 with Eleanor Parker as the mail order bride, and an army of red killer ants besides. Heston is supposed to be playing the grandson of Richard Harris (in the first HAWAII), and Chaplin is sort of a princess type who intermarries with the Hoxworth clan and suffers a severe nervous breakdown when exposed to Heston's domineering ways.  You can tell a lot about a character when his name is ""WHIP""!The music is by Henry Mancini in his best THORN BIRDS mode with plenty of lush, melodic themes and a hint of native percussion.Whip goes head to head with the incredibly evil Alec McCowen.  If you like your Charlie Chan movies you will be thrilled to see Son #1 (Keye Luke) and Son #2 (the luscious Victor Sen Yung) both in the same picture!

930095,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000AOL0GY,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a good, honest historical drama about Hawaii in the end of XIX and the beginning of XX century. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.PRECISION: this is the review of the Region 1 NTSC uncut 132 minutes long version; watch THIS version rather than the edited Spanish one (especially if you like to see some naked Oriental beauties).Following the great success of &#34;Hawaii&#34; in 1966 (see my review of this one), it was only normal that an attempt would be made to adapt to the screen more of the monumental novel &#34;Hawaii&#34; by James Michener. It was finally done in 1970, but the final result, although quite a honest effort, was not as magnificent as the first film.The hero of what was supposedly the main story is Captain Whip Hoxworth (Charlton Heston), a tough and charismatic man, deprived of his inheritance by his sneaky jalous relatives. Ostracised and sidelined by his family, Hoxworth will work hard all his life on getting back at his enemies, not by harming them directly, but by becoming richer than them. It will not be an easy thing and his long and troubled marriage to part-native Hawaiian beauty Purity will not make the things easier for him neither. An absolutely splendid Oriental beauty, a Japanese girl named Fumiko (Miko Mayama) appears in this storyline in the second part of the film.What was supposedly a secondary plot describes a young Chinese girl Nyuk Tsin (Tina Chen), who was abducted from her village and sold to a brothel to Hawaii and another dirt poor young Chinese immigrant Mun Ki (Mako), who both meet in tragic circumstances on the ship which brings them to the islands.I will not say much more about the details of those two long storylines (they last easily 30 years), but for me quite soon the story of Nyuk Tsin and Mun Ki pushed aside and then COMPLETELY eclipsed what was in principle supposed to be the &#34;main&#34; topic, namely the Hoxworth family saga.I must confess with no little shame that until I saw this film Mako was for me only the funny little wizard Akiro from two Conan movies, as I completely missed his appearances in abominable turkeys like &#34;Robocop 3&#34; (yes, I am THE ONE GUY who actually watched that - I plead guilty to that too) and &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;. Well, shame on me, because it is immediately clear that he was quite an actor! I will have to re-watch &#34;The Sand Pebbles&#34; (I saw it AGES ago, like in lower paleolithic), because it seems he had his greatest role ever in that one...But it is Tina Chen, an actress I never heard before about, who is THE star of this film. From the moment she appears, this film is ALL about Nyuk Tsin. Tina Chen easily outstages Geraldine Chaplin, Mako, Charlton Heston himself and Miko Mayama's gorgeous breasts - hell, she even outstages the pineapples, and there is like a BILLION of darn things in this film! I really felt for her character during all this film and especially during the second half. Nyuk Tsin is amongst the most incredible female characters I ever saw on a screen, a woman who, if she was send to hell, would probably end up owning it and the only way to stop her from it would be to shoot her dead - providing you have enough bullets... And Tina Chen portrayed her perfectly.It is not everyday when you see a film in which Charlton Heston is cast as main star just to ultimately end up in supporting role, behind a previously almost completely unknown China girl...)))MEDICAL WARNING: if you are alergic to pineapples, watching this film can be critically dangerous to you.

So much of the film is carried by Chen and Mako, which was a remarkable step forward in Hollywood treatment of Asians. And Heston is top notch in a character that is both ruthless and charitable. I don't know about the historical accuracy of it, but the story is entertaining and engrossing throughout. If anything, I would say they could have made it even longer since it involves a couple of decades of events. As mentioned, it is two entwined storylines: the poor Chinese bride, Tina Chen, who becomes a revered matriarch, and Charlton Heston as a scorned plantation owner who rises to importance by boldness and audacity.

930103,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000AOL0GY,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","It may be Charlton Heston's name above the title, but no-one in The Hawaiians is under the illusion that the film belongs to anybody but Tina Chen as the Chinese immigrant sold into a brothel who works her way up from domestic service on seafarer Heston's plantation to becoming the matriarch of a business dynasty herself. Meanwhile Heston's having his own problems with the relatives in his family shipping empire, wife Geraldine Chaplin's growing madness and trying to find water to irrigate his own plantation of smuggled pineapples. It's the kind of sprawling saga that Hollywood was already forgetting how to make in 1970 and which, by the end of the decade, would be the sole preserve of a new breed of big-budget TV miniseries. That would probably have been the better way to go with this sequel to Hawaii, which continues the story a couple of generations later and tends to skip over momentous events in the characters' or the island's life with the likes of a sharp cut and a not-at-all-forced ""Well, it's been ten years since we've been annexed and Micah's now a piece of art."" This hop, skip and a jump approach to history doesn't do the film's last third any favours when the overthrow of the Hawaiian royalty is suddenly clumsily shoehorned into the plot in a couple of drawing room confrontations that fall a bit flat because all the important stuff has happened offscreen without any real buildup. And when racism is finally raised, it's simply Heston making an almost throwaway comment about being barred from polite society for taking a Japanese mistress rather than actually seeing it in action. At times the film's tendency to tell you what's happened between scenes makes it feel like theatre in the park.Since most of the characters are part native anyway racism isn't as big an issue as you might expect, despite focussing on the Chinese immigrants (the native Hawaiians barely feature in the film at all), but the film has bigger problems. Director Tom Gries really doesn't have the epic touch - the final outbreak of plague and destruction of the city slums is hardly the burning of Atlanta - but at least in Chen it has a heroine who could make Scarlett O'Hara look unambitious, following her man to the leper colony on Molokai (where, unfortunately, some of the leper makeup looks a bit too much like the extras have been having a food fight with oatmeal) and forging an empire for his children on her return. The end result is watchable but superficial soap opera that needs a few more charismatic characters to back up Chen and a better screenplay than The Big Country and Vera Cruz screenwriter James R. Webb provides to be more than a passing diversion. Still, it does have a terrific Henry Mancini score to at least ensure it sounds good.While the Spanish DVD release was cut for local censorship reasons, MGM's US manufactured on demand DVD-R release offers a decent but with much room for improvement 2.35:1 widescreen transfer of the uncut version with a very tatty copy of the film's trailer included as the only extra.",3,Lacks the epic touch but has a heroine to rival Scarlett O'Hara in Tina Chen,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3056,"['may', 'be', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'name', 'title', 'no-one', 'Hawaiians', 'illusion', 'film', 'belongs', 'anybody', 'Tina', 'Chen', 'Chinese', 'immigrant', 'sold', 'brothel', 'who', 'way', 'domestic', 'service', 'seafarer', 'Heston', 'plantation', 'becoming', 'matriarch', 'business', 'dynasty', 'Meanwhile', 'Heston', 'having', 'own', 'problems', 'relatives', 'family', 'shipping', 'empire', 'wife', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'growing', 'madness', 'trying', 'find', 'water', 'irrigate', 'own', 'plantation', 'smuggled', 'pineapples', 'kind', 'sprawling', 'saga', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'already', 'forgetting', 'how', 'make', '1970', 'end', 'decade', 'would', 'be', 'sole', 'preserve', 'new', 'breed', 'big-budget', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'sequel', 'Hawaii', 'story', 'couple', 'generations', 'later', 'skip', 'over', 'momentous', 'events', 'characters', 'island', 'life', 'likes', 'sharp', 'cut', 'not-at-all-forced', 'Well', 'been', 'ten', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'annexed', 'Micah', 'now', 'piece', 'art', 'hop', 'skip', 'jump', 'approach', 'history', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'last', 'third', 'favours', 'when', 'overthrow', 'Hawaiian', 'royalty', 'suddenly', 'clumsily', 'shoehorned', 'plot', 'couple', 'drawing', 'room', 'confrontations', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'important', 'stuff', 'happened', 'offscreen', 'real', 'buildup', 'when', 'racism', 'finally', 'raised', 'simply', 'Heston', 'making', 'almost', 'throwaway', 'comment', 'being', 'barred', 'polite', 'society', 'taking', 'Japanese', 'mistress', 'rather', 'actually', 'seeing', 'action', 'times', 'film', 'tendency', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'scenes', 'feel', 'theatre', 'park.Since', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'native', 'anyway', 'racism', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'issue', 'might', 'expect', 'focussing', 'Chinese', 'immigrants', 'native', 'Hawaiians', 'barely', 'feature', 'film', 'film', 'bigger', 'problems', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'epic', 'touch', 'final', 'outbreak', 'plague', 'destruction', 'city', 'slums', 'hardly', 'burning', 'Atlanta', 'least', 'Chen', 'heroine', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'look', 'unambitious', 'following', 'man', 'leper', 'colony', 'Molokai', 'where', 'unfortunately', 'leper', 'makeup', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'food', 'fight', 'oatmeal', 'forging', 'empire', 'children', 'return', 'end', 'result', 'watchable', 'superficial', 'soap', 'opera', 'few', 'more', 'charismatic', 'characters', 'back', 'up', 'Chen', 'better', 'screenplay', 'Big', 'Country', 'Vera', 'Cruz', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'R.', 'Webb', 'be', 'more', 'passing', 'diversion', 'Still', 'have', 'terrific', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'score', 'least', 'ensure', 'good.While', 'Spanish', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'cut', 'local', 'censorship', 'reasons', 'MGM', 'US', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'DVD-R', 'release', 'decent', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'uncut', 'version', 'very', 'tatty', 'copy', 'film', 'trailer', 'included', 'only', 'extra']",The Hawaiians Region 2
