29951,A1XSW26YGZB1X6,0780620135,Amazon Customer,"[10, 10]","This series was first broadcast on PBS in 1997 as an astonishing ""bring it to life"" narrative of the years leading up to the American Revolution, the scope of the war itself, and the drafting of the Constitution.  Each of the six segments (an hour each) dissects not so much a specific point in time as a prevailing attitude.  A long list of actors brings color and liveliness to not only the familiar names such as Franklin, Jefferson, John and Abigail Adams, and Patrick Henry, but also some of the lesser-known names such as General Howe, General Burgoyne, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Benjamin Rush.  One of the best performances is delivered by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Joseph Plumb Martin of Connecticut -a soldier from Connecticut who enlists at the age of 16 and serves in Washington's Continental Army for most of the war.  Martin's diary is a wonderful source for understanding the lives of Continental soldiers and provides much of the ""average American"" viewpoint during the conflict, although he turns up again in episode six, returned to civilian life and grappling with the reality of the new Constitution-based government.  Familiar and not-so-familiar period portraiture helps to flesh out sequences that don't actually feature actors or dramatizations, and interviews with prominent historians and other scholars round out the drama and anchor the viewer with a bit of perspective.  The sidelights come in from all across the spectrum: opinions of British regulars are given as much voice as the American colonists, slaves and indentured servants deliver a number of rebukes, Southern aristocrats decry the vile customs of their neighbors to the north, and the Federalist-versus-Antifederalist argument is dramatized with an intensity no junior high school history class seems to have ever been able to manage.  These and other well-timed juxtapositions drive home the reality that the Americans were far from united on the subject of independence, just as members of Parliament were far from united on the subject of what to do about their upstart colonies.  The series is loaded up with generous helpings of what this reviewer calls GINKT moments (Gee I Never Knew That).  GINKTs are undoubtedly one of the most effective tools in retaining audience interest and sparking discussion.

It covers well known events and some not so well known events.  This presentation takes you beyond high school romantic history with heroes and heroic deeds that rival the Iliad. We can see some of the underlying motives and accidents that brought about our revolution. We are carried to the very edge of the creation of the Declaration of independents, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.The film is presented by major historians (I have to admit I never saw one or two of them before) but I do have a copy of ""The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution of the United States"" with an Introduction by Pauline Maier and it was interesting to see her as a presenter in this series. There are great deals of actors that quote actual letters and statements from historical figures; it almost becomes a game on the side trying to guess where you saw the actor before.We get maps and diagrams to help follow the action. But it is the actual view of the country side that can be so beautiful that it can take your breath away.There is a companion book to this presentation and it goes into more depth.

So, here I am years later and I decided to give it a second try. I am glad that I did.Liberty! is much better than I remembered. It is not as good as the book but it the best documentary on the American Revolution I have seen. It is as thorough as one can be in the limited time that this format will allow.As for the actor thing - this time around I really liked it. The actors are really good and the story is paced very well. The build up to the revolution is logical and shows how the logic of both the British and the American positions and how those positions led to the Revolution.Liberty! does a good job of going back and forth from the political to the military action in the actual war.

29960,A2VE83MZF98ITY,0780620135,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[10, 10]","'Liberty! The American Revolution' is a wonderful PBS series, a six-part treatment of the period leading up to and including the American Revolution in the mid-to-late 1700s.As this series shows, the seeds of the American Revolution were planted long before the actual conflicts began. This was not an overnight decision on the part ofthe colonists or the British; intense negotiations and political attempts were made for years prior to the outbreak of hostilities. The colonists largely came from Britain; the leadership certainly looked to Britain for political, moral and cultural guidance, as well as primary trade and security vis-a-vis the Spanish, the French, and the Native Americans. American leaders were, by and large, British leaders too -- George Washington held a commission and fought with the British in the French and Indian War.This was a family break-up in many ways -- the series' astute use of the actual words of the people of the time show the emotions that conflict, the love-hate relationship both sides embodied. The first episode shows the beginnings of discontent on both sides, with the colonists beginning to be stressed over being ignored by the British leadership, and the British leadership, in the form of George III, newly ascended to the throne, and various high-powered ministers, feeling that the colonists were rather ungrateful toward their (so-they-considered-themselves-to-be) rightful lords.Liberty, ironically, was what George III and his first minister, William Pitt, were all about. The Seven-Years War was won as a fight for liberty; the colonies in America and elsewhere were won over to Britain, who had a parliamentary democracy (however poorly enacted) as opposed to absolute monarchy (such as in France). So, the break-up between Britain and the American colonies becomes all the more troublesome -- not only were the opposing sides practically family, but largely believed the same things.The series never makes the direct comparison, but one can get the sense of Jonathan Swift here, that the battles are fought over relatively minor things (like which side of the egg to crack) -- in the scheme of world politics then and now, the controversies were relatively slight. However, the issues of taxation, governance and respect were important, not perhaps so much for what they were, but for what they did portend as future treatment, and the colonists did not like being second-class citizens in a British-dominated world, even if, to the British leadership, being second-class British was better than being almost anything else. There was also the spectre of the Irish tyranny, perpetrated by the English, that loomed large as a possibility. Sadly, one cannot say that these fears were unjustified.The series is intriguing, introducing sides to the conflict that one doesn't recall from grade-school and high-school civics classes -- the conflicts among the colonies themselves; the dissent among the colonies who often wanted a repair rather than a break with Britain; and the personal reflections and fears of the founding fathers and mothers (yes, there were many women involved in this process). Using diaries, correspondence, official documents and media reports of the time, the show weaves together a narrative history that achieves a good popular balance between historical detail and narrative reporting.The writers' admiration for the founding Americans, their bravery and their intelligence, is very apparent. Their concern to present the British in a fair and balanced light is also apparent, and often portrayed as trying to be reasonable and responsive to many of the colonial concerns, if not always pleasant and courteous to the colonial leaders themselves. The writing is interesting and thoughtful, and done in a popular tone that gives personality to the people who figure in the events.The final episode looks at the aftermath of the war, and the struggle for unity as a nation. George Washington's statement that liberty could be both a blessing and curse was taken to heart -- when the Constitutional Convention met to amend the Articles of Confederation, it went far beyond its original mandate, and it was telling that not all colonies sent representatives, and not all that were sent agreed to stay through the proceedings.A great series in many ways, it makes a great gift for anyone (or to oneself) with an interest in history.  It also has a companion volume available, which works both as a stand-alone volume or as a supplement.",5,Give me liberty!,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,4513,"[""'Liberty"", 'American', 'Revolution', 'wonderful', 'PBS', 'series', 'six-part', 'treatment', 'period', 'leading', 'up', 'including', 'American', 'Revolution', 'mid-to-late', '1700s.As', 'series', 'seeds', 'American', 'Revolution', 'were', 'planted', 'long', 'actual', 'conflicts', 'began', 'was', 'not', 'overnight', 'decision', 'part', 'ofthe', 'colonists', 'British', 'intense', 'negotiations', 'political', 'attempts', 'were', 'made', 'years', 'prior', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'colonists', 'largely', 'came', 'Britain', 'leadership', 'certainly', 'looked', 'Britain', 'political', 'moral', 'cultural', 'guidance', 'as', 'well', 'primary', 'trade', 'security', 'vis-a-vis', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Native', 'Americans', 'American', 'leaders', 'were', 'large', 'British', 'leaders', 'too', 'George', 'Washington', 'held', 'commission', 'fought', 'British', 'French', 'Indian', 'War.This', 'was', 'family', 'break-up', 'many', 'ways', 'series', 'astute', 'use', 'actual', 'words', 'people', 'time', 'show', 'emotions', 'conflict', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'sides', 'embodied', 'first', 'episode', 'beginnings', 'discontent', 'sides', 'colonists', 'beginning', 'be', 'stressed', 'being', 'ignored', 'British', 'leadership', 'British', 'leadership', 'form', 'George', 'III', 'newly', 'ascended', 'throne', 'various', 'high-powered', 'ministers', 'feeling', 'colonists', 'were', 'rather', 'ungrateful', 'so-they-considered-themselves-to-be', 'rightful', 'lords.Liberty', 'ironically', 'was', 'what', 'George', 'III', 'first', 'minister', 'William', 'Pitt', 'were', 'Seven-Years', 'War', 'was', 'won', 'fight', 'liberty', 'colonies', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'were', 'won', 'Britain', 'who', 'had', 'parliamentary', 'democracy', 'however', 'poorly', 'enacted', 'opposed', 'absolute', 'monarchy', 'such', 'France', 'So', 'break-up', 'Britain', 'American', 'colonies', 'more', 'troublesome', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'opposing', 'sides', 'practically', 'family', 'largely', 'believed', 'same', 'things.The', 'series', 'never', 'direct', 'comparison', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'sense', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'here', 'battles', 'are', 'fought', 'relatively', 'minor', 'things', 'side', 'egg', 'crack', 'scheme', 'world', 'politics', 'then', 'now', 'controversies', 'were', 'relatively', 'slight', 'However', 'issues', 'taxation', 'governance', 'respect', 'were', 'important', 'not', 'perhaps', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'were', 'what', 'did', 'portend', 'future', 'treatment', 'colonists', 'did', 'not', 'being', 'second-class', 'citizens', 'British-dominated', 'world', 'even', 'British', 'leadership', 'being', 'second-class', 'British', 'was', 'better', 'being', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'also', 'spectre', 'Irish', 'tyranny', 'perpetrated', 'English', 'loomed', 'large', 'possibility', 'Sadly', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'fears', 'were', 'unjustified.The', 'series', 'intriguing', 'introducing', 'sides', 'conflict', 'one', ""n't"", 'recall', 'grade-school', 'high-school', 'civics', 'classes', 'conflicts', 'colonies', 'dissent', 'colonies', 'who', 'often', 'wanted', 'repair', 'rather', 'break', 'Britain', 'personal', 'reflections', 'fears', 'founding', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'yes', 'were', 'many', 'women', 'involved', 'process', 'Using', 'diaries', 'correspondence', 'official', 'documents', 'media', 'reports', 'time', 'show', 'together', 'narrative', 'history', 'good', 'popular', 'balance', 'historical', 'detail', 'narrative', 'reporting.The', 'writers', 'admiration', 'founding', 'Americans', 'bravery', 'intelligence', 'very', 'apparent', 'concern', 'present', 'British', 'fair', 'balanced', 'light', 'also', 'apparent', 'often', 'portrayed', 'trying', 'be', 'reasonable', 'responsive', 'many', 'colonial', 'concerns', 'not', 'always', 'pleasant', 'courteous', 'colonial', 'leaders', 'writing', 'interesting', 'thoughtful', 'done', 'popular', 'tone', 'personality', 'people', 'who', 'figure', 'events.The', 'final', 'episode', 'aftermath', 'war', 'struggle', 'unity', 'nation', 'George', 'Washington', 'statement', 'liberty', 'could', 'be', 'blessing', 'curse', 'was', 'taken', 'heart', 'when', 'Constitutional', 'Convention', 'met', 'amend', 'Articles', 'Confederation', 'went', 'far', 'original', 'mandate', 'was', 'telling', 'not', 'colonies', 'sent', 'representatives', 'not', 'were', 'sent', 'agreed', 'stay', 'proceedings.A', 'great', 'series', 'many', 'ways', 'great', 'gift', 'anyone', 'interest', 'history', 'also', 'companion', 'volume', 'available', 'stand-alone', 'volume', 'supplement']",N/A

Important characters and their influence are well depicted. The best part may be the words in this film since they are quoted really from the speaking and diary in that time.Although the Americans didn't win many battles during the time, the battles they won seem to be decisive. Winning the battle at Saratoga brings the French support. Winning the siege of Yorktown with the French Navy triumphs the revolution, unofficially. Winning the independence, however, doesn't mean forming a nation. There is debate about this for being afraid of taxation. After many efforts persuading people from their fear to form a powerful government, a nation is finally born.The content from winning the war to form the union seems rush.

Higdon ""Heart of Texas""","[58, 78]","I have not read all of the reviews offered on Amazon, however, prior to purchasing this item (locally) I did read several reviews and was struck by the intelligent, reflective responses I did read.  Overall the program does put forth a very informative and good understanding of what led the British colonists into revolt and what compelled men and women of the time to consider such an extraordinary action that led to the establishment of the greatest nation on earth and to date what has come to be the greatest nation and form of government that has been since time began and the nation-state has developed.  However, if you have read many of the books of the time the program takes great liberties with several things: what is offered as verbatim dialogue of our founding fathers, and discussions of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence that are presented as factual. Additionally the program does not give adequate time to show just how tenuous the founding of our Republic was, and how many, many people living in America during this time just did not want to declare independence from England.  Additionally it fails to adequately develop and provide the viewer with a good appreciation of the magnitude of suffering that was experienced by the American Patriots.I have read several historical documents relating to the American revolution and many Pulitzer Prize winning books by authors such as Douglas Southall Freeman and his 7 volume (the 7th was finished by other authors after his death) compendium on George Washington, Dumas Malone's 6 volumes on Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Flagg Bemis's 2 volume set on John Quincy Adams, and David McCollough's John Adams and most recently 1776, Joseph Ellis's book Founding Brothers, and numerous more on Franklin and other founding fathers.  In each and every one of these books the authors do not fail to mention the undisputed fact that the overwhelming majority of the founding fathers (excluding Jefferson and Franklin) were deeply convicted in their faith in the Christian Lord Jesus and how that faith permeated their thought life and how that faith compellled the founding fathers and their wives to act on a daily basis.  In a particularly irritating scene at the end of Part II, Blows Must Decide, the actor portraying John Adams, recounts a very famous and historic prophetic utterance given by Adams on the evening of July 2, 1776 in a letter to his wife Abigail - in the PBS version they blatanly omit a key part of a sentence in the retelling of this event.  In fact Adams states: ""The 2nd day of July 1776 will be the most memorable epocha in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the Day of Deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations form one end of this continent to the other form this time forward forever more.""  The PBS version quotes everything verbatim, yet, leaves out ""by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty"".  This is an appalling omission.  Additionally in this same segment it does not allow for historical documentation that indicates there is no clear and convincing accounts that Jefferson indeed was deferred to by John Adams in writing the Declaration - in fact his three point discussion to Jefferson MAY have happened, yet Jefferson himself disputes it ever did.The subject matter is one of the most well documented events in history and by which the facts can easily be substantiated. However, it appears their team of researchers wanted to ""slant"" the program in some ill-conceived manner - and for what purposes leaves me quite befuddled. I can only assume their reasoning for such ommissions are due to their ""Public Broadcasting"" political correctness slant - perhaps if they mention any element of the Fouding Fathers faith, such would result in a lack of funding. As such if the events and dialogues contained all of the facts of the day - this would be a program worthy of educators to present to the youth of today. Unfortunately, glaring ommissions of fact do not permit me to grant this program more than 2 stars.",2,Re-writing history one line at a time,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,4216,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'however', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'item', 'locally', 'did', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'was', 'struck', 'intelligent', 'reflective', 'responses', 'did', 'read', 'Overall', 'program', 'put', 'forth', 'very', 'informative', 'good', 'understanding', 'what', 'led', 'British', 'colonists', 'revolt', 'what', 'compelled', 'men', 'women', 'time', 'consider', 'extraordinary', 'action', 'led', 'establishment', 'greatest', 'nation', 'earth', 'date', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'greatest', 'nation', 'form', 'government', 'been', 'time', 'began', 'nation-state', 'developed', 'However', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'time', 'program', 'great', 'liberties', 'several', 'things', 'what', 'offered', 'verbatim', 'dialogue', 'founding', 'fathers', 'discussions', 'drafting', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'are', 'presented', 'factual', 'Additionally', 'program', 'not', 'give', 'adequate', 'time', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'tenuous', 'founding', 'Republic', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'living', 'America', 'time', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'declare', 'independence', 'England', 'Additionally', 'adequately', 'develop', 'provide', 'viewer', 'good', 'appreciation', 'magnitude', 'suffering', 'was', 'experienced', 'American', 'Patriots.I', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'historical', 'documents', 'relating', 'American', 'revolution', 'many', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'books', 'authors', 'such', 'Douglas', 'Southall', 'Freeman', '7', 'volume', '7th', 'was', 'finished', 'other', 'authors', 'death', 'compendium', 'George', 'Washington', 'Dumas', 'Malone', '6', 'volumes', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Samuel', 'Flagg', 'Bemis', '2', 'volume', 'set', 'John', 'Quincy', 'Adams', 'David', 'McCollough', 'John', 'Adams', 'most', 'recently', '1776', 'Joseph', 'Ellis', 'book', 'Founding', 'Brothers', 'numerous', 'more', 'Franklin', 'other', 'founding', 'fathers', 'one', 'books', 'authors', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'mention', 'undisputed', 'fact', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'founding', 'fathers', 'excluding', 'Jefferson', 'Franklin', 'were', 'deeply', 'convicted', 'faith', 'Christian', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'how', 'faith', 'permeated', 'thought', 'life', 'how', 'compellled', 'founding', 'fathers', 'wives', 'act', 'daily', 'basis', 'particularly', 'irritating', 'scene', 'end', 'Part', 'II', 'Blows', 'Must', 'Decide', 'actor', 'portraying', 'John', 'Adams', 'very', 'famous', 'historic', 'prophetic', 'utterance', 'given', 'Adams', 'evening', 'July', '2', '1776', 'letter', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'PBS', 'version', 'blatanly', 'omit', 'key', 'part', 'sentence', 'retelling', 'event', 'fact', 'Adams', '2nd', 'day', 'July', '1776', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'epocha', 'history', 'America', 'am', 'apt', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'celebrated', 'succeeding', 'generations', 'Day', 'Deliverance', 'solemn', 'acts', 'devotion', 'God', 'Almighty', 'ought', 'be', 'solemnized', 'pomp', 'parade', 'shows', 'games', 'sports', 'guns', 'bells', 'bonfires', 'illuminations', 'form', 'one', 'end', 'continent', 'other', 'form', 'time', 'forward', 'forever', 'more', 'PBS', 'version', 'everything', 'verbatim', 'yet', 'out', 'solemn', 'acts', 'devotion', 'God', 'Almighty', 'appalling', 'omission', 'Additionally', 'same', 'segment', 'not', 'allow', 'historical', 'documentation', 'clear', 'convincing', 'accounts', 'Jefferson', 'indeed', 'was', 'deferred', 'John', 'Adams', 'writing', 'Declaration', 'fact', 'three', 'point', 'discussion', 'Jefferson', 'MAY', 'have', 'happened', 'yet', 'Jefferson', 'ever', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'documented', 'events', 'history', 'facts', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'substantiated', 'However', 'team', 'researchers', 'wanted', 'slant', 'program', 'ill-conceived', 'manner', 'what', 'quite', 'befuddled', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'reasoning', 'such', 'ommissions', 'are', 'due', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'political', 'correctness', 'slant', 'perhaps', 'mention', 'element', 'Fouding', 'Fathers', 'faith', 'such', 'would', 'result', 'lack', 'funding', 'such', 'events', 'dialogues', 'contained', 'facts', 'day', 'would', 'be', 'program', 'worthy', 'educators', 'present', 'youth', 'today', 'Unfortunately', 'glaring', 'ommissions', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'permit', 'grant', 'program', 'more', '2', 'stars']",N/A

Others have faulted it for being militarily incomplete, but this is its principle strength, in my view.  Far too often, history is comprised of the accounts of battles.  Here, though, the producers chose to focus on the dream of liberty more than its attainment.  To be sure, important battles get their due, but the emphasis here is on a war won more through propaganda and promises than by musket and steel.The producers are out to tell a story as much as the truth, and so know they have to start at the beginning.  Many accounts of the times seem to skip glibly over the predominant happiness with British rule that most colonists felt, but not LIBERTY!  Instead, it goes to great lengths to put viewers back in colonial America, so they can understand how improbable it was that the people of the time would've imagined themselves divorced from England.  Unlike many accounts, LIBERTY! Is unafraid to take the opposing British viewpoint, and to include British historians.  This documentary, indeed, sees the arguments from all sides, and shows just how reluctance turned to resolve.  More to the point, it shows both sides as equally hotheaded and responsible for the war.Indeed, the commitment to explain the conflict in human terms is so prevalent in this work, that actors hired to play various key figures propel the basic storyline as much as the narrator.  Best of all, every word these actors speak comes from a documented primary source.  Choosing to have the figures themselves partially tell the story adds great personal interest while moving the drama of the larger conflict swiftly along.  Particularly noteworthy is the emphasis on the John and Abagail Adams relationship, which was fortunately well documented by their own letter writing.  Their correspondence is one of the great diaries of the time, and lends much to an understanding of the decisions made.
