581538,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005BJX6,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 9/04, 11/08Rate: 311/08: Cops and Robbersons is supposed to be a funny movie because Chevy Chase is in it. Weirdly, the more movies of Chevy Chase I see lately, the less funny he is. Anyway, back to Cops and Robbersons which is a nice title, the movie is five percent funny but ninety-five percent stupid. Not just stupid stupid, but just stupid. Chevy Chase tries to be funny by acting like an idiot which didn't work for me. Jack Palance ironically keeps the film running because I was waiting for something good from him, but it never did happen. The plot of the movie is tired and oft used, and the most incredible thing about Cops and Robbersons is its incomplete subplots. Obviously, Chevy Chase's character had longed to be a cop, but we audience never get to know why he didn't become one. Then, I had hoped that Jack Palance's character would tell him the hard cold facts of what it is like being a cop but never did. The family shows problems of its own as it couldn't be a family together. So, the why of it never materialized. In short, the film has no depth in anything. As far as comedy goes, there isn't much to say. At least I remember the best about Cops and Robbersons is when Jack Palance says, ""I don't mow lawns,"" and a couple more of ""I don't..."" lines. I liked Dianne Wiest in the movie, and she has a very pleasant presence that I enjoy very much. All in all, Cops and Robbersons is probably best summarized as a blank stare. Well, it's your lucky day Michael Ritchie because I am brining the rating up for Cops and Robbersons from `2' to `3'.",2,Chevy Chase's Career Died in That Film.,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1575,"['Viewed', '9/04', '11/08Rate', '311/08', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'movie', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Weirdly', 'more', 'movies', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'see', 'lately', 'less', 'funny', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', 'nice', 'title', 'movie', 'five', 'percent', 'funny', 'ninety-five', 'percent', 'stupid', 'Not', 'just', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'just', 'stupid', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'be', 'funny', 'acting', 'idiot', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'ironically', 'film', 'running', 'was', 'waiting', 'something', 'good', 'never', 'did', 'happen', 'plot', 'movie', 'tired', 'used', 'most', 'incredible', 'thing', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', 'incomplete', 'subplots', 'Obviously', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'character', 'had', 'longed', 'be', 'cop', 'audience', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'one', 'Then', 'had', 'hoped', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'character', 'would', 'tell', 'hard', 'cold', 'facts', 'what', 'being', 'cop', 'never', 'did', 'family', 'problems', 'own', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'family', 'together', 'So', 'why', 'never', 'materialized', 'short', 'film', 'depth', 'anything', 'As', 'far', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'least', 'remember', 'best', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', 'when', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'do', ""n't"", 'mow', 'lawns', 'couple', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'lines', 'liked', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'movie', 'very', 'pleasant', 'presence', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', 'probably', 'best', 'summarized', 'blank', 'stare', 'Well', 'lucky', 'day', 'Michael', 'Ritchie', 'am', 'brining', 'rating', 'up', 'Cops', 'Robbersons', '2', '3']",N/A
581539,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,B00005BJX6,Brett Johnson,"[5, 10]","""Cops & Robbersons"" strongly reminds me of a Griswold Vacation movie.  In fact, I kept expecting Chevy to call his kids Rusty and Audrey.  The only difference is that the family in this film don't get to go anywhere.  They are stuck at home with a couple of cops as live-in visitors.  The police are doing surveillance on a criminal who lives in the house across the street.Chevy is up to his old ""Boy, am I a clueless ... or what?"" routine.  What's extremely frustrating is the fact that nobody around him gives it any thought.  Look at these two examples:  First, he hides the two cops in the closet (don't ask!) and his wife comes downstairs.  She asks what the noise is coming from the closet.  He states that it is the cat.  Then the daughter comes down the stairs holding the cat.  What does his wife think about that?  Nothing.  Another example is when Chevy asks his neighbor (who is under surveillance) if he could use his bathroom.  While his neighbor is on the phone, Chevy sneaks upstairs and cuts open the guy's mattress to the point that springs are actually popping out.  What does his neighbor think of this?  Nothing!I think you get the idea.  The people in this film are so completely ignorant that the comedy falls flat.  To make it worse, Jack Palance is downright vicious.  I was absolutely stunned at something he stated to one of Chevy's kids.  This is supposed to be a family movie.  I can't tell you what he said because it violates Amazon's review guidelines against obscenity.The only reason that this film gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the presence of Dianne Wiest.  She appears as if she is in a film all her own.  She is caring, charming and feisty all at once.  However, I would only recommend this movie for diehard Wiest fans or for people who enjoy watching Chevy Chase act really dumb for 90 minutes.",2,It's Chevy Chase.
