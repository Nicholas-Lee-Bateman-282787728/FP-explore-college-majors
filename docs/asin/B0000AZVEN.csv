If both religion and work set you free, then is work the same as religion, and vice versa? Arbeit macht frei.But this isn't Auschwitz and National Socialism during the Second World War. This is Ireland and Catholicism in the 1960s.The film follows three young women who've been carted off to be incarcerated in a workhouse for 'fallen' women that's run by nuns, where they are expected to expiate their sins by toiling in the Magdalene laundry. Their sins? Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) has 'shamed' her family by being raped by her cousin. Bernadette's (Nora-Jane Noone) good looks were deemed a bad influence to the younger girls and an unacceptable temptation to the local boys at the orphanage where she was brought up. Rose (Dorothy Duffy) has just given birth out of wedlock. For that, they're condemned to working seven days a week washing the dirty linen of local businesses and institutions even while the nuns sit and count the money rolling in. Talking is disallowed. Friendships are forbidden. Beatings are commonplace.The girls react in different ways: Bernadette is determined to escape and is brutally punished by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) while Rose and Margaret seem to accept their fate after another girl escapes, only to be returned and beaten by her father. After several years, in different ways, all three manage to escape and regain their freedom.Church-bashing might be du jour, but this isn't mudslinging &agrave; la Michael Moore. Even through the lens of (relative) objectivity, the nuns' ignorance of their hypocrisy is astounding, as was the Church's and society's tacit approval. The most chilling thing of all isn't that the events in the film really happened it's that the last Magdalene Laundry didn't close until 1996.Film, as a medium, has always been primarily about entertainment. Sure, when the Lumi&egrave;re brothers shot onto film moving images of a train leaving the Ciotat they were creating history as well as recording for posterity, but their main goal when they showed it to contemporary audiences was to dazzle and entertain.Films are rarely truly important but The Magdalene Sisters is.",5,This should be required viewing in religious studies classes,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2259,"['Drab', 'identical', 'uniforms', 'Unpaid', 'enslaved', 'labour', 'Unquestioned', 'authority', 'Unquestioning', 'obedience', 'Loss', 'identity', 'religion', 'work', 'set', 'free', 'then', 'work', 'same', 'religion', 'vice', 'versa', 'Arbeit', 'macht', 'frei.But', ""n't"", 'Auschwitz', 'National', 'Socialism', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Ireland', 'Catholicism', '1960s.The', 'film', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'carted', 'off', 'be', 'incarcerated', 'workhouse', ""'fallen"", 'women', 'run', 'nuns', 'where', 'are', 'expected', 'expiate', 'sins', 'toiling', 'Magdalene', 'laundry', 'sins', 'Margaret', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', ""'shamed"", 'family', 'being', 'raped', 'cousin', 'Bernadette', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'good', 'looks', 'were', 'deemed', 'bad', 'influence', 'younger', 'girls', 'unacceptable', 'temptation', 'local', 'boys', 'orphanage', 'where', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Rose', 'Dorothy', 'Duffy', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'wedlock', ""'re"", 'condemned', 'working', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'washing', 'dirty', 'linen', 'local', 'businesses', 'institutions', 'even', 'nuns', 'sit', 'count', 'money', 'rolling', 'Talking', 'disallowed', 'Friendships', 'are', 'forbidden', 'Beatings', 'are', 'commonplace.The', 'girls', 'react', 'different', 'ways', 'Bernadette', 'determined', 'escape', 'brutally', 'punished', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Rose', 'Margaret', 'seem', 'accept', 'fate', 'girl', 'only', 'be', 'returned', 'beaten', 'father', 'several', 'years', 'different', 'ways', 'three', 'manage', 'escape', 'regain', 'freedom.Church-bashing', 'might', 'be', 'du', 'jour', ""n't"", 'mudslinging', 'agrave', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Even', 'lens', 'relative', 'objectivity', 'nuns', 'ignorance', 'hypocrisy', 'astounding', 'was', 'Church', 'society', 'tacit', 'approval', 'most', 'chilling', 'thing', ""n't"", 'events', 'film', 'really', 'happened', 'last', 'Magdalene', 'Laundry', 'did', ""n't"", 'close', '1996.Film', 'medium', 'always', 'been', 'primarily', 'entertainment', 'Sure', 'when', 'Lumi', 'egrave', 're', 'brothers', 'shot', 'film', 'moving', 'images', 'train', 'leaving', 'Ciotat', 'were', 'creating', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'recording', 'posterity', 'main', 'goal', 'when', 'showed', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'was', 'dazzle', 'entertain.Films', 'are', 'rarely', 'truly', 'important', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters']",N/A

They brought shame to their families, and were relegated to one of the convent laundries to save their souls and to be separated from their families..  They were treated brutally, not allowed to leave the convent, not to speak to outsiders, and tormented by the nuns.  I saw a 60 Minutes documentary where two women were interviewed who had spent years in one of these Magdalene homes.  The living conditions were brutal. Some women spent their whole lives in these homes, because they had no family left and nowhere to go.The practice was just discontinued in 1996! These girls and women labored for many hours a day doing laundry for other convents and friaries, even hospitals. But all from the shame they brought on their families.

769556,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B0000AZVEN,Amazon Customer,"[12, 20]","Peter Mullan's ""The Magdalene Sisters' is about four women forced into a religious and institutional nightmare. Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is a shy girl raped at a wedding by her cousin; Patricia/Rose (Dorothy Duff) is an unwed mother whose child is taken away from her and sent for adoption; Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) is an attractive orphan who is deemed ""too flirtatious,""; and Crispina (Eileen Walsh) is another unwed mother whose son is being raised by her sister. In the eyes of the Irish community they live in, all of them have sinned, most particularly because all of them have shown evidence of sexuality. They are all sent to work in a religious institution run by the Sisters of Magdalene Order, where they are expected to earn their keep by doing laundry for outsiders.The film's based on events that took place in Ireland between the 1960s and as recently as 1996. An estimated 30,000 young women were sent away to these establishments because they were deemed either to have sinned or inspired temptation.These so-called religious institutions seemed to be little more than profit-making prisons where the women were worked to the point of exhaustion, psychologically and physically abused, and brainwashed into subservience. Here, the leader of the offending nuns Sister Bridget, is played by Geraldine McEwan.It's undoubtedly powerful and harrowing stuff, but I'm going to disagree with many reviewers that it's as good a movie as it could have been. It's strength comes mostly from the subject matter rather than how it's handled. And I think that Mullan, who wrote as well as directed, takes a stereotyped and narrow approach to the nuns themselves. Some have pointed out that the real horrors visited on the inmates of many of these institutions were worse than what we see here. Probably so, but I can't help feeling that at least some of the nuns probably thought that they were doing what they were doing for the girls' own good. That couldn't make it right, particularly when bitterness and sadism seemed often to have been exacerbated by painful and repressive things that had happened in the nuns' own lives, but it would have added more dimension to the characters. The over-simplistic approach is clear the first time we see Sister Bridget, greedily counting money as she talks to her new charges about their need to expiate their sins. Nigel Willoughby's cinematography is also something of a liability at times, and - combined with Mullan's directorial approach sometimes makes this look a little like a made for TV movie.One character I did like though, mostly because she is presented with a degree of complexity, is Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone). There are points where we can feel that she too is in danger of becoming one of the embittered lifers in the institution. All the same, ""The Magdalene Sisters"" does pack a punch, and when some of the characters get out of there you feel they have escaped from an environment as harrowing as the Turkish prison in ""Midnight Express""",3,Let down by indifferent cinematography,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,3013,"['Peter', 'Mullan', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'four', 'women', 'forced', 'religious', 'institutional', 'nightmare', 'Margaret', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'shy', 'girl', 'raped', 'wedding', 'cousin', 'Patricia/Rose', 'Dorothy', 'Duff', 'unwed', 'mother', 'child', 'taken', 'away', 'sent', 'adoption', 'Bernadette', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'attractive', 'orphan', 'who', 'deemed', 'too', 'flirtatious', 'Crispina', 'Eileen', 'Walsh', 'unwed', 'mother', 'son', 'being', 'raised', 'sister', 'eyes', 'Irish', 'community', 'live', 'have', 'sinned', 'most', 'particularly', 'have', 'shown', 'evidence', 'sexuality', 'are', 'sent', 'work', 'religious', 'institution', 'run', 'Sisters', 'Magdalene', 'Order', 'where', 'are', 'expected', 'earn', 'keep', 'doing', 'laundry', 'outsiders.The', 'film', 'based', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Ireland', '1960s', 'as', 'recently', '1996', 'estimated', '30,000', 'young', 'women', 'were', 'sent', 'away', 'establishments', 'were', 'deemed', 'either', 'have', 'sinned', 'inspired', 'temptation.These', 'so-called', 'religious', 'institutions', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'profit-making', 'prisons', 'where', 'women', 'were', 'worked', 'point', 'exhaustion', 'psychologically', 'physically', 'abused', 'brainwashed', 'subservience', 'Here', 'leader', 'offending', 'nuns', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'played', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan.It', 'undoubtedly', 'powerful', 'harrowing', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'going', 'disagree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'strength', 'mostly', 'subject', 'matter', 'rather', 'how', 'handled', 'think', 'Mullan', 'who', 'wrote', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'stereotyped', 'narrow', 'approach', 'nuns', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'real', 'horrors', 'visited', 'inmates', 'many', 'institutions', 'were', 'worse', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'Probably', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'least', 'nuns', 'probably', 'thought', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'girls', 'own', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'right', 'particularly', 'when', 'bitterness', 'sadism', 'seemed', 'often', 'have', 'been', 'exacerbated', 'painful', 'repressive', 'things', 'had', 'happened', 'nuns', 'own', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'dimension', 'characters', 'over-simplistic', 'approach', 'clear', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'greedily', 'counting', 'money', 'new', 'charges', 'need', 'expiate', 'sins', 'Nigel', 'Willoughby', 'cinematography', 'also', 'something', 'liability', 'times', 'combined', 'Mullan', 'directorial', 'approach', 'sometimes', 'look', 'little', 'made', 'TV', 'movie.One', 'character', 'did', 'mostly', 'presented', 'degree', 'complexity', 'Bernadette', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'can', 'feel', 'too', 'danger', 'becoming', 'one', 'embittered', 'lifers', 'institution', 'same', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'pack', 'punch', 'when', 'characters', 'get', 'feel', 'have', 'escaped', 'environment', 'as', 'harrowing', 'Turkish', 'prison', 'Midnight', 'Express']",N/A
769557,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0000AZVEN,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 16]","Until very recently, every society throughout human history has felt the need to regulate the sexuality of its young women; the relatively free sexuality that we see today in the developed world only came about in the late 1960s, with the advent of the pill. The reason for this preoccupation with women's sexuality is not hard to understand from a biological point of view: The female has little doubt that her child is hers (unless there is a freak situation, like a mess up of the babies at the maternity); the male instead wants to be sure that his offspring is really his, otherwise he would be wasting his resources on another male's child (I wonder how DNA tests for a child's paternity, only recently available, will change this equation in the long term). So different societies have try different methods to try to assure that young females stay chaste, whether it is through chastity belts, the use of veils and other sorts of clothing in order to cover the body, stoning adulterous women, so called ""honor crimes"", religious teachings that emphasize modesty since childhood, etc. If we are to believe this movie, in mid 20th century Ireland they come up with a novel solution to this problem: every young woman that showed (even minor) signs of sexual promiscuity was sent by her family to a convent, where she would spent most of her time washing other people's clothes (so as a way to ""wash"" her sins) under the watch of sadistic money-grubbing nuns. This film is too angry with this situation to become effective. It has also some very dubious scenes, the most notorious being one in which the women stand naked in a line being mocked by the dreadful nuns in charge (this scene wouldn't be out of place in an exploitative women's prison movie, a genre that this film comes dangerously close to). One of the few redeeming features of this film is the young actresses earnest, serious performances in a movie that sometimes seems keen in humiliating them.",3,"Not bad, but too angry with its subject matter to be effective",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1968,"['very', 'recently', 'society', 'human', 'history', 'felt', 'need', 'regulate', 'sexuality', 'young', 'women', 'relatively', 'free', 'sexuality', 'see', 'today', 'developed', 'world', 'only', 'came', 'about', 'late', '1960s', 'advent', 'pill', 'reason', 'preoccupation', 'women', 'sexuality', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'biological', 'point', 'view', 'female', 'little', 'doubt', 'child', 'hers', 'freak', 'situation', 'mess', 'babies', 'maternity', 'male', 'instead', 'be', 'sure', 'offspring', 'really', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'wasting', 'resources', 'male', 'child', 'wonder', 'how', 'DNA', 'tests', 'child', 'paternity', 'only', 'recently', 'available', 'will', 'change', 'equation', 'long', 'term', 'So', 'different', 'societies', 'have', 'try', 'different', 'methods', 'try', 'assure', 'young', 'females', 'stay', 'chaste', 'chastity', 'belts', 'use', 'veils', 'other', 'sorts', 'clothing', 'order', 'cover', 'body', 'stoning', 'adulterous', 'women', 'so', 'called', 'honor', 'crimes', 'religious', 'teachings', 'emphasize', 'modesty', 'childhood', 'etc', 'are', 'believe', 'movie', 'mid', '20th', 'century', 'Ireland', 'come', 'up', 'novel', 'solution', 'problem', 'young', 'woman', 'showed', 'even', 'minor', 'signs', 'sexual', 'promiscuity', 'was', 'sent', 'family', 'convent', 'where', 'would', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'washing', 'other', 'people', 'clothes', 'so', 'way', 'wash', 'sins', 'watch', 'sadistic', 'money-grubbing', 'nuns', 'film', 'too', 'angry', 'situation', 'become', 'effective', 'also', 'very', 'dubious', 'scenes', 'most', 'notorious', 'being', 'one', 'women', 'stand', 'naked', 'line', 'being', 'mocked', 'dreadful', 'nuns', 'charge', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'place', 'exploitative', 'women', 'prison', 'movie', 'genre', 'film', 'dangerously', 'close', 'One', 'few', 'redeeming', 'features', 'film', 'young', 'actresses', 'earnest', 'serious', 'performances', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'keen', 'humiliating']",N/A
769558,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000AZVEN,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I was talking with a friend, not too long back, about films that leave you emotionally exhausted.  You know, the films that are so unjust and frustrating that you find yourself tense throughout and near seething at the idea of this film being the slightest bit factual.  Films like `The Ox-Bow Incident' or `The Crucible' are those types of films.  You can add `The Magdalene Sisters' to that list as well, for whether this is based on a true story or merely inspired by factual events (I'm still not entirely sure which) this film has so many slivers of truth (supposedly this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface) that one is left bewildered at how these atrocities could have been committed, and in the name of GOD!The film tells the story of three girls named Margaret, Bernadette and Rose (Anne-Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone and Dorothy Duffy respectively) as they endure years under the watch of the tortuous nuns in an Irish laundry.  The three girls are sent there for situations that don't really warrant the punishment (Bernadette is a flirt, but up to that point had never been sexually active, Rose merely had a baby out of wedlock, which may have been considered a sin in those days but clearly she was not a troublesome girl; and Margaret was raped, so the instance was not even her fault) and this only adds to the dire frustration of the audience who is left struggling to comprehend WHY this is happening.Whether they are being beaten, humiliated or scolded, these girls slowly start to fray and adopt a mindset and attitude that only circumstances can create.  Bernadette especially proves to be the films emotional focal point as her character captures every ounce of emotional collapse.  Her words are haunting (""I know what you're trying to do, I just don't know why you're doing it"", ""she needed to suffer"", ""you got what you deserved"") and they are so poignant for the film for they show not only the bitterness but the understanding that this place has impressed upon her (that harsh statement ""you got what you deserved"", uttered at a fellow inmates deathbed, is followed by a simple yet powerful kiss that relays a feeling of understanding and compassion that can only come from someone who wishes they would meet the same fate).I truly commend Peter Mullan, who not only wrote such a powerful screenplay, but he directed this film with a beautiful sense of subtle travesty.  He understood that underplaying the situations and the conditions would only heighten the audience's appreciation for the realities of these horrors.  Overplaying them would have only created a campy atmosphere, delving into `horror' territory, which would have diminished the importance of this film.  Sure, some have commented that this film plays out like a horror film, but not in the conventional sense.  This is first and foremost a tragic `dramatic' story, and as one is works flawlessly.  The gritty realism is felt in every frame.The opening wedding scene is brilliant, with the muted voices and that intense music; easily one of the best `moments' in film this decade.And then there is the acting.For me, the performances in this film are just stunning.  Yes, there is a clear standout, but I'll get to her in a minute.  I want to mention Geraldine McEwan, who portrays the greedy and cruel Sister Bridget.  Her presence is commanding and haunting to the core.  When she speaks, you shutter.  Eileen Walsh is heartbreaking as the `soft headed' Crispina, a young girl who was sentenced to this torture after having a son out of wedlock.  The scene, in the yard, with her son at the gate was just emotionally devastating.  Anne-Marie Duff displays a tragic sense of maturity as the kind hearted Margaret, her eyes bleeding through to the soul of the audience; and Dorothy Duffy understands all of Rose's pain and bewilderment.  The films heart and soul though, is none other than Nora-Jane Noone.  Yes, she was saddled with the baitiest character and thus she had the most to work with, but BOY DID SHE WORK WITH IT!  Her sensual flirtations are quickly stripped away and replaced by an emotionally conflicted bitterness that sums up all the powers of the film in a single shift of her eyes.  She is simply stunning here.`The Magdalene Sisters' tackles weighty subjects with a subtlety that allows the audience to be swept away within the films powers, instead of browbeating us with theories and opinions and repelling our sympathies.  The way the greed aspect is handled is a nice touch because it is never given an overabundance of attention, but the attention it is given is sufficient for our understanding.  I did find the ending to be a tad of a Hollywood cop-out, unless it is truly how `the story ended' (it did leave me wondering why they didn't do that four years earlier) but it doesn't even begin to tarnish the quality of the film.One of the best films of the year that was 2002, and truly a mesmerizing and must see film for any cinephile.",5,You got what you deserved...,1268265600,"03 11,

Amazingly, none of the main narratives are exaggerations.

Umm, yeah - that's the point.  If you're looking for that ""Come Lift Us Where We Belong"" moment, go back to your run-of-the-mill Hollywood release.  ""Magdalene Sisters"" stays true to its vision of accurately depicting the horrific (yes) bleakness of life inside those walls.  In fact, the DVD cover box of Nora-Jane Noone's fetching, over-the-shoulder look is not at all indicative of what you get in the movie.  In fact, that come-hither glance is what lands her inside of Magdalene's walls.I agree with Paul Aragon's spotlight review - the standout performance here is Eileen Walsh's 'Crispina.'  Her ""You're not a man of God"" refrain - shouted out 24 (yes, 24) times in a row - will make the hair stand up on your arms.  That is just pure guts by writer/director Peter Mullan to keep the camera rolling...and it's a spleen-splitting, cathartic performance by Walsh.  Read Paul Aragon's review.

In most cases the sinners are unwed mothers, but some are punished simply for being too pretty, or for being the victims of rape.As one would expect, this is a gut-wrenching story, detailing verbal, physical, and sexual abuse of girls who were already victims. It is a classic story (too common in history) of punishing the victim of the crime instead of the criminal.Most interesting is that unlike most stories of oppression and inhumanity against women, most of the atrocities against the women in the movie are committed by women: the nuns running the convent. If you weren't afraid of nuns before watching this movie you will be afterwards. Also shocking is how recent the events described happened: the story starts in 1964, and at the end of the film we are informed that the last Magdalene asylum was closed in 1994.This is an important story that needed to be told, and an important chapter of history that should not be forgotten.

Have several tissues handy.The story is of a girls reform school run by the Magdalene Sisters in Ireland, apparently one of quite a few they ran. We follow the lives of four of the girls; two had illegitimate babies, one was accused of flirting with the boys, and one was ""disobedient,"" but it was never clear what about. Their parents put them in this place in each case, and there is no idea when or if they will be let out.The place is mostly a sweat shop laundry, and the sisters make a good bit of money off the slave labor of the girls. They are not allowed to talk to one another, must listen to ""inspiring"" works being read while they eat their lousy meals, although they can see the table where the nuns eat is very good food indeed. Also the priest who is connected to the place is, as one girl puts it ""not a man of God."" No, he certainly isn't.Of course girls attempt to escape, and are severely punished when they are caught. One of the ones who had a baby tries several ways to commit suicide, and is eventually taken to a mental hospital, where she eventually died of anorexia. One has a brother who came for her when he was old enough (that was the one who was ""disobedient"" in some unspecified way), and two others managed to escape.It's a horrible, chaotic place, but the girls manage to get in a few blows against the empire, as it were. One of the funniest is when the priest who is ""not a man of God"" has some sort of extremely itchy plant put in the dryer with his clothes. It may have been poison ivy, but I don't know if that grows in Ireland.So ultimately it is a tale of sadism and courage in the face of that abuse.

The poor women given over to their cruelty got a life sentence with no hope of appeal.

Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is attending a family wedding where a drunken cousin gets her alone and rapes her. Word of the crime gets to her father and the local priest, but the rapist  isn't punished. Instead, Margaret is shipped off in shame to the care of the Magdalene sisters. Rose (Dorothy Duffy) is pregnant out of wedlock and, when the baby is born, it is taken away and the young girl is forcibly shipped to the convent. For Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), the only crime she committed was to flirt, from a distance, with teenaged boys at school. The three arrive together at the place that could well be their ""home"" for the rest of their miserable lives.""The Magdalene Sister"" is an earnest indictment against a Church system that indentured thousands of women and subjected them to long, hard days of scrubbing laundry for the local businesses, earning money for the sisters but getting none of it in return for their back breaking labors.The day-to-day toil the girls must withstand - including humiliating strip downs, physical abuse and psychological torture - is depicted with sometime nauseating believability. In this time when the Catholic Church is under scrutiny at all levels ""The Magdalene Sisters"" feels timely, though it is a subject the was close to Mullan's heart for years before coming to the screen.Writer/director Peter Mullan crafts a film that plays its period time frame well, and presents the convent itself as an almost Medieval prison where the daughters of the working cast are sent for real or imagined crimes against the Lord. He is fortunate to have a talented cast of both newcomers and veterans that lend realness to the proceeds.Geraldine McEwan, as the convent's Mother Superior, is chilling with her kindly outward demeanor that masks the cold heart of a cruel martinet who cares more about the money her wards earn than she ever would for any of the girls and women under her dubious care. This is the best supporting actress performance for 2003 - Great films need great villians and she delivers the goods.The trio of young women at the film's focus give strong performances as innocents torn from their families because of arcane thinking that seem dated for the 19th Century, never mind for the later half of the 20th.  Noone, in particular, has good presence and comes across with just the right sassy note as she professes her innocence to Sister Bridget. ""I'm a good girl, sister,"" she insists to her jailer.This film is a heartfelt honesty of art work, the fine performances and deft crafting make this a must for the socially conscious. This film is disturbing and very hard to watch at times...and yes, if you are faint at heart you may want to stay away from it.

As I write this, Ireland is throwing off the shackles of the Catholic Church to take back its schools and hospitals. It is demanding accountability from the church for the sexual abuse perpetrated for decades by its clergy on innocent women and children. It is also demanding the names of women who died after imprisonment in the Magdalene laundries.These women were imprisoned by the church with the support of local law enforcement and their Catholic families who were told by the church to send them away to do ""penance"". What was their crime? It could be as simple as having sex, getting pregnant out of wedlock or being raped. Those who were pregnant had their babies taken away and sold to adoptive parents by the church, often after breast feeding and bonding with them. Unless a relative had mercy on them, they remained as unpaid laborers to ""work off their sins"" for the rest of their lives. They were buried in unmarked graves with no inquest into the manner of their deaths. It is an ugly story but as the Vatican loses its holy gloss under the weight of banking scandals and secrecy, it is time to face the truth of what total control by the Catholic Church did to the country of Ireland.This film is very well acted and the script is excellent, but it would be easier to take if it were really just a script.

Instead they should not only welcome it for the light it sheds but require every pope, cardinal, bishop, priest and nun to watch it once a month.

But, from 1930 to 1996, they were used to house teen-age girls thought to be sexually ""immoral"". The girls were required to perform slave labor, which apparently the nuns profited from. However, not only the Catholic Church but also the Irish government and even the girls own parents played a role in keeping these abusive institutions going.The movie focues on 4 girls, Bernadette, Rose, Margaret and Crispina, brought to the asylum for such ""offenses"" as being raped by a cousin, having a baby out of of wedlock and flirting. The girls try to rebel in a variety of ways. But are then harshly abused and beaten by the nuns, including an especially sadistic head nun known as Sister Bridget. Even more humiliating is the shower, where the girls are forced to stand naked and have their body parts ridiculed by the nuns.The movie itself is excellent. But perhaps even more compelling is the included documentary ""Sex In A Cold Climate."" Here interviews are conducted with several women who were forced into one of these Magdalene laundries. One woman said she was sent there only for being an orphan girl who was attractive. Each is these women is clearly still tormented by the abuse they suffered. It is extremely disturbing to hear their stories and it is hard to believe these places were kept open until 1996. It was even more painful for my wife to watch. She grew up attending a Catholic school in Ecuador and still has scars from being beaten by the nuns there. She said she had terrible nightmares the night after watching the movie and seemed somewhat traumatized for several days after.""Mankind's inhumanity towards man"" is one of the great tragedies of life.

No, seriously, watching the DVD of The Magdalene Sisters was like a time machine for me. Not that I was ever an unwed mother in an Irish hellhole run by religious extremists, but I did grow up in a poor neighborhood that was patrolled by reprobate and psychotic cops that made the bad cops in Serpico look virginal, by comparison. Those cops, as the nuns in the film, ruled by terror and brutality. People were assaulted and humiliated and denigrated for the least of reasons.This film could have easily veered off track into a running anti-Catholic joke or screed, but its artistic `reality' is too levelheaded to allow that. Basically, last century in Ireland was a misogynist's utopia. Young women were horded off to laundries to do slave labor for the Roman Catholic church, under the guidance of nuns from the Magdalene sisterhood, whose hope was to redeem prostitutes, unwed mothers, and other `fallen girls'. The title is a play off this fact and three young women who are the stars of the film. Based upon real women, although for dramatic purposes their tales are condensed into the 1960s (the DVD's documentary Sex In A Cold Climate shows the women the lead characters were based on, and their age range varies over a quarter of a century). Why the 1960s and not the 1940s seems only to be for the belief among many artists that this was the last period of social justice in the world. The three girls represent different archetypes of `fallen women': the orphan and would be prostitute and sexual temptress Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), whose crime is flirting with boys at Catholic school; the unwed mother Rose- called Patricia by the nuns (Dorothy Duffy), whose child is taken away from her by her parents, and rape/incest victim Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), whose brutalizing by her cousin, is followed by her parents shipping away, until her younger brother- who cried out for her as she was taken away, comes to rescue her four years later....  The Catholic Church in Ireland condemned this 2003 film, which is no surprise, but given its problems with pedophile priests, does anyone watching this really believe the claims of sadistic lesbian nuns is NOT credible! That these Magdalene laundry camps were run until 1996 is amazing (in the worst sense), but all too emblemic of the evils of all religion- from the Crusades and Inquisitions, Martin Luther to Torquemada, the Conquistadores and the Taliban. Writer/director Peter Mullan never veers into caricature, which says alot, given the subject matter, and the acting is utterly superb. McEwan, as Sister Bridget, reeks wickedry like few characters in film history. Even Nurse Ratched, from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, seems kind-hearted by comparison. And this film is worlds better than a similarly-themed film from a few years ago, Girl, Interrupted, which seemed more like a chicks behind bars film. None of the actresses in The Magdalene Sisters are likely to become sex symbols, like the collagen lipped and breast enhanced Angelina Jolie.

But I finally forced myself. The movie was as unnerving as I thought it would be. As an atheist, I was already aggravated enough at religion. This movie kicked it up a notch. From the start, the question that constantly ran through my mind was, Where was God through all this? I already knew the answer, but by the end, all viewers knew the answer as well. If the American priest sex scandal put the Church up against the ropes, then this film delivered the knockout punch. There wasn't a single sympathetic character among anyone in power. I give much praise to everyone involved in the production. The writing, directing, cinematography and acting were all fantastic. Geraldine McEwan was superb in the key role of Sister Bridget. Mullan did a perfect job of capturing the cultural spirit of that age and place. The cruelty was beautifully understated most of the time. It was the status quo for that milieu. There were a few sadistic nuns, but I sensed most of the nuns were simply uncaring. What really burned me wasn't the nuns but the cruel, uncaring nature of the relatives who consigned the girls to that place. But again, it was the status quo. We watched as the girls comtemplated breakouts through the movie. By the end, Bernadette's ""We have nothing to lose"" argument became irrefutable. It was the logic of a lifer in a slave labor camp. Savage bits of irony are sprinkled throughout the movie, such as the ""God Is Just"" headboard and Margaret's final confrontation with Sister Bridget. Some people don't like the rebellious escape at the end, but I thought it was a needed catharsis. If you wanted a more hopeless, dismal ending, just think of all the other girls still stuck in the Laundries until 1996. There's your true dismal ending. Lest you think Mullan was unduly harsh on the Church, the original documentary ""Sex In A Cold Climate"" is included. The ""fictional"" film is based on cold hard fact. This isn't a movie I plan to watch twice, but I'm glad I saw it once.

These so-called laundries were in fact a combination prison, mental hospital, and place of torture. The bleak, gray-toned 2002 film, The Magdalene Sisters, tells the true story of several young women, Margaret,  Rose, and Bernadette, who were, in the late 1960's, sent to one such installation for crimes that ranged from supposed promiscuity, to unwed motherhood, to one girl, ironically a virgin, simply being ""a natural-born temptress of men."" Orphans, single mothers, the mentally ill, the unwanted, girls from all across Ireland ended up in these Magdalene houses and often never again emerged. Routine beatings, psychological cruelty, sanity-breaking rehabilitation programs straight out of the Inquisition, Irish people to this day can tell you sickening horror stories about these places, and a film like this one confirms it with stark eyewitness testimony. Thankfully the Catholic Church in Ireland today is at long last somewhat curtailed in its cruel authority, but for much of the past that organization held dominance over Irish life in much the same way that the Communist Party did in the Cold War-era East Bloc. The Magdalene Sisters is a terrifying, enraging, disgust-inducing movie that is not for the faint of heart, but should be seen by those who think of the Catholic Church as flawless, or who regard Ireland as some sort of merry, giddy, fantasy land.Folks, just be glad these Magdalene laundries, an entire nation's vast dirty secret, are no more!",4,Catholic Concentration Camps: Ireland's Filthy Secret Is Finally Out,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,1724,"['quality', 'motion', 'picture', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'stories', 'ever', 'set', 'film', 'true', 'Ireland', 'well', 'late', '1990', 'number', 'charity', 'institutions', 'were', 'sponsored', 'state', 'managed', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'nuns', 'so-called', 'laundries', 'were', 'fact', 'combination', 'prison', 'mental', 'hospital', 'place', 'torture', 'bleak', 'gray-toned', '2002', 'film', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'true', 'story', 'several', 'young', 'women', 'Margaret', 'Rose', 'Bernadette', 'who', 'were', 'late', '1960', 'sent', 'one', 'such', 'installation', 'crimes', 'ranged', 'supposed', 'promiscuity', 'unwed', 'motherhood', 'one', 'girl', 'ironically', 'virgin', 'simply', 'being', 'natural-born', 'temptress', 'men', 'Orphans', 'single', 'mothers', 'mentally', 'ill', 'unwanted', 'girls', 'Ireland', 'ended', 'up', 'Magdalene', 'houses', 'often', 'never', 'again', 'emerged', 'Routine', 'beatings', 'psychological', 'cruelty', 'sanity-breaking', 'rehabilitation', 'programs', 'straight', 'Inquisition', 'Irish', 'people', 'day', 'can', 'tell', 'sickening', 'horror', 'stories', 'places', 'film', 'one', 'stark', 'eyewitness', 'testimony', 'Thankfully', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Ireland', 'today', 'long', 'last', 'somewhat', 'curtailed', 'cruel', 'authority', 'much', 'past', 'organization', 'held', 'dominance', 'Irish', 'life', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Communist', 'Party', 'did', 'Cold', 'War-era', 'East', 'Bloc', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'terrifying', 'enraging', 'disgust-inducing', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'think', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'flawless', 'who', 'regard', 'Ireland', 'sort', 'merry', 'giddy', 'fantasy', 'land.Folks', 'just', 'be', 'glad', 'Magdalene', 'laundries', 'entire', 'nation', 'vast', 'dirty', 'secret', 'are', 'more']",N/A

All three girls were forcibly removed to the Magdalene Laundry as ""penitents"" to save their souls. But this Irish convent is really a slave labor camp run by a sadomasochistic nun named Bridget. The film, set in the late 1960s, follows the stories of these three girls, and the institutionalized brutality they experienced. Physical torture, sexual exploitation, and psychological humiliation were their lot, and the lot, we learn from a film trailer, of some 30,000 women detained at similar laundries throughout Ireland from the 1880s until the closure of the last one in 1996. Some of these women spent a lifetime in these prisons. It goes without saying that this film is not representative of the church or its clergy; many people had wonderfully loving experiences growing up Catholic (or Protestant). Others have objected that the film trades in shallow stereotypes.

Mullan keeps us riveted from the opening scene -- a light-hearted party in Ireland that leads to tragedy for a young woman. Raped by a cousin and betrayed by her family, the  woman ends up in the Magdalene Laundries. Under slavelike conditions, women lived out the ""cleansing"" metaphor while earning money for the religious order who sponsored them. There was no respite: they weren't allowed to talk to one another and they certainly couldn't go to the nuns.When the film first appeared, some critics jeered at what they called exaggerated scenes of cruelty.  Yet former Magdalenes say that, if anything, the film is too kind. The real laundries were even worse.  Every scene in this film happened somewhere, often more than once..Even if you see the movie in theatres, as I did, it's worth watching the DVD to get the extra footage of Sex in a Cold Climate.  Interviews with three surviving Magdalenes are especially powerful because the women speak so matter-of-factly about their experiences. There are tears, but no dramatics, as they speak about the effect of their experiences on their subsequent attempts to marry and live a normal life. Traumatized by their past, with no access to contemporary sex therapists, the final irony was their inability to carry out the church's command to create happy, fulfilled marriages that honor both partners.In both film and film critics, I've seen no discussion of the nuns who created these places. Joni Mitchell's song refers to cold-hearted brides of Christ--but how did they get that way? Some Magdalenes became nuns to get better food and living conditions, since they couldn't escape altogether. And the nuns themselves were uneducated about sex, repressed and undoubtedly frustrated in their own lives.In the end, one wonders if there isn't some kind of gene that predisposes human beings to lock each other up in the name of ideology.

Yet director Peter Mullen has developed this engrossing tale directly from facts as made known in the Irish press: for years the Catholic Church operated the Magdalene Laundry as an asylum for young women who varied in their 'sins' from mere flirting with boys to being raped to giving birth out of wedlock. Though the church wants to be viewed as giving these 'unwanted girls' a haven, the asylums were prison like in nature, in abuse of women, and in forced labor camp life style.The story focuses on the lives of four young girls who are sent to the Magdalene Laundry in 1964: Rose (Dorothy Duffy), Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), and Margaret (Anna-Marie Duff) and the already incarcerated Crispina (Eileen Walsh).  Under the brutal guardianship of Sister Bridget (an extraordinary performance by Geraldine McEwan) the girls live through the slowly unveiled life patterns that have existed for years in this dark, dank, horrid place.  They bond with the other 'inmates' (the entire spectrum of age), witness the cruelty of the nuns and the degrading behavior of the priests, and focus on the idea of escape.How all of this plays out is the kaleidoscopic intricacy of the film and all of the varied subplots and particular performances are superbly handled.  The startling fact is that we are watching a story based on fact: this asylum was not closed until 1996!  Kudos to Peter Mullen for making public some of the atrocities under the guise of religion that still abound around the world.  This film is not only instructional, it is a fine piece of cinematography, acting and directing.  No wonder it has won so many awards.

The Taliban would enforce the subjugation of women. Al-Quaida would reverse the flow of history and create a medieval theocracy across the mideast. Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel would proscribe people of insufficient racial purity from holding high office. And conservative U.S. Christians would lay claim to tax dollars for their faith-based initiatives, consign the Bill of Rights to the dustbin of history, and ban all relationships between consenting adults not to their liking.For anyone who thinks the stakes are not high in this struggle, let them watch The Magdalene Sisters. These events happened. They happened at the hands of an ostensibly charitable church sanctioned by a state that delegated its power to judge and punish to religious zealots. Imprisonment without due process. Presumptive guilt. Total conformity in thought and behavior imposed arbitrarily on one person by another. Brutal punishment brought down on the slightest breath of protest or disclosure. A few escaped.

The girl is deprived of her child and sent to some nunnery where she is going to be a prisoner and a working slave for the comfort of the nuns, with no hope to get out, except maybe if a younger male member of the family accepts to come and retrieve her with the benediction of his local priest, or if they escape and become more or less respectable if an accepted member of the society accepts to take her under his (very doubtful if he wants to keep his reputation) or her protection. Any rebellion will be dealt with physical and corporeal punishment, and for the most serious cases that would transpire outside, the girl will be locked up in some mental institution to die there under medical surveillance, is that care? Period. The point is that we are speaking of Ireland in the 1960s-1980s. They will say it is catholic, so it does not concern the countries where catholicism does not have any dominant power any more. But think of Poland and the permanent and regressive ""debate"" there since the end of communism about abortion. Then they will say it is marginal, only two or three countries in the world. Is it so? Is sexual freedom totally accepted for women, and that implies the women have the right to sexually do what they want with their bodies? But think of other sexual groups and how they are victimized in some of our countries, even France, Great Britain and the USA where a gay pride covers up a lot of discrimination. The film thus is extremely disturbing and frightening, especially since it is based on entirely true cases and the total figure of that victimization of women (one raped, the other one who only smiled at boys with a railing between them, and the third one pregnant and giving birth to a child) is several tens of thousands. A film that should be shown and discussed in all its details in all schools in our countries with kids between 14 and 16. Think of the girl who was burned to death by her brother because she was too friendly, according to the boy, with other boys, and that in France just a few years ago. One junior minister in our government is a founding ""mother"" of a movement called ""Neither whores nor slaves"" that was created just after this event.

It holds within it such emotional girth, such a sympathy with these girls and what they go through in such a society that holds the Catholic belief system as the absolute truth, that by the time you leave the theater, like it or dis-like it, you'll feel drained. Along with a heart-wrenching relentlessness by writer/director Peter Mullan in revealing the details of the nun's cruelty and coldness, there are a number of very good performances here. Geraldine McEwan's Sister Bridget, head Sister of the Magdalene reformatory, is on par with Nurse Ratched for being one of the most frightening of dominating female figures; Eileen Walsh's Crispina/Harriet is possibly the most touching of the lot of imprisoned women and could garner an Oscar nomination; Nora-Jane Noone's Bernadette is a true balancing act between rebellious spirit and trapped creature; and the other players, including Anne-Marrie Duff and Dorothy Duffy add splendid supporting work.As fellow film connoisseurs know, Ingmar Bergman was renown for most of his films dealing with faith, the loss of it, and/or the absence of God and the pain that seeps through in living in such a world that doesn't question it. While these questions weren't as forward and evident in this film as they were in Bergman's masterpieces, often Mullan subtly brings these questions to light as the film progresses: if God is pounded over and over and over into these girl's heads, that they are here because they need to repent for their ""mortal sins"" (such as being raped, flirting, having children out of wedlock), and they are subjected to physical, sexual, and mental abuse by those who should be compassionate, life-long devotees to the faith, where is God? This question actually comes to a big head in a scene that at first shows itself to be rather amusing when a priest gets a poison Ivy rash, and then Crispina, who got it from him in the worst way, shouts out over and over YOU'RE NOT A MAN OF GOD, and thus is silenced away to a mental asylum. Indeed, this is the part of the film where the question gets the most light, and it's the most harrowing scene in the movie among others and is one of the most powerful in movies this year.The only liability is the climatic ending to which is something against a Bergman=esque logic, and while I won't reveal it here, it tends to go to an (appropriate) timing that's akin to Cuckoo's Nest. Personally, I felt the film should have ended with the Bergman logic instead of the Kesey spirit, but that's neither here nor there, since the bulk of the film in and of itself is contains some passionate drama, and to those who see it will not only get an eye-opening view to the old-time (if old-time is up until seven years ago) Catholic ways, but also to the great dangers of control over human life.",5,Bergman goes to Ireland: remarkably executed,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,2861,"['Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'year', 'such', 'emotional', 'girth', 'sympathy', 'girls', 'what', 'go', 'such', 'society', 'Catholic', 'belief', 'system', 'absolute', 'truth', 'time', 'leave', 'theater', 'dis-like', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'drained', 'heart-wrenching', 'relentlessness', 'writer/director', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'revealing', 'details', 'nun', 'cruelty', 'coldness', 'are', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'here', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'head', 'Sister', 'Magdalene', 'reformatory', 'par', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'dominating', 'female', 'figures', 'Eileen', 'Walsh', 'Crispina/Harriet', 'possibly', 'most', 'touching', 'lot', 'imprisoned', 'women', 'could', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Bernadette', 'true', 'balancing', 'act', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'trapped', 'creature', 'other', 'players', 'including', 'Anne-Marrie', 'Duff', 'Dorothy', 'Duffy', 'add', 'splendid', 'supporting', 'work.As', 'fellow', 'film', 'connoisseurs', 'know', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'was', 'renown', 'most', 'films', 'dealing', 'faith', 'loss', 'absence', 'God', 'pain', 'living', 'world', ""n't"", 'question', 'questions', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'forward', 'evident', 'film', 'were', 'Bergman', 'masterpieces', 'often', 'Mullan', 'subtly', 'questions', 'light', 'film', 'God', 'pounded', 'girl', 'heads', 'are', 'here', 'need', 'repent', 'mortal', 'sins', 'such', 'being', 'raped', 'flirting', 'having', 'children', 'wedlock', 'are', 'subjected', 'physical', 'sexual', 'mental', 'abuse', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'compassionate', 'life-long', 'devotees', 'faith', 'where', 'God', 'question', 'actually', 'big', 'head', 'scene', 'first', 'be', 'rather', 'amusing', 'when', 'priest', 'poison', 'Ivy', 'rash', 'then', 'Crispina', 'who', 'got', 'worst', 'way', 'out', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'NOT', 'A', 'MAN', 'OF', 'GOD', 'thus', 'silenced', 'away', 'mental', 'asylum', 'Indeed', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'question', 'most', 'light', 'most', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'movie', 'others', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'movies', 'only', 'liability', 'climatic', 'ending', 'something', 'Bergman=esque', 'logic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', 'go', 'appropriate', 'timing', 'akin', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Personally', 'felt', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Bergman', 'logic', 'instead', 'Kesey', 'spirit', 'here', 'there', 'bulk', 'film', 'passionate', 'drama', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'eye-opening', 'view', 'old-time', 'old-time', 'up', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'Catholic', 'ways', 'also', 'great', 'dangers', 'control', 'human', 'life']",N/A

The nuns lock them in at night, dress them in plain clothes and make fun of their bodies at bath time.

Totally different look, TOTALLY different character on screen, but that same inner-something that makes her an effective & captivating actress.The film is about the real-life scandal of a Roman Catholic institution for wayward women that is something like a cross between THE EXORCIST and a concentration camp. This plays out in the 1960's. Ireland was very conservative socially (still is in some respects) and women bore the brunt of its restrictions. Some of the other people who reviewed the movie felt that it was unjustly prejudiced against the Roman Catholic Church & presented demonized portraits of the nuns in charge of the girls/women.I was in parochial school in the US during the same time period. The school was pretty liberal (all things considered), racially diverse, Judaism was presented in a favorable light, etc. The nuns were pretty ""normal"" and most of them were well liked by the students. Personally, I only had a problem with one Sister--and she was really warped & nasty. She certainly had her highly repressive pincers into me. However, nothing like what it must have been like to have been an Irish girl virtually held in bondage by [...] bureaucrats.THE MAGDALENE SISTERS is a vivid journey into a dark well of cruelty & the grossest hypocrisy. The women trapped in this pit are forced to find the strength within themselves to literally break out. Some make it, some don't.It's a brilliant film that is so real, most people won't want to see again.Hence the 4 stars rather than 5.Maybe that's just me not wishing to revisit a place of shame...Tears of Stone",4,A Place of Shame,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2386,"['watched', 'film', 'researching', 'tie-in', 'subjects', 'September', 'Greeting', 'page', 'moment', 'synchronicity', 'also', 'found', 'answer', 'sorts', 'something', 'had', 'puzzled', 'just', 'recently', 'well', 'more', 'less', 'reviewed', 'TEARS', 'OF', 'STONE', 'Chieftains', 'CD', 'featured', 'song', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'titled', 'Magdalene', 'Laundries', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'crafted', 'songs', 'JM', 'had', 'composed', 'was', 'curious', 'title', 'subject', 'matter', 'viewing', 'THE', 'MAGDALENE', 'SISTERS', 'experienced', 'one', 'Ah', 'so', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'Mitchell', 'song', 'not', 'movie.Another', 'one', 'moments', 'quickly', 'followed', 'when', 'new', 'character', 'was', 'introduced', 'film', 'thought', 'Hmm', 'familiar', 'course', 'was', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'portraying', 'one', 'Magdalene', 'victims', 'Totally', 'different', 'look', 'TOTALLY', 'different', 'character', 'screen', 'same', 'inner-something', 'effective', 'captivating', 'actress.The', 'film', 'real-life', 'scandal', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'institution', 'wayward', 'women', 'something', 'cross', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'concentration', 'camp', 'out', '1960', 'Ireland', 'was', 'very', 'conservative', 'socially', 'still', 'respects', 'women', 'bore', 'brunt', 'restrictions', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'unjustly', 'prejudiced', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'presented', 'demonized', 'portraits', 'nuns', 'charge', 'girls/women.I', 'was', 'parochial', 'school', 'US', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'school', 'was', 'pretty', 'liberal', 'things', 'considered', 'racially', 'diverse', 'Judaism', 'was', 'presented', 'favorable', 'light', 'etc', 'nuns', 'were', 'pretty', 'normal', 'most', 'were', 'well', 'liked', 'students', 'Personally', 'only', 'had', 'problem', 'one', 'Sister', 'was', 'really', 'warped', 'nasty', 'certainly', 'had', 'highly', 'repressive', 'pincers', 'However', 'nothing', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'been', 'Irish', 'girl', 'virtually', 'held', 'bondage', '[', 'bureaucrats.THE', 'MAGDALENE', 'SISTERS', 'vivid', 'journey', 'dark', 'well', 'cruelty', 'grossest', 'hypocrisy', 'women', 'trapped', 'pit', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'strength', 'literally', 'break', 'out', 'make', ""don't.It"", 'brilliant', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5.Maybe', 'just', 'not', 'wishing', 'revisit', 'place', 'shame', 'Tears', 'Stone']",N/A

No movie has ever touched me as ""The Magdalene Sisters"" did.First, let me just say that all the men in this movie are disgusting, repugnant COWARDS!! The men can do no wrong while the ladies have to sacrifice for no apparent reason. That is terribly unjust.The Magdalene House is a jail-like home. It's run by pedophile priests that enjoy taking advantage of handicapped ladies and sadistic nuns that get personal pleasure out of abusing the ladies that live there.The movie revolves around 3 young ladies that were sent to a Magdalene House; each for different reasons. One of the young ladies was raped, another was too pretty, and another had a child out of wedlock. What exactly was their crime that caused them to be locked up for years and years you might be asking? After all, they were being punished and told that they were good-for-nothing sinners! Their crime was: female sexuality! Apparently, the Catholic Church of Ireland found that to be the ultimate crime. And, as a result they punished these poor young ladies mercilessly.There is only one shining light in this very evil movie. That is at the very end when two of the young ladies escape. They were courageous enough to get out and free themselves of all beatings, hate, and sexual abuse.Thousands of women more were enslaved in these concentration camps until their pitiful deaths.

One was raped by a cousin, one was a virgin but the nuns who ran the orphanage she lived in judged her a temptress, the third had a boyfriend and eventually a baby. These young women slaved in laundries run by the nuns under conditions of unbelievable cruelty and isolation. Beatings, shaving heads, and psychological and sexual abuse were all used by the nuns to keep the young women in line.This film caused quite a stir when it came out. It's hard to believe it's true, even harder to believe the story opens in 1968 and the last laundry only closed in the mid-90's. As a veteran of eight years of education by the nuns during the 60's here in the US, I can happily report that I experienced none of this, although I still remember the day in 5th grade when a nun went around with her scissors cutting the bangs of the girls because she thought they covered too much of the forehead.

As much abuse and crulty were inflicted on these women as was in virtually any war throughout history,the very thought sickens me to no end.This is the result of when religion has too great a power over society(much like the problems we are seeing today)to the point where they dictate the every day commings and goings of an individuals life.In my opinion, not much good has ever come from religion,and for every good deed done,it not nearly enough makes up for the suffering it has inflicted upon others.These people who have made it their life's work to serve ""god"" and his will and were suppose to care about those who needed it most.Instead, they inflicted suffering that I can barely imagine.Margret,Bernadette and Rose all ended up in the same Magdeline institudion.Margret for being raped, Rose for having a baby out of wed lock and Bernadette merely for being ""beautiful""(and she was gorgeous) and flirtatious and ""invoking"" the sinful acts of men and boys.Over the course of a few years,these three women suffered beatings,torture and intollerable abuse.It wasn't long before Bernadette was trying to find a means to escaping.Margrett was finally freed by her younger brother while Rose and Bernadette who had no family to go back to were left behind.Finally after decinding she had enough,Bernadette and Rose escape.I so much wanted Bernadette to jam those scissors into that nun's neck(but it's not that kind of film).All three of these women and countless others experience had been pernamentally scarred leaving them bitter towards the church(and for good reason).The last Magdeline House was officially closed in 1996!Unbelieveable.This is a hard and uncomfortable film to watch,but true to life as it is.The Magdeline Sisters is a heart breaking film and the extra's on the the DVD are well worth watching as much as the film where some of the real women are interviewed.I certainly have an even more bitter,resentful and ""displeased"" opinion towards religion in general now more than ever before.The Magdeline Sisters is worth every penny and every minute of your attention... and I hope that when you are done watching it,you will be as angry and moved as I was.",4,Unmentionable cruelty inflicted by religon,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2343,"['Magdeline', 'sisters', 'fact', 'based', 'film', 'based', 'lives', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'who', 'haphazzardly', 'were', 'imprisioned', 'Magdeline', 'institutions', 'Ireland', 'much', 'abuse', 'crulty', 'were', 'inflicted', 'women', 'was', 'virtually', 'war', 'history', 'very', 'thought', 'sickens', 'end.This', 'result', 'when', 'religion', 'too', 'great', 'power', 'society', 'much', 'problems', 'are', 'seeing', 'today', 'point', 'where', 'dictate', 'day', 'commings', 'goings', 'individuals', 'life.In', 'opinion', 'not', 'much', 'good', 'ever', 'come', 'religion', 'good', 'deed', 'done', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'up', 'suffering', 'inflicted', 'others.These', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'work', 'serve', 'god', 'will', 'were', 'suppose', 'care', 'who', 'needed', 'most.Instead', 'inflicted', 'suffering', 'can', 'barely', 'imagine.Margret', 'Bernadette', 'Rose', 'ended', 'up', 'same', 'Magdeline', 'institudion.Margret', 'being', 'raped', 'Rose', 'having', 'baby', 'wed', 'lock', 'Bernadette', 'merely', 'being', 'beautiful', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'flirtatious', 'invoking', 'sinful', 'acts', 'men', 'boys.Over', 'course', 'few', 'years', 'three', 'women', 'suffered', 'beatings', 'torture', 'intollerable', 'abuse.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Bernadette', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'means', 'escaping.Margrett', 'was', 'finally', 'freed', 'younger', 'brother', 'Rose', 'Bernadette', 'who', 'had', 'family', 'go', 'back', 'were', 'left', 'behind.Finally', 'decinding', 'had', 'enough', 'Bernadette', 'Rose', 'escape.I', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'Bernadette', 'jam', 'scissors', 'nun', 'neck', 'not', 'kind', 'film', '.All', 'three', 'women', 'countless', 'others', 'experience', 'had', 'been', 'pernamentally', 'scarred', 'leaving', 'bitter', 'church', 'good', 'reason', '.The', 'last', 'Magdeline', 'House', 'was', 'officially', 'closed', '1996', 'Unbelieveable.This', 'hard', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'watch', 'true', 'life', 'Magdeline', 'Sisters', 'heart', 'breaking', 'film', 'extra', 'DVD', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'where', 'real', 'women', 'are', 'interviewed.I', 'certainly', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'bitter', 'resentful', 'displeased', 'opinion', 'towards', 'religion', 'general', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'before.The', 'Magdeline', 'Sisters', 'worth', 'penny', 'minute', 'attention', 'hope', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'angry', 'moved', 'was']",N/A

769602,A63T5DNBZ3O3S,B0000AZVEN,klingsithvamp,"[13, 16]","This is an incredibly depressing story, so much more so because it's basically true.  It pulls no punches (that I am aware of).  The tone of this movie is oppressive, in all aspects.  From the dim, earthen shades of costumes, sets, and backgrounds, to the trudging, prodigious score, and to the dialog and storyline itself, this film is a deep, dark pit.  So, why five stars?  Stories like this need to be told; and when they are, that telling needs to be done right (as, I feel was the case here).I commend the screen writer(s) especially, for their work.  Often, writers will underestimate the importance of what is not said, filling the silences, in a unnecessary effort to explain everything to the audience.  That is far from the case here.  So, in turn, must I applaud the performances of all these women.  Their body language and expressions spoke volumes that could not have been conveyed with an equal amount of words.  Most of what was not said, and perhaps most interesting was the psychological motivations of the characters.Bernadette's character was certainly the easiest to understand.  She wore her emotions on her sleeve, and even voiced them once or twice.  Though she exhibited the most strength and showed initiative, I think her rage made her naive.  It took four plus years before she fully recognized her predicament.  Too, for much of the movie her actions were driven by a belief that the other girls deserved to be there, whereas she did not (though, I suppose this could have been a delusion to maintain her sanity).  Why did it never occur to her that some of them might be as guiltless as herself.Additional:  It seems everyone is saying that this character had the most depth.  As good as the actress' performance was, I simply disagree.  I submit that other reviewers were drawn to the character because of the performer's obvious beauty (a concept reinforced by the DVD cover - which belies the seriousness of the subject), and the spirited persona of the role.  Don't misunderstand, this was a wonderfully done part; but, if you thought hers was the most ponderous, finish my review, and try watching the movie again.The character of Rose / Patricia (by virtue of writing, not acting) came across as blah.  In the unforgiving eyes of her society, she was the only one of the three main characters who actually belonged there.  Her motivations appear rooted in faith:  her lifetime (and circumstantially questionable) faith in the Catholic church, her (assumed) faith in the good intentions of her baby's father, faith that her parents knew what was best for her, faith that the nuns were just and compassionate, and so on.  Clearly, she was an easily persuaded follower, uncomfortable asserting herself.  This held true throughout her story.I think Margaret was the character most difficult to understand.  After being raped by her cousin, she spoke up (in limited fashion) in an attempt to find justice.  For her trouble, her parents and priest sent her away to the convent / workhouse.  What message did she learn from this?  Presumably, that (in that time and place) it would have been best to keep quiet and save face.  Also, that her value, as an honest women, to her family and community was less than that of an incestuous male rapist.  These lessons seem borne out in her subsequent actions.  Her lashing out at her brother, having nothing to do with him as an individual, but rather, being confounded by the fact that he should command respect by gender alone.  This anger, and likely a measure of mistrust, seem evident in that she never married.  Even more subtle, were the effects to her self worth.  Her attack on Bernadette, and inability to free herself, revealed misguided guilt and self-loathing.  It was as if she were trying to strike back at the person she believed most responsible for her incarceration:  herself.  Margaret's emotions manifest themselves as a need for acceptance by a group or authority (ie. mob mentality in the fight, viewing Una as a role model, being Crispina's caretaker, and seeking the nuns' approval).  This is also indicated by her eventual career choice.I suspect that the childlike character of Crispina was born with a mental deficiency.  While it is possible that she was beaten senseless while under the nuns' care, it is more likely that she was taken advantage of, and placed in Magdalene so that it would not happen again.  Given the means of her aunt, and affections of her sister, it seems unlikely (or unthinkable) that her family was aware of conditions in the convent / workhouse.  The real irony being, even locked away (and the nuns had to have known) she was still being taken advantage of.Finally, we come to the nuns (and priests).  Greed and abuse of power are nothing new to this world, but to act as they did while proclaiming the name of Jesus Christ, is grotesquely appalling.  But, I suppose when you look at the history of organized religion, that's nothing new either.  Until the people of the world learn to love and respect one another as the Lord has shown us, there will continue to be stories like The Magdalene Sisters.",5,"It's like Shawshank, without

769603,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000AZVEN,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","With all the publicity and criticism swirling around the best selling novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" one of the historical corrections that has emerged is the idea that Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute.  The idea came from a sermon given at the end of the 6th century in which Pope Gregory the Great characterized Mary Magdalene as a harlot and has endured for centuries.  One of the ways in which the idea that Magdalene was the archetypal ""fallen woman"" was perpetuated was through the Magdalene Laundries that flourished in Ireland under the Sisters of Mercy for most of the 20th century.  In the prologue of this 2002 film we meet three young Irish girls who take different paths to end up being sent to one of the Magdalene asylums and since only one of the three truly qualifies as a ""fallen woman,"" we appreciate the grim irony that there reputations had fallen prey to hysteria over sex in the same way that Mary Magdalene has been libeled by history.The DVD of this film includes an original expose ""Sex in a Cold Climate,"" the 1998 documentary that served as the inspiration for Peter Mullan's film.  My strong recommendation is to watch the film first, because otherwise you will be thinking about how what was talked about in the documentary is being shown in the film.  However, the documentary is quite effective in its own way, even thought it consists mostly of four old women talking about what happened to them almost half a century ago and telling their heartbreaking stories.  If anything, the documentary will outrage you more than the film, another reason for watching it afterwards.""The Magdalene Sisters"" was denounced by the Catholic League as being anti-Catholic, and my obvious response after watching the film is that if this is what the Catholic church in Ireland was doing to these women, then it deserves to be attacked.  However, it seems clear that even without explicitly making the case that this film is specifically an indictment of Irish Catholics, which extends to not just the cruel nuns running this asylum.  This is a culture than blames young women for being raped, considers flirting by a young girl to be the equivalent of actual fornication, and where parents will brutally turn their backs on their daughters for their sins.  The nuns have their moments, but the true moment of despair comes when a father drags his daughter back to this evil place telling her ""you killed us"" and threatening to cripple her if she dares to ever return to the place she still thinks is her home.We are introduced to three women in the opening of the film, Margaret (Ann-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), and Rose (Dorothy Duffy), although when they come to the asylum there is a fourth girl who is equally prominent, the simpleminded Crispina (Eileen Walsh).  This is a film about surviving a harrowing experience, but since over 30,000 young girls were given over to serve in slavery in these places, of course not everyone got out and was able to claim some sort of life in the real world.  The fact that Mullan uses unfamiliar faces, the exception being Geraldine McEwan as the chief harpy, Sister Bridget, works to make the situation seem more really, since we cannot think of these young actresses as anyone other than the young unfortunates that they are playing.At face value ""The Magdalene Sisters"" is reminiscent of your standard prison film, with the girls trying to survive and win some small victories against the nuns and the system.  But for most of the film every time the girls get a little of their own back, Mullan makes sure they are subjected to some new indignity.  A happy ending is only a relative term in a film such as this.  Some have charged that the portrait of the nuns in this film is rather one sided since they show no compassion towards their charges.  But this was a world that did not allow compassion towards these women and the asylum was really no different from what they faced outside its walls.  Still, to think of nuns in Ireland operating with the ruthless efficiency of the Taliban is rather upsetting.  Fortunately the last of these laundries closed; but not until 1996, two years before a documentary exposed their sins to the world.",4,The horror story of the Magdalene asylums in Ireland,1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,4216,"['publicity', 'criticism', 'swirling', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'one', 'historical', 'corrections', 'emerged', 'idea', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'was', 'not', 'prostitute', 'idea', 'came', 'sermon', 'given', 'end', '6th', 'century', 'Pope', 'Gregory', 'Great', 'characterized', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'harlot', 'endured', 'centuries', 'One', 'ways', 'idea', 'Magdalene', 'was', 'archetypal', 'fallen', 'woman', 'was', 'perpetuated', 'was', 'Magdalene', 'Laundries', 'flourished', 'Ireland', 'Sisters', 'Mercy', 'most', '20th', 'century', 'prologue', '2002', 'film', 'meet', 'three', 'young', 'Irish', 'girls', 'who', 'take', 'different', 'paths', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'sent', 'one', 'Magdalene', 'asylums', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'truly', 'qualifies', 'fallen', 'woman', 'appreciate', 'grim', 'irony', 'reputations', 'had', 'fallen', 'prey', 'hysteria', 'over', 'sex', 'same', 'way', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'been', 'libeled', 'history.The', 'DVD', 'film', 'original', 'expose', 'Sex', 'Cold', 'Climate', '1998', 'documentary', 'served', 'inspiration', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'film', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'how', 'what', 'was', 'talked', 'documentary', 'being', 'shown', 'film', 'However', 'documentary', 'quite', 'effective', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'thought', 'mostly', 'four', 'old', 'women', 'talking', 'what', 'happened', 'almost', 'century', 'ago', 'telling', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'anything', 'documentary', 'will', 'outrage', 'more', 'film', 'reason', 'watching', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'was', 'denounced', 'Catholic', 'League', 'being', 'anti-Catholic', 'obvious', 'response', 'watching', 'film', 'what', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Ireland', 'was', 'doing', 'women', 'then', 'be', 'attacked', 'However', 'clear', 'even', 'explicitly', 'making', 'case', 'film', 'specifically', 'indictment', 'Irish', 'Catholics', 'not', 'just', 'cruel', 'nuns', 'running', 'asylum', 'culture', 'blames', 'young', 'women', 'being', 'raped', 'considers', 'flirting', 'young', 'girl', 'be', 'equivalent', 'actual', 'fornication', 'where', 'parents', 'will', 'brutally', 'turn', 'backs', 'daughters', 'sins', 'nuns', 'have', 'moments', 'true', 'moment', 'despair', 'when', 'father', 'daughter', 'back', 'evil', 'place', 'telling', 'killed', 'threatening', 'cripple', 'ever', 'return', 'place', 'still', 'home.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'three', 'women', 'opening', 'film', 'Margaret', 'Ann-Marie', 'Duff', 'Bernadette', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Rose', 'Dorothy', 'Duffy', 'when', 'come', 'asylum', 'fourth', 'girl', 'who', 'equally', 'prominent', 'simpleminded', 'Crispina', 'Eileen', 'Walsh', 'film', 'surviving', 'harrowing', 'experience', '30,000', 'young', 'girls', 'were', 'given', 'serve', 'slavery', 'places', 'course', 'not', 'everyone', 'got', 'out', 'was', 'able', 'claim', 'sort', 'life', 'real', 'world', 'fact', 'Mullan', 'unfamiliar', 'exception', 'being', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'chief', 'harpy', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'make', 'situation', 'seem', 'more', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'young', 'actresses', 'anyone', 'other', 'young', 'unfortunates', 'are', 'playing.At', 'face', 'value', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'reminiscent', 'standard', 'prison', 'film', 'girls', 'trying', 'survive', 'win', 'small', 'victories', 'nuns', 'system', 'most', 'film', 'time', 'girls', 'get', 'little', 'own', 'back', 'Mullan', 'sure', 'are', 'subjected', 'new', 'indignity', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'relative', 'term', 'film', 'such', 'have', 'charged', 'portrait', 'nuns', 'film', 'rather', 'one', 'sided', 'show', 'compassion', 'charges', 'was', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'compassion', 'women', 'asylum', 'was', 'really', 'different', 'what', 'faced', 'walls', 'Still', 'think', 'nuns', 'Ireland', 'operating', 'ruthless', 'efficiency', 'Taliban', 'rather', 'upsetting', 'Fortunately', 'last', 'laundries', 'closed', 'not', '1996', 'two', 'years', 'documentary', 'exposed', 'sins', 'world']",N/A
769604,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0000AZVEN,Linda Linguvic,"[10, 11]","This Irish film is based on the true stories of young women who, in the 1970s, were sent to a Magdalene home.  There were many of these homes in Ireland then, run by nuns where ""fallen women"" were sent to repent their sins.  And the sins were as simple as being too pretty, or having young man attack you or giving birth to an illegitimate baby. Once there, some of them stayed for a lifetime.The abuse from the nuns was unlimited.  The women, called penitents, were prisoners, forced to labor in a the laundries run by the nuns.  They worked six days a week from dawn to dusk.  There was no recreation, constant harassment and humiliation.  They were beaten for any infraction of a rule and had their hair shaved for disobedience.  And even if they behaved themselves they were subject to the nuns' cruelty.  In one of the most chilling scenes, the penitents are forced to stand in a line, nude, in front of the nuns.  The nuns giggle and laugh and make fun of the naked women's bodies, taunting them about such things as size of breasts or degree of hairiness.The film traces three women who were forced into the home as teenagers  It was awful.  Yet, as a film, it was perfect inasmuch as I forgot about the film techniques and just simply identified with the women and forgot they were acting and that this was a movie.  By the end of the film, the women had spent four years in the home and each one has managed to get away.  I should have been happy about this but couldn't help thinking about all those who never got away.The film is very upsetting.  And yet I recommend it.  If nothing else, those of us who never experienced such horrors will appreciate some aspects of our own lives that we take for granted.**The film is based on a documentary, ""Sex in a Cold Climate, "" that was aired on Irish television in 1998.  The DVD included the entire 50 minutes of documentary.  This was even more upsetting that the fictional film because this was real.  It featured women, now in the 60s or older, telling their horror stories of having spent many years with the Magdelenes.  One women had her 10-month old nursing baby torn from her arms.  She's spent a lifetime searching for this child and finally reunited with him many years later.  Another woman was sent to the home simply because she was pretty.  After she got out she had an unsuccessful marriage because she never got over the lessons taught by the nuns, which shaped her view of men.  They talked about feeling unworthy and how their experience warped their lives forever.  It was chilling.If you can stomach it, try to see the film and as well as the documentary on the DVD.  You will never look at the world quite in the same way again.",5,Watching these horrors made me appreciate my own life,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,2705,"['Irish', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'young', 'women', 'who', '1970s', 'were', 'sent', 'Magdalene', 'home', 'were', 'many', 'homes', 'Ireland', 'then', 'run', 'nuns', 'where', 'fallen', 'women', 'were', 'sent', 'repent', 'sins', 'sins', 'were', 'as', 'simple', 'being', 'too', 'pretty', 'having', 'young', 'man', 'attack', 'giving', 'birth', 'illegitimate', 'baby', 'Once', 'stayed', 'lifetime.The', 'abuse', 'nuns', 'was', 'unlimited', 'women', 'called', 'penitents', 'were', 'prisoners', 'forced', 'labor', 'laundries', 'run', 'nuns', 'worked', 'six', 'days', 'week', 'dawn', 'dusk', 'was', 'recreation', 'constant', 'harassment', 'humiliation', 'were', 'beaten', 'infraction', 'rule', 'had', 'hair', 'shaved', 'disobedience', 'even', 'behaved', 'were', 'subject', 'nuns', 'cruelty', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'penitents', 'are', 'forced', 'stand', 'line', 'nude', 'front', 'nuns', 'nuns', 'giggle', 'laugh', 'make', 'fun', 'naked', 'women', 'bodies', 'taunting', 'such', 'things', 'size', 'breasts', 'degree', 'hairiness.The', 'film', 'traces', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'home', 'teenagers', 'was', 'awful', 'Yet', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'inasmuch', 'forgot', 'film', 'techniques', 'just', 'simply', 'identified', 'women', 'forgot', 'were', 'acting', 'was', 'movie', 'end', 'film', 'women', 'had', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'home', 'one', 'managed', 'get', 'away', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'away.The', 'film', 'very', 'upsetting', 'yet', 'recommend', 'nothing', 'else', 'who', 'never', 'experienced', 'such', 'horrors', 'will', 'appreciate', 'aspects', 'own', 'lives', 'take', 'granted', '**The', 'film', 'based', 'documentary', 'Sex', 'Cold', 'Climate', 'was', 'aired', 'Irish', 'television', '1998', 'DVD', 'included', 'entire', '50', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'upsetting', 'fictional', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'featured', 'women', 'now', '60s', 'older', 'telling', 'horror', 'stories', 'having', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'Magdelenes', 'One', 'women', 'had', '10-month', 'old', 'nursing', 'baby', 'torn', 'arms', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'searching', 'child', 'finally', 'reunited', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'woman', 'was', 'sent', 'home', 'simply', 'was', 'pretty', 'got', 'out', 'had', 'unsuccessful', 'marriage', 'never', 'got', 'lessons', 'taught', 'nuns', 'shaped', 'view', 'men', 'talked', 'feeling', 'unworthy', 'how', 'experience', 'warped', 'lives', 'forever', 'was', 'chilling.If', 'can', 'stomach', 'try', 'see', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'world', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'again']",N/A
769605,A2MG8DHACXH5MS,B0000AZVEN,"Lola Jovita ""Literary Fan""","[1, 2]","The last of the laundries were closed in 1996 ... just four years before the millennium of the 21st century. What is frightening here is the extremism that dominates the message of how far the laundries went to punish wayward girls. In life extremes of any kind are dangerous whether it be dogmatic or hedonistic.For the four fallen women it is an experience of appalling slavery in the hands of the very institution that should have helped them. It is an excessive concept of shame and punitiveness that caused a loss of redemption in any case. For one who has fallen it is the remedy of redemption in the true Christian spirit of ministry which can be saving grace. These laundries were not it.This film captures an era in Ireland when the Church was the State and one false move meant a lifetime banishment into slave labor. The intention was not to redeem, reform, or rehabilitate a person but to break their will and spirit, so contrary to the Christian notion of compassion and forgiveness.Three girls are sentenced to the Magdalene laundry as virtual prisoners of the Nuns. What is an underlying theme is the fight between the females through the polarization of good girl versus bad girl. The nuns, in their seething repression, inflict psychological torture along with physical abuse on their wards whose crimes constitute sins of the flesh. Bernadette is too flirty, Rose was raped, and Margaret and Crispina have given birth to an illegitimate child. The intention to redeem someone of their wrongful ways goes way too twisted in this film. The remedy for a troubled person getting into trouble may be love and even tough love but never torture and indignation. The laundries were a form of two wrongs trying to make a right. Ironic because Jesus was known to extend compassion and love to the very people whom the High Priests in Judea ostracized and were willing to stone to death.The setting of this film in the Republic of Ireland is poignant as it remains one of the few very Catholic states still. Catholicism as any other church has its moments of a dark history but these laundries are probably one of the saddest and most tragic. The perversion of teachings is what does in the Catholic laundries as it did the maternity wards for pregnant teens during the same era. For all the good churches can do ... all it takes is a few dark periods ... to ruin it all.

However, it is a story that needs to be told.  It focuses on three girls who are sent to the Magdalene asylum.  Some are sent there pregnant and some are sent simply because they are attractive and might become pregnant.  What is more amazing is that although this story takes place in the early 1960's, the asylum was not abolished until 1996.The story line follows the typical drudgery filled days of heavy laundry labor and constant silence and atonement.  All the actors are superb and the setting is pure dreariness set against the occasional glimpse of the beautiful Irish countryside just outside the doors.  The main actresses vary in their manner and tolerance beset against unbelievably cruel and sadistic nuns.  Emotional beratement, humiliation and severe beatings are regular occurrences and only the strongest of the women survive - and even then, that is another story.  The final fate of one of the more `slower' girls is beyond heart breaking.  Note: Language and full nudity accent the reality of the film.Accompanying this DVD is a fantastic documentary called, ""Sex On A Cold Climate"", with commentaries from survivors of the asylum.

Using religion to oppress people is nothing new, but this particular story is shocking because the practice only ended in 1996. Not only that, but the girls' parents willingly signed them over to this miserable existence.I watched this movie with a clenched jaw because I was so angry to see what happened to these young women under the guise of reforming them. Did those nuns really believe that bull about the inmates (they were imprisoned for all intents and purposes) being able to work off their sins there so that they could go to heaven when they died, or was this just something that they spewed for the sake of seeming pious? The girls ate meager meals in a dark, grungy dining room while listening to religious recitations. Meanwhile, the nuns were in the next room dining off china and fine linens.Abandoned by their families, these girls were humiliated and worked non-stop. The beatings were brutal, yet the mental abuse was just as bad. There was also sexual abuse and some perverse game where the nuns made the girls line up naked and compared their body parts. It's terrible stuff. The head nun was an evil witch who felt morally superior to all the girls and treated them like wayward whores.

To watch the suffering on screen makes you so glad that the last laundry was closed down in 1996.The three main characters are introduced at the start of the film. Three very young girls. Margaret is brutally raped at a wedding, and rather than getting sympathy when she confides in someone. Rose gives birth to a baby, which her parents won't look at, and force her into putting it up for adoption. Interestingly, she doesn't have an abortion, because that would have been a 'sin'. Bernadette, an orphan, who does nothing wrong, except she looks pretty and gets attention from the guys. All three of them get a transfer to the asylum, without having a say in it.Not many others of the asylum inmates are featured as heavily as these three, but one is, Crispina, a young woman with a young son, who descends gradually throughout the film into irreversible and fatal madness. She somehow manages to get herself involved with one of the priests, which ultimately leads to her downfall when the rest of the nuns, and inmates find out.In the Magdalene asylum (named after Mary Magdalene of course), the girls are subjected to mental and physical abuse.

The original purpose of the ten Magdalene Laundries that were established in Ireland in the 19th century was to reform prostitutes. Women were imprisoned by the State and Church and expected to do penance for their sins through hard work and prayer. By 1930, instead of being populated by former prostitutes, Ireland's Magdalene Laundries were occupied primarily by unwed mothers whose families had rejected them. An estimated 30,000 Irish women were detained in the Laundries during the 20th century, until the last one closed in 1996, and were used as a slave labor force, working from dawn until dusk to turn a profit for the Order that  administered the Laundries.""The Magdalene Sisters"" tells the stories of Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), who is sent away from her home after being raped at a family wedding, Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), whose caretakers at the orphanage where she grew up banish her to the Laundry to prevent her good looks from causing any trouble, and Rose (Dorothy Duffy), who is scorned by her family after bearing a child out of wedlock. These three teenagers arrive at the Magdalene asylum at the same time and together bear its abuses and indignities over the course of years. The three lead actresses give fine performances. Geraldine McEwan and Eileen Walsh give stand-out performances as Sister Bridget, chief administrator of the asylum, and Crispina, a mentally challenged inmate, respectively. The film does portray the Irish Catholic Church in a bad light -at least the small part of it that we see. But the Church fares no worse than the government that supported the imprisonment of women who had committed no crime or, even more appalling, the self-righteous, hideously self-absorbed  parents who delivered their children into imprisonment and slavery because they were afraid of what the neighbors would think. ""The Magdalene Sisters"" presents interesting intertwined stories about a very unfortunate slice of Irish history.The DVD: This disc's single bonus feature is the inaptly titled 50-minute documentary ""Sex in a Cold Climate"". This is an original British documentary film which inspired writer/director Peter Mullan to write ""The Magdalene Sisters"". The documentary features the stories of three women who were confined in Magdalene Laundries in their youth, and one woman who grew up in an orphanage that adjoined one of the Laundries. It's unclear to me whether these women were the basis for the characters in the ""The Magdalene Sisters"" or not. Their stories are similar enough to those in the movie to make me think so, yet they differ in timing and details. For the feature film, subtitles are available in French and Spanish, and captions are available in English. Dubbing is available in French.

769617,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B0000AZVEN,"""mobby_uk""","[7, 7]","The Magdalene Sisters is one of the best films I have ever seen, one that has deeply touched and moved me like few films managed to do, certainly at least in the last decade.I love the film for two reasons,Firstly, because it is a very brave and bold criticism of the  religious establishment's hypocrisies and corruption, that very few filmmakers addressed. The fact that the story of the Magdalene Sisters happened for real makes it more outrageous and its exposure more poignant for the changed sensitivities of the twenty first century man and woman regardless of their own denomination or faith.The second reason why I love the film so much, is simply because it is extremely well directed, scripted and acted. No matter how real or interesting the plot is, the viewer would connect and appreciate it much less had the storytelling, writing, and performances been not up to standard, but most definitely actor turned director Peter Mullan with his wonderful cast managed to remain totally faithful and sympathetic to their subject matter with no unnecessary sentimentality, and as a result producing a masterpiece of gritty realism, and a shout of defiance at the overbearingly repressive regimes of religious establishments.The story of the Magdalene Sisters is tragic:There was a time in Ireland, not so long ago, when 'fallen' women, those who 'sin' and have babies out of the 'sacred' wedlock,and even those who are simply suspected of harboring any sexual thoughts were sent to a prison-like place run by the Magdalene sisters to cleanse their sins and 'redirect' them to the true path, the only accepted path of the church, not unlike Medieval times.The sad fact is that these women had no other place to go after their own parents banished them in 'shame' for what they have done or were thinking of doing!!!The place where the women slave all day to do the laundry for nearby institutions becomes indeed like a slave/concentration camp, at the head of which a sadistic and mentally unbalanced mother superior presides.The women endure hardships and cruelty beyond imagination, and they are humiliated, scorned, and dehumanized all in the name of the 'Lord'!But of course, the place also hides some sinister secrets, a fornicating priest who was accidentally caught in the act, and a mean and ambitiously rich mother superior who goes mad with rage looking for the key to her safe..The fate of these women is mainly told through the individual stories of four women, and four brilliant actresses, Anne Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone, Dorothy Duffy and Eileen Walsh, while the mother superior/Warden is played to perfection by the great Geraldine McEwan whose reminded me a bit of Nurse Fletcher.There are so many very powerful scenes in the film, but three have firmly stuck in my mind,After the priest's act is secretly exposed between the women, and at an open air reception, Crispina/Eileen Walsh suddenly stands up and repeats many times in a frustrated, angry tone and as if in a trance: 'You are not a man of God!' over and over and over again..A second scene will probably not be out of place in any concentration camp movie,(it slightly reminded me of the degradations of Pasolini's Salo) when all the women are lined up totally naked and are mocked and humiliated by two nuns, comparing and laughing at the women's bodies!A third scene ,the last one in the film, we see Nora-Jane Noone, now finally out (I will not reveal how..you have to watch the movie), and dressed conservatively, hair in a bun, and nervously waits for the bus, looking over her shoulder, slightly paranoid that people might know her secret, and right in front of her, two nuns are sitting. At first she avoids eye contact and is clearly agitated..but then with a show of defiance and the ultimate statement of the film, she let her hair loose and looks at them straight in the eye, a look of fury mixed with  confidence! Wow!The Magdalene Sisters is therefore a masterpiece that should be in the collection of any one who,like myself, love good cinema, and abhors the injustices and hypocrisies that these brave women have faced just for the biggest sin they have committed by being simply 'humans'.",5,'You Are Not A Man Of God!',1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,4189,"['Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'deeply', 'touched', 'moved', 'few', 'films', 'managed', 'do', 'certainly', 'least', 'last', 'decade.I', 'love', 'film', 'two', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'very', 'brave', 'bold', 'criticism', 'religious', 'establishment', 'hypocrisies', 'corruption', 'very', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'addressed', 'fact', 'story', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'happened', 'real', 'more', 'outrageous', 'exposure', 'more', 'poignant', 'changed', 'sensitivities', 'twenty', 'first', 'century', 'man', 'woman', 'regardless', 'own', 'denomination', 'faith.The', 'second', 'reason', 'why', 'love', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'simply', 'extremely', 'well', 'directed', 'scripted', 'acted', 'matter', 'how', 'real', 'interesting', 'plot', 'viewer', 'would', 'connect', 'appreciate', 'much', 'less', 'had', 'storytelling', 'writing', 'performances', 'been', 'not', 'standard', 'most', 'definitely', 'actor', 'turned', 'director', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'managed', 'remain', 'totally', 'faithful', 'sympathetic', 'subject', 'matter', 'unnecessary', 'sentimentality', 'result', 'producing', 'masterpiece', 'gritty', 'realism', 'shout', 'defiance', 'overbearingly', 'repressive', 'regimes', 'religious', 'establishments.The', 'story', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'tragic', 'was', 'time', 'Ireland', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'women', 'who', ""'sin"", 'have', 'babies', ""'sacred"", 'wedlock', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'suspected', 'harboring', 'sexual', 'thoughts', 'were', 'sent', 'prison-like', 'place', 'run', 'Magdalene', 'sisters', 'cleanse', 'sins', ""'redirect"", 'true', 'path', 'only', 'accepted', 'path', 'church', 'not', 'Medieval', 'times.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'women', 'had', 'other', 'place', 'go', 'own', 'parents', 'banished', ""'shame"", 'what', 'have', 'done', 'were', 'thinking', 'doing', 'place', 'where', 'women', 'slave', 'day', 'do', 'laundry', 'nearby', 'institutions', 'becomes', 'indeed', 'slave/concentration', 'camp', 'head', 'sadistic', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'mother', 'superior', 'presides.The', 'women', 'endure', 'hardships', 'cruelty', 'imagination', 'are', 'humiliated', 'scorned', 'dehumanized', 'name', ""'Lord"", 'course', 'place', 'also', 'sinister', 'secrets', 'fornicating', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'accidentally', 'caught', 'act', 'mean', 'ambitiously', 'rich', 'mother', 'superior', 'who', 'mad', 'rage', 'looking', 'key', 'safe..The', 'fate', 'women', 'mainly', 'told', 'individual', 'stories', 'four', 'women', 'four', 'brilliant', 'actresses', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Dorothy', 'Duffy', 'Eileen', 'Walsh', 'mother', 'superior/Warden', 'played', 'perfection', 'great', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Nurse', 'Fletcher.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'film', 'three', 'have', 'firmly', 'stuck', 'mind', 'priest', 'act', 'secretly', 'exposed', 'women', 'open', 'air', 'reception', 'Crispina/Eileen', 'Walsh', 'suddenly', 'up', 'repeats', 'many', 'times', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'tone', 'trance', ""'You"", 'are', 'not', 'man', 'God', 'again..A', 'second', 'scene', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'place', 'concentration', 'camp', 'movie', 'slightly', 'reminded', 'degradations', 'Pasolini', 'Salo', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'lined', 'up', 'totally', 'naked', 'are', 'mocked', 'humiliated', 'two', 'nuns', 'comparing', 'laughing', 'women', 'bodies', 'third', 'scene', 'last', 'one', 'film', 'see', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'now', 'finally', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'how..you', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'dressed', 'conservatively', 'hair', 'bun', 'nervously', 'waits', 'bus', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'slightly', 'people', 'might', 'know', 'secret', 'right', 'front', 'two', 'nuns', 'are', 'sitting', 'first', 'eye', 'contact', 'clearly', 'agitated..but', 'then', 'show', 'defiance', 'ultimate', 'statement', 'film', 'let', 'hair', 'loose', 'straight', 'eye', 'look', 'fury', 'mixed', 'confidence', 'Wow', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'therefore', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'one', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'cinema', 'injustices', 'hypocrisies', 'brave', 'women', 'have', 'faced', 'just', 'biggest', 'sin', 'have', 'committed', 'being', 'simply', ""'humans""]",N/A

Divorced women were considered to be second hand merchandise.  Remember as well, that the actions of the Magdalene Sisters were generally supported by the surrounding culture.

769626,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B0000AZVEN,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[6, 6]","Pray for us.It would seem to me that putting a story to film that is primarily about wrongful persecution, incarceration, endurance of institution cruelties, and finally triumph over injustice, is pretty much like trying to walk through a mine field unscathed. Most of us have had to endure countless films of this type in the past that usually end up being little more then sappy preachy balls of cheese. What makes The Magdalene Sisters an even more precariously difficult target to hit is that the film is an almost entirely all female cast. Lets be honest for a moment, it would be a hard task indeed to find another film involving nuns and incarcerated women that is not of the sleazy nunsploitation/girl in prison sexploitation sub genre's. The ultimate result when you factor in the story, is that a lot could of gone wrong with this film, but instead writer/director Peter Mullen hit the bull's eye with astounding accuracy and perfection. Not once does he ever insult the viewers intellegence by ever forcing on them something when it is already obvious. Instead we have a film full of memorable female characters, of various ages and individualities.The best way to look at this film is with the eyes of an actor. When you watch The Magdalene Sisters on the merits of its various rolls and character drama's you quickly realize that the script is completely awesome. I can only imagine how the cast members must of been foaming at the mouth to land a roll in this film when their agents passed the script on to them. Not only do the three principle leads have great characters, moments, actions, and dialog, that any actor in their right mind would die for, but even the smaller rolls of the nuns stand head and shoulders above most rolls and most movies nowadays. In fact, the acting is so strong in this picture that I feel inclined to bring up the Academy Awards and toss the Oscar under the bus once and for all.You're not a man of God!In 1993, David Thewlis had the roll and performance of the entire decade of the 1990's as Johnny in Mike Leigh's Naked, but he did not win the Oscar, in fact, he did not even get nominated. In the case of The Magdalene Sisters, The Great Eileen Walsh who plays Chrispina, ( I will allways call her ""The Great"" after seeing her in this perfomance ) had the perfomance of this current decade which would make it the performance of the new century. Chrispina is doing her slave labor for the duel sins of having a baby out of wedlock and also for being a bit dim in the head. When we first meet her it is uncomfortably unnerving, as she swaps chores with Bernadette, played by Nora Jane Noone, who is incarcerated for being too pretty and flurting with boys. Possibly because Chrispina is the target of the orders head priest molestations, she refuses to wash priest collars, yet she does not mind cleaning menstrual blood out of undergarments and instead explains how to get the blood out with cold water and salt. It soon becomes clear that there is something fundamentally lacking in Chrispina while she is talking to Rose/Patricia, Dorothy Duffy. While holding a conversation in such a way that the supervising nun won't realize they are talking, since talking is another form of disobedience, Chrispina gets stuck on a word. She gets so flustered trying to remember what she wants to tell Rose/Patricia that she turns to the very nun she was trying to hide the conversation from to begin with and says to her, "" Excuse me sister! What's the word?""Unlike most of the wayward girls in that institution, Chrispina is also lacking in the normal mental fortitude that helps us more normal adaptable people withstand something like an endless boot camp. As the film progresses Chrispina starts to really unravel rapidly, indeed, every time we see her she looks more unhinged and emotionally shattered then the last time. After a while the viewer begines to wonder if there is any possible way that Chrispina could fall any deeper into dispair and look any more jacked up. It is a testimony to The Great Eileen Walsh that not only does she manage to out do our expectation, scene in and scene out, but what is actually taking place, unknown to the audience, is that the character of Chrispina has now become the very vehicle that will push the film over the climax in what is easily one of the most powerful moments I have ever seen in film.Eileen Walsh winner of The Paul Aragon Award for best sapporting actress of the decade. Its not an Oscar but hey....In Film terms, The Great Eileen Walsh has what is known as The Moment. When you think of the legendary film performances such as Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon, or Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over The Cuckcoo's Nest, it is very easy to recall The Moment in both these land mark perfomacnes. For Pacino, it is when he yells ""Attica."" For Nicholson, it's when he invents his own World Series broadcast. The Moment in The Magdalene Sisters is when The Great Eileen Walsh yells out "" You're not a man of God!"" at the top of her lungs 24 times in a row. I would love to discus all aspects of this perfomance, but for the sake of creating too many spoilers, I have decided to instead discribe how it feels to me to endure The Moment. This in itself is causing goose bumps to appear on my arms as I type.Since The Moment takes place in a public setting, and because there are a great many separate drama's taking place all at once, the initial yelling of that line by Chrispina catches me completely off balance. Which by itself is quite julting. It is not untill around the tenth time through that line however, that I become aware of the full body chill that runs down my spine like ice water. It is around that time that two words stamp themselves into brain and stay there fixed, they are"" OH GOD!""At around the 15th time Chrisina yells that line, I find that I am gasping and that my breathing is actually labored. Then at around her 20th time yelling the line I feel a huge wave of power fly out of my TV, cross the room and into my face and body with all the force of a Mack Truck wielding a wrecking ball. In all my many years of being a hard core film buff, I can safely say that this moment in The Magdalene Sisters might be the single strongest most viscerally impacting acting outburst that I have ever experienced in my life. It felt like The Great Eileen Walsh took my soul out to the woodshed and beat it to within an inch of its life.Just like David Thewlis Oscar is sitting on a shelf somewhere in Tom Hanks house, so too that The Great Eileen Walsh's Oscar is at Renee Zellweger's house. The Magdalene Sisters, and the wonderful performances in this film ( especially the great one by The Great Eileen Walsh) prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is no award in existance that can ever have the final say so on the best anything. It is up to us film buffs to find true greatness for ourselves, and then inform others.This review was submitted so that The Great Eileen Walsh could get the recognition she truly deserves. In my mind, she has had the honor of the greatest performance of the decade.",5,Eileen Walsh as Chrispina.

769627,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0000AZVEN,PJR,"[4, 4]","The film makes no pretense that it will be easy to watch. It starts with a girl raped at a nice folksy community party and instead of the boy being strung up by the older men, their attention is on the fact that the girl has been soiled. The dirtied girl is shipped off to be incarcerated by nuns who exploit girls in their laundry business who are even suspected of having the potential to be vulnerable to sex out of marriage.From there it has the flavor of a documentary -- with scene after scene of abuse by cold-hearted nuns who rationalize their meanness by imagining that they are doing God's work. They don't come across as phonies but as people who have no intellectual tools for understanding their own minds and feelings outside of their religious/moralistic and institutional framework.The things that people will do when they believe that they are absolutely right can be just inhuman.In this sense there is a universal message to the film. Religions are great places for screwed up people to hide, and to screw up other people's heads, who then give them moral support. So here in the film we have conservative Catholics, but elsewhere we have Taliban and other fundamentalist Muslims, fundamentalist Mormons, and various conservative Protestant groups here and there. Granted these are the extremes, but extremes tell us a lot about the human condition and slippery slopes.Most of the film is about cruel nuns -- a notorious topic of discussion not just in Ireland but even in many American families. But the film does throw in bits about priests who molest vulnerable little girls. There is no suggestion that the priests feel that pedophilia is doing God's work. So in this respect I think of scandals such as developed in films such as The Boys of St. Vincents.How could any of this go on and for so long and on such a massive scale? Where were the government officials? Where were the higher Church officials? This film does not do much with this obvious question. The Boys of St. Vincents does more. Today we see evidence in the media of institutional cover-ups. And this is one of the reasons that religions are a good place for screwed up people to hide. Not only do they provide a language for all sorts of rationalizations, but society tends to keep hands off.So I don't think that this film is only about some girls that got abused, or even a system in Ireland that was abusive. These were just the examples. A thinking person can find much more in them.I loved the accompanying documentary with the strange title Sex in a Cold Climate. It is really interesting to see interviews with women who actually lived through these horrors. The old photographs add a lot too. I could not help but think about interviews in documentaries about Nazi horrors. It is important to record these on film and for younger generations to have this! There are some interesting parallels. The Nazis hid their viciousness perhaps even from themselves behind their belief system and the idea of a master race and their outrageous costumes. These nuns hid their viciousness perhaps even from themselves behind their belief system and the idea that they were suppressing sexual evil and their outrageous costumes. Both were separated from ordinary humans in their own minds.",5,Challenging to watch,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,3275,"['film', 'pretense', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'watch', 'girl', 'raped', 'nice', 'folksy', 'community', 'party', 'instead', 'boy', 'being', 'strung', 'up', 'older', 'men', 'attention', 'fact', 'girl', 'been', 'soiled', 'dirtied', 'girl', 'shipped', 'be', 'incarcerated', 'nuns', 'who', 'exploit', 'girls', 'laundry', 'business', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'suspected', 'having', 'potential', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'sex', 'marriage.From', 'flavor', 'documentary', 'scene', 'scene', 'abuse', 'cold-hearted', 'nuns', 'who', 'rationalize', 'meanness', 'imagining', 'are', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'phonies', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'intellectual', 'tools', 'understanding', 'own', 'minds', 'feelings', 'religious/moralistic', 'institutional', 'framework.The', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'believe', 'are', 'absolutely', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'inhuman.In', 'sense', 'universal', 'message', 'film', 'Religions', 'are', 'great', 'places', 'screwed', 'up', 'people', 'hide', 'screw', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'heads', 'who', 'then', 'give', 'moral', 'support', 'So', 'here', 'film', 'have', 'conservative', 'Catholics', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'Taliban', 'other', 'fundamentalist', 'Muslims', 'fundamentalist', 'Mormons', 'various', 'conservative', 'Protestant', 'groups', 'here', 'there', 'Granted', 'are', 'extremes', 'extremes', 'tell', 'lot', 'human', 'condition', 'slippery', 'slopes.Most', 'film', 'cruel', 'nuns', 'notorious', 'topic', 'discussion', 'not', 'just', 'Ireland', 'even', 'many', 'American', 'families', 'film', 'throw', 'bits', 'priests', 'who', 'molest', 'vulnerable', 'little', 'girls', 'suggestion', 'priests', 'feel', 'pedophilia', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'So', 'respect', 'think', 'scandals', 'such', 'developed', 'films', 'such', 'Boys', 'St.', 'Vincents.How', 'could', 'go', 'so', 'long', 'massive', 'scale', 'Where', 'were', 'government', 'officials', 'Where', 'were', 'higher', 'Church', 'officials', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'obvious', 'question', 'Boys', 'St.', 'Vincents', 'more', 'Today', 'see', 'evidence', 'media', 'institutional', 'cover-ups', 'one', 'reasons', 'religions', 'are', 'good', 'place', 'screwed', 'up', 'people', 'hide', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'provide', 'language', 'sorts', 'rationalizations', 'society', 'keep', 'hands', 'off.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'only', 'about', 'girls', 'got', 'abused', 'even', 'system', 'Ireland', 'was', 'abusive', 'were', 'just', 'examples', 'thinking', 'person', 'can', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'them.I', 'loved', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'strange', 'title', 'Sex', 'Cold', 'Climate', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'interviews', 'women', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'horrors', 'old', 'photographs', 'lot', 'too', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'interviews', 'documentaries', 'Nazi', 'horrors', 'important', 'record', 'film', 'younger', 'generations', 'have', 'are', 'interesting', 'parallels', 'Nazis', 'hid', 'viciousness', 'perhaps', 'even', 'belief', 'system', 'idea', 'master', 'race', 'outrageous', 'costumes', 'nuns', 'hid', 'viciousness', 'perhaps', 'even', 'belief', 'system', 'idea', 'were', 'suppressing', 'sexual', 'evil', 'outrageous', 'costumes', 'were', 'separated', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'own', 'minds']",N/A

In Ireland through its torturous history, the Catholic Church had provided the glue and hope even during famines.  When does an institution outlive its usefulness?  It is not healthy surely when it becomes mindlessly tyrannical.  This is not a knock on the Catholic Church, but any institution that loses its way can turn society into a prison.  Look at modern Islam.Getting people's sexual yearnings under control is a first priority of any society.  Men need to know they are the father of a child; otherwise, they have no ties to the mother or domestic home.  Since the Libido is always present, a halter is put on sexual practices both real and imagined, but not always successfully; hence, we have the drama of sexual hysteria in Ireland almost to the present where girls may be punished for having sex or being too attractive.  Off to the Magdalene Laundries to work as slaves for sadistic money-grubbing nuns and lecherous priests.  The Catholic Church takes a big hit with this film.I give a special mention to a fine actress, Geraldine McEwan, who played the evil Sister Bridget.

It starts grim and ends grim and does a remarkable job of unwavering grimness inbetween - which would be fine, ordinarily - but since it's plagued with some downright sloppy performances and some bizarrely pedestrian direction, never manages to take itself seriously.Case in point: Crispina (no, not Christina), a secondary character, and sort of the whipping-girl for the scriptwriters, believes in her confusedness that she and her estranged son can speak via their holy medal necklaces. In trying to explain this to her comrade, she fails to remember the word she is looking for - telephone - and when she does remember, the actress in question delivers the line, a line meant to illustrate just how serious her mental condition and surroundings are - with all the aplomb and subtlety of a Monty Python 'woman' on smack. It's funny, in the most unintentional sense, and strips what little dramatic worth the scene had in the first place.Similarly ridiculous are the scenes of physical and sexual violence - almost like the director and the actors deliberately decided not to grasp the nettle and dumbed it down for the 'benefit' of their audience - which leaves us with a mere impression of the true horror of the abuse. The trouble with this is that since the rest of the movie is so overdone in terms of emotional communication and Good versus Evil characterisation, these grey areas turn literally into sludge, lacking both support enough to make the subtleties noticable, and decisiveness enough to make the excesses believable.There are one or two good points, hence the lack of a One-Star rating - Geraldine McEwan's performance as the malevolent Sister Bridget is chilling and effective in places, and Dorothy Duffy as Rose is suitably winsome and understated - but for the most part, 'The Magdelene Sisters' is an overawed, overstated and broadly-drawn amalgam tale that does, in this reviewer's opinion, a huge disservice to the actual horrors suffered by the victims of their real-life counterparts.

Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) was far too pretty and dubbed a 'temptress' because the boys wouldn't leave her alone, and Rose (Dorothy Duffy) had a baby out of wedlock and was forced to give it up by the Catholic Church. None of these women were related to each other, but they became sisters in their suffering.They were sent to the Magdalene Laundries, where like Mary Magdalene the Biblical sinner, the girls were supposed to cleanse their souls through hard work and deprivation. That was the only way they could reach heaven, according to the Catholic Church of 1960's Ireland.The head of this particular facility, Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) is unspeakably cruel.  She was given sole rule over the women and they were only allowed freedom after she chose to grant it.  It is shocking that all this was going on in the midst of the birth of the Women's Liberation Movement.  Even worse that families would willingly give up their children for such indignity.It wasn't just punishment for the girls.

769638,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000AZVEN,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","The Magdalene Sisters (Peter Mullan, 2002)Mullan, whose turns in front of the camera lend greatness to such films as Session 9, My Name Is Joe, and Young Adam, here delivers his first directorial effort in five years. While the movie falls short in a number of areas, it certainly achieves its intended effect: inciting an almost murderous rage in its viewers.The story centers around a particular Magdalene asylum (which one is never stated) to which, in 1964, three girls are sent for various things. They are Bernadette (Nor-Jane Noone of Ella Enchanted in her big screen debut), Margaret (Anne Marie Duff, recently in Enigma), and Rose (fellow first-timer Dorothy Duffy). The three of them try to survive as best they can. Among their fellow prisoners are the somewhat mentally challenged Crispina (Eileen Walsh, the title character in the recent Janice Beard: 45 Words a Minute), who ends up with as much screen time as any of the main characters. As the title suggests, though, the real main focus of the film is the sisters, led by the dictatorial Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan, portrayer of Lucia in ""Mapp and Lucia""), and how they relentlessly brutalize the women under their purview.Mullan obviously has an axe to grind against Mother Church. While this is usually a bad thing, he steps back and refrains from editorializing, leaving the stories to speak for themselves; the film is refreshingly free of overbearing claptrap one expects to find in anti-religious movies. That said, the horror of what the girls endure is more than enough to put one off one's feed for a week or two. (Those who have attempted to dismiss the film as exaggerated balderdash managed to miss the DVD version, which contains the documentary Sex in a Cold Climate [review below]; it is quite obvious the stories of these three girls are based completely on three of the subjects of the documentary.)Here, however, is the film's main failing; it depicts these horrors without terribly much context. The storyline is full of gaping holes in both plot and temporality; various scenes are set up and executed, then never referenced again, despite being things that would change a person's life. In other words, in short, the movie suffers somewhat from sitcom syndrome; you can do anything you want to your characters, but not terribly much changes. The characters are well drawn, and the actresses play the parts very well, but they're not given terribly much for the characters to do. You can empathize with them, but there's not much for bonding purposes.The end result is more a catalogue of brutality than it is a watchable film. It is, to say the least, a document of deep importance. It needs to be seen, and those responsible need to be punished. The problem is, it's not really all that watchable. ** * * *Sex in a Cold Climate (Steve Humphries, 1998)First-time director Humphries takes a very jaundiced look at the Magdalene Asylums, ten of which relentlessly brutalized, tortured, and abused thousands of women during the twentieth century (the actual number is unknown; the film estimates thirty thousand). Narrated by veteran TV actress Dervla Kirwan (Ballykissangel), Sex in a Cold Climate is fifty harrowing minutes of descriptions of systemized atrocity. The only real comparison in the nonfiction world, in my experience, is Nightmare in Machuria.Sex in a Cold Climate focuses on four women: three Magdalene inmates and one who grew up in an adjoining Magdalene orphanage. The four of them were at different Magdalene Asylums at different time periods; as only ten existed, this alone is rather powerful evidence that the conditions portrayed by the women here were epidemic in proportion. For the most part, the women are rather stoic about their ordeals, though one, who was already dying at the time the film was made, couldn't hold back a few tears, and another was unable to keep some bitter vitriol out of her voice from time to time. But the deadpan, defeated tones in which they describe repeated abuse, humiliation, and puzzlement do far more to underscore the horror of their imprisonment than theatrics would.The unconscionable treatment received by these women (and, by inference, many others) at the hands of the Magdalenes is sickening, and (like the subjects of Nightmare in Manchuria) their deeds were kept secret for far too long. What may be most shocking for the viewer, however, is the revelation that the last of the Magdalene Asylums was not closed until 1996. That people at the end of the twentieth century were still capable of believing the loathsome religious idiocy that was the basis for the systematic brutalization of women who had had, were suspected of having, or had the potential to have sex is a rather fine judgment on the intelligence human race, don't you think?

769639,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000AZVEN,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","Sort of the dark side of ""The Trouble With Angels,"" ""The Magdalene Sisters"" provides a harrowing true-life account of three young girls who are shipped off to an institution for ""wayward"" girls, a place that turns out to be little more than a hellish prison run by an order of sadistic nuns.  We are informed at the end of the film that more than 30,000 girls were sent to these ""Magdalene laundries"" before they were finally shut down in 1996.  The film, set in1960's Ireland, is yet another stinging indictment of religious fanaticism run amok.The three youngsters who are the story's focus are Margaret, a girl who is raped by her own cousin; Bernadette, a pretty girl who flirts a little too obviously with the boys hanging around the orphanage where she lives; and Rose, a young woman who had the misfortune of producing a child out of wedlock.  For their ""crimes,"" all three girls are spirited away and deposited in this religious hellhole, where for many years they are forced to perform ceaseless labor, are abused both physically and psychologically, and are deprived of compassion, freedom and hope.  Writer/director Peter Mullan approaches his subject matter with unwavering bluntness, not fearing to point the finger of blame exactly where it belongs - on the Catholic Church hierarchy who allowed this sort of unenlightened sadism to go on in the name of Jesus and religion.  Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church did not want this film to be either made or distributed.  For that reason alone, the movie demands to be seen.In a way, ""The Magdalene Sisters"" isn't as much a character study as it is a docudrama chronicling the abuses the girls are forced to undergo.  Despite excellent performances from all the actresses involved, we don't get to know much about each of their characters as individuals other than the fact they suffer unendurably.  Bernadette is probably the most fully developed of the three, but the polemical nature of the film precludes our getting to know really too much about her (or the others).  As the camp commandant - er I mean Mother Superior - Geraldine McEwen is chillingly brilliant, turning her character into an implacable tower of authority, a petty dictator ruling over the lives of her helpless charges.""The Magdalene Sisters"" functions as a much needed expose of this kind of institutionalized abuse which we can assume still goes on in many places and in many forms in the world today.

Regarded as prostitutes, like the maligned and misrepresented Mary Magdalene of the Bible, they have been consigned to a lifetime of servitude, working in large laundries, to regain a lost purity and save their souls. As illustrated in the film, besides being held as prisoners and compelled to labor as virtual slaves, they are also physically, emotionally and sometimes sexually abused.The two-hour film follows the course of their incarceration over several years as they individually resist the daily constraints, humiliations and punishments. Three of them finally gain freedom and a fourth loses a fragile grasp on sanity. The DVD includes a TV documentary on which the fictional film is based. Made in 1997 for Film Four, it includes heart-rending interviews of survivors whose stories reveal the extent of emotional scarring suffered by them and constitute an indictment of the system, then only recently closed down.

769641,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0000AZVEN,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 8]","Caveat: The ""Rotten Review"" prizes few things above a determined opinion; yet found itself split on this disturbing and heart-wrenching film.  On the one hand, it's a powerful story aimed at exposing a great evil.  OTOH, the film itself isn't so much a true story as a profound drama based on a true story - leaving the viewer little more than faith to bridge the line between the two.  In other words, where does the true story end and the story-based-on-a-true story begin?""Magdalene"" tells an horrific story of girls trapped in Ireland's system of institutions for incurably wayward young females.  Magdalene asylums ""employed"" their inmates as launderers, working long hours thruought the year, suffering brutal conditions and an endless stream of abuse by Nuns.  Some of the young girls are promiscuous; others are already victims by the time the state and their cravenly compliant parents have consigned them to a living hell of near endless drudgery (they do get off for Christmas) - especially Margaret who must suffer for being raped by a relative.  The film is largely plotless - aside from documenting how their suffering draws the girls toward the very life the Church claims to be saving them from, much of the film merely depicts how horribly innovative they were at the job.  Girls are stripped naked, sexually, physically and emotionally abused, exploited in every conceivable way.  The ultimate horror is about timing: though a period piece set in the 1960's, the Magdalene asylums themselves remained in operation though 1996, when affordable washing machines accomplished what outrage could  not.  Forget the convoluted ramblings of ""Dan Brown"", this is the tale the Church really doesn't want you to see.So why the conditional review?  This was definitely a powerful story, one bound to arouse fiery emotions from any viewer - most of them angry, and virtually all of them ratifying the most negative opinions of The Church.  And that's the rub.  It's too powerful a story to be told as a story, where situations are dramatized, characters become composites, and everything is ""inspired"" by actual events.  There's little limit on the rage that a film such as this can raise against the Church in those who see it (just read the other ""positive"" reviews and you'll get the point.)  Not being Irish or Catholic, the Rotten Reviewer found itself easily siding into that category before catching itself.  Though the horrors of Magdalene Asylums cannot begin to be mitigated, a sense of balance is needed to keep the film from degenerating into a hate screed against Irish Catholicism - and that's something that simply can't be scripted, even with the film's unabashed brutality.

769642,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B0000AZVEN,Russell Fanelli,"[9, 10]","Ireland, the land of Saints and Sinners, focuses on sin without redemption in this stark portrayal of the injustice done to women in the Ireland of the 20th Century.In the most glaring case of injustice dramatized, a young woman who has been raped at a wedding party is sent to a Magdalene House by her father.  These houses, located in various parts of Ireland, are places where women young and old are incarcerated without trial and forced to work doing laundry from dawn to dusk.  The women are treated like slaves for ""the good of their souls"" by nuns who take a sadistic pleasure in humiliating the women, beating them mercilessly, and frightening them with the fear of everlasting damnation.Few women escape from their torment.  The ones who try are often returned to servitude by their own families and then are beaten and have their head shaved in the most brutal and demeaning fashion as an object lesson to the rest of the prisoners.  This dreadful practice of involuntary servitude continued until 1996 when the last Magdalene House was finally shut down.Included with the DVD is a three part documentary called ""Sex in a Cold Climate.""  While not as dramatic or brutal as the film, the point is clearly made that 30,000 women were subjected to a glaring miscarriage of justice.  Ireland is portrayed as a backward country with a Middle Age mentality.Some of the priests shown in the film abuse the young women sexually and use the confessional to reinforce the misguided notion of ""the penitents"" that they have brought their harsh fate on themselves and what is being done to them is being done for their own good.This film deserves the high praise it has received.  Its point of view may be biased against the religious and clergy of Ireland, but this bias is supported by the dreadful treatment of real people who have testified against the Magdalene Houses and their proprietors.Ireland may be the setting for this film, but in the end, our consciousness is raised and sensitized to the plight of women everywhere who suffer in male dominated cultures often suported by unwitting women who are duped into believing the lies taught to them by the male establishment.  Few people will be unmoved by this stark portrayal of the evil done to women until very recently in what we will now find hard to call ""The Emerald Isle.""",5,The Emerald Isle badly tarnished in the Magdalene Sisters,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,2337,"['Ireland', 'land', 'Saints', 'Sinners', 'sin', 'redemption', 'stark', 'portrayal', 'injustice', 'done', 'women', 'Ireland', '20th', 'Century.In', 'most', 'glaring', 'case', 'injustice', 'dramatized', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'raped', 'wedding', 'party', 'sent', 'Magdalene', 'House', 'father', 'houses', 'located', 'various', 'parts', 'Ireland', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'women', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'incarcerated', 'trial', 'forced', 'work', 'doing', 'dawn', 'dusk', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'slaves', 'good', 'souls', 'nuns', 'who', 'take', 'sadistic', 'pleasure', 'humiliating', 'women', 'beating', 'mercilessly', 'frightening', 'fear', 'everlasting', 'damnation.Few', 'women', 'escape', 'torment', 'ones', 'who', 'try', 'are', 'often', 'returned', 'servitude', 'own', 'families', 'then', 'are', 'beaten', 'have', 'head', 'shaved', 'most', 'brutal', 'demeaning', 'fashion', 'object', 'lesson', 'rest', 'prisoners', 'dreadful', 'practice', 'involuntary', 'servitude', 'continued', '1996', 'when', 'last', 'Magdalene', 'House', 'was', 'finally', 'shut', 'down.Included', 'DVD', 'three', 'part', 'documentary', 'called', 'Sex', 'Cold', 'Climate', 'not', 'dramatic', 'brutal', 'film', 'point', 'clearly', 'made', '30,000', 'women', 'were', 'subjected', 'glaring', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'Ireland', 'portrayed', 'backward', 'country', 'Middle', 'Age', 'mentality.Some', 'priests', 'shown', 'film', 'young', 'women', 'sexually', 'use', 'confessional', 'reinforce', 'misguided', 'notion', 'penitents', 'have', 'brought', 'harsh', 'fate', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'being', 'done', 'own', 'good.This', 'film', 'high', 'praise', 'received', 'point', 'view', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'religious', 'clergy', 'Ireland', 'bias', 'supported', 'dreadful', 'treatment', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'testified', 'Magdalene', 'Houses', 'proprietors.Ireland', 'may', 'be', 'setting', 'film', 'end', 'consciousness', 'raised', 'sensitized', 'plight', 'women', 'everywhere', 'who', 'suffer', 'male', 'dominated', 'cultures', 'often', 'suported', 'unwitting', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'duped', 'believing', 'lies', 'taught', 'male', 'establishment', 'Few', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'unmoved', 'stark', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'done', 'women', 'very', 'recently', 'what', 'will', 'now', 'find', 'hard', 'call', 'Emerald', 'Isle']",N/A

In Ireland, until the end of the twentieth century, there were &quot;nun schools&quot; all over the country. Girls were abandoned there by their families or tutors entering a world of slavery, having to work doing laundry for outside contractors and being treated like prisoners in a labor farm. The director, Peter Mullan, did an outstanding job in conveying to the public the conditions in which the girls spent their hours, as well as depicting the eroding effect the situation had on their hopes, ambitions, and even basic personality traits.The tale focuses on three female adolescents, who end up in the infamous reformatory for different reasons. Margaret is raped by her cousin on a family wedding, and when minutes after the fact she tells a friend, the &quot;secret&quot; is shared with everyone. Her father cannot stand the shame and hauls her off to her miserable destination. Bernadette is happy living in an orphanage, but she is also beautiful and enjoys the attention she is getting from the boys in the neighborhood. The director of the orphanage starts to get concerned and sends her away. Rose is a single mother who has just given birth to a beautiful baby. Her parents bring in a priest to convince her to give the baby up in adoption, and once she surrenders to their wishes, her reward is to pay a long visit to the nuns.The motto of the Magdalene sisters is to deny pleasures and seek cleansing through non-stop working. Moreover, they force the girls to pray every night, and the discipline is worse than in the strictest military school. What makes things even scarier is that the sisters held adult women as &quot;prisoners&quot; too, since these individuals have lost all lucidity and have grown used to their way of living. Of course, while the recluses eat disgusting food, the nuns feast on delicacies and enjoy the money earned through the effort of others.Most of the aspects of the movie are outstanding and the experience is ultimately enjoyable, but it is hard to swallow some of the things that happen to these girls. There are two performances that in my opinion shine well above the rest. Geraldine McEwan is so convincing in her role of Sister Bridget, that one hates her right away. Nora-Jane Noone plays Bernadette and does so very effectively, creating ambiguous feelings towards this character. Finally, the music in this production is worth mentioning and deserves high praise, with the song playing during the wedding in which Margaret is raped, being its best representative.",5,&quot;What have we done to deserve this?&quot;,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,2626,"['shocking', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'events', 'one', 'Ireland', 'end', 'twentieth', 'century', 'were', 'quot', 'schools', 'quot', 'country', 'Girls', 'were', 'abandoned', 'there', 'families', 'tutors', 'entering', 'world', 'slavery', 'having', 'work', 'doing', 'laundry', 'outside', 'contractors', 'being', 'treated', 'prisoners', 'labor', 'farm', 'director', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'conveying', 'public', 'conditions', 'girls', 'spent', 'hours', 'as', 'well', 'depicting', 'eroding', 'effect', 'situation', 'had', 'hopes', 'ambitions', 'even', 'basic', 'personality', 'traits.The', 'tale', 'focuses', 'three', 'female', 'adolescents', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'infamous', 'reformatory', 'different', 'reasons', 'Margaret', 'raped', 'cousin', 'family', 'wedding', 'when', 'minutes', 'fact', 'friend', 'quot', 'secret', 'quot', 'shared', 'everyone', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'shame', 'hauls', 'off', 'miserable', 'destination', 'Bernadette', 'happy', 'living', 'orphanage', 'also', 'beautiful', 'attention', 'getting', 'boys', 'neighborhood', 'director', 'orphanage', 'get', 'concerned', 'away', 'Rose', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'parents', 'bring', 'priest', 'convince', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'once', 'surrenders', 'wishes', 'reward', 'pay', 'long', 'visit', 'nuns.The', 'motto', 'Magdalene', 'sisters', 'deny', 'pleasures', 'seek', 'cleansing', 'non-stop', 'working', 'Moreover', 'force', 'girls', 'pray', 'night', 'discipline', 'worse', 'strictest', 'military', 'school', 'What', 'things', 'even', 'scarier', 'sisters', 'held', 'adult', 'women', 'quot', 'prisoners', 'quot', 'too', 'individuals', 'have', 'lost', 'lucidity', 'have', 'grown', 'used', 'way', 'living', 'course', 'recluses', 'eat', 'disgusting', 'food', 'nuns', 'feast', 'delicacies', 'enjoy', 'money', 'earned', 'effort', 'others.Most', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'outstanding', 'experience', 'ultimately', 'enjoyable', 'hard', 'swallow', 'things', 'happen', 'girls', 'are', 'two', 'performances', 'opinion', 'shine', 'well', 'rest', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'Sister', 'Bridget', 'one', 'right', 'away', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Bernadette', 'so', 'very', 'effectively', 'creating', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'character', 'Finally', 'music', 'production', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'deserves', 'high', 'praise', 'song', 'playing', 'wedding', 'Margaret', 'raped', 'being', 'best', 'representative']",N/A
769644,APDPA11IZPYLN,B0000AZVEN,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[94, 104]","For much of the 20th century in Ireland, the Roman Catholic Church operated a string of laundries, the Magdalene Asylums, where very young women accused of ""moral crimes"" were sentto work and repent of their evil ways in a cathartic vision of cleansing the soul while cleaning the laundry. These so-called ""moral crimes"" were broadly defined as becoming pregnant, gettingraped or even flirting with boys or being overly attractive and thus committing the sin of vanity.In the asylum's history, over 30,000 women were incarcerated, endured the Catholic Churches discipline systems and many died there. Often sexually abused and assaulted by priests, sexually humiliated, assaulted, shamed and  beaten within an inch of their lives by their masochistic caretakers, the nuns - those ""sweet sisters of mercy"".As a shocker, The last of these horrendous Catholic laundries closed in 1996.Scottish actor-writer-director Peter Mullan sets the story in 1964, the high-water mark for tension between our modern society and old-line Catholicism.The story centers on three very young women who were surreptitiously marched off to repent and be slaves for life to the Holy Catholic Church and their ""pious"" service of community.Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is raped by her cousin at a family wedding and both of her parents place her in the ""care"" of their village priest and ship her off to the Magelene Laundries to avoid that horrible stigma of shameful family embarrassment; Rose (Dorothy Duffy) is an unwed mother forced by her mother, father and Holy Father to give her baby boy up for adoption, placing him in the Catholic orphanage system, and Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) is a Catholic orphanage young and beautiful teenaged girl  deemed loose just because she is so pretty, fun and talks to boys.All three are sent to a Magdalene laundry outside Dublin, where conditions would make the dusty prison farm in ""Cool Hand Luke"" look like a virtual health spa. These young women are worked 12 to 14 hours a day, 364 days a year (except Christmas, God bless) without any pay, viciously beaten for even speaking out of turn and, in one most disturbing scene, trotted around naked and ridiculed by the nuns.Overseeing the place is Highhanded Sister Bridget, a witch in a wimpole, well played by the British veteran Geraldine MacEwan.The other inmates of the Holy Catholic Church are a varied lot. The tragic figure of the mentally disabled, sexually assaulted, and committed Crispina played by Eileen Walsh in an earth shattering performance really stands out as the best performance in the cast, in my humble opinion.The nuns are given some depth by director, Mullan- Sister Bridget is shown as a whirling devilish mean mother superior one moment, but capable of gushing tears at a Christmas Day screening of ""The Bells of St. Mary's.""What is truly unbelievable and disquieting  in ""The Magdalene Sisters"" is how the Irish families of the prisoners aided and abetted such cruel treatment of their own flesh and blood.When one girl, Una, successfully escapes the laundry, she is beaten within an inch of her life and is dragged back by her father (oddly played by the director, Mullan), who verbally and physically abuses Una every step of the way. Una is handed over to Sister Bernadette and the sister shaves all of Una's beautiful hair off of her beaten and bloodied head which was a regular action taken by the nuns.In Mullan's portrait of institutionalized shame and suffering, and a society's uniquely cruel form of sexual repression, ""The Magdalene Sisters"" is a hard pill to take, but certainly worth it for its outpouring of overcoming, raw rage and defiance on the screen.And if the fact-based movie weren't enough to shock, also included is the British documentary ""Sex In A Cold Climate"" which interviews several Irish women who were imprisioned during the time of the Catholic Church's REIGN OF TERROR!

Set in the 1960's in Dublin, it tells the story of three young women who in different circumstances are sent to the Magdalene Laundry Asylum where they are under the thumb of cruel nuns.  Margaret is raped by a cousin and sent away rather than being dealt with by her family.  Rose has a child before she is married so her parents send her to the asylum.  Bernadette takes too keen an interest in boys at the orphanage she lives in so she is sent away.  Once the girls arrive at the laundry asylum, they are abused mentally and physically by the nuns and priests who watch over them.  Through all their pain and suffering, they must try and survive the atrocities they must live with.  This is a movie that does not shy away from showing things as they really are.  I was surprised to find out that these asylums in Ireland only closed in 1996.  Ultimately, this movie is an excellent retelling of three young women who refused to be beaten down under such retched conditions.Anne-Marie Duff is very good as Margaret, a young woman raped by a cousin who becomes a strong individual while many others crumble apart in the Magdalene Laundry Asylum.  Nora-Jane Noone is also very good as Bernadette, who begins to look out only for herself.  Dorothy Duffy plays Rose, who must also deal with having to give her son away and then being sent to the asylum.  Geraldine McEwan is absolutely evil as Sister Bridget, the head of the asylum.  Eileen Walsh also stars as Crispina, a woman who befriends the girls while also dealing with being separated from her 3-year old son.

Jen,"[2, 2]","Although the film itself is fictionalised, the Magdalene ""sisters"" did treat their ""wards"" in an abhorrent, deplorable and inhumane manner. Back when Puritanism was in full swing, women were not only treated as property, but as ""bitches"" that had to be reigned in line for ""offenses"" along the lines of flirting with boys (an Orwellian Facecrime if there ever was one), premartial sex and being raped (obviously, some countries still had not outgrown the idea of blaming women for being too ""seductive"" and ""asking for rape"").They are sent to the Magdalene asylums and treated as slaves (wages were not paid). Rose is suffering immense physical and emotional trauma as her baby is kidnapped from her and her milk accumulates due to her hormones. Sadly, the abbey's doctrine of asceticism forbids pain relief and true compassion.Una escapes, unable to bear the separation from her family. Her father forcibly returns her and threatens to break her legs if she attempts a similar stunt. Bernadette seduces a male worker who delivers the laundry (one of their few connections to the outside world). She reaches out to him, entreats him for help in escaping her living nightmare. This fails when he learns they cannot provide financial payment. Bernadette is subjected to further abuse by the nuns for rebelling against the fascistic system. Those who ran the asylums were akin to Hitler's Brownshirts. The wages that rightfully belonged to the exploited young ladies was hoarded away to fund the institution's expansion and to consolidate the power and influence of those in charge.The abuses of power continue, and the divide between ""respectable"" women and ""unrespectable"" women widens and becomes one of the film's key themes. That, and the obsession that religion has with natural sexual functions (which has led to 10% of priests who complete seminary training ending up as child rapists; see Deliver Us From Evil). This ancient, anachronistic, 20th century BC ""morality"" has no place in modern society. For that matter, it had no place even in the societies that conceived of it.There are countless lessons we can learn from this. Most obvious is the inescapable tie between religion and misogyny. Lack of accountability leads to things that even the Enron and Arthur Anderson executives would balk at doing (although they saw no issues with harming individuals far from their sight - as D'Souza would say, ""The tears of strangers are only water.""). Not understanding what true love and compassion not only prevents human beings from growing up as stable, compassionate individuals, but instills in them the false and unshakable idea that they are actually giving love while making other people suffer and wallow in misery.Separation of church and state must be implemented worldwide if we are to see a cessation of similar tragedies.",5,"The Unholy Union of Theocracy, Puritanism and Misogyny",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2837,"['film', 'fictionalised', 'Magdalene', 'sisters', 'did', 'treat', 'wards', 'abhorrent', 'deplorable', 'inhumane', 'manner', 'Back', 'when', 'Puritanism', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'treated', 'property', 'bitches', 'had', 'be', 'reigned', 'line', 'offenses', 'lines', 'flirting', 'boys', 'Orwellian', 'Facecrime', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'premartial', 'sex', 'being', 'raped', 'obviously', 'countries', 'still', 'had', 'not', 'outgrown', 'idea', 'blaming', 'women', 'being', 'too', 'seductive', 'asking', 'rape', '.They', 'are', 'sent', 'Magdalene', 'asylums', 'treated', 'slaves', 'wages', 'were', 'not', 'paid', 'Rose', 'suffering', 'immense', 'physical', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'baby', 'kidnapped', 'milk', 'accumulates', 'due', 'hormones', 'Sadly', 'abbey', 'doctrine', 'asceticism', 'forbids', 'pain', 'relief', 'true', 'compassion.Una', 'escapes', 'unable', 'bear', 'separation', 'family', 'father', 'forcibly', 'break', 'legs', 'similar', 'stunt', 'Bernadette', 'male', 'worker', 'who', 'laundry', 'one', 'few', 'connections', 'outside', 'world', 'out', 'help', 'escaping', 'living', 'nightmare', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'financial', 'payment', 'Bernadette', 'subjected', 'further', 'abuse', 'nuns', 'rebelling', 'fascistic', 'system', 'who', 'ran', 'asylums', 'were', 'akin', 'Hitler', 'Brownshirts', 'wages', 'rightfully', 'belonged', 'exploited', 'young', 'ladies', 'was', 'hoarded', 'away', 'fund', 'institution', 'expansion', 'consolidate', 'power', 'influence', 'charge.The', 'abuses', 'power', 'continue', 'divide', 'respectable', 'women', 'unrespectable', 'women', 'widens', 'one', 'film', 'key', 'themes', 'obsession', 'religion', 'natural', 'sexual', 'functions', 'led', '10', '%', 'priests', 'who', 'complete', 'seminary', 'training', 'ending', 'up', 'child', 'rapists', 'see', 'Deliver', 'Us', 'From', 'Evil', 'ancient', 'anachronistic', '20th', 'century', 'BC', 'morality', 'place', 'modern', 'society', 'matter', 'had', 'place', 'even', 'societies', 'conceived', 'it.There', 'are', 'countless', 'can', 'learn', 'Most', 'obvious', 'inescapable', 'tie', 'religion', 'misogyny', 'Lack', 'accountability', 'things', 'even', 'Enron', 'Arthur', 'Anderson', 'executives', 'would', 'balk', 'doing', 'saw', 'issues', 'harming', 'individuals', 'far', 'sight', ""D'Souza"", 'would', 'say', 'tears', 'strangers', 'are', 'only', 'water.', 'Not', 'understanding', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'compassion', 'not', 'only', 'human', 'beings', 'growing', 'up', 'stable', 'compassionate', 'individuals', 'instills', 'false', 'unshakable', 'idea', 'are', 'actually', 'giving', 'love', 'making', 'other', 'people', 'suffer', 'wallow', 'misery.Separation', 'church', 'state', 'must', 'be', 'implemented', 'worldwide', 'are', 'see', 'cessation', 'similar', 'tragedies']",N/A
