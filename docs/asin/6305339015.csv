You with me so far? From this point on the film rides like a roller coaster: Con artists, black mail and murder land Gage in a quest to win back her life. The storyline alone makes up for the questionable acting (Shannen Doherty excluded) - .I have yet to decide if the actors are playing bad acting charactors, or if they are just bad actors, even so, viewers will be to busy drooling at Shannen to notice anyone else.",5,Full of twists and turns,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,569,"['great', 'film', 'great', 'plot', 'twists', 'Gage', 'Shannen', 'top', 'paparazzi', 'two', 'problems', '1', 'stalker', '2', 'involved', 'murder', 'so', 'far', 'point', 'film', 'rides', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Con', 'black', 'mail', 'murder', 'land', 'Gage', 'quest', 'win', 'back', 'life', 'storyline', 'alone', 'up', 'questionable', 'acting', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'excluded', '.I', 'have', 'yet', 'decide', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'bad', 'acting', 'charactors', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'actors', 'even', 'so', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'busy', 'drooling', 'Shannen', 'notice', 'anyone', 'else']",Striking Poses VHS
460640,A1UOTG037037XY,6305339015,Cleo,"[0, 1]","The actress has a talent for acting pretty snotty no matter what happens to her character but her brand of snotty is HIGHLY watchable bordering on comedic genius. She always looks like she is clicking her tongue at the morons she has to deal with even when she is sporting terrible down market clothes and wet hair (being on the run and all.)  If there were still a soap opera industry, Shannen Doherty could be the next Susan Lucci.  She's weirdly mesmerizing as a short angry woman and she still acts like an immature 25 year old.  The actress can definitely hold her own sharing the screen with younger, technically more attractive costars. It would be fun to see her in scenes where she's super pissed off.  The supporting cast members are oddly styled or just odd looking giving the viewing experience a surreal quality.  This is an okay movie if you have absolutely nothing better to do, you have an old friend sitting next to you on the couch who can make jokes at the tv set with you while you do something useful like wrap wontons or you are surfing the web.  This is not a rewatchable movie however.",4,Shannen Doherty hasn't been a good girl since Little House on the Prairie,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1109,"['actress', 'talent', 'acting', 'pretty', 'snotty', 'matter', 'what', 'character', 'brand', 'snotty', 'HIGHLY', 'watchable', 'bordering', 'comedic', 'genius', 'always', 'clicking', 'tongue', 'morons', 'deal', 'even', 'when', 'sporting', 'terrible', 'down', 'market', 'clothes', 'wet', 'hair', 'being', 'run', 'were', 'still', 'soap', 'opera', 'industry', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'weirdly', 'mesmerizing', 'short', 'angry', 'woman', 'still', 'immature', '25', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'can', 'definitely', 'hold', 'own', 'sharing', 'screen', 'younger', 'technically', 'more', 'attractive', 'costars', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'scenes', 'where', 'super', 'pissed', 'off', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'oddly', 'styled', 'just', 'odd', 'looking', 'giving', 'viewing', 'experience', 'surreal', 'quality', 'okay', 'movie', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'have', 'old', 'friend', 'sitting', 'next', 'couch', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'jokes', 'tv', 'set', 'do', 'something', 'useful', 'wrap', 'wontons', 'are', 'surfing', 'web', 'not', 'rewatchable', 'movie', 'however']",Striking Poses VHS

Let's get real, okay?  90210 sucked after she left, and Charmed has followed suit.  This movie (which I got a Best Buy for $5.99 on DVD) is a starring vehicle for Shannen.  She plays a tabloid journalist on whom the tables get turned, as she becomes the victim of a stalking psycho.  Throw in a sexy, but dangerous, bodyguard; a kooky best friend, and some bumbling FBI agents, and you have a packed thriller that's not too violent, vrey unpredictable and FULL OF SHANNEN!

460643,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6305339015,JGC,"[2, 3]","""Striking Poses"" has to be one of my very favorite Shannen Doherty movies because it's highly dramatic, fast moving and not one of those typical women's ludicrous bio-TV movies. I just saw this movie the other day on LMN and surprisingly I never heard of it before recently. But I knew it would be great because anything with Shannen always is! ""Striking Poses"" is also different because it's not exactly a TV movie. It's one of those straight-to-video films that Shannen tended to make during the late 90's. You can tell because Gage (Shannen) used the ""f"" word at least once during it.Anyway this is a story of a photographer, Gage who starts getting stalked. It actually was pretty frightening and fierce in some scenes because Shannen was able to capture the essence of her character's turmoil. It was written all over her face. After being scared the night before by a burglar (or a potential stalker?,) the movie starts out with Gage sneaking inside a health club to take some pictures of a celebrity. Personally, I did not like the scene with the ""actress"" and the drugs because looking at someone doing drugs is in my book just as offensive as hardcore porn or violence. Once Gage got her pictures she runs out, only to find that she's being followed! While on the phone (who knew they had handless cell phones in the 90's!) with her assistant Casey (Tamara Gorski) she is instructed to take the back exit (her assistant apparently had some inside view of the club) and got away from him with only seconds to spare!Pretty soon Gage hires a security guy to take care of her, Joseph Griffin played Nick Angel. And he sets up an elaborate-looking security system and tried to help put Gage's fears at ease. The rest of the movie is pretty fast moving and somewhat unpredictable. The ending scene in the studio was so over the top because it was just so extreme. When Gage set the place on fire and her stalker was engulfed in flames I couldn't help but think that this was something Bren would have loved to do to Kelly Taylor for stealing Dylan.

Something isn't quite right and yet seems right, the curves thrown in this show that it take you by surprise. Cast and storyline are fantastic so convincing that you would not image it. Wait for the door slams with the ideas the writer has created. She a paparazzo with a magazine and is been stalked by a ruthless killer with nerve shattering games of life or death. Edge of the seat thrills nail biting moments that will make you feel involved to the limit. So I rated this an A grade plus for the suspense and feelings included in the movie.
