435200,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,6304766017,David Bonesteel,"[3, 4]","Sonny Burns (Jeremy Davies) and Gunnar Casselman (Ben Affleck) are two young men who strike up an acquaintance on their way home from the war in Korea.  As students at the same high school, Sonny, the neurotic introvert, and Gunnar, the Golden Boy athlete, moved in entirely different circles.  Now, following the life-changing experience of the war, this odd couple is able to provide much needed support for each other as they resist sliding back into the same old routine.  Unlike Gunnar's hard-drinking, partying high school buddies, Sonny takes Gunnar's newly-found, ""inner-directed"" (as he calls it), philosophical side seriously.  Gunnar provides vital support and advice as Sonny tries to overcome the crippling neuroses that make it so difficult for him to relate to the opposite sex and break away from his controlling parents.  The entire cast is excellent, but Davies really excels as the imploding, desperate Sonny./",4,"Fine film, but I hate that generic title",1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,929,"['Sonny', 'Burns', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Gunnar', 'Casselman', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'strike', 'up', 'acquaintance', 'way', 'home', 'war', 'Korea', 'students', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'Sonny', 'neurotic', 'introvert', 'Gunnar', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'athlete', 'moved', 'entirely', 'different', 'circles', 'Now', 'following', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'war', 'odd', 'couple', 'able', 'provide', 'much', 'needed', 'support', 'other', 'resist', 'sliding', 'back', 'same', 'old', 'routine', 'Gunnar', 'hard-drinking', 'partying', 'high', 'school', 'buddies', 'Sonny', 'Gunnar', 'newly-found', 'inner-directed', 'philosophical', 'side', 'seriously', 'Gunnar', 'vital', 'support', 'advice', 'Sonny', 'overcome', 'crippling', 'make', 'so', 'difficult', 'relate', 'opposite', 'sex', 'break', 'away', 'controlling', 'parents', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Davies', 'really', 'imploding', 'desperate', 'Sonny./']",Going All the Way VHS
435201,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,6304766017,Fady Ghaly,"[5, 7]","This film, while it may be regarding every boy's life growing up in whatever period of decade, not necessarily the nineteen-fifties, it can really relate to anyone. Not only does it voyage into Sonny Burns' yearning for sexual fulfillment, but it also concerns the mothers of these individuals, who just don't know when to let go, and it also voyages into the power of friendship, into the bond of two young men-one of whom being Sonny-returning home from the Army to discover that their attitudes on life, love, and the town in which they grew up in have altered in this bittersweet coming-of-age drama. Their chemistry was natural, and together they visually generated an improbable coalition rather than some silly contrast. Both men are circumscribed and callow, their inducement is focused on their genitals, and yet they burn with idealism, with fevered fantasies of their own eventual triumph (. . .)The theme which caught my attention most was that of Sonny's sexual frustrations and afflictions with his parents, whose religious beliefs are a matter in which they still assume he opts to follow, or rather neglect to face the fact that he just may no longer want to, like many individuals emerging a certain age, who'll depart from the past and take their own path to whatever life and career that awaits them. But it's not that Sonny necessarily was growing out of the whole scene of going to church every Sunday morning and saying a prayer before going to sleep. It's more that, as detestation grew within him over the years, he has grown to hate God for never bothering to give a helping hand when needed one to pull him out of all this wretchedness, the misery of waking up each morning knowing that he is trapped inside the same slender, opprobrious body and enduring the same life that seemingly never really has any light shed upon it (. . .) I was utterly moved and empathized such tortured souls, for I am quite similar to this character, thereby this very genuine film opens a tremendous amount of interest for its viewing, for I, every time I watch it, feel as though I was watching myself-resemblance between us is that great. I'm not so much proud to admit of the fact, but it's nice to see a film that doesn't concern the usual farfetched subject matters regarding the most inane things, and one that rather concerns issues which can resemble amongst many others out there, such as myself, for instance. Jeremy Davies was terrific depicting this character, capable of delivering both humor and great poignancy to the screen like the natural that he is.After having to deal with well over fifty actors whose goal was to obtain the roll of Sonny Burns-which essentially exemplifies how many others relate to this character and would like to express their feelings of rage, if you will, on screen-Jeremy Davies impressed the filmmakers with his uncanny take on the character; his brooding, indistinctly-uttered performance ideally captures Sonny's underlying indignation, confusion, and insecurities (. . .)While this synopsis may seem like the premise of a nineteen-fifties feel-good movie, Going All the Way emphatically subverts in any evoked nostalgic feelings. Its twisting narrative veers from relatively straight-although ennui-laden-jesting boy talk to surreal trips into Sonny's disturbed inner world, culminating in a profound and painful moment of sexual humiliation. So while it may seem as a direct comedy, it really isn't, as such a character's deepest desires disintegrate and are clear that a mere ""fantasy"" is all they'll conspicuously be. Besides, since when has a film that features graphical scenes of those in the progress of slitting their wrists in an attempt to use such unusual actions as a method of rehabilitation, been humorous by any means? Since when, huh? My advice to you would be to ignore the ostentatious synopsis on the back of both the VHS and DVD package, which bluntly describe the film as a ""romantic comedy.""",5,Fady Ghaly's reviews,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,3969,"['film', 'may', 'be', 'regarding', 'boy', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'period', 'decade', 'not', 'necessarily', 'nineteen-fifties', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'anyone', 'Not', 'only', 'voyage', 'Sonny', 'Burns', 'yearning', 'sexual', 'fulfillment', 'also', 'mothers', 'individuals', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'let', 'go', 'also', 'power', 'friendship', 'bond', 'two', 'young', 'men-one', 'whom', 'being', 'Sonny-returning', 'home', 'Army', 'discover', 'attitudes', 'life', 'love', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'altered', 'bittersweet', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'chemistry', 'was', 'natural', 'together', 'visually', 'generated', 'improbable', 'coalition', 'rather', 'silly', 'contrast', 'men', 'are', 'circumscribed', 'callow', 'inducement', 'focused', 'genitals', 'yet', 'burn', 'idealism', 'fevered', 'fantasies', 'own', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'theme', 'caught', 'attention', 'most', 'was', 'Sonny', 'sexual', 'frustrations', 'afflictions', 'parents', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'matter', 'still', 'assume', 'follow', 'rather', 'neglect', 'face', 'fact', 'just', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'want', 'many', 'individuals', 'emerging', 'certain', 'age', 'who', ""'ll"", 'depart', 'past', 'take', 'own', 'path', 'whatever', 'life', 'career', 'not', 'Sonny', 'necessarily', 'was', 'growing', 'whole', 'scene', 'going', 'church', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'saying', 'prayer', 'going', 'sleep', 'more', 'that', 'detestation', 'grew', 'years', 'grown', 'hate', 'God', 'never', 'bothering', 'give', 'helping', 'hand', 'when', 'needed', 'one', 'pull', 'wretchedness', 'misery', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'knowing', 'trapped', 'same', 'slender', 'opprobrious', 'body', 'enduring', 'same', 'life', 'seemingly', 'never', 'really', 'light', 'shed', 'was', 'utterly', 'moved', 'empathized', 'such', 'tortured', 'souls', 'am', 'quite', 'similar', 'character', 'thereby', 'very', 'genuine', 'film', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'interest', 'viewing', 'time', 'watch', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'myself-resemblance', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'proud', 'admit', 'fact', 'nice', 'see', 'film', ""n't"", 'concern', 'usual', 'farfetched', 'subject', 'matters', 'regarding', 'most', 'inane', 'things', 'one', 'rather', 'issues', 'can', 'resemble', 'amongst', 'many', 'others', 'there', 'such', 'instance', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'was', 'terrific', 'depicting', 'character', 'capable', 'delivering', 'humor', 'great', 'poignancy', 'screen', 'natural', 'is.After', 'having', 'deal', 'well', 'fifty', 'actors', 'goal', 'was', 'obtain', 'roll', 'Sonny', 'Burns-which', 'essentially', 'how', 'many', 'others', 'relate', 'character', 'would', 'like', 'express', 'feelings', 'rage', 'will', 'screen-Jeremy', 'Davies', 'impressed', 'filmmakers', 'uncanny', 'take', 'character', 'brooding', 'indistinctly-uttered', 'performance', 'ideally', 'Sonny', 'underlying', 'indignation', 'confusion', 'insecurities', 'synopsis', 'may', 'seem', 'premise', 'nineteen-fifties', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'Going', 'Way', 'emphatically', 'evoked', 'nostalgic', 'feelings', 'twisting', 'narrative', 'veers', 'relatively', 'straight-although', 'ennui-laden-jesting', 'boy', 'talk', 'surreal', 'trips', 'Sonny', 'disturbed', 'inner', 'world', 'culminating', 'profound', 'painful', 'moment', 'sexual', 'humiliation', 'So', 'may', 'seem', 'direct', 'comedy', 'really', ""n't"", 'such', 'character', 'deepest', 'desires', 'disintegrate', 'are', 'clear', 'mere', 'fantasy', ""'ll"", 'conspicuously', 'be', 'Besides', 'when', 'film', 'graphical', 'scenes', 'progress', 'slitting', 'wrists', 'attempt', 'use', 'such', 'unusual', 'actions', 'method', 'rehabilitation', 'been', 'humorous', 'means', 'when', 'huh', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'ignore', 'ostentatious', 'synopsis', 'back', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'package', 'bluntly', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy']",Going All the Way VHS

Jeremy Davies is well cast as the returning vet who comes home to an overloving and over bearing mother  and a strictly business father, and the girl he left behind. All of them  eventually get on his nerves, and finds himself unable to control his  sexuality. Ben Affleck is equally good as his buddy but has different views  on life. From the looks on his face he looks as if he prefers to have  worked with Matt Damon rather than with Davies, but what does that matter?  Not for everyone's taste or pleasure, but rather amusing to see,  especially if the girls saw Davies in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and  want to see more of him.

435203,A1JF8PSY0NPSYY,6304766017,Jeffery K. Matheus,"[40, 44]","Ignore Leonard Maltin's whiney review! Mark Pellington's &quot;Going All the Way&quot; is ANYTHING but a &quot;familiar seeming&quot; coming of age story! In fact, ignore the synopsis on this very DVD package that describes the film as a &quot;romantic comedy&quot;! Although the characters may have sex on their minds, there is not much real &quot;romance&quot; to be found in this particular tale! Based on Dan Wakefield's 1971 novel of the same name, &quot;Going All the Way&quot; is a somewhat darkly-shaded character study of two unlikely friends in 1950's Indianapolis. One of the charcters, Sonny Burns (played by &quot;Saving Private Ryan's&quot; Jeremy Davies), is the complete antithesis of a glamorous Hollywood leading man, and Davies completely brings to life the character described Wakefield's original book. His brooding, half-mumbled performance perfectly captures Sonny's underlying anger, confusion, and insecurity. Actress Amy Locane (who previously appeared in &quot;School Ties&quot;) also shines in a smaller part as Sonny's longsuffering girlfriend Buddy Porter. Although she does not have an over-abundance of dialogue, Locane conveys a lot of emotion with her expressive eyes and facial expressions...and as it turns out in the end, Buddy is probably the most &quot;with it&quot; character in this entire story. This new DVD release is a virtual tresure trove for fans of this film! The original rough cut of &quot;Going All the Way&quot; ran 3 hours and 10 minutes, and was cut down to less than 2 hours for its theatrical release. The DVD provides us with well over an hour of that &quot;missing&quot; footage, presented here as &quot;deleted scenes&quot;. In fact the first deleted scene is an entire 45 minute subplot that was excised from the film. (Fans of Wakefield's novel will recognize this section as the tale of Gunner Castleman's ill-fated beard!). This lengthy outttake alone makes the DVD worth owning! Some of the other &quot;missing footage&quot; shows us that Sonny's mother (played by film veteran Jill Clayburg) played a bigger part in the original storyline, as did Gunner's sassy girlfriend Marty (played convincingly by British accress Rachel Weisz), and Locane's character Buddy. There is also a more graphic take of the scene involving Sonny's attempted suicide, and it will probably be a little too intense for some viewers! A little less satisfying than the extensive &quot;outtakes reel&quot; is director Mark Pellington's commentary track, spoken in a deep monotonous voice. Pellington does give some useful insights into the film, but he also has the habit of saying &quot;we shot this on location&quot;, without ever telling us WHERE the location is! The director also fails to talk about the relation of the music to the film, although many of the 50's-era tunes heard on the soundtrack draw obvious lyrical parallels to the action on screen. (See Sonny and Gayle's &quot;love scene&quot; together for a great example of this.) Pellington mostly just comments on the performances on the actors, and how he could have shot scenes differetly. In fact Pellington reveals on the commentary track that he plans to re-edit and re-release &quot;Going All the Way&quot; within the next few years, adding some voice-over narration from Davies, and restoring some of the lost footage for an extended &quot;directors cut&quot;. Does this mean that I'll have another &quot;Going All the Way&quot; DVD to buy a few years down the road?
