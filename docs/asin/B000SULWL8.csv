They are all really good though but we like this one because it has a Christmas episode in there.  The Charlie and Lola cartoons, are so thoughtful and stylish and thinking outside the typical cartoon you see on tv these days.  The artwork, the music, and the characaters are so friendly and helpful towards one another and just a nice cartoon you want your kids to see instead of the violence and weirdness you see. I really like the relationship the brother-sister duo has.  Imaginative and just cozy.  This is a winner in our library.",5,"kids, (and parents), will LOVE this!",1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,600,"['Charlie', 'Lola', 'dvd', 'favorite', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'like', 'one', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'there', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'cartoons', 'are', 'so', 'thoughtful', 'stylish', 'thinking', 'typical', 'cartoon', 'see', 'tv', 'days', 'artwork', 'music', 'characaters', 'are', 'so', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'towards', 'one', 'just', 'nice', 'cartoon', 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'instead', 'violence', 'weirdness', 'see', 'really', 'relationship', 'brother-sister', 'duo', 'Imaginative', 'just', 'cozy', 'winner', 'library']","Charlie and Lola, Vol. 6 - How Many More Minutes Until Christmas"

1087899,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000SULWL8,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[27, 27]","All right, so maybe the DVD isn't extremely magic, but ""I Am Extremely Magic"" is one of the seven ""Charlie and Lola"" stories featured on this DVD. And after watching all of these episodes, you and/or your kids might feel that the show is extremely magic too.The title episode for this DVD is ""How Many More Minutes Until Christmas?"" It's a double-length story in which Charlie & Lola receive an Advent calendar for Christmas. They excitedly count down the days until Christmas,  but are shocked when it appears that Christmas has disappeared from their calendar. There's a lot of great moments and funny dialogue in this one and it conveys the magic of the holidays quite nicely. Oh, and the theme music in this episode has a holiday sound to it.My favorite and my best story on this DVD though is ""I Completely Know About Guinea Pigs"" as I own a guinea pig myself. The guinea pig in this story is very cute and there's a funny surprise ending.Other stories on this DVD are ""Charlie is Broken!,"" ""I Spy with My Little Eyes,"" ""I Am Really, Really, Really Concentrating"" and ""I Really Wonder What Plant I'm Growing."" The DVD also includes subtitles, as well as two bonus outtakes and the sweet ""It's Snowing"" video montage.",5,This DVD is Extremely Magic!,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1221,"['right', 'so', 'maybe', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'magic', 'Am', 'Extremely', 'Magic', 'one', 'seven', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'stories', 'featured', 'DVD', 'watching', 'episodes', 'and/or', 'kids', 'might', 'feel', 'show', 'extremely', 'magic', 'too.The', 'title', 'episode', 'DVD', 'How', 'Many', 'More', 'Minutes', 'Christmas', 'double-length', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'receive', 'Advent', 'calendar', 'Christmas', 'excitedly', 'count', 'down', 'days', 'Christmas', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'Christmas', 'disappeared', 'calendar', 'lot', 'great', 'moments', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'one', 'magic', 'holidays', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Oh', 'theme', 'music', 'episode', 'holiday', 'sound', 'it.My', 'favorite', 'best', 'story', 'DVD', 'though', 'Completely', 'Know', 'Guinea', 'Pigs', 'own', 'guinea', 'pig', 'guinea', 'pig', 'story', 'very', 'cute', 'funny', 'surprise', 'ending.Other', 'stories', 'DVD', 'are', 'Charlie', 'Broken', 'Spy', 'My', 'Little', 'Eyes', 'Am', 'Really', 'Really', 'Really', 'Concentrating', 'Really', 'Wonder', 'What', 'Plant', ""'m"", 'Growing', 'DVD', 'also', 'subtitles', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'bonus', 'outtakes', 'sweet', 'Snowing', 'video', 'montage']","Charlie and Lola, Vol. 6 - How Many More Minutes Until Christmas"
