1345735,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B003H8F3AY,Anne-Marie G,"[1, 1]","This is a well made film, the story is interesting and the characters are almost three dimensional. In some ways, I think this might be better suited to the stage, even though it was written as a screen play.Fisher is a southern belle, the heiress of two fortunes who happens to be cursed with having a father who is known as a murderer locally. Jimmy is the grandson of a former governor, but that is not something that easy to tell as his father his a drunk and his mother is in an asylum. Fisher decides to hire Jimmy to be her escort to various social events to avoid having to deal with her social pariah-ness.The problem is that Fisher actually cares more for Jimmy that she was willing to admit. While Jimmy is too cautious of Fisher to feel that way for her.The performances in this are great. Ellen Burstyn is fantastic as a woman who could be Fisher's future self. She gives Fisher some fabulously sassy advice. Ann Margaret plays Fisher's aunt (owner of the Teardrop Diamond earrings), its rather fun to see her being so prim and proper. Bryce Dallace Howard nails it as Fisher who is a very complex character. In the hands of a lesser actor Fisher could have come off as very unsympathetic and bratty. Instead we are privy to a very layered character (via Howard's layered performance). She is both vulnerable and strong, confused and determined, overwhelmed and overwhelming. Its really amazing to see. Chris Evans as Jimmy does a good job of being a sort of moral center for Fisher and himself, he is self righteous and confused but also sees Fisher with both eyes. She may not be someone that he thinks he can love be certainly he shows he is someone who cares for her. He does a good job of portraying how Jimmy wants her to be a better person, for herself.",3,Well Worth Watching,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,1773,"['well', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'three', 'dimensional', 'ways', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'stage', 'even', 'was', 'written', 'screen', 'play.Fisher', 'southern', 'belle', 'heiress', 'two', 'fortunes', 'who', 'be', 'cursed', 'having', 'father', 'who', 'known', 'murderer', 'locally', 'Jimmy', 'grandson', 'former', 'governor', 'not', 'something', 'easy', 'tell', 'father', 'drunk', 'mother', 'asylum', 'Fisher', 'hire', 'Jimmy', 'be', 'escort', 'various', 'social', 'events', 'avoid', 'having', 'deal', 'social', 'pariah-ness.The', 'problem', 'Fisher', 'actually', 'more', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'willing', 'admit', 'Jimmy', 'too', 'cautious', 'Fisher', 'feel', 'way', 'her.The', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'fantastic', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Fisher', 'future', 'self', 'fabulously', 'sassy', 'advice', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'Fisher', 'aunt', 'owner', 'Teardrop', 'Diamond', 'earrings', 'rather', 'fun', 'see', 'being', 'so', 'prim', 'proper', 'Bryce', 'Dallace', 'Howard', 'Fisher', 'who', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'Fisher', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'bratty', 'Instead', 'are', 'privy', 'very', 'layered', 'character', 'Howard', 'layered', 'performance', 'vulnerable', 'strong', 'confused', 'determined', 'overwhelmed', 'overwhelming', 'really', 'amazing', 'see', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Jimmy', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'sort', 'moral', 'center', 'Fisher', 'self', 'righteous', 'confused', 'also', 'Fisher', 'eyes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'someone', 'can', 'love', 'be', 'certainly', 'someone', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'how', 'Jimmy', 'be', 'better', 'person']",Loss Of A Teardrop Diamond

I bought this Blu-ray some time ago because I love Tennessee Williams and there were good reviews. No, this movie is new. It's every bit as effective as the old classics. More so I think. I put the disc in the player when I thought I had ten minutes to begin a brain file for prioritizing my next 50 or 60 movies. I only view movies when I am in the mood. As it happens events were jump'n all around me and I was also extremely interested in every detail of the Sochi Olympics. All that is to say that in six minutes my jaw had dropped and I was a palpitating. I'm a Minnesotan. I have been interested in the south since I was in the USAF in Greenville Mississippi. The Air Force provided a local man to teach office procedures to innocent young soldiers. This man was a local and he thought we should connect with our temporary environment. He talked Tennessee Williams and southern living because the South was outside the door, and he hoped we would get it. I guess I got it. It ""took"" on me as I was developing into a life long ""activist."" The point is that there is so much more to the South than meets the eye. I traveled the Mississippi on the Delta Queen twice on a mission unrelated to my topic here. Suffice it to say, the American South is a different country. Some of it is wonderful and some is not. I have never seen a Williams film or play that I did not want to see experience again. This movie is so much more than I expected. The beauty of the South, the incredible actors, and cinematography. I was on board for the full trip. So much story and emotion and insight. Next time I'll view it on a hot day, and I'll have a mint julep with it.

1345738,A32MTXFASQXBX,B003H8F3AY,Brent Trafton,"[7, 8]","""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,"" is a real gem but it is not for everyone.  If you are not a big Tennessee Williams fan, you probably will not like it.  If you are unfamiliar with Tennessee Williams, then you are better off watching ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" or ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.""Admittedly, this is not one of Williams' best stories.  The reason the film works so well is the acting and directing.I had seen Bryce Dallas Howard in a few other films but they did not prepare me for this absolutely thrilling performance.  This is not just the best performance of the year but it is the best performance in the past several years.  She brings the character of Fisher Willow to life the way that Vivian Leigh did for Blanche DuBois.  In many ways Fisher Willow is like a young version of Blanche.Fisher is a typical Williams' heroine.  She initially comes off as a selfish, self centered, Southern Belle but underneath she is much more fragile than anyone suspects.  Bryce Dallas Howard is able to bring this out with such complexity and nuance that we can sympathize with a character that we should not care about so much.  Even in her best moments she seems as though she could shatter at any moment.This performance alone is enough reason to see this film.The story follows the familiar themes covered in other Tennessee Williams stories:  loneliness, loss of wealth, fall from grace, and battling interior demons.  The teardrop diamond could represent the wealth and status her family once had.  It is not just a $5000 jewel.  It is a symbol of what her family once was and what was once the old South.Jodie Markell does an impressive job directing.  Her style is old school.  She knows when to let the camera linger and when to let the scenes play out.  The film does not seem rushed and it never drags.  The cinematography is gorgeous with burnished orange dominating the color palette.""The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,"" may not be one of the four best movies made from a Tennessee Williams story but it is not far behind.

The good news is that it now comes to us in a version that must surely please its author.  Bryce Dallas Howard is electrifying as Fisher Willow, a heroine as complex and engaging as any that Tennessee Williams ever created, and Chris Evans gives her excellent support.  I was involved with their struggle from beginning to end, and actually found myself sighing with relief when they finally found each other!

1345743,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003H8F3AY,Grady Harp,"[2, 9]","THE LOSS OF A TEARDROP DIAMOND is a film that tries hard to be significant and important and barely keeps the viewer seated until it is over. The 'screenplay' is credited to Tennessee Williams (who has been dead since 1983), having been written in 1957, a year after 'Baby Doll', and while the screenplay may have been completed by Williams, it has obviously been 'touched up' by someone else: Williams more than likely never planned to have the work on celluloid. The cast is adequate, given the material, and the direction (Jodie Markell) is pretty shoddy. It probably would have been best to leave this 'screenplay' by one of America's greatest playwrights on the shelf.Fisher Willlow (Bryce Dallas Howard) is from wealth in Tennessee, but her family is disliked because of a levee built by the father that ruined the hopes of farmers in the area. She is a shallow, resented, needy, attention hungry woman, unmarried and past her Southern prime, having spent her 'debut years' abroad studying in Paris (and being hospitalized in Zurich for mental illness). She returns home, fancies the hunky Jimmy Dobyne (Chris Evans) who is the grandson of the ex-mayor of the town, but who spends his time caring for this alcoholic failure of a father (Will Patton) and his institutionalized mentally ill mother (Barbara Garrick). Not having viable social connections, Fisher invites Jimmy to be her social escort, buys him tuxedoes and clothes to make him look like a wealthy suitor, borrows the family teardrop diamond earrings from Cornelia (Ann-Margaret), and is off to a Halloween party hosted by Julie (Mamie Gummer). On the way into the party Fisher loses one of the teardrop diamonds, and flies into a panic. She is summoned upstairs by the mother of Julie - Addie (Ellen Burstyn) - who has had multiple strokes and longs to die. Knowing that Fisher is a headstrong woman, Addie convinces Fisher to 'assist' her death by handing her what amounts to be an overdose of pills. Meanwhile, downstairs, Jimmy has taken up with a guest of Julie's - Vinnie (Jessica Collins), who has a history of being a salesclerk in a drugstore thus making her not of the same echelon as the others at the party. Apparently Jimmy and Vinnie had been friends before and passion enters seemingly binding the two social misfits. But reality steps in when Fisher discovers the developments and the social rules win out. The ending is too sanguine to mention.The elements that were the recipe for Tennessee William's highly successful plays and films are repeated here, but now we have no character with whom we can empathize: everyone is a plagiarized caricature of Williams' popular tropes.

Also, there seems to be a recurrent animosity against Bryce Dallas Howard as an actress that I find hard to justify.  I can think of few others who are showing such promise at an early age.And as for the screenplay that is the inevitable draw of the film, it certainly falls canonically among Tennessee Williams' lesser works; yet even his lesser works have always carried much magic, and an idiomatic command of poetic elegance that no American writer since has matched.We all know well Blanche's ruminations about paper lanterns as a metaphor for magic in the world; people far smarter and wiser than me have called those words among the most deeply felt ever written in the English language.  In this film, Fisher Willow has her moment too, hers more nuanced than the melodramatic flourish of Vivian Leigh's delivery.  She pines for the company not of strangers, but of people who have meaning, who aspire to art and creation, and so forth.  They are words meant to be heard spoken, rather than spit out in this no-name review on the Internet.So all of that is to say, the best you can do is ignore the shrugging critics and watch this film.
