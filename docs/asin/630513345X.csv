450998,A364W6U6YL219D,630513345X,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[0, 3]","Boiling Point (1993) Like the title says, more like Simmering Point. Wesley Snipes and Dennis Hopper star in this cop thriller, and they're up to the game as always. But the script never really takes off, and it leaves this movie at best mediocre. Snipes is the Federal agent in pursuit of killer Hopper and his partner, but everybody spends more time shmoozing with their respective girlfriends than they do with the action scenes. It's really too bad, because Snipes has the stuff to be a Big Time Action Hero; he's just got to pick better scripts than this or Passenger 57. The movie gets a big boost from Hopper, whose energy just draws you in whenever he is on screen. It just has no direction in this case, so this one is merely okay. Great supporting cast though: Lolita Davidovich (Raising Cain), Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), James Tolkan (Back to the Future 1-3), Paul Gleason (The Breakfast Club) Seymour Cassel (Dick Tracy), Tobin Bell (Saws 1-Infinity), Jonathan Banks (Beverly Hills Cop), and Dan Hedaya (Fair Game).",2,212 degrees is the Boiling Point.

The scriptwriter should have waited until ""Heat"" came out before offering this up as a tension builder.The way the scenes went back and forth from crook to cop was interesting in a satirical way.Pulling Valerie Perrine out of retirement was another surprse cameo.The noir attempt did not work on anyone who knew Newark from LA. Dennis Hopper was too wrapped up in the 40's, making you think he was going ""Back to Future"" on us here. The explosion expected, the one where Viggo outwits Hopper, does not happen, or vice versa. Instead they stop the action and shut down with a lame ending to a promising caper flick.The dangerous charm of Viggo burns into your memory.

451001,AL0KPNTH2JOHO,630513345X,Joshua Hartsfield,"[2, 3]",I like this movie. I don't know why so many people hate it. You see that in this film this film which makes it so interesting between the good guy and the bad guy. They are givin one week on opposite sides to get things done. Meaning the bad guy wants to make his final score and the guy wants to catch him. I like the way the movie ended. It's a shame that the two bad guys have one thing in common and that is they are eventually to win over their girlfriends in their way. But the good guy unlike the bad guys can't get his ex wife back although what he really wants is to spend time with his son and possibly have him move in with him. But as soon as he see's his ex wife with another man he stops and reliazes that he really can't get her back since her new boyfriend is an good average joe type that is not a cop but the good guy. Isn't it ironic how so many women these day's date the wrong type of like the bad boy's and thugs but they won't date cops. It's really is crazy for the good guy but there is hope for him since there is a different woman for him that may be sort of like a hooker or stripper of some sort But she loves him for him. And doesn't mind what type of Job he does. She does like it and believes that he would be miserable without that Job. And unlike his ex wife she really supports him. I do like the part in the ending when the credits roll it is revealed that they are together and now resides in Newark New Jersey.

451002,A25RN8X70DSZLU,630513345X,JRP,"[0, 2]","This is another review for a film that either came out in 1990 or 2003 this is 20 years ago Boiling Point or as I call it Boring Point. This movie is bad a very boring. I can tell you the plot in my retrospective in quick fashion. This is going to be quick. The movie was made on a budget of $10 million made $10 million it was a bomb. Directed by James B Harris I haven't seen any other movie by him he has mostly been a producer. The movie stars Wesley Snipes as Jimmy Mercer, Dennis Hopper as Rudolph ""Red"" Diamond, Viggo Mortensen as Ronnie, Dan Hadaya as Detective Brady, & Christine Elise as Carol. The story is this crook named Rudloph ""Red"" Diamond is out of prison he also has this patsy named Ronnie. You're introduced to 2 Detective's Jimmy Mercer & Brady 1 of their partners is killed in a motel by Ronnie. He gets away. You have this sub plot that goes nowhere where Mercer goes to see his Ex Wife & Son. ""Red"" Try's to get back together with his Ex Wife she wants nothing to do with him Ronnie try's to get back together well she wants nothing to do with him. ""Red & his ex go & do it btw Dennis Hopper looks as if he getting ready to play King Koopa around this time. His ex wants him to leave even though they just had s  3  x. ""Red"" goes to these crime bosses he has a week to pay them $50,000. You also have this big mean looking guy that works for these crime bosses. It looks like he's going to have some kind of confrontation with Wesley Snipes you could've used him in. Anyway Mercer & Brady arrest this guy named Virgil who tells them about conterfit money at his house he has a wife who is a drug addict. She tries to escape but she is caught by Mercer she tells him that her husband deals with this red headed man. That chick ends up blowing herself up in the house later on.  BTW Dennis Hopper's hair is a golden blonde color not red. Speaking of which ""Red"" hooks up with this lady named Vikki & they go to this club called this club called The Palace which is a type of 40's club I'm sorry but I didn't care for the music or the soundtrack or the score at all. Ronnie meets this guy in a parking lot who is in some kind of crime syndicate he has money Ronnie knocks that guy out with a crow bar then shoots him a couple of times with a sawed off shotgun. Mercer questions this guy named Waxman & he gives him the named of ""Red Diamond. So you have ""Red"" try to get back together with his ex & she agrees to meet him at The Palace. Mercer wants to see his son he finds out his ex  wife has another man & feels like he's better off without them. See I told you a useless sub plot. Mercer & Brady follow ""Red"" & Ronnie to this suite. ""Red"" & Ronnie go to this Penthouse Ronnie kills the crime boss & some other guy. ""Red"" Tells Ronnie to take the money & meet him at The Palace. When he escapes he is arrested by Mercer they all go to The Palace where they can arrest Ronnie. ""Red"" meets Ronnie as they were suppose to he tells Ronnie whats going on & he sets up an escape which is a complete joke Ronnie pulls a shot gun out on Detective Brady Mercer shoots Ronnie dead. ""Red"" tyr's to escape but is caught by Police as they take him off to jail ""Red's"" ex sees him taken off in the back of the car. Then it says Mercer hooked up with that Vikki chick & ""Red"" Diamond is in prison fo life. I know I did a bad job explaining the plot but I'm sorry this movie was so boring & pretty bad. I mean the acting is dull for the most part. The plot with cterfit money seems like it should be in a cop[ show. I know this movie is based off a book & I'm sure the book is better. I know this movie is well liked on here & you have every right to love or hate any movie you want &  I will probably get comments saying all I wanted to big action scenes in it. Not ture cause if you followed this series of reviews I reviewed Bad Lieutenant back in November for it's 20th anniversry & I enjoyed that movie that has 0 action & is a character piece. The music was bad I mean I have to bring up Bad Lieutenant again Pleading My Love by Johnny Ace fit cause of the character on the edge. This song called dream by Johnny Mercer just feels flat. A sub plot that is totally useless & just  look at the other movies released around this time Nowhere To Run, Falling Down & Street Knight were all better. James B Harris did a bad job I can see why he hasn't directed anything of note. Wesley Snipes gave the only good performance but  that's not saying much. Dennis Hoper was there but his performance wasn't. Dan Hedaya wasn't in the movie a whole lot. Viggo Mortensen did a bad job. Chrisine Elise was barely in the movie. There is nothing going for it I mean if you see Boiling Point & you love great not going to hold it against you. Everyone has their likes & dislikes. Boiling Point for me is a forgettable boring & there is nothing that keeps me involved.

Which is what you should do with this crummy flick.Wannabe crime drama patched together with a simplistic and moronically pedestrian screenplay. Hammy overacting doesn't help, but I blame Harris for that - lack of directional oversight. And touches of abusive chauvinism thrown in for effect doesn't help - because we all know how much a woman gets off on being bitch-slapped and shown what she really needs is strong man in her life with some hard lovin'. Yeah. Right.About as ridiculous as you can get without broaching into satire.I would've enjoyed this more if the 70s-era dialogue and interplay was intentional - something like Mel Gibson's 'Payback'. But unintentional means some producers got hosed funding a loser project.And speaking of which, I was really shocked to see Olivier Grunier listed as one of the Executive Producers. The 90's muscle/action star was obviously trying to expand his reach into the business of moviemaking - proving that just because you've done time in front of the camera doesn't necessarily guarantee success behind it. And this validates this film fact: Surrounding yourself with Oscar winners (and future nominees) doesn't mean squat.An embarrassment for all involved.

HarrisCast:  Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Lolita Davidovich, Viggo Mortensen, Seymour Cassel, Jonathan Banks, Christine Elise, Tony Lo Bianco, Dan Hedaya.Running Time:  92 minutesRated R for langauge and violence.""Boiling Point is too pithy to be a successful thriller; too low profile to be a successful action caper. If the plot had thrown more twists, offered more insight on the characters psyche, or had a much more involving story, the film could have sufficed even as a decent thriller. Had there been explosives, chase scenes, and other good action ploys, this movie could've made a decent action film; however, it is not much of either category, thus suffering from mediocrity.  Police detective, Jimmy Mercer (Wesley Snipes) and his partner, Brady (Dan Hedaya), are investigating the shooting death of an undercover U.S. Treasury agent who investigating a counterfeit ring. The two guys who he was dealing with, gunned him down and fled the scene, before Mercer and Brady could intervene and save their partner.  Turns out the murderers are fast-talking Red Diamond (Dennis Hopper), so named because of his red hair, who owes fifty grand to another gangster within seven days and his partner, Ronnie (Viggo Mortensen), an eerie kind of guy who is never sure if Red is just handing him a line of garbage with all the schemes he involves him in. In order to make it through the next week alive, these two crooks need a get rich quick counterfeit scheme.Meanwhile, Mercer and Brady are going from one informant to another, trying to get them to give up information about Red and Ronnie, a description, their location, anything. Sometimes they're successful and sometimes not. The movie goes on and on like as the two trail one person after another trying to get close on the trail of Red and Ronnie. It is wholly uninteresting, offering no real suspense and even less action to fill the time. The movie fails to deliver any real substance in between, which is sad when you consider the possibility of your characters, and especially, the potential of the actors.  At points this is an enjoyable cop thriller but for the majority it is a misjudged affair that lacks either an emotionally involving depth or a fast paced tension that holds you. The problem is that it cannot decide which of these it wants to do and it is not good enough to manage to both in the way.  Snipes does try hard but he can't get a human face that we buy into, specifically his ""running away with hooker"" thing is just laughably unconvincing. Hopper seems to be in another film and enjoys just wining and dining women but he only serves to slow the film down and distract from the main thread. Mortensen plays a standard role but does it pretty well, likewise Davidovich does well with what little she has. Support from familiar faces such as Cassel, Banks and Gleason all give the impression of a film deep in quality but sadly this is only an impression.  Overall, this is a fairly poor film that tried to be better than the genre but failed to achieve its goals. In a plot that resembles the later ""Heat"", the threads don't work, with no emotional involvement in the characters and no thrills or tension to really speak of. The cast deserved better and so do the audience; there are several cop thrillers that try the same thing as Boiling Point, it would be to your advantage to watch one of the ones that actually does it well.",2,Boiling Point  (1993),1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3434,"['Director', 'John', 'B.', 'HarrisCast', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Christine', 'Elise', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'Dan', 'Hedaya.Running', 'Time', '92', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'langauge', 'violence', 'Boiling', 'Point', 'too', 'pithy', 'be', 'successful', 'thriller', 'too', 'low', 'profile', 'be', 'successful', 'action', 'caper', 'plot', 'had', 'thrown', 'more', 'twists', 'offered', 'more', 'insight', 'characters', 'psyche', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'involving', 'story', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'sufficed', 'even', 'decent', 'thriller', 'Had', 'been', 'explosives', 'chase', 'scenes', 'other', 'good', 'action', 'ploys', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'category', 'thus', 'suffering', 'mediocrity', 'Police', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'Mercer', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'partner', 'Brady', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'are', 'investigating', 'shooting', 'death', 'undercover', 'U.S.', 'Treasury', 'agent', 'who', 'investigating', 'counterfeit', 'ring', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'was', 'dealing', 'gunned', 'down', 'fled', 'scene', 'Mercer', 'Brady', 'could', 'intervene', 'save', 'partner', 'out', 'murderers', 'are', 'fast-talking', 'Red', 'Diamond', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'so', 'named', 'red', 'hair', 'who', 'fifty', 'grand', 'gangster', 'seven', 'days', 'partner', 'Ronnie', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'eerie', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'sure', 'Red', 'just', 'handing', 'line', 'garbage', 'schemes', 'order', 'make', 'next', 'week', 'alive', 'two', 'crooks', 'need', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'counterfeit', 'scheme.Meanwhile', 'Mercer', 'Brady', 'are', 'going', 'one', 'informant', 'trying', 'get', 'give', 'up', 'information', 'Red', 'Ronnie', 'description', 'location', 'anything', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'successful', 'sometimes', 'not', 'movie', 'two', 'trail', 'one', 'person', 'trying', 'get', 'close', 'trail', 'Red', 'Ronnie', 'wholly', 'uninteresting', 'offering', 'real', 'suspense', 'even', 'less', 'action', 'fill', 'time', 'movie', 'deliver', 'real', 'substance', 'sad', 'when', 'consider', 'possibility', 'characters', 'especially', 'potential', 'actors', 'points', 'enjoyable', 'cop', 'thriller', 'majority', 'misjudged', 'affair', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'depth', 'fast', 'paced', 'tension', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'manage', 'way', 'Snipes', 'try', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'human', 'face', 'buy', 'specifically', 'running', 'away', 'hooker', 'thing', 'just', 'laughably', 'unconvincing', 'Hopper', 'be', 'film', 'just', 'wining', 'dining', 'women', 'only', 'slow', 'film', 'down', 'distract', 'main', 'thread', 'Mortensen', 'standard', 'role', 'pretty', 'well', 'likewise', 'Davidovich', 'well', 'what', 'little', 'Support', 'familiar', 'such', 'Cassel', 'Banks', 'Gleason', 'give', 'impression', 'film', 'deep', 'quality', 'sadly', 'only', 'impression', 'Overall', 'fairly', 'poor', 'film', 'tried', 'be', 'better', 'genre', 'failed', 'achieve', 'goals', 'plot', 'later', 'Heat', 'threads', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'characters', 'thrills', 'tension', 'really', 'speak', 'cast', 'deserved', 'better', 'so', 'do', 'audience', 'are', 'several', 'cop', 'thrillers', 'try', 'same', 'thing', 'Boiling', 'Point', 'would', 'be', 'advantage', 'watch', 'one', 'ones', 'actually', 'well']",N/A
