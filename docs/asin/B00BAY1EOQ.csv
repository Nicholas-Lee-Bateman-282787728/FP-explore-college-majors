1623778,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B00BAY1EOQ,Amit Talpade,"[16, 16]","It has been three years since 3 idiots and Aamir Khan had not returned to the movies, then he decides to make a movie with a small set up and a director called Reema Kagti (Honeymoon Travels and writer Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), which is a unique state for a star of his stature. Then the delays begin and the endless waiting as the movie gets postponed for release several times for many reasons -that it is similar to Kahaani, it's based on a graphic novel ` An Act of Providence and Aamir's so called head butting with the director ( when has that not happened with Aamir starrers) and finally the endless text messages before the release which gave away the movie ending.I watched the film on the first day of its release itself, a luxury that I give myself and I loved the film. In my view, after a year of mediocre films - there finally was a film that I could think about for a long time. Armaan Kapoor ( a filmstar) is killed in a freak accident on the promenade near Worli, Mumbai. Inspector Shekhavat ( Aamir Khan) comes in to investigate the accident and tries searching for clues but there are not any. While trying to piece this mess, he is also trying to resolve many personal issues in his life and family. Wifey ( Rani Mukerjee) and Inspector have drifted apart after their sons accident in a boating accident many years ago. He finally discovers that there is a brothel nearby and a helpful escort ( Kareena Kapoor) helps him solve the mystery. Let's just stop here because writing anymore about the story would give it away. When the final credit roll, a lot of you will say..I knew the murderer all along...I wish I could but the movie held my attention...The screenplay is well written and maintains a steady grip on you throughout the 2 hour and 14 minute runtime. The final 15 minutes were blockbuster and at a point I literally jumped out of my seat, amazing end to a slow stroll....The cinematography (Mohanan) is another feather in the hat of the makers, and is superb. Mumbai looks so pretty despite the grime and the pollution. The mood and the setting is just so perfect throughout the film.Kareena Kapoor is miscast (me thought), she looks too glamorous to play the part of a street walker from the rough trade. Nevertheless, she has an extremely important role and she delivers.Rani Mukherhjee without make up looks so gorgeous.....a dazzling performance of a woman longing for her lost family and husband. Her explosion at Aamir outside their house ( amazing location) fantastic- a professional discovering her craft after years of circus shows.Aamir Khan delivers yet another finely tuned, underplayed, nuanced performance of many, many layers. This coming after Three Idiots would be like bread between wine tastings to clean the palate. It seems to me that he deliberately choose this role because he wanted people to forget Rancho and embrace the policeman with the creased forehead, scowl and the bags under his eyes from a lack of sleep. He returns to the realm of commercial cinema with Dhoom3 and PK in 2013.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is in a very significant role and is fantastic. Watch his scene with the prostitute when he confesses his dreams of starting a life with her.Talaash is an amazing film, a respite from the vulgarity of films in 2012. A great work by Reema Kagti ( She gets it....). Your search for a great film is over....five stars. 11/30/2012",5,The spoiler free review,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,3393,"['been', 'three', 'years', '3', 'idiots', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'had', 'not', 'returned', 'movies', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'small', 'set', 'up', 'director', 'called', 'Reema', 'Kagti', 'Honeymoon', 'Travels', 'writer', 'Zindagi', 'Na', 'Milegi', 'Dobara', 'unique', 'state', 'star', 'stature', 'Then', 'delays', 'begin', 'endless', 'waiting', 'movie', 'postponed', 'release', 'several', 'times', 'many', 'reasons', 'similar', 'Kahaani', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Act', 'Providence', 'Aamir', 'so', 'called', 'head', 'butting', 'director', 'when', 'not', 'happened', 'Aamir', 'starrers', 'finally', 'endless', 'text', 'messages', 'release', 'gave', 'away', 'movie', 'ending.I', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'day', 'release', 'luxury', 'give', 'loved', 'film', 'view', 'year', 'mediocre', 'films', 'finally', 'was', 'film', 'could', 'think', 'long', 'time', 'Armaan', 'Kapoor', 'filmstar', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'promenade', 'Worli', 'Mumbai', 'Inspector', 'Shekhavat', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'investigate', 'accident', 'tries', 'searching', 'clues', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'piece', 'mess', 'also', 'trying', 'resolve', 'many', 'personal', 'issues', 'life', 'family', 'Wifey', 'Rani', 'Mukerjee', 'Inspector', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'sons', 'accident', 'boating', 'accident', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'brothel', 'nearby', 'helpful', 'escort', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Let', 'just', 'stop', 'here', 'writing', 'anymore', 'story', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'When', 'final', 'credit', 'roll', 'lot', 'will', 'say..I', 'knew', 'murderer', 'wish', 'could', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'screenplay', 'well', 'written', 'steady', 'grip', '2', 'hour', '14', 'minute', 'runtime', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'were', 'blockbuster', 'point', 'literally', 'jumped', 'seat', 'amazing', 'end', 'slow', 'stroll', '.The', 'cinematography', 'Mohanan', 'feather', 'hat', 'makers', 'superb', 'Mumbai', 'so', 'pretty', 'grime', 'pollution', 'mood', 'setting', 'just', 'so', 'perfect', 'film.Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'miscast', 'thought', 'too', 'glamorous', 'play', 'part', 'street', 'walker', 'rough', 'trade', 'Nevertheless', 'extremely', 'important', 'role', 'delivers.Rani', 'Mukherhjee', 'make', 'up', 'looks', 'so', 'gorgeous', '..a', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'woman', 'longing', 'lost', 'family', 'husband', 'explosion', 'Aamir', 'house', 'amazing', 'location', 'fantastic-', 'professional', 'discovering', 'craft', 'years', 'circus', 'shows.Aamir', 'Khan', 'delivers', 'yet', 'finely', 'tuned', 'underplayed', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'many', 'many', 'layers', 'coming', 'Three', 'Idiots', 'would', 'be', 'bread', 'wine', 'tastings', 'clean', 'palate', 'deliberately', 'choose', 'role', 'wanted', 'people', 'forget', 'Rancho', 'embrace', 'policeman', 'creased', 'forehead', 'scowl', 'bags', 'eyes', 'lack', 'sleep', 'realm', 'commercial', 'cinema', 'Dhoom3', 'PK', '2013.Nawazuddin', 'Siddiqui', 'very', 'significant', 'role', 'fantastic', 'Watch', 'scene', 'prostitute', 'when', 'dreams', 'starting', 'life', 'her.Talaash', 'amazing', 'film', 'respite', 'vulgarity', 'films', '2012', 'great', 'work', 'Reema', 'Kagti', 'search', 'great', 'film', '.five', 'stars', '11/30/2012']",Talaash

1623782,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00BAY1EOQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","One late evening, near Mumbai's red light district, a car careens off the infamous Seaface Road and hurtles into the sea. The car's lone occupant doesn't survive the plunge. And when word circulates that the casualty is a famous Bollywood film star, what starts out as a routine auto accident investigation soon catapults the morose lead detective, Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat (Aamir Khan), into a haunting maze of deception, fatal attraction, and murder. Maybe it's significant that similar freak accidents have happened on that same road.The first two-thirds of TALAASH unfolds as a taut, hard-boiled mystery. And then the third act comes along and pretty much plagiarizes a movie I can't possibly mention because it'll give the whole thing away. As someone mentions in the DVD features, TALAASH, on the surface, is a suspenseful whodunit. But peel that away and we glimpse the essence of the thing. It's about loss and our cast of characters' ability (or inability) to cope with loss.Surprising absolutely no one, Aamir Khan submits another riveting performance, ratcheting his glower up to white heat intensity even as he masks a tortured vulnerability, a repressed self-loathing. Also, he has a mustache. You can't question the guy's commitment to his role. Khan didn't know how to swim before shooting this film, but he underwent three months of swimming lessons for a particularly arduous underwater sequence. As Inspector Shekhawat, he worries at the threads of his high-profile case, pursuing the elusive clues with admirable tenacity. But one wonders about him. Shekhawat still reels from the loss of his eight-year-old son, and associated pangs of guilt. His marriage is rocky. His patient, long-suffering wife Roshni (Rani Mukerji) abides, but she's taken to consulting a psychic medium. So she, too, isn't over their son's death.In this confluence of professional morass and personal desolation, Shekhawat unearths a surprising ally. For a while now Shekhawat, unable to sleep, has been haunting Mumbai's seedy underbelly, restlessly driving around. During one such excursion he meets Rosie (Kareena Kapoor), a sympathetic lady of the evening. Rosie tips him to various leads in his case and eventually becomes his confidante. I still thinkJab We Metoffered Kapoor her best role, but she's pretty terrific as ""Rosie."" What she does best here is layer in this air of mystery. A suggestive smile. A pained, knowing look. She's good.TALAASH (meaning ""Search"") has a running time of 140 minutes. Whether you think that's too long depends on whether you'd fallen under the movie's spell. It's a slow burn picture but, me, I liked the neo-noir sensibilities and how polished the movie looks and that the score is often melancholy and occasionally bluesy. The acting is really solid. For two-thirds of the film the screenplay keeps things close to the vest and so I was never quite sure where things were headed, and this was a good thing. I want to say that you're kept guessing to the end, but I'd be fairly astounded if, during the final 30 or 40 minutes, you don't clue in to the big reveal. So, yeah, the ending disappointed me, mostly because up to then TALAASH was staking a claim as an accomplished psychological thriller. As it is, it's still pretty good. Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor keep you invested. Rani Mukerji, however, is wasted.What I've got is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature film which is in Hindi but offers the option for sub-titles in English, Arabic, French, and Dutch. Disc 1 also has the option to jump to any of the film's musical sequences. Disc 2 has the following bonus stuff (totaling 00:42:09 minutes):- Making of TALAASH featurette (mostly in English)- Making of the jazzy musical number """"Muskaanein Jhooti Hai"""" (mostly in Hindi, no English sub-titles)- ""Snippets"" - 6 short clips lifted from the ""Making Of"" featurette- 13 Deleted Scenes (with optional English sub-titles)",4,"...Aamir and his terrifying mustache, Kareena and her soiled dove...",1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,3931,"['One', 'late', 'evening', 'Mumbai', 'red', 'light', 'district', 'car', 'infamous', 'Seaface', 'Road', 'hurtles', 'sea', 'car', 'lone', 'occupant', ""n't"", 'survive', 'plunge', 'when', 'word', 'casualty', 'famous', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'star', 'what', 'out', 'routine', 'auto', 'accident', 'investigation', 'soon', 'catapults', 'morose', 'lead', 'detective', 'Inspector', 'Surjan', 'Singh', 'Shekhawat', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'haunting', 'maze', 'deception', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'murder', 'significant', 'similar', 'freak', 'accidents', 'have', 'happened', 'same', 'road.The', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'TALAASH', 'unfolds', 'taut', 'hard-boiled', 'mystery', 'then', 'third', 'act', 'along', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'mention', ""'ll"", 'give', 'whole', 'thing', 'away', 'someone', 'mentions', 'DVD', 'features', 'TALAASH', 'surface', 'suspenseful', 'whodunit', 'peel', 'away', 'glimpse', 'essence', 'thing', 'loss', 'cast', 'characters', 'ability', 'inability', 'cope', 'loss.Surprising', 'absolutely', 'one', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'riveting', 'performance', 'ratcheting', 'glower', 'up', 'white', 'heat', 'intensity', 'even', 'tortured', 'vulnerability', 'repressed', 'self-loathing', 'Also', 'mustache', 'ca', ""n't"", 'question', 'guy', 'commitment', 'role', 'Khan', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'swim', 'shooting', 'film', 'underwent', 'three', 'months', 'swimming', 'lessons', 'particularly', 'arduous', 'underwater', 'sequence', 'Inspector', 'Shekhawat', 'threads', 'high-profile', 'case', 'pursuing', 'elusive', 'clues', 'admirable', 'tenacity', 'one', 'wonders', 'Shekhawat', 'still', 'loss', 'eight-year-old', 'son', 'associated', 'pangs', 'guilt', 'marriage', 'rocky', 'patient', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Roshni', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'taken', 'consulting', 'psychic', 'medium', 'too', ""n't"", 'son', 'death.In', 'confluence', 'professional', 'morass', 'personal', 'desolation', 'Shekhawat', 'surprising', 'ally', 'while', 'now', 'Shekhawat', 'unable', 'sleep', 'been', 'haunting', 'Mumbai', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'restlessly', 'driving', 'around', 'one', 'such', 'excursion', 'Rosie', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'sympathetic', 'lady', 'evening', 'Rosie', 'various', 'leads', 'case', 'eventually', 'confidante', 'still', 'thinkJab', 'Metoffered', 'Kapoor', 'best', 'role', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'Rosie', 'What', 'best', 'here', 'layer', 'air', 'mystery', 'suggestive', 'smile', 'pained', 'knowing', 'look', 'good.TALAASH', 'meaning', 'Search', 'running', 'time', '140', 'minutes', 'think', 'too', 'long', 'depends', ""'d"", 'fallen', 'movie', 'spell', 'slow', 'burn', 'picture', 'liked', 'neo-noir', 'sensibilities', 'how', 'polished', 'movie', 'score', 'often', 'melancholy', 'occasionally', 'bluesy', 'acting', 'really', 'solid', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'screenplay', 'things', 'close', 'vest', 'so', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'headed', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'want', 'say', ""'re"", 'kept', 'guessing', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'fairly', 'astounded', 'final', '30', '40', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'clue', 'big', 'reveal', 'So', 'yeah', 'ending', 'disappointed', 'mostly', 'then', 'TALAASH', 'was', 'staking', 'claim', 'accomplished', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'keep', 'invested', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'however', 'wasted.What', ""'ve"", 'got', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'Disc', '1', 'feature', 'film', 'Hindi', 'option', 'sub-titles', 'English', 'Arabic', 'French', 'Dutch', 'Disc', '1', 'also', 'option', 'jump', 'film', 'musical', 'sequences', 'Disc', '2', 'following', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'totaling', '00:42:09', 'minutes', 'Making', 'TALAASH', 'featurette', 'mostly', 'English', 'Making', 'jazzy', 'musical', 'number', 'Muskaanein', 'Jhooti', 'Hai', 'mostly', 'Hindi', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'Snippets', '6', 'short', 'clips', 'lifted', 'Making', 'featurette-', '13', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'optional', 'English', 'sub-titles']",Talaash
