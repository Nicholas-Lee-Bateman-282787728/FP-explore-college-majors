This is a Swedish tv production with subtitles but it seems more authentic to Mankell's novels to hear the actors speak Swedish, to see Swedish architecture in the background, to see the reserve of the characters' behaviors. The episodes are a meaty 1.5 hours, so you really get the complexity of story lines and the detailed steps undertaken in solving the crimes. The Wallander character in the tv show seems more 3-dimensional than the novel...he has a party at his house, he owns a dog named Jussi, he develops relationships with his co-workers. The character in the novel is more of a workaholic who lives an unhealthy lifestyle and has diabetes...and in the final book, (SPOILER ALERT) ends up with Alzheimers.

Anyone that has seen it rates if 5 stars and with good reason. Unfortunately, Netlix has this season 2 (not noted in the product description) in its entirety as part of its membership archive (for $8). Equally unfortunately Amazon has Season 1 in it's entirety BUT which they have decided to hack into four pieces and charge $30 for each piece of 3 episodes each or $120 for the 13 episodes. Or you can rent each episode for $5 ($75 for the privilege). To date this is the most egregious exploitation of its customers Amazon has engaged in. Not many are going to rent this for $5 let alone pay $120 for the series. Nor are they going to pay $80 for a Netflix-like subscription to watch Amazon films many of which are available with Netflix and those that are not only $2.99 - a fair rental price. Nor are they going to refer anyone to this service. If Amazon wanted to promote its rental streams they would not gouge the price of their best material in rentals or sales. As a store manager one told us (as we negotiated to buy a few dozen surplus glasses he had) ""Better in your house than in my store"" and gave us a price that was much less than we expected. We have been back there a dozen times and referred at least six dozen foreigner visitors to that store. Eventually this will be available elsewhere and we will simply wait for it (there are other excellent Danish and Swedish and French police drama series out there right now).

Martinson came across as a jerk out for Wallander's job. It was stupid that he watched a pedifile's house for many nights and while he watches it , it is spray painted and yet he stops watching so they come back and throw rocks and the mother is killed, with no follow up on catchng the culprits even though  he had a good idea who they were. Swvartman came across as a totally stupid cop who has more interest in his mobile phone than his job, and with no actions taken against him.

1456317,A8HOXFB5R1FUK,B005DY0V7K,Matt,"[1, 1]","This series is stellar in its delivery, richly shot, and Krister Henriksson is fantastic in the lead role.  Comments here about the series being available on NetFlix or Itunes are valid; you can see this cheaper.  But however you see it, see it.  It is not often i see i drama so well crafted that i am thinking about an episode 2 or 3 days later.  With respect to the first season, i think Season 2 is better in terms of pacing and storyline (i suspect that is because Season 2 is not beholden to written novels).  i cannot compare it to the Branaugh version, because i haven't seen that yet, but i seriously doubt Braunaugh could match Krister Henriksson in this role.  i only wish Henriksson would make more.Update:  August 6, 2013I have now watched all of the Branagh Wallanders on Netflix.  They are certainly worth watching, and it is nice that there is no real overlap between the Branagh and Henriksson series (in the sense that the Branagh series is based on earlier Mankell stories, and is in this sense, a prequel).  But i still think Henriksson's portrayal of Wallander is better, and urge anyone who enjoys the Branagh version to give Henriksson a try.Henriksson is steely-eyed and stony-faced; understated; and as genuine as the Gracean formula in his hair and the Every-Who-in-Whoville-ness of his beer gut.  Branagh, in contrast, looks like he just left the set of the View (where he was part of an intervention) and took Hollywood lessons on how to brandish a gun.  Henriksson wears a cheap suit and tie (in which he appears demonstrably uncomfortable); Branagh wears a laid back army jacket, and the fashion-appropriate amount of razor stubble.  It is obvious, when watching Henriksson's Wallander, why his daughter is mad at him (because he is, after all, a callous prick, who has always put his job before his family); but it never seems justifed when her counterpart is upset with Branagh's Wallander.  Branagh is, in short, too warm and fuzzy.

1456318,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B005DY0V7K,ocarolan,"[21, 21]","The following refers to the 13 episodes of Season 2.It sometimes seems as though the world is divided into two groups: those for whom subtitles pose no problem, and those for whom they do. If you fall in the former group, and you enjoy police-procedural dramas, then this series is for you. If you fall in the latter group, or if your comfort level plummets when you venture beyond BBC productions, then try the series with Kenneth Branagh and a supporting cast of English-speaking actors pretending to be Swedes - it's not as good, but it is in English.I am a big fan of British police-procedural/detective series, and it was only because I was having trouble finding ones I had not seen that I turned to the Swedish-language ""Wallander"" series with Krister Henriksson in the lead role. I was impressed: it holds its own against the better British series.Which actor you consider the definitive Kurt Wallander may depend on which version of the series you see first (assuming you see more than one). As much as I like Branagh and admire his work, he runs second to Henriksson in the Wallander Stakes. Indeed, the character of Wallander is not the same in the two series. The focus is much more on Wallander in the British series - a choice perhaps necessary to attract Branagh to the role - and he is portrayed as something of a loner, while in the Swedish version the members of Wallander's squad get significant screen time, and Wallander is portrayed more as an intelligent man with good instincts who is effective as a detective, a leader and a mentor. Branagh's Wallander is a man grappling with emotional issues, while Henriksson's comes across as reflective and world-weary but a man largely at peace with himself. I have not read the books on which the series is based, so I do not know which portrayal is truer to Mankell's character, but I do know I'd rather spend time with Henriksson's Wallander than with Branagh's.The supporting cast is excellent, and, as indicated above, we are allowed to get to know their characters. The plots of the episodes held my attention, production values are high, and the locations and Swedish-speaking cast added to the verisimilitude. I especially liked how the relationship between Wallander and the prosecutor (an attractive divorc&eacute;e who is also his neighbor) was handled. They are two adults of middle-age who develop feelings of mutual respect and affection (though they occasionally butt heads on the job), but their attraction is tempered by the baggage each carries from previous relationships. Their mating dance is cautious and restrained -very Scandinavian, one could say - and strikes just the right notes.I rarely sit through the end credits, but the song ""Quiet Night,"" written and performed (in English) by Swedish singer/song-writer Anna Ternheim, which serves as the end theme for many of the episodes and which so effectively captures the mood of the central character and the Scandinavian settings, kept me in my seat as long as they rolled. This song is available from Amazon UK as an mp3 download or as part of a compilation of music from the series. But if you live in the US, it appears that you'll have to listen to it on YouTube.[To fans of the detective/police-procedural genre who are not subtitle-averse, I highly recommend the Swedish series ""Beck"" and ""Van Veeteren"" and the French series ""Spiral"" (originally ""Engrenages"").]",5,Thumbs up - way up!,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,3408,"['following', 'refers', '13', 'episodes', 'Season', '2.It', 'sometimes', 'world', 'divided', 'two', 'groups', 'whom', 'subtitles', 'pose', 'problem', 'whom', 'do', 'fall', 'former', 'group', 'enjoy', 'police-procedural', 'dramas', 'then', 'series', 'fall', 'latter', 'group', 'comfort', 'level', 'plummets', 'when', 'venture', 'BBC', 'productions', 'then', 'try', 'series', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'supporting', 'cast', 'English-speaking', 'actors', 'pretending', 'be', 'Swedes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'English.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'British', 'police-procedural/detective', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'finding', 'ones', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'turned', 'Swedish-language', 'Wallander', 'series', 'Krister', 'Henriksson', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'impressed', 'own', 'better', 'British', 'series.Which', 'actor', 'consider', 'definitive', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'may', 'depend', 'version', 'series', 'see', 'first', 'assuming', 'see', 'more', 'one', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Branagh', 'admire', 'work', 'second', 'Henriksson', 'Wallander', 'Stakes', 'Indeed', 'character', 'Wallander', 'not', 'same', 'two', 'series', 'focus', 'much', 'more', 'Wallander', 'British', 'series', 'choice', 'perhaps', 'necessary', 'attract', 'Branagh', 'role', 'portrayed', 'something', 'loner', 'Swedish', 'version', 'members', 'Wallander', 'squad', 'get', 'significant', 'screen', 'time', 'Wallander', 'portrayed', 'more', 'intelligent', 'man', 'good', 'instincts', 'who', 'effective', 'detective', 'leader', 'mentor', 'Branagh', 'Wallander', 'man', 'grappling', 'emotional', 'issues', 'Henriksson', 'reflective', 'world-weary', 'man', 'largely', 'peace', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'series', 'based', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'portrayal', 'truer', 'Mankell', 'character', 'do', 'know', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spend', 'time', 'Henriksson', 'Wallander', ""Branagh's.The"", 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'indicated', 'are', 'allowed', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'plots', 'episodes', 'held', 'attention', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'locations', 'Swedish-speaking', 'cast', 'added', 'verisimilitude', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'relationship', 'Wallander', 'prosecutor', 'attractive', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'who', 'also', 'neighbor', 'was', 'handled', 'are', 'two', 'adults', 'middle-age', 'who', 'develop', 'feelings', 'mutual', 'respect', 'affection', 'occasionally', 'butt', 'heads', 'job', 'attraction', 'tempered', 'baggage', 'previous', 'relationships', 'mating', 'dance', 'cautious', 'restrained', '-very', 'Scandinavian', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'strikes', 'just', 'right', 'notes.I', 'rarely', 'end', 'credits', 'song', 'Quiet', 'Night', 'written', 'performed', 'English', 'Swedish', 'singer/song-writer', 'Anna', 'Ternheim', 'end', 'theme', 'many', 'episodes', 'so', 'effectively', 'mood', 'central', 'character', 'Scandinavian', 'settings', 'kept', 'seat', 'as', 'long', 'rolled', 'song', 'available', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'mp3', 'download', 'part', 'compilation', 'music', 'series', 'live', 'US', ""'ll"", 'have', 'listen', 'YouTube', '[', 'fans', 'detective/police-procedural', 'genre', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'subtitle-averse', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Swedish', 'series', 'Beck', 'Van', 'Veeteren', 'French', 'series', 'Spiral', 'originally', 'Engrenages', ']']",Henning Mankell's Wallander

Krister Henriksson's acting is a key part of this realism, in my opinion.This set of DVDs, from the second season, was well worth the cost, and now one of the most valuable parts of my DVD collection.",5,Just about the best of crime-mystery genre,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,637,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Columbo', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'fan', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'series', 'Wallander', 'probably', 'most', 'realistic', 'cerebral', 'genre', 'Definitely', 'better', 'British', 'version', 'featuring', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'was', 'time', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'version', 'produced', 'author', 'Wallander', 'series', 'books', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'possess', 'more', 'genuinely', '34', 'Swedish', '34', 'tone', 'Krister', 'Henriksson', 'acting', 'key', 'part', 'realism', 'opinion.This', 'set', 'DVDs', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'well', 'cost', 'now', 'one', 'most', 'valuable', 'parts', 'DVD', 'collection']",Henning Mankell's Wallander
