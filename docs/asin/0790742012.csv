109711,AO2D10XJ4KC9M,0790742012,Eric,"[0, 0]","What a troubled history this sequel has. Harold Ramis, who co-wrote and directed the first film, was originally writing this (under the studio's wishes) sequel with the original cast returning. Rodney Dangerfield was gonna co-write and have his character Al Czervik return to Bushwood and wind up buying the stuffy joint. However, complications and disputes between Dangerfield and the studio led to his departure and with that, along with most of the cast. The cast we see here are a talented bunch but they're characters are nothing more than carbon copies of the original characters. Dangerfield's wise-cracking Czervik was replaced by Jackie Mason's wise-cracking Harry Hartounian; Ted Knight's stuffy Judge Smails was replaced by Robert Stack's stuffy Chandler Young; Bill Murray's goofy groundskeeper Carl Spackler has been replaced by Dan Aykroyd's goofy war vet, Capt. Tom Everett. Even Chevy Chase, the only returning cast member from the original film, doesn't seem to be playing the same Ty Webb we loved (Chase reportedly hated the film throughout shooting). It's easy to see why he despised this film so much. Despite the face that it shouldn't have existed in the first place, the film is loaded with cheap gags and stale dialogue. Mason manages to crack a couple of good lines but the only redeeming features of this film go to Aykroyd, whose character is so wacky it should be in a completely different film, and the gopher, who is still up to no good.",2,Unnecessary Sequel Backed with Unwilling Cast,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,1468,"['What', 'troubled', 'history', 'sequel', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'writing', 'studio', 'wishes', 'sequel', 'original', 'cast', 'returning', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'gon', 'co-write', 'have', 'character', 'Al', 'Czervik', 'return', 'Bushwood', 'wind', 'up', 'buying', 'stuffy', 'joint', 'However', 'complications', 'disputes', 'Dangerfield', 'studio', 'led', 'departure', 'most', 'cast', 'cast', 'see', 'here', 'are', 'talented', 'bunch', ""'re"", 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'carbon', 'copies', 'original', 'characters', 'Dangerfield', 'wise-cracking', 'Czervik', 'was', 'replaced', 'Jackie', 'Mason', 'wise-cracking', 'Harry', 'Hartounian', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'stuffy', 'Judge', 'Smails', 'was', 'replaced', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'stuffy', 'Chandler', 'Young', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'goofy', 'groundskeeper', 'Carl', 'Spackler', 'been', 'replaced', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'goofy', 'war', 'vet', 'Capt', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Even', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'only', 'returning', 'cast', 'member', 'original', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'Ty', 'Webb', 'loved', 'Chase', 'reportedly', 'hated', 'film', 'shooting', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'despised', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'face', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'existed', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'loaded', 'cheap', 'gags', 'stale', 'dialogue', 'Mason', 'crack', 'couple', 'good', 'lines', 'only', 'redeeming', 'features', 'film', 'go', 'Aykroyd', 'character', 'so', 'wacky', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'gopher', 'who', 'still', 'up', 'good']",N/A

Only Ramis isn't in the chair this time (surrendering the honors to sitcom director Allan Arkush), but he did pen the script.The only returning characters are Ty Webb and Mr. Gopher. There were supposed to be more but Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield hated the script and Ramis would not let them make their own changes, which I think was a huge mistake and quite arrogant and out of character for Ramis. Taking Murray's place is Dan Ackroyd as Captain Tom Everett, a mentally-scarred war vet turned mercenary, and Jackie Mason as Jack Hartounian, another boorish, blue-collar millionaire property developer. He's entertaining, but he's certainly no Al Czervik.Ted Knight passed away in 1986, so Judge Smails couldn't return either. Instead we have Robert Stack playing the villainous Candler Young. Again, I like Stack, but he just can't live up to Ted Knight.Hartounian agrees to join the prestigious Bushwood Country Club to please his teenage daughter who is desperate to fit in. The snobs don't take too kindly to his unsavory humor or his connections to the local working class. Together they conspire to shut him down, but Jack Hartounian doesn't give up easily.Almost everything that made Caddyshack so good is dumbed down in this sequel. The R-rating, the raunchiness, the complex character interactions...all gone. Though they somehow still managed to squeeze in a single F-word (courtesy of Randy Quaid's obnoxious lawyer Peter Blunt) in a PG, which is very rare. Caddyshack also had dozens of speaking roles and didn't care if the audience couldn't keep up with it. Those kind of quirks make it endlessly watchable, while Caddyshack II is merely good for a laugh only once in a while.The theme of the working class clashing with greedy snobs who have had everything handed to them might be a little more relevant today, I just wish that they hadn't comprised the film so much. Had there been more continuity with the original we could have had another classic.Not as bad as its reputation suggests, and there are a decent amount of laughs. But just not enough.I do appreciate the Mad Magazine and Root Beer references though.This DVD from 2006 is in fullscreen. Avoid it. I rented the movie from the PlayStation Network in HD (and in widescreen for the first time).

There's nothing wrong with that except this:  The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer to this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980,) and makes fans thinking or wanting Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one.There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to return.  Too bad he didn't.  He carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 over the top.  Jackie Mason is the ""new"" Rodney for part II and does a decent job, even though their comic deliveries are way different.  Dan Aykroyd was great but not in the film enough.  He should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time Bill Murray got in the first one.  Robert Stack (Airplane!) was good in the ""new"" Ted Knight/Villian role.  (We miss you, Ted Knight.  Thanks for the laughs.)Danny Noonan should have been back.  So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later.  Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did.  Instead, the characters involved should have been the main focus like they were in the first one.When you watch this film, keep the mindset that it isn't a true sequel and you may think it's another good or bad eighties comedy.

When he faces extreme predjudice from the snobbish members, the leader of whom is Chandler Young (Robert Stack), he fights back by buying the club and turning it into a mini golf course.

After all, Caddyshack is not a film that needed a sequel.  Why would you need one?  Well, the 80s was a great time for unecessary sequels.  It's hard to top the cast from the first film;  I mean, it was full of funny characters.  This one tries for that and only succeeds to a limited degree.  As much as you may hate this film, how can you not laugh your behind off at Chevy Chase?  He's hilarious in this film.  IN fact, his performance is reason enough to watch this film.  Well, he is playing Ty Webb who was hilarious in the first film.  How did they talk Chase into doing this film?  My theory(and I could be wrong) is that Chase didn't need a paycheck so bad as much as he probably loved playing Ty Webb.  Jackie Mason is no Rodney Dangerfield, not in a million years.  His presence is okay, but he's just not that funny.  Randy Quaid is a little over the top, but he has some pretty hilarious lines.  The whole &quot;putting with a wedgie&quot; thing is great.  And Dan Aykroyd.  Oh Lord, poor Dan Aykroyd.  He should leave Caddyshack 2 off his resume.  He's trying to replace Bill Murray's chracter from the first film, but fails miserably.  We all know Dan can be funny, but wow.  He may say one or two fairly funny things, but that's the extent.  The rest of the time you'll have to deal with his fingernails on a chalkboard voice.  The voice would be okay if he were funny.  These are the comedians of the film, everyone else is there just coz some nonfunny people were needed.  Robert Stack(if you have any information call 1-800-876-5353) is always a good actor and plays a stiff snob convincingly, but it's surely an unsolved mystery why he chose to do this film.  Jonathan Silverman isn't here for laughs, but I've always liked him either way, even though his role here is throwaway.  All in all, the gags here are all hit and miss, but there are some pretty heavy hits I must say(like when Chevy Chase introduces Jackie Mason to some country club members in the men's locker room.

If you told him that NOTHING BUT TROUBLE 2 was to begin shooting tomorrow, he'd be setting his alarm and warming up his mugging in the mirror before hitting the sack.The script for CADDYSHACK 2 was so horrible that Rodney Dangerfield refused to do it.  I remember reading at the time that the studio was finally exercizing a clause in Rodney's original contract that stipulated that he appear in the sequel since the first film made a lot of money and, rather than appear in this wretched sequel, he opted to fight it out in court.(Even the original cast of ROMANCING THE STONE collectively couldn't fight their way out of their stinking follow-up, THE JEWEL OF THE NILE--and even danced in the music video!).But Rodney prevailed.  Take away Rodney, Bill Murray (who sounds like he literally improvised his entire role the first time around), and the late Ted Knight, and all you've got is the gopher.  The gopher, a good Kenny Loggins song (wasted), and a lot of mindless schtick that wouldn't have made it through the first writers' meeting for ""The Carol Burnett Show.""Robert Stack has too much class and testosterone to be a stuffy snob.
